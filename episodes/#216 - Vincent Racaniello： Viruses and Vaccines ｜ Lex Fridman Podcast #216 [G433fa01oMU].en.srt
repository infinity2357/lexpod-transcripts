00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:13,280
you mentioned in one of your lectures on
 

173
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,149
you mentioned in one of your lectures on
virology that there are more viruses in

174
00:03:16,149 --> 00:03:16,159
virology that there are more viruses in
 

175
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,710
virology that there are more viruses in
a liter of coastal seawater than people

176
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:18,720
a liter of coastal seawater than people
 

177
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,550
a liter of coastal seawater than people
on earth

178
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:20,560
on earth
 

179
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,990

in the

180
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,000

nature article titled microbiology by
numbers it says there are 10 to the 31

184
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:28,000
numbers it says there are 10 to the 31
 

185
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,589
numbers it says there are 10 to the 31
viruses on earth

186
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:29,599
viruses on earth
 

187
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,470
viruses on earth
also it says that the rate of viral

188
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:32,480
also it says that the rate of viral
 

189
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,509
also it says that the rate of viral
infection in the ocean stands at

190
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:35,519
infection in the ocean stands at
 

191
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,110
infection in the ocean stands at
10 to the 23 infections per second

192
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,120
10 to the 23 infections per second
 

193
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,430
10 to the 23 infections per second
and these infections remove 20 to 40

194
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:41,440
and these infections remove 20 to 40
 

195
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,390
and these infections remove 20 to 40
percent

percent
 

197
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,350
percent
of all bacterial cells each day there's

198
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:45,360
of all bacterial cells each day there's
 

199
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,190
of all bacterial cells each day there's
a war going on

200
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:47,200
a war going on
 

201
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,630
a war going on
do you uh what do you make of these

202
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:48,640
do you uh what do you make of these
 

203
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,309
do you uh what do you make of these
numbers

204
00:03:50,309 --> 00:03:50,319
numbers
 

205
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,350
numbers
why are there so many viruses so the

206
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:53,360
why are there so many viruses so the
 

207
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,190
why are there so many viruses so the
the numbers you're quoting they're in my

208
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:55,200
the numbers you're quoting they're in my
 

209
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,229
the numbers you're quoting they're in my
first

210
00:03:56,229 --> 00:03:56,239
first
 

211
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,429
first
virology lecture right because

212
00:03:59,429 --> 00:03:59,439
virology lecture right because
 

213
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,869
virology lecture right because
people don't know these numbers and they

214
00:04:00,869 --> 00:04:00,879
people don't know these numbers and they
 

215
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,710
people don't know these numbers and they
get whoa they get wowed by them so i

216
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:02,720
get whoa they get wowed by them so i
 

217
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,149
get whoa they get wowed by them so i
love to give them

218
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:04,159
love to give them
 

219
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,149
love to give them
so the way they decide to interrupt

220
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:06,159
so the way they decide to interrupt
 

221
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,110
so the way they decide to interrupt
as i was saying offline you have one of

222
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,120
as i was saying offline you have one of
 

223
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,949
as i was saying offline you have one of
the best introductory lectures on

224
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:10,959
the best introductory lectures on
 

225
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,309
the best introductory lectures on
virology

226
00:04:12,309 --> 00:04:12,319
virology
 

227
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,990
virology
that i've ever seen introductory

228
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,000
that i've ever seen introductory
 

229
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,750
that i've ever seen introductory
lectures period so i highly recommend

230
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:15,760
lectures period so i highly recommend
 

231
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,710
lectures period so i highly recommend
people

232
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:16,720
people
 

233
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,550
people
find you on youtube and watch it if

234
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:18,560
find you on youtube and watch it if
 

235
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,469
find you on youtube and watch it if
you're curious at all about viruses it

236
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:20,479
you're curious at all about viruses it
 

237
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:21,990
you're curious at all about viruses it
it um

238
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:22,000
it um
 

239
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,749
it um
yeah there's a lot of times throughout

240
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:23,759
yeah there's a lot of times throughout
 

241
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,870
yeah there's a lot of times throughout
watching it

242
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:24,880
watching it
 

243
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,390
watching it
i felt like whoa

244
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:26,400
i felt like whoa
 

245
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,550
i felt like whoa
yeah that's my goal is to and that's

246
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:28,560
yeah that's my goal is to and that's
 

247
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,310
yeah that's my goal is to and that's
what my students tell me one student

248
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:30,320
what my students tell me one student
 

249
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,870
what my students tell me one student
once said i every day after every

250
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:32,880
once said i every day after every
 

251
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,629
once said i every day after every
lecture i could go home and tell my

252
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:34,639
lecture i could go home and tell my
 

253
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,110
lecture i could go home and tell my
roommate something she didn't know

254
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:37,120
roommate something she didn't know
 

255
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,830
roommate something she didn't know
yeah and and blew her away so the number

256
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:39,840
yeah and and blew her away so the number
 

257
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,070
yeah and and blew her away so the number
of viruses is really an amazing number

258
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,080
of viruses is really an amazing number
 

259
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,270
of viruses is really an amazing number
so that number 10 to the 31 is actually

260
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:45,280
so that number 10 to the 31 is actually
 

261
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,790
so that number 10 to the 31 is actually
just the bacterial viruses in the ocean

262
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:48,800
just the bacterial viruses in the ocean
 

263
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,469
just the bacterial viruses in the ocean
so there are viruses that infect

264
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:50,479
so there are viruses that infect
 

265
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:51,749
so there are viruses that infect
everything on the planet including

266
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:51,759
everything on the planet including
 

267
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,990
everything on the planet including
bacteria there's a lot of bacteria in

268
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,000
bacteria there's a lot of bacteria in
 

269
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,790
bacteria there's a lot of bacteria in
the ocean and so 10 to the 31 is from

270
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:56,800
the ocean and so 10 to the 31 is from
 

271
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,030
the ocean and so 10 to the 31 is from
basically particle counts of seawater

272
00:04:59,030 --> 00:04:59,040
basically particle counts of seawater
 

273
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,870
basically particle counts of seawater
all over the world so they're more

274
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:00,880
all over the world so they're more
 

275
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,029
all over the world so they're more
viruses than 10 to the 31 but just in

276
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:03,039
viruses than 10 to the 31 but just in
 

277
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,150
viruses than 10 to the 31 but just in
the ocean

278
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,160
the ocean
 

279
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,950
the ocean
and that number is so big

280
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:06,960
and that number is so big
 

281
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,350
and that number is so big
first of all the mass exceeds

282
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:09,360
first of all the mass exceeds
 

283
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,029
first of all the mass exceeds
that of elephants on the planet by a

284
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:11,039
that of elephants on the planet by a
 

285
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,790
that of elephants on the planet by a
thousand fold

286
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:12,800
thousand fold
 

287
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,510
thousand fold
and if you lined up those viruses end to

288
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:15,520
and if you lined up those viruses end to
 

289
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,110
and if you lined up those viruses end to
end they would go

290
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,120
end they would go
 

291
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,110
end they would go
200 million light years

292
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:19,120
200 million light years
 

293
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,070
200 million light years
into space it's so big a number

294
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,080
into space it's so big a number
 

295
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,110
into space it's so big a number
it's amazing and then yes 10 to the 20

296
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:25,120
it's amazing and then yes 10 to the 20
 

297
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,990
it's amazing and then yes 10 to the 20
some

298
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:26,000
some
 

299
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,870
some
infections per second of these viruses

300
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:28,880
infections per second of these viruses
 

301
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,430
infections per second of these viruses
killing bacteria and releasing all this

302
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:31,440
killing bacteria and releasing all this
 

303
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,469
killing bacteria and releasing all this
organic matter and that's part of this

304
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:34,479
organic matter and that's part of this
 

305
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,350
organic matter and that's part of this
what we call the biogeochemical pump

306
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:37,360
what we call the biogeochemical pump
 

307
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,670
what we call the biogeochemical pump
cycling of material in the ocean

308
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:39,680
cycling of material in the ocean
 

309
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,749
cycling of material in the ocean
the bacteria die

310
00:05:41,749 --> 00:05:41,759
the bacteria die
 

311
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,749
the bacteria die
they start to sink and then they get

312
00:05:43,749 --> 00:05:43,759
they start to sink and then they get
 

313
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,350
they start to sink and then they get
metabolized and converted to compounds

314
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:47,360
metabolized and converted to compounds
 

315
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,790
metabolized and converted to compounds
that that are needed a lot of it gets

316
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:48,800
that that are needed a lot of it gets
 

317
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,870
that that are needed a lot of it gets
released as carbon dioxide and so forth

318
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:50,880
released as carbon dioxide and so forth
 

319
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,310
released as carbon dioxide and so forth
so these are actually really important

320
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:52,320
so these are actually really important
 

321
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,550
so these are actually really important
cycles that are catalyzed by the virus

322
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:54,560
cycles that are catalyzed by the virus
 

323
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,390
cycles that are catalyzed by the virus
it's so wild that nature has developed a

324
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:56,400
it's so wild that nature has developed a
 

325
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,710
it's so wild that nature has developed a
mechanism for mass murder

326
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:58,720
mechanism for mass murder
 

327
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,710
mechanism for mass murder
about bacteria that's one way to look at

328
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:00,720
about bacteria that's one way to look at
 

329
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,790
about bacteria that's one way to look at
it but it's just what happened right

330
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:02,800
it but it's just what happened right
 

331
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,790
it but it's just what happened right
it's interesting i mean

332
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:04,800
it's interesting i mean
 

333
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,390
it's interesting i mean
i wonder what the evolutionary advantage

334
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:06,400
i wonder what the evolutionary advantage
 

335
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,909
i wonder what the evolutionary advantage
of like such fast cycling of life

336
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:09,919
of like such fast cycling of life
 

337
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,790
of like such fast cycling of life
is

338
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:10,800
is
 

339
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,590
is
is it just an accident of evolution that

340
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:13,600
is it just an accident of evolution that
 

341
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,150
is it just an accident of evolution that
viruses are so numerous

342
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:16,160
viruses are so numerous
 

343
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,230
viruses are so numerous
or is it um

344
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:18,240
or is it um
 

345
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,790
or is it um
is it is it a feature not a bug

346
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:20,800
is it is it a feature not a bug
 

347
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,670
is it is it a feature not a bug
so the the fast is

348
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:23,680
so the the fast is
 

349
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,590
so the the fast is
it rain it does not all fast not all

350
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:25,600
it rain it does not all fast not all
 

351
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,309
it rain it does not all fast not all
viruses are fast some are 20 minutes per

352
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:28,319
viruses are fast some are 20 minutes per
 

353
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,150
viruses are fast some are 20 minutes per
cycle some take

354
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:30,160
cycle some take
 

355
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,230

weeks per cycle

356
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:32,240
weeks per cycle
 

357
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,189
weeks per cycle
um

358
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:33,199
um
 

359
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,950
um
but that's just per second there's so

360
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:34,960
but that's just per second there's so
 

361
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,870
but that's just per second there's so
many viruses in the ocean that that's

362
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:36,880
many viruses in the ocean that that's
 

363
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,710
many viruses in the ocean that that's
what you get per second no matter how

364
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:38,720
what you get per second no matter how
 

365
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,270
what you get per second no matter how
fast the cycle is but

366
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,280
fast the cycle is but
 

367
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,670
fast the cycle is but
i look at it this way viruses were

368
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:43,680
i look at it this way viruses were
 

369
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,830
i look at it this way viruses were
probably the first

370
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:45,840
probably the first
 

371
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,189
probably the first
organic entities to evolve on the planet

372
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:49,199
organic entities to evolve on the planet
 

373
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,749
organic entities to evolve on the planet
long ago billions billion years ago

374
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:51,759
long ago billions billion years ago
 

375
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,749
long ago billions billion years ago
just as the earth cooled and organic

376
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:53,759
just as the earth cooled and organic
 

377
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,309
just as the earth cooled and organic
molecules began to form

378
00:06:56,309 --> 00:06:56,319
molecules began to form
 

379
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,710
molecules began to form
i think these self

380
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:58,720
i think these self
 

381
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,270
i think these self
we call them self replicators

382
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:01,280
we call them self replicators
 

383
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,589
we call them self replicators
they're just short things that today

384
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:03,599
they're just short things that today
 

385
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,309
they're just short things that today
would look like rna which is the basis

386
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:06,319
would look like rna which is the basis
 

387
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,189
would look like rna which is the basis
of

388
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:07,199
of
 

389
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,510
of
many viruses right they evolved and they

390
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:09,520
many viruses right they evolved and they
 

391
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,189
many viruses right they evolved and they
were able to replicate of course they

392
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:11,199
were able to replicate of course they
 

393
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,629
were able to replicate of course they
were just naked

394
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:12,639
were just naked
 

395
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,710
were just naked
molecules they had no protection and it

396
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:14,720
molecules they had no protection and it
 

397
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,029
molecules they had no protection and it
was just rna-based

398
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:17,039
was just rna-based
 

399
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,950
was just rna-based
and that that's tough because rna is

400
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:18,960
and that that's tough because rna is
 

401
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,670
and that that's tough because rna is
pretty fragile in the in the world and

402
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:21,680
pretty fragile in the in the world and
 

403
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,469
pretty fragile in the in the world and
um

404
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:22,479
um
 

405
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:23,990
um
it probably didn't get very big as a

406
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:24,000
it probably didn't get very big as a
 

407
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,430
it probably didn't get very big as a
consequence

408
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:25,440
consequence
 

409
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,110
consequence
but then

410
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:27,120
but then
 

411
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,110
but then
proteins evolved and i'm skipping like

proteins evolved and i'm skipping like
 

413
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,629
proteins evolved and i'm skipping like
hundreds of millions of years of

00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:30,639
hundreds of millions of years of
 

415
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,270
hundreds of millions of years of
evolution proteins evolved maybe without

416
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:33,280
evolution proteins evolved maybe without
 

417
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,230
evolution proteins evolved maybe without
a cell

418
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:34,240
a cell
 

419
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,909
a cell
maybe with a cell

420
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:35,919
maybe with a cell
 

421
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,350
maybe with a cell
but then

422
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:37,360
but then
 

423
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,749
but then
to make a cell there probably were some

424
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:39,759
to make a cell there probably were some
 

425
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,670
to make a cell there probably were some
rna-based cells early on but they were

426
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:41,680
rna-based cells early on but they were
 

427
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,909
rna-based cells early on but they were
pretty simple but the cells that we know

428
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:43,919
pretty simple but the cells that we know
 

429
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,950
pretty simple but the cells that we know
of today even bacteria and single celled

430
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:46,960
of today even bacteria and single celled
 

431
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,869
of today even bacteria and single celled
eukaryotes

432
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:48,879
eukaryotes
 

433
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,670
eukaryotes
they have very long dna genomes and you

434
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:51,680
they have very long dna genomes and you
 

435
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,150
they have very long dna genomes and you
need a lot of dna to make a complicated

436
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:54,160
need a lot of dna to make a complicated
 

437
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,950
need a lot of dna to make a complicated
cell and so we think at some point

438
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:56,960
cell and so we think at some point
 

439
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,909
cell and so we think at some point
the rna became dna

440
00:07:59,909 --> 00:07:59,919
the rna became dna
 

441
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,469
the rna became dna
and probably one of the earliest enzymes

442
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:02,479
and probably one of the earliest enzymes
 

443
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,070
and probably one of the earliest enzymes
that arose

444
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:04,080
that arose
 

445
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,909
that arose
is the enzyme that could copy that rna

446
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:05,919
is the enzyme that could copy that rna
 

447
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,670
is the enzyme that could copy that rna
into dna which we now know today as

448
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:07,680
into dna which we now know today as
 

449
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,309
into dna which we now know today as

and
 

457
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,550
and
that that enzyme arose and copied rna to

that that enzyme arose and copied rna to
 

459
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,589
that that enzyme arose and copied rna to

to like complex organism
 

485
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,590

like it seems like earth had a very long

486
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:51,600
like it seems like earth had a very long
 

487
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,550
like it seems like earth had a very long

time
 

489
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,990

like not a very long time without life

490
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:56,000
like not a very long time without life
 

491
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,670

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,190
um maybe i'm discriminating calling
bacteria affirmative life yeah but

498
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:03,200
bacteria affirmative life yeah but
 

499
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,030
bacteria affirmative life yeah but
people would object to you yeah doing

500
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,040
people would object to you yeah doing
 

501
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,350
people would object to you yeah doing
that for sure but it seems like complex

502
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:07,360
that for sure but it seems like complex
 

503
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,750
that for sure but it seems like complex
organ when you start becoming something

504
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:09,760
organ when you start becoming something
 

505
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,949
organ when you start becoming something
like um

506
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:10,959
like um
 

507
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,949
like um
i don't know what's a good uh not animal

508
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:12,959
i don't know what's a good uh not animal
 

509
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,070
i don't know what's a good uh not animal
like but

510
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:14,080
like but
 

511
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,310
like but
more complexity than just like a single

512
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:16,320
more complexity than just like a single
 

513
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,350
more complexity than just like a single
cell

514
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:17,360
cell
 

515
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,590
cell
um what what do you think is the magic

516
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:19,600
um what what do you think is the magic
 

517
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,269
um what what do you think is the magic
there what's the hardest thing if you're

518
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:21,279
there what's the hardest thing if you're
 

519
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,710
there what's the hardest thing if you're
trying to engineer earth and build a

520
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:22,720
trying to engineer earth and build a
 

521
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,509
trying to engineer earth and build a
life

522
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:23,519
life
 

523
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,590
life
and build the simulations obviously

524
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:25,600
and build the simulations obviously
 

525
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,190
and build the simulations obviously
we're living in a video game what this

526
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:27,200
we're living in a video game what this
 

527
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,790
we're living in a video game what this
is so if you're trying to build this

528
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:28,800
is so if you're trying to build this
 

529
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,949
is so if you're trying to build this
vehicle what's the hardest part about

530
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:30,959
vehicle what's the hardest part about
 

531
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,150
vehicle what's the hardest part about
long-term evolution so bacteria

532
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,160
long-term evolution so bacteria
 

533
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,949
long-term evolution so bacteria
are mostly single cells they do make

534
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:36,959
are mostly single cells they do make
 

535
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,030
are mostly single cells they do make
colonies they get together in biofilms

536
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,040
colonies they get together in biofilms
 

537
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,110
colonies they get together in biofilms
which are really important

538
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:41,120
which are really important
 

539
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,910
which are really important
but

540
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:41,920
but
 

541
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,990
but
they're all single bacteria in that and

542
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:44,000
they're all single bacteria in that and
 

543
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,269
they're all single bacteria in that and
the key is

544
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:45,279
the key is
 

545
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,509
the key is
making an organism where

546
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:47,519
making an organism where
 

547
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,430
making an organism where
cells do different things you know we

548
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:49,440
cells do different things you know we
 

549
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,190
cells do different things you know we
have skin cells and eye cells and brain

550
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:51,200
have skin cells and eye cells and brain
 

551
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,590
have skin cells and eye cells and brain
cells and bacteria never do that and the

552
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:53,600
cells and bacteria never do that and the
 

553
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,509
cells and bacteria never do that and the
reason is probably energy

554
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:55,519
reason is probably energy
 

555
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,430
reason is probably energy
bacteria don't can't make enough energy

556
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:57,440
bacteria don't can't make enough energy
 

557
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,870
bacteria don't can't make enough energy
to do that

558
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:58,880
to do that
 

559
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,070
to do that
and so

560
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,080
and so
 

561
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,550
and so
there was another cell

562
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:02,560
there was another cell
 

563
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,069
there was another cell
existing at the time the archaea

564
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:06,079

 

565
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,630

and the idea is that a bacteria went

566
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:08,640
and the idea is that a bacteria went
 

567
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,509
and the idea is that a bacteria went
into

568
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:09,519
into
 

569
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,750
into
an archaea and became the modern day

570
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:11,760
an archaea and became the modern day
 

571
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,110
an archaea and became the modern day
mitochondria

572
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,120
mitochondria
 

573
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,430
mitochondria
the energy factory of the cell and that

574
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:15,440
the energy factory of the cell and that
 

575
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,430
the energy factory of the cell and that
now let that cell

576
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:17,440
now let that cell
 

577
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,190
now let that cell
develop into more and more complicated

578
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:19,200
develop into more and more complicated
 

579
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,030
develop into more and more complicated
organisms like we have today it was all

580
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,040
organisms like we have today it was all
 

581
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,030
organisms like we have today it was all
about energy so the mitochondria the

582
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:23,040
about energy so the mitochondria the
 

583
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,750
about energy so the mitochondria the
energy uh the mitochondria is the magic

584
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:25,760
energy uh the mitochondria is the magic
 

585
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,389
energy uh the mitochondria is the magic
thing i think so it's actually not my

586
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:28,399
thing i think so it's actually not my
 

587
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,990
thing i think so it's actually not my
idea it's nick jones have you heard of

588
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,000
idea it's nick jones have you heard of
 

589
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,509
idea it's nick jones have you heard of
nick jones he's an evolutionary

590
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:31,519
nick jones he's an evolutionary
 

591
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,430
nick jones he's an evolutionary
biologist in the uk

592
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:33,440
biologist in the uk
 

593
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,069
biologist in the uk
and he's he's done experimental work on

594
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:36,079
and he's he's done experimental work on
 

595
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,030
and he's he's done experimental work on
this and it's his idea that the defining

596
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,040
this and it's his idea that the defining
 

597
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,230
this and it's his idea that the defining
point was

598
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:40,240
point was
 

599
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,750
point was
the ability to make a lot of energy

600
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:41,760
the ability to make a lot of energy
 

601
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,190
the ability to make a lot of energy
which a mitochondria can do it's

602
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:43,200
which a mitochondria can do it's
 

603
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,590
which a mitochondria can do it's
basically a whole bacteria inside of a

604
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:45,600
basically a whole bacteria inside of a
 

605
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,269
basically a whole bacteria inside of a
bigger cell and that becomes what we now

606
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:47,279
bigger cell and that becomes what we now
 

607
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,829
bigger cell and that becomes what we now
call eukaryotes and uh

608
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:49,839
call eukaryotes and uh
 

609
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,030
call eukaryotes and uh
that they can get more and more

610
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,040
that they can get more and more
 

611
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,630
that they can get more and more
complicated so let me bring you back to

612
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:52,640
complicated so let me bring you back to
 

613
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,230
complicated so let me bring you back to
the viruses i want to finish that story

614
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:54,240
the viruses i want to finish that story
 

615
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,150
the viruses i want to finish that story
yeah which points the viruses come along

616
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:56,160
yeah which points the viruses come along
 

617
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,710
yeah which points the viruses come along
so remember we have these pre-cellular

618
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:58,720
so remember we have these pre-cellular
 

619
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,630
so remember we have these pre-cellular
they're called pre-cellular replicons

620
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:00,640
they're called pre-cellular replicons
 

621
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,509
they're called pre-cellular replicons
right

622
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:01,519
right
 

623
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,870
right
and

624
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:02,880
and
 

625
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,509
and
so we have a pre-cellular stage where we

626
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:05,519
so we have a pre-cellular stage where we
 

627
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,550
so we have a pre-cellular stage where we
have these

628
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:06,560
have these
 

629
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,190
have these
self-replicating molecules and cells

630
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:09,200
self-replicating molecules and cells
 

631
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,790
self-replicating molecules and cells
arise

632
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:10,800
arise
 

633
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,470
arise
and then

634
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:12,480
and then
 

635
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,470
and then
the self-replicating molecules invade

636
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:14,480
the self-replicating molecules invade
 

637
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,750
the self-replicating molecules invade
the cells

638
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:15,760
the cells
 

639
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,350
the cells
why because it's a hospitable

640
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:17,360
why because it's a hospitable
 

641
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,870
why because it's a hospitable
environment and i mean they didn't know

642
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:18,880
environment and i mean they didn't know
 

643
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,470
environment and i mean they didn't know
that they just went in and it turned out

644
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:20,480
that they just went in and it turned out
 

645
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,509
that they just went in and it turned out
it was beneficial for them so it stuck

646
00:11:23,509 --> 00:11:23,519
it was beneficial for them so it stuck
 

647
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,509
it was beneficial for them so it stuck
and they replicate inside the cell now

648
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:25,519
and they replicate inside the cell now
 

649
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,110
and they replicate inside the cell now
where they have pools of everything they

650
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:27,120
where they have pools of everything they
 

651
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,190
where they have pools of everything they
need they get more and more complicated

652
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:29,200
need they get more and more complicated
 

653
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,710
need they get more and more complicated
and then they steal

654
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:30,720
and then they steal
 

655
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,389
and then they steal
proteins from the cell to build a

656
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:32,399
proteins from the cell to build a
 

657
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,150
proteins from the cell to build a
protective shell

658
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:34,160
protective shell
 

659
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,389
protective shell
and then they can be released as virus

660
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:36,399
and then they can be released as virus
 

661
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,069
and then they can be released as virus
particles they're now protected they can

662
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:38,079
particles they're now protected they can
 

663
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,910
particles they're now protected they can
move from host to host

664
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:39,920
move from host to host
 

665
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,870
move from host to host
and

666
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:40,880
and
 

667
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,509
and
because they're at the earliest stages

668
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:43,519
because they're at the earliest stages
 

669
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,430
because they're at the earliest stages
of cellular evolution

670
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:45,440
of cellular evolution
 

671
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,509
of cellular evolution
they can diversify to infect anything

672
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:47,519
they can diversify to infect anything
 

673
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,710
they can diversify to infect anything
that arises and that is why i think

674
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:50,720
that arises and that is why i think
 

675
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,030
that arises and that is why i think
there's so many of them and everything

676
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:53,040
there's so many of them and everything
 

677
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,870
there's so many of them and everything
on the planet is infected because the

678
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:54,880
on the planet is infected because the
 

679
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,949
on the planet is infected because the
ancestor of everything was infected many

680
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:56,959
ancestor of everything was infected many
 

681
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,430
ancestor of everything was infected many
years ago so it's easier to steal than

682
00:11:59,430 --> 00:11:59,440
years ago so it's easier to steal than
 

683
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,590
years ago so it's easier to steal than
to build from scratch

684
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:01,600
to build from scratch
 

685
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,430
to build from scratch
so like it's easier to sort of break

686
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:03,440
so like it's easier to sort of break
 

687
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,590
so like it's easier to sort of break
into somebody else's thing and steal

688
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:05,600
into somebody else's thing and steal
 

689
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,509
into somebody else's thing and steal
their proteins yes

690
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:07,519
their proteins yes
 

691
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,269
their proteins yes

viruses safe crackers safe crackers so

694
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,040
viruses safe crackers safe crackers so
 

695
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,990
viruses safe crackers safe crackers so
it's just

696
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:14,000
it's just
 

697
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,350
it's just
uh from an evolutionary perspective it's

698
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:17,360
uh from an evolutionary perspective it's
 

699
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,269
uh from an evolutionary perspective it's
yeah it's it's easier to steal because

700
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:19,279
yeah it's it's easier to steal because
 

701
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,269
yeah it's it's easier to steal because
you can select but then you have to

702
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:21,279
you can select but then you have to
 

703
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,430
you can select but then you have to
figure out mechanisms for stealing for

704
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:23,440
figure out mechanisms for stealing for
 

705
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,509
figure out mechanisms for stealing for
breaking into from crack in the states

706
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:25,519
breaking into from crack in the states
 

707
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,949
breaking into from crack in the states
well you don't have to figure out it

708
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:26,959
well you don't have to figure out it
 

709
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,550
well you don't have to figure out it
just happens right

710
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:28,560
just happens right
 

711
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,509
just happens right
because molecules are so diverse that a

712
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:31,519
because molecules are so diverse that a
 

713
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,230
because molecules are so diverse that a
molecule gets into a cell and if there's

714
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:34,240
molecule gets into a cell and if there's
 

715
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,990
molecule gets into a cell and if there's
a protein that sticks to it it's going

716
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:36,000
a protein that sticks to it it's going
 

717
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,190
a protein that sticks to it it's going
to stick

718
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:37,200
to stick
 

719
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,269
to stick
and that gives an advantage

720
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:39,279
and that gives an advantage
 

721
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,030
and that gives an advantage
there's no you know there's no planning

722
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,040
there's no you know there's no planning
 

723
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,190
there's no you know there's no planning
there's no thinking about it right it

724
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:43,200
there's no thinking about it right it
 

725
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,870
there's no thinking about it right it
just happens

726
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:44,880
just happens
 

727
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,230
just happens
oh we'll return to that

728
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:48,240

 

729
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,269

what uh but these numbers are crazy so

730
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:51,279
what uh but these numbers are crazy so
 

731
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,310
what uh but these numbers are crazy so
what as these more complex organisms

00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:54,320
what as these more complex organisms
 

733
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,750
what as these more complex organisms
evolved

let's take us humans as an example

736
00:12:58,629 --> 00:12:58,639
let's take us humans as an example
 

737
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,629
let's take us humans as an example
uh should we be afraid of these high

738
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:00,639
uh should we be afraid of these high
 

739
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,310
uh should we be afraid of these high
numbers should we be worried that

740
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:02,320
numbers should we be worried that
 

741
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,030
numbers should we be worried that
there's so many viruses in the world

742
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:05,040
there's so many viruses in the world
 

743
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,350
there's so many viruses in the world
but to a certain extent i mean they have

744
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:07,360
but to a certain extent i mean they have
 

745
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,190
but to a certain extent i mean they have
it's twofold they're good and bad right

746
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:09,200
it's twofold they're good and bad right
 

747
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,269
it's twofold they're good and bad right
viruses are no there's no question they

748
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:11,279
viruses are no there's no question they
 

749
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,350
viruses are no there's no question they
can be bad we know that because they've

750
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:13,360
can be bad we know that because they've
 

751
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,030
can be bad we know that because they've
infected and caused disease throughout

752
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:15,040
infected and caused disease throughout
 

753
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,870
infected and caused disease throughout
history but we're also you and i are

754
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:16,880
history but we're also you and i are
 

755
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,949
history but we're also you and i are
full of viruses that don't hurt us at

756
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:18,959
full of viruses that don't hurt us at
 

757
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,470
full of viruses that don't hurt us at
all and probably help us and every

758
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:20,480
all and probably help us and every
 

759
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,949
all and probably help us and every
organism is the same so they are

760
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:22,959
organism is the same so they are
 

761
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,710
organism is the same so they are
clearly beneficial as a consequence so i

762
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:26,720
clearly beneficial as a consequence so i
 

763
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,150
clearly beneficial as a consequence so i
think

764
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:28,160
think
 

765
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,350
think
so every living thing on the planet has

766
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:31,360
so every living thing on the planet has
 

767
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,990
so every living thing on the planet has
multiple viruses infecting everything

768
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:34,000
multiple viruses infecting everything
 

769
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,670
multiple viruses infecting everything
you can see

770
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:35,680
you can see
 

771
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,030
you can see
and

772
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,040
and
 

773
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,470
and
most of them i think we don't worry

774
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:38,480
most of them i think we don't worry
 

775
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,430
most of them i think we don't worry
about

776
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:39,440
about
 

777
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,430
about
because they can't infect us they're

778
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:41,440
because they can't infect us they're
 

779
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,590
because they can't infect us they're
unable in fact

780
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:43,600
unable in fact
 

781
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,110
unable in fact
now you could actually you can actually

782
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:45,120
now you could actually you can actually
 

783
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,550
now you could actually you can actually
take your feces and send them to a

784
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:46,560
take your feces and send them to a
 

785
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,910
take your feces and send them to a
company and they will sequence your

786
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:47,920
company and they will sequence your
 

787
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,470
company and they will sequence your
viruses in your feces for you your fecal

788
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:50,480
viruses in your feces for you your fecal
 

789
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,150
viruses in your feces for you your fecal

firearm right
 

791
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,150
firearm right
and the most

792
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:54,160
and the most
 

793
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,350
and the most
common

794
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:55,360
common
 

795
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,550
common
virus in human feces is a plant virus

796
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:58,560
virus in human feces is a plant virus
 

797
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,310
virus in human feces is a plant virus
that infects peppers

798
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:00,320
that infects peppers
 

799
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,949
that infects peppers
it's called pepper model mosaic virus

800
00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:02,959
it's called pepper model mosaic virus
 

801
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,150
it's called pepper model mosaic virus
and that's because people eat a lot of

802
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:04,160
and that's because people eat a lot of
 

803
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,389
and that's because people eat a lot of
peppers and it just passes right through

804
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:06,399
peppers and it just passes right through
 

805
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,629
peppers and it just passes right through
you cabbage is full of viruses from the

806
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:08,639
you cabbage is full of viruses from the
 

807
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,230
you cabbage is full of viruses from the
insects that walk on the cabbage in the

808
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:10,240
insects that walk on the cabbage in the
 

809
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,910
insects that walk on the cabbage in the
fields we eat them

810
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:11,920
fields we eat them
 

811
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,990
fields we eat them
they just pass us so i think most of the

812
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:14,000
they just pass us so i think most of the
 

813
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,310
they just pass us so i think most of the
viruses we don't need to worry about

814
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:16,320
viruses we don't need to worry about
 

815
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,350
viruses we don't need to worry about
except when we're talking about species

816
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:19,360
except when we're talking about species
 

817
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,750
except when we're talking about species
that are closest to us mammals

818
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:21,760
that are closest to us mammals
 

819
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,030
that are closest to us mammals
of course

820
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,040
of course
 

821
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,350
of course
i and i think the most numerous ones are

i and i think the most numerous ones are
 

823
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,509
i and i think the most numerous ones are
the most concerning they're viruses like

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,110
the most concerning they're viruses like
bats bats are 20 of mammals and rodents

bats bats are 20 of mammals and rodents
are 40

828
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:32,320
are 40
 

829
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,110
are 40
of mammals and we humans

830
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:35,120
of mammals and we humans
 

831
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,829
of mammals and we humans
live nearby right yeah and we know

832
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:37,839
live nearby right yeah and we know
 

833
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,350
live nearby right yeah and we know
throughout history many viruses have

834
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:39,360
throughout history many viruses have
 

835
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,949
throughout history many viruses have
come from bats and from rodents to

836
00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:40,959
come from bats and from rodents to
 

837
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,470
come from bats and from rodents to
people no question about it there's a

838
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:42,480
people no question about it there's a
 

839
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,069
people no question about it there's a
proximity in terms of just living

840
00:14:44,069 --> 00:14:44,079
proximity in terms of just living
 

841
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,150
proximity in terms of just living
together in a proximity genetically to

842
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,160
together in a proximity genetically to
 

843
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,069
together in a proximity genetically to
so it's more likely that a virus will

844
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:48,079
so it's more likely that a virus will
 

845
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,389
so it's more likely that a virus will
jump from a bat in the road and birds

846
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:50,399
jump from a bat in the road and birds
 

847
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,790
jump from a bat in the road and birds
too birds can give us their viruses

848
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:52,800
too birds can give us their viruses
 

849
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,389
too birds can give us their viruses
that's happened you know influenza

850
00:14:54,389 --> 00:14:54,399
that's happened you know influenza
 

851
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,350
that's happened you know influenza
viruses come from birds mainly so i

852
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:57,360
viruses come from birds mainly so i
 

853
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,110
viruses come from birds mainly so i
think those are the three

854
00:14:59,110 --> 00:14:59,120
think those are the three
 

855
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,550
think those are the three
species

856
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:00,560
species
 

857
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,230
species
not species it's higher than species

858
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:02,240
not species it's higher than species
 

859
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,509
not species it's higher than species
obviously but those are the three i

860
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:03,519
obviously but those are the three i
 

861
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,030
obviously but those are the three i
would worry about in terms of getting

862
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,040
would worry about in terms of getting
 

863
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,389
would worry about in terms of getting
their viruses and we don't really know

864
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:08,399
their viruses and we don't really know
 

865
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,389
their viruses and we don't really know
what's out there right we have very

866
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:10,399
what's out there right we have very
 

867
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,269
what's out there right we have very
little clue about what viruses and i've

868
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:13,279
little clue about what viruses and i've
 

869
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,470
little clue about what viruses and i've
for years wanted to capture wild mice in

870
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:16,480
for years wanted to capture wild mice in
 

871
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,230
for years wanted to capture wild mice in
my backyard and see what viruses they

872
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:18,240
my backyard and see what viruses they
 

873
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,069
my backyard and see what viruses they
have because no one knows

874
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:20,079
have because no one knows
 

875
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,310
have because no one knows
wait and it's you can't ask them so you

876
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:22,320
wait and it's you can't ask them so you
 

877
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,629
wait and it's you can't ask them so you
mean map uh like is there a way to ask

878
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:24,639
mean map uh like is there a way to ask
 

879
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,069
mean map uh like is there a way to ask
them yeah no i have to would have to

880
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:26,079
them yeah no i have to would have to
 

881
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,230
them yeah no i have to would have to
sacrifice them and take tissue and then

882
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:28,240
sacrifice them and take tissue and then
 

883
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,509
sacrifice them and take tissue and then
bring it in the lab and do genome

884
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:29,519
bring it in the lab and do genome
 

885
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,110
bring it in the lab and do genome
sequences so you can do a

886
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:31,120
sequences so you can do a
 

887
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,870
sequences so you can do a
thorough sequencing to determine which

888
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:32,880
thorough sequencing to determine which
 

889
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,590
thorough sequencing to determine which
viruses is there a sufficiently good

890
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:35,600
viruses is there a sufficiently good
 

891
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,150
viruses is there a sufficiently good
categorization of viruses where you'd be

892
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:38,160
categorization of viruses where you'd be
 

893
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,710
categorization of viruses where you'd be
that's a very good question so whenever

894
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:40,720
that's a very good question so whenever
 

895
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,949
that's a very good question so whenever
you do sequence right you get some

896
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:42,959
you do sequence right you get some
 

897
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,110
you do sequence right you get some
environmental sample and you extract

898
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:45,120
environmental sample and you extract
 

899
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,189
environmental sample and you extract
nucleic acid and you sequence it what

900
00:15:47,189 --> 00:15:47,199
nucleic acid and you sequence it what
 

901
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,509
nucleic acid and you sequence it what
you do is you run it past the database

902
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:49,519
you do is you run it past the database
 

903
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,430
you do is you run it past the database
with the gold standard is the genbank

904
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:51,440
with the gold standard is the genbank
 

905
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,269
with the gold standard is the genbank
database which is maintained here in the

906
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:53,279
database which is maintained here in the
 

907
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,550
database which is maintained here in the
u.s and you see if you get any hits

908
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:56,560
u.s and you see if you get any hits
 

909
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,269
u.s and you see if you get any hits
and then you can say ah look this this

910
00:15:59,269 --> 00:15:59,279
and then you can say ah look this this
 

911
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,110
and then you can say ah look this this
sequence is similar to this virus and

912
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:01,120
sequence is similar to this virus and
 

913
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,430
sequence is similar to this virus and
you can classify all the viruses you see

914
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:03,440
you can classify all the viruses you see
 

915
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,350
you can classify all the viruses you see
the problem is

916
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:05,360
the problem is
 

917
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,710
the problem is
90

918
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:06,720
90
 

919
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,269
90
of your sequence is dark matter it

920
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:09,279
of your sequence is dark matter it
 

921
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,829
of your sequence is dark matter it
doesn't hit with anything it's

922
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:11,839
doesn't hit with anything it's
 

923
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,389
doesn't hit with anything it's
probably a lot of it is unknown viruses

924
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:14,399
probably a lot of it is unknown viruses
 

925
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,829
probably a lot of it is unknown viruses
and that's going to be hard to figure

926
00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:15,839
and that's going to be hard to figure
 

927
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:16,790
and that's going to be hard to figure
out because someone's going to have to

928
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:16,800
out because someone's going to have to
 

929
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,509
out because someone's going to have to
go after it and sort it through so yes

930
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:19,519
go after it and sort it through so yes
 

931
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,670
go after it and sort it through so yes
you can find a lot of viruses and the

932
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:21,680
you can find a lot of viruses and the
 

933
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,189
you can find a lot of viruses and the
numbers you get are astounding you can

934
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:23,199
numbers you get are astounding you can
 

935
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,590
numbers you get are astounding you can
find thousands of new viruses just by

936
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:25,600
find thousands of new viruses just by
 

937
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,629
find thousands of new viruses just by
looking in

938
00:16:26,629 --> 00:16:26,639
looking in
 

939
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,870
looking in
various life forms but

940
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:28,880
various life forms but
 

941
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,150
various life forms but
there are many more that we don't pick

942
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:30,160
there are many more that we don't pick
 

943
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,030
there are many more that we don't pick
up because they're not in the database

944
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,040
up because they're not in the database
 

945
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,110
up because they're not in the database
maybe this is a good time to take a

946
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:35,120
maybe this is a good time to take a
 

947
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,790
maybe this is a good time to take a
quick tangent what do you think about

948
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:36,800
quick tangent what do you think about
 

949
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,389
quick tangent what do you think about
alpha fold too i don't know if you've

950
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:38,399
alpha fold too i don't know if you've
 

951
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,150
alpha fold too i don't know if you've
been paying attention to that

952
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:40,160
been paying attention to that
 

953
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,230
been paying attention to that
well the them uh deep mind solving the

954
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:42,240
well the them uh deep mind solving the
 

955
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,150
well the them uh deep mind solving the
protein folding problem

956
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:44,160
protein folding problem
 

957
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,550
protein folding problem
and then also releasing

958
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:46,560
and then also releasing
 

959
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,749
and then also releasing
first of all

960
00:16:47,749 --> 00:16:47,759
first of all
 

961
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,829
first of all
open sourcing the code which is for me

962
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:49,839
open sourcing the code which is for me
 

963
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,230
open sourcing the code which is for me
as a software person that i love and

964
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:52,240
as a software person that i love and
 

965
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,949
as a software person that i love and
then second of all also making

966
00:16:54,949 --> 00:16:54,959
then second of all also making
 

967
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,269
then second of all also making
like 300 000 predictions or something

968
00:16:57,269 --> 00:16:57,279
like 300 000 predictions or something
 

969
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,949
like 300 000 predictions or something
like that for different protein

970
00:16:58,949 --> 00:16:58,959
like that for different protein
 

971
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,670
like that for different protein
structures and releasing that data

972
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:01,680
structures and releasing that data
 

973
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,110
structures and releasing that data
yeah

974
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:03,120
yeah
 

975
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,949
yeah
so on the side of because you make

976
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:04,959
so on the side of because you make
 

977
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,590
so on the side of because you make
you're saying there's dark matter right

978
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:07,600
you're saying there's dark matter right
 

979
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,829
you're saying there's dark matter right
is there something

980
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:09,839
is there something
 

981
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,390
is there something
um what first what are your general

982
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:12,400
um what first what are your general
 

983
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,710
um what first what are your general
thoughts level of excitement about their

984
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:14,720
thoughts level of excitement about their
 

985
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,510
thoughts level of excitement about their
uh their work and second how can that be

986
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:17,520
uh their work and second how can that be
 

987
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,710
uh their work and second how can that be

absolutely because in all this dark
 

997
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,829
absolutely because in all this dark
sequence you can

998
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:27,839
sequence you can
 

999
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,150
sequence you can
translate it and make a protein you can

1000
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:30,160
translate it and make a protein you can
 

1001
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,590
translate it and make a protein you can
see what a protein looks like it has

what we call an open reading frame right

1004
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:33,840
what we call an open reading frame right
 

1005
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,070
what we call an open reading frame right
a start and a stop and right now it's

1006
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:36,080
a start and a stop and right now it's
 

1007
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,909
a start and a stop and right now it's
just a bunch of amino acids but if we

1008
00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:37,919
just a bunch of amino acids but if we
 

1009
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:38,950
just a bunch of amino acids but if we
could

1010
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:38,960
could
 

1011
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,669
could
fold it maybe the fold would recognize

1012
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:41,679
fold it maybe the fold would recognize
 

1013
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,350
fold it maybe the fold would recognize
like something we already know some

1014
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:43,360
like something we already know some
 

1015
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,190
like something we already know some
protein fold which gives you

1016
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:45,200
protein fold which gives you
 

1017
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,710
protein fold which gives you
a lot of clues right because there are

1018
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:46,720
a lot of clues right because there are
 

1019
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,590
a lot of clues right because there are
only so many protein folds in biology

1020
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:49,600
only so many protein folds in biology
 

1021
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,909
only so many protein folds in biology
and that dark matter is probably one of

1022
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:51,919
and that dark matter is probably one of
 

1023
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:52,549
and that dark matter is probably one of
them

1024
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:52,559
them
 

1025
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,390
them
so i think that's very exciting because

1026
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:54,400
so i think that's very exciting because
 

1027
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,510
so i think that's very exciting because
for years i followed structural

structures of viruses they're too big we

1038
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:04,559
structures of viruses they're too big we
 

1039
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,549
structures of viruses they're too big we
could do small molecules like myoglobin

1040
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:06,559
could do small molecules like myoglobin
 

1041
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:07,990
could do small molecules like myoglobin
and that was the first one done took

1042
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:08,000
and that was the first one done took
 

1043
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,549
and that was the first one done took
years to do that and then

1044
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:10,559
years to do that and then
 

1045
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,029
years to do that and then
as computational power increased then

1046
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:13,039
as computational power increased then
 

1047
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,950
as computational power increased then
they could start to do viruses but it

1048
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:14,960
they could start to do viruses but it
 

1049
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,630
they could start to do viruses but it
took a long time

it depended on getting crystals of the
 

1055
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,750
it depended on getting crystals of the
virus right and now we can do

1056
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:22,760
virus right and now we can do
 

1057
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,870
virus right and now we can do
cryo-electron microscopy which is much

00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:24,880
cryo-electron microscopy which is much
 

1059
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,310
cryo-electron microscopy which is much
faster

you could solve the spike of sars cov2

1062
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:28,559
you could solve the spike of sars cov2
 

1063
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,470
you could solve the spike of sars cov2

but you're limited you can't do

1070
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:37,360
but you're limited you can't do
 

1071
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,230
but you're limited you can't do
huge proteins you can only do moderately

1072
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:40,240
huge proteins you can only do moderately
 

1073
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,430
huge proteins you can only do moderately
sized ones so or

1074
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:43,440
sized ones so or
 

1075
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,590
sized ones so or
actually you can do viruses but you

1076
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:45,600
actually you can do viruses but you
 

1077
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,270
actually you can do viruses but you
can't do small proteins so that's

1078
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:47,280
can't do small proteins so that's
 

1079
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,150
can't do small proteins so that's
speeded it up but it's still too fast to

1080
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:50,160
speeded it up but it's still too fast to
 

1081
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,909
speeded it up but it's still too fast to
solve you get a new protein you want to

1082
00:18:51,909 --> 00:18:51,919
solve you get a new protein you want to
 

1083
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,190
solve you get a new protein you want to
solve its structure so if we could

1084
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:53,200
solve its structure so if we could
 

1085
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,950
solve its structure so if we could
predict it and i know from talking to

1086
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:54,960
predict it and i know from talking to
 

1087
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,230
predict it and i know from talking to
structural biologists this has been

1088
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:56,240
structural biologists this has been
 

1089
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,549
structural biologists this has been
their holy grail from day one they want

1090
00:18:58,549 --> 00:18:58,559
their holy grail from day one they want
 

1091
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,470
their holy grail from day one they want
to be able to take a sequence of a

1092
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:00,480
to be able to take a sequence of a
 

1093
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,990
to be able to take a sequence of a
protein put it in a computer and have

1094
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:02,000
protein put it in a computer and have
 

1095
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,830
protein put it in a computer and have
the structure put out without having to

1096
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:03,840
the structure put out without having to
 

1097
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,909
the structure put out without having to
do all the experiment so that's why this

1098
00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:05,919
do all the experiment so that's why this
 

1099
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,590
do all the experiment so that's why this
is very exciting that yeah you can

1100
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:07,600
is very exciting that yeah you can
 

1101
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,750
is very exciting that yeah you can
predict it i mean it's not

1102
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:09,760
predict it i mean it's not
 

1103
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,270
predict it i mean it's not
finished obviously and there's more to

1104
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:11,280
finished obviously and there's more to
 

1105
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,950
finished obviously and there's more to
do but i think it will be a day where

1106
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:12,960
do but i think it will be a day where
 

1107
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,430
do but i think it will be a day where
you could take any amino acid sequence

1108
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:15,440
you could take any amino acid sequence
 

1109
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,270
you could take any amino acid sequence
and predict what it's going to look like

1110
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:17,280
and predict what it's going to look like
 

1111
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,950
and predict what it's going to look like
see but yeah like aren't structural

1112
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:18,960
see but yeah like aren't structural
 

1113
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,710
see but yeah like aren't structural
biology is going to get greedy so once

1114
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:20,720
biology is going to get greedy so once
 

1115
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,549
biology is going to get greedy so once
you have that don't you want to go more

1116
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:22,559
you have that don't you want to go more
 

1117
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,270
you have that don't you want to go more
complicated then don't you want to go

1118
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:25,280
complicated then don't you want to go
 

1119
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,549
complicated then don't you want to go
because that's that's just the first

1120
00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:26,559
because that's that's just the first
 

1121
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,630
because that's that's just the first
step right to go from amino acid to the

1122
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:28,640
step right to go from amino acid to the
 

1123
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,470
step right to go from amino acid to the
structure then there's like multiple

1124
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:30,480
structure then there's like multiple
 

1125
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,070
structure then there's like multiple
protein interactions

1126
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,080
protein interactions
 

1127
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,310
protein interactions
like how do you get to the virus

1128
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:34,320
like how do you get to the virus
 

1129
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,029
like how do you get to the virus
well so that's what the ultimate goal of

1130
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:37,039
well so that's what the ultimate goal of
 

1131
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,789
well so that's what the ultimate goal of
getting a structure is that then you can

1132
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:38,799
getting a structure is that then you can
 

1133
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,870
getting a structure is that then you can
do experiments and figure out what the

1134
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:40,880
do experiments and figure out what the
 

1135
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,909
do experiments and figure out what the
structure means right so many

1136
00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:43,919
structure means right so many
 

1137
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,789
structure means right so many
in the old days structural biology was a

1138
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:46,799
in the old days structural biology was a
 

1139
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,029
in the old days structural biology was a
career in itself you worked with people

1140
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:49,039
career in itself you worked with people
 

1141
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,950
career in itself you worked with people
who had a system and you solved proteins

1142
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:50,960
who had a system and you solved proteins
 

1143
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,990
who had a system and you solved proteins
for them and then you moved on to

1144
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,000
for them and then you moved on to
 

1145
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,270
for them and then you moved on to
another one you didn't really do any

1146
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:53,280
another one you didn't really do any
 

1147
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,110
another one you didn't really do any
experiments the other people got to do

1148
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:55,120
experiments the other people got to do
 

1149
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,950
experiments the other people got to do
all the interesting experiments right

1150
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:56,960
all the interesting experiments right
 

1151
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,549
all the interesting experiments right
now

1152
00:19:58,549 --> 00:19:58,559
now
 

1153
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,029
now
young structural biologists are

1154
00:20:01,029 --> 00:20:01,039
young structural biologists are
 

1155
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,510
young structural biologists are
multifaceted they solve the structure

1156
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:03,520
multifaceted they solve the structure
 

1157
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,950
multifaceted they solve the structure
and then they say what happens if we

1158
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:04,960
and then they say what happens if we
 

1159
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,510
and then they say what happens if we
change this amino acid oh look it it

1160
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:07,520
change this amino acid oh look it it
 

1161
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,270
change this amino acid oh look it it
blocks binding to the receptor this must

1162
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:09,280
blocks binding to the receptor this must
 

1163
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,270
blocks binding to the receptor this must
be the receptor binding interface so

1164
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:11,280
be the receptor binding interface so
 

1165
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,510
be the receptor binding interface so
that's the exciting stuff absolutely is

1166
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:13,520
that's the exciting stuff absolutely is
 

1167
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,110
that's the exciting stuff absolutely is
doing the experiment i wonder if you can

1168
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:15,120
doing the experiment i wonder if you can
 

1169
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,350
doing the experiment i wonder if you can
do some kinds of like

1170
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:17,360
do some kinds of like
 

1171
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,789
do some kinds of like
simulations of like

1172
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:20,799
simulations of like
 

1173
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,950
simulations of like
you know different proteins or

1174
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:22,960
you know different proteins or
 

1175
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,190
you know different proteins or
multi-protein systems going to war

1176
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:25,200
multi-protein systems going to war
 

1177
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,510
multi-protein systems going to war
against each other

1178
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:27,520
against each other
 

1179
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,669
against each other
like to try to figure out

1180
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:29,679
like to try to figure out
 

1181
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,270
like to try to figure out
you know

1182
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:31,280
you know
 

1183
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,149
you know
reinforcement learning is used in alpha

1184
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:34,159
reinforcement learning is used in alpha
 

1185
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,029
reinforcement learning is used in alpha
zero for example to learn chess and go

1186
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:37,039
zero for example to learn chess and go
 

1187
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,110
zero for example to learn chess and go
and that's using the self-play mechanism

1188
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:39,120
and that's using the self-play mechanism
 

1189
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,870
and that's using the self-play mechanism
where the thing plays against itself

1190
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:40,880
where the thing plays against itself
 

1191
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,630
where the thing plays against itself
sure and learns better and better yeah

1192
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:42,640
sure and learns better and better yeah
 

1193
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,470
sure and learns better and better yeah
whether you can i wonder if you can

1194
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:44,480
whether you can i wonder if you can
 

1195
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,630
whether you can i wonder if you can
simulate almost evolution in that way

1196
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:46,640
simulate almost evolution in that way
 

1197
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,510
simulate almost evolution in that way
for us for primitive biological systems

1198
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:49,520
for us for primitive biological systems
 

1199
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,430
for us for primitive biological systems
have them in stimulation

1200
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:51,440
have them in stimulation
 

1201
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,350
have them in stimulation
fight each other and then see what comes

1202
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:53,360
fight each other and then see what comes
 

1203
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,110
fight each other and then see what comes
out like a super dangerous virus comes

1204
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:55,120
out like a super dangerous virus comes
 

1205
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,710
out like a super dangerous virus comes
out or super

1206
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:56,720
out or super
 

1207
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,470
out or super
like chuck norris type of thing that

1208
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:58,480
like chuck norris type of thing that
 

1209
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,990
like chuck norris type of thing that
defends against the super dangerous

1210
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:00,000
defends against the super dangerous
 

1211
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,070
defends against the super dangerous
virus and it's all in simulation so an

1212
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:02,080
virus and it's all in simulation so an
 

1213
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,909
virus and it's all in simulation so an
example would be

1214
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:03,919
example would be
 

1215
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,149
example would be
we have all these variants of sars cov2

1216
00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:06,159
we have all these variants of sars cov2
 

1217
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,750
we have all these variants of sars cov2
arising right

1218
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:07,760
arising right
 

1219
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,190
arising right
which which

1220
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:09,200
which which
 

1221
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,110
which which
look to be selected by

1222
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:11,120
look to be selected by
 

1223
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,950
look to be selected by
immune responses

1224
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:12,960
immune responses
 

1225
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,430
immune responses
but we now we know what amino acids are

1226
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:15,440
but we now we know what amino acids are
 

1227
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,190
but we now we know what amino acids are
changing in the spike

1228
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:17,200
changing in the spike
 

1229
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,110
changing in the spike
and how they block antibody bonding you

1230
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:19,120
and how they block antibody bonding you
 

1231
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,470
and how they block antibody bonding you
could simulate that you could say

1232
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:22,480
could simulate that you could say
 

1233
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,310
could simulate that you could say
what what is the antibody looking at you

1234
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:24,320
what what is the antibody looking at you
 

1235
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,990
what what is the antibody looking at you
these are where antibodies bind on

1236
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,000
these are where antibodies bind on
 

1237
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,990
these are where antibodies bind on
proteins are called epitopes right you

1238
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:28,000
proteins are called epitopes right you
 

1239
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,669
proteins are called epitopes right you
could map them all and change them in a

1240
00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:29,679
could map them all and change them in a
 

1241
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,669
could map them all and change them in a
simulation one by one and and go back

1242
00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:31,679
simulation one by one and and go back
 

1243
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,350
simulation one by one and and go back
and forth between the antibody and the

1244
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:33,360
and forth between the antibody and the
 

1245
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,510
and forth between the antibody and the
virus so all these

1246
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:35,520
virus so all these
 

1247
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,350
virus so all these
evolution is is what we call an arms

1248
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:37,360
evolution is is what we call an arms
 

1249
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,990
evolution is is what we call an arms
race right the virus changes

1250
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:40,000
race right the virus changes
 

1251
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,830
race right the virus changes
and then it evades the host and then the

1252
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:41,840
and then it evades the host and then the
 

1253
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,070
and then it evades the host and then the
host can change the host takes longer to

1254
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:44,080
host can change the host takes longer to
 

1255
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,430
host can change the host takes longer to
change though unfortunately it takes

1256
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:45,440
change though unfortunately it takes
 

1257
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,230
change though unfortunately it takes
geological time but it can and then the

1258
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:48,240
geological time but it can and then the
 

1259
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,230
geological time but it can and then the
virus can change and it can go back and

1260
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:50,240
virus can change and it can go back and
 

1261
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,710
virus can change and it can go back and
forth and we can see evidence of this

1262
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:52,720
forth and we can see evidence of this
 

1263
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,110
forth and we can see evidence of this
in genome sequences of both viruses and

1264
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:55,120
in genome sequences of both viruses and
 

1265
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,149
in genome sequences of both viruses and
their hosts

1266
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:56,159
their hosts
 

1267
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,029
their hosts
and so

1268
00:21:57,029 --> 00:21:57,039
and so
 

1269
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,270
and so
you can take a protein

1270
00:21:59,270 --> 00:21:59,280
you can take a protein
 

1271
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,190
you can take a protein
in a host that is a receptor for

1272
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:01,200
in a host that is a receptor for
 

1273
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,510
in a host that is a receptor for
multiple viruses and you can see all the

1274
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:03,520
multiple viruses and you can see all the
 

1275
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,830
multiple viruses and you can see all the
impacts of virus pressure on it and you

1276
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:05,840
impacts of virus pressure on it and you
 

1277
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,430
impacts of virus pressure on it and you
could simulate that for sure and that's

1278
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:07,440
could simulate that for sure and that's
 

1279
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,950
could simulate that for sure and that's
just one thing that you could do you

1280
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:08,960
just one thing that you could do you
 

1281
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,029
just one thing that you could do you
could simulate

1282
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:11,039
could simulate
 

1283
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,070
could simulate
changes in say a an enzyme that makes it

1284
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:14,080
changes in say a an enzyme that makes it
 

1285
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,830
changes in say a an enzyme that makes it
resistant to a drug and predict all the

1286
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:15,840
resistant to a drug and predict all the
 

1287
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,149
resistant to a drug and predict all the
drug resistance

1288
00:22:18,149 --> 00:22:18,159
drug resistance
 

1289
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,470
drug resistance
but but the problem is

1290
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:20,480
but but the problem is
 

1291
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,990
but but the problem is
people like me the experimental

1292
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:22,000
people like me the experimental
 

1293
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,669
people like me the experimental
virologist don't know how to do any of

1294
00:22:23,669 --> 00:22:23,679
virologist don't know how to do any of
 

1295
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,630
virologist don't know how to do any of
that so we need to collaborate with

1296
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:26,640
that so we need to collaborate with
 

1297
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,590
that so we need to collaborate with
people i guess oh with other humans

1298
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:29,600
people i guess oh with other humans
 

1299
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,549
people i guess oh with other humans
we do that we do that okay but with

1300
00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:32,559
we do that we do that okay but with
 

1301
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,950
we do that we do that okay but with
people from a field that we're not used

1302
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:34,960
people from a field that we're not used
 

1303
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,590
people from a field that we're not used
to like i suppose people who

1304
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:37,600
to like i suppose people who
 

1305
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,430
to like i suppose people who
would it be ai i suppose yeah machine

1306
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:39,440
would it be ai i suppose yeah machine
 

1307
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,190
would it be ai i suppose yeah machine

00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:24,640
what are the categories of small things
 

1357
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,630
what are the categories of small things
small biological things in this world

1358
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:26,640
small biological things in this world
 

1359
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,990
small biological things in this world
that can kill you

1360
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:28,000
that can kill you
 

1361
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,789
that can kill you
kill us humans

1362
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:30,799
kill us humans
 

1363
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,630
kill us humans
let's let's look you said like most

1364
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:32,640
let's let's look you said like most
 

1365
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,190
let's let's look you said like most
viruses are friendly or at least not

1366
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:35,200
viruses are friendly or at least not
 

1367
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,070
viruses are friendly or at least not
unfriendly right but let's look at the

1368
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:38,080
unfriendly right but let's look at the
 

1369
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,870
unfriendly right but let's look at the
unfriendly ones and viruses and bacteria

1370
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:40,880
unfriendly ones and viruses and bacteria
 

1371
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,549
unfriendly ones and viruses and bacteria
and those kinds of things when you look

1372
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:42,559
and those kinds of things when you look
 

1373
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,230
and those kinds of things when you look
at the full spectrum of things that can

1374
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:44,240
at the full spectrum of things that can
 

1375
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,110
at the full spectrum of things that can
kill you

1376
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:45,120
kill you
 

1377
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,190
kill you
can you kind of paint a brief picture

1378
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:47,200
can you kind of paint a brief picture
 

1379
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,149
can you kind of paint a brief picture
yeah i think

1380
00:23:48,149 --> 00:23:48,159
yeah i think
 

1381
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,630
yeah i think
the the big picture is that

1382
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:50,640
the the big picture is that
 

1383
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,710
the the big picture is that
the things that can kill your minority

1384
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:52,720
the things that can kill your minority
 

1385
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,549
the things that can kill your minority
of everything that's out there and we're

1386
00:23:54,549 --> 00:23:54,559
of everything that's out there and we're
 

1387
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,310
of everything that's out there and we're
talking about

1388
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:56,320
talking about
 

1389
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,950
talking about
molecules so we have in us

1390
00:23:58,950 --> 00:23:58,960
molecules so we have in us
 

1391
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,230
molecules so we have in us
proteins that can kill us yeah prions

1392
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:02,240
proteins that can kill us yeah prions
 

1393
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,430
proteins that can kill us yeah prions
that are just

1394
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:03,440
that are just
 

1395
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,590
that are just
it's a protein in us and if it misfolds

1396
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:05,600
it's a protein in us and if it misfolds
 

1397
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,750
it's a protein in us and if it misfolds
it makes all of its other

1398
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:07,760
it makes all of its other
 

1399
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,830
it makes all of its other
copies misfold and then you you die of a

1400
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:09,840
copies misfold and then you you die of a
 

1401
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,149
copies misfold and then you you die of a
neurological disease yeah that's pretty

1402
00:24:12,149 --> 00:24:12,159
neurological disease yeah that's pretty
 

1403
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,190
neurological disease yeah that's pretty
rare

1404
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:13,200
rare
 

1405
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,789
rare
um so there are proteins there are

1406
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:14,799
um so there are proteins there are
 

1407
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,310
um so there are proteins there are
viruses

1408
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:16,320
viruses
 

1409
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,710
viruses
and as i said only certain ones

1410
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:18,720
and as i said only certain ones
 

1411
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,230
and as i said only certain ones
can kill us

1412
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:20,240
can kill us
 

1413
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,470
can kill us
but even though if we get those from

1414
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:22,480
but even though if we get those from
 

1415
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,630
but even though if we get those from
animals it's not straightforward if you

1416
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:24,640
animals it's not straightforward if you
 

1417
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,430
animals it's not straightforward if you
look at sarsko v2 right this is probably

1418
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:27,440
look at sarsko v2 right this is probably
 

1419
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,990
look at sarsko v2 right this is probably
a once in a hundred year pandemic i

1420
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:30,000
a once in a hundred year pandemic i
 

1421
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,029
a once in a hundred year pandemic i
would say

1422
00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:31,039
would say
 

1423
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,510
would say
equivalent to 1918

1424
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:33,520
equivalent to 1918
 

1425
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,350
equivalent to 1918
in its devastation and in between there

1426
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:35,360
in its devastation and in between there
 

1427
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,950
in its devastation and in between there
have been smaller pandemics of other

1428
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:36,960
have been smaller pandemics of other
 

1429
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,029
have been smaller pandemics of other
other viruses but it doesn't happen all

1430
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:39,039
other viruses but it doesn't happen all
 

1431
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,549
other viruses but it doesn't happen all
that often so we have a lot of viruses

1432
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:40,559
that often so we have a lot of viruses
 

1433
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,390
that often so we have a lot of viruses
we have a lot of bacteria

1434
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:42,400
we have a lot of bacteria
 

1435
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,310
we have a lot of bacteria
of various sorts that can cause

1436
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:44,320
of various sorts that can cause
 

1437
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,590
of various sorts that can cause
infections in us and there's this it's a

1438
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:47,600
infections in us and there's this it's a
 

1439
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,390
infections in us and there's this it's a
limited number right your streptococci

1440
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:50,400
limited number right your streptococci
 

1441
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,789
limited number right your streptococci
and staphylococci and clostridium we

1442
00:24:52,789 --> 00:24:52,799
and staphylococci and clostridium we
 

1443
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,870
and staphylococci and clostridium we
could go on and on but

1444
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:54,880
could go on and on but
 

1445
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,710
could go on and on but
we know how to handle those as long as

1446
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:56,720
we know how to handle those as long as
 

1447
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,789
we know how to handle those as long as
we have antimicrobials it's just that we

1448
00:24:58,789 --> 00:24:58,799
we have antimicrobials it's just that we
 

1449
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,870
we have antimicrobials it's just that we
abuse them and we get resistance so that

1450
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:00,880
abuse them and we get resistance so that
 

1451
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,990
abuse them and we get resistance so that
can be a problem then we have fungi

1452
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:04,000
can be a problem then we have fungi
 

1453
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,310
can be a problem then we have fungi
not mushrooms but much smaller fungi

1454
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:06,320
not mushrooms but much smaller fungi
 

1455
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,269
not mushrooms but much smaller fungi
that

1456
00:25:07,269 --> 00:25:07,279
that
 

1457
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:10,310
that
multiply submicroscopic or just at the

1458
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:10,320
multiply submicroscopic or just at the
 

1459
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,310
multiply submicroscopic or just at the
microscopic level they can

1460
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:12,320
microscopic level they can
 

1461
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,909
microscopic level they can
you know in dry climates of the u.s you

1462
00:25:13,909 --> 00:25:13,919
you know in dry climates of the u.s you
 

1463
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,430
you know in dry climates of the u.s you
can inhale their spores and they can

1464
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:15,440
can inhale their spores and they can
 

1465
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,470
can inhale their spores and they can
grow in your lung if you're

1466
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:16,480
grow in your lung if you're
 

1467
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,190
grow in your lung if you're
immunosuppressed and so forth so those

1468
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:19,200
immunosuppressed and so forth so those
 

1469
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,230

00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,230
are
the tiny guys and then we have parasites

1472
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:22,240
the tiny guys and then we have parasites
 

1473
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,950
the tiny guys and then we have parasites
which we we do this week in parasitism

1474
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:24,960
which we we do this week in parasitism
 

1475
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,909
which we we do this week in parasitism
where

1476
00:25:25,909 --> 00:25:25,919
where
 

1477
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,070
where
single cells even worms of various sorts

1478
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:30,080
single cells even worms of various sorts
 

1479
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,630
single cells even worms of various sorts
can invade you and cause all sorts of

1480
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:32,640
can invade you and cause all sorts of
 

1481
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,669
can invade you and cause all sorts of
problems

1482
00:25:33,669 --> 00:25:33,679
problems
 

1483
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,830
problems
how um i was like kind of terrified to

1484
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:35,840
how um i was like kind of terrified to
 

1485
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,390
how um i was like kind of terrified to
listen to that podcast what uh what's it

1486
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:38,400
listen to that podcast what uh what's it
 

1487
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,310
listen to that podcast what uh what's it
like

1488
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:40,320
like
 

1489
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,390
like
i mean what you learn is that

1490
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:44,400
i mean what you learn is that
 

1491
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,470
i mean what you learn is that
you can you travel somewhere and you can

1492
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:46,480
you can you travel somewhere and you can
 

1493
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,630
you can you travel somewhere and you can
get infected and bring it back home yes

1494
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:48,640
get infected and bring it back home yes
 

1495
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,950
get infected and bring it back home yes
here in the us we do have

1496
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:50,960
here in the us we do have
 

1497
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,510
here in the us we do have
certain kinds of parasites but

1498
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:53,520
certain kinds of parasites but
 

1499
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,830
certain kinds of parasites but
because of our lifestyle we more or less

1500
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:55,840
because of our lifestyle we more or less
 

1501
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,830
because of our lifestyle we more or less
have avoided them for example there is a

1502
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:57,840
have avoided them for example there is a
 

1503
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,470
have avoided them for example there is a
parasite called toxoplasma

1504
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:00,480
parasite called toxoplasma
 

1505
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,269
parasite called toxoplasma
which

1506
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:01,279
which
 

1507
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,029
which
has is infected most of the world

1508
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:03,039
has is infected most of the world
 

1509
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:05,029
has is infected most of the world
actually because a lot of people like to

1510
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:05,039
actually because a lot of people like to
 

1511
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,510
actually because a lot of people like to
eat raw meat and you would get it from

1512
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:07,520
eat raw meat and you would get it from
 

1513
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,190
eat raw meat and you would get it from
from raw meat and

1514
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:09,200
from raw meat and
 

1515
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,870
from raw meat and
we're not as fond of that here in the

1516
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:10,880
we're not as fond of that here in the
 

1517
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,149
we're not as fond of that here in the
u.s

1518
00:26:12,149 --> 00:26:12,159
u.s
 

1519
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:13,669
u.s
we like to cook our meat but that could

1520
00:26:13,669 --> 00:26:13,679
we like to cook our meat but that could
 

1521
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,430
we like to cook our meat but that could
be a consequence of

1522
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:15,440
be a consequence of
 

1523
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,350
be a consequence of
eating raw meat is that what leads to

1524
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:17,360
eating raw meat is that what leads to
 

1525
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,750
eating raw meat is that what leads to
what is it called taxoplasmosis

1526
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:19,760
what is it called taxoplasmosis
 

1527
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,190
what is it called taxoplasmosis
yeah so toxoplasmosis

1528
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:23,200

 

1529
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,510

it's mainly

1530
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:25,520
it's mainly
 

1531
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,350
it's mainly
a big issue is if you're pregnant and

1532
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:27,360
a big issue is if you're pregnant and
 

1533
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,750
a big issue is if you're pregnant and
you get toxo then your fetus is going to

1534
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:29,760
you get toxo then your fetus is going to
 

1535
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,870
you get toxo then your fetus is going to
be

1536
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:30,880
be
 

1537
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,110
be
very badly malformed it's going to have

1538
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:33,120
very badly malformed it's going to have
 

1539
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,230
very badly malformed it's going to have
brain defects and so forth

1540
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:36,240
brain defects and so forth
 

1541
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,029
brain defects and so forth
and

1542
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:37,039
and
 

1543
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,350
and
animals can get it as well

1544
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:39,360
animals can get it as well
 

1545
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,870
animals can get it as well
so there are a lot of parasites of that

1546
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:40,880
so there are a lot of parasites of that
 

1547
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,190
so there are a lot of parasites of that
nature which you often acquire by food

1548
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:43,200
nature which you often acquire by food
 

1549
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,269
nature which you often acquire by food
eating food of different sorts and it

1550
00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:45,279
eating food of different sorts and it
 

1551
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,590
eating food of different sorts and it
usually happens elsewhere we just on

1552
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:47,600
usually happens elsewhere we just on
 

1553
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,909
usually happens elsewhere we just on
this week in parasitism we do

1554
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:49,919
this week in parasitism we do
 

1555
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,669
this week in parasitism we do
a case so daniel griffin is a resident

1556
00:26:53,669 --> 00:26:53,679
a case so daniel griffin is a resident
 

1557
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,750
a case so daniel griffin is a resident
physician he's a doctor a real doctor

1558
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:55,760
physician he's a doctor a real doctor
 

1559
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,990
physician he's a doctor a real doctor
right and he every month he comes up

1560
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:58,000
right and he every month he comes up
 

1561
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,789
right and he every month he comes up
with a case okay this is a person i saw

1562
00:27:00,789 --> 00:27:00,799
with a case okay this is a person i saw
 

1563
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,190
with a case okay this is a person i saw
and last month this young lady had

1564
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:03,200
and last month this young lady had
 

1565
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,950
and last month this young lady had
traveled somewhere

1566
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:04,960
traveled somewhere
 

1567
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,630
traveled somewhere
and

1568
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:06,640
and
 

1569
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,149
and
she ate

1570
00:27:08,149 --> 00:27:08,159
she ate
 

1571
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,430
she ate
raw fish

1572
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:09,440
raw fish
 

1573
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,110
raw fish
she was just somewhere southeast asia or

1574
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:11,120
she was just somewhere southeast asia or
 

1575
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,430
she was just somewhere southeast asia or
something and she ended up with

1576
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:13,440
something and she ended up with
 

1577
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,909
something and she ended up with
with with red bumps all over her skin it

1578
00:27:15,909 --> 00:27:15,919
with with red bumps all over her skin it
 

1579
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,669
with with red bumps all over her skin it
turned out was a parasite from the fish

1580
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:17,679
turned out was a parasite from the fish
 

1581
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,149
turned out was a parasite from the fish
that moved around in her and and they're

1582
00:27:20,149 --> 00:27:20,159
that moved around in her and and they're
 

1583
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,669
that moved around in her and and they're
very easy to cure

1584
00:27:21,669 --> 00:27:21,679
very easy to cure
 

1585
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,029
very easy to cure
we have you have to write doctors and

1586
00:27:23,029 --> 00:27:23,039
we have you have to write doctors and
 

1587
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,549
we have you have to write doctors and
the right drugs you can cure all these

1588
00:27:24,549 --> 00:27:24,559
the right drugs you can cure all these
 

1589
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,110
the right drugs you can cure all these
what about diagnose like connect the red

1590
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:27,120
what about diagnose like connect the red
 

1591
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,630
what about diagnose like connect the red
spots to the fact that it's a parasite

1592
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:28,640
spots to the fact that it's a parasite
 

1593
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,470
spots to the fact that it's a parasite
it's very easy to if you have the right

1594
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:30,480
it's very easy to if you have the right
 

1595
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,310
it's very easy to if you have the right
diagnostics now daniel often goes to

1596
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:32,320
diagnostics now daniel often goes to
 

1597
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,590
diagnostics now daniel often goes to
parts of the world where they don't have

1598
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:33,600
parts of the world where they don't have
 

1599
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,830
parts of the world where they don't have
diagnostics and he has to

1600
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:35,840
diagnostics and he has to
 

1601
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,830
diagnostics and he has to
use other mechanisms he may have to take

1602
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:37,840
use other mechanisms he may have to take
 

1603
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,230
use other mechanisms he may have to take
a bit and look at it under a microscope

1604
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:40,240
a bit and look at it under a microscope
 

1605
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,590
a bit and look at it under a microscope
and then he may not be able to get the

1606
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:41,600
and then he may not be able to get the
 

1607
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,669
and then he may not be able to get the
drug depending on where he is

1608
00:27:43,669 --> 00:27:43,679
drug depending on where he is
 

1609
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,669
drug depending on where he is
but if these but often he sees patients

1610
00:27:45,669 --> 00:27:45,679
but if these but often he sees patients
 

1611
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,430
but if these but often he sees patients
who come back to the us and they get

1612
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:47,440
who come back to the us and they get
 

1613
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,750
who come back to the us and they get
diarrhea or they have a fever and he

1614
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:49,760
diarrhea or they have a fever and he
 

1615
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,190
diarrhea or they have a fever and he
said where have you been and he can put

1616
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:51,200
said where have you been and he can put
 

1617
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,870
said where have you been and he can put
two and two together and so we let our

1618
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:52,880
two and two together and so we let our
 

1619
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,630
two and two together and so we let our
listeners do that and they all send in

1620
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:54,640
listeners do that and they all send in
 

1621
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,190
listeners do that and they all send in
guesses and it's wonderful to hear them

1622
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:57,200
guesses and it's wonderful to hear them
 

1623
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,310
guesses and it's wonderful to hear them
go through this so there are a lot of

1624
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:58,320
go through this so there are a lot of
 

1625
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,230
go through this so there are a lot of
parasites puzzle and solvent that can

1626
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:00,240
parasites puzzle and solvent that can
 

1627
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,830
parasites puzzle and solvent that can
get you you have to be careful about

1628
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:01,840
get you you have to be careful about
 

1629
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,990
get you you have to be careful about
eating when you go overseas and water

00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:49,760
should worry about it that's what daniel
 

1791
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,750
should worry about it that's what daniel
would say let's return to the basics

1792
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:51,760
would say let's return to the basics
 

1793
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,190
would say let's return to the basics
we're gonna jump around all over the

1794
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:53,200
we're gonna jump around all over the
 

1795
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,870
we're gonna jump around all over the
place

1796
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:54,880
place
 

1797
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,430
place
what are the basic principles of

1798
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:57,440
what are the basic principles of
 

1799
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,029
what are the basic principles of
virology maybe a good place to start is

1800
00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:01,039
virology maybe a good place to start is
 

1801
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,990
virology maybe a good place to start is
what is a virus that's great i mean i

1802
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:04,000
what is a virus that's great i mean i
 

1803
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,750
what is a virus that's great i mean i
talk in my first lecture for 20 minutes

1804
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:05,760
talk in my first lecture for 20 minutes
 

1805
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,430
talk in my first lecture for 20 minutes
before i get to that

1806
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:07,440
before i get to that
 

1807
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,750
before i get to that
but and i wonder if i should put it up

1808
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:09,760
but and i wonder if i should put it up
 

1809
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,350
but and i wonder if i should put it up
front but it's kind of a boring

1810
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:11,360
front but it's kind of a boring
 

1811
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,590
front but it's kind of a boring
definition so if you do that first

1812
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:13,600
definition so if you do that first
 

1813
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,669
definition so if you do that first
people will turn off so first you tell

1814
00:31:15,669 --> 00:31:15,679
people will turn off so first you tell
 

1815
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,509
people will turn off so first you tell
them about all the millions and billions

1816
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:17,519
them about all the millions and billions
 

1817
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,549
them about all the millions and billions
of viruses around so a virus we have a

1818
00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:20,559
of viruses around so a virus we have a
 

1819
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,549
of viruses around so a virus we have a
very specific definition

1820
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:22,559
very specific definition
 

1821
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:23,990
very specific definition
because it's different from everything

1822
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:24,000
because it's different from everything
 

1823
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,750
because it's different from everything
else on the planet

1824
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:25,760
else on the planet
 

1825
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,870
else on the planet
um because first of all it's a parasite

1826
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:28,880
um because first of all it's a parasite
 

1827
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,710
um because first of all it's a parasite
it takes a parasite means you take

1828
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:30,720
it takes a parasite means you take
 

1829
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,990
it takes a parasite means you take
something from someone else you know we

1830
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:34,000
something from someone else you know we
 

1831
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,909
something from someone else you know we
have human parasites who take money from

1832
00:31:35,909 --> 00:31:35,919
have human parasites who take money from
 

1833
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,950
have human parasites who take money from
others right but in biological terms

1834
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:38,960
others right but in biological terms
 

1835
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,830
others right but in biological terms
a parasite takes something from the host

1836
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:41,840
a parasite takes something from the host
 

1837
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,149
a parasite takes something from the host
that the host would otherwise use energy

1838
00:31:44,149 --> 00:31:44,159
that the host would otherwise use energy
 

1839
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,149
that the host would otherwise use energy
or some building block or something

1840
00:31:46,149 --> 00:31:46,159
or some building block or something
 

1841
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:47,750
or some building block or something
there's never really a symbiotic

1842
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:47,760
there's never really a symbiotic
 

1843
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,310
there's never really a symbiotic
relationship between a virus and a host

1844
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:50,320
relationship between a virus and a host
 

1845
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,470
relationship between a virus and a host
well there there can be so that's the

1846
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:52,480
well there there can be so that's the
 

1847
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,549
well there there can be so that's the
dichotomy i think is that we define them

1848
00:31:54,549 --> 00:31:54,559
dichotomy i think is that we define them
 

1849
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:58,070
dichotomy i think is that we define them
as parasites yet i just told you 20

1850
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:58,080
as parasites yet i just told you 20
 

1851
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,750
as parasites yet i just told you 20
minutes ago that many viruses are

1852
00:31:59,750 --> 00:31:59,760
minutes ago that many viruses are
 

1853
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,430
minutes ago that many viruses are
probably beneficial

1854
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:01,440
probably beneficial
 

1855
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,870
probably beneficial
so i think

1856
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:02,880
so i think
 

1857
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,470
so i think
what it means is we at some point we're

1858
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:04,480
what it means is we at some point we're
 

1859
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,389
what it means is we at some point we're
going to have to change our definition

1860
00:32:06,389 --> 00:32:06,399
going to have to change our definition
 

1861
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,470
going to have to change our definition
right because

1862
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:08,480
right because
 

1863
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,110
right because
after all definitions we make are just

1864
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:11,120
after all definitions we make are just
 

1865
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,750
after all definitions we make are just
constructs that make it easier for us to

1866
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:13,760
constructs that make it easier for us to
 

1867
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,750
constructs that make it easier for us to
study that not necessarily represent

1868
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:15,760
study that not necessarily represent
 

1869
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,230
study that not necessarily represent
what's right yeah right like uh like

1870
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:18,240
what's right yeah right like uh like
 

1871
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,710
what's right yeah right like uh like
pluto was a planet at first and now it's

1872
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:20,720
pluto was a planet at first and now it's
 

1873
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,310
pluto was a planet at first and now it's
not a planet anymore and a lot of people

1874
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:22,320
not a planet anymore and a lot of people
 

1875
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,230
not a planet anymore and a lot of people
are very upset but it's only according

1876
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:24,240
are very upset but it's only according
 

1877
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,310
are very upset but it's only according
to us there may be another race living

1878
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:26,320
to us there may be another race living
 

1879
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,070
to us there may be another race living
somewhere else who thinks it's a planet

1880
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:28,080
somewhere else who thinks it's a planet
 

1881
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,830
somewhere else who thinks it's a planet
right well maybe that's why viruses are

1882
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:29,840
right well maybe that's why viruses are
 

1883
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,590
right well maybe that's why viruses are
attacking humans they're very angry they

1884
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:31,600
attacking humans they're very angry they
 

1885
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,269
attacking humans they're very angry they
weren't uh calling them parasites so

1886
00:32:35,269 --> 00:32:35,279
weren't uh calling them parasites so
 

1887
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:36,630
weren't uh calling them parasites so
right now our definition includes

1888
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:36,640
right now our definition includes
 

1889
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,909
right now our definition includes
parasite

1890
00:32:37,909 --> 00:32:37,919
parasite
 

1891
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,990
parasite
because a virus cannot do anything

1892
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:40,000
because a virus cannot do anything
 

1893
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,269
because a virus cannot do anything
without a cell

1894
00:32:41,269 --> 00:32:41,279
without a cell
 

1895
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,070
without a cell
if i if this mug were full of viruses it

1896
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:44,080
if i if this mug were full of viruses it
 

1897
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,590
if i if this mug were full of viruses it
would not do anything

1898
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:45,600
would not do anything
 

1899
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,509
would not do anything
for years it would eventually probably

1900
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:47,519
for years it would eventually probably
 

1901
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,509
for years it would eventually probably
lose its infectivity but it's not going

1902
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:49,519
lose its infectivity but it's not going
 

1903
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,909
lose its infectivity but it's not going
to reproduce here it needs cells

1904
00:32:51,909 --> 00:32:51,919
to reproduce here it needs cells
 

1905
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,269
to reproduce here it needs cells
and you know to the first people who

1906
00:32:53,269 --> 00:32:53,279
and you know to the first people who
 

1907
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,029
and you know to the first people who
discovered viruses that was astounding

1908
00:32:55,029 --> 00:32:55,039
discovered viruses that was astounding
 

1909
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,750
discovered viruses that was astounding
that they didn't just reproduce divide

1910
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:57,760
that they didn't just reproduce divide
 

1911
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,630
that they didn't just reproduce divide
on their own like bacteria so a virus

1912
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:00,640
on their own like bacteria so a virus
 

1913
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,630
on their own like bacteria so a virus
needs to get inside of a cell

1914
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:02,640
needs to get inside of a cell
 

1915
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,470
needs to get inside of a cell
inside the cell it can't just hang

1916
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:04,480
inside the cell it can't just hang
 

1917
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,190
inside the cell it can't just hang
around on the surface it needs to get in

1918
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:07,200
around on the surface it needs to get in
 

1919
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,430
around on the surface it needs to get in
in order to make more of itself and so

1920
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:09,440
in order to make more of itself and so
 

1921
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,990
in order to make more of itself and so
we call it an obligate intracellular

1922
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:12,000
we call it an obligate intracellular
 

1923
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,389
we call it an obligate intracellular
parasite because it needs to get in a

1924
00:33:14,389 --> 00:33:14,399
parasite because it needs to get in a
 

1925
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,630
parasite because it needs to get in a
cell and then it takes things

1926
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:16,640
cell and then it takes things
 

1927
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,310
cell and then it takes things
from the cell in the form of all kinds

1928
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:18,320
from the cell in the form of all kinds
 

1929
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,710
from the cell in the form of all kinds
of molecules and processes and energy

1930
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:20,720
of molecules and processes and energy
 

1931
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,509
of molecules and processes and energy
and so forth to make new viruses

1932
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:23,519
and so forth to make new viruses
 

1933
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,430
and so forth to make new viruses
obligate means it's obligated to be

1934
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:25,440
obligate means it's obligated to be
 

1935
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,070
obligate means it's obligated to be
inside the cell absolutely it will not

1936
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:28,080
inside the cell absolutely it will not
 

1937
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,789
inside the cell absolutely it will not
reproduce outside of the cell so this

1938
00:33:32,789 --> 00:33:32,799
reproduce outside of the cell so this
 

1939
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,430
reproduce outside of the cell so this
mug of viruses is can in no way be

1940
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:35,440
mug of viruses is can in no way be
 

1941
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,750
mug of viruses is can in no way be
living in my opinion however once it

1942
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:37,760
living in my opinion however once it
 

1943
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,070
living in my opinion however once it
gets inside of a cell now the cell is a

1944
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:40,080
gets inside of a cell now the cell is a
 

1945
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,789
gets inside of a cell now the cell is a
virus infected cell it's alive so a

1946
00:33:42,789 --> 00:33:42,799
virus infected cell it's alive so a
 

1947
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:45,269
virus infected cell it's alive so a
virus in my view has two phases right

1948
00:33:45,269 --> 00:33:45,279
virus in my view has two phases right
 

1949
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,070
virus in my view has two phases right
it's this non-living particulate phase

1950
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:48,080
it's this non-living particulate phase
 

1951
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,990
it's this non-living particulate phase
that everyone is used to

1952
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:50,000
that everyone is used to
 

1953
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,990
that everyone is used to
yeah i'll send you you need a virus for

1954
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:52,000
yeah i'll send you you need a virus for
 

1955
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,549
yeah i'll send you you need a virus for
your table i'll send you a nice model i

1956
00:33:54,549 --> 00:33:54,559
your table i'll send you a nice model i
 

1957
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,070
your table i'll send you a nice model i
think it would look good here yes you

1958
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:56,080
think it would look good here yes you
 

1959
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,669
think it would look good here yes you
have to go with all this other stuff

1960
00:33:57,669 --> 00:33:57,679
have to go with all this other stuff
 

1961
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:59,430
have to go with all this other stuff
yeah well these are all mechanical

1962
00:33:59,430 --> 00:33:59,440
yeah well these are all mechanical
 

1963
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,590
yeah well these are all mechanical
there's no biology here so you wouldn't

1964
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:01,600
there's no biology here so you wouldn't
 

1965
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,430
there's no biology here so you wouldn't
want a virus here no i'd want to buy of

1966
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:03,440
want a virus here no i'd want to buy of
 

1967
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,350
want a virus here no i'd want to buy of
course i'll send you one and look at

1968
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:05,360
course i'll send you one and look at
 

1969
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,269
course i'll send you one and look at
that you can look at it because now that

1970
00:34:07,269 --> 00:34:07,279
that you can look at it because now that
 

1971
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,909
that you can look at it because now that
we have the three-dimensional structures

1972
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:09,919
we have the three-dimensional structures
 

1973
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:12,790
we have the three-dimensional structures
solved by structural biologists we take

1974
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:12,800
solved by structural biologists we take
 

1975
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,310
solved by structural biologists we take
the coordinates so we put it in a 3d

1976
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:14,320
the coordinates so we put it in a 3d
 

1977
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,310
the coordinates so we put it in a 3d
printer and you can make amazing models

1978
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:16,320
printer and you can make amazing models
 

1979
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,909
printer and you can make amazing models
right

1980
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:17,919
right
 

1981
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:19,750
right
of any virus and so there's a huge

1982
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:19,760
of any virus and so there's a huge
 

1983
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,790
of any virus and so there's a huge
variety of viruses huge that we know of

1984
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:22,800
variety of viruses huge that we know of
 

1985
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,389
variety of viruses huge that we know of
yeah which is only a fraction of what's

1986
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:24,399
yeah which is only a fraction of what's
 

1987
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:25,829
yeah which is only a fraction of what's
out there what's the categories so

1988
00:34:25,829 --> 00:34:25,839
out there what's the categories so
 

1989
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:27,990
out there what's the categories so
there's rna there's dna viruses what

1990
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:28,000
there's rna there's dna viruses what
 

1991
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,869
there's rna there's dna viruses what
what are those what's dna and rna two

1992
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:30,879
what are those what's dna and rna two
 

1993
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:32,470
what are those what's dna and rna two
two

1994
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:32,480
two
 

1995
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,589
two
broad categorizations rna and these are

1996
00:34:35,589 --> 00:34:35,599
broad categorizations rna and these are
 

1997
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,829
broad categorizations rna and these are
genetic material it can be two different

1998
00:34:37,829 --> 00:34:37,839
genetic material it can be two different
 

1999
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:39,109
genetic material it can be two different
chemicals

2000
00:34:39,109 --> 00:34:39,119
chemicals
 

2001
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,629
chemicals
so rna

2002
00:34:40,629 --> 00:34:40,639
so rna
 

2003
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,470
so rna
everything else on the planet besides

2004
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:42,480
everything else on the planet besides
 

2005
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,550
everything else on the planet besides
viruses is all dna based you and i are

2006
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:44,560
viruses is all dna based you and i are
 

2007
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,550
viruses is all dna based you and i are
dna based everything on the planet today

2008
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:46,560
dna based everything on the planet today
 

2009
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,349
dna based everything on the planet today
is dna based except some viruses are rna

2010
00:34:49,349 --> 00:34:49,359
is dna based except some viruses are rna
 

2011
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:51,510
is dna based except some viruses are rna
based and that's because

2012
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:51,520
based and that's because
 

2013
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,470
based and that's because
as i mentioned earlier the first

2014
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:54,480
as i mentioned earlier the first
 

2015
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,230
as i mentioned earlier the first
life that arose on the planet was

2016
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:56,240
life that arose on the planet was
 

2017
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,910
life that arose on the planet was
rna-based yeah so these are like

2018
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:57,920
rna-based yeah so these are like
 

2019
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,069
rna-based yeah so these are like
old-school viruses they're old-school

2020
00:35:00,069 --> 00:35:00,079
old-school viruses they're old-school
 

2021
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,550
old-school viruses they're old-school
these are we call relics yeah they're

2022
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:02,560
these are we call relics yeah they're
 

2023
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,630
these are we call relics yeah they're
relics and this has got a name it's

2024
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:04,640
relics and this has got a name it's
 

2025
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,230
relics and this has got a name it's
called the rna world which i think is

2026
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:06,240
called the rna world which i think is
 

2027
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,390
called the rna world which i think is
great is it big still or they are the

2028
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:08,400
great is it big still or they are the
 

2029
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,790
great is it big still or they are the
relics dying out oh no the relics in my

2030
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:10,800
relics dying out oh no the relics in my
 

2031
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,589
relics dying out oh no the relics in my
opinion are the most successful viruses

2032
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:13,599
opinion are the most successful viruses
 

2033
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:15,910
opinion are the most successful viruses
the rna viruses and the source cov2 is

2034
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:15,920
the rna viruses and the source cov2 is
 

2035
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,510
the rna viruses and the source cov2 is
an rna virus we can talk about why

2036
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:17,520
an rna virus we can talk about why
 

2037
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,910
an rna virus we can talk about why
they're so successful but you have

2038
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:19,920
they're so successful but you have
 

2039
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,630
they're so successful but you have
broadly speaking viruses with rna

2040
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:22,640
broadly speaking viruses with rna
 

2041
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,870
broadly speaking viruses with rna
genetic information which are relics

2042
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:24,880
genetic information which are relics
 

2043
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,630
genetic information which are relics
of course they're contemporary they have

2044
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:26,640
of course they're contemporary they have
 

2045
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,790
of course they're contemporary they have
adapted to the modern world

2046
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:28,800
adapted to the modern world
 

2047
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,030
adapted to the modern world
and the modern organisms living in it

2048
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:31,040
and the modern organisms living in it
 

2049
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,270
and the modern organisms living in it
and then we have dna based viruses which

2050
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:33,280
and then we have dna based viruses which
 

2051
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,430
and then we have dna based viruses which
are extremely conservative

2052
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:35,440
are extremely conservative
 

2053
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,510
are extremely conservative
and slow they're very successful you

2054
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:37,520
and slow they're very successful you
 

2055
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,109
and slow they're very successful you
know everyone has a herpes virus

2056
00:35:39,109 --> 00:35:39,119
know everyone has a herpes virus
 

2057
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:40,710
know everyone has a herpes virus
infection but

2058
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:40,720
infection but
 

2059
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,510
infection but
they

2060
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:41,520
they
 

2061
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,270
they
they don't get the news like the rna

2062
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:43,280
they don't get the news like the rna
 

2063
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,069
they don't get the news like the rna
viruses do the hivs and the influenza

2064
00:35:46,069 --> 00:35:46,079
viruses do the hivs and the influenza
 

2065
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,950
viruses do the hivs and the influenza
viruses and the um sars coronaviruses

2066
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:48,960
viruses and the um sars coronaviruses
 

2067
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,990
viruses and the um sars coronaviruses
they get all the press and they're

2068
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:50,000
they get all the press and they're
 

2069
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,790
they get all the press and they're
rna-based because rna lets you change

2070
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:52,800
rna-based because rna lets you change
 

2071
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,589
rna-based because rna lets you change
more so than dna so they they've evolved

2072
00:35:55,589 --> 00:35:55,599
more so than dna so they they've evolved
 

2073
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:58,470
more so than dna so they they've evolved
much faster rna viruses much faster and

2074
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:58,480
much faster rna viruses much faster and
 

2075
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,270
much faster rna viruses much faster and
in fact when i i have an electron

2076
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:01,280
in fact when i i have an electron
 

2077
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,470
in fact when i i have an electron
evolution i don't know if you've

2078
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:02,480
evolution i don't know if you've
 

2079
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,390
evolution i don't know if you've
listened to that one you should it's

2080
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:04,400
listened to that one you should it's
 

2081
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,670
listened to that one you should it's
really i think it's really interesting

2082
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:07,680
really i think it's really interesting
 

2083
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,069
really i think it's really interesting
rna viruses exist

2084
00:36:10,069 --> 00:36:10,079
rna viruses exist

00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:11,190
rna viruses exist

and we know this we can do an experiment

2104
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:29,920
and we know this we can do an experiment
 

2105
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,069
and we know this we can do an experiment
to find that out now why that is is a

2106
00:36:32,069 --> 00:36:32,079
to find that out now why that is is a
 

2107
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,510
to find that out now why that is is a
good question

2108
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:33,520
good question
 

2109
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,349
good question
but uh

2110
00:36:35,349 --> 00:36:35,359
but uh
 

2111
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,150
but uh
that's that's the reason why rna viruses

2112
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:38,160
that's that's the reason why rna viruses
 

2113
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,470
that's that's the reason why rna viruses
are far more successful they infect many

2114
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:40,480
are far more successful they infect many
 

2115
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,430
are far more successful they infect many
more hosts and they're very i would say

2116
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:43,440
more hosts and they're very i would say
 

2117
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,990
more hosts and they're very i would say
slippery they can change hosts really

2118
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:46,000
slippery they can change hosts really
 

2119
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,390
slippery they can change hosts really
quickly because in any animal harboring

2120
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:48,400
quickly because in any animal harboring
 

2121
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,310
quickly because in any animal harboring
an rna virus

2122
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:50,320
an rna virus
 

2123
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,150
an rna virus
like let's say a bat in some cave

2124
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:52,160
like let's say a bat in some cave
 

2125
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,109
like let's say a bat in some cave
somewhere it's not just one genome it's

2126
00:36:55,109 --> 00:36:55,119
somewhere it's not just one genome it's
 

2127
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,190
somewhere it's not just one genome it's
it's millions of different genomes of

2128
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:57,200
it's millions of different genomes of
 

2129
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:57,990
it's millions of different genomes of
all

2130
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:58,000
all
 

2131
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,910
all
kinds with all within the framework of

2132
00:36:59,910 --> 00:36:59,920
kinds with all within the framework of
 

2133
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,750
kinds with all within the framework of
say coronavirus but they're all

2134
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:01,760
say coronavirus but they're all
 

2135
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,069
say coronavirus but they're all
different and one genome in there might

2136
00:37:04,069 --> 00:37:04,079
different and one genome in there might
 

2137
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,470
different and one genome in there might
just be right for infecting a person if

2138
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:06,480
just be right for infecting a person if
 

2139
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,310
just be right for infecting a person if
it ever encountered that person i mean

2140
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:08,320
it ever encountered that person i mean
 

2141
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,829
it ever encountered that person i mean
that's the thing that well there could

2142
00:37:09,829 --> 00:37:09,839
that's the thing that well there could
 

2143
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,829
that's the thing that well there could
be a large number this is a tiny

2144
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:11,839
be a large number this is a tiny
 

2145
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:14,230
be a large number this is a tiny
fraction but a large number of uh of

2146
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:14,240
fraction but a large number of uh of
 

2147
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,150
fraction but a large number of uh of
them and they're all operating at the at

2148
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:16,160
them and they're all operating at the at
 

2149
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,510
them and they're all operating at the at
the threshold of

2150
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:17,520
the threshold of
 

2151
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,870
the threshold of
error that's right that's fascinating

2152
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:18,880
error that's right that's fascinating
 

2153
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,710
error that's right that's fascinating
it's like a little like uh it's like

2154
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:20,720
it's like a little like uh it's like
 

2155
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,190
it's like a little like uh it's like
startups little entrepreneurs like a

2156
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:23,200
startups little entrepreneurs like a
 

2157
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,030
startups little entrepreneurs like a
startup world yes and many of them fail

2158
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:25,040
startup world yes and many of them fail
 

2159
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,470
startup world yes and many of them fail
yeah many of the changes and then

2160
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:26,480
yeah many of the changes and then
 

2161
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,069
yeah many of the changes and then
there's the dna of ours that are like

2162
00:37:28,069 --> 00:37:28,079
there's the dna of ours that are like
 

2163
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,790
there's the dna of ours that are like
the ibm and exactly exactly big

2164
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:30,800
the ibm and exactly exactly big
 

2165
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,109
the ibm and exactly exactly big
corporations it's very good conservative

2166
00:37:33,109 --> 00:37:33,119
corporations it's very good conservative
 

2167
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:34,550
corporations it's very good conservative
with the bureaucracies and all that kind

2168
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:34,560
with the bureaucracies and all that kind
 

2169
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,230
with the bureaucracies and all that kind
of stuff so there's a lot of baggage

2170
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:36,240
of stuff so there's a lot of baggage
 

2171
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,069
of stuff so there's a lot of baggage
yeah yeah it's expensive for them to

2172
00:37:38,069 --> 00:37:38,079
yeah yeah it's expensive for them to
 

2173
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:39,990
yeah yeah it's expensive for them to
reproduce yeah and they don't move

2174
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:40,000
reproduce yeah and they don't move
 

2175
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,829
reproduce yeah and they don't move
quickly yes the rna viruses are the

2176
00:37:41,829 --> 00:37:41,839
quickly yes the rna viruses are the
 

2177
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:43,270
quickly yes the rna viruses are the
fast-moving

2178
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:43,280
fast-moving
 

2179
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,510
fast-moving
members so that's what a virus is we

2180
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:45,520
members so that's what a virus is we
 

2181
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,790
members so that's what a virus is we
call them

2182
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:46,800
call them
 

2183
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,950
call them
obligated intracellular parasites and

2184
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:48,960
obligated intracellular parasites and
 

2185
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,870
obligated intracellular parasites and
then i told you there's dna in rna but

2186
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:50,880
then i told you there's dna in rna but
 

2187
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,790
then i told you there's dna in rna but
then let's go further

2188
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:52,800
then let's go further
 

2189
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,069
then let's go further
the the nucleic acid is not naked

2190
00:37:56,069 --> 00:37:56,079
the the nucleic acid is not naked
 

2191
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:59,190
the the nucleic acid is not naked
because naked nucleic acid in the world

2192
00:37:59,190 --> 00:37:59,200
because naked nucleic acid in the world
 

2193
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,069
because naked nucleic acid in the world
isn't good i mean it it existed in the

2194
00:38:02,069 --> 00:38:02,079
isn't good i mean it it existed in the
 

2195
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,069
isn't good i mean it it existed in the
in the pre-cellular world but there

2196
00:38:04,069 --> 00:38:04,079
in the pre-cellular world but there
 

2197
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,069
in the pre-cellular world but there
probably weren't a lot of threats to it

2198
00:38:06,069 --> 00:38:06,079
probably weren't a lot of threats to it
 

2199
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:07,030
probably weren't a lot of threats to it
then

2200
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:07,040
then
 

2201
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,030
then
naked nucleic acid doesn't last long in

2202
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:09,040
naked nucleic acid doesn't last long in
 

2203
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,310
naked nucleic acid doesn't last long in
the environment so they're they're

2204
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:10,320
the environment so they're they're
 

2205
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,150
the environment so they're they're
covered the nucleic acid is covered it

2206
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:12,160
covered the nucleic acid is covered it
 

2207
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,990
covered the nucleic acid is covered it
can be covered with a protein shell a

2208
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:14,000
can be covered with a protein shell a
 

2209
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,750
can be covered with a protein shell a
pure protein shell

2210
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:15,760
pure protein shell
 

2211
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,190
pure protein shell
or it can have a membrane around it

2212
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:19,200
or it can have a membrane around it
 

2213
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,430
or it can have a membrane around it
which would be uh lipids from the host

2214
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:21,440
which would be uh lipids from the host
 

2215
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,310
which would be uh lipids from the host
cell

2216
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:22,320
cell
 

2217
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,349
cell
so

2218
00:38:23,349 --> 00:38:23,359
so
 

2219
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:26,390
so
lipids so it's a fatty membrane fatty

2220
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:26,400
lipids so it's a fatty membrane fatty
 

2221
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,710
lipids so it's a fatty membrane fatty
membrane yeah so our cells are

2222
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:28,720
membrane yeah so our cells are
 

2223
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,470
membrane yeah so our cells are
coated with fatty membranes right our

2224
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:30,480
coated with fatty membranes right our
 

2225
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,310
coated with fatty membranes right our
cells the outer plasma membrane right

2226
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:32,320
cells the outer plasma membrane right
 

2227
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,310
cells the outer plasma membrane right
that's the same viruses can be too so

2228
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:34,320
that's the same viruses can be too so
 

2229
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,150
that's the same viruses can be too so
they're kind of like cells but without

2230
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:36,160
they're kind of like cells but without
 

2231
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,230
they're kind of like cells but without
the ability to do the mitochondria stuff

2232
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:38,240
the ability to do the mitochondria stuff
 

2233
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,310
the ability to do the mitochondria stuff
some some are some they don't have

2234
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:40,320
some some are some they don't have
 

2235
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,630
some some are some they don't have
nuclei they don't have mitochondria yeah

2236
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:42,640
nuclei they don't have mitochondria yeah
 

2237
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,710
nuclei they don't have mitochondria yeah
but they do have a nucleic acid they

2238
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:44,720
but they do have a nucleic acid they
 

2239
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,630
but they do have a nucleic acid they
have a membrane and then of course there

2240
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:46,640
have a membrane and then of course there
 

2241
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,630
have a membrane and then of course there
are spikes in the membrane

2242
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:48,640
are spikes in the membrane
 

2243
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,109
are spikes in the membrane
that allow them to attach to cells

2244
00:38:51,109 --> 00:38:51,119
that allow them to attach to cells
 

2245
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,950
that allow them to attach to cells
and so that completes our two different

2246
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:52,960
and so that completes our two different
 

2247
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,470
and so that completes our two different
kinds so they have they all have like

2248
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:54,480
kinds so they have they all have like
 

2249
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,190
kinds so they have they all have like
attachment mechanisms like ways to

2250
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:57,200
attachment mechanisms like ways to
 

2251
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,270
attachment mechanisms like ways to
like keys into the into the city they

2252
00:38:59,270 --> 00:38:59,280
like keys into the into the city they
 

2253
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,630
like keys into the into the city they
all have to get into cells there are

2254
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:02,640
all have to get into cells there are
 

2255
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,870
all have to get into cells there are
there are a couple of exceptions though

2256
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:04,880
there are a couple of exceptions though
 

2257
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,310
there are a couple of exceptions though
uh there are viruses of fungi

2258
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:08,320
uh there are viruses of fungi
 

2259
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,470
uh there are viruses of fungi
uh and uh plants

2260
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:10,480
uh and uh plants
 

2261
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,550
uh and uh plants
so let's do the fungi fungi would be

2262
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:12,560
so let's do the fungi fungi would be
 

2263
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,470
so let's do the fungi fungi would be
like yeast

2264
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:14,480
like yeast
 

2265
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,910
like yeast
the virus yeast cell wall is pretty hard

2266
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:17,920
the virus yeast cell wall is pretty hard
 

2267
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,550
the virus yeast cell wall is pretty hard
to get through so viruses typically

2268
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:20,560
to get through so viruses typically
 

2269
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,630
to get through so viruses typically
don't attach to a yeast and get inside

2270
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:22,640
don't attach to a yeast and get inside
 

2271
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,310
don't attach to a yeast and get inside
rather they just live in the yeast

2272
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:24,320
rather they just live in the yeast
 

2273
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,430
rather they just live in the yeast
forever yeah and they multiply as mostly

2274
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:27,440
forever yeah and they multiply as mostly
 

2275
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,589
forever yeah and they multiply as mostly
nucleic acids and as the yeast divide

2276
00:39:29,589 --> 00:39:29,599
nucleic acids and as the yeast divide
 

2277
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,270
nucleic acids and as the yeast divide
they go into the daughter cells and

2278
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:31,280
they go into the daughter cells and
 

2279
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,990
they go into the daughter cells and
that's how they exist plant viruses also

2280
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:34,000
that's how they exist plant viruses also
 

2281
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,589
that's how they exist plant viruses also
the plant cell wall

2282
00:39:35,589 --> 00:39:35,599
the plant cell wall
 

2283
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,470
the plant cell wall
would be very hard to get across with a

2284
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:38,480
would be very hard to get across with a
 

2285
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,390
would be very hard to get across with a
by binding a protein

2286
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:40,400
by binding a protein
 

2287
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,109
by binding a protein
so plant viruses get into plants either

2288
00:39:43,109 --> 00:39:43,119
so plant viruses get into plants either
 

2289
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:44,550
so plant viruses get into plants either
by

2290
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:44,560
by
 

2291
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,190
by
pests that inject them in

2292
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:47,200
pests that inject them in
 

2293
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,870
pests that inject them in
they're sucking sap out and they inject

2294
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:48,880
they're sucking sap out and they inject
 

2295
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,030
they're sucking sap out and they inject
virus at the same time or farmers they

2296
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:51,040
virus at the same time or farmers they
 

2297
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,550
virus at the same time or farmers they
have contaminated farm equipment and

2298
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:52,560
have contaminated farm equipment and
 

2299
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,950
have contaminated farm equipment and
they roll over the plants and introduces

2300
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:54,960
they roll over the plants and introduces
 

2301
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,589
they roll over the plants and introduces
viruses so those fungi and plant viruses

2302
00:39:57,589 --> 00:39:57,599
viruses so those fungi and plant viruses
 

2303
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,069
viruses so those fungi and plant viruses
they don't have this specific receptor

2304
00:40:00,069 --> 00:40:00,079
they don't have this specific receptor
 

2305
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:01,589
they don't have this specific receptor
binding to get them into the cell but

2306
00:40:01,589 --> 00:40:01,599
binding to get them into the cell but
 

2307
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,670
binding to get them into the cell but
everything else yeah the virus binds to

2308
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:03,680
everything else yeah the virus binds to
 

2309
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,270
everything else yeah the virus binds to
something on the surface very specific

2310
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:05,280
something on the surface very specific
 

2311
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,270
something on the surface very specific
it's taken into the cell because that's

2312
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:07,280
it's taken into the cell because that's
 

2313
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,870
it's taken into the cell because that's
what cells do

2314
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:08,880
what cells do
 

2315
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,349
what cells do
when things bind their exterior

2316
00:40:11,349 --> 00:40:11,359
when things bind their exterior
 

2317
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,589
when things bind their exterior
they take it in because in most cases

2318
00:40:13,589 --> 00:40:13,599
they take it in because in most cases
 

2319
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:15,670
they take it in because in most cases
it's good it's something they need

2320
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:15,680
it's good it's something they need
 

2321
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,670
it's good it's something they need
and so the virus slips in i guess you'd

2322
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:17,680
and so the virus slips in i guess you'd
 

2323
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,430
and so the virus slips in i guess you'd
call that a trojan horse right frozen

2324
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:19,440
call that a trojan horse right frozen
 

2325
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,390
call that a trojan horse right frozen
horse it's so hard to not

2326
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:21,400
horse it's so hard to not
 

2327
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,510
horse it's so hard to not
anthropomorphize this whole thing it is

2328
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:23,520
anthropomorphize this whole thing it is
 

2329
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,910
anthropomorphize this whole thing it is
hard so obviously they don't know any of

2330
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:25,920
hard so obviously they don't know any of
 

2331
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,790
hard so obviously they don't know any of
this

2332
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:26,800
this
 

2333
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,349
this
it's not an actual trojan horse

2334
00:40:29,349 --> 00:40:29,359
it's not an actual trojan horse
 

2335
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:31,109
it's not an actual trojan horse
so that they

2336
00:40:31,109 --> 00:40:31,119
so that they
 

2337
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:32,710
so that they
they're not getting actually tricked in

2338
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:32,720
they're not getting actually tricked in
 

2339
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,550
they're not getting actually tricked in
the way humans trick each other

2340
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:34,560
the way humans trick each other
 

2341
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,309
the way humans trick each other
no it's all passive and it's just

2342
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:36,319
no it's all passive and it's just
 

2343
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:38,470
no it's all passive and it's just
through so many years of evolution it's

2344
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:38,480
through so many years of evolution it's
 

2345
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,790
through so many years of evolution it's
you select something that works

2346
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:40,800
you select something that works
 

2347
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,990
you select something that works
and

2348
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:42,000
and
 

2349
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,630
and
it continues and what survives then goes

2350
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:44,640
it continues and what survives then goes
 

2351
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,990
it continues and what survives then goes
on with the

00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:48,160
uh perhaps a slightly different approach
 

2355
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,150
uh perhaps a slightly different approach
i love this idea of past of course

2356
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:50,160
i love this idea of past of course
 

2357
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,710
i love this idea of past of course
according to sam harris uh so from a

2358
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:52,720
according to sam harris uh so from a
 

2359
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,069
according to sam harris uh so from a
sufficiently intelligent alien

civilization observing humans our
 

2363
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,150

behavior might seem passive too because

2364
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:58,160
behavior might seem passive too because
 

2365
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,150
behavior might seem passive too because
they understand fully exactly what we're

2366
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:00,160
they understand fully exactly what we're
 

2367
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,150
they understand fully exactly what we're
doing and then there's no free will and

2368
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:02,160
doing and then there's no free will and
 

2369
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,910
doing and then there's no free will and
we're all just operating in the same way

2370
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:03,920
we're all just operating in the same way
 

2371
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,829
we're all just operating in the same way
it could be a cell does which is a much

it could be a cell does which is a much
 

2373
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:07,670
it could be a cell does which is a much
higher level of complexity

00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:07,680
higher level of complexity
 

2375
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,309
higher level of complexity
yeah so i love the distinction between

2376
00:41:10,309 --> 00:41:10,319
yeah so i love the distinction between
 

2377
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:13,109
yeah so i love the distinction between
active and passive i mean the point is i

2378
00:41:13,109 --> 00:41:13,119
active and passive i mean the point is i
 

2379
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:15,109
active and passive i mean the point is i
think anthropomorphizing to a certain

2380
00:41:15,109 --> 00:41:15,119
think anthropomorphizing to a certain
 

2381
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:16,630
think anthropomorphizing to a certain
extent is fine because it helps people

2382
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:16,640
extent is fine because it helps people
 

2383
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,670
extent is fine because it helps people
understand

2384
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:17,680
understand
 

2385
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,990
understand
but when you start to say i think the

2386
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:20,000
but when you start to say i think the
 

2387
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,990
but when you start to say i think the
virus is doing that because then you're

2388
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:22,000
virus is doing that because then you're
 

2389
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,829
virus is doing that because then you're
putting a human

2390
00:41:23,829 --> 00:41:23,839
putting a human
 

2391
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:26,150
putting a human
lens on it and you may be wrong

2392
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:26,160
lens on it and you may be wrong
 

2393
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,670
lens on it and you may be wrong
yeah because you don't know why things

2394
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:27,680
yeah because you don't know why things
 

2395
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,710
yeah because you don't know why things
happen

2396
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:28,720
happen
 

2397
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,870
happen
for a virus

2398
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:30,880
for a virus
 

2399
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,270
for a virus
so right now we have variants emerging

2400
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:33,280
so right now we have variants emerging
 

2401
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,950
so right now we have variants emerging
and people say well i think it's because

2402
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:34,960
and people say well i think it's because
 

2403
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,950
and people say well i think it's because
the antibodies are selecting for

00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:36,960
the antibodies are selecting for
 

2405
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,990
the antibodies are selecting for
variants

2406
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:38,000
variants
 

2407
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,990
variants
that's a good idea but it may not be the

2408
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:40,000
that's a good idea but it may not be the
 

2409
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,750
that's a good idea but it may not be the
only thing that's going on you start

2410
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:41,760
only thing that's going on you start
 

2411
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,670
only thing that's going on you start
imagining them coming to the table

2412
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:43,680
imagining them coming to the table
 

2413
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,829
imagining them coming to the table
negotiating

2414
00:41:45,829 --> 00:41:45,839
negotiating
 

2415
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:46,630
negotiating
yeah

2416
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:46,640
yeah
 

2417
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,990
yeah
you get into trouble with that that's

2418
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:48,000
you get into trouble with that that's
 

2419
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,430
you get into trouble with that that's
right that's why i tell my students be

2420
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:49,440
right that's why i tell my students be
 

2421
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,750
right that's why i tell my students be
careful about the anthropomorphizing

2422
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:51,760
careful about the anthropomorphizing
 

2423
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,950
careful about the anthropomorphizing
because

2424
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:52,960
because
 

2425
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,349
because
you're going to apply your values to a

2426
00:41:55,349 --> 00:41:55,359
you're going to apply your values to a
 

2427
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:56,950
you're going to apply your values to a
virus and you have different value

2428
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:56,960
virus and you have different value
 

2429
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,030
virus and you have different value
you're human and you have

2430
00:41:59,030 --> 00:41:59,040
you're human and you have
 

2431
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,790
you're human and you have
what you think is the reason for this

2432
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:00,800
what you think is the reason for this
 

2433
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,390
what you think is the reason for this
outcome may not be right that's all just

2434
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:02,400
outcome may not be right that's all just
 

2435
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,470
outcome may not be right that's all just
be open-minded yeah about it in both

2436
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:04,480
be open-minded yeah about it in both
 

2437
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,470
be open-minded yeah about it in both
directions i actually one of the things

2438
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:06,480
directions i actually one of the things
 

2439
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,750
directions i actually one of the things
that push back

2440
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:07,760
that push back
 

2441
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,109
that push back
on is in in the space of robotics people

2442
00:42:11,109 --> 00:42:11,119
on is in in the space of robotics people
 

2443
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:13,190
on is in in the space of robotics people
most people in robotics try to not

2444
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:13,200
most people in robotics try to not
 

2445
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,270
most people in robotics try to not
anthropomorphize for example they don't

2446
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:15,280
anthropomorphize for example they don't
 

2447
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,589
anthropomorphize for example they don't
give a gender or a name to robots they

2448
00:42:17,589 --> 00:42:17,599
give a gender or a name to robots they
 

2449
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:20,309
give a gender or a name to robots they
really try to see it as a machine and to

2450
00:42:20,309 --> 00:42:20,319
really try to see it as a machine and to
 

2451
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:23,670
really try to see it as a machine and to
me that makes sense in one in one way

2452
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:23,680
me that makes sense in one in one way
 

2453
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,030
me that makes sense in one in one way
but it totally doesn't make sense in

2454
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:25,040
but it totally doesn't make sense in
 

2455
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,589
but it totally doesn't make sense in
another if that robot is to interact

2456
00:42:27,589 --> 00:42:27,599
another if that robot is to interact
 

2457
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,430
another if that robot is to interact
operate in the human world and interact

2458
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:29,440
operate in the human world and interact
 

2459
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,710
operate in the human world and interact
with humans

2460
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:30,720
with humans
 

2461
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,109
with humans
we have to we have to anthropomorphize

2462
00:42:33,109 --> 00:42:33,119
we have to we have to anthropomorphize
 

2463
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:33,829
we have to we have to anthropomorphize
it

2464
00:42:33,829 --> 00:42:33,839
it
 

2465
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:35,910
it
in order to understand

2466
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:35,920
in order to understand
 

2467
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,950
in order to understand
as an engineering problem

2468
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:38,960
as an engineering problem
 

2469
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,069
as an engineering problem
how should it operate in a human world

2470
00:42:42,069 --> 00:42:42,079
how should it operate in a human world
 

2471
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:44,150
how should it operate in a human world
now the difference with viruses the

2472
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:44,160
now the difference with viruses the
 

2473
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,990
now the difference with viruses the
scale of operation

2474
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:46,000
scale of operation
 

2475
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,150
scale of operation
it doesn't make sense to treat them as

2476
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:48,160
it doesn't make sense to treat them as
 

2477
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,990
it doesn't make sense to treat them as
human-like because the scale of

2478
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:50,000
human-like because the scale of
 

2479
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,829
human-like because the scale of
operations is much smaller but with

2480
00:42:51,829 --> 00:42:51,839
operations is much smaller but with
 

2481
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:53,829
operations is much smaller but with
robots you're on the same sure time

2482
00:42:53,829 --> 00:42:53,839
robots you're on the same sure time
 

2483
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:55,589
robots you're on the same sure time
scale the same spatial scale of course

2484
00:42:55,589 --> 00:42:55,599
scale the same spatial scale of course
 

2485
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:57,030
scale the same spatial scale of course
in the movies they always give them

2486
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:57,040
in the movies they always give them
 

2487
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,750
in the movies they always give them
names and personalities yeah well yeah

2488
00:42:59,750 --> 00:42:59,760
names and personalities yeah well yeah
 

2489
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,589
names and personalities yeah well yeah
that's the move but that's my argument

2490
00:43:01,589 --> 00:43:01,599
that's the move but that's my argument
 

2491
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:03,270
that's the move but that's my argument
is we should do the same when you're

2492
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:03,280
is we should do the same when you're
 

2493
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,109
is we should do the same when you're
trying to solve the engineering problem

2494
00:43:05,109 --> 00:43:05,119
trying to solve the engineering problem
 

2495
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:06,870
trying to solve the engineering problem
of robotics too it's not just for the

2496
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:06,880
of robotics too it's not just for the
 

2497
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,109
of robotics too it's not just for the
movies well let me ask you this because

2498
00:43:09,109 --> 00:43:09,119
movies well let me ask you this because
 

2499
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:10,470
movies well let me ask you this because
you've said

2500
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:10,480
you've said
 

2501
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,030
you've said
controversially not really that uh

2502
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:13,040
controversially not really that uh
 

2503
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,109
controversially not really that uh
viruses are not living

2504
00:43:15,109 --> 00:43:15,119
viruses are not living
 

2505
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:17,109
viruses are not living
um

2506
00:43:17,109 --> 00:43:17,119
um
 

2507
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,030
um
defend yourself

2508
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:19,040
defend yourself
 

2509
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,109
defend yourself
so are viruses alive or not so i've seen

2510
00:43:21,109 --> 00:43:21,119
so are viruses alive or not so i've seen
 

2511
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,829
so are viruses alive or not so i've seen
many people say oh they have to be they

2512
00:43:23,829 --> 00:43:23,839
many people say oh they have to be they
 

2513
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:25,670
many people say oh they have to be they
they have nucleic acids they evolve they

2514
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:25,680
they have nucleic acids they evolve they
 

2515
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,109
they have nucleic acids they evolve they
mutate

2516
00:43:27,109 --> 00:43:27,119
mutate
 

2517
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,109
mutate
that's all true but they don't do it on

2518
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:29,119
that's all true but they don't do it on
 

2519
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:30,870
that's all true but they don't do it on
their own the particles in my mug are

2520
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:30,880
their own the particles in my mug are
 

2521
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,470
their own the particles in my mug are
just not doing any of that unless they

2522
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:32,480
just not doing any of that unless they
 

2523
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,829
just not doing any of that unless they
get into a cell

2524
00:43:33,829 --> 00:43:33,839
get into a cell
 

2525
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:36,390
get into a cell
so a virus infected cell is alive i

2526
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:36,400
so a virus infected cell is alive i
 

2527
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,790
so a virus infected cell is alive i
totally agree with that because in fact

2528
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:38,800
totally agree with that because in fact
 

2529
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,510
totally agree with that because in fact
when a virus gets in a cell it converts

2530
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:41,520
when a virus gets in a cell it converts
 

2531
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,430
when a virus gets in a cell it converts
it into a virus making

2532
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:43,440
it into a virus making
 

2533
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,069
it into a virus making
factory if you will it's no longer a

2534
00:43:46,069 --> 00:43:46,079
factory if you will it's no longer a
 

2535
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,470
factory if you will it's no longer a
cell it's a some people call it a viral

2536
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:48,480
cell it's a some people call it a viral
 

2537
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,230
cell it's a some people call it a viral
cell i don't really like that but it's

2538
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:50,240
cell i don't really like that but it's
 

2539
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,109
cell i don't really like that but it's
fine

2540
00:43:51,109 --> 00:43:51,119
fine
 

2541
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,030
fine
so that's what i'm talking about the

2542
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:53,040
so that's what i'm talking about the
 

2543
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,430
so that's what i'm talking about the
particle is not alive you can have your

2544
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:55,440
particle is not alive you can have your
 

2545
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,910
particle is not alive you can have your
virus infected cell as as alive but the

2546
00:43:57,910 --> 00:43:57,920
virus infected cell as as alive but the
 

2547
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,190
virus infected cell as as alive but the
particle it just would not do anything

2548
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:01,200
particle it just would not do anything
 

2549
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,670
particle it just would not do anything
forever without getting inside of a cell

2550
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:03,680
forever without getting inside of a cell
 

2551
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,270
forever without getting inside of a cell
well once it's in the cells

2552
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:05,280
well once it's in the cells
 

2553
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,670
well once it's in the cells
it it is alive then but it's no longer a

2554
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:07,680
it it is alive then but it's no longer a
 

2555
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,910
it it is alive then but it's no longer a
particle it's taken apart and nucleic

2556
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:09,920
particle it's taken apart and nucleic
 

2557
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,349
particle it's taken apart and nucleic
acid is moving around the cell it's

2558
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:11,359
acid is moving around the cell it's
 

2559
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:13,589
acid is moving around the cell it's
making proteins eventually it makes new

2560
00:44:13,589 --> 00:44:13,599
making proteins eventually it makes new
 

2561
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:15,190
making proteins eventually it makes new
particles and then those particles

2562
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:15,200
particles and then those particles
 

2563
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,710
particles and then those particles
released from the cell they're not

2564
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:16,720
released from the cell they're not
 

2565
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,710
released from the cell they're not
living anymore so

2566
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:18,720
living anymore so
 

2567
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,390
living anymore so
it's kind of i think it's kind of like a

2568
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:20,400
it's kind of i think it's kind of like a
 

2569
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,589
it's kind of i think it's kind of like a
spore a spore of a

2570
00:44:23,589 --> 00:44:23,599
spore a spore of a
 

2571
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:25,030
spore a spore of a
or a seed

2572
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:25,040
or a seed
 

2573
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,710
or a seed
although the seed just doesn't work

2574
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:26,720
although the seed just doesn't work
 

2575
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,030
although the seed just doesn't work
because the seeds the cells in the seed

2576
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:29,040
because the seeds the cells in the seed
 

2577
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,390
because the seeds the cells in the seed
have the ability to make their own

2578
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:30,400
have the ability to make their own
 

2579
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,910
have the ability to make their own
energy and so forth

2580
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:31,920
energy and so forth
 

2581
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,069
energy and so forth
but a bacterial spore and it's the same

2582
00:44:34,069 --> 00:44:34,079
but a bacterial spore and it's the same
 

2583
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:35,589
but a bacterial spore and it's the same
thing doesn't do anything unless you add

2584
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:35,599
thing doesn't do anything unless you add
 

2585
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:37,030
thing doesn't do anything unless you add
water and nutrients and then it starts

2586
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:37,040
water and nutrients and then it starts
 

2587
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,309
water and nutrients and then it starts
to divide but it doesn't need to get

2588
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:38,319
to divide but it doesn't need to get
 

2589
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:39,829
to divide but it doesn't need to get
into a cell it's very different from a

2590
00:44:39,829 --> 00:44:39,839
into a cell it's very different from a
 

2591
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:42,309
into a cell it's very different from a
virus so that's why the particle

2592
00:44:42,309 --> 00:44:42,319
virus so that's why the particle
 

2593
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:45,190
virus so that's why the particle
and when people think of virus

2594
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:45,200
and when people think of virus
 

2595
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,270
and when people think of virus
they're always thinking of the particle

2596
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:47,280
they're always thinking of the particle
 

2597
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,190
they're always thinking of the particle
and that's why i say it can't be alive

2598
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:49,200
and that's why i say it can't be alive
 

2599
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,630
and that's why i say it can't be alive
because the particle can't do anything

2600
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:50,640
because the particle can't do anything
 

2601
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,470
because the particle can't do anything
on its own but if you think of a virus

2602
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:52,480
on its own but if you think of a virus
 

2603
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,390
on its own but if you think of a virus
as an organism with a particle phase and

2604
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:54,400
as an organism with a particle phase and
 

2605
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,790
as an organism with a particle phase and
a part in a cell then it makes sense to

2606
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:56,800
a part in a cell then it makes sense to
 

2607
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,230
a part in a cell then it makes sense to
be alive

2608
00:44:58,230 --> 00:44:58,240
be alive
 

2609
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,750
be alive
and by the way when you say particle

2610
00:44:59,750 --> 00:44:59,760
and by the way when you say particle
 

2611
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,190
and by the way when you say particle
you're referring to that structure that

2612
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:01,200
you're referring to that structure that
 

2613
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,950
you're referring to that structure that
you've been mentioning so right membrane

2614
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:02,960
you've been mentioning so right membrane
 

2615
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,109
you've been mentioning so right membrane
and not that that's that's been called

2616
00:45:05,109 --> 00:45:05,119
and not that that's that's been called
 

2617
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,270
and not that that's that's been called
what is a viron particle or something

2618
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:07,280
what is a viron particle or something
 

2619
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,430
what is a viron particle or something
so what you should have here i'll send

2620
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:09,440
so what you should have here i'll send
 

2621
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,990
so what you should have here i'll send
you one and then you can refer to what's

2622
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:12,000
you one and then you can refer to what's
 

2623
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,790
you one and then you can refer to what's
the sexiest one to have like what what

2624
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:14,800
the sexiest one to have like what what
 

2625
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,829
the sexiest one to have like what what
in terms of particles to have on the

2626
00:45:16,829 --> 00:45:16,839
in terms of particles to have on the
 

2627
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,589
in terms of particles to have on the
table well unfortunately the ones that

2628
00:45:19,589 --> 00:45:19,599
table well unfortunately the ones that
 

2629
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:21,349
table well unfortunately the ones that
you can 3d print

2630
00:45:21,349 --> 00:45:21,359
you can 3d print
 

2631
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:22,950
you can 3d print
oh they're not going to be so they're

2632
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:22,960
oh they're not going to be so they're
 

2633
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,390
oh they're not going to be so they're
they're only they're the ones that we

2634
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:24,400
they're only they're the ones that we
 

2635
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,270
they're only they're the ones that we
know the structures of right so someone

2636
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:27,280
know the structures of right so someone
 

2637
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,470
know the structures of right so someone
sent me

2638
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:28,480
sent me
 

2639
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,349
sent me
last year a 3d model of source cov2 and

2640
00:45:31,349 --> 00:45:31,359
last year a 3d model of source cov2 and
 

2641
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:32,870
last year a 3d model of source cov2 and
it's beautiful it's actually cracked

2642
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:32,880
it's beautiful it's actually cracked
 

2643
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,950
it's beautiful it's actually cracked
open so you can see the rna and the

2644
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:34,960
open so you can see the rna and the
 

2645
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,349
open so you can see the rna and the
spikes are sticking out and they even

2646
00:45:37,349 --> 00:45:37,359
spikes are sticking out and they even
 

2647
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,270
spikes are sticking out and they even
put some antibodies sticking onto the

2648
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:39,280
put some antibodies sticking onto the
 

2649
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,750
put some antibodies sticking onto the
spikes and that's i mean when i show

2650
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:41,760
spikes and that's i mean when i show
 

2651
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,349
spikes and that's i mean when i show
this on a live stream people love this

2652
00:45:43,349 --> 00:45:43,359
this on a live stream people love this
 

2653
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:45,430
this on a live stream people love this
thing oh my god that's beautiful it is

2654
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:45,440
thing oh my god that's beautiful it is
 

2655
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,109
thing oh my god that's beautiful it is
it's absolutely gorgeous i have that i

it's absolutely gorgeous i have that i
 

2657
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,750
it's absolutely gorgeous i have that i
have my virus that i worked on most of

2658
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:49,760
have my virus that i worked on most of
 

2659
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,230
have my virus that i worked on most of
my career polio virus i have a 3d model

2660
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:52,240
my career polio virus i have a 3d model
 

2661
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,150
my career polio virus i have a 3d model
of that which i actually just had made

2662
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:54,160
of that which i actually just had made
 

2663
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,910
of that which i actually just had made
it's gorgeous and you can have it made

2664
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:55,920
it's gorgeous and you can have it made
 

2665
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,829
it's gorgeous and you can have it made
in any color you want right what would

2666
00:45:57,829 --> 00:45:57,839
in any color you want right what would
 

2667
00:45:57,839 --> 00:45:58,950
in any color you want right what would
you say

2668
00:45:58,950 --> 00:45:58,960
you say
 

2669
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,510
you say
is the most fascinating

2670
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:01,520
is the most fascinating
 

2671
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,470
is the most fascinating
terrifying surprising beautiful virus to

2672
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:04,480
terrifying surprising beautiful virus to
 

2673
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,829
terrifying surprising beautiful virus to
you so

2674
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:05,839
you so
 

2675
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:08,470
you so
of all the viruses you looked at

2676
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:08,480
of all the viruses you looked at
 

2677
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,390
of all the viruses you looked at
sometimes when you just sit late at

2678
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:10,400
sometimes when you just sit late at
 

2679
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,790
sometimes when you just sit late at
night with a glass of wine looking over

2680
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:12,800
night with a glass of wine looking over
 

2681
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,790
night with a glass of wine looking over
the sunset which virus do you think

2682
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:14,800
the sunset which virus do you think
 

2683
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,230
the sunset which virus do you think
about

2684
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:16,240
about
 

2685
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,270
about
so

2686
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:17,280
so
 

2687
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,510
so
fulfilling all of those adjectives is

2688
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:19,520
fulfilling all of those adjectives is
 

2689
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,710
fulfilling all of those adjectives is
hard

2690
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:20,720
hard
 

2691
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,950
hard
right fascinating

2692
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:22,960
right fascinating
 

2693
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,589
right fascinating
exciting terrifying well the terrifying

2694
00:46:25,589 --> 00:46:25,599
exciting terrifying well the terrifying
 

2695
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:28,390
exciting terrifying well the terrifying
is an optional one i think because

2696
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:28,400
is an optional one i think because
 

2697
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,309
is an optional one i think because
maybe that puts a lot of pressure i see

2698
00:46:30,309 --> 00:46:30,319
maybe that puts a lot of pressure i see
 

2699
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:31,589
maybe that puts a lot of pressure i see
terrifying

2700
00:46:31,589 --> 00:46:31,599
terrifying
 

2701
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:33,270
terrifying
to me

2702
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:33,280
to me
 

2703
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,030
to me
i'm not terrified because i think we can

2704
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:35,040
i'm not terrified because i think we can
 

2705
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,230
i'm not terrified because i think we can
handle

2706
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:36,240
handle
 

2707
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,390
handle
as most viruses as you see with this

2708
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:38,400
as most viruses as you see with this
 

2709
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,230
as most viruses as you see with this
brand new one that emerged a year ago

2710
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:40,240
brand new one that emerged a year ago
 

2711
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,390
brand new one that emerged a year ago
where we can handle it

2712
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:42,400
where we can handle it
 

2713
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,309
where we can handle it
from a virology perspective yeah i mean

2714
00:46:44,309 --> 00:46:44,319
from a virology perspective yeah i mean
 

2715
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:46,069
from a virology perspective yeah i mean
the human perspective is a different

2716
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:46,079
the human perspective is a different
 

2717
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,550
the human perspective is a different
story right that's always an issue but

2718
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:48,560
story right that's always an issue but
 

2719
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:49,750
story right that's always an issue but
um

2720
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:49,760
um
 

2721
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,990
um
so i i think

2722
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:52,000
so i i think
 

2723
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,309
so i i think
there are a couple of different

2724
00:46:54,309 --> 00:46:54,319
there are a couple of different
 

2725
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:56,390
there are a couple of different
categories of virus so we could do the

2726
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:56,400
categories of virus so we could do the
 

2727
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,870
categories of virus so we could do the
the terrifying and i think rabies is a

2728
00:46:58,870 --> 00:46:58,880
the terrifying and i think rabies is a
 

2729
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,950
the terrifying and i think rabies is a
terrifying virus because unless you're

2730
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:00,960
terrifying virus because unless you're
 

2731
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,230
terrifying virus because unless you're
vaccinated

2732
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:02,240
vaccinated
 

2733
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,349
vaccinated
100

2734
00:47:03,349 --> 00:47:03,359
100
 

2735
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:05,829
100
certainty you're going to die

2736
00:47:05,829 --> 00:47:05,839
certainty you're going to die

2753
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:25,349
die there's nothing we can do but we do
have a vaccine which we can actually

00:47:25,349 --> 00:47:25,359
have a vaccine which we can actually
 

2755
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:26,390
have a vaccine which we can actually
give you

give you
even after you've been bitten which is

and you can be vaccinated it will
 

2777
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:48,069
and you can be vaccinated it will
prevent that in the meanwhile so people

2778

prevent that in the meanwhile so people
 

2779
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:50,150
prevent that in the meanwhile so people
always say what's the most lethal virus

maybe it's good to linger because we'll
talk about vaccines a few times today

it's good to linger
 

2793
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:09,030
it's good to linger
on cases where vaccines have clearly

should immunize you and most people are
 

2835
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,630
should immunize you and most people are
okay with that yeah because they know

okay with that yeah because they know
 

2837
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,230
okay with that yeah because they know
the consequences and it's also pretty

the consequences and it's also pretty
 

2839
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,109

you know
 

2847
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:07,030
you know
three 250 300 million americans that's

2848
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:07,040
three 250 300 million americans that's
 

2849
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,150
three 250 300 million americans that's
hard but yeah the the the few thousand

2850
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:10,160
hard but yeah the the the few thousand
 

2851
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,910
hard but yeah the the the few thousand
every year is easy so the

2852
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:11,920
every year is easy so the
 

2853
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,829
every year is easy so the
transmissibility is difficult right it

2854
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:13,839
transmissibility is difficult right it
 

2855
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:15,109
transmissibility is difficult right it
has to

2856
00:49:15,109 --> 00:49:15,119
has to
 

2857
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:16,950
has to
oh it's not it's not airborne so now

2858
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:16,960
oh it's not it's not airborne so now
 

2859
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,790
oh it's not it's not airborne so now
you're bored it just has to be you have

2860
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:18,800
you're bored it just has to be you have
 

2861
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,270
you're bored it just has to be you have
to be bitten although some some people

2862
00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:21,280
to be bitten although some some people
 

2863
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,790
to be bitten although some some people
claim you could

2864

claim you could
 

2865
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,630
claim you could
walk into a cave

2866
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:24,640
walk into a cave
 

2867
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,630
walk into a cave
and the bats you know breathing out

2868
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:26,640
and the bats you know breathing out
 

2869
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,630
and the bats you know breathing out
rabies virus could infect you but i

2870
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:28,640
rabies virus could infect you but i
 

2871
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,870
rabies virus could infect you but i
don't really think that's well that's

2872
00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:30,880
don't really think that's well that's
 

2873
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,030
don't really think that's well that's
well substantiated yeah i think it's a

2874
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:33,040
well substantiated yeah i think it's a
 

2875
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,790
well substantiated yeah i think it's a
bike how would you do a study on that

2876
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:34,800
bike how would you do a study on that
 

2877
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,790
bike how would you do a study on that
yeah it's very hard to do you'd have to

2878
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:36,800
yeah it's very hard to do you'd have to
 

2879
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,630
yeah it's very hard to do you'd have to
collect the vapors in the cave and show

2880
00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:38,640
collect the vapors in the cave and show
 

2881
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,630
collect the vapors in the cave and show
that they're infectious which

2882
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:40,640
that they're infectious which
 

2883
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,790
that they're infectious which
and by the way someone emailed me the

2884
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:42,800
and by the way someone emailed me the
 

2885
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,630
and by the way someone emailed me the
other day you'll like this they say why

2886
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:44,640
other day you'll like this they say why
 

2887
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,309
other day you'll like this they say why
can't we just immunize all the bats in

2888
00:49:46,309 --> 00:49:46,319
can't we just immunize all the bats in
 

2889
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:47,990
can't we just immunize all the bats in
the world

2890
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:48,000
the world
 

2891
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,589
the world
against these viruses and i said well

2892
00:49:49,589 --> 00:49:49,599
against these viruses and i said well
 

2893
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:51,190
against these viruses and i said well
how would you do that there's caves

2894
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:51,200
how would you do that there's caves
 

2895
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,109
how would you do that there's caves
everywhere right yeah

2896
00:49:53,109 --> 00:49:53,119
everywhere right yeah
 

2897
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:54,950
everywhere right yeah
he said well maybe you could just go and

2898
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:54,960
he said well maybe you could just go and
 

2899
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,549
he said well maybe you could just go and
aerosolize that

2900
00:49:56,549 --> 00:49:56,559
aerosolize that
 

2901
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:58,790
aerosolize that
yeah it's pretty dangerous and then and

2902
00:49:58,790 --> 00:49:58,800
yeah it's pretty dangerous and then and
 

2903
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,710
yeah it's pretty dangerous and then and
then all the bats should have vaccine

2904
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:00,720
then all the bats should have vaccine
 

2905
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,549
then all the bats should have vaccine
passports to make sure that they're yeah

2906
00:50:02,549 --> 00:50:02,559
passports to make sure that they're yeah
 

2907

you we do
 

2915
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,990
you we do
immunize wildlife against rabies

2916
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:12,000
immunize wildlife against rabies
 

2917
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,950
immunize wildlife against rabies
we have rabies vaccines for wild animals

2918
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:14,960
we have rabies vaccines for wild animals
 

2919
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:15,990
we have rabies vaccines for wild animals
there are a whole bunch of them that get

2920
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:16,000
there are a whole bunch of them that get
 

2921
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,349
there are a whole bunch of them that get
rabies

2922
00:50:17,349 --> 00:50:17,359
rabies
 

2923
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:20,150
rabies
and we put it we put it in bait and drop

2924
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:20,160
and we put it we put it in bait and drop
 

2925
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,670
and we put it we put it in bait and drop
it from helicopters in the woods and it

2926
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:21,680
it from helicopters in the woods and it
 

2927
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,990
it from helicopters in the woods and it
drops down the incidence of rabies and

2928
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:24,000
drops down the incidence of rabies and
 

2929
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,150
drops down the incidence of rabies and
people wow you know people hiking get

2930
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:26,160
people wow you know people hiking get
 

2931
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,510
people wow you know people hiking get
bitten and so forth it drops the

2932
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:27,520
bitten and so forth it drops the
 

2933
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,430
bitten and so forth it drops the
incident so we can do that i didn't know

2934
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:29,440
incident so we can do that i didn't know
 

2935
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,829
incident so we can do that i didn't know
that i always wondered how much medical

2936
00:50:31,829 --> 00:50:31,839
that i always wondered how much medical
 

2937
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:33,589
that i always wondered how much medical
care are we doing for animals in the

2938
00:50:33,589 --> 00:50:33,599
care are we doing for animals in the
 

2939
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,190
care are we doing for animals in the
wild because

2940
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:35,200
wild because
 

2941
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,430
wild because
i've recently become more and more aware

2942
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:37,440
i've recently become more and more aware
 

2943
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,069
i've recently become more and more aware
that animals are living in extreme

2944
00:50:40,069 --> 00:50:40,079
that animals are living in extreme
 

2945
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:41,510
that animals are living in extreme
poverty

2946
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:41,520
poverty
 

2947
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,270
poverty
right like you don't know you think like

2948
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:43,280
right like you don't know you think like
 

2949
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,670
right like you don't know you think like
natural it's great

2950
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:45,680
natural it's great
 

2951
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:49,190
natural it's great
um you know like uh like when animals

2952
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:49,200
um you know like uh like when animals
 

2953
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,829
um you know like uh like when animals
are living on a farm it's terrible but

2954
00:50:51,829 --> 00:50:51,839
are living on a farm it's terrible but
 

2955
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:53,589
are living on a farm it's terrible but
then you also have to compare to like

2956
00:50:53,589 --> 00:50:53,599
then you also have to compare to like
 

2957
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:56,150
then you also have to compare to like
what life is like and or like the zoo

2958
00:50:56,150 --> 00:50:56,160
what life is like and or like the zoo
 

2959
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,829
what life is like and or like the zoo
you have to compare what life is like in

2960
00:50:57,829 --> 00:50:57,839
you have to compare what life is like in
 

2961
00:50:57,839 --> 00:50:59,190
you have to compare what life is like in
in the wild

2962
00:50:59,190 --> 00:50:59,200
in the wild
 

2963
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,270
in the wild
life in the wild is very tough i think i

2964
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:01,280
life in the wild is very tough i think i
 

2965
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,790
life in the wild is very tough i think i
mean most animals have to well the

2966
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:02,800
mean most animals have to well the
 

2967
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,230
mean most animals have to well the
carnivores anyway they have to catch

2968
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:04,240
carnivores anyway they have to catch
 

2969
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,309
carnivores anyway they have to catch
their food every day yeah right and then

2970
00:51:06,309 --> 00:51:06,319
their food every day yeah right and then
 

2971
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:08,950
their food every day yeah right and then
there's the viruses there and viruses as

2972
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:08,960
there's the viruses there and viruses as
 

2973
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,829
there's the viruses there and viruses as
well so the rabies immunization is the

2974
00:51:11,829 --> 00:51:11,839
well so the rabies immunization is the
 

2975
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:13,750
well so the rabies immunization is the
only

2976
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:13,760
only
 

2977
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:17,430
only
one i'm aware of for wild animals um

2978
00:51:17,430 --> 00:51:17,440
one i'm aware of for wild animals um
 

2979
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,990
one i'm aware of for wild animals um
we do immunize lots of other

2980
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:20,000
we do immunize lots of other
 

2981
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,470
we do immunize lots of other
animals we immunize

2982
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:22,480
animals we immunize
 

2983
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,950
animals we immunize
chickens and pigs and cows

2984
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:24,960
chickens and pigs and cows
 

2985
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,510
chickens and pigs and cows
even fish farmed fish we

2986
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:27,520
even fish farmed fish we
 

2987
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,430
even fish farmed fish we
pick each fish up and give it an

2988
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:29,440
pick each fish up and give it an
 

2989
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,030
pick each fish up and give it an
injection you know when it's a small

2990
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:31,040
injection you know when it's a small
 

2991
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,390
injection you know when it's a small
fish

2992
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:32,400
fish
 

2993
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,230
fish
but that's mostly

2994
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:34,240
but that's mostly
 

2995
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,230
but that's mostly
so that the farmers get a good yield we

2996
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:36,240
so that the farmers get a good yield we
 

2997
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,069
so that the farmers get a good yield we
don't really care about the animals

2998
00:51:38,069 --> 00:51:38,079
don't really care about the animals
 

2999
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:40,150
don't really care about the animals
right we want a good yield for

3000
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:40,160
right we want a good yield for
 

3001
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,309
right we want a good yield for
market and then there's some examples

3002
00:51:42,309 --> 00:51:42,319
market and then there's some examples
 

3003
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:44,549
market and then there's some examples
where we

3004
00:51:44,549 --> 00:51:44,559
where we
 

3005
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:47,270
where we
immunize animals to prevent

3006
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:47,280
immunize animals to prevent
 

3007
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,829
immunize animals to prevent
spillovers into

3008
00:51:48,829 --> 00:51:48,839
spillovers into
 

3009
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:50,950
spillovers into
people so there's a disease called

3010
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:50,960
people so there's a disease called
 

3011
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,349
people so there's a disease called
hendra in australia

3012
00:51:53,349 --> 00:51:53,359
hendra in australia
 

3013
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:55,270
hendra in australia
which

3014
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:55,280
which
 

3015
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,230
which
was

3016
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:56,240
was
 

3017
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,390
was
discovered in the 90s it turns out that

3018
00:51:58,390 --> 00:51:58,400
discovered in the 90s it turns out that
 

3019
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,309
discovered in the 90s it turns out that
there are bats fruit bats that have this

3020
00:52:00,309 --> 00:52:00,319
there are bats fruit bats that have this
 

3021
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:02,309
there are bats fruit bats that have this
virus and the bats are fine

3022
00:52:02,309 --> 00:52:02,319
virus and the bats are fine
 

3023
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:03,990
virus and the bats are fine
but sometimes they flying into horse

3024
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:04,000
but sometimes they flying into horse
 

3025
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,030
but sometimes they flying into horse
stalls

3026
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:05,040
stalls
 

3027
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,870
stalls
and the horses get infected these are in

3028
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:06,880
and the horses get infected these are in
 

3029
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,870
and the horses get infected these are in
australia it was initially race horses

3030
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:08,880
australia it was initially race horses
 

3031
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,030
australia it was initially race horses
which are very expensive right

3032
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:11,040
which are very expensive right
 

3033
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,790
which are very expensive right
the horses got infected and they died

3034
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:12,800
the horses got infected and they died
 

3035
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,150
the horses got infected and they died
and the humans who would take care of

3036
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:14,160
and the humans who would take care of
 

3037
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,309
and the humans who would take care of
them would die also so now they immunize

3038
00:52:16,309 --> 00:52:16,319
them would die also so now they immunize
 

3039
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:18,069
them would die also so now they immunize
the horses

3040
00:52:18,069 --> 00:52:18,079
the horses
 

3041
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:20,309
the horses
to prevent the well to save the horses

3042
00:52:20,309 --> 00:52:20,319
to prevent the well to save the horses
 

3043
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:21,589
to prevent the well to save the horses
probably that's the motivation because

3044
00:52:21,589 --> 00:52:21,599
probably that's the motivation because
 

3045
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:23,190
probably that's the motivation because
these horses are hundreds of thousands

3046
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:23,200
these horses are hundreds of thousands
 

3047
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,030
these horses are hundreds of thousands
of dollars right and then the people

3048
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:25,040
of dollars right and then the people
 

3049
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,950
of dollars right and then the people
don't get sick because the horses don't

3050
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:26,960
don't get sick because the horses don't
 

3051
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,710
don't get sick because the horses don't
get sick you don't want to immunize all

3052
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:28,720
get sick you don't want to immunize all
 

3053
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:31,190
get sick you don't want to immunize all
the people because it's too rare but

3054
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:31,200
the people because it's too rare but
 

3055
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,349
the people because it's too rare but
that approach is called one world health

3056
00:52:33,349 --> 00:52:33,359
that approach is called one world health
 

3057
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:35,190
that approach is called one world health
approach which means everything's

3058
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:35,200
approach which means everything's
 

3059
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,030
approach which means everything's
connected on the planet

3060
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:37,040
connected on the planet
 

3061
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,309
connected on the planet
and we have to think of everything in

3062
00:52:38,309 --> 00:52:38,319
and we have to think of everything in
 

3063
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:40,870
and we have to think of everything in
the grander scheme not just us

3064
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:40,880
the grander scheme not just us
 

3065
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,790
the grander scheme not just us
yeah so you can immunize some things

3066
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:42,800
yeah so you can immunize some things
 

3067
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,549
yeah so you can immunize some things
along the trajectory that a virus would

3068
00:52:44,549 --> 00:52:44,559
along the trajectory that a virus would
 

3069
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:46,950
along the trajectory that a virus would
take exactly so something some living

3070
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:46,960
take exactly so something some living
 

3071
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,150
take exactly so something some living
beings

3072
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:48,160
beings
 

3073
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,230
beings
in the arabian peninsula they have a

3074
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:50,240
in the arabian peninsula they have a
 

3075
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,549
in the arabian peninsula they have a
mers coronavirus issue every month there

3076
00:52:52,549 --> 00:52:52,559
mers coronavirus issue every month there
 

3077
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:55,670
mers coronavirus issue every month there
are a couple of cases where a camel

3078
00:52:55,670 --> 00:52:55,680
are a couple of cases where a camel
 

3079
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,510
are a couple of cases where a camel
will infect the human and the human can

3080
00:52:57,510 --> 00:52:57,520
will infect the human and the human can
 

3081
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,950
will infect the human and the human can
get very sick

3082
00:52:58,950 --> 00:52:58,960
get very sick
 

3083
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,349
get very sick
it's respiratory disease very very much

3084
00:53:01,349 --> 00:53:01,359
it's respiratory disease very very much
 

3085
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:03,109
it's respiratory disease very very much
like covid

3086
00:53:03,109 --> 00:53:03,119
like covid
 

3087
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:04,390
like covid
and so

3088
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:04,400
and so
 

3089
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,069
and so
camels are very common there they're

3090
00:53:06,069 --> 00:53:06,079
camels are very common there they're
 

3091
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:08,630
camels are very common there they're
used they're raced they're used as pets

3092
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:08,640
used they're raced they're used as pets
 

3093
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,470
used they're raced they're used as pets
they're eaten

3094
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:10,480
they're eaten
 

3095
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,390
they're eaten
so there's a lot of human camel contact

3096
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:12,400
so there's a lot of human camel contact
 

3097
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,630
so there's a lot of human camel contact
but the number of cases are rare two to

3098
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:14,640
but the number of cases are rare two to
 

3099
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:15,910
but the number of cases are rare two to
a month so you don't want to immunize

3100
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:15,920
a month so you don't want to immunize
 

3101
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,670
a month so you don't want to immunize
all the humans so the idea would be to

3102
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:17,680
all the humans so the idea would be to
 

3103
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,230
all the humans so the idea would be to
immunize the camels

3104
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:20,240
immunize the camels
 

3105
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:23,589
immunize the camels
so i like it so okay so you put rabies

3106
00:53:23,589 --> 00:53:23,599
so i like it so okay so you put rabies
 

3107
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:25,670
so i like it so okay so you put rabies
but ebola

3108
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:25,680
but ebola
 

3109
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:29,990
but ebola
uh also is a famously deadly one right

3110
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:30,000
uh also is a famously deadly one right
 

3111
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,069
uh also is a famously deadly one right
what is it it kills like i don't know 50

3112
00:53:32,069 --> 00:53:32,079
what is it it kills like i don't know 50
 

3113
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:35,670
what is it it kills like i don't know 50
60 percent of it could be 50 to 90 but

3114
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:35,680
60 percent of it could be 50 to 90 but
 

3115
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,069
60 percent of it could be 50 to 90 but
that's in africa where the health care

3116
00:53:38,069 --> 00:53:38,079
that's in africa where the health care
 

3117
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:40,309
that's in africa where the health care
isn't great what you saw when they when

3118
00:53:40,309 --> 00:53:40,319
isn't great what you saw when they when
 

3119
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:42,390
isn't great what you saw when they when
cases of ebola came to the u.s

3120
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:42,400
cases of ebola came to the u.s
 

3121
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,990
cases of ebola came to the u.s
we were we could take care of it we knew

3122
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:44,000
we were we could take care of it we knew
 

3123
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,670
we were we could take care of it we knew
how to take care of we had fancy

3124
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:45,680
how to take care of we had fancy
 

3125
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,349
how to take care of we had fancy
hospitals and so forth and now we have a

3126
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:47,359
hospitals and so forth and now we have a
 

3127
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:48,950
hospitals and so forth and now we have a
vaccine so

3128
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:48,960
vaccine so
 

3129
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:52,150
vaccine so
we can and the vaccine is really good

3130
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:52,160
we can and the vaccine is really good
 

3131
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,549
we can and the vaccine is really good
but there are many governments in africa

3132
00:53:54,549 --> 00:53:54,559
but there are many governments in africa
 

3133
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,870
but there are many governments in africa
who that are suspicious of of us and

3134
00:53:56,870 --> 00:53:56,880
who that are suspicious of of us and
 

3135
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,549
who that are suspicious of of us and
they don't want to use our vaccines so

3136
00:53:58,549 --> 00:53:58,559
they don't want to use our vaccines so
 

3137
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:00,549
they don't want to use our vaccines so
that they so there's a vaccine for ebola

3138
00:54:00,549 --> 00:54:00,559
that they so there's a vaccine for ebola
 

3139
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:02,630
that they so there's a vaccine for ebola
there is yeah and uh

3140
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:02,640
there is yeah and uh
 

3141
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,190
there is yeah and uh
the effectiveness and safety of it to

3142
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:05,200
the effectiveness and safety of it to
 

3143
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,430
the effectiveness and safety of it to
how much is understood so

3144
00:54:07,430 --> 00:54:07,440
how much is understood so
 

3145
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,750
how much is understood so
this is difficult because there's not a

3146
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:09,760
this is difficult because there's not a
 

3147
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,829
this is difficult because there's not a
lot of ebola right

3148
00:54:11,829 --> 00:54:11,839
lot of ebola right
 

3149
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:13,990
lot of ebola right
it's not a continuous ongoing thing

3150
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:14,000
it's not a continuous ongoing thing
 

3151
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,829
it's not a continuous ongoing thing
there are sporadic outbreaks here and

3152
00:54:15,829 --> 00:54:15,839
there are sporadic outbreaks here and
 

3153
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:18,309
there are sporadic outbreaks here and
there of a few thousand people at most

3154
00:54:18,309 --> 00:54:18,319
there of a few thousand people at most
 

3155
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:20,790
there of a few thousand people at most
at most usually a few hundred and

3156
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:20,800
at most usually a few hundred and
 

3157
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,630
at most usually a few hundred and
the biggest ever

3158
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:22,640
the biggest ever
 

3159
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,230
the biggest ever
in fact this is why we didn't for years

3160
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:24,240
in fact this is why we didn't for years
 

3161
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,870
in fact this is why we didn't for years
have an ebola vaccine the us military

3162
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:26,880
have an ebola vaccine the us military
 

3163
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,870
have an ebola vaccine the us military
together with canada developed an ebola

3164
00:54:28,870 --> 00:54:28,880
together with canada developed an ebola
 

3165
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,549
together with canada developed an ebola
vaccine for service people right they

3166
00:54:30,549 --> 00:54:30,559
vaccine for service people right they
 

3167
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:32,069
vaccine for service people right they
wanted to say well we're sending people

3168
00:54:32,069 --> 00:54:32,079
wanted to say well we're sending people
 

3169
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:34,069
wanted to say well we're sending people
into these ebola areas we want a vaccine

3170
00:54:34,069 --> 00:54:34,079
into these ebola areas we want a vaccine
 

3171
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:35,829
into these ebola areas we want a vaccine
for them so they had developed it

3172
00:54:35,829 --> 00:54:35,839
for them so they had developed it
 

3173
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:36,950
for them so they had developed it
through

3174
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:36,960
through
 

3175
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,950
through
all the pre-clinical which means before

3176
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:38,960
all the pre-clinical which means before
 

3177
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,950
all the pre-clinical which means before
it goes into people

3178
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:40,960
it goes into people
 

3179
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,789
it goes into people
and that stopped because there was no

3180
00:54:42,789 --> 00:54:42,799
and that stopped because there was no
 

3181
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:45,030
and that stopped because there was no
money to do a phase one and a phase two

3182
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:45,040
money to do a phase one and a phase two
 

3183
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,430
money to do a phase one and a phase two
and a phase three in fact for phase two

3184
00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:47,440
and a phase three in fact for phase two
 

3185
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,950
and a phase three in fact for phase two
and three you need to have infections

3186
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:48,960
and three you need to have infections
 

3187
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,470
and three you need to have infections
going on because you're looking at how

3188
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:50,480
going on because you're looking at how
 

3189
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,309
going on because you're looking at how
well the vaccine prevents infections

3190
00:54:52,309 --> 00:54:52,319
well the vaccine prevents infections
 

3191
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:54,789
well the vaccine prevents infections
right so then there was a west african

3192
00:54:54,789 --> 00:54:54,799
right so then there was a west african
 

3193
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:56,950
right so then there was a west african
outbreak in 2015

3194
00:54:56,950 --> 00:54:56,960
outbreak in 2015
 

3195
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,789
outbreak in 2015
2013 2015. the most cases ever 25 000 so

3196
00:55:00,789 --> 00:55:00,799
2013 2015. the most cases ever 25 000 so
 

3197
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:03,670
2013 2015. the most cases ever 25 000 so
they got to test the vaccine

3198
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:03,680
they got to test the vaccine
 

3199
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,030
they got to test the vaccine
but

3200
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:05,040
but
 

3201
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,030
but
they only put it in a few thousand

3202
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:07,040
they only put it in a few thousand
 

3203
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,109
they only put it in a few thousand
people it's not like it's been in

3204
00:55:09,109 --> 00:55:09,119
people it's not like it's been in
 

3205
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:10,710
people it's not like it's been in
hundreds of thousands of people like the

3206
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:10,720
hundreds of thousands of people like the
 

3207
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,789
hundreds of thousands of people like the
covid vaccines has been so

3208
00:55:12,789 --> 00:55:12,799
covid vaccines has been so
 

3209
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:14,789
covid vaccines has been so
it's it looks like it's it has high

3210
00:55:14,789 --> 00:55:14,799
it's it looks like it's it has high
 

3211
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:16,230
it's it looks like it's it has high
efficacy

3212
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:16,240
efficacy
 

3213
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,549
efficacy
um but we'd like to have more data

3214
00:55:18,549 --> 00:55:18,559
um but we'd like to have more data
 

3215
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:21,349
um but we'd like to have more data
side effects may be are not so great

3216
00:55:21,349 --> 00:55:21,359
side effects may be are not so great
 

3217
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:22,390
side effects may be are not so great
there are a couple of different

3218
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:22,400
there are a couple of different
 

3219
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,390
there are a couple of different
available vaccines some have been tested

3220
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:24,400
available vaccines some have been tested
 

3221
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,990
available vaccines some have been tested
more than others

3222
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:26,000
more than others
 

3223
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,270
more than others
i would say

3224
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:27,280
i would say
 

3225
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,190
i would say
this would probably not be widely

3226
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:29,200
this would probably not be widely
 

3227
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,430
this would probably not be widely
accepted in the u.s

3228
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:31,440
accepted in the u.s
 

3229
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,950
accepted in the u.s
but then

3230
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:32,960
but then
 

3231
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,470
but then
neither would be

3232
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:34,480
neither would be
 

3233
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,470
neither would be
something over 50

3234
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:36,480
something over 50
 

3235
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:39,190
something over 50
uh deadliness of a virus no i think if

3236
00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:39,200
uh deadliness of a virus no i think if
 

3237
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,990
uh deadliness of a virus no i think if
you are in fact many physicians work in

3238
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:42,000
you are in fact many physicians work in
 

3239
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,589
you are in fact many physicians work in
countries that have ebola so they get

3240
00:55:43,589 --> 00:55:43,599
countries that have ebola so they get
 

3241
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:45,270
countries that have ebola so they get
vaccinated because they understand the

3242
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:45,280
vaccinated because they understand the
 

3243
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,190
vaccinated because they understand the
choice yeah right it's always about the

3244
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:47,200
choice yeah right it's always about the
 

3245
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,349
choice yeah right it's always about the
choice um so

3246
00:55:49,349 --> 00:55:49,359
choice um so
 

3247
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:52,150
choice um so
so then one more thing to answer the

3248
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:52,160
so then one more thing to answer the
 

3249
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,349
so then one more thing to answer the
interesting

3250
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:53,359
interesting
 

3251
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:55,349
interesting
what are some of the viruses you really

3252
00:55:55,349 --> 00:55:55,359
what are some of the viruses you really
 

3253
00:55:55,359 --> 00:55:56,950
what are some of the viruses you really
are fascinated by

3254
00:55:56,950 --> 00:55:56,960
are fascinated by
 

3255
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:57,829
are fascinated by
there are

3256
00:55:57,829 --> 00:55:57,839
there are
 

3257
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:00,069
there are
a number of viruses that

3258
00:56:00,069 --> 00:56:00,079
a number of viruses that
 

3259
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:01,990
a number of viruses that
have clearly been shown to alter host

3260
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:02,000
have clearly been shown to alter host
 

3261
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,549
have clearly been shown to alter host
behavior and that's how they spread

3262
00:56:04,549 --> 00:56:04,559
behavior and that's how they spread
 

3263
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:05,990
behavior and that's how they spread
i think those are fascinating for

3264
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:06,000
i think those are fascinating for
 

3265
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,829
i think those are fascinating for
example

3266
00:56:07,829 --> 00:56:07,839
example
 

3267
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:11,109
example
there are some viruses of plants

3268
00:56:11,109 --> 00:56:11,119
there are some viruses of plants
 

3269
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:14,789
there are some viruses of plants
that are spread by aphids

3270
00:56:14,789 --> 00:56:14,799
that are spread by aphids
 

3271
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:17,750
that are spread by aphids
and the aphid bites the plant the virus

3272
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:17,760
and the aphid bites the plant the virus
 

3273
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,390
and the aphid bites the plant the virus
reproduces in the plant and it somehow

3274
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:20,400
reproduces in the plant and it somehow
 

3275
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:23,270
reproduces in the plant and it somehow
engineers the plant to give off volatile

3276
00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:23,280
engineers the plant to give off volatile
 

3277
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,549
engineers the plant to give off volatile
organics

3278
00:56:24,549 --> 00:56:24,559
organics
 

3279
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:27,109
organics
to attract more aphids which will spread

3280
00:56:27,109 --> 00:56:27,119
to attract more aphids which will spread
 

3281
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:30,069
to attract more aphids which will spread
the virus

3282
00:56:30,069 --> 00:56:30,079
the virus
 

3283
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:31,510
the virus
isn't that amazing

3284
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:31,520
isn't that amazing
 

3285
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:34,950
isn't that amazing
yeah so that's altering the behavior

3286
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:34,960
yeah so that's altering the behavior
 

3287
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,109
yeah so that's altering the behavior
altering because somehow the virus

3288
00:56:37,109 --> 00:56:37,119
altering because somehow the virus
 

3289
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:39,030
altering because somehow the virus
infecting the plant cells gives off

3290
00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:39,040
infecting the plant cells gives off
 

3291
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,710
infecting the plant cells gives off
these organics and it contracts aphids

3292
00:56:40,710 --> 00:56:40,720
these organics and it contracts aphids
 

3293
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,710
these organics and it contracts aphids
and furthermore

3294
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:42,720
and furthermore
 

3295
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,870
and furthermore
somehow the when the aphid bites it

3296
00:56:44,870 --> 00:56:44,880
somehow the when the aphid bites it
 

3297
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,109
somehow the when the aphid bites it
tastes horrible so they immediately

3298
00:56:47,109 --> 00:56:47,119
tastes horrible so they immediately
 

3299
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:48,950
tastes horrible so they immediately
leave with the virus they've just picked

3300
00:56:48,950 --> 00:56:48,960
leave with the virus they've just picked
 

3301
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:51,109
leave with the virus they've just picked
up and go to another plant to spread it

3302
00:56:51,109 --> 00:56:51,119
up and go to another plant to spread it
 

3303
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:52,870
up and go to another plant to spread it
so they're attracted and then repulsed

3304
00:56:52,870 --> 00:56:52,880
so they're attracted and then repulsed
 

3305
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,390
so they're attracted and then repulsed
at the same time and obviously you don't

3306
00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:54,400
at the same time and obviously you don't
 

3307
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,150
at the same time and obviously you don't
want to anthropomorphize this like a

3308
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:56,160
want to anthropomorphize this like a
 

3309
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,069
want to anthropomorphize this like a
strategy they're taking on somehow this

3310
00:56:58,069 --> 00:56:58,079
strategy they're taking on somehow this
 

3311
00:56:58,079 --> 00:56:59,910
strategy they're taking on somehow this
worked out it worked out this way it

3312
00:56:59,910 --> 00:56:59,920
worked out it worked out this way it
 

3313
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,510
worked out it worked out this way it
just evolved and you know evolution is

3314
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:01,520
just evolved and you know evolution is
 

3315
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:04,230
just evolved and you know evolution is
sometimes hard to trace right

3316
00:57:04,230 --> 00:57:04,240
sometimes hard to trace right
 

3317
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,109
sometimes hard to trace right
like

3318
00:57:05,109 --> 00:57:05,119
like
 

3319
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:06,789
like
darwin famously said he could never

3320
00:57:06,789 --> 00:57:06,799
darwin famously said he could never
 

3321
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:08,470
darwin famously said he could never
figure out how an eye evolved from a

3322
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:08,480
figure out how an eye evolved from a
 

3323
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,069
figure out how an eye evolved from a
single cell right but

3324
00:57:10,069 --> 00:57:10,079
single cell right but
 

3325
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:11,030
single cell right but
it did

3326
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:11,040
it did
 

3327
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:14,630
it did
the more complicated complex the the

3328
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:14,640
the more complicated complex the the
 

3329
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,789
the more complicated complex the the
holistic organism is that the virus

3330
00:57:16,789 --> 00:57:16,799
holistic organism is that the virus
 

3331
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:18,069
holistic organism is that the virus
invades

3332
00:57:18,069 --> 00:57:18,079
invades
 

3333
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:20,309
invades
the less able it is to control that

3334
00:57:20,309 --> 00:57:20,319
the less able it is to control that
 

3335
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:22,069
the less able it is to control that
organism right so i wonder if there's

3336
00:57:22,069 --> 00:57:22,079
organism right so i wonder if there's
 

3337
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:25,990
organism right so i wonder if there's
viruses that can control human behavior

3338
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:26,000
viruses that can control human behavior
 

3339
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:26,870
viruses that can control human behavior
um

3340
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:26,880
um
 

3341
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,630
um
you know to

3342
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:28,640
you know to
 

3343
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:29,910
you know to
induce

3344
00:57:29,910 --> 00:57:29,920
induce
 

3345
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,789
induce
more spread of the virus

3346
00:57:32,789 --> 00:57:32,799
more spread of the virus
 

3347
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:34,549
more spread of the virus
well i don't see why not there's not

3348
00:57:34,549 --> 00:57:34,559
well i don't see why not there's not
 

3349
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:36,630
well i don't see why not there's not
enough humans i supposed to like evolve

3350
00:57:36,630 --> 00:57:36,640
enough humans i supposed to like evolve
 

3351
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,470
enough humans i supposed to like evolve
through well we can't do the experiment

3352
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:38,480
through well we can't do the experiment
 

3353
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,069
through well we can't do the experiment
to test it right we have to observe and

3354
00:57:40,069 --> 00:57:40,079
to test it right we have to observe and
 

3355
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:41,670
to test it right we have to observe and
that's always hard when you're observing

3356
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:41,680
that's always hard when you're observing
 

3357
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,589
that's always hard when you're observing
because there's so many things that can

3358
00:57:43,589 --> 00:57:43,599
because there's so many things that can
 

3359
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:44,950
because there's so many things that can
confound

3360
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:44,960
confound
 

3361
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,390
confound
what you're looking at change human

3362
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:46,400
what you're looking at change human
 

3363
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,230
what you're looking at change human
behavior yeah i mean there's so many

3364
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:48,240
behavior yeah i mean there's so many
 

3365
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:51,750
behavior yeah i mean there's so many
things that impinge on our behavior but

3366
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:51,760
things that impinge on our behavior but
 

3367
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,950
things that impinge on our behavior but
um yeah it's i think it's possible um i

3368
00:57:54,950 --> 00:57:54,960
um yeah it's i think it's possible um i
 

3369
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:57,109
um yeah it's i think it's possible um i
think it's highly possible if it does it

3370
00:57:57,109 --> 00:57:57,119
think it's highly possible if it does it
 

3371
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:59,589
think it's highly possible if it does it
in a plant why not change some other

3372
00:57:59,589 --> 00:57:59,599
in a plant why not change some other
 

3373
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:01,270
in a plant why not change some other
organisms behavior i think it's fine

3374
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:01,280
organisms behavior i think it's fine
 

3375
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,710
organisms behavior i think it's fine
anyway those fascinate me there are lots

3376
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:02,720
anyway those fascinate me there are lots
 

3377
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,390
anyway those fascinate me there are lots
of examples of those

3378
00:58:04,390 --> 00:58:04,400
of examples of those
 

3379
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,109
of examples of those
that are fascinating and how they work

3380
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:07,119
that are fascinating and how they work
 

3381
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:08,870
that are fascinating and how they work
people are trying to figure out but

3382
00:58:08,870 --> 00:58:08,880
people are trying to figure out but
 

3383
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,230
people are trying to figure out but
there's not a lot of money to work on

3384
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:10,240
there's not a lot of money to work on
 

3385
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,150
there's not a lot of money to work on
you know insect and plant viruses unless

3386
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:12,160
you know insect and plant viruses unless
 

3387
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,230
you know insect and plant viruses unless
you're going to the usda so they don't

3388
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:14,240
you're going to the usda so they don't
 

3389
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,430
you're going to the usda so they don't
get a lot of

3390
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:15,440
get a lot of
 

3391
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,990
get a lot of
uh work moving forward well is there if

3392
00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:18,000
uh work moving forward well is there if
 

3393
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,910
uh work moving forward well is there if
you understand some of those viruses is

3394
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:19,920
you understand some of those viruses is
 

3395
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:22,630
you understand some of those viruses is
that transferable to human viruses that

3396
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:22,640
that transferable to human viruses that
 

3397
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:25,030
that transferable to human viruses that
understanding i think some of it could

3398
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:25,040
understanding i think some of it could
 

3399
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:27,510
understanding i think some of it could
be sure i think the general principles

3400
00:58:27,510 --> 00:58:27,520
be sure i think the general principles
 

3401
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,109
be sure i think the general principles
for example how the

3402
00:58:29,109 --> 00:58:29,119
for example how the
 

3403
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:31,270
for example how the
how does the virus cause volatile

3404
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:31,280
how does the virus cause volatile
 

3405
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,510
how does the virus cause volatile
organics to be made it must be turning

3406
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:33,520
organics to be made it must be turning
 

3407
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:34,950
organics to be made it must be turning
on some genes

3408
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:34,960
on some genes
 

3409
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,270
on some genes
and you could learn principles from that

3410
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:37,280
and you could learn principles from that
 

3411
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,270
and you could learn principles from that
how the virus might do that sure i think

3412
00:58:39,270 --> 00:58:39,280
how the virus might do that sure i think
 

3413
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,589
how the virus might do that sure i think
everything is broadly applicable so to

3414
00:58:41,589 --> 00:58:41,599
everything is broadly applicable so to
 

3415
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:42,710
everything is broadly applicable so to
say

3416
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:42,720
say
 

3417
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,950
say
it's not useful to study

3418
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:44,960
it's not useful to study
 

3419
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,270
it's not useful to study
viruses of insects and plants is just

3420
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:47,280
viruses of insects and plants is just
 

3421
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,670
viruses of insects and plants is just
wrong because in science you probably

3422
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:49,680
wrong because in science you probably
 

3423
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,589
wrong because in science you probably
know this maybe in your field it's the

3424
00:58:51,589 --> 00:58:51,599
know this maybe in your field it's the
 

3425
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:52,870
know this maybe in your field it's the
same

3426
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:52,880
same
 

3427
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,230
same
if you're curious you're going to run

3428
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:54,240
if you're curious you're going to run
 

3429
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:56,230
if you're curious you're going to run
into interesting things that you never

3430
00:58:56,230 --> 00:58:56,240
into interesting things that you never
 

3431
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,230
into interesting things that you never
planned on right that's why people like

3432
00:58:58,230 --> 00:58:58,240
planned on right that's why people like
 

3433
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,390
planned on right that's why people like
you can criticize uh why do we want to

3434
00:59:00,390 --> 00:59:00,400
you can criticize uh why do we want to
 

3435
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,510
you can criticize uh why do we want to
go on mars why do we colonize mars

3436
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:03,520
go on mars why do we colonize mars
 

3437
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:05,270
go on mars why do we colonize mars
well it's like why do you want to go to

3438
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:05,280
well it's like why do you want to go to
 

3439
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,630
well it's like why do you want to go to
the moon

3440
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:06,640
the moon
 

3441
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,710
the moon
the the reality is when you do really

3442
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:08,720
the the reality is when you do really
 

3443
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,069
the the reality is when you do really
difficult things

3444
00:59:10,069 --> 00:59:10,079
difficult things
 

3445
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:12,470
difficult things
yeah engineering things like all these

3446
00:59:12,470 --> 00:59:12,480
yeah engineering things like all these
 

3447
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,230
yeah engineering things like all these
inventions along the way are created

3448
00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:14,240
inventions along the way are created
 

3449
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:16,549
inventions along the way are created
it's kind of fascinating how basically

3450
00:59:16,549 --> 00:59:16,559
it's kind of fascinating how basically
 

3451
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:17,349
it's kind of fascinating how basically
just

3452
00:59:17,349 --> 00:59:17,359
just
 

3453
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:18,789
just
pick a

3454
00:59:18,789 --> 00:59:18,799
pick a
 

3455
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:21,109
pick a
pick a thing that everyone can agree

3456
00:59:21,109 --> 00:59:21,119
pick a thing that everyone can agree
 

3457
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:23,510
pick a thing that everyone can agree
it's kind of cool and it's really hard

3458
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:23,520
it's kind of cool and it's really hard
 

3459
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,670
it's kind of cool and it's really hard
and do that and then you'll have like

3460
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:25,680
and do that and then you'll have like
 

3461
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,030
and do that and then you'll have like
thousands of inventions that have

3462
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:27,040
thousands of inventions that have
 

3463
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,309
thousands of inventions that have
nothing to do with the thing that's

3464
00:59:28,309 --> 00:59:28,319
nothing to do with the thing that's
 

3465
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:30,549
nothing to do with the thing that's
right i think you should let

3466
00:59:30,549 --> 00:59:30,559
right i think you should let
 

3467
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:33,349
right i think you should let
curious scientists just follow what

3468
00:59:33,349 --> 00:59:33,359
curious scientists just follow what
 

3469
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:34,870
curious scientists just follow what
they're interested in to a certain

3470
00:59:34,870 --> 00:59:34,880
they're interested in to a certain
 

3471
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,230
they're interested in to a certain
extent you can't

3472
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:36,240
extent you can't
 

3473
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,750
extent you can't
you know in science we say we have

3474
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:37,760
you know in science we say we have
 

3475
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:39,510
you know in science we say we have
translational research where we say okay

3476
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:39,520
translational research where we say okay
 

3477
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,349
translational research where we say okay
here's some money go cure cancer or

3478
00:59:41,349 --> 00:59:41,359
here's some money go cure cancer or
 

3479
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:43,510
here's some money go cure cancer or
diabetes or heart disease whatever right

3480
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:43,520
diabetes or heart disease whatever right
 

3481
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,270
diabetes or heart disease whatever right
and that's fine but that often doesn't

3482
00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:45,280
and that's fine but that often doesn't
 

3483
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,510
and that's fine but that often doesn't
work out very well what works better is

3484
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:47,520
work out very well what works better is
 

3485
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,750
work out very well what works better is
to say here you're you have a good lab

3486
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:49,760
to say here you're you have a good lab
 

3487
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,030
to say here you're you have a good lab
you have a good track record here's some

3488
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:51,040
you have a good track record here's some
 

3489
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,150
you have a good track record here's some
money

3490
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:52,160
money
 

3491
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,789
money
or something and that's where pcr

crisper recombinant dna all that stuff
which has made the field explode that's

3496
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:00,000
which has made the field explode that's
 

3497
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,990
which has made the field explode that's
all it came from not from people saying

01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,630
all it came from not from people saying
i want to cure genetic diseases by gene

01:00:04,630 --> 01:00:04,640
i want to cure genetic diseases by gene
 

3501
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:06,789
i want to cure genetic diseases by gene
editing but by saying what are these

3502
01:00:06,789 --> 01:00:06,799
editing but by saying what are these
 

3503
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:09,910

yep

3506
01:00:10,950 --> 01:00:10,960
yep
 

3507
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:14,630
yep
can ask you a big philosophical question

3508
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:14,640
can ask you a big philosophical question
 

3509
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:17,430
can ask you a big philosophical question
so there's these deadly viruses they're

3510
01:00:17,430 --> 01:00:17,440
so there's these deadly viruses they're
 

3511
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,990
so there's these deadly viruses they're
not very transmissible

3512
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:20,000
not very transmissible
 

3513
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,030
not very transmissible
ebola rabies and then there's these less

3514
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:23,040
ebola rabies and then there's these less
 

3515
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:24,150
ebola rabies and then there's these less
deadly viruses that are very

3516
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:24,160
deadly viruses that are very
 

3517
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,589
deadly viruses that are very
transmissible

3518
01:00:25,589 --> 01:00:25,599
transmissible
 

3519
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:26,710
transmissible
um

3520
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:26,720
um
 

3521
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:29,750
um
like uh like covid is i guess kind of

3522
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:29,760
like uh like covid is i guess kind of
 

3523
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,030
like uh like covid is i guess kind of
borderline

3524
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:31,040
borderline
 

3525
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:31,829
borderline
but

3526
01:00:31,829 --> 01:00:31,839
but
 

3527
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:34,069
but
uh why isn't there

3528
01:00:34,069 --> 01:00:34,079
uh why isn't there
 

3529
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:38,230
uh why isn't there
super transmissible super deadly viruses

3530
01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:38,240
super transmissible super deadly viruses
 

3531
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,309
super transmissible super deadly viruses
i think if you compare stars one and two

3532
01:00:40,309 --> 01:00:40,319
i think if you compare stars one and two
 

3533
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:41,270
i think if you compare stars one and two
you get

3534
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:41,280
you get
 

3535
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,990
you get
somewhat of an answer right sars one was

3536
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:44,000
somewhat of an answer right sars one was
 

3537
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,510
somewhat of an answer right sars one was
more deadly

3538
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:45,520
more deadly
 

3539
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:47,030
more deadly
in fact

3540
01:00:47,030 --> 01:00:47,040
in fact
 

3541
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:48,630
in fact
over half of the time

3542
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:48,640
over half of the time
 

3543
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,309
over half of the time
when people were infected

3544
01:00:50,309 --> 01:00:50,319
when people were infected
 

3545
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:51,910
when people were infected
they ended up in the hospital because

3546
01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:51,920
they ended up in the hospital because
 

3547
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,430
they ended up in the hospital because
they were that sick

3548
01:00:53,430 --> 01:00:53,440
they were that sick
 

3549
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:55,510
they were that sick
and then

3550
01:00:55,510 --> 01:00:55,520
and then
 

3551
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,349
and then
the peak of virus shedding from them

3552
01:00:57,349 --> 01:00:57,359
the peak of virus shedding from them
 

3553
01:00:57,359 --> 01:00:59,270
the peak of virus shedding from them
happened long after they went in the

3554
01:00:59,270 --> 01:00:59,280
happened long after they went in the
 

3555
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,589
happened long after they went in the
hospital so it's easy to contain

3556
01:01:01,589 --> 01:01:01,599
hospital so it's easy to contain
 

3557
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:03,190
hospital so it's easy to contain
uh the infection when you're in a

3558
01:01:03,190 --> 01:01:03,200
uh the infection when you're in a
 

3559
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,549
uh the infection when you're in a
hospital right

3560
01:01:04,549 --> 01:01:04,559
hospital right
 

3561
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:06,390
hospital right
there was not much

3562
01:01:06,390 --> 01:01:06,400
there was not much
 

3563
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,589
there was not much
pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic

3564
01:01:09,589 --> 01:01:09,599
pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic
 

3565
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:12,150
pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic
shedding with sars1 and shedding means

3566
01:01:12,150 --> 01:01:12,160
shedding with sars1 and shedding means
 

3567
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,309
shedding with sars1 and shedding means
you you're in you become infectious so

3568
01:01:14,309 --> 01:01:14,319
you you're in you become infectious so
 

3569
01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:16,470
you you're in you become infectious so
in a respiratory virus you're you inhale

3570
01:01:16,470 --> 01:01:16,480
in a respiratory virus you're you inhale
 

3571
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,710
in a respiratory virus you're you inhale
the droplets with virus and they they

3572
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:18,720
the droplets with virus and they they
 

3573
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,470
the droplets with virus and they they
reproduce in your upper respiratory

3574
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:20,480
reproduce in your upper respiratory
 

3575
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,789
reproduce in your upper respiratory
tract what we call the nasopharynx right

3576
01:01:22,789 --> 01:01:22,799
tract what we call the nasopharynx right
 

3577
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:24,390
tract what we call the nasopharynx right
the nose and going back to that little

3578
01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:24,400
the nose and going back to that little
 

3579
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,870
the nose and going back to that little
cavity just above your mouth

3580
01:01:26,870 --> 01:01:26,880
cavity just above your mouth
 

3581
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,470
cavity just above your mouth
so the virus reproduces really well and

3582
01:01:28,470 --> 01:01:28,480
so the virus reproduces really well and
 

3583
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,069
so the virus reproduces really well and
then as you talk and sneeze and cough

3584
01:01:30,069 --> 01:01:30,079
then as you talk and sneeze and cough
 

3585
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:32,150
then as you talk and sneeze and cough
you expel droplets and then those are

3586
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:32,160
you expel droplets and then those are
 

3587
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,069
you expel droplets and then those are
inhaled by other people and then they

3588
01:01:34,069 --> 01:01:34,079
inhaled by other people and then they
 

3589
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:35,829
inhaled by other people and then they
reproduce and

3590
01:01:35,829 --> 01:01:35,839
reproduce and
 

3591
01:01:35,839 --> 01:01:38,950
reproduce and
for sars 2 we now know there's a lot of

3592
01:01:38,950 --> 01:01:38,960
for sars 2 we now know there's a lot of
 

3593
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,549
for sars 2 we now know there's a lot of
reproduction just before you feel

3594
01:01:40,549 --> 01:01:40,559
reproduction just before you feel
 

3595
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:44,069
reproduction just before you feel
anything if at all so there's a lot of

3596
01:01:44,069 --> 01:01:44,079
anything if at all so there's a lot of
 

3597
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:46,950
anything if at all so there's a lot of
shedding and transmission before you get

3598
01:01:46,950 --> 01:01:46,960
shedding and transmission before you get
 

3599
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,789
shedding and transmission before you get
symptomatic and many people don't ever

3600
01:01:48,789 --> 01:01:48,799
symptomatic and many people don't ever
 

3601
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:50,870
symptomatic and many people don't ever
get symptomatic right so they spread

3602
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:50,880
get symptomatic right so they spread
 

3603
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,789
get symptomatic right so they spread
really easily

3604
01:01:52,789 --> 01:01:52,799
really easily
 

3605
01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:55,430
really easily
so that explains why some viruses can

3606
01:01:55,430 --> 01:01:55,440
so that explains why some viruses can
 

3607
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:57,589
so that explains why some viruses can
transmit a lot better than others and if

3608
01:01:57,589 --> 01:01:57,599
transmit a lot better than others and if
 

3609
01:01:57,599 --> 01:01:59,990
transmit a lot better than others and if
one happens to knock you out

3610
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:00,000
one happens to knock you out
 

3611
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,270
one happens to knock you out
then you're never going to transmit

3612
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:01,280
then you're never going to transmit
 

3613
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:02,549
then you're never going to transmit
because you're in the hospital like sar

3614
01:02:02,549 --> 01:02:02,559
because you're in the hospital like sar
 

3615
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:05,990
because you're in the hospital like sar
as one but why can't you have both why

3616
01:02:05,990 --> 01:02:06,000
as one but why can't you have both why
 

3617
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,990
as one but why can't you have both why
can't you just wait a while before he

3618
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:08,000
can't you just wait a while before he
 

3619
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,349
can't you just wait a while before he
knocks you out but when it knocks you

3620
01:02:09,349 --> 01:02:09,359
knocks you out but when it knocks you
 

3621
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:11,589
knocks you out but when it knocks you
out it really kills you that's that is a

3622
01:02:11,589 --> 01:02:11,599
out it really kills you that's that is a
 

3623
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:14,069
out it really kills you that's that is a
philosophical question right because

3624
01:02:14,069 --> 01:02:14,079
philosophical question right because
 

3625
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:15,990
philosophical question right because
we could talk about why we haven't

3626
01:02:15,990 --> 01:02:16,000
we could talk about why we haven't
 

3627
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,950
we could talk about why we haven't
observed it i mean one one issue is that

3628
01:02:18,950 --> 01:02:18,960
observed it i mean one one issue is that
 

3629
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:21,589
observed it i mean one one issue is that
if you uh

3630
01:02:21,589 --> 01:02:21,599
if you uh
 

3631
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:23,990
if you uh
if you're killed too quickly by a highly

3632
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:24,000
if you're killed too quickly by a highly
 

3633
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,670
if you're killed too quickly by a highly
lethal virus

3634
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:25,680
lethal virus
 

3635
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,109
lethal virus
you're not going to transmit it very

3636
01:02:27,109 --> 01:02:27,119
you're not going to transmit it very
 

3637
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:29,430
you're not going to transmit it very
well right so ebola can kill you quite

3638
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:29,440
well right so ebola can kill you quite
 

3639
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:30,950
well right so ebola can kill you quite
rapidly

3640
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:30,960
rapidly
 

3641
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:34,870
rapidly
and most of the transmission occurs

3642
01:02:34,870 --> 01:02:34,880
and most of the transmission occurs
 

3643
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:37,109
and most of the transmission occurs
when people are being cared for at home

3644
01:02:37,109 --> 01:02:37,119
when people are being cared for at home
 

3645
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:39,589
when people are being cared for at home
or in hospitals the doctors and nurses

3646
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:39,599
or in hospitals the doctors and nurses
 

3647
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:41,910
or in hospitals the doctors and nurses
get virus but people walking around

3648
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:41,920
get virus but people walking around
 

3649
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:43,190
get virus but people walking around
you're not walking around when you have

3650
01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:43,200
you're not walking around when you have
 

3651
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,029
you're not walking around when you have
ebola you're too sick

3652
01:02:45,029 --> 01:02:45,039
ebola you're too sick
 

3653
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:47,270
ebola you're too sick
you know you have black bloody diarrhea

3654
01:02:47,270 --> 01:02:47,280
you know you have black bloody diarrhea
 

3655
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,109
you know you have black bloody diarrhea
you're vomiting you're

3656
01:02:49,109 --> 01:02:49,119
you're vomiting you're
 

3657
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:51,829
you're vomiting you're
you're bleeding from your skin and

3658
01:02:51,829 --> 01:02:51,839
you're bleeding from your skin and
 

3659
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:53,670
you're bleeding from your skin and
mucous membranes you're not walking

3660
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:53,680
mucous membranes you're not walking
 

3661
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:56,230
mucous membranes you're not walking
around not going to parties so

3662
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:56,240
around not going to parties so
 

3663
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:59,109
around not going to parties so
i think that's part of it that if if the

3664
01:02:59,109 --> 01:02:59,119
i think that's part of it that if if the
 

3665
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:00,870
i think that's part of it that if if the
infection is too lethal you're simply

3666
01:03:00,870 --> 01:03:00,880
infection is too lethal you're simply
 

3667
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:03,589
infection is too lethal you're simply
not a good transmitter and i think

3668
01:03:03,589 --> 01:03:03,599
not a good transmitter and i think
 

3669
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:06,390
not a good transmitter and i think
transmission is probably one of the most

3670
01:03:06,390 --> 01:03:06,400
transmission is probably one of the most
 

3671
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,150
transmission is probably one of the most
powerful selection

3672
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:08,160
powerful selection
 

3673
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,309
powerful selection
forces for viruses because of ours

3674
01:03:10,309 --> 01:03:10,319
forces for viruses because of ours
 

3675
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:12,950
forces for viruses because of ours
always has to have find a new host if it

3676
01:03:12,950 --> 01:03:12,960
always has to have find a new host if it
 

3677
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:13,990
always has to have find a new host if it
doesn't

3678
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:14,000
doesn't
 

3679
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,549
doesn't
it's a startup that fails right if it

3680
01:03:16,549 --> 01:03:16,559
it's a startup that fails right if it
 

3681
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:18,950
it's a startup that fails right if it
doesn't find a new host it's gone and so

3682
01:03:18,950 --> 01:03:18,960
doesn't find a new host it's gone and so
 

3683
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,270
doesn't find a new host it's gone and so
anything that makes the virus transmit

3684
01:03:21,270 --> 01:03:21,280
anything that makes the virus transmit
 

3685
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:22,470
anything that makes the virus transmit
better

3686
01:03:22,470 --> 01:03:22,480
better
 

3687
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:25,510
better
is going to help it and if killing you

3688
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:25,520
is going to help it and if killing you
 

3689
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:27,589
is going to help it and if killing you
being less lethal is part of that that

3690
01:03:27,589 --> 01:03:27,599
being less lethal is part of that that
 

3691
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:30,230
being less lethal is part of that that
works too so there's a strong selection

3692
01:03:30,230 --> 01:03:30,240
works too so there's a strong selection
 

3693
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,630
works too so there's a strong selection
pressure against being lethal i think

3694
01:03:32,630 --> 01:03:32,640
pressure against being lethal i think
 

3695
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,470
pressure against being lethal i think
there's a strong selection of

3696
01:03:34,470 --> 01:03:34,480
there's a strong selection of
 

3697
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:36,630
there's a strong selection of
pressure against being lethal and

3698
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:36,640
pressure against being lethal and
 

3699
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:38,710
pressure against being lethal and
being more transmissible

3700
01:03:38,710 --> 01:03:38,720
being more transmissible
 

3701
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,069
being more transmissible
those two

3702
01:03:40,069 --> 01:03:40,079
those two
 

3703
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:41,910
those two
seem to work in opposite ways and now we

3704
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:41,920
seem to work in opposite ways and now we
 

3705
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:43,270
seem to work in opposite ways and now we
don't have a lot of data to support this

3706
01:03:43,270 --> 01:03:43,280
don't have a lot of data to support this
 

3707
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:44,950
don't have a lot of data to support this
this is kind of a

3708
01:03:44,950 --> 01:03:44,960
this is kind of a
 

3709
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:45,910
this is kind of a
thought

3710
01:03:45,910 --> 01:03:45,920
thought
 

3711
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,990
thought
experiment but there is one

3712
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:48,000
experiment but there is one
 

3713
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,470
experiment but there is one
experiment done in australia

3714
01:03:50,470 --> 01:03:50,480
experiment done in australia
 

3715
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:52,309
experiment done in australia
many years ago i don't know if you know

3716
01:03:52,309 --> 01:03:52,319
many years ago i don't know if you know
 

3717
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:53,270
many years ago i don't know if you know
this but

3718
01:03:53,270 --> 01:03:53,280
this but
 

3719
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:55,750
this but
in the 1800s the hunters in australia

3720
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:55,760
in the 1800s the hunters in australia
 

3721
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:57,589
in the 1800s the hunters in australia
imported a rabbit from europe so they

3722
01:03:57,589 --> 01:03:57,599
imported a rabbit from europe so they
 

3723
01:03:57,599 --> 01:03:59,349
imported a rabbit from europe so they
could hunt it

3724
01:03:59,349 --> 01:03:59,359
could hunt it
 

3725
01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:00,950
could hunt it
because the native rabbit in australia

3726
01:04:00,950 --> 01:04:00,960
because the native rabbit in australia
 

3727
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,390
because the native rabbit in australia
was too fast for them they couldn't

3728
01:04:02,390 --> 01:04:02,400
was too fast for them they couldn't
 

3729
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,150
was too fast for them they couldn't
shoot them so they brought in this

3730
01:04:04,150 --> 01:04:04,160
shoot them so they brought in this
 

3731
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:05,510
shoot them so they brought in this
european rabbit

3732
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:05,520
european rabbit
 

3733
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,670
european rabbit
and they they reproduced out of control

3734
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:07,680
and they they reproduced out of control
 

3735
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:09,270
and they they reproduced out of control
within a couple of years they were

3736
01:04:09,270 --> 01:04:09,280
within a couple of years they were
 

3737
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,349
within a couple of years they were
everywhere millions of rabbits and all

3738
01:04:11,349 --> 01:04:11,359
everywhere millions of rabbits and all
 

3739
01:04:11,359 --> 01:04:13,349
everywhere millions of rabbits and all
the watering holes

3740
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:13,359
the watering holes
 

3741
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:15,190
the watering holes
and now they had a problem so they

3742
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:15,200
and now they had a problem so they
 

3743
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:16,870
and now they had a problem so they
decided to use a virus to get rid of

3744
01:04:16,870 --> 01:04:16,880
decided to use a virus to get rid of
 

3745
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,950
decided to use a virus to get rid of
these excess rabbits

3746
01:04:18,950 --> 01:04:18,960
these excess rabbits
 

3747
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:21,829
these excess rabbits
and they used a virus a pox virus called

3748
01:04:21,829 --> 01:04:21,839
and they used a virus a pox virus called
 

3749
01:04:21,839 --> 01:04:24,150
and they used a virus a pox virus called
mixoma virus which is a natural virus of

3750
01:04:24,150 --> 01:04:24,160
mixoma virus which is a natural virus of
 

3751
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,710
mixoma virus which is a natural virus of
a different kind of rabbit but for these

3752
01:04:26,710 --> 01:04:26,720
a different kind of rabbit but for these
 

3753
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,710
a different kind of rabbit but for these
european rabbits it was quite lethal and

3754
01:04:28,710 --> 01:04:28,720
european rabbits it was quite lethal and
 

3755
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:30,470
european rabbits it was quite lethal and
it's spread by mosquitoes so they said

3756
01:04:30,470 --> 01:04:30,480
it's spread by mosquitoes so they said
 

3757
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:33,670
it's spread by mosquitoes so they said
okay let's let's uh release this virus

3758
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:33,680
okay let's let's uh release this virus
 

3759
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:36,430
okay let's let's uh release this virus
and the first year

3760
01:04:36,430 --> 01:04:36,440
and the first year
 

3761
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:40,230
and the first year
99.2 of the rabbits were killed

3762
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:40,240
99.2 of the rabbits were killed
 

3763
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:42,069
99.2 of the rabbits were killed
but that point eight percent that were

3764
01:04:42,069 --> 01:04:42,079
but that point eight percent that were
 

3765
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:43,430
but that point eight percent that were
left

3766
01:04:43,430 --> 01:04:43,440
left
 

3767
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:45,589
left
had some form of resistance they were

3768
01:04:45,589 --> 01:04:45,599
had some form of resistance they were
 

3769
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:47,349
had some form of resistance they were
variants you know every organism not

3770
01:04:47,349 --> 01:04:47,359
variants you know every organism not
 

3771
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:49,430
variants you know every organism not
just viruses makes mutants and there

3772
01:04:49,430 --> 01:04:49,440
just viruses makes mutants and there
 

3773
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,029
just viruses makes mutants and there
were some variants of the rabbits that

3774
01:04:51,029 --> 01:04:51,039
were some variants of the rabbits that
 

3775
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:53,510
were some variants of the rabbits that
could survive infection and then in

3776
01:04:53,510 --> 01:04:53,520
could survive infection and then in
 

3777
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,750
could survive infection and then in
subsequent years the virus became less

3778
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:55,760
subsequent years the virus became less
 

3779
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,510
subsequent years the virus became less
lethal and then

3780
01:04:57,510 --> 01:04:57,520
lethal and then
 

3781
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,190
lethal and then
the mosquitoes had a better shot of

3782
01:04:59,190 --> 01:04:59,200
the mosquitoes had a better shot of
 

3783
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,630
the mosquitoes had a better shot of
transmitting it from one rabbit to

3784
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:00,640
transmitting it from one rabbit to
 

3785
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,230
transmitting it from one rabbit to
another if the rabbit lived longer

3786
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:02,240
another if the rabbit lived longer
 

3787
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,470
another if the rabbit lived longer
that's the selection probably and so in

3788
01:05:04,470 --> 01:05:04,480
that's the selection probably and so in
 

3789
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:06,950
that's the selection probably and so in
the end the rabbits lived on the virus

3790
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:06,960
the end the rabbits lived on the virus
 

3791
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,470
the end the rabbits lived on the virus
was there it evolved to be more

3792
01:05:08,470 --> 01:05:08,480
was there it evolved to be more
 

3793
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:10,150
was there it evolved to be more
transmissible and less

3794
01:05:10,150 --> 01:05:10,160
transmissible and less
 

3795
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:10,950
transmissible and less
uh

3796
01:05:10,950 --> 01:05:10,960
uh
 

3797
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:13,349
uh
lethal so that is amazing that's the

3798
01:05:13,349 --> 01:05:13,359
lethal so that is amazing that's the
 

3799
01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:15,990
lethal so that is amazing that's the
only data that's amazing it is it is if

3800
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:16,000
only data that's amazing it is it is if
 

3801
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,910
only data that's amazing it is it is if
you take the time to

3802
01:05:17,910 --> 01:05:17,920
you take the time to
 

3803
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:20,069
you take the time to
look at it and see what's happened it is

3804
01:05:20,069 --> 01:05:20,079
look at it and see what's happened it is
 

3805
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:21,990
look at it and see what's happened it is
amazing it's also humbling that it just

3806
01:05:21,990 --> 01:05:22,000
amazing it's also humbling that it just
 

3807
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,510
amazing it's also humbling that it just
makes you realize humans are just a

3808
01:05:23,510 --> 01:05:23,520
makes you realize humans are just a
 

3809
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:26,309
makes you realize humans are just a
small part of the picture of course

3810
01:05:26,309 --> 01:05:26,319
small part of the picture of course
 

3811
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:28,309
small part of the picture of course
and we're wrecking it aren't we

3812
01:05:28,309 --> 01:05:28,319
and we're wrecking it aren't we
 

3813
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:30,789
and we're wrecking it aren't we
well i mean that's that

3814
01:05:30,789 --> 01:05:30,799
well i mean that's that
 

3815
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:32,309
well i mean that's that
we're not really

3816
01:05:32,309 --> 01:05:32,319
we're not really
 

3817
01:05:32,319 --> 01:05:34,549
we're not really
i mean viruses are wrecking it some way

3818
01:05:34,549 --> 01:05:34,559
i mean viruses are wrecking it some way
 

3819
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:35,829
i mean viruses are wrecking it some way
it's part of this we're not really

3820
01:05:35,829 --> 01:05:35,839
it's part of this we're not really
 

3821
01:05:35,839 --> 01:05:38,069
it's part of this we're not really
wrecking anything it's all part of it

3822
01:05:38,069 --> 01:05:38,079
wrecking anything it's all part of it
 

3823
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:40,230
wrecking anything it's all part of it
but you know when

3824
01:05:40,230 --> 01:05:40,240
but you know when
 

3825
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:42,309
but you know when
the ways that human exists encourages

3826
01:05:42,309 --> 01:05:42,319
the ways that human exists encourages
 

3827
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:44,390
the ways that human exists encourages
viruses to infect us right when we were

3828
01:05:44,390 --> 01:05:44,400
viruses to infect us right when we were
 

3829
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,829
viruses to infect us right when we were
hunter-gatherers living in bands of 100

3830
01:05:47,829 --> 01:05:47,839
hunter-gatherers living in bands of 100
 

3831
01:05:47,839 --> 01:05:50,390
hunter-gatherers living in bands of 100
people very few viruses because it was

3832
01:05:50,390 --> 01:05:50,400
people very few viruses because it was
 

3833
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,630
people very few viruses because it was
hard for the virus to go from one band

3834
01:05:52,630 --> 01:05:52,640
hard for the virus to go from one band
 

3835
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:55,029
hard for the virus to go from one band
to another and perhaps a hunter would

3836
01:05:55,029 --> 01:05:55,039
to another and perhaps a hunter would
 

3837
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:56,470
to another and perhaps a hunter would
one of these humans would get an animal

3838
01:05:56,470 --> 01:05:56,480
one of these humans would get an animal
 

3839
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:58,789
one of these humans would get an animal
and bring a virus at the camp and some

3840
01:05:58,789 --> 01:05:58,799
and bring a virus at the camp and some
 

3841
01:05:58,799 --> 01:06:00,069
and bring a virus at the camp and some
people would die but it would never

3842
01:06:00,069 --> 01:06:00,079
people would die but it would never
 

3843
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:01,510
people would die but it would never
spread

3844
01:06:01,510 --> 01:06:01,520
spread
 

3845
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,270
spread
to another and then when we started to

3846
01:06:03,270 --> 01:06:03,280
to another and then when we started to
 

3847
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,029
to another and then when we started to
congregate in cities we figured out

3848
01:06:05,029 --> 01:06:05,039
congregate in cities we figured out
 

3849
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:06,789
congregate in cities we figured out
agriculture and so forth and how to

3850
01:06:06,789 --> 01:06:06,799
agriculture and so forth and how to
 

3851
01:06:06,799 --> 01:06:08,390
agriculture and so forth and how to
harvest animals then we could get bigger

3852
01:06:08,390 --> 01:06:08,400
harvest animals then we could get bigger
 

3853
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,150
harvest animals then we could get bigger
and bigger populations and the viruses

3854
01:06:10,150 --> 01:06:10,160
and bigger populations and the viruses
 

3855
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:12,309
and bigger populations and the viruses
went crazy and they went from animals to

3856
01:06:12,309 --> 01:06:12,319
went crazy and they went from animals to
 

3857
01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:14,950
went crazy and they went from animals to
us so measles went from cows to humans

3858
01:06:14,950 --> 01:06:14,960
us so measles went from cows to humans
 

3859
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:17,430
us so measles went from cows to humans
when humans learned to domesticate cows

3860
01:06:17,430 --> 01:06:17,440
when humans learned to domesticate cows
 

3861
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,549
when humans learned to domesticate cows
and and started gathering in big cities

3862
01:06:20,549 --> 01:06:20,559
and and started gathering in big cities
 

3863
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:23,589
and and started gathering in big cities
yeah but now that humans are able to

3864
01:06:23,589 --> 01:06:23,599
yeah but now that humans are able to
 

3865
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:26,950
yeah but now that humans are able to
communicate and travel globally

3866
01:06:26,950 --> 01:06:26,960
communicate and travel globally
 

3867
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:28,630
communicate and travel globally
the viruses become more and more

3868
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:28,640
the viruses become more and more
 

3869
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:31,670
the viruses become more and more
dangerous transmissible

3870
01:06:31,670 --> 01:06:31,680
dangerous transmissible
 

3871
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,349
dangerous transmissible
thereby if you look at earth as an

3872
01:06:33,349 --> 01:06:33,359
thereby if you look at earth as an
 

3873
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:35,270
thereby if you look at earth as an
organism thereby pushing humans to be

3874
01:06:35,270 --> 01:06:35,280
organism thereby pushing humans to be
 

3875
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:36,710
organism thereby pushing humans to be
more innovative

3876
01:06:36,710 --> 01:06:36,720
more innovative
 

3877
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:38,630
more innovative
create alpha fold two and three and four

3878
01:06:38,630 --> 01:06:38,640
create alpha fold two and three and four
 

3879
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:40,630
create alpha fold two and three and four
and five create better systems and

3880
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:40,640
and five create better systems and
 

3881
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:42,789
and five create better systems and
eventually there's rockets that keep

3882
01:06:42,789 --> 01:06:42,799
eventually there's rockets that keep
 

3883
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:45,109
eventually there's rockets that keep
flying from earth and eventually

3884
01:06:45,109 --> 01:06:45,119
flying from earth and eventually
 

3885
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:47,349
flying from earth and eventually
uh the virus is becoming super dangerous

3886
01:06:47,349 --> 01:06:47,359
uh the virus is becoming super dangerous
 

3887
01:06:47,359 --> 01:06:48,470
uh the virus is becoming super dangerous
and threatening all of human

3888
01:06:48,470 --> 01:06:48,480
and threatening all of human
 

3889
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:50,789
and threatening all of human
civilization will force it to become a

3890
01:06:50,789 --> 01:06:50,799
civilization will force it to become a
 

3891
01:06:50,799 --> 01:06:52,710
civilization will force it to become a
multi-planetary species and this

3892
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:52,720
multi-planetary species and this
 

3893
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:54,710
multi-planetary species and this
organism starts expanding so i think

3894
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:54,720
organism starts expanding so i think
 

3895
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:57,029
organism starts expanding so i think
it's a feature not a bug i don't know

3896
01:06:57,029 --> 01:06:57,039
it's a feature not a bug i don't know
 

3897
01:06:57,039 --> 01:06:59,589
it's a feature not a bug i don't know
um well i think that we have

3898
01:06:59,589 --> 01:06:59,599
um well i think that we have
 

3899
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:03,029
um well i think that we have
our early probably the most of the when

3900
01:07:03,029 --> 01:07:03,039
our early probably the most of the when
 

3901
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:06,069
our early probably the most of the when
we're studying viruses since 1900 right

3902
01:07:06,069 --> 01:07:06,079
we're studying viruses since 1900 right
 

3903
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:08,069
we're studying viruses since 1900 right
most of that time was because of

3904
01:07:08,069 --> 01:07:08,079
most of that time was because of
 

3905
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:10,950
most of that time was because of
diseases they caused the first viruses

3906
01:07:10,950 --> 01:07:10,960
diseases they caused the first viruses
 

3907
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,950
diseases they caused the first viruses
discovered yellow fever

3908
01:07:12,950 --> 01:07:12,960
discovered yellow fever
 

3909
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:15,270
discovered yellow fever
virus smallpox

3910
01:07:15,270 --> 01:07:15,280
virus smallpox
 

3911
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:16,789
virus smallpox
poliovirus

3912
01:07:16,789 --> 01:07:16,799
poliovirus
 

3913
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:18,630
poliovirus
influenza virus

3914
01:07:18,630 --> 01:07:18,640
influenza virus
 

3915
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:21,029
influenza virus
those were all because people got sick

3916
01:07:21,029 --> 01:07:21,039
those were all because people got sick
 

3917
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:22,710
those were all because people got sick
and they said oh look this is a virus

3918
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:22,720
and they said oh look this is a virus
 

3919
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:26,069
and they said oh look this is a virus
that's associated with it and so we got

3920
01:07:26,069 --> 01:07:26,079
that's associated with it and so we got
 

3921
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:28,789
that's associated with it and so we got
good at learning how to take care of

3922
01:07:28,789 --> 01:07:28,799
good at learning how to take care of
 

3923
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:30,630
good at learning how to take care of
these infections making vaccines and so

3924
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:30,640
these infections making vaccines and so
 

3925
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:32,150
these infections making vaccines and so
forth over the years and it's only in

3926
01:07:32,150 --> 01:07:32,160
forth over the years and it's only in
 

3927
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:34,789
forth over the years and it's only in
the last 20 years that we recognize that

3928
01:07:34,789 --> 01:07:34,799
the last 20 years that we recognize that
 

3929
01:07:34,799 --> 01:07:36,150
the last 20 years that we recognize that
there are more viruses out there that

3930
01:07:36,150 --> 01:07:36,160
there are more viruses out there that
 

3931
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:38,230
there are more viruses out there that
are far more interesting perhaps but

3932
01:07:38,230 --> 01:07:38,240
are far more interesting perhaps but
 

3933
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:39,910
are far more interesting perhaps but
we've learned how to deal with the bad

3934
01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:39,920
we've learned how to deal with the bad
 

3935
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:42,230
we've learned how to deal with the bad
ones for sure so we talked about what is

3936
01:07:42,230 --> 01:07:42,240
ones for sure so we talked about what is
 

3937
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:43,349
ones for sure so we talked about what is
a virus

3938
01:07:43,349 --> 01:07:43,359
a virus
 

3939
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:44,870
a virus
we talked about some of the most

3940
01:07:44,870 --> 01:07:44,880
we talked about some of the most
 

3941
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:47,750
we talked about some of the most
dangerous and deadly viruses can we zoom

3942
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:47,760
dangerous and deadly viruses can we zoom
 

3943
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,510
dangerous and deadly viruses can we zoom
in and talk about

3944
01:07:49,510 --> 01:07:49,520
in and talk about
 

3945
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:52,069
in and talk about
covin-19 virus sure i don't know what

3946
01:07:52,069 --> 01:07:52,079
covin-19 virus sure i don't know what
 

3947
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:54,309
covin-19 virus sure i don't know what
your preferred name is but well

3948
01:07:54,309 --> 01:07:54,319
your preferred name is but well
 

3949
01:07:54,319 --> 01:07:57,029
your preferred name is but well
right the virus is cov2 which is hard

3950
01:07:57,029 --> 01:07:57,039
right the virus is cov2 which is hard
 

3951
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:59,750
right the virus is cov2 which is hard
it's long right and then covet 19 is the

3952
01:07:59,750 --> 01:07:59,760
it's long right and then covet 19 is the
 

3953
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:01,750
it's long right and then covet 19 is the
disease so you could say the virus of

3954
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:01,760
disease so you could say the virus of
 

3955
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:03,750
disease so you could say the virus of
covet 19 that's fine it's a virus of

3956
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:03,760
covet 19 that's fine it's a virus of
 

3957
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:05,510
covet 19 that's fine it's a virus of
cova-19 but for the purpose of this

3958
01:08:05,510 --> 01:08:05,520
cova-19 but for the purpose of this
 

3959
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:07,029
cova-19 but for the purpose of this
conversation we'll every once in a while

3960
01:08:07,029 --> 01:08:07,039
conversation we'll every once in a while
 

3961
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:10,549
conversation we'll every once in a while
i'll just say kovid it's fine no problem

3962
01:08:10,549 --> 01:08:10,559
i'll just say kovid it's fine no problem
 

3963
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:14,150
i'll just say kovid it's fine no problem
what is this virus from uh

3964
01:08:14,150 --> 01:08:14,160
what is this virus from uh
 

3965
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:16,070
what is this virus from uh
i don't know how many ways we can talk

3966
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:16,080
i don't know how many ways we can talk
 

3967
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:19,590
i don't know how many ways we can talk
about it i think from a basic structural

3968
01:08:19,590 --> 01:08:19,600
about it i think from a basic structural
 

3969
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:21,669
about it i think from a basic structural
like the the varian

3970
01:08:21,669 --> 01:08:21,679
like the the varian
 

3971
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:22,950
like the the varian
structure

3972
01:08:22,950 --> 01:08:22,960
structure
 

3973
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:25,349
structure
biological structure perspective what is

3974
01:08:25,349 --> 01:08:25,359
biological structure perspective what is
 

3975
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:27,990
biological structure perspective what is
it what are its variants

3976
01:08:27,990 --> 01:08:28,000
it what are its variants
 

3977
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,149
it what are its variants
can you describe the basics the

3978
01:08:30,149 --> 01:08:30,159
can you describe the basics the
 

3979
01:08:30,159 --> 01:08:31,990
can you describe the basics the
important characteristics of the virus

3980
01:08:31,990 --> 01:08:32,000
important characteristics of the virus
 

3981
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,110
important characteristics of the virus
so viruses are classified by humans just

3982
01:08:35,110 --> 01:08:35,120
so viruses are classified by humans just
 

3983
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:37,189
so viruses are classified by humans just
to make it easier to keep track of them

3984
01:08:37,189 --> 01:08:37,199
to make it easier to keep track of them
 

3985
01:08:37,199 --> 01:08:40,870
to make it easier to keep track of them
right so this is a corona virus which is

3986
01:08:40,870 --> 01:08:40,880
right so this is a corona virus which is
 

3987
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:42,229
right so this is a corona virus which is
because

3988
01:08:42,229 --> 01:08:42,239
because
 

3989
01:08:42,239 --> 01:08:43,669
because
when they were first

3990
01:08:43,669 --> 01:08:43,679
when they were first
 

3991
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:45,030
when they were first
discovered

3992
01:08:45,030 --> 01:08:45,040
discovered
 

3993
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:46,709
discovered
i think the first ones were animal

3994
01:08:46,709 --> 01:08:46,719
i think the first ones were animal
 

3995
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:48,390
i think the first ones were animal
coronaviruses

3996
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:48,400
coronaviruses
 

3997
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:49,749
coronaviruses
they looked at them in the electron

3998
01:08:49,749 --> 01:08:49,759
they looked at them in the electron
 

3999
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:51,269
they looked at them in the electron
microscope and it looked like the solar

4000
01:08:51,269 --> 01:08:51,279
microscope and it looked like the solar
 

4001
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:53,510
microscope and it looked like the solar
corona and that's all there is to it and

4002
01:08:53,510 --> 01:08:53,520
corona and that's all there is to it and
 

4003
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:54,870
corona and that's all there is to it and
i have to say that

4004
01:08:54,870 --> 01:08:54,880
i have to say that
 

4005
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:57,189
i have to say that
early in the outbreak the the

4006
01:08:57,189 --> 01:08:57,199
early in the outbreak the the
 

4007
01:08:57,199 --> 01:08:59,189
early in the outbreak the the
place with the highest cereal positivity

4008
01:08:59,189 --> 01:08:59,199
place with the highest cereal positivity
 

4009
01:08:59,199 --> 01:09:02,149
place with the highest cereal positivity
in the u.s for a while 68

4010
01:09:02,149 --> 01:09:02,159
in the u.s for a while 68
 

4011
01:09:02,159 --> 01:09:03,910
in the u.s for a while 68
was a working-class neighborhood in new

4012
01:09:03,910 --> 01:09:03,920
was a working-class neighborhood in new
 

4013
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,390
was a working-class neighborhood in new
york city called corona

4014
01:09:06,390 --> 01:09:06,400
york city called corona
 

4015
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:08,309
york city called corona
can you can you beat that right that's

4016
01:09:08,309 --> 01:09:08,319
can you can you beat that right that's
 

4017
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:11,189
can you can you beat that right that's
crazy yeah so coronaviruses they have

4018
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:11,199
crazy yeah so coronaviruses they have
 

4019
01:09:11,199 --> 01:09:12,709
crazy yeah so coronaviruses they have
membranes right we talked about

4020
01:09:12,709 --> 01:09:12,719
membranes right we talked about
 

4021
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:14,390
membranes right we talked about
membranes they have spiked proteins in

4022
01:09:14,390 --> 01:09:14,400
membranes they have spiked proteins in
 

4023
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,229
membranes they have spiked proteins in
the membrane so they can attach to cells

4024
01:09:16,229 --> 01:09:16,239
the membrane so they can attach to cells
 

4025
01:09:16,239 --> 01:09:18,950
the membrane so they can attach to cells
and inside they have rna

4026
01:09:18,950 --> 01:09:18,960
and inside they have rna
 

4027
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,030
and inside they have rna
and they are the viruses with the

4028
01:09:21,030 --> 01:09:21,040
and they are the viruses with the
 

4029
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:23,510
and they are the viruses with the
longest rna that we know of no none

4030
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:23,520
longest rna that we know of no none
 

4031
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,030
longest rna that we know of no none
other comes close

4032
01:09:25,030 --> 01:09:25,040
other comes close
 

4033
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:26,870
other comes close
for some reason

4034
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:26,880
for some reason
 

4035
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,510
for some reason
they're able to maintain thirty thousand

4036
01:09:29,510 --> 01:09:29,520
they're able to maintain thirty thousand
 

4037
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:32,789
they're able to maintain thirty thousand
so sars cov2 rnas thirty thousand bases

4038
01:09:32,789 --> 01:09:32,799
so sars cov2 rnas thirty thousand bases
 

4039
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:35,269
so sars cov2 rnas thirty thousand bases
of rna and some of the other coronas are

4040
01:09:35,269 --> 01:09:35,279
of rna and some of the other coronas are
 

4041
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:38,229
of rna and some of the other coronas are
even longer 40 000. this is a

4042
01:09:38,229 --> 01:09:38,239
even longer 40 000. this is a
 

4043
01:09:38,239 --> 01:09:41,030
even longer 40 000. this is a
coronas our family of viruses that

4044
01:09:41,030 --> 01:09:41,040
coronas our family of viruses that
 

4045
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:42,309
coronas our family of viruses that
included

4046
01:09:42,309 --> 01:09:42,319
included
 

4047
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:43,110
included
the

4048
01:09:43,110 --> 01:09:43,120
the
 

4049
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:45,110
the
what the the one you mentioned before

4050
01:09:45,110 --> 01:09:45,120
what the the one you mentioned before
 

4051
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:48,070
what the the one you mentioned before
version one cesares kovi one yeah kobe

4052
01:09:48,070 --> 01:09:48,080
version one cesares kovi one yeah kobe
 

4053
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:50,309
version one cesares kovi one yeah kobe
one and i guess other ones so the first

4054
01:09:50,309 --> 01:09:50,319
one and i guess other ones so the first
 

4055
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:52,470
one and i guess other ones so the first
we first learned of them in animals a

4056
01:09:52,470 --> 01:09:52,480
we first learned of them in animals a
 

4057
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:54,870
we first learned of them in animals a
lot of animals pigs and

4058
01:09:54,870 --> 01:09:54,880
lot of animals pigs and
 

4059
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:55,830
lot of animals pigs and
uh

4060
01:09:55,830 --> 01:09:55,840
uh
 

4061
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:58,390
uh
cows and horses have coronaviruses and

4062
01:09:58,390 --> 01:09:58,400
cows and horses have coronaviruses and
 

4063
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:59,189
cows and horses have coronaviruses and
then

4064
01:09:59,189 --> 01:09:59,199
then
 

4065
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:01,910
then
uh in their 60s we discovered a couple

4066
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:01,920
uh in their 60s we discovered a couple
 

4067
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:04,709
uh in their 60s we discovered a couple
of human coronaviruses that just caused

4068
01:10:04,709 --> 01:10:04,719
of human coronaviruses that just caused
 

4069
01:10:04,719 --> 01:10:06,550
of human coronaviruses that just caused
colds very mild colds that you wouldn't

4070
01:10:06,550 --> 01:10:06,560
colds very mild colds that you wouldn't
 

4071
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:08,790
colds very mild colds that you wouldn't
even think twice about right

4072
01:10:08,790 --> 01:10:08,800
even think twice about right
 

4073
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,149
even think twice about right
and then suddenly

4074
01:10:10,149 --> 01:10:10,159
and then suddenly
 

4075
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:11,669
and then suddenly
in 20

4076
01:10:11,669 --> 01:10:11,679
in 20
 

4077
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:14,870
in 20
2003 there's this outbreak of

4078
01:10:14,870 --> 01:10:14,880
2003 there's this outbreak of
 

4079
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:18,550
2003 there's this outbreak of
severe respiratory disease in in china

4080
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:18,560
severe respiratory disease in in china
 

4081
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:21,430
severe respiratory disease in in china
and you know they it started in november

4082
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:21,440
and you know they it started in november
 

4083
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:22,709
and you know they it started in november
and they didn't tell the world until

4084
01:10:22,709 --> 01:10:22,719
and they didn't tell the world until
 

4085
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:23,910
and they didn't tell the world until
february

4086
01:10:23,910 --> 01:10:23,920
february
 

4087
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:24,709
february
and

4088
01:10:24,709 --> 01:10:24,719
and
 

4089
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:26,390
and
that was really bad because it was

4090
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:26,400
that was really bad because it was
 

4091
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:28,470
that was really bad because it was
already spreading by the time they

4092
01:10:28,470 --> 01:10:28,480
already spreading by the time they
 

4093
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:31,110
already spreading by the time they
told people about it but

4094
01:10:31,110 --> 01:10:31,120
told people about it but
 

4095
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:32,470
told people about it but
this

4096
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:32,480
this
 

4097
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:34,790
this
went to many 29 different countries only

4098
01:10:34,790 --> 01:10:34,800
went to many 29 different countries only
 

4099
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:36,790
went to many 29 different countries only
8 000 people were infected and then it

4100
01:10:36,790 --> 01:10:36,800
8 000 people were infected and then it
 

4101
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,390
8 000 people were infected and then it
stopped

4102
01:10:38,390 --> 01:10:38,400
stopped
 

4103
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:41,189
stopped
and that was the first time we saw

4104
01:10:41,189 --> 01:10:41,199
and that was the first time we saw
 

4105
01:10:41,199 --> 01:10:44,310
and that was the first time we saw
an epidemic coronavirus and it what they

4106
01:10:44,310 --> 01:10:44,320
an epidemic coronavirus and it what they
 

4107
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:46,630
an epidemic coronavirus and it what they
did afterwards is they said okay

4108
01:10:46,630 --> 01:10:46,640
did afterwards is they said okay
 

4109
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:47,910
did afterwards is they said okay
it looks like it came from the meat

4110
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:47,920
it looks like it came from the meat
 

4111
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:49,590
it looks like it came from the meat
markets they have live meat markets in

4112
01:10:49,590 --> 01:10:49,600
markets they have live meat markets in
 

4113
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:52,550
markets they have live meat markets in
guangzhou in the south of china

4114
01:10:52,550 --> 01:10:52,560
guangzhou in the south of china
 

4115
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:54,310
guangzhou in the south of china
where you can go and pick out an animal

4116
01:10:54,310 --> 01:10:54,320
where you can go and pick out an animal
 

4117
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:55,510
where you can go and pick out an animal
and the guy will

4118
01:10:55,510 --> 01:10:55,520
and the guy will
 

4119
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:57,030
and the guy will
slaughter it for you and give it to you

4120
01:10:57,030 --> 01:10:57,040
slaughter it for you and give it to you
 

4121
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:58,149
slaughter it for you and give it to you
and then of course there's blood

4122
01:10:58,149 --> 01:10:58,159
and then of course there's blood
 

4123
01:10:58,159 --> 01:11:00,070
and then of course there's blood
everywhere and that's how they got

4124
01:11:00,070 --> 01:11:00,080
everywhere and that's how they got
 

4125
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:01,910
everywhere and that's how they got
infected and they figured out that

4126
01:11:01,910 --> 01:11:01,920
infected and they figured out that
 

4127
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:04,550
infected and they figured out that
there's this animal called a palm civet

4128
01:11:04,550 --> 01:11:04,560
there's this animal called a palm civet
 

4129
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:05,990
there's this animal called a palm civet
that was the source of virus the palm

4130
01:11:05,990 --> 01:11:06,000
that was the source of virus the palm
 

4131
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,110
that was the source of virus the palm
civets are shipped in from the

4132
01:11:07,110 --> 01:11:07,120
civets are shipped in from the
 

4133
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:09,510
civets are shipped in from the
countryside and they the palm civ

4134
01:11:09,510 --> 01:11:09,520
countryside and they the palm civ
 

4135
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:11,030
countryside and they the palm civ
somehow in the countryside got it from a

4136
01:11:11,030 --> 01:11:11,040
somehow in the countryside got it from a
 

4137
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:13,189
somehow in the countryside got it from a
bat so they went looking in caves in the

4138
01:11:13,189 --> 01:11:13,199
bat so they went looking in caves in the
 

4139
01:11:13,199 --> 01:11:15,750
bat so they went looking in caves in the
countryside and they found in one cave

4140
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:15,760
countryside and they found in one cave
 

4141
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:17,430
countryside and they found in one cave
all the viruses that could make up

4142
01:11:17,430 --> 01:11:17,440
all the viruses that could make up
 

4143
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:19,030
all the viruses that could make up
saurus one

4144
01:11:19,030 --> 01:11:19,040
saurus one
 

4145
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:21,510
saurus one
and that was 2000 and well i would say

4146
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:21,520
and that was 2000 and well i would say
 

4147
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:23,750
and that was 2000 and well i would say
took about five eight years after that

4148
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:23,760
took about five eight years after that
 

4149
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:25,669
took about five eight years after that
outbreak so that was the

4150
01:11:25,669 --> 01:11:25,679
outbreak so that was the
 

4151
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:26,470
outbreak so that was the
first

4152
01:11:26,470 --> 01:11:26,480
first
 

4153
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:29,990
first
hint that bats have coronaviruses that

4154
01:11:29,990 --> 01:11:30,000
hint that bats have coronaviruses that
 

4155
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,830
hint that bats have coronaviruses that
can infect people and cause problems

4156
01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:31,840
can infect people and cause problems
 

4157
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:32,790
can infect people and cause problems
right

4158
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:32,800
right
 

4159
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:35,510
right
and after that we should have been ready

4160
01:11:35,510 --> 01:11:35,520
and after that we should have been ready
 

4161
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:37,510
and after that we should have been ready
so didn't they already start developing

4162
01:11:37,510 --> 01:11:37,520
so didn't they already start developing
 

4163
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:39,990
so didn't they already start developing
vaccines yes so some people started

4164
01:11:39,990 --> 01:11:40,000
vaccines yes so some people started
 

4165
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,709
vaccines yes so some people started
making vaccines they tested them in in

4166
01:11:42,709 --> 01:11:42,719
making vaccines they tested them in in
 

4167
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:44,229
making vaccines they tested them in in
mice

4168
01:11:44,229 --> 01:11:44,239
mice
 

4169
01:11:44,239 --> 01:11:46,870
mice
but they never got into people

4170
01:11:46,870 --> 01:11:46,880
but they never got into people
 

4171
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:48,870
but they never got into people
and some people started working on

4172
01:11:48,870 --> 01:11:48,880
and some people started working on
 

4173
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,790
and some people started working on
anti-viral drugs

4174
01:11:50,790 --> 01:11:50,800
anti-viral drugs
 

4175
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:53,830
anti-viral drugs
nothing ever came of them

4176
01:11:53,830 --> 01:11:53,840
nothing ever came of them
 

4177
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:56,470
nothing ever came of them
you know industry there's no there's no

4178
01:11:56,470 --> 01:11:56,480
you know industry there's no there's no
 

4179
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:58,149
you know industry there's no there's no
disease it's gone why should we make

4180
01:11:58,149 --> 01:11:58,159
disease it's gone why should we make
 

4181
01:11:58,159 --> 01:12:01,510
disease it's gone why should we make
vaccines and drugs and nih in the u.s

4182
01:12:01,510 --> 01:12:01,520
vaccines and drugs and nih in the u.s
 

4183
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:03,510
vaccines and drugs and nih in the u.s
you submit a grant and they say it's too

4184
01:12:03,510 --> 01:12:03,520
you submit a grant and they say it's too
 

4185
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:05,110
you submit a grant and they say it's too
risky there's no none of this virus

4186
01:12:05,110 --> 01:12:05,120
risky there's no none of this virus
 

4187
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:06,229
risky there's no none of this virus
around so people were really

4188
01:12:06,229 --> 01:12:06,239
around so people were really
 

4189
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:08,229
around so people were really
short-sighted because i always say we

4190
01:12:08,229 --> 01:12:08,239
short-sighted because i always say we
 

4191
01:12:08,239 --> 01:12:09,430
short-sighted because i always say we
could have had

4192
01:12:09,430 --> 01:12:09,440
could have had
 

4193
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:12,630
could have had
antivirals for this absolutely yeah for

4194
01:12:12,630 --> 01:12:12,640
antivirals for this absolutely yeah for
 

4195
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:15,430
antivirals for this absolutely yeah for
sure no question in fact one the one

4196
01:12:15,430 --> 01:12:15,440
sure no question in fact one the one
 

4197
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:17,189
sure no question in fact one the one
antiviral that's in phase three it's

4198
01:12:17,189 --> 01:12:17,199
antiviral that's in phase three it's
 

4199
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:18,070
antiviral that's in phase three it's
called

4200
01:12:18,070 --> 01:12:18,080
called
 

4201
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:20,070
called
molnu pyravir

4202
01:12:20,070 --> 01:12:20,080
molnu pyravir
 

4203
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:21,750
molnu pyravir
it's the only one that you can take

4204
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:21,760
it's the only one that you can take
 

4205
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:24,070
it's the only one that you can take
orally it's a pill it looks really good

4206
01:12:24,070 --> 01:12:24,080
orally it's a pill it looks really good
 

4207
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:26,390
orally it's a pill it looks really good
that was developed five years ago but

4208
01:12:26,390 --> 01:12:26,400
that was developed five years ago but
 

4209
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:28,149
that was developed five years ago but
never taken into humans it could have

4210
01:12:28,149 --> 01:12:28,159
never taken into humans it could have
 

4211
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:29,189
never taken into humans it could have
been ready

4212
01:12:29,189 --> 01:12:29,199
been ready
 

4213
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:31,270
been ready
so we dropped the ball

4214
01:12:31,270 --> 01:12:31,280
so we dropped the ball
 

4215
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:34,830
so we dropped the ball
and then the next decade 2012 mers

4216
01:12:34,830 --> 01:12:34,840
and then the next decade 2012 mers
 

4217
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:37,350
and then the next decade 2012 mers
coronavirus comes

4218
01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:37,360
coronavirus comes
 

4219
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:39,030
coronavirus comes
comes up in the arabian peninsula this

4220
01:12:39,030 --> 01:12:39,040
comes up in the arabian peninsula this
 

4221
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:40,149
comes up in the arabian peninsula this
comes from

4222
01:12:40,149 --> 01:12:40,159
comes from
 

4223
01:12:40,159 --> 01:12:41,910
comes from
camels and infects people but probably

4224
01:12:41,910 --> 01:12:41,920
camels and infects people but probably
 

4225
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:44,709
camels and infects people but probably
the camels got it from bats originally

4226
01:12:44,709 --> 01:12:44,719
the camels got it from bats originally
 

4227
01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:46,149
the camels got it from bats originally
some time ago

4228
01:12:46,149 --> 01:12:46,159
some time ago
 

4229
01:12:46,159 --> 01:12:48,229
some time ago
but that never transmits

4230
01:12:48,229 --> 01:12:48,239
but that never transmits
 

4231
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:50,550
but that never transmits
from person to person very rarely

4232
01:12:50,550 --> 01:12:50,560
from person to person very rarely
 

4233
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:53,189
from person to person very rarely
every new little outbreak is a new

4234
01:12:53,189 --> 01:12:53,199
every new little outbreak is a new
 

4235
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:55,350
every new little outbreak is a new
infection from a camel

4236
01:12:55,350 --> 01:12:55,360
infection from a camel
 

4237
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:58,390
infection from a camel
so that was 2012 and now here we are

4238
01:12:58,390 --> 01:12:58,400
so that was 2012 and now here we are
 

4239
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,870
so that was 2012 and now here we are
2019 a new outbreak of respiratory

4240
01:13:00,870 --> 01:13:00,880
2019 a new outbreak of respiratory
 

4241
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:02,709
2019 a new outbreak of respiratory
disease in china

4242
01:13:02,709 --> 01:13:02,719
disease in china
 

4243
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:04,870
disease in china
and this one really

4244
01:13:04,870 --> 01:13:04,880
and this one really
 

4245
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,550
and this one really
goes all over the world

4246
01:13:06,550 --> 01:13:06,560
goes all over the world
 

4247
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:07,990
goes all over the world
where sars one could not it's a

4248
01:13:07,990 --> 01:13:08,000
where sars one could not it's a
 

4249
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,750
where sars one could not it's a
coronavirus you know it's different

4250
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:09,760
coronavirus you know it's different
 

4251
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,990
coronavirus you know it's different
enough from sars one that it has very

4252
01:13:11,990 --> 01:13:12,000
enough from sars one that it has very
 

4253
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,910
enough from sars one that it has very
different properties but it still has a

4254
01:13:13,910 --> 01:13:13,920
different properties but it still has a
 

4255
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:16,390
different properties but it still has a
membrane still has a very long

4256
01:13:16,390 --> 01:13:16,400
membrane still has a very long
 

4257
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,630
membrane still has a very long
rna in the middle and then it still has

4258
01:13:18,630 --> 01:13:18,640
rna in the middle and then it still has
 

4259
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:20,709
rna in the middle and then it still has
the spike proteins that's right what are

4260
01:13:20,709 --> 01:13:20,719
the spike proteins that's right what are
 

4261
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:23,189
the spike proteins that's right what are
the things that are what are the little

4262
01:13:23,189 --> 01:13:23,199
the things that are what are the little
 

4263
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:24,630
the things that are what are the little
unique things

4264
01:13:24,630 --> 01:13:24,640
unique things
 

4265
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:25,910
unique things
that make it

4266
01:13:25,910 --> 01:13:25,920
that make it
 

4267
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,750
that make it
that much more effective

4268
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:27,760
that much more effective
 

4269
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:30,550
that much more effective
to make it cause a pandemic of millions

4270
01:13:30,550 --> 01:13:30,560
to make it cause a pandemic of millions
 

4271
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:32,470
to make it cause a pandemic of millions
of people as opposed to sars one yeah

4272
01:13:32,470 --> 01:13:32,480
of people as opposed to sars one yeah
 

4273
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:34,229
of people as opposed to sars one yeah
well the genome

4274
01:13:34,229 --> 01:13:34,239
well the genome
 

4275
01:13:34,239 --> 01:13:35,430
well the genome
is

4276
01:13:35,430 --> 01:13:35,440
is
 

4277
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:38,709
is
20 different from source one say and in

4278
01:13:38,709 --> 01:13:38,719
20 different from source one say and in
 

4279
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:40,470
20 different from source one say and in
those bases there's some there are

4280
01:13:40,470 --> 01:13:40,480
those bases there's some there are
 

4281
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:42,310
those bases there's some there are
things that uh make it different from

4282
01:13:42,310 --> 01:13:42,320
things that uh make it different from
 

4283
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:44,070
things that uh make it different from
soros one it binds the same receptor

4284
01:13:44,070 --> 01:13:44,080
soros one it binds the same receptor
 

4285
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:46,310
soros one it binds the same receptor
ace2 on the cell surface so that's

4286
01:13:46,310 --> 01:13:46,320
ace2 on the cell surface so that's
 

4287
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:47,830
ace2 on the cell surface so that's
remarkable

4288
01:13:47,830 --> 01:13:47,840
remarkable
 

4289
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,990
remarkable
it has a lot of the same proteins

4290
01:13:49,990 --> 01:13:50,000
it has a lot of the same proteins
 

4291
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,510
it has a lot of the same proteins
they look similar like if you look at

4292
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:51,520
they look similar like if you look at
 

4293
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:54,070
they look similar like if you look at
the structure of the spikes they look

4294
01:13:54,070 --> 01:13:54,080
the structure of the spikes they look
 

4295
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:56,229
the structure of the spikes they look
similar but there's enough amino acid

4296
01:13:56,229 --> 01:13:56,239
similar but there's enough amino acid
 

4297
01:13:56,239 --> 01:13:58,550
similar but there's enough amino acid
differences to to make the biology and

4298
01:13:58,550 --> 01:13:58,560
differences to to make the biology and
 

4299
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:01,990
differences to to make the biology and
what it is we don't know because

01:14:01,990 --> 01:14:02,000
what it is we don't know because
 

4301
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,669
what it is we don't know because
how do you figure that out you need to

4302
01:14:03,669 --> 01:14:03,679
how do you figure that out you need to
 

4303
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:05,750
how do you figure that out you need to
study animals because you can't infect

4304
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:05,760
study animals because you can't infect
 

4305
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:08,390
study animals because you can't infect
people and the the animal models aren't

4306
01:14:08,390 --> 01:14:08,400
people and the the animal models aren't
 

4307
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:10,790
people and the the animal models aren't
great you know for for so the way you

4308
01:14:10,790 --> 01:14:10,800
great you know for for so the way you
 

4309
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:12,790
great you know for for so the way you
figure that out is you figure out how

4310
01:14:12,790 --> 01:14:12,800
figure that out is you figure out how
 

4311
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:15,030
figure that out is you figure out how
those differences

4312
01:14:15,030 --> 01:14:15,040
those differences
 

4313
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:17,590
those differences
what functional like how the difference

4314
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:17,600
what functional like how the difference
 

4315
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:19,510
what functional like how the difference
in the amino acids lead to functional

4316
01:14:19,510 --> 01:14:19,520
in the amino acids lead to functional
 

4317
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:21,510
in the amino acids lead to functional
difference of the virus like how it

4318
01:14:21,510 --> 01:14:21,520
difference of the virus like how it
 

4319
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:23,110
difference of the virus like how it
attaches how it breaks the cell wall

4320
01:14:23,110 --> 01:14:23,120
attaches how it breaks the cell wall
 

4321
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:25,110
attaches how it breaks the cell wall
exactly and how the hell do you figure

4322
01:14:25,110 --> 01:14:25,120
exactly and how the hell do you figure
 

4323
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:28,950
exactly and how the hell do you figure
that out like i guess there's models

4324
01:14:28,950 --> 01:14:28,960
that out like i guess there's models
 

4325
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:31,030
that out like i guess there's models
of interaction you need uh first you

4326
01:14:31,030 --> 01:14:31,040
of interaction you need uh first you
 

4327
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:32,870
of interaction you need uh first you
need an animal of some kind to infect

4328
01:14:32,870 --> 01:14:32,880
need an animal of some kind to infect
 

4329
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:35,750
need an animal of some kind to infect
right you can use mice people have used

4330
01:14:35,750 --> 01:14:35,760
right you can use mice people have used

non-human primates

4336
01:14:40,709 --> 01:14:40,719
non-human primates
 

4337
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:42,390
non-human primates
all of the above and non-human primes

4338
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:42,400
all of the above and non-human primes
 

4339
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:44,070
all of the above and non-human primes
are very expensive so not many people do

4340
01:14:44,070 --> 01:14:44,080
are very expensive so not many people do
 

4341
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:44,950
are very expensive so not many people do
that

4342
01:14:44,950 --> 01:14:44,960
that
 

4343
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:47,510
that
um and then you can put the virus in the

4344
01:14:47,510 --> 01:14:47,520
um and then you can put the virus in the
 

4345
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:49,590
um and then you can put the virus in the
respiratory tract but in fact

4346
01:14:49,590 --> 01:14:49,600
respiratory tract but in fact
 

4347
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,750
respiratory tract but in fact
none of them get sick like people do you

4348
01:14:51,750 --> 01:14:51,760
none of them get sick like people do you
 

4349
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:52,630
none of them get sick like people do you
know

4350
01:14:52,630 --> 01:14:52,640
know
 

4351
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:55,030
know
many people with with kovid get a mild

4352
01:14:55,030 --> 01:14:55,040
many people with with kovid get a mild
 

4353
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:58,070
many people with with kovid get a mild
disease but 20 percent get a very severe

4354
01:14:58,070 --> 01:14:58,080
disease but 20 percent get a very severe
 

4355
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:00,070
disease but 20 percent get a very severe
longer-lasting disease and they can die

4356
01:15:00,070 --> 01:15:00,080
longer-lasting disease and they can die
 

4357
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:03,110
longer-lasting disease and they can die
from it right no animal does that yet so

4358
01:15:03,110 --> 01:15:03,120
from it right no animal does that yet so
 

4359
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:04,709
from it right no animal does that yet so
we have no insight into what's

4360
01:15:04,709 --> 01:15:04,719
we have no insight into what's
 

4361
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:06,070
we have no insight into what's
controlling that but if you just want to

4362
01:15:06,070 --> 01:15:06,080
controlling that but if you just want to
 

4363
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:08,709
controlling that but if you just want to
look at the very first part of infection

4364
01:15:08,709 --> 01:15:08,719
look at the very first part of infection
 

4365
01:15:08,719 --> 01:15:10,790
look at the very first part of infection
and the shedding and the transmission

4366
01:15:10,790 --> 01:15:10,800
and the shedding and the transmission
 

4367
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:13,750
and the shedding and the transmission
you can do it in any one of several

4368
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:13,760
you can do it in any one of several
 

4369
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:15,590
you can do it in any one of several
animal models ferrets are really good

4370
01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:15,600
animal models ferrets are really good
 

4371
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:17,750
animal models ferrets are really good
for transmission they tend they have

4372
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:17,760
for transmission they tend they have
 

4373
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:20,470
for transmission they tend they have
nasal structures like humans and they

4374
01:15:20,470 --> 01:15:20,480
nasal structures like humans and they
 

4375
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:22,470
nasal structures like humans and they
you can put them in cages next to each

4376
01:15:22,470 --> 01:15:22,480
you can put them in cages next to each
 

4377
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:23,910
you can put them in cages next to each
other and they'll transmit the virus

4378
01:15:23,910 --> 01:15:23,920
other and they'll transmit the virus
 

4379
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:26,470
other and they'll transmit the virus
really nicely so you can study that

4380
01:15:26,470 --> 01:15:26,480
really nicely so you can study that
 

4381
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:27,830
really nicely so you can study that
but the other thing that's important

4382
01:15:27,830 --> 01:15:27,840
but the other thing that's important
 

4383
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,669
but the other thing that's important
that we should mention

4384
01:15:29,669 --> 01:15:29,679
that we should mention
 

4385
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:33,910
that we should mention
is how do you manipulate these viruses

4386
01:15:33,910 --> 01:15:33,920

 

4387
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:36,550

so these are rna viruses

4388
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:36,560
so these are rna viruses
 

4389
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:39,110
so these are rna viruses
you can't manipulate rna we don't know

4390
01:15:39,110 --> 01:15:39,120
you can't manipulate rna we don't know
 

4391
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:40,630
you can't manipulate rna we don't know
how to do it

4392
01:15:40,630 --> 01:15:40,640
how to do it
 

4393
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:42,550
how to do it
but we dna

4394
01:15:42,550 --> 01:15:42,560
but we dna
 

4395
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:44,870
but we dna
because of the recombinant dna

4396
01:15:44,870 --> 01:15:44,880
because of the recombinant dna
 

4397
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:46,470
because of the recombinant dna
revolution that

4398
01:15:46,470 --> 01:15:46,480
revolution that
 

4399
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:49,430
revolution that
occurred in the 70s we can change

4400
01:15:49,430 --> 01:15:49,440
occurred in the 70s we can change
 

4401
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:51,910
occurred in the 70s we can change
dna any way we want we could change a

01:15:51,910 --> 01:15:51,920
dna any way we want we could change a
 

4403
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:53,910
dna any way we want we could change a
single base we can cut out bases we can

4404
01:15:53,910 --> 01:15:53,920
single base we can cut out bases we can
 

4405
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:56,870
single base we can cut out bases we can
put other things in really easily

4406
01:15:56,870 --> 01:15:56,880
put other things in really easily
 

4407
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:58,229
put other things in really easily
and

4408
01:15:58,229 --> 01:15:58,239
and

david baltimore said here's what i want

4416
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:07,440
david baltimore said here's what i want
 

4417
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:08,870
david baltimore said here's what i want
you to do

4418
01:16:08,870 --> 01:16:08,880
you to do
 

4419
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:11,830
you to do
the the moratorium on recombinant dna

4420
01:16:11,830 --> 01:16:11,840
the the moratorium on recombinant dna
 

4421
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:13,910
the the moratorium on recombinant dna
experiments on viruses has just been

4422
01:16:13,910 --> 01:16:13,920
experiments on viruses has just been
 

4423
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:16,630
experiments on viruses has just been
lifted i want you to make a dna copy of

4424
01:16:16,630 --> 01:16:16,640
lifted i want you to make a dna copy of
 

4425
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:18,070
lifted i want you to make a dna copy of
polio

4426
01:16:18,070 --> 01:16:18,080
polio
 

4427
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:19,669
polio
and see if you put that in a cell

4428
01:16:19,669 --> 01:16:19,679
and see if you put that in a cell
 

4429
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:23,270
and see if you put that in a cell
whether it will start an infection

4430
01:16:23,270 --> 01:16:23,280
whether it will start an infection
 

4431
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:24,390
whether it will start an infection
it's okay

4432
01:16:24,390 --> 01:16:24,400
it's okay
 

4433
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:25,189
it's okay
so

4434
01:16:25,189 --> 01:16:25,199
so
 

4435
01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:27,350
so
i made a dna copy of poliovirus it's

4436
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:27,360
i made a dna copy of poliovirus it's
 

4437
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:30,470
i made a dna copy of poliovirus it's
only 7500 bases it's much smaller than

4438
01:16:30,470 --> 01:16:30,480
only 7500 bases it's much smaller than
 

4439
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:31,669
only 7500 bases it's much smaller than
corona

4440
01:16:31,669 --> 01:16:31,679
corona
 

4441
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:34,630
corona
and i took that dna and i put it in a

4442
01:16:34,630 --> 01:16:34,640
and i took that dna and i put it in a
 

4443
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:36,630
and i took that dna and i put it in a
piece of dna from a bacteria called a

4444
01:16:36,630 --> 01:16:36,640
piece of dna from a bacteria called a
 

4445
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:37,910
piece of dna from a bacteria called a
plasmid

4446
01:16:37,910 --> 01:16:37,920
plasmid
 

4447
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:40,870
plasmid
and you can grow plasmids and many many

4448
01:16:40,870 --> 01:16:40,880
and you can grow plasmids and many many
 

4449
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:42,709
and you can grow plasmids and many many
bacteria make lots of them and purify

4450
01:16:42,709 --> 01:16:42,719
bacteria make lots of them and purify
 

4451
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:45,030
bacteria make lots of them and purify
the dna really easily and i took that

4452
01:16:45,030 --> 01:16:45,040
the dna really easily and i took that
 

4453
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:46,870
the dna really easily and i took that
dna

4454
01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:46,880
dna
 

4455
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:49,270
dna
and i i sequenced it because we wanted

4456
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:49,280
and i i sequenced it because we wanted
 

4457
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:50,870
and i i sequenced it because we wanted
we didn't know the genome sequence of

4458
01:16:50,870 --> 01:16:50,880
we didn't know the genome sequence of
 

4459
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:52,550
we didn't know the genome sequence of
polio at the time

4460
01:16:52,550 --> 01:16:52,560
polio at the time
 

4461
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:54,550
polio at the time
and that took me a year by the way

4462
01:16:54,550 --> 01:16:54,560
and that took me a year by the way
 

4463
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,310
and that took me a year by the way
because the techniques we had were

4464
01:16:56,310 --> 01:16:56,320
because the techniques we had were
 

4465
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:58,229
because the techniques we had were
really archaic and nowadays you could do

4466
01:16:58,229 --> 01:16:58,239
really archaic and nowadays you could do
 

4467
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:01,350
really archaic and nowadays you could do
it in 15 minutes right it's amazing

4468
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:01,360
it in 15 minutes right it's amazing
 

4469
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:03,510
it in 15 minutes right it's amazing
and i took the dna i put it into cells

4470
01:17:03,510 --> 01:17:03,520
and i took the dna i put it into cells
 

4471
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:06,709
and i took the dna i put it into cells
and out came polio

4472
01:17:06,709 --> 01:17:06,719
and out came polio
 

4473
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:08,870
and out came polio
so that's the start now since then

4474
01:17:08,870 --> 01:17:08,880
so that's the start now since then
 

4475
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:10,709
so that's the start now since then
everybody has taken that technique and

4476
01:17:10,709 --> 01:17:10,719
everybody has taken that technique and
 

4477
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:12,149
everybody has taken that technique and
used it for their virus you can now do

4478
01:17:12,149 --> 01:17:12,159
used it for their virus you can now do
 

4479
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:14,149
used it for their virus you can now do
it with source cov2 you make a dna copy

4480
01:17:14,149 --> 01:17:14,159
it with source cov2 you make a dna copy
 

4481
01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:17,430
it with source cov2 you make a dna copy
of any rna virus you can modify it

4482
01:17:17,430 --> 01:17:17,440
of any rna virus you can modify it
 

4483
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:19,030
of any rna virus you can modify it
and you put it back into cells and

4484
01:17:19,030 --> 01:17:19,040
and you put it back into cells and
 

4485
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:21,510
and you put it back into cells and
you'll get your modified virus out so

4486
01:17:21,510 --> 01:17:21,520
you'll get your modified virus out so
 

4487
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:22,630
you'll get your modified virus out so
that's an important part of

4488
01:17:22,630 --> 01:17:22,640
that's an important part of
 

4489
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:24,709
that's an important part of
understanding the properties of the

4490
01:17:24,709 --> 01:17:24,719
understanding the properties of the
 

4491
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:27,110
understanding the properties of the
virus as say in an animal by changing

4492
01:17:27,110 --> 01:17:27,120
virus as say in an animal by changing
 

4493
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:28,790
virus as say in an animal by changing
the virus you're changing a dna copy

4494
01:17:28,790 --> 01:17:28,800
the virus you're changing a dna copy
 

4495
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:31,110
the virus you're changing a dna copy
you're making the virus then and putting

4496
01:17:31,110 --> 01:17:31,120
you're making the virus then and putting
 

4497
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:32,390
you're making the virus then and putting
it into the end

4498
01:17:32,390 --> 01:17:32,400
it into the end
 

4499
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:35,270
it into the end
can you clarify so even in the rna virus

4500
01:17:35,270 --> 01:17:35,280
can you clarify so even in the rna virus
 

4501
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:37,270
can you clarify so even in the rna virus
you can take and turn it into

4502
01:17:37,270 --> 01:17:37,280
you can take and turn it into
 

4503
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:40,070
you can take and turn it into
dna yes and then that allows you to

4504
01:17:40,070 --> 01:17:40,080
dna yes and then that allows you to
 

4505
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:41,830
dna yes and then that allows you to
modify it yes

4506
01:17:41,830 --> 01:17:41,840
modify it yes
 

4507
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:44,550
modify it yes
what's that what's that uh mapping well

4508
01:17:44,550 --> 01:17:44,560
what's that what's that uh mapping well
 

4509
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,550
what's that what's that uh mapping well
no no what's the process of going from

4510
01:17:46,550 --> 01:17:46,560
no no what's the process of going from
 

4511
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:48,229
no no what's the process of going from
rna to dna

4512
01:17:48,229 --> 01:17:48,239
rna to dna
 

4513
01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:50,070
rna to dna
reverse transcription that's reverse

4514
01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:50,080
reverse transcription that's reverse
 

4515
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:51,830
reverse transcription that's reverse
transcription right oh so you actually

4516
01:17:51,830 --> 01:17:51,840
transcription right oh so you actually
 

4517
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:53,430
transcription right oh so you actually
go through the the process of reverse

4518
01:17:53,430 --> 01:17:53,440
go through the the process of reverse
 

4519
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:55,510
go through the the process of reverse
transcription to do this yes oh remember

4520
01:17:55,510 --> 01:17:55,520
transcription to do this yes oh remember
 

4521
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:57,830
transcription to do this yes oh remember
david baltimore and howard yes had

4522
01:17:57,830 --> 01:17:57,840
david baltimore and howard yes had
 

4523
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:00,070
david baltimore and howard yes had
discovered this enzyme in the 70s they

4524
01:18:00,070 --> 01:18:00,080
discovered this enzyme in the 70s they
 

4525
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:02,070
discovered this enzyme in the 70s they
got the nobel prize for that and when i

4526
01:18:02,070 --> 01:18:02,080
got the nobel prize for that and when i
 

4527
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:04,470
got the nobel prize for that and when i
went to david's lab at mit

4528
01:18:04,470 --> 01:18:04,480
went to david's lab at mit
 

4529
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:06,630
went to david's lab at mit
he had the enzyme in the freezer he said

4530
01:18:06,630 --> 01:18:06,640
he had the enzyme in the freezer he said
 

4531
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,470
he had the enzyme in the freezer he said
here take this and make a dna copy of

4532
01:18:08,470 --> 01:18:08,480
here take this and make a dna copy of
 

4533
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:10,070
here take this and make a dna copy of
paul yeah i didn't make the connection

4534
01:18:10,070 --> 01:18:10,080
paul yeah i didn't make the connection
 

4535
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:12,229
paul yeah i didn't make the connection
that you can use that kind of thing for

4536
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:12,239
that you can use that kind of thing for
 

4537
01:18:12,239 --> 01:18:13,910
that you can use that kind of thing for
an rna virus

4538
01:18:13,910 --> 01:18:13,920
an rna virus
 

4539
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:16,310
an rna virus
and so that's and then modify it see any

4540
01:18:16,310 --> 01:18:16,320
and so that's and then modify it see any
 

4541
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:18,310
and so that's and then modify it see any
dna virus already exists as dna so you

4542
01:18:18,310 --> 01:18:18,320
dna virus already exists as dna so you
 

4543
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:19,750
dna virus already exists as dna so you
can modify it

4544
01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:19,760
can modify it
 

4545
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:22,709
can modify it
but for rna viruses it was difficult and

4546
01:18:22,709 --> 01:18:22,719
but for rna viruses it was difficult and
 

4547
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:25,590
but for rna viruses it was difficult and
so then from that point on for influenza

4548
01:18:25,590 --> 01:18:25,600
so then from that point on for influenza
 

4549
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,990
so then from that point on for influenza
every other rna virus and coronaviruses

4550
01:18:27,990 --> 01:18:28,000
every other rna virus and coronaviruses
 

4551
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,229
every other rna virus and coronaviruses
people made dna copies and that's what

4552
01:18:30,229 --> 01:18:30,239
people made dna copies and that's what
 

4553
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:32,870
people made dna copies and that's what
they use to modify and and ask questions

4554
01:18:32,870 --> 01:18:32,880
they use to modify and and ask questions
 

4555
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,709
they use to modify and and ask questions
about what things are doing right what's

4556
01:18:34,709 --> 01:18:34,719
about what things are doing right what's
 

4557
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:36,310
about what things are doing right what's
this gene doing what if we take it out

4558
01:18:36,310 --> 01:18:36,320
this gene doing what if we take it out
 

4559
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:37,750
this gene doing what if we take it out
what happened can you do the same thing

4560
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:37,760
what happened can you do the same thing
 

4561
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:40,790
what happened can you do the same thing
with uh kovid uh is it takes rna and

4562
01:18:40,790 --> 01:18:40,800
with uh kovid uh is it takes rna and
 

4563
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,990
with uh kovid uh is it takes rna and
then of course and in fact in january

4564
01:18:42,990 --> 01:18:43,000
then of course and in fact in january
 

4565
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,750
then of course and in fact in january
2020 as soon as the genome sequence was

4566
01:18:45,750 --> 01:18:45,760
2020 as soon as the genome sequence was
 

4567
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:46,790
2020 as soon as the genome sequence was
released

4568
01:18:46,790 --> 01:18:46,800
released
 

4569
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,229
released
from china the

4570
01:18:48,229 --> 01:18:48,239
from china the
 

4571
01:18:48,239 --> 01:18:50,870
from china the
labs all over we're synthesizing this 30

4572
01:18:50,870 --> 01:18:50,880
labs all over we're synthesizing this 30
 

4573
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:52,709
labs all over we're synthesizing this 30
000 base dna

4574
01:18:52,709 --> 01:18:52,719
000 base dna
 

4575
01:18:52,719 --> 01:18:53,510
000 base dna
and

4576
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:53,520
and
 

4577
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:56,149
and
getting what can you figure out

4578
01:18:56,149 --> 01:18:56,159
getting what can you figure out
 

4579
01:18:56,159 --> 01:18:58,950
getting what can you figure out
without infecting anything just uh

4580
01:18:58,950 --> 01:18:58,960
without infecting anything just uh
 

4581
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:00,390
without infecting anything just uh
turning into

4582
01:19:00,390 --> 01:19:00,400
turning into
 

4583
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:01,830
turning into
with the reverse transcription turning

4584
01:19:01,830 --> 01:19:01,840
with the reverse transcription turning
 

4585
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:04,310
with the reverse transcription turning
into dna modifying stuff and then

4586
01:19:04,310 --> 01:19:04,320
into dna modifying stuff and then
 

4587
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:05,830
into dna modifying stuff and then
putting it into a cell what can you

4588
01:19:05,830 --> 01:19:05,840
putting it into a cell what can you
 

4589
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:07,590
putting it into a cell what can you
figure out

4590
01:19:07,590 --> 01:19:07,600
figure out
 

4591
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:10,310
figure out
from that oh well you could let's say

4592
01:19:10,310 --> 01:19:10,320
from that oh well you could let's say
 

4593
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:12,070
from that oh well you could let's say
you can cut out a gene you see some

4594
01:19:12,070 --> 01:19:12,080
you can cut out a gene you see some
 

4595
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,590
you can cut out a gene you see some
genes in the sequence i don't know what

4596
01:19:13,590 --> 01:19:13,600
genes in the sequence i don't know what
 

4597
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,910
genes in the sequence i don't know what
these genes do let's cut them out

4598
01:19:15,910 --> 01:19:15,920
these genes do let's cut them out
 

4599
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:17,830
these genes do let's cut them out
and then you could

4600
01:19:17,830 --> 01:19:17,840
and then you could
 

4601
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:19,510
and then you could
cut them out of the dna you put the dna

4602
01:19:19,510 --> 01:19:19,520
cut them out of the dna you put the dna
 

4603
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:21,270
cut them out of the dna you put the dna
in cells and maybe you get

4604
01:19:21,270 --> 01:19:21,280
in cells and maybe you get
 

4605
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:23,270
in cells and maybe you get
virus out and you go oh

4606
01:19:23,270 --> 01:19:23,280
virus out and you go oh
 

4607
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:25,270
virus out and you go oh
clearly that gene's not needed

4608
01:19:25,270 --> 01:19:25,280
clearly that gene's not needed
 

4609
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:26,790
clearly that gene's not needed
for the virus to reproduce at least in

4610
01:19:26,790 --> 01:19:26,800
for the virus to reproduce at least in
 

4611
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:29,110
for the virus to reproduce at least in
cells right or maybe you take the g now

4612
01:19:29,110 --> 01:19:29,120
cells right or maybe you take the g now
 

4613
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:31,110
cells right or maybe you take the g now
and you never get any virus so it's

4614
01:19:31,110 --> 01:19:31,120
and you never get any virus so it's
 

4615
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:32,790
and you never get any virus so it's
lethal is there a nice systematic ways

4616
01:19:32,790 --> 01:19:32,800
lethal is there a nice systematic ways
 

4617
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,630
lethal is there a nice systematic ways
of doing this do people kind of automate

4618
01:19:34,630 --> 01:19:34,640
of doing this do people kind of automate
 

4619
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:35,350
of doing this do people kind of automate
it

4620
01:19:35,350 --> 01:19:35,360
it
 

4621
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:37,270
it
absolutely and we

4622
01:19:37,270 --> 01:19:37,280
absolutely and we
 

4623
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:39,910
absolutely and we
i mean the problem with sars

4624
01:19:39,910 --> 01:19:39,920
i mean the problem with sars
 

4625
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:41,910
i mean the problem with sars
the covid virus is it's thirty thousand

4626
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:41,920
the covid virus is it's thirty thousand
 

4627
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:45,189
the covid virus is it's thirty thousand
basis a lot of stuff there yeah and

4628
01:19:45,189 --> 01:19:45,199
basis a lot of stuff there yeah and
 

4629
01:19:45,199 --> 01:19:47,510
basis a lot of stuff there yeah and
what makes it more difficult is that

4630
01:19:47,510 --> 01:19:47,520
what makes it more difficult is that
 

4631
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:50,229
what makes it more difficult is that
you have to it's been classified as a

4632
01:19:50,229 --> 01:19:50,239
you have to it's been classified as a
 

4633
01:19:50,239 --> 01:19:51,750
you have to it's been classified as a
bsl3

4634
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:51,760
bsl3
 

4635
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:52,709
bsl3
agent

4636
01:19:52,709 --> 01:19:52,719
agent
 

4637
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:55,430
agent
biosafety level three

4638
01:19:55,430 --> 01:19:55,440
biosafety level three
 

4639
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:57,430
biosafety level three
and so not everyone has a lab that's

4640
01:19:57,430 --> 01:19:57,440
and so not everyone has a lab that's
 

4641
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:00,070
and so not everyone has a lab that's
capable of doing that so it limits the

4642
01:20:00,070 --> 01:20:00,080
capable of doing that so it limits the
 

4643
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:02,470
capable of doing that so it limits the
number of people who can do experiments

4644
01:20:02,470 --> 01:20:02,480
number of people who can do experiments
 

4645
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,630
number of people who can do experiments
you know some we were lucky to have a

4646
01:20:04,630 --> 01:20:04,640
you know some we were lucky to have a
 

4647
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:07,110
you know some we were lucky to have a
few in new york city but not every place

4648
01:20:07,110 --> 01:20:07,120
few in new york city but not every place
 

4649
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:09,669
few in new york city but not every place
has them so you cannot work

4650
01:20:09,669 --> 01:20:09,679
has them so you cannot work
 

4651
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:11,350
has them so you cannot work
with the virus just out on the bench

4652
01:20:11,350 --> 01:20:11,360
with the virus just out on the bench
 

4653
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:13,030
with the virus just out on the bench
like we do with many other viruses you

4654
01:20:13,030 --> 01:20:13,040
like we do with many other viruses you
 

4655
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:14,709
like we do with many other viruses you
have to wear a suit and a have to have

4656
01:20:14,709 --> 01:20:14,719
have to wear a suit and a have to have
 

4657
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:16,310
have to wear a suit and a have to have
special procedures and containment and

4658
01:20:16,310 --> 01:20:16,320
special procedures and containment and
 

4659
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:18,070
special procedures and containment and
so forth so it makes it difficult to do

4660
01:20:18,070 --> 01:20:18,080
so forth so it makes it difficult to do
 

4661
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:20,709
so forth so it makes it difficult to do
basic experiments on the virus but well

4662
01:20:20,709 --> 01:20:20,719
basic experiments on the virus but well
 

4663
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:22,629
basic experiments on the virus but well
it's a pandemic there's a lot of money

4664
01:20:22,629 --> 01:20:22,639
it's a pandemic there's a lot of money
 

4665
01:20:22,639 --> 01:20:24,550
it's a pandemic there's a lot of money
there's a lot of incentive to work on it

4666
01:20:24,550 --> 01:20:24,560
there's a lot of incentive to work on it
 

4667
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:26,629
there's a lot of incentive to work on it
harder and also you don't need to work

4668
01:20:26,629 --> 01:20:26,639
harder and also you don't need to work
 

4669
01:20:26,639 --> 01:20:28,550
harder and also you don't need to work
on the virus you can take bits of it and

4670
01:20:28,550 --> 01:20:28,560
on the virus you can take bits of it and
 

4671
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:30,790
on the virus you can take bits of it and
work you could take say just the spike

4672
01:20:30,790 --> 01:20:30,800
work you could take say just the spike
 

4673
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,790
work you could take say just the spike
right and say can we make a vaccine with

4674
01:20:32,790 --> 01:20:32,800
right and say can we make a vaccine with
 

4675
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:34,310
right and say can we make a vaccine with
just the spike because that doesn't

4676
01:20:34,310 --> 01:20:34,320
just the spike because that doesn't
 

4677
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:37,669
just the spike because that doesn't
require bsl3 so yes so if uh like

4678
01:20:37,669 --> 01:20:37,679
require bsl3 so yes so if uh like
 

4679
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:39,510
require bsl3 so yes so if uh like
building a vaccine requires you to

4680
01:20:39,510 --> 01:20:39,520
building a vaccine requires you to
 

4681
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:42,709
building a vaccine requires you to
figure out how or antiviral drugs

4682
01:20:42,709 --> 01:20:42,719
figure out how or antiviral drugs
 

4683
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:44,790
figure out how or antiviral drugs
how to attack various structural parts

4684
01:20:44,790 --> 01:20:44,800
how to attack various structural parts
 

4685
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,229
how to attack various structural parts
of the virus and the functional parts of

4686
01:20:46,229 --> 01:20:46,239
of the virus and the functional parts of
 

4687
01:20:46,239 --> 01:20:48,950
of the virus and the functional parts of
the virus right you have to decide on a

4688
01:20:48,950 --> 01:20:48,960
the virus right you have to decide on a
 

4689
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:49,990
the virus right you have to decide on a
target

4690
01:20:49,990 --> 01:20:50,000
target
 

4691
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,470
target
yeah like i'm going to make an antiviral

4692
01:20:52,470 --> 01:20:52,480
yeah like i'm going to make an antiviral
 

4693
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:55,430
yeah like i'm going to make an antiviral
what am i going to target in the virus

4694
01:20:55,430 --> 01:20:55,440
what am i going to target in the virus
 

4695
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:56,870
what am i going to target in the virus
and

4696
01:20:56,870 --> 01:20:56,880
and
 

4697
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:58,870
and
there are a few things that make more

4698
01:20:58,870 --> 01:20:58,880
there are a few things that make more
 

4699
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:00,390
there are a few things that make more
sense than others

4700
01:21:00,390 --> 01:21:00,400
sense than others
 

4701
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:03,189
sense than others
usually we like to target enzymes

4702
01:21:03,189 --> 01:21:03,199
usually we like to target enzymes
 

4703
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:04,629
usually we like to target enzymes
i don't know if you remember any your

4704
01:21:04,629 --> 01:21:04,639
i don't know if you remember any your
 

4705
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:07,189
i don't know if you remember any your
biochemistry but you know enzymes are

4706
01:21:07,189 --> 01:21:07,199
biochemistry but you know enzymes are
 

4707
01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:08,709
biochemistry but you know enzymes are
catalytic you don't need a lot of them

4708
01:21:08,709 --> 01:21:08,719
catalytic you don't need a lot of them
 

4709
01:21:08,719 --> 01:21:11,110
catalytic you don't need a lot of them
to do a lot of things so they're

4710
01:21:11,110 --> 01:21:11,120
to do a lot of things so they're
 

4711
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:13,270
to do a lot of things so they're
typically in low concentrations in in a

4712
01:21:13,270 --> 01:21:13,280
typically in low concentrations in in a
 

4713
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:15,270
typically in low concentrations in in a
virus-infected cell so it's easier to

4714
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:15,280
virus-infected cell so it's easier to
 

4715
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:18,149
virus-infected cell so it's easier to
inhibit them with a drug and the coronas

4716
01:21:18,149 --> 01:21:18,159
inhibit them with a drug and the coronas
 

4717
01:21:18,159 --> 01:21:19,750
inhibit them with a drug and the coronas
have couple of enzymes that we can

4718
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:19,760
have couple of enzymes that we can
 

4719
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:20,870
have couple of enzymes that we can
target

4720
01:21:20,870 --> 01:21:20,880
target
 

4721
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:22,950
target
so it's you have to figure that out

4722
01:21:22,950 --> 01:21:22,960
so it's you have to figure that out
 

4723
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:24,629
so it's you have to figure that out
ahead of time and decide what to go

4724
01:21:24,629 --> 01:21:24,639
ahead of time and decide what to go
 

4725
01:21:24,639 --> 01:21:26,390
ahead of time and decide what to go
after and then you can look for drugs

4726
01:21:26,390 --> 01:21:26,400
after and then you can look for drugs
 

4727
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:28,070
after and then you can look for drugs
that inhibit what what you're interested

4728
01:21:28,070 --> 01:21:28,080
that inhibit what what you're interested
 

4729
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:31,189
that inhibit what what you're interested
in it's not that hard to do

4730
01:21:31,189 --> 01:21:31,199
in it's not that hard to do
 

4731
01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:32,629
in it's not that hard to do
there's just something beautiful about

4732
01:21:32,629 --> 01:21:32,639
there's just something beautiful about
 

4733
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:33,990
there's just something beautiful about
biology

4734
01:21:33,990 --> 01:21:34,000
biology
 

4735
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,229
biology
about the mechanisms of biology and i

4736
01:21:36,229 --> 01:21:36,239
about the mechanisms of biology and i
 

4737
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:39,270
about the mechanisms of biology and i
kind of regret

4738
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:39,280

 

4739
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:40,950

falling in love with computer science so

4740
01:21:40,950 --> 01:21:40,960
falling in love with computer science so
 

4741
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:42,950
falling in love with computer science so
much that i

4742
01:21:42,950 --> 01:21:42,960
much that i
 

4743
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:43,750
much that i
um

4744
01:21:43,750 --> 01:21:43,760
um
 

4745
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:46,149
um
left that biology textbook on the show

4746
01:21:46,149 --> 01:21:46,159
left that biology textbook on the show
 

4747
01:21:46,159 --> 01:21:48,470
left that biology textbook on the show
and left it behind but hopefully we'll

4748
01:21:48,470 --> 01:21:48,480
and left it behind but hopefully we'll
 

4749
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:50,390
and left it behind but hopefully we'll
return to it now because

4750
01:21:50,390 --> 01:21:50,400
return to it now because
 

4751
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:52,070
return to it now because
i think one of the things you learn even

4752
01:21:52,070 --> 01:21:52,080
i think one of the things you learn even
 

4753
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:54,830
i think one of the things you learn even
in computer science that studying

4754
01:21:54,830 --> 01:21:54,840
in computer science that studying
 

4755
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:59,430
in computer science that studying
biology and certainly neurobiology

4756
01:21:59,430 --> 01:21:59,440
biology and certainly neurobiology
 

4757
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:02,709
biology and certainly neurobiology
uh you you get inspired

4758
01:22:02,709 --> 01:22:02,719
uh you you get inspired
 

4759
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:04,470
uh you you get inspired
here's a mechanism of incredible

4760
01:22:04,470 --> 01:22:04,480
here's a mechanism of incredible
 

4761
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:06,550
here's a mechanism of incredible
complexity that works really well is

4762
01:22:06,550 --> 01:22:06,560
complexity that works really well is
 

4763
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:08,390
complexity that works really well is
very robust it's very effective

4764
01:22:08,390 --> 01:22:08,400
very robust it's very effective
 

4765
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:09,430
very robust it's very effective
efficient

4766
01:22:09,430 --> 01:22:09,440
efficient
 

4767
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:11,189
efficient
it inspires you to come up with

4768
01:22:11,189 --> 01:22:11,199
it inspires you to come up with
 

4769
01:22:11,199 --> 01:22:12,790
it inspires you to come up with
techniques that you can engineer in the

4770
01:22:12,790 --> 01:22:12,800
techniques that you can engineer in the
 

4771
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:14,870
techniques that you can engineer in the
machine so that's that's the what drives

4772
01:22:14,870 --> 01:22:14,880
machine so that's that's the what drives
 

4773
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:17,189
machine so that's that's the what drives
a field forward when people

4774
01:22:17,189 --> 01:22:17,199
a field forward when people
 

4775
01:22:17,199 --> 01:22:18,470
a field forward when people
improvise

4776
01:22:18,470 --> 01:22:18,480
improvise
 

4777
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:21,350
improvise
and come up with new technologies that

4778
01:22:21,350 --> 01:22:21,360
and come up with new technologies that
 

4779
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:23,270
and come up with new technologies that
really make a difference we have we have

4780
01:22:23,270 --> 01:22:23,280
really make a difference we have we have
 

4781
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:25,189
really make a difference we have we have
a bunch of those now

4782
01:22:25,189 --> 01:22:25,199
a bunch of those now
 

4783
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:26,950
a bunch of those now
what's the difference between the

4784
01:22:26,950 --> 01:22:26,960
what's the difference between the
 

4785
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:29,510
what's the difference between the
coronavirus family and the

4786
01:22:29,510 --> 01:22:29,520
coronavirus family and the
 

4787
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:32,149
coronavirus family and the
uh the other popular family influenza

4788
01:22:32,149 --> 01:22:32,159
uh the other popular family influenza
 

4789
01:22:32,159 --> 01:22:33,430
uh the other popular family influenza
virus family

4790
01:22:33,430 --> 01:22:33,440
virus family
 

4791
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:34,870
virus family
is um

4792
01:22:34,870 --> 01:22:34,880
is um
 

4793
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:37,189
is um
i mean if i were because you mentioned

4794
01:22:37,189 --> 01:22:37,199
i mean if i were because you mentioned
 

4795
01:22:37,199 --> 01:22:38,709
i mean if i were because you mentioned
we should have done a lot more in terms

4796
01:22:38,709 --> 01:22:38,719
we should have done a lot more in terms
 

4797
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:40,229
we should have done a lot more in terms
of vaccine development that kind of

4798
01:22:40,229 --> 01:22:40,239
of vaccine development that kind of
 

4799
01:22:40,239 --> 01:22:43,669
of vaccine development that kind of
thing for coronaviruses but if i were

4800
01:22:43,669 --> 01:22:43,679
thing for coronaviruses but if i were
 

4801
01:22:43,679 --> 01:22:45,350
thing for coronaviruses but if i were
back then

4802
01:22:45,350 --> 01:22:45,360
back then
 

4803
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,030
back then
from my understanding the thing we

4804
01:22:47,030 --> 01:22:47,040
from my understanding the thing we
 

4805
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:49,750
from my understanding the thing we
should all be afraid of is influenza

4806
01:22:49,750 --> 01:22:49,760
should all be afraid of is influenza
 

4807
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:50,870
should all be afraid of is influenza
like some

4808
01:22:50,870 --> 01:22:50,880
like some
 

4809
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:52,950
like some
strong variants coming out from that

4810
01:22:52,950 --> 01:22:52,960
strong variants coming out from that
 

4811
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:55,189
strong variants coming out from that
family that seems like the one that will

4812
01:22:55,189 --> 01:22:55,199
family that seems like the one that will
 

4813
01:22:55,199 --> 01:22:56,790
family that seems like the one that will
destroy human

4814
01:22:56,790 --> 01:22:56,800
destroy human
 

4815
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:59,510
destroy human
civilization or uh or hurt us really

4816
01:22:59,510 --> 01:22:59,520
civilization or uh or hurt us really
 

4817
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:01,750
civilization or uh or hurt us really
badly i don't know if you agree with

4818
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:01,760
badly i don't know if you agree with
 

4819
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:04,790
badly i don't know if you agree with
this sense but maybe

4820
01:23:04,790 --> 01:23:04,800
this sense but maybe
 

4821
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:06,790
this sense but maybe
maybe you can also just clarify what to

4822
01:23:06,790 --> 01:23:06,800
maybe you can also just clarify what to
 

4823
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:08,709
maybe you can also just clarify what to
use the is the difference between the

4824
01:23:08,709 --> 01:23:08,719
use the is the difference between the
 

4825
01:23:08,719 --> 01:23:10,470
use the is the difference between the
families so it's an interesting

4826
01:23:10,470 --> 01:23:10,480
families so it's an interesting
 

4827
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:11,830
families so it's an interesting
difference they both

4828
01:23:11,830 --> 01:23:11,840
difference they both
 

4829
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:14,390
difference they both
they both have membranes right

4830
01:23:14,390 --> 01:23:14,400
they both have membranes right
 

4831
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:17,030
they both have membranes right
so then they have spike proteins

4832
01:23:17,030 --> 01:23:17,040
so then they have spike proteins
 

4833
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:18,870
so then they have spike proteins
embedded in them for

4834
01:23:18,870 --> 01:23:18,880
embedded in them for
 

4835
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,629
embedded in them for
and they're different spikes

4836
01:23:20,629 --> 01:23:20,639
and they're different spikes
 

4837
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:21,669
and they're different spikes
in fact

4838
01:23:21,669 --> 01:23:21,679
in fact
 

4839
01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:24,070
in fact
for influenza there are two main ones

4840
01:23:24,070 --> 01:23:24,080
for influenza there are two main ones
 

4841
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:27,110
for influenza there are two main ones
they're called the h a and the n a

4842
01:23:27,110 --> 01:23:27,120
they're called the h a and the n a
 

4843
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:30,070
they're called the h a and the n a
but what's inside

4844
01:23:30,070 --> 01:23:30,080
but what's inside
 

4845
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:33,430
but what's inside
is rna but it's very different rna

4846
01:23:33,430 --> 01:23:33,440
is rna but it's very different rna
 

4847
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:36,950
is rna but it's very different rna
and here we have to explain that so

4848
01:23:36,950 --> 01:23:36,960
and here we have to explain that so
 

4849
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:38,950
and here we have to explain that so
viruses with rna can have three

4850
01:23:38,950 --> 01:23:38,960
viruses with rna can have three
 

4851
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:41,990
viruses with rna can have three
different kinds of rna

4852
01:23:41,990 --> 01:23:42,000
different kinds of rna
 

4853
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,350
different kinds of rna
they can have what we call plus rna

4854
01:23:45,350 --> 01:23:45,360
they can have what we call plus rna
 

4855
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:47,110
they can have what we call plus rna
they can have minus

4856
01:23:47,110 --> 01:23:47,120
they can have minus
 

4857
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:49,830
they can have minus
rna or they could have plus minus

4858
01:23:49,830 --> 01:23:49,840
rna or they could have plus minus
 

4859
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:52,390
rna or they could have plus minus
actually two strands

4860
01:23:52,390 --> 01:23:52,400
actually two strands
 

4861
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:54,470
actually two strands
hybridized together

4862
01:23:54,470 --> 01:23:54,480
hybridized together
 

4863
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:57,590
hybridized together
the plus rna simply means

4864
01:23:57,590 --> 01:23:57,600
the plus rna simply means
 

4865
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:58,470
the plus rna simply means
that

4866
01:23:58,470 --> 01:23:58,480
that
 

4867
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:01,910
that
if you put that plus rna in a cell you

4868
01:24:01,910 --> 01:24:01,920
if you put that plus rna in a cell you
 

4869
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:03,750
if you put that plus rna in a cell you
know your cell has ribosomes in it that

4870
01:24:03,750 --> 01:24:03,760
know your cell has ribosomes in it that
 

4871
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:05,750
know your cell has ribosomes in it that
make the proteins that you need the

4872
01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:05,760
make the proteins that you need the
 

4873
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:07,590
make the proteins that you need the
ribosomes will immediately latch on to

4874
01:24:07,590 --> 01:24:07,600
ribosomes will immediately latch on to
 

4875
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:11,189
ribosomes will immediately latch on to
the plus rna and begin to make proteins

4876
01:24:11,189 --> 01:24:11,199
the plus rna and begin to make proteins
 

4877
01:24:11,199 --> 01:24:13,750
the plus rna and begin to make proteins
a minus rna is not the right strand to

4878
01:24:13,750 --> 01:24:13,760
a minus rna is not the right strand to
 

4879
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:15,189
a minus rna is not the right strand to
make proteins

4880
01:24:15,189 --> 01:24:15,199
make proteins
 

4881
01:24:15,199 --> 01:24:17,350
make proteins
so it has to be copied first and then

4882
01:24:17,350 --> 01:24:17,360
so it has to be copied first and then
 

4883
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:20,149
so it has to be copied first and then
the plus minus is both together so the

4884
01:24:20,149 --> 01:24:20,159
the plus minus is both together so the
 

4885
01:24:20,159 --> 01:24:21,270
the plus minus is both together so the
sars

4886
01:24:21,270 --> 01:24:21,280
sars
 

4887
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:23,750

coronaviruses all the coronaviruses have

4888
01:24:23,750 --> 01:24:23,760
coronaviruses all the coronaviruses have
 

4889
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:25,110

plus rna

4890
01:24:25,110 --> 01:24:25,120
plus rna
 

4891
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:26,709
plus rna
so as soon as that rna gets in the cell

4892
01:24:26,709 --> 01:24:26,719
so as soon as that rna gets in the cell
 

4893
01:24:26,719 --> 01:24:28,550
so as soon as that rna gets in the cell
boom it starts an infectious cycle same

stranded
 

4901
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:36,870
stranded
so they cannot be translated when they

4902
01:24:36,870 --> 01:24:36,880
so they cannot be translated when they
 

4903
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:39,270
so they cannot be translated when they
get in the cell so that that's tough for

4904
01:24:39,270 --> 01:24:39,280
get in the cell so that that's tough for
 

4905
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:40,950
get in the cell so that that's tough for
the virus because

4906
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:40,960
the virus because
 

4907
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:43,030

rna

4912
01:24:45,750 --> 01:24:45,760
rna
 

4913
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:47,669
rna
from minus rna it doesn't have the

4914
01:24:47,669 --> 01:24:47,679
from minus rna it doesn't have the
 

4915
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:49,990
from minus rna it doesn't have the
enzyme to do it so the virus has to

4916
01:24:49,990 --> 01:24:50,000
enzyme to do it so the virus has to
 

4917
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,590
enzyme to do it so the virus has to
carry it in

4918
01:24:51,590 --> 01:24:51,600
carry it in
 

4919
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,910
carry it in
inside the virus particle and then when

4920
01:24:53,910 --> 01:24:53,920
inside the virus particle and then when
 

4921
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:55,910
inside the virus particle and then when
the minus rna is in the cell the virus

4922
01:24:55,910 --> 01:24:55,920
the minus rna is in the cell the virus
 

4923
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:57,750
the minus rna is in the cell the virus
enzyme makes plus rnas and those get

4924
01:24:57,750 --> 01:24:57,760
enzyme makes plus rnas and those get
 

4925
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:59,189
enzyme makes plus rnas and those get
translated

4926
01:24:59,189 --> 01:24:59,199
translated
 

4927
01:24:59,199 --> 01:25:01,910
translated
it's a big difference and then

4928
01:25:01,910 --> 01:25:01,920
it's a big difference and then
 

4929
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:03,990
it's a big difference and then
in the influenza viruses not only is it

4930
01:25:03,990 --> 01:25:04,000
in the influenza viruses not only is it
 

4931
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:07,350
in the influenza viruses not only is it
minus rna but it's in pieces it's in

4932
01:25:07,350 --> 01:25:07,360
minus rna but it's in pieces it's in
 

4933
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:09,350
minus rna but it's in pieces it's in
eight pieces

4934
01:25:09,350 --> 01:25:09,360
eight pieces
 

4935
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:11,350
eight pieces
we call that segmented whereas the

4936
01:25:11,350 --> 01:25:11,360
we call that segmented whereas the
 

4937
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:14,790
we call that segmented whereas the
corona is in one long piece of rna

4938
01:25:14,790 --> 01:25:14,800
corona is in one long piece of rna
 

4939
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:16,310
corona is in one long piece of rna
so what is it is that they're like

4940
01:25:16,310 --> 01:25:16,320
so what is it is that they're like
 

4941
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:18,550
so what is it is that they're like
floating separately yeah so the genes

4942
01:25:18,550 --> 01:25:18,560
floating separately yeah so the genes
 

4943
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:19,910
floating separately yeah so the genes
are on separate pieces they're all

4944
01:25:19,910 --> 01:25:19,920
are on separate pieces they're all
 

4945
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:21,910
are on separate pieces they're all
packaged inside that virus particle of

4946
01:25:21,910 --> 01:25:21,920
packaged inside that virus particle of
 

4947
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:23,669
packaged inside that virus particle of
influenza virus but they're in pieces

4948
01:25:23,669 --> 01:25:23,679
influenza virus but they're in pieces
 

4949
01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:25,350
influenza virus but they're in pieces
and why that's important

4950
01:25:25,350 --> 01:25:25,360
and why that's important
 

4951
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:27,910
and why that's important
is because if two different influenza

4952
01:25:27,910 --> 01:25:27,920
is because if two different influenza
 

4953
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:29,270
is because if two different influenza
viruses

4954
01:25:29,270 --> 01:25:29,280
viruses
 

4955
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:31,350
viruses
infect the same cell

4956
01:25:31,350 --> 01:25:31,360
infect the same cell
 

4957
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,910
infect the same cell
the pieces as they reproduce can mix and

4958
01:25:33,910 --> 01:25:33,920
the pieces as they reproduce can mix and
 

4959
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:35,510
the pieces as they reproduce can mix and
out can come

4960
01:25:35,510 --> 01:25:35,520
out can come
 

4961
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:38,070
out can come
a virus with a new assortment of pieces

4962
01:25:38,070 --> 01:25:38,080
a virus with a new assortment of pieces
 

4963
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:40,550
a virus with a new assortment of pieces
and that allows influenza virus to

4964
01:25:40,550 --> 01:25:40,560
and that allows influenza virus to
 

4965
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:41,910
and that allows influenza virus to
undergo

4966
01:25:41,910 --> 01:25:41,920
undergo
 

4967
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:43,669
undergo
extremely high frequency evolution

4968
01:25:43,669 --> 01:25:43,679
extremely high frequency evolution
 

4969
01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:45,910
extremely high frequency evolution
that's why we get pandemics when we have

4970
01:25:45,910 --> 01:25:45,920
that's why we get pandemics when we have
 

4971
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:48,229
that's why we get pandemics when we have
a new flu pandemics is because somewhere

4972
01:25:48,229 --> 01:25:48,239
a new flu pandemics is because somewhere
 

4973
01:25:48,239 --> 01:25:49,910
a new flu pandemics is because somewhere
in some animal

4974
01:25:49,910 --> 01:25:49,920
in some animal
 

4975
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:52,390
in some animal
two viruses have reassorted and made a

4976
01:25:52,390 --> 01:25:52,400
two viruses have reassorted and made a
 

4977
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:55,270
two viruses have reassorted and made a
new virus that we hadn't seen before

4978
01:25:55,270 --> 01:25:55,280
new virus that we hadn't seen before
 

4979
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:57,750
new virus that we hadn't seen before
so so you're you're you're talking about

4980
01:25:57,750 --> 01:25:57,760
so so you're you're you're talking about
 

4981
01:25:57,760 --> 01:25:59,030
so so you're you're you're talking about
kind of

4982
01:25:59,030 --> 01:25:59,040
kind of
 

4983
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:01,910
kind of
biological characteristics but what am i

4984
01:26:01,910 --> 01:26:01,920
biological characteristics but what am i
 

4985
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:04,550
biological characteristics but what am i
incorrect in my intuition that

4986
01:26:04,550 --> 01:26:04,560
incorrect in my intuition that
 

4987
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:05,910
incorrect in my intuition that
or from the things i've heard that the

4988
01:26:05,910 --> 01:26:05,920
or from the things i've heard that the
 

4989
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:08,390
or from the things i've heard that the
influence of family viruses is more

4990
01:26:08,390 --> 01:26:08,400
influence of family viruses is more
 

4991
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:09,750
influence of family viruses is more
dangerous

4992
01:26:09,750 --> 01:26:09,760
dangerous
 

4993
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:11,669
dangerous
like what what makes it more dangerous

4994
01:26:11,669 --> 01:26:11,679
like what what makes it more dangerous
 

4995
01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:14,709
like what what makes it more dangerous
to humans

4996
01:26:14,709 --> 01:26:14,719

 

4997
01:26:14,719 --> 01:26:16,790

well it depends on the there are many

4998
01:26:16,790 --> 01:26:16,800
well it depends on the there are many
 

4999
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:19,270
well it depends on the there are many
flavors or vintages of influenza virus

5000
01:26:19,270 --> 01:26:19,280
flavors or vintages of influenza virus
 

5001
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:20,790
flavors or vintages of influenza virus
some are dangerous and some are not

5002
01:26:20,790 --> 01:26:20,800
some are dangerous and some are not
 

5003
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:23,189
some are dangerous and some are not
right it depends on which one some like

5004
01:26:23,189 --> 01:26:23,199
right it depends on which one some like
 

5005
01:26:23,199 --> 01:26:26,310
right it depends on which one some like
the 1918 apparently was was very lethal

5006
01:26:26,310 --> 01:26:26,320
the 1918 apparently was was very lethal
 

5007
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:28,149
the 1918 apparently was was very lethal
killed a lot of people

5008
01:26:28,149 --> 01:26:28,159
killed a lot of people
 

5009
01:26:28,159 --> 01:26:31,430
killed a lot of people
but more contemporary viruses we had a

but more contemporary viruses we had a
 

5011
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:33,990
but more contemporary viruses we had a

we don't know exactly why but it didn't
kill that many people it transmitted

kill that many people it transmitted
 

5023
01:26:43,199 --> 01:26:45,110
kill that many people it transmitted
pretty well is that the bird flu one

5024
01:26:45,110 --> 01:26:45,120
pretty well is that the bird flu one
 

5025
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:47,669
pretty well is that the bird flu one
they're all they're all deriving that

um

5042
01:27:04,790 --> 01:27:04,800
um
 

5043
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:07,270
um
but influenza can cause pneumonia and

01:27:07,270 --> 01:27:07,280
but influenza can cause pneumonia and
 

5045
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:09,110
but influenza can cause pneumonia and
can kill you as does

5046
01:27:09,110 --> 01:27:09,120
can kill you as does
 

5047
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:10,950
can kill you as does
sorrows covey too so it depends on the

5048
01:27:10,950 --> 01:27:10,960
sorrows covey too so it depends on the
 

5049
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:13,270
sorrows covey too so it depends on the
the virus so there is another influenza

5050
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:13,280
the virus so there is another influenza
 

5051
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:15,030
the virus so there is another influenza
virus that's currently circulating so

virus that's currently circulating so
 

5053
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:16,629
virus that's currently circulating so
right now we have

5054
01:27:16,629 --> 01:27:16,639
right now we have
 

5055
01:27:16,639 --> 01:27:19,030
right now we have
the 2009 pandemic virus that's still

5056
01:27:19,030 --> 01:27:19,040
the 2009 pandemic virus that's still
 

5057
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:22,390
the 2009 pandemic virus that's still
around and then the 1968

5058
01:27:22,390 --> 01:27:22,400
around and then the 1968
 

5059
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:24,950
around and then the 1968
pandemic virus which was the one before

5060
01:27:24,950 --> 01:27:24,960
pandemic virus which was the one before
 

5061
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:27,430
pandemic virus which was the one before
2009 that one is still around too and

5062
01:27:27,430 --> 01:27:27,440
2009 that one is still around too and
 

5063
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:28,950
2009 that one is still around too and
that's more lethal

5064
01:27:28,950 --> 01:27:28,960
that's more lethal
 

5065
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:31,270
that's more lethal
and depending on the season some seasons

5066
01:27:31,270 --> 01:27:31,280
and depending on the season some seasons
 

5067
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:34,709
and depending on the season some seasons
the 2009 virus predominates some seasons

5068
01:27:34,709 --> 01:27:34,719
the 2009 virus predominates some seasons
 

5069
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:37,510
the 2009 virus predominates some seasons
the 1968 and when the 68 is around you

5070
01:27:37,510 --> 01:27:37,520
the 1968 and when the 68 is around you
 

5071
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:39,990
the 1968 and when the 68 is around you
get more lethality so we're living with

5072
01:27:39,990 --> 01:27:40,000
get more lethality so we're living with
 

5073
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,990
get more lethality so we're living with
the influenza family we haven't

5074
01:27:41,990 --> 01:27:42,000
the influenza family we haven't
 

5075
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,830
the influenza family we haven't
exterminated them

5076
01:27:43,830 --> 01:27:43,840
exterminated them
 

5077
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:45,990
exterminated them
right we never will never exterminate

5078
01:27:45,990 --> 01:27:46,000
right we never will never exterminate
 

5079
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,629
right we never will never exterminate
them why well because every shore bird

5080
01:27:48,629 --> 01:27:48,639
them why well because every shore bird
 

5081
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:50,790
them why well because every shore bird
in the world is infected with them you

5082
01:27:50,790 --> 01:27:50,800
in the world is infected with them you
 

5083
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:53,430
in the world is infected with them you
know gulls and turns and ducks and all

5084
01:27:53,430 --> 01:27:53,440
know gulls and turns and ducks and all
 

5085
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:54,709
know gulls and turns and ducks and all
sorts of things

5086
01:27:54,709 --> 01:27:54,719
sorts of things
 

5087
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:56,950
sorts of things
why can't we develop

5088
01:27:56,950 --> 01:27:56,960
why can't we develop
 

5089
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:59,590
why can't we develop
strong vaccines that defend against oh

5090
01:27:59,590 --> 01:27:59,600
strong vaccines that defend against oh
 

5091
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:01,750
strong vaccines that defend against oh
we could do that sure

5092
01:28:01,750 --> 01:28:01,760
we could do that sure
 

5093
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:04,070
we could do that sure
um but that would not eliminate them

5094
01:28:04,070 --> 01:28:04,080
um but that would not eliminate them
 

5095
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:05,510
um but that would not eliminate them
right from humans even if you had the

5096
01:28:05,510 --> 01:28:05,520
right from humans even if you had the
 

5097
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:08,149
right from humans even if you had the
best vaccine you would never get rid of

5098
01:28:08,149 --> 01:28:08,159
best vaccine you would never get rid of
 

5099
01:28:08,159 --> 01:28:10,310
best vaccine you would never get rid of
it in people because there would always

5100
01:28:10,310 --> 01:28:10,320
it in people because there would always
 

5101
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:12,390
it in people because there would always
be someone who's not vaccinated or in

5102
01:28:12,390 --> 01:28:12,400
be someone who's not vaccinated or in
 

5103
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:13,990
be someone who's not vaccinated or in
which the vaccine didn't work you know

5104
01:28:13,990 --> 01:28:14,000
which the vaccine didn't work you know
 

5105
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,149
which the vaccine didn't work you know
no but no vaccine is a hundred percent

5106
01:28:16,149 --> 01:28:16,159
no but no vaccine is a hundred percent
 

5107
01:28:16,159 --> 01:28:18,310
no but no vaccine is a hundred percent
right so well you just contradict

5108
01:28:18,310 --> 01:28:18,320
right so well you just contradict
 

5109
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:20,149
right so well you just contradict
yourself you had the he said the perfect

5110
01:28:20,149 --> 01:28:20,159
yourself you had the he said the perfect
 

5111
01:28:20,159 --> 01:28:23,110
yourself you had the he said the perfect
vaccine so

5112
01:28:23,110 --> 01:28:23,120
vaccine so
 

5113
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:24,629
vaccine so
but you then you said

5114
01:28:24,629 --> 01:28:24,639
but you then you said
 

5115
01:28:24,639 --> 01:28:27,270
but you then you said
like even if you had the professor yeah

5116
01:28:27,270 --> 01:28:27,280
like even if you had the professor yeah
 

5117
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:29,350
like even if you had the professor yeah
some people wouldn't get vaccinated but

5118
01:28:29,350 --> 01:28:29,360
some people wouldn't get vaccinated but
 

5119
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:30,790
some people wouldn't get vaccinated but
i understand what you mean so but i

5120
01:28:30,790 --> 01:28:30,800
i understand what you mean so but i
 

5121
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:32,629
i understand what you mean so but i
actually was asking how difficult is it

5122
01:28:32,629 --> 01:28:32,639
actually was asking how difficult is it
 

5123
01:28:32,639 --> 01:28:35,110
actually was asking how difficult is it
to make vaccines like that for

5124
01:28:35,110 --> 01:28:35,120
to make vaccines like that for
 

5125
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:36,629
to make vaccines like that for
it seems like it's very difficult to do

5126
01:28:36,629 --> 01:28:36,639
it seems like it's very difficult to do
 

5127
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:38,790
it seems like it's very difficult to do
that for the influenza virus

5128
01:28:38,790 --> 01:28:38,800
that for the influenza virus
 

5129
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:41,510
that for the influenza virus
so it's really easy to make an

5130
01:28:41,510 --> 01:28:41,520
so it's really easy to make an
 

5131
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:43,830
so it's really easy to make an
old-school vaccine

5132
01:28:43,830 --> 01:28:43,840
old-school vaccine
 

5133
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:45,430
old-school vaccine
so the the way

5134
01:28:45,430 --> 01:28:45,440
so the the way
 

5135
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:47,430
so the the way
the first influenza vaccines were made

5136
01:28:47,430 --> 01:28:47,440
the first influenza vaccines were made
 

5137
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:49,750
the first influenza vaccines were made
was actually jonas salk worked on them

5138
01:28:49,750 --> 01:28:49,760
was actually jonas salk worked on them
 

5139
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:53,189
was actually jonas salk worked on them
in the 40s you just grow lots of virus

5140
01:28:53,189 --> 01:28:53,199
in the 40s you just grow lots of virus
 

5141
01:28:53,199 --> 01:28:54,709
in the 40s you just grow lots of virus
and you grow it in eggs by the way

5142
01:28:54,709 --> 01:28:54,719
and you grow it in eggs by the way
 

5143
01:28:54,719 --> 01:28:56,950
and you grow it in eggs by the way
chicken eggs nice

5144
01:28:56,950 --> 01:28:56,960
chicken eggs nice
 

5145
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:59,030
chicken eggs nice
literally wait wait yeah chicken

5146
01:28:59,030 --> 01:28:59,040
literally wait wait yeah chicken
 

5147
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:00,870
literally wait wait yeah chicken
embryonated so they get fertilized and

5148
01:29:00,870 --> 01:29:00,880
embryonated so they get fertilized and
 

5149
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:03,110
embryonated so they get fertilized and
there's a 10 or 12 day embryo in it and

5150
01:29:03,110 --> 01:29:03,120
there's a 10 or 12 day embryo in it and
 

5151
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:05,030
there's a 10 or 12 day embryo in it and
you put virus in it it grows up and then

5152
01:29:05,030 --> 01:29:05,040
you put virus in it it grows up and then
 

5153
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:07,430
you put virus in it it grows up and then
you harvest it you get about 10 ml of

5154
01:29:07,430 --> 01:29:07,440
you harvest it you get about 10 ml of
 

5155
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:08,390
you harvest it you get about 10 ml of
fluid

5156
01:29:08,390 --> 01:29:08,400
fluid
 

5157
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:10,629
fluid
and then you take that you treat it with

5158
01:29:10,629 --> 01:29:10,639
and then you take that you treat it with
 

5159
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:12,629
and then you take that you treat it with
formaldehyde or formalin and it

5160
01:29:12,629 --> 01:29:12,639
formaldehyde or formalin and it
 

5161
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:14,950
formaldehyde or formalin and it
inactivates the virus so it's no longer

5162
01:29:14,950 --> 01:29:14,960
inactivates the virus so it's no longer
 

5163
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:16,470
inactivates the virus so it's no longer
infectious

5164
01:29:16,470 --> 01:29:16,480
infectious
 

5165
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:18,470
infectious
and you just inject that into people and

5166
01:29:18,470 --> 01:29:18,480
and you just inject that into people and
 

5167
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:19,910
and you just inject that into people and
that was the first flu vaccine it was

5168
01:29:19,910 --> 01:29:19,920
that was the first flu vaccine it was
 

5169
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:22,149
that was the first flu vaccine it was
made for the the us army actually and

5170
01:29:22,149 --> 01:29:22,159
made for the the us army actually and
 

5171
01:29:22,159 --> 01:29:24,390
made for the the us army actually and
then it got moved over to people we

5172
01:29:24,390 --> 01:29:24,400
then it got moved over to people we
 

5173
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:27,270
then it got moved over to people we
still use that old school tech today

5174
01:29:27,270 --> 01:29:27,280
still use that old school tech today
 

5175
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:29,510
still use that old school tech today
so you're you're taking

5176
01:29:29,510 --> 01:29:29,520
so you're you're taking
 

5177
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:31,669
so you're you're taking
can you help me out here okay so this is

5178
01:29:31,669 --> 01:29:31,679
can you help me out here okay so this is
 

5179
01:29:31,679 --> 01:29:34,390
can you help me out here okay so this is
a good time to talk about vaccines

5180
01:29:34,390 --> 01:29:34,400
a good time to talk about vaccines
 

5181
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:36,870
a good time to talk about vaccines
okay so you're talking about

5182
01:29:36,870 --> 01:29:36,880
okay so you're talking about
 

5183
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:39,189
okay so you're talking about
you're taking the actual virus right you

5184
01:29:39,189 --> 01:29:39,199
you're taking the actual virus right you
 

5185
01:29:39,199 --> 01:29:42,470
you're taking the actual virus right you
put it in an egg you let it grow up

5186
01:29:42,470 --> 01:29:42,480
put it in an egg you let it grow up
 

5187
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:43,990
put it in an egg you let it grow up
it's very funny that you put in an egg

5188
01:29:43,990 --> 01:29:44,000
it's very funny that you put in an egg
 

5189
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:47,030
it's very funny that you put in an egg
it's very um it's very poetic

5190
01:29:47,030 --> 01:29:47,040
it's very um it's very poetic
 

5191
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:50,229
it's very um it's very poetic
and then uh how do you make it not

5192
01:29:50,229 --> 01:29:50,239
and then uh how do you make it not
 

5193
01:29:50,239 --> 01:29:51,350
and then uh how do you make it not
um

5194
01:29:51,350 --> 01:29:51,360
um
 

5195
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,830
um
infection uh not effective or whatever

5196
01:29:53,830 --> 01:29:53,840
infection uh not effective or whatever
 

5197
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:55,669
infection uh not effective or whatever
not infectious not infectious is that

5198
01:29:55,669 --> 01:29:55,679
not infectious not infectious is that
 

5199
01:29:55,679 --> 01:29:57,669
not infectious not infectious is that
the right term here yeah so how do you

5200
01:29:57,669 --> 01:29:57,679
the right term here yeah so how do you
 

5201
01:29:57,679 --> 01:29:59,830
the right term here yeah so how do you
make it not infectious you can

5202
01:29:59,830 --> 01:29:59,840
make it not infectious you can
 

5203
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:01,910
make it not infectious you can
treat it with any number of chemicals

5204
01:30:01,910 --> 01:30:01,920
treat it with any number of chemicals
 

5205
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:02,790
treat it with any number of chemicals
that'll

5206
01:30:02,790 --> 01:30:02,800
that'll
 

5207
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:05,350
that'll
disrupt the particles so it no longer

5208
01:30:05,350 --> 01:30:05,360
disrupt the particles so it no longer
 

5209
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:07,750
disrupt the particles so it no longer
so that that step of disrupting the

5210
01:30:07,750 --> 01:30:07,760
so that that step of disrupting the
 

5211
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:08,950
so that that step of disrupting the
particle

5212
01:30:08,950 --> 01:30:08,960
particle
 

5213
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:10,950
particle
is that very specific to any a

5214
01:30:10,950 --> 01:30:10,960
is that very specific to any a
 

5215
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:13,669
is that very specific to any a
particular variant particle no the same

5216
01:30:13,669 --> 01:30:13,679
particular variant particle no the same
 

5217
01:30:13,679 --> 01:30:15,430
particular variant particle no the same
collection of chemicals you can use for

5218
01:30:15,430 --> 01:30:15,440
collection of chemicals you can use for
 

5219
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:17,030
collection of chemicals you can use for
all kinds of action and which have been

5220
01:30:17,030 --> 01:30:17,040
all kinds of action and which have been
 

5221
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:19,750
all kinds of action and which have been
used for sars cov2 vaccines also same

5222
01:30:19,750 --> 01:30:19,760
used for sars cov2 vaccines also same
 

5223
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:22,149
used for sars cov2 vaccines also same
technology okay so what are

5224
01:30:22,149 --> 01:30:22,159
technology okay so what are
 

5225
01:30:22,159 --> 01:30:23,750
technology okay so what are
there's several things to ask so you

5226
01:30:23,750 --> 01:30:23,760
there's several things to ask so you
 

5227
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:26,470
there's several things to ask so you
called it old school in a way that's uh

5228
01:30:26,470 --> 01:30:26,480
called it old school in a way that's uh
 

5229
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:28,229
called it old school in a way that's uh
slightly dismissive like people talk

5230
01:30:28,229 --> 01:30:28,239
slightly dismissive like people talk
 

5231
01:30:28,239 --> 01:30:31,750
slightly dismissive like people talk
about windows 98 or something uh

5232
01:30:31,750 --> 01:30:31,760
about windows 98 or something uh
 

5233
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:32,629
about windows 98 or something uh
so there

5234
01:30:32,629 --> 01:30:32,639
so there
 

5235
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:34,950
so there
so is there risks involved with it or is

5236
01:30:34,950 --> 01:30:34,960
so is there risks involved with it or is
 

5237
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:36,790
so is there risks involved with it or is
it just difficult to produce large

5238
01:30:36,790 --> 01:30:36,800
it just difficult to produce large
 

5239
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:39,110
it just difficult to produce large
amounts no it's a lot of eggs it's very

5240
01:30:39,110 --> 01:30:39,120
amounts no it's a lot of eggs it's very
 

5241
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:41,189
amounts no it's a lot of eggs it's very
easy i mean you could do it in cells and

5242
01:30:41,189 --> 01:30:41,199
easy i mean you could do it in cells and
 

5243
01:30:41,199 --> 01:30:43,590
easy i mean you could do it in cells and
culture but eggs were convenient and

5244
01:30:43,590 --> 01:30:43,600
culture but eggs were convenient and
 

5245
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:45,510
culture but eggs were convenient and
in the 1940s we didn't have cells in

5246
01:30:45,510 --> 01:30:45,520
in the 1940s we didn't have cells in
 

5247
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:47,270
in the 1940s we didn't have cells in
culture we didn't know how to do that so

5248
01:30:47,270 --> 01:30:47,280
culture we didn't know how to do that so
 

5249
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:49,830
culture we didn't know how to do that so
we had to use something else

5250
01:30:49,830 --> 01:30:49,840
we had to use something else
 

5251
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:52,149
we had to use something else
it's easy to do

5252
01:30:52,149 --> 01:30:52,159
it's easy to do
 

5253
01:30:52,159 --> 01:30:55,030
it's easy to do
but the process of inactivating

5254
01:30:55,030 --> 01:30:55,040
but the process of inactivating
 

5255
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:56,870
but the process of inactivating
the virus with a chemical

5256
01:30:56,870 --> 01:30:56,880
the virus with a chemical
 

5257
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:59,430
the virus with a chemical
makes it not not the best vaccine you

5258
01:30:59,430 --> 01:30:59,440
makes it not not the best vaccine you
 

5259
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:01,990
makes it not not the best vaccine you
can make the flu vaccines that we have

5260
01:31:01,990 --> 01:31:02,000
can make the flu vaccines that we have
 

5261
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,550
can make the flu vaccines that we have
today which are mostly based on this

5262
01:31:04,550 --> 01:31:04,560
today which are mostly based on this
 

5263
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:07,270
today which are mostly based on this
inactivation this is called inactivated

5264
01:31:07,270 --> 01:31:07,280
inactivation this is called inactivated
 

5265
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:11,910
inactivation this is called inactivated
virus vaccines oh so like the kind of uh

5266
01:31:11,910 --> 01:31:11,920
virus vaccines oh so like the kind of uh
 

5267
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:13,669
virus vaccines oh so like the kind of uh
thing it presents to the immune system

5268
01:31:13,669 --> 01:31:13,679
thing it presents to the immune system
 

5269
01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:15,110
thing it presents to the immune system
to train on

5270
01:31:15,110 --> 01:31:15,120
to train on
 

5271
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:17,430
to train on
not right it's not it's not

5272
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:17,440
not right it's not it's not
 

5273
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:19,669
not right it's not it's not
it's not close to the actual virus yes

5274
01:31:19,669 --> 01:31:19,679
it's not close to the actual virus yes
 

5275
01:31:19,679 --> 01:31:21,110
it's not close to the actual virus yes
that's what we think so that's why

5276
01:31:21,110 --> 01:31:21,120
that's what we think so that's why
 

5277
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:23,270
that's what we think so that's why
probably the flu vaccines are just not

5278
01:31:23,270 --> 01:31:23,280
probably the flu vaccines are just not
 

5279
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:25,030
probably the flu vaccines are just not
very good you know

5280
01:31:25,030 --> 01:31:25,040
very good you know
 

5281
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:26,950
very good you know
60

5282
01:31:26,950 --> 01:31:26,960
60
 

5283
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:29,270
60
efficiency at the best right which is

5284
01:31:29,270 --> 01:31:29,280
efficiency at the best right which is
 

5285
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:31,350
efficiency at the best right which is
not really good what does it mean what

5286
01:31:31,350 --> 01:31:31,360
not really good what does it mean what
 

5287
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:32,950
not really good what does it mean what
is the measure of efficiency for a

5288
01:31:32,950 --> 01:31:32,960
is the measure of efficiency for a
 

5289
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:34,950
is the measure of efficiency for a
vaccine well

5290
01:31:34,950 --> 01:31:34,960
vaccine well
 

5291
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:36,550
vaccine well
it's how it does in the general

5292
01:31:36,550 --> 01:31:36,560
it's how it does in the general
 

5293
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:38,950
it's how it does in the general
population at preventing influenza at

5294
01:31:38,950 --> 01:31:38,960
population at preventing influenza at
 

5295
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:40,629
population at preventing influenza at
preventing

5296
01:31:40,629 --> 01:31:40,639
preventing
 

5297
01:31:40,639 --> 01:31:42,470
preventing
illness not infection we usually don't

5298
01:31:42,470 --> 01:31:42,480
illness not infection we usually don't
 

5299
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:43,430
illness not infection we usually don't
measure

5300
01:31:43,430 --> 01:31:43,440
measure
 

5301
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:44,629
measure
infection

5302
01:31:44,629 --> 01:31:44,639
infection
 

5303
01:31:44,639 --> 01:31:46,229
infection
when we're testing a vaccine we just

5304
01:31:46,229 --> 01:31:46,239
when we're testing a vaccine we just
 

5305
01:31:46,239 --> 01:31:48,550
when we're testing a vaccine we just
measure sickness that's really easy to

5306
01:31:48,550 --> 01:31:48,560
measure sickness that's really easy to
 

5307
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:50,070
measure sickness that's really easy to
score right

5308
01:31:50,070 --> 01:31:50,080
score right
 

5309
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:52,390
score right
you do a trial and you say if you feel

5310
01:31:52,390 --> 01:31:52,400
you do a trial and you say if you feel
 

5311
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:55,189
you do a trial and you say if you feel
sick give us a call we'll tell you

5312
01:31:55,189 --> 01:31:55,199
sick give us a call we'll tell you
 

5313
01:31:55,199 --> 01:31:58,070
sick give us a call we'll tell you
so uh yeah i mean what's what's sickness

5314
01:31:58,070 --> 01:31:58,080
so uh yeah i mean what's what's sickness
 

5315
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:01,510
so uh yeah i mean what's what's sickness
sickness is the presence of symptoms

5316
01:32:01,510 --> 01:32:01,520
sickness is the presence of symptoms
 

5317
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:03,669
sickness is the presence of symptoms
so this is good time to say what a

5318
01:32:03,669 --> 01:32:03,679
so this is good time to say what a
 

5319
01:32:03,679 --> 01:32:06,870
so this is good time to say what a
symptom is okay a symptom is what you

5320
01:32:06,870 --> 01:32:06,880
symptom is okay a symptom is what you
 

5321
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:08,870
symptom is okay a symptom is what you
only can feel

5322
01:32:08,870 --> 01:32:08,880
only can feel
 

5323
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:11,910
only can feel
only you can feel an upset stomach or a

5324
01:32:11,910 --> 01:32:11,920
only you can feel an upset stomach or a
 

5325
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:13,910
only you can feel an upset stomach or a
sore throat or that sort of the lived

5326
01:32:13,910 --> 01:32:13,920
sore throat or that sort of the lived
 

5327
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:17,030
sore throat or that sort of the lived
experience okay so the sign is something

5328
01:32:17,030 --> 01:32:17,040
experience okay so the sign is something
 

5329
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:19,669
experience okay so the sign is something
that someone could measure and tell that

5330
01:32:19,669 --> 01:32:19,679
that someone could measure and tell that
 

5331
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:21,270
that someone could measure and tell that
you're infected like

5332
01:32:21,270 --> 01:32:21,280
you're infected like
 

5333
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:24,470
you're infected like
a virus in your nasopharynx or

5334
01:32:24,470 --> 01:32:24,480
a virus in your nasopharynx or
 

5335
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:27,030
a virus in your nasopharynx or
something else right signs and symptoms

5336
01:32:27,030 --> 01:32:27,040
something else right signs and symptoms
 

5337
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:30,070
something else right signs and symptoms
and so in a vaccine trial they tell you

5338
01:32:30,070 --> 01:32:30,080
and so in a vaccine trial they tell you
 

5339
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,830
and so in a vaccine trial they tell you
if you have any of these symptoms they

5340
01:32:31,830 --> 01:32:31,840
if you have any of these symptoms they
 

5341
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:34,070
if you have any of these symptoms they
give you a paper with the exact symptoms

5342
01:32:34,070 --> 01:32:34,080
give you a paper with the exact symptoms
 

5343
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:36,310
give you a paper with the exact symptoms
listed to make sure you're picking them

5344
01:32:36,310 --> 01:32:36,320
listed to make sure you're picking them
 

5345
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:38,870
listed to make sure you're picking them
up right so for flu it'd probably be

5346
01:32:38,870 --> 01:32:38,880
up right so for flu it'd probably be
 

5347
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:41,350
up right so for flu it'd probably be
fever sore throat cough

5348
01:32:41,350 --> 01:32:41,360
fever sore throat cough
 

5349
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:43,510
fever sore throat cough
you call them and then they will do a

5350
01:32:43,510 --> 01:32:43,520
you call them and then they will do a
 

5351
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:45,669
you call them and then they will do a
pcr make sure you you've got flu and not

5352
01:32:45,669 --> 01:32:45,679
pcr make sure you you've got flu and not
 

5353
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:47,350
pcr make sure you you've got flu and not
some other virus that makes similar

5354
01:32:47,350 --> 01:32:47,360
some other virus that makes similar
 

5355
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:48,870
some other virus that makes similar
symptoms

5356
01:32:48,870 --> 01:32:48,880
symptoms
 

5357
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:49,990
symptoms
and then

5358
01:32:49,990 --> 01:32:50,000
and then
 

5359
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,629
and then
they would say are you a vaccine or

5360
01:32:52,629 --> 01:32:52,639
they would say are you a vaccine or
 

5361
01:32:52,639 --> 01:32:55,030
they would say are you a vaccine or
non-vaccine arm and count up all the

5362
01:32:55,030 --> 01:32:55,040
non-vaccine arm and count up all the
 

5363
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:57,030
non-vaccine arm and count up all the
infections and see how the vaccine did

5364
01:32:57,030 --> 01:32:57,040
infections and see how the vaccine did
 

5365
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:59,189
infections and see how the vaccine did
basically that's so fascinating because

5366
01:32:59,189 --> 01:32:59,199
basically that's so fascinating because
 

5367
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:00,790
basically that's so fascinating because
um

5368
01:33:00,790 --> 01:33:00,800
um
 

5369
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:03,189
um
the reporting so symptom is what you

5370
01:33:03,189 --> 01:33:03,199
the reporting so symptom is what you
 

5371
01:33:03,199 --> 01:33:07,110
the reporting so symptom is what you
feel yes and certainly the mind

5372
01:33:07,110 --> 01:33:07,120
feel yes and certainly the mind
 

5373
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:10,310
feel yes and certainly the mind
has a ability to conjure up feelings oh

5374
01:33:10,310 --> 01:33:10,320
has a ability to conjure up feelings oh
 

5375
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:14,550
has a ability to conjure up feelings oh
yes absolutely and so like culturally

5376
01:33:14,550 --> 01:33:14,560
yes absolutely and so like culturally
 

5377
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:16,310
yes absolutely and so like culturally
you know maybe there was a time in our

5378
01:33:16,310 --> 01:33:16,320
you know maybe there was a time in our
 

5379
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:17,910
you know maybe there was a time in our
culture where

5380
01:33:17,910 --> 01:33:17,920
culture where
 

5381
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:21,270
culture where
it was uh looked down upon to

5382
01:33:21,270 --> 01:33:21,280
it was uh looked down upon to
 

5383
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:23,590
it was uh looked down upon to
to feel sick or something like that like

5384
01:33:23,590 --> 01:33:23,600
to feel sick or something like that like
 

5385
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:25,830
to feel sick or something like that like
toughen up kind of thing yes and so then

5386
01:33:25,830 --> 01:33:25,840
toughen up kind of thing yes and so then
 

5387
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:27,189
toughen up kind of thing yes and so then
you probably have

5388
01:33:27,189 --> 01:33:27,199
you probably have
 

5389
01:33:27,199 --> 01:33:29,430
you probably have
very few symptoms being reported

5390
01:33:29,430 --> 01:33:29,440
very few symptoms being reported
 

5391
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:31,350
very few symptoms being reported
absolutely and then absolutely and now

5392
01:33:31,350 --> 01:33:31,360
absolutely and then absolutely and now
 

5393
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:33,270
absolutely and then absolutely and now
is like much more

5394
01:33:33,270 --> 01:33:33,280
is like much more
 

5395
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:34,830
is like much more
um i don't

5396
01:33:34,830 --> 01:33:34,840
um i don't
 

5397
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:37,110
um i don't
know perhaps you're much more likely to

5398
01:33:37,110 --> 01:33:37,120
know perhaps you're much more likely to
 

5399
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:38,790
know perhaps you're much more likely to
report symptoms now it's fascinating

5400
01:33:38,790 --> 01:33:38,800
report symptoms now it's fascinating
 

5401
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:41,110
report symptoms now it's fascinating
because then it changes oh it is

5402
01:33:41,110 --> 01:33:41,120
because then it changes oh it is
 

5403
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:43,030
because then it changes oh it is
definitely a perception because for you

5404
01:33:43,030 --> 01:33:43,040
definitely a perception because for you
 

5405
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:44,950
definitely a perception because for you
know your symptom may be nothing to me

5406
01:33:44,950 --> 01:33:44,960
know your symptom may be nothing to me
 

5407
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:47,110
know your symptom may be nothing to me
or vice versa right so when you're doing

5408
01:33:47,110 --> 01:33:47,120
or vice versa right so when you're doing
 

5409
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:49,189
or vice versa right so when you're doing
this it's a little bit of a

5410
01:33:49,189 --> 01:33:49,199
this it's a little bit of a
 

5411
01:33:49,199 --> 01:33:50,470
this it's a little bit of a
imprecise

5412
01:33:50,470 --> 01:33:50,480
imprecise
 

5413
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:53,350
imprecise
science because in in and even it's a

5414
01:33:53,350 --> 01:33:53,360
science because in in and even it's a
 

5415
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:56,149
science because in in and even it's a
cultural thing in some countries

5416
01:33:56,149 --> 01:33:56,159
cultural thing in some countries
 

5417
01:33:56,159 --> 01:33:57,350
cultural thing in some countries
something that would make us feel

5418
01:33:57,350 --> 01:33:57,360
something that would make us feel
 

5419
01:33:57,360 --> 01:33:58,790
something that would make us feel
horrible they wouldn't even bother

5420
01:33:58,790 --> 01:33:58,800
horrible they wouldn't even bother
 

5421
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:00,390
horrible they wouldn't even bother
reporting no i didn't have any symptoms

5422
01:34:00,390 --> 01:34:00,400
reporting no i didn't have any symptoms
 

5423
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:02,149
reporting no i didn't have any symptoms
so it's a little bit imprecise and it

5424
01:34:02,149 --> 01:34:02,159
so it's a little bit imprecise and it
 

5425
01:34:02,159 --> 01:34:04,390
so it's a little bit imprecise and it
clouds the results so if you can measure

5426
01:34:04,390 --> 01:34:04,400
clouds the results so if you can measure
 

5427
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:06,229
clouds the results so if you can measure
things it's always better but you start

5428
01:34:06,229 --> 01:34:06,239
things it's always better but you start
 

5429
01:34:06,239 --> 01:34:07,669
things it's always better but you start
out with a symptom

5430
01:34:07,669 --> 01:34:07,679
out with a symptom
 

5431
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:10,390
out with a symptom
and if you say if someone tells you this

5432
01:34:10,390 --> 01:34:10,400
and if you say if someone tells you this
 

5433
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:13,189
and if you say if someone tells you this
virus 20 of the people

5434
01:34:13,189 --> 01:34:13,199
virus 20 of the people
 

5435
01:34:13,199 --> 01:34:14,229
virus 20 of the people
are

5436
01:34:14,229 --> 01:34:14,239
are
 

5437
01:34:14,239 --> 01:34:19,350
are
asymptomatic they don't report symptoms

5438
01:34:19,350 --> 01:34:19,360
asymptomatic they don't report symptoms
 

5439
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:21,430
asymptomatic they don't report symptoms
that number is probably not as a

5440
01:34:21,430 --> 01:34:21,440
that number is probably not as a
 

5441
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:23,030
that number is probably not as a
constant it depends where you did the

5442
01:34:23,030 --> 01:34:23,040
constant it depends where you did the
 

5443
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:24,149
constant it depends where you did the

it could be different in china versus
 

5447
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:28,390
it could be different in china versus
south america europe et cetera yeah i

5448
01:34:28,390 --> 01:34:28,400
south america europe et cetera yeah i
 

5449

south america europe et cetera yeah i
mean i was trying to figure so i took

mean i was trying to figure so i took
 

5451
01:34:30,239 --> 01:34:33,910
mean i was trying to figure so i took
two shots of the fisa vaccine i had zero

5452
01:34:33,910 --> 01:34:33,920
two shots of the fisa vaccine i had zero
 

5453
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:35,350
two shots of the fisa vaccine i had zero
symptoms wow

5454
01:34:35,350 --> 01:34:35,360
symptoms wow
 

5455
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:37,350
symptoms wow
so and i was wondering well see but

5456
01:34:37,350 --> 01:34:37,360
so and i was wondering well see but
 

5457
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:39,669
so and i was wondering well see but
that's my feelings right this is not

5458
01:34:39,669 --> 01:34:39,679
that's my feelings right this is not
 

5459
01:34:39,679 --> 01:34:42,070
that's my feelings right this is not
because i i felt fine i was waiting did

5460
01:34:42,070 --> 01:34:42,080
because i i felt fine i was waiting did
 

5461
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:45,350
because i i felt fine i was waiting did

exhaustion no
um but see like i have an insane

5472
01:34:55,750 --> 01:34:55,760
um but see like i have an insane
 

5473

um but see like i have an insane
sleeping schedule i already put myself

5474
01:34:57,750 --> 01:34:57,760
sleeping schedule i already put myself
 

5475
01:34:57,760 --> 01:35:00,870
sleeping schedule i already put myself
through crazy stuff that said

5476
01:35:00,870 --> 01:35:00,880
through crazy stuff that said
 

5477
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:02,629
through crazy stuff that said
maybe i was expecting something really

5478
01:35:02,629 --> 01:35:02,639
maybe i was expecting something really
 

5479
01:35:02,639 --> 01:35:04,709
maybe i was expecting something really
bad like i was way

5480
01:35:04,709 --> 01:35:04,719
bad like i was way
 

5481
01:35:04,719 --> 01:35:06,950
bad like i was way
and therefore didn't feel it then but i

5482
01:35:06,950 --> 01:35:06,960
and therefore didn't feel it then but i
 

5483
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:08,950
and therefore didn't feel it then but i
also got um

5484
01:35:08,950 --> 01:35:08,960
also got um
 

5485
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:11,109
also got um
allergy shots

5486
01:35:11,109 --> 01:35:11,119
allergy shots
 

5487
01:35:11,119 --> 01:35:11,910
allergy shots
and

5488
01:35:11,910 --> 01:35:11,920
and
 

5489
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:14,790
and
those i was out all next day like

5490
01:35:14,790 --> 01:35:14,800
those i was out all next day like
 

5491
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:16,950
those i was out all next day like
exhausted for some reason so that that

5492
01:35:16,950 --> 01:35:16,960
exhausted for some reason so that that
 

5493
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:18,470
exhausted for some reason so that that
gave me like

5494
01:35:18,470 --> 01:35:18,480
gave me like
 

5495
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:20,470
gave me like
a sense like okay

5496
01:35:20,470 --> 01:35:20,480
a sense like okay
 

5497
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:22,550
a sense like okay
at least sometimes i can feel shitty

5498
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:22,560
at least sometimes i can feel shitty
 

5499
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:24,390
at least sometimes i can feel shitty
that's good to know

5500
01:35:24,390 --> 01:35:24,400
that's good to know
 

5501
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:25,910
that's good to know
sure and then then

5502
01:35:25,910 --> 01:35:25,920
sure and then then
 

5503
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:28,229
sure and then then
with the vaccine it didn't but the the

5504
01:35:28,229 --> 01:35:28,239
with the vaccine it didn't but the the
 

5505
01:35:28,239 --> 01:35:30,550
with the vaccine it didn't but the the
question is like how much does my mind

5506
01:35:30,550 --> 01:35:30,560
question is like how much does my mind
 

5507
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:32,070
question is like how much does my mind
come into play there

5508
01:35:32,070 --> 01:35:32,080
come into play there
 

5509
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:35,830
come into play there
are the expectations of symptoms uh

5510
01:35:35,830 --> 01:35:35,840
are the expectations of symptoms uh
 

5511
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:37,830
are the expectations of symptoms uh
the expectations of

5512
01:35:37,830 --> 01:35:37,840
the expectations of
 

5513
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:39,990
the expectations of
not feeling well how does that affect

5514
01:35:39,990 --> 01:35:40,000
not feeling well how does that affect
 

5515
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,350
not feeling well how does that affect
the sort of the self-reporting the

5516
01:35:41,350 --> 01:35:41,360
the sort of the self-reporting the
 

5517
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:43,590
the sort of the self-reporting the
symptoms i think it's definitely

5518
01:35:43,590 --> 01:35:43,600
symptoms i think it's definitely
 

5519
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:45,510
symptoms i think it's definitely
a variable there but um there's

5520
01:35:45,510 --> 01:35:45,520
a variable there but um there's
 

5521
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:47,030
a variable there but um there's
certainly many people that don't feel

5522
01:35:47,030 --> 01:35:47,040
certainly many people that don't feel
 

5523
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:48,629
certainly many people that don't feel
anything after the vaccines and there's

5524
01:35:48,629 --> 01:35:48,639
anything after the vaccines and there's
 

5525
01:35:48,639 --> 01:35:51,590
anything after the vaccines and there's
some that have a whole range of

5526
01:35:51,590 --> 01:35:51,600
some that have a whole range of
 

5527
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:54,870
some that have a whole range of
things like soreness and fever etc yeah

5528
01:35:54,870 --> 01:35:54,880
things like soreness and fever etc yeah
 

5529
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:56,070
things like soreness and fever etc yeah
so okay you were talking about the

5530
01:35:56,070 --> 01:35:56,080
so okay you were talking about the
 

5531
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:58,470
so okay you were talking about the
old-school development inside the egg

5532
01:35:58,470 --> 01:35:58,480
old-school development inside the egg
 

5533
01:35:58,480 --> 01:35:59,430
old-school development inside the egg
right

5534
01:35:59,430 --> 01:35:59,440
right
 

5535
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:01,830
right
what's uh what's what's better than that

5536
01:36:01,830 --> 01:36:01,840
what's uh what's what's better than that
 

5537
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:03,669
what's uh what's what's better than that
what's what so then the next generation

5538
01:36:03,669 --> 01:36:03,679
what's what so then the next generation
 

5539
01:36:03,679 --> 01:36:06,550
what's what so then the next generation
of vaccines which arose in the 50s were

5540
01:36:06,550 --> 01:36:06,560
of vaccines which arose in the 50s were
 

5541
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:07,750
of vaccines which arose in the 50s were
what we call

5542
01:36:07,750 --> 01:36:07,760
what we call
 

5543
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:10,870
what we call
replication competent where the virus

5544
01:36:10,870 --> 01:36:10,880
replication competent where the virus
 

5545
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:12,709
replication competent where the virus
you're taking it's actually reproducing

5546
01:36:12,709 --> 01:36:12,719
you're taking it's actually reproducing
 

5547
01:36:12,719 --> 01:36:13,830
you're taking it's actually reproducing
in you

5548
01:36:13,830 --> 01:36:13,840
in you
 

5549
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:15,990
in you
yeah that sounds safe

5550
01:36:15,990 --> 01:36:16,000
yeah that sounds safe
 

5551
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:16,709
yeah that sounds safe
and

5552
01:36:16,709 --> 01:36:16,719
and
 

5553
01:36:16,719 --> 01:36:19,109
and
it can be somewhat problematic yes as

5554
01:36:19,109 --> 01:36:19,119
it can be somewhat problematic yes as
 

5555
01:36:19,119 --> 01:36:20,709
it can be somewhat problematic yes as
you might imagine because you know once

5556
01:36:20,709 --> 01:36:20,719
you might imagine because you know once
 

5557
01:36:20,719 --> 01:36:22,550
you might imagine because you know once
you put that virus in you you have no

5558
01:36:22,550 --> 01:36:22,560
you put that virus in you you have no
 

5559
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:24,470
you put that virus in you you have no
more control right it's not like you

5560
01:36:24,470 --> 01:36:24,480
more control right it's not like you
 

5561
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:26,950
more control right it's not like you
have a kill switch in it which actually

5562
01:36:26,950 --> 01:36:26,960
have a kill switch in it which actually
 

5563
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:29,109
have a kill switch in it which actually
would be a great idea to put in

5564
01:36:29,109 --> 01:36:29,119
would be a great idea to put in
 

5565
01:36:29,119 --> 01:36:29,910
would be a great idea to put in
like

5566
01:36:29,910 --> 01:36:29,920
like
 

5567
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:32,229
like
like nano nano bots what composition no

5568
01:36:32,229 --> 01:36:32,239
like nano nano bots what composition no
 

5569
01:36:32,239 --> 01:36:34,229
like nano nano bots what composition no
you could just put something in there if

5570
01:36:34,229 --> 01:36:34,239
you could just put something in there if
 

5571
01:36:34,239 --> 01:36:36,310
you could just put something in there if
you added a drug you would do it shut it

5572
01:36:36,310 --> 01:36:36,320
you added a drug you would do it shut it
 

5573
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:39,030
you added a drug you would do it shut it
off right and people are thinking about

5574
01:36:39,030 --> 01:36:39,040
off right and people are thinking about
 

5575
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:41,030
off right and people are thinking about
that because now we're engineering

5576
01:36:41,030 --> 01:36:41,040
that because now we're engineering
 

5577
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:42,709
that because now we're engineering
viruses to treat

5578
01:36:42,709 --> 01:36:42,719
viruses to treat
 

5579
01:36:42,719 --> 01:36:45,430
viruses to treat
cancers and other diseases and we may

5580
01:36:45,430 --> 01:36:45,440
cancers and other diseases and we may
 

5581
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:47,030
cancers and other diseases and we may
want to put kill switches in them just

5582
01:36:47,030 --> 01:36:47,040
want to put kill switches in them just
 

5583
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:48,629
want to put kill switches in them just
to make sure they don't run away oh

5584
01:36:48,629 --> 01:36:48,639
to make sure they don't run away oh
 

5585
01:36:48,639 --> 01:36:49,990
to make sure they don't run away oh
interesting so you can like deploy a

5586
01:36:49,990 --> 01:36:50,000
interesting so you can like deploy a
 

5587
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:51,750
interesting so you can like deploy a
drug that binds to the

5588
01:36:51,750 --> 01:36:51,760
drug that binds to the
 

5589
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:54,870
drug that binds to the
this this virus that would shut it off

5590
01:36:54,870 --> 01:36:54,880
this this virus that would shut it off
 

5591
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:56,390
this this virus that would shut it off
in the body something like that

5592
01:36:56,390 --> 01:36:56,400
in the body something like that
 

5593
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:57,750
in the body something like that
something like that yeah that would be

5594
01:36:57,750 --> 01:36:57,760
something like that yeah that would be
 

5595
01:36:57,760 --> 01:36:59,750
something like that yeah that would be
the idea you'd have to engineer it in

5596
01:36:59,750 --> 01:36:59,760
the idea you'd have to engineer it in
 

5597
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:01,750
the idea you'd have to engineer it in
anyway these were the first one was

5598
01:37:01,750 --> 01:37:01,760
anyway these were the first one was
 

5599
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:04,550
anyway these were the first one was
yellow fever vaccine that was made

5600
01:37:04,550 --> 01:37:04,560
yellow fever vaccine that was made
 

5601
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:07,030
yellow fever vaccine that was made
because that was a big problem and this

5602
01:37:07,030 --> 01:37:07,040
because that was a big problem and this
 

5603
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:09,750
because that was a big problem and this
virus and the way you do this

5604
01:37:09,750 --> 01:37:09,760
virus and the way you do this
 

5605
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:12,629
virus and the way you do this
back in the old day was empirical

5606
01:37:12,629 --> 01:37:12,639
back in the old day was empirical
 

5607
01:37:12,639 --> 01:37:14,790
back in the old day was empirical
so max tyler who did the yellow fever

5608
01:37:14,790 --> 01:37:14,800
so max tyler who did the yellow fever
 

5609
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:16,390
so max tyler who did the yellow fever
vaccine he took the virus which is a

5610
01:37:16,390 --> 01:37:16,400
vaccine he took the virus which is a
 

5611
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:17,430
vaccine he took the virus which is a
human

5612
01:37:17,430 --> 01:37:17,440
human
 

5613
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:19,510
human
virus right

5614
01:37:19,510 --> 01:37:19,520
virus right
 

5615
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:21,510
virus right
and he infected

5616
01:37:21,510 --> 01:37:21,520
and he infected
 

5617
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:24,790
and he infected
i think he used chick embryos

5618
01:37:24,790 --> 01:37:24,800
i think he used chick embryos
 

5619
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:26,390
i think he used chick embryos
and he went from one embryo to another

5620
01:37:26,390 --> 01:37:26,400
and he went from one embryo to another
 

5621
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:27,669
and he went from one embryo to another
and just kept passing it did that

5622
01:37:27,669 --> 01:37:27,679
and just kept passing it did that
 

5623
01:37:27,679 --> 01:37:29,189
and just kept passing it did that
hundreds of times

5624
01:37:29,189 --> 01:37:29,199
hundreds of times
 

5625
01:37:29,199 --> 01:37:32,229
hundreds of times
and every 10 passages he would take the

5626
01:37:32,229 --> 01:37:32,239
and every 10 passages he would take the
 

5627
01:37:32,239 --> 01:37:34,709
and every 10 passages he would take the
virus and put it in a a mouse or a

5628
01:37:34,709 --> 01:37:34,719
virus and put it in a a mouse or a
 

5629
01:37:34,719 --> 01:37:36,870
virus and put it in a a mouse or a
monkey whatever his model was and then

5630
01:37:36,870 --> 01:37:36,880
monkey whatever his model was and then
 

5631
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:38,229
monkey whatever his model was and then
eventually he got a virus that didn't

5632
01:37:38,229 --> 01:37:38,239
eventually he got a virus that didn't
 

5633
01:37:38,239 --> 01:37:40,870
eventually he got a virus that didn't
cause any disease after 200 and some

5634
01:37:40,870 --> 01:37:40,880
cause any disease after 200 and some
 

5635
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:42,790
cause any disease after 200 and some
passages and then that was tested in

5636
01:37:42,790 --> 01:37:42,800
passages and then that was tested in
 

5637
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:43,669
passages and then that was tested in
people

5638
01:37:43,669 --> 01:37:43,679
people
 

5639
01:37:43,679 --> 01:37:45,430
people
and it became the yellow fever vaccine

5640
01:37:45,430 --> 01:37:45,440
and it became the yellow fever vaccine
 

5641
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:46,709
and it became the yellow fever vaccine
that we use today

5642
01:37:46,709 --> 01:37:46,719
that we use today
 

5643
01:37:46,719 --> 01:37:49,510
that we use today
he selected for mutations that

5644
01:37:49,510 --> 01:37:49,520
he selected for mutations that
 

5645
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:52,229
he selected for mutations that
made the virus not cause disease but

5646
01:37:52,229 --> 01:37:52,239
made the virus not cause disease but
 

5647
01:37:52,239 --> 01:37:53,350
made the virus not cause disease but
still

5648
01:37:53,350 --> 01:37:53,360
still
 

5649
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:55,750
still
make an immune response wow so those are

5650
01:37:55,750 --> 01:37:55,760
make an immune response wow so those are
 

5651
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:58,070
make an immune response wow so those are
called replication competent we now have

5652
01:37:58,070 --> 01:37:58,080
called replication competent we now have
 

5653
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:00,550
called replication competent we now have
the polio vaccine which was developed in

5654
01:38:00,550 --> 01:38:00,560
the polio vaccine which was developed in
 

5655
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:03,350
the polio vaccine which was developed in
the 50s after the yellow fever then we

5656
01:38:03,350 --> 01:38:03,360
the 50s after the yellow fever then we
 

5657
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:06,550
the 50s after the yellow fever then we
had measles mumps rubella those are all

5658
01:38:06,550 --> 01:38:06,560
had measles mumps rubella those are all
 

5659
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:09,030
had measles mumps rubella those are all
replication competent vaccines

5660
01:38:09,030 --> 01:38:09,040
replication competent vaccines
 

5661
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:11,109
replication competent vaccines
and you mentioned is that's that's a

5662
01:38:11,109 --> 01:38:11,119
and you mentioned is that's that's a
 

5663
01:38:11,119 --> 01:38:12,390
and you mentioned is that's that's a
good idea

5664
01:38:12,390 --> 01:38:12,400
good idea
 

5665
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:13,910
good idea
they are all

5666
01:38:13,910 --> 01:38:13,920
they are all
 

5667
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:16,950
they are all
safe vaccines the only one

5668
01:38:16,950 --> 01:38:16,960
safe vaccines the only one
 

5669
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:19,669
safe vaccines the only one
that has had an issue is the polio

5670
01:38:19,669 --> 01:38:19,679
that has had an issue is the polio
 

5671
01:38:19,679 --> 01:38:21,430
that has had an issue is the polio
replication competent vaccine it was

5672
01:38:21,430 --> 01:38:21,440
replication competent vaccine it was
 

5673
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:23,590
replication competent vaccine it was
called sabin vaccine or

5674
01:38:23,590 --> 01:38:23,600
called sabin vaccine or
 

5675
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:25,910
called sabin vaccine or
oral polio virus vaccine

5676
01:38:25,910 --> 01:38:25,920
oral polio virus vaccine
 

5677
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:27,350
oral polio virus vaccine
because

5678
01:38:27,350 --> 01:38:27,360
because
 

5679
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:29,669
because
you take it orally it's a wonderful

5680
01:38:29,669 --> 01:38:29,679
you take it orally it's a wonderful
 

5681
01:38:29,679 --> 01:38:31,510
you take it orally it's a wonderful
because you don't have to inject it this

5682
01:38:31,510 --> 01:38:31,520
because you don't have to inject it this
 

5683
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:33,910
because you don't have to inject it this
is the perfect delivery

5684
01:38:33,910 --> 01:38:33,920
is the perfect delivery
 

5685
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:35,750
is the perfect delivery
you know either intranasal for a

5686
01:38:35,750 --> 01:38:35,760
you know either intranasal for a
 

5687
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:37,910
you know either intranasal for a
respiratory virus or orally for polio

5688
01:38:37,910 --> 01:38:37,920
respiratory virus or orally for polio
 

5689
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:40,709
respiratory virus or orally for polio
goes into your intestines it reproduces

5690
01:38:40,709 --> 01:38:40,719
goes into your intestines it reproduces
 

5691
01:38:40,719 --> 01:38:42,790
goes into your intestines it reproduces
and it gives you wonderful protection

5692
01:38:42,790 --> 01:38:42,800
and it gives you wonderful protection
 

5693
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:45,189
and it gives you wonderful protection
against polio

5694
01:38:45,189 --> 01:38:45,199
against polio
 

5695
01:38:45,199 --> 01:38:46,550
against polio
however you do

5696
01:38:46,550 --> 01:38:46,560
however you do
 

5697
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:48,950
however you do
shed virus out

5698
01:38:48,950 --> 01:38:48,960
shed virus out
 

5699
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:50,470
shed virus out
and

5700
01:38:50,470 --> 01:38:50,480
and
 

5701
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:52,870
and
that virus is no longer a vaccine it's

5702
01:38:52,870 --> 01:38:52,880
that virus is no longer a vaccine it's
 

5703
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:55,510
that virus is no longer a vaccine it's
reverted genetically in your intestine

5704
01:38:55,510 --> 01:38:55,520
reverted genetically in your intestine
 

5705
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:57,669
reverted genetically in your intestine
so you can infect others with poor take

5706
01:38:57,669 --> 01:38:57,679
so you can infect others with poor take
 

5707
01:38:57,679 --> 01:38:59,750
so you can infect others with poor take
that virus and put it into an animal and

5708
01:38:59,750 --> 01:38:59,760
that virus and put it into an animal and
 

5709
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:01,910
that virus and put it into an animal and
give it polio and in fact

5710
01:39:01,910 --> 01:39:01,920
give it polio and in fact
 

5711
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:04,229
give it polio and in fact
the parents of some kids

5712
01:39:04,229 --> 01:39:04,239
the parents of some kids
 

5713

in the 60s and 70s who were immunized
 

5715
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:08,550
in the 60s and 70s who were immunized
got got polio from the vaccine the rate

got got polio from the vaccine the rate
 

5717
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:12,310
got got polio from the vaccine the rate
was about one and one and a half million

5718
01:39:12,310 --> 01:39:12,320
was about one and one and a half million
 

5719
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:13,990
was about one and one and a half million
cases of polio so it's called

01:39:13,990 --> 01:39:14,000
cases of polio so it's called
 

5721
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,669
cases of polio so it's called
vaccine-associated polio and i always

vaccine-associated polio and i always
 

5723
01:39:15,679 --> 01:39:17,990
vaccine-associated polio and i always
argue that

argue that
 

5725
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:21,030
argue that
we may not have picked the right vaccine

5726
01:39:21,030 --> 01:39:21,040
we may not have picked the right vaccine
 

5727
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:22,629
we may not have picked the right vaccine
there was a big

5728
01:39:22,629 --> 01:39:22,639
there was a big
 

5729
01:39:22,639 --> 01:39:24,070
there was a big
fight in the

5730
01:39:24,070 --> 01:39:24,080
fight in the
 

5731
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:26,310
fight in the
u.s and other countries between the

u.s and other countries between the
 

5733
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:28,070
u.s and other countries between the
inactivated polio and the and the

5734
01:39:28,070 --> 01:39:28,080
inactivated polio and the and the
 

5735
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:30,390
inactivated polio and the and the
infectious polio vaccines which ones we

5736
01:39:30,390 --> 01:39:30,400
infectious polio vaccines which ones we
 

5737
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:32,629
infectious polio vaccines which ones we
should be using because we found out

5738
01:39:32,629 --> 01:39:32,639
should be using because we found out
 

5739
01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:34,149
should be using because we found out
that the infectious vaccine actually

5740
01:39:34,149 --> 01:39:34,159
that the infectious vaccine actually
 

5741
01:39:34,159 --> 01:39:36,870
that the infectious vaccine actually
caused polio and 8 to 10 kids a year in

5742
01:39:36,870 --> 01:39:36,880
caused polio and 8 to 10 kids a year in
 

5743
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:39,669
caused polio and 8 to 10 kids a year in
the u.s alone got polio from the vaccine

5744
01:39:39,669 --> 01:39:39,679
the u.s alone got polio from the vaccine
 

5745
01:39:39,679 --> 01:39:42,070
the u.s alone got polio from the vaccine
which looking back is really

5746
01:39:42,070 --> 01:39:42,080
which looking back is really
 

5747
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:43,990
which looking back is really
not acceptable in my view although the

5748
01:39:43,990 --> 01:39:44,000
not acceptable in my view although the
 

5749
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,070
not acceptable in my view although the
public health community said it was to

5750
01:39:46,070 --> 01:39:46,080
public health community said it was to
 

5751
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:48,790
public health community said it was to
get rid of polio so now we are

5752
01:39:48,790 --> 01:39:48,800
get rid of polio so now we are
 

5753
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:50,629
get rid of polio so now we are
we're close to eradicating polio

5754
01:39:50,629 --> 01:39:50,639
we're close to eradicating polio
 

5755
01:39:50,639 --> 01:39:52,950
we're close to eradicating polio
globally

5756
01:39:52,950 --> 01:39:52,960
globally
 

5757
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:55,590
globally
but this vaccine derived polio is a

5758
01:39:55,590 --> 01:39:55,600
but this vaccine derived polio is a
 

5759
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:57,990
but this vaccine derived polio is a
problem so now we have to go back to the

5760
01:39:57,990 --> 01:39:58,000
problem so now we have to go back to the
 

5761
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,669
problem so now we have to go back to the
an activated vaccine which is tough

5762
01:39:59,669 --> 01:39:59,679
an activated vaccine which is tough
 

5763
01:39:59,679 --> 01:40:01,270
an activated vaccine which is tough
because it's injected

5764
01:40:01,270 --> 01:40:01,280
because it's injected
 

5765
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:04,550
because it's injected
so okay so the the basic high level

5766
01:40:04,550 --> 01:40:04,560
so okay so the the basic high level
 

5767
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:07,109
so okay so the the basic high level
you know how vaccines work

5768
01:40:07,109 --> 01:40:07,119
you know how vaccines work
 

5769
01:40:07,119 --> 01:40:09,270
you know how vaccines work
principle is uh

5770
01:40:09,270 --> 01:40:09,280
principle is uh
 

5771
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:11,109
principle is uh
you want to deploy something in the body

5772
01:40:11,109 --> 01:40:11,119
you want to deploy something in the body
 

5773
01:40:11,119 --> 01:40:13,270
you want to deploy something in the body
that's as close to the actual virus as

5774
01:40:13,270 --> 01:40:13,280
that's as close to the actual virus as
 

5775
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:15,109
that's as close to the actual virus as
possible but doesn't do nearly as much

5776
01:40:15,109 --> 01:40:15,119
possible but doesn't do nearly as much
 

5777
01:40:15,119 --> 01:40:16,310
possible but doesn't do nearly as much
harm that's right and there's like a

5778
01:40:16,310 --> 01:40:16,320
harm that's right and there's like a
 

5779
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:17,830
harm that's right and there's like a
million that's right not a million but

5780
01:40:17,830 --> 01:40:17,840
million that's right not a million but
 

5781
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:18,870
million that's right not a million but
there's a bunch of ways you could

5782
01:40:18,870 --> 01:40:18,880
there's a bunch of ways you could
 

5783
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:20,550
there's a bunch of ways you could
possibly do so those are two ways and

5784
01:40:20,550 --> 01:40:20,560
possibly do so those are two ways and
 

5785
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:22,229
possibly do so those are two ways and
now of course we have modern ways we can

5786
01:40:22,229 --> 01:40:22,239
now of course we have modern ways we can
 

5787
01:40:22,239 --> 01:40:23,350
now of course we have modern ways we can
make

5788
01:40:23,350 --> 01:40:23,360
make
 

5789
01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:25,990
make
mrna vaccines right what's what are the

5790
01:40:25,990 --> 01:40:26,000
mrna vaccines right what's what are the
 

5791
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,990
mrna vaccines right what's what are the
modern ways i did you want to look uh

5792
01:40:27,990 --> 01:40:28,000
modern ways i did you want to look uh
 

5793
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,149
modern ways i did you want to look uh
mrna vaccine that's so that's one of the

5794
01:40:30,149 --> 01:40:30,159
mrna vaccine that's so that's one of the
 

5795
01:40:30,159 --> 01:40:31,669
mrna vaccine that's so that's one of the
that's the most modern but even before

5796
01:40:31,669 --> 01:40:31,679
that's the most modern but even before
 

5797
01:40:31,679 --> 01:40:34,070
that's the most modern but even before
mrna vaccines we learned that we could

5798
01:40:34,070 --> 01:40:34,080
mrna vaccines we learned that we could
 

5799
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:34,830
mrna vaccines we learned that we could
use

5800
01:40:34,830 --> 01:40:34,840
use
 

5801
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:37,830
use
viruses to deliver

5802
01:40:37,830 --> 01:40:37,840
viruses to deliver
 

5803
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:40,070
viruses to deliver
proteins from a virus that you want to

5804
01:40:40,070 --> 01:40:40,080
proteins from a virus that you want to
 

5805
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:41,510
proteins from a virus that you want to
prevent

5806
01:40:41,510 --> 01:40:41,520
prevent
 

5807
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:43,910
prevent
and so the ebola vaccine

5808
01:40:43,910 --> 01:40:43,920
and so the ebola vaccine
 

5809
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:46,470
and so the ebola vaccine
we took the spike gene of ebola virus

5810
01:40:46,470 --> 01:40:46,480
we took the spike gene of ebola virus
 

5811
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:48,229
we took the spike gene of ebola virus
and put it in a different virus and we

5812
01:40:48,229 --> 01:40:48,239
and put it in a different virus and we
 

5813
01:40:48,239 --> 01:40:50,149
and put it in a different virus and we
deliver that to people and that's called

5814
01:40:50,149 --> 01:40:50,159
deliver that to people and that's called
 

5815
01:40:50,159 --> 01:40:53,189
deliver that to people and that's called
a vectored vaccine and some of the covid

5816
01:40:53,189 --> 01:40:53,199
a vectored vaccine and some of the covid
 

5817
01:40:53,199 --> 01:40:55,270
a vectored vaccine and some of the covid
vaccines are vectors of different kinds

5818
01:40:55,270 --> 01:40:55,280
vaccines are vectors of different kinds
 

5819
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:57,669
vaccines are vectors of different kinds
of most famous or adenovirus vectors

5820
01:40:57,669 --> 01:40:57,679
of most famous or adenovirus vectors
 

5821
01:40:57,679 --> 01:40:59,669
of most famous or adenovirus vectors
carrying the spike gene

5822
01:40:59,669 --> 01:40:59,679
carrying the spike gene
 

5823
01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:01,590
carrying the spike gene
into the cell can you explain how the

5824
01:41:01,590 --> 01:41:01,600
into the cell can you explain how the
 

5825
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:04,229
into the cell can you explain how the
vector vaccine works again so we have we

5826
01:41:04,229 --> 01:41:04,239
vector vaccine works again so we have we
 

5827
01:41:04,239 --> 01:41:05,830
vector vaccine works again so we have we
take a

5828
01:41:05,830 --> 01:41:05,840
take a
 

5829
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:09,030
take a
a virus that will infect humans

5830
01:41:09,030 --> 01:41:09,040
a virus that will infect humans
 

5831
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:11,350
a virus that will infect humans
but will not make you sick

5832
01:41:11,350 --> 01:41:11,360
but will not make you sick
 

5833
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:14,070
but will not make you sick
in the case of adenovirus the years and

5834
01:41:14,070 --> 01:41:14,080
in the case of adenovirus the years and
 

5835
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:16,470
in the case of adenovirus the years and
years of people studying it has told us

5836
01:41:16,470 --> 01:41:16,480
years of people studying it has told us
 

5837
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:18,629
years of people studying it has told us
what genes you could cut out

5838
01:41:18,629 --> 01:41:18,639
what genes you could cut out
 

5839
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:20,870
what genes you could cut out
and allow the virus to infect the cell

5840
01:41:20,870 --> 01:41:20,880
and allow the virus to infect the cell
 

5841
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:22,550
and allow the virus to infect the cell
but not cause any disease so instead of

5842
01:41:22,550 --> 01:41:22,560
but not cause any disease so instead of
 

5843
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:24,470
but not cause any disease so instead of
doing selection on it

5844
01:41:24,470 --> 01:41:24,480
doing selection on it
 

5845
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:26,790
doing selection on it
you uh you you actually genetically

5846
01:41:26,790 --> 01:41:26,800
you uh you you actually genetically
 

5847
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:29,030
you uh you you actually genetically
modify it yes you modify the vector yeah

5848
01:41:29,030 --> 01:41:29,040
modify it yes you modify the vector yeah
 

5849
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:30,790
modify it yes you modify the vector yeah
so you'll be much more precise about it

5850
01:41:30,790 --> 01:41:30,800
so you'll be much more precise about it
 

5851
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:32,790
so you'll be much more precise about it
very precise and then you splice in the

5852
01:41:32,790 --> 01:41:32,800
very precise and then you splice in the
 

5853
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:34,709
very precise and then you splice in the
gene for the spike

5854
01:41:34,709 --> 01:41:34,719
gene for the spike
 

5855
01:41:34,719 --> 01:41:37,189
gene for the spike
and then you use that to deliver the

5856
01:41:37,189 --> 01:41:37,199
and then you use that to deliver the
 

5857
01:41:37,199 --> 01:41:39,510
and then you use that to deliver the
gene and it becomes produced as protein

5858
01:41:39,510 --> 01:41:39,520
gene and it becomes produced as protein
 

5859
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:40,950
gene and it becomes produced as protein
then you make an immune response and

5860
01:41:40,950 --> 01:41:40,960
then you make an immune response and
 

5861
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:43,109
then you make an immune response and
vector is the term for this modifying

5862
01:41:43,109 --> 01:41:43,119
vector is the term for this modifying
 

5863
01:41:43,119 --> 01:41:43,990
vector is the term for this modifying
right

5864
01:41:43,990 --> 01:41:44,000
right
 

5865
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,390
right
so we're now using viruses

5866
01:41:46,390 --> 01:41:46,400
so we're now using viruses
 

5867
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:47,350
so we're now using viruses
at our

5868
01:41:47,350 --> 01:41:47,360
at our
 

5869
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:49,270
at our
bidding we're using them as vectors not

5870
01:41:49,270 --> 01:41:49,280
bidding we're using them as vectors not
 

5871
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:51,750
bidding we're using them as vectors not
just for vaccines we can cure monogenic

5872
01:41:51,750 --> 01:41:51,760
just for vaccines we can cure monogenic
 

5873
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:53,590
just for vaccines we can cure monogenic
diseases that is if you have if you're

5874
01:41:53,590 --> 01:41:53,600
diseases that is if you have if you're
 

5875
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:55,990
diseases that is if you have if you're
born with a genetic disease you have a

5876
01:41:55,990 --> 01:41:56,000
born with a genetic disease you have a
 

5877
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,750
born with a genetic disease you have a
deletion or a mutation in a gene a

5878
01:41:57,750 --> 01:41:57,760
deletion or a mutation in a gene a
 

5879
01:41:57,760 --> 01:41:59,270
deletion or a mutation in a gene a
single gene

5880
01:41:59,270 --> 01:41:59,280
single gene
 

5881
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:00,790
single gene
we can give you the

5882
01:42:00,790 --> 01:42:00,800
we can give you the
 

5883
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:02,629
we can give you the
the regular gene back using a virus

5884
01:42:02,629 --> 01:42:02,639
the regular gene back using a virus
 

5885
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:03,669
the regular gene back using a virus
vector

5886
01:42:03,669 --> 01:42:03,679
vector
 

5887
01:42:03,679 --> 01:42:05,830
vector
so but cancers too we can cure cancers

5888
01:42:05,830 --> 01:42:05,840
so but cancers too we can cure cancers
 

5889
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:07,430
so but cancers too we can cure cancers
with vectors

5890
01:42:07,430 --> 01:42:07,440
with vectors
 

5891
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:08,629
with vectors
wow

5892
01:42:08,629 --> 01:42:08,639
wow
 

5893
01:42:08,639 --> 01:42:09,830
wow
really

5894
01:42:09,830 --> 01:42:09,840
really
 

5895
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:12,229
really
interesting yeah i think in 10 to 15

5896
01:42:12,229 --> 01:42:12,239
interesting yeah i think in 10 to 15
 

5897
01:42:12,239 --> 01:42:13,830
interesting yeah i think in 10 to 15
years most cancers will be treatable

5898
01:42:13,830 --> 01:42:13,840
years most cancers will be treatable
 

5899
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:15,990
years most cancers will be treatable
with viruses yeah

5900
01:42:15,990 --> 01:42:16,000
with viruses yeah
 

5901
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,550
with viruses yeah
wow and not only can we put

5902
01:42:18,550 --> 01:42:18,560
wow and not only can we put
 

5903
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:21,030
wow and not only can we put
things in the vector to kill the tumor

5904
01:42:21,030 --> 01:42:21,040
things in the vector to kill the tumor
 

5905
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:22,070
things in the vector to kill the tumor
we can

5906
01:42:22,070 --> 01:42:22,080
we can
 

5907
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:23,270
we can
target

5908
01:42:23,270 --> 01:42:23,280
target
 

5909
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:25,590
target
the vector to the tumor specifically in

5910
01:42:25,590 --> 01:42:25,600
the vector to the tumor specifically in
 

5911
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:27,510
the vector to the tumor specifically in
a number of ways and that makes it less

5912
01:42:27,510 --> 01:42:27,520
a number of ways and that makes it less
 

5913
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:29,030
a number of ways and that makes it less
toxic right it doesn't affect all your

5914
01:42:29,030 --> 01:42:29,040
toxic right it doesn't affect all your
 

5915
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:31,030
toxic right it doesn't affect all your
other cells

5916
01:42:31,030 --> 01:42:31,040
other cells
 

5917
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:33,590
other cells
but it takes time to develop a vector

5918
01:42:33,590 --> 01:42:33,600
but it takes time to develop a vector
 

5919
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:35,189
but it takes time to develop a vector
for a particular thing because it

5920
01:42:35,189 --> 01:42:35,199
for a particular thing because it
 

5921
01:42:35,199 --> 01:42:37,510
for a particular thing because it
requires a deep understanding

5922
01:42:37,510 --> 01:42:37,520
requires a deep understanding
 

5923
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:39,750
requires a deep understanding
yeah in fact we have about a dozen

5924
01:42:39,750 --> 01:42:39,760
yeah in fact we have about a dozen
 

5925
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:41,109
yeah in fact we have about a dozen
different virus vectors that have been

5926
01:42:41,109 --> 01:42:41,119
different virus vectors that have been
 

5927
01:42:41,119 --> 01:42:42,790
different virus vectors that have been
studied for 20 years

5928
01:42:42,790 --> 01:42:42,800
studied for 20 years
 

5929
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:45,510
studied for 20 years
and those are the set of vaccine vectors

5930
01:42:45,510 --> 01:42:45,520
and those are the set of vaccine vectors
 

5931
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:46,790
and those are the set of vaccine vectors
that we're using so it includes

5932
01:42:46,790 --> 01:42:46,800
that we're using so it includes
 

5933
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:48,790
that we're using so it includes
adenovirus

5934
01:42:48,790 --> 01:42:48,800
adenovirus
 

5935
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:51,030
adenovirus
vesicular stomatitis virus which is a

5936
01:42:51,030 --> 01:42:51,040
vesicular stomatitis virus which is a
 

5937
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:53,669
vesicular stomatitis virus which is a
cousin of rabies but doesn't make people

5938
01:42:53,669 --> 01:42:53,679
cousin of rabies but doesn't make people
 

5939
01:42:53,679 --> 01:42:55,350
cousin of rabies but doesn't make people
sick

5940
01:42:55,350 --> 01:42:55,360
sick
 

5941
01:42:55,360 --> 01:42:58,470
sick
influenza viruses being used as a vector

5942
01:42:58,470 --> 01:42:58,480
influenza viruses being used as a vector
 

5943
01:42:58,480 --> 01:43:00,870
influenza viruses being used as a vector
and many even measles virus so

5944
01:43:00,870 --> 01:43:00,880
and many even measles virus so
 

5945
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:03,109
and many even measles virus so
we're familiar with how to modify those

5946
01:43:03,109 --> 01:43:03,119
we're familiar with how to modify those
 

5947
01:43:03,119 --> 01:43:05,350
we're familiar with how to modify those
to be vectors and those are being used

5948
01:43:05,350 --> 01:43:05,360
to be vectors and those are being used
 

5949
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:07,750
to be vectors and those are being used
for for covid vaccines and then of

5950
01:43:07,750 --> 01:43:07,760
for for covid vaccines and then of
 

5951
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:09,350
for for covid vaccines and then of
course we have the the

5952
01:43:09,350 --> 01:43:09,360
course we have the the
 

5953
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:11,669
course we have the the
new the new is just the nucleic acid

5954
01:43:11,669 --> 01:43:11,679
new the new is just the nucleic acid
 

5955
01:43:11,679 --> 01:43:13,510
new the new is just the nucleic acid
vaccines so

5956
01:43:13,510 --> 01:43:13,520
vaccines so
 

5957
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:14,629
vaccines so
years ago

5958
01:43:14,629 --> 01:43:14,639
years ago
 

5959
01:43:14,639 --> 01:43:16,870
years ago
people said why can't we just inject dna

5960
01:43:16,870 --> 01:43:16,880
people said why can't we just inject dna
 

5961
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:18,950
people said why can't we just inject dna
into people

5962
01:43:18,950 --> 01:43:18,960
into people
 

5963
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:20,790
into people
take the spike and put it in a dna and

5964
01:43:20,790 --> 01:43:20,800
take the spike and put it in a dna and
 

5965
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:22,229
take the spike and put it in a dna and
inject it

5966
01:43:22,229 --> 01:43:22,239
inject it
 

5967
01:43:22,239 --> 01:43:24,709
inject it
so people tried many many different

5968
01:43:24,709 --> 01:43:24,719
so people tried many many different
 

5969
01:43:24,719 --> 01:43:26,470
so people tried many many different
vaccines and in fact there's there are

5970
01:43:26,470 --> 01:43:26,480
vaccines and in fact there's there are
 

5971
01:43:26,480 --> 01:43:28,950
vaccines and in fact there's there are
no human licensed vaccines that are dna

5972
01:43:28,950 --> 01:43:28,960
no human licensed vaccines that are dna
 

5973
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:30,870
no human licensed vaccines that are dna
vaccines although there is a

5974
01:43:30,870 --> 01:43:30,880
vaccines although there is a
 

5975
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:32,950
vaccines although there is a
there is a west nile vaccine for horses

5976
01:43:32,950 --> 01:43:32,960
there is a west nile vaccine for horses
 

5977
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:34,629
there is a west nile vaccine for horses
that's a dna-based

5978
01:43:34,629 --> 01:43:34,639
that's a dna-based
 

5979
01:43:34,639 --> 01:43:35,750
that's a dna-based
vaccine

5980
01:43:35,750 --> 01:43:35,760
vaccine
 

5981
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:37,510
vaccine
so if you have a horse you can give it

5982
01:43:37,510 --> 01:43:37,520
so if you have a horse you can give it
 

5983
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:38,950
so if you have a horse you can give it
this vaccine but no human can you

5984
01:43:38,950 --> 01:43:38,960
this vaccine but no human can you
 

5985
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:40,149
this vaccine but no human can you
clarify

5986
01:43:40,149 --> 01:43:40,159
clarify
 

5987
01:43:40,159 --> 01:43:43,910
clarify
uh does a dna vaccine only work for dna

5988
01:43:43,910 --> 01:43:43,920
uh does a dna vaccine only work for dna
 

5989
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:46,709
uh does a dna vaccine only work for dna
viruses no it can work for dna or rna

5990
01:43:46,709 --> 01:43:46,719
viruses no it can work for dna or rna
 

5991
01:43:46,719 --> 01:43:48,550
viruses no it can work for dna or rna
because remember for an rna virus we can

5992
01:43:48,550 --> 01:43:48,560
because remember for an rna virus we can
 

5993
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:51,030
because remember for an rna virus we can
make a dna copy of it right and it will

5994
01:43:51,030 --> 01:43:51,040
make a dna copy of it right and it will
 

5995
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:53,669
make a dna copy of it right and it will
still when you put that dna in a cell

5996
01:43:53,669 --> 01:43:53,679
still when you put that dna in a cell
 

5997
01:43:53,679 --> 01:43:56,629
still when you put that dna in a cell
it goes into the nucleus okay right

5998
01:43:56,629 --> 01:43:56,639
it goes into the nucleus okay right
 

5999
01:43:56,639 --> 01:43:58,470
it goes into the nucleus okay right
so it's you just essentially you get you

6000
01:43:58,470 --> 01:43:58,480
so it's you just essentially you get you
 

6001
01:43:58,480 --> 01:43:59,669
so it's you just essentially you get you
get proteins

6002
01:43:59,669 --> 01:43:59,679
get proteins
 

6003
01:43:59,679 --> 01:44:01,750
get proteins
vaccines yeah you're giving okay i got

6004
01:44:01,750 --> 01:44:01,760
vaccines yeah you're giving okay i got
 

6005
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:03,669
vaccines yeah you're giving okay i got
it so those didn't work for human

6006
01:44:03,669 --> 01:44:03,679
it so those didn't work for human
 

6007
01:44:03,679 --> 01:44:06,310
it so those didn't work for human
vaccines and there were many hiv aids

6008
01:44:06,310 --> 01:44:06,320
vaccines and there were many hiv aids
 

6009
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:09,430
vaccines and there were many hiv aids
vaccine trials that used dna vaccines

6010
01:44:09,430 --> 01:44:09,440
vaccine trials that used dna vaccines
 

6011
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:10,709
vaccine trials that used dna vaccines
didn't work

6012
01:44:10,709 --> 01:44:10,719
didn't work
 

6013
01:44:10,719 --> 01:44:11,830
didn't work
and then

6014
01:44:11,830 --> 01:44:11,840
and then
 

6015
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:14,229
and then
a number of years ago people started

6016
01:44:14,229 --> 01:44:14,239
a number of years ago people started
 

6017
01:44:14,239 --> 01:44:16,390
a number of years ago people started
thinking how about rna

6018
01:44:16,390 --> 01:44:16,400
thinking how about rna
 

6019
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:19,189
thinking how about rna
rna vaccines and i first heard this i

6020
01:44:19,189 --> 01:44:19,199
rna vaccines and i first heard this i
 

6021
01:44:19,199 --> 01:44:21,430
rna vaccines and i first heard this i
thought what i've worked with rna my

6022
01:44:21,430 --> 01:44:21,440
thought what i've worked with rna my
 

6023
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:24,229
thought what i've worked with rna my
whole career it's so fragile

6024
01:44:24,229 --> 01:44:24,239
whole career it's so fragile
 

6025
01:44:24,239 --> 01:44:25,910
whole career it's so fragile
if you look at it the wrong way it

6026
01:44:25,910 --> 01:44:25,920
if you look at it the wrong way it
 

6027
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:27,510
if you look at it the wrong way it
breaks

6028
01:44:27,510 --> 01:44:27,520
breaks
 

6029
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:29,510
breaks
i mean that's that's being facetious

6030
01:44:29,510 --> 01:44:29,520
i mean that's that's being facetious
 

6031
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:30,470
i mean that's that's being facetious
right but

6032
01:44:30,470 --> 01:44:30,480
right but
 

6033
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:32,470
right but
you have to be very careful because

6034
01:44:32,470 --> 01:44:32,480
you have to be very careful because
 

6035
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:34,709
you have to be very careful because
your hands are full of enzymes that will

6036
01:44:34,709 --> 01:44:34,719
your hands are full of enzymes that will
 

6037
01:44:34,719 --> 01:44:37,189
your hands are full of enzymes that will
degrade rna

6038
01:44:37,189 --> 01:44:37,199
degrade rna
 

6039
01:44:37,199 --> 01:44:38,550
degrade rna
so i thought how could this possibly

6040
01:44:38,550 --> 01:44:38,560
so i thought how could this possibly
 

6041
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:40,390
so i thought how could this possibly
work injecting it into someone's it's an

6042
01:44:40,390 --> 01:44:40,400
work injecting it into someone's it's an
 

6043
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:42,550
work injecting it into someone's it's an
example of i was skeptical and i was

6044
01:44:42,550 --> 01:44:42,560
example of i was skeptical and i was
 

6045
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:43,910
example of i was skeptical and i was
wrong

6046
01:44:43,910 --> 01:44:43,920
wrong
 

6047
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:46,550
wrong
it turns out that if you modify the rna

6048
01:44:46,550 --> 01:44:46,560
it turns out that if you modify the rna
 

6049
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:48,870
it turns out that if you modify the rna
properly and protect it in a lipid

6050
01:44:48,870 --> 01:44:48,880
properly and protect it in a lipid
 

6051
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:50,950
properly and protect it in a lipid
capsule

6052
01:44:50,950 --> 01:44:50,960
capsule
 

6053
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:53,189
capsule
it actually works as a vaccine and

6054
01:44:53,189 --> 01:44:53,199
it actually works as a vaccine and
 

6055
01:44:53,199 --> 01:44:56,149
it actually works as a vaccine and
people were working on this years before

6056
01:44:56,149 --> 01:44:56,159
people were working on this years before
 

6057
01:44:56,159 --> 01:44:57,590
people were working on this years before
covid came around they're doing

6058
01:44:57,590 --> 01:44:57,600
covid came around they're doing
 

6059
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:00,470
covid came around they're doing
experimental mrna vaccines and there are

6060
01:45:00,470 --> 01:45:00,480
experimental mrna vaccines and there are
 

6061
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:02,070
experimental mrna vaccines and there are
a couple of companies that were working

6062
01:45:02,070 --> 01:45:02,080
a couple of companies that were working
 

6063
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:03,430
a couple of companies that were working
on it and

6064
01:45:03,430 --> 01:45:03,440
on it and
 

6065
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:05,270
on it and
so at the beginning of

6066
01:45:05,270 --> 01:45:05,280
so at the beginning of
 

6067
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:08,229
so at the beginning of
2020 they said let's try it and

6068
01:45:08,229 --> 01:45:08,239
2020 they said let's try it and
 

6069
01:45:08,239 --> 01:45:10,310
2020 they said let's try it and
i was skeptical frankly because i just

6070
01:45:10,310 --> 01:45:10,320
i was skeptical frankly because i just
 

6071
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:12,390
i was skeptical frankly because i just
thought rna would be too labile but i

6072
01:45:12,390 --> 01:45:12,400
thought rna would be too labile but i
 

6073
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:13,510
thought rna would be too labile but i
was wrong

6074
01:45:13,510 --> 01:45:13,520
was wrong
 

6075
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:16,149
was wrong
so this is uh as we're saying offline

6076
01:45:16,149 --> 01:45:16,159
so this is uh as we're saying offline
 

6077
01:45:16,159 --> 01:45:18,229
so this is uh as we're saying offline
one of the great things about you is

6078
01:45:18,229 --> 01:45:18,239
one of the great things about you is
 

6079
01:45:18,239 --> 01:45:20,149
one of the great things about you is
you're able to say when you're

6080
01:45:20,149 --> 01:45:20,159
you're able to say when you're
 

6081
01:45:20,159 --> 01:45:21,910
you're able to say when you're
wrong about intuitions you've had in the

6082
01:45:21,910 --> 01:45:21,920
wrong about intuitions you've had in the
 

6083
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:23,430
wrong about intuitions you've had in the
past which is a beautiful thing for

6084
01:45:23,430 --> 01:45:23,440
past which is a beautiful thing for
 

6085
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:24,790
past which is a beautiful thing for
scientists

6086
01:45:24,790 --> 01:45:24,800
scientists
 

6087
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:27,109
scientists
uh but you know i still think it's very

6088
01:45:27,109 --> 01:45:27,119
uh but you know i still think it's very
 

6089
01:45:27,119 --> 01:45:29,030
uh but you know i still think it's very
surprising that something like that

6090
01:45:29,030 --> 01:45:29,040
surprising that something like that
 

6091
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:31,430
surprising that something like that
works right yeah i am surprised so

6092
01:45:31,430 --> 01:45:31,440
works right yeah i am surprised so
 

6093
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:33,189
works right yeah i am surprised so
you're just

6094
01:45:33,189 --> 01:45:33,199
you're just
 

6095
01:45:33,199 --> 01:45:34,550
you're just
you're just launching rna in a

6096
01:45:34,550 --> 01:45:34,560
you're just launching rna in a
 

6097
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:37,430
you're just launching rna in a
protective membrane yeah and then

6098
01:45:37,430 --> 01:45:37,440
protective membrane yeah and then
 

6099
01:45:37,440 --> 01:45:38,790
protective membrane yeah and then
now

6100
01:45:38,790 --> 01:45:38,800
now
 

6101
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:40,470
now
one thing is surprising that the rna

6102
01:45:40,470 --> 01:45:40,480
one thing is surprising that the rna
 

6103
01:45:40,480 --> 01:45:43,430
one thing is surprising that the rna
sort of lasts long enough

6104
01:45:43,430 --> 01:45:43,440
sort of lasts long enough
 

6105
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:45,750
sort of lasts long enough
right for the uh in its structure but

6106
01:45:45,750 --> 01:45:45,760
right for the uh in its structure but
 

6107
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:46,629
right for the uh in its structure but
then

6108
01:45:46,629 --> 01:45:46,639
then
 

6109
01:45:46,639 --> 01:45:48,870
then
um the the other

6110
01:45:48,870 --> 01:45:48,880
um the the other
 

6111
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:51,270
um the the other
thing is why does it work that that

6112
01:45:51,270 --> 01:45:51,280
thing is why does it work that that
 

6113
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:54,709
thing is why does it work that that
that's a good training ground for um

6114
01:45:54,709 --> 01:45:54,719
that's a good training ground for um
 

6115
01:45:54,719 --> 01:45:56,950
that's a good training ground for um
for the immune system

6116
01:45:56,950 --> 01:45:56,960
for the immune system
 

6117
01:45:56,960 --> 01:45:58,790
for the immune system
is that is that obvious

6118
01:45:58,790 --> 01:45:58,800
is that is that obvious
 

6119
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:00,470
is that is that obvious
i don't think i don't think it's obvious

6120
01:46:00,470 --> 01:46:00,480
i don't think i don't think it's obvious
 

6121
01:46:00,480 --> 01:46:02,870
i don't think i don't think it's obvious
to most people and it's worth going into

6122
01:46:02,870 --> 01:46:02,880
to most people and it's worth going into
 

6123
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:04,709
to most people and it's worth going into
because it's really interesting i mean

6124
01:46:04,709 --> 01:46:04,719
because it's really interesting i mean
 

6125
01:46:04,719 --> 01:46:05,910
because it's really interesting i mean
first of all they

6126
01:46:05,910 --> 01:46:05,920
first of all they
 

6127
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:08,229
first of all they
they wrap the rna in

6128
01:46:08,229 --> 01:46:08,239
they wrap the rna in
 

6129
01:46:08,239 --> 01:46:11,189
they wrap the rna in
in fats in lipid membranes right and the

6130
01:46:11,189 --> 01:46:11,199
in fats in lipid membranes right and the
 

6131
01:46:11,199 --> 01:46:13,750
in fats in lipid membranes right and the
particular formulation they test for

6132
01:46:13,750 --> 01:46:13,760
particular formulation they test for
 

6133
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:15,830
particular formulation they test for
years to make sure it's stable you know

6134
01:46:15,830 --> 01:46:15,840
years to make sure it's stable you know
 

6135
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:17,830
years to make sure it's stable you know
it lasts a long time after it's injected

6136
01:46:17,830 --> 01:46:17,840
it lasts a long time after it's injected
 

6137
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:20,070
it lasts a long time after it's injected
and the two companies that

6138
01:46:20,070 --> 01:46:20,080
and the two companies that
 

6139
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:22,229
and the two companies that
make the current covet vaccines right

6140
01:46:22,229 --> 01:46:22,239
make the current covet vaccines right
 

6141
01:46:22,239 --> 01:46:24,149
make the current covet vaccines right
moderna and physio they have different

6142
01:46:24,149 --> 01:46:24,159
moderna and physio they have different
 

6143
01:46:24,159 --> 01:46:26,709
moderna and physio they have different
lipid formulations to get to the same so

6144
01:46:26,709 --> 01:46:26,719
lipid formulations to get to the same so
 

6145
01:46:26,719 --> 01:46:29,750
lipid formulations to get to the same so
that's a real part of it and it's not

6146
01:46:29,750 --> 01:46:29,760
that's a real part of it and it's not
 

6147
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:31,350
that's a real part of it and it's not
simple there are quite a few different

6148
01:46:31,350 --> 01:46:31,360
simple there are quite a few different
 

6149
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:33,990
simple there are quite a few different
lipids that they put into this coding

6150
01:46:33,990 --> 01:46:34,000
lipids that they put into this coding
 

6151
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:35,830
lipids that they put into this coding
and they test to see how long

6152
01:46:35,830 --> 01:46:35,840
and they test to see how long
 

6153
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:37,830
and they test to see how long
they protect the rna after it's injected

6154
01:46:37,830 --> 01:46:37,840
they protect the rna after it's injected
 

6155
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:40,470
they protect the rna after it's injected
say into a mouse how long does it last

6156
01:46:40,470 --> 01:46:40,480
say into a mouse how long does it last
 

6157
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:42,790
say into a mouse how long does it last
and the way it works is

6158
01:46:42,790 --> 01:46:42,800
and the way it works is
 

6159
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:44,470
and the way it works is
these apparently

6160
01:46:44,470 --> 01:46:44,480
these apparently
 

6161
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:46,390
these apparently
these lipid nanoparticles they get

6162
01:46:46,390 --> 01:46:46,400
these lipid nanoparticles they get
 

6163
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:49,669
these lipid nanoparticles they get
injected into your muscle they bump into

6164
01:46:49,669 --> 01:46:49,679
injected into your muscle they bump into
 

6165
01:46:49,679 --> 01:46:53,590
injected into your muscle they bump into
cells and they get taken up so lipid

6166
01:46:53,590 --> 01:46:53,600
cells and they get taken up so lipid
 

6167
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:56,870
cells and they get taken up so lipid
fat is sticky

6168
01:46:56,870 --> 01:46:56,880
fat is sticky
 

6169
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:58,470
fat is sticky
it's greasy

6170
01:46:58,470 --> 01:46:58,480
it's greasy
 

6171
01:46:58,480 --> 01:46:59,830
it's greasy
we like to say

6172
01:46:59,830 --> 01:46:59,840
we like to say
 

6173
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:01,990
we like to say
and so your mem your cells are covered

6174
01:47:01,990 --> 01:47:02,000
and so your mem your cells are covered
 

6175
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:03,910
and so your mem your cells are covered
with the greasy membrane also so when

6176
01:47:03,910 --> 01:47:03,920
with the greasy membrane also so when
 

6177
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:04,709
with the greasy membrane also so when
these

6178
01:47:04,709 --> 01:47:04,719
these
 

6179
01:47:04,719 --> 01:47:06,629
these
lipid nanoparticles bump into them they

6180
01:47:06,629 --> 01:47:06,639
lipid nanoparticles bump into them they
 

6181
01:47:06,639 --> 01:47:08,310
lipid nanoparticles bump into them they
stick and they eventually get taken up

6182
01:47:08,310 --> 01:47:08,320
stick and they eventually get taken up
 

6183
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:09,189
stick and they eventually get taken up
and they

6184
01:47:09,189 --> 01:47:09,199
and they
 

6185
01:47:09,199 --> 01:47:10,790
and they
they figured this out right at the

6186
01:47:10,790 --> 01:47:10,800
they figured this out right at the
 

6187
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:12,709
they figured this out right at the
beginning if we put rna in a lipid

6188
01:47:12,709 --> 01:47:12,719
beginning if we put rna in a lipid
 

6189
01:47:12,719 --> 01:47:14,870
beginning if we put rna in a lipid
nanoparticle will it get taken up into a

6190
01:47:14,870 --> 01:47:14,880
nanoparticle will it get taken up into a
 

6191
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:17,030
nanoparticle will it get taken up into a
cell and the answer was yes it was just

6192
01:47:17,030 --> 01:47:17,040
cell and the answer was yes it was just
 

6193
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:19,590
cell and the answer was yes it was just
let's try it and it worked so basically

6194
01:47:19,590 --> 01:47:19,600
let's try it and it worked so basically
 

6195
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:21,430
let's try it and it worked so basically
experiment it's not like some deep

6196
01:47:21,430 --> 01:47:21,440
experiment it's not like some deep
 

6197
01:47:21,440 --> 01:47:22,709
experiment it's not like some deep
understanding of biology it's

6198
01:47:22,709 --> 01:47:22,719
understanding of biology it's
 

6199
01:47:22,719 --> 01:47:24,950
understanding of biology it's
experimentally speaking it just seems to

6200
01:47:24,950 --> 01:47:24,960
experimentally speaking it just seems to
 

6201
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:26,870
experimentally speaking it just seems to
work yeah well they had some idea that

6202
01:47:26,870 --> 01:47:26,880
work yeah well they had some idea that
 

6203
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:29,109
work yeah well they had some idea that
lipids would target this to a cell

6204
01:47:29,109 --> 01:47:29,119
lipids would target this to a cell
 

6205
01:47:29,119 --> 01:47:30,229
lipids would target this to a cell
membrane

6206
01:47:30,229 --> 01:47:30,239
membrane
 

6207
01:47:30,239 --> 01:47:32,149
membrane
and remember there's no

6208
01:47:32,149 --> 01:47:32,159
and remember there's no
 

6209
01:47:32,159 --> 01:47:34,229
and remember there's no
there's no receptor involved like the

6210
01:47:34,229 --> 01:47:34,239
there's no receptor involved like the
 

6211
01:47:34,239 --> 01:47:36,950
there's no receptor involved like the
virus has a specific protein that

6212
01:47:36,950 --> 01:47:36,960
virus has a specific protein that
 

6213
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:39,109
virus has a specific protein that
attaches to a receptor right

6214
01:47:39,109 --> 01:47:39,119
attaches to a receptor right
 

6215
01:47:39,119 --> 01:47:41,109
attaches to a receptor right
it's not efficient enough to just bump

6216
01:47:41,109 --> 01:47:41,119
it's not efficient enough to just bump
 

6217
01:47:41,119 --> 01:47:43,189
it's not efficient enough to just bump
around and get into a cell

6218
01:47:43,189 --> 01:47:43,199
around and get into a cell
 

6219
01:47:43,199 --> 01:47:44,950
around and get into a cell
that's what these things are doing and

6220
01:47:44,950 --> 01:47:44,960
that's what these things are doing and
 

6221
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:47,750
that's what these things are doing and
they probably optimize the lipids to to

6222
01:47:47,750 --> 01:47:47,760
they probably optimize the lipids to to
 

6223
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:49,669
they probably optimize the lipids to to
get more efficient uptake

6224
01:47:49,669 --> 01:47:49,679
get more efficient uptake
 

6225
01:47:49,679 --> 01:47:51,510
get more efficient uptake
but it's not as efficient as a virus

6226
01:47:51,510 --> 01:47:51,520
but it's not as efficient as a virus
 

6227
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:53,830
but it's not as efficient as a virus
would be to get into a cell you have no

6228
01:47:53,830 --> 01:47:53,840
would be to get into a cell you have no
 

6229
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:56,709
would be to get into a cell you have no
specific i mean which is why

6230
01:47:56,709 --> 01:47:56,719
specific i mean which is why
 

6231
01:47:56,719 --> 01:47:59,109
specific i mean which is why
it's surprising that uh you can crack

6232
01:47:59,109 --> 01:47:59,119
it's surprising that uh you can crack
 

6233
01:47:59,119 --> 01:48:01,189
it's surprising that uh you can crack
into the safe

6234
01:48:01,189 --> 01:48:01,199
into the safe
 

6235
01:48:01,199 --> 01:48:02,830
into the safe
with with a

6236
01:48:02,830 --> 01:48:02,840
with with a
 

6237
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:05,189
with with a
hammer or

6238
01:48:05,189 --> 01:48:05,199
hammer or
 

6239
01:48:05,199 --> 01:48:07,750
hammer or
with some fat i mean that's a

6240
01:48:07,750 --> 01:48:07,760
with some fat i mean that's a
 

6241
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:09,189
with some fat i mean that's a
that's kind of surprising it's kind of

6242
01:48:09,189 --> 01:48:09,199
that's kind of surprising it's kind of
 

6243
01:48:09,199 --> 01:48:10,310
that's kind of surprising it's kind of
amazing

6244
01:48:10,310 --> 01:48:10,320
amazing
 

6245
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:13,510
amazing
um that that it works but so

6246
01:48:13,510 --> 01:48:13,520
um that that it works but so
 

6247
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:16,629
um that that it works but so
maybe let's try to um

6248
01:48:16,629 --> 01:48:16,639
maybe let's try to um
 

6249
01:48:16,639 --> 01:48:18,709
maybe let's try to um
talk about this so one of the

6250
01:48:18,709 --> 01:48:18,719
talk about this so one of the
 

6251
01:48:18,719 --> 01:48:22,470
talk about this so one of the
hesitancies around vaccines

6252
01:48:22,470 --> 01:48:22,480
hesitancies around vaccines
 

6253
01:48:22,480 --> 01:48:24,629
hesitancies around vaccines
or basically around any new technology

6254
01:48:24,629 --> 01:48:24,639
or basically around any new technology
 

6255
01:48:24,639 --> 01:48:28,550
or basically around any new technology
is the fact that mrna is a new idea

6256
01:48:28,550 --> 01:48:28,560
is the fact that mrna is a new idea
 

6257
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:30,470
is the fact that mrna is a new idea
and it's an idea that was

6258
01:48:30,470 --> 01:48:30,480
and it's an idea that was
 

6259
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:33,030
and it's an idea that was
shrouded in some skepticism as you said

6260
01:48:33,030 --> 01:48:33,040
shrouded in some skepticism as you said
 

6261
01:48:33,040 --> 01:48:35,109
shrouded in some skepticism as you said
but it's the scientific community

6262
01:48:35,109 --> 01:48:35,119
but it's the scientific community
 

6263
01:48:35,119 --> 01:48:37,830
but it's the scientific community
because it's like it's a it's a

6264
01:48:37,830 --> 01:48:37,840
because it's like it's a it's a
 

6265
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:40,149
because it's like it's a it's a
cool new technology

6266
01:48:40,149 --> 01:48:40,159
cool new technology
 

6267
01:48:40,159 --> 01:48:42,470
cool new technology
surprising that it works

6268
01:48:42,470 --> 01:48:42,480
surprising that it works
 

6269
01:48:42,480 --> 01:48:44,310
surprising that it works
what's your intuition

6270
01:48:44,310 --> 01:48:44,320
what's your intuition
 

6271
01:48:44,320 --> 01:48:46,550
what's your intuition
i think one nice way to approach this is

6272
01:48:46,550 --> 01:48:46,560
i think one nice way to approach this is
 

6273
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:48,070
i think one nice way to approach this is
um

6274
01:48:48,070 --> 01:48:48,080
um
 

6275
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:51,990
um
try to play devil's advocate and say

6276
01:48:51,990 --> 01:48:52,000
try to play devil's advocate and say
 

6277
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,950
try to play devil's advocate and say
both sides one side is why your

6278
01:48:54,950 --> 01:48:54,960
both sides one side is why your
 

6279
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:59,030
both sides one side is why your
intuition says that it's safe for humans

6280
01:48:59,030 --> 01:48:59,040
intuition says that it's safe for humans
 

6281
01:48:59,040 --> 01:49:02,310
intuition says that it's safe for humans
and what arguments can you see

6282
01:49:02,310 --> 01:49:02,320
and what arguments can you see
 

6283
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:04,310
and what arguments can you see
if you could steal man and argument why

6284
01:49:04,310 --> 01:49:04,320
if you could steal man and argument why
 

6285
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:06,629
if you could steal man and argument why
it's unsafe for humans

6286
01:49:06,629 --> 01:49:06,639
it's unsafe for humans
 

6287
01:49:06,639 --> 01:49:07,990
it's unsafe for humans
or

6288
01:49:07,990 --> 01:49:08,000
or
 

6289
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,310
or
not unsafe for humans but

6290
01:49:10,310 --> 01:49:10,320
not unsafe for humans but
 

6291
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:13,830
not unsafe for humans but
the hesitancy to take an mrna vaccine is

6292
01:49:13,830 --> 01:49:13,840
the hesitancy to take an mrna vaccine is
 

6293
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:15,030
the hesitancy to take an mrna vaccine is
justified

6294
01:49:15,030 --> 01:49:15,040
justified
 

6295
01:49:15,040 --> 01:49:16,550
justified
so many people

6296
01:49:16,550 --> 01:49:16,560
so many people
 

6297
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:19,430
so many people
are afraid because it's new technology

6298
01:49:19,430 --> 01:49:19,440
are afraid because it's new technology
 

6299
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:20,950
are afraid because it's new technology
and they feel it hasn't been

6300
01:49:20,950 --> 01:49:20,960
and they feel it hasn't been
 

6301
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:22,070
and they feel it hasn't been
tested

6302
01:49:22,070 --> 01:49:22,080
tested
 

6303
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:25,030
tested
i mean in theory what could go wrong

6304
01:49:25,030 --> 01:49:25,040
i mean in theory what could go wrong
 

6305
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:27,270
i mean in theory what could go wrong
this is the nice thing about

6306
01:49:27,270 --> 01:49:27,280
this is the nice thing about
 

6307
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:28,950
this is the nice thing about
mrna

6308
01:49:28,950 --> 01:49:28,960
mrna
 

6309
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:32,229
mrna
is that it doesn't last forever

6310
01:49:32,229 --> 01:49:32,239
is that it doesn't last forever
 

6311
01:49:32,239 --> 01:49:34,550
is that it doesn't last forever
as opposed to dna which doesn't last

6312
01:49:34,550 --> 01:49:34,560
as opposed to dna which doesn't last
 

6313
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:38,070
as opposed to dna which doesn't last
forever but it can last a lot longer

6314
01:49:38,070 --> 01:49:38,080
forever but it can last a lot longer
 

6315
01:49:38,080 --> 01:49:41,510
forever but it can last a lot longer
and it could even go into your dna right

6316
01:49:41,510 --> 01:49:41,520
and it could even go into your dna right
 

6317
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:43,109
and it could even go into your dna right
so mrna has a

6318
01:49:43,109 --> 01:49:43,119
so mrna has a
 

6319
01:49:43,119 --> 01:49:46,149
so mrna has a
shorter lifetime maybe days after it's

6320
01:49:46,149 --> 01:49:46,159
shorter lifetime maybe days after it's
 

6321
01:49:46,159 --> 01:49:48,629
shorter lifetime maybe days after it's
injected into your arm then it's gone

6322
01:49:48,629 --> 01:49:48,639
injected into your arm then it's gone
 

6323
01:49:48,639 --> 01:49:50,310
injected into your arm then it's gone
so that's a good thing because it's not

6324
01:49:50,310 --> 01:49:50,320
so that's a good thing because it's not
 

6325
01:49:50,320 --> 01:49:52,870
so that's a good thing because it's not
going to be around forever

6326
01:49:52,870 --> 01:49:52,880
going to be around forever
 

6327
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:55,510
going to be around forever
so that would say okay so

6328
01:49:55,510 --> 01:49:55,520
so that would say okay so
 

6329
01:49:55,520 --> 01:49:57,270
so that would say okay so
it's sticking around for your lifetime

6330
01:49:57,270 --> 01:49:57,280
it's sticking around for your lifetime
 

6331
01:49:57,280 --> 01:49:59,109
it's sticking around for your lifetime
is not happening but what else could

6332
01:49:59,109 --> 01:49:59,119
is not happening but what else could
 

6333
01:49:59,119 --> 01:49:59,990
is not happening but what else could
happen

6334
01:49:59,990 --> 01:50:00,000
happen
 

6335
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:00,950
happen
well

6336
01:50:00,950 --> 01:50:00,960
well
 

6337
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:03,030
well
the let's see the protein that's made

6338
01:50:03,030 --> 01:50:03,040
the let's see the protein that's made
 

6339
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:05,109
the let's see the protein that's made
could that be an issue

6340
01:50:05,109 --> 01:50:05,119
could that be an issue
 

6341
01:50:05,119 --> 01:50:07,430
could that be an issue
and again proteins

6342
01:50:07,430 --> 01:50:07,440
and again proteins
 

6343
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:10,470
and again proteins
don't last forever they have a finite

6344
01:50:10,470 --> 01:50:10,480
don't last forever they have a finite
 

6345
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:12,470
don't last forever they have a finite
longevity in the body

6346
01:50:12,470 --> 01:50:12,480
longevity in the body
 

6347
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:14,550
longevity in the body
and this one also

6348
01:50:14,550 --> 01:50:14,560
and this one also
 

6349
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:17,350
and this one also
lasts perhaps at the best a few weeks

6350
01:50:17,350 --> 01:50:17,360
lasts perhaps at the best a few weeks
 

6351
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:19,270
lasts perhaps at the best a few weeks
now this is a protein that's made after

6352
01:50:19,270 --> 01:50:19,280
now this is a protein that's made after
 

6353
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:20,390
now this is a protein that's made after
the

6354
01:50:20,390 --> 01:50:20,400
the
 

6355
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:22,709
the
the rna gets into the cell yeah so the

6356
01:50:22,709 --> 01:50:22,719
the rna gets into the cell yeah so the
 

6357
01:50:22,719 --> 01:50:24,950
the rna gets into the cell yeah so the
lipid nanoparticles taken up into a cell

6358
01:50:24,950 --> 01:50:24,960
lipid nanoparticles taken up into a cell
 

6359
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:26,950
lipid nanoparticles taken up into a cell
and the mrna is translated and you get

6360
01:50:26,950 --> 01:50:26,960
and the mrna is translated and you get
 

6361
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:28,870
and the mrna is translated and you get
protein made and there's also a question

6362
01:50:28,870 --> 01:50:28,880
protein made and there's also a question
 

6363
01:50:28,880 --> 01:50:31,189
protein made and there's also a question
i'm sorry to interrupt where

6364
01:50:31,189 --> 01:50:31,199
i'm sorry to interrupt where
 

6365
01:50:31,199 --> 01:50:33,109
i'm sorry to interrupt where
where in the body so because it's not

6366
01:50:33,109 --> 01:50:33,119
where in the body so because it's not
 

6367
01:50:33,119 --> 01:50:35,030
where in the body so because it's not
well targeted

6368
01:50:35,030 --> 01:50:35,040
well targeted
 

6369
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:36,149
well targeted
or

6370
01:50:36,149 --> 01:50:36,159
or
 

6371
01:50:36,159 --> 01:50:37,589
or
i don't i don't know if it's supposed to

6372
01:50:37,589 --> 01:50:37,599
i don't i don't know if it's supposed to
 

6373
01:50:37,599 --> 01:50:39,350
i don't i don't know if it's supposed to
be targeted but it can go throughout the

6374
01:50:39,350 --> 01:50:39,360
be targeted but it can go throughout the
 

6375
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:41,430
be targeted but it can go throughout the
body that's one right so it's injected

6376
01:50:41,430 --> 01:50:41,440
body that's one right so it's injected
 

6377
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:44,390
body that's one right so it's injected
deep into your deltoid muscle right your

6378
01:50:44,390 --> 01:50:44,400
deep into your deltoid muscle right your
 

6379
01:50:44,400 --> 01:50:46,070
deep into your deltoid muscle right your
shoulder

6380
01:50:46,070 --> 01:50:46,080
shoulder
 

6381
01:50:46,080 --> 01:50:47,669
shoulder
and

6382
01:50:47,669 --> 01:50:47,679
and
 

6383
01:50:47,679 --> 01:50:49,270
and
the idea is not to put it in a blood

6384
01:50:49,270 --> 01:50:49,280
the idea is not to put it in a blood
 

6385
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:51,270
the idea is not to put it in a blood
vessel otherwise it would then for sure

6386
01:50:51,270 --> 01:50:51,280
vessel otherwise it would then for sure
 

6387
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:53,189
vessel otherwise it would then for sure
circulate everywhere so

6388
01:50:53,189 --> 01:50:53,199
circulate everywhere so
 

6389
01:50:53,199 --> 01:50:55,830
circulate everywhere so
they go deep in a blood vessel and it's

6390
01:50:55,830 --> 01:50:55,840
they go deep in a blood vessel and it's
 

6391
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:58,790
they go deep in a blood vessel and it's
it's locally injected and they did

6392
01:50:58,790 --> 01:50:58,800
it's locally injected and they did
 

6393
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:00,390
it's locally injected and they did
before this even went into people they

6394
01:51:00,390 --> 01:51:00,400
before this even went into people they
 

6395
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:02,149
before this even went into people they
did experiments in mice where they gave

6396
01:51:02,149 --> 01:51:02,159
did experiments in mice where they gave
 

6397
01:51:02,159 --> 01:51:02,870
did experiments in mice where they gave
them

6398
01:51:02,870 --> 01:51:02,880
them
 

6399
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:04,870
them
a thousand times higher concentrations

6400
01:51:04,870 --> 01:51:04,880
a thousand times higher concentrations
 

6401
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:06,870
a thousand times higher concentrations
than they would ever give to people and

6402
01:51:06,870 --> 01:51:06,880
than they would ever give to people and
 

6403
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:08,229
than they would ever give to people and
then when you do that it can go

6404
01:51:08,229 --> 01:51:08,239
then when you do that it can go
 

6405
01:51:08,239 --> 01:51:10,070
then when you do that it can go
everywhere basically you can find this

6406
01:51:10,070 --> 01:51:10,080
everywhere basically you can find this
 

6407
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:12,470
everywhere basically you can find this
these nanoparticles in every tissue of

6408
01:51:12,470 --> 01:51:12,480
these nanoparticles in every tissue of
 

6409
01:51:12,480 --> 01:51:13,910
these nanoparticles in every tissue of
the mouse

6410
01:51:13,910 --> 01:51:13,920
the mouse
 

6411
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:15,990
the mouse
but that's at a thousand-fold higher

6412
01:51:15,990 --> 01:51:16,000
but that's at a thousand-fold higher
 

6413
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,070
but that's at a thousand-fold higher
concentration right so

6414
01:51:18,070 --> 01:51:18,080
concentration right so
 

6415
01:51:18,080 --> 01:51:19,270
concentration right so
i think

6416
01:51:19,270 --> 01:51:19,280
i think
 

6417
01:51:19,280 --> 01:51:21,109
i think
at the levels that we're using in people

6418
01:51:21,109 --> 01:51:21,119
at the levels that we're using in people
 

6419
01:51:21,119 --> 01:51:22,709
at the levels that we're using in people
most of it's staying in the muscle but

6420
01:51:22,709 --> 01:51:22,719
most of it's staying in the muscle but
 

6421
01:51:22,719 --> 01:51:26,470
most of it's staying in the muscle but
sure small small amounts go elsewhere

6422
01:51:26,470 --> 01:51:26,480
sure small small amounts go elsewhere
 

6423
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:28,470
sure small small amounts go elsewhere
could there be a lot of harm caused if

6424
01:51:28,470 --> 01:51:28,480
could there be a lot of harm caused if
 

6425
01:51:28,480 --> 01:51:31,030
could there be a lot of harm caused if
it goes elsewhere in like let's say

6426
01:51:31,030 --> 01:51:31,040
it goes elsewhere in like let's say
 

6427
01:51:31,040 --> 01:51:33,669
it goes elsewhere in like let's say
ridiculously high quantities i'm trying

6428
01:51:33,669 --> 01:51:33,679
ridiculously high quantities i'm trying
 

6429
01:51:33,679 --> 01:51:35,510
ridiculously high quantities i'm trying
to understand what is the damage that

6430
01:51:35,510 --> 01:51:35,520
to understand what is the damage that
 

6431
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:36,709
to understand what is the damage that
could be done

6432
01:51:36,709 --> 01:51:36,719
could be done
 

6433
01:51:36,719 --> 01:51:39,270
could be done
from an rna just floating about

6434
01:51:39,270 --> 01:51:39,280
from an rna just floating about
 

6435
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:40,950
from an rna just floating about
so the rna itself is not going to be a

6436
01:51:40,950 --> 01:51:40,960
so the rna itself is not going to be a
 

6437
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:42,470
so the rna itself is not going to be a
problem it's the protein that is a

6438
01:51:42,470 --> 01:51:42,480
problem it's the protein that is a
 

6439
01:51:42,480 --> 01:51:44,629
problem it's the protein that is a
protein encoded in it right this is a

6440
01:51:44,629 --> 01:51:44,639
protein encoded in it right this is a
 

6441
01:51:44,639 --> 01:51:46,390
protein encoded in it right this is a
viral rna which

6442
01:51:46,390 --> 01:51:46,400
viral rna which
 

6443
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:49,430
viral rna which
has no sequence in us so there's nothing

6444
01:51:49,430 --> 01:51:49,440
has no sequence in us so there's nothing
 

6445
01:51:49,440 --> 01:51:51,589
has no sequence in us so there's nothing
that it could do it's the protein that i

6446
01:51:51,589 --> 01:51:51,599
that it could do it's the protein that i
 

6447
01:51:51,599 --> 01:51:52,950
that it could do it's the protein that i
would say

6448
01:51:52,950 --> 01:51:52,960
would say
 

6449
01:51:52,960 --> 01:51:54,790
would say
you you could ask what is that going to

6450
01:51:54,790 --> 01:51:54,800
you you could ask what is that going to
 

6451
01:51:54,800 --> 01:51:56,070
you you could ask what is that going to
do

6452
01:51:56,070 --> 01:51:56,080
do
 

6453
01:51:56,080 --> 01:51:57,109
do
and

6454
01:51:57,109 --> 01:51:57,119
and
 

6455
01:51:57,119 --> 01:51:59,669
and
the one property we know about

6456
01:51:59,669 --> 01:51:59,679
the one property we know about
 

6457
01:51:59,679 --> 01:52:01,669
the one property we know about
the spike

6458
01:52:01,669 --> 01:52:01,679
the spike
 

6459
01:52:01,679 --> 01:52:04,950
the spike
is that it can cause fusion

6460
01:52:04,950 --> 01:52:04,960
is that it can cause fusion
 

6461
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:06,390
is that it can cause fusion
of cells

6462
01:52:06,390 --> 01:52:06,400
of cells
 

6463
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:08,070
of cells
right that's how the virus gets in in

6464
01:52:08,070 --> 01:52:08,080
right that's how the virus gets in in
 

6465
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:11,669
right that's how the virus gets in in
the beginning the spike attaches to the

6466
01:52:11,669 --> 01:52:11,679
the beginning the spike attaches to the
 

6467
01:52:11,679 --> 01:52:15,589
the beginning the spike attaches to the
cell by this h2 receptor and it

6468
01:52:15,589 --> 01:52:15,599
cell by this h2 receptor and it
 

6469
01:52:15,599 --> 01:52:17,189
cell by this h2 receptor and it
causes the virus

6470
01:52:17,189 --> 01:52:17,199
causes the virus
 

6471
01:52:17,199 --> 01:52:19,030
causes the virus
and the cell to fuse

6472
01:52:19,030 --> 01:52:19,040
and the cell to fuse
 

6473
01:52:19,040 --> 01:52:20,470
and the cell to fuse
and that's how the rna gets out of the

6474
01:52:20,470 --> 01:52:20,480
and that's how the rna gets out of the
 

6475
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:23,589
and that's how the rna gets out of the
particle but so wait uh i'm a bit

6476
01:52:23,589 --> 01:52:23,599
particle but so wait uh i'm a bit
 

6477
01:52:23,599 --> 01:52:26,870
particle but so wait uh i'm a bit
confused so with this mrna vaccine with

6478
01:52:26,870 --> 01:52:26,880
confused so with this mrna vaccine with
 

6479
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:29,430
confused so with this mrna vaccine with
the lipids and the rna there's no spike

6480
01:52:29,430 --> 01:52:29,440
the lipids and the rna there's no spike
 

6481
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:30,550
the lipids and the rna there's no spike
right

6482
01:52:30,550 --> 01:52:30,560
right
 

6483
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:33,350
right
the the mrna codes for the spike oh the

6484
01:52:33,350 --> 01:52:33,360
the the mrna codes for the spike oh the
 

6485
01:52:33,360 --> 01:52:35,830
the the mrna codes for the spike oh the
mrna codes so it creates the spike it

6486
01:52:35,830 --> 01:52:35,840
mrna codes so it creates the spike it
 

6487
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:37,589
mrna codes so it creates the spike it
creates a spike so that spike could

6488
01:52:37,589 --> 01:52:37,599
creates a spike so that spike could
 

6489
01:52:37,599 --> 01:52:40,790
creates a spike so that spike could
cause fusion of cells yes except

6490
01:52:40,790 --> 01:52:40,800
cause fusion of cells yes except
 

6491
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:44,149
cause fusion of cells yes except
they modified the spike so it wouldn't

6492
01:52:44,149 --> 01:52:44,159
they modified the spike so it wouldn't
 

6493
01:52:44,159 --> 01:52:45,830
they modified the spike so it wouldn't
got it they made two amino acid changes

6494
01:52:45,830 --> 01:52:45,840
got it they made two amino acid changes
 

6495
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:47,270
got it they made two amino acid changes
in the spike so it would not fuse so

6496
01:52:47,270 --> 01:52:47,280
in the spike so it would not fuse so
 

6497
01:52:47,280 --> 01:52:49,510
in the spike so it would not fuse so
they understand enough which amino acids

6498
01:52:49,510 --> 01:52:49,520
they understand enough which amino acids
 

6499
01:52:49,520 --> 01:52:51,189
they understand enough which amino acids
are responsible for the fusion that's

6500
01:52:51,189 --> 01:52:51,199
are responsible for the fusion that's
 

6501
01:52:51,199 --> 01:52:53,510
are responsible for the fusion that's
right interesting this is so they could

6502
01:52:53,510 --> 01:52:53,520
right interesting this is so they could
 

6503
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:55,109
right interesting this is so they could
modify it so now it's not going to cause

6504
01:52:55,109 --> 01:52:55,119
modify it so now it's not going to cause
 

6505
01:52:55,119 --> 01:52:57,189
modify it so now it's not going to cause
fusion so that's not an issue it's

6506
01:52:57,189 --> 01:52:57,199
fusion so that's not an issue it's
 

6507
01:52:57,199 --> 01:52:59,990
fusion so that's not an issue it's
called the pre-fusion stabilized spike

6508
01:52:59,990 --> 01:53:00,000
called the pre-fusion stabilized spike
 

6509
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:01,270
called the pre-fusion stabilized spike
um

6510
01:53:01,270 --> 01:53:01,280
um
 

6511
01:53:01,280 --> 01:53:04,070
um
the spike when it binds ace2

6512
01:53:04,070 --> 01:53:04,080
the spike when it binds ace2
 

6513
01:53:04,080 --> 01:53:06,709
the spike when it binds ace2
that that top falls off and the spike

6514
01:53:06,709 --> 01:53:06,719
that that top falls off and the spike
 

6515
01:53:06,719 --> 01:53:08,229
that that top falls off and the spike
and the part of the spike that causes

6516
01:53:08,229 --> 01:53:08,239
and the part of the spike that causes
 

6517
01:53:08,239 --> 01:53:09,669
and the part of the spike that causes
fusion is now exposed and that doesn't

6518
01:53:09,669 --> 01:53:09,679
fusion is now exposed and that doesn't
 

6519
01:53:09,679 --> 01:53:10,950
fusion is now exposed and that doesn't
happen in this

6520
01:53:10,950 --> 01:53:10,960
happen in this
 

6521
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:13,350
happen in this
mrna vaccine so

6522
01:53:13,350 --> 01:53:13,360
mrna vaccine so
 

6523
01:53:13,360 --> 01:53:14,470
mrna vaccine so
those are the things that could have

6524
01:53:14,470 --> 01:53:14,480
those are the things that could have
 

6525
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:16,149
those are the things that could have
happened but i think they're

6526
01:53:16,149 --> 01:53:16,159
happened but i think they're
 

6527
01:53:16,159 --> 01:53:18,390
happened but i think they're
ruled out by what we've just said but

6528
01:53:18,390 --> 01:53:18,400
ruled out by what we've just said but
 

6529
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:20,470
ruled out by what we've just said but
there's no better test than putting it

6530
01:53:20,470 --> 01:53:20,480
there's no better test than putting it
 

6531
01:53:20,480 --> 01:53:23,510
there's no better test than putting it
into people right right and doing phase

6532
01:53:23,510 --> 01:53:23,520
into people right right and doing phase
 

6533
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:25,430
into people right right and doing phase
one phase two and phase three in

6534
01:53:25,430 --> 01:53:25,440
one phase two and phase three in
 

6535
01:53:25,440 --> 01:53:27,510
one phase two and phase three in
increasing numbers of people and asking

6536
01:53:27,510 --> 01:53:27,520
increasing numbers of people and asking
 

6537
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:29,750
increasing numbers of people and asking
what do we see do we do we have any

6538
01:53:29,750 --> 01:53:29,760
what do we see do we do we have any
 

6539
01:53:29,760 --> 01:53:33,189
what do we see do we do we have any
concerns and so now it's been in

6540
01:53:33,189 --> 01:53:33,199
concerns and so now it's been in
 

6541
01:53:33,199 --> 01:53:35,270
concerns and so now it's been in
many millions of people

6542
01:53:35,270 --> 01:53:35,280
many millions of people
 

6543
01:53:35,280 --> 01:53:36,870
many millions of people
and we don't see

6544
01:53:36,870 --> 01:53:36,880
and we don't see
 

6545
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:40,790
and we don't see
most of the effects you see in a vaccine

6546
01:53:40,790 --> 01:53:40,800
most of the effects you see in a vaccine
 

6547
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:43,189
most of the effects you see in a vaccine
you see in the first couple of months

6548
01:53:43,189 --> 01:53:43,199
you see in the first couple of months
 

6549
01:53:43,199 --> 01:53:45,430
you see in the first couple of months
things like the myocarditis with some of

6550
01:53:45,430 --> 01:53:45,440
things like the myocarditis with some of
 

6551
01:53:45,440 --> 01:53:47,109
things like the myocarditis with some of
the vaccines the clotting issues with

6552
01:53:47,109 --> 01:53:47,119
the vaccines the clotting issues with
 

6553
01:53:47,119 --> 01:53:50,709
the vaccines the clotting issues with
the astrazeneca vaccine guillain-barre

6554
01:53:50,709 --> 01:53:50,719
the astrazeneca vaccine guillain-barre
 

6555
01:53:50,719 --> 01:53:52,070
the astrazeneca vaccine guillain-barre
you see those

6556
01:53:52,070 --> 01:53:52,080
you see those
 

6557
01:53:52,080 --> 01:53:54,870
you see those
relatively quickly um

6558
01:53:54,870 --> 01:53:54,880
relatively quickly um
 

6559
01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:57,270
relatively quickly um
and we've seen small numbers of those

6560
01:53:57,270 --> 01:53:57,280
and we've seen small numbers of those
 

6561
01:53:57,280 --> 01:53:58,229
and we've seen small numbers of those
occur

6562
01:53:58,229 --> 01:53:58,239
occur
 

6563
01:53:58,239 --> 01:53:59,510
occur
but um

6564
01:53:59,510 --> 01:53:59,520
but um
 

6565
01:53:59,520 --> 01:54:02,629
but um
other things we haven't seen and

6566
01:54:02,629 --> 01:54:02,639
other things we haven't seen and
 

6567
01:54:02,639 --> 01:54:04,790
other things we haven't seen and
you know you you never say never right

6568
01:54:04,790 --> 01:54:04,800
you know you you never say never right
 

6569
01:54:04,800 --> 01:54:06,709
you know you you never say never right
right so i mean this is fascinating

6570
01:54:06,709 --> 01:54:06,719
right so i mean this is fascinating
 

6571
01:54:06,719 --> 01:54:07,669
right so i mean this is fascinating
right

6572
01:54:07,669 --> 01:54:07,679
right
 

6573
01:54:07,679 --> 01:54:09,189
right
it's like uh

6574
01:54:09,189 --> 01:54:09,199
it's like uh
 

6575
01:54:09,199 --> 01:54:10,950
it's like uh
i i drink

6576
01:54:10,950 --> 01:54:10,960
i i drink
 

6577
01:54:10,960 --> 01:54:14,709
i i drink
uh i put splenda in my coffee

6578
01:54:14,709 --> 01:54:14,719
uh i put splenda in my coffee
 

6579
01:54:14,719 --> 01:54:16,709
uh i put splenda in my coffee
and has

6580
01:54:16,709 --> 01:54:16,719
and has
 

6581
01:54:16,719 --> 01:54:20,310
and has
supposedly uh no calories

6582
01:54:20,310 --> 01:54:20,320
supposedly uh no calories
 

6583
01:54:20,320 --> 01:54:23,430
supposedly uh no calories
but it tastes really good and i this

6584
01:54:23,430 --> 01:54:23,440
but it tastes really good and i this
 

6585
01:54:23,440 --> 01:54:25,669
but it tastes really good and i this
despite what like rumors and blogs and

6586
01:54:25,669 --> 01:54:25,679
despite what like rumors and blogs and
 

6587
01:54:25,679 --> 01:54:27,510
despite what like rumors and blogs and
so on i have not seen good medical

6588
01:54:27,510 --> 01:54:27,520
so on i have not seen good medical
 

6589
01:54:27,520 --> 01:54:29,030
so on i have not seen good medical
evidence

6590
01:54:29,030 --> 01:54:29,040
evidence
 

6591
01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:31,350
evidence
that is harmful to you

6592
01:54:31,350 --> 01:54:31,360
that is harmful to you
 

6593
01:54:31,360 --> 01:54:34,310
that is harmful to you
but it's like it tastes too good

6594
01:54:34,310 --> 01:54:34,320
but it's like it tastes too good
 

6595
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:36,149
but it's like it tastes too good
so i'm thinking like there's got to be

6596
01:54:36,149 --> 01:54:36,159
so i'm thinking like there's got to be
 

6597
01:54:36,159 --> 01:54:38,470
so i'm thinking like there's got to be
long-term consequences but it's very

6598
01:54:38,470 --> 01:54:38,480
long-term consequences but it's very
 

6599
01:54:38,480 --> 01:54:40,310
long-term consequences but it's very
difficult to understand what the

6600
01:54:40,310 --> 01:54:40,320
difficult to understand what the
 

6601
01:54:40,320 --> 01:54:42,550
difficult to understand what the
long-term consequences are

6602
01:54:42,550 --> 01:54:42,560
long-term consequences are
 

6603
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:44,550
long-term consequences are
uh like that

6604
01:54:44,550 --> 01:54:44,560
uh like that
 

6605
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:46,149
uh like that
and there's this kind of

6606
01:54:46,149 --> 01:54:46,159
and there's this kind of
 

6607
01:54:46,159 --> 01:54:49,350
and there's this kind of
like distant fear or anxiety about it

6608
01:54:49,350 --> 01:54:49,360
like distant fear or anxiety about it
 

6609
01:54:49,360 --> 01:54:51,270
like distant fear or anxiety about it
like this thing tastes too good it's too

6610
01:54:51,270 --> 01:54:51,280
like this thing tastes too good it's too
 

6611
01:54:51,280 --> 01:54:52,870
like this thing tastes too good it's too
good to be true

6612
01:54:52,870 --> 01:54:52,880
good to be true
 

6613
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:54,470
good to be true
there's got to be there's no free launch

6614
01:54:54,470 --> 01:54:54,480
there's got to be there's no free launch
 

6615
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:55,750
there's got to be there's no free launch
in this world

6616
01:54:55,750 --> 01:54:55,760
in this world
 

6617
01:54:55,760 --> 01:54:57,350
in this world
this is the kind of feeling that people

6618
01:54:57,350 --> 01:54:57,360
this is the kind of feeling that people
 

6619
01:54:57,360 --> 01:54:59,350
this is the kind of feeling that people
have about the long-term effects of the

6620
01:54:59,350 --> 01:54:59,360
have about the long-term effects of the
 

6621
01:54:59,360 --> 01:55:01,589
have about the long-term effects of the
vaccine

6622
01:55:01,589 --> 01:55:01,599
vaccine
 

6623
01:55:01,599 --> 01:55:02,470
vaccine
that

6624
01:55:02,470 --> 01:55:02,480
that
 

6625
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:03,750
that
you mentioned that there's some

6626
01:55:03,750 --> 01:55:03,760
you mentioned that there's some
 

6627
01:55:03,760 --> 01:55:05,750
you mentioned that there's some
intuition about near-term effects that

6628
01:55:05,750 --> 01:55:05,760
intuition about near-term effects that
 

6629
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:07,669
intuition about near-term effects that
you want to uh

6630
01:55:07,669 --> 01:55:07,679
you want to uh
 

6631
01:55:07,679 --> 01:55:10,310
you want to uh
uh remove like the diffusion of cells

6632
01:55:10,310 --> 01:55:10,320
uh remove like the diffusion of cells
 

6633
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:11,830
uh remove like the diffusion of cells
and all those kinds of things but they

6634
01:55:11,830 --> 01:55:11,840
and all those kinds of things but they
 

6635
01:55:11,840 --> 01:55:14,149
and all those kinds of things but they
think okay this travels to other cells

6636
01:55:14,149 --> 01:55:14,159
think okay this travels to other cells
 

6637
01:55:14,159 --> 01:55:16,070
think okay this travels to other cells
in the body it travels to

6638
01:55:16,070 --> 01:55:16,080
in the body it travels to
 

6639
01:55:16,080 --> 01:55:18,709
in the body it travels to
uh neurons or that kind of stuff and

6640
01:55:18,709 --> 01:55:18,719
uh neurons or that kind of stuff and
 

6641
01:55:18,719 --> 01:55:20,149
uh neurons or that kind of stuff and
then what kind of effect does that have

6642
01:55:20,149 --> 01:55:20,159
then what kind of effect does that have
 

6643
01:55:20,159 --> 01:55:22,790
then what kind of effect does that have
long term that's yet to be discovered

6644
01:55:22,790 --> 01:55:22,800
long term that's yet to be discovered
 

6645
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:25,030
long term that's yet to be discovered
what do you make i mean for this vaccine

6646
01:55:25,030 --> 01:55:25,040
what do you make i mean for this vaccine
 

6647
01:55:25,040 --> 01:55:27,270
what do you make i mean for this vaccine
but in general in science about

6648
01:55:27,270 --> 01:55:27,280
but in general in science about
 

6649
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:29,910
but in general in science about
making statements about long-term

6650
01:55:29,910 --> 01:55:29,920
making statements about long-term
 

6651
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:32,790
making statements about long-term
uh negative effects is that something

6652
01:55:32,790 --> 01:55:32,800
uh negative effects is that something
 

6653
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:34,709
uh negative effects is that something
that weighs heavy on you is that

6654
01:55:34,709 --> 01:55:34,719
that weighs heavy on you is that
 

6655
01:55:34,719 --> 01:55:36,550
that weighs heavy on you is that
something we can kind of escape through

6656
01:55:36,550 --> 01:55:36,560
something we can kind of escape through
 

6657
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:38,950
something we can kind of escape through
just large-scale experimentation

6658
01:55:38,950 --> 01:55:38,960
just large-scale experimentation
 

6659
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:41,510
just large-scale experimentation
with human with animals and humans well

6660
01:55:41,510 --> 01:55:41,520
with human with animals and humans well
 

6661
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:42,790
with human with animals and humans well
if you're really

6662
01:55:42,790 --> 01:55:42,800
if you're really
 

6663
01:55:42,800 --> 01:55:44,229
if you're really
if you're concerned about long-term then

6664
01:55:44,229 --> 01:55:44,239
if you're concerned about long-term then
 

6665
01:55:44,239 --> 01:55:45,910
if you're concerned about long-term then
you have to do a long-term experiment

6666
01:55:45,910 --> 01:55:45,920
you have to do a long-term experiment
 

6667
01:55:45,920 --> 01:55:46,629
you have to do a long-term experiment
right

6668
01:55:46,629 --> 01:55:46,639
right
 

6669
01:55:46,639 --> 01:55:47,910
right
and

6670
01:55:47,910 --> 01:55:47,920
and
 

6671
01:55:47,920 --> 01:55:49,830
and
maybe you don't see something for 50 60

6672
01:55:49,830 --> 01:55:49,840
maybe you don't see something for 50 60
 

6673
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:51,910
maybe you don't see something for 50 60
years so

6674
01:55:51,910 --> 01:55:51,920
years so
 

6675
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:53,430
years so
if someone says to you there are no

6676
01:55:53,430 --> 01:55:53,440
if someone says to you there are no
 

6677
01:55:53,440 --> 01:55:56,629
if someone says to you there are no
long-term effects of the covid vaccines

6678
01:55:56,629 --> 01:55:56,639
long-term effects of the covid vaccines
 

6679
01:55:56,639 --> 01:55:57,750
long-term effects of the covid vaccines
they can't say that because they haven't

6680
01:55:57,750 --> 01:55:57,760
they can't say that because they haven't
 

6681
01:55:57,760 --> 01:56:00,470
they can't say that because they haven't
done the long experiment right right is

6682
01:56:00,470 --> 01:56:00,480
done the long experiment right right is
 

6683
01:56:00,480 --> 01:56:02,390
done the long experiment right right is
always the possibility but you have to

6684
01:56:02,390 --> 01:56:02,400
always the possibility but you have to
 

6685
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:03,910
always the possibility but you have to
weigh it it's always

6686
01:56:03,910 --> 01:56:03,920
weigh it it's always
 

6687
01:56:03,920 --> 01:56:05,910
weigh it it's always
there's no free lunch right

6688
01:56:05,910 --> 01:56:05,920
there's no free lunch right
 

6689
01:56:05,920 --> 01:56:08,629
there's no free lunch right
there's always a risk benefit

6690
01:56:08,629 --> 01:56:08,639
there's always a risk benefit
 

6691
01:56:08,639 --> 01:56:10,550
there's always a risk benefit
calculation you have to make you can

6692
01:56:10,550 --> 01:56:10,560
calculation you have to make you can
 

6693
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:12,390
calculation you have to make you can
have the study that goes for 50 years

6694
01:56:12,390 --> 01:56:12,400
have the study that goes for 50 years
 

6695
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:14,790
have the study that goes for 50 years
and and then decide but i guess what

6696
01:56:14,790 --> 01:56:14,800
and and then decide but i guess what
 

6697
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:16,709
and and then decide but i guess what
you're doing is you

6698
01:56:16,709 --> 01:56:16,719
you're doing is you
 

6699
01:56:16,719 --> 01:56:18,870
you're doing is you
just like we said um

6700
01:56:18,870 --> 01:56:18,880
just like we said um
 

6701
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:20,870
just like we said um
i forget with which one with polio with

6702
01:56:20,870 --> 01:56:20,880
i forget with which one with polio with
 

6703
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:23,910
i forget with which one with polio with
rabies i forget but you're weighing

6704
01:56:23,910 --> 01:56:23,920
rabies i forget but you're weighing
 

6705
01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:26,390
rabies i forget but you're weighing
the side effects yeah

6706
01:56:26,390 --> 01:56:26,400
the side effects yeah
 

6707
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:28,470
the side effects yeah
the vaccine versus

6708
01:56:28,470 --> 01:56:28,480
the vaccine versus
 

6709
01:56:28,480 --> 01:56:31,030
the vaccine versus
the effects of the virus

6710
01:56:31,030 --> 01:56:31,040
the effects of the virus
 

6711
01:56:31,040 --> 01:56:33,270
the effects of the virus
and like both of them you don't know

6712
01:56:33,270 --> 01:56:33,280
and like both of them you don't know
 

6713
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:35,510
and like both of them you don't know
long-term effects

6714
01:56:35,510 --> 01:56:35,520
long-term effects
 

6715
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:38,070
long-term effects
but you're building up intuition as you

6716
01:56:38,070 --> 01:56:38,080
but you're building up intuition as you
 

6717
01:56:38,080 --> 01:56:40,310
but you're building up intuition as you
study which what are the long-term

6718
01:56:40,310 --> 01:56:40,320
study which what are the long-term
 

6719
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:43,189
study which what are the long-term
effects like there there's a huge number

6720
01:56:43,189 --> 01:56:43,199
effects like there there's a huge number
 

6721
01:56:43,199 --> 01:56:44,709
effects like there there's a huge number
of

6722
01:56:44,709 --> 01:56:44,719
of
 

6723
01:56:44,719 --> 01:56:46,070
of
people

6724
01:56:46,070 --> 01:56:46,080
people
 

6725
01:56:46,080 --> 01:56:46,950
people
like

6726
01:56:46,950 --> 01:56:46,960
like
 

6727
01:56:46,960 --> 01:56:48,950
like
um

6728
01:56:48,950 --> 01:56:48,960

01:57:26,390 --> 01:57:26,400
right so the cognitive stuff that's

and then you look at the same thing with

6774
01:57:30,470 --> 01:57:30,480
and then you look at the same thing with
 

6775
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:32,310
and then you look at the same thing with
the vaccine

6776
01:57:32,310 --> 01:57:32,320
the vaccine
 

6777
01:57:32,320 --> 01:57:34,550
the vaccine
and there seems to be less of that

6778

and there seems to be less of that
 

6779
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:36,229
and there seems to be less of that
but of course you don't know

01:57:36,229 --> 01:57:36,239
but of course you don't know
 

6781
01:57:36,239 --> 01:57:37,990
but of course you don't know
if it's some kind of dormant thing

now you have to understand parents were
dying for a polio vaccine because kids

dying for a polio vaccine because kids
 

6821
01:58:19,280 --> 01:58:21,750
dying for a polio vaccine because kids
were getting paralyzed every summer 30

6887
01:59:19,679 --> 01:59:21,990

01:59:25,840 --> 01:59:27,270
should probably have not used that
vaccine any longer but i think that

6894
01:59:27,270 --> 01:59:27,280
vaccine any longer but i think that
 

6895
01:59:27,280 --> 01:59:29,430
vaccine any longer but i think that
destroys public confidence but those

6896
01:59:29,430 --> 01:59:29,440
destroys public confidence but those
 

6897
01:59:29,440 --> 01:59:31,109
destroys public confidence but those
aren't they're not long minority of

6898
01:59:31,109 --> 01:59:31,119
aren't they're not long minority of
 

6899
01:59:31,119 --> 01:59:32,790
aren't they're not long minority of
cases this minority this is a very rare

6900
01:59:32,790 --> 01:59:32,800
cases this minority this is a very rare
 

6901
01:59:32,800 --> 01:59:34,550
cases this minority this is a very rare
event yeah but nevertheless science is

6902
01:59:34,550 --> 01:59:34,560
event yeah but nevertheless science is
 

6903
01:59:34,560 --> 01:59:36,229
event yeah but nevertheless science is
an institution

6904
01:59:36,229 --> 01:59:36,239
an institution
 

6905
01:59:36,239 --> 01:59:38,550
an institution
uh didn't

6906
01:59:38,550 --> 01:59:38,560
uh didn't
 

6907
01:59:38,560 --> 01:59:40,550
uh didn't
make corrections in that case no they

6908
01:59:40,550 --> 01:59:40,560
make corrections in that case no they
 

6909
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:42,790
make corrections in that case no they
didn't so what do you

6910
01:59:42,790 --> 01:59:42,800
didn't so what do you
 

6911
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:44,629
didn't so what do you
make of

6912
01:59:44,629 --> 01:59:44,639
make of
 

6913
01:59:44,639 --> 01:59:46,950
make of
that i mean it's very unfortunate that

6914
01:59:46,950 --> 01:59:46,960
that i mean it's very unfortunate that
 

6915
01:59:46,960 --> 01:59:50,229
that i mean it's very unfortunate that
those few things can destroy trust

6916
01:59:50,229 --> 01:59:50,239
those few things can destroy trust
 

6917
01:59:50,239 --> 01:59:51,830
those few things can destroy trust
but i don't think that lasts till today

6918
01:59:51,830 --> 01:59:51,840
but i don't think that lasts till today
 

6919
01:59:51,840 --> 01:59:54,070
but i don't think that lasts till today
i think today is a different era right

6920
01:59:54,070 --> 01:59:54,080
i think today is a different era right
 

6921
01:59:54,080 --> 01:59:55,589
i think today is a different era right
yeah and most people don't know about

6922
01:59:55,589 --> 01:59:55,599
yeah and most people don't know about
 

6923
01:59:55,599 --> 01:59:58,550
yeah and most people don't know about
those stories i tell them to you because

6924
01:59:58,550 --> 01:59:58,560
those stories i tell them to you because
 

6925
01:59:58,560 --> 02:00:00,149
those stories i tell them to you because
that's what could happen i think it

6926
02:00:00,149 --> 02:00:00,159
that's what could happen i think it
 

6927
02:00:00,159 --> 02:00:02,149
that's what could happen i think it
could happen today

6928
02:00:02,149 --> 02:00:02,159
could happen today
 

6929
02:00:02,159 --> 02:00:04,550
could happen today
if you look at the history of

6930
02:00:04,550 --> 02:00:04,560
if you look at the history of
 

6931
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:07,510
if you look at the history of
the the polio vaccine

6932
02:00:07,510 --> 02:00:07,520
the the polio vaccine
 

6933
02:00:07,520 --> 02:00:09,750
the the polio vaccine
the u.s public health service wanted

6934
02:00:09,750 --> 02:00:09,760
the u.s public health service wanted
 

6935
02:00:09,760 --> 02:00:12,629
the u.s public health service wanted
kids to be vaccinated so they did things

6936
02:00:12,629 --> 02:00:12,639
kids to be vaccinated so they did things
 

6937
02:00:12,639 --> 02:00:14,709
kids to be vaccinated so they did things
that probably weren't correct to get the

6938
02:00:14,709 --> 02:00:14,719
that probably weren't correct to get the
 

6939
02:00:14,719 --> 02:00:17,510
that probably weren't correct to get the
vaccine back online right but they they

6940
02:00:17,510 --> 02:00:17,520
vaccine back online right but they they
 

6941
02:00:17,520 --> 02:00:19,510
vaccine back online right but they they
did it and they pushed it through

6942
02:00:19,510 --> 02:00:19,520
did it and they pushed it through
 

6943
02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:21,430
did it and they pushed it through
um so where

6944
02:00:21,430 --> 02:00:21,440
um so where
 

6945
02:00:21,440 --> 02:00:23,669
um so where
the question is what do we do today

6946
02:00:23,669 --> 02:00:23,679
the question is what do we do today
 

6947
02:00:23,679 --> 02:00:24,550
the question is what do we do today
so

6948
02:00:24,550 --> 02:00:24,560
so
 

6949
02:00:24,560 --> 02:00:26,629
so
i can look at

6950
02:00:26,629 --> 02:00:26,639
i can look at
 

6951
02:00:26,639 --> 02:00:28,229
i can look at
as we just said i can look at what might

6952
02:00:28,229 --> 02:00:28,239
as we just said i can look at what might
 

6953
02:00:28,239 --> 02:00:29,109
as we just said i can look at what might
happen

6954
02:00:29,109 --> 02:00:29,119
happen
 

6955
02:00:29,119 --> 02:00:29,910
happen
and

6956
02:00:29,910 --> 02:00:29,920
and
 

6957
02:00:29,920 --> 02:00:31,030
and
i can

6958
02:00:31,030 --> 02:00:31,040
i can
 

6959
02:00:31,040 --> 02:00:32,629
i can
make reasonable

6960
02:00:32,629 --> 02:00:32,639
make reasonable
 

6961
02:00:32,639 --> 02:00:34,550
make reasonable
decisions about the likelihood of them

6962
02:00:34,550 --> 02:00:34,560
decisions about the likelihood of them
 

6963
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:36,870
decisions about the likelihood of them
happening and i can also say

6964
02:00:36,870 --> 02:00:36,880
happening and i can also say
 

6965
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:38,950
happening and i can also say
i don't want to get covet of any kind

6966
02:00:38,950 --> 02:00:38,960
i don't want to get covet of any kind
 

6967
02:00:38,960 --> 02:00:41,669
i don't want to get covet of any kind
because i've seen how nasty it can be

6968
02:00:41,669 --> 02:00:41,679
because i've seen how nasty it can be
 

6969
02:00:41,679 --> 02:00:42,950
because i've seen how nasty it can be
and i decide

6970
02:00:42,950 --> 02:00:42,960
and i decide
 

6971
02:00:42,960 --> 02:00:45,189
and i decide
i'm taking the risk whatever small of a

6972
02:00:45,189 --> 02:00:45,199
i'm taking the risk whatever small of a
 

6973
02:00:45,199 --> 02:00:46,629
i'm taking the risk whatever small of a
long-term effect i'm going to take the

6974
02:00:46,629 --> 02:00:46,639
long-term effect i'm going to take the
 

6975
02:00:46,639 --> 02:00:48,950
long-term effect i'm going to take the
risk my family took the risk and many

6976
02:00:48,950 --> 02:00:48,960
risk my family took the risk and many
 

6977
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:51,189
risk my family took the risk and many
other people did of a vaccine of getting

6978
02:00:51,189 --> 02:00:51,199
other people did of a vaccine of getting
 

6979
02:00:51,199 --> 02:00:52,470
other people did of a vaccine of getting
vaccinated

6980
02:00:52,470 --> 02:00:52,480
vaccinated
 

6981
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:54,229
vaccinated
because i think it's very small but i

6982
02:00:54,229 --> 02:00:54,239
because i think it's very small but i
 

6983
02:00:54,239 --> 02:00:55,990
because i think it's very small but i
understand where people can't make that

6984
02:00:55,990 --> 02:00:56,000
understand where people can't make that
 

6985
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,470
understand where people can't make that
decision and that begs the question what

6986
02:00:58,470 --> 02:00:58,480
decision and that begs the question what
 

6987
02:00:58,480 --> 02:00:59,910
decision and that begs the question what
would they need

6988
02:00:59,910 --> 02:00:59,920
would they need
 

6989
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:01,589
would they need
to make a decision so if you're

6990
02:01:01,589 --> 02:01:01,599
to make a decision so if you're
 

6991
02:01:01,599 --> 02:01:03,270
to make a decision so if you're
concerned about

6992
02:01:03,270 --> 02:01:03,280
concerned about
 

6993
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:06,709
concerned about
an effect in 40 years

6994
02:01:06,709 --> 02:01:06,719
an effect in 40 years
 

6995
02:01:06,719 --> 02:01:09,109
an effect in 40 years
we're not going to know for 40 years

6996
02:01:09,109 --> 02:01:09,119
we're not going to know for 40 years
 

6997
02:01:09,119 --> 02:01:10,870
we're not going to know for 40 years
yeah so i think if i were to speak

6998
02:01:10,870 --> 02:01:10,880
yeah so i think if i were to speak
 

6999
02:01:10,880 --> 02:01:12,870
yeah so i think if i were to speak
because i suppose as i talked to like i

7000
02:01:12,870 --> 02:01:12,880
because i suppose as i talked to like i
 

7001
02:01:12,880 --> 02:01:14,950
because i suppose as i talked to like i
mentioned offline to joe rogan and his

7002
02:01:14,950 --> 02:01:14,960
mentioned offline to joe rogan and his
 

7003
02:01:14,960 --> 02:01:16,870
mentioned offline to joe rogan and his
podcast yesterday i talked to him all

7004
02:01:16,870 --> 02:01:16,880
podcast yesterday i talked to him all
 

7005
02:01:16,880 --> 02:01:18,629
podcast yesterday i talked to him all
the time about this

7006
02:01:18,629 --> 02:01:18,639
the time about this
 

7007
02:01:18,639 --> 02:01:21,510
the time about this
i think the concern

7008
02:01:21,510 --> 02:01:21,520
i think the concern
 

7009
02:01:21,520 --> 02:01:23,589
i think the concern
is less about

7010
02:01:23,589 --> 02:01:23,599
is less about
 

7011
02:01:23,599 --> 02:01:25,189
is less about
the uh

7012
02:01:25,189 --> 02:01:25,199
the uh
 

7013
02:01:25,199 --> 02:01:27,189
the uh
long-term effects

7014
02:01:27,189 --> 02:01:27,199
long-term effects
 

7015
02:01:27,199 --> 02:01:29,910
long-term effects
like on paper it's more about the

7016
02:01:29,910 --> 02:01:29,920
like on paper it's more about the
 

7017
02:01:29,920 --> 02:01:32,709
like on paper it's more about the

just being inauthentic there's a there's

generation now there's a certain way on

7056
02:02:10,629 --> 02:02:10,639
generation now there's a certain way on
 

7057
02:02:10,639 --> 02:02:12,870
generation now there's a certain way on
the internet like the internet can smell

7058
02:02:12,870 --> 02:02:14,149
the internet like the internet can smell
 

7059
02:02:14,149 --> 02:02:14,159

 

7060
02:02:14,159 --> 02:02:16,070

much better than previous generations

7061
02:02:16,070 --> 02:02:16,080
much better than previous generations
 

7062
02:02:16,080 --> 02:02:16,790
much better than previous generations
could

7063
02:02:16,790 --> 02:02:16,800
could
 

7064
02:02:16,800 --> 02:02:19,430
could
and so they they see there's a kind of

7065
02:02:19,430 --> 02:02:19,440
and so they they see there's a kind of
 

7066
02:02:19,440 --> 02:02:20,589
and so they they see there's a kind of
um

7067
02:02:20,589 --> 02:02:20,599
um
 

7068
02:02:20,599 --> 02:02:23,350
um
inauthenticity that comes with being

7069
02:02:23,350 --> 02:02:23,360
inauthenticity that comes with being
 

7070
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:24,470
inauthenticity that comes with being
uh

7071
02:02:24,470 --> 02:02:24,480
uh
 

7072
02:02:24,480 --> 02:02:27,030
uh
like representing authority like i am a

7073
02:02:27,030 --> 02:02:27,040
like representing authority like i am a
 

7074
02:02:27,040 --> 02:02:30,390
like representing authority like i am a
scientist i'm an expert i have a phd i

7075
02:02:30,390 --> 02:02:30,400
scientist i'm an expert i have a phd i
 

7076
02:02:30,400 --> 02:02:32,310
scientist i'm an expert i have a phd i
have four decades of work therefore

7077
02:02:32,310 --> 02:02:32,320
have four decades of work therefore
 

7078
02:02:32,320 --> 02:02:34,470
have four decades of work therefore
everyone should listen to me got it and

7079
02:02:34,470 --> 02:02:34,480
everyone should listen to me got it and
 

7080
02:02:34,480 --> 02:02:37,109
everyone should listen to me got it and
somehow that maps to

7081
02:02:37,109 --> 02:02:37,119
somehow that maps to
 

7082
02:02:37,119 --> 02:02:38,470
somehow that maps to
this feeling

7083
02:02:38,470 --> 02:02:38,480
this feeling
 

7084
02:02:38,480 --> 02:02:41,030
this feeling
of well what are they hiding if they're

7085
02:02:41,030 --> 02:02:41,040
of well what are they hiding if they're
 

7086
02:02:41,040 --> 02:02:43,350
of well what are they hiding if they're
speaking from authority like this if

7087
02:02:43,350 --> 02:02:43,360
speaking from authority like this if
 

7088
02:02:43,360 --> 02:02:45,750
speaking from authority like this if
everyone is in agreement like this that

7089
02:02:45,750 --> 02:02:45,760
everyone is in agreement like this that
 

7090
02:02:45,760 --> 02:02:47,830
everyone is in agreement like this that
means they all have emails between each

7091
02:02:47,830 --> 02:02:47,840
means they all have emails between each
 

7092
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:49,350
means they all have emails between each
other they said we're going to tell this

7093
02:02:49,350 --> 02:02:49,360
other they said we're going to tell this
 

7094
02:02:49,360 --> 02:02:50,709
other they said we're going to tell this
this is the message we're going to tell

7095
02:02:50,709 --> 02:02:50,719
this is the message we're going to tell
 

7096
02:02:50,719 --> 02:02:51,750
this is the message we're going to tell
the public

7097
02:02:51,750 --> 02:02:51,760
the public
 

7098
02:02:51,760 --> 02:02:53,430
the public
then what is the truth

7099
02:02:53,430 --> 02:02:53,440
then what is the truth
 

7100
02:02:53,440 --> 02:02:55,750
then what is the truth
the actual truth maybe there's a much

7101
02:02:55,750 --> 02:02:55,760
the actual truth maybe there's a much
 

7102
02:02:55,760 --> 02:02:58,390
the actual truth maybe there's a much
bigger uncertainty maybe there's dead

7103
02:02:58,390 --> 02:02:58,400
bigger uncertainty maybe there's dead
 

7104
02:02:58,400 --> 02:03:00,229
bigger uncertainty maybe there's dead
people in the basement that they're

7105
02:03:00,229 --> 02:03:00,239
people in the basement that they're
 

7106
02:03:00,239 --> 02:03:02,870
people in the basement that they're
hiding from from bad mrna vaccine

7107
02:03:02,870 --> 02:03:02,880
hiding from from bad mrna vaccine
 

7108
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:05,030
hiding from from bad mrna vaccine
experiments maybe they're and then and

7109
02:03:05,030 --> 02:03:05,040
experiments maybe they're and then and
 

7110
02:03:05,040 --> 02:03:07,030
experiments maybe they're and then and
then the conspiracy theories start to

7111
02:03:07,030 --> 02:03:07,040
then the conspiracy theories start to
 

7112
02:03:07,040 --> 02:03:08,070
then the conspiracy theories start to
grow

7113
02:03:08,070 --> 02:03:08,080
grow
 

7114
02:03:08,080 --> 02:03:09,990
grow
uh naturally when there's this kind of

7115
02:03:09,990 --> 02:03:10,000
uh naturally when there's this kind of
 

7116
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,790
uh naturally when there's this kind of
mistrust of the that so it's less about

7117
02:03:12,790 --> 02:03:12,800
mistrust of the that so it's less about
 

7118
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:16,070
mistrust of the that so it's less about
kind of

7119
02:03:16,070 --> 02:03:16,080

 

7120
02:03:16,080 --> 02:03:17,830

like a deep concern about long-term

7121
02:03:17,830 --> 02:03:17,840
like a deep concern about long-term
 

7122
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:18,950
like a deep concern about long-term
effects

7123
02:03:18,950 --> 02:03:18,960
effects
 

7124
02:03:18,960 --> 02:03:20,950
effects
it's a concern about

7125
02:03:20,950 --> 02:03:20,960
it's a concern about
 

7126
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:24,629
it's a concern about
long-term effects

7127
02:03:24,629 --> 02:03:24,639

 

7128
02:03:24,639 --> 02:03:26,709

if we find out that there's some secret

7129
02:03:26,709 --> 02:03:26,719
if we find out that there's some secret
 

7130
02:03:26,719 --> 02:03:28,790
if we find out that there's some secret
stuff that we're not being told it all

7131
02:03:28,790 --> 02:03:28,800
stuff that we're not being told it all
 

7132
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:30,950
stuff that we're not being told it all
runs on that so what what the heck i

7133
02:03:30,950 --> 02:03:30,960
runs on that so what what the heck i
 

7134
02:03:30,960 --> 02:03:32,950
runs on that so what what the heck i
mean i so i put the blame not on the

7135
02:03:32,950 --> 02:03:32,960
mean i so i put the blame not on the
 

7136
02:03:32,960 --> 02:03:35,589
mean i so i put the blame not on the
data but basically on the leaders and

7137
02:03:35,589 --> 02:03:35,599
data but basically on the leaders and
 

7138
02:03:35,599 --> 02:03:37,189
data but basically on the leaders and
the community communicators of the

7139
02:03:37,189 --> 02:03:37,199
the community communicators of the
 

7140
02:03:37,199 --> 02:03:39,189
the community communicators of the
science at the top

7141
02:03:39,189 --> 02:03:39,199
science at the top
 

7142
02:03:39,199 --> 02:03:42,310
science at the top
well to that i would say

7143
02:03:42,310 --> 02:03:42,320
well to that i would say
 

7144
02:03:42,320 --> 02:03:43,589
well to that i would say
all the data

7145
02:03:43,589 --> 02:03:43,599
all the data
 

7146
02:03:43,599 --> 02:03:47,030
all the data
as far as i know are made public

7147
02:03:47,030 --> 02:03:47,040
as far as i know are made public
 

7148
02:03:47,040 --> 02:03:49,430
as far as i know are made public
so you can dive into it and i know a lot

7149
02:03:49,430 --> 02:03:49,440
so you can dive into it and i know a lot
 

7150
02:03:49,440 --> 02:03:51,830
so you can dive into it and i know a lot
of people ask me questions and i just

7151
02:03:51,830 --> 02:03:51,840
of people ask me questions and i just
 

7152
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:53,510
of people ask me questions and i just
say it's right here

7153
02:03:53,510 --> 02:03:53,520
say it's right here
 

7154
02:03:53,520 --> 02:03:55,030
say it's right here
in the data and i know a lot of people

7155
02:03:55,030 --> 02:03:55,040
in the data and i know a lot of people
 

7156
02:03:55,040 --> 02:03:57,270
in the data and i know a lot of people
can't do that they can't dive into it

7157
02:03:57,270 --> 02:03:57,280
can't do that they can't dive into it
 

7158
02:03:57,280 --> 02:03:59,270
can't do that they can't dive into it
but that's one solution for people who

7159
02:03:59,270 --> 02:03:59,280
but that's one solution for people who
 

7160
02:03:59,280 --> 02:04:01,750
but that's one solution for people who
are able it's now you could argue well

7161
02:04:01,750 --> 02:04:01,760
are able it's now you could argue well
 

7162
02:04:01,760 --> 02:04:04,149
are able it's now you could argue well
maybe they've left data out well then

7163
02:04:04,149 --> 02:04:04,159
maybe they've left data out well then
 

7164
02:04:04,159 --> 02:04:05,990
maybe they've left data out well then
not even i can help because then they're

7165
02:04:05,990 --> 02:04:06,000
not even i can help because then they're
 

7166
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:07,669
not even i can help because then they're
hiding it from me too and i think that's

7167
02:04:07,669 --> 02:04:07,679
hiding it from me too and i think that's
 

7168
02:04:07,679 --> 02:04:09,589
hiding it from me too and i think that's
highly unlikely i think for the most

7169
02:04:09,589 --> 02:04:09,599
highly unlikely i think for the most
 

7170
02:04:09,599 --> 02:04:12,069
highly unlikely i think for the most
part the fda requires the release of all

7171
02:04:12,069 --> 02:04:12,079
part the fda requires the release of all
 

7172
02:04:12,079 --> 02:04:14,870
part the fda requires the release of all
the clinical trial data right so okay

7173
02:04:14,870 --> 02:04:14,880
the clinical trial data right so okay
 

7174
02:04:14,880 --> 02:04:17,030
the clinical trial data right so okay
what so this clinical trial data that's

7175
02:04:17,030 --> 02:04:17,040
what so this clinical trial data that's
 

7176
02:04:17,040 --> 02:04:18,629
what so this clinical trial data that's
one thing so that's the data that we

7177
02:04:18,629 --> 02:04:18,639
one thing so that's the data that we
 

7178
02:04:18,639 --> 02:04:20,550
one thing so that's the data that we
should be focusing on right is it so

7179
02:04:20,550 --> 02:04:20,560
should be focusing on right is it so
 

7180
02:04:20,560 --> 02:04:22,870
should be focusing on right is it so
there's there's a lot of different

7181
02:04:22,870 --> 02:04:22,880
there's there's a lot of different
 

7182
02:04:22,880 --> 02:04:25,270
there's there's a lot of different
data sets here so there's preclinical

7183
02:04:25,270 --> 02:04:25,280
data sets here so there's preclinical
 

7184
02:04:25,280 --> 02:04:26,629
data sets here so there's preclinical
data which is

7185
02:04:26,629 --> 02:04:26,639
data which is
 

7186
02:04:26,639 --> 02:04:28,149
data which is
everything that was done in the lab

7187
02:04:28,149 --> 02:04:28,159
everything that was done in the lab
 

7188
02:04:28,159 --> 02:04:29,910
everything that was done in the lab
before this vaccine ever went into a

7189
02:04:29,910 --> 02:04:29,920
before this vaccine ever went into a
 

7190
02:04:29,920 --> 02:04:32,149
before this vaccine ever went into a
human arm it's all the cell culture work

7191
02:04:32,149 --> 02:04:32,159
human arm it's all the cell culture work
 

7192
02:04:32,159 --> 02:04:33,830
human arm it's all the cell culture work
that we talked about a little

7193
02:04:33,830 --> 02:04:33,840
that we talked about a little
 

7194
02:04:33,840 --> 02:04:35,830
that we talked about a little
experiments in animals

7195
02:04:35,830 --> 02:04:35,840
experiments in animals
 

7196
02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:38,470
experiments in animals
all of that is publicly accessible most

7197
02:04:38,470 --> 02:04:38,480
all of that is publicly accessible most
 

7198
02:04:38,480 --> 02:04:40,550
all of that is publicly accessible most
of it gets published and then there's

7199
02:04:40,550 --> 02:04:40,560
of it gets published and then there's
 

7200
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:44,149
of it gets published and then there's
the initial drug filing which is huge

7201
02:04:44,149 --> 02:04:44,159
the initial drug filing which is huge
 

7202
02:04:44,159 --> 02:04:45,990
the initial drug filing which is huge
the books of dot you can get that and

7203
02:04:45,990 --> 02:04:46,000
the books of dot you can get that and
 

7204
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:47,589
the books of dot you can get that and
look at it right this is me sort of

7205
02:04:47,589 --> 02:04:47,599
look at it right this is me sort of
 

7206
02:04:47,599 --> 02:04:49,510
look at it right this is me sort of
asking sort of difficult questions here

7207
02:04:49,510 --> 02:04:49,520
asking sort of difficult questions here
 

7208
02:04:49,520 --> 02:04:50,830
asking sort of difficult questions here
right okay

7209
02:04:50,830 --> 02:04:50,840
right okay
 

7210
02:04:50,840 --> 02:04:53,830
right okay
uh so there is a there's a lot of money

7211
02:04:53,830 --> 02:04:53,840
uh so there is a there's a lot of money
 

7212
02:04:53,840 --> 02:04:57,030
uh so there is a there's a lot of money
to be made by makers of the vaccine

7213
02:04:57,030 --> 02:04:57,040
to be made by makers of the vaccine
 

7214
02:04:57,040 --> 02:04:58,310
to be made by makers of the vaccine
so

7215
02:04:58,310 --> 02:04:58,320
so
 

7216
02:04:58,320 --> 02:04:59,030
so
for

7217
02:04:59,030 --> 02:04:59,040
for
 

7218
02:04:59,040 --> 02:05:00,390
for
these company obviously there's a

7219
02:05:00,390 --> 02:05:00,400
these company obviously there's a
 

7220
02:05:00,400 --> 02:05:02,790
these company obviously there's a
distrust of those folks too they've done

7221
02:05:02,790 --> 02:05:02,800
distrust of those folks too they've done
 

7222
02:05:02,800 --> 02:05:04,149
distrust of those folks too they've done
a lot of really good things in this

7223
02:05:04,149 --> 02:05:04,159
a lot of really good things in this
 

7224
02:05:04,159 --> 02:05:05,430
a lot of really good things in this
world but they've

7225
02:05:05,430 --> 02:05:05,440
world but they've
 

7226
02:05:05,440 --> 02:05:07,669
world but they've
there's the incentives are such that you

7227
02:05:07,669 --> 02:05:07,679
there's the incentives are such that you
 

7228
02:05:07,679 --> 02:05:09,990
there's the incentives are such that you
want to sweep stuff under the rug

7229
02:05:09,990 --> 02:05:10,000
want to sweep stuff under the rug
 

7230
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:13,189
want to sweep stuff under the rug
if if you're not 100

7231
02:05:13,189 --> 02:05:13,199
if if you're not 100
 

7232
02:05:13,199 --> 02:05:15,430
if if you're not 100
pure in your ethics

7233
02:05:15,430 --> 02:05:15,440
pure in your ethics
 

7234
02:05:15,440 --> 02:05:16,550
pure in your ethics
and

7235
02:05:16,550 --> 02:05:16,560
and
 

7236
02:05:16,560 --> 02:05:19,270
and
how hard is it for for that data to be

7237
02:05:19,270 --> 02:05:19,280
how hard is it for for that data to be
 

7238
02:05:19,280 --> 02:05:20,550
how hard is it for for that data to be
fabricated

7239
02:05:20,550 --> 02:05:20,560
fabricated
 

7240
02:05:20,560 --> 02:05:22,950
fabricated
uh manipulated

7241
02:05:22,950 --> 02:05:22,960
uh manipulated
 

7242
02:05:22,960 --> 02:05:25,270
uh manipulated
like what's your intuition for the the

7243
02:05:25,270 --> 02:05:25,280
like what's your intuition for the the
 

7244
02:05:25,280 --> 02:05:27,030
like what's your intuition for the the
pre-trial stuff i think when you when

7245
02:05:27,030 --> 02:05:27,040
pre-trial stuff i think when you when
 

7246
02:05:27,040 --> 02:05:28,069
pre-trial stuff i think when you when
you start

7247
02:05:28,069 --> 02:05:28,079
you start
 

7248
02:05:28,079 --> 02:05:31,350
you start
fabricating then you get inconsistencies

7249
02:05:31,350 --> 02:05:31,360
fabricating then you get inconsistencies
 

7250
02:05:31,360 --> 02:05:32,310
fabricating then you get inconsistencies
which are

7251
02:05:32,310 --> 02:05:32,320
which are
 

7252
02:05:32,320 --> 02:05:34,709
which are
pretty easy to pick up when you talk

7253
02:05:34,709 --> 02:05:34,719
pretty easy to pick up when you talk
 

7254
02:05:34,719 --> 02:05:36,950
pretty easy to pick up when you talk
about some large-scale things of this

7255
02:05:36,950 --> 02:05:36,960
about some large-scale things of this
 

7256
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:37,990
about some large-scale things of this
nature

7257
02:05:37,990 --> 02:05:38,000
nature
 

7258
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,310
nature
because then you can look through the

7259
02:05:40,310 --> 02:05:40,320
because then you can look through the
 

7260
02:05:40,320 --> 02:05:42,550
because then you can look through the
data very you're gonna i mean we require

7261
02:05:42,550 --> 02:05:42,560
data very you're gonna i mean we require
 

7262
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:44,229
data very you're gonna i mean we require
looking very carefully but you will see

7263
02:05:44,229 --> 02:05:44,239
looking very carefully but you will see
 

7264
02:05:44,239 --> 02:05:45,830
looking very carefully but you will see
inconsistencies from one trial to

7265
02:05:45,830 --> 02:05:45,840
inconsistencies from one trial to
 

7266
02:05:45,840 --> 02:05:46,790
inconsistencies from one trial to
another

7267
02:05:46,790 --> 02:05:46,800
another
 

7268
02:05:46,800 --> 02:05:48,790
another
and uh that might ring a bell that

7269
02:05:48,790 --> 02:05:48,800
and uh that might ring a bell that
 

7270
02:05:48,800 --> 02:05:50,709
and uh that might ring a bell that
something's been done

7271
02:05:50,709 --> 02:05:50,719
something's been done
 

7272
02:05:50,719 --> 02:05:52,550
something's been done
yeah

7273
02:05:52,550 --> 02:05:52,560
yeah
 

7274
02:05:52,560 --> 02:05:53,910
yeah
it's like it's like the moon landing

7275
02:05:53,910 --> 02:05:53,920
it's like it's like the moon landing
 

7276
02:05:53,920 --> 02:05:56,629
it's like it's like the moon landing
thing i think sometimes like going to

7277
02:05:56,629 --> 02:05:56,639
thing i think sometimes like going to
 

7278
02:05:56,639 --> 02:05:59,350
thing i think sometimes like going to
the moon is easier than faking it

7279
02:05:59,350 --> 02:05:59,360
the moon is easier than faking it
 

7280
02:05:59,360 --> 02:06:00,069
the moon is easier than faking it
right

7281
02:06:00,069 --> 02:06:00,079
right
 

7282
02:06:00,079 --> 02:06:01,750
right
in the sense it might be it might be

7283
02:06:01,750 --> 02:06:01,760
in the sense it might be it might be
 

7284
02:06:01,760 --> 02:06:03,669
in the sense it might be it might be
easier to do a large-scale trial and get

7285
02:06:03,669 --> 02:06:03,679
easier to do a large-scale trial and get
 

7286
02:06:03,679 --> 02:06:05,910
easier to do a large-scale trial and get
an effective vaccine versus faking it

7287
02:06:05,910 --> 02:06:05,920
an effective vaccine versus faking it
 

7288
02:06:05,920 --> 02:06:07,030
an effective vaccine versus faking it
but you know when you brought up the

7289
02:06:07,030 --> 02:06:07,040
but you know when you brought up the
 

7290
02:06:07,040 --> 02:06:09,270
but you know when you brought up the
for-profit issue i i think that is

7291
02:06:09,270 --> 02:06:09,280
for-profit issue i i think that is
 

7292
02:06:09,280 --> 02:06:10,790
for-profit issue i i think that is
always been

7293
02:06:10,790 --> 02:06:10,800
always been
 

7294
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:14,629
always been
an issue i've always felt that

7295
02:06:14,629 --> 02:06:14,639

 

7296
02:06:14,639 --> 02:06:17,430

having your health depend on for-profit

7297
02:06:17,430 --> 02:06:17,440
having your health depend on for-profit
 

7298
02:06:17,440 --> 02:06:21,669
having your health depend on for-profit
industry may not be the best solution

7299
02:06:21,669 --> 02:06:21,679
industry may not be the best solution
 

7300
02:06:21,679 --> 02:06:23,109
industry may not be the best solution
and i don't know how else to do it

7301
02:06:23,109 --> 02:06:23,119
and i don't know how else to do it
 

7302
02:06:23,119 --> 02:06:25,030
and i don't know how else to do it
people tell me i'm a dreamer that

7303
02:06:25,030 --> 02:06:25,040
people tell me i'm a dreamer that
 

7304
02:06:25,040 --> 02:06:26,229
people tell me i'm a dreamer that
thinking that

7305
02:06:26,229 --> 02:06:26,239
thinking that
 

7306
02:06:26,239 --> 02:06:27,669
thinking that
you know all medicines could be

7307
02:06:27,669 --> 02:06:27,679
you know all medicines could be
 

7308
02:06:27,679 --> 02:06:29,750
you know all medicines could be
non-profit but i also think that the

7309
02:06:29,750 --> 02:06:29,760
non-profit but i also think that the
 

7310
02:06:29,760 --> 02:06:31,430
non-profit but i also think that the
world should have one health system that

7311
02:06:31,430 --> 02:06:31,440
world should have one health system that
 

7312
02:06:31,440 --> 02:06:32,950
world should have one health system that
takes care of everyone right because

7313
02:06:32,950 --> 02:06:32,960
takes care of everyone right because
 

7314
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:35,350
takes care of everyone right because
there are some countries that can't and

7315
02:06:35,350 --> 02:06:35,360
there are some countries that can't and
 

7316
02:06:35,360 --> 02:06:37,589
there are some countries that can't and
other countries have an excess like us

7317
02:06:37,589 --> 02:06:37,599
other countries have an excess like us
 

7318
02:06:37,599 --> 02:06:38,470
other countries have an excess like us
so

7319
02:06:38,470 --> 02:06:38,480
so
 

7320
02:06:38,480 --> 02:06:40,550
so
i wish we could do that well the

7321
02:06:40,550 --> 02:06:40,560
i wish we could do that well the
 

7322
02:06:40,560 --> 02:06:41,990
i wish we could do that well the
argument is

7323
02:06:41,990 --> 02:06:42,000
argument is
 

7324
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,229
argument is
the speed of which the vaccines for

7325
02:06:44,229 --> 02:06:44,239
the speed of which the vaccines for
 

7326
02:06:44,239 --> 02:06:45,830
the speed of which the vaccines for
covet were produced

7327
02:06:45,830 --> 02:06:45,840
covet were produced
 

7328
02:06:45,840 --> 02:06:48,550
covet were produced
would never happen in a non-profit

7329
02:06:48,550 --> 02:06:48,560
would never happen in a non-profit
 

7330
02:06:48,560 --> 02:06:50,470
would never happen in a non-profit
system would never happen in a

7331
02:06:50,470 --> 02:06:50,480
system would never happen in a
 

7332
02:06:50,480 --> 02:06:52,950
system would never happen in a
non-capitalist system oh i could set up

7333
02:06:52,950 --> 02:06:52,960
non-capitalist system oh i could set up
 

7334
02:06:52,960 --> 02:06:54,950
non-capitalist system oh i could set up
a vaccine production

7335
02:06:54,950 --> 02:06:54,960
a vaccine production
 

7336
02:06:54,960 --> 02:06:57,750
a vaccine production
institute in the u.s that would get the

7337
02:06:57,750 --> 02:06:57,760
institute in the u.s that would get the
 

7338
02:06:57,760 --> 02:06:59,990
institute in the u.s that would get the
vaccines done because you just need to

7339
02:06:59,990 --> 02:07:00,000
vaccines done because you just need to
 

7340
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:01,910
vaccines done because you just need to
put money into it that's what made these

7341
02:07:01,910 --> 02:07:01,920
put money into it that's what made these
 

7342
02:07:01,920 --> 02:07:04,069
put money into it that's what made these
vaccines get done money they poured

7343
02:07:04,069 --> 02:07:04,079
vaccines get done money they poured
 

7344
02:07:04,079 --> 02:07:05,830
vaccines get done money they poured
billions of dollars and they got it done

7345
02:07:05,830 --> 02:07:05,840
billions of dollars and they got it done
 

7346
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:06,870
billions of dollars and they got it done
quickly

7347
02:07:06,870 --> 02:07:06,880
quickly
 

7348
02:07:06,880 --> 02:07:08,950
quickly
but if i set up a non-profit institutes

7349
02:07:08,950 --> 02:07:08,960
but if i set up a non-profit institutes
 

7350
02:07:08,960 --> 02:07:11,189
but if i set up a non-profit institutes
of vaccines throughout the u.s staffed

7351
02:07:11,189 --> 02:07:11,199
of vaccines throughout the u.s staffed
 

7352
02:07:11,199 --> 02:07:12,870
of vaccines throughout the u.s staffed
with really talented people pay them

7353
02:07:12,870 --> 02:07:12,880
with really talented people pay them
 

7354
02:07:12,880 --> 02:07:15,350
with really talented people pay them
well keep them motivated you'll get your

7355
02:07:15,350 --> 02:07:15,360
well keep them motivated you'll get your
 

7356
02:07:15,360 --> 02:07:16,870
well keep them motivated you'll get your
vaccine no but

7357
02:07:16,870 --> 02:07:16,880
vaccine no but
 

7358
02:07:16,880 --> 02:07:19,589
vaccine no but
that's the thing with capitalism is that

7359
02:07:19,589 --> 02:07:19,599
that's the thing with capitalism is that
 

7360
02:07:19,599 --> 02:07:22,470
that's the thing with capitalism is that
uh the selection of who to hire like

7361
02:07:22,470 --> 02:07:22,480
uh the selection of who to hire like
 

7362
02:07:22,480 --> 02:07:24,870
uh the selection of who to hire like
good when you say good people yeah the

7363
02:07:24,870 --> 02:07:24,880
good when you say good people yeah the
 

7364
02:07:24,880 --> 02:07:26,470
good when you say good people yeah the
capitalist has a machine

7365
02:07:26,470 --> 02:07:26,480
capitalist has a machine
 

7366
02:07:26,480 --> 02:07:28,870
capitalist has a machine
that still fires people who are not good

7367
02:07:28,870 --> 02:07:28,880
that still fires people who are not good
 

7368
02:07:28,880 --> 02:07:30,870
that still fires people who are not good
and selects people are good

7369
02:07:30,870 --> 02:07:30,880
and selects people are good
 

7370
02:07:30,880 --> 02:07:33,270
and selects people are good
coming from the soviet union the dream

7371
02:07:33,270 --> 02:07:33,280
coming from the soviet union the dream
 

7372
02:07:33,280 --> 02:07:35,270
coming from the soviet union the dream
of communism is is similar to what

7373
02:07:35,270 --> 02:07:35,280
of communism is is similar to what
 

7374
02:07:35,280 --> 02:07:36,470
of communism is is similar to what
you're saying

7375
02:07:36,470 --> 02:07:36,480
you're saying
 

7376
02:07:36,480 --> 02:07:38,229
you're saying
broadly defined it certainly doesn't

7377
02:07:38,229 --> 02:07:38,239
broadly defined it certainly doesn't
 

7378
02:07:38,239 --> 02:07:40,790
broadly defined it certainly doesn't
work in the broad the question whether

7379
02:07:40,790 --> 02:07:40,800
work in the broad the question whether
 

7380
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:43,270
work in the broad the question whether
it works in the healthcare

7381
02:07:43,270 --> 02:07:43,280
it works in the healthcare
 

7382
02:07:43,280 --> 02:07:44,069
it works in the healthcare
uh

7383
02:07:44,069 --> 02:07:44,079
uh
 

7384
02:07:44,079 --> 02:07:45,189
uh
space

7385
02:07:45,189 --> 02:07:45,199
space
 

7386
02:07:45,199 --> 02:07:46,229
space
you know

7387
02:07:46,229 --> 02:07:46,239
you know
 

7388
02:07:46,239 --> 02:07:48,470
you know
there is some aspect to the machine of

7389
02:07:48,470 --> 02:07:48,480
there is some aspect to the machine of
 

7390
02:07:48,480 --> 02:07:51,270
there is some aspect to the machine of
capitalism being the most effective way

7391
02:07:51,270 --> 02:07:51,280
capitalism being the most effective way
 

7392
02:07:51,280 --> 02:07:53,430
capitalism being the most effective way
to select for good people and to

7393
02:07:53,430 --> 02:07:53,440
to select for good people and to
 

7394
02:07:53,440 --> 02:07:56,229
to select for good people and to
effectively produce the thing and but

7395
02:07:56,229 --> 02:07:56,239
effectively produce the thing and but
 

7396
02:07:56,239 --> 02:07:57,510
effectively produce the thing and but
then of course

7397
02:07:57,510 --> 02:07:57,520
then of course
 

7398
02:07:57,520 --> 02:07:58,950
then of course
a lot of people would argue the current

7399
02:07:58,950 --> 02:07:58,960
a lot of people would argue the current
 

7400
02:07:58,960 --> 02:08:01,030
a lot of people would argue the current
even the current healthcare is not

7401
02:08:01,030 --> 02:08:01,040
even the current healthcare is not
 

7402
02:08:01,040 --> 02:08:03,189
even the current healthcare is not
with like regulations there's some weird

7403
02:08:03,189 --> 02:08:03,199
with like regulations there's some weird
 

7404
02:08:03,199 --> 02:08:05,270
with like regulations there's some weird
mix where there's a lot of opportunities

7405
02:08:05,270 --> 02:08:05,280
mix where there's a lot of opportunities
 

7406
02:08:05,280 --> 02:08:07,589
mix where there's a lot of opportunities
for inefficiencies there's a lot of

7407
02:08:07,589 --> 02:08:07,599
for inefficiencies there's a lot of
 

7408
02:08:07,599 --> 02:08:09,350
for inefficiencies there's a lot of
opportunities for bureaucracy so you

7409
02:08:09,350 --> 02:08:09,360
opportunities for bureaucracy so you
 

7410
02:08:09,360 --> 02:08:10,950
opportunities for bureaucracy so you
have like the worst of

7411
02:08:10,950 --> 02:08:10,960
have like the worst of
 

7412
02:08:10,960 --> 02:08:12,470
have like the worst of
all the world can't there be some

7413
02:08:12,470 --> 02:08:12,480
all the world can't there be some
 

7414
02:08:12,480 --> 02:08:15,109
all the world can't there be some
intermediate that works because

7415
02:08:15,109 --> 02:08:15,119
intermediate that works because
 

7416
02:08:15,119 --> 02:08:16,790
intermediate that works because
i mean the other issue that we haven't

7417
02:08:16,790 --> 02:08:16,800
i mean the other issue that we haven't
 

7418
02:08:16,800 --> 02:08:18,550
i mean the other issue that we haven't
mentioned is that politics gets thrown

7419
02:08:18,550 --> 02:08:18,560
mentioned is that politics gets thrown
 

7420
02:08:18,560 --> 02:08:19,990
mentioned is that politics gets thrown
into this and

7421
02:08:19,990 --> 02:08:20,000
into this and
 

7422
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:21,669
into this and
that really messes up and it should

7423
02:08:21,669 --> 02:08:21,679
that really messes up and it should
 

7424
02:08:21,679 --> 02:08:23,510
that really messes up and it should
never be mixed with health care but it's

7425
02:08:23,510 --> 02:08:23,520
never be mixed with health care but it's
 

7426
02:08:23,520 --> 02:08:26,069
never be mixed with health care but it's
it is because a lot of funding comes

7427
02:08:26,069 --> 02:08:26,079
it is because a lot of funding comes
 

7428
02:08:26,079 --> 02:08:27,750
it is because a lot of funding comes
from the government so that's another

7429
02:08:27,750 --> 02:08:27,760
from the government so that's another
 

7430
02:08:27,760 --> 02:08:29,990
from the government so that's another
confounding factor but

7431
02:08:29,990 --> 02:08:30,000
confounding factor but
 

7432
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,229
confounding factor but
i i really think i could make

7433
02:08:32,229 --> 02:08:32,239
i i really think i could make
 

7434
02:08:32,239 --> 02:08:34,310
i i really think i could make
a vaccine institute that

7435
02:08:34,310 --> 02:08:34,320
a vaccine institute that
 

7436
02:08:34,320 --> 02:08:36,550
a vaccine institute that
if someone didn't do well i'd fire them

7437
02:08:36,550 --> 02:08:36,560
if someone didn't do well i'd fire them
 

7438
02:08:36,560 --> 02:08:38,310
if someone didn't do well i'd fire them
no you're not going to stay if you can't

7439
02:08:38,310 --> 02:08:38,320
no you're not going to stay if you can't
 

7440
02:08:38,320 --> 02:08:40,310
no you're not going to stay if you can't
do your job and do it well you don't

7441
02:08:40,310 --> 02:08:40,320
do your job and do it well you don't
 

7442
02:08:40,320 --> 02:08:41,910
do your job and do it well you don't
give them incentives but it doesn't have

7443
02:08:41,910 --> 02:08:41,920
give them incentives but it doesn't have
 

7444
02:08:41,920 --> 02:08:44,470
give them incentives but it doesn't have
to be the two extremes i think it has

7445
02:08:44,470 --> 02:08:44,480
to be the two extremes i think it has
 

7446
02:08:44,480 --> 02:08:46,550
to be the two extremes i think it has
there has to be a solution that people

7447
02:08:46,550 --> 02:08:46,560
there has to be a solution that people
 

7448
02:08:46,560 --> 02:08:47,350
there has to be a solution that people
don't

7449
02:08:47,350 --> 02:08:47,360
don't
 

7450
02:08:47,360 --> 02:08:50,629
don't
have this mistrust for a company making

7451
02:08:50,629 --> 02:08:50,639
have this mistrust for a company making
 

7452
02:08:50,639 --> 02:08:52,629
have this mistrust for a company making
huge profits off of a drug but you know

7453
02:08:52,629 --> 02:08:52,639
huge profits off of a drug but you know
 

7454
02:08:52,639 --> 02:08:54,870
huge profits off of a drug but you know
what it's funny

7455
02:08:54,870 --> 02:08:54,880
what it's funny
 

7456
02:08:54,880 --> 02:08:57,350
what it's funny
it seems that vaccines and antivirals

7457
02:08:57,350 --> 02:08:57,360
it seems that vaccines and antivirals
 

7458
02:08:57,360 --> 02:08:59,589
it seems that vaccines and antivirals
bear the brunt of this criticism yet

7459
02:08:59,589 --> 02:08:59,599
bear the brunt of this criticism yet
 

7460
02:08:59,599 --> 02:09:01,189
bear the brunt of this criticism yet
there are many other pharmaceuticals

7461
02:09:01,189 --> 02:09:01,199
there are many other pharmaceuticals
 

7462
02:09:01,199 --> 02:09:02,310
there are many other pharmaceuticals
that people

7463
02:09:02,310 --> 02:09:02,320
that people
 

7464
02:09:02,320 --> 02:09:04,790
that people
rely on yeah of all sorts they don't

7465
02:09:04,790 --> 02:09:04,800
rely on yeah of all sorts they don't
 

7466
02:09:04,800 --> 02:09:06,390
rely on yeah of all sorts they don't
seem to question and have issues with

7467
02:09:06,390 --> 02:09:06,400
seem to question and have issues with
 

7468
02:09:06,400 --> 02:09:07,589
seem to question and have issues with
those and they have far more side

7469
02:09:07,589 --> 02:09:07,599
those and they have far more side
 

7470
02:09:07,599 --> 02:09:10,069
those and they have far more side
effects than vaccines it's very strange

7471
02:09:10,069 --> 02:09:10,079
effects than vaccines it's very strange
 

7472
02:09:10,079 --> 02:09:11,189
effects than vaccines it's very strange
how we're

7473
02:09:11,189 --> 02:09:11,199
how we're
 

7474
02:09:11,199 --> 02:09:14,229
how we're
picking that way but i should also say

7475
02:09:14,229 --> 02:09:14,239
picking that way but i should also say
 

7476
02:09:14,239 --> 02:09:17,350
picking that way but i should also say
that when you know if you have one big

7477
02:09:17,350 --> 02:09:17,360
that when you know if you have one big
 

7478
02:09:17,360 --> 02:09:20,629
that when you know if you have one big
vaccine institute one of the other

7479
02:09:20,629 --> 02:09:20,639
vaccine institute one of the other
 

7480
02:09:20,639 --> 02:09:21,830
vaccine institute one of the other
like

7481
02:09:21,830 --> 02:09:21,840
like
 

7482
02:09:21,840 --> 02:09:24,149
like
sets of uh

7483
02:09:24,149 --> 02:09:24,159
sets of uh
 

7484
02:09:24,159 --> 02:09:26,629
sets of uh
vaccine conspiracies

7485
02:09:26,629 --> 02:09:26,639
vaccine conspiracies
 

7486
02:09:26,639 --> 02:09:28,310
vaccine conspiracies
i mean i would say they're

7487
02:09:28,310 --> 02:09:28,320
i mean i would say they're
 

7488
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:30,709
i mean i would say they're
a little farther out into the into the

7489
02:09:30,709 --> 02:09:30,719
a little farther out into the into the
 

7490
02:09:30,719 --> 02:09:33,830
a little farther out into the into the
wild set of ideas but it's you know

7491
02:09:33,830 --> 02:09:33,840
wild set of ideas but it's you know
 

7492
02:09:33,840 --> 02:09:35,830
wild set of ideas but it's you know
that's one way to con control the

7493
02:09:35,830 --> 02:09:35,840
that's one way to con control the
 

7494
02:09:35,840 --> 02:09:37,109
that's one way to con control the
populace

7495
02:09:37,109 --> 02:09:37,119
populace
 

7496
02:09:37,119 --> 02:09:38,870
populace
is by injecting

7497
02:09:38,870 --> 02:09:38,880
is by injecting
 

7498
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:42,310
is by injecting
substances into them right people i mean

7499
02:09:42,310 --> 02:09:42,320
substances into them right people i mean
 

7500
02:09:42,320 --> 02:09:44,229
substances into them right people i mean
part of that

7501
02:09:44,229 --> 02:09:44,239
part of that
 

7502
02:09:44,239 --> 02:09:45,589
part of that
funny enough is probably has to do with

7503
02:09:45,589 --> 02:09:45,599
funny enough is probably has to do with
 

7504
02:09:45,599 --> 02:09:47,990
funny enough is probably has to do with
needles versus uh something you put in

7505
02:09:47,990 --> 02:09:48,000
needles versus uh something you put in
 

7506
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:49,510
needles versus uh something you put in
your mouth yeah but there's something

7507
02:09:49,510 --> 02:09:49,520
your mouth yeah but there's something
 

7508
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:51,270
your mouth yeah but there's something
about the government especially when

7509
02:09:51,270 --> 02:09:51,280
about the government especially when
 

7510
02:09:51,280 --> 02:09:53,750
about the government especially when
it's governor mandated injection of a

7511
02:09:53,750 --> 02:09:53,760
it's governor mandated injection of a
 

7512
02:09:53,760 --> 02:09:56,470
it's governor mandated injection of a
substance into you i don't it doesn't i

7513
02:09:56,470 --> 02:09:56,480
substance into you i don't it doesn't i
 

7514
02:09:56,480 --> 02:09:57,990
substance into you i don't it doesn't i
don't care what the science says if it's

7515
02:09:57,990 --> 02:09:58,000
don't care what the science says if it's
 

7516
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,950
don't care what the science says if it's
100 effective 100 safe

7517
02:10:00,950 --> 02:10:00,960
100 effective 100 safe
 

7518
02:10:00,960 --> 02:10:04,310
100 effective 100 safe
there's a natural distrust of what like

7519
02:10:04,310 --> 02:10:04,320
there's a natural distrust of what like
 

7520
02:10:04,320 --> 02:10:06,709
there's a natural distrust of what like
even if this is effective

7521
02:10:06,709 --> 02:10:06,719
even if this is effective
 

7522
02:10:06,719 --> 02:10:08,870
even if this is effective
and safe

7523
02:10:08,870 --> 02:10:08,880
and safe
 

7524
02:10:08,880 --> 02:10:11,510
and safe
giving the government power to do this

7525
02:10:11,510 --> 02:10:11,520
giving the government power to do this
 

7526
02:10:11,520 --> 02:10:13,109
giving the government power to do this
yeah aren't they going to start getting

7527
02:10:13,109 --> 02:10:13,119
yeah aren't they going to start getting
 

7528
02:10:13,119 --> 02:10:17,510
yeah aren't they going to start getting
ideas down the line for you know uh

7529
02:10:17,510 --> 02:10:17,520
ideas down the line for you know uh
 

7530
02:10:17,520 --> 02:10:20,790
ideas down the line for you know uh
i i think that they can barely govern i

7531
02:10:20,790 --> 02:10:20,800
i i think that they can barely govern i
 

7532
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:22,550
i i think that they can barely govern i
don't think they're gonna do that but

7533
02:10:22,550 --> 02:10:22,560
don't think they're gonna do that but
 

7534
02:10:22,560 --> 02:10:24,629
don't think they're gonna do that but

7696
02:13:14,480 --> 02:13:17,589
scientist it's g whiz to me it's amazing
that it worked and i think the data are

7697
02:13:17,589 --> 02:13:17,599
that it worked and i think the data are
 

7698
02:13:17,599 --> 02:13:19,430
that it worked and i think the data are
great so i want it

7699
02:13:19,430 --> 02:13:19,440
great so i want it
 

7700
02:13:19,440 --> 02:13:21,830
great so i want it
well as a scientist i wanted one of the

7701
02:13:21,830 --> 02:13:21,840
well as a scientist i wanted one of the
 

7702
02:13:21,840 --> 02:13:24,550
well as a scientist i wanted one of the
really sad things again with me too as a

7703
02:13:24,550 --> 02:13:24,560
really sad things again with me too as a
 

7704
02:13:24,560 --> 02:13:29,669
really sad things again with me too as a
scientist or as a admirer of science is

7705
02:13:29,669 --> 02:13:29,679

 

7706
02:13:29,679 --> 02:13:31,910

i don't know if it's politics but one of

7707
02:13:31,910 --> 02:13:31,920
i don't know if it's politics but one of
 

7708
02:13:31,920 --> 02:13:33,750
i don't know if it's politics but one of
the sad things to me about the previous

7709
02:13:33,750 --> 02:13:33,760
the sad things to me about the previous
 

7710
02:13:33,760 --> 02:13:34,870
the sad things to me about the previous
year

7711
02:13:34,870 --> 02:13:34,880
year
 

7712
02:13:34,880 --> 02:13:35,990
year
is that

7713
02:13:35,990 --> 02:13:36,000
is that
 

7714
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,550
is that
i i wasn't free to celebrate the

7715
02:13:38,550 --> 02:13:38,560
i i wasn't free to celebrate the
 

7716
02:13:38,560 --> 02:13:40,950
i i wasn't free to celebrate the
incredible accomplishment of science

7717
02:13:40,950 --> 02:13:40,960
incredible accomplishment of science
 

7718
02:13:40,960 --> 02:13:43,430
incredible accomplishment of science
with the vaccines i was very skeptical

7719
02:13:43,430 --> 02:13:43,440
with the vaccines i was very skeptical
 

7720
02:13:43,440 --> 02:13:45,910
with the vaccines i was very skeptical
as possible to develop a vaccine

7721
02:13:45,910 --> 02:13:45,920
as possible to develop a vaccine
 

7722
02:13:45,920 --> 02:13:47,669
as possible to develop a vaccine
so quickly

7723
02:13:47,669 --> 02:13:47,679
so quickly
 

7724
02:13:47,679 --> 02:13:48,550
so quickly
so

7725
02:13:48,550 --> 02:13:48,560
so
 

7726
02:13:48,560 --> 02:13:50,629
so
it's unfortunate that we can't celebrate

7727
02:13:50,629 --> 02:13:50,639
it's unfortunate that we can't celebrate
 

7728
02:13:50,639 --> 02:13:52,870
it's unfortunate that we can't celebrate
how amazing humans are to to come up

7729
02:13:52,870 --> 02:13:52,880
how amazing humans are to to come up
 

7730
02:13:52,880 --> 02:13:54,950
how amazing humans are to to come up
with this vaccine now this vaccine might

7731
02:13:54,950 --> 02:13:54,960
with this vaccine now this vaccine might
 

7732
02:13:54,960 --> 02:13:57,189
with this vaccine now this vaccine might
have long-term effects

7733
02:13:57,189 --> 02:13:57,199
have long-term effects
 

7734
02:13:57,199 --> 02:14:00,069
have long-term effects
that doesn't mean this is not incredible

7735
02:14:00,069 --> 02:14:00,079
that doesn't mean this is not incredible
 

7736
02:14:00,079 --> 02:14:02,470
that doesn't mean this is not incredible
why why um

7737
02:14:02,470 --> 02:14:02,480
why why um
 

7738
02:14:02,480 --> 02:14:04,550
why why um
why couldn't you celebrate

7739
02:14:04,550 --> 02:14:04,560
why couldn't you celebrate
 

7740
02:14:04,560 --> 02:14:06,229
why couldn't you celebrate
um

7741
02:14:06,229 --> 02:14:06,239
um
 

7742
02:14:06,239 --> 02:14:08,149
um
because i would love to inspire the

7743
02:14:08,149 --> 02:14:08,159
because i would love to inspire the
 

7744
02:14:08,159 --> 02:14:09,830
because i would love to inspire the
world with the amazing things science

7745
02:14:09,830 --> 02:14:09,840
world with the amazing things science
 

7746
02:14:09,840 --> 02:14:11,270
world with the amazing things science
can do

7747
02:14:11,270 --> 02:14:11,280
can do
 

7748
02:14:11,280 --> 02:14:12,950
can do
and you know when you say something

7749
02:14:12,950 --> 02:14:12,960
and you know when you say something
 

7750
02:14:12,960 --> 02:14:14,629
and you know when you say something
about the vaccines they're not listening

7751
02:14:14,629 --> 02:14:14,639
about the vaccines they're not listening
 

7752
02:14:14,639 --> 02:14:16,390
about the vaccines they're not listening
to the science a lot of people are not

7753
02:14:16,390 --> 02:14:16,400
to the science a lot of people are not
 

7754
02:14:16,400 --> 02:14:18,069
to the science a lot of people are not
listening to the science what they hear

7755
02:14:18,069 --> 02:14:18,079
listening to the science what they hear
 

7756
02:14:18,079 --> 02:14:18,950
listening to the science what they hear
is

7757
02:14:18,950 --> 02:14:18,960
is
 

7758
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:21,350
is
oh you're um

7759
02:14:21,350 --> 02:14:21,360
oh you're um
 

7760
02:14:21,360 --> 02:14:23,589
oh you're um
you're a republican or you're a democrat

7761
02:14:23,589 --> 02:14:23,599
you're a republican or you're a democrat
 

7762
02:14:23,599 --> 02:14:25,350
you're a republican or you're a democrat
and you're social signaling of doing

7763
02:14:25,350 --> 02:14:25,360
and you're social signaling of doing
 

7764
02:14:25,360 --> 02:14:27,109
and you're social signaling of doing
some kind of signaling no i think that

7765
02:14:27,109 --> 02:14:27,119
some kind of signaling no i think that
 

7766
02:14:27,119 --> 02:14:28,709
some kind of signaling no i think that
the vaccine you're talking about

7767
02:14:28,709 --> 02:14:28,719
the vaccine you're talking about
 

7768
02:14:28,719 --> 02:14:31,350
the vaccine you're talking about
injecting something into you and maybe

7769
02:14:31,350 --> 02:14:31,360
injecting something into you and maybe
 

7770
02:14:31,360 --> 02:14:32,390
injecting something into you and maybe
you're right

7771
02:14:32,390 --> 02:14:32,400
you're right
 

7772
02:14:32,400 --> 02:14:34,069
you're right
that the rhetoric is like you better

7773
02:14:34,069 --> 02:14:34,079
that the rhetoric is like you better
 

7774
02:14:34,079 --> 02:14:36,470
that the rhetoric is like you better
take this or you're or you're dumb

7775
02:14:36,470 --> 02:14:36,480
take this or you're or you're dumb
 

7776
02:14:36,480 --> 02:14:38,310
take this or you're or you're dumb
you know it's not the right approach

7777
02:14:38,310 --> 02:14:38,320
you know it's not the right approach
 

7778
02:14:38,320 --> 02:14:39,750
you know it's not the right approach
i've seen actually it's kind of

7779
02:14:39,750 --> 02:14:39,760
i've seen actually it's kind of
 

7780
02:14:39,760 --> 02:14:41,430
i've seen actually it's kind of
interesting i think both sides kind of

7781
02:14:41,430 --> 02:14:41,440
interesting i think both sides kind of
 

7782
02:14:41,440 --> 02:14:42,950
interesting i think both sides kind of
imply that

7783
02:14:42,950 --> 02:14:42,960
imply that
 

7784
02:14:42,960 --> 02:14:45,030
imply that
so the

7785
02:14:45,030 --> 02:14:45,040
so the
 

7786
02:14:45,040 --> 02:14:48,870
so the
the people who are against the vaccine

7787
02:14:48,870 --> 02:14:48,880
the people who are against the vaccine
 

7788
02:14:48,880 --> 02:14:52,310
the people who are against the vaccine
are dumb for not trusting science

7789
02:14:52,310 --> 02:14:52,320
are dumb for not trusting science
 

7790
02:14:52,320 --> 02:14:55,669
are dumb for not trusting science
and the people who are for the vaccine

7791
02:14:55,669 --> 02:14:55,679
and the people who are for the vaccine
 

7792
02:14:55,679 --> 02:14:57,589
and the people who are for the vaccine
are called dumb

7793
02:14:57,589 --> 02:14:57,599
are called dumb
 

7794
02:14:57,599 --> 02:14:59,990
are called dumb
for trusting science the scientific

7795
02:14:59,990 --> 02:15:00,000
for trusting science the scientific
 

7796
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:01,750
for trusting science the scientific
nobody wins yeah

7797
02:15:01,750 --> 02:15:01,760
nobody wins yeah
 

7798
02:15:01,760 --> 02:15:05,270
nobody wins yeah
and they both kind of have a point

7799
02:15:05,270 --> 02:15:05,280
and they both kind of have a point
 

7800
02:15:05,280 --> 02:15:07,830
and they both kind of have a point
like because because you can always it's

7801
02:15:07,830 --> 02:15:07,840
like because because you can always it's
 

7802
02:15:07,840 --> 02:15:10,229
like because because you can always it's
like a glass half full or half empty

7803
02:15:10,229 --> 02:15:10,239
like a glass half full or half empty
 

7804
02:15:10,239 --> 02:15:13,830
like a glass half full or half empty
because you can always look at um

7805
02:15:13,830 --> 02:15:13,840
because you can always look at um
 

7806
02:15:13,840 --> 02:15:16,950
because you can always look at um
like science from a perspective of

7807
02:15:16,950 --> 02:15:16,960
like science from a perspective of
 

7808
02:15:16,960 --> 02:15:19,990
like science from a perspective of
certain individuals that don't represent

7809
02:15:19,990 --> 02:15:20,000
certain individuals that don't represent
 

7810
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,950
certain individuals that don't represent
uh perhaps not greatest leaders

7811
02:15:22,950 --> 02:15:22,960
uh perhaps not greatest leaders
 

7812
02:15:22,960 --> 02:15:25,430
uh perhaps not greatest leaders
uh almost like political leaders there's

7813
02:15:25,430 --> 02:15:25,440
uh almost like political leaders there's
 

7814
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:27,589
uh almost like political leaders there's
a lot of you know i've

7815
02:15:27,589 --> 02:15:27,599
a lot of you know i've
 

7816
02:15:27,599 --> 02:15:30,709
a lot of you know i've
yesterday went on a whole rant um

7817
02:15:30,709 --> 02:15:30,719
yesterday went on a whole rant um
 

7818
02:15:30,719 --> 02:15:32,790
yesterday went on a whole rant um
against i said a lot of positive things

7819
02:15:32,790 --> 02:15:32,800
against i said a lot of positive things
 

7820
02:15:32,800 --> 02:15:34,790
against i said a lot of positive things
about anthony fauci before i went on a

7821
02:15:34,790 --> 02:15:34,800
about anthony fauci before i went on a
 

7822
02:15:34,800 --> 02:15:36,870
about anthony fauci before i went on a
rant i guess

7823
02:15:36,870 --> 02:15:36,880
rant i guess
 

7824
02:15:36,880 --> 02:15:39,510
rant i guess
uh because ultimately

7825
02:15:39,510 --> 02:15:39,520
uh because ultimately
 

7826
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:41,910
uh because ultimately
you know i think he failed as a leader

7827
02:15:41,910 --> 02:15:41,920
you know i think he failed as a leader
 

7828
02:15:41,920 --> 02:15:43,750
you know i think he failed as a leader
and i know it's very difficult to be a

7829
02:15:43,750 --> 02:15:43,760
and i know it's very difficult to be a
 

7830
02:15:43,760 --> 02:15:45,350
and i know it's very difficult to be a
leader but i still wanted to hold him

7831
02:15:45,350 --> 02:15:45,360
leader but i still wanted to hold him
 

7832
02:15:45,360 --> 02:15:47,189
leader but i still wanted to hold him
accountable for that

7833
02:15:47,189 --> 02:15:47,199
accountable for that
 

7834
02:15:47,199 --> 02:15:49,350
accountable for that
as a great communicator of science and

7835
02:15:49,350 --> 02:15:49,360
as a great communicator of science and
 

7836
02:15:49,360 --> 02:15:51,270
as a great communicator of science and
as a great leader what what do you think

7837
02:15:51,270 --> 02:15:51,280
as a great leader what what do you think
 

7838
02:15:51,280 --> 02:15:55,030
as a great leader what what do you think
he didn't do right i'm curious

7839
02:15:55,030 --> 02:15:55,040

 

7840
02:15:55,040 --> 02:15:57,189

so

7841
02:15:57,189 --> 02:15:57,199
so
 

7842
02:15:57,199 --> 02:15:59,350
so
the core of the problem

7843
02:15:59,350 --> 02:15:59,360
the core of the problem
 

7844
02:15:59,360 --> 02:16:01,350
the core of the problem
is

7845
02:16:01,350 --> 02:16:01,360
is
 

7846
02:16:01,360 --> 02:16:02,790
is
the

7847
02:16:02,790 --> 02:16:02,800
the
 

7848
02:16:02,800 --> 02:16:04,550
the
several characteristics of the way he

7849
02:16:04,550 --> 02:16:04,560
several characteristics of the way he
 

7850
02:16:04,560 --> 02:16:06,950
several characteristics of the way he
was communicating to the public so one

7851
02:16:06,950 --> 02:16:06,960
was communicating to the public so one
 

7852
02:16:06,960 --> 02:16:09,510
was communicating to the public so one
is the general inauthenticity

7853
02:16:09,510 --> 02:16:09,520
is the general inauthenticity
 

7854
02:16:09,520 --> 02:16:10,310
is the general inauthenticity
uh

7855
02:16:10,310 --> 02:16:10,320
uh
 

7856
02:16:10,320 --> 02:16:12,790
uh
two is a thing that

7857
02:16:12,790 --> 02:16:12,800
two is a thing that
 

7858

you're
 

7882
02:16:39,359 --> 02:16:41,750
you're
trying to hide so that's a way of

7883
02:16:41,750 --> 02:16:41,760
trying to hide so that's a way of
 

7884
02:16:41,760 --> 02:16:43,910
trying to hide so that's a way of
communicating that i think the internet

7885
02:16:43,910 --> 02:16:43,920
communicating that i think the internet
 

7886
02:16:43,920 --> 02:16:45,669
communicating that i think the internet
and people in general are becoming much

7887
02:16:45,669 --> 02:16:45,679
and people in general are becoming much
 

7888
02:16:45,679 --> 02:16:47,270
and people in general are becoming much
better at detecting it's like you said

7889
02:16:47,270 --> 02:16:47,280
better at detecting it's like you said
 

7890
02:16:47,280 --> 02:16:49,429
better at detecting it's like you said
they're good bs detectives yeah good bs

7891
02:16:49,429 --> 02:16:49,439
they're good bs detectives yeah good bs
 

7892
02:16:49,439 --> 02:16:51,429
they're good bs detectives yeah good bs
detectors uh then

7893
02:16:51,429 --> 02:16:51,439
detectors uh then
 

7894
02:16:51,439 --> 02:16:53,669
detectors uh then
but contributing to that is speaking

7895
02:16:53,669 --> 02:16:53,679
but contributing to that is speaking
 

7896
02:16:53,679 --> 02:16:55,669
but contributing to that is speaking
from authority

7897
02:16:55,669 --> 02:16:55,679
from authority
 

7898
02:16:55,679 --> 02:17:00,230
from authority
speaking um with with uh with authority

7899
02:17:00,230 --> 02:17:00,240
speaking um with with uh with authority
 

7900
02:17:00,240 --> 02:17:02,469
speaking um with with uh with authority
and confidence where

7901
02:17:02,469 --> 02:17:02,479
and confidence where
 

7902
02:17:02,479 --> 02:17:04,469
and confidence where
neither is deserved

7903
02:17:04,469 --> 02:17:04,479
neither is deserved
 

7904
02:17:04,479 --> 02:17:05,349
neither is deserved
so

7905
02:17:05,349 --> 02:17:05,359
so
 

7906
02:17:05,359 --> 02:17:08,230
so
first of all nobody's an authority on on

7907
02:17:08,230 --> 02:17:08,240
first of all nobody's an authority on on
 

7908
02:17:08,240 --> 02:17:11,030
first of all nobody's an authority on on
this new virus right we're facing a

7909
02:17:11,030 --> 02:17:11,040
this new virus right we're facing a
 

7910
02:17:11,040 --> 02:17:13,429
this new virus right we're facing a
deadly pandemic and threatens especially

7911
02:17:13,429 --> 02:17:13,439
deadly pandemic and threatens especially
 

7912
02:17:13,439 --> 02:17:14,230

02:17:14,230 --> 02:17:14,240
in
 

7914
02:17:14,240 --> 02:17:16,070
in
the early stages it was unclear how

7915
02:17:16,070 --> 02:17:16,080
the early stages it was unclear how
 

7916
02:17:16,080 --> 02:17:17,429
the early stages it was unclear how
deadly it would be

7917
02:17:17,429 --> 02:17:17,439
deadly it would be
 

7918
02:17:17,439 --> 02:17:19,669
deadly it would be
it was unclear probably still unclear

7919
02:17:19,669 --> 02:17:19,679
it was unclear probably still unclear
 

7920

uh happen what the epidemiology that's
happening what is the uncertainty around

uh i you know personally believe there
 

7968
02:18:10,960 --> 02:18:12,549
uh i you know personally believe there
should have been much more openness

7969
02:18:12,549 --> 02:18:12,559
should have been much more openness
 

7970
02:18:12,559 --> 02:18:15,110
should have been much more openness
about the the origins of the virus

7971

is actually the way
 

7980
02:18:23,599 --> 02:18:25,669
is actually the way
to get people to trust you that you're

legitimately open to ideas that are very
 

7984
02:18:28,639 --> 02:18:30,389
legitimately open to ideas that are very
unpleasant that go against the

showing that openness is going to get
 

7990
02:18:34,800 --> 02:18:37,669
showing that openness is going to get
people to trust you when you finally

7991
02:18:37,669 --> 02:18:37,679
people to trust you when you finally
 

7992
02:18:37,679 --> 02:18:39,910
people to trust you when you finally
decrease the variance in your

7993
02:18:39,910 --> 02:18:39,920
decrease the variance in your
 

7994
02:18:39,920 --> 02:18:42,150
decrease the variance in your
uncertainty like decrease uncertainty

7995
02:18:42,150 --> 02:18:42,160
uncertainty like decrease uncertainty
 

7996
02:18:42,160 --> 02:18:43,830
uncertainty like decrease uncertainty
and have we still have a lot of

7997
02:18:43,830 --> 02:18:43,840
and have we still have a lot of
 

7998
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:45,509
and have we still have a lot of
uncertainty but this is the best course

7999
02:18:45,509 --> 02:18:45,519
uncertainty but this is the best course
 

8000
02:18:45,519 --> 02:18:47,830
uncertainty but this is the best course
of action vaccines still have a lot of

8001
02:18:47,830 --> 02:18:47,840
of action vaccines still have a lot of
 

8002
02:18:47,840 --> 02:18:50,469
of action vaccines still have a lot of
uncertainty around them mrna is a new

8003
02:18:50,469 --> 02:18:50,479
uncertainty around them mrna is a new
 

8004
02:18:50,479 --> 02:18:52,549
uncertainty around them mrna is a new
technology but we have increasing

8005
02:18:52,549 --> 02:18:52,559
technology but we have increasing
 

8006
02:18:52,559 --> 02:18:54,150
technology but we have increasing
amounts of data and here's the data

8007
02:18:54,150 --> 02:18:54,160
amounts of data and here's the data
 

8008
02:18:54,160 --> 02:18:56,870
amounts of data and here's the data
sources and like laying them out in a

8009
02:18:56,870 --> 02:18:56,880
sources and like laying them out in a
 

8010
02:18:56,880 --> 02:18:58,629
sources and like laying them out in a
very clear way

8011
02:18:58,629 --> 02:18:58,639
very clear way
 

8012
02:18:58,639 --> 02:19:00,549
very clear way
of this is the best course of action

8013
02:19:00,549 --> 02:19:00,559
of this is the best course of action
 

8014
02:19:00,559 --> 02:19:02,309
of this is the best course of action
that we have now we don't know if it's

8015
02:19:02,309 --> 02:19:02,319
that we have now we don't know if it's
 

8016
02:19:02,319 --> 02:19:04,870
that we have now we don't know if it's
the perfect course of action but it's by

8017
02:19:04,870 --> 02:19:04,880
the perfect course of action but it's by
 

8018
02:19:04,880 --> 02:19:07,030
the perfect course of action but it's by
far the best course of action and that

8019
02:19:07,030 --> 02:19:07,040
far the best course of action and that
 

8020
02:19:07,040 --> 02:19:09,669
far the best course of action and that
would that would come from a leader that

8021

1918 flew right but that's mainly

8029
02:19:20,549 --> 02:19:20,559
1918 flew right but that's mainly
 

8030
02:19:20,559 --> 02:19:22,549
1918 flew right but that's mainly
because we didn't know what to do we

8031
02:19:22,549 --> 02:19:22,559
because we didn't know what to do we
 

8032
02:19:22,559 --> 02:19:24,309
because we didn't know what to do we
didn't have many tools at our disposal

8033
02:19:24,309 --> 02:19:24,319
didn't have many tools at our disposal
 

8034
02:19:24,319 --> 02:19:26,389
didn't have many tools at our disposal
and that was tied up with world war one

8035
02:19:26,389 --> 02:19:26,399
and that was tied up with world war one
 

8036
02:19:26,399 --> 02:19:28,629
and that was tied up with world war one
that's right that's right so the the

8037
02:19:28,629 --> 02:19:28,639
that's right that's right so the the
 

8038
02:19:28,639 --> 02:19:30,709
that's right that's right so the the
leadership there i mean but i don't know

them it's a lot right
 

8046
02:19:37,439 --> 02:19:40,389
them it's a lot right
but that logic we don't apply that logic

8047
02:19:40,389 --> 02:19:40,399
but that logic we don't apply that logic
 

8048
02:19:40,399 --> 02:19:41,669
but that logic we don't apply that logic
generally

8049
02:19:41,669 --> 02:19:41,679
generally
 

8050
02:19:41,679 --> 02:19:42,870

8132
02:21:02,319 --> 02:21:04,150
they're not necessarily related to
deaths they're related to suffering

all there's all these questions and and
 

8142
02:21:13,280 --> 02:21:15,110
all there's all these questions and and
the the fundamental question

8143
02:21:15,110 --> 02:21:15,120

our policies so the the this is the
 

8148
02:21:22,560 --> 02:21:24,389
our policies so the the this is the
when we turn our eye and care about this

8149
02:21:24,389 --> 02:21:24,399
when we turn our eye and care about this
 

8150

pain and so what does that lead to that
 

8180
02:21:57,280 --> 02:21:59,349
pain and so what does that lead to that
can lead to the

8181
02:21:59,349 --> 02:21:59,359
can lead to the
 

8182
02:21:59,359 --> 02:22:02,230
can lead to the
rising up of charismatic leaders that

8183

rising up of charismatic leaders that
 

8184

covid and then
 

8194
02:22:12,880 --> 02:22:16,150
covid and then
i mean uh very much my main opposition

fauci is not on the details but the
final result which is i just observe

02:22:23,030 --> 02:22:23,040
final result which is i just observe
 

8202
02:22:23,040 --> 02:22:25,110
final result which is i just observe
that there's a significant decrease in

that there's a significant decrease in
 

8204

of mechanisms of science i think
 

8212
02:22:32,960 --> 02:22:35,750
of mechanisms of science i think
sciences is both beautiful and powerful

8213
02:22:35,750 --> 02:22:35,760
sciences is both beautiful and powerful
 

8214
02:22:35,760 --> 02:22:37,270
sciences is both beautiful and powerful
and the reason why we have so many

8215
02:22:37,270 --> 02:22:37,280
and the reason why we have so many
 

8216
02:22:37,280 --> 02:22:39,110
and the reason why we have so many
amazing things and such a high quality

continue getting out of the troubles
we're in is science the scientific

02:22:50,150 --> 02:22:50,160
we're in is science the scientific
 

8232
02:22:50,160 --> 02:22:53,190
we're in is science the scientific
process broadly defined like innovation

gets in
who uh causes a distrust in science to

of having caused of that kind of level
 

8268
02:23:26,560 --> 02:23:28,630
of having caused of that kind of level
of mistrust now it may be unfair to

of mistrust now it may be unfair to
 

8270
02:23:28,640 --> 02:23:31,030
of mistrust now it may be unfair to
place it on any one individual but you

02:23:43,590 --> 02:23:43,600
if it's not directly his fault
 

8282
02:23:43,600 --> 02:23:46,870
if it's not directly his fault
you know he has to carry uh uh carry the

8283
02:23:46,870 --> 02:23:46,880
you know he has to carry uh uh carry the
 

8284
02:23:46,880 --> 02:23:48,230
you know he has to carry uh uh carry the
price of that

8285
02:23:48,230 --> 02:23:48,240
price of that
 

8286
02:23:48,240 --> 02:23:50,070
price of that
do you think we should

8287
02:23:50,070 --> 02:23:50,080
do you think we should
 

8288
02:23:50,080 --> 02:23:53,510
do you think we should
at this point say okay we have vaccines

8289
02:23:53,510 --> 02:23:53,520
at this point say okay we have vaccines
 

8290
02:23:53,520 --> 02:23:55,110
at this point say okay we have vaccines
you can decide whether you take them or

8291
02:23:55,110 --> 02:23:55,120
you can decide whether you take them or
 

8292
02:23:55,120 --> 02:23:57,429
you can decide whether you take them or
not let's move forward

8293
02:23:57,429 --> 02:23:57,439
not let's move forward
 

8294
02:23:57,439 --> 02:23:59,110
not let's move forward
maybe you can help me understand this

8295
02:23:59,110 --> 02:23:59,120
maybe you can help me understand this
 

8296
02:23:59,120 --> 02:24:02,230
maybe you can help me understand this
because it seems like

8297
02:24:02,230 --> 02:24:02,240
because it seems like
 

8298
02:24:02,240 --> 02:24:04,550
because it seems like
why is that not the right solution

8299
02:24:04,550 --> 02:24:04,560
why is that not the right solution
 

8300
02:24:04,560 --> 02:24:07,190
why is that not the right solution
completely open society the vaccines at

8301
02:24:07,190 --> 02:24:07,200
completely open society the vaccines at
 

8302
02:24:07,200 --> 02:24:10,070
completely open society the vaccines at
least in the in the united states as i

8303
02:24:10,070 --> 02:24:10,080
least in the in the united states as i
 

8304
02:24:10,080 --> 02:24:11,190
least in the in the united states as i
understand

8305
02:24:11,190 --> 02:24:11,200
understand
 

8306
02:24:11,200 --> 02:24:12,230
understand
are

8307
02:24:12,230 --> 02:24:12,240
are
 

8308
02:24:12,240 --> 02:24:14,150
are
widely available

8309
02:24:14,150 --> 02:24:14,160
widely available
 

8310
02:24:14,160 --> 02:24:15,510
widely available
so

8311
02:24:15,510 --> 02:24:15,520
so
 

8312
02:24:15,520 --> 02:24:17,110
so
this is the american way you have the

8313
02:24:17,110 --> 02:24:17,120
this is the american way you have the
 

8314
02:24:17,120 --> 02:24:19,990
this is the american way you have the
decision to make if you have

8315
02:24:19,990 --> 02:24:20,000
decision to make if you have
 

8316
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,550
decision to make if you have
uh conditions that make you worried to

8317
02:24:22,550 --> 02:24:22,560
uh conditions that make you worried to
 

8318
02:24:22,560 --> 02:24:24,870
uh conditions that make you worried to
get coveted and go to the hospital then

8319
02:24:24,870 --> 02:24:24,880
get coveted and go to the hospital then
 

8320
02:24:24,880 --> 02:24:26,710
get coveted and go to the hospital then
you should get vaccinated because here's

8321
02:24:26,710 --> 02:24:26,720
you should get vaccinated because here's
 

8322
02:24:26,720 --> 02:24:29,429
you should get vaccinated because here's
the data that shows that it's much less

8323
02:24:29,429 --> 02:24:29,439
the data that shows that it's much less
 

8324
02:24:29,439 --> 02:24:31,110
the data that shows that it's much less
likely for you to die

8325
02:24:31,110 --> 02:24:31,120
likely for you to die
 

8326
02:24:31,120 --> 02:24:34,469
likely for you to die
uh right if if you get vaccinated if you

8327
02:24:34,469 --> 02:24:34,479
uh right if if you get vaccinated if you
 

8328
02:24:34,479 --> 02:24:36,070
uh right if if you get vaccinated if you
don't want to get vaccinated because

8329
02:24:36,070 --> 02:24:36,080
don't want to get vaccinated because
 

8330
02:24:36,080 --> 02:24:38,309
don't want to get vaccinated because
you're worried about a long-term effects

8331
02:24:38,309 --> 02:24:38,319
you're worried about a long-term effects
 

8332
02:24:38,319 --> 02:24:40,309
you're worried about a long-term effects
of vaccine that you don't have to but

8333
02:24:40,309 --> 02:24:40,319
of vaccine that you don't have to but
 

8334
02:24:40,319 --> 02:24:42,230
of vaccine that you don't have to but
then you suffered the consequences of

8335
02:24:42,230 --> 02:24:42,240
then you suffered the consequences of
 

8336
02:24:42,240 --> 02:24:43,030
then you suffered the consequences of
that

8337
02:24:43,030 --> 02:24:43,040
that
 

8338
02:24:43,040 --> 02:24:44,389
that
and that's it

8339
02:24:44,389 --> 02:24:44,399
and that's it
 

8340
02:24:44,399 --> 02:24:46,790
and that's it
so i here's what i think is driving

8341
02:24:46,790 --> 02:24:46,800
so i here's what i think is driving
 

8342
02:24:46,800 --> 02:24:49,349
so i here's what i think is driving
the i think it's all about kids

8343
02:24:49,349 --> 02:24:49,359
the i think it's all about kids
 

8344
02:24:49,359 --> 02:24:50,150
the i think it's all about kids
right

8345
02:24:50,150 --> 02:24:50,160
right
 

8346
02:24:50,160 --> 02:24:51,190
right
because they're going to go back to

8347
02:24:51,190 --> 02:24:51,200
because they're going to go back to
 

8348
02:24:51,200 --> 02:24:52,389
because they're going to go back to
school in the fool and many of them

8349
02:24:52,389 --> 02:24:52,399
school in the fool and many of them
 

8350
02:24:52,399 --> 02:24:55,670
school in the fool and many of them
can't be vaccinated right so

8351
02:24:55,670 --> 02:24:55,680
can't be vaccinated right so
 

8352
02:24:55,680 --> 02:24:58,469
can't be vaccinated right so
if they get infected they do have less

8353
02:24:58,469 --> 02:24:58,479
if they get infected they do have less
 

8354
02:24:58,479 --> 02:25:01,110
if they get infected they do have less
frequency of disease but it's not zero

8355
02:25:01,110 --> 02:25:01,120
frequency of disease but it's not zero
 

8356
02:25:01,120 --> 02:25:02,550
frequency of disease but it's not zero
they do get sick and they can have

8357
02:25:02,550 --> 02:25:02,560
they do get sick and they can have
 

8358
02:25:02,560 --> 02:25:03,750
they do get sick and they can have
long-term

8359
02:25:03,750 --> 02:25:03,760
long-term
 

8360
02:25:03,760 --> 02:25:05,830
long-term
consequences and

8361
02:25:05,830 --> 02:25:05,840
consequences and
 

8362
02:25:05,840 --> 02:25:08,389
consequences and
at that age it would be

8363
02:25:08,389 --> 02:25:08,399
at that age it would be
 

8364
02:25:08,399 --> 02:25:10,469
at that age it would be
a shame right and not even their choice

8365
02:25:10,469 --> 02:25:10,479
a shame right and not even their choice
 

8366
02:25:10,479 --> 02:25:12,230
a shame right and not even their choice
they can't decide

8367
02:25:12,230 --> 02:25:12,240
they can't decide
 

8368
02:25:12,240 --> 02:25:13,830
they can't decide
to get vaccinated or not because they

8369
02:25:13,830 --> 02:25:13,840
to get vaccinated or not because they
 

8370
02:25:13,840 --> 02:25:16,070
to get vaccinated or not because they
can't have access to it so i think that

8371
02:25:16,070 --> 02:25:16,080
can't have access to it so i think that
 

8372
02:25:16,080 --> 02:25:18,870
can't have access to it so i think that
would that's what would drive my

8373
02:25:18,870 --> 02:25:18,880
would that's what would drive my
 

8374
02:25:18,880 --> 02:25:20,469
would that's what would drive my
efforts to try and get more people at

8375
02:25:20,469 --> 02:25:20,479
efforts to try and get more people at
 

8376
02:25:20,479 --> 02:25:23,190
efforts to try and get more people at
least in schools vaccinated but i might

8377
02:25:23,190 --> 02:25:23,200
least in schools vaccinated but i might
 

8378
02:25:23,200 --> 02:25:25,110
least in schools vaccinated but i might
be wrong it may not be that so can you

8379
02:25:25,110 --> 02:25:25,120
be wrong it may not be that so can you
 

8380
02:25:25,120 --> 02:25:26,710
be wrong it may not be that so can you
kind of dig into that a little bit so

8381
02:25:26,710 --> 02:25:26,720
kind of dig into that a little bit so
 

8382
02:25:26,720 --> 02:25:30,870
kind of dig into that a little bit so
there's um

8383
02:25:30,870 --> 02:25:30,880

 

8384
02:25:30,880 --> 02:25:32,469

see you're saying that there should be

8385
02:25:32,469 --> 02:25:32,479
see you're saying that there should be
 

8386
02:25:32,479 --> 02:25:35,110
see you're saying that there should be
an effort for increased vaccinations

8387
02:25:35,110 --> 02:25:35,120
an effort for increased vaccinations
 

8388
02:25:35,120 --> 02:25:38,790
an effort for increased vaccinations
of of kids going to school just not for

8389
02:25:38,790 --> 02:25:38,800
of of kids going to school just not for
 

8390
02:25:38,800 --> 02:25:40,630
of of kids going to school just not for
societal benefit but for the benefit of

8391
02:25:40,630 --> 02:25:40,640
societal benefit but for the benefit of
 

8392
02:25:40,640 --> 02:25:42,950
societal benefit but for the benefit of
each individual kid right so right now

8393
02:25:42,950 --> 02:25:42,960
each individual kid right so right now
 

8394
02:25:42,960 --> 02:25:45,190
each individual kid right so right now
kids under

8395
02:25:45,190 --> 02:25:45,200
kids under
 

8396
02:25:45,200 --> 02:25:47,510
kids under
12 right you're not yet vaccinated is

8397
02:25:47,510 --> 02:25:47,520
12 right you're not yet vaccinated is
 

8398
02:25:47,520 --> 02:25:49,750
12 right you're not yet vaccinated is
that correct yeah i think so

8399
02:25:49,750 --> 02:25:49,760
that correct yeah i think so
 

8400
02:25:49,760 --> 02:25:51,750
that correct yeah i think so
and it's going to be it's not gonna

8401
02:25:51,750 --> 02:25:51,760
and it's going to be it's not gonna
 

8402
02:25:51,760 --> 02:25:53,590
and it's going to be it's not gonna
be in time for school opening that they

8403
02:25:53,590 --> 02:25:53,600
be in time for school opening that they
 

8404
02:25:53,600 --> 02:25:55,030
be in time for school opening that they
get vaccinated

8405
02:25:55,030 --> 02:25:55,040
get vaccinated
 

8406
02:25:55,040 --> 02:25:56,630
get vaccinated
um

8407
02:25:56,630 --> 02:25:56,640
um
 

8408
02:25:56,640 --> 02:25:58,150
um
and then

8409
02:25:58,150 --> 02:25:58,160
and then
 

8410
02:25:58,160 --> 02:25:59,910
and then
i mean i suppose the teachers are all

8411
02:25:59,910 --> 02:25:59,920
i mean i suppose the teachers are all
 

8412
02:25:59,920 --> 02:26:01,910
i mean i suppose the teachers are all
gonna be vaccinated it makes sense for

8413
02:26:01,910 --> 02:26:01,920
gonna be vaccinated it makes sense for
 

8414
02:26:01,920 --> 02:26:03,750
gonna be vaccinated it makes sense for
them to do that but i'm just worried the

8415
02:26:03,750 --> 02:26:03,760
them to do that but i'm just worried the
 

8416
02:26:03,760 --> 02:26:05,270
them to do that but i'm just worried the
kids are gonna be transmitting it

8417
02:26:05,270 --> 02:26:05,280
kids are gonna be transmitting it
 

8418
02:26:05,280 --> 02:26:07,429
kids are gonna be transmitting it
amongst them and many states don't allow

8419
02:26:07,429 --> 02:26:07,439
amongst them and many states don't allow
 

8420
02:26:07,439 --> 02:26:10,070
amongst them and many states don't allow
mass mandate in school so

8421
02:26:10,070 --> 02:26:10,080
mass mandate in school so
 

8422
02:26:10,080 --> 02:26:12,790
mass mandate in school so
i think that's what's driving the larger

8423
02:26:12,790 --> 02:26:12,800
i think that's what's driving the larger
 

8424
02:26:12,800 --> 02:26:13,990
i think that's what's driving the larger
narrative

8425
02:26:13,990 --> 02:26:14,000
narrative
 

8426
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,550
narrative
in the u.s to protect kids

8427
02:26:16,550 --> 02:26:16,560
in the u.s to protect kids
 

8428
02:26:16,560 --> 02:26:18,150
in the u.s to protect kids
it's kind of what i hear from daniel

8429
02:26:18,150 --> 02:26:18,160
it's kind of what i hear from daniel
 

8430
02:26:18,160 --> 02:26:19,670
it's kind of what i hear from daniel
griffin

8431
02:26:19,670 --> 02:26:19,680
griffin
 

8432
02:26:19,680 --> 02:26:21,670
griffin
because increasing numbers of kids are

8433
02:26:21,670 --> 02:26:21,680
because increasing numbers of kids are
 

8434
02:26:21,680 --> 02:26:24,230
because increasing numbers of kids are
being admitted to hospitals now because

8435
02:26:24,230 --> 02:26:24,240
being admitted to hospitals now because
 

8436
02:26:24,240 --> 02:26:25,590
being admitted to hospitals now because
they're the mid they're becoming the

8437
02:26:25,590 --> 02:26:25,600
they're the mid they're becoming the
 

8438
02:26:25,600 --> 02:26:27,590
they're the mid they're becoming the
major unvaccinated

8439
02:26:27,590 --> 02:26:27,600
major unvaccinated
 

8440
02:26:27,600 --> 02:26:29,190
major unvaccinated
population they're hanging out over the

8441
02:26:29,190 --> 02:26:29,200
population they're hanging out over the
 

8442
02:26:29,200 --> 02:26:30,550
population they're hanging out over the
summer and that's just going to get

8443
02:26:30,550 --> 02:26:30,560
summer and that's just going to get
 

8444
02:26:30,560 --> 02:26:32,230
summer and that's just going to get
worse in the fall

8445
02:26:32,230 --> 02:26:32,240
worse in the fall
 

8446
02:26:32,240 --> 02:26:34,550
worse in the fall
and so you could have a lot of kids with

8447
02:26:34,550 --> 02:26:34,560
and so you could have a lot of kids with
 

8448
02:26:34,560 --> 02:26:36,710
and so you could have a lot of kids with
long covered and disabled their entire

8449
02:26:36,710 --> 02:26:36,720
long covered and disabled their entire
 

8450
02:26:36,720 --> 02:26:38,230
long covered and disabled their entire
lives right so

8451
02:26:38,230 --> 02:26:38,240
lives right so
 

8452
02:26:38,240 --> 02:26:39,349
lives right so
and of course

8453
02:26:39,349 --> 02:26:39,359
and of course
 

8454
02:26:39,359 --> 02:26:41,270
and of course
hearing from people who are vaccine

8455
02:26:41,270 --> 02:26:41,280
hearing from people who are vaccine
 

8456
02:26:41,280 --> 02:26:43,830
hearing from people who are vaccine
hesitant i hear exactly the kids

8457
02:26:43,830 --> 02:26:43,840
hesitant i hear exactly the kids
 

8458
02:26:43,840 --> 02:26:46,389
hesitant i hear exactly the kids
statement but they're saying

8459
02:26:46,389 --> 02:26:46,399
statement but they're saying
 

8460
02:26:46,399 --> 02:26:48,870
statement but they're saying
they don't want the long

8461
02:26:48,870 --> 02:26:48,880
they don't want the long
 

8462
02:26:48,880 --> 02:26:50,389
they don't want the long
vaccine

8463
02:26:50,389 --> 02:26:50,399
vaccine
 

8464
02:26:50,399 --> 02:26:52,150
vaccine
the long-term effects of the vaccine to

8465
02:26:52,150 --> 02:26:52,160
the long-term effects of the vaccine to
 

8466
02:26:52,160 --> 02:26:54,790
the long-term effects of the vaccine to
affect the kids that's the of the co of

8467
02:26:54,790 --> 02:26:54,800
affect the kids that's the of the co of
 

8468
02:26:54,800 --> 02:26:57,429
affect the kids that's the of the co of
this new vegetable which i would say is

8469
02:26:57,429 --> 02:26:57,439
this new vegetable which i would say is
 

8470
02:26:57,439 --> 02:26:59,830
this new vegetable which i would say is
as i said before you can't say

8471
02:26:59,830 --> 02:26:59,840
as i said before you can't say
 

8472
02:26:59,840 --> 02:27:01,349
as i said before you can't say
never but

8473
02:27:01,349 --> 02:27:01,359
never but
 

8474
02:27:01,359 --> 02:27:04,070
never but
we do know that long

8475
02:27:04,070 --> 02:27:04,080
we do know that long
 

8476
02:27:04,080 --> 02:27:06,710
we do know that long
covid exists we don't know for how long

8477
02:27:06,710 --> 02:27:06,720
covid exists we don't know for how long
 

8478
02:27:06,720 --> 02:27:08,309
covid exists we don't know for how long
because we've only looked out six or

8479
02:27:08,309 --> 02:27:08,319
because we've only looked out six or
 

8480
02:27:08,319 --> 02:27:11,110
because we've only looked out six or
eight months we know that exists and the

8481
02:27:11,110 --> 02:27:11,120
eight months we know that exists and the
 

8482
02:27:11,120 --> 02:27:12,790
eight months we know that exists and the
frequency is increasing it certainly

8483
02:27:12,790 --> 02:27:12,800
frequency is increasing it certainly
 

8484
02:27:12,800 --> 02:27:15,030
frequency is increasing it certainly
exists in young kids and we have no idea

8485
02:27:15,030 --> 02:27:15,040
exists in young kids and we have no idea
 

8486
02:27:15,040 --> 02:27:17,429
exists in young kids and we have no idea
about long vaccine effects so i think

8487
02:27:17,429 --> 02:27:17,439
about long vaccine effects so i think
 

8488
02:27:17,439 --> 02:27:19,670
about long vaccine effects so i think
they have to make their decision

8489
02:27:19,670 --> 02:27:19,680
they have to make their decision
 

8490
02:27:19,680 --> 02:27:22,790
they have to make their decision
based on that

8491
02:27:22,790 --> 02:27:22,800

 

8492
02:27:22,800 --> 02:27:25,670

but yeah but your question is why don't

8493
02:27:25,670 --> 02:27:25,680
but yeah but your question is why don't
 

8494
02:27:25,680 --> 02:27:27,510
but yeah but your question is why don't
we just open up

8495
02:27:27,510 --> 02:27:27,520
we just open up
 

8496
02:27:27,520 --> 02:27:29,510
we just open up
society say here we have these vaccines

8497
02:27:29,510 --> 02:27:29,520
society say here we have these vaccines
 

8498
02:27:29,520 --> 02:27:31,030
society say here we have these vaccines
if you want to protect yourself i think

8499
02:27:31,030 --> 02:27:31,040
if you want to protect yourself i think
 

8500
02:27:31,040 --> 02:27:33,030
if you want to protect yourself i think
it's mainly the school that's driving

8501
02:27:33,030 --> 02:27:33,040

is thought to be a post-infectious
 

8576
02:28:52,640 --> 02:28:54,870
is thought to be a post-infectious
sequelae which has gone for many decades

now and many millions of people this
 

8580
02:28:56,560 --> 02:28:59,590
now and many millions of people this
could be another another one of those so

i'm just saying it
might be worth airing on the side of

8585

vaccinated but i do think
 

8600
02:29:20,560 --> 02:29:23,510
vaccinated but i do think
getting vaccinated is just um

8601
02:29:23,510 --> 02:29:23,520
getting vaccinated is just um
 

8602
02:29:23,520 --> 02:29:26,070
getting vaccinated is just um
the wiser choice if looking uh

8603
02:29:26,070 --> 02:29:26,080
the wiser choice if looking uh
 

8604
02:29:26,080 --> 02:29:28,309
the wiser choice if looking uh
all the different trajectories before us

8605
02:29:28,309 --> 02:29:28,319
all the different trajectories before us
 

8606
02:29:28,319 --> 02:29:31,190
all the different trajectories before us
getting vaccinated this um

8607
02:29:31,190 --> 02:29:31,200
getting vaccinated this um
 

8608
02:29:31,200 --> 02:29:32,309
getting vaccinated this um
seems like

8609
02:29:32,309 --> 02:29:32,319
seems like
 

8610
02:29:32,319 --> 02:29:34,230
seems like
from the data it seems like the obvious

8611
02:29:34,230 --> 02:29:34,240
from the data it seems like the obvious
 

8612
02:29:34,240 --> 02:29:36,550
from the data it seems like the obvious
choice frankly but i'm also trying to

8613
02:29:36,550 --> 02:29:36,560
choice frankly but i'm also trying to
 

8614
02:29:36,560 --> 02:29:37,990
choice frankly but i'm also trying to
keep an open mind

8615
02:29:37,990 --> 02:29:38,000
keep an open mind
 

8616
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:39,349
keep an open mind
because some things in the past that

8617
02:29:39,349 --> 02:29:39,359
because some things in the past that
 

8618
02:29:39,359 --> 02:29:40,790
because some things in the past that
seemed obvious would turn out to be

8619
02:29:40,790 --> 02:29:40,800
seemed obvious would turn out to be
 

8620
02:29:40,800 --> 02:29:41,990
seemed obvious would turn out to be
completely wrong

8621
02:29:41,990 --> 02:29:42,000
completely wrong
 

8622
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,710
completely wrong
so i'm trying to keep an open mind here

02:30:24,080 --> 02:30:26,389
i i just
i'm bothered by sensors there's a gray

8665
02:30:26,389 --> 02:30:26,399
i'm bothered by sensors there's a gray
 

8666
02:30:26,399 --> 02:30:27,750
i'm bothered by sensors there's a gray
area of course

8667
02:30:27,750 --> 02:30:27,760
area of course
 

8668
02:30:27,760 --> 02:30:28,710
area of course
um

8669
02:30:28,710 --> 02:30:28,720
um
 

8670
02:30:28,720 --> 02:30:29,910
um
but

8671
02:30:29,910 --> 02:30:29,920
but
 

8672
02:30:29,920 --> 02:30:31,429
but
i it just feels like that should not

8673
02:30:31,429 --> 02:30:31,439
i it just feels like that should not
 

8674
02:30:31,439 --> 02:30:33,190
i it just feels like that should not

8676
02:30:33,200 --> 02:30:35,510

discussions of vibramectin we can we can

8677
02:30:35,510 --> 02:30:35,520
discussions of vibramectin we can we can
 

8678
02:30:35,520 --> 02:30:37,990
discussions of vibramectin we can we can
set that aside the the other thing i was

8679
02:30:37,990 --> 02:30:38,000
set that aside the the other thing i was
 

8680
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:41,190
set that aside the the other thing i was
bothered by the lack of open-mindedness

8681
02:30:41,190 --> 02:30:41,200
bothered by the lack of open-mindedness
 

8682
02:30:41,200 --> 02:30:43,510
bothered by the lack of open-mindedness
mindedness on exploring things like

8683
02:30:43,510 --> 02:30:43,520
mindedness on exploring things like
 

8684
02:30:43,520 --> 02:30:44,870
mindedness on exploring things like
avermectin

8685
02:30:44,870 --> 02:30:44,880
avermectin
 

8686
02:30:44,880 --> 02:30:46,710
avermectin
in the early days

8687
02:30:46,710 --> 02:30:46,720
in the early days
 

8688
02:30:46,720 --> 02:30:49,110
in the early days
especially when at least i thought the

8689
02:30:49,110 --> 02:30:49,120
especially when at least i thought the
 

8690
02:30:49,120 --> 02:30:51,510
especially when at least i thought the
vaccine would take a long time

8691
02:30:51,510 --> 02:30:51,520
vaccine would take a long time
 

8692
02:30:51,520 --> 02:30:54,630
vaccine would take a long time
i mean it's not just ivermectin it's um

8693
02:30:54,630 --> 02:30:54,640
i mean it's not just ivermectin it's um
 

8694
02:30:54,640 --> 02:30:57,429
i mean it's not just ivermectin it's um
really seriously at a large scale

8695
02:30:57,429 --> 02:30:57,439
really seriously at a large scale
 

8696
02:30:57,439 --> 02:30:59,670
really seriously at a large scale
rigorously exploring the effectiveness

8697
02:30:59,670 --> 02:30:59,680
rigorously exploring the effectiveness
 

8698
02:30:59,680 --> 02:31:01,270
rigorously exploring the effectiveness
of masks

8699
02:31:01,270 --> 02:31:01,280
of masks
 

8700
02:31:01,280 --> 02:31:03,510
of masks
and the big one for me is testing

8701
02:31:03,510 --> 02:31:03,520
and the big one for me is testing
 

8702
02:31:03,520 --> 02:31:05,510
and the big one for me is testing
like the fact that that wasn't explored

8703
02:31:05,510 --> 02:31:05,520
like the fact that that wasn't explored
 

8704
02:31:05,520 --> 02:31:06,950
like the fact that that wasn't explored
aggressively

8705
02:31:06,950 --> 02:31:06,960
aggressively
 

8706
02:31:06,960 --> 02:31:09,110
aggressively
to lead to mass manufacturing like may

8707
02:31:09,110 --> 02:31:09,120
to lead to mass manufacturing like may
 

8708
02:31:09,120 --> 02:31:11,429
to lead to mass manufacturing like may
2020 is as absurd

8709
02:31:11,429 --> 02:31:11,439
2020 is as absurd
 

8710
02:31:11,439 --> 02:31:12,950
2020 is as absurd
anyway

8711
02:31:12,950 --> 02:31:12,960
anyway
 

8712
02:31:12,960 --> 02:31:14,870
anyway
so i was bothered by these solutions not

8713
02:31:14,870 --> 02:31:14,880
so i was bothered by these solutions not
 

8714
02:31:14,880 --> 02:31:17,190
so i was bothered by these solutions not
being explored and not by now having

8715
02:31:17,190 --> 02:31:17,200
being explored and not by now having
 

8716
02:31:17,200 --> 02:31:19,910
being explored and not by now having
really good ivermectin studies so can i

8717
02:31:19,910 --> 02:31:19,920
really good ivermectin studies so can i
 

8718
02:31:19,920 --> 02:31:21,190
really good ivermectin studies so can i
talk about ivory mechanics yeah i would

8719
02:31:21,190 --> 02:31:21,200
talk about ivory mechanics yeah i would
 

8720
02:31:21,200 --> 02:31:22,950
talk about ivory mechanics yeah i would
love that yeah sure so full disclosure

8721
02:31:22,950 --> 02:31:22,960
love that yeah sure so full disclosure
 

8722
02:31:22,960 --> 02:31:23,990
love that yeah sure so full disclosure
my wife

8723
02:31:23,990 --> 02:31:24,000
my wife
 

8724
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,070
my wife
worked on ivermectin at merck for 20

8725
02:31:26,070 --> 02:31:26,080
worked on ivermectin at merck for 20
 

8726
02:31:26,080 --> 02:31:27,590
worked on ivermectin at merck for 20
years

8727
02:31:27,590 --> 02:31:27,600
years
 

8728
02:31:27,600 --> 02:31:28,469
years
okay

8729
02:31:28,469 --> 02:31:28,479
okay
 

8730
02:31:28,479 --> 02:31:29,750
okay
so

8731
02:31:29,750 --> 02:31:29,760
so
 

8732
02:31:29,760 --> 02:31:31,349
so
they just want people to know but i

8733
02:31:31,349 --> 02:31:31,359
they just want people to know but i
 

8734
02:31:31,359 --> 02:31:32,389
they just want people to know but i
didn't

8735
02:31:32,389 --> 02:31:32,399
didn't
 

8736
02:31:32,399 --> 02:31:33,030
didn't
i

8737
02:31:33,030 --> 02:31:33,040
i
 

8738
02:31:33,040 --> 02:31:34,550
i
don't talk to her all the time about it

8739
02:31:34,550 --> 02:31:34,560
don't talk to her all the time about it
 

8740
02:31:34,560 --> 02:31:36,150
don't talk to her all the time about it
anyway she hasn't been at merc for a

8741
02:31:36,150 --> 02:31:36,160
anyway she hasn't been at merc for a
 

8742
02:31:36,160 --> 02:31:38,950
anyway she hasn't been at merc for a
long time as you know ivermectin is a

8743
02:31:38,950 --> 02:31:38,960
long time as you know ivermectin is a
 

8744
02:31:38,960 --> 02:31:40,950
long time as you know ivermectin is a
very safe drug used to treat certain

8745
02:31:40,950 --> 02:31:40,960
very safe drug used to treat certain
 

8746
02:31:40,960 --> 02:31:43,590
very safe drug used to treat certain
parasitic infections yes right

8747
02:31:43,590 --> 02:31:43,600
parasitic infections yes right
 

8748
02:31:43,600 --> 02:31:45,349
parasitic infections yes right
and

8749
02:31:45,349 --> 02:31:45,359
and
 

8750
02:31:45,359 --> 02:31:47,750
and
it is approved it's amazing you can take

8751
02:31:47,750 --> 02:31:47,760
it is approved it's amazing you can take
 

8752
02:31:47,760 --> 02:31:49,670
it is approved it's amazing you can take
one dose a year and be protected against

8753
02:31:49,670 --> 02:31:49,680
one dose a year and be protected against
 

8754
02:31:49,680 --> 02:31:51,910
one dose a year and be protected against
river blindness in africa and certain

8755
02:31:51,910 --> 02:31:51,920
river blindness in africa and certain
 

8756
02:31:51,920 --> 02:31:53,429
river blindness in africa and certain
parts of africa it's remarkably

8757
02:31:53,429 --> 02:31:53,439
parts of africa it's remarkably
 

8758
02:31:53,439 --> 02:31:54,550
parts of africa it's remarkably
effective

8759
02:31:54,550 --> 02:31:54,560
effective
 

8760
02:31:54,560 --> 02:31:58,070
effective
and so um it's quite a safe drug at the

8761
02:31:58,070 --> 02:31:58,080
and so um it's quite a safe drug at the
 

8762
02:31:58,080 --> 02:31:59,830
and so um it's quite a safe drug at the
doses that are

8763
02:31:59,830 --> 02:31:59,840
doses that are
 

8764
02:31:59,840 --> 02:32:01,190
doses that are
that are approved

8765
02:32:01,190 --> 02:32:01,200
that are approved
 

8766
02:32:01,200 --> 02:32:04,309
that are approved
now uh early last year a study was done

8767
02:32:04,309 --> 02:32:04,319
now uh early last year a study was done
 

8768
02:32:04,319 --> 02:32:05,990
now uh early last year a study was done
i believe in australia which showed in

8769
02:32:05,990 --> 02:32:06,000
i believe in australia which showed in
 

8770
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,790
i believe in australia which showed in
cells in the lab if you infect with

8771
02:32:08,790 --> 02:32:08,800
cells in the lab if you infect with
 

8772
02:32:08,800 --> 02:32:10,950
cells in the lab if you infect with
source cov2 and them and put ivermectin

8773
02:32:10,950 --> 02:32:10,960
source cov2 and them and put ivermectin
 

8774
02:32:10,960 --> 02:32:12,630
source cov2 and them and put ivermectin
and it would inhibit the virus

8775
02:32:12,630 --> 02:32:12,640
and it would inhibit the virus
 

8776
02:32:12,640 --> 02:32:14,309
and it would inhibit the virus
production substantially it was quite

8777
02:32:14,309 --> 02:32:14,319
production substantially it was quite
 

8778
02:32:14,319 --> 02:32:15,910
production substantially it was quite
clear right

8779
02:32:15,910 --> 02:32:15,920
clear right
 

8780
02:32:15,920 --> 02:32:18,630
clear right
but the concentrations they were using

8781
02:32:18,630 --> 02:32:18,640
but the concentrations they were using
 

8782
02:32:18,640 --> 02:32:20,550
but the concentrations they were using
were rather high and

8783
02:32:20,550 --> 02:32:20,560
were rather high and
 

8784
02:32:20,560 --> 02:32:22,870
were rather high and
could not be achieved by

8785
02:32:22,870 --> 02:32:22,880
could not be achieved by
 

8786
02:32:22,880 --> 02:32:25,910
could not be achieved by
uh the the approved dosing so you would

8787
02:32:25,910 --> 02:32:25,920
uh the the approved dosing so you would
 

8788
02:32:25,920 --> 02:32:28,230
uh the the approved dosing so you would
need to do a dosing study to make sure

8789
02:32:28,230 --> 02:32:28,240
need to do a dosing study to make sure
 

8790
02:32:28,240 --> 02:32:30,469
need to do a dosing study to make sure
it's safe and the reason is that i have

8791
02:32:30,469 --> 02:32:30,479
it's safe and the reason is that i have
 

8792
02:32:30,479 --> 02:32:32,230
it's safe and the reason is that i have
a mechanic binds to receptors in your

8793
02:32:32,230 --> 02:32:32,240
a mechanic binds to receptors in your
 

8794
02:32:32,240 --> 02:32:34,469
a mechanic binds to receptors in your
brain and it can have high doses a lot

8795
02:32:34,469 --> 02:32:34,479
brain and it can have high doses a lot
 

8796
02:32:34,479 --> 02:32:36,630
brain and it can have high doses a lot
of some people take high doses

8797
02:32:36,630 --> 02:32:36,640
of some people take high doses
 

8798
02:32:36,640 --> 02:32:38,070
of some people take high doses
inappropriately and they have

8799
02:32:38,070 --> 02:32:38,080
inappropriately and they have
 

8800
02:32:38,080 --> 02:32:40,309
inappropriately and they have
neurological consequences so

8801
02:32:40,309 --> 02:32:40,319
neurological consequences so
 

8802
02:32:40,319 --> 02:32:42,550
neurological consequences so
if you needed 10 times more ivermectin

8803
02:32:42,550 --> 02:32:42,560
if you needed 10 times more ivermectin
 

8804
02:32:42,560 --> 02:32:44,550
if you needed 10 times more ivermectin
you'd have to make sure it would be safe

8805
02:32:44,550 --> 02:32:44,560
you'd have to make sure it would be safe
 

8806
02:32:44,560 --> 02:32:45,750
you'd have to make sure it would be safe
in people so this is a question of

8807
02:32:45,750 --> 02:32:45,760
in people so this is a question of
 

8808
02:32:45,760 --> 02:32:47,270
in people so this is a question of
safety too right

8809
02:32:47,270 --> 02:32:47,280
safety too right
 

8810
02:32:47,280 --> 02:32:49,030
safety too right
so

8811
02:32:49,030 --> 02:32:49,040
so
 

8812
02:32:49,040 --> 02:32:51,190
so
my i think it has always been the case

8813
02:32:51,190 --> 02:32:51,200
my i think it has always been the case
 

8814
02:32:51,200 --> 02:32:52,870
my i think it has always been the case
that it should have been properly

8815
02:32:52,870 --> 02:32:52,880
that it should have been properly
 

8816
02:32:52,880 --> 02:32:53,910
that it should have been properly
studied

8817
02:32:53,910 --> 02:32:53,920
studied
 

8818
02:32:53,920 --> 02:32:55,510
studied
but it wasn't there are lots of trials

8819
02:32:55,510 --> 02:32:55,520
but it wasn't there are lots of trials
 

8820
02:32:55,520 --> 02:32:57,590
but it wasn't there are lots of trials
here and there lots of improperly

8821
02:32:57,590 --> 02:32:57,600
here and there lots of improperly
 

8822
02:32:57,600 --> 02:32:59,429
here and there lots of improperly
controlled trials where someone would

8823
02:32:59,429 --> 02:32:59,439
controlled trials where someone would
 

8824
02:32:59,439 --> 02:33:01,110
controlled trials where someone would
just treat some patients and say hey

8825
02:33:01,110 --> 02:33:01,120
just treat some patients and say hey
 

8826
02:33:01,120 --> 02:33:02,870
just treat some patients and say hey
they all did fine but have no control

8827
02:33:02,870 --> 02:33:02,880
they all did fine but have no control
 

8828
02:33:02,880 --> 02:33:04,790
they all did fine but have no control
arm and there were some controlled

8829
02:33:04,790 --> 02:33:04,800
arm and there were some controlled
 

8830
02:33:04,800 --> 02:33:06,389
arm and there were some controlled
trials but they were very small

8831
02:33:06,389 --> 02:33:06,399
trials but they were very small
 

8832
02:33:06,399 --> 02:33:08,550
trials but they were very small
so right now

8833
02:33:08,550 --> 02:33:08,560
so right now
 

8834
02:33:08,560 --> 02:33:11,590
so right now
a four thousand person trial is unroll

8835

whether it works or not there's still

8841
02:33:18,150 --> 02:33:18,160
whether it works or not there's still
 

8842
02:33:18,160 --> 02:33:20,389
whether it works or not there's still
plenty of cases that you can do that so

8843
02:33:20,389 --> 02:33:20,399
plenty of cases that you can do that so
 

8844
02:33:20,399 --> 02:33:22,070
plenty of cases that you can do that so
you can ask whether in their whether

8845
02:33:22,070 --> 02:33:22,080
you can ask whether in their whether
 

8846
02:33:22,080 --> 02:33:23,190
you can ask whether in their whether
there are any side effects i think

8847
02:33:23,190 --> 02:33:23,200
there are any side effects i think
 

8848
02:33:23,200 --> 02:33:26,309
there are any side effects i think
that's completely fine and if it says

8849
02:33:26,309 --> 02:33:26,319
that's completely fine and if it says
 

8850
02:33:26,319 --> 02:33:28,630
that's completely fine and if it says
it works then we should use it in the

8851
02:33:28,630 --> 02:33:28,640
it works then we should use it in the
 

8852
02:33:28,640 --> 02:33:31,190
it works then we should use it in the
meantime i always tell people

think it should be tested for what you

8891
02:34:15,110 --> 02:34:15,120
think it should be tested for what you
 

8892
02:34:15,120 --> 02:34:17,510
think it should be tested for what you
want to use it for yeah and that's being

8893
02:34:17,510 --> 02:34:17,520
want to use it for yeah and that's being
 

8894
02:34:17,520 --> 02:34:19,510
want to use it for yeah and that's being
done and i think that's fine is it

8895
02:34:19,510 --> 02:34:19,520
done and i think that's fine is it
 

8896
02:34:19,520 --> 02:34:22,309
done and i think that's fine is it
strange to you that um

8897
02:34:22,309 --> 02:34:22,319
strange to you that um
 

8898
02:34:22,319 --> 02:34:24,710
strange to you that um

you know i can be a little bit

you know i can be a little bit
 

8914
02:34:34,680 --> 02:34:36,950
you know i can be a little bit
conspiratorial and this is what people

8915
02:34:36,950 --> 02:34:36,960
conspiratorial and this is what people
 

8916
02:34:36,960 --> 02:34:39,429
conspiratorial and this is what people
talk about with ivamectin yeah is with

8917
02:34:39,429 --> 02:34:39,439
talk about with ivamectin yeah is with
 

8918
02:34:39,439 --> 02:34:41,030
talk about with ivamectin yeah is with
the vaccines there's quite a lot of

8919
02:34:41,030 --> 02:34:41,040
the vaccines there's quite a lot of
 

8920
02:34:41,040 --> 02:34:42,950
the vaccines there's quite a lot of
money to be made

8921
02:34:42,950 --> 02:34:42,960
money to be made
 

8922
02:34:42,960 --> 02:34:44,550
money to be made
a with then there's not as much money to

8923
02:34:44,550 --> 02:34:44,560
a with then there's not as much money to
 

8924

8926
02:34:45,600 --> 02:34:48,790
be made
is is that too conspiratorial like why

8927
02:34:48,790 --> 02:34:48,800
is is that too conspiratorial like why
 

8928
02:34:48,800 --> 02:34:50,469
is is that too conspiratorial like why
didn't we try more solutions in the

8929
02:34:50,469 --> 02:34:50,479
didn't we try more solutions in the
 

8930
02:34:50,479 --> 02:34:51,429
didn't we try more solutions in the
beginning

8931
02:34:51,429 --> 02:34:51,439
beginning
 

8932
02:34:51,439 --> 02:34:53,349
beginning
well um

8933
02:34:53,349 --> 02:34:53,359
well um
 

8934
02:34:53,359 --> 02:34:55,190
well um
well all the money was put into vaccines

8935
02:34:55,190 --> 02:34:55,200
well all the money was put into vaccines
 

8936
02:34:55,200 --> 02:34:57,190
well all the money was put into vaccines
right very little was put into antivirus

8937
02:34:57,190 --> 02:34:57,200
right very little was put into antivirus
 

8938
02:34:57,200 --> 02:34:58,630
right very little was put into antivirus
because the mission decision was made at

8939
02:34:58,630 --> 02:34:58,640
because the mission decision was made at
 

8940
02:34:58,640 --> 02:35:00,630
because the mission decision was made at
a very high level probably involving dr

8941
02:35:00,630 --> 02:35:00,640
a very high level probably involving dr
 

8942
02:35:00,640 --> 02:35:03,349
a very high level probably involving dr
fauci yeah we're going to put 24 billion

8943
02:35:03,349 --> 02:35:03,359
fauci yeah we're going to put 24 billion
 

8944
02:35:03,359 --> 02:35:06,150
fauci yeah we're going to put 24 billion
into vaccines right yeah

8945
02:35:06,150 --> 02:35:06,160
into vaccines right yeah
 

8946
02:35:06,160 --> 02:35:07,910
into vaccines right yeah
and i think part of the reasoning is

8947
02:35:07,910 --> 02:35:07,920
and i think part of the reasoning is
 

8948
02:35:07,920 --> 02:35:09,910
and i think part of the reasoning is
they give you years worth of protection

8949
02:35:09,910 --> 02:35:09,920
they give you years worth of protection
 

8950
02:35:09,920 --> 02:35:11,590
they give you years worth of protection
whereas an antiviral works and you have

8951
02:35:11,590 --> 02:35:11,600
whereas an antiviral works and you have
 

8952
02:35:11,600 --> 02:35:13,990
whereas an antiviral works and you have
to keep dosing and so forth but

8953
02:35:13,990 --> 02:35:14,000
to keep dosing and so forth but
 

8954
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,309
to keep dosing and so forth but
vermectin is not trivial and that's i i

8955
02:35:16,309 --> 02:35:16,319
vermectin is not trivial and that's i i
 

8956
02:35:16,319 --> 02:35:18,309
vermectin is not trivial and that's i i
agree it should have been tested early

8957
02:35:18,309 --> 02:35:18,319
agree it should have been tested early
 

8958
02:35:18,319 --> 02:35:20,469
agree it should have been tested early
on but we had a really bad experience

8959
02:35:20,469 --> 02:35:20,479
on but we had a really bad experience
 

8960
02:35:20,479 --> 02:35:22,870
on but we had a really bad experience
with hydroxychloroquine which we can

8961
02:35:22,870 --> 02:35:22,880
with hydroxychloroquine which we can
 

8962
02:35:22,880 --> 02:35:25,270
with hydroxychloroquine which we can
talk about too um

8963
02:35:25,270 --> 02:35:25,280
talk about too um
 

8964
02:35:25,280 --> 02:35:28,710
talk about too um
ivermectin is very hard to synthesize

8965
02:35:28,710 --> 02:35:28,720
ivermectin is very hard to synthesize
 

8966
02:35:28,720 --> 02:35:29,830
ivermectin is very hard to synthesize
most

8967
02:35:29,830 --> 02:35:29,840
most
 

8968
02:35:29,840 --> 02:35:32,469
most
drugs you synthesize chemically you

8969
02:35:32,469 --> 02:35:32,479
drugs you synthesize chemically you
 

8970
02:35:32,479 --> 02:35:34,630
drugs you synthesize chemically you
devise a formulation in a synthesis and

8971
02:35:34,630 --> 02:35:34,640
devise a formulation in a synthesis and
 

8972
02:35:34,640 --> 02:35:35,990
devise a formulation in a synthesis and
they do it they scale it up and it's

8973
02:35:35,990 --> 02:35:36,000
they do it they scale it up and it's
 

8974
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,550
they do it they scale it up and it's
fine hypermectin is really hard and so

8975
02:35:38,550 --> 02:35:38,560
fine hypermectin is really hard and so
 

8976
02:35:38,560 --> 02:35:40,870
fine hypermectin is really hard and so
what they do instead is they take the

8977
02:35:40,870 --> 02:35:40,880
what they do instead is they take the
 

8978
02:35:40,880 --> 02:35:42,469
what they do instead is they take the
culture of the

8979
02:35:42,469 --> 02:35:42,479
culture of the
 

8980
02:35:42,479 --> 02:35:44,309
culture of the
bacterium that makes it and they grow it

8981
02:35:44,309 --> 02:35:44,319
bacterium that makes it and they grow it
 

8982
02:35:44,319 --> 02:35:45,750
bacterium that makes it and they grow it
up and they ferment it and then they

8983
02:35:45,750 --> 02:35:45,760
up and they ferment it and then they
 

8984
02:35:45,760 --> 02:35:47,110
up and they ferment it and then they
purify it

8985
02:35:47,110 --> 02:35:47,120
purify it
 

8986
02:35:47,120 --> 02:35:48,950
purify it
and merck owns

8987
02:35:48,950 --> 02:35:48,960
and merck owns
 

8988
02:35:48,960 --> 02:35:51,270
and merck owns
the bacteria

8989
02:35:51,270 --> 02:35:51,280
the bacteria
 

8990
02:35:51,280 --> 02:35:54,230
the bacteria
a number of years ago two employees of

8991
02:35:54,230 --> 02:35:54,240
a number of years ago two employees of
 

8992
02:35:54,240 --> 02:35:57,030
a number of years ago two employees of
merck stole it and left the company

8993
02:35:57,030 --> 02:35:57,040
merck stole it and left the company
 

8994
02:35:57,040 --> 02:35:58,389
merck stole it and left the company
and tried to market and they were

8995
02:35:58,389 --> 02:35:58,399
and tried to market and they were
 

8996
02:35:58,399 --> 02:36:00,309
and tried to market and they were
arrested and they got put in jail so

8997
02:36:00,309 --> 02:36:00,319
arrested and they got put in jail so
 

8998
02:36:00,319 --> 02:36:02,710
arrested and they got put in jail so
they protect it very carefully

8999
02:36:02,710 --> 02:36:02,720
they protect it very carefully
 

9000
02:36:02,720 --> 02:36:03,670
they protect it very carefully
so

9001
02:36:03,670 --> 02:36:03,680
so
 

9002
02:36:03,680 --> 02:36:05,750
so
you can't just make it

9003
02:36:05,750 --> 02:36:05,760
you can't just make it
 

9004
02:36:05,760 --> 02:36:07,670
you can't just make it
if you do it's incredibly expensive and

9005
02:36:07,670 --> 02:36:07,680
if you do it's incredibly expensive and
 

9006
02:36:07,680 --> 02:36:10,070
if you do it's incredibly expensive and
now india it's very cheap apparently

9007
02:36:10,070 --> 02:36:10,080
now india it's very cheap apparently
 

9008
02:36:10,080 --> 02:36:12,630
now india it's very cheap apparently
they use it uh quite liberally there and

9009
02:36:12,630 --> 02:36:12,640
they use it uh quite liberally there and
 

9010
02:36:12,640 --> 02:36:14,230
they use it uh quite liberally there and
i don't know how they're they're making

9011
02:36:14,230 --> 02:36:14,240
i don't know how they're they're making
 

9012
02:36:14,240 --> 02:36:15,910
i don't know how they're they're making
it maybe they've licensed it from merc

9013
02:36:15,910 --> 02:36:15,920
it maybe they've licensed it from merc
 

9014
02:36:15,920 --> 02:36:18,309
it maybe they've licensed it from merc
and so forth but

9015
02:36:18,309 --> 02:36:18,319
and so forth but
 

9016
02:36:18,319 --> 02:36:20,710
and so forth but
that's why it hasn't been tested more

9017
02:36:20,710 --> 02:36:20,720
that's why it hasn't been tested more
 

9018
02:36:20,720 --> 02:36:22,710
that's why it hasn't been tested more
widely i think there's complexities in

9019
02:36:22,710 --> 02:36:22,720
widely i think there's complexities in
 

9020
02:36:22,720 --> 02:36:24,070
widely i think there's complexities in
terms of getting a lot of it and

9021
02:36:24,070 --> 02:36:24,080
terms of getting a lot of it and
 

9022
02:36:24,080 --> 02:36:26,710
terms of getting a lot of it and
manufacturing a lot of it yes okay so

9023
02:36:26,710 --> 02:36:26,720
manufacturing a lot of it yes okay so
 

9024
02:36:26,720 --> 02:36:28,309
manufacturing a lot of it yes okay so
what was the other the hydrocarbon

9025
02:36:28,309 --> 02:36:28,319
what was the other the hydrocarbon
 

9026
02:36:28,319 --> 02:36:31,190
what was the other the hydrocarbon
hydroxychloroquine was also shown

9027
02:36:31,190 --> 02:36:31,200
hydroxychloroquine was also shown
 

9028
02:36:31,200 --> 02:36:33,670
hydroxychloroquine was also shown
uh early on to inhibit virus in cell

9029
02:36:33,670 --> 02:36:33,680
uh early on to inhibit virus in cell
 

9030
02:36:33,680 --> 02:36:36,070
uh early on to inhibit virus in cell
culture

9031
02:36:36,070 --> 02:36:36,080
culture
 

9032
02:36:36,080 --> 02:36:37,190
culture
and that's not surprising

9033
02:36:37,190 --> 02:36:37,200
and that's not surprising
 

9034
02:36:37,200 --> 02:36:39,190
and that's not surprising
hydroxychloroquine of course

9035
02:36:39,190 --> 02:36:39,200
hydroxychloroquine of course
 

9036
02:36:39,200 --> 02:36:41,110
hydroxychloroquine of course
is used for malaria

9037
02:36:41,110 --> 02:36:41,120
is used for malaria
 

9038
02:36:41,120 --> 02:36:44,309
is used for malaria
and what it does

9039
02:36:44,309 --> 02:36:44,319

 

9040
02:36:44,319 --> 02:36:45,750

when you're when your cell takes up

9041
02:36:45,750 --> 02:36:45,760
when you're when your cell takes up
 

9042
02:36:45,760 --> 02:36:48,150
when you're when your cell takes up
things from the from the plasma membrane

9043
02:36:48,150 --> 02:36:48,160
things from the from the plasma membrane
 

9044
02:36:48,160 --> 02:36:50,150
things from the from the plasma membrane
including viruses it goes through a

9045
02:36:50,150 --> 02:36:50,160
including viruses it goes through a
 

9046
02:36:50,160 --> 02:36:51,990
including viruses it goes through a
pathway called the endocytic pathway

9047
02:36:51,990 --> 02:36:52,000
pathway called the endocytic pathway
 

9048
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:53,590
pathway called the endocytic pathway
which involves a vesicle moving through

9049
02:36:53,590 --> 02:36:53,600
which involves a vesicle moving through
 

9050
02:36:53,600 --> 02:36:54,710
which involves a vesicle moving through
the cell and as it moves through the

9051
02:36:54,710 --> 02:36:54,720
the cell and as it moves through the
 

9052
02:36:54,720 --> 02:36:57,429
the cell and as it moves through the
cell its ph drops

9053
02:36:57,429 --> 02:36:57,439
cell its ph drops
 

9054
02:36:57,439 --> 02:36:59,110
cell its ph drops
and that lets a lot of viruses out

9055
02:36:59,110 --> 02:36:59,120
and that lets a lot of viruses out
 

9056
02:36:59,120 --> 02:37:01,429
and that lets a lot of viruses out
actually and hydroxychloroquine blocks

9057
02:37:01,429 --> 02:37:01,439
actually and hydroxychloroquine blocks
 

9058
02:37:01,439 --> 02:37:03,110
actually and hydroxychloroquine blocks
that so it blocks infection with a lot

9059
02:37:03,110 --> 02:37:03,120
that so it blocks infection with a lot
 

9060
02:37:03,120 --> 02:37:06,230
that so it blocks infection with a lot
of viruses

9061
02:37:06,230 --> 02:37:06,240

 

9062
02:37:06,240 --> 02:37:08,550

so the problem with those early studies

9063
02:37:08,550 --> 02:37:08,560
so the problem with those early studies
 

9064
02:37:08,560 --> 02:37:09,990
so the problem with those early studies
that were published

9065
02:37:09,990 --> 02:37:10,000
that were published
 

9066
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,550
that were published
is that they were done in kidney cells

9067
02:37:12,550 --> 02:37:12,560
is that they were done in kidney cells
 

9068
02:37:12,560 --> 02:37:13,990
is that they were done in kidney cells
in culture

9069
02:37:13,990 --> 02:37:14,000
in culture
 

9070
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,150
in culture
where the only way the virus can get in

9071
02:37:16,150 --> 02:37:16,160
where the only way the virus can get in
 

9072
02:37:16,160 --> 02:37:18,630
where the only way the virus can get in
is through the endosome

9073
02:37:18,630 --> 02:37:18,640
is through the endosome
 

9074
02:37:18,640 --> 02:37:20,870
is through the endosome
and hydroxychloroquine inhibits that and

9075
02:37:20,870 --> 02:37:20,880
and hydroxychloroquine inhibits that and
 

9076
02:37:20,880 --> 02:37:22,710
and hydroxychloroquine inhibits that and
that's why it inhibits

9077
02:37:22,710 --> 02:37:22,720
that's why it inhibits
 

9078
02:37:22,720 --> 02:37:24,950
that's why it inhibits
in kidney cells and culture but lung

9079
02:37:24,950 --> 02:37:24,960
in kidney cells and culture but lung
 

9080
02:37:24,960 --> 02:37:26,070
in kidney cells and culture but lung

cells
and respiratory cells of humans where

9083
02:37:28,070 --> 02:37:28,080
and respiratory cells of humans where
 

9084
02:37:28,080 --> 02:37:29,990
and respiratory cells of humans where
the virus reproduces

9085
02:37:29,990 --> 02:37:30,000
the virus reproduces

02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:31,910
the virus reproduces
can get in two different ways it can get

9087
02:37:31,910 --> 02:37:31,920
can get in two different ways it can get
 

9088
02:37:31,920 --> 02:37:34,550
can get in two different ways it can get
in from this endocytic pathway

9089
02:37:34,550 --> 02:37:34,560
in from this endocytic pathway
 

9090
02:37:34,560 --> 02:37:37,750
in from this endocytic pathway
which is inhibited by hydroxychloroquine

9091
02:37:37,750 --> 02:37:37,760
which is inhibited by hydroxychloroquine
 

9092
02:37:37,760 --> 02:37:40,150
which is inhibited by hydroxychloroquine
or it can get in at the cell surface

9093
02:37:40,150 --> 02:37:40,160
or it can get in at the cell surface
 

9094
02:37:40,160 --> 02:37:42,030
or it can get in at the cell surface
which is not inhibited by

9095
02:37:42,030 --> 02:37:42,040
which is not inhibited by
 

9096
02:37:42,040 --> 02:37:43,750
which is not inhibited by
hydroxychloroquine so when you treat

9097
02:37:43,750 --> 02:37:43,760
hydroxychloroquine so when you treat
 

9098
02:37:43,760 --> 02:37:46,389
hydroxychloroquine so when you treat
patients it has no effect in the lung

9099
02:37:46,389 --> 02:37:46,399
patients it has no effect in the lung
 

9100
02:37:46,399 --> 02:37:47,750
patients it has no effect in the lung
because

9101
02:37:47,750 --> 02:37:47,760
because
 

9102
02:37:47,760 --> 02:37:49,990
because
the virus can just bypass it

9103
02:37:49,990 --> 02:37:50,000
the virus can just bypass it
 

9104
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:51,429
the virus can just bypass it
and all the

9105
02:37:51,429 --> 02:37:51,439
and all the
 

9106
02:37:51,439 --> 02:37:54,150
and all the
usage initially were based on

9107
02:37:54,150 --> 02:37:54,160
usage initially were based on
 

9108
02:37:54,160 --> 02:37:56,309
usage initially were based on
uh the the studies done in kidney cells

9109
02:37:56,309 --> 02:37:56,319
uh the the studies done in kidney cells
 

9110
02:37:56,319 --> 02:37:59,030
uh the the studies done in kidney cells
and culture so that that was just wrong

9111
02:37:59,030 --> 02:37:59,040
and culture so that that was just wrong
 

9112
02:37:59,040 --> 02:38:01,190
and culture so that that was just wrong
scientifically incorrect yet it drove a

9113
02:38:01,190 --> 02:38:01,200
scientifically incorrect yet it drove a
 

9114
02:38:01,200 --> 02:38:03,349
scientifically incorrect yet it drove a
lot of and today many people still think

9115
02:38:03,349 --> 02:38:03,359
lot of and today many people still think
 

9116
02:38:03,359 --> 02:38:06,790
lot of and today many people still think
they should be taking it but so like the

9117
02:38:06,790 --> 02:38:06,800
they should be taking it but so like the
 

9118
02:38:06,800 --> 02:38:09,270
they should be taking it but so like the
that not panning out kind of resulted in

9119
02:38:09,270 --> 02:38:09,280
that not panning out kind of resulted in
 

9120
02:38:09,280 --> 02:38:10,790
that not panning out kind of resulted in
a

9121
02:38:10,790 --> 02:38:10,800
a

02:38:13,030 --> 02:38:13,040
loss of optimism about other similar
 

9124
02:38:13,040 --> 02:38:15,510
loss of optimism about other similar
things well that and many other drugs

9125
02:38:15,510 --> 02:38:15,520
things well that and many other drugs
 

9126
02:38:15,520 --> 02:38:17,990
things well that and many other drugs
repurposed drugs were tried right a lot

9127
02:38:17,990 --> 02:38:18,000
repurposed drugs were tried right a lot
 

9128
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,870
repurposed drugs were tried right a lot
of hiv antivirals were tried i think the

9129
02:38:20,870 --> 02:38:20,880
of hiv antivirals were tried i think the
 

9130
02:38:20,880 --> 02:38:22,309
of hiv antivirals were tried i think the
problem with with hydrox i think

9131
02:38:22,309 --> 02:38:22,319
problem with with hydrox i think
 

9132
02:38:22,319 --> 02:38:24,070
problem with with hydrox i think
hydroxycork would influence the

9133
02:38:24,070 --> 02:38:24,080
hydroxycork would influence the
 

9134
02:38:24,080 --> 02:38:26,309
hydroxycork would influence the
ivermectin narrative right people

9135
02:38:26,309 --> 02:38:26,319
ivermectin narrative right people
 

9136
02:38:26,319 --> 02:38:29,270
ivermectin narrative right people
thought that the data was being hidden

9137
02:38:29,270 --> 02:38:29,280
thought that the data was being hidden
 

9138
02:38:29,280 --> 02:38:30,870
thought that the data was being hidden
about hydroxychloroquine so they said

9139
02:38:30,870 --> 02:38:30,880
about hydroxychloroquine so they said
 

9140
02:38:30,880 --> 02:38:32,150
about hydroxychloroquine so they said
well they must be doing the same thing

9141
02:38:32,150 --> 02:38:32,160
well they must be doing the same thing
 

9142
02:38:32,160 --> 02:38:33,429
well they must be doing the same thing
with hydromaxim but with

9143
02:38:33,429 --> 02:38:33,439
with hydromaxim but with
 

9144
02:38:33,439 --> 02:38:35,270
with hydromaxim but with
hydroxychloroquine it just

9145
02:38:35,270 --> 02:38:35,280
hydroxychloroquine it just
 

9146
02:38:35,280 --> 02:38:37,670
hydroxychloroquine it just
scientifically could not work

9147
02:38:37,670 --> 02:38:37,680
scientifically could not work
 

9148
02:38:37,680 --> 02:38:39,910
scientifically could not work
as an antiviral

9149
02:38:39,910 --> 02:38:39,920
as an antiviral
 

9150
02:38:39,920 --> 02:38:41,990
as an antiviral
the other problem that is more broad

9151
02:38:41,990 --> 02:38:42,000
the other problem that is more broad
 

9152
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:45,910
the other problem that is more broad
that is important to point out is that

9153
02:38:45,910 --> 02:38:45,920

 

9154
02:38:45,920 --> 02:38:47,510

when you

9155
02:38:47,510 --> 02:38:47,520
when you
 

9156
02:38:47,520 --> 02:38:48,950
when you
when you have covet and you need an

9157
02:38:48,950 --> 02:38:48,960
when you have covet and you need an
 

9158
02:38:48,960 --> 02:38:50,469
when you have covet and you need an
anti-virulence usually because you can't

9159
02:38:50,469 --> 02:38:50,479
anti-virulence usually because you can't
 

9160
02:38:50,479 --> 02:38:52,790
anti-virulence usually because you can't
breathe and you go in the hospital

9161
02:38:52,790 --> 02:38:52,800
breathe and you go in the hospital
 

9162
02:38:52,800 --> 02:38:53,990
breathe and you go in the hospital
because if you're mildly ill you're

9163
02:38:53,990 --> 02:38:54,000
because if you're mildly ill you're
 

9164
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:55,590
because if you're mildly ill you're
never going to go to your doctor and ask

9165
02:38:55,590 --> 02:38:55,600
never going to go to your doctor and ask
 

9166
02:38:55,600 --> 02:38:57,510
never going to go to your doctor and ask
for an antiviral and the problem is when

9167
02:38:57,510 --> 02:38:57,520
for an antiviral and the problem is when
 

9168
02:38:57,520 --> 02:38:59,429
for an antiviral and the problem is when
you can't breathe it's no longer a viral

9169
02:38:59,429 --> 02:38:59,439
you can't breathe it's no longer a viral
 

9170
02:38:59,439 --> 02:39:02,150
you can't breathe it's no longer a viral
issue it is now an inflammatory issue

9171
02:39:02,150 --> 02:39:02,160
issue it is now an inflammatory issue
 

9172
02:39:02,160 --> 02:39:04,150
issue it is now an inflammatory issue
and no antiviral in the world is going

9173
02:39:04,150 --> 02:39:04,160
and no antiviral in the world is going
 

9174
02:39:04,160 --> 02:39:05,270
and no antiviral in the world is going
to help you

9175
02:39:05,270 --> 02:39:05,280
to help you
 

9176
02:39:05,280 --> 02:39:08,150
to help you
so if that's why rem deserver doesn't

9177
02:39:08,150 --> 02:39:08,160
so if that's why rem deserver doesn't
 

9178
02:39:08,160 --> 02:39:09,750
so if that's why rem deserver doesn't
work very well because it's mainly given

9179
02:39:09,750 --> 02:39:09,760
work very well because it's mainly given
 

9180
02:39:09,760 --> 02:39:11,510
work very well because it's mainly given
intravenously to people who go in a

9181
02:39:11,510 --> 02:39:11,520
intravenously to people who go in a
 

9182
02:39:11,520 --> 02:39:13,349
intravenously to people who go in a
hospital

9183
02:39:13,349 --> 02:39:13,359
hospital
 

9184
02:39:13,359 --> 02:39:16,550
hospital
if you get ivermectin in the hospital

9185
02:39:16,550 --> 02:39:16,560
if you get ivermectin in the hospital
 

9186
02:39:16,560 --> 02:39:18,070
if you get ivermectin in the hospital
it's not going to do anything for for

9187
02:39:18,070 --> 02:39:18,080
it's not going to do anything for for
 

9188
02:39:18,080 --> 02:39:19,750
it's not going to do anything for for
reducing virus because by that time you

9189
02:39:19,750 --> 02:39:19,760
reducing virus because by that time you
 

9190
02:39:19,760 --> 02:39:21,830
reducing virus because by that time you
have very little virus to begin with you

9191
02:39:21,830 --> 02:39:21,840
have very little virus to begin with you
 

9192
02:39:21,840 --> 02:39:23,190
have very little virus to begin with you
have an inflammatory problem that you

9193
02:39:23,190 --> 02:39:23,200
have an inflammatory problem that you
 

9194
02:39:23,200 --> 02:39:25,910
have an inflammatory problem that you
need to treat in other ways so

9195
02:39:25,910 --> 02:39:25,920
need to treat in other ways so
 

9196
02:39:25,920 --> 02:39:28,389
need to treat in other ways so
this is why a lot of the antivirals

9197
02:39:28,389 --> 02:39:28,399
this is why a lot of the antivirals
 

9198
02:39:28,399 --> 02:39:30,790
this is why a lot of the antivirals
failed because they're used too late

9199
02:39:30,790 --> 02:39:30,800
failed because they're used too late
 

9200
02:39:30,800 --> 02:39:33,270
failed because they're used too late
what you need is a pill you take on that

9201
02:39:33,270 --> 02:39:33,280
what you need is a pill you take on that
 

9202
02:39:33,280 --> 02:39:34,870
what you need is a pill you take on that
first positive test when you have a

9203
02:39:34,870 --> 02:39:34,880
first positive test when you have a
 

9204
02:39:34,880 --> 02:39:36,710
first positive test when you have a
scratchy throat

9205
02:39:36,710 --> 02:39:36,720
scratchy throat
 

9206
02:39:36,720 --> 02:39:39,590
scratchy throat
you get a pcr in 15 minutes i'm positive

9207
02:39:39,590 --> 02:39:39,600
you get a pcr in 15 minutes i'm positive
 

9208
02:39:39,600 --> 02:39:42,309
you get a pcr in 15 minutes i'm positive
take a pill boom that's going to inhibit

9209
02:39:42,309 --> 02:39:42,319
take a pill boom that's going to inhibit
 

9210
02:39:42,319 --> 02:39:44,790
take a pill boom that's going to inhibit
it if you wait till you can't breathe

9211
02:39:44,790 --> 02:39:44,800
it if you wait till you can't breathe
 

9212
02:39:44,800 --> 02:39:46,630
it if you wait till you can't breathe
and that's why the monoclonals even

9213
02:39:46,630 --> 02:39:46,640
and that's why the monoclonals even
 

9214
02:39:46,640 --> 02:39:48,710
and that's why the monoclonals even
don't work if if you're in hospital that

9215
02:39:48,710 --> 02:39:48,720
don't work if if you're in hospital that
 

9216
02:39:48,720 --> 02:39:51,429
don't work if if you're in hospital that
well because it's too late and that the

9217
02:39:51,429 --> 02:39:51,439
well because it's too late and that the
 

9218
02:39:51,439 --> 02:39:54,070
well because it's too late and that the
approach now is if you're in a high risk

9219
02:39:54,070 --> 02:39:54,080
approach now is if you're in a high risk
 

9220
02:39:54,080 --> 02:39:56,150
approach now is if you're in a high risk
group if you're over 65

9221
02:39:56,150 --> 02:39:56,160
group if you're over 65
 

9222
02:39:56,160 --> 02:39:59,270
group if you're over 65
if you are obese or have diabetes or any

9223
02:39:59,270 --> 02:39:59,280
if you are obese or have diabetes or any
 

9224
02:39:59,280 --> 02:40:01,830
if you are obese or have diabetes or any
other comorbidities your first sign of a

9225
02:40:01,830 --> 02:40:01,840
other comorbidities your first sign of a
 

9226
02:40:01,840 --> 02:40:04,830
other comorbidities your first sign of a
scratchy throat positive you get

9227
02:40:04,830 --> 02:40:04,840
scratchy throat positive you get
 

9228
02:40:04,840 --> 02:40:07,349
scratchy throat positive you get
monoclonals then they might help you but

9229
02:40:07,349 --> 02:40:07,359
monoclonals then they might help you but
 

9230
02:40:07,359 --> 02:40:09,110
monoclonals then they might help you but
if you wait till you go into hospital

9231
02:40:09,110 --> 02:40:09,120
if you wait till you go into hospital
 

9232
02:40:09,120 --> 02:40:11,270
if you wait till you go into hospital
it's too late because the viral curve

9233
02:40:11,270 --> 02:40:11,280
it's too late because the viral curve
 

9234
02:40:11,280 --> 02:40:14,389
it's too late because the viral curve
drops after that first symptom

9235
02:40:14,389 --> 02:40:14,399
drops after that first symptom
 

9236
02:40:14,399 --> 02:40:16,150
drops after that first symptom
within three days you're you're no

9237
02:40:16,150 --> 02:40:16,160
within three days you're you're no
 

9238
02:40:16,160 --> 02:40:19,510
within three days you're you're no
longer shedding enough virus to transmit

9239
02:40:19,510 --> 02:40:19,520
longer shedding enough virus to transmit
 

9240
02:40:19,520 --> 02:40:21,590
longer shedding enough virus to transmit
drops really quickly so that's the

9241
02:40:21,590 --> 02:40:21,600
drops really quickly so that's the
 

9242
02:40:21,600 --> 02:40:23,110
drops really quickly so that's the
reason a lot of these antivirals failed

9243
02:40:23,110 --> 02:40:23,120
reason a lot of these antivirals failed
 

9244
02:40:23,120 --> 02:40:24,550
reason a lot of these antivirals failed
because they were tested in hospitalized

9245
02:40:24,550 --> 02:40:24,560
because they were tested in hospitalized
 

9246
02:40:24,560 --> 02:40:25,830
because they were tested in hospitalized
patients

9247
02:40:25,830 --> 02:40:25,840
patients
 

9248
02:40:25,840 --> 02:40:28,150
patients
and we have nothing but rem deserve here

9249
02:40:28,150 --> 02:40:28,160
and we have nothing but rem deserve here
 

9250
02:40:28,160 --> 02:40:29,990
and we have nothing but rem deserve here
now unfortunately so it was the wrong

9251
02:40:29,990 --> 02:40:30,000
now unfortunately so it was the wrong
 

9252
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:31,990
now unfortunately so it was the wrong
approach we should have

9253
02:40:31,990 --> 02:40:32,000
approach we should have
 

9254
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:32,870
approach we should have
been

9255
02:40:32,870 --> 02:40:32,880
been
 

9256
02:40:32,880 --> 02:40:34,469
been
giving it to people who just tested

9257
02:40:34,469 --> 02:40:34,479
giving it to people who just tested
 

9258
02:40:34,479 --> 02:40:36,710
giving it to people who just tested
positive from the start or just even for

9259
02:40:36,710 --> 02:40:36,720
positive from the start or just even for
 

9260
02:40:36,720 --> 02:40:38,710
positive from the start or just even for
preventative and see you could do that

9261
02:40:38,710 --> 02:40:38,720
preventative and see you could do that
 

9262
02:40:38,720 --> 02:40:40,790
preventative and see you could do that
too yeah but i have to say the other

9263
02:40:40,790 --> 02:40:40,800
too yeah but i have to say the other
 

9264
02:40:40,800 --> 02:40:41,990
too yeah but i have to say the other
issue is

9265
02:40:41,990 --> 02:40:42,000
issue is
 

9266
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:44,710
issue is
this monument is a drug in phase three

9267
02:40:44,710 --> 02:40:44,720
this monument is a drug in phase three
 

9268
02:40:44,720 --> 02:40:48,389
this monument is a drug in phase three
now it's an oral antiviral it looks good

9269
02:40:48,389 --> 02:40:48,399
now it's an oral antiviral it looks good
 

9270
02:40:48,399 --> 02:40:51,030
now it's an oral antiviral it looks good
if we go ahead with just one

9271
02:40:51,030 --> 02:40:51,040
if we go ahead with just one
 

9272
02:40:51,040 --> 02:40:52,710
if we go ahead with just one
we're going to get resistance within a

9273
02:40:52,710 --> 02:40:52,720
we're going to get resistance within a
 

9274
02:40:52,720 --> 02:40:54,389
we're going to get resistance within a
few months and it will be useless we

9275
02:40:54,389 --> 02:40:54,399
few months and it will be useless we
 

9276
02:40:54,399 --> 02:40:56,710
few months and it will be useless we
need to have at least two or three drugs

9277
02:40:56,710 --> 02:40:56,720
need to have at least two or three drugs
 

9278
02:40:56,720 --> 02:40:59,030
need to have at least two or three drugs
that we can give in combinations and we

9279
02:40:59,030 --> 02:40:59,040
that we can give in combinations and we
 

9280
02:40:59,040 --> 02:41:00,950
that we can give in combinations and we
know that because that's what took care

9281
02:41:00,950 --> 02:41:00,960
know that because that's what took care
 

9282
02:41:00,960 --> 02:41:03,670
know that because that's what took care
of hiv that's what took care of hcv

9283
02:41:03,670 --> 02:41:03,680
of hiv that's what took care of hcv
 

9284
02:41:03,680 --> 02:41:06,389
of hiv that's what took care of hcv
hepatitis c virus it really reduces the

9285
02:41:06,389 --> 02:41:06,399
hepatitis c virus it really reduces the
 

9286
02:41:06,399 --> 02:41:09,110
hepatitis c virus it really reduces the
emergence of resistance

9287
02:41:09,110 --> 02:41:09,120
emergence of resistance
 

9288
02:41:09,120 --> 02:41:10,950
emergence of resistance
joe rogan got quite a bit of heat

9289
02:41:10,950 --> 02:41:10,960
joe rogan got quite a bit of heat
 

9290
02:41:10,960 --> 02:41:14,389
joe rogan got quite a bit of heat
recently about mentioning a paper

9291
02:41:14,389 --> 02:41:14,399
recently about mentioning a paper
 

9292
02:41:14,399 --> 02:41:16,469
recently about mentioning a paper
and a broader idea

9293
02:41:16,469 --> 02:41:16,479
and a broader idea
 

9294
02:41:16,479 --> 02:41:18,469
and a broader idea
which i didn't i don't think is that

9295
02:41:18,469 --> 02:41:18,479
which i didn't i don't think is that
 

9296
02:41:18,479 --> 02:41:21,349
which i didn't i don't think is that
controversial but maybe we can expand on

9297
02:41:21,349 --> 02:41:21,359
controversial but maybe we can expand on
 

9298
02:41:21,359 --> 02:41:22,790
controversial but maybe we can expand on
it

9299
02:41:22,790 --> 02:41:22,800
it
 

9300
02:41:22,800 --> 02:41:24,870
it
and the idea is that

9301
02:41:24,870 --> 02:41:24,880
and the idea is that
 

9302
02:41:24,880 --> 02:41:26,790
and the idea is that
vaccines

9303
02:41:26,790 --> 02:41:26,800
vaccines
 

9304
02:41:26,800 --> 02:41:29,429
vaccines
uh create selective pressure

9305
02:41:29,429 --> 02:41:29,439
uh create selective pressure
 

9306
02:41:29,439 --> 02:41:32,309
uh create selective pressure
for a virus to mutate

9307
02:41:32,309 --> 02:41:32,319
for a virus to mutate
 

9308
02:41:32,319 --> 02:41:35,190
for a virus to mutate
and for variance to form

9309
02:41:35,190 --> 02:41:35,200
and for variance to form
 

9310
02:41:35,200 --> 02:41:37,269
and for variance to form
what um

9311
02:41:37,269 --> 02:41:37,279
what um
 

9312
02:41:37,279 --> 02:41:38,790
what um
first of all from a biological

9313
02:41:38,790 --> 02:41:38,800
first of all from a biological
 

9314
02:41:38,800 --> 02:41:40,309
first of all from a biological
perspective

9315
02:41:40,309 --> 02:41:40,319
perspective
 

9316
02:41:40,319 --> 02:41:42,950
perspective
can you explain this process and

9317
02:41:42,950 --> 02:41:42,960
can you explain this process and
 

9318
02:41:42,960 --> 02:41:44,309
can you explain this process and
from a

9319
02:41:44,309 --> 02:41:44,319
from a
 

9320
02:41:44,319 --> 02:41:46,070
from a
societal perspective what are we

9321
02:41:46,070 --> 02:41:46,080
societal perspective what are we
 

9322
02:41:46,080 --> 02:41:48,150
societal perspective what are we
supposed to do about that so let's get

9323
02:41:48,150 --> 02:41:48,160
supposed to do about that so let's get
 

9324
02:41:48,160 --> 02:41:50,309
supposed to do about that so let's get
the terminology right so as we talked

9325
02:41:50,309 --> 02:41:50,319
the terminology right so as we talked
 

9326
02:41:50,319 --> 02:41:52,870
the terminology right so as we talked
about earlier viruses are always

9327
02:41:52,870 --> 02:41:52,880
about earlier viruses are always
 

9328
02:41:52,880 --> 02:41:56,550
about earlier viruses are always
mutating so no vaccine or no drug makes

9329
02:41:56,550 --> 02:41:56,560
mutating so no vaccine or no drug makes
 

9330
02:41:56,560 --> 02:41:58,870
mutating so no vaccine or no drug makes
a virus mutate right that's the wrong

9331
02:41:58,870 --> 02:41:58,880
a virus mutate right that's the wrong
 

9332
02:41:58,880 --> 02:42:00,630
a virus mutate right that's the wrong
perspective which you look at

9333
02:42:00,630 --> 02:42:00,640
perspective which you look at
 

9334
02:42:00,640 --> 02:42:02,469
perspective which you look at
what the what the

9335
02:42:02,469 --> 02:42:02,479
what the what the
 

9336
02:42:02,479 --> 02:42:04,950
what the what the
immune response is is putting pressure

9337
02:42:04,950 --> 02:42:04,960
immune response is is putting pressure
 

9338
02:42:04,960 --> 02:42:07,190
immune response is is putting pressure
selection pressure on the virus and if

9339
02:42:07,190 --> 02:42:07,200
selection pressure on the virus and if
 

9340
02:42:07,200 --> 02:42:08,630
selection pressure on the virus and if
there's a

9341
02:42:08,630 --> 02:42:08,640
there's a
 

9342
02:42:08,640 --> 02:42:10,790
there's a
one particle with the right

9343
02:42:10,790 --> 02:42:10,800
one particle with the right
 

9344
02:42:10,800 --> 02:42:12,790
one particle with the right
mutation that can escape the antibody

9345
02:42:12,790 --> 02:42:12,800
mutation that can escape the antibody
 

9346
02:42:12,800 --> 02:42:15,190
mutation that can escape the antibody
that will emerge right

9347
02:42:15,190 --> 02:42:15,200
that will emerge right
 

9348
02:42:15,200 --> 02:42:17,030
that will emerge right
so that's what happens with influenza

9349
02:42:17,030 --> 02:42:17,040
so that's what happens with influenza
 

9350
02:42:17,040 --> 02:42:20,150
so that's what happens with influenza
virus right we vaccinate every year

9351
02:42:20,150 --> 02:42:20,160
virus right we vaccinate every year
 

9352
02:42:20,160 --> 02:42:21,429
virus right we vaccinate every year
and there are not a lot of people that

9353
02:42:21,429 --> 02:42:21,439
and there are not a lot of people that
 

9354
02:42:21,439 --> 02:42:23,030
and there are not a lot of people that
get infected so they get natural

9355
02:42:23,030 --> 02:42:23,040
get infected so they get natural
 

9356
02:42:23,040 --> 02:42:24,790
get infected so they get natural
immunity

9357
02:42:24,790 --> 02:42:24,800
immunity
 

9358
02:42:24,800 --> 02:42:28,309
immunity
and then the virus is incredibly

9359
02:42:28,309 --> 02:42:28,319
and then the virus is incredibly
 

9360
02:42:28,319 --> 02:42:30,950
and then the virus is incredibly
varied it mutates like crazy and there's

9361
02:42:30,950 --> 02:42:30,960
varied it mutates like crazy and there's
 

9362
02:42:30,960 --> 02:42:32,550
varied it mutates like crazy and there's
in some person somewhere there's one

9363
02:42:32,550 --> 02:42:32,560
in some person somewhere there's one
 

9364
02:42:32,560 --> 02:42:34,550
in some person somewhere there's one
variant that escapes the antibody which

9365
02:42:34,550 --> 02:42:34,560
variant that escapes the antibody which
 

9366
02:42:34,560 --> 02:42:36,469
variant that escapes the antibody which
has been induced either by infection or

9367
02:42:36,469 --> 02:42:36,479
has been induced either by infection or
 

9368
02:42:36,479 --> 02:42:38,790
has been induced either by infection or
vaccination it can be both

9369
02:42:38,790 --> 02:42:38,800
vaccination it can be both
 

9370
02:42:38,800 --> 02:42:40,870
vaccination it can be both
and that drives the emergence of the new

9371
02:42:40,870 --> 02:42:40,880
and that drives the emergence of the new
 

9372
02:42:40,880 --> 02:42:42,230
and that drives the emergence of the new
variant so the next year we need to

9373
02:42:42,230 --> 02:42:42,240
variant so the next year we need to
 

9374
02:42:42,240 --> 02:42:43,910
variant so the next year we need to
change the vaccine

9375
02:42:43,910 --> 02:42:43,920
change the vaccine
 

9376
02:42:43,920 --> 02:42:44,870
change the vaccine
so

9377
02:42:44,870 --> 02:42:44,880
so
 

9378
02:42:44,880 --> 02:42:46,389
so
i would say

9379
02:42:46,389 --> 02:42:46,399
i would say
 

9380
02:42:46,399 --> 02:42:49,030
i would say
both natural infection and vaccination

9381
02:42:49,030 --> 02:42:49,040
both natural infection and vaccination
 

9382
02:42:49,040 --> 02:42:49,990
both natural infection and vaccination
sure

9383
02:42:49,990 --> 02:42:50,000
sure
 

9384
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:52,389
sure
select for variance absolutely there's

9385
02:42:52,389 --> 02:42:52,399
select for variance absolutely there's
 

9386
02:42:52,399 --> 02:42:54,389
select for variance absolutely there's
no question because they're inducing

9387
02:42:54,389 --> 02:42:54,399
no question because they're inducing
 

9388
02:42:54,399 --> 02:42:56,150
no question because they're inducing
immunity now

9389
02:42:56,150 --> 02:42:56,160
immunity now
 

9390
02:42:56,160 --> 02:42:58,389
immunity now
what happened last year was

9391
02:42:58,389 --> 02:42:58,399
what happened last year was
 

9392
02:42:58,399 --> 02:43:00,870
what happened last year was
at the beginning of 2020 very few people

9393
02:43:00,870 --> 02:43:00,880
at the beginning of 2020 very few people
 

9394
02:43:00,880 --> 02:43:03,030
at the beginning of 2020 very few people
in the world were immune as the virus

9395
02:43:03,030 --> 02:43:03,040
in the world were immune as the virus
 

9396
02:43:03,040 --> 02:43:05,830
in the world were immune as the virus
first started spreading

9397
02:43:05,830 --> 02:43:05,840
first started spreading
 

9398
02:43:05,840 --> 02:43:07,910
first started spreading
but you can see in the sequences of

9399
02:43:07,910 --> 02:43:07,920
but you can see in the sequences of
 

9400
02:43:07,920 --> 02:43:09,910
but you can see in the sequences of
those isolates from the beginning of

9401
02:43:09,910 --> 02:43:09,920
those isolates from the beginning of
 

9402
02:43:09,920 --> 02:43:12,469
those isolates from the beginning of
2020 you can see

9403
02:43:12,469 --> 02:43:12,479
2020 you can see
 

9404
02:43:12,479 --> 02:43:14,550
2020 you can see
all of the changes that are now present

9405
02:43:14,550 --> 02:43:14,560
all of the changes that are now present
 

9406
02:43:14,560 --> 02:43:16,870
all of the changes that are now present
in the variants of concern at very very

9407
02:43:16,870 --> 02:43:16,880
in the variants of concern at very very
 

9408
02:43:16,880 --> 02:43:18,550
in the variants of concern at very very
low frequencies they were already there

9409
02:43:18,550 --> 02:43:18,560
low frequencies they were already there
 

9410
02:43:18,560 --> 02:43:21,110
low frequencies they were already there
but there was no selection for them to

9411
02:43:21,110 --> 02:43:21,120
but there was no selection for them to
 

9412
02:43:21,120 --> 02:43:24,070
but there was no selection for them to
emerge until november when we now had

9413
02:43:24,070 --> 02:43:24,080
emerge until november when we now had
 

9414
02:43:24,080 --> 02:43:26,630
emerge until november when we now had
many millions of people who had

9415
02:43:26,630 --> 02:43:26,640
many millions of people who had
 

9416
02:43:26,640 --> 02:43:28,550
many millions of people who had
mostly been infected but also some

9417
02:43:28,550 --> 02:43:28,560
mostly been infected but also some
 

9418
02:43:28,560 --> 02:43:31,349
mostly been infected but also some
vaccinated then we saw the alpha variant

9419
02:43:31,349 --> 02:43:31,359
vaccinated then we saw the alpha variant
 

9420
02:43:31,359 --> 02:43:34,230
vaccinated then we saw the alpha variant
emerge in england probably because of

9421
02:43:34,230 --> 02:43:34,240
emerge in england probably because of
 

9422
02:43:34,240 --> 02:43:37,190
emerge in england probably because of
immune selection now the the virus

9423
02:43:37,190 --> 02:43:37,200
immune selection now the the virus
 

9424
02:43:37,200 --> 02:43:38,950
immune selection now the the virus
that had the change that evaded the

9425
02:43:38,950 --> 02:43:38,960
that had the change that evaded the
 

9426
02:43:38,960 --> 02:43:40,309
that had the change that evaded the
antibody

9427
02:43:40,309 --> 02:43:40,319
antibody
 

9428
02:43:40,319 --> 02:43:41,830
antibody
had an advantage

9429
02:43:41,830 --> 02:43:41,840
had an advantage
 

9430
02:43:41,840 --> 02:43:43,349
had an advantage
and that virus drove through the

9431
02:43:43,349 --> 02:43:43,359
and that virus drove through the
 

9432
02:43:43,359 --> 02:43:44,790
and that virus drove through the
population so that's what we're seeing

9433
02:43:44,790 --> 02:43:44,800
population so that's what we're seeing
 

9434
02:43:44,800 --> 02:43:46,070
population so that's what we're seeing
we're seeing all these variants are

9435
02:43:46,070 --> 02:43:46,080
we're seeing all these variants are
 

9436
02:43:46,080 --> 02:43:48,710
we're seeing all these variants are
simply antigenic selection so so the the

9437
02:43:48,710 --> 02:43:48,720
simply antigenic selection so so the the
 

9438
02:43:48,720 --> 02:43:51,910
simply antigenic selection so so the the
variance the mutations that are at the

9439
02:43:51,910 --> 02:43:51,920
variance the mutations that are at the
 

9440
02:43:51,920 --> 02:43:55,349
variance the mutations that are at the
core of these quantum core variants

9441
02:43:55,349 --> 02:43:55,359
core of these quantum core variants
 

9442
02:43:55,359 --> 02:43:56,790
core of these quantum core variants
they were always there all along the

9443
02:43:56,790 --> 02:43:56,800
they were always there all along the
 

9444
02:43:56,800 --> 02:43:58,309
they were always there all along the
vaccine

9445
02:43:58,309 --> 02:43:58,319
vaccine
 

9446
02:43:58,319 --> 02:44:00,630
vaccine
or the infections did not create them no

9447
02:44:00,630 --> 02:44:00,640
or the infections did not create them no
 

9448
02:44:00,640 --> 02:44:02,550
or the infections did not create them no
infections don't create they're selected

9449
02:44:02,550 --> 02:44:02,560
infections don't create they're selected
 

9450
02:44:02,560 --> 02:44:05,750
infections don't create they're selected
it's like the vaccine wipe out

9451
02:44:05,750 --> 02:44:05,760
it's like the vaccine wipe out
 

9452
02:44:05,760 --> 02:44:08,150
it's like the vaccine wipe out
a lot of the variants

9453
02:44:08,150 --> 02:44:08,160
a lot of the variants
 

9454
02:44:08,160 --> 02:44:08,950
a lot of the variants
right

9455
02:44:08,950 --> 02:44:08,960
right
 

9456
02:44:08,960 --> 02:44:09,830
right
and then

9457
02:44:09,830 --> 02:44:09,840
and then
 

9458
02:44:09,840 --> 02:44:12,389
and then
um by being immune by making your body

9459
02:44:12,389 --> 02:44:12,399
um by being immune by making your body
 

9460
02:44:12,399 --> 02:44:14,469
um by being immune by making your body
immune to them and so but some of them

9461
02:44:14,469 --> 02:44:14,479
immune to them and so but some of them
 

9462
02:44:14,479 --> 02:44:17,670
immune to them and so but some of them
survive yeah exactly and there's another

9463
02:44:17,670 --> 02:44:17,680
survive yeah exactly and there's another
 

9464
02:44:17,680 --> 02:44:19,429
survive yeah exactly and there's another
tree that's built

9465
02:44:19,429 --> 02:44:19,439
tree that's built
 

9466
02:44:19,439 --> 02:44:23,750
tree that's built
and it's unclear what that tree leads to

9467
02:44:23,750 --> 02:44:23,760
and it's unclear what that tree leads to
 

9468
02:44:23,760 --> 02:44:26,150
and it's unclear what that tree leads to
i mean it could make things much worse

9469
02:44:26,150 --> 02:44:26,160
i mean it could make things much worse
 

9470
02:44:26,160 --> 02:44:28,389
i mean it could make things much worse
or much better don't we don't know well

9471
02:44:28,389 --> 02:44:28,399
or much better don't we don't know well
 

9472
02:44:28,399 --> 02:44:30,230
or much better don't we don't know well
with flu we see year after year the

9473
02:44:30,230 --> 02:44:30,240
with flu we see year after year the
 

9474
02:44:30,240 --> 02:44:32,389
with flu we see year after year the
virus changes we change the vaccine we

9475
02:44:32,389 --> 02:44:32,399
virus changes we change the vaccine we
 

9476
02:44:32,399 --> 02:44:33,510
virus changes we change the vaccine we
deal with it

9477
02:44:33,510 --> 02:44:33,520
deal with it
 

9478
02:44:33,520 --> 02:44:35,429
deal with it
we change it again there's an unending

9479
02:44:35,429 --> 02:44:35,439
we change it again there's an unending
 

9480
02:44:35,439 --> 02:44:37,510
we change it again there's an unending
but see that's a very different story if

9481
02:44:37,510 --> 02:44:37,520
but see that's a very different story if
 

9482
02:44:37,520 --> 02:44:38,550
but see that's a very different story if
do you think

9483
02:44:38,550 --> 02:44:38,560
do you think
 

9484
02:44:38,560 --> 02:44:41,910
do you think
do you think covid will be

9485
02:44:41,910 --> 02:44:41,920
do you think covid will be
 

9486
02:44:41,920 --> 02:44:42,870
do you think covid will be
um

9487
02:44:42,870 --> 02:44:42,880
um
 

9488
02:44:42,880 --> 02:44:44,630
um
with some likelihood

9489
02:44:44,630 --> 02:44:44,640
with some likelihood
 

9490
02:44:44,640 --> 02:44:46,870
with some likelihood
uh like the flu whereas basically

9491
02:44:46,870 --> 02:44:46,880
uh like the flu whereas basically
 

9492
02:44:46,880 --> 02:44:50,950
uh like the flu whereas basically
variants will never be able to um

9493
02:44:50,950 --> 02:44:50,960
variants will never be able to um
 

9494
02:44:50,960 --> 02:44:52,630
variants will never be able to um
eradicate it

9495
02:44:52,630 --> 02:44:52,640
eradicate it
 

9496
02:44:52,640 --> 02:44:54,710
eradicate it
it will never eradicate it

9497
02:44:54,710 --> 02:44:54,720
it will never eradicate it
 

9498
02:44:54,720 --> 02:44:55,990
it will never eradicate it
in any case

9499
02:44:55,990 --> 02:44:56,000
in any case
 

9500
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:57,269
in any case
ever

9501
02:44:57,269 --> 02:44:57,279
ever
 

9502
02:44:57,279 --> 02:44:58,389
ever
well

9503
02:44:58,389 --> 02:44:58,399
well
 

9504
02:44:58,399 --> 02:45:00,950
well
come up with a vaccine that uh

9505
02:45:00,950 --> 02:45:00,960
come up with a vaccine that uh
 

9506
02:45:00,960 --> 02:45:03,030
come up with a vaccine that uh
makes you immune to enough variance to

9507
02:45:03,030 --> 02:45:03,040
makes you immune to enough variance to
 

9508
02:45:03,040 --> 02:45:05,590
makes you immune to enough variance to
where there's not enough evolutionary

9509
02:45:05,590 --> 02:45:05,600
where there's not enough evolutionary
 

9510
02:45:05,600 --> 02:45:06,389
where there's not enough evolutionary
like

9511
02:45:06,389 --> 02:45:06,399
like
 

9512
02:45:06,399 --> 02:45:08,389
like
room well if you cut down the number of

9513
02:45:08,389 --> 02:45:08,399
room well if you cut down the number of
 

9514
02:45:08,399 --> 02:45:10,870
room well if you cut down the number of
infections then you reduce the diversity

9515
02:45:10,870 --> 02:45:10,880
infections then you reduce the diversity
 

9516
02:45:10,880 --> 02:45:13,429
infections then you reduce the diversity
sure yes right the problem is if let's

9517
02:45:13,429 --> 02:45:13,439
sure yes right the problem is if let's
 

9518
02:45:13,439 --> 02:45:16,230
sure yes right the problem is if let's
say you're a cynic and you say well

9519
02:45:16,230 --> 02:45:16,240
say you're a cynic and you say well
 

9520
02:45:16,240 --> 02:45:18,230
say you're a cynic and you say well
vaccination is just selecting for

9521
02:45:18,230 --> 02:45:18,240
vaccination is just selecting for
 

9522
02:45:18,240 --> 02:45:20,230
vaccination is just selecting for
variance so let's stop it but then

9523
02:45:20,230 --> 02:45:20,240
variance so let's stop it but then
 

9524
02:45:20,240 --> 02:45:21,510
variance so let's stop it but then
you're going to have infection and

9525
02:45:21,510 --> 02:45:21,520
you're going to have infection and
 

9526
02:45:21,520 --> 02:45:23,349
you're going to have infection and
that's going to select for variance and

9527
02:45:23,349 --> 02:45:23,359
that's going to select for variance and
 

9528
02:45:23,359 --> 02:45:25,349
that's going to select for variance and
they're the more you're more likely to

9529
02:45:25,349 --> 02:45:25,359
they're the more you're more likely to
 

9530
02:45:25,359 --> 02:45:26,830
they're the more you're more likely to
get very sick because we know the

9531
02:45:26,830 --> 02:45:26,840
get very sick because we know the
 

9532
02:45:26,840 --> 02:45:29,190
get very sick because we know the
vaccines are really good at preventing

9533
02:45:29,190 --> 02:45:29,200
vaccines are really good at preventing
 

9534
02:45:29,200 --> 02:45:30,950
vaccines are really good at preventing
you from dying so

9535
02:45:30,950 --> 02:45:30,960
you from dying so
 

9536
02:45:30,960 --> 02:45:33,190
you from dying so
that's why it still makes sense to use

9537
02:45:33,190 --> 02:45:33,200
that's why it still makes sense to use
 

9538
02:45:33,200 --> 02:45:35,910
that's why it still makes sense to use
vaccines because they prevent you from

9539
02:45:35,910 --> 02:45:35,920
vaccines because they prevent you from
 

9540
02:45:35,920 --> 02:45:38,309
vaccines because they prevent you from
dying yeah that's the bottom line but

9541
02:45:38,309 --> 02:45:38,319
dying yeah that's the bottom line but
 

9542
02:45:38,319 --> 02:45:40,150
dying yeah that's the bottom line but
can we ever make

9543
02:45:40,150 --> 02:45:40,160
can we ever make
 

9544
02:45:40,160 --> 02:45:42,389
can we ever make
a vaccine that deals

9545
02:45:42,389 --> 02:45:42,399
a vaccine that deals
 

9546
02:45:42,399 --> 02:45:44,550
a vaccine that deals
with all variants

9547
02:45:44,550 --> 02:45:44,560
with all variants
 

9548
02:45:44,560 --> 02:45:46,790
with all variants
absolutely and the reason i say that is

9549
02:45:46,790 --> 02:45:46,800
absolutely and the reason i say that is
 

9550
02:45:46,800 --> 02:45:48,790
absolutely and the reason i say that is
because

9551
02:45:48,790 --> 02:45:48,800
because
 

9552
02:45:48,800 --> 02:45:51,429
because
people who get

9553
02:45:51,429 --> 02:45:51,439
people who get
 

9554
02:45:51,439 --> 02:45:53,429
people who get
naturally infected with psoriasis they

9555
02:45:53,429 --> 02:45:53,439
naturally infected with psoriasis they
 

9556
02:45:53,439 --> 02:45:56,790
naturally infected with psoriasis they
develop covid they recover

9557
02:45:56,790 --> 02:45:56,800
develop covid they recover
 

9558
02:45:56,800 --> 02:45:59,510
develop covid they recover
if you give them one vaccine dose

9559
02:45:59,510 --> 02:45:59,520
if you give them one vaccine dose
 

9560
02:45:59,520 --> 02:46:01,670
if you give them one vaccine dose
they make an immune response that

9561
02:46:01,670 --> 02:46:01,680
they make an immune response that
 

9562
02:46:01,680 --> 02:46:02,870
they make an immune response that
handles

9563
02:46:02,870 --> 02:46:02,880
handles
 

9564
02:46:02,880 --> 02:46:04,710
handles
all the variants that are around right

9565
02:46:04,710 --> 02:46:04,720
all the variants that are around right
 

9566
02:46:04,720 --> 02:46:05,670
all the variants that are around right
now

9567
02:46:05,670 --> 02:46:05,680
now
 

9568
02:46:05,680 --> 02:46:07,590
now
all of them much better than people

9569
02:46:07,590 --> 02:46:07,600
all of them much better than people
 

9570
02:46:07,600 --> 02:46:10,550
all of them much better than people
who've gotten two doses of vaccine for

9571
02:46:10,550 --> 02:46:10,560
who've gotten two doses of vaccine for
 

9572
02:46:10,560 --> 02:46:11,830
who've gotten two doses of vaccine for
some reason

9573
02:46:11,830 --> 02:46:11,840
some reason
 

9574
02:46:11,840 --> 02:46:13,670
some reason
their immune response is suddenly

9575
02:46:13,670 --> 02:46:13,680
their immune response is suddenly
 

9576
02:46:13,680 --> 02:46:15,349
their immune response is suddenly
broadened after the infection

9577
02:46:15,349 --> 02:46:15,359
broadened after the infection
 

9578
02:46:15,359 --> 02:46:16,790
broadened after the infection
vaccination

9579
02:46:16,790 --> 02:46:16,800
vaccination
 

9580
02:46:16,800 --> 02:46:18,389
vaccination
and they can handle all the variants

9581
02:46:18,389 --> 02:46:18,399
and they can handle all the variants
 

9582
02:46:18,399 --> 02:46:20,070
and they can handle all the variants
that we know of so far so that tells me

9583
02:46:20,070 --> 02:46:20,080
that we know of so far so that tells me
 

9584
02:46:20,080 --> 02:46:21,429
that we know of so far so that tells me
we can

9585
02:46:21,429 --> 02:46:21,439
we can
 

9586
02:46:21,439 --> 02:46:23,750
we can
devise a strategy to do the same thing

9587
02:46:23,750 --> 02:46:23,760
devise a strategy to do the same thing
 

9588
02:46:23,760 --> 02:46:26,070
devise a strategy to do the same thing
with a vaccine that makes a really broad

9589
02:46:26,070 --> 02:46:26,080
with a vaccine that makes a really broad
 

9590
02:46:26,080 --> 02:46:27,830
with a vaccine that makes a really broad
vaccine that'll handle all the variables

9591
02:46:27,830 --> 02:46:27,840
vaccine that'll handle all the variables
 

9592
02:46:27,840 --> 02:46:29,990
vaccine that'll handle all the variables
well you actually uh on the virology

9593
02:46:29,990 --> 02:46:30,000
well you actually uh on the virology

of that but i am
 

9598
02:46:33,439 --> 02:46:35,910

yes oh the blog yes but there's a

9599
02:46:35,910 --> 02:46:35,920
yes oh the blog yes but there's a
 

9600
02:46:35,920 --> 02:46:37,670
yes oh the blog yes but there's a
particular post that's talking about

9601
02:46:37,670 --> 02:46:37,680
particular post that's talking about
 

9602
02:46:37,680 --> 02:46:39,269
particular post that's talking about
reporting in a paper

9603
02:46:39,269 --> 02:46:39,279
reporting in a paper
 

9604
02:46:39,279 --> 02:46:41,429
reporting in a paper
the mix-and-match strategy oh yes that's

9605
02:46:41,429 --> 02:46:41,439
the mix-and-match strategy oh yes that's
 

9606
02:46:41,439 --> 02:46:44,469
the mix-and-match strategy oh yes that's
one of my co-writers trudy ray yeah yeah

9607
02:46:44,469 --> 02:46:44,479
one of my co-writers trudy ray yeah yeah
 

9608
02:46:44,479 --> 02:46:46,710
one of my co-writers trudy ray yeah yeah
that's a it's an interesting idea that

9609
02:46:46,710 --> 02:46:46,720
that's a it's an interesting idea that
 

9610
02:46:46,720 --> 02:46:48,230
that's a it's an interesting idea that
there's some

9611
02:46:48,230 --> 02:46:48,240
there's some
 

9612
02:46:48,240 --> 02:46:50,150
there's some
early evidence now that

9613
02:46:50,150 --> 02:46:50,160
early evidence now that
 

9614
02:46:50,160 --> 02:46:52,389
early evidence now that
mixing and matching vaccines

9615
02:46:52,389 --> 02:46:52,399
mixing and matching vaccines
 

9616
02:46:52,399 --> 02:46:54,950
mixing and matching vaccines
like one shot of pfizer and one of like

9617
02:46:54,950 --> 02:46:54,960
like one shot of pfizer and one of like
 

9618
02:46:54,960 --> 02:46:56,469
like one shot of pfizer and one of like
modern or something

9619
02:46:56,469 --> 02:46:56,479
modern or something
 

9620
02:46:56,479 --> 02:46:58,950
modern or something
that creates a much better

9621
02:46:58,950 --> 02:46:58,960
that creates a much better
 

9622
02:46:58,960 --> 02:47:00,550
that creates a much better
uh immunity

9623
02:47:00,550 --> 02:47:00,560
uh immunity
 

9624
02:47:00,560 --> 02:47:03,030
uh immunity
than uh does two shots of laser i think

9625
02:47:03,030 --> 02:47:03,040
than uh does two shots of laser i think
 

9626
02:47:03,040 --> 02:47:05,590
than uh does two shots of laser i think
that's worth exploring absolutely

9627
02:47:05,590 --> 02:47:05,600
that's worth exploring absolutely
 

9628
02:47:05,600 --> 02:47:07,110
that's worth exploring absolutely
and this is relevant what we're doing

9629
02:47:07,110 --> 02:47:07,120
and this is relevant what we're doing
 

9630
02:47:07,120 --> 02:47:08,950
and this is relevant what we're doing
with influenza

9631
02:47:08,950 --> 02:47:08,960
with influenza
 

9632
02:47:08,960 --> 02:47:10,469
with influenza
you know instead of having to vaccinate

9633
02:47:10,469 --> 02:47:10,479
you know instead of having to vaccinate
 

9634
02:47:10,479 --> 02:47:12,309
you know instead of having to vaccinate
people every year why can't we devise a

9635
02:47:12,309 --> 02:47:12,319
people every year why can't we devise a
 

9636
02:47:12,319 --> 02:47:14,150
people every year why can't we devise a
vaccine which you'd get once in your

9637
02:47:14,150 --> 02:47:14,160
vaccine which you'd get once in your
 

9638
02:47:14,160 --> 02:47:16,150
vaccine which you'd get once in your
lifetime or maybe once every 10 years

9639
02:47:16,150 --> 02:47:16,160
lifetime or maybe once every 10 years
 

9640
02:47:16,160 --> 02:47:17,349
lifetime or maybe once every 10 years
okay

9641
02:47:17,349 --> 02:47:17,359
okay
 

9642
02:47:17,359 --> 02:47:18,309
okay
so

9643
02:47:18,309 --> 02:47:18,319
so
 

9644
02:47:18,319 --> 02:47:20,550
so
the the spike of influenza

9645
02:47:20,550 --> 02:47:20,560
the the spike of influenza
 

9646
02:47:20,560 --> 02:47:21,910
the the spike of influenza
it's a long

9647
02:47:21,910 --> 02:47:21,920
it's a long
 

9648
02:47:21,920 --> 02:47:24,230
it's a long
protein kind of like the spike of saurus

9649
02:47:24,230 --> 02:47:24,240
protein kind of like the spike of saurus
 

9650
02:47:24,240 --> 02:47:26,230
protein kind of like the spike of saurus
cov2 it's stuck in the virus membrane

9651
02:47:26,230 --> 02:47:26,240
cov2 it's stuck in the virus membrane
 

9652
02:47:26,240 --> 02:47:28,469
cov2 it's stuck in the virus membrane
and the very tip

9653
02:47:28,469 --> 02:47:28,479
and the very tip
 

9654
02:47:28,479 --> 02:47:30,710
and the very tip
that's the part that changes

9655
02:47:30,710 --> 02:47:30,720
that's the part that changes
 

9656
02:47:30,720 --> 02:47:32,230
that's the part that changes
every year that's where the antibodies

9657
02:47:32,230 --> 02:47:32,240
every year that's where the antibodies
 

9658
02:47:32,240 --> 02:47:33,590
every year that's where the antibodies
bind

9659
02:47:33,590 --> 02:47:33,600
bind
 

9660
02:47:33,600 --> 02:47:35,349
bind
but the stem

9661
02:47:35,349 --> 02:47:35,359
but the stem
 

9662
02:47:35,359 --> 02:47:37,429
but the stem
doesn't change

9663
02:47:37,429 --> 02:47:37,439
doesn't change
 

9664
02:47:37,439 --> 02:47:39,750
doesn't change
and if you make antibodies to the stem

9665
02:47:39,750 --> 02:47:39,760
and if you make antibodies to the stem
 

9666
02:47:39,760 --> 02:47:41,750
and if you make antibodies to the stem
they can also prevent infection it's

9667
02:47:41,750 --> 02:47:41,760
they can also prevent infection it's
 

9668
02:47:41,760 --> 02:47:42,790
they can also prevent infection it's
just that

9669
02:47:42,790 --> 02:47:42,800
just that
 

9670
02:47:42,800 --> 02:47:44,710
just that
when people are infected or with the

9671
02:47:44,710 --> 02:47:44,720
when people are infected or with the
 

9672
02:47:44,720 --> 02:47:46,550
when people are infected or with the
current vaccines they'll make many

9673
02:47:46,550 --> 02:47:46,560
current vaccines they'll make many
 

9674
02:47:46,560 --> 02:47:48,710
current vaccines they'll make many
antibodies to that stem part

9675
02:47:48,710 --> 02:47:48,720
antibodies to that stem part
 

9676
02:47:48,720 --> 02:47:50,550
antibodies to that stem part
but we're trying to figure out how to

9677
02:47:50,550 --> 02:47:50,560
but we're trying to figure out how to
 

9678
02:47:50,560 --> 02:47:52,550
but we're trying to figure out how to
make those and we think they would be

9679
02:47:52,550 --> 02:47:52,560
make those and we think they would be
 

9680
02:47:52,560 --> 02:47:54,230
make those and we think they would be
broadly protective and you'd never be

9681
02:47:54,230 --> 02:47:54,240
broadly protective and you'd never be
 

9682
02:47:54,240 --> 02:47:57,750
broadly protective and you'd never be
able to or more rarely be able to

9683
02:47:57,750 --> 02:47:57,760
able to or more rarely be able to
 

9684
02:47:57,760 --> 02:48:00,469
able to or more rarely be able to
have a variant emerge that that escaped

9685
02:48:00,469 --> 02:48:00,479
have a variant emerge that that escaped
 

9686
02:48:00,479 --> 02:48:02,389
have a variant emerge that that escaped
it and i think we can do the same thing

9687
02:48:02,389 --> 02:48:02,399
it and i think we can do the same thing
 

9688
02:48:02,399 --> 02:48:06,469
it and i think we can do the same thing
with with coronavirus too for sure

9689
02:48:06,469 --> 02:48:06,479
with with coronavirus too for sure
 

9690
02:48:06,479 --> 02:48:08,309
with with coronavirus too for sure
can i ask you about testing

9691
02:48:08,309 --> 02:48:08,319
can i ask you about testing
 

9692
02:48:08,319 --> 02:48:09,670
can i ask you about testing
sure

9693
02:48:09,670 --> 02:48:09,680
sure
 

9694
02:48:09,680 --> 02:48:11,670
sure
sure so you mentioned pcr what kind of

9695
02:48:11,670 --> 02:48:11,680
sure so you mentioned pcr what kind of
 

9696
02:48:11,680 --> 02:48:15,349
sure so you mentioned pcr what kind of
tests are there the antigen test

9697
02:48:15,349 --> 02:48:15,359
tests are there the antigen test
 

9698
02:48:15,359 --> 02:48:17,990
tests are there the antigen test
uh what what are your thoughts on each

9699
02:48:17,990 --> 02:48:18,000
uh what what are your thoughts on each
 

9700
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:20,150
uh what what are your thoughts on each
maybe this is a good place to uh to also

9701
02:48:20,150 --> 02:48:20,160
maybe this is a good place to uh to also
 

9702
02:48:20,160 --> 02:48:22,469
maybe this is a good place to uh to also
mention like viral load

9703
02:48:22,469 --> 02:48:22,479
mention like viral load
 

9704
02:48:22,479 --> 02:48:24,389
mention like viral load
and um

9705
02:48:24,389 --> 02:48:24,399
and um
 

9706
02:48:24,399 --> 02:48:26,710
and um
the history of the virus as it passes

9707
02:48:26,710 --> 02:48:26,720
the history of the virus as it passes
 

9708
02:48:26,720 --> 02:48:29,110
the history of the virus as it passes
through your body in terms of the

9709
02:48:29,110 --> 02:48:29,120
through your body in terms of the
 

9710
02:48:29,120 --> 02:48:31,349
through your body in terms of the
okay what's being tested for and all

9711
02:48:31,349 --> 02:48:31,359
okay what's being tested for and all
 

9712
02:48:31,359 --> 02:48:33,269
okay what's being tested for and all
those kinds of things

9713
02:48:33,269 --> 02:48:33,279
those kinds of things
 

9714
02:48:33,279 --> 02:48:35,510
those kinds of things
so the the first tests that were

9715
02:48:35,510 --> 02:48:35,520
so the the first tests that were
 

9716
02:48:35,520 --> 02:48:37,030
so the the first tests that were
developed

9717
02:48:37,030 --> 02:48:37,040
developed
 

9718
02:48:37,040 --> 02:48:38,309
developed
were

9719
02:48:38,309 --> 02:48:38,319
were
 

9720
02:48:38,319 --> 02:48:40,309
were
pcr polymerase chain reaction they're

9721
02:48:40,309 --> 02:48:40,319
pcr polymerase chain reaction they're
 

9722
02:48:40,319 --> 02:48:42,469
pcr polymerase chain reaction they're
basically nucleic acid amplification

9723
02:48:42,469 --> 02:48:42,479
basically nucleic acid amplification
 

9724
02:48:42,479 --> 02:48:43,590
basically nucleic acid amplification
tests

9725
02:48:43,590 --> 02:48:43,600
tests
 

9726
02:48:43,600 --> 02:48:45,030
tests
and they were very first ones they stuck

9727
02:48:45,030 --> 02:48:45,040
and they were very first ones they stuck
 

9728
02:48:45,040 --> 02:48:47,269
and they were very first ones they stuck
the swab all the way up into your brain

9729
02:48:47,269 --> 02:48:47,279
the swab all the way up into your brain
 

9730
02:48:47,279 --> 02:48:48,550
the swab all the way up into your brain
almost

9731
02:48:48,550 --> 02:48:48,560
almost
 

9732
02:48:48,560 --> 02:48:50,150
almost
you know i had that done a couple of

9733
02:48:50,150 --> 02:48:50,160
you know i had that done a couple of
 

9734
02:48:50,160 --> 02:48:53,269
you know i had that done a couple of
weeks ago oh my gosh it's really nasty

9735
02:48:53,269 --> 02:48:53,279
weeks ago oh my gosh it's really nasty
 

9736
02:48:53,279 --> 02:48:56,070
weeks ago oh my gosh it's really nasty
but now they do an interior nary swab

9737
02:48:56,070 --> 02:48:56,080
but now they do an interior nary swab
 

9738
02:48:56,080 --> 02:48:57,750
but now they do an interior nary swab
they get a little

9739
02:48:57,750 --> 02:48:57,760
they get a little
 

9740
02:48:57,760 --> 02:48:59,510
they get a little
they get a bunch of cells and some mucus

9741
02:48:59,510 --> 02:48:59,520
they get a bunch of cells and some mucus
 

9742
02:48:59,520 --> 02:49:01,349
they get a bunch of cells and some mucus
which has virus and

9743
02:49:01,349 --> 02:49:01,359
which has virus and
 

9744
02:49:01,359 --> 02:49:04,150
which has virus and
parts of virus stick it in a test tube

9745
02:49:04,150 --> 02:49:04,160
parts of virus stick it in a test tube
 

9746
02:49:04,160 --> 02:49:06,710
parts of virus stick it in a test tube
and then they run a reaction which by

9747
02:49:06,710 --> 02:49:06,720
and then they run a reaction which by
 

9748
02:49:06,720 --> 02:49:08,870
and then they run a reaction which by
the way involves reverse transcriptase

9749
02:49:08,870 --> 02:49:08,880
the way involves reverse transcriptase
 

9750
02:49:08,880 --> 02:49:11,830
the way involves reverse transcriptase
because it converts the viral rna to dna

9751
02:49:11,830 --> 02:49:11,840
because it converts the viral rna to dna
 

9752
02:49:11,840 --> 02:49:14,150
because it converts the viral rna to dna
and then you amplify it

9753
02:49:14,150 --> 02:49:14,160
and then you amplify it
 

9754
02:49:14,160 --> 02:49:15,710
and then you amplify it
and you can

9755
02:49:15,710 --> 02:49:15,720
and you can
 

9756
02:49:15,720 --> 02:49:18,950
and you can
specify what part of the viral rna you

9757
02:49:18,950 --> 02:49:18,960
specify what part of the viral rna you
 

9758
02:49:18,960 --> 02:49:21,030
specify what part of the viral rna you
want to amplify and then a machine will

9759
02:49:21,030 --> 02:49:21,040
want to amplify and then a machine will
 

9760
02:49:21,040 --> 02:49:22,389
want to amplify and then a machine will
detect it

9761
02:49:22,389 --> 02:49:22,399
detect it
 

9762
02:49:22,399 --> 02:49:25,190
detect it
and it can be done in 15 minutes

9763
02:49:25,190 --> 02:49:25,200
and it can be done in 15 minutes
 

9764
02:49:25,200 --> 02:49:27,750
and it can be done in 15 minutes
you're detecting pieces of rna not

9765
02:49:27,750 --> 02:49:27,760
you're detecting pieces of rna not
 

9766
02:49:27,760 --> 02:49:29,750
you're detecting pieces of rna not
infectious virus so we're measuring

9767
02:49:29,750 --> 02:49:29,760
infectious virus so we're measuring
 

9768
02:49:29,760 --> 02:49:32,309
infectious virus so we're measuring
viral rna loads right

9769
02:49:32,309 --> 02:49:32,319
viral rna loads right
 

9770
02:49:32,319 --> 02:49:34,230
viral rna loads right
and a common

9771
02:49:34,230 --> 02:49:34,240
and a common
 

9772
02:49:34,240 --> 02:49:36,389
and a common
mistake that many people who should know

9773
02:49:36,389 --> 02:49:36,399
mistake that many people who should know
 

9774
02:49:36,399 --> 02:49:37,910
mistake that many people who should know
better you know physicians and

9775
02:49:37,910 --> 02:49:37,920
better you know physicians and
 

9776
02:49:37,920 --> 02:49:40,550
better you know physicians and
scientists of all kinds they think that

9777
02:49:40,550 --> 02:49:40,560
scientists of all kinds they think that
 

9778
02:49:40,560 --> 02:49:43,510
scientists of all kinds they think that
indicates how much virus you have

9779
02:49:43,510 --> 02:49:43,520
indicates how much virus you have
 

9780
02:49:43,520 --> 02:49:44,870
indicates how much virus you have
it doesn't

9781
02:49:44,870 --> 02:49:44,880
it doesn't
 

9782
02:49:44,880 --> 02:49:47,429
it doesn't
it it's a diagnostic of whether you have

9783
02:49:47,429 --> 02:49:47,439
it it's a diagnostic of whether you have
 

9784
02:49:47,439 --> 02:49:49,349
it it's a diagnostic of whether you have
bits of rna in you and it

9785
02:49:49,349 --> 02:49:49,359
bits of rna in you and it
 

9786
02:49:49,359 --> 02:49:52,309
bits of rna in you and it
probably means you're infected but

9787
02:49:52,309 --> 02:49:52,319
probably means you're infected but
 

9788
02:49:52,319 --> 02:49:54,630
probably means you're infected but
you can't use it to shed light on what's

9789
02:49:54,630 --> 02:49:54,640
you can't use it to shed light on what's
 

9790
02:49:54,640 --> 02:49:56,710
you can't use it to shed light on what's
going on and i'll tell you why in a bit

9791
02:49:56,710 --> 02:49:56,720
going on and i'll tell you why in a bit
 

9792
02:49:56,720 --> 02:49:58,870
going on and i'll tell you why in a bit
but first we have to explain some other

9793
02:49:58,870 --> 02:49:58,880
but first we have to explain some other
 

9794
02:49:58,880 --> 02:50:01,910
but first we have to explain some other
things

9795
02:50:01,910 --> 02:50:01,920

 

9796
02:50:01,920 --> 02:50:04,309

so until you get to about a million

9797
02:50:04,309 --> 02:50:04,319
so until you get to about a million
 

9798
02:50:04,319 --> 02:50:05,830
so until you get to about a million
copies

9799
02:50:05,830 --> 02:50:05,840
copies
 

9800
02:50:05,840 --> 02:50:07,429
copies
of rna so you can measure the copy

9801
02:50:07,429 --> 02:50:07,439
of rna so you can measure the copy
 

9802
02:50:07,439 --> 02:50:10,550
of rna so you can measure the copy
number in this test this pcr test

9803
02:50:10,550 --> 02:50:10,560
number in this test this pcr test
 

9804
02:50:10,560 --> 02:50:12,870
number in this test this pcr test
it's it's it's a number called ct or

9805
02:50:12,870 --> 02:50:12,880
it's it's it's a number called ct or
 

9806
02:50:12,880 --> 02:50:14,710
it's it's it's a number called ct or
cycle threshold the test the way the

9807
02:50:14,710 --> 02:50:14,720
cycle threshold the test the way the
 

9808
02:50:14,720 --> 02:50:16,389
cycle threshold the test the way the
machine works it goes through cycles in

9809
02:50:16,389 --> 02:50:16,399
machine works it goes through cycles in
 

9810
02:50:16,399 --> 02:50:18,389
machine works it goes through cycles in
every cycle it amplifies

9811
02:50:18,389 --> 02:50:18,399
every cycle it amplifies
 

9812
02:50:18,399 --> 02:50:19,910
every cycle it amplifies
what you put in

9813
02:50:19,910 --> 02:50:19,920
what you put in
 

9814
02:50:19,920 --> 02:50:20,950
what you put in
and

9815
02:50:20,950 --> 02:50:20,960
and
 

9816
02:50:20,960 --> 02:50:23,269
and
the more cycles you need to see

9817
02:50:23,269 --> 02:50:23,279
the more cycles you need to see
 

9818
02:50:23,279 --> 02:50:25,110
the more cycles you need to see
something that means there's not a lot

9819
02:50:25,110 --> 02:50:25,120
something that means there's not a lot
 

9820
02:50:25,120 --> 02:50:26,550
something that means there's not a lot
of rna there

9821
02:50:26,550 --> 02:50:26,560
of rna there
 

9822
02:50:26,560 --> 02:50:28,550
of rna there
so if you see a if you do a test and you

9823
02:50:28,550 --> 02:50:28,560
so if you see a if you do a test and you
 

9824
02:50:28,560 --> 02:50:30,950
so if you see a if you do a test and you
have a cycle threshold of 35

9825
02:50:30,950 --> 02:50:30,960
have a cycle threshold of 35
 

9826
02:50:30,960 --> 02:50:33,590
have a cycle threshold of 35
you have very little rna in you

9827
02:50:33,590 --> 02:50:33,600
you have very little rna in you
 

9828
02:50:33,600 --> 02:50:35,750
you have very little rna in you
contrary if you have a cycle threshold

9829
02:50:35,750 --> 02:50:35,760
contrary if you have a cycle threshold
 

9830
02:50:35,760 --> 02:50:37,910
contrary if you have a cycle threshold
of 10 you have a ton of rna it only took

9831
02:50:37,910 --> 02:50:37,920
of 10 you have a ton of rna it only took
 

9832
02:50:37,920 --> 02:50:40,550
of 10 you have a ton of rna it only took
10 cycles to detect it

9833
02:50:40,550 --> 02:50:40,560
10 cycles to detect it
 

9834
02:50:40,560 --> 02:50:42,710
10 cycles to detect it
and you can extrapolate from that number

9835
02:50:42,710 --> 02:50:42,720
and you can extrapolate from that number
 

9836
02:50:42,720 --> 02:50:45,269
and you can extrapolate from that number
the number of copies you have per sample

9837
02:50:45,269 --> 02:50:45,279
the number of copies you have per sample
 

9838
02:50:45,279 --> 02:50:46,790
the number of copies you have per sample
say per swap and if you don't have a

9839
02:50:46,790 --> 02:50:46,800
say per swap and if you don't have a
 

9840
02:50:46,800 --> 02:50:49,269
say per swap and if you don't have a
million you're not infectious you're not

9841
02:50:49,269 --> 02:50:49,279
million you're not infectious you're not
 

9842
02:50:49,279 --> 02:50:51,190
million you're not infectious you're not
going to infect anyone so in the early

9843
02:50:51,190 --> 02:50:51,200
going to infect anyone so in the early
 

9844
02:50:51,200 --> 02:50:53,990
going to infect anyone so in the early
days no matter what ct whatever what pcr

9845
02:50:53,990 --> 02:50:54,000
days no matter what ct whatever what pcr
 

9846
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:55,830
days no matter what ct whatever what pcr
result you had they would quarantine you

9847
02:50:55,830 --> 02:50:55,840
result you had they would quarantine you
 

9848
02:50:55,840 --> 02:50:57,830
result you had they would quarantine you
and that was wrong because you're not

9849
02:50:57,830 --> 02:50:57,840
and that was wrong because you're not
 

9850
02:50:57,840 --> 02:50:58,870
and that was wrong because you're not
shedding you don't need to be

9851
02:50:58,870 --> 02:50:58,880
shedding you don't need to be
 

9852
02:50:58,880 --> 02:51:00,710
shedding you don't need to be
quarantined but but

9853
02:51:00,710 --> 02:51:00,720
quarantined but but
 

9854
02:51:00,720 --> 02:51:02,630
quarantined but but
wasn't thought through properly right

9855
02:51:02,630 --> 02:51:02,640
wasn't thought through properly right
 

9856
02:51:02,640 --> 02:51:04,550
wasn't thought through properly right
that's where you had like 14 days or

9857
02:51:04,550 --> 02:51:04,560
that's where you had like 14 days or
 

9858
02:51:04,560 --> 02:51:06,309
that's where you had like 14 days or
something like that

9859
02:51:06,309 --> 02:51:06,319
something like that
 

9860
02:51:06,319 --> 02:51:08,070
something like that
which is now we know is too long because

9861
02:51:08,070 --> 02:51:08,080
which is now we know is too long because
 

9862
02:51:08,080 --> 02:51:09,349
which is now we know is too long because
you don't shed

9863
02:51:09,349 --> 02:51:09,359
you don't shed
 

9864
02:51:09,359 --> 02:51:11,670
you don't shed
for that long in a normal infection now

9865
02:51:11,670 --> 02:51:11,680
for that long in a normal infection now
 

9866
02:51:11,680 --> 02:51:13,990
for that long in a normal infection now
it's 10 days should be fine

9867
02:51:13,990 --> 02:51:14,000
it's 10 days should be fine
 

9868
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:16,150
it's 10 days should be fine
so what happens is you get infected you

9869
02:51:16,150 --> 02:51:16,160
so what happens is you get infected you
 

9870
02:51:16,160 --> 02:51:18,309
so what happens is you get infected you
don't know it of course the virus starts

9871
02:51:18,309 --> 02:51:18,319
don't know it of course the virus starts
 

9872
02:51:18,319 --> 02:51:20,389
don't know it of course the virus starts
to grow very quickly and within four or

9873
02:51:20,389 --> 02:51:20,399
to grow very quickly and within four or
 

9874
02:51:20,399 --> 02:51:21,830
to grow very quickly and within four or
five days

9875
02:51:21,830 --> 02:51:21,840
five days
 

9876
02:51:21,840 --> 02:51:23,510
five days
you reach a peak

9877
02:51:23,510 --> 02:51:23,520
you reach a peak
 

9878
02:51:23,520 --> 02:51:24,230
you reach a peak
of

9879
02:51:24,230 --> 02:51:24,240
of
 

9880
02:51:24,240 --> 02:51:26,550
of
shedding you're making a lot of rna

9881
02:51:26,550 --> 02:51:26,560
shedding you're making a lot of rna
 

9882
02:51:26,560 --> 02:51:28,309
shedding you're making a lot of rna
and you may be asymptomatic you're

9883
02:51:28,309 --> 02:51:28,319
and you may be asymptomatic you're
 

9884
02:51:28,319 --> 02:51:30,309
and you may be asymptomatic you're
shedding it can affect others and then

9885
02:51:30,309 --> 02:51:30,319
shedding it can affect others and then
 

9886
02:51:30,319 --> 02:51:32,070
shedding it can affect others and then
you may or may not have your symptom

9887
02:51:32,070 --> 02:51:32,080
you may or may not have your symptom
 

9888
02:51:32,080 --> 02:51:33,830
you may or may not have your symptom
onset

9889
02:51:33,830 --> 02:51:33,840
onset
 

9890
02:51:33,840 --> 02:51:35,510
onset
so you shed for a couple of days before

9891
02:51:35,510 --> 02:51:35,520
so you shed for a couple of days before
 

9892
02:51:35,520 --> 02:51:37,590
so you shed for a couple of days before
symptoms and then within three days four

9893
02:51:37,590 --> 02:51:37,600
symptoms and then within three days four
 

9894
02:51:37,600 --> 02:51:38,469
symptoms and then within three days four
days

9895
02:51:38,469 --> 02:51:38,479
days
 

9896
02:51:38,479 --> 02:51:40,150
days
the viral rna crashes and you're no

9897
02:51:40,150 --> 02:51:40,160
the viral rna crashes and you're no
 

9898
02:51:40,160 --> 02:51:41,990
the viral rna crashes and you're no
longer shedding you're no longer

9899
02:51:41,990 --> 02:51:42,000
longer shedding you're no longer
 

9900
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:43,830
longer shedding you're no longer
transmitting so that's the one kind of

9901
02:51:43,830 --> 02:51:43,840
transmitting so that's the one kind of
 

9902
02:51:43,840 --> 02:51:45,349
transmitting so that's the one kind of
test we have it can tell you if you're

9903
02:51:45,349 --> 02:51:45,359
test we have it can tell you if you're
 

9904
02:51:45,359 --> 02:51:47,510
test we have it can tell you if you're
infected at the moment

9905
02:51:47,510 --> 02:51:47,520
infected at the moment
 

9906
02:51:47,520 --> 02:51:48,950
infected at the moment
but it won't tell you

9907
02:51:48,950 --> 02:51:48,960
but it won't tell you
 

9908
02:51:48,960 --> 02:51:50,710
but it won't tell you
if you're going to be infected tomorrow

9909
02:51:50,710 --> 02:51:50,720
if you're going to be infected tomorrow
 

9910
02:51:50,720 --> 02:51:52,550
if you're going to be infected tomorrow
right because if you're negative today

9911
02:51:52,550 --> 02:51:52,560
right because if you're negative today
 

9912
02:51:52,560 --> 02:51:54,389
right because if you're negative today
you could be positive tomorrow you just

9913
02:51:54,389 --> 02:51:54,399
you could be positive tomorrow you just
 

9914
02:51:54,399 --> 02:51:56,150
you could be positive tomorrow you just
might be on in a different part of the

9915
02:51:56,150 --> 02:51:56,160
might be on in a different part of the
 

9916
02:51:56,160 --> 02:51:58,150
might be on in a different part of the
incubation period right

9917
02:51:58,150 --> 02:51:58,160
incubation period right
 

9918
02:51:58,160 --> 02:51:59,590
incubation period right
so that's one test

9919
02:51:59,590 --> 02:51:59,600
so that's one test
 

9920
02:51:59,600 --> 02:52:03,110
so that's one test
been used the most you can now

9921
02:52:03,110 --> 02:52:03,120
been used the most you can now
 

9922
02:52:03,120 --> 02:52:05,110
been used the most you can now
get 15-minute versions of them in a

9923
02:52:05,110 --> 02:52:05,120
get 15-minute versions of them in a
 

9924
02:52:05,120 --> 02:52:07,110
get 15-minute versions of them in a
walk-in or whatever fine then there are

9925
02:52:07,110 --> 02:52:07,120
walk-in or whatever fine then there are
 

9926
02:52:07,120 --> 02:52:08,710
walk-in or whatever fine then there are
antigen tests which look for the

9927
02:52:08,710 --> 02:52:08,720
antigen tests which look for the
 

9928
02:52:08,720 --> 02:52:11,830
antigen tests which look for the
proteins that the virus is making so as

9929
02:52:11,830 --> 02:52:11,840
proteins that the virus is making so as
 

9930
02:52:11,840 --> 02:52:13,590
proteins that the virus is making so as
it's reproducing in your nose it's not

9931
02:52:13,590 --> 02:52:13,600
it's reproducing in your nose it's not
 

9932
02:52:13,600 --> 02:52:15,990
it's reproducing in your nose it's not
only making genomes it's making proteins

9933
02:52:15,990 --> 02:52:16,000
only making genomes it's making proteins
 

9934
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:17,110
only making genomes it's making proteins
and so these you can buy in the

9935
02:52:17,110 --> 02:52:17,120
and so these you can buy in the
 

9936
02:52:17,120 --> 02:52:19,349
and so these you can buy in the
drugstore and

9937
02:52:19,349 --> 02:52:19,359
drugstore and
 

9938
02:52:19,359 --> 02:52:21,830
drugstore and
these would have been great if they had

9939
02:52:21,830 --> 02:52:21,840
these would have been great if they had
 

9940
02:52:21,840 --> 02:52:23,830
these would have been great if they had
you know michael minna last year had the

9941
02:52:23,830 --> 02:52:23,840
you know michael minna last year had the
 

9942
02:52:23,840 --> 02:52:25,990
you know michael minna last year had the
idea that if we could make a little

9943
02:52:25,990 --> 02:52:26,000
idea that if we could make a little
 

9944
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:27,750
idea that if we could make a little
stick a little piece of paper that you

9945
02:52:27,750 --> 02:52:27,760
stick a little piece of paper that you
 

9946
02:52:27,760 --> 02:52:29,349
stick a little piece of paper that you
would suck on and it would tell you if

9947
02:52:29,349 --> 02:52:29,359
would suck on and it would tell you if
 

9948
02:52:29,359 --> 02:52:30,710
would suck on and it would tell you if
you're infected or not if this could

9949
02:52:30,710 --> 02:52:30,720
you're infected or not if this could
 

9950
02:52:30,720 --> 02:52:32,469
you're infected or not if this could
cost less than a buck

9951
02:52:32,469 --> 02:52:32,479
cost less than a buck
 

9952
02:52:32,479 --> 02:52:34,870
cost less than a buck
everybody could test which they can cost

9953
02:52:34,870 --> 02:52:34,880
everybody could test which they can cost
 

9954
02:52:34,880 --> 02:52:36,950
everybody could test which they can cost
less than a buck by the way

9955
02:52:36,950 --> 02:52:36,960
less than a buck by the way
 

9956
02:52:36,960 --> 02:52:38,710
less than a buck by the way
yeah but they were never made right

9957
02:52:38,710 --> 02:52:38,720
yeah but they were never made right
 

9958
02:52:38,720 --> 02:52:39,830
yeah but they were never made right
right

9959
02:52:39,830 --> 02:52:39,840
right
 

9960
02:52:39,840 --> 02:52:40,710
right
uh

9961
02:52:40,710 --> 02:52:40,720
uh
 

9962
02:52:40,720 --> 02:52:42,950
uh
they're never mass manufactured so his

9963
02:52:42,950 --> 02:52:42,960
they're never mass manufactured so his
 

9964
02:52:42,960 --> 02:52:45,349
they're never mass manufactured so his
idea is to do like daily tests so yeah

9965
02:52:45,349 --> 02:52:45,359
idea is to do like daily tests so yeah
 

9966
02:52:45,359 --> 02:52:47,269
idea is to do like daily tests so yeah
daily and then the kid's going to school

9967
02:52:47,269 --> 02:52:47,279
daily and then the kid's going to school
 

9968
02:52:47,279 --> 02:52:49,750
daily and then the kid's going to school
he's positive or she's positive

9969
02:52:49,750 --> 02:52:49,760
he's positive or she's positive
 

9970
02:52:49,760 --> 02:52:51,030
he's positive or she's positive
well if it's cheap enough you just take

9971
02:52:51,030 --> 02:52:51,040
well if it's cheap enough you just take
 

9972
02:52:51,040 --> 02:52:52,630
well if it's cheap enough you just take
another test because they have a certain

9973
02:52:52,630 --> 02:52:52,640
another test because they have a certain
 

9974
02:52:52,640 --> 02:52:54,630
another test because they have a certain
error frequency if it's positive twice

9975
02:52:54,630 --> 02:52:54,640
error frequency if it's positive twice
 

9976
02:52:54,640 --> 02:52:56,230
error frequency if it's positive twice
you stay home and the next day you try

9977
02:52:56,230 --> 02:52:56,240
you stay home and the next day you try
 

9978
02:52:56,240 --> 02:52:57,110
you stay home and the next day you try
again

9979
02:52:57,110 --> 02:52:57,120
again
 

9980
02:52:57,120 --> 02:52:58,790
again
and this i think this would have

9981
02:52:58,790 --> 02:52:58,800
and this i think this would have
 

9982
02:52:58,800 --> 02:53:01,030
and this i think this would have
revolutionized because the pcr tests are

9983
02:53:01,030 --> 02:53:01,040
revolutionized because the pcr tests are
 

9984
02:53:01,040 --> 02:53:03,110
revolutionized because the pcr tests are
more expensive at the time and they take

9985
02:53:03,110 --> 02:53:03,120
more expensive at the time and they take
 

9986
02:53:03,120 --> 02:53:05,269
more expensive at the time and they take
longer to do and so forth

9987
02:53:05,269 --> 02:53:05,279
longer to do and so forth
 

9988
02:53:05,279 --> 02:53:06,230
longer to do and so forth
but

9989
02:53:06,230 --> 02:53:06,240
but
 

9990
02:53:06,240 --> 02:53:07,750
but
it never happened but now we do have

9991
02:53:07,750 --> 02:53:07,760
it never happened but now we do have
 

9992
02:53:07,760 --> 02:53:10,070
it never happened but now we do have
twenty dollar binax now and others that

9993
02:53:10,070 --> 02:53:10,080
twenty dollar binax now and others that
 

9994
02:53:10,080 --> 02:53:12,309
twenty dollar binax now and others that
you can buy and people buy them and see

9995
02:53:12,309 --> 02:53:12,319
you can buy and people buy them and see
 

9996
02:53:12,319 --> 02:53:14,469
you can buy and people buy them and see
but that can still happen right and this

9997
02:53:14,469 --> 02:53:14,479
but that can still happen right and this
 

9998
02:53:14,479 --> 02:53:15,990
but that can still happen right and this
is a very frustrating thing to me

9999
02:53:15,990 --> 02:53:16,000
is a very frustrating thing to me
 

10000
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:16,950
is a very frustrating thing to me
because

10001
02:53:16,950 --> 02:53:16,960
because
 

10002
02:53:16,960 --> 02:53:19,429
because
i'm worried about variance but i'm also

10003
02:53:19,429 --> 02:53:19,439
i'm worried about variance but i'm also
 

10004
02:53:19,439 --> 02:53:21,830
i'm worried about variance but i'm also
worried about future much more deadly

10005
02:53:21,830 --> 02:53:21,840
worried about future much more deadly
 

10006
02:53:21,840 --> 02:53:23,510
worried about future much more deadly
pandemics

10007
02:53:23,510 --> 02:53:23,520
pandemics
 

10008
02:53:23,520 --> 02:53:24,950
pandemics
like

10009
02:53:24,950 --> 02:53:24,960
like
 

10010
02:53:24,960 --> 02:53:27,269
like
i know we kind of said yes covey lots of

10011
02:53:27,269 --> 02:53:27,279
i know we kind of said yes covey lots of
 

10012
02:53:27,279 --> 02:53:28,309
i know we kind of said yes covey lots of
deaths

10013
02:53:28,309 --> 02:53:28,319
deaths
 

10014
02:53:28,319 --> 02:53:30,469
deaths
but like it could be a lot worse

10015
02:53:30,469 --> 02:53:30,479
but like it could be a lot worse
 

10016
02:53:30,479 --> 02:53:33,590
but like it could be a lot worse
too and so i'm thinking

10017
02:53:33,590 --> 02:53:33,600
too and so i'm thinking
 

10018
02:53:33,600 --> 02:53:35,670
too and so i'm thinking
what is going to be the right response

10019
02:53:35,670 --> 02:53:35,680
what is going to be the right response
 

10020
02:53:35,680 --> 02:53:36,950
what is going to be the right response
for the future

10021
02:53:36,950 --> 02:53:36,960
for the future
 

10022
02:53:36,960 --> 02:53:39,030
for the future
pandemic of its kind and what's the

10023
02:53:39,030 --> 02:53:39,040
pandemic of its kind and what's the
 

10024
02:53:39,040 --> 02:53:41,030
pandemic of its kind and what's the
right response for continued number of

10025
02:53:41,030 --> 02:53:41,040
right response for continued number of
 

10026
02:53:41,040 --> 02:53:42,550
right response for continued number of
variants and some of the variants might

10027
02:53:42,550 --> 02:53:42,560
variants and some of the variants might
 

10028
02:53:42,560 --> 02:53:44,469
variants and some of the variants might
be deadlier

10029
02:53:44,469 --> 02:53:44,479
be deadlier
 

10030
02:53:44,479 --> 02:53:47,590
be deadlier
or more transmissible well we we can the

10031
02:53:47,590 --> 02:53:47,600
or more transmissible well we we can the
 

10032
02:53:47,600 --> 02:53:48,790
or more transmissible well we we can the
antigen

10033
02:53:48,790 --> 02:53:48,800
antigen
 

10034
02:53:48,800 --> 02:53:50,070
antigen
tests

10035
02:53:50,070 --> 02:53:50,080
tests
 

10036
02:53:50,080 --> 02:53:51,110
tests
will pick up

10037
02:53:51,110 --> 02:53:51,120
will pick up
 

10038
02:53:51,120 --> 02:53:52,630
will pick up
the variance that's not a question the

10039
02:53:52,630 --> 02:53:52,640
the variance that's not a question the
 

10040
02:53:52,640 --> 02:53:55,269
the variance that's not a question the
pcr may be influenced by changes but you

10041
02:53:55,269 --> 02:53:55,279
pcr may be influenced by changes but you
 

10042
02:53:55,279 --> 02:53:58,150
pcr may be influenced by changes but you
can quickly adapt the primers that you

10043
02:53:58,150 --> 02:53:58,160
can quickly adapt the primers that you
 

10044
02:53:58,160 --> 02:53:59,830
can quickly adapt the primers that you
use that's what i mean like to me all

10045
02:53:59,830 --> 02:53:59,840
use that's what i mean like to me all
 

10046
02:53:59,840 --> 02:54:02,070
use that's what i mean like to me all
these discussions about vaccines and so

10047
02:54:02,070 --> 02:54:02,080
these discussions about vaccines and so
 

10048
02:54:02,080 --> 02:54:03,349
these discussions about vaccines and so
on

10049
02:54:03,349 --> 02:54:03,359
on
 

10050
02:54:03,359 --> 02:54:05,190
on
vaccines we got very lucky that they

10051
02:54:05,190 --> 02:54:05,200
vaccines we got very lucky that they
 

10052
02:54:05,200 --> 02:54:07,990
vaccines we got very lucky that they
took so little time right

10053
02:54:07,990 --> 02:54:08,000
took so little time right
 

10054
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:10,150
took so little time right
and and you have to be aware no matter

10055
02:54:10,150 --> 02:54:10,160
and and you have to be aware no matter
 

10056
02:54:10,160 --> 02:54:11,670
and and you have to be aware no matter
what that there's hesitancy with the

10057
02:54:11,670 --> 02:54:11,680
what that there's hesitancy with the
 

10058
02:54:11,680 --> 02:54:13,910
what that there's hesitancy with the
vaccines in this country before i mean

10059
02:54:13,910 --> 02:54:13,920
vaccines in this country before i mean
 

10060
02:54:13,920 --> 02:54:15,990
vaccines in this country before i mean
yeah if that's a reality you can't just

10061
02:54:15,990 --> 02:54:16,000
yeah if that's a reality you can't just
 

10062
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:18,150
yeah if that's a reality you can't just
be like magically saying that

10063
02:54:18,150 --> 02:54:18,160
be like magically saying that
 

10064
02:54:18,160 --> 02:54:20,389
be like magically saying that
right you're going to overcome that

10065
02:54:20,389 --> 02:54:20,399
right you're going to overcome that
 

10066
02:54:20,399 --> 02:54:22,150
right you're going to overcome that
and i don't think there's any hesitancy

10067
02:54:22,150 --> 02:54:22,160
and i don't think there's any hesitancy
 

10068
02:54:22,160 --> 02:54:23,910
and i don't think there's any hesitancy
and cheap tests at home

10069
02:54:23,910 --> 02:54:23,920
and cheap tests at home
 

10070
02:54:23,920 --> 02:54:26,550
and cheap tests at home
i agree i think if someone so the

10071
02:54:26,550 --> 02:54:26,560
i agree i think if someone so the
 

10072
02:54:26,560 --> 02:54:28,150
i agree i think if someone so the
question is if someone tested positive

10073
02:54:28,150 --> 02:54:28,160
question is if someone tested positive
 

10074
02:54:28,160 --> 02:54:29,750
question is if someone tested positive
would they stay home that's the question

10075
02:54:29,750 --> 02:54:29,760
would they stay home that's the question
 

10076
02:54:29,760 --> 02:54:31,429
would they stay home that's the question
what if their what if their job depends

10077
02:54:31,429 --> 02:54:31,439
what if their what if their job depends
 

10078
02:54:31,439 --> 02:54:33,590
what if their what if their job depends
on them going in i i mean that's well

10079
02:54:33,590 --> 02:54:33,600
on them going in i i mean that's well
 

10080
02:54:33,600 --> 02:54:36,309
on them going in i i mean that's well
you have to look at sort of aggregate

10081
02:54:36,309 --> 02:54:36,319
you have to look at sort of aggregate
 

10082
02:54:36,319 --> 02:54:38,389
you have to look at sort of aggregate
yeah how many people would decide and i

10083
02:54:38,389 --> 02:54:38,399
yeah how many people would decide and i
 

10084
02:54:38,399 --> 02:54:39,830
yeah how many people would decide and i
think

10085
02:54:39,830 --> 02:54:39,840
think
 

10086
02:54:39,840 --> 02:54:41,190
think
um

10087
02:54:41,190 --> 02:54:41,200
um
 

10088
02:54:41,200 --> 02:54:43,110
um
again a lot of that is in leadership but

10089
02:54:43,110 --> 02:54:43,120
again a lot of that is in leadership but
 

10090
02:54:43,120 --> 02:54:45,349
again a lot of that is in leadership but
i think a lot of them mo i would say

10091
02:54:45,349 --> 02:54:45,359
i think a lot of them mo i would say
 

10092
02:54:45,359 --> 02:54:47,030
i think a lot of them mo i would say
most people stay home

10093
02:54:47,030 --> 02:54:47,040
most people stay home
 

10094
02:54:47,040 --> 02:54:49,590
most people stay home
i think that mina had the idea and it

10095
02:54:49,590 --> 02:54:49,600
i think that mina had the idea and it
 

10096
02:54:49,600 --> 02:54:51,510
i think that mina had the idea and it
would have changed the whole

10097
02:54:51,510 --> 02:54:51,520
would have changed the whole
 

10098
02:54:51,520 --> 02:54:53,910
would have changed the whole
situation for sure if it could have been

10099
02:54:53,910 --> 02:54:53,920
situation for sure if it could have been
 

10100
02:54:53,920 --> 02:54:56,230
situation for sure if it could have been
made when we talked to him last spring i

10101
02:54:56,230 --> 02:54:56,240
made when we talked to him last spring i
 

10102
02:54:56,240 --> 02:54:58,550
made when we talked to him last spring i
think or summer

10103
02:54:58,550 --> 02:54:58,560
think or summer
 

10104
02:54:58,560 --> 02:55:00,309
think or summer
we would have gotten around a lot of the

10105
02:55:00,309 --> 02:55:00,319
we would have gotten around a lot of the
 

10106
02:55:00,319 --> 02:55:01,830
we would have gotten around a lot of the
issues that we're in today because i

10107
02:55:01,830 --> 02:55:01,840
issues that we're in today because i
 

10108
02:55:01,840 --> 02:55:03,110
issues that we're in today because i
think people would have stayed home and

10109
02:55:03,110 --> 02:55:03,120
think people would have stayed home and
 

10110
02:55:03,120 --> 02:55:04,790
think people would have stayed home and
not transmitted and i think it's still

10111
02:55:04,790 --> 02:55:04,800
not transmitted and i think it's still
 

10112
02:55:04,800 --> 02:55:07,990
not transmitted and i think it's still
valuable to this day in the fall if we

10113
02:55:07,990 --> 02:55:08,000
valuable to this day in the fall if we
 

10114
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:10,389
valuable to this day in the fall if we
don't have vaccine uptake we could just

10115
02:55:10,389 --> 02:55:10,399
don't have vaccine uptake we could just
 

10116
02:55:10,399 --> 02:55:12,710
don't have vaccine uptake we could just
test kids every day yeah and get them

10117
02:55:12,710 --> 02:55:12,720
test kids every day yeah and get them
 

10118
02:55:12,720 --> 02:55:14,150
test kids every day yeah and get them
and keep them home when they're infected

10119
02:55:14,150 --> 02:55:14,160
and keep them home when they're infected
 

10120
02:55:14,160 --> 02:55:15,269
and keep them home when they're infected
it cuts

10121
02:55:15,269 --> 02:55:15,279
it cuts
 

10122
02:55:15,279 --> 02:55:17,510
it cuts
it's and we don't have it

10123
02:55:17,510 --> 02:55:17,520
it's and we don't have it
 

10124
02:55:17,520 --> 02:55:19,830
it's and we don't have it
but i think and i'm not privy to what

10125
02:55:19,830 --> 02:55:19,840
but i think and i'm not privy to what
 

10126
02:55:19,840 --> 02:55:21,590
but i think and i'm not privy to what
was going on but

10127
02:55:21,590 --> 02:55:21,600
was going on but
 

10128
02:55:21,600 --> 02:55:23,429
was going on but
i don't think a lot of emphasis was put

10129
02:55:23,429 --> 02:55:23,439
i don't think a lot of emphasis was put
 

10130
02:55:23,439 --> 02:55:25,990
i don't think a lot of emphasis was put
on testing early on you know the cdc

10131
02:55:25,990 --> 02:55:26,000
on testing early on you know the cdc
 

10132
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:27,750
on testing early on you know the cdc
developed the first one it was flawed

10133
02:55:27,750 --> 02:55:27,760
developed the first one it was flawed
 

10134
02:55:27,760 --> 02:55:29,429
developed the first one it was flawed
they had to recall the kits i mean

10135
02:55:29,429 --> 02:55:29,439
they had to recall the kits i mean
 

10136
02:55:29,439 --> 02:55:31,269
they had to recall the kits i mean
there's a fiasco they should have had

10137
02:55:31,269 --> 02:55:31,279
there's a fiasco they should have had
 

10138
02:55:31,279 --> 02:55:33,590
there's a fiasco they should have had
100 companies making the tests initially

10139
02:55:33,590 --> 02:55:33,600
100 companies making the tests initially
 

10140
02:55:33,600 --> 02:55:34,630
100 companies making the tests initially
right

10141
02:55:34,630 --> 02:55:34,640
right
 

10142
02:55:34,640 --> 02:55:36,230
right
so for the future

10143
02:55:36,230 --> 02:55:36,240
so for the future
 

10144
02:55:36,240 --> 02:55:38,309
so for the future
i think what we have learned is we need

10145
02:55:38,309 --> 02:55:38,319
i think what we have learned is we need
 

10146
02:55:38,319 --> 02:55:40,790
i think what we have learned is we need
to have a rapid antigen test right off

10147
02:55:40,790 --> 02:55:40,800
to have a rapid antigen test right off
 

10148
02:55:40,800 --> 02:55:42,150
to have a rapid antigen test right off
the bat

10149
02:55:42,150 --> 02:55:42,160
the bat
 

10150
02:55:42,160 --> 02:55:43,510
the bat
that's doable

10151
02:55:43,510 --> 02:55:43,520
that's doable
 

10152
02:55:43,520 --> 02:55:45,349
that's doable
you can't do it in a day like you can

10153
02:55:45,349 --> 02:55:45,359
you can't do it in a day like you can
 

10154
02:55:45,359 --> 02:55:47,590
you can't do it in a day like you can
for pcr because

10155
02:55:47,590 --> 02:55:47,600
for pcr because
 

10156
02:55:47,600 --> 02:55:49,750
for pcr because
you need to make antibodies to the

10157
02:55:49,750 --> 02:55:49,760
you need to make antibodies to the
 

10158
02:55:49,760 --> 02:55:51,429
you need to make antibodies to the
protein that you're looking for and you

10159
02:55:51,429 --> 02:55:51,439
protein that you're looking for and you
 

10160
02:55:51,439 --> 02:55:53,670
protein that you're looking for and you
need to do those and animals but you can

10161
02:55:53,670 --> 02:55:53,680
need to do those and animals but you can
 

10162
02:55:53,680 --> 02:55:55,429
need to do those and animals but you can
do it in weeks

10163
02:55:55,429 --> 02:55:55,439
do it in weeks
 

10164
02:55:55,439 --> 02:55:57,590
do it in weeks
and we should be ready for that

10165
02:55:57,590 --> 02:55:57,600
and we should be ready for that
 

10166
02:55:57,600 --> 02:55:59,349
and we should be ready for that
yeah because

10167
02:55:59,349 --> 02:55:59,359
yeah because
 

10168
02:55:59,359 --> 02:56:00,870
yeah because
i mean to me that's obvious that's

10169
02:56:00,870 --> 02:56:00,880
i mean to me that's obvious that's
 

10170
02:56:00,880 --> 02:56:03,349
i mean to me that's obvious that's
obviously the best solution uh second to

10171
02:56:03,349 --> 02:56:03,359
obviously the best solution uh second to
 

10172
02:56:03,359 --> 02:56:06,230
obviously the best solution uh second to
that if we understood how well masks

10173
02:56:06,230 --> 02:56:06,240
that if we understood how well masks
 

10174
02:56:06,240 --> 02:56:08,389
that if we understood how well masks
work

10175
02:56:08,389 --> 02:56:08,399
work
 

10176
02:56:08,399 --> 02:56:09,429
work
like

10177
02:56:09,429 --> 02:56:09,439
like
 

10178
02:56:09,439 --> 02:56:11,349
like
maybe let me ask you this question let's

10179
02:56:11,349 --> 02:56:11,359
maybe let me ask you this question let's
 

10180
02:56:11,359 --> 02:56:13,990
maybe let me ask you this question let's
put masks aside

10181
02:56:13,990 --> 02:56:14,000
put masks aside
 

10182
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:16,550
put masks aside
how will do we understand how covet is

10183
02:56:16,550 --> 02:56:16,560
how will do we understand how covet is
 

10184
02:56:16,560 --> 02:56:17,990
how will do we understand how covet is
transmitted

10185
02:56:17,990 --> 02:56:18,000
transmitted
 

10186
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:20,070
transmitted
there's there's droplets of different

10187
02:56:20,070 --> 02:56:20,080
there's there's droplets of different
 

10188
02:56:20,080 --> 02:56:21,590
there's there's droplets of different
sizes

10189
02:56:21,590 --> 02:56:21,600
sizes
 

10190
02:56:21,600 --> 02:56:26,389
sizes
uh aerosols tiny tiny droplets

10191
02:56:26,389 --> 02:56:26,399
uh aerosols tiny tiny droplets
 

10192
02:56:26,399 --> 02:56:28,150
uh aerosols tiny tiny droplets
it seems like that's a very difficult

10193
02:56:28,150 --> 02:56:28,160
it seems like that's a very difficult
 

10194
02:56:28,160 --> 02:56:30,469
it seems like that's a very difficult
thing to understand thoroughly

10195
02:56:30,469 --> 02:56:30,479
thing to understand thoroughly
 

10196
02:56:30,479 --> 02:56:32,550
thing to understand thoroughly
uh so it seems like it's transmitted

10197
02:56:32,550 --> 02:56:32,560
uh so it seems like it's transmitted
 

10198
02:56:32,560 --> 02:56:33,990
uh so it seems like it's transmitted
both ways

10199
02:56:33,990 --> 02:56:34,000
both ways
 

10200
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:36,469
both ways
it's unclear how exactly

10201
02:56:36,469 --> 02:56:36,479
it's unclear how exactly
 

10202
02:56:36,479 --> 02:56:39,349
it's unclear how exactly
so how how how much do we understand

10203
02:56:39,349 --> 02:56:39,359
so how how how much do we understand
 

10204
02:56:39,359 --> 02:56:40,870
so how how how much do we understand
and why is it so difficult to understand

10205
02:56:40,870 --> 02:56:40,880
and why is it so difficult to understand
 

10206
02:56:40,880 --> 02:56:43,349
and why is it so difficult to understand
hopefully i think it's clear that it's

10207
02:56:43,349 --> 02:56:43,359
hopefully i think it's clear that it's
 

10208
02:56:43,359 --> 02:56:44,950
hopefully i think it's clear that it's
transmitted through the air

10209
02:56:44,950 --> 02:56:44,960
transmitted through the air
 

10210
02:56:44,960 --> 02:56:47,429
transmitted through the air
mostly it's not touching we thought

10211
02:56:47,429 --> 02:56:47,439
mostly it's not touching we thought
 

10212
02:56:47,439 --> 02:56:49,349
mostly it's not touching we thought
initially it would be a lot of touch but

10213
02:56:49,349 --> 02:56:49,359
initially it would be a lot of touch but
 

10214
02:56:49,359 --> 02:56:50,790
initially it would be a lot of touch but
very little of that

10215
02:56:50,790 --> 02:56:50,800
very little of that
 

10216
02:56:50,800 --> 02:56:52,309
very little of that
it's through the air

10217
02:56:52,309 --> 02:56:52,319
it's through the air
 

10218
02:56:52,319 --> 02:56:53,830
it's through the air
and when you talk

10219
02:56:53,830 --> 02:56:53,840
and when you talk
 

10220
02:56:53,840 --> 02:56:55,830
and when you talk
mainly when you talk you you expel a lot

10221
02:56:55,830 --> 02:56:55,840
mainly when you talk you you expel a lot
 

10222
02:56:55,840 --> 02:56:56,630
mainly when you talk you you expel a lot
of

10223
02:56:56,630 --> 02:56:56,640
of
 

10224
02:56:56,640 --> 02:56:58,710
of
droplets right even the plosives that

10225
02:56:58,710 --> 02:56:58,720
droplets right even the plosives that
 

10226
02:56:58,720 --> 02:57:01,429
droplets right even the plosives that
your foam thing here is are meant to

10227
02:57:01,429 --> 02:57:01,439
your foam thing here is are meant to
 

10228
02:57:01,439 --> 02:57:03,190
your foam thing here is are meant to
pee right that you send out little

10229
02:57:03,190 --> 02:57:03,200
pee right that you send out little
 

10230
02:57:03,200 --> 02:57:05,990
pee right that you send out little
sprays and those have viruses in them

10231
02:57:05,990 --> 02:57:06,000
sprays and those have viruses in them
 

10232
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:08,710
sprays and those have viruses in them
and the big drops fall to the ground

10233
02:57:08,710 --> 02:57:08,720
and the big drops fall to the ground
 

10234
02:57:08,720 --> 02:57:10,870
and the big drops fall to the ground
and the little ones can go 100 feet or

10235
02:57:10,870 --> 02:57:10,880
and the little ones can go 100 feet or
 

10236
02:57:10,880 --> 02:57:13,349
and the little ones can go 100 feet or
more right but the little ones also have

10237
02:57:13,349 --> 02:57:13,359
more right but the little ones also have
 

10238
02:57:13,359 --> 02:57:16,309
more right but the little ones also have
less virus in them

10239
02:57:16,309 --> 02:57:16,319
less virus in them
 

10240
02:57:16,319 --> 02:57:19,110
less virus in them
so i'm not sure well we certainly do not

10241
02:57:19,110 --> 02:57:19,120
so i'm not sure well we certainly do not
 

10242
02:57:19,120 --> 02:57:20,710
so i'm not sure well we certainly do not
know how much virus you need to be

10243
02:57:20,710 --> 02:57:20,720
know how much virus you need to be
 

10244
02:57:20,720 --> 02:57:23,110
know how much virus you need to be
infected right but it's probably at

10245
02:57:23,110 --> 02:57:23,120
infected right but it's probably at
 

10246
02:57:23,120 --> 02:57:25,990
infected right but it's probably at
least several thousand particles if not

10247
02:57:25,990 --> 02:57:26,000
least several thousand particles if not
 

10248
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:26,790
least several thousand particles if not
more

10249
02:57:26,790 --> 02:57:26,800
more
 

10250
02:57:26,800 --> 02:57:28,389
more
and it could be that

10251
02:57:28,389 --> 02:57:28,399
and it could be that
 

10252
02:57:28,399 --> 02:57:30,790
and it could be that
for most people

10253
02:57:30,790 --> 02:57:30,800
for most people
 

10254
02:57:30,800 --> 02:57:32,870
for most people
the tiny droplets don't have enough

10255
02:57:32,870 --> 02:57:32,880
the tiny droplets don't have enough
 

10256
02:57:32,880 --> 02:57:35,190
the tiny droplets don't have enough
virus to infect someone else but there's

10257
02:57:35,190 --> 02:57:35,200
virus to infect someone else but there's
 

10258
02:57:35,200 --> 02:57:37,910
virus to infect someone else but there's
one observation about this virus it's

10259
02:57:37,910 --> 02:57:37,920
one observation about this virus it's
 

10260
02:57:37,920 --> 02:57:41,030
one observation about this virus it's
really interesting and that is that

10261
02:57:41,030 --> 02:57:41,040
really interesting and that is that
 

10262
02:57:41,040 --> 02:57:44,150
really interesting and that is that
80 of transmissions are done by 20 of

10263
02:57:44,150 --> 02:57:44,160
80 of transmissions are done by 20 of
 

10264
02:57:44,160 --> 02:57:46,950
80 of transmissions are done by 20 of
the people of the infected people

10265
02:57:46,950 --> 02:57:46,960
the people of the infected people
 

10266
02:57:46,960 --> 02:57:50,309
the people of the infected people
not every infected person transmits

10267
02:57:50,309 --> 02:57:50,319
not every infected person transmits
 

10268
02:57:50,319 --> 02:57:51,750
not every infected person transmits
that's been borne out in multiple

10269
02:57:51,750 --> 02:57:51,760
that's been borne out in multiple
 

10270
02:57:51,760 --> 02:57:54,550
that's been borne out in multiple
studies and in fact there's a study at

10271
02:57:54,550 --> 02:57:54,560
studies and in fact there's a study at
 

10272
02:57:54,560 --> 02:57:56,309
studies and in fact there's a study at
university of colorado

10273
02:57:56,309 --> 02:57:56,319
university of colorado
 

10274
02:57:56,319 --> 02:57:57,349
university of colorado
where they

10275
02:57:57,349 --> 02:57:57,359
where they
 

10276
02:57:57,359 --> 02:57:59,750
where they
quantified the viral rna loads and all

10277
02:57:59,750 --> 02:57:59,760
quantified the viral rna loads and all
 

10278
02:57:59,760 --> 02:58:01,750
quantified the viral rna loads and all
the swabs that had been done of students

10279
02:58:01,750 --> 02:58:01,760
the swabs that had been done of students
 

10280
02:58:01,760 --> 02:58:04,309
the swabs that had been done of students
for like a six month period

10281
02:58:04,309 --> 02:58:04,319
for like a six month period
 

10282
02:58:04,319 --> 02:58:06,230
for like a six month period
and

10283
02:58:06,230 --> 02:58:06,240
and
 

10284
02:58:06,240 --> 02:58:08,950
and
most of the infectious fire most of the

10285
02:58:08,950 --> 02:58:08,960
most of the infectious fire most of the
 

10286
02:58:08,960 --> 02:58:10,469
most of the infectious fire most of the
rna copies

10287
02:58:10,469 --> 02:58:10,479
rna copies
 

10288
02:58:10,479 --> 02:58:12,790
rna copies
were found in

10289
02:58:12,790 --> 02:58:12,800
were found in
 

10290
02:58:12,800 --> 02:58:15,510
were found in
15 to 20 percent of the people the rest

10291
02:58:15,510 --> 02:58:15,520
15 to 20 percent of the people the rest
 

10292
02:58:15,520 --> 02:58:16,790
15 to 20 percent of the people the rest
had really low and they're probably

10293
02:58:16,790 --> 02:58:16,800
had really low and they're probably
 

10294
02:58:16,800 --> 02:58:18,870
had really low and they're probably
that's probably why they don't transmit

10295
02:58:18,870 --> 02:58:18,880
that's probably why they don't transmit
 

10296
02:58:18,880 --> 02:58:20,230
that's probably why they don't transmit
so

10297
02:58:20,230 --> 02:58:20,240
so
 

10298
02:58:20,240 --> 02:58:22,150
so
those are the ones that might get by

10299
02:58:22,150 --> 02:58:22,160
those are the ones that might get by
 

10300
02:58:22,160 --> 02:58:24,309
those are the ones that might get by
enough virus in the tiny droplets to be

10301
02:58:24,309 --> 02:58:24,319
enough virus in the tiny droplets to be
 

10302
02:58:24,319 --> 02:58:27,110
enough virus in the tiny droplets to be
able to infect someone at a distance and

10303
02:58:27,110 --> 02:58:27,120
able to infect someone at a distance and
 

10304
02:58:27,120 --> 02:58:29,349
able to infect someone at a distance and
i think that's entirely possible

10305
02:58:29,349 --> 02:58:29,359
i think that's entirely possible
 

10306
02:58:29,359 --> 02:58:31,429
i think that's entirely possible
why is it hard to study

10307
02:58:31,429 --> 02:58:31,439
why is it hard to study
 

10308
02:58:31,439 --> 02:58:34,230
why is it hard to study
you can't do it in real life because you

10309
02:58:34,230 --> 02:58:34,240
you can't do it in real life because you
 

10310
02:58:34,240 --> 02:58:36,469
you can't do it in real life because you
don't know who's infected and if you do

10311
02:58:36,469 --> 02:58:36,479
don't know who's infected and if you do
 

10312
02:58:36,479 --> 02:58:37,670
don't know who's infected and if you do
this there's not a controlled

10313
02:58:37,670 --> 02:58:37,680
this there's not a controlled
 

10314
02:58:37,680 --> 02:58:39,429
this there's not a controlled
environment to measure droplets and so

10315
02:58:39,429 --> 02:58:39,439
environment to measure droplets and so
 

10316
02:58:39,439 --> 02:58:40,950
environment to measure droplets and so
forth you'd have to do it in a

10317
02:58:40,950 --> 02:58:40,960
forth you'd have to do it in a
 

10318
02:58:40,960 --> 02:58:43,190
forth you'd have to do it in a
laboratory situation if you use an

10319
02:58:43,190 --> 02:58:43,200
laboratory situation if you use an
 

10320
02:58:43,200 --> 02:58:44,870
laboratory situation if you use an
animal you just don't know what the

10321
02:58:44,870 --> 02:58:44,880
animal you just don't know what the
 

10322
02:58:44,880 --> 02:58:46,389
animal you just don't know what the
relevance of that is

10323
02:58:46,389 --> 02:58:46,399
relevance of that is
 

10324
02:58:46,399 --> 02:58:48,309
relevance of that is
to people you'd have to use

10325
02:58:48,309 --> 02:58:48,319
to people you'd have to use
 

10326
02:58:48,319 --> 02:58:50,550
to people you'd have to use
human and do challenge experiments and

10327
02:58:50,550 --> 02:58:50,560
human and do challenge experiments and
 

10328
02:58:50,560 --> 02:58:52,070
human and do challenge experiments and
you know we we don't do that at this

10329
02:58:52,070 --> 02:58:52,080
you know we we don't do that at this
 

10330
02:58:52,080 --> 02:58:53,830
you know we we don't do that at this
point at least not for this virus so

10331
02:58:53,830 --> 02:58:53,840
point at least not for this virus so
 

10332
02:58:53,840 --> 02:58:55,429
point at least not for this virus so
that's why it's hard to know what's

10333
02:58:55,429 --> 02:58:55,439
that's why it's hard to know what's
 

10334
02:58:55,439 --> 02:58:58,309
that's why it's hard to know what's
going on so we have to make inferences

10335
02:58:58,309 --> 02:58:58,319
going on so we have to make inferences
 

10336
02:58:58,319 --> 02:59:00,469
going on so we have to make inferences
from epidemiological

10337
02:59:00,469 --> 02:59:00,479
from epidemiological
 

10338
02:59:00,479 --> 02:59:01,990
from epidemiological
associations where you're studying say

10339
02:59:01,990 --> 02:59:02,000
associations where you're studying say
 

10340
02:59:02,000 --> 02:59:04,230
associations where you're studying say
transmission in a household where people

10341
02:59:04,230 --> 02:59:04,240
transmission in a household where people
 

10342
02:59:04,240 --> 02:59:06,150
transmission in a household where people
are stuck in the same rooms together and

10343
02:59:06,150 --> 02:59:06,160
are stuck in the same rooms together and
 

10344
02:59:06,160 --> 02:59:07,830
are stuck in the same rooms together and
you can get an idea of

10345
02:59:07,830 --> 02:59:07,840
you can get an idea of
 

10346
02:59:07,840 --> 02:59:09,910
you can get an idea of
what kind of droplets were involved so

10347
02:59:09,910 --> 02:59:09,920
what kind of droplets were involved so
 

10348
02:59:09,920 --> 02:59:11,830
what kind of droplets were involved so
that makes it much harder to if you're

10349
02:59:11,830 --> 02:59:11,840
that makes it much harder to if you're
 

10350
02:59:11,840 --> 02:59:13,830
that makes it much harder to if you're
if you're leaning on epidemiological

10351
02:59:13,830 --> 02:59:13,840
if you're leaning on epidemiological
 

10352
02:59:13,840 --> 02:59:15,910
if you're leaning on epidemiological
stuff as opposed to like biophysics or

10353
02:59:15,910 --> 02:59:15,920
stuff as opposed to like biophysics or
 

10354
02:59:15,920 --> 02:59:17,510
stuff as opposed to like biophysics or
something like the the mechanic very

10355
02:59:17,510 --> 02:59:17,520
something like the the mechanic very
 

10356
02:59:17,520 --> 02:59:18,389
something like the the mechanic very
hard

10357
02:59:18,389 --> 02:59:18,399
hard
 

10358
02:59:18,399 --> 02:59:19,429
hard
so

10359
02:59:19,429 --> 02:59:19,439
so
 

10360
02:59:19,439 --> 02:59:21,110
so
that makes it but that makes it really

10361
02:59:21,110 --> 02:59:21,120
that makes it but that makes it really
 

10362
02:59:21,120 --> 02:59:23,269
that makes it but that makes it really
hard to then develop solutions like

10363
02:59:23,269 --> 02:59:23,279
hard to then develop solutions like
 

10364
02:59:23,279 --> 02:59:25,349
hard to then develop solutions like
masks to ask the question how will the

10365
02:59:25,349 --> 02:59:25,359
masks to ask the question how will the
 

10366
02:59:25,359 --> 02:59:28,389
masks to ask the question how will the
masks work because then to answer that

10367
02:59:28,389 --> 02:59:28,399
masks work because then to answer that
 

10368
02:59:28,399 --> 02:59:30,870
masks work because then to answer that
question you can lean on epidemiological

10369
02:59:30,870 --> 02:59:30,880
question you can lean on epidemiological
 

10370
02:59:30,880 --> 02:59:32,230
question you can lean on epidemiological
stuff again

10371
02:59:32,230 --> 02:59:32,240
stuff again
 

10372
02:59:32,240 --> 02:59:33,990
stuff again
like looking at populations that wear

10373
02:59:33,990 --> 02:59:34,000
like looking at populations that wear
 

10374
02:59:34,000 --> 02:59:36,469
like looking at populations that wear
masks versus don't wear masks

10375
02:59:36,469 --> 02:59:36,479
masks versus don't wear masks
 

10376
02:59:36,479 --> 02:59:37,750
masks versus don't wear masks
as opposed to

10377
02:59:37,750 --> 02:59:37,760
as opposed to
 

10378
02:59:37,760 --> 02:59:39,190
as opposed to
actually saying

10379
02:59:39,190 --> 02:59:39,200
actually saying
 

10380
02:59:39,200 --> 02:59:40,150
actually saying
uh

10381
02:59:40,150 --> 02:59:40,160
uh
 

10382
02:59:40,160 --> 02:59:41,830
uh
like from an engineering perspective

10383
02:59:41,830 --> 02:59:41,840
like from an engineering perspective
 

10384
02:59:41,840 --> 02:59:44,070
like from an engineering perspective
like what kind of material

10385
02:59:44,070 --> 02:59:44,080
like what kind of material
 

10386
02:59:44,080 --> 02:59:46,630
like what kind of material
and what kind of tightness

10387
02:59:46,630 --> 02:59:46,640
and what kind of tightness
 

10388
02:59:46,640 --> 02:59:49,190
and what kind of tightness
by which amount decreases

10389
02:59:49,190 --> 02:59:49,200
by which amount decreases
 

10390
02:59:49,200 --> 02:59:51,429
by which amount decreases
the viral load that's received on the

10391
02:59:51,429 --> 02:59:51,439
the viral load that's received on the
 

10392
02:59:51,439 --> 02:59:53,349
the viral load that's received on the
other end but

10393
02:59:53,349 --> 02:59:53,359
other end but
 

10394
02:59:53,359 --> 02:59:55,269
other end but
some experiments have been done with

10395
02:59:55,269 --> 02:59:55,279
some experiments have been done with
 

10396
02:59:55,279 --> 02:59:57,510
some experiments have been done with
masks and just droplets with no virus in

10397
02:59:57,510 --> 02:59:57,520
masks and just droplets with no virus in
 

10398
02:59:57,520 --> 03:00:00,230
masks and just droplets with no virus in
them right right yes and you can measure

10399
03:00:00,230 --> 03:00:00,240
them right right yes and you can measure
 

10400
03:00:00,240 --> 03:00:01,990
them right right yes and you can measure
the efficiency of different mask

10401
03:00:01,990 --> 03:00:02,000
the efficiency of different mask
 

10402
03:00:02,000 --> 03:00:03,429
the efficiency of different mask
materials at

10403
03:00:03,429 --> 03:00:03,439
materials at
 

10404
03:00:03,439 --> 03:00:06,150
materials at
keeping those in so if i say that this

10405
03:00:06,150 --> 03:00:06,160
keeping those in so if i say that this
 

10406
03:00:06,160 --> 03:00:07,990
keeping those in so if i say that this
mask stops

10407
03:00:07,990 --> 03:00:08,000
mask stops
 

10408
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:12,230
mask stops
70 percent of this or larger size

03:00:27,520 --> 03:00:29,750
the receiving end and the giving end
sure so how will the mask protect you

10423
03:00:29,750 --> 03:00:29,760
sure so how will the mask protect you
 

10424
03:00:29,760 --> 03:00:31,910
sure so how will the mask protect you
from others how well do you do mass

10425
03:00:31,910 --> 03:00:31,920
from others how well do you do mass
 

10426
03:00:31,920 --> 03:00:34,150
from others how well do you do mass
protect uh others from you

10427
03:00:34,150 --> 03:00:34,160
protect uh others from you
 

10428
03:00:34,160 --> 03:00:36,309
protect uh others from you
like all of those things

10429
03:00:36,309 --> 03:00:36,319
like all of those things
 

10430
03:00:36,319 --> 03:00:39,110
like all of those things
seem like they could be more rigorously

10431
03:00:39,110 --> 03:00:39,120
seem like they could be more rigorously
 

10432
03:00:39,120 --> 03:00:42,309
seem like they could be more rigorously
studied there's no doubt about it and

10433
03:00:42,309 --> 03:00:42,319
studied there's no doubt about it and
 

10434
03:00:42,319 --> 03:00:44,950
studied there's no doubt about it and
now is the time because once this is

10435
03:00:44,950 --> 03:00:44,960
now is the time because once this is
 

10436
03:00:44,960 --> 03:00:45,990
now is the time because once this is
over

10437
03:00:45,990 --> 03:00:46,000
over
 

10438
03:00:46,000 --> 03:00:48,309
over
nobody's gonna do it nobody's gonna care

10439
03:00:48,309 --> 03:00:48,319
nobody's gonna do it nobody's gonna care
 

10440
03:00:48,319 --> 03:00:51,429
nobody's gonna do it nobody's gonna care
no right but it seems like to me so test

10441
03:00:51,429 --> 03:00:51,439
no right but it seems like to me so test
 

10442
03:00:51,439 --> 03:00:52,790
no right but it seems like to me so test
is one thing

10443
03:00:52,790 --> 03:00:52,800
is one thing
 

10444
03:00:52,800 --> 03:00:54,710
is one thing
but masks

10445
03:00:54,710 --> 03:00:54,720
but masks
 

10446
03:00:54,720 --> 03:00:55,670
but masks
like

10447
03:00:55,670 --> 03:00:55,680
like
 

10448
03:00:55,680 --> 03:00:56,710
like
the

10449
03:00:56,710 --> 03:00:56,720
the
 

10450
03:00:56,720 --> 03:00:59,030
the
good mask whatever the good means

10451
03:00:59,030 --> 03:00:59,040
good mask whatever the good means
 

10452
03:00:59,040 --> 03:01:01,190
good mask whatever the good means
whatever that means like some level of a

10453
03:01:01,190 --> 03:01:01,200
whatever that means like some level of a
 

10454
03:01:01,200 --> 03:01:04,150
whatever that means like some level of a
quality of material on your face

10455
03:01:04,150 --> 03:01:04,160
quality of material on your face
 

10456
03:01:04,160 --> 03:01:06,389
quality of material on your face
if it's shown to actually like

10457
03:01:06,389 --> 03:01:06,399
if it's shown to actually like
 

10458
03:01:06,399 --> 03:01:08,950
if it's shown to actually like
thoroughly shown to work well

10459
03:01:08,950 --> 03:01:08,960
thoroughly shown to work well
 

10460
03:01:08,960 --> 03:01:11,670
thoroughly shown to work well
that seems like an obvious solution

10461
03:01:11,670 --> 03:01:11,680
that seems like an obvious solution
 

10462
03:01:11,680 --> 03:01:13,190
that seems like an obvious solution
uh to

10463
03:01:13,190 --> 03:01:13,200
uh to
 

10464
03:01:13,200 --> 03:01:15,670
uh to
reopen society with if you have a good

10465
03:01:15,670 --> 03:01:15,680
reopen society with if you have a good
 

10466
03:01:15,680 --> 03:01:17,990
reopen society with if you have a good
understanding of how well they work

10467
03:01:17,990 --> 03:01:18,000
understanding of how well they work
 

10468
03:01:18,000 --> 03:01:19,429
understanding of how well they work
because if you don't have a good

10469
03:01:19,429 --> 03:01:19,439
because if you don't have a good
 

10470
03:01:19,439 --> 03:01:20,630
because if you don't have a good
understanding if there's a lot of

10471
03:01:20,630 --> 03:01:20,640
understanding if there's a lot of
 

10472
03:01:20,640 --> 03:01:23,190
understanding if there's a lot of
uncertainty that's when you get and you

10473
03:01:23,190 --> 03:01:23,200
uncertainty that's when you get and you
 

10474
03:01:23,200 --> 03:01:24,870
uncertainty that's when you get and you
have people speaking from authority

10475
03:01:24,870 --> 03:01:24,880
have people speaking from authority
 

10476
03:01:24,880 --> 03:01:26,230
have people speaking from authority
that's when you start getting the

10477
03:01:26,230 --> 03:01:26,240
that's when you start getting the
 

10478
03:01:26,240 --> 03:01:27,830
that's when you start getting the
politicization

10479
03:01:27,830 --> 03:01:27,840
politicization
 

10480
03:01:27,840 --> 03:01:30,870
politicization
of the solutions of course no the data

10481
03:01:30,870 --> 03:01:30,880
of the solutions of course no the data
 

10482
03:01:30,880 --> 03:01:33,269
of the solutions of course no the data
there are some data

10483
03:01:33,269 --> 03:01:33,279
there are some data
 

10484
03:01:33,279 --> 03:01:36,230
there are some data
most they're mostly epidemiological

10485
03:01:36,230 --> 03:01:36,240
most they're mostly epidemiological
 

10486
03:01:36,240 --> 03:01:37,910
most they're mostly epidemiological
and they show some effect in some

10487
03:01:37,910 --> 03:01:37,920
and they show some effect in some
 

10488
03:01:37,920 --> 03:01:39,990
and they show some effect in some
countries right but they could be way

10489
03:01:39,990 --> 03:01:40,000
countries right but they could be way
 

10490
03:01:40,000 --> 03:01:42,389
countries right but they could be way
better yeah and

10491
03:01:42,389 --> 03:01:42,399
better yeah and
 

10492
03:01:42,399 --> 03:01:44,790
better yeah and
but the fact that they're not perfect

10493
03:01:44,790 --> 03:01:44,800
but the fact that they're not perfect
 

10494
03:01:44,800 --> 03:01:46,630
but the fact that they're not perfect
then people take advantage of and say

10495
03:01:46,630 --> 03:01:46,640
then people take advantage of and say
 

10496
03:01:46,640 --> 03:01:48,230
then people take advantage of and say
well look they don't work that well so

10497
03:01:48,230 --> 03:01:48,240
well look they don't work that well so
 

10498
03:01:48,240 --> 03:01:49,910
well look they don't work that well so
i'm not going to wear it i think as you

10499
03:01:49,910 --> 03:01:49,920
i'm not going to wear it i think as you
 

10500
03:01:49,920 --> 03:01:53,590
i'm not going to wear it i think as you
said people can use it as an excuse but

10501
03:01:53,590 --> 03:01:53,600
said people can use it as an excuse but
 

10502
03:01:53,600 --> 03:01:55,830
said people can use it as an excuse but
even if it works so daniel always says

10503
03:01:55,830 --> 03:01:55,840
even if it works so daniel always says
 

10504
03:01:55,840 --> 03:01:58,630
even if it works so daniel always says
it a mask will cut down transmission by

10505
03:01:58,630 --> 03:01:58,640
it a mask will cut down transmission by
 

10506
03:01:58,640 --> 03:01:59,590
it a mask will cut down transmission by
50

10507
03:01:59,590 --> 03:01:59,600
50
 

10508
03:01:59,600 --> 03:02:01,830
50
to 60 percent and then distance will do

10509
03:02:01,830 --> 03:02:01,840
to 60 percent and then distance will do
 

10510
03:02:01,840 --> 03:02:04,309
to 60 percent and then distance will do
another 30 yeah those numbers are made

10511
03:02:04,309 --> 03:02:04,319
another 30 yeah those numbers are made
 

10512
03:02:04,319 --> 03:02:05,670
another 30 yeah those numbers are made
up though

10513
03:02:05,670 --> 03:02:05,680
up though
 

10514
03:02:05,680 --> 03:02:07,190
up though
i mean they're not made up but they're

10515
03:02:07,190 --> 03:02:07,200
i mean they're not made up but they're
 

10516
03:02:07,200 --> 03:02:08,309
i mean they're not made up but they're
estimates

10517
03:02:08,309 --> 03:02:08,319
estimates
 

10518
03:02:08,319 --> 03:02:09,990
estimates
absolutely

10519
03:02:09,990 --> 03:02:10,000
absolutely
 

10520
03:02:10,000 --> 03:02:11,510
absolutely
and many of them are made

10521
03:02:11,510 --> 03:02:11,520
and many of them are made
 

10522
03:02:11,520 --> 03:02:13,830
and many of them are made
based on models right yeah we make this

10523
03:02:13,830 --> 03:02:13,840
based on models right yeah we make this
 

10524
03:02:13,840 --> 03:02:15,990
based on models right yeah we make this
model and let's say the mask cuts down

10525
03:02:15,990 --> 03:02:16,000
model and let's say the mask cuts down
 

10526
03:02:16,000 --> 03:02:17,510
model and let's say the mask cuts down
this much what's what will be the effect

10527
03:02:17,510 --> 03:02:17,520
this much what's what will be the effect
 

10528
03:02:17,520 --> 03:02:19,429
this much what's what will be the effect
on i mean yeah they're models and it's

10529
03:02:19,429 --> 03:02:19,439
on i mean yeah they're models and it's
 

10530
03:02:19,439 --> 03:02:21,990
on i mean yeah they're models and it's
for the same reason i i don't believe

10531
03:02:21,990 --> 03:02:22,000
for the same reason i i don't believe
 

10532
03:02:22,000 --> 03:02:23,670
for the same reason i i don't believe
the transmission

10533
03:02:23,670 --> 03:02:23,680
the transmission
 

10534
03:02:23,680 --> 03:02:25,510
the transmission
uh var of the variants because it's all

10535
03:02:25,510 --> 03:02:25,520
uh var of the variants because it's all
 

10536
03:02:25,520 --> 03:02:27,510
uh var of the variants because it's all
based on statistical models as well not

10537
03:02:27,510 --> 03:02:27,520
based on statistical models as well not
 

10538
03:02:27,520 --> 03:02:29,510
based on statistical models as well not
biological experiments done in the lab

10539
03:02:29,510 --> 03:02:29,520
biological experiments done in the lab
 

10540
03:02:29,520 --> 03:02:31,429
biological experiments done in the lab
so that in that sense vaccine data is

10541
03:02:31,429 --> 03:02:31,439
so that in that sense vaccine data is
 

10542
03:02:31,439 --> 03:02:33,110
so that in that sense vaccine data is
much better than masks

10543
03:02:33,110 --> 03:02:33,120
much better than masks
 

10544
03:02:33,120 --> 03:02:35,190
much better than masks
for sure for sure so

10545
03:02:35,190 --> 03:02:35,200
for sure for sure so
 

10546
03:02:35,200 --> 03:02:37,429
for sure for sure so
my my problem with the mask date which i

10547
03:02:37,429 --> 03:02:37,439
my my problem with the mask date which i
 

10548
03:02:37,439 --> 03:02:38,790
my my problem with the mask date which i
always thought was fascinating i stopped

10549
03:02:38,790 --> 03:02:38,800
always thought was fascinating i stopped
 

10550
03:02:38,800 --> 03:02:40,309
always thought was fascinating i stopped
talking about it i was in the paper

10551
03:02:40,309 --> 03:02:40,319
talking about it i was in the paper
 

10552
03:02:40,319 --> 03:02:42,389
talking about it i was in the paper
about masks i stopped talking about it

10553
03:02:42,389 --> 03:02:42,399
about masks i stopped talking about it
 

10554
03:02:42,399 --> 03:02:43,590
about masks i stopped talking about it
because

10555
03:02:43,590 --> 03:02:43,600
because
 

10556
03:02:43,600 --> 03:02:45,590
because
what what started happening is mass

10557
03:02:45,590 --> 03:02:45,600
what what started happening is mass
 

10558
03:02:45,600 --> 03:02:47,910
what what started happening is mass
created on both sides

10559
03:02:47,910 --> 03:02:47,920
created on both sides
 

10560
03:02:47,920 --> 03:02:49,910
created on both sides
the people that were like in silicon

10561
03:02:49,910 --> 03:02:49,920
the people that were like in silicon
 

10562
03:02:49,920 --> 03:02:51,750
the people that were like in silicon
valley friends of mine that were wearing

10563
03:02:51,750 --> 03:02:51,760
valley friends of mine that were wearing
 

10564
03:02:51,760 --> 03:02:54,230
valley friends of mine that were wearing
masks the way they look at others who

10565
03:02:54,230 --> 03:02:54,240
masks the way they look at others who
 

10566
03:02:54,240 --> 03:02:55,510
masks the way they look at others who
don't

10567
03:02:55,510 --> 03:02:55,520
don't
 

10568
03:02:55,520 --> 03:02:57,510
don't
is like that's that's a whole other

10569
03:02:57,510 --> 03:02:57,520
is like that's that's a whole other
 

10570
03:02:57,520 --> 03:02:59,030
is like that's that's a whole other
issue right that's yeah but that what

10571
03:02:59,030 --> 03:02:59,040
issue right that's yeah but that what
 

10572
03:02:59,040 --> 03:03:00,710
issue right that's yeah but that what
that i understand that's happens when

10573
03:03:00,710 --> 03:03:00,720
that i understand that's happens when
 

10574
03:03:00,720 --> 03:03:03,190
that i understand that's happens when
you don't have solid science understood

10575
03:03:03,190 --> 03:03:03,200
you don't have solid science understood
 

10576
03:03:03,200 --> 03:03:05,349
you don't have solid science understood
they that now start judging you like

10577
03:03:05,349 --> 03:03:05,359
they that now start judging you like
 

10578
03:03:05,359 --> 03:03:07,670
they that now start judging you like
you're less a human being you're not

10579
03:03:07,670 --> 03:03:07,680
you're less a human being you're not
 

10580
03:03:07,680 --> 03:03:10,710
you're less a human being you're not
only uh dumb but you're just you're

10581
03:03:10,710 --> 03:03:10,720
only uh dumb but you're just you're
 

10582
03:03:10,720 --> 03:03:12,469
only uh dumb but you're just you're
almost like evil you're doing bad for

10583
03:03:12,469 --> 03:03:12,479
almost like evil you're doing bad for
 

10584
03:03:12,479 --> 03:03:14,550
almost like evil you're doing bad for
society by not wearing masks and then

10585
03:03:14,550 --> 03:03:14,560
society by not wearing masks and then
 

10586
03:03:14,560 --> 03:03:17,429
society by not wearing masks and then
the people looking in the other way

10587
03:03:17,429 --> 03:03:17,439
the people looking in the other way
 

10588
03:03:17,439 --> 03:03:19,030
the people looking in the other way
are seeing you for the that

10589
03:03:19,030 --> 03:03:19,040
are seeing you for the that
 

10590
03:03:19,040 --> 03:03:21,190
are seeing you for the that
you're being for judging them

10591
03:03:21,190 --> 03:03:21,200
you're being for judging them
 

10592
03:03:21,200 --> 03:03:22,790
you're being for judging them
uh unrightfully so they almost want to

10593
03:03:22,790 --> 03:03:22,800
uh unrightfully so they almost want to
 

10594
03:03:22,800 --> 03:03:24,550
uh unrightfully so they almost want to
say fu by not wearing the mask and

10595
03:03:24,550 --> 03:03:24,560
say fu by not wearing the mask and
 

10596
03:03:24,560 --> 03:03:26,550
say fu by not wearing the mask and
there's this division that's created

10597
03:03:26,550 --> 03:03:26,560
there's this division that's created
 

10598
03:03:26,560 --> 03:03:28,070
there's this division that's created
that that was heartbreaking to me

10599
03:03:28,070 --> 03:03:28,080
that that was heartbreaking to me
 

10600
03:03:28,080 --> 03:03:31,030
that that was heartbreaking to me
because masks like testing is a solution

10601
03:03:31,030 --> 03:03:31,040
because masks like testing is a solution
 

10602
03:03:31,040 --> 03:03:33,349
because masks like testing is a solution
that was available early on

10603
03:03:33,349 --> 03:03:33,359
that was available early on
 

10604
03:03:33,359 --> 03:03:35,429
that was available early on
and if understood well it could be

10605
03:03:35,429 --> 03:03:35,439
and if understood well it could be
 

10606
03:03:35,439 --> 03:03:37,510
and if understood well it could be
deployed in a mass scale and it seems

10607
03:03:37,510 --> 03:03:37,520
deployed in a mass scale and it seems
 

10608
03:03:37,520 --> 03:03:39,110
deployed in a mass scale and it seems
like there's some historical evidence

10609
03:03:39,110 --> 03:03:39,120
like there's some historical evidence
 

10610
03:03:39,120 --> 03:03:41,349
like there's some historical evidence
for other viruses where it does yes very

10611
03:03:41,349 --> 03:03:41,359
for other viruses where it does yes very
 

10612
03:03:41,359 --> 03:03:43,590
for other viruses where it does yes very
well that's correct and so like

10613
03:03:43,590 --> 03:03:43,600
well that's correct and so like
 

10614
03:03:43,600 --> 03:03:45,990
well that's correct and so like
the fact that this was politicized

10615
03:03:45,990 --> 03:03:46,000
the fact that this was politicized
 

10616
03:03:46,000 --> 03:03:47,110
the fact that this was politicized
um

10617
03:03:47,110 --> 03:03:47,120
um
 

10618
03:03:47,120 --> 03:03:48,870
um
yeah was a little bit heartbreaking you

10619
03:03:48,870 --> 03:03:48,880
yeah was a little bit heartbreaking you
 

10620
03:03:48,880 --> 03:03:51,910
yeah was a little bit heartbreaking you
can find in the literature studies

10621
03:03:51,910 --> 03:03:51,920
can find in the literature studies
 

10622
03:03:51,920 --> 03:03:53,510
can find in the literature studies
mostly of healthcare workers and

10623
03:03:53,510 --> 03:03:53,520
mostly of healthcare workers and
 

10624
03:03:53,520 --> 03:03:56,150
mostly of healthcare workers and
influenza where you can actually

10625
03:03:56,150 --> 03:03:56,160
influenza where you can actually
 

10626
03:03:56,160 --> 03:03:57,510
influenza where you can actually
because you see the people every day

10627
03:03:57,510 --> 03:03:57,520
because you see the people every day
 

10628
03:03:57,520 --> 03:03:59,110
because you see the people every day
they can sample them you can actually

10629
03:03:59,110 --> 03:03:59,120
they can sample them you can actually
 

10630
03:03:59,120 --> 03:04:02,070
they can sample them you can actually
see what masking does and some of them

10631
03:04:02,070 --> 03:04:02,080
see what masking does and some of them
 

10632
03:04:02,080 --> 03:04:04,070
see what masking does and some of them
show an effect and others do not then

10633
03:04:04,070 --> 03:04:04,080
show an effect and others do not then
 

10634
03:04:04,080 --> 03:04:06,550
show an effect and others do not then
that's the problem that's like any trial

10635
03:04:06,550 --> 03:04:06,560
that's the problem that's like any trial
 

10636
03:04:06,560 --> 03:04:08,309
that's the problem that's like any trial
sometimes if it's not big enough and

10637
03:04:08,309 --> 03:04:08,319
sometimes if it's not big enough and
 

10638
03:04:08,319 --> 03:04:10,469
sometimes if it's not big enough and
then people latch on to that see it

10639
03:04:10,469 --> 03:04:10,479
then people latch on to that see it
 

10640
03:04:10,479 --> 03:04:12,550
then people latch on to that see it
doesn't really work but i think the main

10641
03:04:12,550 --> 03:04:12,560
doesn't really work but i think the main
 

10642
03:04:12,560 --> 03:04:14,230
doesn't really work but i think the main
issue is that

10643
03:04:14,230 --> 03:04:14,240
issue is that
 

10644
03:04:14,240 --> 03:04:17,590
issue is that
in january both cdc and who said masks

10645
03:04:17,590 --> 03:04:17,600
in january both cdc and who said masks
 

10646
03:04:17,600 --> 03:04:19,990
in january both cdc and who said masks
don't work don't use them

10647
03:04:19,990 --> 03:04:20,000
don't work don't use them
 

10648
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:22,230
don't work don't use them
that was the kiss of death for masks

10649
03:04:22,230 --> 03:04:22,240
that was the kiss of death for masks
 

10650
03:04:22,240 --> 03:04:24,309
that was the kiss of death for masks
because when they then changed their

10651
03:04:24,309 --> 03:04:24,319
because when they then changed their
 

10652
03:04:24,319 --> 03:04:25,830
because when they then changed their
mind

10653
03:04:25,830 --> 03:04:25,840
mind
 

10654
03:04:25,840 --> 03:04:28,070
mind
they didn't say we screwed up

10655
03:04:28,070 --> 03:04:28,080
they didn't say we screwed up
 

10656
03:04:28,080 --> 03:04:29,750
they didn't say we screwed up
they just said wear masks if they had

10657
03:04:29,750 --> 03:04:29,760
they just said wear masks if they had
 

10658
03:04:29,760 --> 03:04:32,950
they just said wear masks if they had
said we made a mistake we were wrong

10659
03:04:32,950 --> 03:04:32,960
said we made a mistake we were wrong
 

10660
03:04:32,960 --> 03:04:34,870
said we made a mistake we were wrong
i think more people would have worn

10661
03:04:34,870 --> 03:04:34,880
i think more people would have worn
 

10662
03:04:34,880 --> 03:04:37,190
i think more people would have worn
masks but they didn't yeah and like you

10663
03:04:37,190 --> 03:04:37,200
masks but they didn't yeah and like you
 

10664
03:04:37,200 --> 03:04:38,230
masks but they didn't yeah and like you
said

10665
03:04:38,230 --> 03:04:38,240
said
 

10666
03:04:38,240 --> 03:04:39,750
said
admitting you're wrong is

10667
03:04:39,750 --> 03:04:39,760
admitting you're wrong is
 

10668
03:04:39,760 --> 03:04:40,550
admitting you're wrong is
like

10669
03:04:40,550 --> 03:04:40,560
like
 

10670
03:04:40,560 --> 03:04:42,710
like
a real big part of it i think almost the

10671
03:04:42,710 --> 03:04:42,720
a real big part of it i think almost the
 

10672
03:04:42,720 --> 03:04:44,230
a real big part of it i think almost the
better way is not just saying you're

10673
03:04:44,230 --> 03:04:44,240
better way is not just saying you're
 

10674
03:04:44,240 --> 03:04:45,349
better way is not just saying you're
kind of

10675
03:04:45,349 --> 03:04:45,359
kind of
 

10676
03:04:45,359 --> 03:04:47,269
kind of
saying you're wrong but

10677
03:04:47,269 --> 03:04:47,279
saying you're wrong but
 

10678
03:04:47,279 --> 03:04:49,830
saying you're wrong but
in january saying

10679
03:04:49,830 --> 03:04:49,840
in january saying
 

10680
03:04:49,840 --> 03:04:51,590
in january saying
like revealing the uncertainty under

10681
03:04:51,590 --> 03:04:51,600
like revealing the uncertainty under
 

10682
03:04:51,600 --> 03:04:53,590
like revealing the uncertainty under
which we operate like actually

10683
03:04:53,590 --> 03:04:53,600
which we operate like actually
 

10684
03:04:53,600 --> 03:04:56,230
which we operate like actually
like uh reveal what was done

10685
03:04:56,230 --> 03:04:56,240
like uh reveal what was done
 

10686
03:04:56,240 --> 03:04:57,830
like uh reveal what was done
and with the spanish food at the the

10687
03:04:57,830 --> 03:04:57,840
and with the spanish food at the the
 

10688
03:04:57,840 --> 03:04:59,990
and with the spanish food at the the
beginning of the previous century

10689
03:04:59,990 --> 03:05:00,000
beginning of the previous century
 

10690
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:00,870
beginning of the previous century
uh

10691
03:05:00,870 --> 03:05:00,880
uh
 

10692
03:05:00,880 --> 03:05:02,070
uh
because there's a lot of mass

10693
03:05:02,070 --> 03:05:02,080
because there's a lot of mass
 

10694
03:05:02,080 --> 03:05:03,830
because there's a lot of mass
controversy then too it went back and

10695
03:05:03,830 --> 03:05:03,840
controversy then too it went back and
 

10696
03:05:03,840 --> 03:05:05,030
controversy then too it went back and
forth and that was actually the source

10697
03:05:05,030 --> 03:05:05,040
forth and that was actually the source
 

10698
03:05:05,040 --> 03:05:06,950
forth and that was actually the source
of a lot of distrust there too

10699
03:05:06,950 --> 03:05:06,960
of a lot of distrust there too
 

10700
03:05:06,960 --> 03:05:09,429
of a lot of distrust there too
so and then uh look at influenza like

10701
03:05:09,429 --> 03:05:09,439
so and then uh look at influenza like
 

10702
03:05:09,439 --> 03:05:11,349
so and then uh look at influenza like
how is it effective with that and just

10703
03:05:11,349 --> 03:05:11,359
how is it effective with that and just
 

10704
03:05:11,359 --> 03:05:14,710
how is it effective with that and just
reveal this we don't we don't know but

10705
03:05:14,710 --> 03:05:14,720
reveal this we don't we don't know but
 

10706
03:05:14,720 --> 03:05:15,590
reveal this we don't we don't know but
uh

10707
03:05:15,590 --> 03:05:15,600
uh
 

10708
03:05:15,600 --> 03:05:17,990
uh
with like with some probability this is

10709
03:05:17,990 --> 03:05:18,000
with like with some probability this is
 

10710
03:05:18,000 --> 03:05:20,070
with like with some probability this is
the best option we got right currently

10711
03:05:20,070 --> 03:05:20,080
the best option we got right currently
 

10712
03:05:20,080 --> 03:05:21,990
the best option we got right currently
and then and then in a month or two

10713
03:05:21,990 --> 03:05:22,000
and then and then in a month or two
 

10714
03:05:22,000 --> 03:05:23,750
and then and then in a month or two
adjust it

10715
03:05:23,750 --> 03:05:23,760
adjust it
 

10716
03:05:23,760 --> 03:05:26,070
adjust it
saying that you know what our like

10717
03:05:26,070 --> 03:05:26,080
saying that you know what our like
 

10718
03:05:26,080 --> 03:05:27,910
saying that you know what our like
uncertainty decreased a little bit we

10719
03:05:27,910 --> 03:05:27,920
uncertainty decreased a little bit we
 

10720
03:05:27,920 --> 03:05:29,429
uncertainty decreased a little bit we
have a better idea

10721
03:05:29,429 --> 03:05:29,439
have a better idea
 

10722
03:05:29,439 --> 03:05:31,910
have a better idea
like that was a that was an incorrect

10723
03:05:31,910 --> 03:05:31,920
like that was a that was an incorrect
 

10724
03:05:31,920 --> 03:05:33,750
like that was a that was an incorrect
estimate but reveal that you're

10725
03:05:33,750 --> 03:05:33,760
estimate but reveal that you're
 

10726
03:05:33,760 --> 03:05:35,990
estimate but reveal that you're
struggling it's not like this weird

10727
03:05:35,990 --> 03:05:36,000
struggling it's not like this weird
 

10728
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:37,750
struggling it's not like this weird
binary clock that goes one direction or

10729
03:05:37,750 --> 03:05:37,760
binary clock that goes one direction or
 

10730
03:05:37,760 --> 03:05:40,070
binary clock that goes one direction or
the other you're struggling in

10731
03:05:40,070 --> 03:05:40,080
the other you're struggling in
 

10732
03:05:40,080 --> 03:05:43,110
the other you're struggling in
with uncertainty and like trusting

10733
03:05:43,110 --> 03:05:43,120
with uncertainty and like trusting
 

10734
03:05:43,120 --> 03:05:44,870
with uncertainty and like trusting
people maybe criticize me sometimes with

10735
03:05:44,870 --> 03:05:44,880
people maybe criticize me sometimes with
 

10736
03:05:44,880 --> 03:05:47,030
people maybe criticize me sometimes with
this but i i think most people are

10737
03:05:47,030 --> 03:05:47,040
this but i i think most people are
 

10738
03:05:47,040 --> 03:05:48,870
this but i i think most people are
actually intelligent

10739
03:05:48,870 --> 03:05:48,880
actually intelligent
 

10740
03:05:48,880 --> 03:05:50,230
actually intelligent
like trusting the public to be

10741
03:05:50,230 --> 03:05:50,240
like trusting the public to be
 

10742
03:05:50,240 --> 03:05:52,950
like trusting the public to be
intelligent uh with if you give them if

10743
03:05:52,950 --> 03:05:52,960
intelligent uh with if you give them if
 

10744
03:05:52,960 --> 03:05:54,950
intelligent uh with if you give them if
you have transparent and give them uh

10745
03:05:54,950 --> 03:05:54,960
you have transparent and give them uh
 

10746
03:05:54,960 --> 03:05:57,910
you have transparent and give them uh
information in a real authentic way like

10747
03:05:57,910 --> 03:05:57,920
information in a real authentic way like
 

10748
03:05:57,920 --> 03:05:59,510
information in a real authentic way like
don't look like you're hiding something

10749
03:05:59,510 --> 03:05:59,520
don't look like you're hiding something
 

10750
03:05:59,520 --> 03:06:01,190
don't look like you're hiding something
i think they're intelligent enough to

10751
03:06:01,190 --> 03:06:01,200
i think they're intelligent enough to
 

10752
03:06:01,200 --> 03:06:03,349
i think they're intelligent enough to
use that data to make decisions it's the

10753
03:06:03,349 --> 03:06:03,359
use that data to make decisions it's the
 

10754
03:06:03,359 --> 03:06:05,830
use that data to make decisions it's the
same thing as with the testing is if if

10755
03:06:05,830 --> 03:06:05,840
same thing as with the testing is if if
 

10756
03:06:05,840 --> 03:06:07,510
same thing as with the testing is if if
you put that power in the people's hands

10757
03:06:07,510 --> 03:06:07,520
you put that power in the people's hands
 

10758
03:06:07,520 --> 03:06:08,790
you put that power in the people's hands
to know if they're sick or not they're

10759
03:06:08,790 --> 03:06:08,800
to know if they're sick or not they're
 

10760
03:06:08,800 --> 03:06:09,990
to know if they're sick or not they're
going to make

10761
03:06:09,990 --> 03:06:10,000
going to make
 

10762
03:06:10,000 --> 03:06:12,950
going to make
unmask the right decision i think

10763
03:06:12,950 --> 03:06:12,960
unmask the right decision i think
 

10764
03:06:12,960 --> 03:06:15,510
unmask the right decision i think
it's uh that the masks and the testing

10765
03:06:15,510 --> 03:06:15,520
it's uh that the masks and the testing
 

10766
03:06:15,520 --> 03:06:17,910
it's uh that the masks and the testing
has been a bit heartbreaking

10767
03:06:17,910 --> 03:06:17,920
has been a bit heartbreaking
 

10768
03:06:17,920 --> 03:06:19,990
has been a bit heartbreaking
i think it's a good point though that

10769
03:06:19,990 --> 03:06:20,000
i think it's a good point though that
 

10770
03:06:20,000 --> 03:06:21,190
i think it's a good point though that
most people don't seem to have an

10771
03:06:21,190 --> 03:06:21,200
most people don't seem to have an
 

10772
03:06:21,200 --> 03:06:22,950
most people don't seem to have an
objection to testing

10773
03:06:22,950 --> 03:06:22,960
objection to testing
 

10774
03:06:22,960 --> 03:06:25,349
objection to testing
that's a good point yes yeah and then

10775
03:06:25,349 --> 03:06:25,359
that's a good point yes yeah and then
 

10776
03:06:25,359 --> 03:06:26,950
that's a good point yes yeah and then
obviously makamina makes that point

10777
03:06:26,950 --> 03:06:26,960
obviously makamina makes that point
 

10778
03:06:26,960 --> 03:06:29,269
obviously makamina makes that point
brilliantly and still there's very

10779
03:06:29,269 --> 03:06:29,279
brilliantly and still there's very
 

10780
03:06:29,279 --> 03:06:30,230
brilliantly and still there's very
little

10781
03:06:30,230 --> 03:06:30,240
little
 

10782
03:06:30,240 --> 03:06:33,190
little
excitement around that

10783
03:06:33,190 --> 03:06:33,200
excitement around that
 

10784
03:06:33,200 --> 03:06:35,030
excitement around that
but he said he was going to do it i

10785
03:06:35,030 --> 03:06:35,040
but he said he was going to do it i
 

10786
03:06:35,040 --> 03:06:36,630
but he said he was going to do it i
don't understand i mean i haven't spoken

10787
03:06:36,630 --> 03:06:36,640
don't understand i mean i haven't spoken
 

10788
03:06:36,640 --> 03:06:38,630
don't understand i mean i haven't spoken
to him since then so i don't know why

10789
03:06:38,630 --> 03:06:38,640
to him since then so i don't know why
 

10790
03:06:38,640 --> 03:06:40,630
to him since then so i don't know why
he's pushing it well i mean but he can't

10791
03:06:40,630 --> 03:06:40,640
he's pushing it well i mean but he can't
 

10792
03:06:40,640 --> 03:06:43,269
he's pushing it well i mean but he can't
do it alone he has to get so one of the

10793
03:06:43,269 --> 03:06:43,279
do it alone he has to get so one of the
 

10794
03:06:43,279 --> 03:06:46,870
do it alone he has to get so one of the
one of the resistances fda doesn't like

10795
03:06:46,870 --> 03:06:46,880
one of the resistances fda doesn't like
 

10796
03:06:46,880 --> 03:06:48,070
one of the resistances fda doesn't like
cheap things

10797
03:06:48,070 --> 03:06:48,080
cheap things
 

10798
03:06:48,080 --> 03:06:48,950
cheap things
yeah

10799
03:06:48,950 --> 03:06:48,960
yeah
 

10800
03:06:48,960 --> 03:06:50,389
yeah
they don't want to approve it so it

10801
03:06:50,389 --> 03:06:50,399
they don't want to approve it so it
 

10802
03:06:50,399 --> 03:06:52,950
they don't want to approve it so it
makes the mass manufacturer

10803
03:06:52,950 --> 03:06:52,960
makes the mass manufacturer
 

10804
03:06:52,960 --> 03:06:55,030
makes the mass manufacturer
like uh with the emergency exceptions

10805
03:06:55,030 --> 03:06:55,040
like uh with the emergency exceptions
 

10806
03:06:55,040 --> 03:06:57,349
like uh with the emergency exceptions
all those kinds of things very difficult

10807
03:06:57,349 --> 03:06:57,359
all those kinds of things very difficult
 

10808
03:06:57,359 --> 03:06:58,950
all those kinds of things very difficult
and then there's not much money to be

10809
03:06:58,950 --> 03:06:58,960
and then there's not much money to be
 

10810
03:06:58,960 --> 03:07:01,590
and then there's not much money to be
made on it without that i don't know

10811
03:07:01,590 --> 03:07:01,600
made on it without that i don't know
 

10812
03:07:01,600 --> 03:07:03,750
made on it without that i don't know
i think there's just economic pressures

10813
03:07:03,750 --> 03:07:03,760
i think there's just economic pressures
 

10814
03:07:03,760 --> 03:07:05,750
i think there's just economic pressures
against it and because so much

10815
03:07:05,750 --> 03:07:05,760
against it and because so much
 

10816
03:07:05,760 --> 03:07:08,710
against it and because so much
investment

10817
03:07:08,710 --> 03:07:08,720

 

10818
03:07:08,720 --> 03:07:11,030

was uh placed on the vaccines and

10819
03:07:11,030 --> 03:07:11,040
was uh placed on the vaccines and
 

10820
03:07:11,040 --> 03:07:12,790
was uh placed on the vaccines and
obviously there's an incentive mechanism

10821
03:07:12,790 --> 03:07:12,800
obviously there's an incentive mechanism
 

10822
03:07:12,800 --> 03:07:14,870
obviously there's an incentive mechanism
there where the companies sure you know

10823
03:07:14,870 --> 03:07:14,880
there where the companies sure you know
 

10824
03:07:14,880 --> 03:07:17,110
there where the companies sure you know
lobbyists and all those because

10825
03:07:17,110 --> 03:07:17,120
lobbyists and all those because
 

10826
03:07:17,120 --> 03:07:19,349
lobbyists and all those because
there's this machine that says

10827
03:07:19,349 --> 03:07:19,359
there's this machine that says
 

10828
03:07:19,359 --> 03:07:20,309
there's this machine that says
um

10829
03:07:20,309 --> 03:07:20,319
um
 

10830
03:07:20,319 --> 03:07:22,230
um
arguing for tests is difficult because

10831
03:07:22,230 --> 03:07:22,240
arguing for tests is difficult because
 

10832
03:07:22,240 --> 03:07:24,870
arguing for tests is difficult because
the thing that's worked for most severe

10833
03:07:24,870 --> 03:07:24,880
the thing that's worked for most severe
 

10834
03:07:24,880 --> 03:07:27,110
the thing that's worked for most severe
viruses in the past is vaccines

10835
03:07:27,110 --> 03:07:27,120
viruses in the past is vaccines
 

10836
03:07:27,120 --> 03:07:28,870
viruses in the past is vaccines
now we have vaccines why the hell would

10837
03:07:28,870 --> 03:07:28,880
now we have vaccines why the hell would
 

10838
03:07:28,880 --> 03:07:30,309
now we have vaccines why the hell would
you need tests

10839
03:07:30,309 --> 03:07:30,319
you need tests
 

10840
03:07:30,319 --> 03:07:32,070
you need tests
at that time

10841
03:07:32,070 --> 03:07:32,080
at that time
 

10842
03:07:32,080 --> 03:07:34,550
at that time
like why the hell do you need tests when

10843
03:07:34,550 --> 03:07:34,560
like why the hell do you need tests when
 

10844
03:07:34,560 --> 03:07:36,309
like why the hell do you need tests when
we could be working on vaccines it seems

10845
03:07:36,309 --> 03:07:36,319
we could be working on vaccines it seems
 

10846
03:07:36,319 --> 03:07:37,750
we could be working on vaccines it seems
like the obvious thing to be working is

10847
03:07:37,750 --> 03:07:37,760
like the obvious thing to be working is
 

10848
03:07:37,760 --> 03:07:40,630
like the obvious thing to be working is
the vaccines from from their perspective

10849
03:07:40,630 --> 03:07:40,640
the vaccines from from their perspective
 

10850
03:07:40,640 --> 03:07:43,030
the vaccines from from their perspective
but it's not obvious at all to me

10851
03:07:43,030 --> 03:07:43,040
but it's not obvious at all to me
 

10852
03:07:43,040 --> 03:07:45,190
but it's not obvious at all to me
i think you should have both i think you

10853
03:07:45,190 --> 03:07:45,200
i think you should have both i think you
 

10854
03:07:45,200 --> 03:07:46,710
i think you should have both i think you
have vaccines and good testing and that

10855
03:07:46,710 --> 03:07:46,720
have vaccines and good testing and that
 

10856
03:07:46,720 --> 03:07:48,309
have vaccines and good testing and that
covers you

10857
03:07:48,309 --> 03:07:48,319
covers you
 

10858
03:07:48,319 --> 03:07:49,429
covers you
really well because you're always going

10859
03:07:49,429 --> 03:07:49,439
really well because you're always going
 

10860
03:07:49,439 --> 03:07:51,910
really well because you're always going
to have people who don't get vaccinated

10861
03:07:51,910 --> 03:07:51,920
to have people who don't get vaccinated
 

10862
03:07:51,920 --> 03:07:52,870
to have people who don't get vaccinated
i don't know if you've been paying

10863
03:07:52,870 --> 03:07:52,880
i don't know if you've been paying
 

10864
03:07:52,880 --> 03:07:54,710
i don't know if you've been paying
attention to this there's a guy named

10865
03:07:54,710 --> 03:07:54,720
attention to this there's a guy named
 

10866
03:07:54,720 --> 03:07:56,870
attention to this there's a guy named
brett weinstein there's a guy named sam

10867
03:07:56,870 --> 03:07:56,880
brett weinstein there's a guy named sam
 

10868
03:07:56,880 --> 03:07:57,990
brett weinstein there's a guy named sam
harris

10869
03:07:57,990 --> 03:07:58,000
harris
 

10870
03:07:58,000 --> 03:08:00,630
harris
they have good representations

10871
03:08:00,630 --> 03:08:00,640
they have good representations
 

10872
03:08:00,640 --> 03:08:03,110
they have good representations
i would say of uh

10873
03:08:03,110 --> 03:08:03,120
i would say of uh
 

10874
03:08:03,120 --> 03:08:03,990
i would say of uh
of

10875
03:08:03,990 --> 03:08:04,000
of
 

10876
03:08:04,000 --> 03:08:06,230
of
two sides of a perspective on vaccines

10877
03:08:06,230 --> 03:08:06,240
two sides of a perspective on vaccines
 

10878
03:08:06,240 --> 03:08:09,590
two sides of a perspective on vaccines
so from sam harris's perspective

10879
03:08:09,590 --> 03:08:09,600
so from sam harris's perspective
 

10880
03:08:09,600 --> 03:08:12,150
so from sam harris's perspective
it's obvious that everybody should

10881
03:08:12,150 --> 03:08:12,160
it's obvious that everybody should
 

10882
03:08:12,160 --> 03:08:14,870
it's obvious that everybody should
get vaccinated and

10883
03:08:14,870 --> 03:08:14,880
get vaccinated and
 

10884
03:08:14,880 --> 03:08:16,550
get vaccinated and
it's irresponsible

10885
03:08:16,550 --> 03:08:16,560
it's irresponsible
 

10886
03:08:16,560 --> 03:08:18,389
it's irresponsible
to not get vaccinated

10887
03:08:18,389 --> 03:08:18,399
to not get vaccinated
 

10888
03:08:18,399 --> 03:08:20,870
to not get vaccinated
i think he represents a lot of people's

10889
03:08:20,870 --> 03:08:20,880
i think he represents a lot of people's
 

10890
03:08:20,880 --> 03:08:24,230
i think he represents a lot of people's

makes people scared to say that
yeah but on the other hand for someone

11011
03:10:14,630 --> 03:10:14,640
yeah but on the other hand for someone
 

11012
03:10:14,640 --> 03:10:17,110
yeah but on the other hand for someone
to say it's a no-brainer and

11013
03:10:17,110 --> 03:10:17,120
to say it's a no-brainer and
 

11014
03:10:17,120 --> 03:10:18,630
to say it's a no-brainer and
to denigrate people for not being

to denigrate people for not being
 

11016
03:10:18,640 --> 03:10:20,070
to denigrate people for not being

11017
03:10:20,070 --> 03:10:20,080
vaccinated that's not the approach
 

11018
03:10:20,080 --> 03:10:21,349
vaccinated that's not the approach
either because

11019
03:10:21,349 --> 03:10:21,359
either because
 

11020
03:10:21,359 --> 03:10:22,710
either because
they're going to dig in

11021
03:10:22,710 --> 03:10:22,720
they're going to dig in
 

11022
03:10:22,720 --> 03:10:24,550
they're going to dig in
and say i'm not doing this because you

11023
03:10:24,550 --> 03:10:24,560
and say i'm not doing this because you
 

11024
03:10:24,560 --> 03:10:26,710
and say i'm not doing this because you
tell me too right i think the middle

11025
03:10:26,710 --> 03:10:26,720
tell me too right i think the middle
 

11026

tell me too right i think the middle
ground is to say

of people want to become isolated and
 

11206

of people want to become isolated and
they hide from each other but ultimately

03:13:38,950 --> 03:13:38,960
they hide from each other but ultimately
 

11208
03:13:38,960 --> 03:13:40,790
they hide from each other but ultimately
the thing that saves you is

just watching this pandemic
you know with the distance with the

11215
03:13:47,670 --> 03:13:47,680
you know with the distance with the
 

11216
03:13:47,680 --> 03:13:48,790
you know with the distance with the
masks

11217
03:13:48,790 --> 03:13:48,800
masks
 

11218
03:13:48,800 --> 03:13:50,469
masks
that's all fine

11219
03:13:50,469 --> 03:13:50,479
that's all fine
 

11220
03:13:50,479 --> 03:13:53,830
that's all fine
but there's a distancing from people

11221
03:13:53,830 --> 03:13:53,840
but there's a distancing from people
 

11222
03:13:53,840 --> 03:13:56,630
but there's a distancing from people
of that that that um the tension the

03:13:56,630 --> 03:13:56,640
of that that that um the tension the
 

11224
03:13:56,640 --> 03:13:58,630
of that that that um the tension the
breaking of the common humanity between

breaking of the common humanity between
 

11226
03:13:58,640 --> 03:14:00,710
breaking of the common humanity between
people that's one of the reasons i when

11227
03:14:00,710 --> 03:14:00,720
people that's one of the reasons i when
 

11228
03:14:00,720 --> 03:14:02,229
people that's one of the reasons i when
i came to austin

11229

i fell in love with the city because
 

11234
03:14:06,720 --> 03:14:08,870
i fell in love with the city because
even with the masks in the distance

11235
03:14:08,870 --> 03:14:08,880
even with the masks in the distance
 

11236
03:14:08,880 --> 03:14:13,190
even with the masks in the distance
there were still um a camaraderie like a

there were still um a camaraderie like a
 

11238

03:14:19,750 --> 03:14:19,760
and uh that's what i took away from the
 

11244
03:14:19,760 --> 03:14:20,870
and uh that's what i took away from the
plague

11245
03:14:20,870 --> 03:14:20,880
plague
 

11246
03:14:20,880 --> 03:14:23,269
plague
mostly it's told the story of the doctor

11247
03:14:23,269 --> 03:14:23,279
mostly it's told the story of the doctor
 

11248
03:14:23,279 --> 03:14:25,429
mostly it's told the story of the doctor
who basically

11249
03:14:25,429 --> 03:14:25,439
who basically
 

11250
03:14:25,439 --> 03:14:26,950
who basically
gives in

11251
03:14:26,950 --> 03:14:26,960
gives in
 

11252
03:14:26,960 --> 03:14:29,349
gives in
and uh just gives himself as a service

11253
03:14:29,349 --> 03:14:29,359
and uh just gives himself as a service
 

11254
03:14:29,359 --> 03:14:31,910
and uh just gives himself as a service
to others and that that love is the

11255
03:14:31,910 --> 03:14:31,920
to others and that that love is the
 

11256
03:14:31,920 --> 03:14:33,429
to others and that that love is the
thing that liberates him from his own

11257
03:14:33,429 --> 03:14:33,439
thing that liberates him from his own
 

11258
03:14:33,439 --> 03:14:35,110
thing that liberates him from his own
conception of mortality the fact that

11259
03:14:35,110 --> 03:14:35,120
conception of mortality the fact that
 

11260
03:14:35,120 --> 03:14:38,150
conception of mortality the fact that
he's here he's going to die what do you

11261
03:14:38,150 --> 03:14:38,160
he's here he's going to die what do you
 

11262
03:14:38,160 --> 03:14:40,389
he's here he's going to die what do you
think about this

11263
03:14:40,389 --> 03:14:40,399
think about this
 

11264
03:14:40,399 --> 03:14:42,229
think about this
the effect of the virus we talked a lot

11265
03:14:42,229 --> 03:14:42,239
the effect of the virus we talked a lot
 

11266
03:14:42,239 --> 03:14:43,750
the effect of the virus we talked a lot
about biology but

11267
03:14:43,750 --> 03:14:43,760
about biology but
 

11268
03:14:43,760 --> 03:14:47,269
about biology but
the effect of the virus and the

11269
03:14:47,269 --> 03:14:47,279
the effect of the virus and the
 

11270
03:14:47,279 --> 03:14:49,510
the effect of the virus and the
the the fabric of the common humanity

11271
03:14:49,510 --> 03:14:49,520
the the fabric of the common humanity
 

11272
03:14:49,520 --> 03:14:51,269
the the fabric of the common humanity
that connects us

11273
03:14:51,269 --> 03:14:51,279
that connects us
 

11274
03:14:51,279 --> 03:14:54,309
that connects us
well that's what a pandemic does it

11275
03:14:54,309 --> 03:14:54,319
well that's what a pandemic does it
 

11276
03:14:54,319 --> 03:14:55,349
well that's what a pandemic does it
really

11277
03:14:55,349 --> 03:14:55,359
really
 

11278
03:14:55,359 --> 03:14:57,830
really
cuts that right because small outbreaks

11279
03:14:57,830 --> 03:14:57,840
cuts that right because small outbreaks
 

11280
03:14:57,840 --> 03:15:00,790
cuts that right because small outbreaks
are local they don't have global effects

11281
03:15:00,790 --> 03:15:00,800
are local they don't have global effects
 

11282
03:15:00,800 --> 03:15:03,030
are local they don't have global effects
but when you have something this big

11283
03:15:03,030 --> 03:15:03,040
but when you have something this big
 

11284
03:15:03,040 --> 03:15:03,990
but when you have something this big
where

11285
03:15:03,990 --> 03:15:04,000
where
 

11286
03:15:04,000 --> 03:15:07,349
where
pretty much nobody escapes

11287
03:15:07,349 --> 03:15:07,359
pretty much nobody escapes
 

11288
03:15:07,359 --> 03:15:08,630
pretty much nobody escapes
and not just

11289
03:15:08,630 --> 03:15:08,640
and not just
 

11290
03:15:08,640 --> 03:15:10,229
and not just
making people sick

11291
03:15:10,229 --> 03:15:10,239
making people sick
 

11292
03:15:10,239 --> 03:15:10,950
making people sick
it

11293
03:15:10,950 --> 03:15:10,960
it
 

11294
03:15:10,960 --> 03:15:13,510
it
changes your life right people lose jobs

11295
03:15:13,510 --> 03:15:13,520
changes your life right people lose jobs
 

11296
03:15:13,520 --> 03:15:15,429
changes your life right people lose jobs
they change jobs they move somewhere

11297
03:15:15,429 --> 03:15:15,439
they change jobs they move somewhere
 

11298
03:15:15,439 --> 03:15:17,190
they change jobs they move somewhere
else

11299
03:15:17,190 --> 03:15:17,200
else
 

11300
03:15:17,200 --> 03:15:18,830
else
they have all kinds of

11301
03:15:18,830 --> 03:15:18,840
they have all kinds of
 

11302
03:15:18,840 --> 03:15:21,110
they have all kinds of
disruptions you know kids can't go to

11303
03:15:21,110 --> 03:15:21,120
disruptions you know kids can't go to
 

11304
03:15:21,120 --> 03:15:23,830
disruptions you know kids can't go to
school it really shows you i mean i

always like to say

11307
03:15:25,429 --> 03:15:25,439
always like to say
 

11308
03:15:25,439 --> 03:15:28,150
always like to say
a tiny virus can bring

11309
03:15:28,150 --> 03:15:28,160
a tiny virus can bring
 

11310
03:15:28,160 --> 03:15:30,309
a tiny virus can bring
earth to its knees

11311
03:15:30,309 --> 03:15:30,319
earth to its knees
 

11312
03:15:30,319 --> 03:15:31,910
earth to its knees
tiny viruses you can't even see them

11313
03:15:31,910 --> 03:15:31,920
tiny viruses you can't even see them
 

11314
03:15:31,920 --> 03:15:33,349
tiny viruses you can't even see them
that most people don't even think about

11315
03:15:33,349 --> 03:15:33,359
that most people don't even think about
 

11316
03:15:33,359 --> 03:15:35,190
that most people don't even think about
most of the time

11317
03:15:35,190 --> 03:15:35,200
most of the time
 

11318
03:15:35,200 --> 03:15:37,750
most of the time
and the real effect is not just sickness

11319
03:15:37,750 --> 03:15:37,760
and the real effect is not just sickness
 

11320
03:15:37,760 --> 03:15:41,269
and the real effect is not just sickness
it's what it does to people because

11321
03:15:41,269 --> 03:15:41,279
it's what it does to people because
 

11322
03:15:41,279 --> 03:15:43,510
it's what it does to people because
in the end we are animals and most

11323
03:15:43,510 --> 03:15:43,520
in the end we are animals and most
 

11324
03:15:43,520 --> 03:15:45,510
in the end we are animals and most
animals like each other and they

11325
03:15:45,510 --> 03:15:45,520
animals like each other and they
 

11326
03:15:45,520 --> 03:15:46,870
animals like each other and they
interact they have great social

11327
03:15:46,870 --> 03:15:46,880
interact they have great social
 

11328
03:15:46,880 --> 03:15:48,950
interact they have great social
structures and that makes them

11329
03:15:48,950 --> 03:15:48,960
structures and that makes them
 

11330
03:15:48,960 --> 03:15:50,630
structures and that makes them
do well

11331
03:15:50,630 --> 03:15:50,640
do well
 

11332
03:15:50,640 --> 03:15:52,550
do well
and i guess the exception is people in

11333
03:15:52,550 --> 03:15:52,560
and i guess the exception is people in
 

11334
03:15:52,560 --> 03:15:54,710
and i guess the exception is people in
a.i right

11335
03:15:54,710 --> 03:15:54,720
a.i right
 

11336
03:15:54,720 --> 03:15:56,469
a.i right
they could be on their own

11337
03:15:56,469 --> 03:15:56,479
they could be on their own
 

11338
03:15:56,479 --> 03:15:57,910
they could be on their own
well that's why you build robots that

11339
03:15:57,910 --> 03:15:57,920
well that's why you build robots that
 

11340
03:15:57,920 --> 03:15:59,830
well that's why you build robots that
you fall in love with that's right and

11341
03:15:59,830 --> 03:15:59,840
you fall in love with that's right and
 

11342
03:15:59,840 --> 03:16:02,790
you fall in love with that's right and
so i think when uh when a the real story

11343
03:16:02,790 --> 03:16:02,800
so i think when uh when a the real story
 

11344
03:16:02,800 --> 03:16:04,070
so i think when uh when a the real story
is what it does

11345
03:16:04,070 --> 03:16:04,080
is what it does
 

11346
03:16:04,080 --> 03:16:06,469
is what it does
to society for sure which has

11347
03:16:06,469 --> 03:16:06,479
to society for sure which has
 

11348
03:16:06,479 --> 03:16:09,110
to society for sure which has
ramifications way beyond the number of

11349
03:16:09,110 --> 03:16:09,120
ramifications way beyond the number of
 

11350
03:16:09,120 --> 03:16:10,469
ramifications way beyond the number of
people dying

11351
03:16:10,469 --> 03:16:10,479
people dying
 

11352
03:16:10,479 --> 03:16:12,389
people dying
in the vaccines and the tests and all of

11353
03:16:12,389 --> 03:16:12,399
in the vaccines and the tests and all of
 

11354
03:16:12,399 --> 03:16:14,469
in the vaccines and the tests and all of
that and this one has really

11355
03:16:14,469 --> 03:16:14,479
that and this one has really
 

11356
03:16:14,479 --> 03:16:16,389
that and this one has really
made a big rupture and you could tell

11357
03:16:16,389 --> 03:16:16,399
made a big rupture and you could tell
 

11358
03:16:16,399 --> 03:16:18,150
made a big rupture and you could tell
not now so much i think being out and

11359
03:16:18,150 --> 03:16:18,160
not now so much i think being out and
 

11360
03:16:18,160 --> 03:16:20,229
not now so much i think being out and
about now things look

11361

if something happens to someone to reach
 

11398

out and help them
 

11400

where people are mean
 

11404
03:16:58,800 --> 03:16:59,910
where people are mean
and that's

11405
03:16:59,910 --> 03:16:59,920
and that's
 

11406
03:16:59,920 --> 03:17:01,830
and that's
you know that's just the way animals are

11407
03:17:01,830 --> 03:17:01,840
you know that's just the way animals are
 

11408

you know that's just the way animals are
we're not the only ones that can be mean

11409
03:17:03,750 --> 03:17:03,760
we're not the only ones that can be mean
 

11410
03:17:03,760 --> 03:17:05,349
we're not the only ones that can be mean
to our own species

11411
03:17:05,349 --> 03:17:05,359
to our own species
 

11412
03:17:05,359 --> 03:17:06,550
to our own species
yeah but

11413
03:17:06,550 --> 03:17:06,560
yeah but
 

11414
03:17:06,560 --> 03:17:09,990
yeah but
i think most of the motivation for

11415
03:17:09,990 --> 03:17:10,000
i think most of the motivation for
 

11416
03:17:10,000 --> 03:17:11,510
i think most of the motivation for
everything that was done is to help

11417
03:17:11,510 --> 03:17:11,520
everything that was done is to help
 

11418
03:17:11,520 --> 03:17:13,510
everything that was done is to help
other people i mean i i do think that

11419
03:17:13,510 --> 03:17:13,520
other people i mean i i do think that
 

11420
03:17:13,520 --> 03:17:14,790
other people i mean i i do think that
the vaccine

11421
03:17:14,790 --> 03:17:14,800
the vaccine
 

11422
03:17:14,800 --> 03:17:16,630
the vaccine
manufacturers maybe not the leaders but

11423
03:17:16,630 --> 03:17:16,640
manufacturers maybe not the leaders but
 

11424
03:17:16,640 --> 03:17:18,389
manufacturers maybe not the leaders but
the people working in the labs really

11425
03:17:18,389 --> 03:17:18,399
the people working in the labs really
 

11426
03:17:18,399 --> 03:17:20,070
the people working in the labs really
wanted to get this out

11427
03:17:20,070 --> 03:17:20,080
wanted to get this out
 

11428
03:17:20,080 --> 03:17:22,790

to do that so there's i view it as
 

11438
03:17:32,560 --> 03:17:34,309
to do that so there's i view it as
you know we're never going to be 100

11439
03:17:34,309 --> 03:17:34,319
you know we're never going to be 100
 

11440
03:17:34,319 --> 03:17:35,590
you know we're never going to be 100
good

11441
03:17:35,590 --> 03:17:35,600
good
 

11442
03:17:35,600 --> 03:17:37,670
good
because animals are not

11443
03:17:37,670 --> 03:17:37,680
because animals are not
 

11444
03:17:37,680 --> 03:17:38,870
because animals are not
evolution

11445
03:17:38,870 --> 03:17:38,880
evolution
 

11446
03:17:38,880 --> 03:17:40,950
evolution
made us i mean we're lucky we somehow

11447
03:17:40,950 --> 03:17:40,960
made us i mean we're lucky we somehow
 

11448
03:17:40,960 --> 03:17:43,429
made us i mean we're lucky we somehow
rose above by having incredible brain

11449
03:17:43,429 --> 03:17:43,439
rose above by having incredible brain
 

11450
03:17:43,439 --> 03:17:45,030
rose above by having incredible brain
and so forth but a lot of our base

11451
03:17:45,030 --> 03:17:45,040
and so forth but a lot of our base
 

11452
03:17:45,040 --> 03:17:47,030
and so forth but a lot of our base
instincts are animals and you know they

11453
03:17:47,030 --> 03:17:47,040
instincts are animals and you know they
 

11454
03:17:47,040 --> 03:17:49,030
instincts are animals and you know they
chase each other and

11455
03:17:49,030 --> 03:17:49,040
chase each other and
 

11456
03:17:49,040 --> 03:17:51,110
chase each other and
and have alpha males and all that stuff

11457
03:17:51,110 --> 03:17:51,120
and have alpha males and all that stuff
 

11458
03:17:51,120 --> 03:17:52,630
and have alpha males and all that stuff
and and we always have a little bit of

11459
03:17:52,630 --> 03:17:52,640
and and we always have a little bit of
 

11460
03:17:52,640 --> 03:17:56,070
and and we always have a little bit of
that in us but we do have some

11461
03:17:56,070 --> 03:17:56,080
that in us but we do have some
 

11462
03:17:56,080 --> 03:17:59,190
that in us but we do have some
humanity that this really ripped up it

11463
03:17:59,190 --> 03:17:59,200
humanity that this really ripped up it
 

11464
03:17:59,200 --> 03:18:00,870
humanity that this really ripped up it
really did

11465
03:18:00,870 --> 03:18:00,880
really did
 

11466
03:18:00,880 --> 03:18:04,550
really did
and i think for me someone who studied

11467
03:18:04,550 --> 03:18:04,560
and i think for me someone who studied
 

11468
03:18:04,560 --> 03:18:07,030
and i think for me someone who studied
viruses for over 40 years it's just

11469
03:18:07,030 --> 03:18:07,040
viruses for over 40 years it's just
 

11470
03:18:07,040 --> 03:18:09,670
viruses for over 40 years it's just
amazing that an invisible thing can do

11471
03:18:09,670 --> 03:18:09,680
amazing that an invisible thing can do
 

11472
03:18:09,680 --> 03:18:11,190
amazing that an invisible thing can do
that right

11473
03:18:11,190 --> 03:18:11,200
that right
 

11474
03:18:11,200 --> 03:18:12,790
that right
it goes back to the thing you found

11475
03:18:12,790 --> 03:18:12,800
it goes back to the thing you found
 

11476
03:18:12,800 --> 03:18:14,469
it goes back to the thing you found
fascinating which is a virus affecting

11477
03:18:14,469 --> 03:18:14,479
fascinating which is a virus affecting
 

11478
03:18:14,479 --> 03:18:16,870
fascinating which is a virus affecting
human behavior yes or uh behavior of the

11479
03:18:16,870 --> 03:18:16,880
human behavior yes or uh behavior of the
 

11480
03:18:16,880 --> 03:18:18,630
human behavior yes or uh behavior of the
organism

11481
03:18:18,630 --> 03:18:18,640
organism
 

11482
03:18:18,640 --> 03:18:20,150
organism
yes so

11483
03:18:20,150 --> 03:18:20,160
yes so
 

11484
03:18:20,160 --> 03:18:22,469
yes so
you know humans can make weapons and do

11485
03:18:22,469 --> 03:18:22,479
you know humans can make weapons and do
 

11486
03:18:22,479 --> 03:18:24,309
you know humans can make weapons and do
harm and you can see that but this you

11487
03:18:24,309 --> 03:18:24,319
harm and you can see that but this you
 

11488
03:18:24,319 --> 03:18:26,070
harm and you can see that but this you
can't even see yeah

03:18:27,670 --> 03:18:27,680
you can't and look what it has done and
 

11492
03:18:27,680 --> 03:18:29,830
you can't and look what it has done and
it'll do it again there'll be more i

11493
03:18:29,830 --> 03:18:29,840
it'll do it again there'll be more i
 

11494

it'll do it again there'll be more i
just

11495
03:18:31,030 --> 03:18:31,040
just
 

11496
03:18:31,040 --> 03:18:33,030
just
i wish we would be more prepared because

11497
03:18:33,030 --> 03:18:33,040
i wish we would be more prepared because
 

11498
03:18:33,040 --> 03:18:36,550
i wish we would be more prepared because
we know what to do we know we should be

11499
03:18:36,550 --> 03:18:36,560
we know what to do we know we should be
 

11500
03:18:36,560 --> 03:18:39,269
we know what to do we know we should be
making antivirals vaccines masks testing

11501
03:18:39,269 --> 03:18:39,279
making antivirals vaccines masks testing
 

11502
03:18:39,279 --> 03:18:42,150
making antivirals vaccines masks testing
masks making test mode modalities that

11503
03:18:42,150 --> 03:18:42,160
masks making test mode modalities that
 

11504
03:18:42,160 --> 03:18:43,269
masks making test mode modalities that
we can

11505
03:18:43,269 --> 03:18:43,279
we can
 

11506
03:18:43,279 --> 03:18:45,990
we can
really quickly redesign

11507
03:18:45,990 --> 03:18:46,000
really quickly redesign
 

11508
03:18:46,000 --> 03:18:48,309
really quickly redesign
but after sars one all that went out the

11509
03:18:48,309 --> 03:18:48,319
but after sars one all that went out the
 

11510
03:18:48,319 --> 03:18:50,150
but after sars one all that went out the
door people didn't do anything and

11511
03:18:50,150 --> 03:18:50,160
door people didn't do anything and
 

11512
03:18:50,160 --> 03:18:52,710
door people didn't do anything and
that's why we're in this situation so

11513
03:18:52,710 --> 03:18:52,720
that's why we're in this situation so
 

11514
03:18:52,720 --> 03:18:54,550
that's why we're in this situation so
i you know people ask me this all the

11515
03:18:54,550 --> 03:18:54,560
i you know people ask me this all the
 

11516
03:18:54,560 --> 03:18:56,389
i you know people ask me this all the
time are we going to be ready for the

11517
03:18:56,389 --> 03:18:56,399
time are we going to be ready for the
 

11518
03:18:56,399 --> 03:18:57,670
time are we going to be ready for the

fact that we had nuclear weapons for so
 

11540
03:19:20,319 --> 03:19:21,990
fact that we had nuclear weapons for so
many decades and we're still not blowing

out powers all the other stuff
 

11578
03:20:01,439 --> 03:20:03,670
out powers all the other stuff
uh by a large amount and that's why we

11579
03:20:03,670 --> 03:20:03,680
uh by a large amount and that's why we
 

11580
03:20:03,680 --> 03:20:05,510
uh by a large amount and that's why we
don't we have not yet destroyed

11581
03:20:05,510 --> 03:20:05,520
don't we have not yet destroyed
 

11582
03:20:05,520 --> 03:20:07,429
don't we have not yet destroyed
ourselves we kind of there's a lot of

11583
03:20:07,429 --> 03:20:07,439
ourselves we kind of there's a lot of
 

11584
03:20:07,439 --> 03:20:09,349
ourselves we kind of there's a lot of
bickering there's a lot of wars on the

11585
03:20:09,349 --> 03:20:09,359
bickering there's a lot of wars on the
 

11586
03:20:09,359 --> 03:20:11,830
bickering there's a lot of wars on the
surface but underneath it all there's

11587
03:20:11,830 --> 03:20:11,840
surface but underneath it all there's
 

11588
03:20:11,840 --> 03:20:14,870
surface but underneath it all there's
there's this ocean of uh

11589
03:20:14,870 --> 03:20:14,880
there's this ocean of uh
 

11590
03:20:14,880 --> 03:20:17,429
there's this ocean of uh
love for each other i mean i think

11591
03:20:17,429 --> 03:20:17,439
love for each other i mean i think
 

11592
03:20:17,439 --> 03:20:21,269
love for each other i mean i think
there's a evolutionary advantage to that

11593
03:20:21,269 --> 03:20:21,279
there's a evolutionary advantage to that
 

11594
03:20:21,279 --> 03:20:23,429
there's a evolutionary advantage to that
and uh it would be a good explanation

11595
03:20:23,429 --> 03:20:23,439
and uh it would be a good explanation
 

11596
03:20:23,439 --> 03:20:25,190
and uh it would be a good explanation
why we still haven't destroyed ourselves

11597
03:20:25,190 --> 03:20:25,200
why we still haven't destroyed ourselves
 

11598
03:20:25,200 --> 03:20:27,349
why we still haven't destroyed ourselves

uh or even cells are passive and humans
 

11788
03:23:39,040 --> 03:23:40,550
uh or even cells are passive and humans
are kind of active we seem to be making

so uh let me ask you the why question
 

11794
03:23:44,560 --> 03:23:46,469
so uh let me ask you the why question
what do you think is the meaning of this

11795
03:23:46,469 --> 03:23:46,479
what do you think is the meaning of this
 

11796
03:23:46,479 --> 03:23:48,630
what do you think is the meaning of this
life of ours

11797
03:23:48,630 --> 03:23:48,640
life of ours
 

11798
03:23:48,640 --> 03:23:51,190
life of ours
oh there's no meaning it just happened

11799
03:23:51,190 --> 03:23:51,200
oh there's no meaning it just happened
 

11800
03:23:51,200 --> 03:23:52,630
oh there's no meaning it just happened
it's an accident

11801
03:23:52,630 --> 03:23:52,640
it's an accident
 

11802
03:23:52,640 --> 03:23:53,590
it's an accident
um

11803

there are billions and billions of stars
 

11814
03:24:02,239 --> 03:24:03,910
there are billions and billions of stars
out there right so there's a lot of

11815
03:24:03,910 --> 03:24:03,920
out there right so there's a lot of
 

11816
03:24:03,920 --> 03:24:05,110
out there right so there's a lot of
opportunity

11817
03:24:05,110 --> 03:24:05,120
opportunity
 

11818
03:24:05,120 --> 03:24:07,590
opportunity
there's no meaning it's just

11819
03:24:07,590 --> 03:24:07,600
there's no meaning it's just
 

11820
03:24:07,600 --> 03:24:09,510
there's no meaning it's just
a

11821
03:24:09,510 --> 03:24:09,520
a
 

11822
03:24:09,520 --> 03:24:12,150
a
what do they call it a perfect storm of

11823
03:24:12,150 --> 03:24:12,160
what do they call it a perfect storm of
 

11824
03:24:12,160 --> 03:24:14,469
what do they call it a perfect storm of
events that led to molecules being

11825
03:24:14,469 --> 03:24:14,479
events that led to molecules being
 

11826
03:24:14,479 --> 03:24:16,469
events that led to molecules being
formed and eventually i mean it took a

11827
03:24:16,469 --> 03:24:16,479
formed and eventually i mean it took a
 

11828
03:24:16,479 --> 03:24:17,990
formed and eventually i mean it took a
long time for

11829
03:24:17,990 --> 03:24:18,000
long time for
 

11830
03:24:18,000 --> 03:24:20,550
long time for
life to evolve right yeah but it's just

11831
03:24:20,550 --> 03:24:20,560
life to evolve right yeah but it's just
 

11832
03:24:20,560 --> 03:24:22,550
life to evolve right yeah but it's just
driven by

11833
03:24:22,550 --> 03:24:22,560
driven by
 

11834
03:24:22,560 --> 03:24:23,990
driven by
conditions

11835
03:24:23,990 --> 03:24:24,000
conditions
 

11836
03:24:24,000 --> 03:24:25,510
conditions
if something emerged that worked it

11837
03:24:25,510 --> 03:24:25,520
if something emerged that worked it
 

11838
03:24:25,520 --> 03:24:26,950
if something emerged that worked it
would then go on to the next step

11839
03:24:26,950 --> 03:24:26,960
would then go on to the next step
 

11840
03:24:26,960 --> 03:24:29,269
would then go on to the next step
there's no meaning other than that the

11841
03:24:29,269 --> 03:24:29,279
there's no meaning other than that the
 

11842
03:24:29,279 --> 03:24:32,070
there's no meaning other than that the
only difference is that we

11843
03:24:32,070 --> 03:24:32,080
only difference is that we
 

11844
03:24:32,080 --> 03:24:33,670
only difference is that we
and i think many other animals can

11845
03:24:33,670 --> 03:24:33,680
and i think many other animals can
 

11846
03:24:33,680 --> 03:24:35,269
and i think many other animals can
probably we we have the ability we're

11847
03:24:35,269 --> 03:24:35,279
probably we we have the ability we're
 

11848
03:24:35,279 --> 03:24:37,110
probably we we have the ability we're
sentient right we can influence what

11849
03:24:37,110 --> 03:24:37,120
sentient right we can influence what
 

11850
03:24:37,120 --> 03:24:38,550
sentient right we can influence what
happens to us

11851
03:24:38,550 --> 03:24:38,560
happens to us
 

11852
03:24:38,560 --> 03:24:42,309
happens to us
and we can take medicines right we can

11853
03:24:42,309 --> 03:24:42,319
and we can take medicines right we can
 

11854
03:24:42,319 --> 03:24:44,309
and we can take medicines right we can
alter what would normally happen to us

11855
03:24:44,309 --> 03:24:44,319
alter what would normally happen to us
 

11856
03:24:44,319 --> 03:24:47,110
alter what would normally happen to us
so we can remove some of the selection

11857
03:24:47,110 --> 03:24:47,120
so we can remove some of the selection
 

11858
03:24:47,120 --> 03:24:48,630
so we can remove some of the selection
pressure

11859
03:24:48,630 --> 03:24:48,640
pressure
 

11860
03:24:48,640 --> 03:24:50,229
pressure
but i think everything else on the

11861
03:24:50,229 --> 03:24:50,239
but i think everything else on the
 

11862
03:24:50,239 --> 03:24:53,429
but i think everything else on the
planet just goes you know looks for food

11863
03:24:53,429 --> 03:24:53,439
planet just goes you know looks for food
 

11864
03:24:53,439 --> 03:24:55,349
planet just goes you know looks for food
and uh give a lot of offspring so you

11865
03:24:55,349 --> 03:24:55,359
and uh give a lot of offspring so you
 

11866
03:24:55,359 --> 03:24:57,510
and uh give a lot of offspring so you
can perpetuate it's just a natural

11867
03:24:57,510 --> 03:24:57,520
can perpetuate it's just a natural
 

11868
03:24:57,520 --> 03:24:59,510
can perpetuate it's just a natural
biological function yeah they're much

11869
03:24:59,510 --> 03:24:59,520
biological function yeah they're much
 

11870
03:24:59,520 --> 03:25:01,990
biological function yeah they're much
more directly concerned with survival i

11871
03:25:01,990 --> 03:25:02,000
more directly concerned with survival i
 

11872
03:25:02,000 --> 03:25:03,110
more directly concerned with survival i
think sure humans are able to

11873
03:25:03,110 --> 03:25:03,120
think sure humans are able to
 

11874
03:25:03,120 --> 03:25:05,910
think sure humans are able to
contemplate their mortality we can like

11875
03:25:05,910 --> 03:25:05,920
contemplate their mortality we can like
 

11876
03:25:05,920 --> 03:25:08,550
contemplate their mortality we can like
see that even if we're okay today we're

11877
03:25:08,550 --> 03:25:08,560
see that even if we're okay today we're
 

11878
03:25:08,560 --> 03:25:10,950
see that even if we're okay today we're
eventually going to die and we're we

11879
03:25:10,950 --> 03:25:10,960
eventually going to die and we're we
 

11880
03:25:10,960 --> 03:25:12,950
eventually going to die and we're we
really don't like that

11881
03:25:12,950 --> 03:25:12,960
really don't like that
 

11882
03:25:12,960 --> 03:25:15,030
really don't like that
so we try to come up with ways to uh

11883
03:25:15,030 --> 03:25:15,040
so we try to come up with ways to uh
 

11884
03:25:15,040 --> 03:25:16,710
so we try to come up with ways to uh
push that deadline farther and farther

11885
03:25:16,710 --> 03:25:16,720
push that deadline farther and farther
 

11886
03:25:16,720 --> 03:25:18,309
push that deadline farther and farther
away well we have really

11887
03:25:18,309 --> 03:25:18,319
away well we have really
 

11888
03:25:18,319 --> 03:25:20,469
away well we have really
i mean we used to die in our 30s right

11889
03:25:20,469 --> 03:25:20,479
i mean we used to die in our 30s right
 

11890
03:25:20,479 --> 03:25:22,870
i mean we used to die in our 30s right
now it's 70s 80s well most of us used to

11891
03:25:22,870 --> 03:25:22,880
now it's 70s 80s well most of us used to
 

11892
03:25:22,880 --> 03:25:23,830
now it's 70s 80s well most of us used to
die

11893
03:25:23,830 --> 03:25:23,840
die
 

11894
03:25:23,840 --> 03:25:24,790
die
in our

11895
03:25:24,790 --> 03:25:24,800
in our
 

11896
03:25:24,800 --> 03:25:27,110
in our
in the first few weeks that's true

11897
03:25:27,110 --> 03:25:27,120
in the first few weeks that's true
 

11898
03:25:27,120 --> 03:25:29,030
in the first few weeks that's true
yeah infant death

11899
03:25:29,030 --> 03:25:29,040
yeah infant death
 

11900
03:25:29,040 --> 03:25:29,990
yeah infant death
i i

11901
03:25:29,990 --> 03:25:30,000
i i
 

11902
03:25:30,000 --> 03:25:32,070
i i
always tell people the only thing that's

11903
03:25:32,070 --> 03:25:32,080
always tell people the only thing that's
 

11904
03:25:32,080 --> 03:25:34,150
always tell people the only thing that's
100 is death

11905
03:25:34,150 --> 03:25:34,160
100 is death
 

11906
03:25:34,160 --> 03:25:35,670
100 is death
it's the only thing in in the world

11907
03:25:35,670 --> 03:25:35,680
it's the only thing in in the world
 

11908
03:25:35,680 --> 03:25:36,790
it's the only thing in in the world
that's a hundred percent you think about

11909
03:25:36,790 --> 03:25:36,800
that's a hundred percent you think about
 

11910
03:25:36,800 --> 03:25:38,309
that's a hundred percent you think about
your own mortality yeah i never think

11911
03:25:38,309 --> 03:25:38,319
your own mortality yeah i never think
 

11912
03:25:38,319 --> 03:25:40,630
your own mortality yeah i never think
about it i'm just enjoying

11913
03:25:40,630 --> 03:25:40,640
about it i'm just enjoying
 

11914
03:25:40,640 --> 03:25:42,870
about it i'm just enjoying
day to day and i don't really you you

11915
03:25:42,870 --> 03:25:42,880
day to day and i don't really you you
 

11916
03:25:42,880 --> 03:25:46,150
day to day and i don't really you you
work on viruses you don't contemplate

11917
03:25:46,150 --> 03:25:46,160
work on viruses you don't contemplate
 

11918
03:25:46,160 --> 03:25:48,790
work on viruses you don't contemplate
your own mortality given the

11919
03:25:48,790 --> 03:25:48,800
your own mortality given the
 

11920
03:25:48,800 --> 03:25:51,190
your own mortality given the
the deadliness of the virus i i

11921
03:25:51,190 --> 03:25:51,200
the deadliness of the virus i i
 

11922
03:25:51,200 --> 03:25:53,349
the deadliness of the virus i i
around i never thought covert would kill

11923
03:25:53,349 --> 03:25:53,359
around i never thought covert would kill
 

11924
03:25:53,359 --> 03:25:55,750
around i never thought covert would kill
me no i never was afraid of that not at

11925
03:25:55,750 --> 03:25:55,760
me no i never was afraid of that not at
 

11926
03:25:55,760 --> 03:25:57,670
me no i never was afraid of that not at
all i um

11927
03:25:57,670 --> 03:25:57,680
all i um
 

11928
03:25:57,680 --> 03:25:59,990
all i um
i mostly feared for other people getting

11929
03:25:59,990 --> 03:26:00,000
i mostly feared for other people getting
 

11930
03:26:00,000 --> 03:26:02,150
i mostly feared for other people getting
sick especially people who could die of

11931
03:26:02,150 --> 03:26:02,160
sick especially people who could die of
 

11932
03:26:02,160 --> 03:26:03,510
sick especially people who could die of
it i didn't want that to happen to them

11933
03:26:03,510 --> 03:26:03,520
it i didn't want that to happen to them
 

11934
03:26:03,520 --> 03:26:05,590
it i didn't want that to happen to them
but i always thought that

11935
03:26:05,590 --> 03:26:05,600
but i always thought that
 

11936
03:26:05,600 --> 03:26:09,030
but i always thought that
it's obviously not a realistic

11937
03:26:09,030 --> 03:26:09,040
it's obviously not a realistic
 

11938
03:26:09,040 --> 03:26:11,670
it's obviously not a realistic
viewpoint not to be worried

11939
03:26:11,670 --> 03:26:11,680
viewpoint not to be worried
 

11940
03:26:11,680 --> 03:26:13,750
viewpoint not to be worried
because many people are

11941
03:26:13,750 --> 03:26:13,760
because many people are
 

11942
03:26:13,760 --> 03:26:17,030
because many people are
but i've been relatively healthy

11943
03:26:17,030 --> 03:26:17,040
but i've been relatively healthy
 

11944
03:26:17,040 --> 03:26:18,710
but i've been relatively healthy
they should sequence my genome because

11945
03:26:18,710 --> 03:26:18,720
they should sequence my genome because
 

11946
03:26:18,720 --> 03:26:20,550
they should sequence my genome because
it works really well and have a good

11947
03:26:20,550 --> 03:26:20,560
it works really well and have a good
 

11948
03:26:20,560 --> 03:26:22,309
it works really well and have a good
immune system maybe you'd be the first

11949
03:26:22,309 --> 03:26:22,319
immune system maybe you'd be the first
 

11950
03:26:22,319 --> 03:26:24,550
immune system maybe you'd be the first
immortal person i don't think that's got

11951
03:26:24,550 --> 03:26:24,560
immortal person i don't think that's got
 

11952
03:26:24,560 --> 03:26:27,030
immortal person i don't think that's got
to be at first so i don't think so

11953
03:26:27,030 --> 03:26:27,040
to be at first so i don't think so
 

11954
03:26:27,040 --> 03:26:30,150
to be at first so i don't think so
i think that uh biologically you just

11955
03:26:30,150 --> 03:26:30,160
i think that uh biologically you just
 

11956
03:26:30,160 --> 03:26:31,750
i think that uh biologically you just
can't you know the ends of our

11957
03:26:31,750 --> 03:26:31,760
can't you know the ends of our
 

11958
03:26:31,760 --> 03:26:33,429
can't you know the ends of our
chromosomes keep getting shorter and

11959
03:26:33,429 --> 03:26:33,439
chromosomes keep getting shorter and
 

11960
03:26:33,439 --> 03:26:35,670
chromosomes keep getting shorter and
shorter and that's eventually what kills

11961
03:26:35,670 --> 03:26:35,680
shorter and that's eventually what kills
 

11962
03:26:35,680 --> 03:26:36,469
shorter and that's eventually what kills
us

11963
03:26:36,469 --> 03:26:36,479
us
 

11964
03:26:36,479 --> 03:26:39,590
us
um so you just can't keep going on

11965
03:26:39,590 --> 03:26:39,600
um so you just can't keep going on
 

11966
03:26:39,600 --> 03:26:42,150
um so you just can't keep going on
but um that's fine i i don't need to

11967
03:26:42,150 --> 03:26:42,160
but um that's fine i i don't need to
 

11968
03:26:42,160 --> 03:26:43,910
but um that's fine i i don't need to
i understand from the vampires that it's

11969
03:26:43,910 --> 03:26:43,920
i understand from the vampires that it's
 

11970
03:26:43,920 --> 03:26:47,269
i understand from the vampires that it's
not good to live forever

11971
03:26:47,269 --> 03:26:47,279
not good to live forever
 

11972
03:26:47,279 --> 03:26:49,590
not good to live forever
i guess make the most of the of the time

11973
03:26:49,590 --> 03:26:49,600
i guess make the most of the of the time
 

11974
03:26:49,600 --> 03:26:52,229
i guess make the most of the of the time
you got that's the uh bacteria live a

11975
03:26:52,229 --> 03:26:52,239
you got that's the uh bacteria live a
 

11976
03:26:52,239 --> 03:26:54,150
you got that's the uh bacteria live a
much shorter time so we got that on

11977
03:26:54,150 --> 03:26:54,160
much shorter time so we got that on
 

11978
03:26:54,160 --> 03:26:56,790
much shorter time so we got that on
bacteria bacteria are

11979
03:26:56,790 --> 03:26:56,800
bacteria bacteria are
 

11980
03:26:56,800 --> 03:26:57,590
bacteria bacteria are
just

11981
03:26:57,590 --> 03:26:57,600
just
 

11982
03:26:57,600 --> 03:26:59,349
just
you know little bags of chemicals that

11983
03:26:59,349 --> 03:26:59,359
you know little bags of chemicals that
 

11984
03:26:59,359 --> 03:27:01,830
you know little bags of chemicals that
that split so they have no

11985
03:27:01,830 --> 03:27:01,840
