there are absolutely lines and
 

127
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,790
there are absolutely lines and
more so than the lines there are lines

128
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:28,800
more so than the lines there are lines
 

129
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,869
more so than the lines there are lines
that divide what our primary mission is

so different intelligence organizations
are prioritized to collect certain types

142
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:42,239
are prioritized to collect certain types

are prioritized to collect certain types
of intelligence and then

is essentially what happens when you
serve in the executive branch you serve

332
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:53,759
serve in the executive branch you serve
 

333
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,950
serve in the executive branch you serve
the executive

334
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:54,960
the executive
 

335
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,350
the executive
so what's the role the director of the

336
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:57,360
so what's the role the director of the
 

337
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,670
so what's the role the director of the
cia versus the president

338
00:05:59,670 --> 00:05:59,680
cia versus the president
 

339
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,749
cia versus the president
what's that dance like so the the

340
00:06:01,749 --> 00:06:01,759
what's that dance like so the the
 

341
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,909
what's that dance like so the the
president really leads

342
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:03,919
president really leads
 

343
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,790
president really leads
the focus of the cia the president is

344
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:06,800
the focus of the cia the president is
 

345
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,110
the focus of the cia the president is
the commander-in-chief for the military

346
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:09,120
the commander-in-chief for the military
 

347
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,350
the commander-in-chief for the military
but the the executive the president is

348
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:11,360
but the the executive the president is
 

349
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,510
but the the executive the president is
also the executive for

350
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:13,520
also the executive for
 

351
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,270
also the executive for
the entirety of the intelligence

352
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:15,280
the entirety of the intelligence
 

353
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,230
the entirety of the intelligence
community so he's the the ultimate

354
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:18,240
community so he's the the ultimate
 

355
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,510
community so he's the the ultimate
customer

356
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:19,520
customer
 

357
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,830
customer
if you look at it like a business

358
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:21,840
if you look at it like a business
 

359
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,909
if you look at it like a business
the customer the person spending the

360
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:23,919
the customer the person spending the
 

361
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,150
the customer the person spending the
money is the president and the director

362
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,160
money is the president and the director
 

363
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,430
money is the president and the director
is the ceo

364
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:27,440
is the ceo
 

365
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,430
is the ceo
so if the director doesn't create what

366
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:29,440
so if the director doesn't create what
 

367
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,790
so if the director doesn't create what
the president wants there's going to be

368
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:30,800
the president wants there's going to be
 

369
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,230
the president wants there's going to be
a new director that's why the director

370
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:32,240
a new director that's why the director
 

371
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,909
a new director that's why the director
of cia is a presidential appointed

372
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:33,919
of cia is a presidential appointed
 

373
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,510
of cia is a presidential appointed
position sometimes they're extremely

375
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,510

qualified intelligence professionals
 

377
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,790
qualified intelligence professionals
sometimes they're just professional

378
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:38,800
sometimes they're just professional
 

379
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,390
sometimes they're just professional
politicians or soldiers that get put

380
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:40,400
politicians or soldiers that get put
 

381
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,950
politicians or soldiers that get put
into that seat because the president

382
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:42,960
into that seat because the president
 

383
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,670
into that seat because the president
trusts them to do what he wants them to

384
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:45,680
trusts them to do what he wants them to

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,629
trusts them to do what he wants them to

00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:49,759
gaping
 

391
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,629
gaping
area that causes problems but that's

392
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:52,639
area that causes problems but that's
 

393
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,070
area that causes problems but that's
still the way it is

394
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,080
still the way it is
 

395
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,670
still the way it is
so you think this is a

396
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:55,680
so you think this is a
 

397
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,670
so you think this is a
problematic configuration of the whole

398
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:57,680
problematic configuration of the whole
 

399
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,589
problematic configuration of the whole
system massive flaw in the system it is

400
00:06:59,589 --> 00:06:59,599
system massive flaw in the system it is
 

401
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,670
system massive flaw in the system it is
a massive flaw in the system because

402
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:01,680
a massive flaw in the system because
 

403
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,270
a massive flaw in the system because
if you're essentially appointing a

404
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:03,280
if you're essentially appointing a
 

405
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,430
if you're essentially appointing a
director to do what you want them to do

406
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:05,440
director to do what you want them to do
 

407
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,950
director to do what you want them to do
then you're

408
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:06,960
then you're
 

409
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,589
then you're
assigning a crony and that's what we

410
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:09,599
assigning a crony and that's what we
 

411
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,270
assigning a crony and that's what we
define corruption as within the united

412
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:11,280
define corruption as within the united
 

413
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,710
define corruption as within the united
states and inside the united states we

414
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:12,720
states and inside the united states we
 

415
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,550
states and inside the united states we
say if you pick somebody outside of

00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:14,560
say if you pick somebody outside of

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,909
say if you pick somebody outside of
merit for any other reason other than

00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:15,919
merit for any other reason other than
 

419
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,230
merit for any other reason other than
merit then it's cronyism or it's

420
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:18,240
merit then it's cronyism or it's
 

421
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,430
merit then it's cronyism or it's
nepotism

422
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:19,440
nepotism
 

423
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,110
nepotism
here that's exactly what our structure

424
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,120
here that's exactly what our structure
 

425
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,870
here that's exactly what our structure
is built on all presidential appointees

426
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:22,880
is built on all presidential appointees
 

427
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,469
is built on all presidential appointees
are appointed on something other than

428
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:24,479
are appointed on something other than
 

429
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,629
are appointed on something other than
merit so for an intelligence agency to

430
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:26,639
merit so for an intelligence agency to
 

431
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,469
merit so for an intelligence agency to
be effective it has to

432
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:28,479
be effective it has to
 

433
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,710
be effective it has to
discover the truth and communicate that

434
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:30,720
discover the truth and communicate that
 

435
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,270
discover the truth and communicate that
truth and maybe if you're appointing the

436
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:33,280
truth and maybe if you're appointing the
 

437
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,510
truth and maybe if you're appointing the
director of that agency you're not

438
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:35,520
director of that agency you're not
 

439
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,430
director of that agency you're not
they're less likely to communicate the

440
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:37,440
they're less likely to communicate the
 

441
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,430
they're less likely to communicate the
truth to you unless the truth aligns

442
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:39,440
truth to you unless the truth aligns
 

443
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,589
truth to you unless the truth aligns
perfectly with your desired worldview

444
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:41,599
perfectly with your desired worldview
 

445
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,189
perfectly with your desired worldview
well not necessarily perfectly because

446
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:43,199
well not necessarily perfectly because
 

447
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,110
well not necessarily perfectly because
there are other steps right they have to

448
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:45,120
there are other steps right they have to
 

449
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,710
there are other steps right they have to
be they have to go in front of congress

450
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:46,720
be they have to go in front of congress
 

451
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,110
be they have to go in front of congress
and they have to have the support of of

452
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:49,120
and they have to have the support of of
 

453
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,830
and they have to have the support of of
multiple legislatures uh or legislators

454
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:51,840
multiple legislatures uh or legislators
 

455
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,790
multiple legislatures uh or legislators
but they

456
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:52,800
but they
 

457
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,749
but they
they're

458
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:53,759
they're
 

459
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,430
they're
the challenge is that the short list of

460
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:55,440
the challenge is that the short list of
 

461
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,749
the challenge is that the short list of
people who even get the opportunity

462
00:07:57,749 --> 00:07:57,759
people who even get the opportunity
 

463
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,589
people who even get the opportunity
aren't a meritorious list it's a short

464
00:07:59,589 --> 00:07:59,599
aren't a meritorious list it's a short
 

465
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,029
aren't a meritorious list it's a short
list based off of who the president is

466
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:01,039
list based off of who the president is
 

467
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,469
list based off of who the president is
picking or who the would-be president is

468
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:02,479
picking or who the would-be president is
 

469
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,029
picking or who the would-be president is
picking now i think we've proven

470
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:05,039
picking now i think we've proven
 

471
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,510
picking now i think we've proven
that an intelligence organization can be

472
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:07,520
that an intelligence organization can be
 

473
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,029
that an intelligence organization can be
an intelligence organization can be

474
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:09,039
an intelligence organization can be
 

475
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,430
an intelligence organization can be
extremely effective even within the

476
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:11,440
extremely effective even within the
 

477
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,469
extremely effective even within the
flawed system yeah the challenge is how

478
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:14,479
flawed system yeah the challenge is how
 

479
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,629
flawed system yeah the challenge is how
much more effective could we be if we

480
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:16,639
much more effective could we be if we
 

481
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,950
much more effective could we be if we
improved and that's

482
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:18,960
improved and that's
 

483
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,469
improved and that's
i think that's the challenge that faces

484
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:20,479
i think that's the challenge that faces
 

485
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,990
i think that's the challenge that faces
a lot of the us government i think

486
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:22,000
a lot of the us government i think
 

487
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,909
a lot of the us government i think
that's a challenge that has resulted in

488
00:08:25,909 --> 00:08:25,919
that's a challenge that has resulted in
 

489
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,830
that's a challenge that has resulted in
what we see today when it comes to the

490
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:27,840
what we see today when it comes to the
 

491
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,150
what we see today when it comes to the
decline of american power and american

492
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:30,160
decline of american power and american
 

493
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,310
decline of american power and american
influence the rise of foreign influence

494
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:32,320

yeah
but they they're very limited

560
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:38,880
but they they're very limited
 

561
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,470
but they they're very limited
uh in terms of what they have to

uh in terms of what they have to
 

563
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,790
uh in terms of what they have to
prioritize and then if you look at a

00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:42,800
prioritize and then if you look at a
 

565
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,710
prioritize and then if you look at a
four-year cycle two years of that is

566
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:44,720
four-year cycle two years of that is
 

567

deep cronyism such deep corruption
can possibly yield true real results and

866
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:41,360
can possibly yield true real results and
 

867
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,949
can possibly yield true real results and
yet somehow there are real results

868
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:42,959
yet somehow there are real results
 

869
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,590
yet somehow there are real results
happening so it's either excessive waste

870
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:45,600
happening so it's either excessive waste
 

871
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,990
happening so it's either excessive waste
and an accidental win or there really is

872
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:48,000
and an accidental win or there really is
 

873
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,430
and an accidental win or there really is
a system and a process there that's

874
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:49,440
a system and a process there that's
 

875
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,990
a system and a process there that's
functioning so this winning idea is very

876
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,000
functioning so this winning idea is very
 

877
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,310
functioning so this winning idea is very
interesting in what way short term and

why did he have that calculation because

1010
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:13,280
why did he have that calculation because
 

1011
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,829
why did he have that calculation because
in 2014 it worked

1012
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:15,839
in 2014 it worked
 

1013

the conflict
 

1027

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,110
so essentially there was no conflict it
worked in 2008 when he took georgia

1030

worked in 2008 when he took georgia
 

1031

he invaded georgia the exact same same
 

1035
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,190
he invaded georgia the exact same same
way and it worked so in 2008 it worked

1036
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:39,200
way and it worked so in 2008 it worked
 

1037
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,789
way and it worked so in 2008 it worked
in 2014 it worked there was no reason to

1038
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:40,799
in 2014 it worked there was no reason to
 

1039
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,950
in 2014 it worked there was no reason to
believe it wasn't going to work again

1040
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:42,960
believe it wasn't going to work again
 

1041
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,350

so he just carried out the same campaign

1042
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:45,360
so he just carried out the same campaign
 

1043
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,390
so he just carried out the same campaign
but this time

1044
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:46,400
but this time
 

1045
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,750
but this time
something was different that was a

1046
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:47,760
something was different that was a
 

1047
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,070
something was different that was a
miscalculation for sure on the part of

1048
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,080
miscalculation for sure on the part of
 

1049
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,070
miscalculation for sure on the part of
putin and the reason that there was no

1050
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:52,080
putin and the reason that there was no
 

1051
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,270
putin and the reason that there was no
support from the west because let's not

1052
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:53,280
support from the west because let's not
 

1053
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,230
support from the west because let's not
forget

1054
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:54,240
forget
 

1055
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,230
forget
there is no support there is nothing

1056
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:56,240
there is no support there is nothing
 

1057
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,350
there is no support there is nothing
other than the lend lease act

1058
00:17:59,350 --> 00:17:59,360
other than the lend lease act
 

1059
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,430
other than the lend lease act
which is putting ukraine in massive debt

1060
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:01,440
which is putting ukraine in massive debt
 

1061
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,190
which is putting ukraine in massive debt
right now to the west

1062
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:03,200
right now to the west
 

1063
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,789
right now to the west
that's the only form of support they're

1064
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:04,799
that's the only form of support they're
 

1065
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,150
that's the only form of support they're
getting from nato or the united states

1066
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:08,160
getting from nato or the united states
 

1067
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,870
getting from nato or the united states
so

1068
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:08,880
so
 

1069
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,630
so
if somebody believed ukraine would win

1070
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:10,640
if somebody believed ukraine would win
 

1071

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:12,789
if somebody believed ukraine had a
chance they would have gotten more

1074
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:12,799
chance they would have gotten more
 

1075
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,590
chance they would have gotten more
material support than just debt and we

1076
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:15,600
material support than just debt and we
 

1077
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,590
material support than just debt and we
can jump into that anytime you want to

1078
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:17,600
can jump into that anytime you want to
 

1079
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,350
can jump into that anytime you want to
but the whole world miscalculated

predominant calculation
 

1089
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,750

influence from oligarchs and corruption
and so on a lot of that

1884
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:53,760
and so on a lot of that
 

1885
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,070
and so on a lot of that
was the factions were brought together

and a lot of that military equipment has
 

2189

and a lot of that military equipment has
actually been the thing that turned the

2190
00:37:17,589 --> 00:37:17,599
actually been the thing that turned the
 

2191
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,470
actually been the thing that turned the
tides of war a couple of times already

currently that's the highmar systems

currently that's the highmar systems
 

2195
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:25,270
currently that's the highmar systems
so you mentioned sort of

2196
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:25,280
so you mentioned sort of
 

2197
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,670
so you mentioned sort of
putin can't afford to lose

2198
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:27,680
putin can't afford to lose
 

2199
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,910
putin can't afford to lose
but winning can look a different way so

2200
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:29,920
but winning can look a different way so
 

2201
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,550
but winning can look a different way so
you've kind of defined so on at this

2202
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:32,560
you've kind of defined so on at this
 

2203
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,310
you've kind of defined so on at this
moment

2204
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:34,320
moment
 

2205
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,230
moment
the prediction is that winning looks

2206
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:36,240
the prediction is that winning looks
 

2207
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,790
the prediction is that winning looks
like capturing not just the east

2208
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:38,800
like capturing not just the east
 

2209
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,270
like capturing not just the east
but the south of ukraine

2210
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:41,280
but the south of ukraine
 

2211
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,230
but the south of ukraine
but

2212
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:42,240
but
 

2213
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,390
but
you could have narratives of winning

2214
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:44,400
you could have narratives of winning
 

2215
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,109
you could have narratives of winning
that return back to the

2216
00:37:47,109 --> 00:37:47,119
that return back to the
 

2217
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:48,550
that return back to the
uh what was at the beginning of this

2218
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:48,560
uh what was at the beginning of this
 

2219
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,390
uh what was at the beginning of this
year before the invasion correct that

2220
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:50,400
year before the invasion correct that
 

2221
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,990
year before the invasion correct that
crimea

2222

crimea
 

2223
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,670
crimea
is still with russia

2224
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:53,680
is still with russia
 

2225
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,349
is still with russia
there's some kind of negotiated thing

2226
00:37:55,349 --> 00:37:55,359
there's some kind of negotiated thing
 

2227
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,589
there's some kind of negotiated thing
about donbass where it still stays with

2228
00:37:57,589 --> 00:37:57,599
about donbass where it still stays with
 

2229
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,750
about donbass where it still stays with
ukraine but there's some public

2230
00:37:59,750 --> 00:37:59,760
ukraine but there's some public
 

2231
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,670
ukraine but there's some public
government yeah yeah

now
 

2237
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,910
now
and that could still be defined through

2238
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:05,920
and that could still be defined through
 

2239
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,190
and that could still be defined through
mechanisms

2240
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:07,200
mechanisms
 

2241
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,270
mechanisms
as russia winning as russian winning for

2242
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:09,280
as russia winning as russian winning for

and you kind of negotiate i mean that
 

2253
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,030
and you kind of negotiate i mean that
seems to be how

2254
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:21,040
seems to be how
 

2255
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,270
seems to be how
geopolitics works is everybody can walk

2256
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:23,280
geopolitics works is everybody can walk
 

2257
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,829
geopolitics works is everybody can walk
away with a win-win story

2258
00:38:25,829 --> 00:38:25,839
away with a win-win story
 

2259
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:27,910
away with a win-win story
and then the world progresses

2260
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:27,920
and then the world progresses
 

2261
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,430
and then the world progresses
with the lessons learned that's the high

2262
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:29,440
with the lessons learned that's the high
 

2263
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,430
with the lessons learned that's the high
likely that's the most probable outcome

2264
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:31,440
likely that's the most probable outcome
 

2265
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,589
likely that's the most probable outcome
the most probable outcome is that

2266
00:38:33,589 --> 00:38:33,599
the most probable outcome is that
 

2267
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,750
the most probable outcome is that
ukraine remains

2268
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:35,760
ukraine remains
 

2269
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,710
ukraine remains
in air quotes a sovereign nation

in air quotes a sovereign nation
it's not going to be truly sovereign

2272

it's not going to be truly sovereign
 

2273
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,430
it's not going to be truly sovereign
because it will become

it will
 

2277
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,430
it will
have to have new government put in place

2278
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:47,440
have to have new government put in place
 

2279
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,270
have to have new government put in place
zielinski will it's extremely unlikely

00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,630
zielinski will it's extremely unlikely
he will be president

2282

he will be president
 

2283
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,109
he will be president
because he has gone too far to

because he has gone too far to
 

2285
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:54,950

00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,790
separate the ukrainian people from the
autocratic power of russia so he would

to remember that so we're taught
 

4495
01:16:31,199 --> 01:16:32,390
to remember that so we're taught
a very specific skill to

4496
01:16:32,390 --> 01:16:32,400
a very specific skill to
 

4497
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:34,310
a very specific skill to
compartmentalize

4498
01:16:34,310 --> 01:16:34,320
compartmentalize
 

4499
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:36,870
compartmentalize
our true self

4500
01:16:36,870 --> 01:16:36,880
our true self
 

4501
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:40,630
our true self
separately but make that true self

4502
01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:40,640
separately but make that true self
 

4503
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:43,590
separately but make that true self
the true identity so then we can still

4504
01:16:43,590 --> 01:16:43,600
the true identity so then we can still
 

4505
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,750
the true identity so then we can still
live and act and and

4506
01:16:45,750 --> 01:16:45,760
live and act and and
 

4507
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:47,669
live and act and and
effectively carry out our cover legend

4508
01:16:47,669 --> 01:16:47,679
effectively carry out our cover legend
 

4509
01:16:47,679 --> 01:16:49,430
effectively carry out our cover legend
without ever losing

01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:51,189
without ever losing
sight without ever losing that compass

4512

01:16:53,510 --> 01:16:53,520
true north of who we actually are and
 

4515
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:55,430
true north of who we actually are and
then we can compartmentalize and secure

4516
01:16:55,430 --> 01:16:55,440
then we can compartmentalize and secure
 

4517
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:57,110
then we can compartmentalize and secure
all the information that we need retain

4518
01:16:57,110 --> 01:16:57,120
all the information that we need retain
 

4519
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:59,030
all the information that we need retain
it remember it but then return to our

4520
01:16:59,030 --> 01:16:59,040
it remember it but then return to our
 

4521
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:00,229
it remember it but then return to our
true self

4522
01:17:00,229 --> 01:17:00,239
true self
 

4523
01:17:00,239 --> 01:17:01,990
true self
when we when we get back to a position

4524
01:17:01,990 --> 01:17:02,000
when we when we get back to a position
 

4525
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,590
when we when we get back to a position
of safety is it possible to do that so

4526
01:17:05,590 --> 01:17:05,600
of safety is it possible to do that so
 

4527
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:08,229
of safety is it possible to do that so
i i just have kind of anecdotal evidence

4528
01:17:08,229 --> 01:17:08,239
i i just have kind of anecdotal evidence
 

4529
01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:10,390
i i just have kind of anecdotal evidence
for myself i really try to be the exact

4530
01:17:10,390 --> 01:17:10,400
for myself i really try to be the exact
 

4531
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:12,390
for myself i really try to be the exact
same person in all conditions which

4532
01:17:12,390 --> 01:17:12,400
same person in all conditions which
 

4533
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,870
same person in all conditions which
makes it very easy

4534
01:17:14,870 --> 01:17:14,880
makes it very easy
 

4535
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:17,030
makes it very easy
like if you're not lying

4536
01:17:17,030 --> 01:17:17,040
like if you're not lying
 

4537
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:19,750
like if you're not lying
it makes it very easy to

4538
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:19,760
it makes it very easy to
 

4539
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,750
it makes it very easy to
first of all to exist but also to

4540
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:21,760
first of all to exist but also to
 

4541
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:23,990
first of all to exist but also to
communicate a kind of authenticity and

4542
01:17:23,990 --> 01:17:24,000
communicate a kind of authenticity and
 

4543
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,990
communicate a kind of authenticity and
genuineness which i think is really

4544
01:17:25,990 --> 01:17:26,000
genuineness which i think is really
 

4545
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,750
genuineness which i think is really
important like trust

4546
01:17:27,750 --> 01:17:27,760
important like trust
 

4547
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:29,590
important like trust
and integrity around trust is extremely

4548
01:17:29,590 --> 01:17:29,600
and integrity around trust is extremely
 

4549
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:31,030
and integrity around trust is extremely
important to me it's the thing that

4550
01:17:31,030 --> 01:17:31,040
important to me it's the thing that
 

4551
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:32,310
important to me it's the thing that
opens doors

4552
01:17:32,310 --> 01:17:32,320
opens doors
 

4553
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:34,709
opens doors
and maintains relationships

4554
01:17:34,709 --> 01:17:34,719
and maintains relationships
 

4555
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:35,510
and maintains relationships
and

4556
01:17:35,510 --> 01:17:35,520

why am i in control of this interview
 

5041
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:20,550
why am i in control of this interview
exactly because the person in control is

5042
01:25:20,550 --> 01:25:20,560
exactly because the person in control is
 

5043
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:22,310
exactly because the person in control is
the person asking questions

5044
01:25:22,310 --> 01:25:22,320
the person asking questions
 

5045
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:23,510
the person asking questions
yeah

5053
01:25:30,639 --> 01:25:31,910
listening
you're exactly right guess where this

5054
01:25:31,910 --> 01:25:31,920
you're exactly right guess where this
 

5055
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:34,149
you're exactly right guess where this
conversation goes yeah anywhere you

5056
01:25:34,149 --> 01:25:34,159
conversation goes yeah anywhere you
 

5057
01:25:34,159 --> 01:25:35,750
conversation goes yeah anywhere you
choose to take it because you're the one

5058
01:25:35,750 --> 01:25:35,760
choose to take it because you're the one
 

5059
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:37,510
choose to take it because you're the one
asking questions every time i answer a

5060
01:25:37,510 --> 01:25:37,520
asking questions every time i answer a
 

5061
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:39,910
asking questions every time i answer a
question i am creating a pattern of

5062
01:25:39,910 --> 01:25:39,920
question i am creating a pattern of
 

5063
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:41,510
question i am creating a pattern of
obedience to you

5064
01:25:41,510 --> 01:25:41,520
obedience to you
 

5065
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:43,430
obedience to you
which subliminally subconsciously makes

5066
01:25:43,430 --> 01:25:43,440
which subliminally subconsciously makes
 

5067
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:45,270
which subliminally subconsciously makes
me that much more apt to answer your

5068
01:25:45,270 --> 01:25:45,280
me that much more apt to answer your
 

5069
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:46,470
me that much more apt to answer your
questions of course you can always turn

5070
01:25:46,470 --> 01:25:46,480
questions of course you can always turn
 

5071
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:48,229
questions of course you can always turn
that and ask start asking me questions

5072
01:25:48,229 --> 01:25:48,239
that and ask start asking me questions
 

5073
01:25:48,239 --> 01:25:50,709
that and ask start asking me questions
it should you know uh so but you're

5074
01:25:50,709 --> 01:25:50,719
it should you know uh so but you're
 

5075
01:25:50,719 --> 01:25:52,709
it should you know uh so but you're
saying that there's through this this

5076
01:25:52,709 --> 01:25:52,719
saying that there's through this this
 

5077
01:25:52,719 --> 01:25:54,390
saying that there's through this this
through conversation you can call it

5078
01:25:54,390 --> 01:25:54,400
through conversation you can call it
 

5079
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:57,510
through conversation you can call it
interviewing you can start to

5080
01:25:57,510 --> 01:25:57,520
interviewing you can start to
 

5081
01:25:57,520 --> 01:25:59,830
interviewing you can start to
you can start to see

5082
01:25:59,830 --> 01:25:59,840
you can start to see
 

5083
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:01,189
you can start to see
um

5084
01:26:01,189 --> 01:26:01,199
um
 

5085
01:26:01,199 --> 01:26:02,709
um
see cracks

5086
01:26:02,709 --> 01:26:02,719
see cracks
 

5087
01:26:02,719 --> 01:26:05,510
see cracks
in the story of the person

5088
01:26:05,510 --> 01:26:05,520
in the story of the person
 

5089
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:07,590
in the story of the person
and the degree to which they exaggerate

5090
01:26:07,590 --> 01:26:07,600
and the degree to which they exaggerate
 

5091
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:10,310
and the degree to which they exaggerate
or lie or

5092
01:26:10,310 --> 01:26:10,320
or lie or
 

5093
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:11,990
or lie or
to see how much they could be trusted

5094
01:26:11,990 --> 01:26:12,000
to see how much they could be trusted
 

5095
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,830
to see how much they could be trusted
that kind of stuff what i'm saying is

5096
01:26:13,830 --> 01:26:13,840
that kind of stuff what i'm saying is
 

5097
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:15,430
that kind of stuff what i'm saying is
that through a conversation you develop

5098
01:26:15,430 --> 01:26:15,440
that through a conversation you develop
 

5099
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:17,350
that through a conversation you develop
a baseline right like even just in the

5100
01:26:17,350 --> 01:26:17,360
a baseline right like even just in the
 

5101
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:19,270
a baseline right like even just in the
last the last the first part of our

5102
01:26:19,270 --> 01:26:19,280
last the last the first part of our
 

5103
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:20,870
last the last the first part of our
conversation i've been able to create

5104
01:26:20,870 --> 01:26:20,880
conversation i've been able to create
 

5105
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:23,110
conversation i've been able to create
some baseline elements about you

5106
01:26:23,110 --> 01:26:23,120
some baseline elements about you
 

5107
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:24,550
some baseline elements about you
you've been able to create baseline

5108
01:26:24,550 --> 01:26:24,560
you've been able to create baseline
 

5109
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:26,229
you've been able to create baseline
elements about me maybe they're just not

5110
01:26:26,229 --> 01:26:26,239
elements about me maybe they're just not
 

5111
01:26:26,239 --> 01:26:27,590
elements about me maybe they're just not
friend of mind

5112
01:26:27,590 --> 01:26:27,600
friend of mind
 

5113
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,990
friend of mind
from those baselines now we can push

5114
01:26:29,990 --> 01:26:30,000
from those baselines now we can push
 

5115
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,950
from those baselines now we can push
through more intentional questions

5116
01:26:32,950 --> 01:26:32,960
through more intentional questions
 

5117
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:34,229
through more intentional questions
to test

5118
01:26:34,229 --> 01:26:34,239
to test
 

5119
01:26:34,239 --> 01:26:36,070
to test
got it to test whether or not the person

5120
01:26:36,070 --> 01:26:36,080
got it to test whether or not the person
 

5121
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:37,350
got it to test whether or not the person
is being truthful because they're

5122
01:26:37,350 --> 01:26:37,360
is being truthful because they're
 

5123
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:39,590
is being truthful because they're
operating within their baseline or if

5124
01:26:39,590 --> 01:26:39,600
operating within their baseline or if
 

5125
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:41,270
operating within their baseline or if
you are triggering

5126
01:26:41,270 --> 01:26:41,280
you are triggering
 

5127
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:42,870
you are triggering
uh sensitivities outside of their

5128
01:26:42,870 --> 01:26:42,880
uh sensitivities outside of their
 

5129
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:44,229
uh sensitivities outside of their
baseline and then you can start to see

5130
01:26:44,229 --> 01:26:44,239
baseline and then you can start to see
 

5131
01:26:44,239 --> 01:26:45,270
baseline and then you can start to see
their tells

5132
01:26:45,270 --> 01:26:45,280
their tells
 

5133
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:47,270
their tells
that's fascinating yeah baseline like uh

5134
01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:47,280
that's fascinating yeah baseline like uh
 

5135
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:49,270
that's fascinating yeah baseline like uh
even even like yeah the tells right the

5136
01:26:49,270 --> 01:26:49,280
even even like yeah the tells right the
 

5137
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:51,030
even even like yeah the tells right the
the eye contact like you you've probably

5138
01:26:51,030 --> 01:26:51,040
the eye contact like you you've probably
 

5139
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:53,030
the eye contact like you you've probably
already formed a bass line that i i have

5140
01:26:53,030 --> 01:26:53,040
already formed a bass line that i i have
 

5141
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:55,270
already formed a bass line that i i have
trouble making eye contact and so like

5142
01:26:55,270 --> 01:26:55,280
trouble making eye contact and so like
 

5143
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:56,870
trouble making eye contact and so like
so if you ask me difficult questions and

5144
01:26:56,870 --> 01:26:56,880
so if you ask me difficult questions and
 

5145
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:58,629
so if you ask me difficult questions and
i'm not making eye contact maybe that's

5146
01:26:58,629 --> 01:26:58,639
i'm not making eye contact maybe that's
 

5147
01:26:58,639 --> 01:27:00,550
i'm not making eye contact maybe that's
not a good signal of me lying or

5148
01:27:00,550 --> 01:27:00,560
not a good signal of me lying or
 

5149
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:02,629
not a good signal of me lying or
whatever correct because i always have

5150
01:27:02,629 --> 01:27:02,639
whatever correct because i always have
 

5151
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:04,470
whatever correct because i always have
trouble making eye contact stuff like

5152
01:27:04,470 --> 01:27:04,480
trouble making eye contact stuff like
 

5153
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:05,910
trouble making eye contact stuff like
that that's really fascinating the

5154
01:27:05,910 --> 01:27:05,920
that that's really fascinating the
 

5155
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,189
that that's really fascinating the
majority of your eye movement is to the

5156
01:27:07,189 --> 01:27:07,199
majority of your eye movement is to the
 

5157
01:27:07,199 --> 01:27:09,910
majority of your eye movement is to the
right yeah my your right my left yes

5158
01:27:09,910 --> 01:27:09,920
right yeah my your right my left yes
 

5159
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:11,669
right yeah my your right my left yes
right which is usually someone who's if

5160
01:27:11,669 --> 01:27:11,679
right which is usually someone who's if
 

5161
01:27:11,679 --> 01:27:13,510
right which is usually someone who's if
you ask micro expressionists that's

5162
01:27:13,510 --> 01:27:13,520
you ask micro expressionists that's
 

5163
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:16,229
you ask micro expressionists that's
someone who's referencing fact yeah

5164
01:27:16,229 --> 01:27:16,239
someone who's referencing fact yeah
 

5165
01:27:16,239 --> 01:27:17,590
someone who's referencing fact yeah
that's not necessarily what's happening

5166
01:27:17,590 --> 01:27:17,600
that's not necessarily what's happening
 

5167
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:19,189
that's not necessarily what's happening
for you because you're pulling concepts

5168
01:27:19,189 --> 01:27:19,199
for you because you're pulling concepts
 

5169
01:27:19,199 --> 01:27:20,390
for you because you're pulling concepts
out of the air so it's also a place

5170
01:27:20,390 --> 01:27:20,400
out of the air so it's also a place
 

5171
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:21,669
out of the air so it's also a place
where you reference something other than

5172
01:27:21,669 --> 01:27:21,679
where you reference something other than
 

5173
01:27:21,679 --> 01:27:22,870
where you reference something other than
fact it's a place for you to find

5174
01:27:22,870 --> 01:27:22,880
fact it's a place for you to find
 

5175
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:24,550
fact it's a place for you to find
creativity yeah so if i just thought

5176
01:27:24,550 --> 01:27:24,560
creativity yeah so if i just thought
 

5177
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:25,830
creativity yeah so if i just thought
that you were lying because you look up

5178
01:27:25,830 --> 01:27:25,840
that you were lying because you look up
 

5179
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:27,030
that you were lying because you look up
into the right

5180
01:27:27,030 --> 01:27:27,040
into the right
 

5181
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:29,110
into the right
i would be wrong that's so fascinating

5182
01:27:29,110 --> 01:27:29,120
i would be wrong that's so fascinating
 

5183
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:30,790
i would be wrong that's so fascinating
and a lot of that has to do with like

5184
01:27:30,790 --> 01:27:30,800
and a lot of that has to do with like
 

5185
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,390
and a lot of that has to do with like
habits that are formed and all those

5186
01:27:32,390 --> 01:27:32,400
habits that are formed and all those
 

5187
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:34,629
habits that are formed and all those
kinds of things or maybe some right hand

5188
01:27:34,629 --> 01:27:34,639
kinds of things or maybe some right hand
 

5189
01:27:34,639 --> 01:27:36,149
kinds of things or maybe some right hand
left hand type of situation right eye

5190
01:27:36,149 --> 01:27:36,159
left hand type of situation right eye
 

5191
01:27:36,159 --> 01:27:37,510
left hand type of situation right eye
dominance yeah right that's going to

5192
01:27:37,510 --> 01:27:37,520
dominance yeah right that's going to

is a guy i met during those interview
processes and i was like oh we met i saw

5848
01:38:14,229 --> 01:38:14,239
processes and i was like oh we met i saw

wearing
i was immediately connected and you like

01:38:18,709 --> 01:38:18,719
i was immediately connected and you like
 

5855
01:38:18,719 --> 01:38:21,510
i was immediately connected and you like
the people there close more like we

the people there close more like we
 

5857
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:22,629
the people there close more like we
immediately judge each other because

01:38:22,629 --> 01:38:22,639
immediately judge each other because
 

5859
01:38:22,639 --> 01:38:24,790
immediately judge each other because
we're all untrained right so he looked

5860
01:38:24,790 --> 01:38:24,800
we're all untrained right so he looked
 

5861
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:26,070
we're all untrained right so he looked

it'd be a good idea to go to ci
 

5873
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:36,550
it'd be a good idea to go to ci
interview in like a clubbing shirt with

5874
01:38:36,550 --> 01:38:36,560
interview in like a clubbing shirt with
 

5875
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:39,030
interview in like a clubbing shirt with
my buttons on button down to here yeah

5876
01:38:39,030 --> 01:38:39,040
my buttons on button down to here yeah
 

5877

after we got in he was like yeah dude
 

5881
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:43,590
after we got in he was like yeah dude
you were always really cool to talk to

5882
01:38:43,590 --> 01:38:43,600
you were always really cool to talk to
 

5883
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:44,709
you were always really cool to talk to
but i was like

5884
01:38:44,709 --> 01:38:44,719
but i was like
 

5885
01:38:44,719 --> 01:38:46,550
but i was like
there's no way that idiot's getting in

5886
01:38:46,550 --> 01:38:46,560
there's no way that idiot's getting in
 

5887
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:47,830
there's no way that idiot's getting in
and i remember looking at him being like

5888
01:38:47,830 --> 01:38:47,840
and i remember looking at him being like
 

5889
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:49,030
and i remember looking at him being like
dude you were just another white guy in

5890
01:38:49,030 --> 01:38:49,040
dude you were just another white guy in
 

5891
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:50,629
dude you were just another white guy in
a black suit yeah they're not looking

5892
01:38:50,629 --> 01:38:50,639
a black suit yeah they're not looking
 

5893
01:38:50,639 --> 01:38:52,709
a black suit yeah they're not looking
for you but here you are yeah so it's

5894
01:38:52,709 --> 01:38:52,719
for you but here you are yeah so it's
 

5895
01:38:52,719 --> 01:38:53,910
for you but here you are yeah so it's
just those kinds of things were so

5896
01:38:53,910 --> 01:38:53,920
just those kinds of things were so
 

5897
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:55,030
just those kinds of things were so
interesting because we were totally

5898
01:38:55,030 --> 01:38:55,040
interesting because we were totally
 

5899
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:56,709
interesting because we were totally
wrong about what cia was looking for

5900
01:38:56,709 --> 01:38:56,719
wrong about what cia was looking for
 

5901
01:38:56,719 --> 01:38:58,229
wrong about what cia was looking for
until you're in you have no idea what

5902
01:38:58,229 --> 01:38:58,239
until you're in you have no idea what
 

5903
01:38:58,239 --> 01:39:00,229
until you're in you have no idea what
they're looking for um and you're just

5904
01:39:00,229 --> 01:39:00,239
they're looking for um and you're just
 

5905
01:39:00,239 --> 01:39:02,629
they're looking for um and you're just
uh you're just shooting in the dark did

5906
01:39:02,629 --> 01:39:02,639
uh you're just shooting in the dark did
 

5907
01:39:02,639 --> 01:39:05,350
uh you're just shooting in the dark did
they have you do like a lie detector

5908
01:39:05,350 --> 01:39:05,360
they have you do like a lie detector
 

5909
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:07,270
they have you do like a lie detector
test yes it's called a polygraph

5910
01:39:07,270 --> 01:39:07,280
test yes it's called a polygraph
 

5911
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:08,470
test yes it's called a polygraph
polygraph

5912
01:39:08,470 --> 01:39:08,480
polygraph
 

5913
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:10,390
polygraph
how effective just interesting for our

5914
01:39:10,390 --> 01:39:10,400
how effective just interesting for our
 

5915
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:12,070
how effective just interesting for our
previous discussion how effective are

5916
01:39:12,070 --> 01:39:12,080
previous discussion how effective are
 

5917
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:13,910
previous discussion how effective are
those polygraphs are really interesting

5918
01:39:13,910 --> 01:39:13,920
those polygraphs are really interesting
 

5919
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:15,910
those polygraphs are really interesting
so one of the things that people don't

5920
01:39:15,910 --> 01:39:15,920
so one of the things that people don't
 

5921
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:17,270
so one of the things that people don't
understand about polygraphs is that

5922
01:39:17,270 --> 01:39:17,280
understand about polygraphs is that
 

5923
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:19,270
understand about polygraphs is that
polygraphs aren't meant to detect a lie

5924
01:39:19,270 --> 01:39:19,280
polygraphs aren't meant to detect a lie
 

5925
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:21,189
polygraphs aren't meant to detect a lie
like they're called a lie detector yeah

5926
01:39:21,189 --> 01:39:21,199
like they're called a lie detector yeah
 

5927
01:39:21,199 --> 01:39:22,790
like they're called a lie detector yeah
but they're not actually meant to detect

5928
01:39:22,790 --> 01:39:22,800
but they're not actually meant to detect
 

5929
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:23,750
but they're not actually meant to detect
a lie

5930
01:39:23,750 --> 01:39:23,760
a lie
 

5931
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:27,109
a lie
they're built to detect variants

5932
01:39:27,109 --> 01:39:27,119
they're built to detect variants
 

5933
01:39:27,119 --> 01:39:29,669
they're built to detect variants
from your physiological baseline so

5934
01:39:29,669 --> 01:39:29,679
from your physiological baseline so
 

5935
01:39:29,679 --> 01:39:32,390
from your physiological baseline so
they're essentially meant to identify

5936
01:39:32,390 --> 01:39:32,400
they're essentially meant to identify
 

5937
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:33,990
they're essentially meant to identify
sensitivities to certain types of

5938
01:39:33,990 --> 01:39:34,000
sensitivities to certain types of
 

5939
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,030
sensitivities to certain types of
questions

5940
01:39:35,030 --> 01:39:35,040
questions
 

5941
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:36,629
questions
and then as they identify a sensitivity

5942
01:39:36,629 --> 01:39:36,639
and then as they identify a sensitivity
 

5943
01:39:36,639 --> 01:39:38,790
and then as they identify a sensitivity
to a question it gives the interviewer

5944
01:39:38,790 --> 01:39:38,800
to a question it gives the interviewer
 

5945
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:40,470
to a question it gives the interviewer
an additional piece of information

5946
01:39:40,470 --> 01:39:40,480
an additional piece of information
 

5947
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:42,870
an additional piece of information
to direct the next round of questions

5948
01:39:42,870 --> 01:39:42,880
to direct the next round of questions
 

5949
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:44,310
to direct the next round of questions
so then from there they can kind of see

5950
01:39:44,310 --> 01:39:44,320
so then from there they can kind of see
 

5951
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:45,990
so then from there they can kind of see
how sensitive you are to a certain level

5952
01:39:45,990 --> 01:39:46,000
how sensitive you are to a certain level
 

5953
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,910
how sensitive you are to a certain level
of questions and your sensitivity could

5954
01:39:47,910 --> 01:39:47,920
of questions and your sensitivity could
 

5955
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:50,950
of questions and your sensitivity could
be a sign of dishonesty but it could

5956
01:39:50,950 --> 01:39:50,960
be a sign of dishonesty but it could
 

5957
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:52,709
be a sign of dishonesty but it could
also be a sign of

5958
01:39:52,709 --> 01:39:52,719
also be a sign of
 

5959
01:39:52,719 --> 01:39:54,390
also be a sign of
vulnerability

5960
01:39:54,390 --> 01:39:54,400
vulnerability
 

5961
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:56,149
vulnerability
so the interrogator themselves the

5962
01:39:56,149 --> 01:39:56,159
so the interrogator themselves the
 

5963
01:39:56,159 --> 01:39:57,669
so the interrogator themselves the
interviewer themselves they're the ones

5964
01:39:57,669 --> 01:39:57,679
interviewer themselves they're the ones
 

5965
01:39:57,679 --> 01:39:58,950
interviewer themselves they're the ones
that have to make the

5966
01:39:58,950 --> 01:39:58,960
that have to make the
 

5967
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:00,390
that have to make the
the judgment call as to which one it is

5968
01:40:00,390 --> 01:40:00,400
the judgment call as to which one it is
 

5969
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:02,390
the judgment call as to which one it is
which is why you might see multiple in

5970
01:40:02,390 --> 01:40:02,400
which is why you might see multiple in
 

5971
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:04,070
which is why you might see multiple in
uh interviewers over the course of

5972
01:40:04,070 --> 01:40:04,080
uh interviewers over the course of
 

5973
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:05,750
uh interviewers over the course of
multiple polygraphs

5974
01:40:05,750 --> 01:40:05,760
multiple polygraphs
 

5975
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:07,270
multiple polygraphs
but that's really what they're all about

5976
01:40:07,270 --> 01:40:07,280
but that's really what they're all about
 

5977
01:40:07,280 --> 01:40:10,310
but that's really what they're all about
so i mean outside of they're extremely

5978
01:40:10,310 --> 01:40:10,320
so i mean outside of they're extremely
 

5979
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:11,990
so i mean outside of they're extremely
uncomfortable like

5980
01:40:11,990 --> 01:40:12,000
uncomfortable like
 

5981
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:13,430
uncomfortable like
they're mentally uncomfortable but then

5982
01:40:13,430 --> 01:40:13,440
they're mentally uncomfortable but then
 

5983
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:15,590
they're mentally uncomfortable but then
there's also you gotta you sit on a pad

5984
01:40:15,590 --> 01:40:15,600
there's also you gotta you sit on a pad
 

5985
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:16,790
there's also you gotta you sit on a pad
because the pad is supposed to be able

5986
01:40:16,790 --> 01:40:16,800
because the pad is supposed to be able
 

5987
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:18,310
because the pad is supposed to be able
to tell like your body movements but

5988
01:40:18,310 --> 01:40:18,320
to tell like your body movements but
 

5989
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:20,310
to tell like your body movements but
also like your sphincter

5990
01:40:20,310 --> 01:40:20,320
also like your sphincter
 

5991
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:22,310
also like your sphincter
uh contractions or whatever so you're

5992
01:40:22,310 --> 01:40:22,320
uh contractions or whatever so you're
 

5993
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:24,390
uh contractions or whatever so you're
sitting on this pad you're plugged in

5994
01:40:24,390 --> 01:40:24,400
sitting on this pad you're plugged in
 

5995
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:26,550
sitting on this pad you're plugged in
you're strapped in you're tied up and it

5996
01:40:26,550 --> 01:40:26,560
you're strapped in you're tied up and it
 

5997
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:27,910
you're strapped in you're tied up and it
takes so much time to get in there and

5998
01:40:27,910 --> 01:40:27,920
takes so much time to get in there and
 

5999
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:29,830
takes so much time to get in there and
then they start asking you questions

6000
01:40:29,830 --> 01:40:29,840
then they start asking you questions
 

6001
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:31,510
then they start asking you questions
baseline questions at first and then

6002
01:40:31,510 --> 01:40:31,520
baseline questions at first and then
 

6003
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:33,030
baseline questions at first and then
other questions from there

6004
01:40:33,030 --> 01:40:33,040
other questions from there
 

6005
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:34,229
other questions from there
and you're just answering the best you

6006
01:40:34,229 --> 01:40:34,239
and you're just answering the best you
 

6007
01:40:34,239 --> 01:40:35,030
and you're just answering the best you
can

6008
01:40:35,030 --> 01:40:35,040
can
 

6009
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:36,149
can
and you never know what they're seeing

6010
01:40:36,149 --> 01:40:36,159
and you never know what they're seeing
 

6011
01:40:36,159 --> 01:40:36,870
and you never know what they're seeing
and you don't know what they're doing

6012
01:40:36,870 --> 01:40:36,880
and you don't know what they're doing
 

6013
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:38,149
and you don't know what they're doing
and it's really hard not to get anxious

6014
01:40:38,149 --> 01:40:38,159
and it's really hard not to get anxious
 

6015
01:40:38,159 --> 01:40:39,430
and it's really hard not to get anxious
of that anyways

6016
01:40:39,430 --> 01:40:39,440
of that anyways
 

6017
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:41,590
of that anyways
and they the whole time monitoring the

6018
01:40:41,590 --> 01:40:41,600
and they the whole time monitoring the
 

6019
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:43,510
and they the whole time monitoring the
the readings yeah from like a big

6020
01:40:43,510 --> 01:40:43,520
the readings yeah from like a big
 

6021
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:45,030
the readings yeah from like a big
they've got multiple screens and they've

6022
01:40:45,030 --> 01:40:45,040
they've got multiple screens and they've
 

6023
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:46,870
they've got multiple screens and they've
got just it's all information

6024
01:40:46,870 --> 01:40:46,880
got just it's all information
 

6025
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:48,870
got just it's all information
superiority they have information

6026
01:40:48,870 --> 01:40:48,880
superiority they have information
 

6027
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:50,709
superiority they have information
superiority you're the idiot looking

6028
01:40:50,709 --> 01:40:50,719
superiority you're the idiot looking
 

6029
01:40:50,719 --> 01:40:52,470
superiority you're the idiot looking
away from them or looking sideways of

6030
01:40:52,470 --> 01:40:52,480
away from them or looking sideways of
 

6031
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:53,510
away from them or looking sideways of
them

6032
01:40:53,510 --> 01:40:53,520
them
 

6033
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:54,870
them
and trying not to move because you're

6034
01:40:54,870 --> 01:40:54,880
and trying not to move because you're
 

6035
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:57,109
and trying not to move because you're
afraid that if you like have gas or if

6036
01:40:57,109 --> 01:40:57,119
afraid that if you like have gas or if
 

6037
01:40:57,119 --> 01:40:58,470
afraid that if you like have gas or if
you move a little bit it's going to vary

6038
01:40:58,470 --> 01:40:58,480
you move a little bit it's going to vary
 

6039
01:40:58,480 --> 01:40:59,669
you move a little bit it's going to vary
you from your baseline yeah and the

6040
01:40:59,669 --> 01:40:59,679
you from your baseline yeah and the
 

6041
01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:00,790
you from your baseline yeah and the
whole time you're worried your heart's

6042
01:41:00,790 --> 01:41:00,800
whole time you're worried your heart's
 

6043
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:01,750
whole time you're worried your heart's
racing and your blood pressure is

6044
01:41:01,750 --> 01:41:01,760
racing and your blood pressure is
 

6045
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:03,030
racing and your blood pressure is
increasing which is a variance from

6046
01:41:03,030 --> 01:41:03,040
increasing which is a variance from
 

6047
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:05,350
increasing which is a variance from
baseline yeah so yeah that means it's

6048
01:41:05,350 --> 01:41:05,360
baseline yeah so yeah that means it's
 

6049
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:07,510
baseline yeah so yeah that means it's
it's an interesting art or your baseline

6050
01:41:07,510 --> 01:41:07,520
it's an interesting art or your baseline
 

6051
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:08,790
it's an interesting art or your baseline
correct maybe there's some people that

6052
01:41:08,790 --> 01:41:08,800
correct maybe there's some people that
 

6053
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:10,310
correct maybe there's some people that
are just chilling the whole time and

6054
01:41:10,310 --> 01:41:10,320
are just chilling the whole time and
 

6055
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:12,470
are just chilling the whole time and
that's their baseline right

6056
01:41:12,470 --> 01:41:12,480
that's their baseline right
 

6057
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:13,830
that's their baseline right
right but that's what they're doing

6058
01:41:13,830 --> 01:41:13,840
right but that's what they're doing
 

6059
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:15,109
right but that's what they're doing
they're establishing based i mean i

6060
01:41:15,109 --> 01:41:15,119
they're establishing based i mean i
 

6061
01:41:15,119 --> 01:41:18,149
they're establishing based i mean i
guess that means the polygraph is uh is

6062
01:41:18,149 --> 01:41:18,159
guess that means the polygraph is uh is
 

6063
01:41:18,159 --> 01:41:18,790
guess that means the polygraph is uh is
a

6064
01:41:18,790 --> 01:41:18,800
a
 

6065
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:21,189
a

6066
01:41:21,189 --> 01:41:21,199
is a skill that you develop absolutely
 

6067
01:41:21,199 --> 01:41:22,709
is a skill that you develop absolutely
to do it well so when people talk about

beating a lie detector it's not that

6070
01:41:24,709 --> 01:41:24,719
beating a lie detector it's not that
 

6071
01:41:24,719 --> 01:41:26,310
beating a lie detector it's not that
they're telling an effective lie that's

6072
01:41:26,310 --> 01:41:26,320
they're telling an effective lie that's
 

6073
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:28,790

if they see no sensitivity
 

6087
01:41:39,119 --> 01:41:41,030
if they see no sensitivity
that's a big sign for them that's a big

liar
if you show sensitivity to many things

6094
01:41:46,709 --> 01:41:46,719
if you show sensitivity to many things
 

6095
01:41:46,719 --> 01:41:47,910
if you show sensitivity to many things
then that's a sign that you're probably

6096
01:41:47,910 --> 01:41:47,920
then that's a sign that you're probably
 

6097
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:50,550
then that's a sign that you're probably
an anxious person and they can still

6098
01:41:50,550 --> 01:41:50,560
an anxious person and they can still
 

6099
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:52,070
an anxious person and they can still
reset their baseline because they can

6100
01:41:52,070 --> 01:41:52,080
reset their baseline because they can
 

6101
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:54,709
reset their baseline because they can
tell how your anxiety is increasing

6102
01:41:54,709 --> 01:41:54,719
tell how your anxiety is increasing
 

6103

polygrapher is a is immensely valuable

6108
01:42:01,830 --> 01:42:01,840
polygrapher is a is immensely valuable
 

6109
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:04,149
polygrapher is a is immensely valuable
but the uh yeah it's the misnomers the

6110
01:42:04,149 --> 01:42:04,159
but the uh yeah it's the misnomers the
 

6111
01:42:04,159 --> 01:42:07,030
but the uh yeah it's the misnomers the
misconceptions about polygraphs are vast

6112
01:42:07,030 --> 01:42:07,040
misconceptions about polygraphs are vast
 

6113
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:09,430
misconceptions about polygraphs are vast
you also mentioned personality tests

6114
01:42:09,430 --> 01:42:09,440
you also mentioned personality tests
 

6115
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:11,669
you also mentioned personality tests
that's really interesting so how how

6116
01:42:11,669 --> 01:42:11,679
that's really interesting so how how
 

6117
01:42:11,679 --> 01:42:14,310
that's really interesting so how how
effective personality tests one for the

6118
01:42:14,310 --> 01:42:14,320
effective personality tests one for the
 

6119
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:15,750
effective personality tests one for the
hiring process but also for

6120
01:42:15,750 --> 01:42:15,760
hiring process but also for
 

6121
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:18,070
hiring process but also for
understanding a human being so

6122
01:42:18,070 --> 01:42:18,080
understanding a human being so
 

6123
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:19,830
understanding a human being so
personality is extremely important for

6124
01:42:19,830 --> 01:42:19,840
personality is extremely important for
 

6125
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:20,950
personality is extremely important for
understanding human being and i would

6126
01:42:20,950 --> 01:42:20,960
understanding human being and i would
 

6127
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:22,310
understanding human being and i would
say that there's a thousand different

6128
01:42:22,310 --> 01:42:22,320
say that there's a thousand different

01:42:28,950 --> 01:42:28,960
significance is the mbti and the mbti is
 

6135
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:30,550

what all the leading spy agencies around

6136
01:42:30,550 --> 01:42:30,560
what all the leading spy agencies around
 

6137
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:32,229
what all the leading spy agencies around
the world use as well

6138
01:42:32,229 --> 01:42:32,239
the world use as well
 

6139
01:42:32,239 --> 01:42:33,910
the world use as well
well that's kind of interesting to hear

6140
01:42:33,910 --> 01:42:33,920
well that's kind of interesting to hear
 

6141
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:35,669
well that's kind of interesting to hear
oh yeah there's been criticisms of that

6142
01:42:35,669 --> 01:42:35,679
oh yeah there's been criticisms of that
 

6143
01:42:35,679 --> 01:42:37,350
oh yeah there's been criticisms of that
kind of test there have been criticisms

6144
01:42:37,350 --> 01:42:37,360
kind of test there have been criticisms
 

6145
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:39,270
kind of test there have been criticisms
for a long time yeah and you think

6146
01:42:39,270 --> 01:42:39,280
for a long time yeah and you think
 

6147
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:41,350
for a long time yeah and you think
there's value absolutely absolutely and

6148
01:42:41,350 --> 01:42:41,360
there's value absolutely absolutely and
 

6149
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:42,950
there's value absolutely absolutely and
here's there's a few reasons why right

6150
01:42:42,950 --> 01:42:42,960
here's there's a few reasons why right
 

6151
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:45,830
here's there's a few reasons why right
so first mbti makes the claim that your

6152
01:42:45,830 --> 01:42:45,840
so first mbti makes the claim that your
 

6153
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:48,070
so first mbti makes the claim that your
core personality doesn't change over

6154
01:42:48,070 --> 01:42:48,080
core personality doesn't change over
 

6155
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:50,390
core personality doesn't change over
time uh and that's how it's that's how

6156
01:42:50,390 --> 01:42:50,400
time uh and that's how it's that's how
 

6157
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:52,149
time uh and that's how it's that's how
it's calibrated and one of the big

6158
01:42:52,149 --> 01:42:52,159
it's calibrated and one of the big
 

6159
01:42:52,159 --> 01:42:53,350
it's calibrated and one of the big
arguments is that people say that your

6160
01:42:53,350 --> 01:42:53,360
arguments is that people say that your
 

6161
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:55,510
arguments is that people say that your
personality can change over time

6162
01:42:55,510 --> 01:42:55,520
personality can change over time
 

6163
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:57,990
personality can change over time
now what i in my experience the mbti is

6164
01:42:57,990 --> 01:42:58,000
now what i in my experience the mbti is
 

6165
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,070
now what i in my experience the mbti is
exactly correct you can your core

6166
01:43:00,070 --> 01:43:00,080
exactly correct you can your core
 

6167
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:01,830
exactly correct you can your core
personality does not change because your

6168
01:43:01,830 --> 01:43:01,840
personality does not change because your
 

6169
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:05,109
personality does not change because your
core personality is is defined as your

6170
01:43:05,109 --> 01:43:05,119
core personality is is defined as your
 

6171
01:43:05,119 --> 01:43:07,350
core personality is is defined as your
personality when all resources are

6172
01:43:07,350 --> 01:43:07,360
personality when all resources are
 

6173
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:08,709
personality when all resources are
removed

6174
01:43:08,709 --> 01:43:08,719
removed
 

6175
01:43:08,719 --> 01:43:11,830

01:45:41,189 --> 01:45:41,199
once you understand your own code and
 

6311
01:45:41,199 --> 01:45:43,189
once you understand your own code and
then you're you're taught how to assess

6312

then you're you're taught how to assess
 

6313
01:45:43,199 --> 01:45:44,709
then you're you're taught how to assess
the code of others

6314

the code of others
 

6315
01:45:44,719 --> 01:45:46,390

um
 

6353
01:46:19,679 --> 01:46:21,430
um
you can't do much better than those four

6354
01:46:21,430 --> 01:46:21,440
you can't do much better than those four
 

6355
01:46:21,440 --> 01:46:22,870
you can't do much better than those four
letters i don't believe you can do much

6356
01:46:22,870 --> 01:46:22,880
letters i don't believe you can do much
 

6357
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:24,709
letters i don't believe you can do much
better in my experience i have not seen

6358
01:46:24,709 --> 01:46:24,719
better in my experience i have not seen
 

6359
01:46:24,719 --> 01:46:29,030
better in my experience i have not seen
anything better yeah it is kind of

6360
01:46:29,030 --> 01:46:29,040
anything better yeah it is kind of
 

6361
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:30,950
anything better yeah it is kind of
it's uh difficult to realize that there

6362
01:46:30,950 --> 01:46:30,960
it's uh difficult to realize that there
 

6363
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:33,109
it's uh difficult to realize that there
is a core personality or the degree

6364
01:46:33,109 --> 01:46:33,119
is a core personality or the degree
 

6365
01:46:33,119 --> 01:46:35,510
is a core personality or the degree
that's true it seems to be true

6366
01:46:35,510 --> 01:46:35,520
that's true it seems to be true
 

6367
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:38,070
that's true it seems to be true
it's even more difficult to realize that

6368
01:46:38,070 --> 01:46:38,080
it's even more difficult to realize that
 

6369
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:40,709
it's even more difficult to realize that
there is a stable

6370
01:46:40,709 --> 01:46:40,719
there is a stable
 

6371
01:46:40,719 --> 01:46:43,350
there is a stable
at least the science says so a stable

6372
01:46:43,350 --> 01:46:43,360
at least the science says so a stable
 

6373
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:46,310
at least the science says so a stable
consistent intelligence

6374
01:46:46,310 --> 01:46:46,320
consistent intelligence
 

6375
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:47,830
consistent intelligence
unfortunately

6376
01:46:47,830 --> 01:46:47,840
unfortunately
 

6377
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:50,870
unfortunately
uh you know the g factor that they call

6378
01:46:50,870 --> 01:46:50,880
uh you know the g factor that they call
 

6379
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:53,109
uh you know the g factor that they call
that uh if you do a barrage of iq test

6380
01:46:53,109 --> 01:46:53,119
that uh if you do a barrage of iq test
 

6381
01:46:53,119 --> 01:46:55,109
that uh if you do a barrage of iq test
that's going to um

6382
01:46:55,109 --> 01:46:55,119
that's going to um
 

6383
01:46:55,119 --> 01:46:56,950
that's going to um
consistently represent that g-factor and

6384
01:46:56,950 --> 01:46:56,960
consistently represent that g-factor and
 

6385
01:46:56,960 --> 01:46:58,950
consistently represent that g-factor and
we're all born with that we can't fix it

6386
01:46:58,950 --> 01:46:58,960
we're all born with that we can't fix it
 

6387
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:01,750
we're all born with that we can't fix it
yeah that defines so much of who we are

6388
01:47:01,750 --> 01:47:01,760
yeah that defines so much of who we are
 

6389
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:04,629
yeah that defines so much of who we are
it's sad i don't see it as sad because

6390
01:47:04,629 --> 01:47:04,639
it's sad i don't see it as sad because
 

6391
01:47:04,639 --> 01:47:06,149
it's sad i don't see it as sad because
it's for me

6392
01:47:06,149 --> 01:47:06,159
it's for me
 

6393
01:47:06,159 --> 01:47:08,470
it's for me
the faster you learn it the faster you

6394
01:47:08,470 --> 01:47:08,480
the faster you learn it the faster you
 

6395
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:10,390
the faster you learn it the faster you
learn what your own

6396
01:47:10,390 --> 01:47:10,400
learn what your own
 

6397
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:11,430
learn what your own
sort of

6398
01:47:11,430 --> 01:47:11,440
sort of
 

6399
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:13,910
sort of
natural strengths and weaknesses are

6400
01:47:13,910 --> 01:47:13,920
natural strengths and weaknesses are
 

6401
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:16,310
natural strengths and weaknesses are
the faster you get to stop wasting time

6402
01:47:16,310 --> 01:47:16,320
the faster you get to stop wasting time
 

6403
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:17,270
the faster you get to stop wasting time
yeah

6404
01:47:17,270 --> 01:47:17,280
yeah
 

6405
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:18,390
yeah
on things that you're never going to be

6406
01:47:18,390 --> 01:47:18,400
on things that you're never going to be
 

6407
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:20,629
on things that you're never going to be
good at and you get to double down on

6408
01:47:20,629 --> 01:47:20,639
good at and you get to double down on
 

6409
01:47:20,639 --> 01:47:22,070
good at and you get to double down on
the things that you're already naturally

6410
01:47:22,070 --> 01:47:22,080
the things that you're already naturally
 

6411
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:24,229
the things that you're already naturally
skilled or interested in so there is a

6412
01:47:24,229 --> 01:47:24,239
skilled or interested in so there is a
 

6413
01:47:24,239 --> 01:47:25,669
skilled or interested in so there is a
there's always a silver lining to a

6414
01:47:25,669 --> 01:47:25,679
there's always a silver lining to a
 

6415
01:47:25,679 --> 01:47:28,070
there's always a silver lining to a
cloud but i know now that i will never

6416
01:47:28,070 --> 01:47:28,080
cloud but i know now that i will never
 

6417
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:29,510
cloud but i know now that i will never

i'll never be any of those things and
 

6425
01:47:35,679 --> 01:47:37,189
i'll never be any of those things and
when i was 18 that might have made me

6426
01:47:37,189 --> 01:47:37,199
when i was 18 that might have made me
 

6427
01:47:37,199 --> 01:47:39,750
when i was 18 that might have made me
sad but now at 42 i'm like well [\h__\h]

instead of always being bad you're not

6432
01:47:44,310 --> 01:47:44,320
instead of always being bad you're not
 

6433
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:46,629

because i'm not graceful
 

6437
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:50,390
because i'm not graceful
and you've you've you've learned this

6438
01:47:50,390 --> 01:47:50,400
and you've you've you've learned this
 

6439
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:52,390
and you've you've you've learned this
after years of experience yeah exactly

6440
01:47:52,390 --> 01:47:52,400
after years of experience yeah exactly
 

6441
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:54,070
after years of experience yeah exactly
well i don't know if there's an mbti

6442
01:47:54,070 --> 01:47:54,080
well i don't know if there's an mbti
 

6443
01:47:54,080 --> 01:47:56,629
well i don't know if there's an mbti
equivalent for the for grace of movement

6444
01:47:56,629 --> 01:47:56,639
equivalent for the for grace of movement
 

6445
01:47:56,639 --> 01:47:58,709
equivalent for the for grace of movement
i think it's called s sensor

6446
01:47:58,709 --> 01:47:58,719
i think it's called s sensor
 

6447
01:47:58,719 --> 01:48:01,590
i think it's called s sensor
oh yeah because a sensor is someone

6448
01:48:01,590 --> 01:48:01,600
oh yeah because a sensor is someone
 

6449
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:03,030
oh yeah because a sensor is someone
who's able to interact with the world

6450
01:48:03,030 --> 01:48:03,040
who's able to interact with the world
 

6451
01:48:03,040 --> 01:48:04,229
who's able to interact with the world
around them through their five senses

6452
01:48:04,229 --> 01:48:04,239
around them through their five senses
 

6453
01:48:04,239 --> 01:48:05,990
around them through their five senses
very effectively

6454
01:48:05,990 --> 01:48:06,000
very effectively
 

6455
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:07,990
very effectively
like if you talk to dancers dancers can

6456
01:48:07,990 --> 01:48:08,000
like if you talk to dancers dancers can
 

6457
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,229
like if you talk to dancers dancers can
actually feel the grace in all of their

6458
01:48:10,229 --> 01:48:10,239
actually feel the grace in all of their
 

6459
01:48:10,239 --> 01:48:12,149
actually feel the grace in all of their
muscles they know what position their

6460
01:48:12,149 --> 01:48:12,159
muscles they know what position their
 

6461
01:48:12,159 --> 01:48:13,350
muscles they know what position their
finger is in

6462
01:48:13,350 --> 01:48:13,360
finger is in
 

6463
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:14,629
finger is in
i don't have any idea i don't know what

6464
01:48:14,629 --> 01:48:14,639
i don't have any idea i don't know what
 

6465
01:48:14,639 --> 01:48:15,990
i don't have any idea i don't know what
position my feet are in right now i had

about
 

6547
01:49:34,719 --> 01:49:36,550
about
secrecy in general

6548
01:49:36,550 --> 01:49:36,560
secrecy in general
 

6549
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:40,070
secrecy in general
are these secrets or just other secrets

6550
01:49:40,070 --> 01:49:40,080
are these secrets or just other secrets
 

6551
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:43,109
are these secrets or just other secrets
ones that the public will never know

6552
01:49:43,109 --> 01:49:43,119
ones that the public will never know
 

6553
01:49:43,119 --> 01:49:47,189
ones that the public will never know
or will it come out in 10 20 50 years

6554
01:49:47,189 --> 01:49:47,199
or will it come out in 10 20 50 years
 

6555
01:49:47,199 --> 01:49:49,669
or will it come out in 10 20 50 years
i guess the the deeper question is what

6556
01:49:49,669 --> 01:49:49,679
i guess the the deeper question is what
 

6557
01:49:49,679 --> 01:49:53,430
i guess the the deeper question is what
is the value of secrecy yes transparency

6558
01:49:53,430 --> 01:49:53,440
is the value of secrecy yes transparency
 

6559
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:54,790
is the value of secrecy yes transparency
the uh

6560
01:49:54,790 --> 01:49:54,800
the uh
 

6561
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:57,270
the uh
the standard classification for all

6562
01:49:57,270 --> 01:49:57,280
the standard classification for all
 

6563
01:49:57,280 --> 01:49:59,830
the standard classification for all
human intelligence operations is is

6564
01:49:59,830 --> 01:49:59,840
human intelligence operations is is
 

6565
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:04,070
human intelligence operations is is
something called 225x2 25x2 so 50 years

6566
01:50:04,070 --> 01:50:04,080
something called 225x2 25x2 so 50 years
 

6567
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:06,390
something called 225x2 25x2 so 50 years
25 years times two years or times two

6568
01:50:06,390 --> 01:50:06,400
25 years times two years or times two
 

6569
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:07,589
25 years times two years or times two
rounds

6570
01:50:07,589 --> 01:50:07,599
rounds
 

6571
01:50:07,599 --> 01:50:08,629
rounds
so

6572
01:50:08,629 --> 01:50:08,639
so
 

6573
01:50:08,639 --> 01:50:11,270
so
in essence anything that i've seen

6574
01:50:11,270 --> 01:50:11,280
in essence anything that i've seen
 

6575
01:50:11,280 --> 01:50:13,910
in essence anything that i've seen
has the first chance of becoming

6576
01:50:13,910 --> 01:50:13,920
has the first chance of becoming
 

6577
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:16,709
has the first chance of becoming
public domain declassified after 50

6578
01:50:16,709 --> 01:50:16,719
public domain declassified after 50
 

6579
01:50:16,719 --> 01:50:19,189
public domain declassified after 50
years unless there's some congressional

6580
01:50:19,189 --> 01:50:19,199
years unless there's some congressional
 

6581
01:50:19,199 --> 01:50:20,550
years unless there's some congressional
requirement for it to be reviewed and

6582
01:50:20,550 --> 01:50:20,560
requirement for it to be reviewed and
 

6583
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:22,070
requirement for it to be reviewed and
assessed earlier

6584
01:50:22,070 --> 01:50:22,080
assessed earlier
 

6585
01:50:22,080 --> 01:50:24,070
assessed earlier
so by then you know i'll be 80 something

6586
01:50:24,070 --> 01:50:24,080
so by then you know i'll be 80 something
 

6587
01:50:24,080 --> 01:50:26,470
so by then you know i'll be 80 something
years old or or potentially dead which

6588
01:50:26,470 --> 01:50:26,480
years old or or potentially dead which
 

6589
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:27,189
years old or or potentially dead which
is

6590
01:50:27,189 --> 01:50:27,199
is
 

6591
01:50:27,199 --> 01:50:28,790
is
either way

6592
01:50:28,790 --> 01:50:28,800
either way
 

6593
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:31,109
either way
that's when it's it can come out uh

6594
01:50:31,109 --> 01:50:31,119
that's when it's it can come out uh
 

6595
01:50:31,119 --> 01:50:34,070
that's when it's it can come out uh
according to its typical classification

6596
01:50:34,070 --> 01:50:34,080
according to its typical classification
 

6597
01:50:34,080 --> 01:50:35,350
according to its typical classification
the

6598
01:50:35,350 --> 01:50:35,360
the
 

6599
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:37,589
the
the value of secrets i

6600
01:50:37,589 --> 01:50:37,599
the value of secrets i
 

6601
01:50:37,599 --> 01:50:38,950
the value of secrets i
i have seen

6602
01:50:38,950 --> 01:50:38,960
i have seen
 

6603
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:41,990
i have seen
is that secrets create

6604
01:50:41,990 --> 01:50:42,000
is that secrets create
 

6605
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,149
is that secrets create
space

6606
01:50:44,149 --> 01:50:44,159
space
 

6607
01:50:44,159 --> 01:50:46,790
space
secrets give opportunity

6608
01:50:46,790 --> 01:50:46,800
secrets give opportunity
 

6609
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:47,750
secrets give opportunity
for

for
security they give opportunity for

6612
01:50:49,910 --> 01:50:49,920
security they give opportunity for
 

6613
01:50:49,920 --> 01:50:52,629
security they give opportunity for
thinking they give space and space is an

6614
01:50:52,629 --> 01:50:52,639
thinking they give space and space is an
 

6615
01:50:52,639 --> 01:50:55,109
thinking they give space and space is an
incredibly advantageous thing to have if

6616
01:50:55,109 --> 01:50:55,119
incredibly advantageous thing to have if
 

6617
01:50:55,119 --> 01:50:56,310
incredibly advantageous thing to have if
you know something somebody else doesn't

6618
01:50:56,310 --> 01:50:56,320

benefit by sharing a secret
 

6741
01:52:57,040 --> 01:52:59,189
benefit by sharing a secret
but in the long term if people know they

similar
 

6763
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:24,070
similar
in that they have a limited shelf life

6764
01:53:24,070 --> 01:53:24,080
in that they have a limited shelf life
 

6765
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:26,709
in that they have a limited shelf life
if you treat them like food secrets and

6766
01:53:26,709 --> 01:53:26,719
if you treat them like food secrets and
 

6767
01:53:26,719 --> 01:53:29,109
if you treat them like food secrets and

lies have a very limited shelf life
so if you cash in on them

6770
01:53:31,669 --> 01:53:31,679
so if you cash in on them
 

6771
01:53:31,679 --> 01:53:33,910
so if you cash in on them
while they're still fresh

01:53:33,910 --> 01:53:33,920
while they're still fresh
 

6773

01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:35,030
the cyber world is a weird world because
it's uh it doesn't have the same you

6948
01:56:35,030 --> 01:56:35,040
it's uh it doesn't have the same you
 

6949
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:36,629
it's uh it doesn't have the same you
know i know

6950
01:56:36,629 --> 01:56:36,639
know i know
 

6951
01:56:36,639 --> 01:56:38,310
know i know
i know not to cross the street without

6952
01:56:38,310 --> 01:56:38,320
i know not to cross the street without
 

6953
01:56:38,320 --> 01:56:39,910
i know not to cross the street without
looking each way because there's a

6954
01:56:39,910 --> 01:56:39,920
looking each way because there's a
 

6955
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:42,550
looking each way because there's a
physical intuition about it i i'm not

6956
01:56:42,550 --> 01:56:42,560
physical intuition about it i i'm not
 

6957
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:43,669
physical intuition about it i i'm not
sure

6958
01:56:43,669 --> 01:56:43,679
sure
 

6959
01:56:43,679 --> 01:56:45,109
sure
you know i'm a computer science guy so i

6960
01:56:45,109 --> 01:56:45,119
you know i'm a computer science guy so i
 

6961
01:56:45,119 --> 01:56:47,830
you know i'm a computer science guy so i
have some intuition but it's

6962
01:56:47,830 --> 01:56:47,840
have some intuition but it's
 

6963
01:56:47,840 --> 01:56:50,550
have some intuition but it's
the cyber world you it's really hard to

6964
01:56:50,550 --> 01:56:50,560
the cyber world you it's really hard to
 

6965
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:52,229
the cyber world you it's really hard to
build up an intuition what is safe and

6966
01:56:52,229 --> 01:56:52,239
build up an intuition what is safe and
 

6967
01:56:52,239 --> 01:56:55,270
build up an intuition what is safe and
not you know i've seen a lot of people

6968
01:56:55,270 --> 01:56:55,280
not you know i've seen a lot of people
 

6969
01:56:55,280 --> 01:56:56,790
not you know i've seen a lot of people
you know just logging out of your

6970
01:56:56,790 --> 01:56:56,800
you know just logging out of your
 

6971
01:56:56,800 --> 01:56:59,750
you know just logging out of your
devices all the time like regularly just

6972
01:56:59,750 --> 01:56:59,760
devices all the time like regularly just
 

6973
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:02,149
devices all the time like regularly just
like that physical access step is a lot

6974
01:57:02,149 --> 01:57:02,159
like that physical access step is a lot
 

6975
01:57:02,159 --> 01:57:03,910
like that physical access step is a lot
of people don't take i can just like

6976
01:57:03,910 --> 01:57:03,920
of people don't take i can just like
 

6977
01:57:03,920 --> 01:57:06,870
of people don't take i can just like
walk in into the offices of a lot of

6978
01:57:06,870 --> 01:57:06,880
walk in into the offices of a lot of
 

6979
01:57:06,880 --> 01:57:08,709
walk in into the offices of a lot of
ceos and it's like why don't

6980
01:57:08,709 --> 01:57:08,719
ceos and it's like why don't
 

6981
01:57:08,719 --> 01:57:11,270
ceos and it's like why don't
everything's wide open uh for it's for

6982
01:57:11,270 --> 01:57:11,280
everything's wide open uh for it's for
 

6983
01:57:11,280 --> 01:57:13,589
everything's wide open uh for it's for
physical access of those systems which

6984
01:57:13,589 --> 01:57:13,599
physical access of those systems which
 

6985
01:57:13,599 --> 01:57:16,470
physical access of those systems which
is kind of incredible for uh somebody

6986
01:57:16,470 --> 01:57:16,480
is kind of incredible for uh somebody
 

6987
01:57:16,480 --> 01:57:18,310
is kind of incredible for uh somebody
that sounds really shady but it's not

6988
01:57:18,310 --> 01:57:18,320
that sounds really shady but it's not
 

6989
01:57:18,320 --> 01:57:20,629
that sounds really shady but it's not
i've written key loggers like things

6990
01:57:20,629 --> 01:57:20,639
i've written key loggers like things
 

6991
01:57:20,639 --> 01:57:21,990
i've written key loggers like things
that record everything you type in the

6992
01:57:21,990 --> 01:57:22,000
that record everything you type in the
 

6993
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:23,350
that record everything you type in the
mouse you move

6994
01:57:23,350 --> 01:57:23,360
mouse you move
 

6995
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:25,750
mouse you move
and like i i did that for

6996
01:57:25,750 --> 01:57:25,760
and like i i did that for
 

6997
01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:26,790
and like i i did that for
um

6998
01:57:26,790 --> 01:57:26,800
um
 

6999
01:57:26,800 --> 01:57:28,310
um
during my phd i was recording everything

7000
01:57:28,310 --> 01:57:28,320
during my phd i was recording everything
 

7001
01:57:28,320 --> 01:57:30,870
during my phd i was recording everything
you do on your device and everything you

7002
01:57:30,870 --> 01:57:30,880
you do on your device and everything you
 

7003
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:32,870
you do on your device and everything you
do on your computer to unders like

7004
01:57:32,870 --> 01:57:32,880
do on your computer to unders like
 

7005
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:34,629
do on your computer to unders like
people sign up to the study they

7006
01:57:34,629 --> 01:57:34,639
people sign up to the study they
 

7007
01:57:34,639 --> 01:57:37,030
people sign up to the study they
willingly do this to understand behavior

7008
01:57:37,030 --> 01:57:37,040
willingly do this to understand behavior
 

7009
01:57:37,040 --> 01:57:38,470
willingly do this to understand behavior
i was trying to use machine learning to

7010
01:57:38,470 --> 01:57:38,480
i was trying to use machine learning to
 

7011
01:57:38,480 --> 01:57:40,950
i was trying to use machine learning to
identify who you are based on different

7012
01:57:40,950 --> 01:57:40,960
identify who you are based on different
 

7013
01:57:40,960 --> 01:57:42,070
identify who you are based on different
biometric

7014
01:57:42,070 --> 01:57:42,080
biometric
 

7015
01:57:42,080 --> 01:57:44,070
biometric
and behavioral things

7016
01:57:44,070 --> 01:57:44,080
and behavioral things
 

7017
01:57:44,080 --> 01:57:45,910
and behavioral things
which allows me to study human behavior

7018
01:57:45,910 --> 01:57:45,920
which allows me to study human behavior
 

7019
01:57:45,920 --> 01:57:47,750
which allows me to study human behavior
and to see which is

7020
01:57:47,750 --> 01:57:47,760
and to see which is
 

7021
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:50,149
and to see which is
uniquely identifiable and the goal there

7022
01:57:50,149 --> 01:57:50,159
uniquely identifiable and the goal there
 

7023
01:57:50,159 --> 01:57:53,109
uniquely identifiable and the goal there
was to remove the need for a password

7024
01:57:53,109 --> 01:57:53,119
was to remove the need for a password
 

7025
01:57:53,119 --> 01:57:55,910
was to remove the need for a password
but the how easy it is to write a thing

7026
01:57:55,910 --> 01:57:55,920
but the how easy it is to write a thing
 

7027
01:57:55,920 --> 01:57:58,070
but the how easy it is to write a thing
that logs everything you type

7028
01:57:58,070 --> 01:57:58,080
that logs everything you type
 

7029
01:57:58,080 --> 01:58:00,310
that logs everything you type
i was like wait a minute like i can

7030
01:58:00,310 --> 01:58:00,320
i was like wait a minute like i can
 

7031
01:58:00,320 --> 01:58:02,550
i was like wait a minute like i can
probably get a lot of people in the

7032
01:58:02,550 --> 01:58:02,560
probably get a lot of people in the
 

7033
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:05,030
probably get a lot of people in the
world to run this for me i can then get

7034
01:58:05,030 --> 01:58:05,040
world to run this for me i can then get
 

7035
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:07,189
world to run this for me i can then get
all of their passwords

7036
01:58:07,189 --> 01:58:07,199
all of their passwords
 

7037
01:58:07,199 --> 01:58:09,430
all of their passwords
uh i mean you could do

7038
01:58:09,430 --> 01:58:09,440
uh i mean you could do
 

7039
01:58:09,440 --> 01:58:10,629
uh i mean you could do
so much

7040
01:58:10,629 --> 01:58:10,639
so much
 

7041
01:58:10,639 --> 01:58:13,030
so much
like i can run the entirety of the cia

7042
01:58:13,030 --> 01:58:13,040
like i can run the entirety of the cia
 

7043
01:58:13,040 --> 01:58:14,950
like i can run the entirety of the cia
from

7044
01:58:14,950 --> 01:58:14,960
from
 

7045
01:58:14,960 --> 01:58:16,950
from
just myself if i was and i imagine

7046
01:58:16,950 --> 01:58:16,960
just myself if i was and i imagine
 

7047
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:18,310
just myself if i was and i imagine
there's a lot of really good hackers

7048
01:58:18,310 --> 01:58:18,320
there's a lot of really good hackers
 

7049
01:58:18,320 --> 01:58:21,510
there's a lot of really good hackers
like that out there much better than me

7050
01:58:21,510 --> 01:58:21,520
like that out there much better than me
 

7051
01:58:21,520 --> 01:58:22,310
like that out there much better than me
um

7052
01:58:22,310 --> 01:58:22,320
um
 

7053
01:58:22,320 --> 01:58:25,750
um
so i tried to prevent myself from being

7054
01:58:25,750 --> 01:58:25,760
so i tried to prevent myself from being
 

7055
01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:27,430
so i tried to prevent myself from being
all the different low-hanging fruit

7056
01:58:27,430 --> 01:58:27,440
all the different low-hanging fruit
 

7057
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:29,270
all the different low-hanging fruit
attack vectors in my life

7058
01:58:29,270 --> 01:58:29,280
attack vectors in my life
 

7059
01:58:29,280 --> 01:58:32,310
attack vectors in my life
i try to make it difficult

7060
01:58:32,310 --> 01:58:32,320
i try to make it difficult
 

7061
01:58:32,320 --> 01:58:34,629
i try to make it difficult
to be that but then i'm also aware that

7062
01:58:34,629 --> 01:58:34,639
to be that but then i'm also aware that
 

7063
01:58:34,639 --> 01:58:35,990
to be that but then i'm also aware that
there's probably people that are like

01:58:35,990 --> 01:58:36,000
there's probably people that are like
 

7065
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,709
there's probably people that are like
five steps ahead

7066
01:58:38,709 --> 01:58:38,719
five steps ahead

the nigeria email about how you could be
getting five million dollars if you just

getting five million dollars if you just
 

7093
01:58:59,280 --> 01:59:01,270
getting five million dollars if you just
give me your bank account exactly that's

01:59:01,270 --> 01:59:01,280
give me your bank account exactly that's

what they're looking for
 

7097
01:59:03,599 --> 01:59:05,030
what they're looking for
the thing that's scary is that if you're

7098
01:59:05,030 --> 01:59:05,040
the thing that's scary is that if you're
 

7099
01:59:05,040 --> 01:59:06,629
the thing that's scary is that if you're
not a target of opportunity if you

01:59:06,629 --> 01:59:06,639
not a target of opportunity if you
 

7101
01:59:06,639 --> 01:59:09,910
not a target of opportunity if you
become a intentional target

7102
01:59:09,910 --> 01:59:09,920
become a intentional target
 

7103
01:59:09,920 --> 01:59:11,750
become a intentional target
then there's almost nothing you can do

7104
01:59:11,750 --> 01:59:11,760
then there's almost nothing you can do
 

7105
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:13,430
then there's almost nothing you can do

then your security apparatus

01:59:17,669 --> 01:59:17,679
then your security apparatus
 

7111
01:59:17,679 --> 01:59:20,470
then your security apparatus
they they will in they will create a

they they will in they will create a

01:59:25,669 --> 01:59:25,679
uh way vector of attacking your specific
 

7117
01:59:25,679 --> 01:59:28,070
uh way vector of attacking your specific
security apparatus and

7118
01:59:28,070 --> 01:59:28,080
security apparatus and
 

7119
01:59:28,080 --> 01:59:30,229
security apparatus and
because security is always after right

7120
01:59:30,229 --> 01:59:30,239
because security is always after right
 

7121
01:59:30,239 --> 01:59:31,910
because security is always after right
there's always there's the there's the

7122
01:59:31,910 --> 01:59:31,920
there's always there's the there's the
 

7123
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:33,350
there's always there's the there's the
leading advantage and the trailing

7124
01:59:33,350 --> 01:59:33,360
leading advantage and the trailing
 

7125
01:59:33,360 --> 01:59:34,790
leading advantage and the trailing
advantage

7126
01:59:34,790 --> 01:59:34,800
advantage
 

7127
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:37,109
advantage
when it comes to attacks the leader

7128
01:59:37,109 --> 01:59:37,119
when it comes to attacks the leader
 

7129
01:59:37,119 --> 01:59:38,629
when it comes to attacks the leader
always has the advantage because they

7130
01:59:38,629 --> 01:59:38,639
always has the advantage because they
 

7131
01:59:38,639 --> 01:59:40,629
always has the advantage because they
have to create the attack before anybody

7132
01:59:40,629 --> 01:59:40,639
have to create the attack before anybody
 

7133
01:59:40,639 --> 01:59:41,750
have to create the attack before anybody
else can

7134
01:59:41,750 --> 01:59:41,760
else can
 

7135
01:59:41,760 --> 01:59:43,510
else can
create a way to protect against the

7136
01:59:43,510 --> 01:59:43,520
create a way to protect against the
 

7137
01:59:43,520 --> 01:59:45,430
create a way to protect against the
attack so the attack always comes first

7138
01:59:45,430 --> 01:59:45,440
attack so the attack always comes first
 

7139
01:59:45,440 --> 01:59:46,470
attack so the attack always comes first
and that means they always have the

7140
01:59:46,470 --> 01:59:46,480
and that means they always have the
 

7141
01:59:46,480 --> 01:59:48,229
and that means they always have the
advantage you are always stuck just

7142
01:59:48,229 --> 01:59:48,239
advantage you are always stuck just
 

7143
01:59:48,239 --> 01:59:49,510
advantage you are always stuck just
leaning on

7144
01:59:49,510 --> 01:59:49,520
leaning on
 

7145
01:59:49,520 --> 01:59:52,229
leaning on
this is the best security that i know of

7146
01:59:52,229 --> 01:59:52,239
this is the best security that i know of
 

7147
01:59:52,239 --> 01:59:53,910
this is the best security that i know of
meanwhile there's always somebody who

7148
01:59:53,910 --> 01:59:53,920
meanwhile there's always somebody who
 

7149
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:55,430
meanwhile there's always somebody who
can create a way of attacking the best

7150
01:59:55,430 --> 01:59:55,440
can create a way of attacking the best
 

7151
01:59:55,440 --> 01:59:57,830
can create a way of attacking the best
security out there and once they win

7152
01:59:57,830 --> 01:59:57,840
security out there and once they win
 

7153
01:59:57,840 --> 01:59:59,990
security out there and once they win
they have a monopoly they have

7154
01:59:59,990 --> 02:00:00,000
they have a monopoly they have
 

7155
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:01,990
they have a monopoly they have
all that time until a new defensive

7156
02:00:01,990 --> 02:00:02,000
all that time until a new defensive
 

7157
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:03,990
all that time until a new defensive
counter measure is deployed

7158
02:00:03,990 --> 02:00:04,000
counter measure is deployed
 

7159
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:05,750
counter measure is deployed
yeah i tend to think

7160
02:00:05,750 --> 02:00:05,760
yeah i tend to think
 

7161
02:00:05,760 --> 02:00:07,750
yeah i tend to think
exactly as you said that uh the

7162
02:00:07,750 --> 02:00:07,760
exactly as you said that uh the
 

7163
02:00:07,760 --> 02:00:09,430
exactly as you said that uh the
long-hanging fruit protects against like

7164
02:00:09,430 --> 02:00:09,440
long-hanging fruit protects against like
 

7165
02:00:09,440 --> 02:00:11,589
long-hanging fruit protects against like
uh yeah crimes of opportunity

7166
02:00:11,589 --> 02:00:11,599
uh yeah crimes of opportunity
 

7167
02:00:11,599 --> 02:00:13,830
uh yeah crimes of opportunity
and then i assume that people can just

7168
02:00:13,830 --> 02:00:13,840
and then i assume that people can just
 

7169
02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:15,109
and then i assume that people can just
hack in

7170
02:00:15,109 --> 02:00:15,119
hack in
 

7171
02:00:15,119 --> 02:00:17,270
hack in
if they really want uh think about how

7172
02:00:17,270 --> 02:00:17,280
if they really want uh think about how
 

7173
02:00:17,280 --> 02:00:18,870
if they really want uh think about how
much anxiety we would be able to solve

7174
02:00:18,870 --> 02:00:18,880
much anxiety we would be able to solve
 

7175
02:00:18,880 --> 02:00:21,350
much anxiety we would be able to solve
if everybody just accepted that

7176
02:00:21,350 --> 02:00:21,360
if everybody just accepted that
 

7177
02:00:21,360 --> 02:00:23,109
if everybody just accepted that
well there's several things you do first

7178
02:00:23,109 --> 02:00:23,119
well there's several things you do first
 

7179
02:00:23,119 --> 02:00:25,030
well there's several things you do first
of all i

7180
02:00:25,030 --> 02:00:25,040
of all i
 

7181
02:00:25,040 --> 02:00:27,030
of all i
to be honest it just makes me it keeps

7182
02:00:27,030 --> 02:00:27,040
to be honest it just makes me it keeps
 

7183
02:00:27,040 --> 02:00:28,629
to be honest it just makes me it keeps
me honest

02:00:32,310 --> 02:00:32,320
not to be a douchebag or like uh
 

7187
02:00:32,320 --> 02:00:34,149
not to be a douchebag or like uh
not

7188
02:00:34,149 --> 02:00:34,159
not
 

7189

not
yeah to to uh

7190
02:00:36,709 --> 02:00:36,719
yeah to to uh
 

7191
02:00:36,719 --> 02:00:39,750
yeah to to uh
to assume everything could be public

7192
02:00:39,750 --> 02:00:39,760
to assume everything could be public
 

7193
02:00:39,760 --> 02:00:42,790
to assume everything could be public
and you know and so don't trade in

7194
02:00:42,790 --> 02:00:42,800
and you know and so don't trade in
 

7195
02:00:42,800 --> 02:00:44,550
and you know and so don't trade in
information that could hurt people if it

7196
02:00:44,550 --> 02:00:44,560
information that could hurt people if it
 

7197
02:00:44,560 --> 02:00:45,910
information that could hurt people if it
was made public

7198
02:00:45,910 --> 02:00:45,920
was made public
 

7199
02:00:45,920 --> 02:00:47,750
was made public
so i tried to do that

7200
02:00:47,750 --> 02:00:47,760
so i tried to do that
 

7201
02:00:47,760 --> 02:00:51,350
so i tried to do that
and the thing i tried to make sure

7202
02:00:51,350 --> 02:00:51,360
and the thing i tried to make sure
 

7203
02:00:51,360 --> 02:00:54,310
and the thing i tried to make sure
is i like home alone style try

7204
02:00:54,310 --> 02:00:54,320
is i like home alone style try
 

7205
02:00:54,320 --> 02:00:57,589
is i like home alone style try
a booby trap i really would like to know

7206
02:00:57,589 --> 02:00:57,599
a booby trap i really would like to know
 

7207
02:00:57,599 --> 02:01:00,790
a booby trap i really would like to know
if i was hacked right and so i try to

7208
02:01:00,790 --> 02:01:00,800
if i was hacked right and so i try to
 

7209
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:03,270
if i was hacked right and so i try to
assume that i will be hacked

7210
02:01:03,270 --> 02:01:03,280
assume that i will be hacked
 

7211
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:04,310
assume that i will be hacked
and

7212
02:01:04,310 --> 02:01:04,320
and
 

7213
02:01:04,320 --> 02:01:06,870
and
detect it yeah uh have a tripwire of

7214
02:01:06,870 --> 02:01:06,880
detect it yeah uh have a tripwire of
 

7215
02:01:06,880 --> 02:01:08,870
detect it yeah uh have a tripwire of
something yeah tripwires through through

7216
02:01:08,870 --> 02:01:08,880
something yeah tripwires through through
 

7217
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:09,910
something yeah tripwires through through
everything

7218
02:01:09,910 --> 02:01:09,920
everything
 

7219
02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:12,709
everything
uh and not paranoia-wise just like uh

7220
02:01:12,709 --> 02:01:12,719
uh and not paranoia-wise just like uh
 

7221
02:01:12,719 --> 02:01:14,550
uh and not paranoia-wise just like uh
open door but that's that i think that's

7222
02:01:14,550 --> 02:01:14,560
open door but that's that i think that's
 

7223
02:01:14,560 --> 02:01:16,229
open door but that's that i think that's
probably the future

7224
02:01:16,229 --> 02:01:16,239
probably the future
 

7225
02:01:16,239 --> 02:01:17,990
probably the future
of life on this earth is you're going

7226
02:01:17,990 --> 02:01:18,000
of life on this earth is you're going
 

7227
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:19,750
of life on this earth is you're going
like everybody of interest is going to

7228
02:01:19,750 --> 02:01:19,760
like everybody of interest is going to
 

7229
02:01:19,760 --> 02:01:20,950
like everybody of interest is going to
be hacked

7230
02:01:20,950 --> 02:01:20,960
be hacked
 

7231
02:01:20,960 --> 02:01:23,189
be hacked
um that hopefully inspires now this is

7232
02:01:23,189 --> 02:01:23,199
um that hopefully inspires now this is
 

7233
02:01:23,199 --> 02:01:25,270
um that hopefully inspires now this is
outside of company there's uh these are

7234
02:01:25,270 --> 02:01:25,280
outside of company there's uh these are
 

7235
02:01:25,280 --> 02:01:27,750
outside of company there's uh these are
individuals i mean there's

7236
02:01:27,750 --> 02:01:27,760
individuals i mean there's
 

7237
02:01:27,760 --> 02:01:29,910
individuals i mean there's
of course if you're actually operating

7238
02:01:29,910 --> 02:01:29,920
of course if you're actually operating
 

7239
02:01:29,920 --> 02:01:31,830
of course if you're actually operating
like i'm just a who am i i'm just a

7240
02:01:31,830 --> 02:01:31,840
like i'm just a who am i i'm just a
 

7241
02:01:31,840 --> 02:01:33,990
like i'm just a who am i i'm just a
scientist person

7242
02:01:33,990 --> 02:01:34,000
scientist person
 

7243
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:34,950
scientist person
um

7244
02:01:34,950 --> 02:01:34,960
um
 

7245
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:37,350
um
podcasting person so

7246
02:01:37,350 --> 02:01:37,360
podcasting person so
 

7247
02:01:37,360 --> 02:01:41,109
podcasting person so
if i was actually running a company

7248
02:01:41,109 --> 02:01:41,119
if i was actually running a company
 

7249
02:01:41,119 --> 02:01:42,070
if i was actually running a company
or

7250
02:01:42,070 --> 02:01:42,080
or
 

7251
02:01:42,080 --> 02:01:45,030
or
was an integral part of some kind of

7252
02:01:45,030 --> 02:01:45,040
was an integral part of some kind of
 

7253
02:01:45,040 --> 02:01:46,709
was an integral part of some kind of
military operation

7254
02:01:46,709 --> 02:01:46,719
military operation
 

7255
02:01:46,719 --> 02:01:47,990
military operation
then you have to probably have to have

7256
02:01:47,990 --> 02:01:48,000
then you have to probably have to have
 

7257
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,870
then you have to probably have to have
an entire team that's now doing that

7258
02:01:50,870 --> 02:01:50,880
an entire team that's now doing that
 

7259
02:01:50,880 --> 02:01:51,830
an entire team that's now doing that
battle

7260
02:01:51,830 --> 02:01:51,840
battle
 

7261
02:01:51,840 --> 02:01:54,870
battle
of like being trying to be ahead of like

7262
02:01:54,870 --> 02:01:54,880
of like being trying to be ahead of like
 

7263
02:01:54,880 --> 02:01:56,470
of like being trying to be ahead of like
the best hackers in the world that are

7264
02:01:56,470 --> 02:01:56,480
the best hackers in the world that are
 

7265
02:01:56,480 --> 02:01:58,790
the best hackers in the world that are
attacking but that that requires a team

7266
02:01:58,790 --> 02:01:58,800
attacking but that that requires a team
 

7267
02:01:58,800 --> 02:02:01,589
attacking but that that requires a team
that like full time is their focus

7268
02:02:01,589 --> 02:02:01,599
that like full time is their focus
 

7269
02:02:01,599 --> 02:02:03,350
that like full time is their focus
yeah and then you still get in trouble

7270
02:02:03,350 --> 02:02:03,360
yeah and then you still get in trouble
 

7271
02:02:03,360 --> 02:02:06,070
yeah and then you still get in trouble
correct yeah so what i've seen as the

7272
02:02:06,070 --> 02:02:06,080
correct yeah so what i've seen as the
 

7273
02:02:06,080 --> 02:02:07,750
correct yeah so what i've seen as the
norm well what i've seen is the cutting

7274
02:02:07,750 --> 02:02:07,760
norm well what i've seen is the cutting
 

7275
02:02:07,760 --> 02:02:09,109
norm well what i've seen is the cutting
edge

7276
02:02:09,109 --> 02:02:09,119
edge
 

7277
02:02:09,119 --> 02:02:11,910
edge
standard for corporations and the ultra

7278
02:02:11,910 --> 02:02:11,920
standard for corporations and the ultra
 

7279
02:02:11,920 --> 02:02:15,109
standard for corporations and the ultra
the ultra wealthy and even uh

7280
02:02:15,109 --> 02:02:15,119
the ultra wealthy and even uh
 

7281
02:02:15,119 --> 02:02:16,870
the ultra wealthy and even uh
intelligence organizations

7282
02:02:16,870 --> 02:02:16,880
intelligence organizations
 

7283
02:02:16,880 --> 02:02:19,189
intelligence organizations
is that we have tripwires

7284
02:02:19,189 --> 02:02:19,199
is that we have tripwires
 

7285
02:02:19,199 --> 02:02:21,510
is that we have tripwires
it's better if you can't prevent from

7286
02:02:21,510 --> 02:02:21,520
it's better if you can't prevent from
 

7287
02:02:21,520 --> 02:02:22,709
it's better if you can't prevent from
being hacked

7288
02:02:22,709 --> 02:02:22,719
being hacked
 

7289
02:02:22,719 --> 02:02:24,790
being hacked
the next best thing is to know as soon

7290
02:02:24,790 --> 02:02:24,800
the next best thing is to know as soon
 

7291
02:02:24,800 --> 02:02:26,470
the next best thing is to know as soon
as you get hacked

7292
02:02:26,470 --> 02:02:26,480
as you get hacked
 

7293
02:02:26,480 --> 02:02:27,510
as you get hacked
because then

7294
02:02:27,510 --> 02:02:27,520
because then
 

7295
02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:29,030
because then
you can essentially terminate all the

7296
02:02:29,030 --> 02:02:29,040
you can essentially terminate all the
 

7297
02:02:29,040 --> 02:02:30,310
you can essentially terminate all the
information

7298
02:02:30,310 --> 02:02:30,320
information
 

7299
02:02:30,320 --> 02:02:31,750
information
if you know it fast enough you can just

7300
02:02:31,750 --> 02:02:31,760
if you know it fast enough you can just
 

7301
02:02:31,760 --> 02:02:33,189
if you know it fast enough you can just
destroy the information this is what the

7302
02:02:33,189 --> 02:02:33,199
destroy the information this is what the
 

7303
02:02:33,199 --> 02:02:35,189
destroy the information this is what the
ultra wealthy do they have multiple

7304
02:02:35,189 --> 02:02:35,199
ultra wealthy do they have multiple
 

7305
02:02:35,199 --> 02:02:37,030
ultra wealthy do they have multiple
phones so as soon as one phone gets

7306
02:02:37,030 --> 02:02:37,040
phones so as soon as one phone gets
 

7307
02:02:37,040 --> 02:02:38,870
phones so as soon as one phone gets
hacked the tripwire goes off the

7308
02:02:38,870 --> 02:02:38,880
hacked the tripwire goes off the
 

7309
02:02:38,880 --> 02:02:40,310
hacked the tripwire goes off the
operating system is totally deleted

7310
02:02:40,310 --> 02:02:40,320
operating system is totally deleted
 

7311
02:02:40,320 --> 02:02:42,950
operating system is totally deleted
along with all data on the phone and a

7312
02:02:42,950 --> 02:02:42,960
along with all data on the phone and a
 

7313
02:02:42,960 --> 02:02:44,950
along with all data on the phone and a
second phone is turned on with a whole

7314
02:02:44,950 --> 02:02:44,960
second phone is turned on with a whole
 

7315
02:02:44,960 --> 02:02:47,270
second phone is turned on with a whole
new separate set of metadata

7316
02:02:47,270 --> 02:02:47,280
new separate set of metadata
 

7317
02:02:47,280 --> 02:02:49,109
new separate set of metadata
and now they for them there's no break

7318
02:02:49,109 --> 02:02:49,119
and now they for them there's no break
 

7319
02:02:49,119 --> 02:02:51,270
and now they for them there's no break
in service it's just oh this phone went

7320
02:02:51,270 --> 02:02:51,280
in service it's just oh this phone went
 

7321
02:02:51,280 --> 02:02:53,189
in service it's just oh this phone went
black it's got a warning on it that says

7322
02:02:53,189 --> 02:02:53,199
black it's got a warning on it that says
 

7323
02:02:53,199 --> 02:02:55,030
black it's got a warning on it that says
it was hacked so trash it because they

7324
02:02:55,030 --> 02:02:55,040
it was hacked so trash it because they
 

7325
02:02:55,040 --> 02:02:56,229
it was hacked so trash it because they
don't care about the price of the phone

7326
02:02:56,229 --> 02:02:56,239
don't care about the price of the phone
 

7327
02:02:56,239 --> 02:02:58,550
don't care about the price of the phone
pick up the next phone and we move on

7328
02:02:58,550 --> 02:02:58,560
pick up the next phone and we move on
 

7329
02:02:58,560 --> 02:02:59,990
pick up the next phone and we move on
that's that's the best thing that you

7330
02:02:59,990 --> 02:03:00,000
that's that's the best thing that you
 

7331
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,070
that's that's the best thing that you
can do essentially outside of trying to

7332
02:03:02,070 --> 02:03:02,080
can do essentially outside of trying to
 

7333
02:03:02,080 --> 02:03:03,669
can do essentially outside of trying to
out hack the hackers

7334
02:03:03,669 --> 02:03:03,679
out hack the hackers
 

7335
02:03:03,679 --> 02:03:05,830
out hack the hackers
uh and then even in your intelligence

7336
02:03:05,830 --> 02:03:05,840
uh and then even in your intelligence
 

7337
02:03:05,840 --> 02:03:07,270
uh and then even in your intelligence
and military worlds where the cyber

7338
02:03:07,270 --> 02:03:07,280
and military worlds where the cyber
 

7339
02:03:07,280 --> 02:03:09,350
and military worlds where the cyber
where cyber warfare is active

7340
02:03:09,350 --> 02:03:09,360
where cyber warfare is active
 

7341
02:03:09,360 --> 02:03:11,589
where cyber warfare is active
the people who are aggressing

7342
02:03:11,589 --> 02:03:11,599
the people who are aggressing
 

7343
02:03:11,599 --> 02:03:15,189
the people who are aggressing
are not trying to create aggression that

7344
02:03:15,189 --> 02:03:15,199
are not trying to create aggression that
 

7345
02:03:15,199 --> 02:03:17,750
are not trying to create aggression that
beats security they're trying to find

7346
02:03:17,750 --> 02:03:17,760
beats security they're trying to find
 

7347
02:03:17,760 --> 02:03:19,669
beats security they're trying to find
aggressive techniques offensive

7348
02:03:19,669 --> 02:03:19,679
aggressive techniques offensive
 

7349
02:03:19,679 --> 02:03:21,910
aggressive techniques offensive
techniques that have no security built

7350
02:03:21,910 --> 02:03:21,920
techniques that have no security built
 

7351
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:24,790
techniques that have no security built
around them yet because it's too cost

7352
02:03:24,790 --> 02:03:24,800
around them yet because it's too cost
 

7353
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:27,189
around them yet because it's too cost
and time intensive to protect against

7354
02:03:27,189 --> 02:03:27,199
and time intensive to protect against
 

7355
02:03:27,199 --> 02:03:29,189
and time intensive to protect against
what you know is coming it's so much

7356
02:03:29,189 --> 02:03:29,199
what you know is coming it's so much
 

7357
02:03:29,199 --> 02:03:31,030
what you know is coming it's so much
more efficient and cost effective to go

7358
02:03:31,030 --> 02:03:31,040
more efficient and cost effective to go
 

7359
02:03:31,040 --> 02:03:32,629
more efficient and cost effective to go
after new vectors

7360
02:03:32,629 --> 02:03:32,639
after new vectors
 

7361
02:03:32,639 --> 02:03:35,910
after new vectors
so it just becomes like

7362
02:03:35,910 --> 02:03:35,920
so it just becomes like
 

7363
02:03:35,920 --> 02:03:38,390
so it just becomes like
it becomes almost a silly game of

7364
02:03:38,390 --> 02:03:38,400
it becomes almost a silly game of
 

7365
02:03:38,400 --> 02:03:41,030
it becomes almost a silly game of
of your neighbor gets a guard dog

7366
02:03:41,030 --> 02:03:41,040
of your neighbor gets a guard dog
 

7367
02:03:41,040 --> 02:03:42,870
of your neighbor gets a guard dog
so you get a bigger guard dog

7368
02:03:42,870 --> 02:03:42,880
so you get a bigger guard dog
 

7369
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:44,950
so you get a bigger guard dog
and then your neighbor gets a fence so

7370
02:03:44,950 --> 02:03:44,960
and then your neighbor gets a fence so
 

7371
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:46,070
and then your neighbor gets a fence so
you're just constantly outdoing each

7372
02:03:46,070 --> 02:03:46,080
you're just constantly outdoing each
 

7373
02:03:46,080 --> 02:03:47,589
you're just constantly outdoing each
other it's called the the security

7374
02:03:47,589 --> 02:03:47,599
other it's called the the security
 

7375
02:03:47,599 --> 02:03:50,149
other it's called the the security
paradigm people just they just one up

7376
02:03:50,149 --> 02:03:50,159
paradigm people just they just one up
 

7377
02:03:50,159 --> 02:03:51,350
paradigm people just they just one up
each other because it's never worth it

7378
02:03:51,350 --> 02:03:51,360
each other because it's never worth it
 

7379
02:03:51,360 --> 02:03:53,189
each other because it's never worth it
to just get to the same level you're

7380
02:03:53,189 --> 02:03:53,199
to just get to the same level you're
 

7381
02:03:53,199 --> 02:03:54,629
to just get to the same level you're
always trying to out to each other yeah

7382
02:03:54,629 --> 02:03:54,639
always trying to out to each other yeah
 

7383
02:03:54,639 --> 02:03:57,350
always trying to out to each other yeah
and then maybe like banks have to fight

7384
02:03:57,350 --> 02:03:57,360
and then maybe like banks have to fight
 

7385
02:03:57,360 --> 02:03:59,669
and then maybe like banks have to fight
that fight but not not everybody can

7386
02:03:59,669 --> 02:03:59,679
that fight but not not everybody can
 

7387
02:03:59,679 --> 02:04:00,470
that fight but not not everybody can
right

7388
02:04:00,470 --> 02:04:00,480
right
 

7389
02:04:00,480 --> 02:04:02,390
right
yeah no so you're saying i operated at

7390
02:04:02,390 --> 02:04:02,400
yeah no so you're saying i operated at
 

7391
02:04:02,400 --> 02:04:03,990
yeah no so you're saying i operated at
the state of the art with the trip wires

7392
02:04:03,990 --> 02:04:04,000
the state of the art with the trip wires
 

7393
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,550
the state of the art with the trip wires
this is good to know absolutely man and

7394
02:04:06,550 --> 02:04:06,560
this is good to know absolutely man and
 

7395
02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:08,310
this is good to know absolutely man and
also just not

7396
02:04:08,310 --> 02:04:08,320
also just not
 

7397
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:10,149
also just not
not using anybody else's services doing

7398
02:04:10,149 --> 02:04:10,159
not using anybody else's services doing
 

7399
02:04:10,159 --> 02:04:12,470
not using anybody else's services doing
this doing the everything myself

7400
02:04:12,470 --> 02:04:12,480
this doing the everything myself
 

7401
02:04:12,480 --> 02:04:13,990
this doing the everything myself
so that's harder to figure out what the

7402
02:04:13,990 --> 02:04:14,000
so that's harder to figure out what the
 

7403
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:15,430
so that's harder to figure out what the
heck this person is doing because if i'm

7404
02:04:15,430 --> 02:04:15,440
heck this person is doing because if i'm
 

7405
02:04:15,440 --> 02:04:18,310
heck this person is doing because if i'm
using somebody else's service like i did

7406
02:04:18,310 --> 02:04:18,320
using somebody else's service like i did
 

7407
02:04:18,320 --> 02:04:21,510
using somebody else's service like i did
with qnap

7408
02:04:21,510 --> 02:04:21,520

 

7409
02:04:21,520 --> 02:04:23,990

i have a queued up nasa used for cold

7410
02:04:23,990 --> 02:04:24,000
i have a queued up nasa used for cold
 

7411
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:25,589
i have a queued up nasa used for cold
storage of unimportant things but at

7412
02:04:25,589 --> 02:04:25,599
storage of unimportant things but at
 

7413
02:04:25,599 --> 02:04:26,550

02:04:26,560 --> 02:04:28,310
large
videos and i don't know if you know but

7416
02:04:28,310 --> 02:04:28,320
videos and i don't know if you know but
 

7417
02:04:28,320 --> 02:04:31,270
videos and i don't know if you know but
qnap is a company that does nas storage

7418
02:04:31,270 --> 02:04:31,280
qnap is a company that does nas storage
 

7419
02:04:31,280 --> 02:04:33,910
qnap is a company that does nas storage
devices and they got hacked

7420
02:04:33,910 --> 02:04:33,920
devices and they got hacked
 

7421
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:37,189
devices and they got hacked
and everybody that didn't update

7422
02:04:37,189 --> 02:04:37,199
and everybody that didn't update
 

7423
02:04:37,199 --> 02:04:39,910
and everybody that didn't update
as of a week ago from the point of the

7424
02:04:39,910 --> 02:04:39,920
as of a week ago from the point of the
 

7425
02:04:39,920 --> 02:04:41,430
as of a week ago from the point of the
zero day hack

7426
02:04:41,430 --> 02:04:41,440
zero day hack
 

7427
02:04:41,440 --> 02:04:43,270
zero day hack

it's still very new i mean they were
sourcing

7480
02:05:35,189 --> 02:05:35,199

take night vision goggles for example
 

7483
02:05:37,360 --> 02:05:39,270
take night vision goggles for example
they were sourcing components and

7484
02:05:39,270 --> 02:05:39,280
they were sourcing components and
 

7485
02:05:39,280 --> 02:05:40,950
they were sourcing components and
engineering and blueprints for night

7486
02:05:40,950 --> 02:05:40,960
engineering and blueprints for night
 

7487
02:05:40,960 --> 02:05:42,629

different subcontractors all over the
 

7491
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:46,950
different subcontractors all over the

country but they never asked themselves
 

7493
02:05:46,960 --> 02:05:48,390
country but they never asked themselves
what the security status was of those

7494
02:05:48,390 --> 02:05:48,400
what the security status was of those
 

7495
02:05:48,400 --> 02:05:50,550
what the security status was of those
self of those subcontractors

so
 

7499
02:05:52,079 --> 02:05:53,830
so
you know fast forward you know a few

7500
02:05:53,830 --> 02:05:53,840
you know fast forward you know a few
 

7501
02:05:53,840 --> 02:05:54,629
you know fast forward you know a few
years

7502
02:05:54,629 --> 02:05:54,639
years
 

7503
02:05:54,639 --> 02:05:56,149
years
and uh and all of a sudden they start

7504
02:05:56,149 --> 02:05:56,159
and uh and all of a sudden they start
 

7505
02:05:56,159 --> 02:05:58,069
and uh and all of a sudden they start
getting faulty components they start

7506
02:05:58,069 --> 02:05:58,079
getting faulty components they start
 

7507
02:05:58,079 --> 02:05:59,270
getting faulty components they start
having night vision goggles that don't

7508

having night vision goggles that don't
 

7509
02:05:59,280 --> 02:06:01,350
having night vision goggles that don't
work they start having supply chain

7510
02:06:01,350 --> 02:06:01,360
work they start having supply chain
 

7511
02:06:01,360 --> 02:06:03,030
work they start having supply chain
issues where they have to change their

7512
02:06:03,030 --> 02:06:03,040
issues where they have to change their
 

7513
02:06:03,040 --> 02:06:04,310
issues where they have to change their
their provider

7514
02:06:04,310 --> 02:06:04,320
their provider
 

7515
02:06:04,320 --> 02:06:05,990
their provider
and and the army doesn't know that the

7516
02:06:05,990 --> 02:06:06,000
and and the army doesn't know that the
 

7517
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:07,589
and and the army doesn't know that the
provider is changing

7518
02:06:07,589 --> 02:06:07,599
provider is changing
 

7519
02:06:07,599 --> 02:06:09,990
provider is changing
i mean this is a strategy the the idea

7520
02:06:09,990 --> 02:06:10,000
i mean this is a strategy the the idea
 

7521
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,629
i mean this is a strategy the the idea
of of going through third-party systems

7522
02:06:12,629 --> 02:06:12,639
of of going through third-party systems
 

7523
02:06:12,639 --> 02:06:14,229
of of going through third-party systems
is identifying the vulnerability in the

7524
02:06:14,229 --> 02:06:14,239
is identifying the vulnerability in the
 

7525
02:06:14,239 --> 02:06:17,189
is identifying the vulnerability in the
supply chain that's a that's a

7526
02:06:17,189 --> 02:06:17,199
supply chain that's a that's a
 

7527
02:06:17,199 --> 02:06:18,550
supply chain that's a that's a
a savvy

7528
02:06:18,550 --> 02:06:18,560
a savvy
 

7529

that you
 

7857
02:11:34,320 --> 02:11:35,669
that you
don't have to type in the password the

7858

don't have to type in the password the
 

7859
02:11:35,679 --> 02:11:38,229
don't have to type in the password the
idea was to replace the password but it

7860
02:11:38,229 --> 02:11:38,239
idea was to replace the password but it
 

7861
02:11:38,239 --> 02:11:39,830
idea was to replace the password but it
also allows you to actually study human

7862
02:11:39,830 --> 02:11:39,840
also allows you to actually study human
 

7863
02:11:39,840 --> 02:11:41,830
also allows you to actually study human
behavior and to think all right what is

7864
02:11:41,830 --> 02:11:41,840
behavior and to think all right what is
 

7865
02:11:41,840 --> 02:11:44,310
behavior and to think all right what is
the unique representation of a person

the unique representation of a person
 

7867
02:11:44,320 --> 02:11:45,350
the unique representation of a person
how

7868
02:11:45,350 --> 02:11:45,360
how
 

7869
02:11:45,360 --> 02:11:46,470
how
um

7870
02:11:46,470 --> 02:11:46,480
um
 

7871
02:11:46,480 --> 02:11:48,629
um
because we have very specific patterns

7872
02:11:48,629 --> 02:11:48,639
because we have very specific patterns
 

7873
02:11:48,639 --> 02:11:50,069
because we have very specific patterns
and a lot of humans are very similar in

7874
02:11:50,069 --> 02:11:50,079
and a lot of humans are very similar in
 

7875
02:11:50,079 --> 02:11:51,270
and a lot of humans are very similar in
those patterns

7876
02:11:51,270 --> 02:11:51,280
those patterns
 

7877
02:11:51,280 --> 02:11:53,030
those patterns
what are the unique identifiers within

7878
02:11:53,030 --> 02:11:53,040
what are the unique identifiers within
 

7879
02:11:53,040 --> 02:11:55,109
what are the unique identifiers within
those patterns of behavior

7880
02:11:55,109 --> 02:11:55,119
those patterns of behavior
 

7881
02:11:55,119 --> 02:11:56,390
those patterns of behavior
and that's i think that's from a

7882
02:11:56,390 --> 02:11:56,400
and that's i think that's from a
 

7883
02:11:56,400 --> 02:11:57,750
and that's i think that's from a
psychology perspective a super

7884
02:11:57,750 --> 02:11:57,760
psychology perspective a super
 

7885
02:11:57,760 --> 02:11:59,990
psychology perspective a super
fascinating question and from a machine

7886
02:11:59,990 --> 02:12:00,000
fascinating question and from a machine
 

7887
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:01,430
fascinating question and from a machine
learning perspective it's something that

7888
02:12:01,430 --> 02:12:01,440
learning perspective it's something that
 

7889
02:12:01,440 --> 02:12:03,430
learning perspective it's something that
you can as the systems get better and

7890
02:12:03,430 --> 02:12:03,440
you can as the systems get better and
 

7891
02:12:03,440 --> 02:12:05,430
you can as the systems get better and
better and better and as we get more and

7892
02:12:05,430 --> 02:12:05,440
better and better and as we get more and
 

7893
02:12:05,440 --> 02:12:08,149
better and better and as we get more and
more digital data about each individual

7894
02:12:08,149 --> 02:12:08,159
more digital data about each individual
 

7895
02:12:08,159 --> 02:12:09,430
more digital data about each individual
you start to get

7896
02:12:09,430 --> 02:12:09,440
you start to get
 

7897
02:12:09,440 --> 02:12:10,709
you start to get
you start to be able to do that kind of

7898
02:12:10,709 --> 02:12:10,719
you start to be able to do that kind of
 

7899
02:12:10,719 --> 02:12:12,310
you start to be able to do that kind of
thing effectively and it's i mean when i

7900
02:12:12,310 --> 02:12:12,320
thing effectively and it's i mean when i
 

7901

think of the fact that you could create

think of the fact that you could create
 

7903
02:12:13,760 --> 02:12:16,069

8019
02:14:02,639 --> 02:14:03,750
lists that they determined of course
they found out that the intelligence

8020
02:14:03,750 --> 02:14:03,760
they found out that the intelligence
 

8021
02:14:03,760 --> 02:14:05,350
they found out that the intelligence
community wasn't coordinating well with

good intel sharing
 

8029
02:14:10,239 --> 02:14:11,910
good intel sharing
but more than that they identified that

8030
02:14:11,910 --> 02:14:11,920
but more than that they identified that
 

8031
02:14:11,920 --> 02:14:14,310
but more than that they identified that
we were operating uh

8032
02:14:14,310 --> 02:14:14,320
we were operating uh
 

8033
02:14:14,320 --> 02:14:16,709
we were operating uh
at cold war levels even though we were

8034
02:14:16,709 --> 02:14:16,719
at cold war levels even though we were
 

8035
02:14:16,719 --> 02:14:19,430

and that's a very simple business
 

8267
02:18:14,960 --> 02:18:16,230
and that's a very simple business
principle

8268
02:18:16,230 --> 02:18:16,240
principle
 

8269
02:18:16,240 --> 02:18:17,990
principle
whereas in

8270
02:18:17,990 --> 02:18:18,000
whereas in
 

8271
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:19,030
whereas in
the current

8272
02:18:19,030 --> 02:18:19,040
the current
 

8273
02:18:19,040 --> 02:18:20,950
the current
national security infrastructure you can

8274
02:18:20,950 --> 02:18:20,960
national security infrastructure you can
 

8275
02:18:20,960 --> 02:18:22,709
national security infrastructure you can
create a crap product

8276
02:18:22,709 --> 02:18:22,719
create a crap product
 

8277
02:18:22,719 --> 02:18:24,309

so it's really thrown things for a loop

8282
02:18:27,990 --> 02:18:28,000
so it's really thrown things for a loop

02:32:49,760 --> 02:32:51,190
you take it to a court
well guess what no court is going to

9122
02:32:51,190 --> 02:32:51,200
well guess what no court is going to
 

9123
02:32:51,200 --> 02:32:52,630
well guess what no court is going to
support

9124
02:32:52,630 --> 02:32:52,640
support
 

9125
02:32:52,640 --> 02:32:54,870
support
anything that goes against

9126
02:32:54,870 --> 02:32:54,880

the freedom of speech
 

9129
02:32:56,800 --> 02:32:58,710
the freedom of speech
so the court is not going to support

9130
02:32:58,710 --> 02:32:58,720
so the court is not going to support
 

9131
02:32:58,720 --> 02:33:01,110
so the court is not going to support
what the executive is asking them to do

9144
02:33:13,429 --> 02:33:13,439
well guess what doesn't meet criteria
 

9145
02:33:13,439 --> 02:33:15,190
well guess what doesn't meet criteria
for any police force anywhere in the

9146
02:33:15,190 --> 02:33:15,200
for any police force anywhere in the

different case which means the standards
 

9163
02:33:30,080 --> 02:33:31,510
different case which means the standards
of evidence are much higher for them to

completely different here well so
 

9221
02:34:27,439 --> 02:34:30,150
completely different here well so
there's a lot to say so one is yes if i

9222
02:34:30,150 --> 02:34:30,160
there's a lot to say so one is yes if i
 

9223
02:34:30,160 --> 02:34:31,990
there's a lot to say so one is yes if i
was a dictator

9224
02:34:31,990 --> 02:34:32,000
was a dictator
 

9225
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,550
was a dictator
and i wanted to and just looking at

9226
02:34:34,550 --> 02:34:34,560
and i wanted to and just looking at
 

9227
02:34:34,560 --> 02:34:35,670
and i wanted to and just looking at
history

9228
02:34:35,670 --> 02:34:35,680
history
 

9229
02:34:35,680 --> 02:34:38,389
history
let me let me take myself out of it but

9230
02:34:38,389 --> 02:34:38,399
let me let me take myself out of it but
 

9231
02:34:38,399 --> 02:34:40,870
let me let me take myself out of it but
i think one of the more effective ways

9232
02:34:40,870 --> 02:34:40,880
i think one of the more effective ways
 

9233
02:34:40,880 --> 02:34:43,030
i think one of the more effective ways
is you don't need the surveillance you

9234
02:34:43,030 --> 02:34:43,040
is you don't need the surveillance you
 

9235
02:34:43,040 --> 02:34:46,230
is you don't need the surveillance you
can pick out a random person and and

9236
02:34:46,230 --> 02:34:46,240
can pick out a random person and and
 

9237
02:34:46,240 --> 02:34:50,150
can pick out a random person and and
in a public display semi-public display

9238
02:34:50,150 --> 02:34:50,160
in a public display semi-public display
 

9239
02:34:50,160 --> 02:34:53,349
in a public display semi-public display
you know basically put them in jail for

9240
02:34:53,349 --> 02:34:53,359
you know basically put them in jail for
 

9241
02:34:53,359 --> 02:34:54,710
you know basically put them in jail for
opposing the government whether they

9242
02:34:54,710 --> 02:34:54,720
opposing the government whether they
 

9243
02:34:54,720 --> 02:34:57,349
opposing the government whether they
oppose it or not and the fear

9244
02:34:57,349 --> 02:34:57,359
oppose it or not and the fear
 

9245
02:34:57,359 --> 02:34:59,349
oppose it or not and the fear
that sends a message to a lot of people

9246
02:34:59,349 --> 02:34:59,359
that sends a message to a lot of people
 

9247
02:34:59,359 --> 02:35:00,790
that sends a message to a lot of people
that's exactly what you see happening in

9248
02:35:00,790 --> 02:35:00,800
that's exactly what you see happening in
 

9249
02:35:00,800 --> 02:35:01,910
that's exactly what you see happening in
china

9250
02:35:01,910 --> 02:35:01,920
china
 

9251
02:35:01,920 --> 02:35:03,590
china
that's what you just light out it's

9252
02:35:03,590 --> 02:35:03,600
that's what you just light out it's
 

9253
02:35:03,600 --> 02:35:05,670
that's what you just light out it's
genius and that is the that is the

9254
02:35:05,670 --> 02:35:05,680
genius and that is the that is the
 

9255
02:35:05,680 --> 02:35:07,190
genius and that is the that is the
standard you don't need the surveillance

9256
02:35:07,190 --> 02:35:07,200
standard you don't need the surveillance
 

9257
02:35:07,200 --> 02:35:08,950
standard you don't need the surveillance
for that yep

9258
02:35:08,950 --> 02:35:08,960
for that yep
 

9259
02:35:08,960 --> 02:35:11,429
for that yep
but that said if you did do the

9260
02:35:11,429 --> 02:35:11,439
but that said if you did do the
 

9261
02:35:11,439 --> 02:35:13,030
but that said if you did do the
surveillance

9262
02:35:13,030 --> 02:35:13,040
surveillance
 

9263
02:35:13,040 --> 02:35:15,429
surveillance
uh so that's the support the sort of the

9264
02:35:15,429 --> 02:35:15,439
uh so that's the support the sort of the
 

9265
02:35:15,439 --> 02:35:17,590
uh so that's the support the sort of the
incentives aren't aligned it seems like

9266
02:35:17,590 --> 02:35:17,600
incentives aren't aligned it seems like
 

9267
02:35:17,600 --> 02:35:19,110
incentives aren't aligned it seems like
a lot of work to do for the thing you

9268
02:35:19,110 --> 02:35:19,120
a lot of work to do for the thing you
 

9269
02:35:19,120 --> 02:35:21,349
a lot of work to do for the thing you
could do without the surveillance right

9270
02:35:21,349 --> 02:35:21,359
could do without the surveillance right
 

9271
02:35:21,359 --> 02:35:22,389
could do without the surveillance right
but

9272
02:35:22,389 --> 02:35:22,399
but
 

9273
02:35:22,399 --> 02:35:23,510
but
you know

9274
02:35:23,510 --> 02:35:23,520
you know
 

9275
02:35:23,520 --> 02:35:26,389
you know
yes the courts wouldn't uh if if you

9276
02:35:26,389 --> 02:35:26,399
yes the courts wouldn't uh if if you
 

9277
02:35:26,399 --> 02:35:29,270
yes the courts wouldn't uh if if you
were to be able to get a list of people

9278
02:35:29,270 --> 02:35:29,280
were to be able to get a list of people
 

9279
02:35:29,280 --> 02:35:31,270
were to be able to get a list of people
which i think that part you could do

9280
02:35:31,270 --> 02:35:31,280
which i think that part you could do
 

9281
02:35:31,280 --> 02:35:33,590
which i think that part you could do
correct uh and that opposed the

9282
02:35:33,590 --> 02:35:33,600
correct uh and that opposed the
 

9283
02:35:33,600 --> 02:35:35,190
correct uh and that opposed the
government you could do that on like

9284
02:35:35,190 --> 02:35:35,200
government you could do that on like
 

9285
02:35:35,200 --> 02:35:36,790
government you could do that on like
just like you said on twitter publicly

9286
02:35:36,790 --> 02:35:36,800
just like you said on twitter publicly
 

9287
02:35:36,800 --> 02:35:38,550
just like you said on twitter publicly
you could make a list

9288
02:35:38,550 --> 02:35:38,560
you could make a list
 

9289
02:35:38,560 --> 02:35:39,429
you could make a list
and

9290
02:35:39,429 --> 02:35:39,439
and
 

9291
02:35:39,439 --> 02:35:41,510
and
with that you can start to if especially

9292
02:35:41,510 --> 02:35:41,520
with that you can start to if especially
 

9293
02:35:41,520 --> 02:35:42,710
with that you can start to if especially
if you have a lot of data on those

9294
02:35:42,710 --> 02:35:42,720
if you have a lot of data on those
 

9295
02:35:42,720 --> 02:35:44,550
if you have a lot of data on those
people find ways in which they did

9296
02:35:44,550 --> 02:35:44,560
people find ways in which they did
 

9297
02:35:44,560 --> 02:35:46,469
people find ways in which they did
violate the law

9298
02:35:46,469 --> 02:35:46,479
violate the law
 

9299
02:35:46,479 --> 02:35:48,710
violate the law

9300
02:35:48,710 --> 02:35:48,720
not because they oppose the government
 

9301
02:35:48,720 --> 02:35:50,469
not because they oppose the government
but because in some other way the

9302
02:35:50,469 --> 02:35:50,479
but because in some other way the

02:36:09,830 --> 02:36:09,840
in those countries everybody's breaking
 

9321
02:36:09,840 --> 02:36:10,870
in those countries everybody's breaking
the law

9322
02:36:10,870 --> 02:36:10,880
the law
 

9323
02:36:10,880 --> 02:36:13,750
the law
because in a corrupt nation you have to

9324
02:36:13,750 --> 02:36:13,760
because in a corrupt nation you have to
 

9325
02:36:13,760 --> 02:36:15,670
because in a corrupt nation you have to
bend the law to operate

9326
02:36:15,670 --> 02:36:15,680
bend the law to operate
 

9327
02:36:15,680 --> 02:36:17,910
bend the law to operate
like the number of people that pay taxes

9328
02:36:17,910 --> 02:36:17,920
like the number of people that pay taxes
 

9329
02:36:17,920 --> 02:36:21,110
like the number of people that pay taxes
fully in those nations is just very low

9330
02:36:21,110 --> 02:36:21,120
fully in those nations is just very low
 

9331
02:36:21,120 --> 02:36:22,469
fully in those nations is just very low
if not zero

9332
02:36:22,469 --> 02:36:22,479
if not zero
 

9333
02:36:22,479 --> 02:36:24,309
if not zero
and so uh

9334
02:36:24,309 --> 02:36:24,319
and so uh
 

9335
02:36:24,319 --> 02:36:26,389
and so uh
they then use that breaking of the law

9336
02:36:26,389 --> 02:36:26,399
they then use that breaking of the law
 

9337
02:36:26,399 --> 02:36:28,389
they then use that breaking of the law
to come up with an excuse to actually

9338
02:36:28,389 --> 02:36:28,399
to come up with an excuse to actually
 

9339
02:36:28,399 --> 02:36:30,630
to come up with an excuse to actually
put you in jail based on that

9340
02:36:30,630 --> 02:36:30,640
put you in jail based on that
 

9341
02:36:30,640 --> 02:36:33,190
put you in jail based on that
you know so it's possible to imagine but

9342
02:36:33,190 --> 02:36:33,200
you know so it's possible to imagine but
 

9343
02:36:33,200 --> 02:36:35,750
you know so it's possible to imagine but
yes i think

9344
02:36:35,750 --> 02:36:35,760
yes i think
 

9345
02:36:35,760 --> 02:36:38,630
yes i think
i think that's the ugly part of

9346
02:36:38,630 --> 02:36:38,640
i think that's the ugly part of
 

9347
02:36:38,640 --> 02:36:41,270
i think that's the ugly part of
surveillance but i do think just like

9348
02:36:41,270 --> 02:36:41,280
surveillance but i do think just like
 

9349
02:36:41,280 --> 02:36:43,429
surveillance but i do think just like
you said the incentives aren't correct

9350
02:36:43,429 --> 02:36:43,439
you said the incentives aren't correct
 

9351

02:36:44,790 --> 02:36:44,800
like you really
 

9353
02:36:44,800 --> 02:36:47,030
like you really
don't need to get all of the secret

9354
02:36:47,030 --> 02:36:47,040
don't need to get all of the secret

a charismatic powerful leader that built
 

9361
02:36:53,920 --> 02:36:55,750
a charismatic powerful leader that built
up a network that's able to control a

authoritarianism
 

9367
02:37:00,560 --> 02:37:02,790
authoritarianism
in a government they're just able to do

9543
02:39:52,160 --> 02:39:54,550
emirati government so i had these
different variances right

9544
02:39:54,550 --> 02:39:54,560
different variances right
 

9545
02:39:54,560 --> 02:39:57,110
different variances right
long story short in the end

9546
02:39:57,110 --> 02:39:57,120
long story short in the end
 

9547
02:39:57,120 --> 02:39:59,670
long story short in the end
the surveillance state is what made sure

9548
02:39:59,670 --> 02:39:59,680
the surveillance state is what made sure
 

9549
02:39:59,680 --> 02:40:01,750
the surveillance state is what made sure
that justice was played

9550
02:40:01,750 --> 02:40:01,760
that justice was played
 

9551
02:40:01,760 --> 02:40:04,469
that justice was played
because the proof was

9552
02:40:04,469 --> 02:40:04,479
because the proof was
 

9553
02:40:04,479 --> 02:40:07,030
because the proof was
was incontrovertible

9554
02:40:07,030 --> 02:40:07,040
was incontrovertible
 

9555
02:40:07,040 --> 02:40:09,190
was incontrovertible
there was so much evidence collected

9556
02:40:09,190 --> 02:40:09,200
there was so much evidence collected
 

9557
02:40:09,200 --> 02:40:10,550
there was so much evidence collected
because of the surveillance nature of

9558
02:40:10,550 --> 02:40:10,560
because of the surveillance nature of
 

9559
02:40:10,560 --> 02:40:12,070
because of the surveillance nature of
their state now why do they have a

9560
02:40:12,070 --> 02:40:12,080
their state now why do they have a
 

9561
02:40:12,080 --> 02:40:13,429
their state now why do they have a
surveillance state it's not for people

9562
02:40:13,429 --> 02:40:13,439
surveillance state it's not for people
 

9563
02:40:13,439 --> 02:40:14,309
surveillance state it's not for people
like me

9564
02:40:14,309 --> 02:40:14,319
like me
 

9565
02:40:14,319 --> 02:40:16,550
like me
it's because they're constantly afraid

9566
02:40:16,550 --> 02:40:16,560
it's because they're constantly afraid
 

9567
02:40:16,560 --> 02:40:19,269
it's because they're constantly afraid
of extreme extremist terrorist activity

9568
02:40:19,269 --> 02:40:19,279
of extreme extremist terrorist activity
 

9569
02:40:19,279 --> 02:40:21,990
of extreme extremist terrorist activity
happening inside abu dhabi or inside the

9570
02:40:21,990 --> 02:40:22,000
happening inside abu dhabi or inside the
 

9571
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:23,830
happening inside abu dhabi or inside the
uae because they're under constant

9572
02:40:23,830 --> 02:40:23,840
uae because they're under constant
 

9573
02:40:23,840 --> 02:40:26,070
uae because they're under constant
threat from islam and there are from

9574
02:40:26,070 --> 02:40:26,080
threat from islam and there are from
 

9575
02:40:26,080 --> 02:40:27,190
threat from islam and there are from
from extremists and they're under

9576
02:40:27,190 --> 02:40:27,200
from extremists and they're under
 

9577
02:40:27,200 --> 02:40:29,269
from extremists and they're under
constant threat from iran so that's what

9578
02:40:29,269 --> 02:40:29,279
constant threat from iran so that's what
 

9579
02:40:29,279 --> 02:40:30,389
constant threat from iran so that's what
drives

9580
02:40:30,389 --> 02:40:30,399
drives
 

9581
02:40:30,399 --> 02:40:32,070
drives
the people to want a police state to

9582
02:40:32,070 --> 02:40:32,080
the people to want a police state to
 

9583
02:40:32,080 --> 02:40:34,790
the people to want a police state to
want a surveillance state for them

9584
02:40:34,790 --> 02:40:34,800
want a surveillance state for them
 

9585
02:40:34,800 --> 02:40:36,630
want a surveillance state for them
their survival is paramount and they

9586
02:40:36,630 --> 02:40:36,640
their survival is paramount and they
 

9587
02:40:36,640 --> 02:40:38,150
their survival is paramount and they
need the surveillance to have that

9588
02:40:38,150 --> 02:40:38,160
need the surveillance to have that
 

9589
02:40:38,160 --> 02:40:40,230
need the surveillance to have that
survival for us we haven't tasted that

9590
02:40:40,230 --> 02:40:40,240
survival for us we haven't tasted that
 

9591
02:40:40,240 --> 02:40:43,349
survival for us we haven't tasted that
level of desperation and fear

9592
02:40:43,349 --> 02:40:43,359
level of desperation and fear
 

9593
02:40:43,359 --> 02:40:45,510
level of desperation and fear
yet or hopefully never but that's what

9594
02:40:45,510 --> 02:40:45,520
yet or hopefully never but that's what
 

9595
02:40:45,520 --> 02:40:46,710
yet or hopefully never but that's what
makes us feel like there's something

9596
02:40:46,710 --> 02:40:46,720
makes us feel like there's something
 

9597
02:40:46,720 --> 02:40:48,950
makes us feel like there's something
wrong with surveillance

9598
02:40:48,950 --> 02:40:48,960
wrong with surveillance
 

9599
02:40:48,960 --> 02:40:50,389
wrong with surveillance
surveillance is all about the purpose

9600
02:40:50,389 --> 02:40:50,399
surveillance is all about the purpose
 

9601
02:40:50,399 --> 02:40:51,990
surveillance is all about the purpose
it's all about the intent

9602
02:40:51,990 --> 02:40:52,000
it's all about the intent
 

9603
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,710
it's all about the intent
well and like like you said companies do

9604
02:40:54,710 --> 02:40:54,720
well and like like you said companies do
 

9605
02:40:54,720 --> 02:40:56,790
well and like like you said companies do
a significant amount of surveillance to

9606
02:40:56,790 --> 02:40:56,800
a significant amount of surveillance to
 

9607
02:40:56,800 --> 02:40:59,830
a significant amount of surveillance to
provide us with services that we uh take

9608
02:40:59,830 --> 02:40:59,840
provide us with services that we uh take
 

9609
02:40:59,840 --> 02:41:02,070
provide us with services that we uh take
for granted for example just um one of

9610
02:41:02,070 --> 02:41:02,080
for granted for example just um one of
 

9611
02:41:02,080 --> 02:41:03,190
for granted for example just um one of
the things

9612
02:41:03,190 --> 02:41:03,200
the things
 

9613
02:41:03,200 --> 02:41:06,150
the things
to give props to the digital efforts of

9614
02:41:06,150 --> 02:41:06,160
to give props to the digital efforts of
 

9615
02:41:06,160 --> 02:41:08,309
to give props to the digital efforts of
the zielenski administration in ukraine

9616
02:41:08,309 --> 02:41:08,319
the zielenski administration in ukraine
 

9617
02:41:08,319 --> 02:41:10,630
the zielenski administration in ukraine
i don't know if you're aware but they

they have this digital transformation
 

9621
02:41:12,319 --> 02:41:13,590
they have this digital transformation
efforts where

9622
02:41:13,590 --> 02:41:13,600
efforts where
 

9623
02:41:13,600 --> 02:41:16,870
efforts where
you can put like there's an

9624
02:41:16,870 --> 02:41:16,880
you can put like there's an
 

9625
02:41:16,880 --> 02:41:18,389
you can put like there's an
it's uh

9626
02:41:18,389 --> 02:41:18,399
it's uh
 

9627
02:41:18,399 --> 02:41:19,990
it's uh
it's laughable to say in the united

9628
02:41:19,990 --> 02:41:20,000
it's laughable to say in the united
 

9629
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:21,429
it's laughable to say in the united
states but they actually did a really

9630
02:41:21,429 --> 02:41:21,439
states but they actually did a really
 

9631
02:41:21,439 --> 02:41:24,150
states but they actually did a really
good job of having a government app

9632
02:41:24,150 --> 02:41:24,160
good job of having a government app
 

9633
02:41:24,160 --> 02:41:25,990
good job of having a government app
that has your passport on it it's all

the digital information you can get a
 

9637
02:41:27,920 --> 02:41:30,630
the digital information you can get a
doctor it's like everything that you

9638
02:41:30,630 --> 02:41:30,640
doctor it's like everything that you
 

9639
02:41:30,640 --> 02:41:32,950
doctor it's like everything that you
would think america would be doing

9640

uh you know like license like all that

9642
02:41:35,030 --> 02:41:35,040
uh you know like license like all that
 

9643
02:41:35,040 --> 02:41:36,950
uh you know like license like all that
kind of stuff it's in an app you could

9644
02:41:36,950 --> 02:41:36,960
kind of stuff it's in an app you could
 

9645
02:41:36,960 --> 02:41:39,510
kind of stuff it's in an app you could
pay this payment to each other

9646
02:41:39,510 --> 02:41:39,520
pay this payment to each other
 

9647
02:41:39,520 --> 02:41:41,510
pay this payment to each other
and that's all coming i mean there's

9648
02:41:41,510 --> 02:41:41,520
and that's all coming i mean there's
 

9649
02:41:41,520 --> 02:41:43,110
and that's all coming i mean there's
probably contractors somehow connected

9650
02:41:43,110 --> 02:41:43,120
probably contractors somehow connected
 

9651
02:41:43,120 --> 02:41:45,030
probably contractors somehow connected
to the whole thing but that's like under

9652
02:41:45,030 --> 02:41:45,040
to the whole thing but that's like under
 

9653
02:41:45,040 --> 02:41:47,750
to the whole thing but that's like under
the flag of government and so that's an

9654
02:41:47,750 --> 02:41:47,760
the flag of government and so that's an
 

9655
02:41:47,760 --> 02:41:50,469
the flag of government and so that's an
incredible technology and i didn't i

9656
02:41:50,469 --> 02:41:50,479
incredible technology and i didn't i
 

9657
02:41:50,479 --> 02:41:51,830
incredible technology and i didn't i
guess hear anybody talk about

9658
02:41:51,830 --> 02:41:51,840
guess hear anybody talk about
 

9659
02:41:51,840 --> 02:41:54,070
guess hear anybody talk about
surveillance in that context even though

9660
02:41:54,070 --> 02:41:54,080
surveillance in that context even though
 

9661
02:41:54,080 --> 02:41:56,469
surveillance in that context even though
it is but they all love it and it's

9662
02:41:56,469 --> 02:41:56,479
it is but they all love it and it's
 

9663
02:41:56,479 --> 02:41:59,190
it is but they all love it and it's
super easy and they frankly already it's

super easy and they frankly already it's
 

9665
02:41:59,200 --> 02:42:01,190
super easy and they frankly already it's
so easy and convenient they've already

so easy and convenient they've already
 

9667
02:42:01,200 --> 02:42:03,349
so easy and convenient they've already
taken for granted that of course this is

and that's all because of the decisions

9842
02:44:53,190 --> 02:44:53,200
and that's all because of the decisions
 

9843

that he made
 

9845
02:44:54,240 --> 02:44:55,750
that he made
and the order that he made them i'm not

9846

the case you're making is a difficult

9850
02:44:59,910 --> 02:44:59,920

9868
02:45:18,070 --> 02:45:18,080
and i think that there is some aspect to
 

9869
02:45:18,080 --> 02:45:19,190
and i think that there is some aspect to
which

9870
02:45:19,190 --> 02:45:19,200
which
 

9871
02:45:19,200 --> 02:45:21,590
which
taking that side case aside

9872
02:45:21,590 --> 02:45:21,600
taking that side case aside
 

9873
02:45:21,600 --> 02:45:23,590
taking that side case aside
that is the american

9874
02:45:23,590 --> 02:45:23,600
that is the american
 

9875
02:45:23,600 --> 02:45:24,630
that is the american
spirit

9876
02:45:24,630 --> 02:45:24,640
spirit
 

9877
02:45:24,640 --> 02:45:26,309
spirit
which is

9878
02:45:26,309 --> 02:45:26,319
which is
 

9879
02:45:26,319 --> 02:45:28,790
which is
hold the powerful accountable

9880
02:45:28,790 --> 02:45:28,800
hold the powerful accountable
 

9881
02:45:28,800 --> 02:45:31,269
hold the powerful accountable
so whenever there's somebody in power

9882
02:45:31,269 --> 02:45:31,279
so whenever there's somebody in power
 

9883
02:45:31,279 --> 02:45:33,670
so whenever there's somebody in power
one individual can

9884
02:45:33,670 --> 02:45:33,680
one individual can
 

9885
02:45:33,680 --> 02:45:34,790
one individual can
change

9886
02:45:34,790 --> 02:45:34,800
change
 

9887
02:45:34,800 --> 02:45:35,910
change
um

9888
02:45:35,910 --> 02:45:35,920
um
 

9889
02:45:35,920 --> 02:45:37,990
um
can can uh

9890
02:45:37,990 --> 02:45:38,000
can can uh
 

9891
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:39,429
can can uh
one man can make a difference it can

9892
02:45:39,429 --> 02:45:39,439
one man can make a difference it can
 

9893
02:45:39,439 --> 02:45:40,830
one man can make a difference it can
make a difference

9894
02:45:40,830 --> 02:45:40,840
make a difference
 

9895
02:45:40,840 --> 02:45:43,269
make a difference
yeah of you well i mean

9896
02:45:43,269 --> 02:45:43,279
yeah of you well i mean
 

9897
02:45:43,279 --> 02:45:45,429
yeah of you well i mean
that's the american individualism and so

9898
02:45:45,429 --> 02:45:45,439
that's the american individualism and so
 

9899
02:45:45,439 --> 02:45:47,510
that's the american individualism and so
he represents that and i think there's a

9900
02:45:47,510 --> 02:45:47,520
he represents that and i think there's a
 

9901
02:45:47,520 --> 02:45:49,590
he represents that and i think there's a
huge skepticism

9902
02:45:49,590 --> 02:45:49,600
huge skepticism
 

9903
02:45:49,600 --> 02:45:52,870
huge skepticism
against large federal institutions

9904
02:45:52,870 --> 02:45:52,880
against large federal institutions
 

9905
02:45:52,880 --> 02:45:54,870
against large federal institutions
and i think if you look at the long arc

9906
02:45:54,870 --> 02:45:54,880
and i think if you look at the long arc
 

9907
02:45:54,880 --> 02:45:56,550
and i think if you look at the long arc
of history

9908
02:45:56,550 --> 02:45:56,560
of history
 

9909
02:45:56,560 --> 02:45:59,030
of history
that actually is a forcing function for

9910
02:45:59,030 --> 02:45:59,040
that actually is a forcing function for
 

9911
02:45:59,040 --> 02:46:02,070
that actually is a forcing function for
the institutions to behave their best

9912
02:46:02,070 --> 02:46:02,080
the institutions to behave their best
 

9913
02:46:02,080 --> 02:46:04,230
the institutions to behave their best
so

9914
02:46:04,230 --> 02:46:04,240
so
 

9915
02:46:04,240 --> 02:46:06,389
so
basically hold them accountable

9916
02:46:06,389 --> 02:46:06,399
basically hold them accountable
 

9917
02:46:06,399 --> 02:46:08,070
basically hold them accountable
if

9918
02:46:08,070 --> 02:46:08,080
if
 

9919
02:46:08,080 --> 02:46:09,830
if
what's nice about this is that we can

9920
02:46:09,830 --> 02:46:09,840
what's nice about this is that we can
 

9921
02:46:09,840 --> 02:46:12,309
what's nice about this is that we can
agree to disagree and history will be

9922
02:46:12,309 --> 02:46:12,319
agree to disagree and history will be
 

9923
02:46:12,319 --> 02:46:15,429
agree to disagree and history will be
the one that decides but but once

9924
02:46:15,429 --> 02:46:15,439
the one that decides but but once
 

9925
02:46:15,439 --> 02:46:17,910
the one that decides but but once
like there's a reason that edward

9926
02:46:17,910 --> 02:46:17,920
like there's a reason that edward
 

9927
02:46:17,920 --> 02:46:20,309
like there's a reason that edward
snowden needs to do something

9928
02:46:20,309 --> 02:46:20,319
snowden needs to do something
 

9929
02:46:20,319 --> 02:46:23,510
snowden needs to do something

9933

right
 

9935
02:46:25,680 --> 02:46:27,269
right
because if he didn't he would just be

9939
02:46:28,399 --> 02:46:30,710
forgotten
because he was not a maverick who

02:46:30,710 --> 02:46:30,720
because he was not a maverick who

02:46:33,110 --> 02:46:33,120
changed history for the better he was a
 

9943
02:46:33,120 --> 02:46:36,389
changed history for the better he was a
man who broke a law and now he's on the

9944
02:46:36,389 --> 02:46:36,399
man who broke a law and now he's on the
 

9945

man who broke a law and now he's on the
run

9946
02:46:37,429 --> 02:46:37,439
run
 

9947
02:46:37,439 --> 02:46:40,950
run
and to some people he is a hero

9948
02:46:40,950 --> 02:46:40,960
and to some people he is a hero
 

9949
02:46:40,960 --> 02:46:43,030
and to some people he is a hero
to other people he is a criminal but to

9950
02:46:43,030 --> 02:46:43,040
to other people he is a criminal but to
 

9951
02:46:43,040 --> 02:46:46,710
to other people he is a criminal but to
the vast majority he's just a blip on a

9952
02:46:46,710 --> 02:46:46,720
the vast majority he's just a blip on a
 

9953
02:46:46,720 --> 02:46:48,790
the vast majority he's just a blip on a
radar of their everyday life that really

9954
02:46:48,790 --> 02:46:48,800
radar of their everyday life that really
 

9955
02:46:48,800 --> 02:46:50,710
radar of their everyday life that really
makes no difference to them at all so

9956
02:46:50,710 --> 02:46:50,720
makes no difference to them at all so
 

9957
02:46:50,720 --> 02:46:52,710
makes no difference to them at all so
actually let's linger on that so just to

9958
02:46:52,710 --> 02:46:52,720
actually let's linger on that so just to
 

9959
02:46:52,720 --> 02:46:55,910
actually let's linger on that so just to
clarify do you think

9960
02:46:55,910 --> 02:46:55,920

 

9961
02:46:55,920 --> 02:46:57,670

are you making the difficult case that

9962
02:46:57,670 --> 02:46:57,680
are you making the difficult case that
 

9963
02:46:57,680 --> 02:47:00,710
are you making the difficult case that
the nsa mass surveillance program

9964
02:47:00,710 --> 02:47:00,720
the nsa mass surveillance program
 

9965
02:47:00,720 --> 02:47:03,269
the nsa mass surveillance program
was one ethical and two made a better

9966
02:47:03,269 --> 02:47:03,279
was one ethical and two made a better
 

9967
02:47:03,279 --> 02:47:06,230
was one ethical and two made a better
world for americans i am i am making the

9968
02:47:06,230 --> 02:47:06,240
world for americans i am i am making the
 

9969
02:47:06,240 --> 02:47:07,110
world for americans i am i am making the
case

9970
02:47:07,110 --> 02:47:07,120
case
 

9971
02:47:07,120 --> 02:47:09,590
case
that at the time it was exactly what we

9972
02:47:09,590 --> 02:47:09,600
that at the time it was exactly what we
 

9973
02:47:09,600 --> 02:47:10,710
that at the time it was exactly what we
needed

9974
02:47:10,710 --> 02:47:10,720
needed
 

9975
02:47:10,720 --> 02:47:13,269
needed
to feel safe in our own homes but what

9976
02:47:13,269 --> 02:47:13,279
to feel safe in our own homes but what
 

9977
02:47:13,279 --> 02:47:15,910
to feel safe in our own homes but what
about to be safe actually be safe this

9978
02:47:15,910 --> 02:47:15,920
about to be safe actually be safe this
 

9979
02:47:15,920 --> 02:47:17,590
about to be safe actually be safe this
is you so this is what's difficult

9980
02:47:17,590 --> 02:47:17,600
is you so this is what's difficult
 

9981
02:47:17,600 --> 02:47:18,950
is you so this is what's difficult
because any proof

9982
02:47:18,950 --> 02:47:18,960
because any proof
 

9983
02:47:18,960 --> 02:47:20,790
because any proof
that was that they collected

9984
02:47:20,790 --> 02:47:20,800
that was that they collected
 

9985
02:47:20,800 --> 02:47:22,790
that was that they collected
that actually prevented an attack from

9986
02:47:22,790 --> 02:47:22,800
that actually prevented an attack from
 

9987
02:47:22,800 --> 02:47:24,230
that actually prevented an attack from
happening is proof we'll never know

9988
02:47:24,230 --> 02:47:24,240
happening is proof we'll never know
 

9989
02:47:24,240 --> 02:47:25,830
happening is proof we'll never know
about this is the

9990
02:47:25,830 --> 02:47:25,840
about this is the
 

9991
02:47:25,840 --> 02:47:27,349
about this is the
the really unfortunate side of

9992
02:47:27,349 --> 02:47:27,359
the really unfortunate side of
 

9993
02:47:27,359 --> 02:47:28,870
the really unfortunate side of
intelligence operations and i've been at

9994
02:47:28,870 --> 02:47:28,880
intelligence operations and i've been at
 

9995
02:47:28,880 --> 02:47:30,389
intelligence operations and i've been at
the front end of this

9996
02:47:30,389 --> 02:47:30,399
the front end of this
 

9997
02:47:30,399 --> 02:47:33,110
the front end of this
you work your ass off you take personal

9998
02:47:33,110 --> 02:47:33,120
you work your ass off you take personal
 

9999
02:47:33,120 --> 02:47:35,349
you work your ass off you take personal
risk you make personal sacrifice to make

10000
02:47:35,349 --> 02:47:35,359
risk you make personal sacrifice to make
 

10001
02:47:35,359 --> 02:47:36,870
risk you make personal sacrifice to make
sure that something terrible doesn't

happen
nobody knows that that ever happens does

nobody knows that that ever happens does
 

10007
02:47:39,920 --> 02:47:42,870
nobody knows that that ever happens does
that have to be that way is does it is

10008
02:47:42,870 --> 02:47:42,880
that have to be that way is does it is
 

10009

that have to be that way is does it is
does it have to remain secret every time

10010
02:47:45,910 --> 02:47:45,920
does it have to remain secret every time
 

10011
02:47:45,920 --> 02:47:49,510
does it have to remain secret every time
the nsa or the cia saves

02:47:56,640 --> 02:47:58,790
the same thing we were talking about
with with general petraeus

you can't brag about your victories
 

10025
02:48:01,439 --> 02:48:03,670

yeah but then you operate in the secrecy

10410
02:54:34,070 --> 02:54:34,080
yeah but then you operate in the secrecy
 

10411
02:54:34,080 --> 02:54:36,309
yeah but then you operate in the secrecy
and then there's there's uh

10412
02:54:36,309 --> 02:54:36,319
and then there's there's uh
 

10413
02:54:36,319 --> 02:54:38,870
and then there's there's uh
corrupt and douchebag people everywhere

10414
02:54:38,870 --> 02:54:38,880
corrupt and douchebag people everywhere
 

10415
02:54:38,880 --> 02:54:39,990
corrupt and douchebag people everywhere
so when they

10416
02:54:39,990 --> 02:54:40,000
so when they
 

10417
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:43,190
so when they
even inside the cia and criminals inside

even inside the cia and criminals inside
 

10419
02:54:43,200 --> 02:54:44,950
even inside the cia and criminals inside
the cia there's criminals in all

10420
02:54:44,950 --> 02:54:44,960
the cia there's criminals in all
 

10421
02:54:44,960 --> 02:54:47,670
the cia there's criminals in all

case
 

10427
02:54:50,399 --> 02:54:53,190
case
then it breeds conspiracy theories it

10428
02:54:53,190 --> 02:54:53,200
then it breeds conspiracy theories it
 

10429
02:54:53,200 --> 02:54:54,630
then it breeds conspiracy theories it
does

does
 

10431
02:54:54,640 --> 02:54:56,230
does
and sometimes those conspiracy theories

10432
02:54:56,230 --> 02:54:56,240
and sometimes those conspiracy theories
 

10433
02:54:56,240 --> 02:54:58,870
and sometimes those conspiracy theories
turn out to be true but most times they

10434
02:54:58,870 --> 02:54:58,880
turn out to be true but most times they
 

10435
02:54:58,880 --> 02:55:01,670
turn out to be true but most times they
don't that's just part of the risk of

02:55:01,670 --> 02:55:01,680
don't that's just part of the risk of

02:55:01,680 --> 02:55:03,910
don't that's just part of the risk of

maybe even torture

maybe even torture
the scale of the program is perhaps not

the scale of the program is perhaps not

uh how do you make sense that this

10466
02:55:30,710 --> 02:55:30,720
uh how do you make sense that this
 

10467
02:55:30,720 --> 02:55:32,550
uh how do you make sense that this
program existed again you've got to look

10468
02:55:32,550 --> 02:55:32,560
program existed again you've got to look
 

10469
02:55:32,560 --> 02:55:33,990
program existed again you've got to look
through the lens of time you've got to

through the lens of time you've got to
 

10471
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:35,429
through the lens of time you've got to
look at where we were historically at

10472
02:55:35,429 --> 02:55:35,439
look at where we were historically at
 

10473
02:55:35,439 --> 02:55:37,110
look at where we were historically at
that time there was the peak of the cold

10474
02:55:37,110 --> 02:55:37,120
that time there was the peak of the cold

our enemies were doing the same kind of

our enemies were doing the same kind of
 

10479
02:55:40,640 --> 02:55:42,950
our enemies were doing the same kind of
experimentation it was essentially

10480
02:55:42,950 --> 02:55:42,960
experimentation it was essentially
 

10481
02:55:42,960 --> 02:55:46,389
experimentation it was essentially
another space race what if they broke

10482
02:55:46,389 --> 02:55:46,399
another space race what if they broke
 

10483
02:55:46,399 --> 02:55:47,990
another space race what if they broke
through a new

10484

through a new
 

10485
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:50,070
through a new

10487
02:55:50,080 --> 02:55:51,590

what would that mean for the safety and

10488
02:55:51,590 --> 02:55:51,600
what would that mean for the safety and
 

10489
02:55:51,600 --> 02:55:54,710
what would that mean for the safety and

so

10492
02:55:55,429 --> 02:55:55,439
so
 

10493
02:55:55,439 --> 02:55:57,910
so
right decision or wrong decision it was

the outcome of mkultra and the outcome

10520
02:56:23,990 --> 02:56:24,000
the outcome of mkultra and the outcome

were supposed to do
 

10527
02:56:28,319 --> 02:56:30,230
were supposed to do
we still know that to this day

10528
02:56:30,230 --> 02:56:30,240
we still know that to this day
 

10529
02:56:30,240 --> 02:56:31,830
we still know that to this day
there's still a demand

10530
02:56:31,830 --> 02:56:31,840
there's still a demand
 

10531
02:56:31,840 --> 02:56:34,309
there's still a demand
in the us government and ncia for people

10532
02:56:34,309 --> 02:56:34,319
in the us government and ncia for people
 

10533
02:56:34,319 --> 02:56:36,230
in the us government and ncia for people
who have sensitivities to

who have sensitivities to

02:56:36,240 --> 02:56:38,630
who have sensitivities to
ethereal energies

10536
02:56:38,630 --> 02:56:38,640
ethereal energies
 

10537
02:56:38,640 --> 02:56:40,630
ethereal energies
oh by the way is there any proof that

10538
02:56:40,630 --> 02:56:40,640
oh by the way is there any proof that
 

10539
02:56:40,640 --> 02:56:43,110
oh by the way is there any proof that
that kind of stuff works or just

10540
02:56:43,110 --> 02:56:43,120
that kind of stuff works or just
 

10541
02:56:43,120 --> 02:56:44,710
that kind of stuff works or just
it just shows

10542
02:56:44,710 --> 02:56:44,720
it just shows
 

10543
02:56:44,720 --> 02:56:46,550
it just shows
it shows that there's interest it shows

10544
02:56:46,550 --> 02:56:46,560
it shows that there's interest it shows
 

10545
02:56:46,560 --> 02:56:48,389
it shows that there's interest it shows
that there's openness to consider those

10546
02:56:48,389 --> 02:56:48,399
that there's openness to consider those
 

10547
02:56:48,399 --> 02:56:50,150
that there's openness to consider those
kinds of things but is there any

10548
02:56:50,150 --> 02:56:50,160
kinds of things but is there any
 

10549
02:56:50,160 --> 02:56:51,590
kinds of things but is there any
evidence that that kind of stuff works

10550
02:56:51,590 --> 02:56:51,600
evidence that that kind of stuff works
 

10551
02:56:51,600 --> 02:56:53,510
evidence that that kind of stuff works
if there's evidence i haven't seen it

10552
02:56:53,510 --> 02:56:53,520
if there's evidence i haven't seen it
 

10553
02:56:53,520 --> 02:56:54,710
if there's evidence i haven't seen it
yeah

10554
02:56:54,710 --> 02:56:54,720
yeah
 

10555
02:56:54,720 --> 02:56:55,750
yeah
speaking

10556
02:56:55,750 --> 02:56:55,760
speaking
 

10557
02:56:55,760 --> 02:56:58,710
speaking
from a science-based point of view only

10558
02:56:58,710 --> 02:56:58,720
from a science-based point of view only
 

10559
02:56:58,720 --> 02:57:00,870
from a science-based point of view only
if energy and matter

10560
02:57:00,870 --> 02:57:00,880
if energy and matter
 

10561
02:57:00,880 --> 02:57:02,870
if energy and matter
can always be exchanged

10562
02:57:02,870 --> 02:57:02,880
can always be exchanged
 

10563
02:57:02,880 --> 02:57:05,750
can always be exchanged
then a person who can understand and

10564
02:57:05,750 --> 02:57:05,760
then a person who can understand and
 

10565
02:57:05,760 --> 02:57:09,110
then a person who can understand and
and become sensitive to energy is a

10566
02:57:09,110 --> 02:57:09,120
and become sensitive to energy is a
 

10567
02:57:09,120 --> 02:57:10,630
and become sensitive to energy is a
person who could

10568
02:57:10,630 --> 02:57:10,640
person who could
 

10569
02:57:10,640 --> 02:57:12,550
person who could
become sensitive to what does become

10570
02:57:12,550 --> 02:57:12,560
become sensitive to what does become
 

10571
02:57:12,560 --> 02:57:13,590
become sensitive to what does become
matter

10572
02:57:13,590 --> 02:57:13,600
matter
 

10573
02:57:13,600 --> 02:57:15,269
matter
yeah i mean

10574
02:57:15,269 --> 02:57:15,279
yeah i mean
 

10575
02:57:15,279 --> 02:57:17,269
yeah i mean
the basics of the physics might be there

10576
02:57:17,269 --> 02:57:17,279
the basics of the physics might be there
 

10577
02:57:17,279 --> 02:57:19,030
the basics of the physics might be there
but a lot of people probably are

10578
02:57:19,030 --> 02:57:19,040
but a lot of people probably are
 

10579
02:57:19,040 --> 02:57:21,110
but a lot of people probably are
skeptical i'm skeptical too but i'm just

10580
02:57:21,110 --> 02:57:21,120
skeptical i'm skeptical too but i'm just
 

10581
02:57:21,120 --> 02:57:23,110
skeptical i'm skeptical too but i'm just
like you should be open-minded i mean

10582
02:57:23,110 --> 02:57:23,120
like you should be open-minded i mean
 

10583
02:57:23,120 --> 02:57:26,150
like you should be open-minded i mean
that's that's that's actually you know

10584
02:57:26,150 --> 02:57:26,160
that's that's that's actually you know
 

10585
02:57:26,160 --> 02:57:27,830
that's that's that's actually you know
that's what science is about is remain

10586
02:57:27,830 --> 02:57:27,840
that's what science is about is remain
 

10587
02:57:27,840 --> 02:57:29,750
that's what science is about is remain
open-minded even for the things that are

10588
02:57:29,750 --> 02:57:29,760
open-minded even for the things that are
 

10589
02:57:29,760 --> 02:57:31,349
open-minded even for the things that are
long shots because those are the things

10590
02:57:31,349 --> 02:57:31,359
long shots because those are the things
 

10591
02:57:31,359 --> 02:57:32,790
long shots because those are the things
that actually define scientific

10592
02:57:32,790 --> 02:57:32,800
that actually define scientific
 

10593
02:57:32,800 --> 02:57:34,230
that actually define scientific
revolutions

10594
02:57:34,230 --> 02:57:34,240
revolutions
 

10595
02:57:34,240 --> 02:57:37,510
revolutions
what about operation northwoods

10596
02:57:37,510 --> 02:57:37,520
what about operation northwoods
 

10597
02:57:37,520 --> 02:57:40,790
what about operation northwoods
it was a proposed 1962 false flag

10598
02:57:40,790 --> 02:57:40,800
it was a proposed 1962 false flag
 

10599
02:57:40,800 --> 02:57:43,030
it was a proposed 1962 false flag
operation by the dod

10600
02:57:43,030 --> 02:57:43,040
operation by the dod
 

10601
02:57:43,040 --> 02:57:43,990
operation by the dod
and

10602
02:57:43,990 --> 02:57:44,000
and
 

10603
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:46,950
and
the cia to be carried out by the cia to

10604

the cia to be carried out by the cia to
commit acts of terrorism on americans

10606
02:57:50,309 --> 02:57:50,319
commit acts of terrorism on americans
 

10607
02:57:50,319 --> 02:57:52,230
commit acts of terrorism on americans
and blame them on cuba

10608
02:57:52,230 --> 02:57:52,240
and blame them on cuba
 

10609
02:57:52,240 --> 02:57:54,469
and blame them on cuba
so jfk the president rejected the

10610
02:57:54,469 --> 02:57:54,479
so jfk the president rejected the
 

10611
02:57:54,479 --> 02:57:55,750
so jfk the president rejected the
proposal

10612
02:57:55,750 --> 02:57:55,760
proposal
 

10613
02:57:55,760 --> 02:57:57,510
proposal
what do you make that this was on the

10614
02:57:57,510 --> 02:57:57,520
what do you make that this was on the
 

10615
02:57:57,520 --> 02:57:59,590
what do you make that this was on the
table operation northwoods so it's

10616
02:57:59,590 --> 02:57:59,600
table operation northwoods so it's
 

10617
02:57:59,600 --> 02:58:01,830
table operation northwoods so it's
interesting uh first i'm glad that jfk

10618
02:58:01,830 --> 02:58:01,840
interesting uh first i'm glad that jfk
 

10619
02:58:01,840 --> 02:58:05,429
interesting uh first i'm glad that jfk
rejected it that's uh that's a good sign

10620
02:58:05,429 --> 02:58:05,439
rejected it that's uh that's a good sign
 

10621
02:58:05,439 --> 02:58:06,469
rejected it that's uh that's a good sign
so

10622
02:58:06,469 --> 02:58:06,479
so
 

10623
02:58:06,479 --> 02:58:09,030
so
we have to understand that good ideas

10624
02:58:09,030 --> 02:58:09,040
we have to understand that good ideas
 

10625
02:58:09,040 --> 02:58:12,389
we have to understand that good ideas
are oftentimes born from bad ideas

10626
02:58:12,389 --> 02:58:12,399
are oftentimes born from bad ideas
 

10627
02:58:12,399 --> 02:58:14,469
are oftentimes born from bad ideas
i had a really good friend of mine who

10628
02:58:14,469 --> 02:58:14,479
i had a really good friend of mine who
 

10629
02:58:14,479 --> 02:58:16,790
i had a really good friend of mine who
actually went on to become a pastor

10630
02:58:16,790 --> 02:58:16,800
actually went on to become a pastor
 

10631
02:58:16,800 --> 02:58:18,710
actually went on to become a pastor
and he used to say all the time that he

10632
02:58:18,710 --> 02:58:18,720
and he used to say all the time that he
 

10633
02:58:18,720 --> 02:58:20,309
and he used to say all the time that he
wanted all the bad ideas on the table

10634
02:58:20,309 --> 02:58:20,319
wanted all the bad ideas on the table
 

10635
02:58:20,319 --> 02:58:21,990
wanted all the bad ideas on the table
like give me all your bad ideas every

10636
02:58:21,990 --> 02:58:22,000
like give me all your bad ideas every
 

10637
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:23,910
like give me all your bad ideas every
time we had any kind of conversation and

10638
02:58:23,910 --> 02:58:23,920
time we had any kind of conversation and
 

10639
02:58:23,920 --> 02:58:25,190
time we had any kind of conversation and
i i was always one of those people who's

10640
02:58:25,190 --> 02:58:25,200
i i was always one of those people who's
 

10641
02:58:25,200 --> 02:58:26,630
i i was always one of those people who's
like isn't a bad idea just a waste of

10642
02:58:26,630 --> 02:58:26,640
like isn't a bad idea just a waste of
 

10643
02:58:26,640 --> 02:58:27,830
like isn't a bad idea just a waste of
time

10644
02:58:27,830 --> 02:58:27,840
time
 

10645
02:58:27,840 --> 02:58:29,429
time
and he was like no because the best

10646
02:58:29,429 --> 02:58:29,439
and he was like no because the best
 

10647
02:58:29,439 --> 02:58:32,309
and he was like no because the best
ideas oftentimes come from bad ideas so

10648
02:58:32,309 --> 02:58:32,319
ideas oftentimes come from bad ideas so
 

10649
02:58:32,319 --> 02:58:35,110
ideas oftentimes come from bad ideas so
again cuban missile crisis uh

10650
02:58:35,110 --> 02:58:35,120
again cuban missile crisis uh
 

10651
02:58:35,120 --> 02:58:37,030
again cuban missile crisis uh
mass hysteria in the united states about

10652
02:58:37,030 --> 02:58:37,040
mass hysteria in the united states about
 

10653
02:58:37,040 --> 02:58:39,830
mass hysteria in the united states about
nuclear war from cuba missiles blowing

10654
02:58:39,830 --> 02:58:39,840
nuclear war from cuba missiles blowing
 

10655
02:58:39,840 --> 02:58:41,670
nuclear war from cuba missiles blowing
up american cities faster than we could

10656
02:58:41,670 --> 02:58:41,680
up american cities faster than we could
 

10657
02:58:41,680 --> 02:58:43,750
up american cities faster than we could
even see them coming it makes sense to

10658
02:58:43,750 --> 02:58:43,760
even see them coming it makes sense to
 

10659
02:58:43,760 --> 02:58:45,910
even see them coming it makes sense to
me that a president would go to

10660
02:58:45,910 --> 02:58:45,920
me that a president would go to
 

10661
02:58:45,920 --> 02:58:49,910
me that a president would go to
especially the part of cia which is the

10662
02:58:49,910 --> 02:58:49,920
especially the part of cia which is the
 

10663
02:58:49,920 --> 02:58:51,510
especially the part of cia which is the
special activities division it makes

10664
02:58:51,510 --> 02:58:51,520
special activities division it makes
 

10665
02:58:51,520 --> 02:58:52,790
special activities division it makes
perfect sense to me that the president

10666
02:58:52,790 --> 02:58:52,800
perfect sense to me that the president
 

10667
02:58:52,800 --> 02:58:54,550
perfect sense to me that the president
would go to a division called special

10668
02:58:54,550 --> 02:58:54,560
would go to a division called special
 

10669
02:58:54,560 --> 02:58:57,269
would go to a division called special
activities whose job it is to create

10670
02:58:57,269 --> 02:58:57,279
activities whose job it is to create
 

10671
02:58:57,279 --> 02:58:58,230
activities whose job it is to create
you know

10672
02:58:58,230 --> 02:58:58,240
you know
 

10673
02:58:58,240 --> 02:59:01,429
you know
crazy ideas that have presidential uh

10674
02:59:01,429 --> 02:59:01,439
crazy ideas that have presidential uh
 

10675
02:59:01,439 --> 02:59:04,389
crazy ideas that have presidential uh
approval but nobody knows they exist

10676
02:59:04,389 --> 02:59:04,399
approval but nobody knows they exist
 

10677
02:59:04,399 --> 02:59:05,510
approval but nobody knows they exist
so it makes sense that he would

10678
02:59:05,510 --> 02:59:05,520
so it makes sense that he would
 

10679
02:59:05,520 --> 02:59:07,349
so it makes sense that he would
challenge a group like that to come up

10680
02:59:07,349 --> 02:59:07,359
challenge a group like that to come up
 

10681
02:59:07,359 --> 02:59:09,510
challenge a group like that to come up
with any wacky idea right come up with

10682
02:59:09,510 --> 02:59:09,520
with any wacky idea right come up with
 

10683
02:59:09,520 --> 02:59:11,190
with any wacky idea right come up with
anything just let's start with something

10684
02:59:11,190 --> 02:59:11,200
anything just let's start with something
 

10685
02:59:11,200 --> 02:59:12,389
anything just let's start with something
because we can't have we can't bring

10686
02:59:12,389 --> 02:59:12,399
because we can't have we can't bring
 

10687
02:59:12,399 --> 02:59:14,070
because we can't have we can't bring
nothing to the table we have to do

10688
02:59:14,070 --> 02:59:14,080
nothing to the table we have to do
 

10689
02:59:14,080 --> 02:59:15,750
nothing to the table we have to do
something about this cuban issue and

10690
02:59:15,750 --> 02:59:15,760
something about this cuban issue and
 

10691
02:59:15,760 --> 02:59:17,590
something about this cuban issue and
then that's how an operation like that

10692
02:59:17,590 --> 02:59:17,600
then that's how an operation like that
 

10693
02:59:17,600 --> 02:59:19,429
then that's how an operation like that
could reasonably be born not because

10694
02:59:19,429 --> 02:59:19,439
could reasonably be born not because
 

10695
02:59:19,439 --> 02:59:21,190
could reasonably be born not because
anybody wants to do it but because they

10696
02:59:21,190 --> 02:59:21,200
anybody wants to do it but because they
 

10697
02:59:21,200 --> 02:59:22,710
anybody wants to do it but because they
were tasked by the president to come up

10698

do you think

10772
03:00:40,870 --> 03:00:40,880

the cia had a hand in the assassination

10774
03:00:43,910 --> 03:00:43,920
the cia had a hand in the assassination
 

10775
03:00:43,920 --> 03:00:45,590
the cia had a hand in the assassination
of jfk

10776
03:00:45,590 --> 03:00:45,600
of jfk
 

10777
03:00:45,600 --> 03:00:48,230
of jfk
i cannot imagine

10778
03:00:48,230 --> 03:00:48,240
i cannot imagine
 

10779
03:00:48,240 --> 03:00:51,349
i cannot imagine
in any reasonable point of view that the

10780
03:00:51,349 --> 03:00:51,359
in any reasonable point of view that the
 

10781
03:00:51,359 --> 03:00:53,429
in any reasonable point of view that the
organization of cia had anything to do

10783
03:00:53,439 --> 03:00:55,269
organization of cia had anything to do
with the assassination of jfk so it's

10784
03:00:55,269 --> 03:00:55,279
with the assassination of jfk so it's
 

10785
03:00:55,279 --> 03:00:59,269
with the assassination of jfk so it's
not a possible to infiltrate the cia

10786
03:00:59,269 --> 03:00:59,279
not a possible to infiltrate the cia
 

10787
03:00:59,279 --> 03:01:03,670
not a possible to infiltrate the cia
a small part of the city in order to

03:01:03,670 --> 03:01:03,680
a small part of the city in order to
 

10789
03:01:03,680 --> 03:01:07,429
a small part of the city in order to

10793
03:01:09,200 --> 03:01:11,910
uh gains
i think financial yeah absolutely it's

10794
03:01:11,910 --> 03:01:11,920
i think financial yeah absolutely it's
 

10795
03:01:11,920 --> 03:01:14,150
i think financial yeah absolutely it's
possible to infiltrate cia there's a

10796
03:01:14,150 --> 03:01:14,160
possible to infiltrate cia there's a
 

10797
03:01:14,160 --> 03:01:15,750
possible to infiltrate cia there's a
long history of

10798
03:01:15,750 --> 03:01:15,760
long history of
 

10799
03:01:15,760 --> 03:01:17,590
long history of
of foreign intelligence services

10800
03:01:17,590 --> 03:01:17,600
of foreign intelligence services
 

10801
03:01:17,600 --> 03:01:21,349
of foreign intelligence services
infiltrating cia from aldrich ames to

10802
03:01:21,349 --> 03:01:21,359
infiltrating cia from aldrich ames to
 

10803
03:01:21,359 --> 03:01:23,349
infiltrating cia from aldrich ames to
jerry lee recently with china

10804
03:01:23,349 --> 03:01:23,359
jerry lee recently with china
 

10805
03:01:23,359 --> 03:01:27,349
jerry lee recently with china
so we know cia can be infiltrated

10806
03:01:27,349 --> 03:01:27,359
so we know cia can be infiltrated
 

10807
03:01:27,359 --> 03:01:29,510
so we know cia can be infiltrated
even if they are infiltrated and even if

10808
03:01:29,510 --> 03:01:29,520
even if they are infiltrated and even if
 

10809
03:01:29,520 --> 03:01:31,670
even if they are infiltrated and even if
that interlocutor

10810
03:01:31,670 --> 03:01:31,680
that interlocutor
 

10811
03:01:31,680 --> 03:01:33,750
that interlocutor
executes on

10812
03:01:33,750 --> 03:01:33,760
executes on
 

10813
03:01:33,760 --> 03:01:36,950
executes on
their own agenda or their the agenda as

10814
03:01:36,950 --> 03:01:36,960
their own agenda or their the agenda as
 

10815
03:01:36,960 --> 03:01:39,269
their own agenda or their the agenda as
directed by their foreign adversary

10816
03:01:39,269 --> 03:01:39,279
directed by their foreign adversary
 

10817
03:01:39,279 --> 03:01:40,870
directed by their foreign adversary
their foreign handler

10818
03:01:40,870 --> 03:01:40,880
their foreign handler
 

10819
03:01:40,880 --> 03:01:42,230
their foreign handler
that's different than organizational

10820
03:01:42,230 --> 03:01:42,240
that's different than organizational
 

10821
03:01:42,240 --> 03:01:45,030
that's different than organizational
support for an event

10822
03:01:45,030 --> 03:01:45,040
support for an event
 

10823
03:01:45,040 --> 03:01:46,870
support for an event
so i do

10824
03:01:46,870 --> 03:01:46,880
so i do
 

10825
03:01:46,880 --> 03:01:48,070
so i do
think it's possible they could have been

10826
03:01:48,070 --> 03:01:48,080
think it's possible they could have been
 

10827
03:01:48,080 --> 03:01:49,830
think it's possible they could have been
infiltrated at the time especially it

10828
03:01:49,830 --> 03:01:49,840
infiltrated at the time especially it
 

10829
03:01:49,840 --> 03:01:51,269
infiltrated at the time especially it
was a massive

10830
03:01:51,269 --> 03:01:51,279
was a massive

you know occam's razor so the harem's
 

11089
03:06:25,200 --> 03:06:28,230
you know occam's razor so the harem's
razor is that you can never prescribe to

11090

03:06:29,760 --> 03:06:31,510
conspiracy
what could be explained through

11094
03:06:31,510 --> 03:06:31,520
what could be explained through
 

11095
03:06:31,520 --> 03:06:34,469
what could be explained through
incompetence yeah right that is one of

11096
03:06:34,469 --> 03:06:34,479
incompetence yeah right that is one of
 

11097
03:06:34,479 --> 03:06:37,190
incompetence yeah right that is one of
those are two two fundamental guidelines

11098
03:06:37,190 --> 03:06:37,200
those are two two fundamental guidelines
 

11099
03:06:37,200 --> 03:06:38,790
those are two two fundamental guidelines
that we follow all the time right the

11100
03:06:38,790 --> 03:06:38,800
that we follow all the time right the
 

11101
03:06:38,800 --> 03:06:40,550
that we follow all the time right the
simplest answer is oftentimes the best

11102
03:06:40,550 --> 03:06:40,560
simplest answer is oftentimes the best
 

11103
03:06:40,560 --> 03:06:43,190
simplest answer is oftentimes the best
and never prescribe to conspiracy what

11104
03:06:43,190 --> 03:06:43,200
and never prescribe to conspiracy what
 

11105
03:06:43,200 --> 03:06:44,630
and never prescribe to conspiracy what
can be explained through incompetence

11106
03:06:44,630 --> 03:06:44,640
can be explained through incompetence
 

11107
03:06:44,640 --> 03:06:45,990
can be explained through incompetence
can you can you elaborate what you mean

11108
03:06:45,990 --> 03:06:46,000
can you can you elaborate what you mean
 

11109
03:06:46,000 --> 03:06:47,429
can you can you elaborate what you mean
by we

11110
03:06:47,429 --> 03:06:47,439
by we
 

11111
03:06:47,439 --> 03:06:49,429
by we
we as beings as intelligence

11112
03:06:49,429 --> 03:06:49,439
we as beings as intelligence
 

11113
03:06:49,439 --> 03:06:50,710
we as beings as intelligence
professionals

11114
03:06:50,710 --> 03:06:50,720
professionals
 

11115
03:06:50,720 --> 03:06:53,510
professionals
so you see there's a deep truth to that

11116
03:06:53,510 --> 03:06:53,520
so you see there's a deep truth to that
 

11117
03:06:53,520 --> 03:06:56,469
so you see there's a deep truth to that
uh that second razor there is

11118
03:06:56,469 --> 03:06:56,479
uh that second razor there is
 

11119
03:06:56,479 --> 03:06:58,630
uh that second razor there is
more than a deep truth there is

11120
03:06:58,630 --> 03:06:58,640
more than a deep truth there is
 

11121
03:06:58,640 --> 03:07:01,030
more than a deep truth there is
there's ages of experience for me and

11122
03:07:01,030 --> 03:07:01,040
there's ages of experience for me and
 

11123
03:07:01,040 --> 03:07:03,429
there's ages of experience for me and
for others so in general people are

11124
03:07:03,429 --> 03:07:03,439
for others so in general people are
 

11125
03:07:03,439 --> 03:07:06,070
for others so in general people are
incompetent if left to their own

11126
03:07:06,070 --> 03:07:06,080
incompetent if left to their own
 

11127
03:07:06,080 --> 03:07:07,830
incompetent if left to their own
means they they're they're more

11128
03:07:07,830 --> 03:07:07,840
means they they're they're more
 

11129
03:07:07,840 --> 03:07:09,030
means they they're they're more
incompetent

then they are malevolent

11132
03:07:11,030 --> 03:07:11,040
then they are malevolent
 

11133

then they are malevolent
at a large organizational scale uh

11134
03:07:13,670 --> 03:07:13,680
at a large organizational scale uh
 

11135
03:07:13,680 --> 03:07:16,309
at a large organizational scale uh
people are more incompetent of executing

epstein created
 

11487
03:13:18,000 --> 03:13:20,630
epstein created
or once he's achieved and built his

11488
03:13:20,630 --> 03:13:20,640
or once he's achieved and built his
 

11489
03:13:20,640 --> 03:13:23,590
or once he's achieved and built his
network was he then infiltrated and

11490
03:13:23,590 --> 03:13:23,600
network was he then infiltrated and
 

11491
03:13:23,600 --> 03:13:24,870
network was he then infiltrated and
that's a really

11492
03:13:24,870 --> 03:13:24,880
that's a really
 

11493
03:13:24,880 --> 03:13:25,750
that's a really
sort of

11494
03:13:25,750 --> 03:13:25,760
sort of
 

11495
03:13:25,760 --> 03:13:28,070
sort of
important difference like at which stage

11496
03:13:28,070 --> 03:13:28,080
important difference like at which stage
 

11497
03:13:28,080 --> 03:13:29,590
important difference like at which stage
do you connect a person like that you

11498

do you connect a person like that you
 

11499
03:13:29,600 --> 03:13:32,150
do you connect a person like that you
start to notice maybe they're effective

11500

start to notice maybe they're effective
 

11501
03:13:32,160 --> 03:13:34,790
start to notice maybe they're effective
at building a network and then you start

11502
03:13:34,790 --> 03:13:34,800
at building a network and then you start
 

11503
03:13:34,800 --> 03:13:37,349
at building a network and then you start
making uh building a relationship to

11504
03:13:37,349 --> 03:13:37,359
making uh building a relationship to
 

11505
03:13:37,359 --> 03:13:39,670
making uh building a relationship to
where at some point they're it's a job

11506
03:13:39,670 --> 03:13:39,680
where at some point they're it's a job
 

11507
03:13:39,680 --> 03:13:41,750
where at some point they're it's a job
they're working for you or do you

11508
03:13:41,750 --> 03:13:41,760
they're working for you or do you
 

11509
03:13:41,760 --> 03:13:44,070
they're working for you or do you
literally create a person like that yeah

11510
03:13:44,070 --> 03:13:44,080
literally create a person like that yeah
 

11511
03:13:44,080 --> 03:13:45,750

so intelligence organizations have

11512
03:13:45,750 --> 03:13:45,760
so intelligence organizations have
 

11513
03:13:45,760 --> 03:13:47,590
so intelligence organizations have
different strategies here in the united

11514
03:13:47,590 --> 03:13:47,600
different strategies here in the united
 

11515
03:13:47,600 --> 03:13:49,670
different strategies here in the united
states we never create

11516
03:13:49,670 --> 03:13:49,680
states we never create
 

11517
03:13:49,680 --> 03:13:51,990

we don't have a budget cycle that allows
 

11519

us to create
 

11521
03:13:53,200 --> 03:13:55,269
us to create
i mean the maximum budget cycle in the

11522
03:13:55,269 --> 03:13:55,279
i mean the maximum budget cycle in the
 

11523
03:13:55,279 --> 03:13:57,030
i mean the maximum budget cycle in the
united states is five years

11524

united states is five years
 

11525
03:13:57,040 --> 03:13:58,870
united states is five years
so even if we were to try to invest in

11526
03:13:58,870 --> 03:13:58,880
so even if we were to try to invest in
 

11527
03:13:58,880 --> 03:14:01,750
so even if we were to try to invest in
some c operation or create some

character of influence essentially every
year you have to justify why you're

11532
03:14:06,389 --> 03:14:06,399
year you have to justify why you're
 

11533
03:14:06,399 --> 03:14:08,229
year you have to justify why you're
spending budget and that becomes very

11534
03:14:08,229 --> 03:14:08,239
spending budget and that becomes very
 

11535
03:14:08,239 --> 03:14:09,990
spending budget and that becomes very
difficult in a democracy like ours

03:15:50,880 --> 03:15:54,630
in my experience at cia that is
an area that remains very compartmented

11630
03:15:54,630 --> 03:15:54,640
an area that remains very compartmented
 

11631
03:15:54,640 --> 03:15:56,710
an area that remains very compartmented
and that could be

11632
03:15:56,710 --> 03:15:56,720
and that could be
 

11633
03:15:56,720 --> 03:15:58,229
and that could be
one of two reasons it could be because

11634
03:15:58,229 --> 03:15:58,239
one of two reasons it could be because
 

11635
03:15:58,239 --> 03:15:59,670
one of two reasons it could be because
there is significant interest and that's

11636
03:15:59,670 --> 03:15:59,680
there is significant interest and that's
 

11637
03:15:59,680 --> 03:16:02,070
there is significant interest and that's
why it's so heavily compartmented or it

11638
03:16:02,070 --> 03:16:02,080
why it's so heavily compartmented or it
 

11639
03:16:02,080 --> 03:16:03,910
why it's so heavily compartmented or it
could be because it's an area

11640
03:16:03,910 --> 03:16:03,920
could be because it's an area
 

11641
03:16:03,920 --> 03:16:04,830
could be because it's an area
that's

11642
03:16:04,830 --> 03:16:04,840
that's
 

11643
03:16:04,840 --> 03:16:07,429
that's
non-it's just not important it's a it's

11644
03:16:07,429 --> 03:16:07,439
non-it's just not important it's a it's
 

11645
03:16:07,439 --> 03:16:09,510
non-it's just not important it's a it's
a distraction so they compartment it so

11646
03:16:09,510 --> 03:16:09,520
a distraction so they compartment it so
 

11647
03:16:09,520 --> 03:16:10,710
a distraction so they compartment it so
it doesn't

11648
03:16:10,710 --> 03:16:10,720
it doesn't
 

11649
03:16:10,720 --> 03:16:13,429
it doesn't
distract from other operations

11650
03:16:13,429 --> 03:16:13,439
distract from other operations
 

11651
03:16:13,439 --> 03:16:15,349
distract from other operations
one of the areas that i've

11652
03:16:15,349 --> 03:16:15,359
one of the areas that i've
 

11653
03:16:15,359 --> 03:16:16,630
one of the areas that i've
been

11654
03:16:16,630 --> 03:16:16,640
been
 

11655
03:16:16,640 --> 03:16:18,229
been
quite interested in and where i've done

11656
03:16:18,229 --> 03:16:18,239
quite interested in and where i've done
 

11657
03:16:18,239 --> 03:16:19,510
quite interested in and where i've done
a lot of research and i've done some

11658
03:16:19,510 --> 03:16:19,520
a lot of research and i've done some
 

11659
03:16:19,520 --> 03:16:20,790
a lot of research and i've done some
work in the private intelligence and

11660
03:16:20,790 --> 03:16:20,800
work in the private intelligence and
 

11661
03:16:20,800 --> 03:16:24,870
work in the private intelligence and
private investigation side is with ufos

11662
03:16:24,870 --> 03:16:24,880
private investigation side is with ufos
 

11663
03:16:24,880 --> 03:16:27,590
private investigation side is with ufos
the place where ufos really connect with

11664
03:16:27,590 --> 03:16:27,600
the place where ufos really connect with
 

11665
03:16:27,600 --> 03:16:29,110
the place where ufos really connect with
the federal government is when it comes

11666
03:16:29,110 --> 03:16:29,120
the federal government is when it comes
 

11667
03:16:29,120 --> 03:16:30,950
the federal government is when it comes
to aviation safety

11668
03:16:30,950 --> 03:16:30,960
to aviation safety
 

11669
03:16:30,960 --> 03:16:33,190
to aviation safety
and predominance of power

11670
03:16:33,190 --> 03:16:33,200
and predominance of power
 

11671
03:16:33,200 --> 03:16:33,910
and predominance of power
so

11672
03:16:33,910 --> 03:16:33,920
so
 

11673
03:16:33,920 --> 03:16:36,229
so
faa and the us air force and the us

11674
03:16:36,229 --> 03:16:36,239
faa and the us air force and the us
 

11675
03:16:36,239 --> 03:16:38,229
faa and the us air force and the us
military are very invested in knowing

11676
03:16:38,229 --> 03:16:38,239
military are very invested in knowing
 

11677
03:16:38,239 --> 03:16:39,590
military are very invested in knowing
what's happening in the skies above the

11678
03:16:39,590 --> 03:16:39,600
what's happening in the skies above the
 

11679
03:16:39,600 --> 03:16:40,870
what's happening in the skies above the
united states

11680
03:16:40,870 --> 03:16:40,880
united states
 

11681
03:16:40,880 --> 03:16:43,429
united states
and that's of primary interest to them

11682
03:16:43,429 --> 03:16:43,439
and that's of primary interest to them
 

11683
03:16:43,439 --> 03:16:45,190
and that's of primary interest to them
when they can rule out

11684
03:16:45,190 --> 03:16:45,200
when they can rule out
 

11685
03:16:45,200 --> 03:16:46,950
when they can rule out
the direct threat to national security

11686
03:16:46,950 --> 03:16:46,960
the direct threat to national security
 

11687
03:16:46,960 --> 03:16:50,150
the direct threat to national security
of ufos then they become less interested

11688
03:16:50,150 --> 03:16:50,160
of ufos then they become less interested
 

11689
03:16:50,160 --> 03:16:51,349
of ufos then they become less interested
that said

11690
03:16:51,349 --> 03:16:51,359
that said
 

11691
03:16:51,359 --> 03:16:53,110
that said
when you have unexplained aerial

11692
03:16:53,110 --> 03:16:53,120
when you have unexplained aerial
 

11693
03:16:53,120 --> 03:16:54,309
when you have unexplained aerial
phenomenon

11694
03:16:54,309 --> 03:16:54,319
phenomenon
 

11695
03:16:54,319 --> 03:16:56,309
phenomenon
that are unexplained

03:16:56,309 --> 03:16:56,319
that are unexplained
 

11697
03:16:56,319 --> 03:16:57,429
that are unexplained
that

that
 

11699
03:16:57,439 --> 03:16:59,590
that
can't directly be tied to

03:16:59,590 --> 03:16:59,600
can't directly be tied to
 

11701
03:16:59,600 --> 03:17:02,150
can't directly be tied to
uh to anything that is known of the

terrestrial world
 

11705
03:17:04,239 --> 03:17:06,070
terrestrial world
then they they're left

11706
03:17:06,070 --> 03:17:06,080
then they they're left
 

11707
03:17:06,080 --> 03:17:07,910
then they they're left
without an answer to their question they

11708
03:17:07,910 --> 03:17:07,920
without an answer to their question they
 

11709
03:17:07,920 --> 03:17:09,510
without an answer to their question they
don't know if it's a threat or not a

11710
03:17:09,510 --> 03:17:09,520
don't know if it's a threat or not a
 

11711
03:17:09,520 --> 03:17:10,469
don't know if it's a threat or not a
threat

11712
03:17:10,469 --> 03:17:10,479
threat
 

11713
03:17:10,479 --> 03:17:12,630
threat
but i think the scarier concern for the

11714
03:17:12,630 --> 03:17:12,640
but i think the scarier concern for the
 

11715
03:17:12,640 --> 03:17:14,229
but i think the scarier concern for the
u.s national government or for the u.s

11716
03:17:14,229 --> 03:17:14,239
u.s national government or for the u.s
 

11717
03:17:14,239 --> 03:17:15,910
u.s national government or for the u.s
federal government the scarier concern

11718
03:17:15,910 --> 03:17:15,920
federal government the scarier concern
 

11719
03:17:15,920 --> 03:17:17,670
federal government the scarier concern
that nobody talks about is what if the

11720
03:17:17,670 --> 03:17:17,680
that nobody talks about is what if the
 

11721
03:17:17,680 --> 03:17:21,830
that nobody talks about is what if the
ufo isn't alien what if it is actually

11722
03:17:21,830 --> 03:17:21,840
ufo isn't alien what if it is actually
 

11723

being able to replicate or

being able to replicate or
 

11731
03:17:30,479 --> 03:17:33,269
being able to replicate or
the other concern is that it's a

03:17:33,269 --> 03:17:33,279
the other concern is that it's a
 

11733
03:17:33,279 --> 03:17:35,670
the other concern is that it's a
it's a system it's a machine from a

11734
03:17:35,670 --> 03:17:35,680
it's a system it's a machine from a
 

11735
03:17:35,680 --> 03:17:37,750
it's a system it's a machine from a
foreign power that's doing intelligence

11736
03:17:37,750 --> 03:17:37,760
foreign power that's doing intelligence
 

11737
03:17:37,760 --> 03:17:40,070
foreign power that's doing intelligence
collection correct so it's not just

11738
03:17:40,070 --> 03:17:40,080
collection correct so it's not just
 

11739
03:17:40,080 --> 03:17:42,469
collection correct so it's not just
military purposes it's actually

11740
03:17:42,469 --> 03:17:42,479
military purposes it's actually
 

11741
03:17:42,479 --> 03:17:44,950
military purposes it's actually
collecting data well they fall

11742
03:17:44,950 --> 03:17:44,960
collecting data well they fall
 

11743
03:17:44,960 --> 03:17:46,070
collecting data well they fall
a lot of times the federal government

11744
03:17:46,070 --> 03:17:46,080
a lot of times the federal government
 

11745
03:17:46,080 --> 03:17:47,429
a lot of times the federal government
will see the two is the same it's a

11746
03:17:47,429 --> 03:17:47,439
will see the two is the same it's a
 

11747
03:17:47,439 --> 03:17:48,469
will see the two is the same it's a
hostile

11748
03:17:48,469 --> 03:17:48,479
hostile
 

11749
03:17:48,479 --> 03:17:51,110
hostile
tool from a foreign collection of

11750
03:17:51,110 --> 03:17:51,120
tool from a foreign collection of
 

11751
03:17:51,120 --> 03:17:54,229
tool from a foreign collection of
information is a hostile act absolutely

11752
03:17:54,229 --> 03:17:54,239
information is a hostile act absolutely
 

11753
03:17:54,239 --> 03:17:56,389
information is a hostile act absolutely
that's why the espionage act exists

11754
03:17:56,389 --> 03:17:56,399
that's why the espionage act exists
 

11755
03:17:56,399 --> 03:17:58,150
that's why the espionage act exists
that's why it's a criminal offense if

11756
03:17:58,150 --> 03:17:58,160
that's why it's a criminal offense if
 

11757
03:17:58,160 --> 03:17:59,269
that's why it's a criminal offense if
you're committing espionage in the

11758
03:17:59,269 --> 03:17:59,279
you're committing espionage in the
 

11759
03:17:59,279 --> 03:18:01,670
you're committing espionage in the
united states as a u.s citizen or a

11760
03:18:01,670 --> 03:18:01,680
united states as a u.s citizen or a
 

11761
03:18:01,680 --> 03:18:03,190
united states as a u.s citizen or a
foreign citizen

11762
03:18:03,190 --> 03:18:03,200
foreign citizen
 

11763
03:18:03,200 --> 03:18:04,950
foreign citizen
so i guess they keep digging until they

11764
03:18:04,950 --> 03:18:04,960
so i guess they keep digging until they
 

11765
03:18:04,960 --> 03:18:07,670
so i guess they keep digging until they
can confirm it's not a threat but it

11766
03:18:07,670 --> 03:18:07,680
can confirm it's not a threat but it
 

11767
03:18:07,680 --> 03:18:10,070
can confirm it's not a threat but it
just um and you're saying that there's

11768
03:18:10,070 --> 03:18:10,080
just um and you're saying that there's
 

11769
03:18:10,080 --> 03:18:12,070
just um and you're saying that there's
not from you understanding much evidence

11770
03:18:12,070 --> 03:18:12,080
not from you understanding much evidence
 

11771
03:18:12,080 --> 03:18:13,910
not from you understanding much evidence
that they're doing so it could be

11772
03:18:13,910 --> 03:18:13,920
that they're doing so it could be
 

11773
03:18:13,920 --> 03:18:15,229
that they're doing so it could be
because they're

11774
03:18:15,229 --> 03:18:15,239
because they're
 

11775
03:18:15,239 --> 03:18:16,870
because they're
compartmentalized

11776
03:18:16,870 --> 03:18:16,880
compartmentalized
 

11777
03:18:16,880 --> 03:18:20,630
compartmentalized
but you're saying private intelligence

11778
03:18:20,630 --> 03:18:20,640
but you're saying private intelligence
 

11779
03:18:20,640 --> 03:18:22,389
but you're saying private intelligence
institutions are

11780
03:18:22,389 --> 03:18:22,399
institutions are
 

11781
03:18:22,399 --> 03:18:25,429
institutions are
trying to to make progress on this

11782
03:18:25,429 --> 03:18:25,439
trying to to make progress on this
 

11783
03:18:25,439 --> 03:18:28,469
trying to to make progress on this
yeah it's really difficult to know uh

11784
03:18:28,469 --> 03:18:28,479
yeah it's really difficult to know uh
 

11785
03:18:28,479 --> 03:18:30,070
yeah it's really difficult to know uh
there's a vested yeah there's an

11786
03:18:30,070 --> 03:18:30,080
there's a vested yeah there's an
 

11787
03:18:30,080 --> 03:18:32,309
there's a vested yeah there's an
economic interest in the private invest

11788
03:18:32,309 --> 03:18:32,319
economic interest in the private invest
 

11789
03:18:32,319 --> 03:18:33,750
economic interest in the private invest
in the private intelligence world

11790
03:18:33,750 --> 03:18:33,760
in the private intelligence world
 

11791
03:18:33,760 --> 03:18:35,910
in the private intelligence world
because for example if you understand

11792
03:18:35,910 --> 03:18:35,920
because for example if you understand
 

11793
03:18:35,920 --> 03:18:37,670
because for example if you understand
why certain aerial phenomena are

11794
03:18:37,670 --> 03:18:37,680
why certain aerial phenomena are
 

11795
03:18:37,680 --> 03:18:39,910
why certain aerial phenomena are
happening over a location

11796
03:18:39,910 --> 03:18:39,920
happening over a location
 

11797
03:18:39,920 --> 03:18:40,790
happening over a location
then

11798
03:18:40,790 --> 03:18:40,800
then
 

11799
03:18:40,800 --> 03:18:43,190
then
you can use that to inform investors

11800
03:18:43,190 --> 03:18:43,200
you can use that to inform investors
 

11801
03:18:43,200 --> 03:18:45,110
you can use that to inform investors
whether to invest in that location or

11802
03:18:45,110 --> 03:18:45,120
whether to invest in that location or
 

11803
03:18:45,120 --> 03:18:46,950
whether to invest in that location or
avoid investment in that location but

11804
03:18:46,950 --> 03:18:46,960
avoid investment in that location but
 

11805
03:18:46,960 --> 03:18:48,469
avoid investment in that location but
that's not a national security concern

11806
03:18:48,469 --> 03:18:48,479
that's not a national security concern
 

11807
03:18:48,479 --> 03:18:50,550
that's not a national security concern
so that doesn't it doesn't matter to the

11808
03:18:50,550 --> 03:18:50,560
so that doesn't it doesn't matter to the
 

11809
03:18:50,560 --> 03:18:52,389
so that doesn't it doesn't matter to the
federal government

11810
03:18:52,389 --> 03:18:52,399
federal government
 

11811
03:18:52,399 --> 03:18:55,030
federal government
could these ufos be aliens now i'm going

could these ufos be aliens now i'm going
 

11813
03:18:55,040 --> 03:18:57,190
could these ufos be aliens now i'm going
into territory of you as a human being

11814
03:18:57,190 --> 03:18:57,200
into territory of you as a human being
 

11815
03:18:57,200 --> 03:18:59,190
into territory of you as a human being
wondering about all the alien

11816
03:18:59,190 --> 03:18:59,200
wondering about all the alien
 

11817
03:18:59,200 --> 03:19:01,429
wondering about all the alien

03:19:08,880 --> 03:19:11,349
an improbability
that we are alone if by virtue of the

that we are alone if by virtue of the

simply speak over the galaxies that

to think that

they become observed

they become observed
 

11881
03:20:03,760 --> 03:20:06,229
they become observed
is uh it's just silly it's the world of

11882
03:20:06,229 --> 03:20:06,239
is uh it's just silly it's the world of
 

11883
03:20:06,239 --> 03:20:07,910
is uh it's just silly it's the world of
sci-fi well

11884
03:20:07,910 --> 03:20:07,920
sci-fi well
 

11885
03:20:07,920 --> 03:20:09,670
sci-fi well
every good scientist

11886
03:20:09,670 --> 03:20:09,680
every good scientist
 

11887
03:20:09,680 --> 03:20:10,950
every good scientist
because we always assume that they're

11888
03:20:10,950 --> 03:20:10,960
because we always assume that they're
 

11889
03:20:10,960 --> 03:20:13,830
because we always assume that they're
superior to us and intelligence yes when

11890
03:20:13,830 --> 03:20:13,840
superior to us and intelligence yes when
 

11891
03:20:13,840 --> 03:20:16,309
superior to us and intelligence yes when
any scientist carries out an experiment

11892
03:20:16,309 --> 03:20:16,319
any scientist carries out an experiment
 

11893
03:20:16,319 --> 03:20:18,229
any scientist carries out an experiment
the whole objective of the experiment is

11894
03:20:18,229 --> 03:20:18,239
the whole objective of the experiment is
 

11895
03:20:18,239 --> 03:20:21,429
the whole objective of the experiment is
to observe without

11896
03:20:21,429 --> 03:20:21,439
to observe without
 

11897
03:20:21,439 --> 03:20:23,269
to observe without
being disclosed or being discovered yeah

11898
03:20:23,269 --> 03:20:23,279
being disclosed or being discovered yeah
 

11899
03:20:23,279 --> 03:20:24,550
being disclosed or being discovered yeah
so why on earth would we think that the

11900
03:20:24,550 --> 03:20:24,560
so why on earth would we think that the
 

11901
03:20:24,560 --> 03:20:27,030
so why on earth would we think that the
superior species makes the mistake of

11902
03:20:27,030 --> 03:20:27,040
superior species makes the mistake of
 

11903
03:20:27,040 --> 03:20:30,950
superior species makes the mistake of
being discovered over and over again

11904
03:20:30,950 --> 03:20:30,960

 

11905
03:20:30,960 --> 03:20:32,950

so to push back on that idea if we were

11906
03:20:32,950 --> 03:20:32,960
so to push back on that idea if we were
 

11907
03:20:32,960 --> 03:20:34,950
so to push back on that idea if we were
to think about us humans trying to

11908
03:20:34,950 --> 03:20:34,960
to think about us humans trying to
 

11909
03:20:34,960 --> 03:20:37,670
to think about us humans trying to
communicate with ants

11910
03:20:37,670 --> 03:20:37,680
communicate with ants
 

11911
03:20:37,680 --> 03:20:39,670
communicate with ants
first we observe for a while there'll be

11912
03:20:39,670 --> 03:20:39,680
first we observe for a while there'll be
 

11913
03:20:39,680 --> 03:20:42,309
first we observe for a while there'll be
a bunch of phds written a bunch of

11914
03:20:42,309 --> 03:20:42,319
a bunch of phds written a bunch of
 

11915
03:20:42,319 --> 03:20:44,950
a bunch of phds written a bunch of
people just uh sort of collecting data

11916
03:20:44,950 --> 03:20:44,960
people just uh sort of collecting data
 

11917
03:20:44,960 --> 03:20:46,870
people just uh sort of collecting data
taking notes trying to understand about

11918
03:20:46,870 --> 03:20:46,880
taking notes trying to understand about
 

11919
03:20:46,880 --> 03:20:47,590
taking notes trying to understand about
this

11920
03:20:47,590 --> 03:20:47,600
this
 

11921
03:20:47,600 --> 03:20:50,070
this
thing that you detected that seems to be

11922
03:20:50,070 --> 03:20:50,080
thing that you detected that seems to be
 

11923
03:20:50,080 --> 03:20:51,670
thing that you detected that seems to be
a living thing which is a very difficult

11924
03:20:51,670 --> 03:20:51,680
a living thing which is a very difficult
 

11925
03:20:51,680 --> 03:20:53,030
a living thing which is a very difficult
thing to define from an alien

11926
03:20:53,030 --> 03:20:53,040
thing to define from an alien
 

11927
03:20:53,040 --> 03:20:55,269
thing to define from an alien
perspective or from our perspective we

11928
03:20:55,269 --> 03:20:55,279
perspective or from our perspective we
 

11929
03:20:55,279 --> 03:20:57,429
perspective or from our perspective we
find life on mars or something like that

11930
03:20:57,429 --> 03:20:57,439
find life on mars or something like that
 

11931
03:20:57,439 --> 03:20:59,590
find life on mars or something like that
okay so you observe for a while

11932
03:20:59,590 --> 03:20:59,600
okay so you observe for a while
 

11933
03:20:59,600 --> 03:21:01,110
okay so you observe for a while
but then if you want to actually

11934
03:21:01,110 --> 03:21:01,120
but then if you want to actually
 

11935
03:21:01,120 --> 03:21:03,110
but then if you want to actually
interact with it how would you interact

11936
03:21:03,110 --> 03:21:03,120
interact with it how would you interact
 

11937
03:21:03,120 --> 03:21:04,389
interact with it how would you interact
with the ants

11938
03:21:04,389 --> 03:21:04,399
with the ants
 

11939
03:21:04,399 --> 03:21:06,870
with the ants
if i were to interact with the ants i

11940
03:21:06,870 --> 03:21:06,880
if i were to interact with the ants i
 

11941
03:21:06,880 --> 03:21:10,469
if i were to interact with the ants i
would try to uh infiltrate

11942
03:21:10,469 --> 03:21:10,479
would try to uh infiltrate
 

11943
03:21:10,479 --> 03:21:12,790
would try to uh infiltrate
i would try to put like

11944
03:21:12,790 --> 03:21:12,800
i would try to put like
 

11945
03:21:12,800 --> 03:21:15,110
i would try to put like
figure out what is the language they

11946
03:21:15,110 --> 03:21:15,120
figure out what is the language they
 

11947
03:21:15,120 --> 03:21:17,349
figure out what is the language they
used to communicate with each other

11948
03:21:17,349 --> 03:21:17,359
used to communicate with each other
 

11949
03:21:17,359 --> 03:21:18,710
used to communicate with each other
uh i would

11950
03:21:18,710 --> 03:21:18,720
uh i would
 

11951
03:21:18,720 --> 03:21:21,750
uh i would
try to operate at their physical scale

11952
03:21:21,750 --> 03:21:21,760
try to operate at their physical scale
 

11953
03:21:21,760 --> 03:21:23,830
try to operate at their physical scale
like uh in terms of the physics of their

11954
03:21:23,830 --> 03:21:23,840
like uh in terms of the physics of their
 

11955
03:21:23,840 --> 03:21:26,150
like uh in terms of the physics of their
interaction in terms of the

11956
03:21:26,150 --> 03:21:26,160
interaction in terms of the
 

11957
03:21:26,160 --> 03:21:28,469
interaction in terms of the
information methods mediums of

11958
03:21:28,469 --> 03:21:28,479
information methods mediums of
 

11959
03:21:28,479 --> 03:21:30,870
information methods mediums of
information exchange with pheromones or

11960
03:21:30,870 --> 03:21:30,880
information exchange with pheromones or
 

11961
03:21:30,880 --> 03:21:33,349
information exchange with pheromones or
whatever however the heck ants so i

11962
03:21:33,349 --> 03:21:33,359
whatever however the heck ants so i
 

11963
03:21:33,359 --> 03:21:35,990
whatever however the heck ants so i
would try to mimic them in some way so

11964
03:21:35,990 --> 03:21:36,000
would try to mimic them in some way so
 

11965
03:21:36,000 --> 03:21:38,389
would try to mimic them in some way so
in that sense it makes sense

11966
03:21:38,389 --> 03:21:38,399
in that sense it makes sense
 

11967
03:21:38,399 --> 03:21:39,830
in that sense it makes sense
that

11968
03:21:39,830 --> 03:21:39,840
that
 

11969
03:21:39,840 --> 03:21:41,190
that
um

11970
03:21:41,190 --> 03:21:41,200
um
 

11971
03:21:41,200 --> 03:21:43,349
um
the objects we would see

11972
03:21:43,349 --> 03:21:43,359
the objects we would see
 

11973
03:21:43,359 --> 03:21:45,190
the objects we would see
you mentioned bipedal yes of course it's

11974
03:21:45,190 --> 03:21:45,200
you mentioned bipedal yes of course it's
 

11975
03:21:45,200 --> 03:21:48,790
you mentioned bipedal yes of course it's
ridiculous that aliens would actually be

11976
03:21:48,790 --> 03:21:48,800
ridiculous that aliens would actually be
 

11977
03:21:48,800 --> 03:21:51,670
ridiculous that aliens would actually be
very similar to us but maybe they create

11978
03:21:51,670 --> 03:21:51,680
very similar to us but maybe they create
 

11979
03:21:51,680 --> 03:21:54,950
very similar to us but maybe they create
forms in order to be like

11980
03:21:54,950 --> 03:21:54,960
forms in order to be like
 

11981
03:21:54,960 --> 03:21:57,510
forms in order to be like
here uh the the the humans will

11982
03:21:57,510 --> 03:21:57,520
here uh the the the humans will
 

11983
03:21:57,520 --> 03:21:59,269
here uh the the the humans will
understand it and this needs to be

11984
03:21:59,269 --> 03:21:59,279
understand it and this needs to be
 

11985
03:21:59,279 --> 03:22:01,030
understand it and this needs to be
sufficiently different from humans to

11986
03:22:01,030 --> 03:22:01,040
sufficiently different from humans to
 

11987
03:22:01,040 --> 03:22:02,790
sufficiently different from humans to
know that there's something weird i

11988
03:22:02,790 --> 03:22:02,800
know that there's something weird i
 

11989
03:22:02,800 --> 03:22:05,110
know that there's something weird i
don't know i i i think it's actually an

11990
03:22:05,110 --> 03:22:05,120
don't know i i i think it's actually an
 

11991
03:22:05,120 --> 03:22:07,110
don't know i i i think it's actually an
incredibly difficult problem of figuring

11992
03:22:07,110 --> 03:22:07,120
incredibly difficult problem of figuring
 

11993
03:22:07,120 --> 03:22:09,429
incredibly difficult problem of figuring
out how to communicate with a thing way

11994
03:22:09,429 --> 03:22:09,439
out how to communicate with a thing way
 

11995
03:22:09,439 --> 03:22:11,830
out how to communicate with a thing way
dumber than you

11996
03:22:11,830 --> 03:22:11,840
dumber than you
 

11997
03:22:11,840 --> 03:22:13,590
dumber than you
people assume like

11998
03:22:13,590 --> 03:22:13,600
people assume like
 

11999
03:22:13,600 --> 03:22:15,750
people assume like
if you're smart it's easy to talk to the

12000
03:22:15,750 --> 03:22:15,760
if you're smart it's easy to talk to the
 

12001
03:22:15,760 --> 03:22:18,150
if you're smart it's easy to talk to the
dumb thing but i think it's actually

12002
03:22:18,150 --> 03:22:18,160
dumb thing but i think it's actually
 

12003
03:22:18,160 --> 03:22:20,950
dumb thing but i think it's actually
extremely difficult when the gap in

12004
03:22:20,950 --> 03:22:20,960
extremely difficult when the gap in
 

12005
03:22:20,960 --> 03:22:23,670
extremely difficult when the gap in
intelligence is just orders of magnitude

12006
03:22:23,670 --> 03:22:23,680
intelligence is just orders of magnitude
 

12007
03:22:23,680 --> 03:22:26,150
intelligence is just orders of magnitude
and so of course you can observe

12008
03:22:26,150 --> 03:22:26,160
and so of course you can observe
 

12009
03:22:26,160 --> 03:22:27,510
and so of course you can observe
but once you notice the thing is

12010
03:22:27,510 --> 03:22:27,520
but once you notice the thing is
 

12011
03:22:27,520 --> 03:22:29,990
but once you notice the thing is
sufficiently interesting

12012
03:22:29,990 --> 03:22:30,000
sufficiently interesting
 

12013
03:22:30,000 --> 03:22:32,070
sufficiently interesting
how do you communicate with that thing

12014
03:22:32,070 --> 03:22:32,080
how do you communicate with that thing
 

12015
03:22:32,080 --> 03:22:34,389
how do you communicate with that thing
so this is where one of the things i

12016
03:22:34,389 --> 03:22:34,399
so this is where one of the things i
 

12017
03:22:34,399 --> 03:22:36,550
so this is where one of the things i
always try to highlight is how

12018
03:22:36,550 --> 03:22:36,560
always try to highlight is how
 

12019
03:22:36,560 --> 03:22:38,630
always try to highlight is how
conspiracies are born

12020
03:22:38,630 --> 03:22:38,640
conspiracies are born
 

12021
03:22:38,640 --> 03:22:39,510
conspiracies are born
because

12022
03:22:39,510 --> 03:22:39,520
because
 

12023
03:22:39,520 --> 03:22:41,110
because
many people don't understand how easy it

12024
03:22:41,110 --> 03:22:41,120
many people don't understand how easy it
 

12025
03:22:41,120 --> 03:22:43,190
many people don't understand how easy it
is to fall into the conspiratorial

12026
03:22:43,190 --> 03:22:43,200
is to fall into the conspiratorial
 

12027
03:22:43,200 --> 03:22:44,229
is to fall into the conspiratorial
cycle

12028
03:22:44,229 --> 03:22:44,239
cycle
 

12029
03:22:44,239 --> 03:22:46,790
cycle
so the first step to a conspiracy being

12030
03:22:46,790 --> 03:22:46,800
so the first step to a conspiracy being
 

12031
03:22:46,800 --> 03:22:48,389
so the first step to a conspiracy being
born is to have

12032
03:22:48,389 --> 03:22:48,399
born is to have
 

12033
03:22:48,399 --> 03:22:49,670
born is to have
an a

12034
03:22:49,670 --> 03:22:49,680
an a
 

12035
03:22:49,680 --> 03:22:52,229
an a
piece of evidence that is true

12036
03:22:52,229 --> 03:22:52,239
piece of evidence that is true
 

12037
03:22:52,239 --> 03:22:54,309
piece of evidence that is true
and then immediately following the true

12038
03:22:54,309 --> 03:22:54,319
and then immediately following the true
 

12039
03:22:54,319 --> 03:22:55,269
and then immediately following the true
evidence

12040
03:22:55,269 --> 03:22:55,279
evidence
 

12041
03:22:55,279 --> 03:22:57,190
evidence
is a gap in information

12042
03:22:57,190 --> 03:22:57,200
is a gap in information
 

12043
03:22:57,200 --> 03:22:59,269
is a gap in information
and then to fill in the gap of

12044
03:22:59,269 --> 03:22:59,279
and then to fill in the gap of
 

12045
03:22:59,279 --> 03:23:00,630
and then to fill in the gap of
information

12046
03:23:00,630 --> 03:23:00,640
information
 

12047
03:23:00,640 --> 03:23:01,590
information
people

12048
03:23:01,590 --> 03:23:01,600
people
 

12049
03:23:01,600 --> 03:23:03,269
people
create an idea

12050
03:23:03,269 --> 03:23:03,279
create an idea
 

12051
03:23:03,279 --> 03:23:04,309
create an idea
and then

12052
03:23:04,309 --> 03:23:04,319
and then
 

12053
03:23:04,319 --> 03:23:06,469
and then
the next logical outcome is based on the

12054
03:23:06,469 --> 03:23:06,479
the next logical outcome is based on the
 

12055
03:23:06,479 --> 03:23:08,790
the next logical outcome is based on the
idea that they just created which is an

12056
03:23:08,790 --> 03:23:08,800
idea that they just created which is an
 

12057
03:23:08,800 --> 03:23:10,389
idea that they just created which is an
idea that's based on something that was

12058
03:23:10,389 --> 03:23:10,399
idea that's based on something that was
 

12059
03:23:10,399 --> 03:23:12,389
idea that's based on something that was
imagined in the first place

12060
03:23:12,389 --> 03:23:12,399
imagined in the first place
 

12061
03:23:12,399 --> 03:23:14,469
imagined in the first place
so the idea the factual thing is now two

12062
03:23:14,469 --> 03:23:14,479
so the idea the factual thing is now two
 

12063
03:23:14,479 --> 03:23:16,550
so the idea the factual thing is now two
steps away and then three steps away

12064
03:23:16,550 --> 03:23:16,560
steps away and then three steps away
 

12065
03:23:16,560 --> 03:23:18,070
steps away and then three steps away
four steps away as the things go on and

12066
03:23:18,070 --> 03:23:18,080
four steps away as the things go on and
 

12067
03:23:18,080 --> 03:23:19,110
four steps away as the things go on and
then all of a sudden you have this

12068
03:23:19,110 --> 03:23:19,120
then all of a sudden you have this
 

12069
03:23:19,120 --> 03:23:20,870
then all of a sudden you have this
kernel of truth that turned into this

12070
03:23:20,870 --> 03:23:20,880
kernel of truth that turned into this
 

12071
03:23:20,880 --> 03:23:22,950
kernel of truth that turned into this
wild conspiracy

12072
03:23:22,950 --> 03:23:22,960
wild conspiracy
 

12073
03:23:22,960 --> 03:23:24,950
wild conspiracy
so in our example

12074
03:23:24,950 --> 03:23:24,960
so in our example
 

12075
03:23:24,960 --> 03:23:26,229
so in our example
you talked about humans trying to

12076
03:23:26,229 --> 03:23:26,239
you talked about humans trying to
 

12077
03:23:26,239 --> 03:23:27,590
you talked about humans trying to
communicate with ants ants are not

12078
03:23:27,590 --> 03:23:27,600
communicate with ants ants are not
 

12079
03:23:27,600 --> 03:23:28,710
communicate with ants ants are not
intelligence

12080
03:23:28,710 --> 03:23:28,720
intelligence
 

12081
03:23:28,720 --> 03:23:30,710
intelligence
there's no ants not intelligent species

12082
03:23:30,710 --> 03:23:30,720
there's no ants not intelligent species
 

12083
03:23:30,720 --> 03:23:33,190
there's no ants not intelligent species
they're drone species that's somehow

12084
03:23:33,190 --> 03:23:33,200
they're drone species that's somehow
 

12085
03:23:33,200 --> 03:23:34,790
they're drone species that's somehow
commanded through whatever technology

12086
03:23:34,790 --> 03:23:34,800
commanded through whatever technology
 

12087
03:23:34,800 --> 03:23:36,950
commanded through whatever technology
whatever whatever spoken like a typical

12088
03:23:36,950 --> 03:23:36,960
whatever whatever spoken like a typical
 

12089
03:23:36,960 --> 03:23:38,950
whatever whatever spoken like a typical
human but yes whatever biological thing

12090
03:23:38,950 --> 03:23:38,960
human but yes whatever biological thing
 

12091
03:23:38,960 --> 03:23:40,309
human but yes whatever biological thing
is in the queen right but they're

12092
03:23:40,309 --> 03:23:40,319
is in the queen right but they're
 

12093
03:23:40,319 --> 03:23:41,830
is in the queen right but they're
they're not it's not a fair equivalent

12094
03:23:41,830 --> 03:23:41,840
they're not it's not a fair equivalent
 

12095
03:23:41,840 --> 03:23:43,349
they're not it's not a fair equivalent
but let's look at gorillas or let's look

12096
03:23:43,349 --> 03:23:43,359
but let's look at gorillas or let's look
 

12097
03:23:43,359 --> 03:23:45,110
but let's look at gorillas or let's look
at something in the monkey family right

12098
03:23:45,110 --> 03:23:45,120
at something in the monkey family right
 

12099
03:23:45,120 --> 03:23:45,910
at something in the monkey family right
where

12100
03:23:45,910 --> 03:23:45,920
where
 

12101
03:23:45,920 --> 03:23:47,670
where
largely we agree that there there is

12102
03:23:47,670 --> 03:23:47,680
largely we agree that there there is
 

12103
03:23:47,680 --> 03:23:49,349
largely we agree that there there is
some sort of intelligence there or

12104
03:23:49,349 --> 03:23:49,359
some sort of intelligence there or
 

12105
03:23:49,359 --> 03:23:53,830
some sort of intelligence there or
dolphins some sort of intelligence right

12106
03:23:53,830 --> 03:23:53,840
dolphins some sort of intelligence right
 

12107
03:23:53,840 --> 03:23:57,269
dolphins some sort of intelligence right
it is a human thing a human thing to

12108
03:23:57,269 --> 03:23:57,279
it is a human thing a human thing to
 

12109
03:23:57,279 --> 03:23:59,030
it is a human thing a human thing to
want to observe

12110
03:23:59,030 --> 03:23:59,040
want to observe
 

12111
03:23:59,040 --> 03:24:00,630
want to observe
and then communicate

12112
03:24:00,630 --> 03:24:00,640
and then communicate
 

12113
03:24:00,640 --> 03:24:02,070
and then communicate
and integrate

12114
03:24:02,070 --> 03:24:02,080
and integrate
 

12115
03:24:02,080 --> 03:24:05,030
and integrate
that's a human thing not an intelligent

12116
03:24:05,030 --> 03:24:05,040
that's a human thing not an intelligent
 

12117
03:24:05,040 --> 03:24:06,469
that's a human thing not an intelligent
life thing

12118
03:24:06,469 --> 03:24:06,479
life thing
 

12119
03:24:06,479 --> 03:24:08,870
life thing
so for us to even think that a foreign

12120
03:24:08,870 --> 03:24:08,880
so for us to even think that a foreign
 

12121
03:24:08,880 --> 03:24:11,510
so for us to even think that a foreign
and intelligent alien species would want

12122
03:24:11,510 --> 03:24:11,520
and intelligent alien species would want
 

12123
03:24:11,520 --> 03:24:13,830
and intelligent alien species would want
to engage and communicate at all

12124
03:24:13,830 --> 03:24:13,840
to engage and communicate at all
 

12125
03:24:13,840 --> 03:24:15,670
to engage and communicate at all
is an extremely human

12126
03:24:15,670 --> 03:24:15,680
is an extremely human
 

12127
03:24:15,680 --> 03:24:16,790
is an extremely human
assumption

12128
03:24:16,790 --> 03:24:16,800
assumption
 

12129
03:24:16,800 --> 03:24:18,309
assumption
and then from that assumption then we

12130
03:24:18,309 --> 03:24:18,319
and then from that assumption then we
 

12131
03:24:18,319 --> 03:24:19,429
and then from that assumption then we
started going into all the other things

12132
03:24:19,429 --> 03:24:19,439
started going into all the other things
 

12133
03:24:19,439 --> 03:24:21,590
started going into all the other things
you said if they wanted to communicate

12134
03:24:21,590 --> 03:24:21,600
you said if they wanted to communicate
 

12135
03:24:21,600 --> 03:24:23,190
you said if they wanted to communicate
wouldn't they want to mimic if they

12136
03:24:23,190 --> 03:24:23,200
wouldn't they want to mimic if they
 

12137
03:24:23,200 --> 03:24:24,790
wouldn't they want to mimic if they
wanted to mimic wouldn't they create

12138
03:24:24,790 --> 03:24:24,800
wanted to mimic wouldn't they create
 

12139
03:24:24,800 --> 03:24:26,710
wanted to mimic wouldn't they create
devices like ours so now we're three

12140
03:24:26,710 --> 03:24:26,720
devices like ours so now we're three
 

12141
03:24:26,720 --> 03:24:29,910
devices like ours so now we're three
steps removed from the the true fact of

12142
03:24:29,910 --> 03:24:29,920
steps removed from the the true fact of
 

12143
03:24:29,920 --> 03:24:31,670
steps removed from the the true fact of
there's something unexplainable in the

12144
03:24:31,670 --> 03:24:31,680
there's something unexplainable in the
 

12145
03:24:31,680 --> 03:24:34,389
there's something unexplainable in the
skies

12146
03:24:34,389 --> 03:24:34,399

 

12147
03:24:34,399 --> 03:24:36,790

yeah so the the fact is there's

12148
03:24:36,790 --> 03:24:36,800
yeah so the the fact is there's
 

12149
03:24:36,800 --> 03:24:38,229
yeah so the the fact is there's
something unexplainable in the skies and

12150
03:24:38,229 --> 03:24:38,239
something unexplainable in the skies and
 

12151
03:24:38,239 --> 03:24:39,910
something unexplainable in the skies and
then we're cons we're filling in the

12152
03:24:39,910 --> 03:24:39,920
then we're cons we're filling in the
 

12153
03:24:39,920 --> 03:24:42,550
then we're cons we're filling in the
gaps with all our basic human biases and

12154
03:24:42,550 --> 03:24:42,560
gaps with all our basic human biases and
 

12155
03:24:42,560 --> 03:24:45,030
gaps with all our basic human biases and
assumptions exactly but the thing is now

12156
03:24:45,030 --> 03:24:45,040
assumptions exactly but the thing is now
 

12157
03:24:45,040 --> 03:24:46,070
assumptions exactly but the thing is now
we're getting right back to project

12158
03:24:46,070 --> 03:24:46,080
we're getting right back to project
 

12159
03:24:46,080 --> 03:24:47,429
we're getting right back to project
northwood

12160
03:24:47,429 --> 03:24:47,439
northwood
 

12161
03:24:47,439 --> 03:24:49,510
northwood
we need some plan i don't care how crazy

12162
03:24:49,510 --> 03:24:49,520
we need some plan i don't care how crazy
 

12163
03:24:49,520 --> 03:24:51,590
we need some plan i don't care how crazy
the idea is guys give me some plan so

12164
03:24:51,590 --> 03:24:51,600
the idea is guys give me some plan so
 

12165
03:24:51,600 --> 03:24:53,510
the idea is guys give me some plan so
that's where we come up with well maybe

12166
03:24:53,510 --> 03:24:53,520
that's where we come up with well maybe
 

12167
03:24:53,520 --> 03:24:54,710
that's where we come up with well maybe
it's an alien species trying to

12168
03:24:54,710 --> 03:24:54,720
it's an alien species trying to
 

12169
03:24:54,720 --> 03:24:57,110
it's an alien species trying to
communicate or maybe it's an alien a

12170
03:24:57,110 --> 03:24:57,120
communicate or maybe it's an alien a
 

12171
03:24:57,120 --> 03:24:58,469
communicate or maybe it's an alien a
hostile threat that's trying to take

12172
03:24:58,469 --> 03:24:58,479
hostile threat that's trying to take
 

12173
03:24:58,479 --> 03:25:00,870
hostile threat that's trying to take
over the uh the world or who knows what

12174
03:25:00,870 --> 03:25:00,880
over the uh the world or who knows what
 

12175
03:25:00,880 --> 03:25:03,429
over the uh the world or who knows what
maybe it's but you have to

12176
03:25:03,429 --> 03:25:03,439
maybe it's but you have to
 

12177
03:25:03,439 --> 03:25:04,950
maybe it's but you have to
uh

12178
03:25:04,950 --> 03:25:04,960
uh
 

12179
03:25:04,960 --> 03:25:07,030
uh
you have to somehow construct hypotheses

12180
03:25:07,030 --> 03:25:07,040
you have to somehow construct hypotheses
 

12181
03:25:07,040 --> 03:25:10,070
you have to somehow construct hypotheses
and theories uh for anomalies

12182
03:25:10,070 --> 03:25:10,080
and theories uh for anomalies
 

12183
03:25:10,080 --> 03:25:11,429
and theories uh for anomalies
and then

12184
03:25:11,429 --> 03:25:11,439
and then
 

12185
03:25:11,439 --> 03:25:13,269
and then
from that

12186
03:25:13,269 --> 03:25:13,279
from that
 

12187
03:25:13,279 --> 03:25:16,389
from that
amidst giant pile of the ridiculous

12188
03:25:16,389 --> 03:25:16,399
amidst giant pile of the ridiculous
 

12189
03:25:16,399 --> 03:25:18,469
amidst giant pile of the ridiculous
emerges perhaps a deeper truth

12190
03:25:18,469 --> 03:25:18,479
emerges perhaps a deeper truth
 

12191
03:25:18,479 --> 03:25:20,950
emerges perhaps a deeper truth
absolutely over over a period of decades

12192
03:25:20,950 --> 03:25:20,960
absolutely over over a period of decades
 

12193
03:25:20,960 --> 03:25:23,590
absolutely over over a period of decades
and and uh at first that truth is

12194
03:25:23,590 --> 03:25:23,600
and and uh at first that truth is
 

12195
03:25:23,600 --> 03:25:25,670
and and uh at first that truth is
ridiculed and then it's accepted you

12196
03:25:25,670 --> 03:25:25,680
ridiculed and then it's accepted you
 

12197
03:25:25,680 --> 03:25:27,670
ridiculed and then it's accepted you
know that whole

12198
03:25:27,670 --> 03:25:27,680
know that whole
 

12199
03:25:27,680 --> 03:25:30,229
know that whole
process um the earth revolving around

12200
03:25:30,229 --> 03:25:30,239
process um the earth revolving around
 

12201
03:25:30,239 --> 03:25:32,070
process um the earth revolving around
the sun yeah the earth revolving around

12202
03:25:32,070 --> 03:25:32,080
the sun yeah the earth revolving around
 

12203
03:25:32,080 --> 03:25:33,830
the sun yeah the earth revolving around
the sun and but you know

12204
03:25:33,830 --> 03:25:33,840
the sun and but you know
 

12205
03:25:33,840 --> 03:25:36,710
the sun and but you know
to me it's interesting because it asks

12206
03:25:36,710 --> 03:25:36,720
to me it's interesting because it asks
 

12207
03:25:36,720 --> 03:25:39,510
to me it's interesting because it asks
us looking out there with seti just

12208
03:25:39,510 --> 03:25:39,520
us looking out there with seti just
 

12209
03:25:39,520 --> 03:25:41,910
us looking out there with seti just
looking for alien life

12210
03:25:41,910 --> 03:25:41,920
looking for alien life
 

12211
03:25:41,920 --> 03:25:42,630
looking for alien life
is

12212
03:25:42,630 --> 03:25:42,640
is
 

12213
03:25:42,640 --> 03:25:44,790
is
forcing us to really ask questions about

12214
03:25:44,790 --> 03:25:44,800
forcing us to really ask questions about
 

12215
03:25:44,800 --> 03:25:48,229
forcing us to really ask questions about
ourselves about what is life how special

12216
03:25:48,229 --> 03:25:48,239
ourselves about what is life how special
 

12217
03:25:48,239 --> 03:25:50,150
ourselves about what is life how special
first of all what is intelligence how

12218
03:25:50,150 --> 03:25:50,160
first of all what is intelligence how
 

12219
03:25:50,160 --> 03:25:52,389
first of all what is intelligence how
special is intelligence in the cosmos

12220
03:25:52,389 --> 03:25:52,399
special is intelligence in the cosmos
 

12221
03:25:52,399 --> 03:25:55,110
special is intelligence in the cosmos
and i think it's it's um inspiring and

12222
03:25:55,110 --> 03:25:55,120
and i think it's it's um inspiring and
 

12223
03:25:55,120 --> 03:25:57,349
and i think it's it's um inspiring and
challenging to us as human beings

12224
03:25:57,349 --> 03:25:57,359
challenging to us as human beings
 

12225
03:25:57,359 --> 03:25:58,630
challenging to us as human beings
both on a

12226
03:25:58,630 --> 03:25:58,640
both on a
 

12227
03:25:58,640 --> 03:26:00,309
both on a
scientific and engineering level but

12228
03:26:00,309 --> 03:26:00,319
scientific and engineering level but
 

12229
03:26:00,319 --> 03:26:02,309
scientific and engineering level but
also on a philosophical level i mean all

12230
03:26:02,309 --> 03:26:02,319
also on a philosophical level i mean all
 

12231
03:26:02,319 --> 03:26:04,309
also on a philosophical level i mean all
those questions that are laid before us

12232
03:26:04,309 --> 03:26:04,319
those questions that are laid before us
 

12233
03:26:04,319 --> 03:26:06,469
those questions that are laid before us
when you start to think about alien life

12234
03:26:06,469 --> 03:26:06,479
when you start to think about alien life
 

12235
03:26:06,479 --> 03:26:08,469
when you start to think about alien life
so you you interviewed joe rogan

12236
03:26:08,469 --> 03:26:08,479
so you you interviewed joe rogan
 

12237
03:26:08,479 --> 03:26:10,550
so you you interviewed joe rogan
recently yeah and he said something that

12238
03:26:10,550 --> 03:26:10,560
recently yeah and he said something that
 

12239
03:26:10,560 --> 03:26:12,309
recently yeah and he said something that
i thought was really

12240
03:26:12,309 --> 03:26:12,319
i thought was really
 

12241
03:26:12,319 --> 03:26:14,229
i thought was really
really brilliant during the podcast

12242
03:26:14,229 --> 03:26:14,239
really brilliant during the podcast
 

12243
03:26:14,239 --> 03:26:16,070
really brilliant during the podcast
interview he said that he's gonna love

12244
03:26:16,070 --> 03:26:16,080
interview he said that he's gonna love
 

12245
03:26:16,080 --> 03:26:19,750
interview he said that he's gonna love
hearing that very good sorry but he he

12246
03:26:19,750 --> 03:26:19,760
hearing that very good sorry but he he
 

12247
03:26:19,760 --> 03:26:22,790
hearing that very good sorry but he he
said that he realized at some point

12248
03:26:22,790 --> 03:26:22,800
said that he realized at some point
 

12249
03:26:22,800 --> 03:26:25,030
said that he realized at some point
that the turn in his opinion about ufos

12250
03:26:25,030 --> 03:26:25,040
that the turn in his opinion about ufos
 

12251
03:26:25,040 --> 03:26:26,950
that the turn in his opinion about ufos
happened when he realized how

12252
03:26:26,950 --> 03:26:26,960
happened when he realized how
 

12253
03:26:26,960 --> 03:26:30,389
happened when he realized how
desperately he wanted it to be true

12254
03:26:30,389 --> 03:26:30,399
desperately he wanted it to be true
 

12255
03:26:30,399 --> 03:26:31,670
desperately he wanted it to be true
this is

12256
03:26:31,670 --> 03:26:31,680
this is
 

12257
03:26:31,680 --> 03:26:33,670
this is
the human condition

12258
03:26:33,670 --> 03:26:33,680
the human condition
 

12259
03:26:33,680 --> 03:26:35,910
the human condition
we our pink matter works the same way as

12260
03:26:35,910 --> 03:26:35,920
we our pink matter works the same way as
 

12261
03:26:35,920 --> 03:26:37,190
we our pink matter works the same way as
everybody's pink matter and one of the

12262
03:26:37,190 --> 03:26:37,200
everybody's pink matter and one of the
 

12263
03:26:37,200 --> 03:26:38,950
everybody's pink matter and one of the
ways that our pink matter works is with

12264
03:26:38,950 --> 03:26:38,960
ways that our pink matter works is with
 

12265
03:26:38,960 --> 03:26:40,229
ways that our pink matter works is with
this thing with what's known as a

12266
03:26:40,229 --> 03:26:40,239
this thing with what's known as a
 

12267
03:26:40,239 --> 03:26:42,790
this thing with what's known as a
cognitive bias it's a mental shortcut

12268
03:26:42,790 --> 03:26:42,800
cognitive bias it's a mental shortcut
 

12269
03:26:42,800 --> 03:26:44,550
cognitive bias it's a mental shortcut
essentially your brain doesn't want to

12270
03:26:44,550 --> 03:26:44,560
essentially your brain doesn't want to
 

12271
03:26:44,560 --> 03:26:46,150
essentially your brain doesn't want to
process through facts over and over

12272
03:26:46,150 --> 03:26:46,160
process through facts over and over
 

12273
03:26:46,160 --> 03:26:48,150
process through facts over and over
again instead it wants to assume certain

12274
03:26:48,150 --> 03:26:48,160
again instead it wants to assume certain
 

12275
03:26:48,160 --> 03:26:49,429
again instead it wants to assume certain
facts are in place and just jump right

12276
03:26:49,429 --> 03:26:49,439
facts are in place and just jump right
 

12277
03:26:49,439 --> 03:26:51,110
facts are in place and just jump right
to the conclusion it saves energy it

12278
03:26:51,110 --> 03:26:51,120
to the conclusion it saves energy it
 

12279
03:26:51,120 --> 03:26:52,870
to the conclusion it saves energy it
saves megabytes

12280
03:26:52,870 --> 03:26:52,880
saves megabytes
 

12281
03:26:52,880 --> 03:26:54,309
saves megabytes
so what joe

12282
03:26:54,309 --> 03:26:54,319
so what joe
 

12283
03:26:54,319 --> 03:26:56,710
so what joe
what joe or joe rogan i feel weird

12284
03:26:56,710 --> 03:26:56,720
what joe or joe rogan i feel weird
 

12285
03:26:56,720 --> 03:26:58,150
what joe or joe rogan i feel weird
calling him joe i don't know him but

12286
03:26:58,150 --> 03:26:58,160
calling him joe i don't know him but
 

12287
03:26:58,160 --> 03:27:00,469
calling him joe i don't know him but
what joe identified on his own mr rogan

12288
03:27:00,469 --> 03:27:00,479
what joe identified on his own mr rogan
 

12289
03:27:00,479 --> 03:27:03,990
what joe identified on his own mr rogan
what mr rogan identified on his own yeah

12290
03:27:03,990 --> 03:27:04,000
what mr rogan identified on his own yeah
 

12291
03:27:04,000 --> 03:27:06,790
what mr rogan identified on his own yeah
was his own cognitive loop

12292
03:27:06,790 --> 03:27:06,800
was his own cognitive loop
 

12293
03:27:06,800 --> 03:27:08,790
was his own cognitive loop
and then he immediately grew suspicious

12294
03:27:08,790 --> 03:27:08,800
and then he immediately grew suspicious
 

12295
03:27:08,800 --> 03:27:10,229
and then he immediately grew suspicious
of that loop

12296
03:27:10,229 --> 03:27:10,239
of that loop
 

12297
03:27:10,239 --> 03:27:11,990
of that loop
that is a super powerful tool that is

12298
03:27:11,990 --> 03:27:12,000
that is a super powerful tool that is
 

12299
03:27:12,000 --> 03:27:13,750
that is a super powerful tool that is
something that most people never become

12300
03:27:13,750 --> 03:27:13,760
something that most people never become
 

12301
03:27:13,760 --> 03:27:15,590
something that most people never become
self-actualized enough to realize that

12302
03:27:15,590 --> 03:27:15,600
self-actualized enough to realize that
 

12303
03:27:15,600 --> 03:27:18,229
self-actualized enough to realize that
they have a cognitive loop let alone

12304
03:27:18,229 --> 03:27:18,239
they have a cognitive loop let alone
 

12305
03:27:18,239 --> 03:27:20,630
they have a cognitive loop let alone
questioning their own cognitive loop so

12306
03:27:20,630 --> 03:27:20,640
questioning their own cognitive loop so
 

12307
03:27:20,640 --> 03:27:21,590
questioning their own cognitive loop so
that was

12308
03:27:21,590 --> 03:27:21,600
that was
 

12309
03:27:21,600 --> 03:27:23,349
that was
when it came to this topic specifically

12310
03:27:23,349 --> 03:27:23,359
when it came to this topic specifically
 

12311
03:27:23,359 --> 03:27:24,309
when it came to this topic specifically
that was just something that i thought

12312
03:27:24,309 --> 03:27:24,319
that was just something that i thought
 

12313
03:27:24,319 --> 03:27:26,830
that was just something that i thought
was really powerful

12314
03:27:26,830 --> 03:27:26,840
was really powerful
 

12315
03:27:26,840 --> 03:27:28,790
was really powerful
because

12316
03:27:28,790 --> 03:27:28,800
because
 

12317
03:27:28,800 --> 03:27:30,150
because
you learned to not just not trust

12318
03:27:30,150 --> 03:27:30,160
you learned to not just not trust
 

12319
03:27:30,160 --> 03:27:32,070
you learned to not just not trust
yourself on the record

12320
03:27:32,070 --> 03:27:32,080
yourself on the record
 

12321
03:27:32,080 --> 03:27:34,950
yourself on the record
after he drinks one whiskey all that

12322
03:27:34,950 --> 03:27:34,960
after he drinks one whiskey all that
 

12323
03:27:34,960 --> 03:27:36,309
after he drinks one whiskey all that
goes out

12324
03:27:36,309 --> 03:27:36,319
goes out
 

12325
03:27:36,319 --> 03:27:38,070
goes out
i think that was just in that moment in

12326
03:27:38,070 --> 03:27:38,080
i think that was just in that moment in
 

12327

i think that was just in that moment in
time

12328

03:27:40,960 --> 03:27:42,710
like you know
of brilliance a moment of release

12332
03:27:42,710 --> 03:27:42,720
of brilliance a moment of release
 

12333
03:27:42,720 --> 03:27:45,190
of brilliance a moment of release
because i i think he still is uh

12334
03:27:45,190 --> 03:27:45,200
because i i think he still is uh
 

12335
03:27:45,200 --> 03:27:46,630

he's definitely one of the things that
 

12341
03:27:49,760 --> 03:27:51,750
he's definitely one of the things that
inspires me about joe is how open-minded

12342
03:27:51,750 --> 03:27:51,760
inspires me about joe is how open-minded
 

12343
03:27:51,760 --> 03:27:54,229
inspires me about joe is how open-minded
he is how curious he is he refuses to

03:27:54,229 --> 03:27:54,239
he is how curious he is he refuses to
 

12345

of any one community including the
 

12351
03:27:59,200 --> 03:28:02,309
of any one community including the
scientific community be a kind of uh

12352
03:28:02,309 --> 03:28:02,319
scientific community be a kind of uh
 

12353
03:28:02,319 --> 03:28:04,229
scientific community be a kind of uh
thing that limits his curiosity of

12354
03:28:04,229 --> 03:28:04,239
thing that limits his curiosity of
 

12355
03:28:04,239 --> 03:28:05,750
thing that limits his curiosity of
asking what if

12356
03:28:05,750 --> 03:28:05,760
asking what if
 

12357
03:28:05,760 --> 03:28:08,150
asking what if
uh it's like the the whole it's entirely

12358
03:28:08,150 --> 03:28:08,160
uh it's like the the whole it's entirely
 

12359
03:28:08,160 --> 03:28:09,510
uh it's like the the whole it's entirely
possible i think that's a beautiful

12360
03:28:09,510 --> 03:28:09,520
possible i think that's a beautiful
 

12361
03:28:09,520 --> 03:28:11,750
possible i think that's a beautiful
thing it actually represents

12362
03:28:11,750 --> 03:28:11,760
thing it actually represents
 

12363
03:28:11,760 --> 03:28:13,750
thing it actually represents
what uh the best of science is that

12364
03:28:13,750 --> 03:28:13,760
what uh the best of science is that
 

12365
03:28:13,760 --> 03:28:16,710
what uh the best of science is that
childlike curiosity but so it's good to

12366
03:28:16,710 --> 03:28:16,720
childlike curiosity but so it's good to
 

12367
03:28:16,720 --> 03:28:18,550
childlike curiosity but so it's good to
sort of balance those two things but

12368
03:28:18,550 --> 03:28:18,560
sort of balance those two things but
 

12369
03:28:18,560 --> 03:28:21,269
sort of balance those two things but
then you have to wake up to it like

12370
03:28:21,269 --> 03:28:21,279
then you have to wake up to it like
 

12371
03:28:21,279 --> 03:28:23,830
then you have to wake up to it like
is is this is there a chance this is

12372
03:28:23,830 --> 03:28:23,840
is is this is there a chance this is
 

12373
03:28:23,840 --> 03:28:26,389
is is this is there a chance this is
true or do i just really want it to be

12374
03:28:26,389 --> 03:28:26,399
true or do i just really want it to be
 

12375
03:28:26,399 --> 03:28:28,469
true or do i just really want it to be
true and that like that hot girl that

12376
03:28:28,469 --> 03:28:28,479
true and that like that hot girl that
 

12377
03:28:28,479 --> 03:28:30,630
true and that like that hot girl that
talks to you overseas yeah

12378
03:28:30,630 --> 03:28:30,640
talks to you overseas yeah
 

12379
03:28:30,640 --> 03:28:32,870
talks to you overseas yeah
yeah

12380
03:28:32,870 --> 03:28:32,880
yeah
 

12381
03:28:32,880 --> 03:28:34,870
yeah
for a brief moment

12382
03:28:34,870 --> 03:28:34,880
for a brief moment
 

12383
03:28:34,880 --> 03:28:36,870
for a brief moment
there's there's actually a deeper

12384
03:28:36,870 --> 03:28:36,880
there's there's actually a deeper
 

12385
03:28:36,880 --> 03:28:38,469
there's there's actually a deeper
explanation for it that i'll tell you

12386
03:28:38,469 --> 03:28:38,479
explanation for it that i'll tell you
 

12387
03:28:38,479 --> 03:28:40,469
explanation for it that i'll tell you
off the mic that

12388
03:28:40,469 --> 03:28:40,479
off the mic that
 

12389
03:28:40,479 --> 03:28:41,910
off the mic that
perhaps a lot of people can kind of

12390
03:28:41,910 --> 03:28:41,920
perhaps a lot of people can kind of
 

12391
03:28:41,920 --> 03:28:44,309
perhaps a lot of people can kind of
figure out anyway just to take it one

12392
03:28:44,309 --> 03:28:44,319
figure out anyway just to take it one
 

12393
03:28:44,319 --> 03:28:45,670
figure out anyway just to take it one

jack did not wake up to that loop at the
