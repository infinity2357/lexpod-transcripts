00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:46,480
so those are the three basic paradigms

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,150
so those are the three basic paradigms

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,230
and a lot of the work that we do in
mathematics is elliptic

interesting if there were two separate

both of those

both of those
 

673
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,790
both of those
but you didn't have to worry about what

okay that is the confusion that we're

okay that is the confusion that we're

okay that is the confusion that we're

they're gonna put a watch on your ankle

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,870
and at some point i pointed out the us
government had completely contradictory

994
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:32,880
government had completely contradictory
 

995
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,790
government had completely contradictory
objectives when it came to the military

996
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:34,800
objectives when it came to the military
 

997
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,069
objectives when it came to the military
and science

998
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:36,079
and science
 

999
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,990
and science
and one one branch said this one branch

1000
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:38,000
and one one branch said this one branch
 

1001
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,670
and one one branch said this one branch
said that i said you know i i don't

1002
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:39,680
said that i said you know i i don't
 

1003
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,150
said that i said you know i i don't
understand

1004
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:40,160
understand
 

1005
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,269
understand
which is true what does the government

1006
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:41,279
which is true what does the government
 

1007
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,389
which is true what does the government
want he said do you think there's a

1008
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:42,399
want he said do you think there's a
 

1009
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,509
want he said do you think there's a
government

1010
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:43,519
government
 

1011
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,389
government
and i said what do you mean he said what

1012
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:46,399
and i said what do you mean he said what
 

1013
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,910
and i said what do you mean he said what
makes you think that the people in those

1014
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:47,920
makes you think that the people in those
 

1015
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,749
makes you think that the people in those
two offices have ever coordinated

1016
00:16:51,749 --> 00:16:51,759
two offices have ever coordinated
 

1017
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,550
two offices have ever coordinated
what is it that allows each office to

1018
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:54,560
what is it that allows each office to
 

1019
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,629
what is it that allows each office to
have a coherent plan with respect to

1020
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:56,639
have a coherent plan with respect to
 

1021
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:57,590
have a coherent plan with respect to
every other office

1022
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:57,600
every other office
 

1023
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,870
every other office
and that's when i first started to

1024
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:58,880
and that's when i first started to
 

1025
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,470
and that's when i first started to
understand that there are periods where

1026
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:00,480
understand that there are periods where
 

1027
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,310
understand that there are periods where
the government coheres

1028
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:02,320
the government coheres
 

1029
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,430
the government coheres
and then there are periods where the

1030
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:03,440
and then there are periods where the
 

1031
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,189
and then there are periods where the
coherence just decays and i think that

1032
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:05,199
coherence just decays and i think that
 

1033
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,750
coherence just decays and i think that
that's been going on since 1945

1034
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:07,760
that's been going on since 1945
 

1035
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,429
that's been going on since 1945
that there have been a few places where

1036
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:09,439
that there have been a few places where
 

1037
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,110
that there have been a few places where
there's been increased coherence but in

1038
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:11,120
there's been increased coherence but in
 

1039
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,710
there's been increased coherence but in
general everything is just getting less

1040
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:12,720
general everything is just getting less
 

1041
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,990
general everything is just getting less
and less coherent

1042
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:14,000
and less coherent
 

1043
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,150
and less coherent
and that what ward did was focus us on

1044
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:16,160
and that what ward did was focus us on
 

1045
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,029
and that what ward did was focus us on
the need

1046
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:17,039
the need
 

1047
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,990
the need
to have a government of people a mission

1048
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:20,000
to have a government of people a mission
 

1049
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,789
to have a government of people a mission
capacity

technology commitment ideology and then

1052
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:24,160
technology commitment ideology and then
 

1053
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,150
technology commitment ideology and then
as soon as that was gone

1054
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:26,160
as soon as that was gone
 

1055
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,950
as soon as that was gone
um you know different people those who'd

1056
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:28,960
um you know different people those who'd
 

1057
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,270
um you know different people those who'd
been

1058
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:29,280
been
 

1059
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,710
been
through world war ii had one set of

1060
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:30,720
through world war ii had one set of
 

1061
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,350
through world war ii had one set of
beliefs those born in the 1950s

1062
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:33,360
beliefs those born in the 1950s
 

1063
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,750
beliefs those born in the 1950s
uh you know or late 40s by the time they

1064
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:35,760
uh you know or late 40s by the time they
 

1065
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,190
uh you know or late 40s by the time they
got to woodstock

1066
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:37,200
got to woodstock
 

1067
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,669
got to woodstock
uh they didn't buy any of that so

1068
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:39,679
uh they didn't buy any of that so
 

1069
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,270
uh they didn't buy any of that so
coherence is the

1070
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:41,280
coherence is the
 

1071
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,390
coherence is the
is that the complete opposite of like

1072
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:44,400
is that the complete opposite of like
 

1073
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,430
is that the complete opposite of like
per uh of bureaucracy being paralyzed by

1074
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:47,440
per uh of bureaucracy being paralyzed by
 

1075
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,390
per uh of bureaucracy being paralyzed by
bureaucracy

1076
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:48,400
bureaucracy
 

1077
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,590
bureaucracy
so coherence is efficient functional

1078
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:51,600
so coherence is efficient functional
 

1079
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,510
so coherence is efficient functional
government because when you say there's

1080
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:53,520
government because when you say there's
 

1081
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,230
government because when you say there's
no government meaning there's no

1082
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:56,240
no government meaning there's no
 

1083
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,190
no government meaning there's no
uh emergent function from a collection

1084
00:17:59,190 --> 00:17:59,200
uh emergent function from a collection
 

1085
00:17:59,200 --> 00:17:59,990
uh emergent function from a collection
of individuals

1086
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:00,000
of individuals
 

1087
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,630
of individuals
it's just a bunch of individuals stuck

1088
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:02,640
it's just a bunch of individuals stuck
 

1089
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,310
it's just a bunch of individuals stuck
in their offices without any kind of

1090
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:04,320
in their offices without any kind of
 

1091
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,830
in their offices without any kind of
efficient communication with each other

1092
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:05,840
efficient communication with each other
 

1093
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,270
efficient communication with each other
on a single mission

1094
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:07,280
on a single mission
 

1095
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,390
on a single mission
and so a a government that is

1096
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:10,400
and so a a government that is
 

1097
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,870
and so a a government that is
truly at the epitome of what a

truly at the epitome of what a

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,990
truly at the epitome of what a
government is supposed to be

government is supposed to be
 

1101
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,430

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,190
is when a bunch of people working
together what are we about are we about

together what are we about are we about
 

1105
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:17,669
together what are we about are we about
freedom

freedom
 

1107
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,549

are we about growth are we about decency

are we about growth are we about decency
 

1109
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,909
are we about growth are we about decency

uh are we about the absence of a

uh are we about the absence of a
 

1113
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,909
uh are we about the absence of a
national culture so that we can all just

1114
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:25,919
national culture so that we can all just
 

1115
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,789
national culture so that we can all just
do our own thing

1116
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:26,799
do our own thing
 

1117
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,870
do our own thing
i've called this thing the usa and the

1118
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:28,880
i've called this thing the usa and the
 

1119
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,430
i've called this thing the usa and the
united states of absolutely nothing

1120

united states of absolutely nothing

these are all different visions for our

these are all different visions for our

these are all different visions for our

country
so it's possible that there's a alien

1126
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:38,160
so it's possible that there's a alien
 

1127
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,350
so it's possible that there's a alien
spacecraft somewhere

1128
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:39,360
spacecraft somewhere
 

1129
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,909
spacecraft somewhere
and there's of like 20 people that know

1130
00:18:41,909 --> 00:18:41,919
and there's of like 20 people that know
 

1131
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:42,710
and there's of like 20 people that know
about it

1132
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:42,720
about it
 

1133
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,710
about it
and then they're kind of it like as you

1134
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:44,720
and then they're kind of it like as you
 

1135
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,310
and then they're kind of it like as you
communicate further and further into the

1136
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:46,320
communicate further and further into the
 

1137

that information dissipates it gets
distorted in some kind of way and then

distorted in some kind of way and then
 

1143
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,549
distorted in some kind of way and then
it's completely lost the power the

it's completely lost the power the

it's completely lost the power the

we bought a house and i had this idea

we bought a house and i had this idea
 

1149
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:58,789
we bought a house and i had this idea
that i wanted to find out what all the

other aspects to speech so if you think

about speech as a bundle
 

2193
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,710
about speech as a bundle
i like this then it got unbundled

and some of those aspects that we were

in the modern era in the same way or we
 

2209
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,550
in the modern era in the same way or we
have to work through an abstraction

have to work through an abstraction
 

2211
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,069
have to work through an abstraction
either we probably have to amend the

and that issue is
not something we're facing up to i watch

bundle
and now it's and then how do we abstract

2366
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:13,359
and now it's and then how do we abstract
 

2367
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:14,470
and now it's and then how do we abstract
the bundle

2368

um barry convinced me that it was the

undoubtedly barry was right i was wrong
but

5680
01:37:36,070 --> 01:37:36,080
but
 

5681
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:39,270
but
the key point is nothing can grow in

5682
01:37:39,270 --> 01:37:39,280
the key point is nothing can grow in
 

5683
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:40,390
the key point is nothing can grow in
this environment

5684
01:37:40,390 --> 01:37:40,400
this environment
 

5685
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:43,350
this environment
there's a reason we're not building it

5686
01:37:43,350 --> 01:37:43,360
there's a reason we're not building it
 

5687
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:44,390
there's a reason we're not building it
does not appear

does not appear
 

5689
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:47,830

that we found a way to grow anything

5690
01:37:47,830 --> 01:37:47,840
that we found a way to grow anything
 

5691
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:49,830
that we found a way to grow anything
organic and good and decent that we need

organic and good and decent that we need
 

5693
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:52,070
organic and good and decent that we need
right now and that's kind of the key

5694
01:37:52,070 --> 01:37:52,080
right now and that's kind of the key
 

5695
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:54,629
right now and that's kind of the key
issue who's the we do you mean us as a

01:37:54,629 --> 01:37:54,639
issue who's the we do you mean us as a

but do you think it's useful to have a
 

5709
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:11,350
but do you think it's useful to have a
term like the idw to capture some

if there are multiple elephants in the

room yes the point is is that the idw
 

5755
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:54,950
room yes the point is is that the idw
was more interested in seeing the

figure out
how do we move forward as opposed to

01:38:59,590 --> 01:38:59,600
how do we move forward as opposed to
 

5763
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:00,950
how do we move forward as opposed to
saying i can spot the other guy's

5764
01:39:00,950 --> 01:39:00,960
saying i can spot the other guy's

01:39:05,669 --> 01:39:05,679
right and you know in large measure we
 

5771
01:39:05,679 --> 01:39:07,669
right and you know in large measure we
didn't represent

5772
01:39:07,669 --> 01:39:07,679
didn't represent
 

5773
01:39:07,679 --> 01:39:10,629
didn't represent
an institutional base and therefore it

5774

an institutional base and therefore it
 

5775
01:39:10,639 --> 01:39:11,270
an institutional base and therefore it
wasn't

01:39:11,270 --> 01:39:11,280
wasn't
 

5777
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:12,870

fact-based reality-based
 

6147
01:45:45,639 --> 01:45:48,950
fact-based reality-based
feasibility-based understanding we can

6148
01:45:48,950 --> 01:45:48,960
feasibility-based understanding we can
 

6149
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:50,070
feasibility-based understanding we can
try to figure out where our real

6150
01:45:50,070 --> 01:45:50,080
try to figure out where our real
 

6151
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:53,510
try to figure out where our real
opportunities are

6152
01:45:53,510 --> 01:45:53,520

 

6153
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:55,990

so it feels like everybody with a posi

6154
01:45:55,990 --> 01:45:56,000
so it feels like everybody with a posi
 

6155
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:57,830
so it feels like everybody with a posi
with the ability to do something like

01:45:57,830 --> 01:45:57,840
with the ability to do something like
 

6157
01:45:57,840 --> 01:45:58,149
with the ability to do something like
that

6158
01:45:58,149 --> 01:45:58,159
that
 

6159
01:45:58,159 --> 01:45:59,590
that
and with the with the brains and

6160
01:45:59,590 --> 01:45:59,600
and with the with the brains and
 

6161
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:02,950
and with the with the brains and
experience and the resources

6162

experience and the resources
 

6163
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:06,149
experience and the resources
would rather sit in the current system

6164
01:46:06,149 --> 01:46:06,159
would rather sit in the current system
 

6165
01:46:06,159 --> 01:46:07,830
would rather sit in the current system
and hope to figure out where they can

6166
01:46:07,830 --> 01:46:07,840
and hope to figure out where they can
 

6167
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:10,070
and hope to figure out where they can
flee to if the whole thing comes apart

6168

well yeah and maybe to push back in a

6170
01:46:12,070 --> 01:46:12,080
well yeah and maybe to push back in a
 

6171
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:13,910
well yeah and maybe to push back in a
little bit i i agree with you but

6172
01:46:13,910 --> 01:46:13,920
little bit i i agree with you but
 

6173
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:16,629
little bit i i agree with you but
you know it feels like there some people

6174
01:46:16,629 --> 01:46:16,639
you know it feels like there some people
 

6175
01:46:16,639 --> 01:46:19,189
you know it feels like there some people
are trying that so for example google

6176
01:46:19,189 --> 01:46:19,199
are trying that so for example google
 

6177
01:46:19,199 --> 01:46:21,910
are trying that so for example google
purchased deep mind uh deepmind is a

purchased deep mind uh deepmind is a
 

6179
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:23,510
purchased deep mind uh deepmind is a
company that kind of represents

6180
01:46:23,510 --> 01:46:23,520
company that kind of represents
 

6181
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:25,430
company that kind of represents
a lot of radical ideas they're they've

6182
01:46:25,430 --> 01:46:25,440
a lot of radical ideas they're they've
 

6183
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:27,669
a lot of radical ideas they're they've
become acceptable actually

6184

not taking the further step of being
 

6203
01:46:48,159 --> 01:46:49,430
not taking the further step of being
more radical but

6204
01:46:49,430 --> 01:46:49,440
more radical but
 

6205
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:51,270
more radical but
you know that was an attempt by google

6206
01:46:51,270 --> 01:46:51,280
you know that was an attempt by google
 

6207
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:52,870
you know that was an attempt by google
to say

6208
01:46:52,870 --> 01:46:52,880
to say
 

6209
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:57,510
to say
uh that let's let's try some wild stuff

6210
01:46:57,510 --> 01:46:57,520
uh that let's let's try some wild stuff
 

6211
01:46:57,520 --> 01:46:59,590
uh that let's let's try some wild stuff
sort of like boston dynamics sort of

out their ideas the idea is that

innovation
 

6229
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:18,310
innovation
is like dessert you can have dessert

6230
01:47:18,310 --> 01:47:18,320
is like dessert you can have dessert
 

6231
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:20,149
is like dessert you can have dessert
after you solve

so that is we can get into innovation

6240
01:47:27,030 --> 01:47:27,040
so that is we can get into innovation
 

6241
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:28,149
so that is we can get into innovation
sure once we be

sure once we be
once we perfect ourselves and you're

the the main meal well i'm saying that

6250
01:47:34,470 --> 01:47:34,480
the the main meal well i'm saying that
 

6251
01:47:34,480 --> 01:47:35,590
the the main meal well i'm saying that
there really is

6252

there really is
 

6253
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:38,629
there really is
structural oppression i mean if you

6254
01:47:38,629 --> 01:47:38,639
structural oppression i mean if you
 

6255
01:47:38,639 --> 01:47:39,830
structural oppression i mean if you
train

6256

yeah so let's not disagree that there

6264
01:47:50,470 --> 01:47:50,480
yeah so let's not disagree that there
 

6265
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:51,990
yeah so let's not disagree that there
are real issues around this

6266
01:47:51,990 --> 01:47:52,000
are real issues around this
 

6267
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,550
are real issues around this
in fact that's an issue of innovation

6268
01:47:54,550 --> 01:47:54,560
in fact that's an issue of innovation
 

6269
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:55,350
in fact that's an issue of innovation
and data

6270
01:47:55,350 --> 01:47:55,360
and data
 

6271
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:58,070
and data
your data should be responsive on the

6272
01:47:58,070 --> 01:47:58,080
your data should be responsive on the
 

6273
01:47:58,080 --> 01:47:58,790
your data should be responsive on the

there are things we can't do anything

6276
01:48:00,149 --> 01:48:00,159
there are things we can't do anything
 

6277
01:48:00,159 --> 01:48:02,709
there are things we can't do anything
about that are actually

01:48:02,709 --> 01:48:02,719
about that are actually
 

6279
01:48:02,719 --> 01:48:06,470
about that are actually
you know fundamental and um

6280
01:48:06,470 --> 01:48:06,480
you know fundamental and um
 

6281
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:08,229
you know fundamental and um
those things may have to do with the

6282
01:48:08,229 --> 01:48:08,239
those things may have to do with the
 

6283
01:48:08,239 --> 01:48:10,950
those things may have to do with the
fact that uh you know some of us

6284
01:48:10,950 --> 01:48:10,960
fact that uh you know some of us
 

6285

we cannot hold progress hostage to that

6312
01:48:42,310 --> 01:48:42,320
we cannot hold progress hostage to that
 

6313
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:45,430
we cannot hold progress hostage to that
and you've talked about perhaps we'll

6314
01:48:45,430 --> 01:48:45,440
and you've talked about perhaps we'll
 

6315
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:46,790
and you've talked about perhaps we'll
save this for another time because it's

6316
01:48:46,790 --> 01:48:46,800
save this for another time because it's
 

6317
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:47,990
save this for another time because it's
such a fascinating conversation we

6318
01:48:47,990 --> 01:48:48,000
such a fascinating conversation we
 

6319
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:48,950
such a fascinating conversation we
talked about

6320
01:48:48,950 --> 01:48:48,960
talked about
 

6321
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:52,629
talked about
this with uh glenn beck is the whole

6322
01:48:52,629 --> 01:48:52,639
this with uh glenn beck is the whole
 

6323

this with uh glenn beck is the whole
stagnation of growth and all that kind

6324
01:48:54,149 --> 01:48:54,159
stagnation of growth and all that kind
 

6325
01:48:54,159 --> 01:48:56,070
stagnation of growth and all that kind
of stuff your idea is that

6326
01:48:56,070 --> 01:48:56,080
of stuff your idea is that
 

6327
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:59,830
of stuff your idea is that
in as much as the current situation

6328
01:48:59,830 --> 01:48:59,840
in as much as the current situation
 

6329
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:02,070
in as much as the current situation
is a kind of ponzi scheme the current

6330
01:49:02,070 --> 01:49:02,080
is a kind of ponzi scheme the current
 

6331
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:03,669
is a kind of ponzi scheme the current
situation in the united states

6332
01:49:03,669 --> 01:49:03,679
situation in the united states
 

6333
01:49:03,679 --> 01:49:06,310
situation in the united states
is a kind of ponzi scheme built on the

01:49:06,310 --> 01:49:06,320
is a kind of ponzi scheme built on the
 

6335
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:07,189
is a kind of ponzi scheme built on the
promise of

6336
01:49:07,189 --> 01:49:07,199
promise of
 

6337
01:49:07,199 --> 01:49:10,229
promise of
constant unending innovation

6338
01:49:10,229 --> 01:49:10,239
constant unending innovation
 

6339
01:49:10,239 --> 01:49:14,870
constant unending innovation
we need uh we need to

6340
01:49:14,870 --> 01:49:14,880
we need uh we need to
 

6341
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:18,229
we need uh we need to
fund the true innovators and

6342
01:49:18,229 --> 01:49:18,239
fund the true innovators and
 

6343
01:49:18,239 --> 01:49:21,910
fund the true innovators and
uh encourage them and empower them

6344
01:49:21,910 --> 01:49:21,920
uh encourage them and empower them
 

6345
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:23,750
uh encourage them and empower them
and sort of culturally say that this is

6346
01:49:23,750 --> 01:49:23,760
and sort of culturally say that this is
 

6347
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:25,030
and sort of culturally say that this is
what this country is about

6348
01:49:25,030 --> 01:49:25,040
what this country is about
 

6349
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:26,950
what this country is about
is let's put it this way the brilliant

6350
01:49:26,950 --> 01:49:26,960
is let's put it this way the brilliant
 

6351
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:29,589
is let's put it this way the brilliant
minds we're gonna kill each other

6352
01:49:29,589 --> 01:49:29,599
minds we're gonna kill each other
 

6353
01:49:29,599 --> 01:49:32,229
minds we're gonna kill each other
if we don't grow growth is like an

6354
01:49:32,229 --> 01:49:32,239
if we don't grow growth is like an
 

6355
01:49:32,239 --> 01:49:34,550
if we don't grow growth is like an
immune system

6356
01:49:34,550 --> 01:49:34,560
immune system
 

6357
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:36,550
immune system
and you always have pathogens present

6358
01:49:36,550 --> 01:49:36,560
and you always have pathogens present
 

6359
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:37,990
and you always have pathogens present
but if you don't have growth present you

6360
01:49:37,990 --> 01:49:38,000
but if you don't have growth present you
 

6361
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:39,430
but if you don't have growth present you
can't fight the pathogens in your

6362
01:49:39,430 --> 01:49:39,440
can't fight the pathogens in your
 

6363
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:40,149
can't fight the pathogens in your
society

6364
01:49:40,149 --> 01:49:40,159
society
 

6365
01:49:40,159 --> 01:49:41,589
society
and right now the pathogens are

6366
01:49:41,589 --> 01:49:41,599
and right now the pathogens are
 

6367
01:49:41,599 --> 01:49:43,589
and right now the pathogens are
spreading everywhere

6368
01:49:43,589 --> 01:49:43,599
spreading everywhere
 

6369
01:49:43,599 --> 01:49:45,270
spreading everywhere
so if we don't get growth into our

6370
01:49:45,270 --> 01:49:45,280
so if we don't get growth into our
 

6371
01:49:45,280 --> 01:49:47,030
so if we don't get growth into our
system fairly quickly

6372
01:49:47,030 --> 01:49:47,040
system fairly quickly
 

6373
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:50,629
system fairly quickly
we are in really seriously bad shape

6374
01:49:50,629 --> 01:49:50,639
we are in really seriously bad shape
 

6375
01:49:50,639 --> 01:49:53,589
we are in really seriously bad shape
so it's very important that if i had a

6376
01:49:53,589 --> 01:49:53,599
so it's very important that if i had a
 

6377
01:49:53,599 --> 01:49:55,510
so it's very important that if i had a
horrible person who was capable of

6378
01:49:55,510 --> 01:49:55,520
horrible person who was capable of
 

6379
01:49:55,520 --> 01:49:57,270
horrible person who was capable of
building something that would give us

6380
01:49:57,270 --> 01:49:57,280
building something that would give us
 

6381
01:49:57,280 --> 01:49:58,470
building something that would give us
all

6382
01:49:58,470 --> 01:49:58,480
all
 

6383
01:49:58,480 --> 01:49:59,510
all
a certain amount of what i've called

where we all

01:50:03,270 --> 01:50:03,280
where we all

01:50:03,280 --> 01:50:04,950
where we all
benefit let's say quantum computing

benefit let's say quantum computing
 

6391
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:06,550
benefit let's say quantum computing
comes in and everybody

01:50:06,550 --> 01:50:06,560
comes in and everybody
 

6393
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:08,390
comes in and everybody
the dry cleaner has a quantum computing

6394

the dry cleaner has a quantum computing
angle right yes

01:50:10,320 --> 01:50:13,750
angle right yes
okay that's necessary to keep this

6398
01:50:13,750 --> 01:50:13,760
okay that's necessary to keep this
 

6399
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:14,950
okay that's necessary to keep this
system that we built

6400
01:50:14,950 --> 01:50:14,960
system that we built
 

6401
01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:17,430
system that we built
going we can try to redesign the system

6402
01:50:17,430 --> 01:50:17,440
going we can try to redesign the system
 

6403
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:19,589
going we can try to redesign the system
but our system expects growth and we've

6404
01:50:19,589 --> 01:50:19,599
but our system expects growth and we've
 

6405
01:50:19,599 --> 01:50:20,229
but our system expects growth and we've
started

6406
01:50:20,229 --> 01:50:20,239
started

started
starved it for growth and the madness

6408
01:50:21,910 --> 01:50:21,920
starved it for growth and the madness
 

6409
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:23,990
starved it for growth and the madness
that we're seeing is the failure of

6410
01:50:23,990 --> 01:50:24,000
that we're seeing is the failure of
 

6411
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:25,510
that we're seeing is the failure of
our immune system to be able to handle

6412
01:50:25,510 --> 01:50:25,520
our immune system to be able to handle
 

6413
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:26,950
our immune system to be able to handle
the pathogens that have always been

6414
01:50:26,950 --> 01:50:26,960
the pathogens that have always been
 

6415
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:28,310
the pathogens that have always been
present

6416

so people you know can say well this was

01:50:29,910 --> 01:50:29,920
so people you know can say well this was
 

6419

so people you know can say well this was
always there yes it was what's changed

01:50:31,910 --> 01:50:31,920
always there yes it was what's changed
 

6421
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:34,229
always there yes it was what's changed
was your immune system

6422
01:50:34,229 --> 01:50:34,239
was your immune system
 

6423
01:50:34,239 --> 01:50:37,589
was your immune system
we have got to make sure that

the japanese i also believe

the japanese i also believe
that we have communities where if you

that we have communities where if you

idea of diminishing returns if you've

idea of diminishing returns if you've
 

6453
01:51:07,119 --> 01:51:09,589
idea of diminishing returns if you've
never mined a community

never mined a community

never mined a community
many of the people you're going to get

many of the people you're going to get
 

6457
01:51:10,639 --> 01:51:12,709
many of the people you're going to get
at the beginning are going to be amazing

at the beginning are going to be amazing
 

6459
01:51:12,719 --> 01:51:15,030
at the beginning are going to be amazing
because that community it's like did you

drill for more oil in texas texas is
 

6463
01:51:17,040 --> 01:51:17,430
drill for more oil in texas texas is
pretty

now part of the problem with this is
that a lot of the energy

that a lot of the energy

and accusation yeah and what i want
is i want to kick ass and my hope is is

in a curved economy everything should be
path dependence but they

6892

path dependence but they
 

6893
01:58:51,119 --> 01:58:52,870
path dependence but they
view path dependence as a problem

6894
01:58:52,870 --> 01:58:52,880
view path dependence as a problem
 

6895

7613
02:11:38,639 --> 02:11:41,430
their usual nonsense
it's time to go is there still puzzles

7614
02:11:41,430 --> 02:11:41,440
it's time to go is there still puzzles
 

7615
02:11:41,440 --> 02:11:43,030
it's time to go is there still puzzles
in your own mind

7616
02:11:43,030 --> 02:11:43,040
in your own mind
 

7617
02:11:43,040 --> 02:11:44,790
in your own mind
that need to be figured out for you to

7618
02:11:44,790 --> 02:11:44,800
that need to be figured out for you to
 

7619
02:11:44,800 --> 02:11:46,550
that need to be figured out for you to
try to put it on paper i mean

7620
02:11:46,550 --> 02:11:46,560
try to put it on paper i mean
 

7621
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:48,310
try to put it on paper i mean
those are different mediums right it was

7622
02:11:48,310 --> 02:11:48,320
those are different mediums right it was
 

7623
02:11:48,320 --> 02:11:50,069
those are different mediums right it was
a great question

7624
02:11:50,069 --> 02:11:50,079
a great question
 

7625
02:11:50,079 --> 02:11:52,069
a great question
i did not count on something that turns

7626
02:11:52,069 --> 02:11:52,079
i did not count on something that turns
 

7627
02:11:52,079 --> 02:11:54,550
i did not count on something that turns
out to be important

7628
02:11:54,550 --> 02:11:54,560
out to be important
 

7629
02:11:54,560 --> 02:11:56,550
out to be important
when you work on your own outside of the

7630
02:11:56,550 --> 02:11:56,560
when you work on your own outside of the
 

7631
02:11:56,560 --> 02:11:58,629
when you work on your own outside of the
system for a long time

7632
02:11:58,629 --> 02:11:58,639
system for a long time
 

7633
02:11:58,639 --> 02:12:00,069
system for a long time
you probably don't think you're going to

7634
02:12:00,069 --> 02:12:00,079
you probably don't think you're going to
 

7635
02:12:00,079 --> 02:12:02,470
you probably don't think you're going to
be doing this as a 55 year old

7636
02:12:02,470 --> 02:12:02,480
be doing this as a 55 year old
 

7637
02:12:02,480 --> 02:12:05,990
be doing this as a 55 year old
man and i have been so long outside of

7638
02:12:05,990 --> 02:12:06,000
man and i have been so long outside of
 

7639
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:07,430
man and i have been so long outside of
math and physics departments and i've

7640
02:12:07,430 --> 02:12:07,440
math and physics departments and i've
 

7641
02:12:07,440 --> 02:12:08,870
math and physics departments and i've
been occupied with so many other things

7642
02:12:08,870 --> 02:12:08,880
been occupied with so many other things
 

7643
02:12:08,880 --> 02:12:10,550
been occupied with so many other things
as you can see

7644
02:12:10,550 --> 02:12:10,560
as you can see
 

7645
02:12:10,560 --> 02:12:14,470
as you can see
that the old idea that i had was if i

7646
02:12:14,470 --> 02:12:14,480
that the old idea that i had was if i
 

7647
02:12:14,480 --> 02:12:17,189
that the old idea that i had was if i
always did it in little pieces

7648
02:12:17,189 --> 02:12:17,199
always did it in little pieces
 

7649
02:12:17,199 --> 02:12:18,870
always did it in little pieces
then i was always safe because it

7650
02:12:18,870 --> 02:12:18,880
then i was always safe because it
 

7651
02:12:18,880 --> 02:12:21,270
then i was always safe because it
wouldn't be stealable

7652
02:12:21,270 --> 02:12:21,280
wouldn't be stealable
 

7653
02:12:21,280 --> 02:12:23,750
wouldn't be stealable
and so now those pieces never got

7654
02:12:23,750 --> 02:12:23,760
and so now those pieces never got
 

7655
02:12:23,760 --> 02:12:24,550
and so now those pieces never got
assembled

7656
02:12:24,550 --> 02:12:24,560
assembled
 

7657
02:12:24,560 --> 02:12:27,750
assembled
completely in essence i have all the

7658
02:12:27,750 --> 02:12:27,760
completely in essence i have all the
 

7659
02:12:27,760 --> 02:12:28,950
completely in essence i have all the
pieces

7660
02:12:28,950 --> 02:12:28,960
pieces
 

7661
02:12:28,960 --> 02:12:32,390
pieces
and i can fit them together

7662
02:12:32,390 --> 02:12:32,400
and i can fit them together
 

7663
02:12:32,400 --> 02:12:34,069
and i can fit them together
but there's probably a small amount of

7664
02:12:34,069 --> 02:12:34,079
but there's probably a small amount of
 

7665
02:12:34,079 --> 02:12:35,510
but there's probably a small amount of
glue code

7666
02:12:35,510 --> 02:12:35,520
glue code
 

7667
02:12:35,520 --> 02:12:37,109
glue code
like there are a few algebraic things

7668
02:12:37,109 --> 02:12:37,119
like there are a few algebraic things
 

7669
02:12:37,119 --> 02:12:38,870
like there are a few algebraic things
i've forgotten how to do i may or may

7670
02:12:38,870 --> 02:12:38,880
i've forgotten how to do i may or may
 

7671
02:12:38,880 --> 02:12:40,470
i've forgotten how to do i may or may
not figure them out between now and

7672
02:12:40,470 --> 02:12:40,480
not figure them out between now and
 

7673
02:12:40,480 --> 02:12:41,750
not figure them out between now and
april 1st

7674
02:12:41,750 --> 02:12:41,760
april 1st
 

7675
02:12:41,760 --> 02:12:43,830
april 1st
but it's pretty complete but that's the

7676
02:12:43,830 --> 02:12:43,840
but it's pretty complete but that's the
 

7677
02:12:43,840 --> 02:12:45,750
but it's pretty complete but that's the
puzzle you're kind of uh

7678
02:12:45,750 --> 02:12:45,760
puzzle you're kind of uh
 

7679
02:12:45,760 --> 02:12:48,310
puzzle you're kind of uh
struggling to now figure out to get it

7680
02:12:48,310 --> 02:12:48,320
struggling to now figure out to get it
 

7681
02:12:48,320 --> 02:12:49,750
struggling to now figure out to get it
all on

7682
02:12:49,750 --> 02:12:49,760
all on
 

7683
02:12:49,760 --> 02:12:51,589
all on
the glue together i can't tell you

7684
02:12:51,589 --> 02:12:51,599
the glue together i can't tell you
 

7685
02:12:51,599 --> 02:12:53,109
the glue together i can't tell you
whether the theory is correct

7686
02:12:53,109 --> 02:12:53,119
whether the theory is correct
 

7687
02:12:53,119 --> 02:12:54,709
whether the theory is correct
or incorrect but like you know for

7688
02:12:54,709 --> 02:12:54,719
or incorrect but like you know for
 

7689
02:12:54,719 --> 02:12:56,310
or incorrect but like you know for
example there's what's the exact form of

7690
02:12:56,310 --> 02:12:56,320
example there's what's the exact form of
 

7691
02:12:56,320 --> 02:12:58,310
example there's what's the exact form of
the super symmetry algebra or

7692
02:12:58,310 --> 02:12:58,320
the super symmetry algebra or
 

7693
02:12:58,320 --> 02:13:00,310
the super symmetry algebra or
how what's the rule for passing a minus

7694
02:13:00,310 --> 02:13:00,320
how what's the rule for passing a minus
 

7695
02:13:00,320 --> 02:13:02,790
how what's the rule for passing a minus
sign through a particular operator

7696
02:13:02,790 --> 02:13:02,800
sign through a particular operator
 

7697
02:13:02,800 --> 02:13:04,709
sign through a particular operator
and all of that stuff got a lot more

7698
02:13:04,709 --> 02:13:04,719
and all of that stuff got a lot more
 

7699
02:13:04,719 --> 02:13:07,350
and all of that stuff got a lot more
difficult because i didn't

7700
02:13:07,350 --> 02:13:07,360
difficult because i didn't
 

7701
02:13:07,360 --> 02:13:10,069
difficult because i didn't
i didn't do it ever look you know it's a

7702
02:13:10,069 --> 02:13:10,079
i didn't do it ever look you know it's a
 

7703
02:13:10,079 --> 02:13:11,750
i didn't do it ever look you know it's a
little bit like

7704
02:13:11,750 --> 02:13:11,760
little bit like
 

7705
02:13:11,760 --> 02:13:13,510
little bit like
uh if you're you know if you're a

7706
02:13:13,510 --> 02:13:13,520
uh if you're you know if you're a
 

7707
02:13:13,520 --> 02:13:14,790
uh if you're you know if you're a
violinist and you don't touch your

7708
02:13:14,790 --> 02:13:14,800
violinist and you don't touch your
 

7709
02:13:14,800 --> 02:13:15,430
violinist and you don't touch your
violin

7710
02:13:15,430 --> 02:13:15,440
violin
 

7711
02:13:15,440 --> 02:13:18,229
violin
regularly for 15 years you come back to

7712
02:13:18,229 --> 02:13:18,239
regularly for 15 years you come back to
 

7713
02:13:18,239 --> 02:13:20,069
regularly for 15 years you come back to
it you pretty much know the pieces sort

7714
02:13:20,069 --> 02:13:20,079
it you pretty much know the pieces sort
 

7715
02:13:20,079 --> 02:13:21,270
it you pretty much know the pieces sort
of but there's lots of stuff that's

7716
02:13:21,270 --> 02:13:21,280
of but there's lots of stuff that's
 

7717
02:13:21,280 --> 02:13:22,950
of but there's lots of stuff that's
missing your tone is off and that kind

7718
02:13:22,950 --> 02:13:22,960
missing your tone is off and that kind
 

7719
02:13:22,960 --> 02:13:23,910
missing your tone is off and that kind
of stuff

7720
02:13:23,910 --> 02:13:23,920
of stuff
 

7721
02:13:23,920 --> 02:13:25,990
of stuff
i would say i've got i'll get the ship

7722
02:13:25,990 --> 02:13:26,000
i would say i've got i'll get the ship
 

7723
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:27,430
i would say i've got i'll get the ship
to the harbor and it'll

7724
02:13:27,430 --> 02:13:27,440
to the harbor and it'll
 

7725
02:13:27,440 --> 02:13:30,149
to the harbor and it'll
require a tugboat probably to get it in

7726
02:13:30,149 --> 02:13:30,159
require a tugboat probably to get it in
 

7727
02:13:30,159 --> 02:13:31,750
require a tugboat probably to get it in
and if the tugboat doesn't show up then

7728
02:13:31,750 --> 02:13:31,760
and if the tugboat doesn't show up then
 

7729
02:13:31,760 --> 02:13:32,870
and if the tugboat doesn't show up then
i'll pilot the

7730
02:13:32,870 --> 02:13:32,880
i'll pilot the
 

7731
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:34,550
i'll pilot the
thing right into the dock myself but

7732
02:13:34,550 --> 02:13:34,560
thing right into the dock myself but
 

7733
02:13:34,560 --> 02:13:36,470
thing right into the dock myself but
it's not a big deal i think that

7734
02:13:36,470 --> 02:13:36,480
it's not a big deal i think that
 

7735
02:13:36,480 --> 02:13:38,510
it's not a big deal i think that
it is essentially complete

7736
02:13:38,510 --> 02:13:38,520
it is essentially complete
 

7737
02:13:38,520 --> 02:13:39,750
it is essentially complete
psychologically

7738
02:13:39,750 --> 02:13:39,760
psychologically
 

7739
02:13:39,760 --> 02:13:42,550
psychologically
just as a human being this is uh i

7740
02:13:42,550 --> 02:13:42,560
just as a human being this is uh i
 

7741
02:13:42,560 --> 02:13:43,430
just as a human being this is uh i
remember

7742
02:13:43,430 --> 02:13:43,440
remember
 

7743
02:13:43,440 --> 02:13:46,629
remember
perhaps by accident but maybe there's no

7744
02:13:46,629 --> 02:13:46,639
perhaps by accident but maybe there's no
 

7745
02:13:46,639 --> 02:13:48,470
perhaps by accident but maybe there's no
accidents in the universe

7746
02:13:48,470 --> 02:13:48,480
accidents in the universe
 

7747
02:13:48,480 --> 02:13:51,510
accidents in the universe
i was tuned in i don't remember where on

7748
02:13:51,510 --> 02:13:51,520
i was tuned in i don't remember where on
 

7749
02:13:51,520 --> 02:13:52,550
i was tuned in i don't remember where on
april 1st

7750
02:13:52,550 --> 02:13:52,560
april 1st
 

7751
02:13:52,560 --> 02:13:57,030
april 1st
yeah to you uh oh i think i need discord

7752
02:13:57,030 --> 02:13:57,040
yeah to you uh oh i think i need discord
 

7753
02:13:57,040 --> 02:13:59,830
yeah to you uh oh i think i need discord
yeah uh kind of thinking about thinking

7754
02:13:59,830 --> 02:13:59,840
yeah uh kind of thinking about thinking
 

7755
02:13:59,840 --> 02:14:01,510
yeah uh kind of thinking about thinking
through this release i mean it wasn't

7756
02:14:01,510 --> 02:14:01,520
through this release i mean it wasn't
 

7757
02:14:01,520 --> 02:14:02,629
through this release i mean it wasn't
like

7758
02:14:02,629 --> 02:14:02,639
like
 

7759
02:14:02,639 --> 02:14:04,390
like
uh it wasn't obvious that you were going

7760
02:14:04,390 --> 02:14:04,400
uh it wasn't obvious that you were going
 

7761
02:14:04,400 --> 02:14:05,669
uh it wasn't obvious that you were going
to do it you were thinking through it

7762
02:14:05,669 --> 02:14:05,679
to do it you were thinking through it
 

7763
02:14:05,679 --> 02:14:07,270
to do it you were thinking through it
and i remember there was

7764
02:14:07,270 --> 02:14:07,280
and i remember there was
 

7765
02:14:07,280 --> 02:14:09,589
and i remember there was
intellectual personal psychological

7766
02:14:09,589 --> 02:14:09,599
intellectual personal psychological
 

7767
02:14:09,599 --> 02:14:10,629
intellectual personal psychological
struggle with this

7768
02:14:10,629 --> 02:14:10,639
struggle with this
 

7769
02:14:10,639 --> 02:14:12,069
struggle with this
yeah right well because i did i thought

7770
02:14:12,069 --> 02:14:12,079
yeah right well because i did i thought
 

7771
02:14:12,079 --> 02:14:13,750
yeah right well because i did i thought
it was dangerous if this

7772
02:14:13,750 --> 02:14:13,760
it was dangerous if this
 

7773
02:14:13,760 --> 02:14:15,430
it was dangerous if this
turns out to be right i don't know what

7774
02:14:15,430 --> 02:14:15,440
turns out to be right i don't know what
 

7775
02:14:15,440 --> 02:14:17,990
turns out to be right i don't know what
it unlocks

7776
02:14:17,990 --> 02:14:18,000
it unlocks
 

7777
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:21,990
it unlocks
i'm if it's wrong i think i

7778
02:14:21,990 --> 02:14:22,000
i'm if it's wrong i think i
 

7779
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,550
i'm if it's wrong i think i
understand where we are if it's wrong

7780
02:14:24,550 --> 02:14:24,560
understand where we are if it's wrong
 

7781
02:14:24,560 --> 02:14:27,270
understand where we are if it's wrong
it'll be the first

7782
02:14:27,270 --> 02:14:27,280
it'll be the first
 

7783
02:14:27,280 --> 02:14:29,910
it'll be the first
fool's gold that really looks like a

7784
02:14:29,910 --> 02:14:29,920
fool's gold that really looks like a
 

7785
02:14:29,920 --> 02:14:33,189
fool's gold that really looks like a
theory of everything

7786
02:14:33,189 --> 02:14:33,199

 

7787
02:14:33,199 --> 02:14:35,510

it'll be the iron pyrites of physics and

7788
02:14:35,510 --> 02:14:35,520
it'll be the iron pyrites of physics and
 

7789
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:37,589
it'll be the iron pyrites of physics and
we haven't even had fool's gold in my

7790
02:14:37,589 --> 02:14:37,599
we haven't even had fool's gold in my
 

7791
02:14:37,599 --> 02:14:39,510
we haven't even had fool's gold in my
opinion yet

7792
02:14:39,510 --> 02:14:39,520
opinion yet
 

7793
02:14:39,520 --> 02:14:42,149
opinion yet
got it so what is your intuition why

7794
02:14:42,149 --> 02:14:42,159
got it so what is your intuition why
 

7795
02:14:42,159 --> 02:14:43,430
got it so what is your intuition why
this

7796
02:14:43,430 --> 02:14:43,440
this
 

7797
02:14:43,440 --> 02:14:46,470
this
looks right to you like why it feels

7798
02:14:46,470 --> 02:14:46,480
looks right to you like why it feels
 

7799
02:14:46,480 --> 02:14:46,870
looks right to you like why it feels
like

7800
02:14:46,870 --> 02:14:46,880
like
 

7801
02:14:46,880 --> 02:14:49,750
like
it would be if if wrong i can say it

7802
02:14:49,750 --> 02:14:49,760
it would be if if wrong i can say it
 

7803
02:14:49,760 --> 02:14:50,950
it would be if if wrong i can say it
very simply

7804
02:14:50,950 --> 02:14:50,960
very simply
 

7805
02:14:50,960 --> 02:14:53,830
very simply
it's way smarter than i am can you break

7806
02:14:53,830 --> 02:14:53,840
it's way smarter than i am can you break
 

7807
02:14:53,840 --> 02:14:55,030
it's way smarter than i am can you break
that apart a little more

7808
02:14:55,030 --> 02:14:55,040
that apart a little more
 

7809
02:14:55,040 --> 02:14:56,950
that apart a little more
like every time you poke at it it's

7810
02:14:56,950 --> 02:14:56,960
like every time you poke at it it's
 

7811
02:14:56,960 --> 02:14:58,709
like every time you poke at it it's
giving you intuitions that follow with

the currently known physics well let's
 

7817
02:15:00,400 --> 02:15:02,229
the currently known physics well let's
put it in computer science terms

7818
02:15:02,229 --> 02:15:02,239
put it in computer science terms
 

7819
02:15:02,239 --> 02:15:04,470
put it in computer science terms
yes please okay there's a concept of

7820
02:15:04,470 --> 02:15:04,480
yes please okay there's a concept of
 

7821
02:15:04,480 --> 02:15:06,709
yes please okay there's a concept of
technical debt that computer scientists

7822
02:15:06,709 --> 02:15:06,719
technical debt that computer scientists
 

7823
02:15:06,719 --> 02:15:09,109
technical debt that computer scientists
struggle with as you commit crimes you

7824
02:15:09,109 --> 02:15:09,119
struggle with as you commit crimes you
 

7825
02:15:09,119 --> 02:15:11,030
struggle with as you commit crimes you
have to pay those crimes back at a later

7826
02:15:11,030 --> 02:15:11,040
have to pay those crimes back at a later
 

7827
02:15:11,040 --> 02:15:12,470
have to pay those crimes back at a later

in general most of the problem with

7830
02:15:14,310 --> 02:15:14,320
in general most of the problem with
 

7831
02:15:14,320 --> 02:15:16,310
in general most of the problem with
physical theories is that

7832
02:15:16,310 --> 02:15:16,320
physical theories is that
 

7833
02:15:16,320 --> 02:15:19,589
physical theories is that
as you try to do something that matches

7834
02:15:19,589 --> 02:15:19,599
as you try to do something that matches
 

7835
02:15:19,599 --> 02:15:21,990
as you try to do something that matches
reality you usually have to go into some

7836
02:15:21,990 --> 02:15:22,000
reality you usually have to go into some
 

7837
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:22,950
reality you usually have to go into some
structure

7838
02:15:22,950 --> 02:15:22,960
structure
 

7839
02:15:22,960 --> 02:15:25,669
structure
that gets you farther away and your hope

7840
02:15:25,669 --> 02:15:25,679
that gets you farther away and your hope
 

7841
02:15:25,679 --> 02:15:26,709
that gets you farther away and your hope
is is that you're going to be able to

7842
02:15:26,709 --> 02:15:26,719
is is that you're going to be able to
 

7843
02:15:26,719 --> 02:15:29,350
is is that you're going to be able to
pay back the technical debt and

7844
02:15:29,350 --> 02:15:29,360
pay back the technical debt and
 

7845
02:15:29,360 --> 02:15:31,109
pay back the technical debt and
in general these will wind up as check

7846
02:15:31,109 --> 02:15:31,119
in general these will wind up as check
 

7847
02:15:31,119 --> 02:15:32,950
in general these will wind up as check

02:15:34,470 --> 02:15:34,480
or like you're funding a startup and
 

7851
02:15:34,480 --> 02:15:36,629
or like you're funding a startup and
they're too many pivots

they're too many pivots

they're too many pivots
right so you keep adding epicycles in

02:15:39,030 --> 02:15:39,040
right so you keep adding epicycles in

right so you keep adding epicycles in

order to
to cover things that have gone wrong

02:15:43,910 --> 02:15:43,920
to cover things that have gone wrong
 

7859
02:15:43,920 --> 02:15:47,270
to cover things that have gone wrong
my belief is is that

7860
02:15:47,270 --> 02:15:47,280
my belief is is that
 

7861
02:15:47,280 --> 02:15:51,430
my belief is is that
this thing represents something like a

7862
02:15:51,430 --> 02:15:51,440
this thing represents something like a
 

7863
02:15:51,440 --> 02:15:51,990
this thing represents something like a
summit

7864
02:15:51,990 --> 02:15:52,000
summit
 

7865
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:55,589
summit
to me and i'm very proud of having found

7866
02:15:55,589 --> 02:15:55,599
to me and i'm very proud of having found
 

7867
02:15:55,599 --> 02:15:58,709
to me and i'm very proud of having found
a route up this summit

7868
02:15:58,709 --> 02:15:58,719
a route up this summit
 

7869
02:15:58,719 --> 02:16:01,589
a route up this summit
but the route is what's due to me the

7870
02:16:01,589 --> 02:16:01,599
but the route is what's due to me the
 

7871
02:16:01,599 --> 02:16:03,270
but the route is what's due to me the
summit can't possibly

7872
02:16:03,270 --> 02:16:03,280
summit can't possibly
 

7873
02:16:03,280 --> 02:16:06,550
summit can't possibly
be due to me you know

7874
02:16:06,550 --> 02:16:06,560
be due to me you know
 

7875
02:16:06,560 --> 02:16:10,870
be due to me you know
like edmund hillary and tenzing norgay

7876
02:16:10,870 --> 02:16:10,880
like edmund hillary and tenzing norgay
 

7877
02:16:10,880 --> 02:16:13,350
like edmund hillary and tenzing norgay
did not create mount everest they know

7878
02:16:13,350 --> 02:16:13,360
did not create mount everest they know
 

7879
02:16:13,360 --> 02:16:14,470
did not create mount everest they know
that they didn't create math

7880
02:16:14,470 --> 02:16:14,480
that they didn't create math
 

7881
02:16:14,480 --> 02:16:18,629
that they didn't create math
they figured out a way up

7882
02:16:18,629 --> 02:16:18,639
they figured out a way up
 

7883
02:16:18,639 --> 02:16:20,709
they figured out a way up
you got to tell me what uh mon everest

7884
02:16:20,709 --> 02:16:20,719
you got to tell me what uh mon everest
 

7885
02:16:20,719 --> 02:16:21,830
you got to tell me what uh mon everest
is in this metaphor

7886
02:16:21,830 --> 02:16:21,840
is in this metaphor
 

7887
02:16:21,840 --> 02:16:23,830
is in this metaphor
relative and also connected to the

relative and also connected to the
 

7889
02:16:23,840 --> 02:16:25,510
relative and also connected to the
technical debt so technical debt is an

technical debt so technical debt is an
 

7891
02:16:25,520 --> 02:16:27,990
technical debt so technical debt is an

7894
02:16:30,470 --> 02:16:30,480
you you'll eventually have to pay it
 

7895
02:16:30,480 --> 02:16:33,349
you you'll eventually have to pay it
are you saying in the in the ascent that

7896
02:16:33,349 --> 02:16:33,359
are you saying in the in the ascent that
 

7897
02:16:33,359 --> 02:16:34,230
are you saying in the in the ascent that
you're seeing

02:16:34,230 --> 02:16:34,240
you're seeing
 

7899
02:16:34,240 --> 02:16:36,709
you're seeing
now the theory is you do not have much

7900
02:16:36,709 --> 02:16:36,719
now the theory is you do not have much
 

7901
02:16:36,719 --> 02:16:38,309
now the theory is you do not have much
technical debt well that's right i think

7902
02:16:38,309 --> 02:16:38,319
technical debt well that's right i think
 

7903
02:16:38,319 --> 02:16:42,070
technical debt well that's right i think
that what happens is that early on

7904
02:16:42,070 --> 02:16:42,080
that what happens is that early on
 

7905
02:16:42,080 --> 02:16:45,509
that what happens is that early on
what i would say is i believe now

7906
02:16:45,509 --> 02:16:45,519
what i would say is i believe now
 

7907
02:16:45,519 --> 02:16:49,110
what i would say is i believe now
that the physics community has said

7908
02:16:49,110 --> 02:16:49,120
that the physics community has said
 

7909
02:16:49,120 --> 02:16:52,309
that the physics community has said
many things incorrectly about the

7910
02:16:52,309 --> 02:16:52,319
many things incorrectly about the
 

7911
02:16:52,319 --> 02:16:52,870
many things incorrectly about the
current

02:16:55,519 --> 02:16:57,589
state of the universe they're not wildly
off which is why

7916
02:16:57,589 --> 02:16:57,599
off which is why
 

7917
02:16:57,599 --> 02:16:59,349
off which is why
like for example the claim is that there

7918
02:16:59,349 --> 02:16:59,359
like for example the claim is that there
 

7919
02:16:59,359 --> 02:17:01,270
like for example the claim is that there
are three generations of matter

7920
02:17:01,270 --> 02:17:01,280
are three generations of matter
 

7921
02:17:01,280 --> 02:17:02,549
are three generations of matter
i do not believe that there are three

7922
02:17:02,549 --> 02:17:02,559
i do not believe that there are three
 

7923
02:17:02,559 --> 02:17:03,910
i do not believe that there are three
generations matter i believe that there

7924
02:17:03,910 --> 02:17:03,920
generations matter i believe that there
 

7925
02:17:03,920 --> 02:17:05,429
generations matter i believe that there
are two generations of matter and there

7926
02:17:05,429 --> 02:17:05,439
are two generations of matter and there
 

7927
02:17:05,439 --> 02:17:07,349
are two generations of matter and there
is a third

7928
02:17:07,349 --> 02:17:07,359
is a third
 

7929
02:17:07,359 --> 02:17:10,870
is a third
collection that looks like a generation

7930
02:17:10,870 --> 02:17:10,880
collection that looks like a generation
 

7931
02:17:10,880 --> 02:17:11,669

that's the puzzle that i think has just

that's the puzzle that i think has just

8159
02:21:10,800 --> 02:21:12,230
been wanting and i i'll be honest i'm
really surprised

8160
02:21:12,230 --> 02:21:12,240
really surprised
 

8161
02:21:12,240 --> 02:21:18,070
really surprised
that the theoretical physics community

8162
02:21:18,070 --> 02:21:18,080

 

8163
02:21:18,080 --> 02:21:20,950

didn't even get up on their high horse

didn't even get up on their high horse
 

8165
02:21:20,960 --> 02:21:21,990
didn't even get up on their high horse
and say this is

8166
02:21:21,990 --> 02:21:22,000
and say this is
 

8167
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:25,110
and say this is
the most stupid nonsense imaginable

8168
02:21:25,110 --> 02:21:25,120
the most stupid nonsense imaginable
 

8169
02:21:25,120 --> 02:21:27,190
the most stupid nonsense imaginable
because clearly i'm i always say i'm not

02:21:27,190 --> 02:21:27,200
because clearly i'm i always say i'm not

because clearly i'm i always say i'm not

a physicist
 

8173
02:21:28,399 --> 02:21:30,630
a physicist
so i'm just a i'm i'm i'm an amateur

8174
02:21:30,630 --> 02:21:30,640
so i'm just a i'm i'm i'm an amateur
 

8175
02:21:30,640 --> 02:21:33,750
so i'm just a i'm i'm i'm an amateur

so in your journey of releasing this and

8178
02:21:36,150 --> 02:21:36,160
so in your journey of releasing this and
 

8179
02:21:36,160 --> 02:21:36,870
so in your journey of releasing this and
i'm sure that

8180
02:21:36,870 --> 02:21:36,880
i'm sure that
 

8181
02:21:36,880 --> 02:21:40,230
i'm sure that
further maybe uh it will be another

8182
02:21:40,230 --> 02:21:40,240
further maybe uh it will be another
 

8183
02:21:40,240 --> 02:21:42,070
further maybe uh it will be another

american tradition on april 1st
 

8185
02:21:42,080 --> 02:21:46,309
american tradition on april 1st
that will continue for years uh

8186
02:21:46,309 --> 02:21:46,319
that will continue for years uh
 

8187
02:21:46,319 --> 02:21:50,070
that will continue for years uh
in my uh there's sort of

8188
02:21:50,070 --> 02:21:50,080
in my uh there's sort of
 

8189
02:21:50,080 --> 02:21:54,870
in my uh there's sort of
uh crumbs along the way that i'm hoping

8190
02:21:54,870 --> 02:21:54,880
uh crumbs along the way that i'm hoping
 

8191
02:21:54,880 --> 02:21:58,630
uh crumbs along the way that i'm hoping
to uh collect in my naive view of things

8192
02:21:58,630 --> 02:21:58,640
to uh collect in my naive view of things
 

8193
02:21:58,640 --> 02:22:02,230
to uh collect in my naive view of things
of the beauty that

8194
02:22:02,230 --> 02:22:02,240
of the beauty that
 

8195
02:22:02,240 --> 02:22:05,349
of the beauty that
in your geometric view of the universe

8196
02:22:05,349 --> 02:22:05,359
in your geometric view of the universe
 

8197
02:22:05,359 --> 02:22:08,950
in your geometric view of the universe
so uh one question

8198
02:22:08,950 --> 02:22:08,960
so uh one question
 

8199
02:22:08,960 --> 02:22:13,590
so uh one question
i'd like to ask is um

8200
02:22:13,590 --> 02:22:13,600

 

8201
02:22:13,600 --> 02:22:15,910

if you were to challenge me to visualize

8202
02:22:15,910 --> 02:22:15,920
if you were to challenge me to visualize
 

8203
02:22:15,920 --> 02:22:17,429
if you were to challenge me to visualize
something beautiful

8204
02:22:17,429 --> 02:22:17,439
something beautiful
 

8205
02:22:17,439 --> 02:22:19,270
something beautiful
something important about geometric

8206
02:22:19,270 --> 02:22:19,280
something important about geometric
 

8207
02:22:19,280 --> 02:22:21,349
something important about geometric
community in my struggle to

8208
02:22:21,349 --> 02:22:21,359
community in my struggle to
 

8209
02:22:21,359 --> 02:22:23,830
community in my struggle to
appreciate some of its beauty from the

8210
02:22:23,830 --> 02:22:23,840
appreciate some of its beauty from the
 

8211
02:22:23,840 --> 02:22:25,590
appreciate some of its beauty from the
outsider's perspective

8212
02:22:25,590 --> 02:22:25,600
outsider's perspective
 

8213
02:22:25,600 --> 02:22:28,950
outsider's perspective
what would that be thing be interesting

8214
02:22:28,950 --> 02:22:28,960
what would that be thing be interesting
 

8215
02:22:28,960 --> 02:22:29,510
what would that be thing be interesting
question

8216
02:22:29,510 --> 02:22:29,520
question
 

8217
02:22:29,520 --> 02:22:31,750
question
perhaps we can both have a journey

8218
02:22:31,750 --> 02:22:31,760
perhaps we can both have a journey
 

8219
02:22:31,760 --> 02:22:34,950
perhaps we can both have a journey
towards april first

8220
02:22:34,950 --> 02:22:34,960

 

8221
02:22:34,960 --> 02:22:38,469

take a look at that

8222
02:22:38,469 --> 02:22:38,479

 

8223
02:22:38,479 --> 02:22:40,070

02:22:40,080 --> 02:22:41,750
some kind of a scrunchie that i picked
up on melrose

circle
 

8257
02:23:18,479 --> 02:23:21,030
circle
and there's a circle above every point

8258
02:23:21,030 --> 02:23:21,040
and there's a circle above every point
 

8259
02:23:21,040 --> 02:23:22,469
and there's a circle above every point
in the circle represented by those

imagine if you will that

imagine if you will that

imagine if you will that
we took a rubber band

8266
02:23:31,510 --> 02:23:31,520
we took a rubber band
 

8267
02:23:31,520 --> 02:23:33,510
we took a rubber band
and placed it around here and decided

8268
02:23:33,510 --> 02:23:33,520
and placed it around here and decided
 

8269
02:23:33,520 --> 02:23:35,590
and placed it around here and decided
that that was a function

8270
02:23:35,590 --> 02:23:35,600
that that was a function
 

8271
02:23:35,600 --> 02:23:40,309
that that was a function
from the circle into this circle that is

8272
02:23:40,309 --> 02:23:40,319
from the circle into this circle that is
 

8273
02:23:40,319 --> 02:23:42,389
from the circle into this circle that is
representing a y-axis that's wrapped

02:23:44,080 --> 02:23:45,670
around itself
well you would have an idea of what it

8278
02:23:45,670 --> 02:23:45,680
well you would have an idea of what it
 

8279
02:23:45,680 --> 02:23:47,670
well you would have an idea of what it
means for a function to be constant

8280
02:23:47,670 --> 02:23:47,680
means for a function to be constant
 

8281
02:23:47,680 --> 02:23:49,990
means for a function to be constant
if it just went all around the outside

8282
02:23:49,990 --> 02:23:50,000
if it just went all around the outside
 

8283
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,309
if it just went all around the outside
but what happens if i

8284
02:23:52,309 --> 02:23:52,319
but what happens if i
 

8285
02:23:52,319 --> 02:23:54,309
but what happens if i
turn this a little bit then the function

8286
02:23:54,309 --> 02:23:54,319
turn this a little bit then the function
 

8287
02:23:54,319 --> 02:23:55,750
turn this a little bit then the function
would be mostly constant it would have a

8288
02:23:55,750 --> 02:23:55,760
would be mostly constant it would have a
 

8289
02:23:55,760 --> 02:23:56,950
would be mostly constant it would have a
little place where it dipped

8290
02:23:56,950 --> 02:23:56,960
little place where it dipped
 

8291
02:23:56,960 --> 02:23:59,750
little place where it dipped
and it went back it turns out that you

8292
02:23:59,750 --> 02:23:59,760
and it went back it turns out that you
 

8293
02:23:59,760 --> 02:24:00,389
and it went back it turns out that you
can

8294
02:24:00,389 --> 02:24:00,399
can
 

8295
02:24:00,399 --> 02:24:04,150
can
transform that function and transform

8296
02:24:04,150 --> 02:24:04,160
transform that function and transform
 

8297
02:24:04,160 --> 02:24:05,110
transform that function and transform
the derivative

8298
02:24:05,110 --> 02:24:05,120
the derivative
 

8299
02:24:05,120 --> 02:24:07,910
the derivative
that says that function is equal to zero

8300
02:24:07,910 --> 02:24:07,920
that says that function is equal to zero
 

8301
02:24:07,920 --> 02:24:09,830
that says that function is equal to zero
when i take its derivative

8302
02:24:09,830 --> 02:24:09,840
when i take its derivative
 

8303
02:24:09,840 --> 02:24:11,990
when i take its derivative
at the same time that's what a gauge

so that if a function was constant under

so that if a function was constant under

one derivative
 

8351
02:25:03,600 --> 02:25:06,389
one derivative
then the new function is constant under

8352
02:25:06,389 --> 02:25:06,399
then the new function is constant under
 

8353
02:25:06,399 --> 02:25:07,590
then the new function is constant under
the new derivative

the new derivative
transformed in the same fashion and

transformed in the same fashion and
 

8357
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:11,590

would you put that under the category of

would you put that under the category of

02:25:11,600 --> 02:25:13,429
would you put that under the category of

02:25:53,750 --> 02:25:53,760
you can object in some ways but

02:25:53,760 --> 02:25:55,190
you can object in some ways but
basically a gauge theory

8400
02:25:55,190 --> 02:25:55,200
basically a gauge theory
 

8401
02:25:55,200 --> 02:25:59,270
basically a gauge theory
is the way in which you can translate uh

8402
02:25:59,270 --> 02:25:59,280
is the way in which you can translate uh
 

8403
02:25:59,280 --> 02:26:01,670
is the way in which you can translate uh
a shift in the definition of the

8404
02:26:01,670 --> 02:26:01,680
a shift in the definition of the
 

8405
02:26:01,680 --> 02:26:02,950
a shift in the definition of the
functions and the shift

8406
02:26:02,950 --> 02:26:02,960
functions and the shift
 

8407
02:26:02,960 --> 02:26:04,469
functions and the shift
of the definition of the derivatives so

8408
02:26:04,469 --> 02:26:04,479
of the definition of the derivatives so
 

8409
02:26:04,479 --> 02:26:06,150
of the definition of the derivatives so
that the underlying physics is not

8410
02:26:06,150 --> 02:26:06,160
that the underlying physics is not
 

8411

that the underlying physics is not
harmed

8413
02:26:07,359 --> 02:26:09,750
harmed
or changed so you have to do both at the

8414
02:26:09,750 --> 02:26:09,760
or changed so you have to do both at the
 

8415
02:26:09,760 --> 02:26:10,469
or changed so you have to do both at the
same time

8416
02:26:10,469 --> 02:26:10,479
same time
 

8417
02:26:10,479 --> 02:26:12,469
same time

make sense somehow i i personally think
we better get tougher or we're going to

especially given that as we mentioned
before on joe rogan

8552
02:28:35,110 --> 02:28:35,120
before on joe rogan
 

8553
02:28:35,120 --> 02:28:37,190
before on joe rogan
you're flawed in that just like all

8554
02:28:37,190 --> 02:28:37,200
you're flawed in that just like all
 

8555
02:28:37,200 --> 02:28:39,670
you're flawed in that just like all
humans you're mortal

8556
02:28:39,670 --> 02:28:39,680
humans you're mortal
 

8557
02:28:39,680 --> 02:28:42,950
humans you're mortal
well at some level i guess one of

8558
02:28:42,950 --> 02:28:42,960
well at some level i guess one of
 

8559
02:28:42,960 --> 02:28:45,510
well at some level i guess one of
my issues is that i've got to stop

8560
02:28:45,510 --> 02:28:45,520
my issues is that i've got to stop
 

8561
02:28:45,520 --> 02:28:47,110
my issues is that i've got to stop
giving quite so much advice

8562
02:28:47,110 --> 02:28:47,120
giving quite so much advice
 

8563
02:28:47,120 --> 02:28:50,389
giving quite so much advice
uh early on i was very worried

8564
02:28:50,389 --> 02:28:50,399
uh early on i was very worried
 

8565
02:28:50,399 --> 02:28:52,710
uh early on i was very worried
that i could see zeb's abilities and i

8566
02:28:52,710 --> 02:28:52,720
that i could see zeb's abilities and i
 

8567
02:28:52,720 --> 02:28:54,230
that i could see zeb's abilities and i
could see his

8568
02:28:54,230 --> 02:28:54,240
could see his
 

8569
02:28:54,240 --> 02:28:56,389
could see his
challenges and i saw them in terms of

8570
02:28:56,389 --> 02:28:56,399
challenges and i saw them in terms of
 

8571
02:28:56,399 --> 02:28:57,670
challenges and i saw them in terms of
myself

8572
02:28:57,670 --> 02:28:57,680
myself
 

8573
02:28:57,680 --> 02:29:00,950
myself
so a certain amount of zev rhymes with

8574
02:29:00,950 --> 02:29:00,960
so a certain amount of zev rhymes with
 

8575
02:29:00,960 --> 02:29:04,309
so a certain amount of zev rhymes with
whatever i went through as a kid and

8576
02:29:04,309 --> 02:29:04,319
whatever i went through as a kid and
 

8577
02:29:04,319 --> 02:29:06,230
whatever i went through as a kid and
i don't want to doom him to the same

8578
02:29:06,230 --> 02:29:06,240
i don't want to doom him to the same
 

8579
02:29:06,240 --> 02:29:07,750
i don't want to doom him to the same
outcomes that

8580
02:29:07,750 --> 02:29:07,760
outcomes that
 

8581
02:29:07,760 --> 02:29:09,750
outcomes that
that sufficed for me i think that he's

8582
02:29:09,750 --> 02:29:09,760
that sufficed for me i think that he's
 

8583
02:29:09,760 --> 02:29:11,590
that sufficed for me i think that he's
got a much better head on his shoulders

8584
02:29:11,590 --> 02:29:11,600
got a much better head on his shoulders
 

8585
02:29:11,600 --> 02:29:14,630
got a much better head on his shoulders
at age 15 he's much better adjusted

8586
02:29:14,630 --> 02:29:14,640
at age 15 he's much better adjusted
 

8587
02:29:14,640 --> 02:29:18,389
at age 15 he's much better adjusted
and in part it's important for me to

8588
02:29:18,389 --> 02:29:18,399
and in part it's important for me to
 

8589
02:29:18,399 --> 02:29:20,710
and in part it's important for me to
recognize that because i think i did a

8590
02:29:20,710 --> 02:29:20,720
recognize that because i think i did a
 

8591
02:29:20,720 --> 02:29:22,950
recognize that because i think i did a
reasonably decent job early on i don't

8592
02:29:22,950 --> 02:29:22,960
reasonably decent job early on i don't
 

8593
02:29:22,960 --> 02:29:23,910
reasonably decent job early on i don't
need

8594
02:29:23,910 --> 02:29:23,920
need
 

8595
02:29:23,920 --> 02:29:27,510
need
to get this part right and

8596
02:29:27,510 --> 02:29:27,520
to get this part right and
 

8597
02:29:27,520 --> 02:29:31,030
to get this part right and
you know i'm looking at at zev's

8598
02:29:31,030 --> 02:29:31,040
you know i'm looking at at zev's
 

8599
02:29:31,040 --> 02:29:33,190
you know i'm looking at at zev's
trajectory and saying

8600
02:29:33,190 --> 02:29:33,200
trajectory and saying
 

8601
02:29:33,200 --> 02:29:35,990
trajectory and saying
you're going to need to be incredibly

8602
02:29:35,990 --> 02:29:36,000
you're going to need to be incredibly
 

8603
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,790
you're going to need to be incredibly
even pathologically self-confident

8604
02:29:38,790 --> 02:29:38,800
even pathologically self-confident
 

8605
02:29:38,800 --> 02:29:40,550
even pathologically self-confident
the antidote for that is going to be

8606
02:29:40,550 --> 02:29:40,560
the antidote for that is going to be
 

8607
02:29:40,560 --> 02:29:41,750
the antidote for that is going to be
something you're going to need to carry

8608
02:29:41,750 --> 02:29:41,760
something you're going to need to carry
 

8609
02:29:41,760 --> 02:29:45,429
something you're going to need to carry
on board which is radical humility

8610
02:29:45,429 --> 02:29:45,439
on board which is radical humility
 

8611
02:29:45,439 --> 02:29:46,389
on board which is radical humility
and you're going to have to have those

8612
02:29:46,389 --> 02:29:46,399
and you're going to have to have those
 

8613
02:29:46,399 --> 02:29:48,309
and you're going to have to have those
in a dialectical tension which is never

8614
02:29:48,309 --> 02:29:48,319
in a dialectical tension which is never
 

8615
02:29:48,319 --> 02:29:50,790
in a dialectical tension which is never
resolved which is a huge burden

8616
02:29:50,790 --> 02:29:50,800
resolved which is a huge burden
 

8617
02:29:50,800 --> 02:29:53,190
resolved which is a huge burden
you are going to have to forgive people

8618
02:29:53,190 --> 02:29:53,200
you are going to have to forgive people
 

8619
02:29:53,200 --> 02:29:55,270
you are going to have to forgive people
who do not appreciate your gifts

8620

8623
02:29:57,359 --> 02:29:59,110
because your gifts are clearly evident
and many people will have to pretend not

8624
02:29:59,110 --> 02:29:59,120
and many people will have to pretend not
 

8625
02:29:59,120 --> 02:30:00,710
and many people will have to pretend not
to see them because if they

8717
02:31:43,359 --> 02:31:44,870
is is something for for which we must
budget because our parents

8718

budget because our parents
 

8719
02:31:44,880 --> 02:31:47,750
budget because our parents
play a role in our lives uh of which

they're
they're not worthy and they devote

they're not worthy and they devote
 

8725
02:31:50,240 --> 02:31:51,429
they're not worthy and they devote
themselves to

8726
02:31:51,429 --> 02:31:51,439
themselves to
