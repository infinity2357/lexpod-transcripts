01:15:10,010 --> 01:15:10,020
definitely definitely well if we look a
 

3827
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:12,350
definitely definitely well if we look a
little bit more short term people speak

3828
01:15:12,350 --> 01:15:12,360
little bit more short term people speak
 

3829
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:14,450
little bit more short term people speak
about a one-state solution a two-state

3830
01:15:14,450 --> 01:15:14,460
about a one-state solution a two-state
 

3831
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:15,709
about a one-state solution a two-state
solution

3832
01:15:15,709 --> 01:15:15,719
solution
 

3833
01:15:15,719 --> 01:15:18,770

a possible future with a two-state
 

3839
01:15:22,739 --> 01:15:24,770
a possible future with a two-state
solution well there's your Palestine in

3840

3843
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:31,250
Israel do you see a one-state solution
where there is a diversity of different

where there is a diversity of different
 

3845
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:33,950
where there is a diversity of different
peoples like in the United States and

3846
01:15:33,950 --> 01:15:33,960
peoples like in the United States and
 

3847
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:35,930

you know I don't think there's a

3852
01:15:40,669 --> 01:15:40,679
you know I don't think there's a
 

3853
01:15:40,679 --> 01:15:42,470
you know I don't think there's a
geography in which two State solution is

3854
01:15:42,470 --> 01:15:42,480
geography in which two State solution is
 

3855
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:44,330
geography in which two State solution is
is possible

3856
01:15:44,330 --> 01:15:44,340
is possible
 

3857
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:46,550
is possible
um as we said earlier swiss cheese

3858
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:46,560
um as we said earlier swiss cheese
 

3859
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:49,310
um as we said earlier swiss cheese
there's literally uh supplements all

3860
01:15:49,310 --> 01:15:49,320
there's literally uh supplements all
 

3861
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:51,229
there's literally uh supplements all
over the West Bank

3862
01:15:51,229 --> 01:15:51,239
over the West Bank
 

3863
01:15:51,239 --> 01:15:52,669
over the West Bank
um

3864
01:15:52,669 --> 01:15:52,679
um
 

3865
01:15:52,679 --> 01:15:54,649
um
and I don't think it's fair

3866
01:15:54,649 --> 01:15:54,659
and I don't think it's fair
 

3867
01:15:54,659 --> 01:15:56,870
and I don't think it's fair

um our small victory in the Israeli

4746
01:33:40,910 --> 01:33:40,920
um our small victory in the Israeli
 

4747
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:42,169
um our small victory in the Israeli
courts

4748
01:33:42,169 --> 01:33:42,179
courts
 

4749
01:33:42,179 --> 01:33:44,689

um was that they would keep us in our
 

4751

um was that they would keep us in our
homes until a land registry is completed

homes until a land registry is completed
 

4753

homes until a land registry is completed
basically it means that they have to

4754
01:33:51,110 --> 01:33:51,120
basically it means that they have to
 

4755
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:55,370
basically it means that they have to
check who owned the land prior

4756
01:33:55,370 --> 01:33:55,380
check who owned the land prior
 

4757

check who owned the land prior
um and then they could decide if or if

01:33:57,050 --> 01:33:57,060
um and then they could decide if or if
 

4759
01:33:57,060 --> 01:33:58,850
um and then they could decide if or if
the land is ours or the land belongs to

01:34:08,930 --> 01:34:08,940
um and that sounds great
 

4771
01:34:08,940 --> 01:34:11,030
um and that sounds great
on the surface but then you look at

4772
01:34:11,030 --> 01:34:11,040
on the surface but then you look at
 

4773
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:12,770
on the surface but then you look at
Israeli law you look at Israeli courts

4774
01:34:12,770 --> 01:34:12,780
Israeli law you look at Israeli courts
 

4775
01:34:12,780 --> 01:34:14,390
Israeli law you look at Israeli courts
you look at ownership and you see that

4776
01:34:14,390 --> 01:34:14,400
you look at ownership and you see that
 

4777
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:17,350
you look at ownership and you see that
oh Israelis refuse to

4778
01:34:17,350 --> 01:34:17,360
oh Israelis refuse to
 

4779
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:19,370
oh Israelis refuse to
authenticate or take into consideration

4780
01:34:19,370 --> 01:34:19,380
authenticate or take into consideration
 

4781
01:34:19,380 --> 01:34:22,129
authenticate or take into consideration
any land ownership documents from the

4782
01:34:22,129 --> 01:34:22,139
any land ownership documents from the
 

4783
01:34:22,139 --> 01:34:23,810
any land ownership documents from the
prior of the establishment of the state

4784
01:34:23,810 --> 01:34:23,820
prior of the establishment of the state
 

4785
01:34:23,820 --> 01:34:27,790
prior of the establishment of the state
so all of us in Jerusalem who have their

4786
01:34:27,790 --> 01:34:27,800
so all of us in Jerusalem who have their
 

4787
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:31,250
so all of us in Jerusalem who have their
taboo papers their ownership papers from

4788
01:34:31,250 --> 01:34:31,260
taboo papers their ownership papers from
 

4789
01:34:31,260 --> 01:34:34,610
taboo papers their ownership papers from
the ottoman era that's not legit in the

4790
01:34:34,610 --> 01:34:34,620
the ottoman era that's not legit in the
 

4791
01:34:34,620 --> 01:34:36,530
the ottoman era that's not legit in the
eyes of the Israeli court because that

4792
01:34:36,530 --> 01:34:36,540
eyes of the Israeli court because that
 

4793
01:34:36,540 --> 01:34:39,290
eyes of the Israeli court because that
existed before like your ownership Deeds

4794
01:34:39,290 --> 01:34:39,300
existed before like your ownership Deeds
 

4795
01:34:39,300 --> 01:34:41,450
existed before like your ownership Deeds
existed long before Israel even existed

4796
01:34:41,450 --> 01:34:41,460
existed long before Israel even existed
 

4797
01:34:41,460 --> 01:34:42,830
existed long before Israel even existed
so we're not going to take this into

4798
01:34:42,830 --> 01:34:42,840
so we're not going to take this into
 

4799
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:46,610
so we're not going to take this into
consideration so not to be cynical here

4800
01:34:46,610 --> 01:34:46,620
consideration so not to be cynical here
 

4801
01:34:46,620 --> 01:34:49,970
consideration so not to be cynical here
but unfortunately the the likely result

4802
01:34:49,970 --> 01:34:49,980
but unfortunately the the likely result
 

4803
01:34:49,980 --> 01:34:52,129
but unfortunately the the likely result
of the land registry is that they're

4804
01:34:52,129 --> 01:34:52,139
of the land registry is that they're
 

4805
01:34:52,139 --> 01:34:54,229
of the land registry is that they're
going to say oh all of this land belongs

4806
01:34:54,229 --> 01:34:54,239
going to say oh all of this land belongs
 

4807
01:34:54,239 --> 01:34:55,910
going to say oh all of this land belongs
to these Jewish organizations because

4808
01:34:55,910 --> 01:34:55,920
to these Jewish organizations because
 

4809
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:57,290
to these Jewish organizations because
they're not going to take any of our

4810
01:34:57,290 --> 01:34:57,300
they're not going to take any of our
 

4811
01:34:57,300 --> 01:34:59,030
they're not going to take any of our
documents into consideration

4812
01:34:59,030 --> 01:34:59,040
documents into consideration
