high school that was pretty formative
 

41
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,790
high school that was pretty formative
for me because it exposed the

42
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:54,800
for me because it exposed the
 

43
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,069
for me because it exposed the
interestingness of primitives and

57
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,800
logic versus robots
yeah the robots came because my first

58
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:15,810
yeah the robots came because my first
 

59
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,390
yeah the robots came because my first
job so I finished an undergraduate

60
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:17,400
job so I finished an undergraduate
 

61
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,789
job so I finished an undergraduate
degree in philosophy at Stanford and was

62
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:19,799
degree in philosophy at Stanford and was
 

63
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,280
degree in philosophy at Stanford and was
about to finish master's in computer

64
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:22,290
about to finish master's in computer
 

65
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,820
about to finish master's in computer
science and I got hired at SR I in their

66
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:25,830
science and I got hired at SR I in their
 

67
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,760
science and I got hired at SR I in their
AI lab and they were building a robot it

68
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:28,770
AI lab and they were building a robot it
 

69
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,190
AI lab and they were building a robot it
was a kind of a follow-on to shaky but

70
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:31,200
was a kind of a follow-on to shaky but
 

71
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,660
was a kind of a follow-on to shaky but
all the shaky people were not there

72
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:32,670
all the shaky people were not there
 

73
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:33,230
all the shaky people were not there
anymore

74
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:33,240
anymore
 

75
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,600
anymore
and so my job was to try to get this

76
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:35,610
and so my job was to try to get this
 

77
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,160
and so my job was to try to get this
robot to do stuff and that's really kind

78
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:37,170
robot to do stuff and that's really kind
 

79
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,160
robot to do stuff and that's really kind
of what got me interested in robots so

80
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:40,170
of what got me interested in robots so
 

81
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,050
of what got me interested in robots so
maybe taking a small step back your

82
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:42,060
maybe taking a small step back your
 

83
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,450
maybe taking a small step back your
bachelor's in Stanford and philosophy

84
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:44,460
bachelor's in Stanford and philosophy
 

85
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,950
bachelor's in Stanford and philosophy
did masters and PhD in computer science

86
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:45,960
did masters and PhD in computer science
 

87
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,190
did masters and PhD in computer science
but the bachelors in philosophy so what

88
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:49,200
but the bachelors in philosophy so what
 

89
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,749
but the bachelors in philosophy so what
was that journey like what elements of

90
00:01:50,749 --> 00:01:50,759
was that journey like what elements of
 

91
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,719
was that journey like what elements of
philosophy do you think you bring to

92
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:53,729
philosophy do you think you bring to
 

93
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:57,399
philosophy do you think you bring to
your work in computer science so the

94
00:01:57,399 --> 00:01:57,409
your work in computer science so the
 

95
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:59,539
your work in computer science so the
part of the reason that I didn't do a

96
00:01:59,539 --> 00:01:59,549
part of the reason that I didn't do a
 

97
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:00,889
part of the reason that I didn't do a
computer science undergraduate degree

98
00:02:00,889 --> 00:02:00,899
computer science undergraduate degree
 

99
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:02,600
computer science undergraduate degree
was that there wasn't one at Stanford at

100
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:02,610
was that there wasn't one at Stanford at
 

101
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,670
was that there wasn't one at Stanford at
the time but that there's part of

102
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:04,680
the time but that there's part of
 

103
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,260
the time but that there's part of
philosophy and in fact Stanford has a

104
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:06,270
philosophy and in fact Stanford has a
 

105
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,910
philosophy and in fact Stanford has a
special sub major in something called

106
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:07,920
special sub major in something called
 

107
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,760
special sub major in something called
now symbolic systems which is logic

108
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:10,770
now symbolic systems which is logic
 

109
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,699
now symbolic systems which is logic
model theory formal semantics of natural

110
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:13,709
model theory formal semantics of natural
 

111
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:15,559
model theory formal semantics of natural
language and so that's actually a

112
00:02:15,559 --> 00:02:15,569
language and so that's actually a
 

113
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:19,070
language and so that's actually a
perfect preparation for work in AI and

114
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:19,080
perfect preparation for work in AI and
 

115
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,900
perfect preparation for work in AI and
computer science that that's kind of

116
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:20,910
computer science that that's kind of
 

117
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,729
computer science that that's kind of
interesting so if you were interested in

118
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:22,739
interesting so if you were interested in
 

119
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:27,320
interesting so if you were interested in
artificial intelligence what what kind

120
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:27,330
artificial intelligence what what kind
 

121
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,059
artificial intelligence what what kind
of majors were people even thinking

122
00:02:29,059 --> 00:02:29,069
of majors were people even thinking
 

123
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:30,830
of majors were people even thinking
about taking what is it in your science

124
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:30,840
about taking what is it in your science
 

125
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,130
about taking what is it in your science
was so besides philosophies what were

126
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:34,140
was so besides philosophies what were
 

127
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,300
was so besides philosophies what were
you supposed to do if you were

128
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:35,310
you supposed to do if you were
 

129
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,220
you supposed to do if you were
fascinated by the idea of creating

130
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:37,230
fascinated by the idea of creating
 

131
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,900
fascinated by the idea of creating
intelligence there weren't enough people

132
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:38,910
intelligence there weren't enough people
 

133
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,910
intelligence there weren't enough people
who did that for that even to be at

134
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:40,920
who did that for that even to be at
 

135
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,470
who did that for that even to be at
conversation okay I mean I think

136
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:42,480
conversation okay I mean I think
 

137
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,550
conversation okay I mean I think
probably probably philosophy I mean it's

138
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:46,560
probably probably philosophy I mean it's
 

139
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,130
probably probably philosophy I mean it's
interesting in my class my graduating

140
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:49,140
interesting in my class my graduating
 

141
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,589
interesting in my class my graduating
class of undergraduate philosophers

142
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:51,599
class of undergraduate philosophers
 

143
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,150
class of undergraduate philosophers
probably maybe slightly less

144
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,160
probably maybe slightly less
 

145
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,380
probably maybe slightly less
than half went on in computer science

146
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:57,390
than half went on in computer science
 

147
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,390
than half went on in computer science
slightly less than half went on in law

148
00:02:59,390 --> 00:02:59,400
slightly less than half went on in law
 

149
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,790
slightly less than half went on in law
and like one or two went on in

150
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:01,800
and like one or two went on in
 

151
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,210
and like one or two went on in
philosophy so it was a common kind of

152
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:05,220
philosophy so it was a common kind of
 

153
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,070
philosophy so it was a common kind of
connection do you think AI researchers

154
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:07,080
connection do you think AI researchers
 

155
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,830
connection do you think AI researchers
have a role be part time philosophers or

156
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:09,840
have a role be part time philosophers or
 

157
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,330
have a role be part time philosophers or
should they stick to the solid science

158
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:11,340
should they stick to the solid science
 

159
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,030
should they stick to the solid science
and engineering without sort of taking

160
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:14,040
and engineering without sort of taking
 

161
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,460
and engineering without sort of taking
the philosophizing tangents I mean you

162
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:16,470
the philosophizing tangents I mean you
 

163
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,080
the philosophizing tangents I mean you
work with robots you think about what it

164
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,090
work with robots you think about what it
 

165
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,710
work with robots you think about what it
takes to create intelligent beings

166
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:20,720
takes to create intelligent beings
 

167
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,970

aren't you the perfect person to think

168
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:22,980
aren't you the perfect person to think
 

169
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,100
aren't you the perfect person to think
about the big picture philosophy of it

170
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:25,110
about the big picture philosophy of it
 

171
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,630
about the big picture philosophy of it
all the parts of philosophy that are

172
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:26,640
all the parts of philosophy that are
 

173
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,430
all the parts of philosophy that are
closest to AI I think or at least the

174
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:28,440
closest to AI I think or at least the
 

175
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,080
closest to AI I think or at least the
closest to AI that I think about are

176
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,090
closest to AI that I think about are
 

177
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,970
closest to AI that I think about are
stuff like belief and knowledge and

178
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:33,980
stuff like belief and knowledge and
 

179
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,020
stuff like belief and knowledge and
denotation and that kind of stuff and

180
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:36,030
denotation and that kind of stuff and
 

181
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,270
denotation and that kind of stuff and
that's you know it's quite formal and

182
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:38,280
that's you know it's quite formal and
 

183
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,430
that's you know it's quite formal and
it's like just one step away from the

184
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:40,440
it's like just one step away from the
 

185
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,920
it's like just one step away from the
kinds of computer science work that we

186
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:42,930
kinds of computer science work that we
 

187
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,430
kinds of computer science work that we
do kind of routinely I think that there

188
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:46,440
do kind of routinely I think that there
 

189
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,170
do kind of routinely I think that there
are important questions still about what

190
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:51,180
are important questions still about what
 

191
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,240
are important questions still about what
you can do with a machine and what you

192
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:53,250
you can do with a machine and what you
 

193
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,010
you can do with a machine and what you
can't and so on although at least my

194
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:55,020
can't and so on although at least my
 

195
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,140
can't and so on although at least my
personal view is that I'm completely a

196
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:57,150
personal view is that I'm completely a
 

197
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,430
personal view is that I'm completely a
materialist and I don't think that

198
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:58,440
materialist and I don't think that
 

199
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,010
materialist and I don't think that
there's any reason why we can't make a

200
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:01,020
there's any reason why we can't make a
 

201
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,740
there's any reason why we can't make a

like a philosophical gap
 

259
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,620
like a philosophical gap
to me it's a there is a big technical

260
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:12,630
to me it's a there is a big technical
 

261
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:16,430
to me it's a there is a big technical
gap yes technical gap but I don't see

262
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:16,440
gap yes technical gap but I don't see
 

263
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,589
gap yes technical gap but I don't see
any reason why it's more than a

any reason why it's more than a
 

265
00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:22,460
any reason why it's more than a

266
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:22,470
technical gap perfect so when you
 

267
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,469
technical gap perfect so when you
mention AI you know sorry

268
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:24,479
mention AI you know sorry
 

269
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,400
mention AI you know sorry
and maybe can you describe to me when

270
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:28,410
and maybe can you describe to me when
 

271
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,379

you first fell in love with robotics

272

you first fell in love with robotics
 

273
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:34,339
you first fell in love with robotics
with robots or inspired which so you

274
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:34,349
with robots or inspired which so you
 

275
00:05:34,349 --> 00:05:37,159
with robots or inspired which so you
should mention flaky or shaky shaky

276
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:37,169
should mention flaky or shaky shaky
 

277
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:40,760
should mention flaky or shaky shaky
flaky and what was the robot that first

278
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:40,770
flaky and what was the robot that first
 

279
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,140
flaky and what was the robot that first
captured your imagination what's

280
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:42,150
captured your imagination what's
 

281
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,760
captured your imagination what's
possible right well this so the first

282
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:43,770
possible right well this so the first
 

283
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,860
possible right well this so the first
robot I worked was like shakey was a

284
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:45,870
robot I worked was like shakey was a
 

285
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,860

robot that the SR I people had built but
 

287
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,050

00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:51,060
by the time I think when I arrived it
 

289

should read the shaky tech report

296
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:01,199
should read the shaky tech report
 

297
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,990
should read the shaky tech report
because it has so many good ideas in it

298

vision to localize itself in a map it

324
00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:45,659
vision to localize itself in a map it
 

325
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:48,050
vision to localize itself in a map it
detected objects it could detect objects

326
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:48,060
detected objects it could detect objects
 

327
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,230
detected objects it could detect objects
that were surprising to it it would plan

328
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:51,240
that were surprising to it it would plan
 

329
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,870
that were surprising to it it would plan
and re plan based on what it saw it

330
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:53,880
and re plan based on what it saw it
 

331
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,580
and re plan based on what it saw it
reasoned about whether to look and take

332
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:55,590
reasoned about whether to look and take
 

333
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:59,450
reasoned about whether to look and take
pictures I mean it really had the basics

334
00:06:59,450 --> 00:06:59,460
pictures I mean it really had the basics
 

335
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,610
pictures I mean it really had the basics
of of so many of the things that we

336
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:01,620
of of so many of the things that we
 

337
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,459
of of so many of the things that we
think about now how do you represent the

338
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:04,469
think about now how do you represent the
 

339
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:07,089
think about now how do you represent the
space around it so it had

340
00:07:07,089 --> 00:07:07,099
space around it so it had
 

341
00:07:07,099 --> 00:07:08,510
space around it so it had
representations that are bunch of

342
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:08,520
representations that are bunch of
 

343
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,070
representations that are bunch of
different levels of abstraction so it

344
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,080
different levels of abstraction so it
 

345
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,409
different levels of abstraction so it
had I think a kind of an occupancy grid

346
00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:12,419
had I think a kind of an occupancy grid
 

347
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:15,230
had I think a kind of an occupancy grid
of some sort at the lowest level at the

348
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:15,240
of some sort at the lowest level at the
 

349
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,379
of some sort at the lowest level at the
high level it was abstract symbolic kind

350
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:18,389
high level it was abstract symbolic kind
 

351
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:20,810
high level it was abstract symbolic kind
of rooms and connectivity it's a word as

352
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:20,820
of rooms and connectivity it's a word as
 

353
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,390
of rooms and connectivity it's a word as
flaky coming yeah okay so

354
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:23,400
flaky coming yeah okay so
 

355
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,810
flaky coming yeah okay so
at us RI and we were building a

356
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:26,820
at us RI and we were building a
 

357
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,969
at us RI and we were building a
brand-new robot as I said none of the

358
00:07:28,969 --> 00:07:28,979
brand-new robot as I said none of the
 

359
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:31,070
brand-new robot as I said none of the
people from the previous project were

360
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:31,080
people from the previous project were
 

361
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,930
people from the previous project were
kind of there or involved anymore so we

362
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:32,940
kind of there or involved anymore so we
 

363
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,870
kind of there or involved anymore so we
were kind of starting from scratch and

364
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:34,880
were kind of starting from scratch and
 

365
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,650
were kind of starting from scratch and
my advisor was Stan resin shine he ended

366
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:39,660
my advisor was Stan resin shine he ended
 

367
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,290
my advisor was Stan resin shine he ended
up being my thesis advisor and he was

368
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:42,300
up being my thesis advisor and he was
 

369
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,779
up being my thesis advisor and he was
motivated by this idea of situated

370
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:44,789
motivated by this idea of situated
 

371
00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:47,330
motivated by this idea of situated
computation or situated automata and the

372
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:47,340
computation or situated automata and the
 

373
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:51,740
computation or situated automata and the
idea was that the tools of logical

374
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:51,750
idea was that the tools of logical
 

375
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,890
idea was that the tools of logical
reasoning were important but possibly

376
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:54,900
reasoning were important but possibly
 

377
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:59,570
reasoning were important but possibly
only for the engineers or designers to

378
00:07:59,570 --> 00:07:59,580
only for the engineers or designers to
 

379
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,670
only for the engineers or designers to
use in the analysis of a system but not

380
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:01,680
use in the analysis of a system but not
 

381
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,520
use in the analysis of a system but not
necessarily to be manipulated in the

382
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:04,530
necessarily to be manipulated in the
 

383
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,710
necessarily to be manipulated in the
head of the system itself right so I

384
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:06,720
head of the system itself right so I
 

385
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,810
head of the system itself right so I
might use logic to prove a theorem about

386
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:08,820
might use logic to prove a theorem about
 

387
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,120
might use logic to prove a theorem about
the behavior of my robot even if the

388
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,130
the behavior of my robot even if the
 

389
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,740
the behavior of my robot even if the
robots not using logic and it's headed

390
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:12,750
robots not using logic and it's headed
 

391
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,330
robots not using logic and it's headed
to prove theorems right so that was kind

392
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:14,340
to prove theorems right so that was kind
 

393
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,930
to prove theorems right so that was kind
of the distinction and so the idea was

394
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:17,940
of the distinction and so the idea was
 

395
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,050
of the distinction and so the idea was
to kind of use those principles to make

396
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:21,060
to kind of use those principles to make
 

397
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,010
to kind of use those principles to make
a robot do stuff but a lot of the basic

398
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:25,020
a robot do stuff but a lot of the basic
 

399
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,529
a robot do stuff but a lot of the basic
things we had to kind of learn for

400
00:08:27,529 --> 00:08:27,539
things we had to kind of learn for
 

401
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:29,420
things we had to kind of learn for
ourselves because I had zero background

402
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:29,430
ourselves because I had zero background
 

403
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,890
ourselves because I had zero background
in robotics I didn't know anything about

404
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:30,900
in robotics I didn't know anything about
 

405
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,120
in robotics I didn't know anything about
control I don't know anything about

406
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,130
control I don't know anything about
 

407
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,699
control I don't know anything about
sensors so we reinvented a lot of wheels

408
00:08:34,699 --> 00:08:34,709
sensors so we reinvented a lot of wheels
 

409
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:36,500
sensors so we reinvented a lot of wheels
on the way to getting that robot to do

410
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:36,510
on the way to getting that robot to do
 

411
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,730
on the way to getting that robot to do
stuff do you think that was an advantage

412
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:37,740
stuff do you think that was an advantage
 

413
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,199
stuff do you think that was an advantage
or hindrance

414
00:08:39,199 --> 00:08:39,209
or hindrance
 

415
00:08:39,209 --> 00:08:42,469
or hindrance
oh no it's I mean I I'm big in favor of

416
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:42,479
oh no it's I mean I I'm big in favor of
 

417
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,960
oh no it's I mean I I'm big in favor of
wheel reinvention actually I mean I

418
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:44,970
wheel reinvention actually I mean I
 

419
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:47,540
wheel reinvention actually I mean I
think you learn a lot by doing it it's

420
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:47,550
think you learn a lot by doing it it's
 

421
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,310
think you learn a lot by doing it it's
important though to eventually have the

422
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:49,320
important though to eventually have the
 

423
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,890
important though to eventually have the
pointers to so that you can see what's

424
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:51,900
pointers to so that you can see what's
 

425
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,420
pointers to so that you can see what's
really going on but I think you can

426
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:53,430
really going on but I think you can
 

427
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,960
really going on but I think you can
appreciate much better the good

428
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:56,970
appreciate much better the good
 

429
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:57,650
appreciate much better the good

solutions
 

431
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,030
solutions
once you've messed around a little bit

432
00:08:59,030 --> 00:08:59,040
once you've messed around a little bit
 

433
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,740
once you've messed around a little bit
on your own and found a bad one yeah I

434
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:00,750
on your own and found a bad one yeah I
 

435
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,090
on your own and found a bad one yeah I
think you mentioned reinventing

436
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:02,100
think you mentioned reinventing
 

437
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,650
think you mentioned reinventing
reinforcement learning yeah and

438
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:03,660
reinforcement learning yeah and
 

439
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:07,130
reinforcement learning yeah and
referring to rewards as pleasures by a

440
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:07,140
referring to rewards as pleasures by a
 

441
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:10,250
referring to rewards as pleasures by a
pleasure yeah I think yeah I think it's

442
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:10,260
pleasure yeah I think yeah I think it's
 

443
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,610
pleasure yeah I think yeah I think it's
a nice name for it it's more it's more

444
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:13,620
a nice name for it it's more it's more
 

445
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,210
a nice name for it it's more it's more
fun almost do you think you could tell

446
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:17,220
fun almost do you think you could tell
 

447
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,790
fun almost do you think you could tell
the history of AI and machine learning

448
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:18,800
the history of AI and machine learning
 

449
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,840
the history of AI and machine learning
reinforcement learning and how you think

450
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:20,850
reinforcement learning and how you think
 

451
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,050
reinforcement learning and how you think
about it from the 50s to now one thing

452
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:24,060
about it from the 50s to now one thing
 

453
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,290
about it from the 50s to now one thing
is that its oscillates right so things

454
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:27,300
is that its oscillates right so things
 

455
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,329
is that its oscillates right so things
become fashionable and then they go out

456
00:09:29,329 --> 00:09:29,339
become fashionable and then they go out
 

457
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:31,130
become fashionable and then they go out
and then something else becomes cool and

458
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:31,140
and then something else becomes cool and
 

459
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,420
and then something else becomes cool and
that it goes out and so on and I think

460
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:32,430
that it goes out and so on and I think
 

461
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,280
that it goes out and so on and I think
there's so there's some interesting

462
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:34,290
there's so there's some interesting
 

463
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:36,079
there's so there's some interesting
sociological process that actually

464
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:36,089
sociological process that actually
 

465
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:37,100
sociological process that actually
drives

466
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:37,110
drives
 

467
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,310
drives
a lot of what's going on early days was

468
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:40,320
a lot of what's going on early days was
 

469
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,829
a lot of what's going on early days was
kind of cybernetics and control right

470
00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:42,839
kind of cybernetics and control right
 

471
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:47,030
kind of cybernetics and control right
and the idea that of homeostasis people

472
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,040
and the idea that of homeostasis people
 

473
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,710
and the idea that of homeostasis people
have made these robots that could I

474
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:48,720
have made these robots that could I
 

475
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,230
have made these robots that could I
don't know try to plug into the wall

476
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:51,240
don't know try to plug into the wall
 

477
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,630
don't know try to plug into the wall
when they needed power and then come

478
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:53,640
when they needed power and then come
 

479
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,490
when they needed power and then come
loose and roll around and do stuff and

480
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:55,500
loose and roll around and do stuff and
 

481
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,900
loose and roll around and do stuff and
then I think over time the thought well

482
00:09:59,900 --> 00:09:59,910
then I think over time the thought well
 

483
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,550
then I think over time the thought well
that was inspiring but people said no no

484
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:01,560
that was inspiring but people said no no
 

485
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,290
that was inspiring but people said no no
we want to get maybe closer to what

486
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:03,300
we want to get maybe closer to what
 

487
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,880
we want to get maybe closer to what
feels like real intelligence or human

488
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:04,890
feels like real intelligence or human
 

489
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:09,019
feels like real intelligence or human
intelligence and then maybe the expert

490
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:09,029
intelligence and then maybe the expert
 

491
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:13,759
intelligence and then maybe the expert
systems people tried to do that but

492
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:13,769
systems people tried to do that but
 

493
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:16,370
systems people tried to do that but
maybe a little too superficially right

494
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:16,380
maybe a little too superficially right
 

495
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,850
maybe a little too superficially right
so oh we get the surface understanding

496
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:19,860
so oh we get the surface understanding
 

497
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,340
so oh we get the surface understanding
of what intelligence is like because I

498
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:22,350
of what intelligence is like because I
 

499
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,380
of what intelligence is like because I
understand how a steel mill works and I

500
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:24,390
understand how a steel mill works and I
 

501
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,759
understand how a steel mill works and I
can try to explain it to you and you can

502
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:25,769
can try to explain it to you and you can
 

503
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:27,259
can try to explain it to you and you can
write it down in logic and then we can

504
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:27,269
write it down in logic and then we can
 

505
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:30,230
write it down in logic and then we can
make a computer infer that and then that

506
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:30,240
make a computer infer that and then that
 

507
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,069
make a computer infer that and then that
didn't work out but what's interesting I

508
00:10:34,069 --> 00:10:34,079
didn't work out but what's interesting I
 

509
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,680
didn't work out but what's interesting I
think is when a thing starts to not be

510
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:36,690
think is when a thing starts to not be
 

511
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:40,009
think is when a thing starts to not be
working very well it's not only do we

512
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:40,019
working very well it's not only do we
 

513
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:42,350
working very well it's not only do we
change methods we change problems right

514
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:42,360
change methods we change problems right
 

515
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,660
change methods we change problems right
so it's not like we have better ways of

516
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:44,670
so it's not like we have better ways of
 

517
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,190
so it's not like we have better ways of
doing the problem of the experts those

518
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:46,200
doing the problem of the experts those
 

519
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,930
doing the problem of the experts those
people are trying to do we have no ways

520
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:47,940
people are trying to do we have no ways
 

521
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,650
people are trying to do we have no ways
of trying to do that problem oh yeah I

522
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:51,660
of trying to do that problem oh yeah I
 

523
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,920
of trying to do that problem oh yeah I
know I think maybe a few but we kind of

524
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:54,930
know I think maybe a few but we kind of
 

525
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:57,620
know I think maybe a few but we kind of
give up on that problem and we switch to

526
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:57,630
give up on that problem and we switch to
 

527
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:00,230
give up on that problem and we switch to
a different problem and we we work that

528
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:00,240
a different problem and we we work that
 

529
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,819
a different problem and we we work that
for a while and we I guess there's a

530
00:11:01,819 --> 00:11:01,829
for a while and we I guess there's a
 

531
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:03,500
for a while and we I guess there's a
broad community as a community and

532
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:03,510
broad community as a community and
 

533
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,550
broad community as a community and
there's a lot of people who would argue

534
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,560
there's a lot of people who would argue
 

535
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,949
there's a lot of people who would argue
you don't give up on the problem it's

536
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:06,959
you don't give up on the problem it's
 

537
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,199
you don't give up on the problem it's
just you decrease the number of people

538
00:11:09,199 --> 00:11:09,209
just you decrease the number of people
 

539
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:10,610
just you decrease the number of people
working on it you almost kind of like

540
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:10,620
working on it you almost kind of like
 

541
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,630
working on it you almost kind of like
put it on the shelf

542
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:11,640
put it on the shelf
 

543
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,430
put it on the shelf
so we'll come back to this 20 years

544
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:13,440
so we'll come back to this 20 years
 

545
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,130
so we'll come back to this 20 years
later yeah I think that's right or you

546
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:16,140
later yeah I think that's right or you
 

547
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,500
later yeah I think that's right or you
might decide that it's malformed like

548
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:18,510
might decide that it's malformed like
 

549
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:23,180
might decide that it's malformed like
you might say it's wrong to just try to

550
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:23,190
you might say it's wrong to just try to
 

551
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,189
you might say it's wrong to just try to
make something that does superficial

552
00:11:25,189 --> 00:11:25,199
make something that does superficial
 

553
00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:27,230
make something that does superficial
symbolic reasoning behave like a doctor

554
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:27,240
symbolic reasoning behave like a doctor
 

555
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,380
symbolic reasoning behave like a doctor
you can't do that until you've had the

556
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:30,390
you can't do that until you've had the
 

557
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:33,410
you can't do that until you've had the
sensorimotor experience of being a

558
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:33,420
sensorimotor experience of being a
 

559
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,819
sensorimotor experience of being a
doctor or something right so there's

560
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:34,829
doctor or something right so there's
 

561
00:11:34,829 --> 00:11:36,439
doctor or something right so there's
arguments that say that that's problem

562
00:11:36,439 --> 00:11:36,449
arguments that say that that's problem
 

563
00:11:36,449 --> 00:11:38,810
arguments that say that that's problem
was not well formed or it could be that

564
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:38,820
was not well formed or it could be that
 

565
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,880
was not well formed or it could be that
it is well for it but but we just

566
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:40,890
it is well for it but but we just
 

567
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:43,850
it is well for it but but we just
weren't approaching it well you mention

568
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:43,860
weren't approaching it well you mention
 

569
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,500
weren't approaching it well you mention
that your favorite part of logic and

570
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:45,510
that your favorite part of logic and
 

571
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,900
that your favorite part of logic and
symbolic systems is that they give short

572
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:47,910
symbolic systems is that they give short
 

573
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,700
symbolic systems is that they give short
names for large sets

574
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:49,710
names for large sets
 

575
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,700
names for large sets
so there is some use to this they use

576
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:52,710
so there is some use to this they use
 

577
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:55,040
so there is some use to this they use
just as a symbolic reasoning though the

578
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,050
just as a symbolic reasoning though the
 

579
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,620
just as a symbolic reasoning though the
looking at expert systems and symbolic

580
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:57,630
looking at expert systems and symbolic
 

581
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,600
looking at expert systems and symbolic
computing what do you think are the

582
00:11:59,600 --> 00:11:59,610
computing what do you think are the
 

583
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:01,160
computing what do you think are the
roadblocks that were hit in the eighties

584
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:01,170
roadblocks that were hit in the eighties
 

585
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:04,130
roadblocks that were hit in the eighties
and nineties ah okay so right so the

586
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:04,140
and nineties ah okay so right so the
 

587
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,560
and nineties ah okay so right so the
fact that I'm not a fan of expert

588
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:06,570
fact that I'm not a fan of expert
 

589
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,210
fact that I'm not a fan of expert
systems doesn't mean that I'm not a fan

590
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:08,220
systems doesn't mean that I'm not a fan
 

591
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,250
systems doesn't mean that I'm not a fan
of some kinds of symbolic reasoning

592
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:10,260
of some kinds of symbolic reasoning
 

593
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:14,540
of some kinds of symbolic reasoning
right so let's see road blocks but the

594
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:14,550
right so let's see road blocks but the
 

595
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:18,199
right so let's see road blocks but the
main road block I think was that the

596
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:18,209
main road block I think was that the
 

597
00:12:18,209 --> 00:12:20,389
main road block I think was that the
idea that humans could articulate their

598
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:20,399
idea that humans could articulate their
 

599
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,320
idea that humans could articulate their
knowledge effectively into into you know

600
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:24,330
knowledge effectively into into you know
 

601
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:26,660
knowledge effectively into into you know
some kind of logical statements so it's

602
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:26,670
some kind of logical statements so it's
 

603
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:29,360
some kind of logical statements so it's
not just the cost the effort but really

604
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:29,370
not just the cost the effort but really
 

605
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:31,340
not just the cost the effort but really
just the capability of doing it right

606
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:31,350
just the capability of doing it right
 

607
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,620
just the capability of doing it right
because we're all experts in vision

608
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:33,630
because we're all experts in vision
 

609
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,930
because we're all experts in vision
right but not totally don't have

610
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:35,940
right but not totally don't have
 

611
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,269
right but not totally don't have
introspective access into how we do that

612
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:38,279
introspective access into how we do that
 

613
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:44,240
introspective access into how we do that
right and it's true that I mean I think

614
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:44,250
right and it's true that I mean I think
 

615
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,100
right and it's true that I mean I think
the idea was well of course even people

616
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:46,110
the idea was well of course even people
 

617
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,449
the idea was well of course even people
then would know of course I wouldn't ask

618
00:12:47,449 --> 00:12:47,459
then would know of course I wouldn't ask
 

619
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:48,980
then would know of course I wouldn't ask
you to please write down the rules that

620
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:48,990
you to please write down the rules that
 

621
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,720
you to please write down the rules that
you use for recognizing water bottle

622
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:50,730
you use for recognizing water bottle
 

623
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:53,210
you use for recognizing water bottle
that's crazy and everyone understood

624
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:53,220
that's crazy and everyone understood
 

625
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,530
that's crazy and everyone understood
that but we might ask you to please

626
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:54,540
that but we might ask you to please
 

627
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,800
that but we might ask you to please
write down the rules you use for

628
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:57,810
write down the rules you use for
 

629
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,440
write down the rules you use for
deciding I don't know what tie to put on

630
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:00,450
deciding I don't know what tie to put on
 

631
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:03,410
deciding I don't know what tie to put on
or how to set up a microphone or

632
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:03,420
or how to set up a microphone or
 

633
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,630
or how to set up a microphone or
something like that but even those

634
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:05,640
something like that but even those
 

635
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,410
something like that but even those
things I think people maybe I think what

636
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:09,420
things I think people maybe I think what
 

637
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,390
things I think people maybe I think what
they found I'm not sure about this but I

638
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:11,400
they found I'm not sure about this but I
 

639
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,680
they found I'm not sure about this but I
think what they found was that that

640
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:12,690
think what they found was that that
 

641
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,750
think what they found was that that
so-called experts could give

642
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:14,760
so-called experts could give
 

643
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,050
so-called experts could give
explanations that sort of post hoc

644
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:18,060
explanations that sort of post hoc
 

645
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,519
explanations that sort of post hoc
explanations for how and why they did

646
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:19,529
explanations for how and why they did
 

647
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:21,050
explanations for how and why they did
things but they weren't necessarily very

648
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:21,060
things but they weren't necessarily very
 

649
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:24,440
things but they weren't necessarily very
good and then they different they

650
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:24,450
good and then they different they
 

651
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:28,100
good and then they different they
depended on maybe some kinds of

652
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:28,110
depended on maybe some kinds of
 

653
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,890
depended on maybe some kinds of
perceptual things which again they

654
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:30,900
perceptual things which again they
 

655
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,050
perceptual things which again they
couldn't really define very well so I

656
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:33,060
couldn't really define very well so I
 

657
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,540
couldn't really define very well so I
think I think fundamentally I think that

658
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:35,550
think I think fundamentally I think that
 

659
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:38,150
think I think fundamentally I think that
the underlying problem with that was the

660
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,160
the underlying problem with that was the
 

661
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,640
the underlying problem with that was the
assumption that people could articulate

662
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:39,650
assumption that people could articulate
 

663
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,980
assumption that people could articulate
how and why they make their decisions

664
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:41,990
how and why they make their decisions
 

665
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:44,480
how and why they make their decisions
all right so it's almost in call

666
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:44,490
all right so it's almost in call
 

667
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,990
all right so it's almost in call
encoding the knowledge from converting

668
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:48,000
encoding the knowledge from converting
 

669
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
encoding the knowledge from converting
from expert to something that a machine

670
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,010
from expert to something that a machine
 

671
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,040
from expert to something that a machine
could understand and reason with no no

672
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,050
could understand and reason with no no
 

673
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,139
could understand and reason with no no
not even just encoding but getting it

674
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:54,149
not even just encoding but getting it
 

675
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:58,370
not even just encoding but getting it
out of you just not not writing it I

676
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:58,380
out of you just not not writing it I
 

677
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,069
out of you just not not writing it I
mean yes hard also to write it down for

678
00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:01,079
mean yes hard also to write it down for
 

679
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:03,470
mean yes hard also to write it down for
the computer yeah but I don't think that

680
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:03,480
the computer yeah but I don't think that
 

681
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,500
the computer yeah but I don't think that
but can produce it you can tell me a

682
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:06,510
but can produce it you can tell me a
 

683
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,960
but can produce it you can tell me a
story about why you do stuff but I'm not

684
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:08,970
story about why you do stuff but I'm not
 

685
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:12,860
story about why you do stuff but I'm not
so sure that's the way great so there

686
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:12,870
so sure that's the way great so there
 

687
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:16,370
so sure that's the way great so there
are still on the hierarchical planning

688
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:16,380
are still on the hierarchical planning
 

689
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:20,480
are still on the hierarchical planning
side places where symbolic reasoning is

690
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:20,490
side places where symbolic reasoning is
 

691
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:27,129
side places where symbolic reasoning is
very useful so as you've talked about so

692
00:14:27,129 --> 00:14:27,139
very useful so as you've talked about so
 

693
00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:30,290
very useful so as you've talked about so
where so don't where's the gap yeah okay

694
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:30,300
where so don't where's the gap yeah okay
 

695
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,100
where so don't where's the gap yeah okay
good so saying that humans can't provide

696
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:34,110
good so saying that humans can't provide
 

697
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,750
good so saying that humans can't provide
a description of their reasoning

698
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:35,760
a description of their reasoning
 

699
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,379
a description of their reasoning
processes that's ok fine but that

700
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:39,389
processes that's ok fine but that
 

701
00:14:39,389 --> 00:14:41,120
processes that's ok fine but that
doesn't mean that it's not good to do

702
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,130
doesn't mean that it's not good to do
 

703
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,769
doesn't mean that it's not good to do
reasoning of various styles inside a

704
00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:42,779
reasoning of various styles inside a
 

705
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:44,269
reasoning of various styles inside a
computer those are just two orthogonal

706
00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:44,279
computer those are just two orthogonal
 

707
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:49,189
computer those are just two orthogonal
points so then the question is what kind

708
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:49,199
points so then the question is what kind
 

709
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,210
points so then the question is what kind
of reasoning should you do inside a

710
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:50,220
of reasoning should you do inside a
 

711
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,569
of reasoning should you do inside a
computer right and the answer is I think

712
00:14:53,569 --> 00:14:53,579
computer right and the answer is I think
 

713
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:55,040
computer right and the answer is I think
you need to do all different kinds of

714
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,050
you need to do all different kinds of
 

715
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:57,110
you need to do all different kinds of
reasoning inside a computer depending on

716
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:57,120
reasoning inside a computer depending on
 

717
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,139
reasoning inside a computer depending on
what kinds of problems you face I guess

718
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:00,149
what kinds of problems you face I guess
 

719
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,300
what kinds of problems you face I guess
the question is what kind of things can

720
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:02,310
the question is what kind of things can
 

721
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:07,400
the question is what kind of things can
you encode symbolically so you can

722
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:07,410
you encode symbolically so you can
 

723
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:12,250
you encode symbolically so you can
reason about I think the idea about an

724
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:12,260
reason about I think the idea about an
 

725
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,590
reason about I think the idea about an
even symbolic I don't even like that

726
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:15,600
even symbolic I don't even like that
 

727
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,030
even symbolic I don't even like that
terminology because I don't know what it

728
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:17,040
terminology because I don't know what it
 

729
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,449
terminology because I don't know what it
means

730
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:17,459
means
 

731
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:20,150
means
technically informally I do believe in

732
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:20,160
technically informally I do believe in
 

733
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,490
technically informally I do believe in
abstractions so abstractions are

734
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:22,500
abstractions so abstractions are
 

735
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,949
abstractions so abstractions are
critical right you cannot reason a

736
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:24,959
critical right you cannot reason a
 

737
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,920
critical right you cannot reason a
completely fine grain about everything

738
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:27,930
completely fine grain about everything
 

739
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:30,019
completely fine grain about everything
in your life right you can't make a plan

740
00:15:30,019 --> 00:15:30,029
in your life right you can't make a plan
 

741
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:32,300
in your life right you can't make a plan
at the level of images and torques for

742
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:32,310
at the level of images and torques for
 

743
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:36,019
at the level of images and torques for
getting a PhD right so you have to

744
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:36,029
getting a PhD right so you have to
 

745
00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:37,910
getting a PhD right so you have to
reduce the size of the state space and

746
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:37,920
reduce the size of the state space and
 

747
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,129
reduce the size of the state space and
you have to reduce the horizon if you're

748
00:15:40,129 --> 00:15:40,139
you have to reduce the horizon if you're
 

749
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,650
you have to reduce the horizon if you're
gonna reason about getting a PhD or even

750
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:42,660
gonna reason about getting a PhD or even
 

751
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,090
gonna reason about getting a PhD or even
buying the ingredients to make dinner

752
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:44,100
buying the ingredients to make dinner
 

753
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:48,620
buying the ingredients to make dinner
and so so how can you reduce the spaces

754
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:48,630
and so so how can you reduce the spaces
 

755
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,629
and so so how can you reduce the spaces
and the horizon of the reasoning you

756
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:50,639
and the horizon of the reasoning you
 

757
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,009
and the horizon of the reasoning you
have to do and the answer is abstraction

758
00:15:52,009 --> 00:15:52,019
have to do and the answer is abstraction
 

759
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:53,840
have to do and the answer is abstraction
spatial abstraction temporal abstraction

760
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:53,850
spatial abstraction temporal abstraction
 

761
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,850
spatial abstraction temporal abstraction
I think abstraction along the lines of

762
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:55,860
I think abstraction along the lines of
 

763
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,069
I think abstraction along the lines of
goals is also interesting like you might

764
00:15:58,069 --> 00:15:58,079
goals is also interesting like you might
 

765
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,970
goals is also interesting like you might
or well abstraction and decomposition

766
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:00,980
or well abstraction and decomposition
 

767
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,930
or well abstraction and decomposition
goals this may be more of a

768
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:02,940
goals this may be more of a
 

769
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,150
goals this may be more of a
decomposition thing so I think that's

770
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:05,160
decomposition thing so I think that's
 

771
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,220
decomposition thing so I think that's
where these kinds of if you want to call

772
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:07,230
where these kinds of if you want to call
 

773
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:10,040
where these kinds of if you want to call
it symbolic or discrete models come in

774
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:10,050
it symbolic or discrete models come in
 

775
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:12,740
it symbolic or discrete models come in
you you talk about a room of your house

776
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:12,750
you you talk about a room of your house
 

777
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:16,540
you you talk about a room of your house
instead of your pose you talk about

778
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:16,550
instead of your pose you talk about
 

779
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,100
instead of your pose you talk about
you know doing something during the

780
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:18,110
you know doing something during the
 

781
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,430
you know doing something during the
afternoon instead of at 2:54 and you do

782
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:21,440
afternoon instead of at 2:54 and you do
 

783
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,200
afternoon instead of at 2:54 and you do
that because it makes your reasoning

784
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:23,210
that because it makes your reasoning
 

785
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:27,780
that because it makes your reasoning
problem easier and also because you have

786
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:27,790
problem easier and also because you have
 

787
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:30,490
problem easier and also because you have
you don't have enough information to

788
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:30,500
you don't have enough information to
 

789
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,390
you don't have enough information to
reason in high fidelity about your pose

790
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:34,400
reason in high fidelity about your pose
 

791
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,580
reason in high fidelity about your pose

00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,310
PhD okay except for at that moment at
that moment you do have to use it about

798
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:45,320
that moment you do have to use it about
 

799
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,170
that moment you do have to use it about
the pose of your elbow maybe but then

800
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:47,180
the pose of your elbow maybe but then
 

801
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,820
the pose of your elbow maybe but then
you maybe you do that in some continuous

802
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:48,830
you maybe you do that in some continuous
 

803
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:51,670
you maybe you do that in some continuous
joint space kind of modeling so I again

804
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:51,680
joint space kind of modeling so I again
 

805
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,150
joint space kind of modeling so I again
I my biggest point about all of this is

806
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:55,160
I my biggest point about all of this is
 

807
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,870
I my biggest point about all of this is
that there should be the dogma is not

808
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:57,880
that there should be the dogma is not
 

809
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,130
that there should be the dogma is not
the thing right we shouldn't it

810
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:00,140
the thing right we shouldn't it
 

811
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,990
the thing right we shouldn't it
shouldn't be that I'm in favor against

812
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:02,000
shouldn't be that I'm in favor against
 

813
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,520
shouldn't be that I'm in favor against
symbolic reasoning and you're in favor

814
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:03,530
symbolic reasoning and you're in favor
 

815
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:05,260
symbolic reasoning and you're in favor
against neural networks it should be

816
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:05,270
against neural networks it should be
 

817
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:09,400
against neural networks it should be
that just just computer science tells us

818
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:09,410
that just just computer science tells us
 

819
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:10,720
that just just computer science tells us
what the right answer to all these

820
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:10,730
what the right answer to all these
 

821
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,730
what the right answer to all these
questions is smart enough to figure it

822
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:12,740
questions is smart enough to figure it
 

823
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,060

observable Markov decision processes so

872
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:18,290
observable Markov decision processes so
 

873
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:21,040
observable Markov decision processes so
uncertainty so first water Markov

874
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,050
uncertainty so first water Markov
 

875
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:25,330

decision processes and maybe how much of

876
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:25,340
decision processes and maybe how much of
 

877
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:28,480
decision processes and maybe how much of
our world could be models and mdps how

morning me making breakfast how do you

882
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:31,970
morning me making breakfast how do you
 

883
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:34,660
morning me making breakfast how do you
think of yourself as an MDP so how do

884
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:34,670
think of yourself as an MDP so how do
 

885
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:37,060
think of yourself as an MDP so how do
you think about MVPs and how they relate

886
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:37,070
you think about MVPs and how they relate
 

887
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:40,200
you think about MVPs and how they relate
to our world well so there's a stance

888
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,210
to our world well so there's a stance
 

889
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:42,550
to our world well so there's a stance
question right so a stance is a position

890
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:42,560
question right so a stance is a position
 

891
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,800
question right so a stance is a position
that I take with respect to a problem so

892
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:44,810
that I take with respect to a problem so
 

893
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:49,270
that I take with respect to a problem so
I as a researcher or person who design

894
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:49,280
I as a researcher or person who design

systems can decide to make a model of

896
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:52,760
systems can decide to make a model of
 

897
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,890
systems can decide to make a model of
the world around me

898
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:53,900
the world around me
 

899
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,890
the world around me
in some terms right so I take this messy

900
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:56,900
in some terms right so I take this messy
 

901
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,650
in some terms right so I take this messy
world and I say I'm gonna treat it as if

902
00:18:59,650 --> 00:18:59,660
world and I say I'm gonna treat it as if
 

903
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,170
world and I say I'm gonna treat it as if
it were a problem of this formal kind

904
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:02,180
it were a problem of this formal kind
 

905
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,720
it were a problem of this formal kind
and then I can apply solution concepts

906
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:04,730
and then I can apply solution concepts
 

907
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:06,220
and then I can apply solution concepts
around rhythms or whatever to solve that

908
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:06,230
around rhythms or whatever to solve that
 

909
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:08,410
around rhythms or whatever to solve that
formal thang right so of course the

910
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:08,420
formal thang right so of course the
 

911
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,630
formal thang right so of course the
world is not anything it's not an MDP or

912
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:10,640
world is not anything it's not an MDP or
 

913
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,520
world is not anything it's not an MDP or
a pom DP I don't know what it is but I

914
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:12,530
a pom DP I don't know what it is but I
 

915
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:14,650
a pom DP I don't know what it is but I
can model aspects of it in some way or

916
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:14,660
can model aspects of it in some way or
 

917
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,050
can model aspects of it in some way or
some other way and when I model some

918
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:17,060
some other way and when I model some
 

919
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,150
some other way and when I model some
aspect of it in a certain way that gives

00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:19,160
aspect of it in a certain way that gives
 

921
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,370
aspect of it in a certain way that gives
me some set of algorithms I can use you

922
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:21,380
me some set of algorithms I can use you
 

923
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,070
me some set of algorithms I can use you
can model the world in all kinds of ways

924
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:23,080
can model the world in all kinds of ways
 

925
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:28,810
can model the world in all kinds of ways
some have some are more accepting of

926
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:28,820
some have some are more accepting of
 

927
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:31,030
some have some are more accepting of
uncertainty more easily modeling

928
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:31,040
uncertainty more easily modeling
 

929
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,800
uncertainty more easily modeling
uncertainty of the world some really

930
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:32,810
uncertainty of the world some really
 

931
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:35,070
uncertainty of the world some really
force the world to be deterministic

932
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:35,080
force the world to be deterministic
 

933
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,490
force the world to be deterministic
and so the certainly NDP's model the

934
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:39,500
and so the certainly NDP's model the
 

935
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,310
and so the certainly NDP's model the
uncertainty of the world yes model some

936
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:42,320
uncertainty of the world yes model some
 

937
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,860
uncertainty of the world yes model some
uncertainty the model not present state

938
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:44,870
uncertainty the model not present state
 

939
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:47,080
uncertainty the model not present state
uncertainty but they model uncertainty

940
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:47,090
uncertainty but they model uncertainty
 

941
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,710
uncertainty but they model uncertainty
in the way the future will unfold right

942
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:49,720
in the way the future will unfold right
 

943
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:54,070
in the way the future will unfold right
so what are Markov decision process so

944
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:54,080
so what are Markov decision process so
 

945
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,140
so what are Markov decision process so
marketers process is a model it's a kind

946
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:56,150
marketers process is a model it's a kind
 

947
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,940
marketers process is a model it's a kind
of model that you could make that says I

948
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:57,950
of model that you could make that says I
 

949
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:00,430

00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,310
I know completely the current state of
my system and what it means to be a

00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:03,320
my system and what it means to be a
 

953
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,830
my system and what it means to be a

still kind of postulate that there

still kind of postulate that there
 

1007

still kind of postulate that there
exists a state we think that there is

1008

exists a state we think that there is
 

1009
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,899
exists a state we think that there is
some information about the world out

1010
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:13,909
some information about the world out
 

1011
00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:16,090
some information about the world out
there such that if we knew that we could

1012
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:16,100
there such that if we knew that we could
 

1013
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,190
there such that if we knew that we could
make good predictions but we don't know

make good predictions but we don't know
 

1015
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,590
make good predictions but we don't know
the state and so then we have to think

1016
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:20,600
the state and so then we have to think
 

1017
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,930
the state and so then we have to think
about how but we do get observations

1018
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:22,940
about how but we do get observations

maybe I get images right here things are

1023
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,980
I feel things and those might be local
or noisy and so therefore they don't

1024
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:29,990
or noisy and so therefore they don't
 

1025
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,210
or noisy and so therefore they don't
tell me everything about what's going on

1026
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:31,220
tell me everything about what's going on
 

1027
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,659
tell me everything about what's going on
and then I have to reason about given

1028
00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:34,669
and then I have to reason about given
 

1029
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:36,669
and then I have to reason about given
the history of actions I've taken in

1030
00:21:36,669 --> 00:21:36,679
the history of actions I've taken in

1033
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,930

is going on in the world and then given

1034
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:40,940
is going on in the world and then given
 

1035
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,669
is going on in the world and then given

that's what makes us AI people right so
we saw we understand that the problem

don't yeah right so later we can come
 

1081
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:41,110

00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:12,800
some clarity to think about it that way
 

1111
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,390
some clarity to think about it that way
and to then take steps to make

1112
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:16,400
and to then take steps to make
 

1113
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,120
and to then take steps to make
approximation after approximation to get

1114
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:19,130
approximation after approximation to get
 

1115
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:20,770
approximation after approximation to get
down to something that's like computable

1116
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:20,780
down to something that's like computable
 

1117
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,690
down to something that's like computable
in some reasonable time when you think

1118
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:22,700
in some reasonable time when you think
 

1119
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,970
in some reasonable time when you think
about optimality you know the community

1120
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:24,980
about optimality you know the community
 

1121
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:28,150
about optimality you know the community
broadly is shifted on that I think a

1122
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:28,160
broadly is shifted on that I think a
 

1123
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,310
broadly is shifted on that I think a
little bit in how much they value the

1124
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:30,320
little bit in how much they value the
 

1125
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:35,020
little bit in how much they value the
idea of optimality of chasing an optimal

1126
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:35,030
idea of optimality of chasing an optimal

1129
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:40,240

optimal solution changed over the years

1130
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:40,250
optimal solution changed over the years
 

1131
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,550
optimal solution changed over the years
and when you work with robots that's

1132
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:42,560
and when you work with robots that's
 

1133
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:46,030
and when you work with robots that's
interesting I think we have a little bit

1134
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:46,040
interesting I think we have a little bit
 

1135
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:50,230
interesting I think we have a little bit
of a methodological crisis actually from

1136
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:50,240
of a methodological crisis actually from
 

1137
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,970
of a methodological crisis actually from
the theoretical side I mean I do think

1138
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:51,980
the theoretical side I mean I do think
 

1139
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,380
the theoretical side I mean I do think
that theory is important in that right

1140
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:53,390
that theory is important in that right
 

1141
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:57,130
that theory is important in that right
now we're not doing much of it so

1142
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:57,140
now we're not doing much of it so
 

1143
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,050
now we're not doing much of it so
there's lots of empirical hacking around

1144
00:23:59,050 --> 00:23:59,060
there's lots of empirical hacking around
 

1145
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,670
there's lots of empirical hacking around
and training this and doing that and

1146
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:00,680
and training this and doing that and
 

1147
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,100
and training this and doing that and
reporting numbers but is it good is it

1148
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:03,110
reporting numbers but is it good is it
 

1149
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:05,170
reporting numbers but is it good is it
bad we don't know we very hard to say

1150
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:05,180
bad we don't know we very hard to say
 

1151
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,090
bad we don't know we very hard to say
things

1152
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:07,100
things
 

1153
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:12,870
things
and if you look at like computer science

1154
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:12,880
and if you look at like computer science
 

1155
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,139
and if you look at like computer science
theory

1156
00:24:14,139 --> 00:24:14,149
theory
 

1157
00:24:14,149 --> 00:24:16,299
theory
so people talked for a while everyone

1158
00:24:16,299 --> 00:24:16,309
so people talked for a while everyone
 

1159
00:24:16,309 --> 00:24:18,039
so people talked for a while everyone
was about solving problems optimally or

1160
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:18,049
was about solving problems optimally or
 

1161
00:24:18,049 --> 00:24:20,860
was about solving problems optimally or
completely and and then there were

1162
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:20,870
completely and and then there were
 

1163
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:23,289
completely and and then there were
interesting relaxation so people look at

1164
00:24:23,289 --> 00:24:23,299
interesting relaxation so people look at
 

1165
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:26,289
interesting relaxation so people look at
oh can I are their regret bounds or can

1166
00:24:26,289 --> 00:24:26,299
oh can I are their regret bounds or can
 

1167
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:30,039
oh can I are their regret bounds or can
I do some kind of you know approximation

1168
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:30,049
I do some kind of you know approximation
 

1169
00:24:30,049 --> 00:24:31,389
I do some kind of you know approximation
can I prove something that I can

1170
00:24:31,389 --> 00:24:31,399
can I prove something that I can
 

1171
00:24:31,399 --> 00:24:33,279
can I prove something that I can
approximately solve this problem or that

1172
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:33,289
approximately solve this problem or that
 

1173
00:24:33,289 --> 00:24:35,289
approximately solve this problem or that
I get closer to the solution as I spend

1174
00:24:35,289 --> 00:24:35,299
I get closer to the solution as I spend
 

1175
00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:37,600
I get closer to the solution as I spend
more time and so on what's interesting I

1176
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:37,610
more time and so on what's interesting I
 

1177
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:41,490
more time and so on what's interesting I
think is that we don't have good

1178
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:41,500
think is that we don't have good
 

1179
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:45,999
think is that we don't have good
approximate solution concepts for very

approximate solution concepts for very
 

1181
00:24:46,009 --> 00:24:48,850
approximate solution concepts for very
difficult problems right I like to you

1182
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:48,860
difficult problems right I like to you
 

1183
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:51,009
difficult problems right I like to you
know I like to say that I I'm interested

1184
00:24:51,009 --> 00:24:51,019
know I like to say that I I'm interested
 

1185
00:24:51,019 --> 00:24:52,629
know I like to say that I I'm interested
in doing a very bad job of very big

1186
00:24:52,629 --> 00:24:52,639
in doing a very bad job of very big
 

1187
00:24:52,639 --> 00:25:02,499
in doing a very bad job of very big
problems but I would I wish I could say

1188
00:25:02,499 --> 00:25:02,509
problems but I would I wish I could say
 

1189
00:25:02,509 --> 00:25:06,279
problems but I would I wish I could say
something I wish I had a I don't know

1190
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:06,289
something I wish I had a I don't know
 

1191
00:25:06,289 --> 00:25:09,639
something I wish I had a I don't know
some kind of a formal solution concept

1192
00:25:09,639 --> 00:25:09,649
some kind of a formal solution concept
 

1193
00:25:09,649 --> 00:25:13,090
some kind of a formal solution concept
that I could use to say oh this this

1194
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:13,100
that I could use to say oh this this
 

1195
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:16,060
that I could use to say oh this this
algorithm actually it gives me something

1196
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:16,070
algorithm actually it gives me something
 

1197
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,980
algorithm actually it gives me something
like I know what I'm gonna get I can do

1198
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:17,990
like I know what I'm gonna get I can do
 

1199
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,509
like I know what I'm gonna get I can do
something other than just run it and get

1200
00:25:19,509 --> 00:25:19,519
something other than just run it and get
 

1201
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:22,269
something other than just run it and get
out so that having that notion is still

1202
00:25:22,269 --> 00:25:22,279
out so that having that notion is still
 

1203
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:24,999
out so that having that notion is still
somewhere deeply compelling to you the

1204
00:25:24,999 --> 00:25:25,009
somewhere deeply compelling to you the
 

1205
00:25:25,009 --> 00:25:28,119
somewhere deeply compelling to you the
notion that you can say you can drop

thing on the table says this you can

1208
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:31,129
thing on the table says this you can
 

1209
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:32,950
thing on the table says this you can
expect this this out gonna give me some

1210
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:32,960
expect this this out gonna give me some
 

1211
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,580
expect this this out gonna give me some
good results

1212
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:33,590
good results
 

1213
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:37,629
good results
I hope science will I mean there's

1214
00:25:37,629 --> 00:25:37,639
I hope science will I mean there's
 

1215
00:25:37,639 --> 00:25:39,159
I hope science will I mean there's
engineering in there science I think

1216
00:25:39,159 --> 00:25:39,169
engineering in there science I think
 

1217
00:25:39,169 --> 00:25:42,759
engineering in there science I think
that they're not exactly the same and I

1218
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:42,769
that they're not exactly the same and I
 

1219
00:25:42,769 --> 00:25:44,080
that they're not exactly the same and I
think right now we're making huge

1220
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:44,090
think right now we're making huge
 

1221
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:46,930
think right now we're making huge
engineering like leaps and bounds so

1222
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:46,940
engineering like leaps and bounds so
 

1223
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,430
engineering like leaps and bounds so
that engineering is running away ahead

1224
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:48,440
that engineering is running away ahead
 

1225
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,310
that engineering is running away ahead
of the science which is cool and often

00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,080

how it goes right so we're making things

1228
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:53,090
how it goes right so we're making things
 

1229
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:54,490
how it goes right so we're making things
and nobody knows how and why they work

1230
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:54,500
and nobody knows how and why they work
 

1231
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:59,680
and nobody knows how and why they work
roughly but we need to turn that into

00:25:59,680 --> 00:25:59,690
roughly but we need to turn that into
 

1233
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:03,220
roughly but we need to turn that into

there's some room for formalizing we

there's some room for formalizing we
 

1237
00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:06,519
there's some room for formalizing we
need to know what the principles are why

need to know what the principles are why

need to know what the principles are why
does this work why does that not work I

1240
00:26:08,289 --> 00:26:08,299
does this work why does that not work I

mean for awhile people built bridges by

00:26:10,509 --> 00:26:10,519
mean for awhile people built bridges by
 

1243
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:12,940
mean for awhile people built bridges by
trying but now we can often predict

without building it can we do that for

00:26:16,669 --> 00:26:19,240
without building it can we do that for

the world there's a state

1268
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:40,580
the world there's a state
 

1269
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:45,490
the world there's a state
what's this belief space idea I believe

1270
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:45,500
what's this belief space idea I believe
 

1271
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:49,570
what's this belief space idea I believe
space that is instead of thinking about

1272
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:49,580
space that is instead of thinking about
 

1273
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:52,090
space that is instead of thinking about
what's the state of the world and trying

1274
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:52,100
what's the state of the world and trying
 

1275
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:55,080
what's the state of the world and trying
to control that as a robot I think about

1276
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:55,090
to control that as a robot I think about
 

1277
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:58,780
to control that as a robot I think about
what is the space of beliefs that I

1278
00:26:58,780 --> 00:26:58,790
what is the space of beliefs that I
 

1279
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:00,460
what is the space of beliefs that I
could have about the world what's if I

1280
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:00,470
could have about the world what's if I
 

1281
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:02,170
could have about the world what's if I
think of a belief as a probability

1282
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:02,180
think of a belief as a probability
 

1283
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,090
think of a belief as a probability
distribution over ways the world could

1284
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:04,100
distribution over ways the world could
 

1285
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,910
distribution over ways the world could
be a belief state is a distribution and

1286
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:06,920
be a belief state is a distribution and
 

1287
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:10,150
be a belief state is a distribution and
then my control problem if I'm reasoning

1288
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:10,160
then my control problem if I'm reasoning
 

1289
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,340
then my control problem if I'm reasoning
about how to move through a world I'm

1290
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:12,350
about how to move through a world I'm
 

1291
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:15,400
about how to move through a world I'm
uncertain about my control problem is

1292
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:15,410
uncertain about my control problem is
 

1293
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:16,870
uncertain about my control problem is
actually the problem of controlling my

1294
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:16,880
actually the problem of controlling my
 

1295
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,360
actually the problem of controlling my
beliefs so I think about taking actions

1296
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:19,370
beliefs so I think about taking actions
 

1297
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:21,490
beliefs so I think about taking actions
not just what effect they'll have on the

1298
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:21,500
not just what effect they'll have on the
 

1299
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,930
not just what effect they'll have on the
world outside but what effect I'll have

1300
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:22,940
world outside but what effect I'll have
 

1301
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,520
world outside but what effect I'll have
on my own understanding of the world

1302
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:24,530
on my own understanding of the world
 

1303
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:27,670
on my own understanding of the world
outside and so that might compel me to

1304
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:27,680
outside and so that might compel me to
 

1305
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,760
outside and so that might compel me to
ask a question or look somewhere to

1306
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:30,770
ask a question or look somewhere to
 

1307
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:33,190
ask a question or look somewhere to
gather information which may not really

1308
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:33,200
gather information which may not really
 

1309
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,590
gather information which may not really
change the world state but it changes my

1310
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:35,600
change the world state but it changes my
 

1311
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,750
change the world state but it changes my
own belief about the world that's a

1312
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:37,760
own belief about the world that's a
 

1313
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,280
own belief about the world that's a
powerful way to to empower the agent to

1314
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:42,290
powerful way to to empower the agent to
 

1315
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:44,290
powerful way to to empower the agent to
reason about the world to explore the

1316
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:44,300
reason about the world to explore the
 

1317
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,990
reason about the world to explore the
world what kind of problems does it

1318
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:47,000
world what kind of problems does it
 

1319
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,840
world what kind of problems does it
allow you to solve to to consider belief

1320
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:49,850
allow you to solve to to consider belief
 

1321
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:52,870
allow you to solve to to consider belief

some problems like chess there's no
 

1329
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,310
some problems like chess there's no
uncertainty or maybe there's uncertainty

uncertainty or maybe there's uncertainty

about the opponent there's no
 

1333

uncertainty about the state and some
 

1335
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,720
uncertainty about the state and some
problems there's uncertainty but you

problems there's uncertainty but you
 

1337
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,540
problems there's uncertainty but you
gather information as you go right you

car down the road and it doesn't know
 

1343
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:18,910
car down the road and it doesn't know
perfectly where it is but the Llyod ours

perfectly where it is but the Llyod ours
 

1345
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,100
perfectly where it is but the Llyod ours
are all going all the time so I don't

1346
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:21,110
are all going all the time so I don't
 

1347
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,630
are all going all the time so I don't
have to think about whether to gather

1348
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:22,640
have to think about whether to gather
 

1349
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,000
have to think about whether to gather
information but if you're a human

1350
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,010
information but if you're a human
 

1351
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:27,340
information but if you're a human
driving down the road you sometimes look

1352
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:27,350
driving down the road you sometimes look
 

1353
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:29,110
driving down the road you sometimes look
over your shoulder to see what's going

1354
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:29,120
over your shoulder to see what's going
 

1355
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,050
over your shoulder to see what's going
on behind you in the lane and you have

1356
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:32,060
on behind you in the lane and you have
 

1357
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,080
on behind you in the lane and you have
to

1358
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:33,090
to
 

1359
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:35,780
to
side whether you should do that now and

1360
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:35,790
side whether you should do that now and
 

1361
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,880
side whether you should do that now and
you have to trade off the fact that

1362
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:37,890
you have to trade off the fact that
 

1363
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,470
you have to trade off the fact that
you're not seeing in front of you and

1364
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:39,480
you're not seeing in front of you and
 

1365
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,730
you're not seeing in front of you and
you're looking behind you and how

1366
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:40,740
you're looking behind you and how
 

1367
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,620
you're looking behind you and how
valuable is that information and so on

1368
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:42,630
valuable is that information and so on
 

1369
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:45,530
valuable is that information and so on
and so to make choices about information

1370
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:45,540
and so to make choices about information
 

1371
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:49,570
and so to make choices about information
gathering you have to reasonably spaced

1372
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:49,580

 

1373
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:54,740

also also I mean also to just take into

1374
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:54,750
also also I mean also to just take into
 

1375
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,510
also also I mean also to just take into
account your own uncertainty before

1376
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:56,520
account your own uncertainty before
 

1377
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,630
account your own uncertainty before
trying to do things so you might say if

1378
00:28:59,630 --> 00:28:59,640
trying to do things so you might say if
 

1379
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,110

I understand where I'm standing relative

00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:09,410
it's okay for me to go through the door
but if I'm really not sure where the

but if I'm really not sure where the
 

1387
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:12,140
but if I'm really not sure where the
door is then it might be better to not

00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:12,150
door is then it might be better to not
 

1389
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,040
door is then it might be better to not
do that right now

1390
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,050
do that right now
 

1391
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:15,170
do that right now

00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:00,060
about hierarchical reasoning the
 

1423
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,030
about hierarchical reasoning the
temporal hierarchy and particular

1424
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:02,040
temporal hierarchy and particular
 

1425
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,260
temporal hierarchy and particular
spatial hierarchy but let's talk about

1426
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:03,270
spatial hierarchy but let's talk about
 

1427
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:05,360
spatial hierarchy but let's talk about
temporal hierarchy so you might say oh I

1428
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:05,370
temporal hierarchy so you might say oh I
 

1429
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:09,020
temporal hierarchy so you might say oh I
have this long execution I have to do

1430
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:09,030
have this long execution I have to do
 

1431
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:12,050
have this long execution I have to do
but I can divide it into some segments

1432
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:12,060
but I can divide it into some segments
 

1433
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,750
but I can divide it into some segments
abstractly right so maybe you have to

1434
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:14,760
abstractly right so maybe you have to
 

1435
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,310
abstractly right so maybe you have to
get out of house I have to get in the

1436
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:16,320
get out of house I have to get in the
 

1437
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:21,260
get out of house I have to get in the
car I have to drive so on and so you can

1438
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:21,270
car I have to drive so on and so you can
 

1439
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:23,600
car I have to drive so on and so you can
plan if you can build abstractions so

1440
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:23,610
plan if you can build abstractions so
 

1441
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:25,070
plan if you can build abstractions so
this we started out by talking about

1442
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:25,080
this we started out by talking about
 

1443
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,900
this we started out by talking about
abstractions and we're back to that now

1444
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:26,910
abstractions and we're back to that now
 

1445
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:29,450
abstractions and we're back to that now
if you can build abstractions in your

1446
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:29,460
if you can build abstractions in your
 

1447
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:33,590
if you can build abstractions in your
state space and abstractions sort of

1448
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:33,600
state space and abstractions sort of
 

1449
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,840
state space and abstractions sort of
temporal abstractions then you can make

1450
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:35,850
temporal abstractions then you can make
 

1451
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:38,150
temporal abstractions then you can make
plans at a high level and you can say

1452
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:38,160
plans at a high level and you can say
 

1453
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,430
plans at a high level and you can say
I'm gonna go to town and then I'll have

1454
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:40,440
I'm gonna go to town and then I'll have
 

1455
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,200
I'm gonna go to town and then I'll have
to get gas and then I can go here and I

1456
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:42,210
to get gas and then I can go here and I
 

1457
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:43,370
to get gas and then I can go here and I
can do this other thing and you can

1458
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:43,380
can do this other thing and you can
 

1459
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,220
can do this other thing and you can
reason about the dependencies and

1460
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:45,230
reason about the dependencies and
 

1461
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:47,030
reason about the dependencies and
constraints among these

1462
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:47,040
constraints among these
 

1463
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,640
constraints among these
actions again without thinking about the

1464
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:49,650
actions again without thinking about the
 

1465
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:53,870
actions again without thinking about the
complete details what we do in our

1466
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:53,880
complete details what we do in our
 

1467
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,240
complete details what we do in our
hierarchical planning work is then say

1468
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:56,250
hierarchical planning work is then say
 

1469
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:57,860
hierarchical planning work is then say
alright I make a plan at a high level of

1470
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:57,870
alright I make a plan at a high level of
 

1471
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:01,340
alright I make a plan at a high level of
abstraction I have to have some reason

1472
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:01,350
abstraction I have to have some reason
 

1473
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:03,440
abstraction I have to have some reason
to think that it's feasible without

1474
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:03,450
to think that it's feasible without
 

1475
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:06,320
to think that it's feasible without
working it out in complete detail and

1476
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:06,330
working it out in complete detail and
 

1477
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:08,270
working it out in complete detail and
that's actually the interesting step I

1478
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:08,280
that's actually the interesting step I
 

1479
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,500
that's actually the interesting step I
always like to talk about walking

1480
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:09,510
always like to talk about walking
 

1481
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:12,920
always like to talk about walking
through an airport like you can plan to

1482
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:12,930
through an airport like you can plan to
 

1483
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:14,630
through an airport like you can plan to
go to New York and arrive at the airport

1484
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:14,640
go to New York and arrive at the airport
 

1485
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,760
go to New York and arrive at the airport
and then find yourself in an office

1486
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:16,770
and then find yourself in an office
 

1487
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:19,460
and then find yourself in an office
building later you can't even tell me in

1488
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:19,470
building later you can't even tell me in
 

1489
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,990
building later you can't even tell me in
advance what your plan is for walking

1490
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:21,000
advance what your plan is for walking
 

1491
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,640
advance what your plan is for walking
through the airport

1492
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:21,650
through the airport
 

1493
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:24,380
through the airport
partly because you're too lazy to think

1494
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:24,390
partly because you're too lazy to think
 

1495
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:26,030
partly because you're too lazy to think
about it maybe but partly also because

1496
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:26,040
about it maybe but partly also because
 

1497
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,290
about it maybe but partly also because
you just don't have the information you

1498
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:27,300
you just don't have the information you
 

1499
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,030
you just don't have the information you
don't know what gate you're landing in

1500
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:29,040
don't know what gate you're landing in
 

1501
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,400
don't know what gate you're landing in
or what people are gonna be in front of

1502
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:31,410
or what people are gonna be in front of
 

1503
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:34,520
or what people are gonna be in front of
you or anything so there's no point in

1504
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:34,530
you or anything so there's no point in
 

1505
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:37,300
you or anything so there's no point in
planning in detail but you have to have

1506
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:37,310
planning in detail but you have to have
 

1507
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:39,950
planning in detail but you have to have
you have to make a leap of faith that

1508
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:39,960
you have to make a leap of faith that
 

1509
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,170
you have to make a leap of faith that
you can figure it out once you get there

1510
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:42,180
you can figure it out once you get there
 

1511
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:45,020
you can figure it out once you get there
and it's really interesting to me how

1512
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:45,030
and it's really interesting to me how
 

1513
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:50,330
and it's really interesting to me how
you arrive at that how do you they say

1514
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:50,340
you arrive at that how do you they say
 

1515
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,010
you arrive at that how do you they say
you have learned over your lifetime to

1516
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:52,020
you have learned over your lifetime to
 

1517
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,210
you have learned over your lifetime to
be able to make some kinds of

1518
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:53,220
be able to make some kinds of
 

1519
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,070
be able to make some kinds of
predictions about how hard it is to

1520
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:55,080
predictions about how hard it is to
 

1521
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,080
predictions about how hard it is to
achieve some kinds of sub goals and

1522
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:57,090
achieve some kinds of sub goals and
 

1523
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:59,300
achieve some kinds of sub goals and
that's critical like you would never

1524
00:31:59,300 --> 00:31:59,310
that's critical like you would never
 

1525
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:01,520
that's critical like you would never
plan to fly somewhere if you couldn't

1526
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:01,530
plan to fly somewhere if you couldn't
 

1527
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:03,560
plan to fly somewhere if you couldn't
didn't have a model of how hard it was

1528
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:03,570
didn't have a model of how hard it was
 

1529
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:05,450
didn't have a model of how hard it was
to do some of the intermediate steps so

1530
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:05,460
to do some of the intermediate steps so
 

1531
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,380
to do some of the intermediate steps so
one of the things we're thinking about

1532
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:06,390
one of the things we're thinking about
 

1533
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:08,240
one of the things we're thinking about
now is how do you do this kind of very

1534
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:08,250
now is how do you do this kind of very
 

1535
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:13,580
now is how do you do this kind of very
aggressive generalization to situations

1536
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:13,590
aggressive generalization to situations
 

1537
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,230
aggressive generalization to situations
that you haven't been in and so on to

1538
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:15,240
that you haven't been in and so on to
 

1539
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,000
that you haven't been in and so on to
predict how long will it take to walk

1540
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,010
predict how long will it take to walk
 

1541
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:18,920
predict how long will it take to walk
through the Kuala Lumpur Airport like

1542
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:18,930
through the Kuala Lumpur Airport like
 

1543
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:20,480
through the Kuala Lumpur Airport like
you give me an estimate and it wouldn't

1544
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:20,490
you give me an estimate and it wouldn't
 

1545
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:23,660
you give me an estimate and it wouldn't
be crazy and you have to have an

1546
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:23,670
be crazy and you have to have an
 

1547
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:25,610
be crazy and you have to have an
estimate of that in order to make plans

1548
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:25,620
estimate of that in order to make plans
 

1549
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,740
estimate of that in order to make plans
that involve walking through the Kuala

1550
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:27,750
that involve walking through the Kuala
 

1551
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:29,420
that involve walking through the Kuala
Lumpur Airport even if you don't need to

1552
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:29,430
Lumpur Airport even if you don't need to
 

1553
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:31,790
Lumpur Airport even if you don't need to
know it in detail so I'm really

1554
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:31,800
know it in detail so I'm really
 

1555
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,620
know it in detail so I'm really
interested in these kinds of abstract

1556
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:33,630
interested in these kinds of abstract
 

1557
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:35,780
interested in these kinds of abstract
models and how do we acquire them but

1558
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:35,790
models and how do we acquire them but
 

1559
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,820
models and how do we acquire them but
once we have them we can use them to do

1560
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:37,830
once we have them we can use them to do
 

1561
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,470
once we have them we can use them to do
hierarchical reasoning which is I think

1562
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:39,480
hierarchical reasoning which is I think
 

1563
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,940
hierarchical reasoning which is I think
it's very important yeah there's this

1564
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:40,950
it's very important yeah there's this
 

1565
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:45,320
it's very important yeah there's this
notion of gold' regression and preimage

1566
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:45,330
notion of gold' regression and preimage
 

1567
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,600
notion of gold' regression and preimage
back chaining this idea of starting at

1568
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:47,610
back chaining this idea of starting at
 

1569
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:49,640
back chaining this idea of starting at
the goal and it's just for these big

1570
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:49,650
the goal and it's just for these big
 

1571
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:54,800
the goal and it's just for these big
clouds of states you get I mean it's

1572
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:54,810
clouds of states you get I mean it's
 

1573
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:56,420
clouds of states you get I mean it's
almost like saying to the airport you

1574
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:56,430
almost like saying to the airport you
 

1575
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:59,990
almost like saying to the airport you
know you you know once you show up

1576
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:00,000
know you you know once you show up
 

1577
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,800
know you you know once you show up
to the airport that that's you you're

1578
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:03,810
to the airport that that's you you're
 

1579
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:05,630
to the airport that that's you you're
like a few steps away from the goal so

1580
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:05,640
like a few steps away from the goal so
 

1581
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,120
like a few steps away from the goal so
like thinking of it this way it's kind

1582
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:08,130
like thinking of it this way it's kind
 

1583
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:09,170
like thinking of it this way it's kind
of interesting I don't know if you have

1584
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:09,180
of interesting I don't know if you have
 

1585
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:13,370
of interesting I don't know if you have
sort of further comments on them of

1586
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:13,380
sort of further comments on them of
 

1587
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,470
sort of further comments on them of
starting at the goal why that yeah I

1588
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:15,480
starting at the goal why that yeah I
 

1589
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,740
starting at the goal why that yeah I
mean it's interesting that Simon herb

1590
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:18,750
mean it's interesting that Simon herb
 

1591
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,560
mean it's interesting that Simon herb
Simon back in the early days of AI did

1592
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:21,570
Simon back in the early days of AI did
 

1593
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:23,570
Simon back in the early days of AI did
talked a lot about means-ends reasoning

1594
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:23,580
talked a lot about means-ends reasoning
 

1595
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,430
talked a lot about means-ends reasoning
and reasoning back from the goal there's

1596
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:25,440
and reasoning back from the goal there's
 

1597
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,260
and reasoning back from the goal there's
a kind of an intuition that people have

1598
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:27,270
a kind of an intuition that people have
 

1599
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:32,630
a kind of an intuition that people have
that the number of that state space is

1600
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:32,640
that the number of that state space is
 

1601
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,340
that the number of that state space is
big the number of actions you could take

1602
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:34,350
big the number of actions you could take
 

1603
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:37,250
big the number of actions you could take
is really big so if you say here I sit

1604
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:37,260
is really big so if you say here I sit
 

1605
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,630
is really big so if you say here I sit
and I want to search forward from where

1606
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:38,640
and I want to search forward from where
 

1607
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,920
and I want to search forward from where
I am what are all the things I could do

1608
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:39,930
I am what are all the things I could do
 

1609
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:42,470
I am what are all the things I could do
that's just overwhelming if you say if

1610
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:42,480
that's just overwhelming if you say if
 

1611
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,960
that's just overwhelming if you say if
you can reason at this other level and

1612
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:44,970
you can reason at this other level and
 

1613
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:46,250
you can reason at this other level and
say here's what I'm hoping to achieve

1614
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:46,260
say here's what I'm hoping to achieve
 

1615
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,740
say here's what I'm hoping to achieve
what can I do to make that true that

1616
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:48,750
what can I do to make that true that
 

1617
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:51,440
what can I do to make that true that
somehow the branching is smaller now

1618
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:51,450
somehow the branching is smaller now
 

1619
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:53,030
somehow the branching is smaller now
what's interesting is that like in the

1620
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:53,040
what's interesting is that like in the
 

1621
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,940
what's interesting is that like in the
AI planning community that hasn't worked

1629
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,860

better to go backward it's still kind of

1630
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:03,870
better to go backward it's still kind of
 

1631
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:05,870
better to go backward it's still kind of
my intuition that it is but I can't

something about the dynamics of the

learned in a transition model and I
 

1737
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,880
learned in a transition model and I
couple it with a planner and I draw a

couple it with a planner and I draw a
 

1739
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:25,880
couple it with a planner and I draw a

it's just stored a different way right
 

1743
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:32,000
it's just stored a different way right
right it's in but it's just as much of a

it's a time-space trade-off in
 

1751
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:41,960
it's a time-space trade-off in
computation right a more overt policy

let's make compute what action to take
 

1765
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:56,450
let's make compute what action to take
to just more slowly

there's no I mean I don't think there's
 

1769
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:01,640
there's no I mean I don't think there's
no argument to be had it's just like a

no argument to be had it's just like a
 

1771
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:04,040
no argument to be had it's just like a
question of what form of computation is

right so and and so like learning to do

00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:11,220
right so and and so like learning to do
 

1777
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,790
right so and and so like learning to do
algebra manipulations for some reason is

good I mean that's probably gonna want

1780
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:15,870
good I mean that's probably gonna want
 

1781
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,420

1787
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,960
the time constraints on the unicycle or
serious this thing space is maybe

1788
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:23,970
serious this thing space is maybe
 

1789
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:25,250
serious this thing space is maybe
smaller I don't know

1790
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:25,260
smaller I don't know
 

1791
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,530
smaller I don't know
but so I could be

1792
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:27,540
but so I could be
 

1793
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,930

perception or planning perception that's

1806
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:48,270

1807
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:52,550
perception or planning perception that's
understanding that's so what do you

1808
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:52,560
understanding that's so what do you
 

1809
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,020
understanding that's so what do you
think is so hard about perception by

1810
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:54,030
think is so hard about perception by
 

1811
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,670
think is so hard about perception by
understanding the world around you well

1812

understanding the world around you well
 

1813
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:00,520
understanding the world around you well
I think the big question is

1814
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:00,530

 

1815
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:03,410

representational a hugely the question

1816
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:03,420
representational a hugely the question
 

1817
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:07,600
representational a hugely the question
is representation so perception has made

1818
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:07,610
is representation so perception has made
 

1819
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:10,640
is representation so perception has made
great strides lately right and we can

1820
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:10,650
great strides lately right and we can
 

1821
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:14,990
great strides lately right and we can
classify images and we can play certain

1822
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:15,000
classify images and we can play certain

1826
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:19,760
the car and all this sort of stuff I
 

1827
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,460
the car and all this sort of stuff I
don't think we have a very good idea of

1828
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:24,470
don't think we have a very good idea of
 

1829
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:27,620
don't think we have a very good idea of
what perception should deliver right so

1830
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:27,630
what perception should deliver right so
 

1831
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:29,720
what perception should deliver right so
if you if you believe in modularity ok

if you if you believe in modularity ok
 

1833
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:31,640
if you if you believe in modularity ok
there's there's a very strong view which

there's there's a very strong view which
 

1835
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:36,560
there's there's a very strong view which
says we shouldn't build in any

00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:37,370
strong bias and it's a very critical
bias so my own view is that we should

1884
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:37,380
bias so my own view is that we should
 

1885
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,140
bias so my own view is that we should
look for more things that are like

1886
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:39,150
look for more things that are like
 

1887
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,910
look for more things that are like
convolution but that

1888
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:40,920
convolution but that
 

1889
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,860
convolution but that
other aspects of reasoning right so

1890
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:42,870
other aspects of reasoning right so
 

1891
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:44,300
other aspects of reasoning right so
convolution helps us a lot with a

1892
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:44,310
convolution helps us a lot with a
 

1893
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:46,100
convolution helps us a lot with a
certain kind of spatial reasoning that's

1894
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:46,110
certain kind of spatial reasoning that's
 

1895
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:49,960
certain kind of spatial reasoning that's
quite close to the imaging I think

1896
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:49,970
quite close to the imaging I think
 

1897
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:54,920
quite close to the imaging I think
there's other ideas like that maybe some

1898
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:54,930
there's other ideas like that maybe some
 

1899
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:56,930
there's other ideas like that maybe some
amount of forward search maybe some

1900
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:56,940
amount of forward search maybe some
 

1901
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:59,840
amount of forward search maybe some
notions of abstraction maybe the notion

1902
00:39:59,840 --> 00:39:59,850
notions of abstraction maybe the notion
 

1903
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:01,520
notions of abstraction maybe the notion
that objects exist actually I think

1904
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:01,530
that objects exist actually I think
 

1905
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:02,990
that objects exist actually I think
that's pretty important and a lot of

1906
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:03,000
that's pretty important and a lot of
 

1907
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,700
that's pretty important and a lot of
people won't give you that to start with

1908
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:04,710
people won't give you that to start with
 

1909
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:07,520
people won't give you that to start with
right so almost like a convolution in

1910
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:07,530
right so almost like a convolution in
 

1911
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:12,170
right so almost like a convolution in
the in the object semantic object space

1912
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:12,180
the in the object semantic object space
 

1913
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,730
the in the object semantic object space
of some kind sometimes some kind of

1914
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:13,740
of some kind sometimes some kind of
 

1915
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,560
of some kind sometimes some kind of
ideas in there that's right people who

1916
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:15,570
ideas in there that's right people who
 

1917
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:16,940
ideas in there that's right people who
started like the graph graph

1918
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:16,950
started like the graph graph
 

1919
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:18,560
started like the graph graph
convolutions are an idea that are

1920
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:18,570
convolutions are an idea that are
 

1921
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:19,970
convolutions are an idea that are
related to racial relational

1922
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:19,980
related to racial relational
 

1923
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:23,990
related to racial relational
representations and so so I think there

1924
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:24,000
representations and so so I think there
 

1925
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,260
representations and so so I think there
are so you I've come far afield from

1926
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:27,270
are so you I've come far afield from
 

1927
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:30,110
are so you I've come far afield from
perception but I think I think the thing

1928
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:30,120
perception but I think I think the thing
 

1929
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,940
perception but I think I think the thing
that's going to make perception that

1930
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:31,950
that's going to make perception that
 

1931
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:33,850
that's going to make perception that
kind of the next step is actually

1932
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:33,860
kind of the next step is actually
 

1933
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,780
kind of the next step is actually
understanding better what it should

1934
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:35,790
understanding better what it should
 

1935
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:38,000
understanding better what it should
produce right so what are we going to do

1936
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,010
produce right so what are we going to do
 

1937
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:40,100
produce right so what are we going to do
with the output of it right it's fine

1938
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:40,110
with the output of it right it's fine
 

1939
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:41,270
with the output of it right it's fine
when what we're gonna do with the output

1940
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:41,280
when what we're gonna do with the output
 

1941
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,090
when what we're gonna do with the output
is Sudhir it's less clear when we're

1942
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:44,100
is Sudhir it's less clear when we're
 

1943
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,660
is Sudhir it's less clear when we're
just trying to make a one integrated

1944
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:46,670
just trying to make a one integrated
 

1945
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:49,460
just trying to make a one integrated
intelligent agent what should the output

1946
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:49,470
intelligent agent what should the output
 

1947
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:52,460
intelligent agent what should the output
of perception be we have no idea and how

1948
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:52,470
of perception be we have no idea and how
 

1949
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:53,780
of perception be we have no idea and how
should that hook up to the other stuff

1950
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:53,790
should that hook up to the other stuff
 

1951
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:57,380
should that hook up to the other stuff
we don't know so I think the pressing

1952
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:57,390
we don't know so I think the pressing
 

1953
00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:00,200
we don't know so I think the pressing
question is what kinds of structure can

1954
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:00,210
question is what kinds of structure can
 

1955
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:01,640
question is what kinds of structure can
we build in that are like the moral

1956
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:01,650
we build in that are like the moral
 

1957
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:04,220
we build in that are like the moral
equivalent of convolution that will make

1958
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:04,230
equivalent of convolution that will make
 

1959
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:07,190
equivalent of convolution that will make
a really awesome super structure that

1960
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:07,200
a really awesome super structure that
 

1961
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,230
a really awesome super structure that
then learning can kind of progress on

1962
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:09,240
then learning can kind of progress on
 

1963
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,570
then learning can kind of progress on
efficiently I agree very compelling

1964
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:11,580
efficiently I agree very compelling
 

1965
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,250
efficiently I agree very compelling
description of actually where we stand

1966
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:13,260
description of actually where we stand
 

1967
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,920
description of actually where we stand
with the perceptual mom you're teaching

1968
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:15,930
with the perceptual mom you're teaching
 

1969
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:18,470
with the perceptual mom you're teaching
a course on embodying intelligence what

1970
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:18,480
a course on embodying intelligence what
 

1971
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,880
a course on embodying intelligence what
do you think it takes to build a robot

1972
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:19,890
do you think it takes to build a robot
 

1973
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:23,630
do you think it takes to build a robot
with human level intelligence I don't

1974
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:23,640
with human level intelligence I don't
 

1975
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:28,040
with human level intelligence I don't
know if we knew we would do it if you

1976
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:28,050
know if we knew we would do it if you
 

1977
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:30,890
know if we knew we would do it if you
were to I mean okay so do you think a

1978
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:30,900
were to I mean okay so do you think a
 

1979
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:35,830
were to I mean okay so do you think a
robot needs to have a self-awareness

1980
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:35,840
robot needs to have a self-awareness
 

1981
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:40,280
robot needs to have a self-awareness
consciousness fear of mortality or is it

1982
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:40,290
consciousness fear of mortality or is it
 

1983
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:43,220
consciousness fear of mortality or is it
is it simpler than that or is

1984
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:43,230
is it simpler than that or is
 

1985
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:45,260
is it simpler than that or is
consciousness a simple thing like do you

1986
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:45,270
consciousness a simple thing like do you
 

1987
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:47,570
consciousness a simple thing like do you
think about these notions I don't think

1988
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:47,580
think about these notions I don't think
 

1989
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:51,200
think about these notions I don't think
much about consciousness even most

1990
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:51,210
much about consciousness even most
 

1991
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:52,970
much about consciousness even most
philosophers who care about it will give

1992
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:52,980
philosophers who care about it will give
 

1993
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,980
philosophers who care about it will give
you that you could have

1994
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:54,990
you that you could have
 

1995
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:56,750
you that you could have
that are zombies right that behave like

1996
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:56,760
that are zombies right that behave like
 

1997
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,240
that are zombies right that behave like
humans but are not conscious and I at

1998
00:41:59,240 --> 00:41:59,250
humans but are not conscious and I at
 

1999
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,650
humans but are not conscious and I at
this moment we'd be happy enough for

2000
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:00,660
this moment we'd be happy enough for
 

2001
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,270
this moment we'd be happy enough for
that so I'm not really worried one way

2002
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:02,280
that so I'm not really worried one way
 

2003
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,620
that so I'm not really worried one way
or the other to the technical side

2004
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:03,630
or the other to the technical side
 

2005
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:06,020
or the other to the technical side
you're not thinking of the use of

2006
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:06,030
you're not thinking of the use of
 

2007
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:09,440
you're not thinking of the use of
self-awareness no but okay but then what

2008
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:09,450
self-awareness no but okay but then what
 

2009
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:12,920
self-awareness no but okay but then what
is self-awareness mean I mean that you

2010
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:12,930
is self-awareness mean I mean that you
 

2011
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,810
is self-awareness mean I mean that you
need to have some part of the system

2012
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:14,820
need to have some part of the system
 

2013
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:17,600
need to have some part of the system
that can observe other parts of the

2014
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:17,610
that can observe other parts of the
 

2015
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:19,010
that can observe other parts of the
system and tell whether they're working

2016
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:19,020
system and tell whether they're working
 

2017
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:22,280
system and tell whether they're working
well or not that seems critical so does

2018
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:22,290
well or not that seems critical so does
 

2019
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:24,620
well or not that seems critical so does
that count this I mean does that kind of

2020
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:24,630
that count this I mean does that kind of
 

2021
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:26,870
that count this I mean does that kind of
self-awareness or not well it depends on

2022
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:26,880
self-awareness or not well it depends on
 

2023
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,660
self-awareness or not well it depends on
whether you think that there's somebody

2024
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:29,670
whether you think that there's somebody
 

2025
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:31,370
whether you think that there's somebody
at home who can articulate whether

2026
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:31,380
at home who can articulate whether
 

2027
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:33,710
at home who can articulate whether
they're self-aware but clearly if I have

2028
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:33,720
they're self-aware but clearly if I have
 

2029
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,840
they're self-aware but clearly if I have
like you know some piece of code that's

2030
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:35,850
like you know some piece of code that's
 

2031
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:37,340
like you know some piece of code that's
counting how many times this procedure

2032
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:37,350
counting how many times this procedure
 

2033
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:40,430
counting how many times this procedure
gets executed that's a kind of

2034
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:40,440
gets executed that's a kind of
 

2035
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,200
gets executed that's a kind of
self-awareness right so there's a big

2036
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:42,210
self-awareness right so there's a big
 

2037
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:43,910
self-awareness right so there's a big
spectrum it's clear you have to have

2038
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:43,920
spectrum it's clear you have to have
 

2039
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,140
spectrum it's clear you have to have
some of it right

2040
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:45,150
some of it right
 

2041
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:46,790
some of it right
you know quite far away at many

2042
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:46,800
you know quite far away at many
 

2043
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,320
you know quite far away at many
dimensions but there's a direction of

2044
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:48,330
dimensions but there's a direction of
 

2045
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:51,109
dimensions but there's a direction of
research that's most compelling to you

2046
00:42:51,109 --> 00:42:51,119
research that's most compelling to you
 

2047
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:53,750
research that's most compelling to you
for you know try to achieve human-level

2048
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:53,760
for you know try to achieve human-level
 

2049
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,200
for you know try to achieve human-level
intelligence in our robots well to me I

2050
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:57,210
intelligence in our robots well to me I
 

2051
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:58,580
intelligence in our robots well to me I
guess the thing that seems most

2052
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:58,590
guess the thing that seems most
 

2053
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:00,620
guess the thing that seems most
compelling to me at the moment is this

2054
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:00,630
compelling to me at the moment is this
 

2055
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:02,540
compelling to me at the moment is this
question of what to build in and what to

2056
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:02,550
question of what to build in and what to
 

2057
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:09,590
question of what to build in and what to
learn I think we're we don't we're

2058
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:09,600
learn I think we're we don't we're
 

2059
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:13,580
learn I think we're we don't we're
missing a bunch of ideas and and we you

2060
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:13,590
missing a bunch of ideas and and we you
 

2061
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:15,830
missing a bunch of ideas and and we you
know people you know don't you dare ask

2062
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:15,840
know people you know don't you dare ask
 

2063
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,660
know people you know don't you dare ask
me how many years it's gonna be until

2064
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:17,670
me how many years it's gonna be until
 

2065
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:19,540
me how many years it's gonna be until
that happens because I won't even

2066
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:19,550
that happens because I won't even
 

2067
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:22,070
that happens because I won't even
participate in the conversation because

2068
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:22,080
participate in the conversation because
 

2069
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,570
participate in the conversation because
I think we're missing ideas and I don't

2070
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:23,580
I think we're missing ideas and I don't
 

2071
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:24,859
I think we're missing ideas and I don't
know how long it's gonna take to find

2072
00:43:24,859 --> 00:43:24,869
know how long it's gonna take to find
 

2073
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:26,960
know how long it's gonna take to find
them so I won't ask you how many years

2074
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:26,970
them so I won't ask you how many years
 

2075
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:31,970
them so I won't ask you how many years
but maybe I'll ask you what it when

2076
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:31,980
but maybe I'll ask you what it when
 

2077
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:33,680
but maybe I'll ask you what it when
you'll be sufficiently impressed that

2078
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:33,690
you'll be sufficiently impressed that
 

2079
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:35,950
you'll be sufficiently impressed that
we've achieved it so what's what's a

2080
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:35,960
we've achieved it so what's what's a
 

2081
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,660
we've achieved it so what's what's a
good test of intelligence do you like

2082
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:38,670
good test of intelligence do you like
 

2083
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:41,210
good test of intelligence do you like
the Turing test the natural language in

2084
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:41,220
the Turing test the natural language in
 

2085
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:43,370
the Turing test the natural language in
the robotic space is there something

2086
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:43,380
the robotic space is there something
 

2087
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:46,580
the robotic space is there something
wait you would sit back and think us

2088
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:46,590
wait you would sit back and think us
 

2089
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:50,000
wait you would sit back and think us
that's pretty impressive as a test as a

2090
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:50,010
that's pretty impressive as a test as a
 

2091
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:52,310
that's pretty impressive as a test as a
benchmark do you think about these kinds

2092
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:52,320
benchmark do you think about these kinds
 

2093
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,950
benchmark do you think about these kinds
of problems no I resist I mean I think

2094
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:54,960
of problems no I resist I mean I think
 

2095
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,500
of problems no I resist I mean I think
all the time that we spend arguing about

2096
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:57,510
all the time that we spend arguing about
 

2097
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:58,880
all the time that we spend arguing about
those kinds of things could be better

2098
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:58,890
those kinds of things could be better
 

2099
00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:01,570
those kinds of things could be better
spent just making the robots work better

2100
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:01,580
spent just making the robots work better
 

2101
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:03,259
spent just making the robots work better
so you

2102
00:44:03,259 --> 00:44:03,269
so you
 

2103
00:44:03,269 --> 00:44:05,569
so you
competition so I mean there's a nature

2104
00:44:05,569 --> 00:44:05,579
competition so I mean there's a nature
 

2105
00:44:05,579 --> 00:44:09,319
competition so I mean there's a nature
of benchmark benchmarks and data sets or

2106
00:44:09,319 --> 00:44:09,329
of benchmark benchmarks and data sets or
 

2107
00:44:09,329 --> 00:44:11,719
of benchmark benchmarks and data sets or
touring test challenges or everybody

2108
00:44:11,719 --> 00:44:11,729
touring test challenges or everybody
 

2109
00:44:11,729 --> 00:44:13,609
touring test challenges or everybody
kind of gets together and tries to build

2110
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:13,619
kind of gets together and tries to build
 

2111
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:14,870
kind of gets together and tries to build
a better robot because they want to

2112
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:14,880
a better robot because they want to
 

2113
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,849
a better robot because they want to
compete each other like the DARPA

2114
00:44:16,849 --> 00:44:16,859
compete each other like the DARPA
 

2115
00:44:16,859 --> 00:44:19,299
compete each other like the DARPA
challenge with the autonomous vehicles

2116
00:44:19,299 --> 00:44:19,309
challenge with the autonomous vehicles
 

2117
00:44:19,309 --> 00:44:24,319
challenge with the autonomous vehicles
do you see the value of that I can get

2118
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:24,329
do you see the value of that I can get
 

2119
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:26,059
do you see the value of that I can get
in the way I think in the way I mean

2120
00:44:26,059 --> 00:44:26,069
in the way I think in the way I mean
 

2121
00:44:26,069 --> 00:44:27,559
in the way I think in the way I mean
some people many people find it

2122
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:27,569
some people many people find it
 

2123
00:44:27,569 --> 00:44:29,149
some people many people find it
motivating and so that's good

2124
00:44:29,149 --> 00:44:29,159
motivating and so that's good
 

2125
00:44:29,159 --> 00:44:33,769
motivating and so that's good
I find it anti motivating but I think I

2126
00:44:33,769 --> 00:44:33,779
I find it anti motivating but I think I
 

2127
00:44:33,779 --> 00:44:35,359
I find it anti motivating but I think I
mean I think you get an interesting

2128
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:35,369
mean I think you get an interesting
 

2129
00:44:35,369 --> 00:44:39,019
mean I think you get an interesting
cycle where for a contest a bunch of

2130
00:44:39,019 --> 00:44:39,029
cycle where for a contest a bunch of
 

2131
00:44:39,029 --> 00:44:40,939
cycle where for a contest a bunch of
smart people get super motivated and

2132
00:44:40,939 --> 00:44:40,949
smart people get super motivated and
 

2133
00:44:40,949 --> 00:44:42,739
smart people get super motivated and
they hack the brains out and much of

2134
00:44:42,739 --> 00:44:42,749
they hack the brains out and much of
 

2135
00:44:42,749 --> 00:44:44,419
they hack the brains out and much of
what gets done is just hacks but

2136
00:44:44,419 --> 00:44:44,429
what gets done is just hacks but
 

2137
00:44:44,429 --> 00:44:46,999
what gets done is just hacks but
sometimes really cool ideas emerge and

2138
00:44:46,999 --> 00:44:47,009
sometimes really cool ideas emerge and
 

2139
00:44:47,009 --> 00:44:48,859
sometimes really cool ideas emerge and
then that gives us something to chew on

2140
00:44:48,859 --> 00:44:48,869
then that gives us something to chew on
 

2141
00:44:48,869 --> 00:44:52,489
then that gives us something to chew on
after that so I'm it's not a thing for

2142
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:52,499
after that so I'm it's not a thing for
 

2143
00:44:52,499 --> 00:44:55,459
after that so I'm it's not a thing for
me but I don't I don't regret that other

2144
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:55,469
me but I don't I don't regret that other
 

2145
00:44:55,469 --> 00:44:57,919
me but I don't I don't regret that other
people do it yeah it's like he says with

2146
00:44:57,919 --> 00:44:57,929
people do it yeah it's like he says with
 

2147
00:44:57,929 --> 00:44:59,870
people do it yeah it's like he says with
everything else that makes is good so

2148
00:44:59,870 --> 00:44:59,880
everything else that makes is good so
 

2149
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,399
everything else that makes is good so
jumping topics a little bit

2150
00:45:01,399 --> 00:45:01,409
jumping topics a little bit
 

2151
00:45:01,409 --> 00:45:03,169
jumping topics a little bit
he started the journal of machine

2152

2156
00:45:09,529 --> 00:45:09,539
editor-in-chief how did the publication
 

2157
00:45:09,539 --> 00:45:12,919
editor-in-chief how did the publication
come about and what do you think about

2158
00:45:12,919 --> 00:45:12,929
come about and what do you think about
 

2159
00:45:12,929 --> 00:45:16,370
come about and what do you think about
the current publishing model space and

2160
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:16,380
the current publishing model space and
 

2161

machine learning artificial intelligence

2162
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:18,089
machine learning artificial intelligence
 

2163
00:45:18,089 --> 00:45:22,069
machine learning artificial intelligence
ok good so it came about because there

2164
00:45:22,069 --> 00:45:22,079
ok good so it came about because there
 

2165
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:23,419
ok good so it came about because there
was a journal called machine learning

2166
00:45:23,419 --> 00:45:23,429
was a journal called machine learning
 

2167
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:24,949
was a journal called machine learning
which still exists which was owned by

2168
00:45:24,949 --> 00:45:24,959
which still exists which was owned by
 

2169
00:45:24,959 --> 00:45:29,479
which still exists which was owned by
Kluwer and there was I was on the

2170
00:45:29,479 --> 00:45:29,489
Kluwer and there was I was on the
 

2171
00:45:29,489 --> 00:45:30,620
Kluwer and there was I was on the
editorial board and we used to have

2172
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:30,630
editorial board and we used to have
 

2173
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:32,179
editorial board and we used to have
these meetings and really where we would

2174
00:45:32,179 --> 00:45:32,189
these meetings and really where we would
 

2175
00:45:32,189 --> 00:45:34,099
these meetings and really where we would
complain to Kluwer that it was too

2176
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:34,109
complain to Kluwer that it was too
 

2177
00:45:34,109 --> 00:45:35,569
complain to Kluwer that it was too
expensive for the libraries and that

2178
00:45:35,569 --> 00:45:35,579
expensive for the libraries and that
 

2179
00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:37,039
expensive for the libraries and that
people couldn't publish and we would

2180
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:37,049
people couldn't publish and we would
 

2181
00:45:37,049 --> 00:45:39,199
people couldn't publish and we would
really like to have some kind of relief

2182
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:39,209
really like to have some kind of relief
 

2183
00:45:39,209 --> 00:45:40,899
really like to have some kind of relief
on those friends and they would always

2184
00:45:40,899 --> 00:45:40,909
on those friends and they would always
 

2185
00:45:40,909 --> 00:45:45,829
on those friends and they would always
sympathize but not do anything so we

2186
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:45,839
sympathize but not do anything so we
 

2187
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:47,629
sympathize but not do anything so we
just decided to make a new journal and

2188
00:45:47,629 --> 00:45:47,639
just decided to make a new journal and
 

2189
00:45:47,639 --> 00:45:49,519
just decided to make a new journal and
there was the Journal of AI research

2190
00:45:49,519 --> 00:45:49,529
there was the Journal of AI research
 

2191
00:45:49,529 --> 00:45:51,919
there was the Journal of AI research
which has was on the same model which

2192
00:45:51,919 --> 00:45:51,929
which has was on the same model which
 

2193
00:45:51,929 --> 00:45:54,469
which has was on the same model which
had been and exists us for maybe five

2194
00:45:54,469 --> 00:45:54,479
had been and exists us for maybe five
 

2195
00:45:54,479 --> 00:45:56,329
had been and exists us for maybe five
years or so and it was going on pretty

2196
00:45:56,329 --> 00:45:56,339
years or so and it was going on pretty
 

2197
00:45:56,339 --> 00:46:01,399
years or so and it was going on pretty
well so uh we just made a new journal it

2198
00:46:01,399 --> 00:46:01,409
well so uh we just made a new journal it
 

2199
00:46:01,409 --> 00:46:04,549
well so uh we just made a new journal it
wasn't I mean they don't know I guess it

2200
00:46:04,549 --> 00:46:04,559
wasn't I mean they don't know I guess it
 

2201
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:06,019
wasn't I mean they don't know I guess it
was work but it wasn't that hard so

2202
00:46:06,019 --> 00:46:06,029
was work but it wasn't that hard so
 

2203
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:07,879
was work but it wasn't that hard so

2204
00:46:07,879 --> 00:46:07,889
basically the editorial board probably
 

2205
00:46:07,889 --> 00:46:12,349
basically the editorial board probably
75% of the editorial board of machine

2237
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,690
journal like this with basically I mean
for a long time I didn't even have a

00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:56,700
for a long time I didn't even have a
 

2239

2242
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:04,830
incorporate and the IP address and it
 

2243
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:06,740
incorporate and the IP address and it
cost a couple hundred dollars a year to

2244
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:06,750
cost a couple hundred dollars a year to
 

2245
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:09,410
cost a couple hundred dollars a year to
run it's a little bit more now but not

2247
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:12,170
run it's a little bit more now but not
that much more but that's because I

2248
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:12,180
that much more but that's because I
 

2249
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:15,440
that much more but that's because I
think computer scientists are competent

2250
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:15,450
think computer scientists are competent
 

2251
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:18,080
think computer scientists are competent
and autonomous in a way that many

2252
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:18,090
and autonomous in a way that many
 

2253
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:20,030
and autonomous in a way that many
scientists and other fields aren't I

2254
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:20,040
scientists and other fields aren't I
 

2255
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,890
scientists and other fields aren't I
mean at doing these kinds of things we

2256
00:47:21,890 --> 00:47:21,900
mean at doing these kinds of things we
 

2257
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:24,380
mean at doing these kinds of things we
already typeset around papers we all

2258
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:24,390
already typeset around papers we all
 

2259
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:26,270
already typeset around papers we all
have students and people who can hack a

2260
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:26,280
have students and people who can hack a
 

2261
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,400
have students and people who can hack a
website together in an afternoon so the

2262
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:28,410
website together in an afternoon so the
 

2263
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:30,470
website together in an afternoon so the
infrastructure for us was like not a

2264
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:30,480
infrastructure for us was like not a
 

2265
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,630
infrastructure for us was like not a
problem but for other people in other

2266
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:32,640
problem but for other people in other
 

2267
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,910
problem but for other people in other
fields it's a harder thing to do yeah

2268
00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:34,920
fields it's a harder thing to do yeah
 

2269
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:38,000
fields it's a harder thing to do yeah
and this kind of open access journal and

2270
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:38,010
and this kind of open access journal and
 

2271
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:39,590
and this kind of open access journal and
there's nevertheless one of the most

2272
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:39,600
there's nevertheless one of the most
 

2273
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:43,060
there's nevertheless one of the most
prestigious journals so it's not like a

2274
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:43,070
prestigious journals so it's not like a
 

2275
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:46,160
prestigious journals so it's not like a
prestige and it can be achieved without

2276
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:46,170
prestige and it can be achieved without
 

2277
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:48,110
prestige and it can be achieved without
any other paper it's not required yeah

2278
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:48,120
any other paper it's not required yeah
 

2279
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:51,200
any other paper it's not required yeah
for prestige it turns out yeah so on the

2280
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:51,210
for prestige it turns out yeah so on the
 

2281
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:53,270
for prestige it turns out yeah so on the
review process side of actually a long

2282
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:53,280
review process side of actually a long
 

2283
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,330
review process side of actually a long
time ago I don't remember when I

2284
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:55,340
time ago I don't remember when I
 

2285
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:58,070
time ago I don't remember when I
reviewed a paper where you were also a

2286
00:47:58,070 --> 00:47:58,080
reviewed a paper where you were also a
 

2287
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,870
reviewed a paper where you were also a
reviewer and I remember reading your if

2288
00:47:59,870 --> 00:47:59,880
reviewer and I remember reading your if
 

2289
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,670
reviewer and I remember reading your if
you were being influenced by it and it

2290
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:01,680
you were being influenced by it and it
 

2291
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:02,780
you were being influenced by it and it
was really well-written

2292
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:02,790
was really well-written
 

2293
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:04,850
was really well-written
it influenced how I write future reviews

2294
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:04,860
it influenced how I write future reviews
 

2295
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:09,350
it influenced how I write future reviews
you disagreed with me actually and you

2296
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:09,360
you disagreed with me actually and you
 

2297
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:13,070
you disagreed with me actually and you
made it my review but much better so I

2298
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:13,080
made it my review but much better so I
 

2299
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:16,640
made it my review but much better so I
but nevertheless the review process you

2300
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:16,650
but nevertheless the review process you
 

2301
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:20,480
but nevertheless the review process you
know has its flaws and how do you think

2302
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:20,490
know has its flaws and how do you think
 

2303
00:48:20,490 --> 00:48:22,640
know has its flaws and how do you think
what do you think works well how can it

2304
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:22,650
what do you think works well how can it
 

2305
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:25,310
what do you think works well how can it
be improved so actually when I started

2306
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:25,320
be improved so actually when I started
 

2307
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,780
be improved so actually when I started
Djamel our I wanted to do something

2308
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:26,790
Djamel our I wanted to do something
 

2309
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:28,829
Djamel our I wanted to do something
completely different

2310
00:48:28,829 --> 00:48:28,839
completely different
 

2311
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:32,099
completely different
and I didn't because it felt like we

2312
00:48:32,099 --> 00:48:32,109
and I didn't because it felt like we
 

2313
00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:34,079
and I didn't because it felt like we
needed a traditional Journal of record

2314
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:34,089
needed a traditional Journal of record
 

2315
00:48:34,089 --> 00:48:36,900
needed a traditional Journal of record
and so we just made jam art be almost

2316
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:36,910
and so we just made jam art be almost
 

2317
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:38,849
and so we just made jam art be almost
like a normal Journal except for the

2318
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:38,859
like a normal Journal except for the
 

2319
00:48:38,859 --> 00:48:42,799
like a normal Journal except for the
open-access parts of it basically

2320
00:48:42,799 --> 00:48:42,809

 

2321
00:48:42,809 --> 00:48:44,969

increasingly of course publication is

2322
00:48:44,969 --> 00:48:44,979
increasingly of course publication is
 

2323
00:48:44,979 --> 00:48:47,160
increasingly of course publication is
not even a sensible word you can publish

2324
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:47,170
not even a sensible word you can publish
 

2325
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:48,509
not even a sensible word you can publish
something about putting it in archives

2326
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:48,519
something about putting it in archives
 

2327
00:48:48,519 --> 00:48:50,059
something about putting it in archives
that I can publish everything tomorrow

2328
00:48:50,059 --> 00:48:50,069
that I can publish everything tomorrow
 

2329
00:48:50,069 --> 00:48:55,440
that I can publish everything tomorrow
so making stuff public is there's no

2330
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:55,450
so making stuff public is there's no
 

2331
00:48:55,450 --> 00:49:01,700
so making stuff public is there's no
barrier we still need curation and

2332
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:01,710
barrier we still need curation and
 

2333
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:04,440
barrier we still need curation and
evaluation I don't have time to read all

2334
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:04,450
evaluation I don't have time to read all
 

2335
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:13,019
evaluation I don't have time to read all
of our kyv and you could argue that kind

2336
00:49:13,019 --> 00:49:13,029
of our kyv and you could argue that kind
 

2337
00:49:13,029 --> 00:49:18,349
of our kyv and you could argue that kind
of social thumbs up being of articles

2338
00:49:18,349 --> 00:49:18,359
of social thumbs up being of articles
 

2339
00:49:18,359 --> 00:49:21,989
of social thumbs up being of articles
suffice is right you might say oh heck

2340
00:49:21,989 --> 00:49:21,999
suffice is right you might say oh heck
 

2341
00:49:21,999 --> 00:49:23,729
suffice is right you might say oh heck
with this we don't need journals at all

2342
00:49:23,729 --> 00:49:23,739
with this we don't need journals at all
 

2343
00:49:23,739 --> 00:49:25,650
with this we don't need journals at all
we'll put everything on archive and

2344
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:25,660
we'll put everything on archive and
 

2345
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:27,150
we'll put everything on archive and
people will upload and down about the

2346
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:27,160
people will upload and down about the
 

2347
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,309
people will upload and down about the

it's exciting and there's value in that
 

2501
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,470
it's exciting and there's value in that
and you get patted on the head for it

2502
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:46,480
and you get patted on the head for it
 

2503
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:50,840
and you get patted on the head for it
and so on but and some of that is fine

2504
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:50,850
and so on but and some of that is fine
 

2505
00:52:50,850 --> 00:52:56,500
and so on but and some of that is fine
but I'm worried that we're driving out

2506
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:56,510
but I'm worried that we're driving out
 

2507
00:52:56,510 --> 00:52:59,270
but I'm worried that we're driving out
people who would spend two years

2508
00:52:59,270 --> 00:52:59,280
people who would spend two years
 

2509
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,990
people who would spend two years
thinking about something back in my day

2510
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:03,000
thinking about something back in my day
 

2511
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,870
thinking about something back in my day
when we worked on our theses we did not

2512
00:53:05,870 --> 00:53:05,880
when we worked on our theses we did not
 

2513
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,940
when we worked on our theses we did not
publish papers you did your thesis for

2514
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:07,950
publish papers you did your thesis for
 

2515
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:08,599
publish papers you did your thesis for
years

2516
00:53:08,599 --> 00:53:08,609
years
 

2517
00:53:08,609 --> 00:53:10,490
years
you picked a hard problem and then you

2518
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:10,500
you picked a hard problem and then you
 

2519
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,440
you picked a hard problem and then you
worked and chewed on it and did stuff

2520
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:12,450
worked and chewed on it and did stuff
 

2521
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:15,770
worked and chewed on it and did stuff
and wasted time and a long time and when

2522
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:15,780
and wasted time and a long time and when
 

2523
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:17,300
and wasted time and a long time and when
it was roughly when it was done you

2524
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:17,310
it was roughly when it was done you
 

2525
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:21,320
it was roughly when it was done you
would write papers and so I I don't know

2526
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:21,330
would write papers and so I I don't know
 

2527
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:22,880
would write papers and so I I don't know
how to inside and I don't think that

2528
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:22,890
how to inside and I don't think that
 

2529
00:53:22,890 --> 00:53:25,130
how to inside and I don't think that
everybody has to work in that mode but I

2530
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:25,140
everybody has to work in that mode but I
 

2531
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:26,240
everybody has to work in that mode but I
think there's some problems that are

2532
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:26,250
think there's some problems that are
 

2533
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:28,910
think there's some problems that are
hard enough that it's important to have

2534
00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:28,920
hard enough that it's important to have
 

2535
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,800
hard enough that it's important to have
a longer her research horizon and I'm

2536
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:30,810
a longer her research horizon and I'm
 

2537
00:53:30,810 --> 00:53:33,170
a longer her research horizon and I'm
worried though we don't incentivize that

2538
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:33,180
worried though we don't incentivize that
 

2539
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:35,859
worried though we don't incentivize that
at all at this point in this current

2540
00:53:35,859 --> 00:53:35,869
at all at this point in this current
 

2541
00:53:35,869 --> 00:53:40,660
at all at this point in this current
structure right so what do you see as

2542
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:40,670
structure right so what do you see as
 

2543
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:43,430
structure right so what do you see as
what are your hopes and fears about the

2544
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:43,440
what are your hopes and fears about the
 

2545
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,160
what are your hopes and fears about the
future of AI and continuing this theme

2546
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:46,170
future of AI and continuing this theme
 

2547
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:50,120
future of AI and continuing this theme
so AI has gone through a few winters ups

2548
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:50,130
so AI has gone through a few winters ups
 

2549
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:52,730
so AI has gone through a few winters ups
and downs do you see another winter of

2550
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:52,740
and downs do you see another winter of
 

2551
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:54,230
and downs do you see another winter of
AI coming

2552
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:54,240
AI coming
 

2553
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:59,210
AI coming
are you more hopeful about making robots

2554
00:53:59,210 --> 00:53:59,220
are you more hopeful about making robots
 

2555
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:01,940
are you more hopeful about making robots
work as he said I think the cycles are

2556
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:01,950
work as he said I think the cycles are
 

2557
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:05,480
work as he said I think the cycles are
inevitable but I think each time we we

2558
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:05,490
inevitable but I think each time we we
 

2559
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:08,510
inevitable but I think each time we we
get higher right I mean so you know it's

2560
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:08,520
get higher right I mean so you know it's
 

2561
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,430
get higher right I mean so you know it's
like climbing some kind of landscape

2562
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:10,440
like climbing some kind of landscape
 

2563
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:15,440
like climbing some kind of landscape
with a noisy optimizer yeah so it's

2564
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:15,450
with a noisy optimizer yeah so it's
 

2565
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:18,080
with a noisy optimizer yeah so it's
clear that the the you know the deep

2566
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:18,090
clear that the the you know the deep
 

2567
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:21,950
clear that the the you know the deep
learning stuff has made deep and

2568
00:54:21,950 --> 00:54:21,960
learning stuff has made deep and
 

2569
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,990
learning stuff has made deep and
important improvements and so the

2570
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:24,000
important improvements and so the
 

2571
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,180
important improvements and so the
high-water mark is now higher I there's

2572
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:26,190
high-water mark is now higher I there's
 

2573
00:54:26,190 --> 00:54:29,330
high-water mark is now higher I there's
no question but of course I think people

2574
00:54:29,330 --> 00:54:29,340
no question but of course I think people
 

2575
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:34,160
no question but of course I think people
are over sawing and eventually investors

2576
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:34,170
are over sawing and eventually investors
 

2577
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:36,410
are over sawing and eventually investors
I guess and other people look around and

2578
00:54:36,410 --> 00:54:36,420
I guess and other people look around and
 

2579
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:39,470
I guess and other people look around and
say well you're not quite delivering on

2580
00:54:39,470 --> 00:54:39,480
say well you're not quite delivering on
 

2581
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,590
say well you're not quite delivering on
this grand claim and that wild

2582
00:54:41,590 --> 00:54:41,600
this grand claim and that wild
 

2583
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:44,510
this grand claim and that wild
hypothesis it's so probably it's going

2584
00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:44,520
hypothesis it's so probably it's going
 

2585
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:48,200
hypothesis it's so probably it's going
to crash them out and then it's okay I

2586
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:48,210
to crash them out and then it's okay I
 

2587
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:50,690
to crash them out and then it's okay I
mean but I don't I can't imagine that

2588
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:50,700
mean but I don't I can't imagine that
 

2589
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:53,540
mean but I don't I can't imagine that
there's like some awesome monotonic

2590
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:53,550
there's like some awesome monotonic
 

2591
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:56,109
there's like some awesome monotonic
improvement from here to human level III

2592
00:54:56,109 --> 00:54:56,119
improvement from here to human level III
 

2593
00:54:56,119 --> 00:55:00,410
improvement from here to human level III
so in you know I have to ask this

2594
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:00,420
so in you know I have to ask this
 

2595
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:02,060
so in you know I have to ask this
question I probably anticipate answers

2596
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:02,070
question I probably anticipate answers
 

2597
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:05,920
question I probably anticipate answers
the answers but do you have a worry

2598
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:05,930
the answers but do you have a worry
 

2599
00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:08,180
the answers but do you have a worry
short term and long term about the

2600
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:08,190
short term and long term about the
 

2601
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:09,240
short term and long term about the
existential

2602
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:09,250
existential
 

2603
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:14,910
existential
threats of AI and maybe short-term less

2604
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:14,920
threats of AI and maybe short-term less
 

2605
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:18,450
threats of AI and maybe short-term less
existential but more robots taking away

2606
00:55:18,450 --> 00:55:18,460
existential but more robots taking away
 

2607
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:22,920
existential but more robots taking away
jobs actually let me talk a little bit

2608
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:22,930
jobs actually let me talk a little bit
 

2609
00:55:22,930 --> 00:55:26,730
jobs actually let me talk a little bit
about utility actually I had an

2610
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:26,740
about utility actually I had an
 

2611
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,800
about utility actually I had an
interesting conversation with some

2612
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:28,810
interesting conversation with some
 

2613
00:55:28,810 --> 00:55:31,260
interesting conversation with some
military ethicists who wanted to talk to

2614
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:31,270
military ethicists who wanted to talk to
 

2615
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:34,860
military ethicists who wanted to talk to
me about autonomous weapons and there

2616
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:34,870
me about autonomous weapons and there
 

2617
00:55:34,870 --> 00:55:36,990
me about autonomous weapons and there
they were interesting smart

2618
00:55:36,990 --> 00:55:37,000
they were interesting smart
 

2619
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,150
they were interesting smart
well-educated guys who didn't know too

2620
00:55:39,150 --> 00:55:39,160
well-educated guys who didn't know too
 

2621
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,370
well-educated guys who didn't know too
much about AI are machine learning and

2622
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:41,380
much about AI are machine learning and
 

2623
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:43,230
much about AI are machine learning and
the first question they asked me was has

2624
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:43,240
the first question they asked me was has
 

2625
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,850
the first question they asked me was has
your robot ever done something you

2626
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:44,860
your robot ever done something you
 

2627
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:47,880
your robot ever done something you
didn't expect and I like burst out

2628
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:47,890
didn't expect and I like burst out
 

2629
00:55:47,890 --> 00:55:49,620
didn't expect and I like burst out
laughing because anybody who's ever done

2630
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:49,630
laughing because anybody who's ever done
 

2631
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:51,390
laughing because anybody who's ever done
something other robot right knows that

2632
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:51,400
something other robot right knows that
 

2633
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,730
something other robot right knows that
they don't do it and what I realized was

2634
00:55:53,730 --> 00:55:53,740
they don't do it and what I realized was
 

2635
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:56,340
they don't do it and what I realized was
that their model of how we program a

2636
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:56,350
that their model of how we program a
 

2637
00:55:56,350 --> 00:55:58,590
that their model of how we program a
robot was completely wrong their model

2638
00:55:58,590 --> 00:55:58,600
robot was completely wrong their model
 

2639
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:01,010
robot was completely wrong their model
of how we can put program robot was like

2640
00:56:01,010 --> 00:56:01,020
of how we can put program robot was like
 

2641
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:03,660
of how we can put program robot was like
Lego Mindstorms like oh go for it a

2642
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:03,670
Lego Mindstorms like oh go for it a
 

2643
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:06,060
Lego Mindstorms like oh go for it a
meter turn left take a picture do this

2644
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:06,070
meter turn left take a picture do this
 

2645
00:56:06,070 --> 00:56:07,890
meter turn left take a picture do this
do that and so if you have that model of

2646
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:07,900
do that and so if you have that model of
 

2647
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:10,740
do that and so if you have that model of
programming then it's true it's kind of

2648
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:10,750
programming then it's true it's kind of
 

2649
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:12,630
programming then it's true it's kind of
weird that your robot would do something

2650
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:12,640
weird that your robot would do something
 

2651
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:15,000
weird that your robot would do something
that you didn't anticipate but the fact

2652
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:15,010
that you didn't anticipate but the fact
 

2653
00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:17,100
that you didn't anticipate but the fact
is and and actually so now this is my

2654
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:17,110
is and and actually so now this is my
 

2655
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:18,480
is and and actually so now this is my
new educational mission if I have to

2656
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:18,490
new educational mission if I have to
 

2657
00:56:18,490 --> 00:56:21,950
new educational mission if I have to
talk to non experts I try to teach them

2658
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:21,960
talk to non experts I try to teach them
 

2659
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:24,840
talk to non experts I try to teach them
the idea that we don't operate we

2660
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:24,850
the idea that we don't operate we
 

2661
00:56:24,850 --> 00:56:26,970
the idea that we don't operate we
operate at least one or maybe many

2662
00:56:26,970 --> 00:56:26,980
operate at least one or maybe many
 

2663
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:28,770
operate at least one or maybe many
levels of abstraction about that and we

2664
00:56:28,770 --> 00:56:28,780
levels of abstraction about that and we
 

2665
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:31,230
levels of abstraction about that and we
say oh here's a hypothesis class maybe

2666
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:31,240
say oh here's a hypothesis class maybe
 

2667
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,330
say oh here's a hypothesis class maybe
it's a space of plans or maybe it's a

2668
00:56:33,330 --> 00:56:33,340
it's a space of plans or maybe it's a
 

2669
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:35,790
it's a space of plans or maybe it's a
space of classifiers or whatever but

2670
00:56:35,790 --> 00:56:35,800
space of classifiers or whatever but
 

2671
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,380
space of classifiers or whatever but
there's some set of answers and an

2672
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:37,390
there's some set of answers and an
 

2673
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:39,870
there's some set of answers and an
objective function and then we work on

2674
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:39,880
objective function and then we work on
 

2675
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:41,880
objective function and then we work on
some optimization method that tries to

2676
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:41,890
some optimization method that tries to
 

2677
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:44,370
some optimization method that tries to
optimize a solution a solution in that

2678
00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:44,380
optimize a solution a solution in that
 

2679
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:47,100
optimize a solution a solution in that
class and we don't know what solution

2680
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:47,110
class and we don't know what solution
 

2681
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:49,530
class and we don't know what solution
that's going to come out right so I

2682
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:49,540
that's going to come out right so I
 

2683
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:51,300
that's going to come out right so I
think it's important to communicate that

2684
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:51,310
think it's important to communicate that
 

2685
00:56:51,310 --> 00:56:53,400
think it's important to communicate that
so I read of course probably people who

2686
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:53,410
so I read of course probably people who
 

2687
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:55,140
so I read of course probably people who
listen to this they they know that

2688
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:55,150
listen to this they they know that
 

2689
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:56,880
listen to this they they know that
lesson but I think it's really critical

2690
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:56,890
lesson but I think it's really critical
 

2691
00:56:56,890 --> 00:56:58,920
lesson but I think it's really critical
to communicate that lesson and then lots

2692
00:56:58,920 --> 00:56:58,930
to communicate that lesson and then lots
 

2693
00:56:58,930 --> 00:57:00,720
to communicate that lesson and then lots
of people are now talking about you know

2694
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:00,730
of people are now talking about you know
 

2695
00:57:00,730 --> 00:57:03,780
of people are now talking about you know
the value alignment problem so you want

2696
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:03,790
the value alignment problem so you want
 

2697
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:07,350
the value alignment problem so you want
to be sure as robots or software systems

2698
00:57:07,350 --> 00:57:07,360
to be sure as robots or software systems
 

2699
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,930
to be sure as robots or software systems
get more competent that their objectives

2700
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:09,940
get more competent that their objectives
 

2701
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:11,870
get more competent that their objectives
are aligned with your objectives or that

2702
00:57:11,870 --> 00:57:11,880
are aligned with your objectives or that
 

2703
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:14,370
are aligned with your objectives or that
our objectives are compatible in some

2704
00:57:14,370 --> 00:57:14,380
our objectives are compatible in some
 

2705
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:16,200
our objectives are compatible in some
way or we have a good way of mediating

2706
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:16,210
way or we have a good way of mediating
 

2707
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:18,840
way or we have a good way of mediating
when they have different objectives and

2708
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:18,850
when they have different objectives and
 

2709
00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:21,060
when they have different objectives and
so I think it is important to start

2710
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:21,070
so I think it is important to start
 

2711
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:22,640
so I think it is important to start
thinking in terms like

2712
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:22,650
thinking in terms like
 

2713
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:24,950
thinking in terms like
you don't have to be freaked out by the

2714
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:24,960
you don't have to be freaked out by the
 

2715
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:28,039
you don't have to be freaked out by the
robot apocalypse - except that it's

2716
00:57:28,039 --> 00:57:28,049
robot apocalypse - except that it's
 

2717
00:57:28,049 --> 00:57:29,239
robot apocalypse - except that it's
important to think about objective

2718
00:57:29,239 --> 00:57:29,249
important to think about objective
 

2719
00:57:29,249 --> 00:57:31,210
important to think about objective
functions of value alignment yes and

2720
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:31,220
functions of value alignment yes and
 

2721
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:33,589
functions of value alignment yes and
that you have to really everyone who's

2722
00:57:33,589 --> 00:57:33,599
that you have to really everyone who's
 

2723
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:35,569
that you have to really everyone who's
done optimization knows that you have to

2724
00:57:35,569 --> 00:57:35,579
done optimization knows that you have to
 

2725
00:57:35,579 --> 00:57:37,370
done optimization knows that you have to
be careful what you wish for that ah you

2726
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:37,380
be careful what you wish for that ah you
 

2727
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:38,839
be careful what you wish for that ah you
know sometimes you get the optimal

2728
00:57:38,839 --> 00:57:38,849
know sometimes you get the optimal
 

2729
00:57:38,849 --> 00:57:40,670
know sometimes you get the optimal
solution and you realize man that was

2730
00:57:40,670 --> 00:57:40,680
solution and you realize man that was
 

2731
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:44,019
solution and you realize man that was
that objective was wrong so

2732
00:57:44,019 --> 00:57:44,029
that objective was wrong so
 

2733
00:57:44,029 --> 00:57:46,549
that objective was wrong so
pragmatically in the shortest term it

2734
00:57:46,549 --> 00:57:46,559
pragmatically in the shortest term it
 

2735
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:49,700
pragmatically in the shortest term it
seems to me that that those are really

2736
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:49,710
seems to me that that those are really
 

2737
00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:51,589
seems to me that that those are really
interesting and critical questions and

2738
00:57:51,589 --> 00:57:51,599
interesting and critical questions and
 

2739
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:53,420
interesting and critical questions and
the idea that we're gonna go from being

2740
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:53,430
the idea that we're gonna go from being
 

2741
00:57:53,430 --> 00:57:55,489
the idea that we're gonna go from being
people who engineer algorithms to being

2742
00:57:55,489 --> 00:57:55,499
people who engineer algorithms to being
 

2743
00:57:55,499 --> 00:57:57,319
people who engineer algorithms to being
people who engineer objective functions

2744
00:57:57,319 --> 00:57:57,329
people who engineer objective functions
 

2745
00:57:57,329 --> 00:57:59,870
people who engineer objective functions
I think that's that's definitely going

2746
00:57:59,870 --> 00:57:59,880
I think that's that's definitely going
 

2747
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,819
I think that's that's definitely going
to happen and that's gonna change our

2748
00:58:01,819 --> 00:58:01,829
to happen and that's gonna change our
 

2749
00:58:01,829 --> 00:58:03,650
to happen and that's gonna change our
thinking and methodology and we're gonna

2750
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:03,660
thinking and methodology and we're gonna
 

2751
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:06,230
thinking and methodology and we're gonna
you started at Stanford philosophy

2752
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:06,240
you started at Stanford philosophy
 

2753
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:12,309
you started at Stanford philosophy
that's where she comes I will go back to

2754
00:58:12,309 --> 00:58:12,319

 

2755
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:15,289

because as we also know as machine

2756
00:58:15,289 --> 00:58:15,299
because as we also know as machine
 

2757
00:58:15,299 --> 00:58:17,599
because as we also know as machine
learning people right when you're design

2758
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:17,609
learning people right when you're design
 

2759
00:58:17,609 --> 00:58:19,039
learning people right when you're design
in fact this is the lecture I gave in

2760
00:58:19,039 --> 00:58:19,049
in fact this is the lecture I gave in
 

2761
00:58:19,049 --> 00:58:21,559
in fact this is the lecture I gave in
class today when you design an objective

2762
00:58:21,559 --> 00:58:21,569
class today when you design an objective
 

2763
00:58:21,569 --> 00:58:22,999
class today when you design an objective
function you have to worry about with

2764
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:23,009
function you have to worry about with
 

2765
00:58:23,009 --> 00:58:23,480
function you have to worry about with
hats

2766
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:23,490
hats
 

2767
00:58:23,490 --> 00:58:25,819
hats
there's the Hat that says what do I want

2768
00:58:25,819 --> 00:58:25,829
there's the Hat that says what do I want
 

2769
00:58:25,829 --> 00:58:28,039
there's the Hat that says what do I want
and there's the hat that says but I know

2770
00:58:28,039 --> 00:58:28,049
and there's the hat that says but I know
 

2771
00:58:28,049 --> 00:58:30,049
and there's the hat that says but I know
what my optimizer can do to some degree

2772
00:58:30,049 --> 00:58:30,059
what my optimizer can do to some degree
 

2773
00:58:30,059 --> 00:58:31,609
what my optimizer can do to some degree
and I have to take that into account

2774
00:58:31,609 --> 00:58:31,619
and I have to take that into account
 

2775
00:58:31,619 --> 00:58:34,700
and I have to take that into account
okay so it's it's always a trade-off and

2776
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:34,710
okay so it's it's always a trade-off and
 

2777
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:36,370
okay so it's it's always a trade-off and
we have to kind of be mindful of that

2778
00:58:36,370 --> 00:58:36,380
we have to kind of be mindful of that
 

2779
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:40,700
we have to kind of be mindful of that
the part about taking people's jobs I

2780
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:40,710
the part about taking people's jobs I
 

2781
00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:43,370
the part about taking people's jobs I
understand that that's important I don't

2782
00:58:43,370 --> 00:58:43,380
understand that that's important I don't
 

2783
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:47,029
understand that that's important I don't
understand sociology or economics or

2784
00:58:47,029 --> 00:58:47,039
understand sociology or economics or
 

2785
00:58:47,039 --> 00:58:49,009
understand sociology or economics or
people very well so I don't know how to

2786
00:58:49,009 --> 00:58:49,019
people very well so I don't know how to
 

2787
00:58:49,019 --> 00:58:51,289
people very well so I don't know how to
think about that so that's yeah so there

2788
00:58:51,289 --> 00:58:51,299
think about that so that's yeah so there
 

2789
00:58:51,299 --> 00:58:53,630
think about that so that's yeah so there
might be a sociological aspect there the

2790
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:53,640
might be a sociological aspect there the
 

2791
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:55,549
might be a sociological aspect there the
economical aspect that's very difficult

2792
00:58:55,549 --> 00:58:55,559
economical aspect that's very difficult
 

2793
00:58:55,559 --> 00:58:57,499
economical aspect that's very difficult
to say well okay I mean I think other

2794
00:58:57,499 --> 00:58:57,509
to say well okay I mean I think other
 

2795
00:58:57,509 --> 00:58:58,579
to say well okay I mean I think other
people should be thinking about it but

2796
00:58:58,579 --> 00:58:58,589
people should be thinking about it but
 

2797
00:58:58,589 --> 00:59:00,829
people should be thinking about it but
I'm just that's not my strength so what

2798
00:59:00,829 --> 00:59:00,839
I'm just that's not my strength so what
 

2799
00:59:00,839 --> 00:59:02,329
I'm just that's not my strength so what
do you think is the most exciting area

2800
00:59:02,329 --> 00:59:02,339
do you think is the most exciting area
 

2801
00:59:02,339 --> 00:59:04,729
do you think is the most exciting area
of research in the short term for the

2802
00:59:04,729 --> 00:59:04,739
of research in the short term for the
 

2803
00:59:04,739 --> 00:59:07,099
of research in the short term for the
community and for your for yourself well

2804
00:59:07,099 --> 00:59:07,109
community and for your for yourself well
 

2805
00:59:07,109 --> 00:59:08,690
community and for your for yourself well
so I mean there's the story I've been

2806
00:59:08,690 --> 00:59:08,700
so I mean there's the story I've been
 

2807
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:11,739
so I mean there's the story I've been
telling about how to engineer

2808
00:59:11,739 --> 00:59:11,749
telling about how to engineer
 

2809
00:59:11,749 --> 00:59:15,319
telling about how to engineer
intelligent robots so that's what we

2810
00:59:15,319 --> 00:59:15,329
intelligent robots so that's what we
 

2811
00:59:15,329 --> 00:59:16,789
intelligent robots so that's what we
want to do we all kind of want to do

2812
00:59:16,789 --> 00:59:16,799
want to do we all kind of want to do
 

2813
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:18,559
want to do we all kind of want to do
well I mean some set of us want to do

2814
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:18,569
well I mean some set of us want to do
 

2815
00:59:18,569 --> 00:59:20,479
well I mean some set of us want to do
this and the question is what's the most

2816
00:59:20,479 --> 00:59:20,489
this and the question is what's the most
 

2817
00:59:20,489 --> 00:59:23,210
this and the question is what's the most
effective strategy and we've tried and

2818
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:23,220
effective strategy and we've tried and
 

2819
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:24,589
effective strategy and we've tried and
there's a bunch of different things you

2820
00:59:24,589 --> 00:59:24,599
there's a bunch of different things you
 

2821
00:59:24,599 --> 00:59:26,930
there's a bunch of different things you
could do at the extremes right one super

2822
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:26,940
could do at the extremes right one super
 

2823
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:29,749
could do at the extremes right one super
extreme is we do introspection then we

2824
00:59:29,749 --> 00:59:29,759
extreme is we do introspection then we
 

2825
00:59:29,759 --> 00:59:31,999
extreme is we do introspection then we
write a program okay that has not worked

2826
00:59:31,999 --> 00:59:32,009
write a program okay that has not worked
 

2827
00:59:32,009 --> 00:59:32,660
write a program okay that has not worked
out very well

2828
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:32,670
out very well
 

2829
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:35,059
out very well
another extreme is we take a giant bunch

2830
00:59:35,059 --> 00:59:35,069
another extreme is we take a giant bunch
 

2831
00:59:35,069 --> 00:59:36,020
another extreme is we take a giant bunch
of neural

2832
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:36,030
of neural
 

2833
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:37,550
of neural
and we trying to train it up to do

2834
00:59:37,550 --> 00:59:37,560
and we trying to train it up to do
 

2835
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:38,839
and we trying to train it up to do
something I don't think that's gonna

2836
00:59:38,839 --> 00:59:38,849
something I don't think that's gonna
 

2837
00:59:38,849 --> 00:59:42,650
something I don't think that's gonna
work either so the question is what's

2838
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:42,660
work either so the question is what's
 

2839
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:44,960
work either so the question is what's
the middle ground and and again this

2840
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:44,970
the middle ground and and again this
 

2841
00:59:44,970 --> 00:59:48,920
the middle ground and and again this
isn't a theological question or anything

2842
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:48,930
isn't a theological question or anything
 

2843
00:59:48,930 --> 00:59:50,990
isn't a theological question or anything
like that it's just like going how do

2844
00:59:50,990 --> 00:59:51,000
like that it's just like going how do
 

2845
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,820
like that it's just like going how do
just how do we what's the best way to

2846
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:52,830
just how do we what's the best way to
 

2847
00:59:52,830 --> 00:59:56,240
just how do we what's the best way to
make this work out and I think it's

2848
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:56,250
make this work out and I think it's
 

2849
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:58,880
make this work out and I think it's
clear it's a combination of learning to

2850
00:59:58,880 --> 00:59:58,890
clear it's a combination of learning to
 

2851
00:59:58,890 --> 01:00:00,440
clear it's a combination of learning to
me it's clear it's a combination of

2852
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:00,450
me it's clear it's a combination of
 

2853
01:00:00,450 --> 01:00:03,349
me it's clear it's a combination of
learning and not learning and what

2854
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:03,359
learning and not learning and what
 

2855
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:04,730
learning and not learning and what
should that combination be and what's

2856
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:04,740
should that combination be and what's
 

2857
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:06,170
should that combination be and what's
the stuff we built in so to me that's

2858
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:06,180
the stuff we built in so to me that's
 

2859
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:08,120
the stuff we built in so to me that's
the most compelling question and when

2860
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:08,130
the most compelling question and when
 

2861
01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:10,540
the most compelling question and when
you say engineer robots you mean

2862
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:10,550
you say engineer robots you mean
 

2863
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:12,650
you say engineer robots you mean
engineering systems that work in the

2864
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:12,660
engineering systems that work in the
 

2865
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:16,900
engineering systems that work in the
real world is that that's the emphasis

2866
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:16,910
real world is that that's the emphasis
 

2867
01:00:16,910 --> 01:00:20,390
real world is that that's the emphasis
last question which robots

2868
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:20,400
last question which robots
 

2869
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,849
last question which robots
or robot is your favorite from science

2870
01:00:22,849 --> 01:00:22,859
or robot is your favorite from science
 

2871
01:00:22,859 --> 01:00:25,700
or robot is your favorite from science
fiction so you can go with Star Wars

2872
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:25,710
fiction so you can go with Star Wars
 

2873
01:00:25,710 --> 01:00:29,930
fiction so you can go with Star Wars
Arthur r2d2 or you can go with more

2874
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:29,940
Arthur r2d2 or you can go with more
 

2875
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:39,530
Arthur r2d2 or you can go with more
modern maybe Hal this is this is back to

2876
01:00:39,530 --> 01:00:39,540
modern maybe Hal this is this is back to
 

2877
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:43,460
modern maybe Hal this is this is back to
you like to make robots work in the real

2878
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:43,470
you like to make robots work in the real
 

2879
01:00:43,470 --> 01:00:46,820
you like to make robots work in the real
world here not Madden I mean I love the

2880
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:46,830
world here not Madden I mean I love the
 

2881
01:00:46,830 --> 01:00:49,460
world here not Madden I mean I love the
process and I care more about the

2882
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:49,470
process and I care more about the
 

2883
01:00:49,470 --> 01:00:52,609
process and I care more about the
process engineering process yeah I mean

2884
01:00:52,609 --> 01:00:52,619
process engineering process yeah I mean
 

2885
01:00:52,619 --> 01:00:54,079
process engineering process yeah I mean
I do research because it's fun not

2886
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:54,089
I do research because it's fun not
 

2887
01:00:54,089 --> 01:00:56,859
I do research because it's fun not
because I care about what we produce

2888
01:00:56,859 --> 01:00:56,869
because I care about what we produce
 

2889
01:00:56,869 --> 01:00:59,270
