806
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:53,780
topic one challenge is that the problem
 

807
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,750
topic one challenge is that the problem
was incredibly well-defined we were able

808

was incredibly well-defined we were able
 

809
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,090
was incredibly well-defined we were able
for a while to drive the old topic van

challenge course which had been used the

00:15:59,650 --> 00:15:59,660
challenge course which had been used the
 

813
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,830
challenge course which had been used the
year before and then at some reason we

814
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:02,840
year before and then at some reason we
 

815
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,450
year before and then at some reason we
were kicked out of the region so we had

816
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:04,460
were kicked out of the region so we had
 

817
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,950
were kicked out of the region so we had
to go to different desert the Sonoran

818
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:05,960
to go to different desert the Sonoran
 

819
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,350

love computers because you could tell
them to do something and they actually

them to do something and they actually
 

925

them to do something and they actually
did it it was very cool and you could

today and then you go a day later and
 

949
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,520
today and then you go a day later and
you stop doing it so you have to so then

950
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:30,530
you stop doing it so you have to so then
 

951
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:31,990
you stop doing it so you have to so then
a question really became how can you put

952

00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:02,780
I can easily impress my colleagues
 

1443
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,720
I can easily impress my colleagues
that's that's that that is much easier

1444
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:04,730
that's that's that that is much easier
 

1445

that's that's that that is much easier
but impressing my grandmother is very

1446
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:05,990
but impressing my grandmother is very
 

1447
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:09,520
but impressing my grandmother is very
very hard so I've always thought if I

1448
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:09,530
very hard so I've always thought if I
 

1449
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:11,919
very hard so I've always thought if I
can build a self-driving car and and my

1450
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:11,929
can build a self-driving car and and my
 

1451
00:28:11,929 --> 00:28:13,540
can build a self-driving car and and my
grandmother can use it even after she

1452
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:13,550
grandmother can use it even after she
 

1453
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:15,640
grandmother can use it even after she
loses her driving privileges or Sheldon

1454
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:15,650
loses her driving privileges or Sheldon
 

1455
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:19,480
loses her driving privileges or Sheldon
can use it or we save maybe a million

1456
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:19,490
can use it or we save maybe a million
 

1457
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,100
can use it or we save maybe a million
lives a year they would be very

00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:21,110
lives a year they would be very
 

1459
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:23,110
lives a year they would be very
impressive and then there's so many

1460
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:23,120
impressive and then there's so many
 

1461
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,340
impressive and then there's so many
problems like these like there's a

problems like these like there's a
 

1463
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:26,140
problems like these like there's a
problem of curing cancer or I'll if

army of ten thousand at Stanford so
 

1477

DARPA Grand Challenge was
 

1483
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,460
DARPA Grand Challenge was
beautiful because it told me what this

1484

beautiful because it told me what this
 

1485
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:46,690

you think what academia could aspire to
is to build a prototype that's the

good system and I think America has the
 

1545
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,820

this nation so when I worked at Carnegie

1692
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:45,800
this nation so when I worked at Carnegie
 

1693
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,980

computer science university but there
 

1697
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,660
computer science university but there
wasn't those people in Pittsburgh that

1698
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:52,670
wasn't those people in Pittsburgh that
 

1699
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,880
wasn't those people in Pittsburgh that
would be able to take these very fine

would be able to take these very fine
 

1701
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,320
would be able to take these very fine
computer science ideas and turn them

1702

that symbiosis seemed to exist pretty

1706
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:03,110
that symbiosis seemed to exist pretty
 

1707
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,990
that symbiosis seemed to exist pretty
much only in Silicon Valley and maybe a

1708
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:05,000
much only in Silicon Valley and maybe a
 

1709
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,360
much only in Silicon Valley and maybe a
bit in Boston in Austin yeah with

1710
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:07,370
bit in Boston in Austin yeah with
 

1711
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:09,340
bit in Boston in Austin yeah with
Stanford that's it was it's really

1712
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:09,350
Stanford that's it was it's really
 

1713
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,420
Stanford that's it was it's really
really interesting

1714
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:10,430
really interesting
 

1715
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:13,450
really interesting
so if we look a little bit further on

1716
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:13,460
so if we look a little bit further on
 

1717
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:17,230
so if we look a little bit further on
from the the DARPA Grand Challenge and

1718
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:17,240
from the the DARPA Grand Challenge and
 

1719
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,520
from the the DARPA Grand Challenge and
the launch of the Google self-driving

1720
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:18,530
the launch of the Google self-driving
 

1721
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:22,150
the launch of the Google self-driving
car what do you see is the state the

1722
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:22,160
car what do you see is the state the
 

1723
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,310
car what do you see is the state the
challenges of autonomous vehicles as

1724
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:24,320
challenges of autonomous vehicles as
 

1725
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:28,030
challenges of autonomous vehicles as
they are now is actually achieving that

1726
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:28,040
they are now is actually achieving that
 

1727
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,430
they are now is actually achieving that
huge scale and having a huge impact on

1728
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:30,440
huge scale and having a huge impact on

00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:34,060
huge scale and having a huge impact on
society I'm extremely proud of what what

1730
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:34,070
society I'm extremely proud of what what
 

1731
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,710
society I'm extremely proud of what what
has been accomplished and again I'm

1732
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:35,720
has been accomplished and again I'm
 

1733
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,120
has been accomplished and again I'm
taking a lot of credit for the work for

1734
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:37,130
taking a lot of credit for the work for
 

1735
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:40,090
taking a lot of credit for the work for
us and I'm actually very optimistic and

1736
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:40,100
us and I'm actually very optimistic and
 

1737
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,430
us and I'm actually very optimistic and
and people have been kind of worrying is

1738
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:42,440
and people have been kind of worrying is
 

1739
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,380
and people have been kind of worrying is
it too fast as to slow I salute there

1740
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:44,390
it too fast as to slow I salute there
 

1741
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:46,900
it too fast as to slow I salute there
yet and so on it is actually quite an

1742
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:46,910
yet and so on it is actually quite an
 

1743
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:49,800
yet and so on it is actually quite an
interesting hard problem and in that a

1744
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:49,810
interesting hard problem and in that a
 

1745
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:52,240
interesting hard problem and in that a
self-driving car to build one that

1746
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:52,250
self-driving car to build one that
 

1747
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:55,630
self-driving car to build one that
manages 90% of the problems encountered

1748
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:55,640
manages 90% of the problems encountered
 

1749
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,430
manages 90% of the problems encountered
in everyday driving is easy we can

1750
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:57,440
in everyday driving is easy we can
 

1751
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,770
in everyday driving is easy we can
literally do this over a weekend to do

1752
00:33:59,770 --> 00:33:59,780
literally do this over a weekend to do
 

1753
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:02,650
literally do this over a weekend to do
99% might take a month then there's 1%

1754
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:02,660
99% might take a month then there's 1%
 

1755
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:05,110
99% might take a month then there's 1%
left so 1% would mean that you still

1756
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:05,120
left so 1% would mean that you still
 

1757
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,350
left so 1% would mean that you still
have a fatal accident every week very

1758
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:08,360
have a fatal accident every week very
 

1759
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,570
have a fatal accident every week very
unacceptable so now you work on this 1%

1760
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:10,580
unacceptable so now you work on this 1%
 

1761
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:13,780
unacceptable so now you work on this 1%
and the 99% of there were any 1% is

1762
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:13,790
and the 99% of there were any 1% is
 

1763
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:16,030
and the 99% of there were any 1% is
actually still a relatively easy but now

1764
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:16,040
actually still a relatively easy but now
 

1765
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,260
actually still a relatively easy but now
you're down to like a hundredth of one

1766

you're down to like a hundredth of one
 

1767
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:18,940
you're down to like a hundredth of one
percent and it's still completely

1768
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:18,950
percent and it's still completely
 

1769
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:21,880
percent and it's still completely
unacceptable in terms of safety so the

1770
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:21,890
unacceptable in terms of safety so the
 

1771
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:23,680
unacceptable in terms of safety so the
variety of things you encounter are just

variety of things you encounter are just
 

1773
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:25,330
variety of things you encounter are just
enormous and that gives me enormous

1774
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:25,340

I think the next step is gonna be to
 

1831
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:32,310
I think the next step is gonna be to
down cost it to harden it did that

enough to drive around without a person

1856
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:57,310
enough to drive around without a person
 

1857
00:35:57,310 --> 00:36:00,550
enough to drive around without a person
inside the car and that's that the next

00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:00,560
inside the car and that's that the next
 

1859
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,230
inside the car and that's that the next
magical hurdle will be able to send

these vehicles around completely empty
 

1863
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,300
these vehicles around completely empty
in traffic and I think I'm gonna wait

1864
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:07,310
in traffic and I think I'm gonna wait

the insight was that two things one is
existing universities will be very slow

2200
00:42:48,279 --> 00:42:48,289
existing universities will be very slow
 

2201
00:42:48,289 --> 00:42:50,589

to move because the departmental ice and

2202
00:42:50,589 --> 00:42:50,599
to move because the departmental ice and
 

2203
00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:51,880
to move because the departmental ice and
there's no department for self-driving

universities just did this which none so

2218
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:08,150
universities just did this which none so
 

2219
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:09,969

universities are super selective so how

2226
00:43:16,539 --> 00:43:16,549
universities are super selective so how
 

2227
00:43:16,549 --> 00:43:18,670
universities are super selective so how
about people in India how about people

2228
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:18,680
about people in India how about people
 

2229
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,799
about people in India how about people
in China or in the Middle East or

00:43:20,799 --> 00:43:20,809
in China or in the Middle East or
 

2231
00:43:20,809 --> 00:43:24,339
in China or in the Middle East or
Indonesia or Africa right should those

2232
00:43:24,339 --> 00:43:24,349
Indonesia or Africa right should those
 

2233
00:43:24,349 --> 00:43:26,410
Indonesia or Africa right should those
be excluded from the skill of building

2234
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:26,420
be excluded from the skill of building
 

2235
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:27,880

self-driving cars are there any dumber

2236
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:27,890
self-driving cars are there any dumber
 

2237
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:30,819
self-driving cars are there any dumber
than we are any less privileged and the

2238
00:43:30,819 --> 00:43:30,829
than we are any less privileged and the
 

2239
00:43:30,829 --> 00:43:33,279
than we are any less privileged and the
answer is we should just give everybody

2240
00:43:33,279 --> 00:43:33,289
answer is we should just give everybody
 

2241
00:43:33,289 --> 00:43:35,709
answer is we should just give everybody
the skill to build a self-driving car

2242
00:43:35,709 --> 00:43:35,719
the skill to build a self-driving car
 

2243
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:38,170
the skill to build a self-driving car
because if we do this then we have like

2244
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:38,180
because if we do this then we have like
 

2245
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:40,390
because if we do this then we have like
a thousand self-driving car startups and

2246
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:40,400
a thousand self-driving car startups and
 

2247
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,069
a thousand self-driving car startups and
if 10 percent succeed that's like a

2248
00:43:42,069 --> 00:43:42,079
if 10 percent succeed that's like a
 

2249
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:44,140
if 10 percent succeed that's like a
hundred that means hundred countries now

2250
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:44,150
hundred that means hundred countries now
 

2251
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:45,930
hundred that means hundred countries now
we have self-driving cars and be safer

2252
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:45,940
we have self-driving cars and be safer
 

2253
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:48,599
we have self-driving cars and be safer
it's kind of interesting to imagine

2254
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:48,609
it's kind of interesting to imagine
 

2255
00:43:48,609 --> 00:43:52,660
it's kind of interesting to imagine
impossible to qualify but the number the

2256
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:52,670
impossible to qualify but the number the
 

2257
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:54,459
impossible to qualify but the number the
you know over a period of several

2258
00:43:54,459 --> 00:43:54,469
you know over a period of several
 

2259
00:43:54,469 --> 00:43:56,499
you know over a period of several
decades the impact that has like a

2260
00:43:56,499 --> 00:43:56,509
decades the impact that has like a
 

2261
00:43:56,509 --> 00:43:59,109
decades the impact that has like a
single course like a ripple effect of

2262
00:43:59,109 --> 00:43:59,119
single course like a ripple effect of
 

2263
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:02,620
single course like a ripple effect of
society if you just recently thought the

2264
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:02,630
society if you just recently thought the
 

2265
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:05,099
society if you just recently thought the
Android and who was creator of cosmos

2266
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:05,109
Android and who was creator of cosmos
 

2267
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:08,319
Android and who was creator of cosmos
show it's interesting to think about how

2268
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:08,329
show it's interesting to think about how
 

2269
00:44:08,329 --> 00:44:10,630
show it's interesting to think about how
many scientists that show launched yes

2270
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:10,640
many scientists that show launched yes
 

2271
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,270
many scientists that show launched yes
and so it's really

2272
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:13,280
and so it's really
 

2273
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,550
and so it's really
in terms of impact I can't imagine a

2274
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:16,560
in terms of impact I can't imagine a
 

2275
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,080
in terms of impact I can't imagine a
better course than the self-driving car

2276
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:18,090
better course than the self-driving car
 

2277
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:20,480
better course than the self-driving car
course that's you know the there's other

2278
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:20,490
course that's you know the there's other
 

2279
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:22,100
course that's you know the there's other
more specific disciplines like deep

2280
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:22,110
more specific disciplines like deep
 

2281
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:23,750
more specific disciplines like deep
learning and so on that Udacity is also

2282
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:23,760
learning and so on that Udacity is also
 

2283
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,250
learning and so on that Udacity is also
teaching but self-driving cars it's

2284
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:25,260
teaching but self-driving cars it's
 

2285
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:27,020
teaching but self-driving cars it's
really really interesting course yeah

2286
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:27,030
really really interesting course yeah
 

2287
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:28,700
really really interesting course yeah
and it came at the right moment it came

2288
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:28,710
and it came at the right moment it came
 

2289
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:30,770
and it came at the right moment it came
at a time when there were a bunch of

2290
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:30,780
at a time when there were a bunch of
 

2291
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:33,590
at a time when there were a bunch of
aqua huggers aqua hire as a acquisition

2292
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:33,600
aqua huggers aqua hire as a acquisition
 

2293
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,360
aqua huggers aqua hire as a acquisition
of a company not for its technology or

2294
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:35,370
of a company not for its technology or
 

2295
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:36,860
of a company not for its technology or
its products or business but for its

2296
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:36,870
its products or business but for its
 

2297
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:37,420
its products or business but for its
people

2298
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:37,430
people
 

2299
00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:39,950
people
so aqua hire means maybe the company of

2300
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:39,960
so aqua hire means maybe the company of
 

2301
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,690
so aqua hire means maybe the company of
70 people they have no product yet but

2302
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:41,700
70 people they have no product yet but
 

2303
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,580
70 people they have no product yet but
they're super smart people and he pays

2304
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:43,590
they're super smart people and he pays
 

2305
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:45,470
they're super smart people and he pays
certain amount of money so I took back

2306
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:45,480
certain amount of money so I took back
 

2307
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,750
certain amount of money so I took back
the highest like GM Cruise and uber and

2308
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:47,760
the highest like GM Cruise and uber and
 

2309
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,210
the highest like GM Cruise and uber and
and others and did the math and said hey

2310
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:50,220
and others and did the math and said hey
 

2311
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:52,910
and others and did the math and said hey
how many people are there and how much

2312
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:52,920
how many people are there and how much
 

2313
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,700
how many people are there and how much
money was paid and as a lower bound is

2314
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:55,710
money was paid and as a lower bound is
 

2315
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:58,100
money was paid and as a lower bound is
tomato value of an self-driving car

2316
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:58,110
tomato value of an self-driving car
 

2317
00:44:58,110 --> 00:45:00,710

engineer in these acquisitions to be at

2318
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:00,720
engineer in these acquisitions to be at
 

2319
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,960
engineer in these acquisitions to be at
least 10 million dollars right so think

2320
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:02,970
least 10 million dollars right so think
 

2321
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:04,820
least 10 million dollars right so think
about this you you get just have a skill

2322
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:04,830
about this you you get just have a skill
 

2323
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:06,770
about this you you get just have a skill
and you team up and build a company and

2324
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:06,780
and you team up and build a company and
 

2325
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:09,500
and you team up and build a company and
you're worth now is 10 million dollars I

2326
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:09,510
you're worth now is 10 million dollars I
 

2327
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:11,780
you're worth now is 10 million dollars I
mean it's kind of cool I mean but what

2328
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:11,790
mean it's kind of cool I mean but what
 

2329
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:13,700
mean it's kind of cool I mean but what
other thing could you do in life to be

2330
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:13,710
other thing could you do in life to be
 

2331
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:15,110
other thing could you do in life to be
worth 10 million dollars within a year

2332
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:15,120
worth 10 million dollars within a year
 

2333
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:19,250
worth 10 million dollars within a year
yeah amazing but to come back for a

2334
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:19,260
yeah amazing but to come back for a
 

2335
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,560
yeah amazing but to come back for a
moment on to deep learning and its

2336
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:21,570
moment on to deep learning and its
 

2337
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:24,710
moment on to deep learning and its
application in autonomous vehicles you

2338
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:24,720
application in autonomous vehicles you
 

2339
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,960
application in autonomous vehicles you
know what are your thoughts on Elon

2340
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:26,970
know what are your thoughts on Elon
 

2341
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:29,450

do you see machine learning as

do you see machine learning as

2461
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:45,500

clear about what machine learning is and
 

2463
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:46,910
clear about what machine learning is and
is not and I think there's a lot of

2464
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:46,920
is not and I think there's a lot of
 

2465

we proved that now not this thing was
great in this one thing I'm finding skin

2504
00:48:46,910 --> 00:48:46,920
great in this one thing I'm finding skin
 

2505
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:50,210
great in this one thing I'm finding skin
cancer but it couldn't drive a car so so

2506
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:50,220
cancer but it couldn't drive a car so so
 

2507
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:51,680
cancer but it couldn't drive a car so so
the difference to human intelligence as

2508
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:51,690
the difference to human intelligence as
 

2509
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:54,350
the difference to human intelligence as
we do all these many many things and we

2510
00:48:54,350 --> 00:48:54,360
we do all these many many things and we
 

2511
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:56,359
we do all these many many things and we
can often learn from a very small data

2512
00:48:56,359 --> 00:48:56,369
can often learn from a very small data
 

2513
00:48:56,369 --> 00:48:59,240
can often learn from a very small data
set of experiences but as machines still

2514
00:48:59,240 --> 00:48:59,250
set of experiences but as machines still
 

2515
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:01,430
set of experiences but as machines still
need very large data sets and things

2516
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:01,440
need very large data sets and things
 

2517
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,650
need very large data sets and things
should be very repetitive no that's

2518
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:03,660
should be very repetitive no that's
 

2519
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:05,210
should be very repetitive no that's
still super impactful because almost

2520
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:05,220
still super impactful because almost
 

2521
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:07,640
still super impactful because almost
everything we do is repetitive so that's

2522
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:07,650
everything we do is repetitive so that's
 

2523
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:10,250
everything we do is repetitive so that's
gonna we transform human labor but it's

2524
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:10,260
gonna we transform human labor but it's
 

2525
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:13,100
gonna we transform human labor but it's
not this almighty general intelligence

2526
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:13,110
not this almighty general intelligence
 

2527
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:15,380
not this almighty general intelligence
we're really far away from a system that

2528
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:15,390
we're really far away from a system that
 

2529
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:18,859
we're really far away from a system that
will exhibit general intelligence to

2530
00:49:18,859 --> 00:49:18,869
will exhibit general intelligence to
 

2531
00:49:18,869 --> 00:49:20,540
will exhibit general intelligence to
that end I actually commiserate the

2532
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:20,550
that end I actually commiserate the
 

2533
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:22,160
that end I actually commiserate the
naming a little bit because artificial

2534
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:22,170
naming a little bit because artificial
 

2535
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:24,310

immediately mixed into the idea of human
 

2539
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:29,600
immediately mixed into the idea of human

I don't think that we don't see this in

2542
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:31,470
I don't think that we don't see this in
 

2543
00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:33,830
I don't think that we don't see this in
my lifetime I don't think human

my lifetime I don't think human
 

2545
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:36,859
my lifetime I don't think human
suppression is a good idea I don't see

suppression is a good idea I don't see
 

2547
00:49:36,869 --> 00:49:38,570
suppression is a good idea I don't see
it coming I don't see the technology

2548
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:38,580
it coming I don't see the technology
 

2549
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:41,510
it coming I don't see the technology
being there what I see instead is a very

super impactful let's take the impact of
artificial terrorism on human work we

2562
00:49:57,770 --> 00:49:57,780
artificial terrorism on human work we
 

2563
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:59,750
artificial terrorism on human work we
all know that it takes something like

2564
00:49:59,750 --> 00:49:59,760
all know that it takes something like
 

2565
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,599
all know that it takes something like
10,000 hours to become an expert if

2566
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:02,609
10,000 hours to become an expert if
 

2567
00:50:02,609 --> 00:50:04,160
10,000 hours to become an expert if
you're gonna be a doctor or lawyer or

2568
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:04,170
you're gonna be a doctor or lawyer or
 

2569
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:06,830
you're gonna be a doctor or lawyer or
even a really good driver it takes a

even a really good driver it takes a
 

2571
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,980
even a really good driver it takes a
certain amount of time to become experts

easily if we catch them early and and

easily if we catch them early and and
the reason why we don't tend to catch

why when you look at say transportation

3644
01:11:49,090 --> 01:11:49,100
why when you look at say transportation
 

3645
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:52,840
why when you look at say transportation
you could have observed that up to the

01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:52,850
you could have observed that up to the
 

3647
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:54,600
you could have observed that up to the
end of the 19th century

end of the 19th century
 

3649
01:11:54,610 --> 01:11:57,660
end of the 19th century
so transportation used any number of

01:11:57,660 --> 01:11:57,670
so transportation used any number of
 

3651
01:11:57,670 --> 01:12:00,150
so transportation used any number of
legs from one leg to two legs to a

legs from one leg to two legs to a
 

3653
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:02,280
legs from one leg to two legs to a
thousand legs and you could have

01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:02,290
thousand legs and you could have
 

3655
01:12:02,290 --> 01:12:04,350
thousand legs and you could have
concluded that is the right way to move

01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:10,330
in fact there are many people in
 

3663
01:12:10,330 --> 01:12:12,570
in fact there are many people in
aviation that flap wings to the arms and

survive then then the interesting thing

3668
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:18,430
survive then then the interesting thing
 

3669
01:12:18,430 --> 01:12:19,980
survive then then the interesting thing
is that the technology solutions are

3670
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:19,990
is that the technology solutions are
 

3671
01:12:19,990 --> 01:12:22,770
is that the technology solutions are
very different like in technologies

really easily by the wheel in biology is
 

3675
01:12:24,730 --> 01:12:26,390
really easily by the wheel in biology is
super hard ability there's very few

engineering we can build wheels and

3682
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:36,910
engineering we can build wheels and
 

3683
01:12:36,910 --> 01:12:41,730
engineering we can build wheels and
those wheels gave rise to cars similar

3684
01:12:41,730 --> 01:12:41,740
those wheels gave rise to cars similar
 

3685

jet engine or helicopter blades so the

3692
01:12:52,710 --> 01:12:52,720
jet engine or helicopter blades so the
 

3693
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:54,930
jet engine or helicopter blades so the
solutions have used very different

3694
01:12:54,930 --> 01:12:54,940
solutions have used very different
 

3695
01:12:54,940 --> 01:12:57,200
solutions have used very different
physical laws in nature and that's great

3696
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:57,210
physical laws in nature and that's great
 

3697
01:12:57,210 --> 01:13:00,150
physical laws in nature and that's great
so for me to be too much focused on oh
