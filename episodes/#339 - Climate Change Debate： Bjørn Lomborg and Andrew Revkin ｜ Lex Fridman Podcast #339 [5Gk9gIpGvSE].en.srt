to the center and are on different sides
 

143
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,970
to the center and are on different sides
of that Center if it's possible to

144
00:02:58,970 --> 00:02:58,980
of that Center if it's possible to
 

145
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,650
of that Center if it's possible to
define the central like there is a

146
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:00,660
define the central like there is a
 

147
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,630
define the central like there is a
political Center for Center left and

148

political Center for Center left and
 

149

of course it's very difficult to Define
 

153
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,130
of course it's very difficult to Define

159
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:13,970
over the years what they are today and
where's the center oh boy uh well in a

160
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:13,980
where's the center oh boy uh well in a
 

161
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,649
where's the center oh boy uh well in a
way on this issue I think there is no

with the climate system
 

181
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,210
with the climate system
and we're rethinking our Energy Systems

and we're rethinking our Energy Systems
 

183
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,509
and we're rethinking our Energy Systems
and those are very

you know the 70s and 80s pollution was

304
00:05:51,469 --> 00:05:51,479
you know the 70s and 80s pollution was
 

305
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:52,909
you know the 70s and 80s pollution was
changing things that were making things

00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,090
um was that we're building vulnerability
to climate hazards at the same time so

328
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:14,100
to climate hazards at the same time so
 

329
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,850
to climate hazards at the same time so
climate is changing but we're changing

330
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:16,860
climate is changing but we're changing
 

331
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,670

365
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:00,770
it feels oh my God that's more complex
right but it also gives you more action

00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:09,900
work with that and then let's chart an
 

375
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,629
work with that and then let's chart an

so the story became so different it

378
00:07:13,309 --> 00:07:13,319
so the story became so different it
 

379
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:15,050
so the story became so different it
didn't become like

383
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,689
you know a story you could package into
a magazine article or the like and it

384
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:20,699
a magazine article or the like and it
 

385
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:22,070
a magazine article or the like and it
just led me to a whole different way of

386
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,080
just led me to a whole different way of
 

387
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,350
just led me to a whole different way of
even my journalism changed over time

even my journalism changed over time
 

389
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,170
even my journalism changed over time
so I don't fight the belief disbelief

390
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:27,180
so I don't fight the belief disbelief
 

391
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,570
so I don't fight the belief disbelief
fight anymore I think it's actually

392
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:29,580
fight anymore I think it's actually
 

393
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,370
fight anymore I think it's actually
kind of a waste I don't it's a good way

394
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:31,380
kind of a waste I don't it's a good way
 

395
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,230
kind of a waste I don't it's a good way
to start the discussion because that's

00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:33,240
to start the discussion because that's
 

397
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,089
to start the discussion because that's
where we're at

398

where we're at
 

399
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:37,550
where we're at
but this isn't about to me going forward

400

tipping that balance back toward the
 

405
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,689
tipping that balance back toward the
center so much as finding opportunities

406
00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:44,699
center so much as finding opportunities
 

407
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:46,730

to just do something about this stuff

408
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:46,740
to just do something about this stuff
 

409
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,290

what do you think Bjorn do you agree

410
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:48,300
what do you think Bjorn do you agree
 

411
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,749
what do you think Bjorn do you agree
that it's multiple questions in one in

412
00:07:50,749 --> 00:07:50,759
that it's multiple questions in one in
 

413
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:51,950
that it's multiple questions in one in
one big question do you think it's

414
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:51,960
one big question do you think it's
 

415
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,809
one big question do you think it's
possible to define the center where is

416
00:07:53,809 --> 00:07:53,819
possible to define the center where is
 

417
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:56,089
possible to define the center where is
the center I think it's wonderful to

418
00:07:56,089 --> 00:07:56,099
the center I think it's wonderful to
 

419
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:58,850

hear Andy sort of unconstruct the whole

420
00:07:58,850 --> 00:07:58,860
hear Andy sort of unconstruct the whole
 

421
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,409
hear Andy sort of unconstruct the whole
conversation and say we should be

422
00:08:00,409 --> 00:08:00,419
conversation and say we should be
 

423
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:02,089
conversation and say we should be
worried about different things and I

424
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:02,099
worried about different things and I
 

425
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:03,890
worried about different things and I
think that's exactly or we should be

426
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:03,900
think that's exactly or we should be
 

427
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,330
think that's exactly or we should be
worried about things in a different way

428
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:05,340
worried about things in a different way
 

429
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,210
worried about things in a different way
that makes it much more uh useful

430
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:08,220
that makes it much more uh useful
 

431
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,430
that makes it much more uh useful
I think that's exactly the right way to

432
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:10,440
I think that's exactly the right way to
 

433
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,170
I think that's exactly the right way to
to think about it on the other hand that

434
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:12,180
to think about it on the other hand that
 

435
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,510
to think about it on the other hand that
was also where you kind of ended we are

436
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:14,520
was also where you kind of ended we are
 

437
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,850
was also where you kind of ended we are
stuck in a place where this very much is

438
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:16,860
stuck in a place where this very much is
 

439
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,369
stuck in a place where this very much is
the conversation right now uh and and so

440
00:08:19,369 --> 00:08:19,379
the conversation right now uh and and so
 

441
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:21,409
the conversation right now uh and and so
I think in in one sense

442
00:08:21,409 --> 00:08:21,419
I think in in one sense
 

443
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:23,689
I think in in one sense
um certainly the people who used to say

444
00:08:23,689 --> 00:08:23,699
um certainly the people who used to say
 

445
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:25,850
um certainly the people who used to say
oh this is not happening they're very

446
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:25,860
oh this is not happening they're very
 

447
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,529
oh this is not happening they're very
very small and diminishing crowd and

448
00:08:27,529 --> 00:08:27,539
very small and diminishing crowd and
 

449
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:29,510
very small and diminishing crowd and
certainly not right

450
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:29,520
certainly not right
 

451
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,969
certainly not right
um but on the other hand I I think to an

452
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:31,979
um but on the other hand I I think to an
 

453
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:33,010
um but on the other hand I I think to an
ex

454
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:33,020
ex
 

455
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,870

increasing extent we've gotten into a

456
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:35,880
increasing extent we've gotten into a
 

457
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,029
increasing extent we've gotten into a
world where a lot of people really think

458
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:38,039
world where a lot of people really think
 

459
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,709
world where a lot of people really think
this is the you know the end of the

460
00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:39,719
this is the you know the end of the
 

461
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,550
this is the you know the end of the
times uh if if you so the OCD did a new

462
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:43,560
times uh if if you so the OCD did a new
 

463
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,829
times uh if if you so the OCD did a new
survey of all oecd countries and it's

464
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:45,839
survey of all oecd countries and it's
 

465
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,070
survey of all oecd countries and it's
shocking so it shows that 60 of all

466
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:49,080
shocking so it shows that 60 of all
 

467
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,370
shocking so it shows that 60 of all
people in the OCD so the rich World

468
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:51,380
people in the OCD so the rich World
 

469
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,870
people in the OCD so the rich World
believes that global warming will likely

believes that global warming will likely
 

471
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,449
believes that global warming will likely
or very likely lead to the extinction of

and and and that's that's scary in a
 

477
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,710
and and and that's that's scary in a
very very clear way because look if this

478
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:03,720
very very clear way because look if this
 

479
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,870
very very clear way because look if this
really is true if if global warming is

480
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:05,880
really is true if if global warming is
 

481
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,810
really is true if if global warming is
this meter hurtling towards Earth and

this meter hurtling towards Earth and
 

483
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,670
this meter hurtling towards Earth and
you know we're gonna be destroyed in 12

you know we're gonna be destroyed in 12
 

485
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,370
you know we're gonna be destroyed in 12
years or whatever the number is uh uh uh

486
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:13,380
years or whatever the number is uh uh uh
 

487
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,710
years or whatever the number is uh uh uh
uh today then clearly we should care

488
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:15,720
uh today then clearly we should care
 

489
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,509
uh today then clearly we should care
about nothing else we should just be

490
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:17,519
about nothing else we should just be
 

491
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,610
about nothing else we should just be
focusing on making sure that that

492
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:19,620
focusing on making sure that that
 

493
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,410
focusing on making sure that that
asteroid get you know we should send up

494
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:21,420
asteroid get you know we should send up
 

495
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,810
asteroid get you know we should send up
Bruce Willis and get get this done with

496
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:23,820
Bruce Willis and get get this done with
 

497
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,110
Bruce Willis and get get this done with
but that's not the way it is this is not

498
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:27,120
but that's not the way it is this is not
 

499
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,850
but that's not the way it is this is not
actually what the U.N climate panel

500
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:28,860
actually what the U.N climate panel
 

501
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,670
actually what the U.N climate panel
tells us or anything else so I think uh

502
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:31,680
tells us or anything else so I think uh
 

503
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,650
tells us or anything else so I think uh
it's not so much about arcing against

504
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:33,660
it's not so much about arcing against
 

505
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,329
it's not so much about arcing against
the people who are saying it's a it's a

506
00:09:35,329 --> 00:09:35,339
the people who are saying it's a it's a
 

507
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:37,070
the people who are saying it's a it's a
hoax that's not really where I am I

508
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:37,080
hoax that's not really where I am I
 

509
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,509
hoax that's not really where I am I
don't think that's where Andy are really

510
00:09:38,509 --> 00:09:38,519
don't think that's where Andy are really
 

511
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:41,150
don't think that's where Andy are really
where the conversation is but it is a

512
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:41,160
where the conversation is but it is a
 

513
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,710
where the conversation is but it is a
question of sort of pulling people back

514
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:42,720
question of sort of pulling people back
 

515
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,110
question of sort of pulling people back
from this end of the world conversation

516
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:45,120
from this end of the world conversation
 

517
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,750
from this end of the world conversation
because it really skews our way that we

518
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:47,760
because it really skews our way that we
 

519
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,910
because it really skews our way that we
think about problems also you know if

520
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:49,920
think about problems also you know if
 

521
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,290
think about problems also you know if
you really think this is the end of time

522
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:51,300
you really think this is the end of time
 

523
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,750
you really think this is the end of time
and you know you only have 12 years

524
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:52,760
and you know you only have 12 years
 

525
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,090
and you know you only have 12 years
nothing that can only work in 13 years

526
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:56,100
nothing that can only work in 13 years
 

527
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,269
nothing that can only work in 13 years
can be considered and the reality of

528
00:09:59,269 --> 00:09:59,279
can be considered and the reality of
 

529
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,829
can be considered and the reality of
most of what we're talking about in

530
00:10:00,829 --> 00:10:00,839
most of what we're talking about in
 

531
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:02,329
most of what we're talking about in
climate and certainly our vulnerability

532
00:10:02,329 --> 00:10:02,339
climate and certainly our vulnerability
 

533
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:04,850
climate and certainly our vulnerability
certainly our Energy System is going to

534
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:04,860
certainly our Energy System is going to
 

535
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,430
certainly our Energy System is going to
be half to a full century and so when

536
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:07,440
be half to a full century and so when
 

537
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,769
be half to a full century and so when
you talk to people in say well but we're

538
00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:09,779
you talk to people in say well but we're
 

539
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:11,329
you talk to people in say well but we're
gonna you know we're really gonna go a

540
00:10:11,329 --> 00:10:11,339
gonna you know we're really gonna go a
 

541
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:12,650
gonna you know we're really gonna go a
lot more renewable in the next half

542
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:12,660
lot more renewable in the next half
 

543
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,630
lot more renewable in the next half
century they look at you and like but

544
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:14,640
century they look at you and like but
 

545
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,750
century they look at you and like but
that's what 38 years too late uh and I

546
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:17,760
that's what 38 years too late uh and I
 

547
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,630
that's what 38 years too late uh and I
get that but so so I think in in your

548
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:20,640
get that but so so I think in in your
 

549
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,610
get that but so so I think in in your
question what I'm trying to do and I

550
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:22,620
question what I'm trying to do and I
 

551
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,110
question what I'm trying to do and I
would imagine that's true for you as

552
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:24,120
would imagine that's true for you as
 

553
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,329
would imagine that's true for you as
well is to try to pull people away from

554
00:10:26,329 --> 00:10:26,339
well is to try to pull people away from
 

555
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:28,730
well is to try to pull people away from
this precipice and this end of the world

556
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:28,740
this precipice and this end of the world
 

557
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,730
this precipice and this end of the world
and then open it up and I think Andy did

558
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:31,740
and then open it up and I think Andy did
 

559
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,769
and then open it up and I think Andy did
that really well by saying look there's

560
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:33,779
that really well by saying look there's
 

561
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:36,410
that really well by saying look there's
so many different sub conversations and

562
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:36,420
so many different sub conversations and
 

563
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,630
so many different sub conversations and
we need to have all of them and we need

564
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:38,640
we need to have all of them and we need
 

565
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,630
we need to have all of them and we need
to be respectful of of some of these are

566
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:41,640
to be respectful of of some of these are
 

567
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,370
to be respectful of of some of these are
right in the in the sort of standard

568
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:43,380
right in the in the sort of standard
 

569
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,350
right in the in the sort of standard
media kind of way but some of them are

570
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:45,360
media kind of way but some of them are
 

571
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,569
media kind of way but some of them are
very very wrong and actually means that

very very wrong and actually means that
 

573
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:50,389
very very wrong and actually means that

we end up doing much less good both on
 

575

and and this is you know if you hear the

744
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:03,720
and and this is you know if you hear the
 

745
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,329
and and this is you know if you hear the
story from the media of 20 years of

course that's what you'll believe and it
 

749
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,530
course that's what you'll believe and it
also happens to be true all right that

also happens to be true all right that
 

751
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,389
also happens to be true all right that
is what the sign I I think you know it's

752
00:14:11,389 --> 00:14:11,399
is what the sign I I think you know it's
 

753
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:13,129
is what the sign I I think you know it's
perhaps worth saying and it's a little

754
00:14:13,129 --> 00:14:13,139
perhaps worth saying and it's a little
 

755
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:14,629
perhaps worth saying and it's a little
depressing that you always have to say

756
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:14,639
depressing that you always have to say
 

757
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,790
depressing that you always have to say
it but I think it's worth saying that I

758
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:16,800
it but I think it's worth saying that I
 

759
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,490
it but I think it's worth saying that I
think we both really do accept you know

00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,190
think we both really do accept you know

00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,810
the climate panel uh science and you
know there's absolutely global warming

764

know there's absolutely global warming
 

765
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,269
know there's absolutely global warming
it is an issue uh and it's probably just

00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:26,279
it is an issue uh and it's probably just
 

767
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:28,069
it is an issue uh and it's probably just
worthwhile to get it out of the way it's

768
00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:28,079
worthwhile to get it out of the way it's
 

769
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,710
worthwhile to get it out of the way it's
an issue and it's caused by humans it's

770
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:30,720
an issue and it's caused by humans it's
 

771
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,329
an issue and it's caused by humans it's
caused by humans yeah okay but

772
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:32,339

00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:08,630
you know if you look at uh the hurricane
em that went through Florida you have a

em that went through Florida you have a
 

897
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,250
em that went through Florida you have a
situation where Florida went from what

898

situation where Florida went from what
 

899
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:16,789

901
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,370
600 000 houses in 1940 to 17 million
houses yeah sorry 10 million houses so

902
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:19,380
houses yeah sorry 10 million houses so
 

903
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,909
houses yeah sorry 10 million houses so
uh so 17 times more over uh what a

904
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:22,919
uh so 17 times more over uh what a
 

905
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:25,130
uh so 17 times more over uh what a
period of 80 years of course you're

906
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:25,140
period of 80 years of course you're
 

907
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,049
period of 80 years of course you're
gonna have one yeah yeah you're going to

908
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:27,059
gonna have one yeah yeah you're going to
 

909
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:29,570
gonna have one yeah yeah you're going to
have lots more damage and many of these

910
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:29,580
have lots more damage and many of these
 

911
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,610
have lots more damage and many of these
houses now been built on you know places

912
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:31,620
houses now been built on you know places
 

913
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,990
houses now been built on you know places
where you probably shouldn't be building

914
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:33,000
where you probably shouldn't be building
 

915
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,930
where you probably shouldn't be building
and and so I think uh a lot of

916
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:35,940
and and so I think uh a lot of
 

917
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,789
and and so I think uh a lot of
scientists are very focused on saying

918
00:17:37,789 --> 00:17:37,799
scientists are very focused on saying
 

919
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:40,430
scientists are very focused on saying
can we measure whether global warming

920
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:40,440
can we measure whether global warming
 

921
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,470
can we measure whether global warming
had an impact which is an interesting

922
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:42,480
had an impact which is an interesting
 

923
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,470
had an impact which is an interesting
science question I think it's it's very

924
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:45,480
science question I think it's it's very
 

925
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,510
science question I think it's it's very
implausible that eventually we won't be

926
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:47,520
implausible that eventually we won't be
 

927
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,610
implausible that eventually we won't be
able to say it has an impact but the

928
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:49,620
able to say it has an impact but the
 

929
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,950
able to say it has an impact but the
real question it seems to me is if we

930
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:51,960
real question it seems to me is if we
 

931
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,330
real question it seems to me is if we
actually want to make sure that people

932
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:53,340
actually want to make sure that people
 

933
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,610
actually want to make sure that people
are less harmed in the future

934
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:55,620
are less harmed in the future
 

935
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,950
are less harmed in the future
what are the levers that we can control

936
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:57,960
what are the levers that we can control
 

937
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,190
what are the levers that we can control
and it turns out that the CO2 lever uh

938
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:01,200
and it turns out that the CO2 lever uh
 

939
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,810
and it turns out that the CO2 lever uh
doing something about climate is an

doing something about climate is an

alley Alleyway yeah it's it's just
simple stuff and and because we're so

962
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:26,640
simple stuff and and because we're so
 

963
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,930
simple stuff and and because we're so
focused on this one issue we sort of it

964
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:29,940
focused on this one issue we sort of it
 

965
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,510
focused on this one issue we sort of it
it almost feels uh sacrilegious to to

966
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:32,520
it almost feels uh sacrilegious to to
 

967
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,669
it almost feels uh sacrilegious to to
talk about these other things that are

968
00:18:34,669 --> 00:18:34,679
talk about these other things that are
 

969
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:36,710
talk about these other things that are
much more in our power and that we can

970
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:36,720
much more in our power and that we can
 

971
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,570
much more in our power and that we can
do something about much quicker and that

972
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:38,580
do something about much quicker and that
 

973
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,370
do something about much quicker and that
would help a lot more people so I I

974
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:40,380
would help a lot more people so I I
 

975
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,230
would help a lot more people so I I
think this is uh this is going to be a

976
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:42,240
think this is uh this is going to be a
 

977
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,210
think this is uh this is going to be a
large part of the whole conversation you

978
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:44,220
large part of the whole conversation you
 

979
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,250
large part of the whole conversation you
know yes climate is a problem but it's

980
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:46,260
know yes climate is a problem but it's
 

981
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,810
know yes climate is a problem but it's
not the only problem and there are many

982
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:47,820
not the only problem and there are many
 

983
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,549
not the only problem and there are many
other things where we can actually have

984
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:49,559
other things where we can actually have
 

985
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:51,650
other things where we can actually have
a much much bigger impact at much lower

986
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:51,660
a much much bigger impact at much lower
 

987
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,750
a much much bigger impact at much lower
cost maybe we should also remember those

988
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:53,760
cost maybe we should also remember those
 

989
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,070
cost maybe we should also remember those
can you

990
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:55,080

1007
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,010
uh
is is not the correct way to look at

is is not the correct way to look at
 

1009
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:22,130
is is not the correct way to look at
climate change just the emissions but

1010
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:22,140
climate change just the emissions but
 

1011

1025
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:45,289
commit communication of like holy [\h__\h]
we should be thinking about this so I I

1026
00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:45,299
we should be thinking about this so I I
 

1027
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:47,150
we should be thinking about this so I I
think you know I I totally understand

1028
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:47,160
think you know I I totally understand
 

1029

why credit tunberg is doing what she's

1030

why credit tunberg is doing what she's
 

1031
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,049
why credit tunberg is doing what she's
doing I I have great respect for her

1032
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:51,059
doing I I have great respect for her
 

1033
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:53,750
doing I I have great respect for her
because if you know I I look at a lot of

1034
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:53,760
because if you know I I look at a lot of
 

1035
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,669
because if you know I I look at a lot of
kids growing up and they're basically

1036
00:19:55,669 --> 00:19:55,679
kids growing up and they're basically
 

1037
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,650
kids growing up and they're basically
being told you're not going to reach

1038
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:57,660
being told you're not going to reach
 

1039
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,450
being told you're not going to reach
adulthood or at least not you're not

1040
00:19:59,450 --> 00:19:59,460
adulthood or at least not you're not
 

1041
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,909
adulthood or at least not you're not
going to get very far into adulthood uh

1042
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:01,919
going to get very far into adulthood uh
 

1043
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,310
going to get very far into adulthood uh
and that of course you know this is the

1044
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:04,320
and that of course you know this is the
 

1045
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,930
and that of course you know this is the
media are hurtling towards Earth and

1046
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:05,940
media are hurtling towards Earth and
 

1047
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,789
media are hurtling towards Earth and
then this is the only thing we should be

1048
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:07,799
then this is the only thing we should be
 

1049
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:09,890
then this is the only thing we should be
focusing on I understand why she's

1050
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:09,900
focusing on I understand why she's
 

1051
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,590
focusing on I understand why she's
making that argument I I think it's at

1052
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:12,600
making that argument I I think it's at
 

1053
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,510
making that argument I I think it's at
the end of the day it's incorrect and

1054
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:14,520
the end of the day it's incorrect and
 

1055
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,310
the end of the day it's incorrect and
I'm sure we'll get around to talking

1056
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:16,320
I'm sure we'll get around to talking
 

1057
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,230
I'm sure we'll get around to talking
about that and one of the things is of

1058
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:18,240
about that and one of the things is of
 

1059
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,470
about that and one of the things is of
course that her whole generation uh you

1060
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:21,480
course that her whole generation uh you
 

1061
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,029
course that her whole generation uh you
know I can understand why they're saying

1062
00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:23,039
know I can understand why they're saying
 

1063
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,710
know I can understand why they're saying
you know if if we're going to be dead in

1064
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:24,720
you know if if we're going to be dead in
 

1065
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,450
you know if if we're going to be dead in
12 years why would I want to study that

1066
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:26,460
12 years why would I want to study that
 

1067
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,010
12 years why would I want to study that
you know why would I really care about

1068
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:28,020
you know why would I really care about
 

1069
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,070
you know why would I really care about
anything so so I totally want to sort of

1070
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:31,080
anything so so I totally want to sort of
 

1071
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,990
anything so so I totally want to sort of
pull Greta and many others out of this

1072
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:33,000
pull Greta and many others out of this
 

1073
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,930
pull Greta and many others out of this
uh end of the world fear but I totally

1074
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:35,940
uh end of the world fear but I totally
 

1075
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,669
uh end of the world fear but I totally
get why she's doing it I think she's

1076
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:37,679
get why she's doing it I think she's
 

1077
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,409
get why she's doing it I think she's
done on a service in the sense that

1078
00:20:39,409 --> 00:20:39,419
done on a service in the sense that
 

1079
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:41,029
done on a service in the sense that
she's gotten more people to talk about

1080
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:41,039
she's gotten more people to talk about
 

1081
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,610
she's gotten more people to talk about
climate and that's good because we need

1082
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:43,620
climate and that's good because we need
 

1083
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,130
climate and that's good because we need
to have this discussion I think it's

1084
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:46,140
to have this discussion I think it's
 

1085
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,169
to have this discussion I think it's
unfortunate and this is just what

1086
00:20:48,169 --> 00:20:48,179
unfortunate and this is just what
 

1087
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:50,090
unfortunate and this is just what
happens in almost all policy discussions

1088
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:50,100
happens in almost all policy discussions
 

1089
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,130
happens in almost all policy discussions
that they end up being you know sort of

1090
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:52,140
that they end up being you know sort of
 

1091
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,830
that they end up being you know sort of
discussions from from the extreme groups

1092
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:54,840
discussions from from the extreme groups
 

1093
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,230
discussions from from the extreme groups
because it's just more fun on media uh

1094
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:57,240
because it's just more fun on media uh
 

1095
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,750
because it's just more fun on media uh
to to have sort of the the total deniers

1096
00:20:59,750 --> 00:20:59,760
to to have sort of the the total deniers
 

1097
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,789
to to have sort of the the total deniers
and the and the the people who say we're

1098
00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:01,799
and the and the the people who say we're
 

1099
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:03,230
and the and the the people who say we're
going to die tomorrow and it sort of

1100
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:03,240
going to die tomorrow and it sort of
 

1101
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,970
going to die tomorrow and it sort of
becomes that discussion that's more you

1102
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:04,980
becomes that discussion that's more you
 

1103
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,590
becomes that discussion that's more you
know it's more sort of a mutt wrestling

1104
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:06,600
know it's more sort of a mutt wrestling
 

1105
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,090

00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,950
I think also it very easily ends up sort
of skewing our conversation about what

1268
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:12,960
of skewing our conversation about what
 

1269
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,529
of skewing our conversation about what
are the actual Solutions uh you know

1270
00:24:15,529 --> 00:24:15,539
are the actual Solutions uh you know
 

1271
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:17,870
are the actual Solutions uh you know
because yes it's great to uh to get rid

1272
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:17,880
because yes it's great to uh to get rid
 

1273
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,090
because yes it's great to uh to get rid
of the diesel bus but probably not for

1274
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:20,100
of the diesel bus but probably not for
 

1275
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,470
of the diesel bus but probably not for
the reason people think it's because

1276
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:21,480
the reason people think it's because
 

1277
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,409
the reason people think it's because
diesel buses are really polluting in the

1278
00:24:24,409 --> 00:24:24,419
diesel buses are really polluting in the
 

1279
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:26,090
diesel buses are really polluting in the
you know in the air pollution sense

1280
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:26,100
you know in the air pollution sense
 

1281
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,270
you know in the air pollution sense
right that is why you should get rid of

1282
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:29,280
right that is why you should get rid of
 

1283
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,850
right that is why you should get rid of
them uh and again if you really want it

1284
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:31,860
them uh and again if you really want it
 

1285
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,470
them uh and again if you really want it
to help people for instance with

1286
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:33,480
to help people for instance with
 

1287
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,510
to help people for instance with
hurricanes you should have better you

1288
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:35,520
hurricanes you should have better you
 

1289
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,149
hurricanes you should have better you
know uh rules and Zoning in in Florida

1290
00:24:38,149 --> 00:24:38,159
know uh rules and Zoning in in Florida
 

1291
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,549
know uh rules and Zoning in in Florida
uh which is a very different outcome so

1292
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:40,559
uh which is a very different outcome so
 

1293
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,850
uh which is a very different outcome so
so the the mud wrestling fight also gets

1294
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:43,860
so the the mud wrestling fight also gets
 

1295
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,490
so the the mud wrestling fight also gets
our attention diverted towards solutions

1296
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:46,500
our attention diverted towards solutions
 

1297
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:50,990
our attention diverted towards solutions
that seem uh easy fun you know sort of

1298
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:51,000
that seem uh easy fun you know sort of
 

1299
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,850
that seem uh easy fun you know sort of
the electric car is a great example of

1300
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:52,860
the electric car is a great example of
 

1301
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,649
the electric car is a great example of
this the electric cars somehow become

1302
00:24:54,649 --> 00:24:54,659
this the electric cars somehow become
 

1303
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,770
this the electric cars somehow become
almost the sign that I care and I'm

1304
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:57,780
almost the sign that I care and I'm
 

1305
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,450
almost the sign that I care and I'm
really going to do something about uh

1306
00:24:59,450 --> 00:24:59,460
really going to do something about uh
 

1307
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,909
really going to do something about uh
climate of course electric cars are

1308
00:25:01,909 --> 00:25:01,919
climate of course electric cars are
 

1309
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,649
climate of course electric cars are
great and they're probably part of the

1310
00:25:03,649 --> 00:25:03,659
great and they're probably part of the
 

1311
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:05,210
great and they're probably part of the
solution and they will actually cut

1312
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:05,220
solution and they will actually cut
 

1313
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,450
solution and they will actually cut
carbon emissions somewhat but they are

1314
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:07,460
carbon emissions somewhat but they are
 

1315
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:10,130
carbon emissions somewhat but they are
incredibly ineffective way of cutting

1316
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:10,140
incredibly ineffective way of cutting
 

1317
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,230
incredibly ineffective way of cutting
carbon emissions right now uh they're

1318
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:12,240
carbon emissions right now uh they're
 

1319
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,090
carbon emissions right now uh they're
fairly expensive you have to subsidize

1320
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:14,100
fairly expensive you have to subsidize
 

1321
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,250
fairly expensive you have to subsidize
them a lot and they still emit quite a

1322
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:16,260
them a lot and they still emit quite a
 

1323
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,169
them a lot and they still emit quite a
bit of CO2 both because the batteries

1324
00:25:18,169 --> 00:25:18,179
bit of CO2 both because the batteries
 

1325
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:20,270
bit of CO2 both because the batteries
get produced and because they you know

1326
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:20,280
get produced and because they you know
 

1327
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,770
get produced and because they you know
usually run off of Power that's not

1328
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:21,780
usually run off of Power that's not

okay let's go there let's go electric

1332
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:25,200
okay let's go there let's go electric
 

1333
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,269
okay let's go there let's go electric
cars okay educate us on uh the pros and

1334
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:29,279
cars okay educate us on uh the pros and
 

1335
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,370
cars okay educate us on uh the pros and
cons of electric cars in this complex

picture of of climate change what do you

1338
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:33,960
picture of of climate change what do you
 

1339
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,690
picture of of climate change what do you
think of the efforts of Tesla in Elon

1340
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:35,700
think of the efforts of Tesla in Elon
 

1341
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,630
think of the efforts of Tesla in Elon
Musk on pushing forward

00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:38,640
Musk on pushing forward
 

1343
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,330
Musk on pushing forward
um the electric car Revolution so look

1344
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:41,340
um the electric car Revolution so look
 

1345
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,330
um the electric car Revolution so look
electric cars are great I I don't own a

1346
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:44,340
electric cars are great I I don't own a
 

1347
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,669
electric cars are great I I don't own a
I don't own a car uh but you know I've

1348
00:25:46,669 --> 00:25:46,679
I don't own a car uh but you know I've
 

1349
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:48,289
I don't own a car uh but you know I've
been driving there you go socially

1350
00:25:48,289 --> 00:25:48,299
been driving there you go socially
 

1351
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:51,830
been driving there you go socially
signaling yeah but yeah I've uh we're in

1352
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:51,840
signaling yeah but yeah I've uh we're in
 

1353
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,690
signaling yeah but yeah I've uh we're in
Texas okay flew in here so it's not like

1354
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:53,700
Texas okay flew in here so it's not like
 

1355
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,990
Texas okay flew in here so it's not like
I'm I'm in any way uh virtuous guy on on

1356
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:57,000
I'm I'm in any way uh virtuous guy on on
 

1357
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,570
I'm I'm in any way uh virtuous guy on on
that path but but you know look uh

1358
00:25:59,570 --> 00:25:59,580
that path but but you know look uh
 

1359
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,610
that path but but you know look uh
they're great cars and eventually

1360
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:01,620
they're great cars and eventually
 

1361
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,590
they're great cars and eventually
electric cars will take over a

1362
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:03,600
electric cars will take over a
 

1363
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,710
electric cars will take over a
significant part of our uh driving and

1364
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:06,720
significant part of our uh driving and
 

1365
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,450
significant part of our uh driving and
that's good because they're more

1366
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:08,460
that's good because they're more
 

1367
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,490
that's good because they're more
effective they're more effective they're

1368
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:10,500
effective they're more effective they're
 

1369
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,409
effective they're more effective they're
probably also going to be cheaper uh

1370
00:26:12,409 --> 00:26:12,419
probably also going to be cheaper uh
 

1371
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:14,450
probably also going to be cheaper uh
there's a lot of good opportunities with

1372
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:14,460
there's a lot of good opportunities with
 

1373
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,370
there's a lot of good opportunities with
them but it's because they've become

1374
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:16,380
them but it's because they've become
 

1375
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,430
them but it's because they've become
reified as this thing that you do to fix

1376
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:19,440
reified as this thing that you do to fix
 

1377
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,890
reified as this thing that you do to fix
climate and right now they're not really

1378
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:21,900
climate and right now they're not really
 

1379
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,590
climate and right now they're not really
all that great for climate they uh you

1380
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:24,600
all that great for climate they uh you
 

1381
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,070
all that great for climate they uh you
need a lot of uh uh extra material into

1382
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:28,080
need a lot of uh uh extra material into
 

1383
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,409
need a lot of uh uh extra material into
the batteries which is very polluting

1384
00:26:30,409 --> 00:26:30,419
the batteries which is very polluting
 

1385
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:33,289
the batteries which is very polluting
and it's also uh it emits a lot of CO2 a

1386
00:26:33,289 --> 00:26:33,299
and it's also uh it emits a lot of CO2 a
 

1387
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:35,330
and it's also uh it emits a lot of CO2 a
lot of electric cars are bought as

1388
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:35,340
lot of electric cars are bought as
 

1389
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,909
lot of electric cars are bought as
second cars in the US so we used to

1390
00:26:37,909 --> 00:26:37,919
second cars in the US so we used to
 

1391
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,470
second cars in the US so we used to
think that they were driven almost as

1392
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:39,480
think that they were driven almost as
 

1393
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,049
think that they were driven almost as
much as as a regular car it turns out

1394
00:26:42,049 --> 00:26:42,059
much as as a regular car it turns out
 

1395
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,210
much as as a regular car it turns out
that they're more likely driven less

1396
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:44,220
that they're more likely driven less
 

1397
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,450
that they're more likely driven less
than half as much as a brachial cars so

1398
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:47,460
than half as much as a brachial cars so
 

1399
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,669
than half as much as a brachial cars so
you know 89 of all Americans who have an

1400
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:49,679
you know 89 of all Americans who have an
 

1401
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,789
you know 89 of all Americans who have an
electric car also have a real car that

1402
00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:52,799
electric car also have a real car that
 

1403
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,289
electric car also have a real car that
they use for the long trips and then

1404
00:26:54,289 --> 00:26:54,299
they use for the long trips and then
 

1405
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:57,470
they use for the long trips and then
they use the electric car for sure 89 89

1406
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:57,480
they use the electric car for sure 89 89
 

1407
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,230
they use the electric car for sure 89 89
yeah so so the the point here is that

1408
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:00,240
yeah so so the the point here is that
 

1409
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,269
yeah so so the the point here is that
that it has it's one of these things

1410
00:27:02,269 --> 00:27:02,279
that it has it's one of these things
 

1411
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:04,310
that it has it's one of these things
that become more sort of a virtue

1412
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:04,320
that become more sort of a virtue
 

1413
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,310
that become more sort of a virtue
signaling thing and again look once

1414
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:07,320
signaling thing and again look once
 

1415
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,049
signaling thing and again look once
electric cars are sufficiently cheap

1416
00:27:09,049 --> 00:27:09,059
electric cars are sufficiently cheap
 

1417
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:10,909
electric cars are sufficiently cheap
that people will want to buy them that's

1418
00:27:10,909 --> 00:27:10,919
that people will want to buy them that's
 

1419
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:13,370
that people will want to buy them that's
great and and they will you know do some

1420
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:13,380
great and and they will you know do some
 

1421
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,470
great and and they will you know do some
good for the environment but in reality

1422
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:15,480
good for the environment but in reality
 

1423
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,630
good for the environment but in reality
what we should be focusing on is instead

1424
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:17,640
what we should be focusing on is instead
 

1425
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,810
what we should be focusing on is instead
of getting people electric cars in rich

1426
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:20,820
of getting people electric cars in rich
 

1427
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,070
of getting people electric cars in rich
countries where because we're

1428
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:22,080
countries where because we're
 

1429
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,590
countries where because we're
subsidizing typically uh in in many

1430
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:24,600
subsidizing typically uh in in many
 

1431
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,049
subsidizing typically uh in in many
countries it's uh you actually get uh uh

1432
00:27:27,049 --> 00:27:27,059
countries it's uh you actually get uh uh
 

1433
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:28,789
countries it's uh you actually get uh uh
a sort of sliding scale you get more

1434
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:28,799
a sort of sliding scale you get more
 

1435
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,250
a sort of sliding scale you get more
subsidy the more expensive it is we've

1436
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:31,260
subsidy the more expensive it is we've
 

1437
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,810
subsidy the more expensive it is we've
sort of subsidized this to very rich

1438
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:32,820
sort of subsidized this to very rich
 

1439
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:36,289
sort of subsidized this to very rich
people to buy very large uh Teslas uh to

1440
00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:36,299
people to buy very large uh Teslas uh to
 

1441
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:38,330
people to buy very large uh Teslas uh to
drive around in uh whereas what we

1442
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:38,340
drive around in uh whereas what we
 

1443
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,250
drive around in uh whereas what we
should be focusing on is perhaps getting

1444
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:40,260
should be focusing on is perhaps getting
 

1445
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:43,250
should be focusing on is perhaps getting
uh electric motorcycles and third world

1446
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:43,260
uh electric motorcycles and third world
 

1447
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,890
uh electric motorcycles and third world
developing cities where they would do a

1448
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:45,900
developing cities where they would do a
 

1449
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,750
developing cities where they would do a
lot more good you know they can actually

1450
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:47,760
lot more good you know they can actually
 

1451
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,789
lot more good you know they can actually
go as far as you need there's no you

1452
00:27:49,789 --> 00:27:49,799
go as far as you need there's no you
 

1453
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:51,950
go as far as you need there's no you
know worry about running out of them uh

1454
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:51,960
know worry about running out of them uh
 

1455
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,690
know worry about running out of them uh
and they would obviously they're much

1456
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:53,700
and they would obviously they're much
 

1457
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,669
and they would obviously they're much
much more polluting uh just air

1458
00:27:55,669 --> 00:27:55,679
much more polluting uh just air
 

1459
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,130
much more polluting uh just air
pollution wise and they're much cheaper

1460
00:27:58,130 --> 00:27:58,140
pollution wise and they're much cheaper
 

1461
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,930
pollution wise and they're much cheaper
and they use very little battery so it's

1462
00:27:59,930 --> 00:27:59,940
and they use very little battery so it's
 

1463
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,490
and they use very little battery so it's
a it's about getting our senses right

1464
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:01,500
a it's about getting our senses right
 

1465
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,710
a it's about getting our senses right
but that but the electric car is not is

1466
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:03,720
but that but the electric car is not is
 

1467
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,409
but that but the electric car is not is
not the it's not a conversation about is

1468
00:28:06,409 --> 00:28:06,419
not the it's not a conversation about is
 

1469
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:08,870
not the it's not a conversation about is
it technically a really good or is it a

1470
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:08,880
it technically a really good or is it a
 

1471
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,390
it technically a really good or is it a
somewhat good uh Insight it's more like

1472
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:11,400
somewhat good uh Insight it's more like
 

1473
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,430
somewhat good uh Insight it's more like
it's a virtual signal so just you know

1474
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:13,440
it's a virtual signal so just you know
 

1475
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,470
it's a virtual signal so just you know
I'm an I work with economists I'm

1476
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:15,480
I'm an I work with economists I'm
 

1477
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,149
I'm an I work with economists I'm
actually not an economist but I like to

1478
00:28:17,149 --> 00:28:17,159
actually not an economist but I like to
 

1479
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:19,730
actually not an economist but I like to
say I claim I kind of am uh but but you

1480
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:19,740
say I claim I kind of am uh but but you
 

1481
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,289
say I claim I kind of am uh but but you
know the the fundamental point is we

1482
00:28:21,289 --> 00:28:21,299
know the the fundamental point is we
 

1483
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:23,450
know the the fundamental point is we
would say well how much do you how much

1484
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:23,460
would say well how much do you how much
 

1485
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:26,450
would say well how much do you how much
does it cost to cut a ton of CO2 and the

1486
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:26,460
does it cost to cut a ton of CO2 and the
 

1487
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,730
does it cost to cut a ton of CO2 and the
answer is for most electric cars we're

1488
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:28,740
answer is for most electric cars we're
 

1489
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,190
answer is for most electric cars we're
paying in the order of a thousand two

1490
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:31,200
paying in the order of a thousand two
 

1491
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,890
paying in the order of a thousand two
thousand you know Norway they they pay

1492
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:33,900
thousand you know Norway they they pay
 

1493
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,470
thousand you know Norway they they pay
up to what uh five thousand dollars that

1494
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:36,480
up to what uh five thousand dollars that
 

1495
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,450
up to what uh five thousand dollars that
they're about you know huge amount for

1496
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:38,460
they're about you know huge amount for
 

1497
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:41,149
they're about you know huge amount for
one ton of CO2 uh you can right now cut

1498
00:28:41,149 --> 00:28:41,159
one ton of CO2 uh you can right now cut
 

1499
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:44,210
one ton of CO2 uh you can right now cut
a ton of CO2 for about what is it 14 on

1500
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:44,220
a ton of CO2 for about what is it 14 on
 

1501
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,310
a ton of CO2 for about what is it 14 on
the Reggie or something uh you know you

1502
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:46,320
the Reggie or something uh you know you
 

1503
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,390
the Reggie or something uh you know you
can read this that's the regional

1504
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:47,400
can read this that's the regional
 

1505
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,669
can read this that's the regional
Greenhouse yes initiative so you can

1506
00:28:49,669 --> 00:28:49,679
Greenhouse yes initiative so you can
 

1507
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,409
Greenhouse yes initiative so you can
basically cut it really really cheaply

1508
00:28:51,409 --> 00:28:51,419
basically cut it really really cheaply
 

1509
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:54,169
basically cut it really really cheaply
why would we not want to cut dozens and

1510
00:28:54,169 --> 00:28:54,179
why would we not want to cut dozens and
 

1511
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:56,289
why would we not want to cut dozens and
dozens of tons of CO2 for the same price

1512
00:28:56,289 --> 00:28:56,299
dozens of tons of CO2 for the same price
 

1513
00:28:56,299 --> 00:28:58,970
dozens of tons of CO2 for the same price
instead of just cutting one ton and the

1514
00:28:58,970 --> 00:28:58,980
instead of just cutting one ton and the
 

1515
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,710
instead of just cutting one ton and the
simple answer is we only do that because

1516
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:00,720
simple answer is we only do that because
 

1517
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,390
simple answer is we only do that because
we're so focused on the election from

per gallon performance and you don't
 

1547
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,250
per gallon performance and you don't
have range anxiety because it has a

1548
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:40,260
have range anxiety because it has a
 

1549
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,049

people may may be aware I think you'll
 

1727
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:09,529
people may may be aware I think you'll
be able to fall into the economics Camp

1728
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:09,539
be able to fall into the economics Camp
 

1729
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:12,289
be able to fall into the economics Camp
a bit there's climate scientists right

1730
00:33:12,289 --> 00:33:12,299
a bit there's climate scientists right
 

1731
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:14,450
a bit there's climate scientists right
and there's climate scientists adjacent

1732
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:14,460
and there's climate scientists adjacent
 

1733
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,490
and there's climate scientists adjacent
people like who hang some of my best

1734
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:16,500
people like who hang some of my best
 

1735
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,169
people like who hang some of my best
friends are climate scientists kind of

1736
00:33:18,169 --> 00:33:18,179
friends are climate scientists kind of
 

1737
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:19,970
friends are climate scientists kind of
which is I think where you fall in

1738
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:19,980
which is I think where you fall in
 

1739
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,710
which is I think where you fall in
because you're a journals you've been

1740
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:21,720
because you're a journals you've been
 

1741
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,909
because you're a journals you've been
writing it so you're not completely

1742
00:33:24,909 --> 00:33:24,919
writing it so you're not completely
 

1743
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:28,970
writing it so you're not completely
in the trenches of doing the work you're

1744
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:28,980
in the trenches of doing the work you're
 

1745
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,889
in the trenches of doing the work you're
just up into the trenches every once in

1746
00:33:30,889 --> 00:33:30,899
just up into the trenches every once in
 

1747
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:33,470
just up into the trenches every once in
a while so can you speak to that maybe

1748
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:33,480
a while so can you speak to that maybe
 

1749
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,570
a while so can you speak to that maybe
Bjorn like what's what does the world

1750
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:35,580
Bjorn like what's what does the world
 

1751
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,730
Bjorn like what's what does the world
look like to an economist

1752
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:37,740
look like to an economist
 

1753
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:40,310
look like to an economist
let's try to empathize with these beings

1754
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:40,320
let's try to empathize with these beings
 

1755
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,529
let's try to empathize with these beings
that uh you know unfortunately has

1756
00:33:42,529 --> 00:33:42,539
that uh you know unfortunately has
 

1757
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:44,350
that uh you know unfortunately has
fallen into the

1758
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:44,360
fallen into the
 

1759
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,570
fallen into the
disreputable uh economics yeah so so uh

1760
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:47,580
disreputable uh economics yeah so so uh
 

1761
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:50,090
disreputable uh economics yeah so so uh
I think I think the the main point that

1762
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:50,100
I think I think the the main point that
 

1763
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,529
I think I think the the main point that
that I've been trying for a long time

1764
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:51,539
that I've been trying for a long time
 

1765
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:52,789
that I've been trying for a long time
and I think that's also a little bit

1766
00:33:52,789 --> 00:33:52,799
and I think that's also a little bit
 

1767
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,610
and I think that's also a little bit
what Andy has been talking about for a

1768
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:55,620
what Andy has been talking about for a
 

1769
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,990
what Andy has been talking about for a
very long time the whole conversation

1770
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:57,000
very long time the whole conversation
 

1771
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,909
very long time the whole conversation
was about what does the science tell us

1772
00:33:58,909 --> 00:33:58,919
was about what does the science tell us
 

1773
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:02,210
was about what does the science tell us
is is it global warming real and and to

1774
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:02,220
is is it global warming real and and to
 

1775
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,970
is is it global warming real and and to
me it's much more what can we actually

1776
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:04,980
me it's much more what can we actually
 

1777
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:08,089
me it's much more what can we actually
do what are the policies that we can

1778
00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:08,099
do what are the policies that we can
 

1779
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:10,129
do what are the policies that we can
take and how effective are they going to

1780
00:34:10,129 --> 00:34:10,139
take and how effective are they going to
 

1781
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:11,869
take and how effective are they going to
be so the conversation we just had about

1782
00:34:11,869 --> 00:34:11,879
be so the conversation we just had about
 

1783
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:14,329
be so the conversation we just had about
electric cars is a good example of how

1784
00:34:14,329 --> 00:34:14,339
electric cars is a good example of how
 

1785
00:34:14,339 --> 00:34:16,970
electric cars is a good example of how
an economist think about look you gotta

1786
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:16,980
an economist think about look you gotta
 

1787
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:19,190
an economist think about look you gotta
you this is not a question about whether

1788
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:19,200
you this is not a question about whether
 

1789
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,169
you this is not a question about whether
you feel morally vert true so whether

1790
00:34:21,169 --> 00:34:21,179
you feel morally vert true so whether
 

1791
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:23,030
you feel morally vert true so whether
you know you can sort of display how

1792
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:23,040
you know you can sort of display how
 

1793
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,950
you know you can sort of display how
much you care about the environment this

1794
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:24,960
much you care about the environment this
 

1795
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,129
much you care about the environment this
is about how much you actually ended up

1796
00:34:27,129 --> 00:34:27,139
is about how much you actually ended up
 

1797
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:29,869
is about how much you actually ended up
affecting the world and the honest

1798
00:34:29,869 --> 00:34:29,879
affecting the world and the honest
 

1799
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:31,970
affecting the world and the honest
answers that you know electric cars

1800
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:31,980
answers that you know electric cars
 

1801
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:34,970
answers that you know electric cars
right now in the next decade or so will

1802
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:34,980
right now in the next decade or so will
 

1803
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,530
right now in the next decade or so will
have a fairly small impact and

1804
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:36,540
have a fairly small impact and
 

1805
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,149
have a fairly small impact and
unfortunately right now at a very high

1806
00:34:38,149 --> 00:34:38,159
unfortunately right now at a very high
 

1807
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,950
unfortunately right now at a very high
cost because we're basically subsidizing

1808
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:39,960
cost because we're basically subsidizing
 

1809
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,050
cost because we're basically subsidizing
these things at five or ten thousand

1810
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:42,060
these things at five or ten thousand
 

1811
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,510
these things at five or ten thousand
Dollars around the world uh per per car

1812
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:44,520
Dollars around the world uh per per car
 

1813
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,790
Dollars around the world uh per per car
that that's just not it's not really

1814
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:46,800
that that's just not it's not really
 

1815
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,290
that that's just not it's not really
sustainable but it's certainly not a

1816
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:48,300
sustainable but it's certainly not a
 

1817
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,149
sustainable but it's certainly not a
very great way to cut carbon emissions

1818
00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:50,159
very great way to cut carbon emissions
 

1819
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,490
very great way to cut carbon emissions
so I would be the kind of guy and

1820
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:52,500
so I would be the kind of guy and
 

1821
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,770
so I would be the kind of guy and
Economist would be the types of people

1822
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:54,780
Economist would be the types of people
 

1823
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,990
Economist would be the types of people
who would say is there a smarter way

1824
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:57,000
who would say is there a smarter way
 

1825
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,290
who would say is there a smarter way
where you for less money can for cut

1826
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:00,300
where you for less money can for cut
 

1827
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,530
where you for less money can for cut
more CO2 and the obvious answer is yes

1828
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:03,540
more CO2 and the obvious answer is yes
 

1829
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,690
more CO2 and the obvious answer is yes
that's what we've seen for instance with

1830
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:05,700
that's what we've seen for instance with
 

1831
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,390
that's what we've seen for instance with
uh fracking uh the the fact that the US

1832
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:08,400
uh fracking uh the the fact that the US
 

1833
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,089
uh fracking uh the the fact that the US
went from a lot of coal to a lot of gas

1834
00:35:11,089 --> 00:35:11,099
went from a lot of coal to a lot of gas
 

1835
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:13,010
went from a lot of coal to a lot of gas
because gas became incredibly cheap

1836
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:13,020
because gas became incredibly cheap
 

1837
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,230
because gas became incredibly cheap
because gas emits about half as much as

1838
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:15,240
because gas emits about half as much as
 

1839
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,050
because gas emits about half as much as
as coal does when you use it for elect

1840
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:18,060
as coal does when you use it for elect
 

1841
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:21,470
as coal does when you use it for elect
uh for power that basically cut more

1842
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:21,480
uh for power that basically cut more
 

1843
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,450
uh for power that basically cut more
carbon emissions than pretty much any

1844
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:23,460
carbon emissions than pretty much any
 

1845
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:26,390
carbon emissions than pretty much any
other single thing and we should get the

1846
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:26,400
other single thing and we should get the
 

1847
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,550
other single thing and we should get the
rest of the world in some sense to frac

1848
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:28,560
rest of the world in some sense to frac
 

1849
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,130
rest of the world in some sense to frac
because it's really cheap there are some

1850
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:31,140
because it's really cheap there are some
 

1851
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,630
because it's really cheap there are some
problems and absolutely we can we can

1852
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:32,640
problems and absolutely we can we can
 

1853
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,790
problems and absolutely we can we can
also have that conversation there is no

1854
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:34,800
also have that conversation there is no
 

1855
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,190
also have that conversation there is no
technology is Problem free but

1856
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:37,200
technology is Problem free but
 

1857
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,990
technology is Problem free but
fundamentally it's an incredibly cheap

1858
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:39,000
fundamentally it's an incredibly cheap
 

1859
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,230
fundamentally it's an incredibly cheap
way to get people to cut a lot of CO2

1860
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:42,240
way to get people to cut a lot of CO2
 

1861
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,390
way to get people to cut a lot of CO2
it's not the final solution because it's

1862
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:44,400
it's not the final solution because it's
 

1863
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,069
it's not the final solution because it's
still a fossil fuel but it's a much

1864
00:35:46,069 --> 00:35:46,079
still a fossil fuel but it's a much
 

1865
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,530
still a fossil fuel but it's a much
better fossil fuel if you will and it's

1866
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:48,540
better fossil fuel if you will and it's
 

1867
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,810
better fossil fuel if you will and it's
much more realistic to do that so that's

1868
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:50,820
much more realistic to do that so that's
 

1869
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:53,089
much more realistic to do that so that's
one part of the thing the other one is

1870
00:35:53,089 --> 00:35:53,099
one part of the thing the other one is
 

1871
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:55,250
one part of the thing the other one is
when we talked about for instance uh how

1872
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:55,260
when we talked about for instance uh how
 

1873
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,410
when we talked about for instance uh how
do we help people in Florida who gets

1874
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:57,420
do we help people in Florida who gets
 

1875
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,290
do we help people in Florida who gets
hit by hurricane or how do we help

1876
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:00,300
hit by hurricane or how do we help
 

1877
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,109
hit by hurricane or how do we help
people that get damaged in flash floods

1878
00:36:03,109 --> 00:36:03,119
people that get damaged in flash floods
 

1879
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,089
people that get damaged in flash floods
the people who are in who are in uh in

00:36:05,089 --> 00:36:05,099
the people who are in who are in uh in
 

1881

heat waves and the symbol the simple

1882
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:07,440
heat waves and the symbol the simple
 

1883
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,890
heat waves and the symbol the simple
answer is there's a lot of very very

1884
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:09,900
answer is there's a lot of very very
 

1885
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,750
answer is there's a lot of very very
cheap and effective things that we could

1886
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:11,760
cheap and effective things that we could
 

1887
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,910
cheap and effective things that we could
do first so most climate people will

1888
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:13,920
do first so most climate people will
 

1889
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,089
do first so most climate people will
tend to sort of say we gotta you know uh

1890
00:36:17,089 --> 00:36:17,099
tend to sort of say we gotta you know uh
 

1891
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:19,069
tend to sort of say we gotta you know uh
get rid of all carbon emissions we've

1892
00:36:19,069 --> 00:36:19,079
get rid of all carbon emissions we've
 

1893
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:20,990
get rid of all carbon emissions we've
got to change our entire uh the the

1894
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:21,000
got to change our entire uh the the
 

1895
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,510
got to change our entire uh the the

1896
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:23,520
engine the uh the the sort of powers the
 

1897
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,829
engine the uh the the sort of powers the
world and has powered us for the last

1898
00:36:24,829 --> 00:36:24,839
world and has powered us for the last
 

1899
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:25,910
world and has powered us for the last
200 years

1900
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:25,920
200 years
 

1901
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,710
200 years
and that's all good and well but it's

1902
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:27,720
and that's all good and well but it's
 

1903
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,970
and that's all good and well but it's
really really hard to do and it's

1904
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:28,980
really really hard to do and it's
 

1905
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,829
really really hard to do and it's
probably not going to do very much and

1906
00:36:30,829 --> 00:36:30,839
probably not going to do very much and
 

1907
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:32,569
probably not going to do very much and
even if you succeed it it would only

1908
00:36:32,569 --> 00:36:32,579
even if you succeed it it would only
 

1909
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:34,670
even if you succeed it it would only
help you know future victims of future

1910
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:34,680
help you know future victims of future

00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,690
incredibly vulnerable and where you're
very likely to get hit where we

1922
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:47,700
very likely to get hit where we

actually losing money so we're much more

1928
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:55,020
actually losing money so we're much more
 

1929
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,170
actually losing money so we're much more
about saying it's not a science question

1930
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:57,180
about saying it's not a science question
 

1931
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,210
about saying it's not a science question
I just take the science for granted yes

1932
00:36:59,210 --> 00:36:59,220
I just take the science for granted yes
 

1933
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,470
I just take the science for granted yes
there is a problem with climate change

1934
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:00,480
there is a problem with climate change
 

1935
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,569
there is a problem with climate change
but it's much more about saying how can

1936
00:37:02,569 --> 00:37:02,579
but it's much more about saying how can
 

1937
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:04,250
but it's much more about saying how can
we make smart decisions can I ask you

1938
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:04,260
we make smart decisions can I ask you
 

1939
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:07,370
we make smart decisions can I ask you
about blind spots when you reduce stuff

1940
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:07,380
about blind spots when you reduce stuff
 

1941
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,650
about blind spots when you reduce stuff
to numbers the costs and benefits

1942
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:09,660
to numbers the costs and benefits
 

1943
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,230
to numbers the costs and benefits
is there stuff you might miss

1944
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:12,240
is there stuff you might miss
 

1945
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,750
is there stuff you might miss
about that are important to the

1946
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:14,760
about that are important to the
 

1947
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,450
about that are important to the
flourishing of the human species so

1948
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:17,460
flourishing of the human species so
 

1949
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,430
flourishing of the human species so
everyone will have to say of course

1950
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:19,440
everyone will have to say of course
 

1951
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,829
everyone will have to say of course
there must be blind spots but I don't

1952
00:37:21,829 --> 00:37:21,839
there must be blind spots but I don't
 

1953
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,470
there must be blind spots but I don't
know what they are but yeah I'm I'm sure

1954
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:24,480
know what they are but yeah I'm I'm sure
 

1955
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,630
know what they are but yeah I'm I'm sure
uh Andy and would probably be better at

1956
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:26,640
uh Andy and would probably be better at
 

1957
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,450
uh Andy and would probably be better at
telling me what they are uh so we try to

1958
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:29,460
telling me what they are uh so we try to
 

1959
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,190
telling me what they are uh so we try to
incorporate all of it but obviously

1960
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:31,200
incorporate all of it but obviously
 

1961
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,230
incorporate all of it but obviously
we're not successful we you can't

1962
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:33,240
we're not successful we you can't
 

1963
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,790
we're not successful we you can't
incorporate everything for instance in

1964
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:34,800
incorporate everything for instance in
 

1965
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,130
incorporate everything for instance in
the cost benefit analysis but but the

1966
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:37,140
the cost benefit analysis but but the
 

1967
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,810
the cost benefit analysis but but the
point is in some way

1968
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:38,820
point is in some way
 

1969
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:41,930
point is in some way
um I I would worry a lot about this if

1970
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:41,940
um I I would worry a lot about this if
 

1971
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,849
um I I would worry a lot about this if
we were you know sort of close to

1972
00:37:43,849 --> 00:37:43,859
we were you know sort of close to
 

1973
00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:46,010
we were you know sort of close to
Perfection human race we're doing almost

1974
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:46,020
Perfection human race we're doing almost
 

1975
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,990
Perfection human race we're doing almost
everything right but we're not quite

1976
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:48,000
everything right but we're not quite
 

1977
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,490
everything right but we're not quite
right then we need to get the last

1978
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:49,500
right then we need to get the last
 

1979
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,410
right then we need to get the last
digits right but I think it's much more

1980
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:51,420
digits right but I think it's much more
 

1981
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,690
digits right but I think it's much more
the you know and the the point that I

1982
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:53,700
the you know and the the point that I
 

1983
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,490
the you know and the the point that I
tried to make before that we're all

1984
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:55,500
tried to make before that we're all
 

1985
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,130
tried to make before that we're all
we're all focused on going to an

1986
00:37:58,130 --> 00:37:58,140
we're all focused on going to an
 

1987
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,990
we're all focused on going to an
electric car or you know something else

1988
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:00,000
electric car or you know something else
 

1989
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,270
electric car or you know something else
rather than uh fracking we're all

1990
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:02,280
rather than uh fracking we're all
 

1991
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,310
rather than uh fracking we're all
focused on cutting carbon emissions

1992
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:04,320
focused on cutting carbon emissions
 

1993
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,010
focused on cutting carbon emissions
instead of reducing vulnerability so

1994
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:07,020
instead of reducing vulnerability so
 

1995
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,990
instead of reducing vulnerability so
we're simply getting in orders of

1996
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:09,000
we're simply getting in orders of
 

1997
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,810
we're simply getting in orders of
magnitude wrong uh and and while I'm

1998
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:11,820
magnitude wrong uh and and while I'm
 

1999
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,849
magnitude wrong uh and and while I'm
sure I have blind blind spots I think

2000
00:38:13,849 --> 00:38:13,859
sure I have blind blind spots I think
 

2001
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:15,650
sure I have blind blind spots I think
they're probably not big enough to to

2002
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:15,660
they're probably not big enough to to
 

2003
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,290
they're probably not big enough to to
overturn that point Andy was Bjorn and

2004
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:18,300
overturn that point Andy was Bjorn and
 

2005
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,089
overturn that point Andy was Bjorn and
economists are all wrong about

2006
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:20,099
economists are all wrong about
 

2007
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:23,089
economists are all wrong about
everything well the models we could

2208
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:18,540
flocking Behavior with Scientists so
 

2209
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,390
flocking Behavior with Scientists so
it's almost like a flock of birds within

2594
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:48,240
convenient message uh in many ways and I
 

2595
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,930
convenient message uh in many ways and I
think the the main convenient message in

2596
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:50,940
think the the main convenient message in
 

2597
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:52,849
think the the main convenient message in
climate and it's not surprising if you

2598
00:49:52,849 --> 00:49:52,859
climate and it's not surprising if you
 

2599
00:49:52,859 --> 00:49:54,890
climate and it's not surprising if you
think about it uh you know the main

2600
00:49:54,890 --> 00:49:54,900
think about it uh you know the main
 

2601
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:57,530
think about it uh you know the main
convenient message is that the best way

2602
00:49:57,530 --> 00:49:57,540
convenient message is that the best way
 

2603
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:58,849
convenient message is that the best way
to do something about all the things

2604
00:49:58,849 --> 00:49:58,859
to do something about all the things

00:49:58,859 --> 00:50:02,030
to do something about all the things
that we call climate is to cut CO2

2606
00:50:02,030 --> 00:50:02,040
that we call climate is to cut CO2
 

2607
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,730
that we call climate is to cut CO2
and that turns out to only sometimes be

2608
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:04,740
and that turns out to only sometimes be
 

2609
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:07,550
and that turns out to only sometimes be
true and with with a lot of caveats but

00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:07,560
true and with with a lot of caveats but
 

2611
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:09,109
true and with with a lot of caveats but
that's sort of the message it takes a

00:50:09,109 --> 00:50:09,119
that's sort of the message it takes a
 

2613
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:11,030
that's sort of the message it takes a
long time yes yes it's really really

00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:11,040
long time yes yes it's really really

2637
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,870
they're kind of pounding to table
they're you know they're literally

2638

2645
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:46,670
and and so to me that actually means
it's much more important to make this

00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:46,680
it's much more important to make this

and energy on saying we should cut
carbon emissions this is the way to help

2664
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:05,940
carbon emissions this is the way to help
 

2665
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:08,030
carbon emissions this is the way to help
humankind and and just be clear I think

2666
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:08,040
humankind and and just be clear I think
 

2667
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,710
humankind and and just be clear I think
we should cut carbon emissions as well

2668
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:09,720
we should cut carbon emissions as well
 

2669
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,690
we should cut carbon emissions as well
but we should also just be realistic

2670
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:11,700
but we should also just be realistic
 

2671
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,190
but we should also just be realistic
about what we can achieve with that and

2672
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:13,200
about what we can achieve with that and
 

2673
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,650
about what we can achieve with that and
what are all the other things that we

2674
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:15,660
what are all the other things that we
 

2675
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:18,049
what are all the other things that we
could also do uh and it turns out that a

2676
00:51:18,049 --> 00:51:18,059
could also do uh and it turns out that a
 

2677
00:51:18,059 --> 00:51:19,190
could also do uh and it turns out that a
lot of these other things are much

2678
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:19,200
lot of these other things are much
 

2679
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,809
lot of these other things are much
cheaper much more effective will help

2680
00:51:20,809 --> 00:51:20,819
cheaper much more effective will help
 

2681
00:51:20,819 --> 00:51:23,930
cheaper much more effective will help
much more much quicker and so getting

2682
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:23,940
much more much quicker and so getting
 

2683
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:26,270
much more much quicker and so getting
that point out is just an incredibly

2684
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:26,280
that point out is just an incredibly
 

2685
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,790
that point out is just an incredibly
important for us to get it right so in

2686
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:28,800
important for us to get it right so in
 

2687
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,130
important for us to get it right so in
in some sense you know uh uh to make

2688
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:31,140
in some sense you know uh uh to make
 

2689
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:33,470
in some sense you know uh uh to make
sure that we don't do another Iraq and

2690
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:33,480
sure that we don't do another Iraq and
 

2691
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:36,290
sure that we don't do another Iraq and
we don't do another uh you know lots of

2692
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:36,300
we don't do another uh you know lots of
 

2693
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,569
we don't do another uh you know lots of
stupid decisions uh I mean this this is

2694
00:51:38,569 --> 00:51:38,579

01:02:24,289 --> 01:02:24,299
disagreements that ultimately or so far
 

3249
01:02:24,299 --> 01:02:27,710
disagreements that ultimately or so far
have left led to progress yeah I think I

3250
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:27,720
have left led to progress yeah I think I
 

3251
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:30,109
have left led to progress yeah I think I
think fundamentally the point apart from

3252
01:02:30,109 --> 01:02:30,119
think fundamentally the point apart from
 

3253
01:02:30,119 --> 01:02:32,390
think fundamentally the point apart from
the fact that you know we should just be

3254
01:02:32,390 --> 01:02:32,400
the fact that you know we should just be
 

3255
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:35,089
the fact that you know we should just be
joyful of the fact that humans live here

3256
01:02:35,089 --> 01:02:35,099
joyful of the fact that humans live here
 

3257
01:02:35,099 --> 01:02:37,730
joyful of the fact that humans live here
uh I think it's incredibly important to

3258
01:02:37,730 --> 01:02:37,740
uh I think it's incredibly important to
 

3259
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:41,329
uh I think it's incredibly important to
remember how much progress we've had uh

3260
01:02:41,329 --> 01:02:41,339
remember how much progress we've had uh
 

3261
01:02:41,339 --> 01:02:43,190
remember how much progress we've had uh
you know most people just don't stop to

3262
01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:43,200
you know most people just don't stop to
 

3263
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,230
you know most people just don't stop to
think about those stats yeah I get that

3264
01:02:45,230 --> 01:02:45,240
think about those stats yeah I get that
 

3265
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:48,289
think about those stats yeah I get that
in the normal bustle of day but just you

3266
01:02:48,289 --> 01:02:48,299
in the normal bustle of day but just you
 

3267
01:02:48,299 --> 01:02:51,349
in the normal bustle of day but just you
know in 1900 the average person on the

3268
01:02:51,349 --> 01:02:51,359
know in 1900 the average person on the
 

3269
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:54,230
know in 1900 the average person on the
planet lived to be 32 years

3270
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:54,240
planet lived to be 32 years
 

3271
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,750
planet lived to be 32 years
32 years that was our average life

3272
01:02:56,750 --> 01:02:56,760
32 years that was our average life
 

3273
01:02:56,760 --> 01:03:00,589
32 years that was our average life
expectancy uh today it's about 74. uh so

3274
01:03:00,589 --> 01:03:00,599
expectancy uh today it's about 74. uh so
 

3275
01:03:00,599 --> 01:03:03,650
expectancy uh today it's about 74. uh so
we've literally got two lifetimes on

3276
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:03,660
we've literally got two lifetimes on
 

3277
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:06,170
we've literally got two lifetimes on
this planet each one of us and and you

3278
01:03:06,170 --> 01:03:06,180
this planet each one of us and and you
 

3279
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:08,569
this planet each one of us and and you
know every year you live in in the rich

3280
01:03:08,569 --> 01:03:08,579
know every year you live in in the rich
 

3281
01:03:08,579 --> 01:03:11,450
know every year you live in in the rich
world you get to live three months

3282
01:03:11,450 --> 01:03:11,460
world you get to live three months
 

3283
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:13,549
world you get to live three months
longer and the poor world is about four

3284
01:03:13,549 --> 01:03:13,559
longer and the poor world is about four
 

3285
01:03:13,559 --> 01:03:15,770
longer and the poor world is about four
months longer because of medical

3286
01:03:15,770 --> 01:03:15,780
months longer because of medical
 

3287
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:17,450
months longer because of medical
advances because we get better at

3288
01:03:17,450 --> 01:03:17,460
advances because we get better at
 

3289
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,069
advances because we get better at
dealing both with cancer and especially

3290
01:03:19,069 --> 01:03:19,079
dealing both with cancer and especially
 

3291
01:03:19,079 --> 01:03:21,829
dealing both with cancer and especially
uh right now with uh with heart disease

3292
01:03:21,829 --> 01:03:21,839
uh right now with uh with heart disease
 

3293
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:24,289
uh right now with uh with heart disease
uh these are amazing achievements of

3294
01:03:24,289 --> 01:03:24,299
uh these are amazing achievements of
 

3295
01:03:24,299 --> 01:03:26,030
uh these are amazing achievements of
course it's a very very small part of it

3296
01:03:26,030 --> 01:03:26,040
course it's a very very small part of it
 

3297
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:28,130
course it's a very very small part of it
we're much better fed we're much better

3298
01:03:28,130 --> 01:03:28,140
we're much better fed we're much better
 

3299
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:29,870
we're much better fed we're much better
educated we've gone from a world where

3300
01:03:29,870 --> 01:03:29,880
educated we've gone from a world where
 

3301
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:32,690
educated we've gone from a world where
virtually everyone or you know what 90

3302

virtually everyone or you know what 90

01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:35,270
virtually everyone or you know what 90
percent were were illiterate to a world

3304
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:35,280
percent were were illiterate to a world
 

3305
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:37,789
percent were were illiterate to a world
where more than 90 illiterate this is an

3306
01:03:37,789 --> 01:03:37,799
where more than 90 illiterate this is an
 

3307
01:03:37,799 --> 01:03:40,670
where more than 90 illiterate this is an
astounding opportunity and and 200 years

01:03:40,670 --> 01:03:40,680
astounding opportunity and and 200 years
 

3309
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:41,770
astounding opportunity and and 200 years

3313
01:03:44,579 --> 01:03:47,870
95 94 percent
of the world were extremely poor that is

01:03:47,870 --> 01:03:47,880
of the world were extremely poor that is
 

3315
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:50,150
of the world were extremely poor that is
less than a dollar a day today that uh

3316
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:50,160
less than a dollar a day today that uh
 

3317
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,430
less than a dollar a day today that uh
for for the first time in 2015 it was

3318
01:03:52,430 --> 01:03:52,440
for for the first time in 2015 it was
 

3319
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:55,069
for for the first time in 2015 it was
down below 10 so there and and again

3320
01:03:55,069 --> 01:03:55,079
down below 10 so there and and again
 

3321
01:03:55,079 --> 01:03:57,410
down below 10 so there and and again
these are kind of boring statistics but

3322
01:03:57,410 --> 01:03:57,420
these are kind of boring statistics but
 

3323
01:03:57,420 --> 01:04:00,530
these are kind of boring statistics but
they're also astounding uh Testaments of

3324
01:04:00,530 --> 01:04:00,540
they're also astounding uh Testaments of
 

3325
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:02,990
they're also astounding uh Testaments of
how how well Humanity has done so just

3326
01:04:02,990 --> 01:04:03,000
how how well Humanity has done so just
 

3327
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,289
how how well Humanity has done so just
on on the point of uh we've kind of just

3328
01:04:06,289 --> 01:04:06,299
on on the point of uh we've kind of just
 

3329
01:04:06,299 --> 01:04:08,089
on on the point of uh we've kind of just
been focused on making our own world

3330
01:04:08,089 --> 01:04:08,099
been focused on making our own world
 

3331
01:04:08,099 --> 01:04:10,309
been focused on making our own world
better uh and in many ways you know so

3332
01:04:10,309 --> 01:04:10,319
better uh and in many ways you know so
 

3333
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:12,770
better uh and in many ways you know so
we've hunted a lot of uh big animals

3334
01:04:12,770 --> 01:04:12,780
we've hunted a lot of uh big animals
 

3335
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:15,470
we've hunted a lot of uh big animals
either to Extinction or uh down to much

3336
01:04:15,470 --> 01:04:15,480
either to Extinction or uh down to much
 

3337
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:17,390
either to Extinction or uh down to much
much smaller populations there's much

3338
01:04:17,390 --> 01:04:17,400
much smaller populations there's much
 

3339
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,069
much smaller populations there's much
smaller populations of fish in the ocean

3340
01:04:19,069 --> 01:04:19,079
smaller populations of fish in the ocean
 

3341
01:04:19,079 --> 01:04:21,950
smaller populations of fish in the ocean
so there's a lot of of things that that

3342
01:04:21,950 --> 01:04:21,960
so there's a lot of of things that that
 

3343
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:23,870
so there's a lot of of things that that
sort of fare the brunt of our success

3344
01:04:23,870 --> 01:04:23,880
sort of fare the brunt of our success
 

3345
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:26,150
sort of fare the brunt of our success
not it's not because we're evil in that

3346
01:04:26,150 --> 01:04:26,160
not it's not because we're evil in that
 

3347
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:28,010
not it's not because we're evil in that
sense it's just because we didn't All

3348
01:04:28,010 --> 01:04:28,020
sense it's just because we didn't All
 

3349
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:30,890
sense it's just because we didn't All
Care all that much about them uh I think

3350
01:04:30,890 --> 01:04:30,900
Care all that much about them uh I think
 

3351
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:32,990
Care all that much about them uh I think
it is important as one funnel of that

3352
01:04:32,990 --> 01:04:33,000
it is important as one funnel of that
 

3353
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,910
it is important as one funnel of that
I'm not gonna make a big deal out of it

3354
01:04:34,910 --> 01:04:34,920
I'm not gonna make a big deal out of it
 

3355
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:36,589
I'm not gonna make a big deal out of it
uh but the fact that we're putting out

3356
01:04:36,589 --> 01:04:36,599
uh but the fact that we're putting out
 

3357
01:04:36,599 --> 01:04:38,750
uh but the fact that we're putting out
more CO2 in the atmosphere uh because

3358
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:38,760
more CO2 in the atmosphere uh because
 

3359
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:40,910
more CO2 in the atmosphere uh because
CO2 as you also mentioned before it's

3360
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:40,920
CO2 as you also mentioned before it's
 

3361
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:43,789
CO2 as you also mentioned before it's
actually plant food uh you know if if

3362
01:04:43,789 --> 01:04:43,799
actually plant food uh you know if if
 

3363
01:04:43,799 --> 01:04:46,549
actually plant food uh you know if if
you're if you're a greenhouse grower you

3364
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:46,559
you're if you're a greenhouse grower you
 

3365
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:48,049
you're if you're a greenhouse grower you
know if you put in CO2 in your

3366
01:04:48,049 --> 01:04:48,059
know if you put in CO2 in your
 

3367
01:04:48,059 --> 01:04:49,789
know if you put in CO2 in your
Greenhouse you actually get bigger and

3368
01:04:49,789 --> 01:04:49,799
Greenhouse you actually get bigger and
 

3369
01:04:49,799 --> 01:04:52,190
Greenhouse you actually get bigger and
plumper tomatoes and and that's

3370
01:04:52,190 --> 01:04:52,200
plumper tomatoes and and that's
 

3371
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:53,390
plumper tomatoes and and that's
essentially what we're doing in the

3372
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:53,400
essentially what we're doing in the
 

3373
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:55,309
essentially what we're doing in the
world this has overall bad consequences

3374
01:04:55,309 --> 01:04:55,319
world this has overall bad consequences
 

3375
01:04:55,319 --> 01:04:57,230
world this has overall bad consequences
and and that's why we should be doing

3376
01:04:57,230 --> 01:04:57,240
and and that's why we should be doing
 

3377
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:59,630
and and that's why we should be doing
something about it but one of the good

3378
01:04:59,630 --> 01:04:59,640
something about it but one of the good
 

3379
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:01,910
something about it but one of the good
side effects is actually that the world

3380
01:05:01,910 --> 01:05:01,920
side effects is actually that the world
 

3381
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:04,250
side effects is actually that the world
is getting greener uh so we get much

3382
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:04,260
is getting greener uh so we get much
 

3383
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:06,589
is getting greener uh so we get much
more green stuff now I don't know and

3384
01:05:06,589 --> 01:05:06,599
more green stuff now I don't know and
 

3385
01:05:06,599 --> 01:05:08,690
more green stuff now I don't know and
and this is where I sort of show my

3386
01:05:08,690 --> 01:05:08,700
and this is where I sort of show my
 

3387
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:11,450
and this is where I sort of show my
Economist uh Roots uh because if you

3388
01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:11,460
Economist uh Roots uh because if you
 

3389
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:15,890
Economist uh Roots uh because if you
just measure all living stuff in uh in

3390
01:05:15,890 --> 01:05:15,900
just measure all living stuff in uh in
 

3391
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:18,950
just measure all living stuff in uh in
tons uh so in weight there's actually

3392
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:18,960
tons uh so in weight there's actually
 

3393
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:21,589
tons uh so in weight there's actually
more living stuff than there were a

3394
01:05:21,589 --> 01:05:21,599
more living stuff than there were a
 

3395
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:24,829
more living stuff than there were a
hundred years ago because elephants and

3396
01:05:24,829 --> 01:05:24,839
hundred years ago because elephants and
 

3397
01:05:24,839 --> 01:05:27,049
hundred years ago because elephants and
uh all these other you know Big Fish and

3398
01:05:27,049 --> 01:05:27,059
uh all these other you know Big Fish and
 

3399
01:05:27,059 --> 01:05:28,789
uh all these other you know Big Fish and
stuff are actually really really small

3400
01:05:28,789 --> 01:05:28,799
stuff are actually really really small
 

3401
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:30,609
stuff are actually really really small
fraction of the world

3402
01:05:30,609 --> 01:05:30,619
fraction of the world
 

3403
01:05:30,619 --> 01:05:33,829
fraction of the world
yeah the fact that we have yes so we

3404
01:05:33,829 --> 01:05:33,839
yeah the fact that we have yes so we
 

3405
01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:35,270
yeah the fact that we have yes so we
have an enormous amount of live stuff

3406
01:05:35,270 --> 01:05:35,280
have an enormous amount of live stuff
 

3407
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:37,549
have an enormous amount of live stuff
but that doesn't even measure it it's

3408
01:05:37,549 --> 01:05:37,559
but that doesn't even measure it it's
 

3409
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:39,069
but that doesn't even measure it it's
mostly just wood

3410
01:05:39,069 --> 01:05:39,079
mostly just wood
 

3411
01:05:39,079 --> 01:05:41,870
mostly just wood
wooden green stuff that yeah that's

3412
01:05:41,870 --> 01:05:41,880
wooden green stuff that yeah that's
 

3413
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:43,849
wooden green stuff that yeah that's
dramatically increased in the world now

3414
01:05:43,849 --> 01:05:43,859
dramatically increased in the world now
 

3415
01:05:43,859 --> 01:05:45,710
dramatically increased in the world now
we're still not not there from what it

3416
01:05:45,710 --> 01:05:45,720
we're still not not there from what it
 

3417
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:48,230
we're still not not there from what it
was in 1500 so we've we've still cut

3418
01:05:48,230 --> 01:05:48,240
was in 1500 so we've we've still cut
 

3419
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,150
was in 1500 so we've we've still cut
down the world a lot but we're actually

3420
01:05:50,150 --> 01:05:50,160
down the world a lot but we're actually
 

3421
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:52,730
down the world a lot but we're actually
making a much Greener World again not

3422
01:05:52,730 --> 01:05:52,740
making a much Greener World again not
 

3423
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:54,589
making a much Greener World again not
because we really cared or thought about

3424
01:05:54,589 --> 01:05:54,599
because we really cared or thought about
 

3425
01:05:54,599 --> 01:05:56,270
because we really cared or thought about
it but just sort of a side effect of

3426
01:05:56,270 --> 01:05:56,280
it but just sort of a side effect of
 

3427
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:58,490
it but just sort of a side effect of
what we're doing I think the crucial bit

3428
01:05:58,490 --> 01:05:58,500
what we're doing I think the crucial bit
 

3429
01:05:58,500 --> 01:05:59,990
what we're doing I think the crucial bit
to remember is

3430
01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:00,000
to remember is
 

3431
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,569
to remember is
when you're poor and you worry about

3432
01:06:02,569 --> 01:06:02,579
when you're poor and you worry about
 

3433
01:06:02,579 --> 01:06:05,030
when you're poor and you worry about
what's going to happen the next day

3434
01:06:05,030 --> 01:06:05,040
what's going to happen the next day
 

3435
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:08,510
what's going to happen the next day
this is just not your main issue yeah am

3436
01:06:08,510 --> 01:06:08,520
this is just not your main issue yeah am
 

3437
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:12,170
this is just not your main issue yeah am
I killing too many large animals in the

3438
01:06:12,170 --> 01:06:12,180
I killing too many large animals in the

that EDF was going to launch it methane
satellite it would have laughed out loud

3756
01:12:02,870 --> 01:12:02,880
satellite it would have laughed out loud
 

3757
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:05,209
satellite it would have laughed out loud
so technology plays a huge role

3758
01:12:05,209 --> 01:12:05,219
so technology plays a huge role
 

3759
01:12:05,219 --> 01:12:09,050
so technology plays a huge role
if it's kind of you know employed with

01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,750
me just uh my my editor actually hated
the subtitle because it gives away the

3784
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:35,760
the subtitle because it gives away the
 

3785
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:38,330
the subtitle because it gives away the
whole book basically it tells you what

3786
01:12:38,330 --> 01:12:38,340
whole book basically it tells you what
 

3787
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:40,729
whole book basically it tells you what
the book tries to make I I think you

3788
01:12:40,729 --> 01:12:40,739
the book tries to make I I think you
 

3789
01:12:40,739 --> 01:12:42,050
the book tries to make I I think you
know that's exactly what it should be

3790
01:12:42,050 --> 01:12:42,060
know that's exactly what it should be
 

3791
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:44,270
know that's exactly what it should be
it's about getting this conversation out

3792
01:12:44,270 --> 01:12:44,280
it's about getting this conversation out
 

3793
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:47,689
it's about getting this conversation out
in the in in the public sphere so the

3794
01:12:47,689 --> 01:12:47,699
in the in in the public sphere so the
 

3795
01:12:47,699 --> 01:12:49,790
in the in in the public sphere so the
worst thing that climate change can do

3796
01:12:49,790 --> 01:12:49,800
worst thing that climate change can do
 

3797
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:52,490
worst thing that climate change can do
is like the worst thing that anything

3798
01:12:52,490 --> 01:12:52,500
is like the worst thing that anything
 

3799
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:54,590
is like the worst thing that anything
can do is that it wipes out everything

3800
01:12:54,590 --> 01:12:54,600
can do is that it wipes out everything
 

3801
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:57,590
can do is that it wipes out everything
and we all die so it's it's not like you

3802
01:12:57,590 --> 01:12:57,600
and we all die so it's it's not like you
 

3803
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,689
and we all die so it's it's not like you
know if you're just looking for worst

3804
01:12:59,689 --> 01:12:59,699
know if you're just looking for worst
 

3805
01:12:59,699 --> 01:13:02,330
know if you're just looking for worst
case outcomes uh you know anything can

3806
01:13:02,330 --> 01:13:02,340
case outcomes uh you know anything can
 

3807
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:04,970
case outcomes uh you know anything can
get to the worst case outcome

3808
01:13:04,970 --> 01:13:04,980
get to the worst case outcome
 

3809
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:07,610
get to the worst case outcome
um imagine if we uh suggest what's the

3810
01:13:07,610 --> 01:13:07,620
um imagine if we uh suggest what's the
 

3811
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:10,010
um imagine if we uh suggest what's the
worst thing that could happen from HIV

3812
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:10,020
worst thing that could happen from HIV
 

3813
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:14,450
worst thing that could happen from HIV
it breaks down of a one or more African

3814
01:13:14,450 --> 01:13:14,460
it breaks down of a one or more African
 

3815
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:16,729
it breaks down of a one or more African
States because we don't fix it and then

3816
01:13:16,729 --> 01:13:16,739
States because we don't fix it and then
 

3817
01:13:16,739 --> 01:13:19,550
States because we don't fix it and then
you get sort of uh biological warfare

3818
01:13:19,550 --> 01:13:19,560
you get sort of uh biological warfare
 

3819
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,470
you get sort of uh biological warfare
and terrorism throwing that in the mix

3820
01:13:21,470 --> 01:13:21,480
and terrorism throwing that in the mix
 

3821
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,030
and terrorism throwing that in the mix
and then you get someone who makes a

3822
01:13:23,030 --> 01:13:23,040
and then you get someone who makes a
 

3823
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:25,010
and then you get someone who makes a
virus and kills the whole world you know

3824
01:13:25,010 --> 01:13:25,020
virus and kills the whole world you know
 

3825
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:27,410
virus and kills the whole world you know
you can make worst case scenarios for

3826
01:13:27,410 --> 01:13:27,420
you can make worst case scenarios for
 

3827
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:29,030
you can make worst case scenarios for
everything so let's just call it I get

3828
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:29,040
everything so let's just call it I get
 

3829
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:30,770
everything so let's just call it I get
the point and sorry for an interruption

3830
01:13:30,770 --> 01:13:30,780
the point and sorry for an interruption
 

3831
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:33,290
the point and sorry for an interruption
and and I appreciate worst case analysis

3832
01:13:33,290 --> 01:13:33,300
and and I appreciate worst case analysis
 

3833
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:35,149
and and I appreciate worst case analysis
because I'm I am fundamentally computer

3834
01:13:35,149 --> 01:13:35,159
because I'm I am fundamentally computer
 

3835
01:13:35,159 --> 01:13:36,890
because I'm I am fundamentally computer
scientist and that was the thing that

3836
01:13:36,890 --> 01:13:36,900
scientist and that was the thing that
 

3837
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:39,709
scientist and that was the thing that
defined the discipline of the to measure

3838
01:13:39,709 --> 01:13:39,719
defined the discipline of the to measure
 

3839
01:13:39,719 --> 01:13:41,689
defined the discipline of the to measure
the quality of the algorithm you measure

3840
01:13:41,689 --> 01:13:41,699
the quality of the algorithm you measure
 

3841
01:13:41,699 --> 01:13:44,030
the quality of the algorithm you measure
what is its worth worst case performance

3842
01:13:44,030 --> 01:13:44,040
what is its worth worst case performance
 

3843
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:46,130
what is its worth worst case performance
that's the Big O notation that's how you

3844
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:46,140
that's the Big O notation that's how you
 

3845
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:48,050
that's the Big O notation that's how you
discuss algorithms what is the worst

3846
01:13:48,050 --> 01:13:48,060
discuss algorithms what is the worst
 

3847
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:51,410
discuss algorithms what is the worst
possible thing uh in terms of

3848
01:13:51,410 --> 01:13:51,420
possible thing uh in terms of
 

3849
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:54,169
possible thing uh in terms of
performance this thing can do but for

3850
01:13:54,169 --> 01:13:54,179
performance this thing can do but for
 

3851
01:13:54,179 --> 01:13:57,890
performance this thing can do but for
climate change let's even go crazy what

3852
01:13:57,890 --> 01:13:57,900
climate change let's even go crazy what
 

3853
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:00,229
climate change let's even go crazy what
is exactly the worst case scenario for

3854
01:14:00,229 --> 01:14:00,239
is exactly the worst case scenario for
 

3855
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:02,990
is exactly the worst case scenario for
climate change because uh

3856
01:14:02,990 --> 01:14:03,000
climate change because uh
 

3857
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,689
climate change because uh
I have to be honest and say I haven't

3858
01:14:05,689 --> 01:14:05,699
I have to be honest and say I haven't
 

3859
01:14:05,699 --> 01:14:08,450
I have to be honest and say I haven't
really paid it deep attention I just

3860
01:14:08,450 --> 01:14:08,460
really paid it deep attention I just
 

3861
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:11,630
really paid it deep attention I just
have a lot of colleagues who think about

3862
01:14:11,630 --> 01:14:11,640
have a lot of colleagues who think about
 

3863
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:14,270
have a lot of colleagues who think about
climate and so on and there's a kind of

3864
01:14:14,270 --> 01:14:14,280
climate and so on and there's a kind of
 

3865
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:16,550
climate and so on and there's a kind of
in the alarmism there was a sense what

3866
01:14:16,550 --> 01:14:16,560
in the alarmism there was a sense what
 

3867
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:19,090
in the alarmism there was a sense what
this is this is a very serious problem

3868
01:14:19,090 --> 01:14:19,100
this is this is a very serious problem
 

3869
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:22,330
this is this is a very serious problem
and then the sentence would never finish

3870
01:14:22,330 --> 01:14:22,340
and then the sentence would never finish
 

3871
01:14:22,340 --> 01:14:24,649
and then the sentence would never finish
what exactly is the problem well the

3872
01:14:24,649 --> 01:14:24,659
what exactly is the problem well the
 

3873
01:14:24,659 --> 01:14:27,110
what exactly is the problem well the
extinction of the human species okay

3874
01:14:27,110 --> 01:14:27,120
extinction of the human species okay
 

3875
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:29,510
extinction of the human species okay
with a virus I understand how that could

3876
01:14:29,510 --> 01:14:29,520
with a virus I understand how that could
 

3877
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:32,149
with a virus I understand how that could
possibly happen what is the mechanism by

3878
01:14:32,149 --> 01:14:32,159
possibly happen what is the mechanism by
 

3879
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:34,610
possibly happen what is the mechanism by
which the human species becomes extinct

3880
01:14:34,610 --> 01:14:34,620
which the human species becomes extinct
 

3881
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:36,169
which the human species becomes extinct
because of climate change

3882
01:14:36,169 --> 01:14:36,179
because of climate change
 

3883
01:14:36,179 --> 01:14:38,149
because of climate change
I'm not sure I would want to be able to

3884
01:14:38,149 --> 01:14:38,159
I'm not sure I would want to be able to
 

3885
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:39,830
I'm not sure I would want to be able to
argue that because it really requires

3886
01:14:39,830 --> 01:14:39,840
argue that because it really requires
 

3887
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,830
argue that because it really requires
you to have sort of very very extreme

3888
01:14:41,830 --> 01:14:41,840
you to have sort of very very extreme
 

3889
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:44,870
you to have sort of very very extreme
parameter choices all down the line and

3890
01:14:44,870 --> 01:14:44,880
parameter choices all down the line and
 

3891
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,550
parameter choices all down the line and
so it's more you know it's this kind of

3892
01:14:46,550 --> 01:14:46,560
so it's more you know it's this kind of
 

3893
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:48,649
so it's more you know it's this kind of
idea that we that we hit some of these

3894
01:14:48,649 --> 01:14:48,659
idea that we that we hit some of these
 

3895
01:14:48,659 --> 01:14:51,229
idea that we that we hit some of these
unexpected uh outcomes so for instance

3896
01:14:51,229 --> 01:14:51,239
unexpected uh outcomes so for instance
 

3897
01:14:51,239 --> 01:14:54,229
unexpected uh outcomes so for instance
uh the Western Arctic ice sheet uh melts

3898
01:14:54,229 --> 01:14:54,239
uh the Western Arctic ice sheet uh melts
 

3899
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:56,390
uh the Western Arctic ice sheet uh melts
really really quickly it doesn't look

3900
01:14:56,390 --> 01:14:56,400
really really quickly it doesn't look
 

3901
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:57,709
really really quickly it doesn't look
like that can happen really really

3902
01:14:57,709 --> 01:14:57,719
like that can happen really really
 

3903
01:14:57,719 --> 01:14:59,689
like that can happen really really
quickly but let's just you know say that

3904
01:14:59,689 --> 01:14:59,699
quickly but let's just you know say that
 

3905
01:14:59,699 --> 01:15:01,370
quickly but let's just you know say that
this could happen within 100 years or

3906
01:15:01,370 --> 01:15:01,380
this could happen within 100 years or
 

3907
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:04,130
this could happen within 100 years or
something so we basically get what

3908
01:15:04,130 --> 01:15:04,140
something so we basically get what
 

3909
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:06,709
something so we basically get what
um seven meters what is that 20 feet of

3910
01:15:06,709 --> 01:15:06,719
um seven meters what is that 20 feet of
 

3911
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:10,070
um seven meters what is that 20 feet of
sea level rise uh that will be a real

3912
01:15:10,070 --> 01:15:10,080
sea level rise uh that will be a real
 

3913
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:11,810
sea level rise uh that will be a real
challenge to a lot of places around the

3914
01:15:11,810 --> 01:15:11,820
challenge to a lot of places around the
 

3915
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:13,430
challenge to a lot of places around the
world this would have you know

3916
01:15:13,430 --> 01:15:13,440
world this would have you know
 

3917
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:16,430
world this would have you know
significant costs uh it's likely and you

3918
01:15:16,430 --> 01:15:16,440
significant costs uh it's likely and you
 

3919
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:17,630
significant costs uh it's likely and you
know there's actually been a study

3920
01:15:17,630 --> 01:15:17,640
know there's actually been a study
 

3921
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:19,610
know there's actually been a study
that's tried to estimate could we deal

3922
01:15:19,610 --> 01:15:19,620
that's tried to estimate could we deal
 

3923
01:15:19,620 --> 01:15:21,649
that's tried to estimate could we deal
with that and the this the short answer

3924
01:15:21,649 --> 01:15:21,659
with that and the this the short answer
 

3925
01:15:21,659 --> 01:15:24,830
with that and the this the short answer
is yes if you're fairly well off you

3926
01:15:24,830 --> 01:15:24,840
is yes if you're fairly well off you
 

3927
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:26,030
is yes if you're fairly well off you
know if you're a Holland you can

3928
01:15:26,030 --> 01:15:26,040
know if you're a Holland you can
 

3929
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:28,250
know if you're a Holland you can
definitely deal with it it's also likely

3930
01:15:28,250 --> 01:15:28,260
definitely deal with it it's also likely
 

3931
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:30,470
definitely deal with it it's also likely
that most developing countries are going

3932
01:15:30,470 --> 01:15:30,480
that most developing countries are going
 

3933
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:32,810
that most developing countries are going
to be much closer to Holland towards the

3934
01:15:32,810 --> 01:15:32,820
to be much closer to Holland towards the
 

3935
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:34,250
to be much closer to Holland towards the
end of the century because they'll be

3936
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:34,260
end of the century because they'll be
 

3937
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:36,110
end of the century because they'll be
much richer so they can probably handle

3938
01:15:36,110 --> 01:15:36,120
much richer so they can probably handle
 

3939
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:38,270
much richer so they can probably handle
it but it will be a real challenge may I

3940
01:15:38,270 --> 01:15:38,280
it but it will be a real challenge may I
 

3941
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:39,830
it but it will be a real challenge may I
ask a dumb question yeah what happens

3942
01:15:39,830 --> 01:15:39,840
ask a dumb question yeah what happens
 

3943
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:43,790
ask a dumb question yeah what happens
when the C level rises exactly what is

3944
01:15:43,790 --> 01:15:43,800
when the C level rises exactly what is
 

3945
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:45,830
when the C level rises exactly what is
the painful aspect of that

3946
01:15:45,830 --> 01:15:45,840
the painful aspect of that
 

3947
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:47,990
the painful aspect of that
it is that all of your current

3948
01:15:47,990 --> 01:15:48,000
it is that all of your current
 

3949
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,209
it is that all of your current
infrastructure and a lot of coastal

3950
01:15:50,209 --> 01:15:50,219
infrastructure and a lot of coastal
 

3951
01:15:50,219 --> 01:15:51,950
infrastructure and a lot of coastal
cities around the world that are

3952
01:15:51,950 --> 01:15:51,960
cities around the world that are
 

3953
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:54,110
cities around the world that are
literally built on you know Jakarta is a

3954
01:15:54,110 --> 01:15:54,120
literally built on you know Jakarta is a
 

3955
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:56,270
literally built on you know Jakarta is a
good example that are literally built on

3956
01:15:56,270 --> 01:15:56,280
good example that are literally built on
 

3957
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:59,390
good example that are literally built on
the uh just you know inches above the

3958
01:15:59,390 --> 01:15:59,400
the uh just you know inches above the
 

3959
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:02,030
the uh just you know inches above the
sea level uh if if you then get a sea

3960
01:16:02,030 --> 01:16:02,040
sea level uh if if you then get a sea
 

3961
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:04,370
sea level uh if if you then get a sea
level rise they'll rise say what would

3962
01:16:04,370 --> 01:16:04,380
level rise they'll rise say what would
 

3963
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:06,410
level rise they'll rise say what would
uh 20 feet if that would be like a third

3964
01:16:06,410 --> 01:16:06,420
uh 20 feet if that would be like a third
 

3965
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:08,570
uh 20 feet if that would be like a third
or a fourth of a of a foot every year

3966
01:16:08,570 --> 01:16:08,580
or a fourth of a of a foot every year
 

3967
01:16:08,580 --> 01:16:10,610
or a fourth of a of a foot every year
yeah kind of thing yeah I see no

3968
01:16:10,610 --> 01:16:10,620
yeah kind of thing yeah I see no
 

3969
01:16:10,620 --> 01:16:12,590
yeah kind of thing yeah I see no
evidence that that's even well hold on a

3970
01:16:12,590 --> 01:16:12,600
evidence that that's even well hold on a
 

3971
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:13,669
evidence that that's even well hold on a
second let's we're not talking about

3972
01:16:13,669 --> 01:16:13,679
second let's we're not talking about
 

3973
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:15,709
second let's we're not talking about
evidence no talking about worst case

3974
01:16:15,709 --> 01:16:15,719
evidence no talking about worst case
 

3975
01:16:15,719 --> 01:16:17,689
evidence no talking about worst case
analysis and algorithms and and so so

3976
01:16:17,689 --> 01:16:17,699
analysis and algorithms and and so so
 

3977
01:16:17,699 --> 01:16:19,430
analysis and algorithms and and so so
basically you would see your

3978
01:16:19,430 --> 01:16:19,440
basically you would see your
 

3979
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:22,189
basically you would see your
infrastructure all all your stuff very

3980
01:16:22,189 --> 01:16:22,199
infrastructure all all your stuff very
 

3981
01:16:22,199 --> 01:16:24,830
infrastructure all all your stuff very
quickly being very very challenged and

3982
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:24,840
quickly being very very challenged and
 

3983
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:26,930
quickly being very very challenged and
you basically have to put up huge sea

3984
01:16:26,930 --> 01:16:26,940
you basically have to put up huge sea
 

3985
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:30,110
you basically have to put up huge sea
walls or uh migrate out of that very

3986
01:16:30,110 --> 01:16:30,120
walls or uh migrate out of that very
 

3987
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:32,870
walls or uh migrate out of that very
quickly well very quickly as in in 50

3988
01:16:32,870 --> 01:16:32,880
quickly well very quickly as in in 50
 

3989
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:35,510
quickly well very quickly as in in 50
years or something right right so like I

3990
01:16:35,510 --> 01:16:35,520
years or something right right so like I
 

3991
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:38,990
years or something right right so like I
is that as a human species

3992
01:16:38,990 --> 01:16:39,000
is that as a human species
 

3993
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,290
is that as a human species
were not able to respond to that kind of

3994
01:16:42,290 --> 01:16:42,300
were not able to respond to that kind of
 

3995
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:45,050
were not able to respond to that kind of
course and and look again the point here

3996
01:16:45,050 --> 01:16:45,060
course and and look again the point here
 

3997
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:47,030
course and and look again the point here
is then there's there's a lot of other

3998
01:16:47,030 --> 01:16:47,040
is then there's there's a lot of other
 

3999
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:49,430
is then there's there's a lot of other
arguments and I I should just you know

4000
01:16:49,430 --> 01:16:49,440
arguments and I I should just you know
 

4001
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:51,410
arguments and I I should just you know
put the disclaimer this is not what I

4002
01:16:51,410 --> 01:16:51,420
put the disclaimer this is not what I
 

4003
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:53,030
put the disclaimer this is not what I
think is correct but you know you're

4004
01:16:53,030 --> 01:16:53,040
think is correct but you know you're
 

4005
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:54,590
think is correct but you know you're
asking me what's the what's the worst

4006
01:16:54,590 --> 01:16:54,600
asking me what's the what's the worst
 

4007
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:58,550
asking me what's the what's the worst
case outcome that you have uh uh so most

4008
01:16:58,550 --> 01:16:58,560
case outcome that you have uh uh so most
 

4009
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:00,590
case outcome that you have uh uh so most
of global warming is really about that

4010
01:17:00,590 --> 01:17:00,600
of global warming is really about that
 

4011
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:03,229
of global warming is really about that
we we're used to one way of doing things

4012
01:17:03,229 --> 01:17:03,239
we we're used to one way of doing things
 

4013
01:17:03,239 --> 01:17:05,510
we we're used to one way of doing things
so you know we we live in Jakarta

4014
01:17:05,510 --> 01:17:05,520
so you know we we live in Jakarta
 

4015
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:08,030
so you know we we live in Jakarta
because it's right next to the Sea we're

4016
01:17:08,030 --> 01:17:08,040
because it's right next to the Sea we're
 

4017
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:10,370
because it's right next to the Sea we're
used to the Sea being at this level uh

4018
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:10,380
used to the Sea being at this level uh
 

4019
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:13,370
used to the Sea being at this level uh
we grow our crops because we're used to

4020
01:17:13,370 --> 01:17:13,380
we grow our crops because we're used to
 

4021
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:15,830
we grow our crops because we're used to
you know you grow a corn here you grow

4022
01:17:15,830 --> 01:17:15,840
you know you grow a corn here you grow
 

4023
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:17,510
you know you grow a corn here you grow
wheat here because we're used to that

4024
01:17:17,510 --> 01:17:17,520
wheat here because we're used to that
 

4025
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:19,790
wheat here because we're used to that
where the precipitation and the uh

4026
01:17:19,790 --> 01:17:19,800
where the precipitation and the uh
 

4027
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:21,709
where the precipitation and the uh
temperature is the right for this kind

4028
01:17:21,709 --> 01:17:21,719
temperature is the right for this kind
 

4029
01:17:21,719 --> 01:17:24,890
temperature is the right for this kind
of crop if this changes and this is the

4030
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:24,900
of crop if this changes and this is the
 

4031
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:26,270
of crop if this changes and this is the
same thing with with you know with

4032
01:17:26,270 --> 01:17:26,280
same thing with with you know with
 

4033
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:28,430
same thing with with you know with
houses if it gets colder if it gets

4034
01:17:28,430 --> 01:17:28,440
houses if it gets colder if it gets
 

4035
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:29,990
houses if it gets colder if it gets
warmer it's suddenly uncomfortable

4036
01:17:29,990 --> 01:17:30,000
warmer it's suddenly uncomfortable
 

4037
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,570
warmer it's suddenly uncomfortable
because you've built your house wrong so

4038
01:17:32,570 --> 01:17:32,580
because you've built your house wrong so
 

4039
01:17:32,580 --> 01:17:35,149
because you've built your house wrong so
our infrastructure will be wrong if the

4040
01:17:35,149 --> 01:17:35,159
our infrastructure will be wrong if the
 

4041
01:17:35,159 --> 01:17:36,770
our infrastructure will be wrong if the
world changes and that's what climate

4042
01:17:36,770 --> 01:17:36,780
world changes and that's what climate
 

4043
01:17:36,780 --> 01:17:39,470
world changes and that's what climate
change is at a large scale yes and so so

4044
01:17:39,470 --> 01:17:39,480
change is at a large scale yes and so so
 

4045
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:41,510
change is at a large scale yes and so so
this is a problem in most of these

4046
01:17:41,510 --> 01:17:41,520
this is a problem in most of these
 

4047
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:43,850
this is a problem in most of these
sentences but if you then sort of take

4048
01:17:43,850 --> 01:17:43,860
sentences but if you then sort of take
 

4049
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:45,950
sentences but if you then sort of take
it to the extreme and say well imagine

4050
01:17:45,950 --> 01:17:45,960
it to the extreme and say well imagine
 

4051
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:47,510
it to the extreme and say well imagine
that you're going to get a huge sea

4052
01:17:47,510 --> 01:17:47,520
that you're going to get a huge sea
 

4053
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,250
that you're going to get a huge sea
level rise imagine that you're going to

4054
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:49,260
level rise imagine that you're going to
 

4055
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:50,750
level rise imagine that you're going to
get a very different sort of

4056
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:50,760
get a very different sort of
 

4057
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:52,910
get a very different sort of
precipitation for instance the the uh

4058
01:17:52,910 --> 01:17:52,920
precipitation for instance the the uh
 

4059
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:55,729
precipitation for instance the the uh
what is it the rain season rain Monsoon

4060
01:17:55,729 --> 01:17:55,739
what is it the rain season rain Monsoon
 

4061
01:17:55,739 --> 01:17:58,250
what is it the rain season rain Monsoon
and and uh and and the Indian

4062
01:17:58,250 --> 01:17:58,260
and and uh and and the Indian
 

4063
01:17:58,260 --> 01:18:01,430
and and uh and and the Indian
subcontinent uh changes uh dramatically

4064
01:18:01,430 --> 01:18:01,440
subcontinent uh changes uh dramatically
 

4065
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:03,950
subcontinent uh changes uh dramatically
that could affect a lot of Agriculture

4066
01:18:03,950 --> 01:18:03,960
that could affect a lot of Agriculture
 

4067
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:06,050
that could affect a lot of Agriculture
and make it really hard to imagine that

4068
01:18:06,050 --> 01:18:06,060
and make it really hard to imagine that
 

4069
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:08,510
and make it really hard to imagine that
you could feed India well there there

4070
01:18:08,510 --> 01:18:08,520
you could feed India well there there
 

4071
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:09,950
you could feed India well there there
are these kinds of things where you can

4072
01:18:09,950 --> 01:18:09,960
are these kinds of things where you can
 

4073
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:13,189
are these kinds of things where you can
imagine uh and then that this would be

4074
01:18:13,189 --> 01:18:13,199
imagine uh and then that this would be
 

4075
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:15,530
imagine uh and then that this would be
very difficult to deal with and then if

4076
01:18:15,530 --> 01:18:15,540
very difficult to deal with and then if
 

4077
01:18:15,540 --> 01:18:17,689
very difficult to deal with and then if
you add all of it up you could possibly

4078
01:18:17,689 --> 01:18:17,699
you add all of it up you could possibly
 

4079
01:18:17,699 --> 01:18:19,610
you add all of it up you could possibly
get sort of a system collapse because

4080
01:18:19,610 --> 01:18:19,620
get sort of a system collapse because
 

4081
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:21,410
get sort of a system collapse because
you know you just have too many problems

4082
01:18:21,410 --> 01:18:21,420
you know you just have too many problems
 

4083
01:18:21,420 --> 01:18:23,270
you know you just have too many problems
and is it possible to model those kinds

4084
01:18:23,270 --> 01:18:23,280
and is it possible to model those kinds
 

4085
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:27,169
and is it possible to model those kinds
of things so what I understand is the

4086
01:18:27,169 --> 01:18:27,179
of things so what I understand is the
 

4087
01:18:27,179 --> 01:18:29,590
of things so what I understand is the
sea level rise itself

4088
01:18:29,590 --> 01:18:29,600
sea level rise itself
 

4089
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:32,990
sea level rise itself
isn't the destructive thing it's it's

4090
01:18:32,990 --> 01:18:33,000
isn't the destructive thing it's it's
 

4091
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,490
isn't the destructive thing it's it's
the fact that it creates migration

4092
01:18:34,490 --> 01:18:34,500
the fact that it creates migration
 

4093
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:37,250
the fact that it creates migration
patterns and human tension battle over

4094
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:37,260
patterns and human tension battle over
 

4095
01:18:37,260 --> 01:18:40,330
patterns and human tension battle over
resources and since start to get these

4096
01:18:40,330 --> 01:18:40,340
resources and since start to get these
 

4097
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:45,229
resources and since start to get these
these human things human conflict so the

4098
01:18:45,229 --> 01:18:45,239
these human things human conflict so the
 

4099
01:18:45,239 --> 01:18:47,030
these human things human conflict so the
big negative impact won't be necessary

4100
01:18:47,030 --> 01:18:47,040
big negative impact won't be necessary
 

4101
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:48,290
big negative impact won't be necessary
from the fact they have to move your

4102
01:18:48,290 --> 01:18:48,300
from the fact they have to move your
 

4103
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:50,810
from the fact they have to move your
house it's the fact that once you move

4104
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:50,820
house it's the fact that once you move
 

4105
01:18:50,820 --> 01:18:52,250
house it's the fact that once you move
your house that means something else

4106
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:52,260
your house that means something else
 

4107
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:54,050
your house that means something else
down the line and it's a secondary

4108
01:18:54,050 --> 01:18:54,060
down the line and it's a secondary
 

4109
01:18:54,060 --> 01:18:56,330
down the line and it's a secondary
tertiary effects that can have

4110
01:18:56,330 --> 01:18:56,340
tertiary effects that can have
 

4111
01:18:56,340 --> 01:18:58,790
tertiary effects that can have
potentially towards military conflict

4112
01:18:58,790 --> 01:18:58,800
potentially towards military conflict
 

4113
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:01,970
potentially towards military conflict
can have this destabilize entire

4114
01:19:01,970 --> 01:19:01,980
can have this destabilize entire
 

4115
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:03,770
can have this destabilize entire
economies all that kind of stuff because

4116
01:19:03,770 --> 01:19:03,780
economies all that kind of stuff because
 

4117
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:05,630
economies all that kind of stuff because
of the migration power is it possible to

4118
01:19:05,630 --> 01:19:05,640
of the migration power is it possible to
 

4119
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:07,790
of the migration power is it possible to
model those kinds of things so there are

4120
01:19:07,790 --> 01:19:07,800
model those kinds of things so there are
 

4121
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:09,490
model those kinds of things so there are
people who looked at this and and

4122
01:19:09,490 --> 01:19:09,500
people who looked at this and and
 

4123
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:11,870
people who looked at this and and
surprisingly again you know most people

4124
01:19:11,870 --> 01:19:11,880
surprisingly again you know most people
 

4125
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:13,970
surprisingly again you know most people
will move within their country for a lot

4126
01:19:13,970 --> 01:19:13,980
will move within their country for a lot
 

4127
01:19:13,980 --> 01:19:15,530
will move within their country for a lot
of different reasons but you know mainly

4128
01:19:15,530 --> 01:19:15,540
of different reasons but you know mainly
 

4129
01:19:15,540 --> 01:19:18,229
of different reasons but you know mainly
language and and political structure you

4130
01:19:18,229 --> 01:19:18,239
language and and political structure you
 

4131
01:19:18,239 --> 01:19:19,550
language and and political structure you
have your money you have your

4132
01:19:19,550 --> 01:19:19,560
have your money you have your
 

4133
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:21,709
have your money you have your
relationships there so it's not like

4134
01:19:21,709 --> 01:19:21,719
relationships there so it's not like
 

4135
01:19:21,719 --> 01:19:23,689
relationships there so it's not like
we're going to see these big moves you

4136
01:19:23,689 --> 01:19:23,699
we're going to see these big moves you
 

4137
01:19:23,699 --> 01:19:26,209
we're going to see these big moves you
know from uh from uh from the southern

4138
01:19:26,209 --> 01:19:26,219
know from uh from uh from the southern
 

4139
01:19:26,219 --> 01:19:29,390
know from uh from uh from the southern
Mexico and and Central America up to the

4140
01:19:29,390 --> 01:19:29,400
Mexico and and Central America up to the
 

4141
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:32,390
Mexico and and Central America up to the
U.S or from Africa up to the EU that's

4142
01:19:32,390 --> 01:19:32,400
U.S or from Africa up to the EU that's
 

4143
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:33,950
U.S or from Africa up to the EU that's
not predominantly because of climate

4144
01:19:33,950 --> 01:19:33,960
not predominantly because of climate
 

4145
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:35,870
not predominantly because of climate
that's because there's a lot of you know

4146
01:19:35,870 --> 01:19:35,880
that's because there's a lot of you know
 

4147
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:38,689
that's because there's a lot of you know
there's a lot of welfare opportunity uh

4148
01:19:38,689 --> 01:19:38,699
there's a lot of welfare opportunity uh
 

4149
01:19:38,699 --> 01:19:40,610
there's a lot of welfare opportunity uh
you can make your life much much better

4150
01:19:40,610 --> 01:19:40,620
you can make your life much much better
 

4151
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:41,689
you can make your life much much better
you can become much more productive

4152
01:19:41,689 --> 01:19:41,699
you can become much more productive
 

4153
01:19:41,699 --> 01:19:44,570
you can become much more productive
octave if you move into a richer into a

4154
01:19:44,570 --> 01:19:44,580
octave if you move into a richer into a
 

4155
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:47,209
octave if you move into a richer into a
richer country so so yes there are these

4156
01:19:47,209 --> 01:19:47,219
richer country so so yes there are these
 

4157
01:19:47,219 --> 01:19:49,610
richer country so so yes there are these
issues again uh you're asking me for

4158
01:19:49,610 --> 01:19:49,620
issues again uh you're asking me for
 

4159
01:19:49,620 --> 01:19:51,110
issues again uh you're asking me for
sort of what is it that could really

4160
01:19:51,110 --> 01:19:51,120
sort of what is it that could really
 

4161
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,390
sort of what is it that could really
sort of break down the world I think the

4162
01:19:53,390 --> 01:19:53,400
sort of break down the world I think the
 

4163
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:55,310
sort of break down the world I think the
the fundamental point is to recognize

4164
01:19:55,310 --> 01:19:55,320
the fundamental point is to recognize
 

4165
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:58,189
the fundamental point is to recognize
that it's not like we haven't dealt with

4166
01:19:58,189 --> 01:19:58,199
that it's not like we haven't dealt with
 

4167
01:19:58,199 --> 01:20:01,130
that it's not like we haven't dealt with
huge challenges in the past and we've

4168
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:01,140
huge challenges in the past and we've
 

4169
01:20:01,140 --> 01:20:03,470
huge challenges in the past and we've
dealt with them really well so just one

4170
01:20:03,470 --> 01:20:03,480
dealt with them really well so just one
 

4171
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:05,810
dealt with them really well so just one
fun thing I I encourage everyone to just

4172
01:20:05,810 --> 01:20:05,820
fun thing I I encourage everyone to just
 

4173
01:20:05,820 --> 01:20:08,390
fun thing I I encourage everyone to just
look that up on on Wikipedia the rising

4174
01:20:08,390 --> 01:20:08,400
look that up on on Wikipedia the rising
 

4175
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:09,590
look that up on on Wikipedia the rising
of Chicago

4176
01:20:09,590 --> 01:20:09,600
of Chicago
 

4177
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:13,790
of Chicago
so in the uh in the 1850s Chicago is a

4178
01:20:13,790 --> 01:20:13,800
so in the uh in the 1850s Chicago is a
 

4179
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:16,910
so in the uh in the 1850s Chicago is a
terribly uh uh uh dirty place and they

4180
01:20:16,910 --> 01:20:16,920
terribly uh uh uh dirty place and they
 

4181
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:19,130
terribly uh uh uh dirty place and they
didn't have good sewers and so they

4182
01:20:19,130 --> 01:20:19,140
didn't have good sewers and so they
 

4183
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:21,649
didn't have good sewers and so they
decided and we can't really make up all

4184
01:20:21,649 --> 01:20:21,659
decided and we can't really make up all
 

4185
01:20:21,659 --> 01:20:25,189
decided and we can't really make up all
my they decided to raise Chicago one to

4186
01:20:25,189 --> 01:20:25,199
my they decided to raise Chicago one to
 

4187
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:26,209
my they decided to raise Chicago one to
two feet

4188
01:20:26,209 --> 01:20:26,219
two feet
 

4189
01:20:26,219 --> 01:20:28,669
two feet
and so they simply took one block at a

4190
01:20:28,669 --> 01:20:28,679
and so they simply took one block at a
 

4191
01:20:28,679 --> 01:20:30,470
and so they simply took one block at a
time they put like 50 000 Jacks

4192
01:20:30,470 --> 01:20:30,480
time they put like 50 000 Jacks
 

4193
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:31,970
time they put like 50 000 Jacks
underneath a building and they would

4194
01:20:31,970 --> 01:20:31,980
underneath a building and they would
 

4195
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:33,169
underneath a building and they would
just raise the building and then they'd

4196
01:20:33,169 --> 01:20:33,179
just raise the building and then they'd
 

4197
01:20:33,179 --> 01:20:35,149
just raise the building and then they'd
go on to the next building they race all

4198
01:20:35,149 --> 01:20:35,159
go on to the next building they race all
 

4199
01:20:35,159 --> 01:20:38,209
go on to the next building they race all
of Chicago one or two feet this is you

4200
01:20:38,209 --> 01:20:38,219
of Chicago one or two feet this is you
 

4201
01:20:38,219 --> 01:20:40,550
of Chicago one or two feet this is you
know almost 200 years ago of course we

4202
01:20:40,550 --> 01:20:40,560
know almost 200 years ago of course we
 

4203
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:42,110
know almost 200 years ago of course we
will be able to deal with these things

4204
01:20:42,110 --> 01:20:42,120
will be able to deal with these things
 

4205
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:44,270
will be able to deal with these things
I'm not saying it'd be it'll be fun or

4206
01:20:44,270 --> 01:20:44,280
I'm not saying it'd be it'll be fun or
 

4207
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:46,490
I'm not saying it'd be it'll be fun or
that it'll be cheap of course we would

4208
01:20:46,490 --> 01:20:46,500
that it'll be cheap of course we would
 

4209
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:48,470
that it'll be cheap of course we would
rather not have to deal with this but

4210
01:20:48,470 --> 01:20:48,480
rather not have to deal with this but
 

4211
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:50,630
rather not have to deal with this but
we're a very inventive species and so

4212
01:20:50,630 --> 01:20:50,640
we're a very inventive species and so
 

4213
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:52,850
we're a very inventive species and so
it's very unlikely that we'll not be

4214
01:20:52,850 --> 01:20:52,860
it's very unlikely that we'll not be
 

4215
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:54,189
it's very unlikely that we'll not be
able to what about

4216
01:20:54,189 --> 01:20:54,199
able to what about
 

4217

able to what about
covid pandemic just said hold my beer

4218
01:20:58,130 --> 01:20:58,140
covid pandemic just said hold my beer
 

4219
01:20:58,140 --> 01:21:01,669
covid pandemic just said hold my beer
uh the response of human civilization to

4220
01:21:01,669 --> 01:21:01,679
uh the response of human civilization to
 

4221
01:21:01,679 --> 01:21:03,649
uh the response of human civilization to
the covert pandemic

4222
01:21:03,649 --> 01:21:03,659
the covert pandemic
 

4223
01:21:03,659 --> 01:21:05,570
the covert pandemic
seems to have not

4224
01:21:05,570 --> 01:21:05,580
seems to have not
 

4225
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:09,290
seems to have not

4226
01:21:09,290 --> 01:21:09,300
they didn't find the carjacks yeah she
 

4227
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:11,390
they didn't find the carjacks yeah she
seems to have not been as effective as I

4228
01:21:11,390 --> 01:21:11,400
seems to have not been as effective as I
 

4229
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:16,070
seems to have not been as effective as I
would have hoped uh for uh as a human

4230
01:21:16,070 --> 01:21:16,080
would have hoped uh for uh as a human
 

4231
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:18,169
would have hoped uh for uh as a human
that believes in the in the basic

4232
01:21:18,169 --> 01:21:18,179
that believes in the in the basic
 

4233
01:21:18,179 --> 01:21:20,209
that believes in the in the basic
competence of leadership and all that

4234
01:21:20,209 --> 01:21:20,219
competence of leadership and all that
 

4235
01:21:20,219 --> 01:21:22,370
competence of leadership and all that
kind of stuff it seems like given the

4236
01:21:22,370 --> 01:21:22,380
kind of stuff it seems like given the
 

4237
01:21:22,380 --> 01:21:25,130
kind of stuff it seems like given the
the code pandemic luckily did not turn

4238
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:25,140
the code pandemic luckily did not turn
 

4239
01:21:25,140 --> 01:21:28,370
the code pandemic luckily did not turn
out to be a pandemic that's that would

4240
01:21:28,370 --> 01:21:28,380
out to be a pandemic that's that would
 

4241
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:30,350
out to be a pandemic that's that would
eradicate most of the human species

4242
01:21:30,350 --> 01:21:30,360
eradicate most of the human species
 

4243
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:31,910
eradicate most of the human species
which is something you always have to

4244
01:21:31,910 --> 01:21:31,920
which is something you always have to
 

4245
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:35,090
which is something you always have to
consider and worry about that I would

4246
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:35,100
consider and worry about that I would
 

4247
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:36,890
consider and worry about that I would
have hoped we would have less economic

4248
01:21:36,890 --> 01:21:36,900
have hoped we would have less economic
 

4249
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:38,990
have hoped we would have less economic
impact and we would respond more

4250
01:21:38,990 --> 01:21:39,000
impact and we would respond more
 

4251
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,030
impact and we would respond more
effectively and

4252
01:21:41,030 --> 01:21:41,040
effectively and
 

4253
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:43,189
effectively and
um in terms of policy in terms of

4254
01:21:43,189 --> 01:21:43,199
um in terms of policy in terms of
 

4255
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:45,470
um in terms of policy in terms of
socially medically all that kind of

4256
01:21:45,470 --> 01:21:45,480
socially medically all that kind of
 

4257
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:48,290
socially medically all that kind of
stuff so if the if the cover pandemic

4258
01:21:48,290 --> 01:21:48,300
stuff so if the if the cover pandemic
 

4259
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:50,510
stuff so if the if the cover pandemic
brought the world to its knees then what

4260
01:21:50,510 --> 01:21:50,520
brought the world to its knees then what
 

4261
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:51,590
brought the world to its knees then what
does

4262
01:21:51,590 --> 01:21:51,600
does
 

4263
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:54,590
does
a sea level rise so I think there's a

4264
01:21:54,590 --> 01:21:54,600
a sea level rise so I think there's a
 

4265
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:56,030
a sea level rise so I think there's a
different kind of thing that happened in

4266
01:21:56,030 --> 01:21:56,040
different kind of thing that happened in
 

4267
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:59,090
different kind of thing that happened in
in the in the covet so politicians and a

4268
01:21:59,090 --> 01:21:59,100
in the in the covet so politicians and a
 

4269
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:01,430
in the in the covet so politicians and a
lot of politicians I think made

4270
01:22:01,430 --> 01:22:01,440
lot of politicians I think made
 

4271
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:04,550
lot of politicians I think made
certainly sub-optimal decisions but I

4272
01:22:04,550 --> 01:22:04,560
certainly sub-optimal decisions but I
 

4273
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:06,050
certainly sub-optimal decisions but I
also find the fact that we actually

4274
01:22:06,050 --> 01:22:06,060
also find the fact that we actually
 

4275
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:09,530
also find the fact that we actually
managed to get a vaccine in a year uh we

4276
01:22:09,530 --> 01:22:09,540
managed to get a vaccine in a year uh we
 

4277
01:22:09,540 --> 01:22:11,149
managed to get a vaccine in a year uh we
should not be uh you know sort of

4278
01:22:11,149 --> 01:22:11,159
should not be uh you know sort of
 

4279
01:22:11,159 --> 01:22:13,310
should not be uh you know sort of
unaware of the fact that yes we did a

4280
01:22:13,310 --> 01:22:13,320
unaware of the fact that yes we did a
 

4281
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:14,689
unaware of the fact that yes we did a
lot of stupid stuff and a lot of people

4282
01:22:14,689 --> 01:22:14,699
lot of stupid stuff and a lot of people
 

4283
01:22:14,699 --> 01:22:16,189
lot of stupid stuff and a lot of people
were really really annoyed but

4284
01:22:16,189 --> 01:22:16,199
were really really annoyed but
 

4285
01:22:16,199 --> 01:22:18,830
were really really annoyed but
fundamentally we fixed this uh we could

4286
01:22:18,830 --> 01:22:18,840
fundamentally we fixed this uh we could
 

4287
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:21,050
fundamentally we fixed this uh we could
have done it better and pretty I mean I

4288
01:22:21,050 --> 01:22:21,060
have done it better and pretty I mean I
 

4289
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:24,110
have done it better and pretty I mean I
I uh rode through uh the covet pandemic

4290
01:22:24,110 --> 01:22:24,120
I uh rode through uh the covet pandemic
 

4291
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:28,370
I uh rode through uh the covet pandemic
in southern Sweden uh so uh and uh yes

4292
01:22:28,370 --> 01:22:28,380
in southern Sweden uh so uh and uh yes
 

4293
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:29,990
in southern Sweden uh so uh and uh yes
we we can have that whole conversation

4294
01:22:29,990 --> 01:22:30,000
we we can have that whole conversation
 

4295
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,689
we we can have that whole conversation
it was certainly a much easier to live

4296
01:22:32,689 --> 01:22:32,699
it was certainly a much easier to live
 

4297
01:22:32,699 --> 01:22:34,790
it was certainly a much easier to live
there than than many other places but

4298
01:22:34,790 --> 01:22:34,800
there than than many other places but
 

4299
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,950
there than than many other places but
the fundamental point was we actually

4300
01:22:36,950 --> 01:22:36,960
the fundamental point was we actually
 

4301
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:39,110
the fundamental point was we actually
fixed it so yes we'll do and we'll do

4302
01:22:39,110 --> 01:22:39,120
fixed it so yes we'll do and we'll do
 

4303
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,270
fixed it so yes we'll do and we'll do
that with climate we'll make a lot of

4304
01:22:41,270 --> 01:22:41,280
that with climate we'll make a lot of
 

4305
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,010
that with climate we'll make a lot of
bad decisions and we'll waste a lot of

4306
01:22:43,010 --> 01:22:43,020
bad decisions and we'll waste a lot of
 

4307
01:22:43,020 --> 01:22:45,169
bad decisions and we'll waste a lot of
money like we do with all other problems

4308
01:22:45,169 --> 01:22:45,179
money like we do with all other problems
 

4309
01:22:45,179 --> 01:22:48,350
money like we do with all other problems
but it's are we going to fix this yeah

4310
01:22:48,350 --> 01:22:48,360
but it's are we going to fix this yeah
 

4311
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:51,110
but it's are we going to fix this yeah
can you add on to that uncomfortable

4312
01:22:51,110 --> 01:22:51,120
can you add on to that uncomfortable
 

4313
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:52,970
can you add on to that uncomfortable
discussion of what's the worst thing

4314
01:22:52,970 --> 01:22:52,980
discussion of what's the worst thing
 

4315
01:22:52,980 --> 01:22:54,530
discussion of what's the worst thing
that could possibly happen I'm not

4316
01:22:54,530 --> 01:22:54,540
that could possibly happen I'm not
 

4317
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:56,149
that could possibly happen I'm not
worried about the sea level rise

4318
01:22:56,149 --> 01:22:56,159
worried about the sea level rise
 

4319
01:22:56,159 --> 01:22:58,130
worried about the sea level rise
component certainly not nearly as much

4320
01:22:58,130 --> 01:22:58,140
component certainly not nearly as much
 

4321
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:00,169
component certainly not nearly as much
as the Heat and disruption of

Agriculture patterns and water supplies
 

4325
01:23:02,940 --> 01:23:04,910
Agriculture patterns and water supplies
and a lot of it relates to

4326
01:23:04,910 --> 01:23:04,920
and a lot of it relates to
 

4327
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:07,790
and a lot of it relates to
again path dependency and history

4328
01:23:07,790 --> 01:23:07,800
again path dependency and history
 

4329
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:10,790
again path dependency and history
farmers are the heroes of humanity all

4330
01:23:10,790 --> 01:23:10,800
farmers are the heroes of humanity all
 

4331
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:12,110
farmers are the heroes of humanity all
through history because they're

4332
01:23:12,110 --> 01:23:12,120
through history because they're
 

4333
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:13,810
through history because they're
incredibly adaptable

01:23:13,810 --> 01:23:13,820
incredibly adaptable
 

4335
01:23:13,820 --> 01:23:17,990
incredibly adaptable
if you give them access to resources uh

4336
01:23:17,990 --> 01:23:18,000
if you give them access to resources uh
 

4337
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,290
if you give them access to resources uh
in some cases it's just crop insurance

4338
01:23:20,290 --> 01:23:20,300
in some cases it's just crop insurance
 

4339
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:22,850
in some cases it's just crop insurance
which is really basically still

4340
01:23:22,850 --> 01:23:22,860
which is really basically still
 

4341
01:23:22,860 --> 01:23:24,169
which is really basically still
impossible to get in big chunks of

Africa to get you through those hard
 

4345
01:23:25,980 --> 01:23:28,370
Africa to get you through those hard
spots but but the heat issue is the one

4346
01:23:28,370 --> 01:23:28,380
spots but but the heat issue is the one
 

4347
01:23:28,380 --> 01:23:31,550
spots but but the heat issue is the one
that's most this most base basic element

4348
01:23:31,550 --> 01:23:31,560
that's most this most base basic element
 

4349
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:33,790
that's most this most base basic element
related to global warming from CO2

4350
01:23:33,790 --> 01:23:33,800
related to global warming from CO2
 

4351
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:38,450
related to global warming from CO2
buildup is uh hotter heat waves there's

4352
01:23:38,450 --> 01:23:38,460
buildup is uh hotter heat waves there's
 

4353
01:23:38,460 --> 01:23:41,209
buildup is uh hotter heat waves there's
still some lack of evidence of

4354
01:23:41,209 --> 01:23:41,219
still some lack of evidence of
 

4355
01:23:41,219 --> 01:23:44,990
still some lack of evidence of
the intensification but the duration and

4356
01:23:44,990 --> 01:23:45,000
the intensification but the duration and
 

4357
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,750
the intensification but the duration and
and that's really matters for heat is

4358
01:23:47,750 --> 01:23:47,760
and that's really matters for heat is
 

4359
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:49,490
and that's really matters for heat is
how many days

4360
01:23:49,490 --> 01:23:49,500
how many days
 

4361
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:51,290
how many days
seems to be very powerfully linked to

4362
01:23:51,290 --> 01:23:51,300
seems to be very powerfully linked to
 

4363
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:53,750
seems to be very powerfully linked to
global warming and uh so how many people

4364
01:23:53,750 --> 01:23:53,760
global warming and uh so how many people
 

4365
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:56,090
global warming and uh so how many people
die as a result of that is important so

4366
01:23:56,090 --> 01:23:56,100
die as a result of that is important so
 

4367
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:58,430
die as a result of that is important so
we're talking about

4368
01:23:58,430 --> 01:23:58,440
we're talking about
 

4369
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:00,770
we're talking about
maybe you can also educate me what's the

4370
01:24:00,770 --> 01:24:00,780
maybe you can also educate me what's the
 

4371
01:24:00,780 --> 01:24:02,930
maybe you can also educate me what's the
average projection for the next

4372
01:24:02,930 --> 01:24:02,940
average projection for the next
 

4373
01:24:02,940 --> 01:24:05,450
average projection for the next

all of those are bad for this is an

all of those are bad for this is an

educational question sure it uh doesn't
 

4409
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:45,410

01:29:52,380 --> 01:29:55,850
so that that divide and capacity to deal
with environmental stress is something

4692
01:29:55,850 --> 01:29:55,860
with environmental stress is something
 

4693
01:29:55,860 --> 01:29:57,830
with environmental stress is something
you can really work on and it gets

4694
01:29:57,830 --> 01:29:57,840
you can really work on and it gets
 

4695
01:29:57,840 --> 01:29:58,669
you can really work on and it gets
hidden

4696
01:29:58,669 --> 01:29:58,679
hidden
 

4697
01:29:58,679 --> 01:30:00,410
hidden
in all this talk of climate crisis

4698
01:30:00,410 --> 01:30:00,420
in all this talk of climate crisis
 

4699
01:30:00,420 --> 01:30:02,390
in all this talk of climate crisis
people and and that that's one of the

4700
01:30:02,390 --> 01:30:02,400
people and and that that's one of the
 

4701
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:04,850
people and and that that's one of the
important parts is is both to say look

4702
01:30:04,850 --> 01:30:04,860
important parts is is both to say look
 

4703
01:30:04,860 --> 01:30:08,209
important parts is is both to say look
if seven billion people sorry eight

4704
01:30:08,209 --> 01:30:08,219
if seven billion people sorry eight
 

4705
01:30:08,219 --> 01:30:10,550
if seven billion people sorry eight
billion people will now have all

4706
01:30:10,550 --> 01:30:10,560
billion people will now have all
 

4707
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:12,770
billion people will now have all
experienced this even though for each

4708
01:30:12,770 --> 01:30:12,780
experienced this even though for each
 

4709
01:30:12,780 --> 01:30:14,810
experienced this even though for each
one of them it's manageable it's still a

4710
01:30:14,810 --> 01:30:14,820
one of them it's manageable it's still a
 

4711
01:30:14,820 --> 01:30:16,729
one of them it's manageable it's still a
big problem because it's you know eight

4712
01:30:16,729 --> 01:30:16,739
big problem because it's you know eight
 

4713
01:30:16,739 --> 01:30:18,470
big problem because it's you know eight
billion people living through this and

4714
01:30:18,470 --> 01:30:18,480
billion people living through this and
 

4715
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:19,850
billion people living through this and
the second condition eight billion yes

4716
01:30:19,850 --> 01:30:19,860
the second condition eight billion yes
 

4717
01:30:19,860 --> 01:30:22,490
the second condition eight billion yes
and and then it's uh it's the it's the

4718
01:30:22,490 --> 01:30:22,500
and and then it's uh it's the it's the
 

4719
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:25,070
and and then it's uh it's the it's the
point of getting to realize it's very

4720
01:30:25,070 --> 01:30:25,080
point of getting to realize it's very
 

4721
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:26,990
point of getting to realize it's very
very much about how do you help the

4722
01:30:26,990 --> 01:30:27,000
very much about how do you help the
 

4723
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,209
very much about how do you help the
world's poor and that's very much about

4724
01:30:29,209 --> 01:30:29,219
world's poor and that's very much about
 

4725
01:30:29,219 --> 01:30:31,550
world's poor and that's very much about
making it more affordable uh yeah

4726
01:30:31,550 --> 01:30:31,560
making it more affordable uh yeah
 

4727
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:33,470
making it more affordable uh yeah
basically getting them out of poverty

4728
01:30:33,470 --> 01:30:33,480
basically getting them out of poverty
 

4729
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:35,149
basically getting them out of poverty
and remember getting out of poverty

4730
01:30:35,149 --> 01:30:35,159
and remember getting out of poverty
 

4731
01:30:35,159 --> 01:30:36,410
and remember getting out of poverty
doesn't just mean that they can now

4732
01:30:36,410 --> 01:30:36,420
doesn't just mean that they can now
 

4733
01:30:36,420 --> 01:30:38,149
doesn't just mean that they can now
afford to air condition themselves but

4734
01:30:38,149 --> 01:30:38,159
afford to air condition themselves but
 

4735
01:30:38,159 --> 01:30:39,709
afford to air condition themselves but
they get better they get better

4736
01:30:39,709 --> 01:30:39,719
they get better they get better
 

4737
01:30:39,719 --> 01:30:41,990
they get better they get better
education they get better opportunities

4738
01:30:41,990 --> 01:30:42,000
education they get better opportunities
 

4739
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,790
education they get better opportunities
they get you know better lives in so

4740
01:30:43,790 --> 01:30:43,800
they get you know better lives in so
 

4741
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:46,790
they get you know better lives in so
many other ways and then at the end of

4742
01:30:46,790 --> 01:30:46,800
many other ways and then at the end of
 

4743
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:49,370
many other ways and then at the end of
it it is it's not just about making sure

4744
01:30:49,370 --> 01:30:49,380
it it is it's not just about making sure
 

4745
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:51,770
it it is it's not just about making sure
that we focus on this one problem but

4746
01:30:51,770 --> 01:30:51,780
that we focus on this one problem but
 

4747
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:53,870
that we focus on this one problem but
it's recognizing that these families and

4748
01:30:53,870 --> 01:30:53,880
it's recognizing that these families and
 

4749
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:56,270
it's recognizing that these families and
and have have lots of different issues

4750
01:30:56,270 --> 01:30:56,280
and have have lots of different issues
 

4751
01:30:56,280 --> 01:30:58,129
and have have lots of different issues
that they would like us to focus on

4752
01:30:58,129 --> 01:30:58,139
that they would like us to focus on
 

4753
01:30:58,139 --> 01:31:00,770
that they would like us to focus on
climb climate and heat waves just being

4754
01:31:00,770 --> 01:31:00,780
climb climate and heat waves just being
 

4755
01:31:00,780 --> 01:31:02,810
climb climate and heat waves just being
one of them so you know it's sort of

4756
01:31:02,810 --> 01:31:02,820
one of them so you know it's sort of
 

4757
01:31:02,820 --> 01:31:04,490
one of them so you know it's sort of
taking Progressive steps back and

4758
01:31:04,490 --> 01:31:04,500
taking Progressive steps back and
 

4759
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:06,410
taking Progressive steps back and
realizing all right okay this is a

4760
01:31:06,410 --> 01:31:06,420
realizing all right okay this is a
 

4761
01:31:06,420 --> 01:31:07,250
realizing all right okay this is a
problem

4762
01:31:07,250 --> 01:31:07,260
problem
 

4763
01:31:07,260 --> 01:31:09,050
problem
not the end of the world and one tiny

Jakarta at the beginning
 

4769
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:13,729
Jakarta at the beginning
it's really valuable to look around the

4770
01:31:13,729 --> 01:31:13,739
it's really valuable to look around the
 

4771
01:31:13,739 --> 01:31:15,110
it's really valuable to look around the
world at places that are sort of leading

4772
01:31:15,110 --> 01:31:15,120
world at places that are sort of leading
 

4773
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:16,490
world at places that are sort of leading
indicator places

4774
01:31:16,490 --> 01:31:16,500
indicator places
 

4775
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:18,890
indicator places
whether it's sea level rise or heat and

4776
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:18,900
whether it's sea level rise or heat and
 

4777
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:21,610
whether it's sea level rise or heat and
you could do that Jakarta is sinking

4778
01:31:21,610 --> 01:31:21,620
you could do that Jakarta is sinking
 

4779
01:31:21,620 --> 01:31:24,890
you could do that Jakarta is sinking

I'm a musicians and and Jakarta so what

4794
01:31:40,490 --> 01:31:40,500
I'm a musicians and and Jakarta so what
 

4795
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:41,330
I'm a musicians and and Jakarta so what
are they doing they're moving they're

4796
01:31:41,330 --> 01:31:41,340
are they doing they're moving they're
 

4797
01:31:41,340 --> 01:31:44,830
are they doing they're moving they're
moving the capital to uh another uh area

4798

moving the capital to uh another uh area
 

4799
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:47,570
moving the capital to uh another uh area
and so that says to me

4800
01:31:47,570 --> 01:31:47,580
and so that says to me
 

4801
01:31:47,580 --> 01:31:49,610
and so that says to me
there's a lot of plasticity too it's

4802
01:31:49,610 --> 01:31:49,620
there's a lot of plasticity too it's

there's a lot of plasticity too it's
it's a city that's going through this

4804
01:31:51,470 --> 01:31:51,480
it's a city that's going through this
 

4805
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:53,450
it's a city that's going through this
that rate of sea level

01:31:57,830 --> 01:31:57,840
through syncing is way faster than
 

4811
01:31:57,840 --> 01:31:59,450
through syncing is way faster than
what's happening with global warming so

4812
01:31:59,450 --> 01:31:59,460
what's happening with global warming so
 

4813
01:31:59,460 --> 01:32:00,830
what's happening with global warming so
look there look to those kinds of places

4814
01:32:00,830 --> 01:32:00,840
look there look to those kinds of places
 

4815
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:03,950
look there look to those kinds of places
and you can start to build a Tokyo had

4816
01:32:03,950 --> 01:32:03,960
and you can start to build a Tokyo had
 

4817
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:05,870
and you can start to build a Tokyo had
the same thing in the 1930s so we're

4818
01:32:05,870 --> 01:32:05,880
the same thing in the 1930s so we're
 

4819
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:08,390
the same thing in the 1930s so we're
also withdrawing a lot of water way too

4820
01:32:08,390 --> 01:32:08,400
also withdrawing a lot of water way too
 

4821
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:10,490
also withdrawing a lot of water way too
fast uh and and so you know one of the

4822
01:32:10,490 --> 01:32:10,500
fast uh and and so you know one of the
 

4823
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:12,110
fast uh and and so you know one of the
obvious things is maybe you should stop

4824
01:32:12,110 --> 01:32:12,120
obvious things is maybe you should stop
 

4825
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:14,390
obvious things is maybe you should stop
withdrawing water so fast you know and

4826
01:32:14,390 --> 01:32:14,400
withdrawing water so fast you know and
 

4827
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:17,030
withdrawing water so fast you know and
and again we seem to almost be intent on

4828
01:32:17,030 --> 01:32:17,040
and again we seem to almost be intent on
 

4829
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:19,610
and again we seem to almost be intent on
finding the most politically correct way

4830
01:32:19,610 --> 01:32:19,620
finding the most politically correct way
 

4831
01:32:19,620 --> 01:32:21,950
finding the most politically correct way
to fix a problem or you know the most

4832
01:32:21,950 --> 01:32:21,960
to fix a problem or you know the most
 

4833
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:24,050
to fix a problem or you know the most
the thing that sort of gets the most

4834
01:32:24,050 --> 01:32:24,060
the thing that sort of gets the most
 

4835
01:32:24,060 --> 01:32:25,729
the thing that sort of gets the most
clicks instead of the thing that

4836
01:32:25,729 --> 01:32:25,739
clicks instead of the thing that
 

4837
01:32:25,739 --> 01:32:28,430
clicks instead of the thing that
actually works the best uh so a lot of

4838
01:32:28,430 --> 01:32:28,440
actually works the best uh so a lot of
 

4839
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:29,990
actually works the best uh so a lot of
these things are really you know not

4840
01:32:29,990 --> 01:32:30,000
these things are really you know not
 

4841
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,910
these things are really you know not

there let me add one more on on top of

4844
01:32:34,490 --> 01:32:34,500
there let me add one more on on top of
 

4845
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:36,649
there let me add one more on on top of

of storms still you didn't quite answer
 

5167
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,810
of storms still you didn't quite answer
okay the question

5168
01:38:26,810 --> 01:38:26,820
okay the question
 

5169
01:38:26,820 --> 01:38:29,209
okay the question
uh you know when I'm having a beer with

5170
01:38:29,209 --> 01:38:29,219
uh you know when I'm having a beer with
 

5171
01:38:29,219 --> 01:38:31,490
uh you know when I'm having a beer with
people at a bar and they say hey why are

5172
01:38:31,490 --> 01:38:31,500
people at a bar and they say hey why are
 

5173
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:33,410
people at a bar and they say hey why are
you having a beer we're all going to die

5174
01:38:33,410 --> 01:38:33,420
you having a beer we're all going to die
 

5175
01:38:33,420 --> 01:38:35,270
you having a beer we're all going to die
because of climate change usually what

5176
01:38:35,270 --> 01:38:35,280
because of climate change usually what
 

5177
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:36,470
because of climate change usually what
they bring up

5178
01:38:36,470 --> 01:38:36,480
they bring up
 

5179
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:38,270
they bring up
uh and I'm just trying to add some

5180
01:38:38,270 --> 01:38:38,280
uh and I'm just trying to add some
 

5181
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:41,270
uh and I'm just trying to add some
leaves no this is good usually what they

5182
01:38:41,270 --> 01:38:41,280
leaves no this is good usually what they
 

5183
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:43,729
leaves no this is good usually what they
bring up is you know the hurricanes and

5184
01:38:43,729 --> 01:38:43,739
bring up is you know the hurricanes and
 

5185
01:38:43,739 --> 01:38:46,189
bring up is you know the hurricanes and
the most recent hurricanes saying like

5186
01:38:46,189 --> 01:38:46,199
the most recent hurricanes saying like
 

5187
01:38:46,199 --> 01:38:49,129
the most recent hurricanes saying like
this they're getting crazy hurricanes

5188
01:38:49,129 --> 01:38:49,139
this they're getting crazy hurricanes
 

5189
01:38:49,139 --> 01:38:51,110
this they're getting crazy hurricanes
all the time they're getting more

5190
01:38:51,110 --> 01:38:51,120
all the time they're getting more
 

5191
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:54,709
all the time they're getting more
intense more frequent and so on as is

5192
01:38:54,709 --> 01:38:54,719
intense more frequent and so on as is
 

5193
01:38:54,719 --> 01:38:57,530
intense more frequent and so on as is
there I'm sure there's incredible signs

5194
01:38:57,530 --> 01:38:57,540
there I'm sure there's incredible signs
 

5195
01:38:57,540 --> 01:39:00,169
there I'm sure there's incredible signs
going on trying to look at this uh is

5196
01:39:00,169 --> 01:39:00,179
going on trying to look at this uh is
 

5197
01:39:00,179 --> 01:39:02,390
going on trying to look at this uh is
there is it possible is there evidence

5198
01:39:02,390 --> 01:39:02,400
there is it possible is there evidence
 

5199
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:04,550
there is it possible is there evidence
and is it possible to have evidence that

5200
01:39:04,550 --> 01:39:04,560
and is it possible to have evidence that
 

5201
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:05,890
and is it possible to have evidence that
there's a connection

5202
01:39:05,890 --> 01:39:05,900
there's a connection
 

5203
01:39:05,900 --> 01:39:09,590
there's a connection
between what would we can call Global

5204
01:39:09,590 --> 01:39:09,600
between what would we can call Global
 

5205
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:11,870
between what would we can call Global
Warming and the increased frequency and

5206
01:39:11,870 --> 01:39:11,880
Warming and the increased frequency and
 

5207
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:14,870
Warming and the increased frequency and
intensity of Storms and is okay no thank

5208
01:39:14,870 --> 01:39:14,880
intensity of Storms and is okay no thank
 

5209
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:16,970
intensity of Storms and is okay no thank
you

5210
01:39:16,970 --> 01:39:16,980
you
 

5211
01:39:16,980 --> 01:39:19,729
you
if you're out of intensity you know it's

5212
01:39:19,729 --> 01:39:19,739
if you're out of intensity you know it's
 

5213
01:39:19,739 --> 01:39:22,010
if you're out of intensity you know it's
it's let me just get into this a tiny

5214
01:39:22,010 --> 01:39:22,020
it's let me just get into this a tiny
 

5215
01:39:22,020 --> 01:39:23,810
it's let me just get into this a tiny
bit more I mean hurricanes

5216
01:39:23,810 --> 01:39:23,820
bit more I mean hurricanes
 

5217
01:39:23,820 --> 01:39:25,490
bit more I mean hurricanes
I grew up with them in Rhode Island in

5218
01:39:25,490 --> 01:39:25,500
I grew up with them in Rhode Island in
 

5219
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:27,050
I grew up with them in Rhode Island in
the new and you know in my youth and

5220
01:39:27,050 --> 01:39:27,060
the new and you know in my youth and
 

5221
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:28,250
the new and you know in my youth and
there was a very active period of

5222
01:39:28,250 --> 01:39:28,260
there was a very active period of
 

5223
01:39:28,260 --> 01:39:30,290
there was a very active period of
hurricanes in New England

5224
01:39:30,290 --> 01:39:30,300
hurricanes in New England
 

5225
01:39:30,300 --> 01:39:32,689
hurricanes in New England
in the 50s and 60s 70s

5226
01:39:32,689 --> 01:39:32,699
in the 50s and 60s 70s
 

5227
01:39:32,699 --> 01:39:35,390
in the 50s and 60s 70s
and then in the North Atlantic generally

5228
01:39:35,390 --> 01:39:35,400
and then in the North Atlantic generally
 

5229
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:38,330
and then in the North Atlantic generally
was very very active the number 50 when

5230
01:39:38,330 --> 01:39:38,340
was very very active the number 50 when
 

5231
01:39:38,340 --> 01:39:40,370
was very very active the number 50 when
I was a kid and

5232
01:39:40,370 --> 01:39:40,380
I was a kid and
 

5233
01:39:40,380 --> 01:39:42,410
I was a kid and

5237
01:39:44,820 --> 01:39:47,090
Africa and coming here circling up the

01:39:47,090 --> 01:39:47,100
coast was just prime time
 

5239
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:49,310

then there was like what Kerry Emanuel

5240
01:39:49,310 --> 01:39:49,320
then there was like what Kerry Emanuel
 

5241
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:52,070
then there was like what Kerry Emanuel
who's the most experienced hurricane

he and colleagues have found and others
that

5252
01:40:05,570 --> 01:40:05,580
that
 

5253
01:40:05,580 --> 01:40:06,590
that
there's what they call the hurricane

5254
01:40:06,590 --> 01:40:06,600
there's what they call the hurricane
 

5255
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:09,610
there's what they call the hurricane
drought from like the 70s through about

5256
01:40:09,610 --> 01:40:09,620
drought from like the 70s through about
 

5257
01:40:09,620 --> 01:40:12,050
drought from like the 70s through about
1994. in the Atlantic specifically the

5258
01:40:12,050 --> 01:40:12,060
1994. in the Atlantic specifically the
 

5259
01:40:12,060 --> 01:40:13,310
1994. in the Atlantic specifically the
Atlantic basin

5260

Atlantic basin
 

5261
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:15,169
Atlantic basin
and there's been a lot of questions

5262
01:40:15,169 --> 01:40:15,179
and there's been a lot of questions
 

5263
01:40:15,179 --> 01:40:16,610
and there's been a lot of questions
about that people thought it was ocean

5264
01:40:16,610 --> 01:40:16,620
about that people thought it was ocean
 

5265
01:40:16,620 --> 01:40:18,530
about that people thought it was ocean
circulation something about the currents

5266
01:40:18,530 --> 01:40:18,540
circulation something about the currents
 

5267
01:40:18,540 --> 01:40:20,990
circulation something about the currents
do these multi-decatal

5268
01:40:20,990 --> 01:40:21,000
do these multi-decatal
 

5269
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,629
do these multi-decatal
variabilities in the oceans right

5270
01:40:23,629 --> 01:40:23,639
variabilities in the oceans right
 

5271
01:40:23,639 --> 01:40:27,709
variabilities in the oceans right
and then now it looks robustly I can't

5272
01:40:27,709 --> 01:40:27,719
and then now it looks robustly I can't
 

5273
01:40:27,719 --> 01:40:30,169
and then now it looks robustly I can't
find a climate scientist who disagrees

5274
01:40:30,169 --> 01:40:30,179
find a climate scientist who disagrees
 

5275
01:40:30,179 --> 01:40:32,530
find a climate scientist who disagrees
that the thing that caused the drought

5276
01:40:32,530 --> 01:40:32,540
that the thing that caused the drought
 

5277
01:40:32,540 --> 01:40:35,990
that the thing that caused the drought
was pollution smog

5278
01:40:35,990 --> 01:40:36,000
was pollution smog
 

5279
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,570
was pollution smog
and significantly in Europe and you

5280
01:40:38,570 --> 01:40:38,580
and significantly in Europe and you
 

5281
01:40:38,580 --> 01:40:40,430
and significantly in Europe and you
think well how did smog in Europe relate

5282
01:40:40,430 --> 01:40:40,440
think well how did smog in Europe relate
 

5283
01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:41,930
think well how did smog in Europe relate
to hurricanes

5284
01:40:41,930 --> 01:40:41,940
to hurricanes
 

5285
01:40:41,940 --> 01:40:44,330
to hurricanes
crossing the Atlantic and getting to

5286
01:40:44,330 --> 01:40:44,340
crossing the Atlantic and getting to
 

5287
01:40:44,340 --> 01:40:47,149
crossing the Atlantic and getting to
the United States it's because of the

5288
01:40:47,149 --> 01:40:47,159
the United States it's because of the
 

5289
01:40:47,159 --> 01:40:50,030
the United States it's because of the
smog was changing the behavior of the

5290
01:40:50,030 --> 01:40:50,040
smog was changing the behavior of the
 

5291
01:40:50,040 --> 01:40:51,890
smog was changing the behavior of the
Sahara Desert which is just south of

5292
01:40:51,890 --> 01:40:51,900
Sahara Desert which is just south of
 

5293
01:40:51,900 --> 01:40:52,970
Sahara Desert which is just south of
Europe

5294
01:40:52,970 --> 01:40:52,980
Europe
 

5295
01:40:52,980 --> 01:40:55,729
Europe
and and the Sarah Harrah does it kills

5296
01:40:55,729 --> 01:40:55,739
and and the Sarah Harrah does it kills
 

5297
01:40:55,739 --> 01:40:58,189
and and the Sarah Harrah does it kills
hurricanes sand and dust coming off the

5298
01:40:58,189 --> 01:40:58,199
hurricanes sand and dust coming off the
 

5299
01:40:58,199 --> 01:41:00,050
hurricanes sand and dust coming off the
Sahara you can see this every year and

5300
01:41:00,050 --> 01:41:00,060
Sahara you can see this every year and
 

5301
01:41:00,060 --> 01:41:01,430
Sahara you can see this every year and
when that's active

5302
01:41:01,430 --> 01:41:01,440
when that's active
 

5303
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:04,070
when that's active
it stifles these big storms at the point

5304
01:41:04,070 --> 01:41:04,080
it stifles these big storms at the point
 

5305
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:05,689
it stifles these big storms at the point
right in their Nursery they all form

5306
01:41:05,689 --> 01:41:05,699
right in their Nursery they all form
 

5307
01:41:05,699 --> 01:41:07,850
right in their Nursery they all form
there's this area for hurricanes off of

5308
01:41:07,850 --> 01:41:07,860
there's this area for hurricanes off of
 

5309
01:41:07,860 --> 01:41:10,370
there's this area for hurricanes off of
West Africa that's like the nursery Zone

5310
01:41:10,370 --> 01:41:10,380
West Africa that's like the nursery Zone
 

5311
01:41:10,380 --> 01:41:11,870
West Africa that's like the nursery Zone
and so if you're stifling those

5312
01:41:11,870 --> 01:41:11,880
and so if you're stifling those
 

5313
01:41:11,880 --> 01:41:14,450
and so if you're stifling those
hurricanes because of pollution in in

5314
01:41:14,450 --> 01:41:14,460
hurricanes because of pollution in in
 

5315
01:41:14,460 --> 01:41:17,689
hurricanes because of pollution in in
Europe before the Clean Air acts kind of

5316
01:41:17,689 --> 01:41:17,699
Europe before the Clean Air acts kind of
 

5317
01:41:17,699 --> 01:41:20,810
Europe before the Clean Air acts kind of
you know cleanups and then that goes

5318
01:41:20,810 --> 01:41:20,820
you know cleanups and then that goes
 

5319
01:41:20,820 --> 01:41:21,590
you know cleanups and then that goes
away

5320
01:41:21,590 --> 01:41:21,600
away
 

5321
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:22,910
away
none of that has anything to do with

5322
01:41:22,910 --> 01:41:22,920
none of that has anything to do with
 

5323

the darts are getting bigger because of
 

5483
01:44:15,540 --> 01:44:16,790
the darts are getting bigger because of
global warming some of the darts we

5484
01:44:16,790 --> 01:44:16,800
global warming some of the darts we
 

5485
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:17,570
global warming some of the darts we
don't know

5486
01:44:17,570 --> 01:44:17,580
don't know
 

5487
01:44:17,580 --> 01:44:19,850
don't know
what do you do like what do you do well

5488
01:44:19,850 --> 01:44:19,860
what do you do like what do you do well
 

5489
01:44:19,860 --> 01:44:21,649
what do you do like what do you do well
you get out of the way right you don't

5490
01:44:21,649 --> 01:44:21,659
you get out of the way right you don't
 

5491
01:44:21,659 --> 01:44:23,689
you get out of the way right you don't
want to be on the dartboard and that it

5492
01:44:23,689 --> 01:44:23,699
want to be on the dartboard and that it
 

5493
01:44:23,699 --> 01:44:26,290
want to be on the dartboard and that it
just simplifies the whole formula

5494
01:44:26,290 --> 01:44:26,300
just simplifies the whole formula
 

5495
01:44:26,300 --> 01:44:28,669
just simplifies the whole formula
to me it was it's kind of a

5496
01:44:28,669 --> 01:44:28,679
to me it was it's kind of a
 

5497
01:44:28,679 --> 01:44:30,050
to me it was it's kind of a
transformational

5498
01:44:30,050 --> 01:44:30,060
transformational
 

5499
01:44:30,060 --> 01:44:32,510
transformational
uh potential

5500
01:44:32,510 --> 01:44:32,520
uh potential
 

5501
01:44:32,520 --> 01:44:34,370
uh potential
to go into a bar maybe I should print

5502
01:44:34,370 --> 01:44:34,380
to go into a bar maybe I should print
 

5503
01:44:34,380 --> 01:44:37,189
to go into a bar maybe I should print
these things 100 and I should go ahead

5504
01:44:37,189 --> 01:44:37,199
these things 100 and I should go ahead
 

5505
01:44:37,199 --> 01:44:38,270
these things 100 and I should go ahead
with you more often they should be

5506
01:44:38,270 --> 01:44:38,280
with you more often they should be
 

5507
01:44:38,280 --> 01:44:39,890
with you more often they should be
coasters and bars because that was

5508
01:44:39,890 --> 01:44:39,900
coasters and bars because that was
 

5509
01:44:39,900 --> 01:44:41,990
coasters and bars because that was
fascinating about Smog and I mean it's

5510
01:44:41,990 --> 01:44:42,000
fascinating about Smog and I mean it's
 

5511
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,270
fascinating about Smog and I mean it's
just it's nice to be reminded about how

5512
01:44:44,270 --> 01:44:44,280
just it's nice to be reminded about how
 

5513
01:44:44,280 --> 01:44:45,590
just it's nice to be reminded about how
complicated and fascinating the weather

5514
01:44:45,590 --> 01:44:45,600
complicated and fascinating the weather
 

5515
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:48,169
complicated and fascinating the weather
system is let me try to answer the the

5516
01:44:48,169 --> 01:44:48,179
system is let me try to answer the the
 

5517
01:44:48,179 --> 01:44:50,870
system is let me try to answer the the
the questions slightly quicker before

5518
01:44:50,870 --> 01:44:50,880
the questions slightly quicker before
 

5519
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:53,750
the questions slightly quicker before
your your friends have drunk too much uh

5520
01:44:53,750 --> 01:44:53,760
your your friends have drunk too much uh
 

5521
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:55,090
your your friends have drunk too much uh
but never enough

5522
01:44:55,090 --> 01:44:55,100
but never enough
 

5523
01:44:55,100 --> 01:44:57,410
but never enough
or not enough

5524
01:44:57,410 --> 01:44:57,420
or not enough
 

5525
01:44:57,420 --> 01:45:01,370
or not enough
um so if you look at the amount of uh of

5526
01:45:01,370 --> 01:45:01,380
um so if you look at the amount of uh of
 

5527
01:45:01,380 --> 01:45:03,830
um so if you look at the amount of uh of
uh the number of hurricanes as uh as

5528
01:45:03,830 --> 01:45:03,840
uh the number of hurricanes as uh as
 

5529
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:06,169
uh the number of hurricanes as uh as
Andy brightly pointed out

5530
01:45:06,169 --> 01:45:06,179
Andy brightly pointed out
 

5531
01:45:06,179 --> 01:45:08,990
Andy brightly pointed out
um it doesn't look like it's changing so

5532
01:45:08,990 --> 01:45:09,000
um it doesn't look like it's changing so
 

5533
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,570
um it doesn't look like it's changing so
we see more because we have now much

5534
01:45:11,570 --> 01:45:11,580
we see more because we have now much
 

5535
01:45:11,580 --> 01:45:13,850
we see more because we have now much
better detection systems with satellites

5536
01:45:13,850 --> 01:45:13,860
better detection systems with satellites
 

5537
01:45:13,860 --> 01:45:16,629
better detection systems with satellites
but if you look since uh

5538
01:45:16,629 --> 01:45:16,639
but if you look since uh
 

5539
01:45:16,639 --> 01:45:19,250
but if you look since uh
1980 when we have good satellite

5540
01:45:19,250 --> 01:45:19,260
1980 when we have good satellite
 

5541
01:45:19,260 --> 01:45:21,530
1980 when we have good satellite
coverage for instance last year

5542
01:45:21,530 --> 01:45:21,540
coverage for instance last year
 

5543
01:45:21,540 --> 01:45:23,810
coverage for instance last year
was the year that had the lowest number

5544
01:45:23,810 --> 01:45:23,820
was the year that had the lowest number
 

5545
01:45:23,820 --> 01:45:25,790
was the year that had the lowest number
of hurricanes in the world

5546
01:45:25,790 --> 01:45:25,800
of hurricanes in the world
 

5547
01:45:25,800 --> 01:45:28,070
of hurricanes in the world
and you know you're sort of like that's

5548
01:45:28,070 --> 01:45:28,080
and you know you're sort of like that's
 

5549
01:45:28,080 --> 01:45:30,109
and you know you're sort of like that's
that's odd because it's probably the

5550
01:45:30,109 --> 01:45:30,119
that's odd because it's probably the
 

5551
01:45:30,119 --> 01:45:31,729
that's odd because it's probably the
year where I heard the most about

5552
01:45:31,729 --> 01:45:31,739
year where I heard the most about
 

5553
01:45:31,739 --> 01:45:33,590
year where I heard the most about
hurricanes and what that tells you is

5554
01:45:33,590 --> 01:45:33,600
hurricanes and what that tells you is
 

5555
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:34,910
hurricanes and what that tells you is
that just because you hear a lot about

5556
01:45:34,910 --> 01:45:34,920
that just because you hear a lot about
 

5557
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:36,830
that just because you hear a lot about
hurricanes doesn't actually mean that

5558
01:45:36,830 --> 01:45:36,840
hurricanes doesn't actually mean that
 

5559
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:38,330
hurricanes doesn't actually mean that
there is a lot of hurricanes you can't

5560
01:45:38,330 --> 01:45:38,340
there is a lot of hurricanes you can't
 

5561
01:45:38,340 --> 01:45:41,030
there is a lot of hurricanes you can't
just go that way if if you remember uh

5562
01:45:41,030 --> 01:45:41,040
just go that way if if you remember uh
 

5563
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:44,930
just go that way if if you remember uh
in the 1990s and 2000s uh there was an

5564
01:45:44,930 --> 01:45:44,940
in the 1990s and 2000s uh there was an
 

5565
01:45:44,940 --> 01:45:46,490
in the 1990s and 2000s uh there was an
enormous amount of talk about how

5566
01:45:46,490 --> 01:45:46,500
enormous amount of talk about how
 

5567
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:48,830
enormous amount of talk about how
violence uh how crime was getting worse

5568
01:45:48,830 --> 01:45:48,840
violence uh how crime was getting worse
 

5569
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:50,810
violence uh how crime was getting worse
in the U.S while all the objective

5570
01:45:50,810 --> 01:45:50,820
in the U.S while all the objective
 

5571
01:45:50,820 --> 01:45:52,430
in the U.S while all the objective
indicators showed that it was going down

5572
01:45:52,430 --> 01:45:52,440
indicators showed that it was going down
 

5573
01:45:52,440 --> 01:45:55,070
indicators showed that it was going down
but there's sufficient amount of

5574
01:45:55,070 --> 01:45:55,080
but there's sufficient amount of
 

5575
01:45:55,080 --> 01:45:57,770
but there's sufficient amount of
violence that you can fill every radio

5576
01:45:57,770 --> 01:45:57,780
violence that you can fill every radio
 

5577
01:45:57,780 --> 01:46:01,430
violence that you can fill every radio
and TV show with a new crime and so if

5578
01:46:01,430 --> 01:46:01,440
and TV show with a new crime and so if
 

5579
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:03,649
and TV show with a new crime and so if
you get more and more TV shows that talk

5580
01:46:03,649 --> 01:46:03,659
you get more and more TV shows that talk
 

5581
01:46:03,659 --> 01:46:06,050
you get more and more TV shows that talk
about crime actually most people end up

5582
01:46:06,050 --> 01:46:06,060
about crime actually most people end up
 

5583
01:46:06,060 --> 01:46:07,669
about crime actually most people end up
thinking that there's more crime while

5584
01:46:07,669 --> 01:46:07,679
thinking that there's more crime while
 

5585
01:46:07,679 --> 01:46:10,669
thinking that there's more crime while
the real numbers going down so the

5586
01:46:10,669 --> 01:46:10,679
the real numbers going down so the
 

5587
01:46:10,679 --> 01:46:11,930
the real numbers going down so the
reality here is

5588
01:46:11,930 --> 01:46:11,940
reality here is
 

5589
01:46:11,940 --> 01:46:15,910
reality here is
yes climate change will probably affect

5590
01:46:15,910 --> 01:46:15,920
yes climate change will probably affect
 

5591
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:18,770
yes climate change will probably affect
hurricanes in the sense that they'll be

5592
01:46:18,770 --> 01:46:18,780
hurricanes in the sense that they'll be
 

5593
01:46:18,780 --> 01:46:20,510
hurricanes in the sense that they'll be
the same number or slightly fewer as

5594
01:46:20,510 --> 01:46:20,520
the same number or slightly fewer as
 

5595
01:46:20,520 --> 01:46:23,090
the same number or slightly fewer as
Andy was mentioning but they will likely

5596
01:46:23,090 --> 01:46:23,100
Andy was mentioning but they will likely
 

5597
01:46:23,100 --> 01:46:26,090
Andy was mentioning but they will likely
be somewhat stronger this seems to be

5598
01:46:26,090 --> 01:46:26,100
be somewhat stronger this seems to be
 

5599
01:46:26,100 --> 01:46:28,729
be somewhat stronger this seems to be
the the best outcome we're not sure but

5600
01:46:28,729 --> 01:46:28,739
the the best outcome we're not sure but
 

5601
01:46:28,739 --> 01:46:30,590
the the best outcome we're not sure but
this seems to be the the outcome and

5602
01:46:30,590 --> 01:46:30,600
this seems to be the the outcome and
 

5603
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:32,930
this seems to be the the outcome and
it's important to remember stronger is

5604
01:46:32,930 --> 01:46:32,940
it's important to remember stronger is
 

5605
01:46:32,940 --> 01:46:35,629
it's important to remember stronger is
worse than fewer is better

5606
01:46:35,629 --> 01:46:35,639
worse than fewer is better
 

5607
01:46:35,639 --> 01:46:37,250
worse than fewer is better
so overall

5608
01:46:37,250 --> 01:46:37,260
so overall
 

5609
01:46:37,260 --> 01:46:40,010
so overall
climate will make the world a little bit

5610
01:46:40,010 --> 01:46:40,020
climate will make the world a little bit
 

5611
01:46:40,020 --> 01:46:42,770
climate will make the world a little bit
worse so that's that's the that's the

5612
01:46:42,770 --> 01:46:42,780
worse so that's that's the that's the
 

5613
01:46:42,780 --> 01:46:44,810
worse so that's that's the that's the
sort of bottom line but and that's the

5614
01:46:44,810 --> 01:46:44,820
sort of bottom line but and that's the
 

5615
01:46:44,820 --> 01:46:47,270
sort of bottom line but and that's the
real issue here all the other things the

5616
01:46:47,270 --> 01:46:47,280
real issue here all the other things the
 

5617
01:46:47,280 --> 01:46:48,350
real issue here all the other things the
fact that people are much more

5618
01:46:48,350 --> 01:46:48,360
fact that people are much more
 

5619
01:46:48,360 --> 01:46:51,410
fact that people are much more
vulnerable is is just vastly outweigh

5620
01:46:51,410 --> 01:46:51,420
vulnerable is is just vastly outweigh
 

5621
01:46:51,420 --> 01:46:53,990
vulnerable is is just vastly outweigh
this which is why if you look at the

5622
01:46:53,990 --> 01:46:54,000
this which is why if you look at the
 

5623
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,570
this which is why if you look at the
impact of hurricanes and impact of

5624
01:46:56,570 --> 01:46:56,580
impact of hurricanes and impact of
 

5625
01:46:56,580 --> 01:46:58,790
impact of hurricanes and impact of
pretty much everything is typically

5626
01:46:58,790 --> 01:46:58,800
pretty much everything is typically
 

5627
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:01,430
pretty much everything is typically
going down if you look for instance in

5628
01:47:01,430 --> 01:47:01,440
going down if you look for instance in
 

5629
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:03,169
going down if you look for instance in
percent of GDP you have to look at

5630
01:47:03,169 --> 01:47:03,179
percent of GDP you have to look at
 

5631
01:47:03,179 --> 01:47:05,090
percent of GDP you have to look at
percent of GDP because if you have twice

5632
01:47:05,090 --> 01:47:05,100
percent of GDP because if you have twice
 

5633
01:47:05,100 --> 01:47:06,890
percent of GDP because if you have twice
as many houses obviously you know the

5634
01:47:06,890 --> 01:47:06,900
as many houses obviously you know the
 

5635
01:47:06,900 --> 01:47:08,810
as many houses obviously you know the
same kind of impact will have twice the

5636
01:47:08,810 --> 01:47:08,820
same kind of impact will have twice the
 

5637
01:47:08,820 --> 01:47:10,609
same kind of impact will have twice the
the impact or if they're twice as worth

5638
01:47:10,609 --> 01:47:10,619
the impact or if they're twice as worth
 

5639
01:47:10,619 --> 01:47:13,070
the impact or if they're twice as worth
twice as much if you do that in percent

5640
01:47:13,070 --> 01:47:13,080
twice as much if you do that in percent
 

5641
01:47:13,080 --> 01:47:15,169
twice as much if you do that in percent
of GDP and even the UN says that's how

5642
01:47:15,169 --> 01:47:15,179
of GDP and even the UN says that's how
 

5643
01:47:15,179 --> 01:47:17,689
of GDP and even the UN says that's how
you should measure it's going down why

5644
01:47:17,689 --> 01:47:17,699
you should measure it's going down why
 

5645
01:47:17,699 --> 01:47:19,790
you should measure it's going down why
is that it's because we're becoming more

5646
01:47:19,790 --> 01:47:19,800
is that it's because we're becoming more
 

5647
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:21,890
is that it's because we're becoming more
resilient you know just simply we you

5648
01:47:21,890 --> 01:47:21,900
resilient you know just simply we you
 

5649
01:47:21,900 --> 01:47:23,450
resilient you know just simply we you
know if you look at what happens with

5650
01:47:23,450 --> 01:47:23,460
know if you look at what happens with
 

5651
01:47:23,460 --> 01:47:25,370
know if you look at what happens with
when hurricanes come in we have much

5652
01:47:25,370 --> 01:47:25,380
when hurricanes come in we have much
 

5653
01:47:25,380 --> 01:47:27,530
when hurricanes come in we have much
better prediction in the long run that

5654
01:47:27,530 --> 01:47:27,540
better prediction in the long run that
 

5655
01:47:27,540 --> 01:47:29,689
better prediction in the long run that
means you now know you know two or three

5656
01:47:29,689 --> 01:47:29,699
means you now know you know two or three
 

5657
01:47:29,699 --> 01:47:31,430
means you now know you know two or three
days out that there's a big hurricane

5658
01:47:31,430 --> 01:47:31,440
days out that there's a big hurricane
 

5659
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:33,290
days out that there's a big hurricane
that's likely to come here what does

5660
01:47:33,290 --> 01:47:33,300
that's likely to come here what does
 

5661
01:47:33,300 --> 01:47:35,810
that's likely to come here what does
that mean all the things that can be

5662
01:47:35,810 --> 01:47:35,820
that mean all the things that can be
 

5663
01:47:35,820 --> 01:47:37,490
that mean all the things that can be
moved so you know typically all All

5664
01:47:37,490 --> 01:47:37,500
moved so you know typically all All
 

5665
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:40,189
moved so you know typically all All
Buses old trucks everything that's not

5666
01:47:40,189 --> 01:47:40,199
Buses old trucks everything that's not
 

5667
01:47:40,199 --> 01:47:42,649
Buses old trucks everything that's not
bolted down will leave this area and so

5668
01:47:42,649 --> 01:47:42,659
bolted down will leave this area and so
 

5669
01:47:42,659 --> 01:47:45,050
bolted down will leave this area and so
you'll get less damage from that you

5670
01:47:45,050 --> 01:47:45,060
you'll get less damage from that you
 

5671
01:47:45,060 --> 01:47:46,970
you'll get less damage from that you
will have more people knowing oh this is

5672
01:47:46,970 --> 01:47:46,980
will have more people knowing oh this is
 

5673
01:47:46,980 --> 01:47:48,649
will have more people knowing oh this is
going to be a big one they move to their

5674
01:47:48,649 --> 01:47:48,659
going to be a big one they move to their
 

5675
01:47:48,659 --> 01:47:50,570
going to be a big one they move to their
relative somewhere else so you'll have

5676
01:47:50,570 --> 01:47:50,580
relative somewhere else so you'll have
 

5677
01:47:50,580 --> 01:47:52,669
relative somewhere else so you'll have
fewer people being vulnerable there's if

5678
01:47:52,669 --> 01:47:52,679
fewer people being vulnerable there's if
 

5679
01:47:52,679 --> 01:47:54,229
fewer people being vulnerable there's if
people are responsive and aware yeah

5680
01:47:54,229 --> 01:47:54,239
people are responsive and aware yeah
 

5681
01:47:54,239 --> 01:47:57,770
people are responsive and aware yeah
yeah you can do this so the outcome and

5682
01:47:57,770 --> 01:47:57,780
yeah you can do this so the outcome and
 

5683
01:47:57,780 --> 01:47:58,910
yeah you can do this so the outcome and
this is important for the whole

5684
01:47:58,910 --> 01:47:58,920
this is important for the whole
 

5685
01:47:58,920 --> 01:48:01,430
this is important for the whole
conversation the outcome is that we're

5686
01:48:01,430 --> 01:48:01,440
conversation the outcome is that we're
 

5687
01:48:01,440 --> 01:48:04,070
conversation the outcome is that we're
actually becoming less vulnerable and

5688
01:48:04,070 --> 01:48:04,080
actually becoming less vulnerable and
 

5689
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:07,370
actually becoming less vulnerable and
the damages are becoming smaller not

5690
01:48:07,370 --> 01:48:07,380
the damages are becoming smaller not
 

5691
01:48:07,380 --> 01:48:10,189
the damages are becoming smaller not
bigger but had they not been global

5692
01:48:10,189 --> 01:48:10,199
bigger but had they not been global
 

5693
01:48:10,199 --> 01:48:12,290
bigger but had they not been global
warming it would probably have gone down

5694
01:48:12,290 --> 01:48:12,300
warming it would probably have gone down
 

5695
01:48:12,300 --> 01:48:15,050
warming it would probably have gone down
even faster so we would have become even

5696
01:48:15,050 --> 01:48:15,060
even faster so we would have become even
 

5697
01:48:15,060 --> 01:48:17,629
even faster so we would have become even
better off quicker had there been no

5698
01:48:17,629 --> 01:48:17,639
better off quicker had there been no
 

5699
01:48:17,639 --> 01:48:19,970
better off quicker had there been no
global warming but this is a crucial

5700
01:48:19,970 --> 01:48:19,980
global warming but this is a crucial
 

5701
01:48:19,980 --> 01:48:21,530
global warming but this is a crucial
difference and this is what I find

5702
01:48:21,530 --> 01:48:21,540
difference and this is what I find
 

5703
01:48:21,540 --> 01:48:23,629
difference and this is what I find
really hard to communicate climate

5704
01:48:23,629 --> 01:48:23,639
really hard to communicate climate
 

5705
01:48:23,639 --> 01:48:25,669
really hard to communicate climate
change is not this oh my God everything

5706
01:48:25,669 --> 01:48:25,679
change is not this oh my God everything
 

5707
01:48:25,679 --> 01:48:28,010
change is not this oh my God everything
is going off the off the off the charts

5708
01:48:28,010 --> 01:48:28,020
is going off the off the off the charts
 

5709
01:48:28,020 --> 01:48:29,450
is going off the off the off the charts
and we're all going to be doomed kind of

5710
01:48:29,450 --> 01:48:29,460
and we're all going to be doomed kind of
 

5711
01:48:29,460 --> 01:48:32,450
and we're all going to be doomed kind of
thing climate change is a thing that

5712
01:48:32,450 --> 01:48:32,460
thing climate change is a thing that
 

5713
01:48:32,460 --> 01:48:35,510
thing climate change is a thing that
means we're going to get better slightly

5714
01:48:35,510 --> 01:48:35,520
means we're going to get better slightly
 

5715
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:38,270
means we're going to get better slightly
slower and that's a very very different

5716
01:48:38,270 --> 01:48:38,280
slower and that's a very very different
 

5717
01:48:38,280 --> 01:48:40,669
slower and that's a very very different
kind of attitude it's one of the many

5718
01:48:40,669 --> 01:48:40,679
kind of attitude it's one of the many
 

5719
01:48:40,679 --> 01:48:43,010
kind of attitude it's one of the many
problems rather than this is the end of

5720
01:48:43,010 --> 01:48:43,020
problems rather than this is the end of
 

5721
01:48:43,020 --> 01:48:45,229
problems rather than this is the end of
all of us and by the way if you look at

5722
01:48:45,229 --> 01:48:45,239
all of us and by the way if you look at
 

5723
01:48:45,239 --> 01:48:47,149
all of us and by the way if you look at
what's happening in the world

5724
01:48:47,149 --> 01:48:47,159
what's happening in the world
 

5725
01:48:47,159 --> 01:48:49,970
what's happening in the world
um the data also show that in rich

5726
01:48:49,970 --> 01:48:49,980
um the data also show that in rich
 

5727
01:48:49,980 --> 01:48:51,709
um the data also show that in rich
places in four places we still are

5728
01:48:51,709 --> 01:48:51,719
places in four places we still are
 

5729
01:48:51,719 --> 01:48:54,350
places in four places we still are
moving into zones of Hazard faster than

Cloud to Street did an amazing study

5738
01:49:04,550 --> 01:49:04,560

01:49:06,600 --> 01:49:07,910
showing this is a year or so ago I wrote
about showing

01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:09,830
about showing
again we're moving into zones of Hazard

5744
01:49:09,830 --> 01:49:09,840
again we're moving into zones of Hazard
 

5745
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:11,689
again we're moving into zones of Hazard
which it applies to me

which it applies to me
 

5747
01:49:11,699 --> 01:49:12,350
which it applies to me
um

5748
01:49:12,350 --> 01:49:12,360
um
 

5749
01:49:12,360 --> 01:49:14,810
um
just what Bjorn was saying that we

5750
01:49:14,810 --> 01:49:14,820
just what Bjorn was saying that we
 

5751
01:49:14,820 --> 01:49:16,070
just what Bjorn was saying that we
wouldn't be people wouldn't be doing

5752
01:49:16,070 --> 01:49:16,080
wouldn't be people wouldn't be doing
 

5753
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:18,890
wouldn't be people wouldn't be doing
that if they thought that was going to

5754
01:49:18,890 --> 01:49:18,900
that if they thought that was going to
 

5755
01:49:18,900 --> 01:49:20,689
that if they thought that was going to
lead to Devastation and this is today

5756
01:49:20,689 --> 01:49:20,699
lead to Devastation and this is today
 

5757
01:49:20,699 --> 01:49:22,850
lead to Devastation and this is today
we're doing this now and it's flood

5758
01:49:22,850 --> 01:49:22,860
we're doing this now and it's flood
 

5759
01:49:22,860 --> 01:49:25,609
we're doing this now and it's flood
flood zones Wildfire zones

flood zones Wildfire zones
 

5761
01:49:25,619 --> 01:49:29,629
flood zones Wildfire zones
so that means there's these things to do

5762
01:49:29,629 --> 01:49:29,639
so that means there's these things to do
 

5763
01:49:29,639 --> 01:49:31,550
so that means there's these things to do
you there's so much plasticity in the

5764
01:49:31,550 --> 01:49:31,560
you there's so much plasticity in the
 

5765
01:49:31,560 --> 01:49:33,470
you there's so much plasticity in the
human behavior and how we build and

5766
01:49:33,470 --> 01:49:33,480
human behavior and how we build and
 

5767
01:49:33,480 --> 01:49:35,510
human behavior and how we build and
where we build you can make a big big

5768
01:49:35,510 --> 01:49:35,520
where we build you can make a big big
 

5769
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:38,570
where we build you can make a big big
change in the outcomes I mean one of the

5770
01:49:38,570 --> 01:49:38,580
change in the outcomes I mean one of the
 

5771
01:49:38,580 --> 01:49:39,890
change in the outcomes I mean one of the
things to remember is you know people

5772
01:49:39,890 --> 01:49:39,900
things to remember is you know people
 

5773
01:49:39,900 --> 01:49:41,930
things to remember is you know people
move to where hurricanes hit because

5774
01:49:41,930 --> 01:49:41,940
move to where hurricanes hit because
 

5775
01:49:41,940 --> 01:49:43,850
move to where hurricanes hit because
when they're not there it's a really

5776
01:49:43,850 --> 01:49:43,860
when they're not there it's a really
 

5777
01:49:43,860 --> 01:49:45,770
when they're not there it's a really
beautiful place to be yeah yeah right so

5778
01:49:45,770 --> 01:49:45,780
beautiful place to be yeah yeah right so
 

5779
01:49:45,780 --> 01:49:48,410
beautiful place to be yeah yeah right so
so in in many ways we we make the

5780
01:49:48,410 --> 01:49:48,420
so in in many ways we we make the
 

5781
01:49:48,420 --> 01:49:51,050
so in in many ways we we make the
trade-offs and say look I'm I'm happy to

5782
01:49:51,050 --> 01:49:51,060
trade-offs and say look I'm I'm happy to
 

5783
01:49:51,060 --> 01:49:53,570
trade-offs and say look I'm I'm happy to
live you know have an ocean view and

5784
01:49:53,570 --> 01:49:53,580
live you know have an ocean view and
 

5785
01:49:53,580 --> 01:49:55,250
live you know have an ocean view and
then maybe a hurricane is going to hit

5786
01:49:55,250 --> 01:49:55,260
then maybe a hurricane is going to hit
 

5787
01:49:55,260 --> 01:49:56,870
then maybe a hurricane is going to hit
and of course it becomes a lot easier

5788
01:49:56,870 --> 01:49:56,880
and of course it becomes a lot easier
 

5789
01:49:56,880 --> 01:49:58,250
and of course it becomes a lot easier
than when the federal government is

5790
01:49:58,250 --> 01:49:58,260
than when the federal government is
 

5791
01:49:58,260 --> 01:50:00,590
than when the federal government is

warming so you use it interchangeably it
 

5873
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,330
warming so you use it interchangeably it
is an aside but it's one that's worthy

01:51:32,330 --> 01:51:32,340
is an aside but it's one that's worthy
 

5875

is an aside but it's one that's worthy

oh no they're going to climate change
now like it's a new thing which is crazy

about well it's really that's that's the

01:52:17,330 --> 01:52:17,340
about well it's really that's that's the
 

5921
01:52:17,340 --> 01:52:19,189
about well it's really that's that's the

01:52:52,910 --> 01:52:52,920
political implications and all that kind
 

5951
01:52:52,920 --> 01:52:55,010
political implications and all that kind
of stuff so I guess I'm asking is there

5952
01:52:55,010 --> 01:52:55,020
of stuff so I guess I'm asking is there
 

5953
01:52:55,020 --> 01:52:58,850
of stuff so I guess I'm asking is there
like uh is is there uh are you signaling

5954
01:52:58,850 --> 01:52:58,860
like uh is is there uh are you signaling
 

5955
01:52:58,860 --> 01:53:01,189
like uh is is there uh are you signaling
something by using global warming versus

5956
01:53:01,189 --> 01:53:01,199
something by using global warming versus
 

5957
01:53:01,199 --> 01:53:03,470
something by using global warming versus
climate change or people have calmed

5958
01:53:03,470 --> 01:53:03,480
climate change or people have calmed
 

5959
01:53:03,480 --> 01:53:05,330
climate change or people have calmed
down in terms of the use of these no no

5960
01:53:05,330 --> 01:53:05,340
down in terms of the use of these no no
 

5961
01:53:05,340 --> 01:53:07,910
down in terms of the use of these no no
but the guardian newspapers made it

5962
01:53:07,910 --> 01:53:07,920
but the guardian newspapers made it
 

5963
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:10,070
but the guardian newspapers made it
worse now they have their style book you

5964
01:53:10,070 --> 01:53:10,080
worse now they have their style book you
 

5965
01:53:10,080 --> 01:53:12,770
worse now they have their style book you
know every newspaper has a they they

5971
01:53:16,139 --> 01:53:17,750
reporters to use any of those terms
anymore they call it climate crisis

5972
01:53:17,750 --> 01:53:17,760

5980
01:53:25,970 --> 01:53:25,980
intense and that was the point well I
 

5981
01:53:25,980 --> 01:53:28,250

wrote about the global Heating

his amplifier goes to 11. you know the

5996
01:53:41,629 --> 01:53:41,639
his amplifier goes to 11. you know the
 

5997
01:53:41,639 --> 01:53:43,189
his amplifier goes to 11. you know the
idea that you turned up the rhetorical

5998
01:53:43,189 --> 01:53:43,199
idea that you turned up the rhetorical
 

5999
01:53:43,199 --> 01:53:44,330
idea that you turned up the rhetorical
volume and that's going to change

6000
01:53:44,330 --> 01:53:44,340

people's is ridiculous so so for me I

6002
01:53:47,330 --> 01:53:47,340
people's is ridiculous so so for me I
 

6003
01:53:47,340 --> 01:53:50,149
people's is ridiculous so so for me I
mean uh I use global warming and climate

6004
01:53:50,149 --> 01:53:50,159
mean uh I use global warming and climate
 

6005
01:53:50,159 --> 01:53:52,430
mean uh I use global warming and climate
change uh uh interchangeably and I think

6006
01:53:52,430 --> 01:53:52,440
change uh uh interchangeably and I think
 

6007
01:53:52,440 --> 01:53:54,350
change uh uh interchangeably and I think
it's it's fair there's you know there's

6008
01:53:54,350 --> 01:53:54,360
it's it's fair there's you know there's
 

6009
01:53:54,360 --> 01:53:55,609
it's it's fair there's you know there's
some technical ways that you can

6010
01:53:55,609 --> 01:53:55,619
some technical ways that you can
 

6011
01:53:55,619 --> 01:53:58,430
some technical ways that you can
differentiate them uh but the reality is

6012
01:53:58,430 --> 01:53:58,440
differentiate them uh but the reality is
 

6013
01:53:58,440 --> 01:54:01,010
differentiate them uh but the reality is
global warming is probably a better way

6014
01:54:01,010 --> 01:54:01,020
global warming is probably a better way
 

6015
01:54:01,020 --> 01:54:03,050
global warming is probably a better way
to describe a lot of it because this is

6016
01:54:03,050 --> 01:54:03,060
to describe a lot of it because this is
 

6017
01:54:03,060 --> 01:54:05,270
to describe a lot of it because this is
really what is the main Drive of what we

6018
01:54:05,270 --> 01:54:05,280
really what is the main Drive of what we
 

6019
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:07,609
really what is the main Drive of what we
worry about uh climate change seems a

6020
01:54:07,609 --> 01:54:07,619
worry about uh climate change seems a
 

6021
01:54:07,619 --> 01:54:09,109
worry about uh climate change seems a
little diffuse but you know it's

6022
01:54:09,109 --> 01:54:09,119
little diffuse but you know it's
 

6023
01:54:09,119 --> 01:54:10,790
little diffuse but you know it's
convenient to when you talk about

6024
01:54:10,790 --> 01:54:10,800
convenient to when you talk about
 

6025
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:12,530
convenient to when you talk about
climate all the time that you can call

6026
01:54:12,530 --> 01:54:12,540
climate all the time that you can call
 

6027
01:54:12,540 --> 01:54:14,390
climate all the time that you can call
both of them but I think the climate

6028
01:54:14,390 --> 01:54:14,400
both of them but I think the climate
 

6029
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:16,910
both of them but I think the climate
crisis and the climate catastrophe is

6030
01:54:16,910 --> 01:54:16,920
crisis and the climate catastrophe is
 

6031
01:54:16,920 --> 01:54:19,850
crisis and the climate catastrophe is
really sort of this is the amping up uh

6032
01:54:19,850 --> 01:54:19,860
really sort of this is the amping up uh
 

6033
01:54:19,860 --> 01:54:21,950
really sort of this is the amping up uh
of of a catastrophe and again as we've

6034
01:54:21,950 --> 01:54:21,960
of of a catastrophe and again as we've
 

6035
01:54:21,960 --> 01:54:24,169
of of a catastrophe and again as we've
talked about before uh if it really were

6036
01:54:24,169 --> 01:54:24,179
talked about before uh if it really were
 

6037
01:54:24,179 --> 01:54:26,810
talked about before uh if it really were
true we should tell people uh but if

6038
01:54:26,810 --> 01:54:26,820
true we should tell people uh but if
 

6039
01:54:26,820 --> 01:54:28,250
true we should tell people uh but if
it's not true and I think there's a lot

6040
01:54:28,250 --> 01:54:28,260
it's not true and I think there's a lot
 

6041
01:54:28,260 --> 01:54:30,350
it's not true and I think there's a lot
of reasons why this is not a you know a

6042
01:54:30,350 --> 01:54:30,360
of reasons why this is not a you know a
 

6043
01:54:30,360 --> 01:54:32,750
of reasons why this is not a you know a
climate catastrophe this is a problem uh

6044
01:54:32,750 --> 01:54:32,760
climate catastrophe this is a problem uh
 

6045
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:34,310
climate catastrophe this is a problem uh
we're actually doing everyone a

6046
01:54:34,310 --> 01:54:34,320
we're actually doing everyone a
 

6047
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:36,169
we're actually doing everyone a
disservice because we we end up making

6048
01:54:36,169 --> 01:54:36,179
disservice because we we end up making
 

6049
01:54:36,179 --> 01:54:38,209
disservice because we we end up making
people so worried that they say we got

6050
01:54:38,209 --> 01:54:38,219
people so worried that they say we got
 

6051
01:54:38,219 --> 01:54:40,010
people so worried that they say we got
to fix this in 12 years or whatever the

6052
01:54:40,010 --> 01:54:40,020
to fix this in 12 years or whatever the
 

6053
01:54:40,020 --> 01:54:42,350
to fix this in 12 years or whatever the
number is and also that it makes it

6054
01:54:42,350 --> 01:54:42,360
number is and also that it makes it
 

6055
01:54:42,360 --> 01:54:44,750
number is and also that it makes it
almost impossible to have a conversation

6056
01:54:44,750 --> 01:54:44,760
almost impossible to have a conversation
 

6057
01:54:44,760 --> 01:54:46,609
almost impossible to have a conversation
of you know well you know maybe we

6058
01:54:46,609 --> 01:54:46,619
of you know well you know maybe we
 

6059
01:54:46,619 --> 01:54:48,229
of you know well you know maybe we
should be focusing on vulnerability

6060
01:54:48,229 --> 01:54:48,239
should be focusing on vulnerability
 

6061
01:54:48,239 --> 01:54:50,689
should be focusing on vulnerability
first and it a lot of people and I think

6062
01:54:50,689 --> 01:54:50,699
first and it a lot of people and I think
 

6063
01:54:50,699 --> 01:54:52,790
first and it a lot of people and I think
a lot of well-meaning uh and

6064
01:54:52,790 --> 01:54:52,800
a lot of well-meaning uh and
 

6065
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:54,890
a lot of well-meaning uh and
well-intentioned people feel that it's

6066
01:54:54,890 --> 01:54:54,900
well-intentioned people feel that it's
 

6067
01:54:54,900 --> 01:54:58,070
well-intentioned people feel that it's
almost sacrilegious to do you know to

6068
01:54:58,070 --> 01:54:58,080
almost sacrilegious to do you know to
 

6069
01:54:58,080 --> 01:55:00,050
almost sacrilegious to do you know to
say it's a it's about uh vulnerability

6070
01:55:00,050 --> 01:55:00,060
say it's a it's about uh vulnerability
 

6071
01:55:00,060 --> 01:55:03,109
say it's a it's about uh vulnerability
because you're taking away you the guilt

6072
01:55:03,109 --> 01:55:03,119
because you're taking away you the guilt
 

6073
01:55:03,119 --> 01:55:04,850
because you're taking away you the guilt
of climate change you're taking away our

of climate change you're taking away our
 

6075

focus on on on dealing with climate

6076
01:55:07,070 --> 01:55:07,080
focus on on on dealing with climate

01:55:07,080 --> 01:55:09,530
focus on on on dealing with climate
change whereas I think we would say no

6078
01:55:09,530 --> 01:55:09,540
change whereas I think we would say no
 

6079
01:55:09,540 --> 01:55:12,410

it's about stuff that actually works and

01:55:12,410 --> 01:55:12,420
it's about stuff that actually works and
 

6081
01:55:12,420 --> 01:55:14,510
it's about stuff that actually works and

uh uh climate research group that you

6116
01:55:54,590 --> 01:55:54,600
uh uh climate research group that you
 

6117
01:55:54,600 --> 01:55:56,629
uh uh climate research group that you
can have some quipples with the way that

6118

can have some quipples with the way that

they sort of summarize it and

6120
01:55:58,490 --> 01:55:58,500
they sort of summarize it and
 

6121
01:55:58,500 --> 01:56:00,530
they sort of summarize it and
politically coordinated documents and

01:56:00,530 --> 01:56:00,540
politically coordinated documents and
 

6123
01:56:00,540 --> 01:56:01,970
politically coordinated documents and
stuff but you know fundamentally I think

6124
01:56:01,970 --> 01:56:01,980
stuff but you know fundamentally I think
 

6125
01:56:01,980 --> 01:56:04,609
stuff but you know fundamentally I think
they do a good job of of putting

01:56:04,609 --> 01:56:04,619
they do a good job of of putting
 

6127
01:56:04,619 --> 01:56:06,530
they do a good job of of putting

climate panel they do like us they do

6142
01:56:22,310 --> 01:56:22,320
climate panel they do like us they do
 

6143
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:24,530
climate panel they do like us they do
predictions as well no well they they

6144
01:56:24,530 --> 01:56:24,540
predictions as well no well they they
 

6145
01:56:24,540 --> 01:56:27,109

pull together all the stuff that people

6146
01:56:27,109 --> 01:56:27,119
pull together all the stuff that people
 

6147
01:56:27,119 --> 01:56:29,750
pull together all the stuff that people
have published in the period literature

6148
01:56:29,750 --> 01:56:29,760
have published in the period literature
 

6149
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:31,850
have published in the period literature
and then try to summarize it and

6150
01:56:31,850 --> 01:56:31,860
and then try to summarize it and
 

6151
01:56:31,860 --> 01:56:33,890
and then try to summarize it and
basically tell you so what's up and down

6152
01:56:33,890 --> 01:56:33,900
basically tell you so what's up and down
 

6153
01:56:33,900 --> 01:56:36,530
basically tell you so what's up and down
with climate change they do that in four

6154
01:56:36,530 --> 01:56:36,540
with climate change they do that in four
 

6155
01:56:36,540 --> 01:56:39,109
with climate change they do that in four
four large volumes every four to five

6156
01:56:39,109 --> 01:56:39,119
four large volumes every four to five
 

6157
01:56:39,119 --> 01:56:42,649
four large volumes every four to five
six seven years or something uh and um

6158
01:56:42,649 --> 01:56:42,659
six seven years or something uh and um
 

6159
01:56:42,659 --> 01:56:44,870
six seven years or something uh and um
and yes it's it's you know I think it's

6160
01:56:44,870 --> 01:56:44,880
and yes it's it's you know I think it's
 

6161
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:46,510
and yes it's it's you know I think it's
the gold-plated version of what we know

6162
01:56:46,510 --> 01:56:46,520
the gold-plated version of what we know
 

6163
01:56:46,520 --> 01:56:50,090
the gold-plated version of what we know
uh there tends to be a lot of

6164
01:56:50,090 --> 01:56:50,100
uh there tends to be a lot of
 

6165
01:56:50,100 --> 01:56:52,250
uh there tends to be a lot of
um uh well this is what they say

6166
01:56:52,250 --> 01:56:52,260
um uh well this is what they say
 

6167
01:56:52,260 --> 01:56:54,530
um uh well this is what they say
actually they say so many different

6168
01:56:54,530 --> 01:56:54,540
actually they say so many different
 

6169
01:56:54,540 --> 01:56:56,270
actually they say so many different
places with so many different people

6170
01:56:56,270 --> 01:56:56,280
places with so many different people
 

6171
01:56:56,280 --> 01:56:58,669
places with so many different people
that it's not quite clear exactly what

6172
01:56:58,669 --> 01:56:58,679
that it's not quite clear exactly what
 

6173
01:56:58,679 --> 01:56:59,930
that it's not quite clear exactly what
they're saying often you know you can

6174
01:56:59,930 --> 01:56:59,940
they're saying often you know you can
 

6175
01:56:59,940 --> 01:57:02,450
they're saying often you know you can
sort of find contradictions between one

6176
01:57:02,450 --> 01:57:02,460
sort of find contradictions between one
 

6177
01:57:02,460 --> 01:57:04,490
sort of find contradictions between one
volume with one set of authors and

6178
01:57:04,490 --> 01:57:04,500
volume with one set of authors and
 

6179
01:57:04,500 --> 01:57:07,669
volume with one set of authors and
another but yeah look I I think this is

6180
01:57:07,669 --> 01:57:07,679
another but yeah look I I think this is
 

6181
01:57:07,679 --> 01:57:10,430
another but yeah look I I think this is
fundamentally the right way that we know

6182
01:57:10,430 --> 01:57:10,440
fundamentally the right way that we know
 

6183
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:14,209
fundamentally the right way that we know
about climate but then it gets

6184
01:57:14,209 --> 01:57:14,219
about climate but then it gets
 

6185
01:57:14,219 --> 01:57:16,550
about climate but then it gets
translated into how do you how do you

6186
01:57:16,550 --> 01:57:16,560
translated into how do you how do you
 

6187
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:17,930
translated into how do you how do you
know about this when most people don't

6188
01:57:17,930 --> 01:57:17,940
know about this when most people don't
 

6189
01:57:17,940 --> 01:57:20,990
know about this when most people don't
read these 4 000 Pages you read a news

6190
01:57:20,990 --> 01:57:21,000
read these 4 000 Pages you read a news
 

6191
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:24,169
read these 4 000 Pages you read a news
story in a newspaper and that new story

6192
01:57:24,169 --> 01:57:24,179
story in a newspaper and that new story
 

6193
01:57:24,179 --> 01:57:26,870
story in a newspaper and that new story
will be very very heavily slanted

6194
01:57:26,870 --> 01:57:26,880
will be very very heavily slanted
 

6195
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:29,750
will be very very heavily slanted
towards you know if if you say so sea

6196
01:57:29,750 --> 01:57:29,760
towards you know if if you say so sea
 

6197
01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:31,550
towards you know if if you say so sea
levels could rise somewhere between one

6198
01:57:31,550 --> 01:57:31,560
levels could rise somewhere between one
 

6199
01:57:31,560 --> 01:57:34,729
levels could rise somewhere between one
and three foot what do you hear yeah you

6200
01:57:34,729 --> 01:57:34,739
and three foot what do you hear yeah you
 

6201
01:57:34,739 --> 01:57:36,410
and three foot what do you hear yeah you
obviously hear the three foot three foot

6202
01:57:36,410 --> 01:57:36,420
obviously hear the three foot three foot
 

6203
01:57:36,420 --> 01:57:38,330
obviously hear the three foot three foot
is just you know more fun more scary

6204
01:57:38,330 --> 01:57:38,340
is just you know more fun more scary
 

6205
01:57:38,340 --> 01:57:41,209
is just you know more fun more scary
more interesting than one foot uh and

6206
01:57:41,209 --> 01:57:41,219
more interesting than one foot uh and
 

6207
01:57:41,219 --> 01:57:43,070
more interesting than one foot uh and
and it's that way with all of these you

6208
01:57:43,070 --> 01:57:43,080
and it's that way with all of these you
 

6209
01:57:43,080 --> 01:57:45,470
and it's that way with all of these you
know so what what's the prediction for

6210
01:57:45,470 --> 01:57:45,480
know so what what's the prediction for
 

6211
01:57:45,480 --> 01:57:47,870
know so what what's the prediction for
for temperature arises it's uh somewhere

6212
01:57:47,870 --> 01:57:47,880
for temperature arises it's uh somewhere
 

6213
01:57:47,880 --> 01:57:50,089
for temperature arises it's uh somewhere
from not very scary to pretty damn scary

6214
01:57:50,089 --> 01:57:50,099
from not very scary to pretty damn scary
 

6215
01:57:50,099 --> 01:57:52,550
from not very scary to pretty damn scary
uh and again you hear the pretty damn

6216
01:57:52,550 --> 01:57:52,560
uh and again you hear the pretty damn
 

6217
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:55,010
uh and again you hear the pretty damn
scary all the time uh and and then

6218
01:57:55,010 --> 01:57:55,020
scary all the time uh and and then
 

6219
01:57:55,020 --> 01:57:56,570
scary all the time uh and and then
there's there's obviously always

6220
01:57:56,570 --> 01:57:56,580
there's there's obviously always
 

6221
01:57:56,580 --> 01:57:58,490
there's there's obviously always
researchers who are saying well but

6222
01:57:58,490 --> 01:57:58,500
researchers who are saying well but
 

6223
01:57:58,500 --> 01:58:00,229
researchers who are saying well but
actually it could be a little more scary

6224
01:58:00,229 --> 01:58:00,239
actually it could be a little more scary
 

6225
01:58:00,239 --> 01:58:02,089
actually it could be a little more scary
than that and then they're likewise

6226
01:58:02,089 --> 01:58:02,099
than that and then they're likewise
 

6227
01:58:02,099 --> 01:58:03,890
than that and then they're likewise
researchers who say well you know it's

01:58:03,890 --> 01:58:03,900
researchers who say well you know it's
 

6229
01:58:03,900 --> 01:58:05,270
researchers who say well you know it's
probably not going to be as scary as

6230
01:58:05,270 --> 01:58:05,280
probably not going to be as scary as
 

6231
01:58:05,280 --> 01:58:08,510
probably not going to be as scary as
that and most of the journalists will

6232
01:58:08,510 --> 01:58:08,520
that and most of the journalists will
 

6233
01:58:08,520 --> 01:58:10,669
that and most of the journalists will

01:58:10,669 --> 01:58:10,679
you know interview do you really put the
 

6235
01:58:10,679 --> 01:58:12,709
you know interview do you really put the

6238
01:58:16,070 --> 01:58:16,080
journalists on the media setup look
 

6239
01:58:16,080 --> 01:58:18,589

media is simply trying to get clicks or

6240
01:58:18,589 --> 01:58:18,599
media is simply trying to get clicks or
 

6241
01:58:18,599 --> 01:58:21,350
media is simply trying to get clicks or
sell newspapers and if if you were just

6242
01:58:21,350 --> 01:58:21,360
sell newspapers and if if you were just
 

6243
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:24,169
sell newspapers and if if you were just
going to say this is not a big issue it

6244
01:58:24,169 --> 01:58:24,179
going to say this is not a big issue it
 

6245
01:58:24,179 --> 01:58:25,790
going to say this is not a big issue it
just doesn't sell anything but I think

6246
01:58:25,790 --> 01:58:25,800
just doesn't sell anything but I think
 

6247
01:58:25,800 --> 01:58:27,169
just doesn't sell anything but I think
you're probably much better able to

you're probably much better able to
 

6249
01:58:27,179 --> 01:58:29,750
you're probably much better able to
address this well no I

01:59:47,760 --> 01:59:50,570
but getting back to this specific
question I think the 2018 ipcc report

6326
01:59:50,570 --> 01:59:50,580
question I think the 2018 ipcc report
 

6327
01:59:50,580 --> 01:59:53,330
question I think the 2018 ipcc report
which was a special report commissioned

to learn about the difference between
1.5 degrees of warming and two which

6332
01:59:57,649 --> 01:59:57,659
1.5 degrees of warming and two which
 

6333
01:59:57,659 --> 01:59:59,390
1.5 degrees of warming and two which
sounds so weird and technocratic and

6334
01:59:59,390 --> 01:59:59,400
sounds so weird and technocratic and
 

6335
01:59:59,400 --> 02:00:01,490
sounds so weird and technocratic and
complicated that's the one that

6336
02:00:01,490 --> 02:00:01,500
complicated that's the one that
 

6337
02:00:01,500 --> 02:00:03,709
complicated that's the one that
generated the whole meme about eight

6338
02:00:03,709 --> 02:00:03,719
generated the whole meme about eight

starting in 2020 it didn't happen it's
 

6441
02:01:58,560 --> 02:02:00,890
starting in 2020 it didn't happen it's
like basically

6442
02:02:00,890 --> 02:02:00,900
like basically
 

6443
02:02:00,900 --> 02:02:02,390
like basically
some money is Flowing but it's not

really made up of money yeah and so so
 

6447
02:02:04,440 --> 02:02:07,189
really made up of money yeah and so so
that whole dynamic they latch onto the

6448
02:02:07,189 --> 02:02:07,199
that whole dynamic they latch onto the
 

6449
02:02:07,199 --> 02:02:09,109
that whole dynamic they latch onto the
climate science and they they you know

6450
02:02:09,109 --> 02:02:09,119
climate science and they they you know
 

6451
02:02:09,119 --> 02:02:11,450
climate science and they they you know
so they're there and they're very handy

6452
02:02:11,450 --> 02:02:11,460
so they're there and they're very handy
 

6453
02:02:11,460 --> 02:02:12,770
so they're there and they're very handy
quotable people

which fits all these narrative threads
 

6461
02:02:18,060 --> 02:02:20,510
which fits all these narrative threads
that come together into this information

6462

then of course it's not Pakistan's fault
 

6467

02:02:28,910 --> 02:02:28,920
almost all leaders now say it's because
 

6471
02:02:28,920 --> 02:02:30,950
almost all leaders now say it's because
of climate because then it's not you

6472
02:02:30,950 --> 02:02:30,960
of climate because then it's not you
 

6473
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:33,050
of climate because then it's not you
know we didn't do anything wrong uh in

6474
02:02:33,050 --> 02:02:33,060
know we didn't do anything wrong uh in
 

6475
02:02:33,060 --> 02:02:35,149
know we didn't do anything wrong uh in
Germany for instance uh when we had that

6476
02:02:35,149 --> 02:02:35,159
Germany for instance uh when we had that
 

6477
02:02:35,159 --> 02:02:37,729
Germany for instance uh when we had that
flood last year it's it's not impossible

6478
02:02:37,729 --> 02:02:37,739
flood last year it's it's not impossible
 

6479
02:02:37,739 --> 02:02:40,250
flood last year it's it's not impossible
that the climate had a part in in that

6480
02:02:40,250 --> 02:02:40,260
that the climate had a part in in that
 

6481
02:02:40,260 --> 02:02:42,410
that the climate had a part in in that
but it's very very clear that the main

6482
02:02:42,410 --> 02:02:42,420
but it's very very clear that the main
 

6483
02:02:42,420 --> 02:02:44,149
but it's very very clear that the main
reason why so many people died in

6484
02:02:44,149 --> 02:02:44,159
reason why so many people died in
 

6485
02:02:44,159 --> 02:02:46,370
reason why so many people died in
Germany and Belgium was because the

6486
02:02:46,370 --> 02:02:46,380
Germany and Belgium was because the
 

6487
02:02:46,380 --> 02:02:48,970
Germany and Belgium was because the
Alarm Systems didn't work and this was

6488

there's a lot of if I were to think
 

6505
02:03:09,119 --> 02:03:11,149
there's a lot of if I were to think
about what did you call it front page

6506
02:03:11,149 --> 02:03:11,159
about what did you call it front page
 

6507
02:03:11,159 --> 02:03:15,649
about what did you call it front page
thought there's a lot of really

6508
02:03:15,649 --> 02:03:15,659
thought there's a lot of really
 

6509
02:03:15,659 --> 02:03:16,510
thought there's a lot of really
um

6510
02:03:16,510 --> 02:03:16,520
um
 

6511
02:03:16,520 --> 02:03:21,050
um
narratives that uh result in destruction

6512
02:03:21,050 --> 02:03:21,060
narratives that uh result in destruction
 

6513
02:03:21,060 --> 02:03:23,050
narratives that uh result in destruction
of the human species so nuclear war

6514
02:03:23,050 --> 02:03:23,060
of the human species so nuclear war
 

6515
02:03:23,060 --> 02:03:25,129
of the human species so nuclear war
pandemics all that kind of stuff it

6516
02:03:25,129 --> 02:03:25,139
pandemics all that kind of stuff it
 

6517
02:03:25,139 --> 02:03:27,470
pandemics all that kind of stuff it
seems that climate is a sticky one so

6518
02:03:27,470 --> 02:03:27,480
seems that climate is a sticky one so
 

6519
02:03:27,480 --> 02:03:29,149
seems that climate is a sticky one so
the fact that it's sticky means there's

6520
02:03:29,149 --> 02:03:29,159
the fact that it's sticky means there's
 

6521
02:03:29,159 --> 02:03:30,950
the fact that it's sticky means there's
other interests at play like you guys

6522
02:03:30,950 --> 02:03:30,960
other interests at play like you guys
 

6523
02:03:30,960 --> 02:03:32,930
other interests at play like you guys
are talking about in terms of politics

6524
02:03:32,930 --> 02:03:32,940
are talking about in terms of politics
 

6525
02:03:32,940 --> 02:03:34,430

all that kind of stuff so it's not just

6526
02:03:34,430 --> 02:03:34,440
all that kind of stuff so it's not just
 

6527
02:03:34,440 --> 02:03:36,350
all that kind of stuff so it's not just
a journalists I feel like journalists

6528
02:03:36,350 --> 02:03:36,360
a journalists I feel like journalists
 

6529
02:03:36,360 --> 02:03:38,750
a journalists I feel like journalists
will try anything for the front page but

6530
02:03:38,750 --> 02:03:38,760
will try anything for the front page but
 

6531
02:03:38,760 --> 02:03:41,689
will try anything for the front page but
it won't you won't stick unless there is

6532
02:03:41,689 --> 02:03:41,699
it won't you won't stick unless there is
 

6533
02:03:41,699 --> 02:03:44,330
it won't you won't stick unless there is
bigger interest to play for which these

6534
02:03:44,330 --> 02:03:44,340
bigger interest to play for which these
 

6535
02:03:44,340 --> 02:03:46,370
bigger interest to play for which these
narratives are useful so journalists

6536
02:03:46,370 --> 02:03:46,380
narratives are useful so journalists
 

6537
02:03:46,380 --> 02:03:47,930
narratives are useful so journalists
will just throw stuff out there and see

6538
02:03:47,930 --> 02:03:47,940
will just throw stuff out there and see
 

6539
02:03:47,940 --> 02:03:50,870
will just throw stuff out there and see
if it gets clicks and sure

6540
02:03:50,870 --> 02:03:50,880
if it gets clicks and sure
 

6541
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:53,270
if it gets clicks and sure
um it all it's it's like a first Spark

6542
02:03:53,270 --> 02:03:53,280
um it all it's it's like a first Spark
 

6543
02:03:53,280 --> 02:03:56,990
um it all it's it's like a first Spark
maybe uh it's maybe a tiny Catalyst of

6544
02:03:56,990 --> 02:03:57,000
maybe uh it's maybe a tiny Catalyst of
 

6545
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:58,970
maybe uh it's maybe a tiny Catalyst of
the initial stuffs but it has to be

6546
02:03:58,970 --> 02:03:58,980
the initial stuffs but it has to be
 

6547
02:03:58,980 --> 02:04:01,609
the initial stuffs but it has to be
picked up by the politicians by interest

6548
02:04:01,609 --> 02:04:01,619
picked up by the politicians by interest
 

6549
02:04:01,619 --> 02:04:03,709
picked up by the politicians by interest
groups and all that kind of stuff let me

6550
02:04:03,709 --> 02:04:03,719
groups and all that kind of stuff let me
 

6551
02:04:03,719 --> 02:04:06,470
groups and all that kind of stuff let me
ask you if you want about the um

6552
02:04:06,470 --> 02:04:06,480
ask you if you want about the um
 

6553
02:04:06,480 --> 02:04:09,229
ask you if you want about the um
first part of the subtitle how climate

6554
02:04:09,229 --> 02:04:09,239
first part of the subtitle how climate
 

6555
02:04:09,239 --> 02:04:12,169
first part of the subtitle how climate
change Panic costs us trillions

6556
02:04:12,169 --> 02:04:12,179
change Panic costs us trillions
 

6557
02:04:12,179 --> 02:04:13,910
change Panic costs us trillions
how does climate change depending cost

6558
02:04:13,910 --> 02:04:13,920
how does climate change depending cost
 

6559
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:16,310
how does climate change depending cost
us trillions so we're basically deciding

6560
02:04:16,310 --> 02:04:16,320
us trillions so we're basically deciding
 

6561
02:04:16,320 --> 02:04:18,589
us trillions so we're basically deciding
to make policies that'll have fairly

6562
02:04:18,589 --> 02:04:18,599
to make policies that'll have fairly
 

6563
02:04:18,599 --> 02:04:20,990
to make policies that'll have fairly
little impact even in 50 or 100 years

6564
02:04:20,990 --> 02:04:21,000
little impact even in 50 or 100 years
 

6565
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,750
little impact even in 50 or 100 years
that literally cost trillions of dollars

6566
02:04:23,750 --> 02:04:23,760
that literally cost trillions of dollars
 

6567
02:04:23,760 --> 02:04:27,229
that literally cost trillions of dollars
so you know give you two examples so uh

6568
02:04:27,229 --> 02:04:27,239
so you know give you two examples so uh
 

6569
02:04:27,239 --> 02:04:29,390
so you know give you two examples so uh
the European Union is trying to go to

6570
02:04:29,390 --> 02:04:29,400
the European Union is trying to go to
 

6571
02:04:29,400 --> 02:04:33,050
the European Union is trying to go to
Net Zero so our attempt to go halfway

6572
02:04:33,050 --> 02:04:33,060
Net Zero so our attempt to go halfway
 

6573
02:04:33,060 --> 02:04:36,350
Net Zero so our attempt to go halfway
there by 2030 uh will cost about a

6574
02:04:36,350 --> 02:04:36,360
there by 2030 uh will cost about a
 

6575
02:04:36,360 --> 02:04:39,169
there by 2030 uh will cost about a
trillion dollars a year uh and yet the

6576
02:04:39,169 --> 02:04:39,179
trillion dollars a year uh and yet the
 

6577
02:04:39,179 --> 02:04:41,209
trillion dollars a year uh and yet the
net impact will be almost unmeasurable

6578
02:04:41,209 --> 02:04:41,219
net impact will be almost unmeasurable
 

6579
02:04:41,219 --> 02:04:43,430
net impact will be almost unmeasurable
by the end of the century why is that

6580
02:04:43,430 --> 02:04:43,440
by the end of the century why is that
 

6581
02:04:43,440 --> 02:04:45,709
by the end of the century why is that
that's because the EU and the rich

6582
02:04:45,709 --> 02:04:45,719
that's because the EU and the rich
 

6583
02:04:45,719 --> 02:04:47,930
that's because the EU and the rich
countries is a fairly small part of the

6584
02:04:47,930 --> 02:04:47,940
countries is a fairly small part of the
 

6585
02:04:47,940 --> 02:04:49,189
countries is a fairly small part of the
emissions that are going to come out in

6586
02:04:49,189 --> 02:04:49,199
emissions that are going to come out in
 

6587
02:04:49,199 --> 02:04:51,470
emissions that are going to come out in
the 21st century now we used to be a big

6588
02:04:51,470 --> 02:04:51,480
the 21st century now we used to be a big
 

6589
02:04:51,480 --> 02:04:52,910
the 21st century now we used to be a big
part of it as that's mainly because

6590
02:04:52,910 --> 02:04:52,920
part of it as that's mainly because
 

6591
02:04:52,920 --> 02:04:54,649
part of it as that's mainly because
nobody else you know it was just the US

6592
02:04:54,649 --> 02:04:54,659
nobody else you know it was just the US
 

6593
02:04:54,659 --> 02:04:56,870
nobody else you know it was just the US
and and Europe and a few others have put

6594
02:04:56,870 --> 02:04:56,880
and and Europe and a few others have put
 

6595
02:04:56,880 --> 02:04:59,689
and and Europe and a few others have put
out CO2 in the in the 20th century so we

6596
02:04:59,689 --> 02:04:59,699
out CO2 in the in the 20th century so we
 

6597
02:04:59,699 --> 02:05:01,070
out CO2 in the in the 20th century so we
used to be big

6598
02:05:01,070 --> 02:05:01,080
used to be big
 

6599
02:05:01,080 --> 02:05:03,470
used to be big
but in the 21st century will be a small

6600
02:05:03,470 --> 02:05:03,480
but in the 21st century will be a small
 

6601
02:05:03,480 --> 02:05:05,629
but in the 21st century will be a small
bit player and so we're basically

6602
02:05:05,629 --> 02:05:05,639
bit player and so we're basically
 

6603
02:05:05,639 --> 02:05:07,970
bit player and so we're basically
spending a lot of money and remember a

6604
02:05:07,970 --> 02:05:07,980
spending a lot of money and remember a
 

6605
02:05:07,980 --> 02:05:10,129
spending a lot of money and remember a
trillion dollars is a lot of money that

6606
02:05:10,129 --> 02:05:10,139
trillion dollars is a lot of money that
 

6607
02:05:10,139 --> 02:05:11,629
trillion dollars is a lot of money that
could have been spent on a lot of things

6608
02:05:11,629 --> 02:05:11,639
could have been spent on a lot of things
 

6609
02:05:11,639 --> 02:05:13,790
could have been spent on a lot of things
that could have made you know Humanity

6610
02:05:13,790 --> 02:05:13,800
that could have made you know Humanity
 

6611
02:05:13,800 --> 02:05:16,609
that could have made you know Humanity
better on something that will only make

6612
02:05:16,609 --> 02:05:16,619
better on something that will only make
 

6613
02:05:16,619 --> 02:05:19,490
better on something that will only make
us a tiny bit better now it will do some

6614
02:05:19,490 --> 02:05:19,500
us a tiny bit better now it will do some
 

6615
02:05:19,500 --> 02:05:20,270
us a tiny bit better now it will do some
good

6616
02:05:20,270 --> 02:05:20,280
good
 

6617
02:05:20,280 --> 02:05:22,370
good
but you know the reasonable estimates is

6618
02:05:22,370 --> 02:05:22,380
but you know the reasonable estimates is
 

6619
02:05:22,380 --> 02:05:24,109
but you know the reasonable estimates is
if you do a cost benefit analysis and

6620
02:05:24,109 --> 02:05:24,119
if you do a cost benefit analysis and
 

6621
02:05:24,119 --> 02:05:26,810
if you do a cost benefit analysis and
again you know technically it's really

6622
02:05:26,810 --> 02:05:26,820
again you know technically it's really
 

6623
02:05:26,820 --> 02:05:29,030
again you know technically it's really
really complicated but the basic idea is

6624
02:05:29,030 --> 02:05:29,040
really complicated but the basic idea is
 

6625
02:05:29,040 --> 02:05:30,770
really complicated but the basic idea is
very very simple you just simply say

6626
02:05:30,770 --> 02:05:30,780
very very simple you just simply say
 

6627
02:05:30,780 --> 02:05:34,010
very very simple you just simply say
what are all the costs on one side and

6628
02:05:34,010 --> 02:05:34,020
what are all the costs on one side and
 

6629
02:05:34,020 --> 02:05:35,930
what are all the costs on one side and
what are all the benefits so the costs

6630
02:05:35,930 --> 02:05:35,940
what are all the benefits so the costs
 

6631
02:05:35,940 --> 02:05:37,850
what are all the benefits so the costs
are mainly that we have to live with

6632
02:05:37,850 --> 02:05:37,860
are mainly that we have to live with
 

6633
02:05:37,860 --> 02:05:40,609
are mainly that we have to live with
more expensive energy you have to forego

6634
02:05:40,609 --> 02:05:40,619
more expensive energy you have to forego
 

6635
02:05:40,619 --> 02:05:42,890
more expensive energy you have to forego
some opportunities you have to have you

6636
02:05:42,890 --> 02:05:42,900
some opportunities you have to have you
 

6637
02:05:42,900 --> 02:05:45,050
some opportunities you have to have you
know more complicated services that kind

6638
02:05:45,050 --> 02:05:45,060
know more complicated services that kind
 

6639
02:05:45,060 --> 02:05:46,729
know more complicated services that kind
of thing the benefit is that you cut

6640
02:05:46,729 --> 02:05:46,739
of thing the benefit is that you cut
 

6641
02:05:46,739 --> 02:05:48,229
of thing the benefit is that you cut
carbon emissions and that eventually

6642
02:05:48,229 --> 02:05:48,239
carbon emissions and that eventually
 

6643
02:05:48,239 --> 02:05:50,089
carbon emissions and that eventually
means that you'll have less climate

6644
02:05:50,089 --> 02:05:50,099
means that you'll have less climate
 

6645
02:05:50,099 --> 02:05:51,470
means that you'll have less climate
damage you'll have lower temperature

6646
02:05:51,470 --> 02:05:51,480
damage you'll have lower temperature
 

6647
02:05:51,480 --> 02:05:54,530
damage you'll have lower temperature
rises and so on if you try to weigh up

6648
02:05:54,530 --> 02:05:54,540
rises and so on if you try to weigh up
 

6649
02:05:54,540 --> 02:05:58,729
rises and so on if you try to weigh up
all those it's reasonable to assume that

6650
02:05:58,729 --> 02:05:58,739
all those it's reasonable to assume that
 

6651
02:05:58,739 --> 02:06:01,250
all those it's reasonable to assume that
the EU policies will deliver for every

6652
02:06:01,250 --> 02:06:01,260
the EU policies will deliver for every
 

6653
02:06:01,260 --> 02:06:03,950
the EU policies will deliver for every
dollar you spend it'll deliver less than

6654
02:06:03,950 --> 02:06:03,960
dollar you spend it'll deliver less than
 

6655
02:06:03,960 --> 02:06:06,530
dollar you spend it'll deliver less than
a dollar probably about 30 cents back on

6656
02:06:06,530 --> 02:06:06,540
a dollar probably about 30 cents back on
 

6657
02:06:06,540 --> 02:06:08,390
a dollar probably about 30 cents back on
the dollar which is a really bad way to

6658
02:06:08,390 --> 02:06:08,400
the dollar which is a really bad way to
 

6659
02:06:08,400 --> 02:06:09,950
the dollar which is a really bad way to
spend dollars because there's lots of

6660
02:06:09,950 --> 02:06:09,960
spend dollars because there's lots of
 

6661
02:06:09,960 --> 02:06:11,270
spend dollars because there's lots of
lots of other things out in the world

6662
02:06:11,270 --> 02:06:11,280
lots of other things out in the world
 

6663
02:06:11,280 --> 02:06:13,370
lots of other things out in the world
where you could do you know multiple you

6664
02:06:13,370 --> 02:06:13,380
where you could do you know multiple you
 

6665
02:06:13,380 --> 02:06:14,629
where you could do you know multiple you
know so for instance if you think about

6666
02:06:14,629 --> 02:06:14,639
know so for instance if you think about
 

6667
02:06:14,639 --> 02:06:17,990
know so for instance if you think about
tuberculosis or uh education of small

6668
02:06:17,990 --> 02:06:18,000
tuberculosis or uh education of small
 

6669
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:19,609
tuberculosis or uh education of small
kids or nutrition for small kids and

6670
02:06:19,609 --> 02:06:19,619
kids or nutrition for small kids and
 

6671
02:06:19,619 --> 02:06:21,109
kids or nutrition for small kids and
that those kinds of things every dollar

6672
02:06:21,109 --> 02:06:21,119
that those kinds of things every dollar
 

6673
02:06:21,119 --> 02:06:23,570
that those kinds of things every dollar
you spend will do like 30 to 100 worth

6674
02:06:23,570 --> 02:06:23,580
you spend will do like 30 to 100 worth
 

6675
02:06:23,580 --> 02:06:25,609
you spend will do like 30 to 100 worth
of good so they're much much better

6676
02:06:25,609 --> 02:06:25,619
of good so they're much much better
 

6677
02:06:25,619 --> 02:06:27,310
of good so they're much much better
places where you could spend this money

6678
02:06:27,310 --> 02:06:27,320
places where you could spend this money
 

6679
02:06:27,320 --> 02:06:30,350
places where you could spend this money
likewise uh the us is thinking of going

6680
02:06:30,350 --> 02:06:30,360
likewise uh the us is thinking of going
 

6681
02:06:30,360 --> 02:06:33,169
likewise uh the us is thinking of going
Net Zero by 20 50. it's not actually

6682
02:06:33,169 --> 02:06:33,179
Net Zero by 20 50. it's not actually
 

6683
02:06:33,179 --> 02:06:35,149
Net Zero by 20 50. it's not actually
going to happen but it's sort of a thing

6684
02:06:35,149 --> 02:06:35,159
going to happen but it's sort of a thing
 

6685
02:06:35,159 --> 02:06:36,890
going to happen but it's sort of a thing
that everybody talks about Biden is

6686
02:06:36,890 --> 02:06:36,900
that everybody talks about Biden is
 

6687
02:06:36,900 --> 02:06:39,050
that everybody talks about Biden is
talking a lot about it if you look at

6688
02:06:39,050 --> 02:06:39,060
talking a lot about it if you look at
 

6689
02:06:39,060 --> 02:06:41,810
talking a lot about it if you look at
the models that indicate how how much

6690
02:06:41,810 --> 02:06:41,820
the models that indicate how how much
 

6691
02:06:41,820 --> 02:06:44,570
the models that indicate how how much
will that cost it's not impossible that

6692
02:06:44,570 --> 02:06:44,580
will that cost it's not impossible that
 

6693
02:06:44,580 --> 02:06:46,370
will that cost it's not impossible that
this will cost somewhere between two and

6694
02:06:46,370 --> 02:06:46,380
this will cost somewhere between two and
 

6695
02:06:46,380 --> 02:06:48,830
this will cost somewhere between two and
four trillion dollars per year by

6696
02:06:48,830 --> 02:06:48,840
four trillion dollars per year by
 

6697
02:06:48,840 --> 02:06:52,430
four trillion dollars per year by
mid-century and remember if the US went

6698
02:06:52,430 --> 02:06:52,440
mid-century and remember if the US went
 

6699
02:06:52,440 --> 02:06:55,189
mid-century and remember if the US went
carbon neutral today

6700
02:06:55,189 --> 02:06:55,199
carbon neutral today
 

6701
02:06:55,199 --> 02:06:57,109
carbon neutral today
by the end of the century that would

6702
02:06:57,109 --> 02:06:57,119
by the end of the century that would
 

6703
02:06:57,119 --> 02:06:59,390
by the end of the century that would
reduce temperatures by about 0.3 degree

6704
02:06:59,390 --> 02:06:59,400
reduce temperatures by about 0.3 degree
 

6705
02:06:59,400 --> 02:07:00,350
reduce temperatures by about 0.3 degree
Fahrenheit

6706
02:07:00,350 --> 02:07:00,360
Fahrenheit
 

6707
02:07:00,360 --> 02:07:03,109
Fahrenheit
so you would just be able to measure it

6708
02:07:03,109 --> 02:07:03,119
so you would just be able to measure it
 

6709
02:07:03,119 --> 02:07:04,970
so you would just be able to measure it
probably wouldn't in real life but you

6710
02:07:04,970 --> 02:07:04,980
probably wouldn't in real life but you
 

6711
02:07:04,980 --> 02:07:06,830
probably wouldn't in real life but you
know if you'd just be able to measure it

6712
02:07:06,830 --> 02:07:06,840
know if you'd just be able to measure it
 

6713
02:07:06,840 --> 02:07:09,050
know if you'd just be able to measure it
again this is not saying that there's

6714
02:07:09,050 --> 02:07:09,060
again this is not saying that there's
 

6715
02:07:09,060 --> 02:07:10,550
again this is not saying that there's
not some good coming out of it but

6716
02:07:10,550 --> 02:07:10,560
not some good coming out of it but
 

6717
02:07:10,560 --> 02:07:12,290
not some good coming out of it but
you're basically spending an enormous

6718
02:07:12,290 --> 02:07:12,300
you're basically spending an enormous
 

6719
02:07:12,300 --> 02:07:14,510
you're basically spending an enormous
amount of money on fairly small benefits

6720
02:07:14,510 --> 02:07:14,520
amount of money on fairly small benefits
 

6721
02:07:14,520 --> 02:07:17,270
amount of money on fairly small benefits
so that's that's my main point yeah this

6722
02:07:17,270 --> 02:07:17,280
so that's that's my main point yeah this
 

6723
02:07:17,280 --> 02:07:18,410
so that's that's my main point yeah this
reminds me of what we were saying

6724
02:07:18,410 --> 02:07:18,420
reminds me of what we were saying
 

6725
02:07:18,420 --> 02:07:20,209
reminds me of what we were saying
earlier about um

6726
02:07:20,209 --> 02:07:20,219
earlier about um
 

6727
02:07:20,219 --> 02:07:22,250
earlier about um
the things that models don't integrate

6728
02:07:22,250 --> 02:07:22,260
the things that models don't integrate
 

6729
02:07:22,260 --> 02:07:24,050
the things that models don't integrate
and the things that cost benefit leave

6730
02:07:24,050 --> 02:07:24,060
and the things that cost benefit leave
 

6731
02:07:24,060 --> 02:07:26,450
and the things that cost benefit leave
out because you really can't go there

6732
02:07:26,450 --> 02:07:26,460
out because you really can't go there
 

6733
02:07:26,460 --> 02:07:28,129
out because you really can't go there
one of the issues facing the world right

6734
02:07:28,129 --> 02:07:28,139
one of the issues facing the world right
 

6735
02:07:28,139 --> 02:07:30,169
one of the issues facing the world right
now is the reality that we're reminded

6736
02:07:30,169 --> 02:07:30,179
now is the reality that we're reminded
 

6737
02:07:30,179 --> 02:07:32,450
now is the reality that we're reminded
of that energy availability is a

6738
02:07:32,450 --> 02:07:32,460
of that energy availability is a
 

6739
02:07:32,460 --> 02:07:33,729
of that energy availability is a
geopolitical

6740
02:07:33,729 --> 02:07:33,739
geopolitical
 

6741
02:07:33,739 --> 02:07:37,850
geopolitical
destabilizer if you have uneven access

6742
02:07:37,850 --> 02:07:37,860
destabilizer if you have uneven access
 

6743
02:07:37,860 --> 02:07:39,050
destabilizer if you have uneven access
to energy

6744
02:07:39,050 --> 02:07:39,060
to energy
 

6745
02:07:39,060 --> 02:07:40,970
to energy
and you have Vladimir Putin coming into

6746
02:07:40,970 --> 02:07:40,980
and you have Vladimir Putin coming into
 

6747
02:07:40,980 --> 02:07:43,010
and you have Vladimir Putin coming into
office or something else happening

6748
02:07:43,010 --> 02:07:43,020
office or something else happening
 

6749
02:07:43,020 --> 02:07:45,410
office or something else happening
that disrupts that system you're you're

6750
02:07:45,410 --> 02:07:45,420
that disrupts that system you're you're
 

6751
02:07:45,420 --> 02:07:48,350
that disrupts that system you're you're
vastly increasing poverty you this is

6752
02:07:48,350 --> 02:07:48,360
vastly increasing poverty you this is
 

6753
02:07:48,360 --> 02:07:50,570
vastly increasing poverty you this is
playing out across the world fertilizer

6754
02:07:50,570 --> 02:07:50,580
playing out across the world fertilizer
 

6755
02:07:50,580 --> 02:07:53,149
playing out across the world fertilizer
process fertilizer comes from gas

6756
02:07:53,149 --> 02:07:53,159
process fertilizer comes from gas
 

6757
02:07:53,159 --> 02:07:55,310
process fertilizer comes from gas
um natural gas

6758
02:07:55,310 --> 02:07:55,320
um natural gas
 

6759
02:07:55,320 --> 02:07:58,790
um natural gas
um if you can Envision a world later in

6760
02:07:58,790 --> 02:07:58,800
um if you can Envision a world later in
 

6761
02:07:58,800 --> 02:08:00,649
um if you can Envision a world later in
the century where we're no longer

6762
02:08:00,649 --> 02:08:00,659
the century where we're no longer
 

6763
02:08:00,659 --> 02:08:02,209
the century where we're no longer
beholden on this material in the ground

6764
02:08:02,209 --> 02:08:02,219
beholden on this material in the ground
 

6765
02:08:02,219 --> 02:08:05,270
beholden on this material in the ground
at least fossil fuels you know Cobalt

6766
02:08:05,270 --> 02:08:05,280
at least fossil fuels you know Cobalt
 

6767
02:08:05,280 --> 02:08:07,250
at least fossil fuels you know Cobalt
and lithium for batteries

6768
02:08:07,250 --> 02:08:07,260
and lithium for batteries
 

6769
02:08:07,260 --> 02:08:08,930
and lithium for batteries
that's pretty cool you know because

6770
02:08:08,930 --> 02:08:08,940
that's pretty cool you know because
 

6771
02:08:08,940 --> 02:08:10,910
that's pretty cool you know because
you're taking away geopolitical

6772
02:08:10,910 --> 02:08:10,920
you're taking away geopolitical
 

6773
02:08:10,920 --> 02:08:13,250
you're taking away geopolitical
instability and

6774
02:08:13,250 --> 02:08:13,260
instability and
 

6775
02:08:13,260 --> 02:08:14,930
instability and
you don't but that's not factored in

6776
02:08:14,930 --> 02:08:14,940
you don't but that's not factored in
 

6777
02:08:14,940 --> 02:08:16,250
you don't but that's not factored in
right that's like way outside of what

6778
02:08:16,250 --> 02:08:16,260
right that's like way outside of what
 

6779
02:08:16,260 --> 02:08:18,229
right that's like way outside of what
you'd factor in but it does feel like to

6780
02:08:18,229 --> 02:08:18,239
you'd factor in but it does feel like to
 

6781
02:08:18,239 --> 02:08:19,970
you'd factor in but it does feel like to
me you know if I was going to make the

6782
02:08:19,970 --> 02:08:19,980
me you know if I was going to make the
 

6783
02:08:19,980 --> 02:08:21,890
me you know if I was going to make the
case for

6784
02:08:21,890 --> 02:08:21,900
case for
 

6785
02:08:21,900 --> 02:08:23,629
case for
you can choose your trillions whatever

6786
02:08:23,629 --> 02:08:23,639
you can choose your trillions whatever
 

6787
02:08:23,639 --> 02:08:26,270
you can choose your trillions whatever
that investing big

6788
02:08:26,270 --> 02:08:26,280
that investing big
 

6789
02:08:26,280 --> 02:08:29,450
that investing big
isn't for these marginal things it's for

6790
02:08:29,450 --> 02:08:29,460
isn't for these marginal things it's for
 

6791
02:08:29,460 --> 02:08:31,550
isn't for these marginal things it's for
looking at the big picture of Worlds of

6792
02:08:31,550 --> 02:08:31,560
looking at the big picture of Worlds of
 

6793
02:08:31,560 --> 02:08:33,890
looking at the big picture of Worlds of
abundant energy that doesn't come from

6794
02:08:33,890 --> 02:08:33,900
abundant energy that doesn't come from
 

6795
02:08:33,900 --> 02:08:37,010
abundant energy that doesn't come from
from a black rock or a gooey liquid that

6796
02:08:37,010 --> 02:08:37,020
from a black rock or a gooey liquid that
 

6797
02:08:37,020 --> 02:08:39,050
from a black rock or a gooey liquid that
when you burn it creates but isn't that

6798
02:08:39,050 --> 02:08:39,060
when you burn it creates but isn't that
 

6799
02:08:39,060 --> 02:08:42,770
when you burn it creates but isn't that
what the proposals are is investing in

6800
02:08:42,770 --> 02:08:42,780
what the proposals are is investing in
 

6801
02:08:42,780 --> 02:08:44,270
what the proposals are is investing in
different kinds of energy renewable

6802
02:08:44,270 --> 02:08:44,280
different kinds of energy renewable
 

6803
02:08:44,280 --> 02:08:46,010
different kinds of energy renewable
energy so what is but I don't think most

6804
02:08:46,010 --> 02:08:46,020
energy so what is but I don't think most
 

6805
02:08:46,020 --> 02:08:48,109
energy so what is but I don't think most
people are making that case what's in

6806
02:08:48,109 --> 02:08:48,119
people are making that case what's in
 

6807
02:08:48,119 --> 02:08:51,109
people are making that case what's in
the in the trillion and the T costs

6808
02:08:51,109 --> 02:08:51,119
the in the trillion and the T costs
 

6809
02:08:51,119 --> 02:08:52,490
the in the trillion and the T costs
what's in corporate what are the big

6810
02:08:52,490 --> 02:08:52,500
what's in corporate what are the big
 

6811
02:08:52,500 --> 02:08:55,129
what's in corporate what are the big
costs there so the big cost is that you

6812
02:08:55,129 --> 02:08:55,139
costs there so the big cost is that you
 

6813
02:08:55,139 --> 02:08:58,250
costs there so the big cost is that you
have slightly lower productivity gains

6814
02:08:58,250 --> 02:08:58,260
have slightly lower productivity gains
 

6815
02:08:58,260 --> 02:09:00,350
have slightly lower productivity gains
so basically again you know this is sort

6816
02:09:00,350 --> 02:09:00,360
so basically again you know this is sort
 

6817
02:09:00,360 --> 02:09:01,850
so basically again you know this is sort
of the opposite of what we just talked

6818
02:09:01,850 --> 02:09:01,860
of the opposite of what we just talked
 

6819
02:09:01,860 --> 02:09:03,709
of the opposite of what we just talked
about by climate change we're we're

6820
02:09:03,709 --> 02:09:03,719
about by climate change we're we're
 

6821
02:09:03,719 --> 02:09:05,209
about by climate change we're we're
going to get richer and richer in the

6822
02:09:05,209 --> 02:09:05,219
going to get richer and richer in the
 

6823
02:09:05,219 --> 02:09:07,189
going to get richer and richer in the
world this is all models also the UN

6824
02:09:07,189 --> 02:09:07,199
world this is all models also the UN
 

6825
02:09:07,199 --> 02:09:09,050
world this is all models also the UN
this is really the only way that you can

6826
02:09:09,050 --> 02:09:09,060
this is really the only way that you can
 

6827
02:09:09,060 --> 02:09:10,729
this is really the only way that you can
get big climate changes because

6828
02:09:10,729 --> 02:09:10,739
get big climate changes because
 

6829
02:09:10,739 --> 02:09:12,709
get big climate changes because
everybody gets a lot richer so also the

6830
02:09:12,709 --> 02:09:12,719
everybody gets a lot richer so also the
 

6831
02:09:12,719 --> 02:09:14,570
everybody gets a lot richer so also the
developing world gets a lot richer so

6832
02:09:14,570 --> 02:09:14,580
developing world gets a lot richer so
 

6833
02:09:14,580 --> 02:09:17,030
developing world gets a lot richer so
we're likely to get richer but one of

6834
02:09:17,030 --> 02:09:17,040
we're likely to get richer but one of
 

6835
02:09:17,040 --> 02:09:18,830
we're likely to get richer but one of
the things that drive uh wealth

6836
02:09:18,830 --> 02:09:18,840
the things that drive uh wealth
 

6837
02:09:18,840 --> 02:09:20,810
the things that drive uh wealth
production is the fact that we have

6838
02:09:20,810 --> 02:09:20,820
production is the fact that we have
 

6839
02:09:20,820 --> 02:09:24,290
production is the fact that we have
ample and cheap and available energy if

6840
02:09:24,290 --> 02:09:24,300
ample and cheap and available energy if
 

6841
02:09:24,300 --> 02:09:26,270
ample and cheap and available energy if
you make that slightly harder which is

6842
02:09:26,270 --> 02:09:26,280
you make that slightly harder which is
 

6843
02:09:26,280 --> 02:09:28,250
you make that slightly harder which is
what you do with climate legislation

6844
02:09:28,250 --> 02:09:28,260
what you do with climate legislation
 

6845
02:09:28,260 --> 02:09:29,390
what you do with climate legislation
because you're basically telling people

6846
02:09:29,390 --> 02:09:29,400
because you're basically telling people
 

6847
02:09:29,400 --> 02:09:31,609
because you're basically telling people
people you have to use a source of

6848
02:09:31,609 --> 02:09:31,619
people you have to use a source of
 

6849
02:09:31,619 --> 02:09:33,350
people you have to use a source of
energy that you'd rather not have used

6850
02:09:33,350 --> 02:09:33,360
energy that you'd rather not have used
 

6851
02:09:33,360 --> 02:09:35,870
energy that you'd rather not have used
had because if people wanted to do it

6852
02:09:35,870 --> 02:09:35,880
had because if people wanted to do it
 

6853
02:09:35,880 --> 02:09:37,669
had because if people wanted to do it
we'd already solved the problem so

6854
02:09:37,669 --> 02:09:37,679
we'd already solved the problem so
 

6855
02:09:37,679 --> 02:09:38,930
we'd already solved the problem so
you're basically tell them you've got to

6856
02:09:38,930 --> 02:09:38,940
you're basically tell them you've got to
 

6857
02:09:38,940 --> 02:09:41,750
you're basically tell them you've got to
use this wind turbine instead of this uh

6858
02:09:41,750 --> 02:09:41,760
use this wind turbine instead of this uh
 

6859
02:09:41,760 --> 02:09:44,030
use this wind turbine instead of this uh
natural gas plant or you know that kind

6860
02:09:44,030 --> 02:09:44,040
natural gas plant or you know that kind
 

6861
02:09:44,040 --> 02:09:46,430
natural gas plant or you know that kind
of thing it makes it's it's not that you

6862
02:09:46,430 --> 02:09:46,440
of thing it makes it's it's not that you
 

6863
02:09:46,440 --> 02:09:48,109
of thing it makes it's it's not that you
suddenly become poor or anything it

6864
02:09:48,109 --> 02:09:48,119
suddenly become poor or anything it
 

6865
02:09:48,119 --> 02:09:50,270
suddenly become poor or anything it
simply makes production slightly harder

6866
02:09:50,270 --> 02:09:50,280
simply makes production slightly harder
 

6867
02:09:50,280 --> 02:09:52,189
simply makes production slightly harder
what do you do when when the wind is not

6868
02:09:52,189 --> 02:09:52,199
what do you do when when the wind is not
 

6869
02:09:52,199 --> 02:09:53,750
what do you do when when the wind is not
blowing kind of thing and of course we

6870
02:09:53,750 --> 02:09:53,760
blowing kind of thing and of course we
 

6871
02:09:53,760 --> 02:09:55,970
blowing kind of thing and of course we
have lots of ways to somewhat mitigate

6872
02:09:55,970 --> 02:09:55,980
have lots of ways to somewhat mitigate
 

6873
02:09:55,980 --> 02:09:57,890
have lots of ways to somewhat mitigate
that but it's a little more costly a

6874
02:09:57,890 --> 02:09:57,900
that but it's a little more costly a
 

6875
02:09:57,900 --> 02:09:59,450
that but it's a little more costly a
little more complicated a little less

6876
02:09:59,450 --> 02:09:59,460
little more complicated a little less
 

6877
02:09:59,460 --> 02:10:01,790
little more complicated a little less
convenient and that means you grow a

6878

convenient and that means you grow a
 

6879
02:10:01,800 --> 02:10:04,669
convenient and that means you grow a
little less that's the main problem with

6880
02:10:04,669 --> 02:10:04,679
little less that's the main problem with
 

6881
02:10:04,679 --> 02:10:06,589
little less that's the main problem with
with these policies that it simply makes

6882
02:10:06,589 --> 02:10:06,599
with these policies that it simply makes
 

6883
02:10:06,599 --> 02:10:08,990
with these policies that it simply makes
you somewhat less well-off the energy

6884
02:10:08,990 --> 02:10:09,000
you somewhat less well-off the energy
 

6885
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:12,770
you somewhat less well-off the energy
becomes more inefficient yes so let me

6886
02:10:12,770 --> 02:10:12,780
becomes more inefficient yes so let me
 

6887
02:10:12,780 --> 02:10:14,589
becomes more inefficient yes so let me
challenge you here

6888
02:10:14,589 --> 02:10:14,599
challenge you here
 

6889
02:10:14,599 --> 02:10:18,709
challenge you here
uh try to steal man some critics so you

but just on this point in terms of one
 

6911
02:10:43,199 --> 02:10:46,010
but just on this point in terms of one
of the big cause being an energy

6912
02:10:46,010 --> 02:10:46,020
of the big cause being an energy

6921
02:10:59,159 --> 02:11:02,930

with well you're cherry picking the

6924
02:11:05,450 --> 02:11:05,460
with well you're cherry picking the
 

6925
02:11:05,460 --> 02:11:07,790
with well you're cherry picking the
models which the models are always

models which the models are always
 

6927
02:11:07,800 --> 02:11:11,149
models which the models are always
cherry picking and you anyway so um but

02:11:11,149 --> 02:11:11,159
cherry picking and you anyway so um but
 

6929
02:11:11,159 --> 02:11:12,290

you know you want to take those

6930

you know you want to take those
 

6931
02:11:12,300 --> 02:11:15,229

ignore
 

6935
02:11:16,440 --> 02:11:21,530
ignore
you're not uh fully modeling the costs

6936
02:11:21,530 --> 02:11:21,540
you're not uh fully modeling the costs
 

6937
02:11:21,540 --> 02:11:25,010
you're not uh fully modeling the costs
the the trade-off here how expensive is

6938
02:11:25,010 --> 02:11:25,020
the the trade-off here how expensive is
 

6939
02:11:25,020 --> 02:11:27,290
the the trade-off here how expensive is
the renewable energy and how expensive

the renewable energy and how expensive
 

6941
02:11:27,300 --> 02:11:29,209
the renewable energy and how expensive
is the fossil fuel can you still manage

6942
02:11:29,209 --> 02:11:29,219
is the fossil fuel can you still manage
 

6943

case sure so uh two things uh uh the

6944
02:11:33,050 --> 02:11:33,060
case sure so uh two things uh uh the

first the quote it's absolutely true

6946
02:11:35,450 --> 02:11:35,460
first the quote it's absolutely true
 

6947
02:11:35,460 --> 02:11:39,050
first the quote it's absolutely true
that the world spends a large a chunk of

that the world spends a large a chunk of
 

6949
02:11:39,060 --> 02:11:41,030
that the world spends a large a chunk of
money on fossil fuels and that's just

6950
02:11:41,030 --> 02:11:41,040
money on fossil fuels and that's just
 

6951
02:11:41,040 --> 02:11:43,250
money on fossil fuels and that's just
stupid and we should stop doing it we

6952
02:11:43,250 --> 02:11:43,260
stupid and we should stop doing it we
 

6953
02:11:43,260 --> 02:11:45,050
stupid and we should stop doing it we
should also recognize that this is not

6954
02:11:45,050 --> 02:11:45,060
should also recognize that this is not
 

6955
02:11:45,060 --> 02:11:47,030
should also recognize that this is not
rich countries this is not the countries

rich countries this is not the countries
 

6957
02:11:47,040 --> 02:11:48,410
rich countries this is not the countries
where we're talking about climate change

where we're talking about climate change
 

6959
02:11:48,420 --> 02:11:50,390
where we're talking about climate change
this is poor countries this is Saudi

terribly poor country uh it's China it's
 

6965
02:11:55,380 --> 02:11:58,790
terribly poor country uh it's China it's
Indonesia it's uh uh Russia uh it's

6966
02:11:58,790 --> 02:11:58,800
Indonesia it's uh uh Russia uh it's
 

6967
02:11:58,800 --> 02:12:01,129
Indonesia it's uh uh Russia uh it's
places where you're basically paying off

6968
02:12:01,129 --> 02:12:01,139
places where you're basically paying off
 

6969
02:12:01,139 --> 02:12:02,810
places where you're basically paying off
your population just like that you

6970
02:12:02,810 --> 02:12:02,820
your population just like that you
 

6971
02:12:02,820 --> 02:12:04,850
your population just like that you
subsidized bread you make sure that they

6972
02:12:04,850 --> 02:12:04,860
subsidized bread you make sure that they
 

6973
02:12:04,860 --> 02:12:07,729
subsidized bread you make sure that they
don't rebel by making cheap uh fuels

6974
02:12:07,729 --> 02:12:07,739
don't rebel by making cheap uh fuels
 

6975
02:12:07,739 --> 02:12:10,070
don't rebel by making cheap uh fuels
available that's dumb but it's not like

6976
02:12:10,070 --> 02:12:10,080
available that's dumb but it's not like
 

6977
02:12:10,080 --> 02:12:11,510
available that's dumb but it's not like
they you know they don't know what

6978
02:12:11,510 --> 02:12:11,520
they you know they don't know what
 

6979
02:12:11,520 --> 02:12:12,770
they you know they don't know what
they're doing they're mostly doing this

6980
02:12:12,770 --> 02:12:12,780
they're doing they're mostly doing this
 

6981
02:12:12,780 --> 02:12:14,629
they're doing they're mostly doing this
for things that have nothing to do with

6982
02:12:14,629 --> 02:12:14,639
for things that have nothing to do with
 

6983
02:12:14,639 --> 02:12:16,790
for things that have nothing to do with
climate so I totally agree we should get

6984
02:12:16,790 --> 02:12:16,800
climate so I totally agree we should get
 

6985
02:12:16,800 --> 02:12:19,129
climate so I totally agree we should get
rid of it it's hard to do Indonesia is

6986
02:12:19,129 --> 02:12:19,139
rid of it it's hard to do Indonesia is
 

6987
02:12:19,139 --> 02:12:21,890
rid of it it's hard to do Indonesia is
actually somewhat uh managed to to get

6988
02:12:21,890 --> 02:12:21,900
actually somewhat uh managed to to get
 

6989
02:12:21,900 --> 02:12:23,450
actually somewhat uh managed to to get
rid of it because remember if you spend

6990
02:12:23,450 --> 02:12:23,460
rid of it because remember if you spend
 

6991
02:12:23,460 --> 02:12:25,070
rid of it because remember if you spend
a lot of money on fossil fuel subsidies

6992
02:12:25,070 --> 02:12:25,080
a lot of money on fossil fuel subsidies
 

6993
02:12:25,080 --> 02:12:26,930
a lot of money on fossil fuel subsidies
you're basically subsidizing the rich

6994
02:12:26,930 --> 02:12:26,940
you're basically subsidizing the rich
 

6995
02:12:26,940 --> 02:12:28,850
you're basically subsidizing the rich
because you know poor people don't have

6996
02:12:28,850 --> 02:12:28,860
because you know poor people don't have
 

6997
02:12:28,860 --> 02:12:30,770
because you know poor people don't have
a car it's the rich people who can now

6998
02:12:30,770 --> 02:12:30,780
a car it's the rich people who can now
 

6999
02:12:30,780 --> 02:12:32,750
a car it's the rich people who can now
buy you know a very cheap gasoline

7000
02:12:32,750 --> 02:12:32,760
buy you know a very cheap gasoline
 

7001
02:12:32,760 --> 02:12:36,169
buy you know a very cheap gasoline
that's you know that's unjust as well so

7002
02:12:36,169 --> 02:12:36,179
that's you know that's unjust as well so
 

7003
02:12:36,179 --> 02:12:38,450
that's you know that's unjust as well so
it's dumb in so many different ways I

7004
02:12:38,450 --> 02:12:38,460
it's dumb in so many different ways I
 

7005
02:12:38,460 --> 02:12:40,070
it's dumb in so many different ways I
would never argue that you shouldn't

7006
02:12:40,070 --> 02:12:40,080
would never argue that you shouldn't
 

7007
02:12:40,080 --> 02:12:42,530
would never argue that you shouldn't
done I've plenty of time said we should

7008
02:12:42,530 --> 02:12:42,540
done I've plenty of time said we should
 

7009
02:12:42,540 --> 02:12:44,689
done I've plenty of time said we should
stop that but we should also recognize

7010
02:12:44,689 --> 02:12:44,699
stop that but we should also recognize
 

7011
02:12:44,699 --> 02:12:46,970
stop that but we should also recognize
these are mostly regimes that are not

7012
02:12:46,970 --> 02:12:46,980
these are mostly regimes that are not
 

7013
02:12:46,980 --> 02:12:49,129
these are mostly regimes that are not
going to be taken over either by my

7014
02:12:49,129 --> 02:12:49,139
going to be taken over either by my
 

7015
02:12:49,139 --> 02:12:51,050
going to be taken over either by my
argument or Bob Wards or anyone else's

7016
02:12:51,050 --> 02:12:51,060
argument or Bob Wards or anyone else's
 

7017
02:12:51,060 --> 02:12:52,790
argument or Bob Wards or anyone else's
they're doing this for totally different

7018
02:12:52,790 --> 02:12:52,800
they're doing this for totally different
 

7019
02:12:52,800 --> 02:12:55,910
they're doing this for totally different
reasons now on the model side

7020
02:12:55,910 --> 02:12:55,920
reasons now on the model side
 

7021
02:12:55,920 --> 02:12:59,270
reasons now on the model side
there is virtually no model that don't

7022
02:12:59,270 --> 02:12:59,280
there is virtually no model that don't
 

7023
02:12:59,280 --> 02:13:01,430
there is virtually no model that don't
show economic model that don't show this

7024
02:13:01,430 --> 02:13:01,440
show economic model that don't show this
 

7025
02:13:01,440 --> 02:13:03,470
show economic model that don't show this
has a cost and that's the fundamental

7026
02:13:03,470 --> 02:13:03,480
has a cost and that's the fundamental
 

7027
02:13:03,480 --> 02:13:06,530
has a cost and that's the fundamental
point is that the you know this is sort

7028
02:13:06,530 --> 02:13:06,540
point is that the you know this is sort
 

7029
02:13:06,540 --> 02:13:08,990
point is that the you know this is sort
of a basic point from from economics the

7030
02:13:08,990 --> 02:13:09,000
of a basic point from from economics the
 

7031
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:10,669
of a basic point from from economics the
system is already working most

7032
02:13:10,669 --> 02:13:10,679
system is already working most
 

7033
02:13:10,679 --> 02:13:12,649
system is already working most
effectively because if it wasn't you

7034
02:13:12,649 --> 02:13:12,659
effectively because if it wasn't you
 

7035
02:13:12,659 --> 02:13:13,729
effectively because if it wasn't you
know you could actually make money

7036
02:13:13,729 --> 02:13:13,739
know you could actually make money
 

7037
02:13:13,739 --> 02:13:17,089
know you could actually make money
changing over so if you want to have a

7038
02:13:17,089 --> 02:13:17,099
changing over so if you want to have a
 

7039
02:13:17,099 --> 02:13:18,770
changing over so if you want to have a
change outside of what the system is

7040
02:13:18,770 --> 02:13:18,780
change outside of what the system is
 

7041
02:13:18,780 --> 02:13:20,629
change outside of what the system is
already doing it's because you're saying

7042
02:13:20,629 --> 02:13:20,639
already doing it's because you're saying
 

7043
02:13:20,639 --> 02:13:22,310
already doing it's because you're saying
you have to do something that you rather

7044
02:13:22,310 --> 02:13:22,320
you have to do something that you rather
 

7045
02:13:22,320 --> 02:13:24,229
you have to do something that you rather
not want to do namely use an energy

7046
02:13:24,229 --> 02:13:24,239
not want to do namely use an energy
 

7047
02:13:24,239 --> 02:13:26,229
not want to do namely use an energy
source that is less convenient or less

7048
02:13:26,229 --> 02:13:26,239
source that is less convenient or less
 

7049
02:13:26,239 --> 02:13:29,450
source that is less convenient or less
cost effective and so on and that will

7050
02:13:29,450 --> 02:13:29,460
cost effective and so on and that will
 

7051
02:13:29,460 --> 02:13:31,970
cost effective and so on and that will
incur a cost now there's a huge

7052
02:13:31,970 --> 02:13:31,980
incur a cost now there's a huge
 

7053
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:33,890
incur a cost now there's a huge
discussion about just exactly how much

7054
02:13:33,890 --> 02:13:33,900
discussion about just exactly how much
 

7055
02:13:33,900 --> 02:13:35,750
discussion about just exactly how much
cost is that so there's definitely a

7056
02:13:35,750 --> 02:13:35,760
cost is that so there's definitely a
 

7057
02:13:35,760 --> 02:13:38,209
cost is that so there's definitely a
cost is the cost going to be one or five

7058
02:13:38,209 --> 02:13:38,219
cost is the cost going to be one or five
 

7059
02:13:38,219 --> 02:13:40,550
cost is the cost going to be one or five
trillion that's absolutely a discussion

7060
02:13:40,550 --> 02:13:40,560
trillion that's absolutely a discussion
 

7061
02:13:40,560 --> 02:13:42,050
trillion that's absolutely a discussion
about where do you take your models from

7062
02:13:42,050 --> 02:13:42,060
about where do you take your models from
 

7063
02:13:42,060 --> 02:13:44,629
about where do you take your models from
I try to do and and again this is not

7064
02:13:44,629 --> 02:13:44,639
I try to do and and again this is not
 

7065
02:13:44,639 --> 02:13:46,430
I try to do and and again this is not
possible everywhere I try to actually

7066
02:13:46,430 --> 02:13:46,440
possible everywhere I try to actually
 

7067
02:13:46,440 --> 02:13:49,370
possible everywhere I try to actually
take the average of all of the economic

7068
02:13:49,370 --> 02:13:49,380
take the average of all of the economic
 

7069
02:13:49,380 --> 02:13:51,229
take the average of all of the economic
models so there's a there's a group

7070
02:13:51,229 --> 02:13:51,239
models so there's a there's a group
 

7071
02:13:51,239 --> 02:13:52,790
models so there's a there's a group
called the Stanford energy modeling

7072
02:13:52,790 --> 02:13:52,800
called the Stanford energy modeling
 

7073
02:13:52,800 --> 02:13:55,010
called the Stanford energy modeling
Forum which tries to pull together all

7074
02:13:55,010 --> 02:13:55,020
Forum which tries to pull together all
 

7075
02:13:55,020 --> 02:13:56,990
Forum which tries to pull together all
these different groups that do the

7076
02:13:56,990 --> 02:13:57,000
these different groups that do the
 

7077
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,270
these different groups that do the
modeling so some models a lot of this

7078
02:13:59,270 --> 02:13:59,280
modeling so some models a lot of this
 

7079
02:13:59,280 --> 02:14:02,510
modeling so some models a lot of this
cost actually comes down to uh uh the

7080
02:14:02,510 --> 02:14:02,520
cost actually comes down to uh uh the
 

7081
02:14:02,520 --> 02:14:04,250
cost actually comes down to uh uh the
fact that we don't quite know how much

7082
02:14:04,250 --> 02:14:04,260
fact that we don't quite know how much
 

7083
02:14:04,260 --> 02:14:05,870
fact that we don't quite know how much
more fossil fuels you're going to need

7084
02:14:05,870 --> 02:14:05,880
more fossil fuels you're going to need
 

7085
02:14:05,880 --> 02:14:07,970
more fossil fuels you're going to need
in the future and so if you're not gonna

7086
02:14:07,970 --> 02:14:07,980
in the future and so if you're not gonna
 

7087
02:14:07,980 --> 02:14:09,589
in the future and so if you're not gonna
if your projections are you're not going

7088
02:14:09,589 --> 02:14:09,599
if your projections are you're not going
 

7089
02:14:09,599 --> 02:14:11,810
if your projections are you're not going
to use that much the cost of reducing it

7090
02:14:11,810 --> 02:14:11,820
to use that much the cost of reducing it
 

7091
02:14:11,820 --> 02:14:13,370
to use that much the cost of reducing it
is going to be very small if you think

7092
02:14:13,370 --> 02:14:13,380
is going to be very small if you think
 

7093
02:14:13,380 --> 02:14:15,589
is going to be very small if you think
you're going to use a ton of extra

7094
02:14:15,589 --> 02:14:15,599
you're going to use a ton of extra
 

7095
02:14:15,599 --> 02:14:17,689
you're going to use a ton of extra
fossil fuels and you have to reduce that

7096
02:14:17,689 --> 02:14:17,699
fossil fuels and you have to reduce that
 

7097
02:14:17,699 --> 02:14:19,910
fossil fuels and you have to reduce that
the cost is going to be bigger so I

7098
02:14:19,910 --> 02:14:19,920
the cost is going to be bigger so I
 

7099
02:14:19,920 --> 02:14:21,589
the cost is going to be bigger so I
think that's just one of the variables

7100
02:14:21,589 --> 02:14:21,599
think that's just one of the variables
 

7101
02:14:21,599 --> 02:14:23,629
think that's just one of the variables
that's oh yeah yeah and there's many

7102
02:14:23,629 --> 02:14:23,639
that's oh yeah yeah and there's many
 

7103
02:14:23,639 --> 02:14:25,850
that's oh yeah yeah and there's many
many many more I think the the point

7104
02:14:25,850 --> 02:14:25,860
many many more I think the the point
 

7105
02:14:25,860 --> 02:14:28,250
many many more I think the the point
here is to say that if you take the

7106
02:14:28,250 --> 02:14:28,260
here is to say that if you take the
 

7107
02:14:28,260 --> 02:14:31,069
here is to say that if you take the
average of all the best model is a sort

7108
02:14:31,069 --> 02:14:31,079
average of all the best model is a sort
 

7109
02:14:31,079 --> 02:14:32,629
average of all the best model is a sort
of aggregated for instance at the

7110
02:14:32,629 --> 02:14:32,639
of aggregated for instance at the
 

7111
02:14:32,639 --> 02:14:34,850
of aggregated for instance at the
Stanford energy modeling form you're

7112
02:14:34,850 --> 02:14:34,860
Stanford energy modeling form you're
 

7113
02:14:34,860 --> 02:14:36,950
Stanford energy modeling form you're
pretty secure ground

7114
02:14:36,950 --> 02:14:36,960
pretty secure ground
 

7115
02:14:36,960 --> 02:14:40,370
pretty secure ground
and and uh so so again I I would argue

7116
02:14:40,370 --> 02:14:40,380
and and uh so so again I I would argue
 

7117
02:14:40,380 --> 02:14:43,729
and and uh so so again I I would argue
that uh Bob Ward yes I've had a lot of

7118
02:14:43,729 --> 02:14:43,739
that uh Bob Ward yes I've had a lot of
 

7119
02:14:43,739 --> 02:14:46,370
that uh Bob Ward yes I've had a lot of
run-ins with Bob board uh uh and and he

7120
02:14:46,370 --> 02:14:46,380
run-ins with Bob board uh uh and and he
 

7121
02:14:46,380 --> 02:14:48,589
run-ins with Bob board uh uh and and he
has a very different uh set of views on

7122
02:14:48,589 --> 02:14:48,599
has a very different uh set of views on
 

7123
02:14:48,599 --> 02:14:51,229
has a very different uh set of views on
on things uh but but I I just don't

7124
02:14:51,229 --> 02:14:51,239
on things uh but but I I just don't
 

7125
02:14:51,239 --> 02:14:52,729
on things uh but but I I just don't
think he's right in saying that I'm

7126
02:14:52,729 --> 02:14:52,739
think he's right in saying that I'm
 

7127
02:14:52,739 --> 02:14:55,189
think he's right in saying that I'm
cherry picking well yes and I mean he

7128
02:14:55,189 --> 02:14:55,199
cherry picking well yes and I mean he
 

7129
02:14:55,199 --> 02:14:57,050
cherry picking well yes and I mean he
also has similar criticism about the

7130
02:14:57,050 --> 02:14:57,060
also has similar criticism about the
 

7131
02:14:57,060 --> 02:14:59,390
also has similar criticism about the
estimate of the EU cost of climate

7132
02:14:59,390 --> 02:14:59,400
estimate of the EU cost of climate
 

7133
02:14:59,400 --> 02:15:04,129
estimate of the EU cost of climate
action uh based on the knob 2013 model

7134
02:15:04,129 --> 02:15:04,139
action uh based on the knob 2013 model
 

7135
02:15:04,139 --> 02:15:06,410
action uh based on the knob 2013 model
But ultimately these criticism have to

7136
02:15:06,410 --> 02:15:06,420
But ultimately these criticism have to
 

7137
02:15:06,420 --> 02:15:08,149
But ultimately these criticism have to
do is like what are the sources for the

7138
02:15:08,149 --> 02:15:08,159
do is like what are the sources for the
 

7139
02:15:08,159 --> 02:15:10,609
do is like what are the sources for the
different models and and just very

7140
02:15:10,609 --> 02:15:10,619
different models and and just very
 

7141
02:15:10,619 --> 02:15:12,290
different models and and just very
briefly I mean I'm I'm laying it out

7142
02:15:12,290 --> 02:15:12,300
briefly I mean I'm I'm laying it out
 

7143
02:15:12,300 --> 02:15:13,850
briefly I mean I'm I'm laying it out
very transparently where I get these

7144
02:15:13,850 --> 02:15:13,860
very transparently where I get these
 

7145
02:15:13,860 --> 02:15:15,530
very transparently where I get these
models of where I get these estimates

7146
02:15:15,530 --> 02:15:15,540
models of where I get these estimates
 

7147
02:15:15,540 --> 02:15:17,330
models of where I get these estimates
from in the book I've really tried to

7148
02:15:17,330 --> 02:15:17,340
from in the book I've really tried to
 

7149
02:15:17,340 --> 02:15:19,790
from in the book I've really tried to
document this and yes I mean look

7150
02:15:19,790 --> 02:15:19,800
document this and yes I mean look
 

7151
02:15:19,800 --> 02:15:22,490
document this and yes I mean look
there's nobody who sort of has all the

7152
02:15:22,490 --> 02:15:22,500
there's nobody who sort of has all the
 

7153
02:15:22,500 --> 02:15:24,410
there's nobody who sort of has all the
information and gets everything right in

7154
02:15:24,410 --> 02:15:24,420
information and gets everything right in
 

7155
02:15:24,420 --> 02:15:27,589
information and gets everything right in
all of these areas uh I I think most of

7156
02:15:27,589 --> 02:15:27,599
all of these areas uh I I think most of
 

7157
02:15:27,599 --> 02:15:31,129
all of these areas uh I I think most of
uh uh but Ward's uh argument is is not a

7158
02:15:31,129 --> 02:15:31,139
uh uh but Ward's uh argument is is not a
 

7159
02:15:31,139 --> 02:15:35,810
uh uh but Ward's uh argument is is not a
uh a good faith effort to uh to sort of

7160
02:15:35,810 --> 02:15:35,820
uh a good faith effort to uh to sort of
 

7161
02:15:35,820 --> 02:15:39,050
uh a good faith effort to uh to sort of
uh improve on on these estimates he's

7162
02:15:39,050 --> 02:15:39,060
uh improve on on these estimates he's
 

7163
02:15:39,060 --> 02:15:40,550
uh improve on on these estimates he's
he's right and saying some of these

7164
02:15:40,550 --> 02:15:40,560
he's right and saying some of these
 

7165
02:15:40,560 --> 02:15:42,530
he's right and saying some of these
estimates we only have a few estimates

7166
02:15:42,530 --> 02:15:42,540
estimates we only have a few estimates
 

7167
02:15:42,540 --> 02:15:44,930
estimates we only have a few estimates
and you know yeah I'd like to have more

7168
02:15:44,930 --> 02:15:44,940
and you know yeah I'd like to have more
 

7169
02:15:44,940 --> 02:15:47,450
and you know yeah I'd like to have more
of them I one thing I should mention is

7170
02:15:47,450 --> 02:15:47,460
of them I one thing I should mention is
 

7171
02:15:47,460 --> 02:15:49,910
of them I one thing I should mention is
that there is very little interest in

7172
02:15:49,910 --> 02:15:49,920
that there is very little interest in
 

7173
02:15:49,920 --> 02:15:51,410
that there is very little interest in
general and there's very little funding

7174
02:15:51,410 --> 02:15:51,420
general and there's very little funding
 

7175
02:15:51,420 --> 02:15:54,290
general and there's very little funding
in finding out how much do our climate

7176
02:15:54,290 --> 02:15:54,300
in finding out how much do our climate
 

7177
02:15:54,300 --> 02:15:56,330
in finding out how much do our climate
policies cost because that's you know

7178
02:15:56,330 --> 02:15:56,340
policies cost because that's you know
 

7179
02:15:56,340 --> 02:15:57,709
policies cost because that's you know
that's just inconvenient to everyone

7180
02:15:57,709 --> 02:15:57,719
that's just inconvenient to everyone
 

7181
02:15:57,719 --> 02:15:59,930
that's just inconvenient to everyone
yeah in in the whole game you know who

7182
02:15:59,930 --> 02:15:59,940
yeah in in the whole game you know who
 

7183
02:15:59,940 --> 02:16:02,149
yeah in in the whole game you know who
wants to know that that you know for

7184

on his own propaganda so you're even

7268
02:17:39,410 --> 02:17:39,420
on his own propaganda so you're even
 

7269
02:17:39,420 --> 02:17:40,910
on his own propaganda so you're even
your understanding and perception of the

7270
02:17:40,910 --> 02:17:40,920
your understanding and perception of the
 

7271
02:17:40,920 --> 02:17:42,709
your understanding and perception of the

world completely shifted so it's it's
 

7273
02:17:42,719 --> 02:17:45,230
world completely shifted so it's it's
very very very difficult to understand

7274
02:17:45,230 --> 02:17:45,240
very very very difficult to understand
 

7275
02:17:45,240 --> 02:17:47,389
very very very difficult to understand
who to trust

7276
02:17:47,389 --> 02:17:47,399
who to trust
 

7277
02:17:47,399 --> 02:17:48,469
who to trust
um

7278
02:17:48,469 --> 02:17:48,479
um
 

7279
02:17:48,479 --> 02:17:51,290
um
and uh just because it's consensus in a

7280
02:17:51,290 --> 02:17:51,300
and uh just because it's consensus in a
 

7281
02:17:51,300 --> 02:17:53,690
and uh just because it's consensus in a
particular Community doesn't necessarily

7282
02:17:53,690 --> 02:17:53,700
particular Community doesn't necessarily
 

7283
02:17:53,700 --> 02:17:56,450
particular Community doesn't necessarily
mean it's a source of trust so it's a I

7284
02:17:56,450 --> 02:17:56,460
mean it's a source of trust so it's a I
 

7285
02:17:56,460 --> 02:17:58,910
mean it's a source of trust so it's a I
mean basically

7286
02:17:58,910 --> 02:17:58,920
mean basically
 

7287
02:17:58,920 --> 02:18:00,530
mean basically
I don't know how to operate in this

7288
02:18:00,530 --> 02:18:00,540
I don't know how to operate in this
 

7289
02:18:00,540 --> 02:18:02,870
I don't know how to operate in this
world except to have a humility and

7290
02:18:02,870 --> 02:18:02,880
world except to have a humility and
 

7291
02:18:02,880 --> 02:18:05,150
world except to have a humility and
constantly question your assumptions and

7292
02:18:05,150 --> 02:18:05,160
constantly question your assumptions and
 

7293
02:18:05,160 --> 02:18:07,849
constantly question your assumptions and
but not so much that you're completely

7294
02:18:07,849 --> 02:18:07,859
but not so much that you're completely
 

7295
02:18:07,859 --> 02:18:10,310
but not so much that you're completely
out in the ocean not knowing what is

7296
02:18:10,310 --> 02:18:10,320
out in the ocean not knowing what is
 

7297
02:18:10,320 --> 02:18:12,650
out in the ocean not knowing what is
true or not so it's this weird weird

7298
02:18:12,650 --> 02:18:12,660
true or not so it's this weird weird
 

7299
02:18:12,660 --> 02:18:15,770
true or not so it's this weird weird
world because I I ultimately bigger than

7300
02:18:15,770 --> 02:18:15,780
world because I I ultimately bigger than
 

7301
02:18:15,780 --> 02:18:17,270

climate

7302
02:18:17,270 --> 02:18:17,280
climate
 

7303
02:18:17,280 --> 02:18:21,110
climate
my hope is to have institutions that can

7304
02:18:21,110 --> 02:18:21,120
my hope is to have institutions that can
 

7305
02:18:21,120 --> 02:18:22,310
my hope is to have institutions that can
be trusted

7306
02:18:22,310 --> 02:18:22,320
be trusted
 

7307
02:18:22,320 --> 02:18:26,209
be trusted
and that's been very much under attack

7308
02:18:26,209 --> 02:18:26,219
and that's been very much under attack
 

7309
02:18:26,219 --> 02:18:28,370
and that's been very much under attack
um in as as part of the climate debate

7310
02:18:28,370 --> 02:18:28,380
um in as as part of the climate debate
 

7311
02:18:28,380 --> 02:18:31,790
um in as as part of the climate debate
as part of the covid debate as part of

02:18:31,790 --> 02:18:31,800
as part of the covid debate as part of
 

7313
02:18:31,800 --> 02:18:35,270
as part of the covid debate as part of
all these discussions and science to me

7314
02:18:35,270 --> 02:18:35,280
all these discussions and science to me
 

7315
02:18:35,280 --> 02:18:37,009
all these discussions and science to me
is one of the sources

7316
02:18:37,009 --> 02:18:37,019
is one of the sources
 

7317
02:18:37,019 --> 02:18:38,810
is one of the sources
of truth and the fact that that's under

7318
02:18:38,810 --> 02:18:38,820
of truth and the fact that that's under
 

7319
02:18:38,820 --> 02:18:41,270
of truth and the fact that that's under
question now is uh something that hurts

7320
02:18:41,270 --> 02:18:41,280
question now is uh something that hurts
 

7321
02:18:41,280 --> 02:18:44,629
question now is uh something that hurts
me on many levels uh deeply you said

7322

me on many levels uh deeply you said
something earlier as I took a note on

something earlier as I took a note on
down here and I can't find it about

down here and I can't find it about
 

7327
02:18:47,880 --> 02:18:49,610
down here and I can't find it about
cooperation it was like collaborative

uh Catherine hayho you can always right
 

7501
02:22:07,680 --> 02:22:10,429
uh Catherine hayho you can always right
now find your you're you're

7502
02:22:10,429 --> 02:22:10,439
now find your you're you're
 

7503
02:22:10,439 --> 02:22:12,950
now find your you're you're
your character to follow but I think

7504
02:22:12,950 --> 02:22:12,960
your character to follow but I think
 

7505
02:22:12,960 --> 02:22:14,330
your character to follow but I think
what would be better is if you actually

7506
02:22:14,330 --> 02:22:14,340
what would be better is if you actually
 

7507
02:22:14,340 --> 02:22:16,490
what would be better is if you actually
develop some skills to just have a basic

7508
02:22:16,490 --> 02:22:16,500
develop some skills to just have a basic
 

7509
02:22:16,500 --> 02:22:17,929
develop some skills to just have a basic
ability

7510
02:22:17,929 --> 02:22:17,939
ability
 

7511
02:22:17,939 --> 02:22:19,969
ability
to know how to cut to the chase

7512
02:22:19,969 --> 02:22:19,979
to know how to cut to the chase
 

7513
02:22:19,979 --> 02:22:21,710
to know how to cut to the chase
can I can I just follow up on that

7514
02:22:21,710 --> 02:22:21,720
can I can I just follow up on that
 

7515
02:22:21,720 --> 02:22:23,570
can I can I just follow up on that
because one of the things that I try to

7516
02:22:23,570 --> 02:22:23,580
because one of the things that I try to
 

7517
02:22:23,580 --> 02:22:25,309
because one of the things that I try to
do and and so my day job is actually

7518
02:22:25,309 --> 02:22:25,319
do and and so my day job is actually
 

7519
02:22:25,319 --> 02:22:27,469
do and and so my day job is actually
something else I work with I think thing

7520
02:22:27,469 --> 02:22:27,479
something else I work with I think thing
 

7521
02:22:27,479 --> 02:22:29,929
something else I work with I think thing
called The Copenhagen consensus uh where

7522
02:22:29,929 --> 02:22:29,939
called The Copenhagen consensus uh where
 

7523
02:22:29,939 --> 02:22:31,670
called The Copenhagen consensus uh where
we work with uh more than 300 of the

7524
02:22:31,670 --> 02:22:31,680
we work with uh more than 300 of the
 

7525
02:22:31,680 --> 02:22:33,349
we work with uh more than 300 of the
world's top economists and we work with

7526
02:22:33,349 --> 02:22:33,359
world's top economists and we work with
 

7527
02:22:33,359 --> 02:22:35,750
world's top economists and we work with
seven noble alerts in economics and and

7528
02:22:35,750 --> 02:22:35,760
seven noble alerts in economics and and
 

7529
02:22:35,760 --> 02:22:37,849
seven noble alerts in economics and and
the point there is really to talk about

7530
02:22:37,849 --> 02:22:37,859
the point there is really to talk about
 

7531
02:22:37,859 --> 02:22:39,950
the point there is really to talk about
where can you spend a dollar

7532
02:22:39,950 --> 02:22:39,960
where can you spend a dollar
 

7533
02:22:39,960 --> 02:22:42,349
where can you spend a dollar
and do the most good for the world

7534
02:22:42,349 --> 02:22:42,359
and do the most good for the world
 

7535
02:22:42,359 --> 02:22:45,230
and do the most good for the world
that's that's basically the the thing

7536
02:22:45,230 --> 02:22:45,240
that's that's basically the the thing
 

7537
02:22:45,240 --> 02:22:47,750
that's that's basically the the thing
that we try to do and and as as you

7538
02:22:47,750 --> 02:22:47,760
that we try to do and and as as you
 

7539
02:22:47,760 --> 02:22:49,730
that we try to do and and as as you
rightly point out look there are lots of

7540
02:22:49,730 --> 02:22:49,740
rightly point out look there are lots of
 

7541
02:22:49,740 --> 02:22:51,349
rightly point out look there are lots of
different estimates of what can you do

7542
02:22:51,349 --> 02:22:51,359
different estimates of what can you do
 

7543
02:22:51,359 --> 02:22:53,210
different estimates of what can you do
for instance on climate what can you do

7544
02:22:53,210 --> 02:22:53,220
for instance on climate what can you do
 

7545
02:22:53,220 --> 02:22:56,150
for instance on climate what can you do
on tuberculosis what can you do for uh

7546
02:22:56,150 --> 02:22:56,160
on tuberculosis what can you do for uh
 

7547
02:22:56,160 --> 02:22:57,830
on tuberculosis what can you do for uh
vulnerability in all kinds of different

7548
02:22:57,830 --> 02:22:57,840
vulnerability in all kinds of different
 

7549
02:22:57,840 --> 02:23:00,650
vulnerability in all kinds of different
different ways and and if these were all

7550
02:23:00,650 --> 02:23:00,660
different ways and and if these were all
 

7551
02:23:00,660 --> 02:23:02,690
different ways and and if these were all
sort of well you can spend a dollar here

7552
02:23:02,690 --> 02:23:02,700
sort of well you can spend a dollar here
 

7553
02:23:02,700 --> 02:23:05,809
sort of well you can spend a dollar here
and do 2.36 but you can spend it all

7554
02:23:05,809 --> 02:23:05,819
and do 2.36 but you can spend it all
 

7555
02:23:05,819 --> 02:23:09,050
and do 2.36 but you can spend it all
here and do 2.34 over here that I would

7556
02:23:09,050 --> 02:23:09,060
here and do 2.34 over here that I would
 

7557
02:23:09,060 --> 02:23:10,730
here and do 2.34 over here that I would
worry a lot but that's not how the world

7558
02:23:10,730 --> 02:23:10,740
worry a lot but that's not how the world
 

7559
02:23:10,740 --> 02:23:13,490
worry a lot but that's not how the world
works because we're terribly inefficient

7560
02:23:13,490 --> 02:23:13,500
works because we're terribly inefficient
 

7561
02:23:13,500 --> 02:23:16,849
works because we're terribly inefficient
so they're literally lots and lots of

7562
02:23:16,849 --> 02:23:16,859
so they're literally lots and lots of
 

7563
02:23:16,859 --> 02:23:18,650
so they're literally lots and lots of
amazing things you can do out there

7564
02:23:18,650 --> 02:23:18,660
amazing things you can do out there
 

7565
02:23:18,660 --> 02:23:20,030
amazing things you can do out there
there's a lot of little hanging fruit

7566
02:23:20,030 --> 02:23:20,040
there's a lot of little hanging fruit
 

7567
02:23:20,040 --> 02:23:22,370
there's a lot of little hanging fruit
and there's a lot of not terribly great

7568
02:23:22,370 --> 02:23:22,380
and there's a lot of not terribly great
 

7569
02:23:22,380 --> 02:23:24,889
and there's a lot of not terribly great
things that you can do and unfortunately

7570
02:23:24,889 --> 02:23:24,899
things that you can do and unfortunately
 

7571
02:23:24,899 --> 02:23:26,750
things that you can do and unfortunately
one of the things that I try to sort of

7572
02:23:26,750 --> 02:23:26,760
one of the things that I try to sort of
 

7573
02:23:26,760 --> 02:23:29,210
one of the things that I try to sort of
battle is that you know we get a lot of

7574
02:23:29,210 --> 02:23:29,220
battle is that you know we get a lot of
 

7575
02:23:29,220 --> 02:23:30,469
battle is that you know we get a lot of
things right that's why you know the

7576
02:23:30,469 --> 02:23:30,479
things right that's why you know the
 

7577
02:23:30,479 --> 02:23:31,849
things right that's why you know the
world is a lot better than what it used

7578
02:23:31,849 --> 02:23:31,859
world is a lot better than what it used
 

7579
02:23:31,859 --> 02:23:34,130
world is a lot better than what it used
to be uh but the things that are sort of

7580
02:23:34,130 --> 02:23:34,140
to be uh but the things that are sort of
 

7581
02:23:34,140 --> 02:23:36,889
to be uh but the things that are sort of
left left over are often you know the

7582
02:23:36,889 --> 02:23:36,899
left left over are often you know the
 

7583
02:23:36,899 --> 02:23:38,570
left left over are often you know the
boring things that happen to be

7584
02:23:38,570 --> 02:23:38,580
boring things that happen to be
 

7585
02:23:38,580 --> 02:23:40,610
boring things that happen to be
incredibly effective and the exciting

7586
02:23:40,610 --> 02:23:40,620
incredibly effective and the exciting
 

7587
02:23:40,620 --> 02:23:42,349
incredibly effective and the exciting
things that are often not that terribly

7588
02:23:42,349 --> 02:23:42,359
things that are often not that terribly
 

7589
02:23:42,359 --> 02:23:46,130
things that are often not that terribly
effective and and so I think one way to

7590
02:23:46,130 --> 02:23:46,140
effective and and so I think one way to
 

7591
02:23:46,140 --> 02:23:47,990
effective and and so I think one way to
look at this is basically to have people

7592
02:23:47,990 --> 02:23:48,000
look at this is basically to have people
 

7593
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,330
look at this is basically to have people
do cost benefit across a wide range of

7594
02:23:50,330 --> 02:23:50,340
do cost benefit across a wide range of
 

7595
02:23:50,340 --> 02:23:51,889
do cost benefit across a wide range of
areas and we try to get a lot of

7596
02:23:51,889 --> 02:23:51,899
areas and we try to get a lot of
 

7597
02:23:51,899 --> 02:23:53,630
areas and we try to get a lot of
different economists to do this and they

7598
02:23:53,630 --> 02:23:53,640
different economists to do this and they
 

7599
02:23:53,640 --> 02:23:54,889
different economists to do this and they
come up with different numbers and

7600
02:23:54,889 --> 02:23:54,899
come up with different numbers and
 

7601
02:23:54,899 --> 02:23:56,270
come up with different numbers and
different models and different results

7602
02:23:56,270 --> 02:23:56,280
different models and different results
 

7603
02:23:56,280 --> 02:23:58,790
different models and different results
but if you sort of consistently get that

7604
02:23:58,790 --> 02:23:58,800
but if you sort of consistently get that
 

7605
02:23:58,800 --> 02:24:01,429
but if you sort of consistently get that
some things give you you know in tens or

7606
02:24:01,429 --> 02:24:01,439
some things give you you know in tens or
 

7607
02:24:01,439 --> 02:24:03,469
some things give you you know in tens or
maybe even hundreds of dollars back per

7608
02:24:03,469 --> 02:24:03,479
maybe even hundreds of dollars back per
 

7609
02:24:03,479 --> 02:24:05,510
maybe even hundreds of dollars back per
dollar remember this is not actually you

7610
02:24:05,510 --> 02:24:05,520
dollar remember this is not actually you
 

7611
02:24:05,520 --> 02:24:07,130
dollar remember this is not actually you
getting rich it's the world getting rich

7612
02:24:07,130 --> 02:24:07,140
getting rich it's the world getting rich
 

7613
02:24:07,140 --> 02:24:10,010
getting rich it's the world getting rich
it's the the world gets better worth a

7614
02:24:10,010 --> 02:24:10,020
it's the the world gets better worth a
 

7615
02:24:10,020 --> 02:24:12,290
it's the the world gets better worth a
hundred dollars for for every dollar you

7616
02:24:12,290 --> 02:24:12,300
hundred dollars for for every dollar you
 

7617
02:24:12,300 --> 02:24:13,969
hundred dollars for for every dollar you
spend and over here you can spend a

7618
02:24:13,969 --> 02:24:13,979
spend and over here you can spend a
 

7619
02:24:13,979 --> 02:24:15,950
spend and over here you can spend a
dollar and do somewhere between 30 cents

7620
02:24:15,950 --> 02:24:15,960
dollar and do somewhere between 30 cents
 

7621
02:24:15,960 --> 02:24:18,290
dollar and do somewhere between 30 cents
and maybe a couple dollars you should

7622
02:24:18,290 --> 02:24:18,300
and maybe a couple dollars you should
 

7623
02:24:18,300 --> 02:24:19,730
and maybe a couple dollars you should
probably be focused on the other

7624
02:24:19,730 --> 02:24:19,740
probably be focused on the other
 

7625
02:24:19,740 --> 02:24:21,710
probably be focused on the other
opportunity first and that's really the

7626
02:24:21,710 --> 02:24:21,720
opportunity first and that's really the
 

7627
02:24:21,720 --> 02:24:23,330
opportunity first and that's really the
point that I try to make with climate

7628
02:24:23,330 --> 02:24:23,340
point that I try to make with climate
 

7629
02:24:23,340 --> 02:24:25,010
point that I try to make with climate
there are some smart things we can do

7630
02:24:25,010 --> 02:24:25,020
there are some smart things we can do
 

7631
02:24:25,020 --> 02:24:27,469
there are some smart things we can do
and I hope we get to talk about them uh

7632
02:24:27,469 --> 02:24:27,479
and I hope we get to talk about them uh
 

7633
02:24:27,479 --> 02:24:29,690
and I hope we get to talk about them uh
in in climate but there's also a lot of

7634
02:24:29,690 --> 02:24:29,700
in in climate but there's also a lot of
 

7635
02:24:29,700 --> 02:24:31,550
in in climate but there's also a lot of
sort of the standard approaches to

7636
02:24:31,550 --> 02:24:31,560
sort of the standard approaches to
 

7637
02:24:31,560 --> 02:24:34,849
sort of the standard approaches to
fixing climate turns out to be very

7638
02:24:34,849 --> 02:24:34,859
fixing climate turns out to be very
 

7639
02:24:34,859 --> 02:24:36,950
fixing climate turns out to be very
likely below one dollars back in dollar

7640
02:24:36,950 --> 02:24:36,960
likely below one dollars back in dollar
 

7641
02:24:36,960 --> 02:24:38,929
likely below one dollars back in dollar
and certainly not terribly High you know

7642
02:24:38,929 --> 02:24:38,939
and certainly not terribly High you know
 

7643
02:24:38,939 --> 02:24:40,610
and certainly not terribly High you know
even if you're very optimistic it'll be

7644
02:24:40,610 --> 02:24:40,620
even if you're very optimistic it'll be
 

7645
02:24:40,620 --> 02:24:43,250
even if you're very optimistic it'll be
like two or three whereas many other

7646
02:24:43,250 --> 02:24:43,260
like two or three whereas many other
 

7647
02:24:43,260 --> 02:24:45,770
like two or three whereas many other
things are just fantastically better

7648
02:24:45,770 --> 02:24:45,780
things are just fantastically better
 

7649
02:24:45,780 --> 02:24:47,330
things are just fantastically better
Investments like the thing I've been

7650
02:24:47,330 --> 02:24:47,340
Investments like the thing I've been
 

7651
02:24:47,340 --> 02:24:50,929
Investments like the thing I've been
advocating uh a modest proposal to eat

7652
02:24:50,929 --> 02:24:50,939
advocating uh a modest proposal to eat
 

7653

Proposal from a few centuries ago
 

7659
02:24:59,939 --> 02:25:02,870
Proposal from a few centuries ago
um so it's not just cause benefit it's

7660
02:25:02,870 --> 02:25:02,880
um so it's not just cause benefit it's
 

7661
02:25:02,880 --> 02:25:05,690
um so it's not just cause benefit it's
also in the context of what is moral and

7662
02:25:05,690 --> 02:25:05,700
also in the context of what is moral and
 

7663
02:25:05,700 --> 02:25:07,429
also in the context of what is moral and
not and all that the full the full

7664
02:25:07,429 --> 02:25:07,439
not and all that the full the full
 

7665
02:25:07,439 --> 02:25:09,050
not and all that the full the full
complexity of it but that you just hit

7666
02:25:09,050 --> 02:25:09,060
complexity of it but that you just hit
 

7667
02:25:09,060 --> 02:25:10,190
complexity of it but that you just hit
on something really important you know

7668
02:25:10,190 --> 02:25:10,200
on something really important you know
 

7669
02:25:10,200 --> 02:25:11,690
on something really important you know
having been on this beat for so long and

7670
02:25:11,690 --> 02:25:11,700
having been on this beat for so long and
 

7671
02:25:11,700 --> 02:25:13,429
having been on this beat for so long and
again on the disaster beat as well

7672
02:25:13,429 --> 02:25:13,439
again on the disaster beat as well
 

7673
02:25:13,439 --> 02:25:15,170
again on the disaster beat as well
earthquakes

7674
02:25:15,170 --> 02:25:15,180
earthquakes
 

7675
02:25:15,180 --> 02:25:16,670
earthquakes
I can't tell you how many disaster

7676
02:25:16,670 --> 02:25:16,680
I can't tell you how many disaster
 

7677
02:25:16,680 --> 02:25:19,610
I can't tell you how many disaster
science experts keep telling me like

7678
02:25:19,610 --> 02:25:19,620
science experts keep telling me like
 

7679
02:25:19,620 --> 02:25:21,650
science experts keep telling me like
everyone says preparedness invest for

7680
02:25:21,650 --> 02:25:21,660
everyone says preparedness invest for
 

7681
02:25:21,660 --> 02:25:23,870
everyone says preparedness invest for
preparedness a strict cost-benefit

7682
02:25:23,870 --> 02:25:23,880
preparedness a strict cost-benefit
 

7683
02:25:23,880 --> 02:25:25,330
preparedness a strict cost-benefit
analysis will always tell you a dollar

7684
02:25:25,330 --> 02:25:25,340
analysis will always tell you a dollar
 

7685
02:25:25,340 --> 02:25:28,550
analysis will always tell you a dollar
invested in resilience before a

7686
02:25:28,550 --> 02:25:28,560
invested in resilience before a
 

7687
02:25:28,560 --> 02:25:30,410
invested in resilience before a
community gets hit by whatever

7688
02:25:30,410 --> 02:25:30,420
community gets hit by whatever
 

7689
02:25:30,420 --> 02:25:32,870
community gets hit by whatever
is worth 10 you'll always have to spend

7690
02:25:32,870 --> 02:25:32,880
is worth 10 you'll always have to spend
 

7691
02:25:32,880 --> 02:25:35,389
is worth 10 you'll always have to spend
10 after and so it's fine to do the cost

7692
02:25:35,389 --> 02:25:35,399
10 after and so it's fine to do the cost
 

7693
02:25:35,399 --> 02:25:37,570
10 after and so it's fine to do the cost
benefit stuff but it's just the Baseline

7694
02:25:37,570 --> 02:25:37,580
benefit stuff but it's just the Baseline
 

7695
02:25:37,580 --> 02:25:39,710
benefit stuff but it's just the Baseline
then you have to look at the social

7696
02:25:39,710 --> 02:25:39,720
then you have to look at the social
 

7697
02:25:39,720 --> 02:25:42,290
then you have to look at the social
science which shows or history which

7698
02:25:42,290 --> 02:25:42,300
science which shows or history which
 

7699
02:25:42,300 --> 02:25:45,050
science which shows or history which
shows you how few times we do it it's

7700
02:25:45,050 --> 02:25:45,060
shows you how few times we do it it's
 

7701
02:25:45,060 --> 02:25:47,630
shows you how few times we do it it's
like we just don't do it therefore you

7702
02:25:47,630 --> 02:25:47,640
like we just don't do it therefore you
 

7703
02:25:47,640 --> 02:25:50,270
like we just don't do it therefore you
can bang that drum your work is valuable

7704
02:25:50,270 --> 02:25:50,280
can bang that drum your work is valuable
 

7705
02:25:50,280 --> 02:25:53,270
can bang that drum your work is valuable
but it's really constrained because show

7706
02:25:53,270 --> 02:25:53,280
but it's really constrained because show
 

7707
02:25:53,280 --> 02:25:55,010
but it's really constrained because show
me in the world

7708
02:25:55,010 --> 02:25:55,020
me in the world
 

7709
02:25:55,020 --> 02:25:58,370
me in the world
where that does happen and then how you

7710
02:25:58,370 --> 02:25:58,380
where that does happen and then how you
 

7711
02:25:58,380 --> 02:26:00,230
where that does happen and then how you
turn that success which is basically

7712
02:26:00,230 --> 02:26:00,240
turn that success which is basically
 

7713
02:26:00,240 --> 02:26:02,929
turn that success which is basically
something not happening into the story

7714
02:26:02,929 --> 02:26:02,939
something not happening into the story
 

7715
02:26:02,939 --> 02:26:05,990
something not happening into the story
just very briefly you know we we try to

7716
02:26:05,990 --> 02:26:06,000
just very briefly you know we we try to
 

7717
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:07,790
just very briefly you know we we try to
so we we do this for a lot of countries

7718
02:26:07,790 --> 02:26:07,800
so we we do this for a lot of countries
 

7719
02:26:07,800 --> 02:26:10,150
so we we do this for a lot of countries
so we did it for uh Haiti for instance

7720
02:26:10,150 --> 02:26:10,160
so we did it for uh Haiti for instance
 

7721
02:26:10,160 --> 02:26:12,950
so we did it for uh Haiti for instance
uh uh funded by the Canadian development

7722
02:26:12,950 --> 02:26:12,960
uh uh funded by the Canadian development
 

7723
02:26:12,960 --> 02:26:14,870
uh uh funded by the Canadian development
uh Ministry because they're basically

7724
02:26:14,870 --> 02:26:14,880
uh Ministry because they're basically
 

7725
02:26:14,880 --> 02:26:16,790
uh Ministry because they're basically
saying we spent a billion dollars in

7726
02:26:16,790 --> 02:26:16,800
saying we spent a billion dollars in
 

7727
02:26:16,800 --> 02:26:18,590
saying we spent a billion dollars in
Haiti since the earthquake and we really

7728
02:26:18,590 --> 02:26:18,600
Haiti since the earthquake and we really
 

7729
02:26:18,600 --> 02:26:20,450
Haiti since the earthquake and we really
can't tell the difference so they want

7730
02:26:20,450 --> 02:26:20,460
can't tell the difference so they want
 

7731
02:26:20,460 --> 02:26:22,010
can't tell the difference so they want
it to fight they I mean they actually

7732
02:26:22,010 --> 02:26:22,020
it to fight they I mean they actually
 

7733
02:26:22,020 --> 02:26:24,170
it to fight they I mean they actually
say that right and so they said we want

7734
02:26:24,170 --> 02:26:24,180
say that right and so they said we want
 

7735
02:26:24,180 --> 02:26:25,849
say that right and so they said we want
to find out what are the really smart

7736
02:26:25,849 --> 02:26:25,859
to find out what are the really smart
 

7737
02:26:25,859 --> 02:26:28,550
to find out what are the really smart
things you can do in Haiti and so we we

7738
02:26:28,550 --> 02:26:28,560
things you can do in Haiti and so we we
 

7739
02:26:28,560 --> 02:26:30,530
things you can do in Haiti and so we we
uh together with lots of you know uh

7740
02:26:30,530 --> 02:26:30,540
uh together with lots of you know uh
 

7741
02:26:30,540 --> 02:26:32,750
uh together with lots of you know uh
people in Haiti and all the you know the

7742
02:26:32,750 --> 02:26:32,760
people in Haiti and all the you know the
 

7743
02:26:32,760 --> 02:26:34,010
people in Haiti and all the you know the
business community and the political

and labor community and everybody else
 

7749
02:26:37,620 --> 02:26:39,889
and labor community and everybody else
what are the smart things to do and then

7750
02:26:39,889 --> 02:26:39,899
what are the smart things to do and then
 

7751
02:26:39,899 --> 02:26:42,050
what are the smart things to do and then
we had economists evaluate it and there

7752
02:26:42,050 --> 02:26:42,060
we had economists evaluate it and there
 

7753
02:26:42,060 --> 02:26:43,309
we had economists evaluate it and there
are a lot of these things that everybody

7754
02:26:43,309 --> 02:26:43,319
are a lot of these things that everybody
 

7755
02:26:43,319 --> 02:26:44,929
are a lot of these things that everybody
wanted that we're not all that smart

7756
02:26:44,929 --> 02:26:44,939
wanted that we're not all that smart
 

7757
02:26:44,939 --> 02:26:47,210
wanted that we're not all that smart
there's actually a lot of smart things

7758
02:26:47,210 --> 02:26:47,220
there's actually a lot of smart things
 

7759
02:26:47,220 --> 02:26:49,790
there's actually a lot of smart things
and yes the politicians didn't pick most

7760
02:26:49,790 --> 02:26:49,800
and yes the politicians didn't pick most
 

7761
02:26:49,800 --> 02:26:52,790
and yes the politicians didn't pick most
of them so our our senses we try to give

7762
02:26:52,790 --> 02:26:52,800
of them so our our senses we try to give
 

7763
02:26:52,800 --> 02:26:54,469
of them so our our senses we try to give
people uh you know you're thinking about

7764
02:26:54,469 --> 02:26:54,479
people uh you know you're thinking about
 

7765
02:26:54,479 --> 02:26:56,030
people uh you know you're thinking about
these 70 things

7766
02:26:56,030 --> 02:26:56,040
these 70 things
 

7767
02:26:56,040 --> 02:26:57,710
these 70 things
you should actually just think about

7768
02:26:57,710 --> 02:26:57,720
you should actually just think about
 

7769
02:26:57,720 --> 02:26:59,750
you should actually just think about
these 20 things right and then we

7770
02:26:59,750 --> 02:26:59,760
these 20 things right and then we
 

7771
02:26:59,760 --> 02:27:01,849
these 20 things right and then we
consider ourselves incredibly lucky if

7772
02:27:01,849 --> 02:27:01,859
consider ourselves incredibly lucky if
 

7773
02:27:01,859 --> 02:27:03,770
consider ourselves incredibly lucky if
they actually do one of them so you

7774
02:27:03,770 --> 02:27:03,780
they actually do one of them so you
 

7775
02:27:03,780 --> 02:27:05,929
they actually do one of them so you
wrote the book how to spend 75 billion

7776
02:27:05,929 --> 02:27:05,939
wrote the book how to spend 75 billion
 

7777
02:27:05,939 --> 02:27:07,690
wrote the book how to spend 75 billion
dollars to make the world a better place

7778
02:27:07,690 --> 02:27:07,700
dollars to make the world a better place
 

7779
02:27:07,700 --> 02:27:10,550
dollars to make the world a better place
so on can we just list some of the

7780
02:27:10,550 --> 02:27:10,560
so on can we just list some of the
 

7781
02:27:10,560 --> 02:27:13,969
so on can we just list some of the
things if I if if you got 75 billion

7782
02:27:13,969 --> 02:27:13,979
things if I if if you got 75 billion
 

7783
02:27:13,979 --> 02:27:16,429
things if I if if you got 75 billion
dollars what how do you spend them all

7784
02:27:16,429 --> 02:27:16,439
dollars what how do you spend them all
 

7785
02:27:16,439 --> 02:27:18,650
dollars what how do you spend them all
right so there's some incredibly good

7786
02:27:18,650 --> 02:27:18,660
right so there's some incredibly good
 

7787
02:27:18,660 --> 02:27:20,510
right so there's some incredibly good
and very very well documented things

7788
02:27:20,510 --> 02:27:20,520
and very very well documented things
 

7789
02:27:20,520 --> 02:27:22,730
and very very well documented things
that you could spend money on so we have

7790
02:27:22,730 --> 02:27:22,740
that you could spend money on so we have
 

7791
02:27:22,740 --> 02:27:25,429
that you could spend money on so we have
two big infectious diseases that almost

7792
02:27:25,429 --> 02:27:25,439
two big infectious diseases that almost
 

7793
02:27:25,439 --> 02:27:28,010
two big infectious diseases that almost
nobody think about uh because we only

7794
02:27:28,010 --> 02:27:28,020
nobody think about uh because we only
 

7795
02:27:28,020 --> 02:27:30,410
nobody think about uh because we only
think about you know covet but

7796
02:27:30,410 --> 02:27:30,420
think about you know covet but
 

7797
02:27:30,420 --> 02:27:32,690
think about you know covet but
tuberculosis used to be the world's

7798
02:27:32,690 --> 02:27:32,700
tuberculosis used to be the world's
 

7799
02:27:32,700 --> 02:27:35,210
tuberculosis used to be the world's
biggest infectious disease killer uh it

7800
02:27:35,210 --> 02:27:35,220
biggest infectious disease killer uh it
 

7801
02:27:35,220 --> 02:27:37,010
biggest infectious disease killer uh it
still kills about one and a half million

7802
02:27:37,010 --> 02:27:37,020
still kills about one and a half million
 

7803
02:27:37,020 --> 02:27:39,950
still kills about one and a half million
uh people every year the reason why we

7804
02:27:39,950 --> 02:27:39,960
uh people every year the reason why we
 

7805
02:27:39,960 --> 02:27:41,809
uh people every year the reason why we
don't you know really worry about it is

7806
02:27:41,809 --> 02:27:41,819
don't you know really worry about it is
 

7807
02:27:41,819 --> 02:27:44,389
don't you know really worry about it is
because we fixed it a hundred years ago

7808
02:27:44,389 --> 02:27:44,399
because we fixed it a hundred years ago
 

7809
02:27:44,399 --> 02:27:47,090
because we fixed it a hundred years ago
we know how to fix it it's just you know

7810
02:27:47,090 --> 02:27:47,100
we know how to fix it it's just you know
 

7811
02:27:47,100 --> 02:27:48,889
we know how to fix it it's just you know
it's just basically getting medication

7812
02:27:48,889 --> 02:27:48,899
it's just basically getting medication
 

7813
02:27:48,899 --> 02:27:50,450
it's just basically getting medication
to people it's also about getting them

7814
02:27:50,450 --> 02:27:50,460
to people it's also about getting them
 

7815
02:27:50,460 --> 02:27:52,670
to people it's also about getting them
to take it while when they're sort of

7816
02:27:52,670 --> 02:27:52,680
to take it while when they're sort of
 

7817
02:27:52,680 --> 02:27:54,170
to take it while when they're sort of
been cured because you need to take it

7818
02:27:54,170 --> 02:27:54,180
been cured because you need to take it
 

7819
02:27:54,180 --> 02:27:55,730
been cured because you need to take it
for four to six months and that's

7820
02:27:55,730 --> 02:27:55,740
for four to six months and that's
 

7821
02:27:55,740 --> 02:27:57,710
for four to six months and that's
actually hard to do so you also need to

7822
02:27:57,710 --> 02:27:57,720
actually hard to do so you also need to
 

7823
02:27:57,720 --> 02:27:59,929
actually hard to do so you also need to
incentivize that in some kind of way it

7824
02:27:59,929 --> 02:27:59,939
incentivize that in some kind of way it
 

7825
02:27:59,939 --> 02:28:02,270
incentivize that in some kind of way it
turns out it's incredibly cheap to

7826
02:28:02,270 --> 02:28:02,280
turns out it's incredibly cheap to
 

7827
02:28:02,280 --> 02:28:04,309
turns out it's incredibly cheap to
basically save almost all of the 1.5

7828
02:28:04,309 --> 02:28:04,319
basically save almost all of the 1.5
 

7829
02:28:04,319 --> 02:28:06,950
basically save almost all of the 1.5
million people these are people that die

7830
02:28:06,950 --> 02:28:06,960
million people these are people that die
 

7831
02:28:06,960 --> 02:28:08,929
million people these are people that die
in the prime of their lives they're

7832
02:28:08,929 --> 02:28:08,939
in the prime of their lives they're
 

7833
02:28:08,939 --> 02:28:10,730
in the prime of their lives they're
typically parents so you would also have

7834
02:28:10,730 --> 02:28:10,740
typically parents so you would also have
 

7835
02:28:10,740 --> 02:28:12,770
typically parents so you would also have
a lot of knock-on effects and basically

7836
02:28:12,770 --> 02:28:12,780
a lot of knock-on effects and basically
 

7837
02:28:12,780 --> 02:28:15,230
a lot of knock-on effects and basically
we find for a couple billion dollars you

7838
02:28:15,230 --> 02:28:15,240
we find for a couple billion dollars you
 

7839
02:28:15,240 --> 02:28:17,210
we find for a couple billion dollars you
could save the value number of these not

7840
02:28:17,210 --> 02:28:17,220
could save the value number of these not
 

7841
02:28:17,220 --> 02:28:18,710
could save the value number of these not
all of them but you could save the vast

7842
02:28:18,710 --> 02:28:18,720
all of them but you could save the vast
 

7843
02:28:18,720 --> 02:28:20,630
all of them but you could save the vast
number of them it will also improve you

7844
02:28:20,630 --> 02:28:20,640
number of them it will also improve you
 

7845
02:28:20,640 --> 02:28:21,830
number of them it will also improve you
know outcomes and all kinds of other

7846
02:28:21,830 --> 02:28:21,840
know outcomes and all kinds of other
 

7847
02:28:21,840 --> 02:28:24,950
know outcomes and all kinds of other
ways likewise with malaria another it

7848
02:28:24,950 --> 02:28:24,960
ways likewise with malaria another it
 

7849
02:28:24,960 --> 02:28:27,830
ways likewise with malaria another it
has some somewhat better uh PR it's

7850
02:28:27,830 --> 02:28:27,840
has some somewhat better uh PR it's
 

7851
02:28:27,840 --> 02:28:30,530
has some somewhat better uh PR it's
funny to think of malaria as PR and

7852
02:28:30,530 --> 02:28:30,540
funny to think of malaria as PR and
 

7853
02:28:30,540 --> 02:28:32,270
funny to think of malaria as PR and
tuberculosis 9 they need to improve

7854
02:28:32,270 --> 02:28:32,280
tuberculosis 9 they need to improve
 

7855
02:28:32,280 --> 02:28:33,730
tuberculosis 9 they need to improve
their PR department

7856
02:28:33,730 --> 02:28:33,740
their PR department
 

7857
02:28:33,740 --> 02:28:37,190
their PR department
those mosquitoes are the good PR but by

7858
02:28:37,190 --> 02:28:37,200
those mosquitoes are the good PR but by
 

7859
02:28:37,200 --> 02:28:39,830
those mosquitoes are the good PR but by
far the biggest infectious disease uh

7860
02:28:39,830 --> 02:28:39,840
far the biggest infectious disease uh
 

7861
02:28:39,840 --> 02:28:42,650
far the biggest infectious disease uh
that got good PR if you will was HIV

7862
02:28:42,650 --> 02:28:42,660
that got good PR if you will was HIV
 

7863
02:28:42,660 --> 02:28:45,050
that got good PR if you will was HIV
right yes because and that and and I'm

7864
02:28:45,050 --> 02:28:45,060
right yes because and that and and I'm
 

7865
02:28:45,060 --> 02:28:47,030
right yes because and that and and I'm
not trying to compare and say oh it's

7866
02:28:47,030 --> 02:28:47,040
not trying to compare and say oh it's
 

7867
02:28:47,040 --> 02:28:49,969
not trying to compare and say oh it's
worse or better to have HIV than to

7868
02:28:49,969 --> 02:28:49,979
worse or better to have HIV than to
 

7869
02:28:49,979 --> 02:28:51,830
worse or better to have HIV than to
tuberculosis or anything but I'm simply

7870
02:28:51,830 --> 02:28:51,840
tuberculosis or anything but I'm simply
 

7871
02:28:51,840 --> 02:28:53,809
tuberculosis or anything but I'm simply
saying we are under funding because it

7872
02:28:53,809 --> 02:28:53,819
saying we are under funding because it
 

7873
02:28:53,819 --> 02:28:56,410
saying we are under funding because it
doesn't really get the public

7874
02:28:56,410 --> 02:28:56,420
doesn't really get the public
 

7875
02:28:56,420 --> 02:28:59,510
doesn't really get the public
attention we just yeah we don't spending

7876
02:28:59,510 --> 02:28:59,520
attention we just yeah we don't spending
 

7877
02:28:59,520 --> 02:29:01,670
attention we just yeah we don't spending
money on that as uh in terms of benefit

7878
02:29:01,670 --> 02:29:01,680
money on that as uh in terms of benefit
 

7879
02:29:01,680 --> 02:29:04,190
money on that as uh in terms of benefit
a much bigger impact so every dollar you

7880
02:29:04,190 --> 02:29:04,200
a much bigger impact so every dollar you
 

7881
02:29:04,200 --> 02:29:07,790
a much bigger impact so every dollar you
spend on TB will probably do about 43

7882
02:29:07,790 --> 02:29:07,800
spend on TB will probably do about 43
 

7883
02:29:07,800 --> 02:29:09,830
spend on TB will probably do about 43
dollars worth of good so we'll do an

7884
02:29:09,830 --> 02:29:09,840
dollars worth of good so we'll do an
 

7885
02:29:09,840 --> 02:29:11,389
dollars worth of good so we'll do an
amazing amount of good basically because

7886
02:29:11,389 --> 02:29:11,399
amazing amount of good basically because
 

7887
02:29:11,399 --> 02:29:13,130
amazing amount of good basically because
it'll save lives they'll make sure

7888
02:29:13,130 --> 02:29:13,140
it'll save lives they'll make sure
 

7889
02:29:13,140 --> 02:29:15,590
it'll save lives they'll make sure
parents stay with their kids and be more

7890
02:29:15,590 --> 02:29:15,600
parents stay with their kids and be more
 

7891
02:29:15,600 --> 02:29:17,690
parents stay with their kids and be more
productive of in their communities and

7892
02:29:17,690 --> 02:29:17,700
productive of in their communities and
 

7893
02:29:17,700 --> 02:29:19,309
productive of in their communities and
it'll you know have a lot of knock-on

7894
02:29:19,309 --> 02:29:19,319
it'll you know have a lot of knock-on
 

7895
02:29:19,319 --> 02:29:21,650
it'll you know have a lot of knock-on
effects and it's incredibly cheap to do

7896
02:29:21,650 --> 02:29:21,660
effects and it's incredibly cheap to do
 

7897
02:29:21,660 --> 02:29:24,170
effects and it's incredibly cheap to do
same thing with malaria it's mostly

7898
02:29:24,170 --> 02:29:24,180
same thing with malaria it's mostly
 

7899
02:29:24,180 --> 02:29:26,090
same thing with malaria it's mostly
mosquito Nets that we need to get out

7900
02:29:26,090 --> 02:29:26,100
mosquito Nets that we need to get out
 

7901
02:29:26,100 --> 02:29:28,429
mosquito Nets that we need to get out
and you're saying just the contrast with

7902
02:29:28,429 --> 02:29:28,439
and you're saying just the contrast with
 

7903
02:29:28,439 --> 02:29:30,650
and you're saying just the contrast with
climate change the dollar you spend on

7904
02:29:30,650 --> 02:29:30,660
climate change the dollar you spend on
 

7905
02:29:30,660 --> 02:29:32,929
climate change the dollar you spend on
no not climate change but decreasing

7906
02:29:32,929 --> 02:29:32,939
no not climate change but decreasing
 

7907
02:29:32,939 --> 02:29:34,370
no not climate change but decreasing
emissions

7908
02:29:34,370 --> 02:29:34,380
emissions
 

7909
02:29:34,380 --> 02:29:36,530
emissions
does not have does not come close to the

7910
02:29:36,530 --> 02:29:36,540
does not have does not come close to the
 

7911
02:29:36,540 --> 02:29:39,590
does not have does not come close to the
43 dollar benefit no nobody nobody would

7912
02:29:39,590 --> 02:29:39,600
43 dollar benefit no nobody nobody would
 

7913
02:29:39,600 --> 02:29:41,830
43 dollar benefit no nobody nobody would
ever argue that so very very

7914
02:29:41,830 --> 02:29:41,840
ever argue that so very very
 

7915
02:29:41,840 --> 02:29:44,809
ever argue that so very very
enthusiastic climate Advocates would

7916
02:29:44,809 --> 02:29:44,819
enthusiastic climate Advocates would
 

7917
02:29:44,819 --> 02:29:46,790
enthusiastic climate Advocates would
probably say it'll do two or three

7918
02:29:46,790 --> 02:29:46,800
probably say it'll do two or three
 

7919
02:29:46,800 --> 02:29:48,170
probably say it'll do two or three
dollars worth of good for every dollar

7920
02:29:48,170 --> 02:29:48,180
dollars worth of good for every dollar
 

7921
02:29:48,180 --> 02:29:50,210
dollars worth of good for every dollar
so you know it's still worthwhile to do

7922
02:29:50,210 --> 02:29:50,220
so you know it's still worthwhile to do
 

7923
02:29:50,220 --> 02:29:52,309
so you know it's still worthwhile to do
that's what they would say I would argue

7924
02:29:52,309 --> 02:29:52,319
that's what they would say I would argue
 

7925
02:29:52,319 --> 02:29:54,290
that's what they would say I would argue
and I think a lot of the evidence seems

7926
02:29:54,290 --> 02:29:54,300
and I think a lot of the evidence seems
 

7927
02:29:54,300 --> 02:29:55,969
and I think a lot of the evidence seems
to side that way that a lot of the

7928
02:29:55,969 --> 02:29:55,979
to side that way that a lot of the
 

7929
02:29:55,979 --> 02:29:57,710
to side that way that a lot of the
things that we're doing deliver actually

7930
02:29:57,710 --> 02:29:57,720
things that we're doing deliver actually
 

7931
02:29:57,720 --> 02:30:00,170
things that we're doing deliver actually
lessen it all or back but but it's

7932
02:30:00,170 --> 02:30:00,180
lessen it all or back but but it's
 

7933
02:30:00,180 --> 02:30:02,690
lessen it all or back but but it's
certainly not nearly the same kind of

7934
02:30:02,690 --> 02:30:02,700
certainly not nearly the same kind of
 

7935
02:30:02,700 --> 02:30:05,090
certainly not nearly the same kind of
place but there's many many other things

7936
02:30:05,090 --> 02:30:05,100
place but there's many many other things
 

7937
02:30:05,100 --> 02:30:07,309
place but there's many many other things
and you know just if if you'll allow me

7938
02:30:07,309 --> 02:30:07,319
and you know just if if you'll allow me
 

7939
02:30:07,319 --> 02:30:10,610
and you know just if if you'll allow me
yeah I love this but uh yeah there are

7940
02:30:10,610 --> 02:30:10,620
yeah I love this but uh yeah there are
 

7941
02:30:10,620 --> 02:30:12,290
yeah I love this but uh yeah there are
lots of other things for instance uh

7942
02:30:12,290 --> 02:30:12,300
lots of other things for instance uh
 

7943
02:30:12,300 --> 02:30:15,130
lots of other things for instance uh
e-procurement so uh you know it's

7944
02:30:15,130 --> 02:30:15,140
e-procurement so uh you know it's
 

7945
02:30:15,140 --> 02:30:18,050
e-procurement so uh you know it's
incredibly boring so most developing

7946
02:30:18,050 --> 02:30:18,060
incredibly boring so most developing
 

7947
02:30:18,060 --> 02:30:19,969
incredibly boring so most developing
countries well actually most governments

7948
02:30:19,969 --> 02:30:19,979
countries well actually most governments
 

7949
02:30:19,979 --> 02:30:21,950
countries well actually most governments
spend most of their money on procurement

7950
02:30:21,950 --> 02:30:21,960
spend most of their money on procurement
 

7951
02:30:21,960 --> 02:30:24,710
spend most of their money on procurement
is typically incredibly corrupt so we

7952
02:30:24,710 --> 02:30:24,720
is typically incredibly corrupt so we
 

7953
02:30:24,720 --> 02:30:27,349
is typically incredibly corrupt so we
did this project for Bangladesh uh where

7954
02:30:27,349 --> 02:30:27,359
did this project for Bangladesh uh where
 

7955
02:30:27,359 --> 02:30:29,090
did this project for Bangladesh uh where
can you explain procurement yes so

7956
02:30:29,090 --> 02:30:29,100
can you explain procurement yes so
 

7957
02:30:29,100 --> 02:30:32,870
can you explain procurement yes so
that's governments buying stuff so a

7958
02:30:32,870 --> 02:30:32,880
that's governments buying stuff so a
 

7959
02:30:32,880 --> 02:30:35,270
that's governments buying stuff so a
large part of the government revenue is

7960
02:30:35,270 --> 02:30:35,280
large part of the government revenue is
 

7961
02:30:35,280 --> 02:30:37,130
large part of the government revenue is
spent on buying anywhere anything from

7962
02:30:37,130 --> 02:30:37,140

you know Post-it notes to roads and

7964
02:30:39,650 --> 02:30:39,660
you know Post-it notes to roads and
 

7965
02:30:39,660 --> 02:30:41,450
you know Post-it notes to roads and
obviously you know roads are much much

7966
02:30:41,450 --> 02:30:41,460
obviously you know roads are much much
 

7967
02:30:41,460 --> 02:30:43,010
obviously you know roads are much much
more expensive it's mostly

7968
02:30:43,010 --> 02:30:43,020
more expensive it's mostly
 

7969
02:30:43,020 --> 02:30:46,190
more expensive it's mostly
infrastructure stuff hugely corrupt uh

7970
02:30:46,190 --> 02:30:46,200
infrastructure stuff hugely corrupt uh
 

7971
02:30:46,200 --> 02:30:48,349
infrastructure stuff hugely corrupt uh
for instance in Bangladesh

7972
02:30:48,349 --> 02:30:48,359
for instance in Bangladesh
 

7973
02:30:48,359 --> 02:30:50,090
for instance in Bangladesh
um it would already have been decided

7974
02:30:50,090 --> 02:30:50,100
um it would already have been decided
 

7975
02:30:50,100 --> 02:30:52,070
um it would already have been decided
among the ruling Elite in that local

7976
02:30:52,070 --> 02:30:52,080
among the ruling Elite in that local
 

7977
02:30:52,080 --> 02:30:54,590
among the ruling Elite in that local
area who's going to get this so they'll

7978
02:30:54,590 --> 02:30:54,600
area who's going to get this so they'll
 

7979
02:30:54,600 --> 02:30:56,570
area who's going to get this so they'll
have this bidding competition where you

7980
02:30:56,570 --> 02:30:56,580
have this bidding competition where you
 

7981
02:30:56,580 --> 02:30:58,550
have this bidding competition where you
have to hand in an envelope a seal

7982
02:30:58,550 --> 02:30:58,560
have to hand in an envelope a seal
 

7983
02:30:58,560 --> 02:31:01,969
have to hand in an envelope a seal
envelope with your bid on it but you put

7984
02:31:01,969 --> 02:31:01,979
envelope with your bid on it but you put
 

7985
02:31:01,979 --> 02:31:04,370
envelope with your bid on it but you put
a goon outside the office so you

7986
02:31:04,370 --> 02:31:04,380
a goon outside the office so you
 

7987
02:31:04,380 --> 02:31:06,530
a goon outside the office so you
literally physically can't get in with

7988
02:31:06,530 --> 02:31:06,540
literally physically can't get in with
 

7989
02:31:06,540 --> 02:31:08,270
literally physically can't get in with
your uh with your bid

7990
02:31:08,270 --> 02:31:08,280
your uh with your bid
 

7991
02:31:08,280 --> 02:31:10,670
your uh with your bid
now what we found and this is you know

7992
02:31:10,670 --> 02:31:10,680
now what we found and this is you know
 

7993
02:31:10,680 --> 02:31:13,429
now what we found and this is you know
I'm not I'm not claiming any sort of

7994
02:31:13,429 --> 02:31:13,439
I'm not I'm not claiming any sort of
 

7995
02:31:13,439 --> 02:31:15,170
I'm not I'm not claiming any sort of
ownership to this a lot of smart people

7996
02:31:15,170 --> 02:31:15,180
ownership to this a lot of smart people
 

7997
02:31:15,180 --> 02:31:16,969
ownership to this a lot of smart people
have done this way before we're just

7998
02:31:16,969 --> 02:31:16,979
have done this way before we're just
 

7999
02:31:16,979 --> 02:31:19,670
have done this way before we're just
simply proving that it's a good idea

8000
02:31:19,670 --> 02:31:19,680
simply proving that it's a good idea
 

8001
02:31:19,680 --> 02:31:21,650
simply proving that it's a good idea
um it turns out that if you put this on

8002
02:31:21,650 --> 02:31:21,660
um it turns out that if you put this on
 

8003
02:31:21,660 --> 02:31:23,450
um it turns out that if you put this on
eBay essentially so if you do an

8004
02:31:23,450 --> 02:31:23,460
eBay essentially so if you do an
 

8005
02:31:23,460 --> 02:31:26,270
eBay essentially so if you do an
e-procurement system where bidders can

8006
02:31:26,270 --> 02:31:26,280
e-procurement system where bidders can
 

8007
02:31:26,280 --> 02:31:28,730
e-procurement system where bidders can
come in suddenly it becomes harder to

8008
02:31:28,730 --> 02:31:28,740
come in suddenly it becomes harder to
 

8009
02:31:28,740 --> 02:31:30,650
come in suddenly it becomes harder to
put up the Goon you can still do it but

8010
02:31:30,650 --> 02:31:30,660
put up the Goon you can still do it but
 

8011
02:31:30,660 --> 02:31:32,929
put up the Goon you can still do it but
it's harder to do it it also means you

8012
02:31:32,929 --> 02:31:32,939
it's harder to do it it also means you
 

8013
02:31:32,939 --> 02:31:35,990
it's harder to do it it also means you
get bits from all over Bangladesh and

8014
02:31:35,990 --> 02:31:36,000
get bits from all over Bangladesh and
 

8015
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,630
get bits from all over Bangladesh and
and in general you'll get bids from all

8016
02:31:38,630 --> 02:31:38,640
and in general you'll get bids from all
 

8017
02:31:38,640 --> 02:31:40,370
and in general you'll get bids from all
over actually turns out you get better

8018
02:31:40,370 --> 02:31:40,380
over actually turns out you get better
 

8019
02:31:40,380 --> 02:31:43,490
over actually turns out you get better
quality but most important is you get it

8020
02:31:43,490 --> 02:31:43,500
quality but most important is you get it
 

8021
02:31:43,500 --> 02:31:46,010
quality but most important is you get it
much cheaper so basically you can simply

8022
02:31:46,010 --> 02:31:46,020
much cheaper so basically you can simply
 

8023
02:31:46,020 --> 02:31:48,230
much cheaper so basically you can simply
save money so we we did a scaled

8024
02:31:48,230 --> 02:31:48,240
save money so we we did a scaled
 

8025
02:31:48,240 --> 02:31:49,969
save money so we we did a scaled
experiment in Bangladesh where we had

8026
02:31:49,969 --> 02:31:49,979
experiment in Bangladesh where we had
 

8027
02:31:49,979 --> 02:31:52,670
experiment in Bangladesh where we had
about four percent go to uh to be uh

8028
02:31:52,670 --> 02:31:52,680
about four percent go to uh to be uh
 

8029
02:31:52,680 --> 02:31:54,469
about four percent go to uh to be uh
e-procurement and you could compare what

8030
02:31:54,469 --> 02:31:54,479
e-procurement and you could compare what
 

8031
02:31:54,479 --> 02:31:56,570
e-procurement and you could compare what
it would have cost and then what it did

8032
02:31:56,570 --> 02:31:56,580
it would have cost and then what it did
 

8033
02:31:56,580 --> 02:31:59,510
it would have cost and then what it did
cost and the average reduction was as I

8034
02:31:59,510 --> 02:31:59,520
cost and the average reduction was as I
 

8035
02:31:59,520 --> 02:32:01,910
cost and the average reduction was as I
remember it's seven percent and the

8036
02:32:01,910 --> 02:32:01,920
remember it's seven percent and the
 

8037
02:32:01,920 --> 02:32:03,530
remember it's seven percent and the
Finance Minister loved it you know

8038
02:32:03,530 --> 02:32:03,540
Finance Minister loved it you know
 

8039
02:32:03,540 --> 02:32:05,750
Finance Minister loved it you know
because that basically gives him a lot

8040
02:32:05,750 --> 02:32:05,760
because that basically gives him a lot
 

8041
02:32:05,760 --> 02:32:07,490
because that basically gives him a lot
more money or you know you can buy more

8042
02:32:07,490 --> 02:32:07,500
more money or you know you can buy more
 

8043
02:32:07,500 --> 02:32:09,349
more money or you know you can buy more
stuff at the same cost no digital

8044
02:32:09,349 --> 02:32:09,359
stuff at the same cost no digital
 

8045
02:32:09,359 --> 02:32:10,550
stuff at the same cost no digital
corruption

8046
02:32:10,550 --> 02:32:10,560
corruption
 

8047
02:32:10,560 --> 02:32:12,770
corruption
so it's it's basically you get rid of

8048
02:32:12,770 --> 02:32:12,780
so it's it's basically you get rid of
 

8049
02:32:12,780 --> 02:32:14,210
so it's it's basically you get rid of
some corruption there'll still be

8050
02:32:14,210 --> 02:32:14,220
some corruption there'll still be
 

8051
02:32:14,220 --> 02:32:16,610
some corruption there'll still be
corruption but less corruption Ukraine

8052
02:32:16,610 --> 02:32:16,620
corruption but less corruption Ukraine
 

8053
02:32:16,620 --> 02:32:18,349
corruption but less corruption Ukraine
has actually been big on this they I

8054
02:32:18,349 --> 02:32:18,359
has actually been big on this they I
 

8055
02:32:18,359 --> 02:32:19,969
has actually been big on this they I
have talked to them I talked to the

8056
02:32:19,969 --> 02:32:19,979
have talked to them I talked to the
 

8057
02:32:19,979 --> 02:32:22,070
have talked to them I talked to the
digital transformation Minister it's

8058
02:32:22,070 --> 02:32:22,080
digital transformation Minister it's
 

8059
02:32:22,080 --> 02:32:23,870
digital transformation Minister it's
kind of incredible I mean this is before

8060
02:32:23,870 --> 02:32:23,880
kind of incredible I mean this is before
 

8061
02:32:23,880 --> 02:32:27,830
kind of incredible I mean this is before
the war but still working uh it's like

8062
02:32:27,830 --> 02:32:27,840
the war but still working uh it's like
 

8063
02:32:27,840 --> 02:32:29,750
the war but still working uh it's like
the entirety of the government is in an

8064
02:32:29,750 --> 02:32:29,760
the entirety of the government is in an
 

8065
02:32:29,760 --> 02:32:33,590
the entirety of the government is in an
app and that one of the big effects

8066
02:32:33,590 --> 02:32:33,600
app and that one of the big effects
 

8067
02:32:33,600 --> 02:32:36,830
app and that one of the big effects
is the reduction of corruption and not

8068
02:32:36,830 --> 02:32:36,840
is the reduction of corruption and not
 

8069
02:32:36,840 --> 02:32:39,469
is the reduction of corruption and not
like from uh this was a politician say

8070
02:32:39,469 --> 02:32:39,479
like from uh this was a politician say
 

8071
02:32:39,479 --> 02:32:41,570
like from uh this was a politician say
to say we've reduced we've taken these

8072
02:32:41,570 --> 02:32:41,580
to say we've reduced we've taken these
 

8073
02:32:41,580 --> 02:32:42,950
to say we've reduced we've taken these
actions through this court no it

8074
02:32:42,950 --> 02:32:42,960
actions through this court no it
 

8075
02:32:42,960 --> 02:32:45,110
actions through this court no it
literally is just much more difficult to

8076
02:32:45,110 --> 02:32:45,120
literally is just much more difficult to
 

8077
02:32:45,120 --> 02:32:47,870
literally is just much more difficult to
be corrupt yeah the incentives aren't

8078
02:32:47,870 --> 02:32:47,880
be corrupt yeah the incentives aren't
 

8079
02:32:47,880 --> 02:32:49,849
be corrupt yeah the incentives aren't
quite there and they there's friction

8080
02:32:49,849 --> 02:32:49,859
quite there and they there's friction
 

8081
02:32:49,859 --> 02:32:52,490
quite there and they there's friction
for corruption yeah oh yeah yeah so

8082
02:32:52,490 --> 02:32:52,500
for corruption yeah oh yeah yeah so
 

8083
02:32:52,500 --> 02:32:54,770
for corruption yeah oh yeah yeah so
basically uh you can spend a little bit

8084
02:32:54,770 --> 02:32:54,780
basically uh you can spend a little bit
 

8085
02:32:54,780 --> 02:32:56,990
basically uh you can spend a little bit
of money and you can make a huge benefit

8086
02:32:56,990 --> 02:32:57,000
of money and you can make a huge benefit
 

8087
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:58,730
of money and you can make a huge benefit
there's still about 70 countries that

8088
02:32:58,730 --> 02:32:58,740
there's still about 70 countries that
 

8089
02:32:58,740 --> 02:33:01,070
there's still about 70 countries that
haven't gone e-procurement so obviously

8090
02:33:01,070 --> 02:33:01,080
haven't gone e-procurement so obviously
 

8091
02:33:01,080 --> 02:33:03,170
haven't gone e-procurement so obviously
they should do that food for small kids

8092
02:33:03,170 --> 02:33:03,180
they should do that food for small kids
 

8093
02:33:03,180 --> 02:33:05,510
they should do that food for small kids
another thing so you know uh basically

8094
02:33:05,510 --> 02:33:05,520
another thing so you know uh basically
 

8095
02:33:05,520 --> 02:33:07,130
another thing so you know uh basically
you know it's morally wrong that people

8096
02:33:07,130 --> 02:33:07,140
you know it's morally wrong that people
 

8097
02:33:07,140 --> 02:33:10,610
you know it's morally wrong that people
are starving uh but it also turns out

8098
02:33:10,610 --> 02:33:10,620
are starving uh but it also turns out
 

8099
02:33:10,620 --> 02:33:13,550
are starving uh but it also turns out
that it's a really really dumb thing not

8100
02:33:13,550 --> 02:33:13,560
that it's a really really dumb thing not
 

8101
02:33:13,560 --> 02:33:16,130
that it's a really really dumb thing not
to get kids good food because if you get

8102
02:33:16,130 --> 02:33:16,140
to get kids good food because if you get
 

8103
02:33:16,140 --> 02:33:18,290
to get kids good food because if you get
them good food their brains develop more

8104
02:33:18,290 --> 02:33:18,300
them good food their brains develop more
 

8105
02:33:18,300 --> 02:33:20,630
them good food their brains develop more
so that when they get into school they

8106
02:33:20,630 --> 02:33:20,640
so that when they get into school they
 

8107
02:33:20,640 --> 02:33:22,849
so that when they get into school they
learn more and so when they come out in

8108
02:33:22,849 --> 02:33:22,859
learn more and so when they come out in
 

8109
02:33:22,859 --> 02:33:24,950
learn more and so when they come out in
adult lives they're much more productive

8110
02:33:24,950 --> 02:33:24,960
adult lives they're much more productive
 

8111
02:33:24,960 --> 02:33:28,730
adult lives they're much more productive
so we can actually make every kid in

8112
02:33:28,730 --> 02:33:28,740
so we can actually make every kid in
 

8113
02:33:28,740 --> 02:33:30,770
so we can actually make every kid in
especially in developing countries much

8114
02:33:30,770 --> 02:33:30,780
especially in developing countries much
 

8115
02:33:30,780 --> 02:33:32,750
especially in developing countries much
more productive by making sure they get

8116
02:33:32,750 --> 02:33:32,760
more productive by making sure they get
 

8117
02:33:32,760 --> 02:33:35,030
more productive by making sure they get
good food so getting good food is not

8118
02:33:35,030 --> 02:33:35,040
good food so getting good food is not
 

8119
02:33:35,040 --> 02:33:37,130
good food so getting good food is not
cost free so it probably cost about a

8120
02:33:37,130 --> 02:33:37,140
cost free so it probably cost about a
 

8121
02:33:37,140 --> 02:33:39,349
cost free so it probably cost about a
hundred dollars uh both in and you you

8122
02:33:39,349 --> 02:33:39,359
hundred dollars uh both in and you you
 

8123
02:33:39,359 --> 02:33:42,110
hundred dollars uh both in and you you
need some uh directed advertisement you

8124
02:33:42,110 --> 02:33:42,120
need some uh directed advertisement you
 

8125
02:33:42,120 --> 02:33:43,670
need some uh directed advertisement you
need to make sure that you actually get

8126
02:33:43,670 --> 02:33:43,680
need to make sure that you actually get
 

8127
02:33:43,680 --> 02:33:45,469
need to make sure that you actually get
some of the food out there that you help

8128
02:33:45,469 --> 02:33:45,479
some of the food out there that you help
 

8129
02:33:45,479 --> 02:33:46,969
some of the food out there that you help
the families and you also make sure you

8130
02:33:46,969 --> 02:33:46,979
the families and you also make sure you
 

8131
02:33:46,979 --> 02:33:48,410
the families and you also make sure you
don't just give it to everyone because

8132
02:33:48,410 --> 02:33:48,420
don't just give it to everyone because
 

8133
02:33:48,420 --> 02:33:50,750
don't just give it to everyone because
then it becomes a lot more expensive if

8134
02:33:50,750 --> 02:33:50,760
then it becomes a lot more expensive if
 

8135
02:33:50,760 --> 02:33:52,490
then it becomes a lot more expensive if
you do that right it costs about a

8136
02:33:52,490 --> 02:33:52,500
you do that right it costs about a
 

8137
02:33:52,500 --> 02:33:55,150
you do that right it costs about a
hundred dollars per kid but

8138
02:33:55,150 --> 02:33:55,160
hundred dollars per kid but
 

8139
02:33:55,160 --> 02:33:57,650
hundred dollars per kid but
for two years so it's for their first

8140
02:33:57,650 --> 02:33:57,660
for two years so it's for their first
 

8141
02:33:57,660 --> 02:33:59,870
for two years so it's for their first
two years of life

8142
02:33:59,870 --> 02:33:59,880
two years of life
 

8143
02:33:59,880 --> 02:34:01,849
two years of life
um and if you do that

8144
02:34:01,849 --> 02:34:01,859
um and if you do that
 

8145
02:34:01,859 --> 02:34:04,429
um and if you do that
you then get a benefit in that they

8146
02:34:04,429 --> 02:34:04,439
you then get a benefit in that they
 

8147
02:34:04,439 --> 02:34:06,469
you then get a benefit in that they
become smarter and go longer to school

8148
02:34:06,469 --> 02:34:06,479
become smarter and go longer to school
 

8149
02:34:06,479 --> 02:34:08,330
become smarter and go longer to school
and they actually learn more and become

8150
02:34:08,330 --> 02:34:08,340
and they actually learn more and become
 

8151
02:34:08,340 --> 02:34:10,849
and they actually learn more and become
more productive of forty five hundred

8152
02:34:10,849 --> 02:34:10,859
more productive of forty five hundred
 

8153
02:34:10,859 --> 02:34:12,950
more productive of forty five hundred
dollars remember this is far out into

8154
02:34:12,950 --> 02:34:12,960
dollars remember this is far out into
 

8155
02:34:12,960 --> 02:34:15,710
dollars remember this is far out into
the future so the this is discounted the

8156
02:34:15,710 --> 02:34:15,720
the future so the this is discounted the
 

8157
02:34:15,720 --> 02:34:17,330
the future so the this is discounted the
benefit is actually much higher and this

8158
02:34:17,330 --> 02:34:17,340
benefit is actually much higher and this
 

8159
02:34:17,340 --> 02:34:18,830
benefit is actually much higher and this
is one of the things that we also have a

8160
02:34:18,830 --> 02:34:18,840
is one of the things that we also have a
 

8161
02:34:18,840 --> 02:34:20,690
is one of the things that we also have a
conversation about in in climate change

8162
02:34:20,690 --> 02:34:20,700
conversation about in in climate change
 

8163
02:34:20,700 --> 02:34:22,429
conversation about in in climate change
because all and when you talk about

8164
02:34:22,429 --> 02:34:22,439
because all and when you talk about
 

8165
02:34:22,439 --> 02:34:24,590
because all and when you talk about
climate change costs and benefits all

8166
02:34:24,590 --> 02:34:24,600
climate change costs and benefits all
 

8167
02:34:24,600 --> 02:34:26,330
climate change costs and benefits all
the costs are now and all the benefits

8168
02:34:26,330 --> 02:34:26,340
the costs are now and all the benefits
 

8169
02:34:26,340 --> 02:34:27,889
the costs are now and all the benefits
are in the future but it's just like

8170
02:34:27,889 --> 02:34:27,899
are in the future but it's just like
 

8171
02:34:27,899 --> 02:34:29,929
are in the future but it's just like
that in education you know all the costs

8172
02:34:29,929 --> 02:34:29,939
that in education you know all the costs
 

8173
02:34:29,939 --> 02:34:32,389
that in education you know all the costs
are now all the benefits are far into

8174
02:34:32,389 --> 02:34:32,399
are now all the benefits are far into
 

8175
02:34:32,399 --> 02:34:34,429
are now all the benefits are far into
the future and if you try to do that

8176
02:34:34,429 --> 02:34:34,439
the future and if you try to do that
 

8177
02:34:34,439 --> 02:34:35,630
the future and if you try to do that
right and that's a whole other

8178
02:34:35,630 --> 02:34:35,640
right and that's a whole other
 

8179
02:34:35,640 --> 02:34:38,510
right and that's a whole other
conversation that we could have uh then

8180
02:34:38,510 --> 02:34:38,520
conversation that we could have uh then
 

8181
02:34:38,520 --> 02:34:40,309
conversation that we could have uh then
it turns out that for every dollar spent

8182
02:34:40,309 --> 02:34:40,319
it turns out that for every dollar spent
 

8183
02:34:40,319 --> 02:34:43,190
it turns out that for every dollar spent
you do 45 dollars worth of good again

8184
02:34:43,190 --> 02:34:43,200
you do 45 dollars worth of good again
 

8185
02:34:43,200 --> 02:34:46,370
you do 45 dollars worth of good again
remember about a a third of all kids

8186
02:34:46,370 --> 02:34:46,380
remember about a a third of all kids
 

8187
02:34:46,380 --> 02:34:48,530
remember about a a third of all kids
that go to school right now just don't

8188
02:34:48,530 --> 02:34:48,540
that go to school right now just don't
 

8189
02:34:48,540 --> 02:34:52,130
that go to school right now just don't
learn pretty much anything yeah and if

8190
02:34:52,130 --> 02:34:52,140
learn pretty much anything yeah and if
 

8191
02:34:52,140 --> 02:34:53,929
learn pretty much anything yeah and if
we could make them more productive in

8192
02:34:53,929 --> 02:34:53,939
we could make them more productive in
 

8193
02:34:53,939 --> 02:34:55,130
we could make them more productive in
the school system we have another

8194
02:34:55,130 --> 02:34:55,140
the school system we have another
 

8195
02:34:55,140 --> 02:34:56,990
the school system we have another
proposal and how to do that in the in

8196
02:34:56,990 --> 02:34:57,000
proposal and how to do that in the in
 

8197
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:59,030
proposal and how to do that in the in
the school system but you know by just

8198
02:34:59,030 --> 02:34:59,040
the school system but you know by just

simply making sure that they're that
 

8201
02:35:00,540 --> 02:35:01,790
simply making sure that they're that
they're smarter when they get into

8202
02:35:01,790 --> 02:35:01,800
they're smarter when they get into
 

8203
02:35:01,800 --> 02:35:04,309
they're smarter when they get into
School we've been focusing so much on

should I just go out and start working
instead uh you know there's there's

8240
02:35:41,270 --> 02:35:41,280
instead uh you know there's there's
 

8241
02:35:41,280 --> 02:35:42,830
instead uh you know there's there's
constant disruption there's a lot of

8242
02:35:42,830 --> 02:35:42,840
constant disruption there's a lot of
 

8243
02:35:42,840 --> 02:35:44,929
constant disruption there's a lot of
teachers that don't show up in India you

8244
02:35:44,929 --> 02:35:44,939
teachers that don't show up in India you
 

8245
02:35:44,939 --> 02:35:46,969
teachers that don't show up in India you
know you have uh you have this absurd

8246
02:35:46,969 --> 02:35:46,979
know you have uh you have this absurd
 

8247
02:35:46,979 --> 02:35:48,889
know you have uh you have this absurd
situation where all the teachers are

8248
02:35:48,889 --> 02:35:48,899
situation where all the teachers are
 

8249
02:35:48,899 --> 02:35:52,250
situation where all the teachers are
basically paid and hired for eternity

8250
02:35:52,250 --> 02:35:52,260
basically paid and hired for eternity
 

8251
02:35:52,260 --> 02:35:54,230
basically paid and hired for eternity
for the rest of their lives and so not

8252
02:35:54,230 --> 02:35:54,240
for the rest of their lives and so not
 

8253
02:35:54,240 --> 02:35:56,090
for the rest of their lives and so not
surprisingly a lot of them decide not to

8254
02:35:56,090 --> 02:35:56,100
surprisingly a lot of them decide not to
 

8255
02:35:56,100 --> 02:35:59,210
surprisingly a lot of them decide not to
show up so now they've hired assistant

8256
02:35:59,210 --> 02:35:59,220
show up so now they've hired assistant
 

8257
02:35:59,220 --> 02:36:01,490
show up so now they've hired assistant
teachers that basically have taken over

8258
02:36:01,490 --> 02:36:01,500
teachers that basically have taken over
 

8259
02:36:01,500 --> 02:36:03,349
teachers that basically have taken over
so they're paying you know for I think

8260
02:36:03,349 --> 02:36:03,359
so they're paying you know for I think
 

8261
02:36:03,359 --> 02:36:06,349
so they're paying you know for I think
it's seven million teachers that I'm not

8262
02:36:06,349 --> 02:36:06,359
it's seven million teachers that I'm not
 

8263
02:36:06,359 --> 02:36:08,210
it's seven million teachers that I'm not
saying they're not all all not working

8264
02:36:08,210 --> 02:36:08,220
saying they're not all all not working
 

8265
02:36:08,220 --> 02:36:10,190
saying they're not all all not working
but a lot of them are not working as

8266
02:36:10,190 --> 02:36:10,200
but a lot of them are not working as
 

8267
02:36:10,200 --> 02:36:12,050
but a lot of them are not working as
much as they should and we now hired

8268
02:36:12,050 --> 02:36:12,060
much as they should and we now hired
 

8269
02:36:12,060 --> 02:36:14,090
much as they should and we now hired
another seven million teachers that have

8270
02:36:14,090 --> 02:36:14,100
another seven million teachers that have
 

8271
02:36:14,100 --> 02:36:16,190

better right now because they're you
 

8277
02:36:19,260 --> 02:36:21,170
better right now because they're you
know they're they're not on on permanent

empowerment contracts and then you have
 

8283
02:36:24,060 --> 02:36:25,910

these issues and you know it's just
 

8287
02:36:27,359 --> 02:36:29,210
these issues and you know it's just
simply about saying we can't fix all

problems but there are some problems
 

8291
02:36:31,200 --> 02:36:32,990

we actually did a a whole project back

8592
02:42:12,170 --> 02:42:12,180
we actually did a a whole project back
 

8593
02:42:12,180 --> 02:42:15,050
we actually did a a whole project back

Circus was coming to Copenhagen and we

8596
02:42:17,630 --> 02:42:17,640
Circus was coming to Copenhagen and we
 

8597
02:42:17,640 --> 02:42:19,190
Circus was coming to Copenhagen and we
were going to save the world there

8598
02:42:19,190 --> 02:42:19,200
were going to save the world there
 

8599
02:42:19,200 --> 02:42:22,190
were going to save the world there
uh we brought together about 50 climate

8600
02:42:22,190 --> 02:42:22,200
uh we brought together about 50 climate
 

8601
02:42:22,200 --> 02:42:23,870
uh we brought together about 50 climate

look at where can you spend a dollar and

8604
02:42:25,429 --> 02:42:25,439
look at where can you spend a dollar and
 

8605
02:42:25,439 --> 02:42:27,830
look at where can you spend a dollar and
do the most good for climate and what

8606
02:42:27,830 --> 02:42:27,840
do the most good for climate and what
 

8607
02:42:27,840 --> 02:42:29,450
do the most good for climate and what
they found was a lot of these things as

02:42:29,450 --> 02:42:29,460
they found was a lot of these things as
 

8609
02:42:29,460 --> 02:42:31,250

02:42:31,250 --> 02:42:31,260
we've been talking about before that
 

8611
02:42:31,260 --> 02:42:33,530
we've been talking about before that
that basically investing in in the

that basically investing in in the
 

8613
02:42:33,540 --> 02:42:35,389
that basically investing in in the

current sort of technology that we're
 

8615
02:42:35,399 --> 02:42:39,469
current sort of technology that we're
trying very hard is at best at pretty

02:42:39,469 --> 02:42:39,479
trying very hard is at best at pretty
 

8617
02:42:39,479 --> 02:42:42,170
trying very hard is at best at pretty
dicey outcome uh much of it's probably

8618
02:42:42,170 --> 02:42:42,180
dicey outcome uh much of it's probably
 

8619
02:42:42,180 --> 02:42:45,290

02:42:45,290 --> 02:42:45,300
less than a dollar back in the dollar uh
 

8621
02:42:45,300 --> 02:42:47,630
less than a dollar back in the dollar uh
there's some uh Investments and on

8622
02:42:47,630 --> 02:42:47,640
there's some uh Investments and on
 

8623
02:42:47,640 --> 02:42:49,490
there's some uh Investments and on
adaptation for instance that's pretty

8624
02:42:49,490 --> 02:42:49,500
adaptation for instance that's pretty
 

8625
02:42:49,500 --> 02:42:51,230
adaptation for instance that's pretty
good but it's you know sort of two three

8626
02:42:51,230 --> 02:42:51,240
good but it's you know sort of two three
 

8627
02:42:51,240 --> 02:42:53,110
good but it's you know sort of two three
dollars back in the dollar

8628
02:42:53,110 --> 02:42:53,120
dollars back in the dollar
 

8629
02:42:53,120 --> 02:42:55,309
dollars back in the dollar
the obvious thing is that you built a

8630
02:42:55,309 --> 02:42:55,319
the obvious thing is that you built a
 

8631
02:42:55,319 --> 02:42:58,250
the obvious thing is that you built a
dike for a sea level rise or that you

8632
02:42:58,250 --> 02:42:58,260
dike for a sea level rise or that you
 

8633
02:42:58,260 --> 02:43:00,770
dike for a sea level rise or that you
make people uh you get some apps that

8634
02:43:00,770 --> 02:43:00,780
make people uh you get some apps that
 

8635
02:43:00,780 --> 02:43:02,450
make people uh you get some apps that
people know that there's a hurricane

8636
02:43:02,450 --> 02:43:02,460
people know that there's a hurricane
 

8637
02:43:02,460 --> 02:43:05,090
people know that there's a hurricane
coming or that you know so you can adapt

8638
02:43:05,090 --> 02:43:05,100
coming or that you know so you can adapt
 

8639
02:43:05,100 --> 02:43:06,950
coming or that you know so you can adapt
infrastructure right yeah it is the

8640
02:43:06,950 --> 02:43:06,960
infrastructure right yeah it is the
 

8641
02:43:06,960 --> 02:43:08,570
infrastructure right yeah it is the
physical and the digital infrastructure

8642
02:43:08,570 --> 02:43:08,580
physical and the digital infrastructure
 

8643
02:43:08,580 --> 02:43:10,730
physical and the digital infrastructure
the point is that people are really good

8644
02:43:10,730 --> 02:43:10,740
the point is that people are really good
 

8645
02:43:10,740 --> 02:43:12,950
the point is that people are really good
at doing this already because they have

8646
02:43:12,950 --> 02:43:12,960
at doing this already because they have
 

8647
02:43:12,960 --> 02:43:15,110
at doing this already because they have
a strong incentive to do it so the extra

8648
02:43:15,110 --> 02:43:15,120
a strong incentive to do it so the extra
 

8649
02:43:15,120 --> 02:43:17,150
a strong incentive to do it so the extra
thing that governments can do outside is

8650
02:43:17,150 --> 02:43:17,160
thing that governments can do outside is
 

8651
02:43:17,160 --> 02:43:19,190
thing that governments can do outside is
somewhat good but it's not amazing or

8652
02:43:19,190 --> 02:43:19,200
somewhat good but it's not amazing or
 

8653
02:43:19,200 --> 02:43:21,770
somewhat good but it's not amazing or
anything what we found by far the best

8654
02:43:21,770 --> 02:43:21,780
anything what we found by far the best
 

8655
02:43:21,780 --> 02:43:25,849
anything what we found by far the best
uh investment in the long run was on

8656
02:43:25,849 --> 02:43:25,859
uh investment in the long run was on
 

8657
02:43:25,859 --> 02:43:28,910
uh investment in the long run was on
investment in energy Innovation so and

8658
02:43:28,910 --> 02:43:28,920
investment in energy Innovation so and
 

8659
02:43:28,920 --> 02:43:30,469
investment in energy Innovation so and
and I think this also sort of

8660
02:43:30,469 --> 02:43:30,479
and I think this also sort of
 

8661
02:43:30,479 --> 02:43:32,809
and I think this also sort of
corresponds with what we would think in

8662
02:43:32,809 --> 02:43:32,819
corresponds with what we would think in
 

8663
02:43:32,819 --> 02:43:35,570
corresponds with what we would think in
general uh if we could innovate so you

8664
02:43:35,570 --> 02:43:35,580
general uh if we could innovate so you
 

8665
02:43:35,580 --> 02:43:37,010
general uh if we could innovate so you
know for instance Bill Gates is arguing

8666
02:43:37,010 --> 02:43:37,020
know for instance Bill Gates is arguing
 

8667
02:43:37,020 --> 02:43:38,809
know for instance Bill Gates is arguing
we should have fourth generation Nuclear

8668
02:43:38,809 --> 02:43:38,819
we should have fourth generation Nuclear
 

8669
02:43:38,819 --> 02:43:41,630
we should have fourth generation Nuclear
So the next uh the more advanced than

8670
02:43:41,630 --> 02:43:41,640
So the next uh the more advanced than
 

8671
02:43:41,640 --> 02:43:43,250
So the next uh the more advanced than
what we currently have in third

8672
02:43:43,250 --> 02:43:43,260
what we currently have in third
 

8673
02:43:43,260 --> 02:43:45,770
what we currently have in third
generation nuclear which would be uh

8674
02:43:45,770 --> 02:43:45,780
generation nuclear which would be uh
 

8675
02:43:45,780 --> 02:43:48,290
generation nuclear which would be uh
industrial scale process you'd just be

8676
02:43:48,290 --> 02:43:48,300
industrial scale process you'd just be
 

8677
02:43:48,300 --> 02:43:50,450
industrial scale process you'd just be
building these you know uh modular

8678
02:43:50,450 --> 02:43:50,460
building these you know uh modular
 

8679
02:43:50,460 --> 02:43:52,730
building these you know uh modular
nuclear power plants they would be

8680
02:43:52,730 --> 02:43:52,740
nuclear power plants they would be
 

8681
02:43:52,740 --> 02:43:55,010
nuclear power plants they would be
instead of being these artwork that we

8682
02:43:55,010 --> 02:43:55,020
instead of being these artwork that we
 

8683
02:43:55,020 --> 02:43:57,290
instead of being these artwork that we
design once for every different plant

8684
02:43:57,290 --> 02:43:57,300
design once for every different plant
 

8685
02:43:57,300 --> 02:43:58,670
design once for every different plant
which is one of the reasons why they're

8686
02:43:58,670 --> 02:43:58,680
which is one of the reasons why they're
 

8687
02:43:58,680 --> 02:44:00,530
which is one of the reasons why they're
so expensive they would just be mass

8688
02:44:00,530 --> 02:44:00,540
so expensive they would just be mass
 

8689
02:44:00,540 --> 02:44:03,170
so expensive they would just be mass
produced and you'd have one you know uh

8690
02:44:03,170 --> 02:44:03,180
produced and you'd have one you know uh
 

8691
02:44:03,180 --> 02:44:05,870
produced and you'd have one you know uh
uh they'd all be recognized in one go so

8692
02:44:05,870 --> 02:44:05,880
uh they'd all be recognized in one go so
 

8693
02:44:05,880 --> 02:44:07,730
uh they'd all be recognized in one go so
be much cheaper they would also be

8694
02:44:07,730 --> 02:44:07,740
be much cheaper they would also be
 

8695
02:44:07,740 --> 02:44:11,090
be much cheaper they would also be
passively safe so uh if if all the power

8696
02:44:11,090 --> 02:44:11,100
passively safe so uh if if all the power
 

8697
02:44:11,100 --> 02:44:13,670
passively safe so uh if if all the power
goes they'll shut down rather than go

8698
02:44:13,670 --> 02:44:13,680
goes they'll shut down rather than go
 

8699
02:44:13,680 --> 02:44:16,309
goes they'll shut down rather than go
boom uh so that's that's another very

8700
02:44:16,309 --> 02:44:16,319
boom uh so that's that's another very
 

8701
02:44:16,319 --> 02:44:18,530
boom uh so that's that's another very
good thing and then they'll also uh be

8702
02:44:18,530 --> 02:44:18,540
good thing and then they'll also uh be
 

8703
02:44:18,540 --> 02:44:21,050
good thing and then they'll also uh be
very hard to transform into nuclear uh

8704
02:44:21,050 --> 02:44:21,060
very hard to transform into nuclear uh
 

8705
02:44:21,060 --> 02:44:23,570
very hard to transform into nuclear uh
weapons so you can actually imagine them

8706
02:44:23,570 --> 02:44:23,580
weapons so you can actually imagine them
 

8707
02:44:23,580 --> 02:44:24,889
weapons so you can actually imagine them
being out in a lot of different places

8708
02:44:24,889 --> 02:44:24,899
being out in a lot of different places
 

8709
02:44:24,899 --> 02:44:26,389
being out in a lot of different places
where we'd perhaps be a little worried

8710
02:44:26,389 --> 02:44:26,399
where we'd perhaps be a little worried
 

8711
02:44:26,399 --> 02:44:28,429
where we'd perhaps be a little worried
about having you know plutonium lying

8712
02:44:28,429 --> 02:44:28,439
about having you know plutonium lying
 

8713
02:44:28,439 --> 02:44:30,349
about having you know plutonium lying
around now this is all still being

8714
02:44:30,349 --> 02:44:30,359
around now this is all still being
 

8715
02:44:30,359 --> 02:44:32,630
around now this is all still being
worked out but imagine if that actually

8716
02:44:32,630 --> 02:44:32,640
worked out but imagine if that actually
 

8717
02:44:32,640 --> 02:44:34,790
worked out but imagine if that actually
comes out and again remember the other

8718
02:44:34,790 --> 02:44:34,800
comes out and again remember the other
 

8719
02:44:34,800 --> 02:44:36,830
comes out and again remember the other
three generations they were we were also

8720
02:44:36,830 --> 02:44:36,840
three generations they were we were also
 

8721
02:44:36,840 --> 02:44:38,510
three generations they were we were also
told they'll be incredibly safe and

8722
02:44:38,510 --> 02:44:38,520
told they'll be incredibly safe and
 

8723
02:44:38,520 --> 02:44:40,370
told they'll be incredibly safe and
it'll be incredibly cheap and it didn't

8724
02:44:40,370 --> 02:44:40,380
it'll be incredibly cheap and it didn't
 

8725
02:44:40,380 --> 02:44:42,110
it'll be incredibly cheap and it didn't
turn out that way so let's let's wait

8726
02:44:42,110 --> 02:44:42,120
turn out that way so let's let's wait
 

8727
02:44:42,120 --> 02:44:43,969
turn out that way so let's let's wait
but it could be

8728
02:44:43,969 --> 02:44:43,979
but it could be
 

8729
02:44:43,979 --> 02:44:47,030
but it could be
and so the argument is invest in these

8730
02:44:47,030 --> 02:44:47,040
and so the argument is invest in these
 

8731
02:44:47,040 --> 02:44:49,130
and so the argument is invest in these
ideas for instance fourth generation

8732
02:44:49,130 --> 02:44:49,140
ideas for instance fourth generation
 

8733
02:44:49,140 --> 02:44:51,590
ideas for instance fourth generation
nuclear and if fourth generation nuclear

8734
02:44:51,590 --> 02:44:51,600
nuclear and if fourth generation nuclear
 

8735
02:44:51,600 --> 02:44:53,870
nuclear and if fourth generation nuclear
becomes cheaper than fossil fuels we're

8736
02:44:53,870 --> 02:44:53,880
becomes cheaper than fossil fuels we're
 

8737
02:44:53,880 --> 02:44:56,750
becomes cheaper than fossil fuels we're
done everyone will just switch not just

8738
02:44:56,750 --> 02:44:56,760
done everyone will just switch not just
 

8739
02:44:56,760 --> 02:44:58,969
done everyone will just switch not just
Rich well-meaning Americans or Europeans

8740
02:44:58,969 --> 02:44:58,979
Rich well-meaning Americans or Europeans
 

8741
02:44:58,979 --> 02:45:01,490
Rich well-meaning Americans or Europeans
but also the Chinese the Indians

8742
02:45:01,490 --> 02:45:01,500
but also the Chinese the Indians
 

8743
02:45:01,500 --> 02:45:03,650
but also the Chinese the Indians
everybody in Africa the rest is uh

8744
02:45:03,650 --> 02:45:03,660
everybody in Africa the rest is uh
 

8745
02:45:03,660 --> 02:45:06,469
everybody in Africa the rest is uh
Indian subcontinent that's how you fix

8746
02:45:06,469 --> 02:45:06,479
Indian subcontinent that's how you fix
 

8747
02:45:06,479 --> 02:45:08,690
Indian subcontinent that's how you fix
these issues right so the idea here is

8748
02:45:08,690 --> 02:45:08,700
these issues right so the idea here is
 

8749
02:45:08,700 --> 02:45:12,230
these issues right so the idea here is
to say instead of thinking that we can

8750
02:45:12,230 --> 02:45:12,240
to say instead of thinking that we can
 

8751
02:45:12,240 --> 02:45:14,809
to say instead of thinking that we can
sort of push people to do stuff they

8752
02:45:14,809 --> 02:45:14,819
sort of push people to do stuff they
 

8753
02:45:14,819 --> 02:45:16,429
sort of push people to do stuff they
really don't want to do

8754
02:45:16,429 --> 02:45:16,439
really don't want to do
 

8755
02:45:16,439 --> 02:45:18,469
really don't want to do
which is basically saying let's let's

8756
02:45:18,469 --> 02:45:18,479
which is basically saying let's let's
 

8757
02:45:18,479 --> 02:45:21,290
which is basically saying let's let's
use more of the uh you know the solar

8758
02:45:21,290 --> 02:45:21,300
use more of the uh you know the solar
 

8759
02:45:21,300 --> 02:45:22,610
use more of the uh you know the solar
and wind that you would otherwise have

8760
02:45:22,610 --> 02:45:22,620
and wind that you would otherwise have
 

8761
02:45:22,620 --> 02:45:24,889
and wind that you would otherwise have
invested in force people to buy an

8762
02:45:24,889 --> 02:45:24,899
invested in force people to buy an
 

8763
02:45:24,899 --> 02:45:26,870
invested in force people to buy an
electric car by giving huge subsidies

8764
02:45:26,870 --> 02:45:26,880
electric car by giving huge subsidies
 

8765
02:45:26,880 --> 02:45:28,570
electric car by giving huge subsidies
because otherwise they're clearly not

8766
02:45:28,570 --> 02:45:28,580
because otherwise they're clearly not
 

8767
02:45:28,580 --> 02:45:30,950
because otherwise they're clearly not
all that interested in buying it and so

8768
02:45:30,950 --> 02:45:30,960
all that interested in buying it and so
 

8769
02:45:30,960 --> 02:45:33,889
all that interested in buying it and so
on then get the Innovation such that

8770
02:45:33,889 --> 02:45:33,899
on then get the Innovation such that
 

8771
02:45:33,899 --> 02:45:36,349
on then get the Innovation such that
they become cheaper than fossil fuels

8772
02:45:36,349 --> 02:45:36,359
they become cheaper than fossil fuels
 

8773
02:45:36,359 --> 02:45:38,750
they become cheaper than fossil fuels
and everyone will switch this is how we

8774
02:45:38,750 --> 02:45:38,760
and everyone will switch this is how we
 

8775
02:45:38,760 --> 02:45:40,309
and everyone will switch this is how we
solved problems in the past if you think

8776
02:45:40,309 --> 02:45:40,319
solved problems in the past if you think
 

8777
02:45:40,319 --> 02:45:43,309
solved problems in the past if you think
in in Los Angeles in the 1950s was

8778
02:45:43,309 --> 02:45:43,319
in in Los Angeles in the 1950s was
 

8779
02:45:43,319 --> 02:45:45,650
in in Los Angeles in the 1950s was
hugely polluted place mostly because of

8780
02:45:45,650 --> 02:45:45,660
hugely polluted place mostly because of
 

8781
02:45:45,660 --> 02:45:48,110
hugely polluted place mostly because of
cars this sort of standard climate

8782
02:45:48,110 --> 02:45:48,120
cars this sort of standard climate
 

8783
02:45:48,120 --> 02:45:50,270
cars this sort of standard climate
approach today would be to tell everyone

8784
02:45:50,270 --> 02:45:50,280
approach today would be to tell everyone
 

8785
02:45:50,280 --> 02:45:52,130
approach today would be to tell everyone
in Los Angeles I'm sorry could you just

8786
02:45:52,130 --> 02:45:52,140
in Los Angeles I'm sorry could you just
 

8787
02:45:52,140 --> 02:45:54,889
in Los Angeles I'm sorry could you just
walk instead and of course that just

8788
02:45:54,889 --> 02:45:54,899
walk instead and of course that just
 

8789
02:45:54,899 --> 02:45:56,690
walk instead and of course that just
doesn't work that doesn't pay off you

8790
02:45:56,690 --> 02:45:56,700
doesn't work that doesn't pay off you
 

8791
02:45:56,700 --> 02:45:59,450
doesn't work that doesn't pay off you
never get you know politicians voted in

8792
02:45:59,450 --> 02:45:59,460
never get you know politicians voted in
 

8793
02:45:59,460 --> 02:46:01,849
never get you know politicians voted in
office or at least staying in office if

8794
02:46:01,849 --> 02:46:01,859
office or at least staying in office if
 

8795
02:46:01,859 --> 02:46:03,590
office or at least staying in office if
you make that kind of policy what did

8796
02:46:03,590 --> 02:46:03,600
you make that kind of policy what did
 

8797
02:46:03,600 --> 02:46:06,110
you make that kind of policy what did
solve the problem was the innovation of

8798
02:46:06,110 --> 02:46:06,120
solve the problem was the innovation of
 

8799
02:46:06,120 --> 02:46:08,030
solve the problem was the innovation of
the catalytic converter you basically

8800
02:46:08,030 --> 02:46:08,040
the catalytic converter you basically
 

8801
02:46:08,040 --> 02:46:10,070
the catalytic converter you basically
get this little Gizmo and it cost a

8802
02:46:10,070 --> 02:46:10,080
get this little Gizmo and it cost a
 

8803
02:46:10,080 --> 02:46:11,450
get this little Gizmo and it cost a
couple hundred dollars and you put it on

8804
02:46:11,450 --> 02:46:11,460
couple hundred dollars and you put it on
 

8805
02:46:11,460 --> 02:46:13,370
couple hundred dollars and you put it on
your tailpipe and then you can drive

8806
02:46:13,370 --> 02:46:13,380
your tailpipe and then you can drive
 

8807
02:46:13,380 --> 02:46:16,190
your tailpipe and then you can drive
around basically almost not pollute and

8808
02:46:16,190 --> 02:46:16,200
around basically almost not pollute and
 

8809
02:46:16,200 --> 02:46:17,750
around basically almost not pollute and
that that's how you fix the air

8810
02:46:17,750 --> 02:46:17,760
that that's how you fix the air
 

8811
02:46:17,760 --> 02:46:20,510
that that's how you fix the air
pollution in Los Angeles basically we've

8812
02:46:20,510 --> 02:46:20,520
pollution in Los Angeles basically we've
 

8813
02:46:20,520 --> 02:46:23,349
pollution in Los Angeles basically we've
solved all problems in humanity all big

8814
02:46:23,349 --> 02:46:23,359
solved all problems in humanity all big
 

8815
02:46:23,359 --> 02:46:26,150
solved all problems in humanity all big
difficult problems with Innovation we

8816
02:46:26,150 --> 02:46:26,160
difficult problems with Innovation we
 

8817
02:46:26,160 --> 02:46:27,469
difficult problems with Innovation we
haven't solved it by telling everyone

8818
02:46:27,469 --> 02:46:27,479
haven't solved it by telling everyone
 

8819
02:46:27,479 --> 02:46:29,630
haven't solved it by telling everyone
I'm sorry could you be a little less

8820
02:46:29,630 --> 02:46:29,640
I'm sorry could you be a little less
 

8821
02:46:29,640 --> 02:46:31,849
I'm sorry could you be a little less
comfortable and a little more cold and a

8822
02:46:31,849 --> 02:46:31,859
comfortable and a little more cold and a
 

8823
02:46:31,859 --> 02:46:34,309
comfortable and a little more cold and a
little poorer and believing that that

8824
02:46:34,309 --> 02:46:34,319
little poorer and believing that that
 

8825
02:46:34,319 --> 02:46:37,190
little poorer and believing that that
can go on for you know decades and and

8826
02:46:37,190 --> 02:46:37,200
can go on for you know decades and and
 

8827
02:46:37,200 --> 02:46:40,250
can go on for you know decades and and
while it possibly Works in some pockets

8828
02:46:40,250 --> 02:46:40,260
while it possibly Works in some pockets
 

8829
02:46:40,260 --> 02:46:42,950
while it possibly Works in some pockets
of the US and I I think actually in

8830
02:46:42,950 --> 02:46:42,960
of the US and I I think actually in
 

8831
02:46:42,960 --> 02:46:45,110
of the US and I I think actually in
large parts of Europe at least it used

8832
02:46:45,110 --> 02:46:45,120
large parts of Europe at least it used
 

8833
02:46:45,120 --> 02:46:48,050
large parts of Europe at least it used
to uh the this uh the the war in Ukraine

8834
02:46:48,050 --> 02:46:48,060
to uh the this uh the the war in Ukraine
 

8835
02:46:48,060 --> 02:46:49,610
to uh the this uh the the war in Ukraine
is definitely sort of changing that

8836
02:46:49,610 --> 02:46:49,620
is definitely sort of changing that
 

8837
02:46:49,620 --> 02:46:51,410
is definitely sort of changing that
whole perspective but yeah there's a

8838
02:46:51,410 --> 02:46:51,420
whole perspective but yeah there's a
 

8839
02:46:51,420 --> 02:46:53,030
whole perspective but yeah there's a
willingness to say we're gonna you know

8840
02:46:53,030 --> 02:46:53,040
willingness to say we're gonna you know
 

8841
02:46:53,040 --> 02:46:54,650
willingness to say we're gonna you know
suffer a little bit then we'll fix this

8842
02:46:54,650 --> 02:46:54,660
suffer a little bit then we'll fix this
 

8843
02:46:54,660 --> 02:46:56,809
suffer a little bit then we'll fix this
problem but the point is we're going to

8844
02:46:56,809 --> 02:46:56,819
problem but the point is we're going to
 

8845
02:46:56,819 --> 02:46:59,330
problem but the point is we're going to
be willing to suffer a little and so fix

8846
02:46:59,330 --> 02:46:59,340
be willing to suffer a little and so fix
 

8847
02:46:59,340 --> 02:47:01,849
be willing to suffer a little and so fix
a tiny bit of the climate problem

8848
02:47:01,849 --> 02:47:01,859
a tiny bit of the climate problem
 

8849
02:47:01,859 --> 02:47:04,070
a tiny bit of the climate problem
instead of actually focusing on

8850
02:47:04,070 --> 02:47:04,080
instead of actually focusing on
 

8851
02:47:04,080 --> 02:47:06,349
instead of actually focusing on
Innovation so what we found was if you

8852
02:47:06,349 --> 02:47:06,359
Innovation so what we found was if you
 

8853
02:47:06,359 --> 02:47:08,510
Innovation so what we found was if you
spend a dollar on Innovation you will

8854
02:47:08,510 --> 02:47:08,520
spend a dollar on Innovation you will
 

8855
02:47:08,520 --> 02:47:11,150
spend a dollar on Innovation you will
probably avoid about 11 of climate

8856
02:47:11,150 --> 02:47:11,160
probably avoid about 11 of climate
 

8857
02:47:11,160 --> 02:47:13,370
probably avoid about 11 of climate
damage in the long run which is a great

8858
02:47:13,370 --> 02:47:13,380
damage in the long run which is a great
 

8859
02:47:13,380 --> 02:47:16,370
damage in the long run which is a great
investment and the terrible thing is

8860
02:47:16,370 --> 02:47:16,380
investment and the terrible thing is
 

8861
02:47:16,380 --> 02:47:18,770
investment and the terrible thing is
we have not been doing this so because

8862
02:47:18,770 --> 02:47:18,780
we have not been doing this so because
 

8863
02:47:18,780 --> 02:47:20,990
we have not been doing this so because
everybody is focused on saying we need

8864
02:47:20,990 --> 02:47:21,000
everybody is focused on saying we need
 

8865
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:23,809
everybody is focused on saying we need
the solution within the next 12 years it

8866
02:47:23,809 --> 02:47:23,819
the solution within the next 12 years it
 

8867
02:47:23,819 --> 02:47:25,550
the solution within the next 12 years it
means you're not thinking about the

8868
02:47:25,550 --> 02:47:25,560
means you're not thinking about the
 

8869
02:47:25,560 --> 02:47:27,050
means you're not thinking about the
Innovation we're actually spending less

8870
02:47:27,050 --> 02:47:27,060
Innovation we're actually spending less
 

8871
02:47:27,060 --> 02:47:29,990
Innovation we're actually spending less
money not more money on uh on Innovation

8872
02:47:29,990 --> 02:47:30,000
money not more money on uh on Innovation
 

8873
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:31,910
money not more money on uh on Innovation
globally so everyone is really missing

02:47:31,910 --> 02:47:31,920
globally so everyone is really missing
 

8875

innovating on Alternate energy you're

8878
02:47:36,889 --> 02:47:36,899
innovating on Alternate energy you're
 

8879
02:47:36,899 --> 02:47:38,570
innovating on Alternate energy you're
basically focusing on putting the

8880
02:47:38,570 --> 02:47:38,580
basically focusing on putting the
 

8881
02:47:38,580 --> 02:47:40,429
basically focusing on putting the
existing solar panels or wind turbines

8882
02:47:40,429 --> 02:47:40,439
existing solar panels or wind turbines
 

8883
02:47:40,439 --> 02:47:42,290
existing solar panels or wind turbines
which are either you know just about

8884
02:47:42,290 --> 02:47:42,300
which are either you know just about
 

8885
02:47:42,300 --> 02:47:44,870
which are either you know just about

making the Next Generation or it's more
 

8889
02:47:47,819 --> 02:47:50,510
making the Next Generation or it's more

genome back in 2000 he has this idea of

growing algae out on the ocean surface

8904

growing algae out on the ocean surface
 

8905
02:48:05,640 --> 02:48:07,370
growing algae out on the ocean surface
these algae they'd be genetically

8906
02:48:07,370 --> 02:48:07,380
these algae they'd be genetically
 

8907
02:48:07,380 --> 02:48:09,530
these algae they'd be genetically
modified and they would basically soak

8908
02:48:09,530 --> 02:48:09,540
modified and they would basically soak
 

8909
02:48:09,540 --> 02:48:13,070
modified and they would basically soak
up sunlight and CO2 and produce oil then

8910
02:48:13,070 --> 02:48:13,080
up sunlight and CO2 and produce oil then
 

8911
02:48:13,080 --> 02:48:14,690
up sunlight and CO2 and produce oil then
we could basically just grow our own

we could basically just grow our own
 

8913
02:48:14,700 --> 02:48:16,670
we could basically just grow our own

using coal but then you don't really
 

9361
02:56:13,260 --> 02:56:15,830

02:56:23,399 --> 02:56:25,969
totally uh and and and the point is just
you know the power of an innovation is

9372
02:56:25,969 --> 02:56:25,979
you know the power of an innovation is
 

9373
02:56:25,979 --> 02:56:28,429
you know the power of an innovation is
that you you almost don't see it anymore

9374
02:56:28,429 --> 02:56:28,439
that you you almost don't see it anymore
 

9375
02:56:28,439 --> 02:56:31,130
that you you almost don't see it anymore
it just happens uh and and I think

9376
02:56:31,130 --> 02:56:31,140
it just happens uh and and I think
 

9377
02:56:31,140 --> 02:56:33,110
it just happens uh and and I think
that's really the only way we're gonna

9378
02:56:33,110 --> 02:56:33,120
that's really the only way we're gonna
 

9379
02:56:33,120 --> 02:56:35,269
that's really the only way we're gonna
fix you know these big problems if you

9380
02:56:35,269 --> 02:56:35,279
fix you know these big problems if you
 

9381
02:56:35,279 --> 02:56:37,550
fix you know these big problems if you
think about you know of the uh nutrition

9382
02:56:37,550 --> 02:56:37,560
think about you know of the uh nutrition
 

9383
02:56:37,560 --> 02:56:40,490
think about you know of the uh nutrition
problem back in the 60s 70s uh we

9384
02:56:40,490 --> 02:56:40,500
problem back in the 60s 70s uh we
 

9385
02:56:40,500 --> 02:56:41,809
problem back in the 60s 70s uh we
worried a lot about India and other

9386
02:56:41,809 --> 02:56:41,819
worried a lot about India and other
 

9387
02:56:41,819 --> 02:56:44,809
worried a lot about India and other
places uh solution is not worrying or

9388
02:56:44,809 --> 02:56:44,819
places uh solution is not worrying or
 

9389
02:56:44,819 --> 02:56:46,550
places uh solution is not worrying or
the solution was not you know us eating

9390
02:56:46,550 --> 02:56:46,560
the solution was not you know us eating
 

9391
02:56:46,560 --> 02:56:48,469
the solution was not you know us eating
a little bit less and sending it down to

9392
02:56:48,469 --> 02:56:48,479
a little bit less and sending it down to
 

9393
02:56:48,479 --> 02:56:50,330
a little bit less and sending it down to
India wherever the solution was the

9394
02:56:50,330 --> 02:56:50,340
India wherever the solution was the
 

9395
02:56:50,340 --> 02:56:51,889
India wherever the solution was the
Green Revolution right it was the fact

9396
02:56:51,889 --> 02:56:51,899
Green Revolution right it was the fact
 

9397
02:56:51,899 --> 02:56:54,290
Green Revolution right it was the fact
that some scientists made ways to make

9398
02:56:54,290 --> 02:56:54,300
that some scientists made ways to make
 

9399
02:56:54,300 --> 02:56:56,389
that some scientists made ways to make
every seed produce three times as much

9400
02:56:56,389 --> 02:56:56,399
every seed produce three times as much
 

9401
02:56:56,399 --> 02:56:57,889
every seed produce three times as much
so you could grow three times as much

9402
02:56:57,889 --> 02:56:57,899
so you could grow three times as much
 

9403
02:56:57,899 --> 02:57:00,290
so you could grow three times as much
food on an acre and you know that's what

9404
02:57:00,290 --> 02:57:00,300
food on an acre and you know that's what
 

9405
02:57:00,300 --> 02:57:02,510
food on an acre and you know that's what
basically made it possible for India to

9406
02:57:02,510 --> 02:57:02,520
basically made it possible for India to
 

9407
02:57:02,520 --> 02:57:04,969
basically made it possible for India to
go from a basket case to what the

9408
02:57:04,969 --> 02:57:04,979
go from a basket case to what the
 

9409
02:57:04,979 --> 02:57:07,370
go from a basket case to what the
world's leading uh rice exporter uh and

9410
02:57:07,370 --> 02:57:07,380
world's leading uh rice exporter uh and
 

9411
02:57:07,380 --> 02:57:09,950
world's leading uh rice exporter uh and
and and that's how you do these things

9412
02:57:09,950 --> 02:57:09,960
and and that's how you do these things
 

9413
02:57:09,960 --> 02:57:11,990
and and that's how you do these things
you know you solve these big problems

9414
02:57:11,990 --> 02:57:12,000
you know you solve these big problems
 

9415
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:14,690
you know you solve these big problems
true Innovation and again I'm not saying

9416
02:57:14,690 --> 02:57:14,700
true Innovation and again I'm not saying
 

9417
02:57:14,700 --> 02:57:16,610
true Innovation and again I'm not saying
that you know we're actually arcing our

9418
02:57:16,610 --> 02:57:16,620
that you know we're actually arcing our
 

9419
02:57:16,620 --> 02:57:18,830
that you know we're actually arcing our
carbon tax is a smart thing to do you

9420
02:57:18,830 --> 02:57:18,840
carbon tax is a smart thing to do you
 

9421
02:57:18,840 --> 02:57:20,630
carbon tax is a smart thing to do you
know that's what any Economist would

9422
02:57:20,630 --> 02:57:20,640
know that's what any Economist would
 

9423
02:57:20,640 --> 02:57:22,730
know that's what any Economist would
tell you to do but it also turns out

9424
02:57:22,730 --> 02:57:22,740
tell you to do but it also turns out
 

9425
02:57:22,740 --> 02:57:25,250
tell you to do but it also turns out
that it's partly is not going to solve

9426
02:57:25,250 --> 02:57:25,260
that it's partly is not going to solve
 

9427
02:57:25,260 --> 02:57:28,130
that it's partly is not going to solve
most of the problem and it's incredibly

9428
02:57:28,130 --> 02:57:28,140
most of the problem and it's incredibly
 

9429
02:57:28,140 --> 02:57:30,469
most of the problem and it's incredibly
politically hard to do so it may also

9430
02:57:30,469 --> 02:57:30,479
politically hard to do so it may also
 

9431
02:57:30,479 --> 02:57:32,750
politically hard to do so it may also
just be the wrong sort of tree to bark

9432
02:57:32,750 --> 02:57:32,760
just be the wrong sort of tree to bark
 

9433
02:57:32,760 --> 02:57:34,730
just be the wrong sort of tree to bark
up against you know if you can do it

9434
02:57:34,730 --> 02:57:34,740
up against you know if you can do it
 

9435
02:57:34,740 --> 02:57:37,730
up against you know if you can do it
please do uh but this is not the main

9436
02:57:37,730 --> 02:57:37,740
please do uh but this is not the main
 

9437
02:57:37,740 --> 02:57:39,290
please do uh but this is not the main
thing that's going to solve climate the

9438
02:57:39,290 --> 02:57:39,300
thing that's going to solve climate the
 

9439
02:57:39,300 --> 02:57:41,090
thing that's going to solve climate the
the main thing is that we get these

9440
02:57:41,090 --> 02:57:41,100
the main thing is that we get these
 

9441
02:57:41,100 --> 02:57:43,250
the main thing is that we get these
innovations that basically make green

9442
02:57:43,250 --> 02:57:43,260
innovations that basically make green
 

9443
02:57:43,260 --> 02:57:46,010
innovations that basically make green
energy so cheap everyone will just want

9444
02:57:46,010 --> 02:57:46,020
energy so cheap everyone will just want
 

9445
02:57:46,020 --> 02:57:47,870
energy so cheap everyone will just want
we mentioned nuclear quite a few times

9446
02:57:47,870 --> 02:57:47,880
we mentioned nuclear quite a few times
 

9447
02:57:47,880 --> 02:57:50,090
we mentioned nuclear quite a few times
yeah that you know there was a for a

9448
02:57:50,090 --> 02:57:50,100
yeah that you know there was a for a
 

9449
02:57:50,100 --> 02:57:52,130
yeah that you know there was a for a
long time it seems to have shifted

9450
02:57:52,130 --> 02:57:52,140
long time it seems to have shifted
 

9451
02:57:52,140 --> 02:57:54,050
long time it seems to have shifted
recently maybe you can clarify and

9452
02:57:54,050 --> 02:57:54,060
recently maybe you can clarify and
 

9453
02:57:54,060 --> 02:57:56,330
recently maybe you can clarify and
educate me on this but there for the

9454
02:57:56,330 --> 02:57:56,340
educate me on this but there for the
 

9455
02:57:56,340 --> 02:57:58,190
educate me on this but there for the
longest time people thought that nuclear

9456
02:57:58,190 --> 02:57:58,200
longest time people thought that nuclear
 

9457
02:57:58,200 --> 02:57:59,570
longest time people thought that nuclear
is um

9458
02:57:59,570 --> 02:57:59,580
is um
 

9459
02:57:59,580 --> 02:58:03,950
is um
is almost unclean energy or dangerous

9460
02:58:03,950 --> 02:58:03,960
is almost unclean energy or dangerous
 

9461
02:58:03,960 --> 02:58:05,870
is almost unclean energy or dangerous
energy or all that kind of stuff when

9462
02:58:05,870 --> 02:58:05,880
energy or all that kind of stuff when
 

9463
02:58:05,880 --> 02:58:08,389
energy or all that kind of stuff when
did that shift what was the source of

9464
02:58:08,389 --> 02:58:08,399
did that shift what was the source of
 

9465
02:58:08,399 --> 02:58:12,349
did that shift what was the source of
that alarmism uh and what maybe is that

9466
02:58:12,349 --> 02:58:12,359
that alarmism uh and what maybe is that
 

9467
02:58:12,359 --> 02:58:15,650
that alarmism uh and what maybe is that
a case study of how alarmism can turn

9468
02:58:15,650 --> 02:58:15,660
a case study of how alarmism can turn
 

9469
02:58:15,660 --> 02:58:16,790
a case study of how alarmism can turn

um is it not is it not like uh nuclear

02:58:29,809 --> 02:58:29,819
productive in terms of yay we banned it
 

9483
02:58:29,819 --> 02:58:31,490

what you mean yes I meant productive for
 

9487
02:58:33,300 --> 02:58:35,630

reluctant to put forward the nuclear
 

9511
02:59:05,340 --> 02:59:07,490
reluctant to put forward the nuclear
option because they know a lot of their

point of you know saying that people are
 

9685
03:02:19,979 --> 03:02:21,530
point of you know saying that people are
saying it's the end of the world but no

9686
03:02:21,530 --> 03:02:21,540
saying it's the end of the world but no
 

9687
03:02:21,540 --> 03:02:24,170
saying it's the end of the world but no
I don't want a new clip it just doesn't

9688
03:02:24,170 --> 03:02:24,180
I don't want a new clip it just doesn't
 

9689
03:02:24,180 --> 03:02:25,670
I don't want a new clip it just doesn't
make sense right

9690
03:02:25,670 --> 03:02:25,680
make sense right
 

9691
03:02:25,680 --> 03:02:28,190
make sense right
um and Andy's absolutely right to talk

9692
03:02:28,190 --> 03:02:28,200
um and Andy's absolutely right to talk
 

9693
03:02:28,200 --> 03:02:30,469
um and Andy's absolutely right to talk
about so existing nuclear power plants

9694
03:02:30,469 --> 03:02:30,479
about so existing nuclear power plants
 

9695
03:02:30,479 --> 03:02:33,590
about so existing nuclear power plants
we already paid for them we already have

9696
03:02:33,590 --> 03:02:33,600
we already paid for them we already have
 

9697
03:02:33,600 --> 03:02:35,809
we already paid for them we already have
them we already committed to

9698
03:02:35,809 --> 03:02:35,819
them we already committed to
 

9699
03:02:35,819 --> 03:02:38,269
them we already committed to
decommissioning them eventually while

9700
03:02:38,269 --> 03:02:38,279
decommissioning them eventually while
 

9701
03:02:38,279 --> 03:02:40,490
decommissioning them eventually while
they're running they're pretty much the

9702
03:02:40,490 --> 03:02:40,500
they're running they're pretty much the
 

9703
03:02:40,500 --> 03:02:42,349
they're running they're pretty much the
cheapest power you can possibly have on

9704
03:02:42,349 --> 03:02:42,359
cheapest power you can possibly have on
 

9705
03:02:42,359 --> 03:02:44,150
cheapest power you can possibly have on
the planet because it costs almost

9706
03:02:44,150 --> 03:02:44,160
the planet because it costs almost
 

9707
03:02:44,160 --> 03:02:47,269
the planet because it costs almost
nothing to run them day to day so you

9708
03:02:47,269 --> 03:02:47,279
nothing to run them day to day so you
 

9709
03:02:47,279 --> 03:02:49,910
nothing to run them day to day so you
know it's basically cheap or almost free

9710
03:02:49,910 --> 03:02:49,920
know it's basically cheap or almost free
 

9711
03:02:49,920 --> 03:02:52,849
know it's basically cheap or almost free
CO2 base load power there's just nothing

9712
03:02:52,849 --> 03:02:52,859
CO2 base load power there's just nothing
 

9713
03:02:52,859 --> 03:02:55,910
CO2 base load power there's just nothing
there that is that doesn't you know you

9714
03:02:55,910 --> 03:02:55,920
there that is that doesn't you know you
 

9715
03:02:55,920 --> 03:02:59,090
there that is that doesn't you know you
should embrace now new nuclear power

9716
03:02:59,090 --> 03:02:59,100
should embrace now new nuclear power
 

9717
03:02:59,100 --> 03:03:01,790
should embrace now new nuclear power
plants turn out to be very expensive

9718
03:03:01,790 --> 03:03:01,800
plants turn out to be very expensive
 

9719
03:03:01,800 --> 03:03:03,889
plants turn out to be very expensive
currently so you know the one they built

9720
03:03:03,889 --> 03:03:03,899
currently so you know the one they built
 

9721
03:03:03,899 --> 03:03:06,769
currently so you know the one they built
in Finland and some and and and and the

9722
03:03:06,769 --> 03:03:06,779
in Finland and some and and and and the
 

9723
03:03:06,779 --> 03:03:08,570
in Finland and some and and and and the
UK and France and several other places

9724
03:03:08,570 --> 03:03:08,580
UK and France and several other places
 

9725
03:03:08,580 --> 03:03:11,210
UK and France and several other places
turn out to be incredibly expensive so

9726
03:03:11,210 --> 03:03:11,220
turn out to be incredibly expensive so
 

9727
03:03:11,220 --> 03:03:13,130
turn out to be incredibly expensive so
they're much more expensive than you

9728
03:03:13,130 --> 03:03:13,140
they're much more expensive than you
 

9729
03:03:13,140 --> 03:03:15,769
they're much more expensive than you
know the the the costliest uh Renewables

9730
03:03:15,769 --> 03:03:15,779
know the the the costliest uh Renewables
 

9731
03:03:15,779 --> 03:03:17,809
know the the the costliest uh Renewables
you can imagine so they're actually not

9732
03:03:17,809 --> 03:03:17,819
you can imagine so they're actually not
 

9733
03:03:17,819 --> 03:03:19,550
you can imagine so they're actually not
a solution right now

9734
03:03:19,550 --> 03:03:19,560
a solution right now
 

9735
03:03:19,560 --> 03:03:21,710
a solution right now
and that's why we need the Innovation

9736
03:03:21,710 --> 03:03:21,720
and that's why we need the Innovation
 

9737
03:03:21,720 --> 03:03:23,389
and that's why we need the Innovation
that's why we need the potentially

9738
03:03:23,389 --> 03:03:23,399
that's why we need the potentially
 

9739
03:03:23,399 --> 03:03:25,610
that's why we need the potentially
fourth generation new clip how it's just

9740
03:03:25,610 --> 03:03:25,620
fourth generation new clip how it's just
 

9741
03:03:25,620 --> 03:03:28,070
fourth generation new clip how it's just
simply it's a bad deal and that's why

9742
03:03:28,070 --> 03:03:28,080
simply it's a bad deal and that's why
 

9743
03:03:28,080 --> 03:03:30,290
simply it's a bad deal and that's why
you know nuclear is never going to win

9744
03:03:30,290 --> 03:03:30,300
you know nuclear is never going to win
 

9745
03:03:30,300 --> 03:03:33,290
you know nuclear is never going to win
on its third generation now it may never

9746
03:03:33,290 --> 03:03:33,300
on its third generation now it may never
 

9747
03:03:33,300 --> 03:03:35,929
on its third generation now it may never
get there you know who knows but it's

9748
03:03:35,929 --> 03:03:35,939
get there you know who knows but it's
 

9749
03:03:35,939 --> 03:03:39,230
get there you know who knows but it's
certainly a a a a a a possibility and we

9750
03:03:39,230 --> 03:03:39,240
certainly a a a a a a possibility and we
 

9751
03:03:39,240 --> 03:03:40,670
certainly a a a a a a possibility and we
should be looking into it and there are

9752
03:03:40,670 --> 03:03:40,680
should be looking into it and there are
 

9753
03:03:40,680 --> 03:03:44,269
should be looking into it and there are
there are you know wonky realities that

9754
03:03:44,269 --> 03:03:44,279
there are you know wonky realities that
 

9755
03:03:44,279 --> 03:03:46,130
there are you know wonky realities that
need to be dealt with the nuclear

9756
03:03:46,130 --> 03:03:46,140
need to be dealt with the nuclear
 

9757
03:03:46,140 --> 03:03:47,150
need to be dealt with the nuclear

model of big giant power plants there's

9764
03:03:55,550 --> 03:03:55,560
model of big giant power plants there's
 

9765
03:03:55,560 --> 03:03:58,750
model of big giant power plants there's
an intense discussion right now about

9766
03:03:58,750 --> 03:03:58,760
an intense discussion right now about
 

9767
03:03:58,760 --> 03:04:01,969
an intense discussion right now about
evolving a new regulatory scheme for

9768
03:04:01,969 --> 03:04:01,979
evolving a new regulatory scheme for
 

9769
03:04:01,979 --> 03:04:03,889
evolving a new regulatory scheme for
small modular ones because of all these

9770
03:04:03,889 --> 03:04:03,899
small modular ones because of all these
 

9771
03:04:03,899 --> 03:04:06,769
small modular ones because of all these
implicit advantages they offer and that

9772
03:04:06,769 --> 03:04:06,779
implicit advantages they offer and that
 

9773
03:04:06,779 --> 03:04:09,530
implicit advantages they offer and that
so it along with the Innovation you need

9774
03:04:09,530 --> 03:04:09,540
so it along with the Innovation you need
 

9775
03:04:09,540 --> 03:04:11,030
so it along with the Innovation you need
to have this

9776
03:04:11,030 --> 03:04:11,040
to have this
 

9777
03:04:11,040 --> 03:04:12,830
to have this
right get out of the way or you're never

9778
03:04:12,830 --> 03:04:12,840
right get out of the way or you're never
 

9779
03:04:12,840 --> 03:04:14,870
right get out of the way or you're never
going to have the investment so it

9780
03:04:14,870 --> 03:04:14,880
going to have the investment so it
 

9781
03:04:14,880 --> 03:04:16,730
going to have the investment so it
really isn't all the above thing and

9782
03:04:16,730 --> 03:04:16,740
really isn't all the above thing and
 

9783
03:04:16,740 --> 03:04:19,010
really isn't all the above thing and
looking at these systems uh problems

9784
03:04:19,010 --> 03:04:19,020
looking at these systems uh problems
 

9785
03:04:19,020 --> 03:04:21,950
looking at these systems uh problems
systems Solutions is really important

9786
03:04:21,950 --> 03:04:21,960
systems Solutions is really important
 

9787
03:04:21,960 --> 03:04:25,849

uh let me ask you about Alex Epstein

9788
03:04:25,849 --> 03:04:25,859
uh let me ask you about Alex Epstein
 

9789
03:04:25,859 --> 03:04:28,550
uh let me ask you about Alex Epstein
so he wrote I'm not sure if you're

9790
03:04:28,550 --> 03:04:28,560
so he wrote I'm not sure if you're
 

9791
03:04:28,560 --> 03:04:30,590
so he wrote I'm not sure if you're
familiar who he is but he wrote a couple

9792
03:04:30,590 --> 03:04:30,600
familiar who he is but he wrote a couple
 

9793
03:04:30,600 --> 03:04:32,929
familiar who he is but he wrote a couple
of books it's just interesting to ask a

9794
03:04:32,929 --> 03:04:32,939
of books it's just interesting to ask a
 

9795
03:04:32,939 --> 03:04:34,370
of books it's just interesting to ask a
question about fossil fuels because

9796
03:04:34,370 --> 03:04:34,380
question about fossil fuels because
 

9797
03:04:34,380 --> 03:04:36,469
question about fossil fuels because
we're talking about reality and he's

9798
03:04:36,469 --> 03:04:36,479
we're talking about reality and he's
 

9799
03:04:36,479 --> 03:04:37,969
we're talking about reality and he's
somebody that doesn't just talk about

9800
03:04:37,969 --> 03:04:37,979
somebody that doesn't just talk about
 

9801
03:04:37,979 --> 03:04:40,670
somebody that doesn't just talk about
the reality of fossil fuels but he wrote

9802
03:04:40,670 --> 03:04:40,680
the reality of fossil fuels but he wrote
 

9803
03:04:40,680 --> 03:04:43,309
the reality of fossil fuels but he wrote
a book uh moral case of fossil fuels and

9804
03:04:43,309 --> 03:04:43,319
a book uh moral case of fossil fuels and
 

9805
03:04:43,319 --> 03:04:47,389
a book uh moral case of fossil fuels and
uh fossil future where he makes the case

9806
03:04:47,389 --> 03:04:47,399
uh fossil future where he makes the case
 

9807
03:04:47,399 --> 03:04:50,510
uh fossil future where he makes the case
that as a subtitle says Global human

9808
03:04:50,510 --> 03:04:50,520
that as a subtitle says Global human
 

9809
03:04:50,520 --> 03:04:53,330
that as a subtitle says Global human
flourishing requires oil coal and

9810
03:04:53,330 --> 03:04:53,340
flourishing requires oil coal and
 

9811
03:04:53,340 --> 03:04:57,650
flourishing requires oil coal and
natural gas or more oil coil and natural

9812
03:04:57,650 --> 03:04:57,660
natural gas or more oil coil and natural
 

9813
03:04:57,660 --> 03:04:59,929
natural gas or more oil coil and natural
gas not less

9814
03:04:59,929 --> 03:04:59,939
gas not less
 

9815
03:04:59,939 --> 03:05:01,610
gas not less
uh what do you think about the argument

9816
03:05:01,610 --> 03:05:01,620
uh what do you think about the argument
 

9817
03:05:01,620 --> 03:05:05,269
uh what do you think about the argument
he makes so he he pushes we've had this

9818
03:05:05,269 --> 03:05:05,279
he makes so he he pushes we've had this
 

9819
03:05:05,279 --> 03:05:07,849
he makes so he he pushes we've had this
kind of speaking of the center of this

9820
03:05:07,849 --> 03:05:07,859
kind of speaking of the center of this
 

9821
03:05:07,859 --> 03:05:09,469
kind of speaking of the center of this
balanced discussion of the reality of

9822
03:05:09,469 --> 03:05:09,479
balanced discussion of the reality of
 

9823
03:05:09,479 --> 03:05:11,570
balanced discussion of the reality of
fossil fuels but also investing a lot

9824
03:05:11,570 --> 03:05:11,580
fossil fuels but also investing a lot
 

9825
03:05:11,580 --> 03:05:14,630
fossil fuels but also investing a lot
into renewable energy and that having

9826
03:05:14,630 --> 03:05:14,640
into renewable energy and that having
 

9827
03:05:14,640 --> 03:05:16,849
into renewable energy and that having
the one dollar to eleven dollar return

9828
03:05:16,849 --> 03:05:16,859
the one dollar to eleven dollar return
 

9829
03:05:16,859 --> 03:05:19,010
the one dollar to eleven dollar return
so he says like

9830
03:05:19,010 --> 03:05:19,020
so he says like
 

9831
03:05:19,020 --> 03:05:22,190
so he says like
well I'm not sure exactly how to frame

9832
03:05:22,190 --> 03:05:22,200
well I'm not sure exactly how to frame
 

9833
03:05:22,200 --> 03:05:25,910
well I'm not sure exactly how to frame
it but like investing and maintaining

9834
03:05:25,910 --> 03:05:25,920
it but like investing and maintaining
 

9835
03:05:25,920 --> 03:05:28,670
it but like investing and maintaining
investment to fossil fuels also as a

9836
03:05:28,670 --> 03:05:28,680
investment to fossil fuels also as a
 

9837
03:05:28,680 --> 03:05:30,950
investment to fossil fuels also as a
positive return because of how efficient

9838
03:05:30,950 --> 03:05:30,960
positive return because of how efficient
 

9839

for the need
 

9919
03:06:56,340 --> 03:06:59,150
for the need
to stop global warming you know I think

9920
03:06:59,150 --> 03:06:59,160
to stop global warming you know I think
 

9921
03:06:59,160 --> 03:07:01,910
to stop global warming you know I think
that we have to slow slowing global

9922
03:07:01,910 --> 03:07:01,920
that we have to slow slowing global
 

9923
03:07:01,920 --> 03:07:04,190
that we have to slow slowing global
warming is a fundamental need in this

03:07:07,910 --> 03:07:07,920
and that's just not factored into his
 

9929
03:07:07,920 --> 03:07:11,269
and that's just not factored into his
math well I think that's where and I've

9930
03:07:11,269 --> 03:07:11,279
math well I think that's where and I've
 

9931
03:07:11,279 --> 03:07:12,950
math well I think that's where and I've
had a few sort of offline conversations

03:07:12,950 --> 03:07:12,960
had a few sort of offline conversations
 

9933
03:07:12,960 --> 03:07:14,990
had a few sort of offline conversations
with them and I think he he said because

9934
03:07:14,990 --> 03:07:15,000
with them and I think he he said because
 

9935
03:07:15,000 --> 03:07:16,370
with them and I think he he said because
I mentioned I'm talking to the two you

I mentioned I'm talking to the two you
 

9937
03:07:16,380 --> 03:07:19,190
I mentioned I'm talking to the two you
said that he that's probably why he

9938
03:07:19,190 --> 03:07:19,200
said that he that's probably why he
 

9939
03:07:19,200 --> 03:07:21,830

03:08:28,309 --> 03:08:28,319
smart I'll probably say that I I think
 

9999
03:08:28,319 --> 03:08:30,110
smart I'll probably say that I I think
it's more sort of a at least the thing

10000
03:08:30,110 --> 03:08:30,120
it's more sort of a at least the thing
 

10001
03:08:30,120 --> 03:08:32,510
it's more sort of a at least the thing
that I take away from Alex is

10002
03:08:32,510 --> 03:08:32,520
that I take away from Alex is
 

10003
03:08:32,520 --> 03:08:35,809
that I take away from Alex is
um is the fact as as you point out that

10004
03:08:35,809 --> 03:08:35,819
um is the fact as as you point out that
 

10005
03:08:35,819 --> 03:08:38,030
um is the fact as as you point out that
we need to recognize that fossil fuels

10006
03:08:38,030 --> 03:08:38,040
we need to recognize that fossil fuels
 

10007
03:08:38,040 --> 03:08:40,309
we need to recognize that fossil fuels
is basically the backbone of our society

10008
03:08:40,309 --> 03:08:40,319
is basically the backbone of our society
 

10009
03:08:40,319 --> 03:08:43,429
is basically the backbone of our society
today we get 80 of our energy from

10010
03:08:43,429 --> 03:08:43,439
today we get 80 of our energy from
 

10011
03:08:43,439 --> 03:08:45,710
today we get 80 of our energy from
fossil fuels to still as we did 50 years

10012
03:08:45,710 --> 03:08:45,720
fossil fuels to still as we did 50 years
 

10013
03:08:45,720 --> 03:08:47,330
fossil fuels to still as we did 50 years
yeah four years ago yeah yeah and and

10014
03:08:47,330 --> 03:08:47,340
yeah four years ago yeah yeah and and
 

10015
03:08:47,340 --> 03:08:49,309
yeah four years ago yeah yeah and and
people have no sense of this right so

10016
03:08:49,309 --> 03:08:49,319
people have no sense of this right so
 

10017
03:08:49,319 --> 03:08:51,830
people have no sense of this right so
they have the idea because you see so

10018
03:08:51,830 --> 03:08:51,840
they have the idea because you see so
 

10019
03:08:51,840 --> 03:08:53,809
they have the idea because you see so
many wind turbines and solar panels and

10020
03:08:53,809 --> 03:08:53,819
many wind turbines and solar panels and
 

10021
03:08:53,819 --> 03:08:55,790
many wind turbines and solar panels and
everybody's talking about that this is

10022
03:08:55,790 --> 03:08:55,800
everybody's talking about that this is
 

10023
03:08:55,800 --> 03:08:57,950
everybody's talking about that this is
huge big things but the reality is

10024
03:08:57,950 --> 03:08:57,960
huge big things but the reality is
 

10025
03:08:57,960 --> 03:09:00,290
huge big things but the reality is
remember only about a fifth of all

10026
03:09:00,290 --> 03:09:00,300
remember only about a fifth of all
 

10027
03:09:00,300 --> 03:09:02,870
remember only about a fifth of all
energy uses electricity the rest is you

10028
03:09:02,870 --> 03:09:02,880
energy uses electricity the rest is you
 

10029
03:09:02,880 --> 03:09:04,730
energy uses electricity the rest is you
know in processes and heating industrial

10030
03:09:04,730 --> 03:09:04,740
know in processes and heating industrial
 

10031
03:09:04,740 --> 03:09:08,210
know in processes and heating industrial
processes and so on so uh actually you

10032
03:09:08,210 --> 03:09:08,220
processes and so on so uh actually you
 

10033
03:09:08,220 --> 03:09:10,250
processes and so on so uh actually you
know solar and wind right now produces

10034
03:09:10,250 --> 03:09:10,260
know solar and wind right now produces
 

10035
03:09:10,260 --> 03:09:12,830
know solar and wind right now produces
one percent from of of energy from wind

10036
03:09:12,830 --> 03:09:12,840
one percent from of of energy from wind
 

10037
03:09:12,840 --> 03:09:16,429
one percent from of of energy from wind
and 0.8 percent from solar this is not a

10038
03:09:16,429 --> 03:09:16,439
and 0.8 percent from solar this is not a
 

10039
03:09:16,439 --> 03:09:18,769
and 0.8 percent from solar this is not a
huge thing it's a fairly tiny bit and

10040
03:09:18,769 --> 03:09:18,779
huge thing it's a fairly tiny bit and
 

10041
03:09:18,779 --> 03:09:21,530
huge thing it's a fairly tiny bit and
growing explosively yes it's absolutely

10042
03:09:21,530 --> 03:09:21,540
growing explosively yes it's absolutely
 

10043
03:09:21,540 --> 03:09:23,929
growing explosively yes it's absolutely
gross but actually it's growing slower

10044
03:09:23,929 --> 03:09:23,939
gross but actually it's growing slower
 

10045
03:09:23,939 --> 03:09:26,030
gross but actually it's growing slower
than what nuclear it was growing in the

10046
03:09:26,030 --> 03:09:26,040
than what nuclear it was growing in the
 

10047
03:09:26,040 --> 03:09:28,250
than what nuclear it was growing in the
70s and 80s which I thought was a fun

10048
03:09:28,250 --> 03:09:28,260
70s and 80s which I thought was a fun
 

10049
03:09:28,260 --> 03:09:30,230
70s and 80s which I thought was a fun
Point not by a little amount by like two

10050
03:09:30,230 --> 03:09:30,240
Point not by a little amount by like two
 

10051
03:09:30,240 --> 03:09:32,809
Point not by a little amount by like two
or three times so so we're we're still

10052
03:09:32,809 --> 03:09:32,819
or three times so so we're we're still
 

10053
03:09:32,819 --> 03:09:34,550
or three times so so we're we're still
talking about you know something which

10054
03:09:34,550 --> 03:09:34,560
talking about you know something which
 

10055
03:09:34,560 --> 03:09:36,830
talking about you know something which
is you know somewhat Boutique at least

10056
03:09:36,830 --> 03:09:36,840
is you know somewhat Boutique at least
 

10057
03:09:36,840 --> 03:09:39,710
is you know somewhat Boutique at least
and and when you then look out into the

10058
03:09:39,710 --> 03:09:39,720
and and when you then look out into the
 

10059
03:09:39,720 --> 03:09:41,870
and and when you then look out into the
future and and I think this is the

10060
03:09:41,870 --> 03:09:41,880
future and and I think this is the
 

10061
03:09:41,880 --> 03:09:43,730
future and and I think this is the
interesting part of it when you look out

10062
03:09:43,730 --> 03:09:43,740
interesting part of it when you look out
 

10063
03:09:43,740 --> 03:09:45,950
interesting part of it when you look out
into the future if you look at the Biden

10064
03:09:45,950 --> 03:09:45,960
into the future if you look at the Biden
 

10065
03:09:45,960 --> 03:09:47,750
into the future if you look at the Biden
administration's own estimate of what

10066
03:09:47,750 --> 03:09:47,760
administration's own estimate of what
 

10067
03:09:47,760 --> 03:09:50,330
administration's own estimate of what
will happen by 2050.

10068
03:09:50,330 --> 03:09:50,340
will happen by 2050.
 

10069
03:09:50,340 --> 03:09:53,809
will happen by 2050.
we will be at you know if all countries

10070
03:09:53,809 --> 03:09:53,819
we will be at you know if all countries
 

10071
03:09:53,819 --> 03:09:55,550
we will be at you know if all countries
do all the stuff that they promised and

10072
03:09:55,550 --> 03:09:55,560
do all the stuff that they promised and
 

10073
03:09:55,560 --> 03:09:57,950
do all the stuff that they promised and
everything we will be at 70 percent

10074
03:09:57,950 --> 03:09:57,960
everything we will be at 70 percent
 

10075
03:09:57,960 --> 03:10:02,090
everything we will be at 70 percent
fossil fuels by 2050. globally this this

10076
03:10:02,090 --> 03:10:02,100
fossil fuels by 2050. globally this this
 

10077
03:10:02,100 --> 03:10:05,030
fossil fuels by 2050. globally this this
is just yes it's a it's a better world I

10078
03:10:05,030 --> 03:10:05,040
is just yes it's a it's a better world I
 

10079
03:10:05,040 --> 03:10:07,010
is just yes it's a it's a better world I
I think it's good that we're now down to

10080
03:10:07,010 --> 03:10:07,020
I think it's good that we're now down to
 

10081
03:10:07,020 --> 03:10:10,790
I think it's good that we're now down to
70 instead of uh of 80. but it is still

10082
03:10:10,790 --> 03:10:10,800
70 instead of uh of 80. but it is still
 

10083
03:10:10,800 --> 03:10:13,190
70 instead of uh of 80. but it is still
a world that's fundamentally dependent

10084
03:10:13,190 --> 03:10:13,200
a world that's fundamentally dependent
 

10085
03:10:13,200 --> 03:10:15,230
a world that's fundamentally dependent
on fossil fuels for almost everything

10086
03:10:15,230 --> 03:10:15,240
on fossil fuels for almost everything
 

10087
03:10:15,240 --> 03:10:17,990
on fossil fuels for almost everything
that we really like about the world and

10088
03:10:17,990 --> 03:10:18,000
that we really like about the world and
 

10089
03:10:18,000 --> 03:10:20,030
that we really like about the world and
forgetting that and I think we are doing

10090
03:10:20,030 --> 03:10:20,040
forgetting that and I think we are doing
 

10091
03:10:20,040 --> 03:10:22,550
forgetting that and I think we are doing
that in the sense as you also mentioned

10092
03:10:22,550 --> 03:10:22,560
that in the sense as you also mentioned
 

10093
03:10:22,560 --> 03:10:24,769
that in the sense as you also mentioned
that people say no fossil fuels and you

10094
03:10:24,769 --> 03:10:24,779
that people say no fossil fuels and you
 

10095
03:10:24,779 --> 03:10:26,090
that people say no fossil fuels and you
know we're in all development

10096
03:10:26,090 --> 03:10:26,100
know we're in all development
 

10097
03:10:26,100 --> 03:10:28,490
know we're in all development
organizations we're now telling the poor

10098
03:10:28,490 --> 03:10:28,500
organizations we're now telling the poor
 

10099
03:10:28,500 --> 03:10:30,950

countries you can't get any funding for
 

10101
03:10:30,960 --> 03:10:32,570
countries you can't get any funding for
anything that has to do with fossil

10102
03:10:32,570 --> 03:10:32,580
anything that has to do with fossil
 

10103
03:10:32,580 --> 03:10:36,349
anything that has to do with fossil
fuels we have literally reduced our our

10104
03:10:36,349 --> 03:10:36,359
fuels we have literally reduced our our
 

10105
03:10:36,359 --> 03:10:40,910

uh investment in uh in oil and gas by

10106
03:10:40,910 --> 03:10:40,920
uh investment in uh in oil and gas by
 

10107
03:10:40,920 --> 03:10:44,450
uh investment in uh in oil and gas by
more than half since 2014 and much of

10108
03:10:44,450 --> 03:10:44,460
more than half since 2014 and much of
 

10109
03:10:44,460 --> 03:10:47,090
more than half since 2014 and much of
this is because of climate concerns this

10110
03:10:47,090 --> 03:10:47,100
this is because of climate concerns this
 

10111
03:10:47,100 --> 03:10:49,610
this is because of climate concerns this
has real world consequences this is why

10112
03:10:49,610 --> 03:10:49,620
has real world consequences this is why
 

10113
03:10:49,620 --> 03:10:52,130
has real world consequences this is why
and Enterprises have gone up it's not

10114
03:10:52,130 --> 03:10:52,140
and Enterprises have gone up it's not
 

10115
03:10:52,140 --> 03:10:54,530
and Enterprises have gone up it's not
the only reason covet also certainly the

10116
03:10:54,530 --> 03:10:54,540
the only reason covet also certainly the
 

10117
03:10:54,540 --> 03:10:57,190
the only reason covet also certainly the
war in Ukraine but this is an underlying

10118
03:10:57,190 --> 03:10:57,200
war in Ukraine but this is an underlying
 

10119
03:10:57,200 --> 03:11:00,290
war in Ukraine but this is an underlying
systemic reason why fossil fuel costs

10120
03:11:00,290 --> 03:11:00,300
systemic reason why fossil fuel costs
 

10121
03:11:00,300 --> 03:11:02,210
systemic reason why fossil fuel costs
will go up dramatically now a lot of

10122
03:11:02,210 --> 03:11:02,220
will go up dramatically now a lot of
 

10123
03:11:02,220 --> 03:11:04,370
will go up dramatically now a lot of
greens will sort of tend to say well

10124
03:11:04,370 --> 03:11:04,380
greens will sort of tend to say well
 

10125
03:11:04,380 --> 03:11:06,230
greens will sort of tend to say well
that's great because you know we want

10126
03:11:06,230 --> 03:11:06,240
that's great because you know we want
 

10127
03:11:06,240 --> 03:11:08,330
that's great because you know we want
fossil fuels to be expensive we want

10128
03:11:08,330 --> 03:11:08,340
fossil fuels to be expensive we want
 

10129
03:11:08,340 --> 03:11:10,610
fossil fuels to be expensive we want
people to be forced over to Renewables

10130
03:11:10,610 --> 03:11:10,620
people to be forced over to Renewables
 

10131
03:11:10,620 --> 03:11:13,370
people to be forced over to Renewables
but that's very easy to say if you're

10132
03:11:13,370 --> 03:11:13,380
but that's very easy to say if you're
 

10133
03:11:13,380 --> 03:11:15,050
but that's very easy to say if you're
rich you know it's the kind of thing

10134
03:11:15,050 --> 03:11:15,060
rich you know it's the kind of thing
 

10135
03:11:15,060 --> 03:11:16,910
rich you know it's the kind of thing
that New Yorkers will say you know when

10136
03:11:16,910 --> 03:11:16,920
that New Yorkers will say you know when
 

10137
03:11:16,920 --> 03:11:19,670
that New Yorkers will say you know when
when you go to Rich well-meaning uh

10138
03:11:19,670 --> 03:11:19,680
when you go to Rich well-meaning uh
 

10139
03:11:19,680 --> 03:11:22,010
when you go to Rich well-meaning uh
Green New Yorkers and say Yes gasoline

10140
03:11:22,010 --> 03:11:22,020
Green New Yorkers and say Yes gasoline
 

10141
03:11:22,020 --> 03:11:24,530
Green New Yorkers and say Yes gasoline
should cost twenty dollars a gallon well

10142
03:11:24,530 --> 03:11:24,540
should cost twenty dollars a gallon well
 

10143
03:11:24,540 --> 03:11:27,349
should cost twenty dollars a gallon well
you don't have a car just right at the

10144
03:11:27,349 --> 03:11:27,359
you don't have a car just right at the
 

10145
03:11:27,359 --> 03:11:29,030
you don't have a car just right at the
Metro it's very easy for you to say that

10146
03:11:29,030 --> 03:11:29,040
Metro it's very easy for you to say that
 

10147
03:11:29,040 --> 03:11:31,250
Metro it's very easy for you to say that
but lots of people both in the rich

10148
03:11:31,250 --> 03:11:31,260
but lots of people both in the rich
 

10149
03:11:31,260 --> 03:11:33,290
but lots of people both in the rich
world but you know in in poor parts of

10150
03:11:33,290 --> 03:11:33,300
world but you know in in poor parts of
 

10151
03:11:33,300 --> 03:11:35,750
world but you know in in poor parts of
the U.S but all around the world their

10152
03:11:35,750 --> 03:11:35,760
the U.S but all around the world their
 

10153
03:11:35,760 --> 03:11:37,429
the U.S but all around the world their
lives have basically dependent on fossil

10154
03:11:37,429 --> 03:11:37,439
lives have basically dependent on fossil
 

10155
03:11:37,439 --> 03:11:39,650
lives have basically dependent on fossil
fuels and so the idea that we're going

10156
03:11:39,650 --> 03:11:39,660
fuels and so the idea that we're going
 

10157
03:11:39,660 --> 03:11:41,690
fuels and so the idea that we're going
to get people off by making it so

10158
03:11:41,690 --> 03:11:41,700
to get people off by making it so
 

10159
03:11:41,700 --> 03:11:43,730
to get people off by making it so
expensive that it becomes impossible for

10160
03:11:43,730 --> 03:11:43,740
expensive that it becomes impossible for
 

10161
03:11:43,740 --> 03:11:46,309
expensive that it becomes impossible for
them to live good lives is almost

10162
03:11:46,309 --> 03:11:46,319
them to live good lives is almost
 

10163
03:11:46,319 --> 03:11:49,010
them to live good lives is almost
morally reprehensible and I think Alex

10164
03:11:49,010 --> 03:11:49,020
morally reprehensible and I think Alex
 

10165
03:11:49,020 --> 03:11:52,130
morally reprehensible and I think Alex
has the right point there we need to get

10166
03:11:52,130 --> 03:11:52,140
has the right point there we need to get
 

10167
03:11:52,140 --> 03:11:54,410
has the right point there we need to get
people to realize we're not going to get

10168
03:11:54,410 --> 03:11:54,420
people to realize we're not going to get
 

10169
03:11:54,420 --> 03:11:56,889
people to realize we're not going to get
off fossil fuels anytime soon so we need

10170
03:11:56,889 --> 03:11:56,899
off fossil fuels anytime soon so we need
 

10171
03:11:56,899 --> 03:11:59,570
off fossil fuels anytime soon so we need
reasonably affordable fossil fuels for

10172
03:11:59,570 --> 03:11:59,580
reasonably affordable fossil fuels for
 

10173
03:11:59,580 --> 03:12:01,190
reasonably affordable fossil fuels for
most of the world and that's of course

10174
03:12:01,190 --> 03:12:01,200
most of the world and that's of course
 

10175
03:12:01,200 --> 03:12:03,349
most of the world and that's of course
course why we need to focus so much more

10176
03:12:03,349 --> 03:12:03,359
course why we need to focus so much more
 

10177
03:12:03,359 --> 03:12:05,570
course why we need to focus so much more
on the Innovation so that we can get to

10178
03:12:05,570 --> 03:12:05,580
on the Innovation so that we can get to
 

10179
03:12:05,580 --> 03:12:07,550
on the Innovation so that we can get to
the point where we no longer need fossil

10180
03:12:07,550 --> 03:12:07,560
the point where we no longer need fossil
 

10181
03:12:07,560 --> 03:12:10,130
the point where we no longer need fossil
fuels as soon as possible but to say to

10182
03:12:10,130 --> 03:12:10,140
fuels as soon as possible but to say to
 

10183
03:12:10,140 --> 03:12:12,110
fuels as soon as possible but to say to
everyone look we're going to make fossil

10184
03:12:12,110 --> 03:12:12,120
everyone look we're going to make fossil
 

10185
03:12:12,120 --> 03:12:13,969
everyone look we're going to make fossil
fuels expensive way before we have the

10186
03:12:13,969 --> 03:12:13,979
fuels expensive way before we have the
 

10187
03:12:13,979 --> 03:12:15,889
fuels expensive way before we have the
solution is just terrible and the rich

10188
03:12:15,889 --> 03:12:15,899
solution is just terrible and the rich
 

10189
03:12:15,899 --> 03:12:18,769
solution is just terrible and the rich
the so much is on the rich countries of

03:12:18,769 --> 03:12:18,779
the so much is on the rich countries of
 

10191

03:17:33,240 --> 03:17:35,450
have an answer to the question about all
these climate related things so that's a

10460
03:17:35,450 --> 03:17:35,460
these climate related things so that's a
 

10461
03:17:35,460 --> 03:17:39,230
these climate related things so that's a
long way of asking the question of what

how is politics mixed into all of this
 

10465
03:17:42,479 --> 03:17:45,769
how is politics mixed into all of this
yeah on the communication front on the

10466
03:17:45,769 --> 03:17:45,779
yeah on the communication front on the
 

10467

yeah on the communication front on the
figuring out what the right policy is

10471
03:17:52,200 --> 03:17:54,050
front on the friction of humanity in the
face of the right policies well I've

10472
03:17:54,050 --> 03:17:54,060
face of the right policies well I've
 

10473
03:17:54,060 --> 03:17:56,330
face of the right policies well I've
written a ton on this after I had that

10474
03:17:56,330 --> 03:17:56,340
written a ton on this after I had that
 

10475

2006 I began digging in a lot more on

10478
03:18:02,090 --> 03:18:02,100
2006 I began digging in a lot more on
 

10479
03:18:02,100 --> 03:18:05,570
2006 I began digging in a lot more on
how people hold beliefs and what they do

10480
03:18:05,570 --> 03:18:05,580
how people hold beliefs and what they do
 

10481

how people hold beliefs and what they do
as opposed to what they think and

as opposed to what they think and
 

10483
03:18:08,580 --> 03:18:10,969
as opposed to what they think and
questions about polling and there's two

10484
03:18:10,969 --> 03:18:10,979
questions about polling and there's two
 

10485
03:18:10,979 --> 03:18:13,070
questions about polling and there's two
things that come to me that make me not

10486
03:18:13,070 --> 03:18:13,080
things that come to me that make me not
 

10487
03:18:13,080 --> 03:18:16,429
things that come to me that make me not
worry about the basic literacy like is

10488
03:18:16,429 --> 03:18:16,439
worry about the basic literacy like is
 

10489
03:18:16,439 --> 03:18:18,769
worry about the basic literacy like is
is climate change X percent of whatever

10490
03:18:18,769 --> 03:18:18,779
is climate change X percent of whatever
 

10491
03:18:18,779 --> 03:18:21,650
is climate change X percent of whatever
I don't really care about that and I'll

10492
03:18:21,650 --> 03:18:21,660
I don't really care about that and I'll
 

10493
03:18:21,660 --> 03:18:23,330
I don't really care about that and I'll
explain why

10494
03:18:23,330 --> 03:18:23,340
explain why
 

10495
03:18:23,340 --> 03:18:25,130

um for one thing
 

10497
03:18:25,140 --> 03:18:27,889
um for one thing
more science literacy more basic

10498
03:18:27,889 --> 03:18:27,899
more science literacy more basic
 

10499
03:18:27,899 --> 03:18:30,769
more science literacy more basic
literacy like what is a greenhouse gas

10500
03:18:30,769 --> 03:18:30,779
literacy like what is a greenhouse gas

Innovation if you ask about more and
more incentives for Renewable Power

Oklahoma Iowa you know I did a piece

10618

Oklahoma Iowa you know I did a piece
 

10619
03:20:48,899 --> 03:20:50,809
Oklahoma Iowa you know I did a piece
when I was at propublica showing that

10620
03:20:50,809 --> 03:20:50,819
when I was at propublica showing that
 

10621
03:20:50,819 --> 03:20:55,190
when I was at propublica showing that
the 17 states that were fighting Obama

10622
03:20:55,190 --> 03:20:55,200
the 17 states that were fighting Obama
 

10623
03:20:55,200 --> 03:20:58,790
the 17 states that were fighting Obama
in court over his clean power plan

10624
03:20:58,790 --> 03:20:58,800
in court over his clean power plan
 

10625
03:20:58,800 --> 03:21:01,190
in court over his clean power plan
we're actually the majority of them were

10626
03:21:01,190 --> 03:21:01,200
we're actually the majority of them were
 

10627
03:21:01,200 --> 03:21:02,750
we're actually the majority of them were
actually meeting the targets that the

10628
03:21:02,750 --> 03:21:02,760
actually meeting the targets that the
 

10629
03:21:02,760 --> 03:21:04,610
actually meeting the targets that the
clean power plan had

10630
03:21:04,610 --> 03:21:04,620
clean power plan had
 

10631
03:21:04,620 --> 03:21:06,769

because they're expanding wind power

10632
03:21:06,769 --> 03:21:06,779
because they're expanding wind power
 

10633
03:21:06,779 --> 03:21:09,110
because they're expanding wind power
already not because of the climate

10634
03:21:09,110 --> 03:21:09,120
already not because of the climate
 

10635
03:21:09,120 --> 03:21:11,809
already not because of the climate
because it makes money sense and energy

10636
03:21:11,809 --> 03:21:11,819
because it makes money sense and energy
 

10637
03:21:11,819 --> 03:21:13,070
because it makes money sense and energy
sense so you don't think there's a

10638
03:21:13,070 --> 03:21:13,080
sense so you don't think there's a
 

10639
03:21:13,080 --> 03:21:14,870
sense so you don't think there's a
political divide in this there is on

10640
03:21:14,870 --> 03:21:14,880
political divide in this there is on
 

10641
03:21:14,880 --> 03:21:17,090
political divide in this there is on
climate if you call it climate if you

10642
03:21:17,090 --> 03:21:17,100
climate if you call it climate if you
 

10643
03:21:17,100 --> 03:21:18,830
climate if you call it climate if you
say it's a climate do you believe in the

10644
03:21:18,830 --> 03:21:18,840
say it's a climate do you believe in the
 

10645
03:21:18,840 --> 03:21:21,230
say it's a climate do you believe in the
climate crisis you're not asking

10646
03:21:21,230 --> 03:21:21,240
climate crisis you're not asking
 

10647
03:21:21,240 --> 03:21:23,030
climate crisis you're not asking
what kind of energy future do you want

10648
03:21:23,030 --> 03:21:23,040
what kind of energy future do you want
 

10649
03:21:23,040 --> 03:21:24,590
what kind of energy future do you want
in your town

10650
03:21:24,590 --> 03:21:24,600
in your town
 

10651
03:21:24,600 --> 03:21:26,809
in your town
and so if you if you ask that question

10652
03:21:26,809 --> 03:21:26,819
and so if you if you ask that question
 

10653
03:21:26,819 --> 03:21:29,150
and so if you if you ask that question
the polarization goes away

10654
03:21:29,150 --> 03:21:29,160
the polarization goes away
 

10655
03:21:29,160 --> 03:21:31,490
the polarization goes away
well I guess I'm asking is there

10656
03:21:31,490 --> 03:21:31,500
well I guess I'm asking is there
 

10657
03:21:31,500 --> 03:21:33,950
well I guess I'm asking is there
polarization on policy no well well

10658
03:21:33,950 --> 03:21:33,960
polarization on policy no well well
 

10659

10725
03:22:47,460 --> 03:22:49,010
oh sure yeah you know when people get
attached to an issue if that's what pops

10726
03:22:49,010 --> 03:22:49,020
attached to an issue if that's what pops
 

10727
03:22:49,020 --> 03:22:50,230
attached to an issue if that's what pops
into your head

10728
03:22:50,230 --> 03:22:50,240
into your head
 

10729
03:22:50,240 --> 03:22:52,849
into your head
when you hear climate then and it got

10730
03:22:52,849 --> 03:22:52,859
when you hear climate then and it got
 

10731
03:22:52,859 --> 03:22:55,210
when you hear climate then and it got
politicized it became

10732
03:22:55,210 --> 03:22:55,220
politicized it became
 

10733
03:22:55,220 --> 03:22:56,990
politicized it became
emblematic

10734
03:22:56,990 --> 03:22:57,000
emblematic
 

10735
03:22:57,000 --> 03:22:59,330
emblematic
and and the you know the whole vaccine

10736
03:22:59,330 --> 03:22:59,340
and and the you know the whole vaccine
 

10737
03:22:59,340 --> 03:23:00,230
and and the you know the whole vaccine
thing

10738
03:23:00,230 --> 03:23:00,240
thing
 

10739
03:23:00,240 --> 03:23:02,630
thing
I mean I'm not American so I should stay

10740
03:23:02,630 --> 03:23:02,640
I mean I'm not American so I should stay
 

10741
03:23:02,640 --> 03:23:04,790
I mean I'm not American so I should stay
a little bit out of this but I think uh

10742
03:23:04,790 --> 03:23:04,800
a little bit out of this but I think uh
 

10743
03:23:04,800 --> 03:23:07,670
a little bit out of this but I think uh
it seems to me that a lot of the thing

10744
03:23:07,670 --> 03:23:07,680
it seems to me that a lot of the thing
 

10745
03:23:07,680 --> 03:23:10,309
it seems to me that a lot of the thing
that people believe and talk about is

10746
03:23:10,309 --> 03:23:10,319
that people believe and talk about is
 

10747
03:23:10,319 --> 03:23:12,290
that people believe and talk about is
really about what they worried that that

10748
03:23:12,290 --> 03:23:12,300
really about what they worried that that
 

10749
03:23:12,300 --> 03:23:15,290
really about what they worried that that
will lead to in terms of policy down the

10750
03:23:15,290 --> 03:23:15,300
will lead to in terms of policy down the
 

10751
03:23:15,300 --> 03:23:18,110
will lead to in terms of policy down the
line so a little bit like do masks work

10752
03:23:18,110 --> 03:23:18,120
line so a little bit like do masks work
 

10753
03:23:18,120 --> 03:23:20,990
line so a little bit like do masks work
I'm I'm sort of imagining I don't know

10754
03:23:20,990 --> 03:23:21,000
I'm I'm sort of imagining I don't know
 

10755
03:23:21,000 --> 03:23:22,790
I'm I'm sort of imagining I don't know
whether this is true but I think part of

10756
03:23:22,790 --> 03:23:22,800
whether this is true but I think part of
 

10757
03:23:22,800 --> 03:23:25,550
whether this is true but I think part of
it is if I say masks work they're gonna

10758
03:23:25,550 --> 03:23:25,560
it is if I say masks work they're gonna
 

10759
03:23:25,560 --> 03:23:28,370
it is if I say masks work they're gonna
force me to wear it for the next year so

10760
03:23:28,370 --> 03:23:28,380
force me to wear it for the next year so
 

10761
03:23:28,380 --> 03:23:29,870
force me to wear it for the next year so
it doesn't work because then I don't

10762
03:23:29,870 --> 03:23:29,880
it doesn't work because then I don't
 

10763
03:23:29,880 --> 03:23:31,729
it doesn't work because then I don't
have to wear it kind of thing that it's

10764
03:23:31,729 --> 03:23:31,739
have to wear it kind of thing that it's
 

10765
03:23:31,739 --> 03:23:33,950
have to wear it kind of thing that it's
really uh uh you're you're looking much

10766
03:23:33,950 --> 03:23:33,960
really uh uh you're you're looking much
 

10767
03:23:33,960 --> 03:23:35,870
really uh uh you're you're looking much
further down the line and certainly on

10768
03:23:35,870 --> 03:23:35,880
further down the line and certainly on
 

10769
03:23:35,880 --> 03:23:37,910
further down the line and certainly on
climate it seems to me that a lot of the

10770
03:23:37,910 --> 03:23:37,920
climate it seems to me that a lot of the
 

10771
03:23:37,920 --> 03:23:40,849
climate it seems to me that a lot of the
people who say it's not real it's not

10772
03:23:40,849 --> 03:23:40,859
people who say it's not real it's not
 

10773
03:23:40,859 --> 03:23:42,889
people who say it's not real it's not
because they don't know it's of course

10774
03:23:42,889 --> 03:23:42,899
because they don't know it's of course
 

10775
03:23:42,899 --> 03:23:44,870
because they don't know it's of course
it's real but it's that they don't want

10776
03:23:44,870 --> 03:23:44,880
it's real but it's that they don't want
 

10777
03:23:44,880 --> 03:23:47,570
it's real but it's that they don't want
you to then come and regulate it heavily

10778
03:23:47,570 --> 03:23:47,580
you to then come and regulate it heavily
 

10779
03:23:47,580 --> 03:23:49,370
you to then come and regulate it heavily
yeah uh so it's because they don't like

10780
03:23:49,370 --> 03:23:49,380
yeah uh so it's because they don't like
 

10781
03:23:49,380 --> 03:23:51,410
yeah uh so it's because they don't like
top-down government yeah and also

10782
03:23:51,410 --> 03:23:51,420
top-down government yeah and also
 

10783
03:23:51,420 --> 03:23:53,269
top-down government yeah and also
because they don't want another tax and

10784
03:23:53,269 --> 03:23:53,279
because they don't want another tax and
 

10785
03:23:53,279 --> 03:23:56,389
because they don't want another tax and
you know there's lots of of so it's it's

10786
03:23:56,389 --> 03:23:56,399
you know there's lots of of so it's it's
 

10787
03:23:56,399 --> 03:23:58,490
you know there's lots of of so it's it's
really it's not a science it's not a

10788
03:23:58,490 --> 03:23:58,500
really it's not a science it's not a
 

10789
03:23:58,500 --> 03:24:01,010
really it's not a science it's not a
straight science question it really is a

10790
03:24:01,010 --> 03:24:01,020
straight science question it really is a
 

10791
03:24:01,020 --> 03:24:03,469
straight science question it really is a
question what do you want to do and

10792
03:24:03,469 --> 03:24:03,479
question what do you want to do and
 

10793
03:24:03,479 --> 03:24:05,389
question what do you want to do and
that's where I think Andy you're much

10794
03:24:05,389 --> 03:24:05,399
that's where I think Andy you're much
 

10795
03:24:05,399 --> 03:24:07,309
that's where I think Andy you're much
much more right in saying we should you

10796
03:24:07,309 --> 03:24:07,319
much more right in saying we should you
 

10797
03:24:07,319 --> 03:24:09,769
much more right in saying we should you
know have that discussion so what do you

10798
03:24:09,769 --> 03:24:09,779
know have that discussion so what do you
 

10799
03:24:09,779 --> 03:24:12,290
know have that discussion so what do you
want to do because that will be a much

10800
03:24:12,290 --> 03:24:12,300
want to do because that will be a much
 

10801
03:24:12,300 --> 03:24:14,269
want to do because that will be a much
easier conversation to say do you want

10802
03:24:14,269 --> 03:24:14,279
easier conversation to say do you want
 

10803
03:24:14,279 --> 03:24:16,370
easier conversation to say do you want
to do really smart cheap stuff or do you

10804
03:24:16,370 --> 03:24:16,380
to do really smart cheap stuff or do you
 

10805
03:24:16,380 --> 03:24:18,530
to do really smart cheap stuff or do you
want to do pretty dumb expensive stuff

10806
03:24:18,530 --> 03:24:18,540
want to do pretty dumb expensive stuff
 

10807
03:24:18,540 --> 03:24:20,450
want to do pretty dumb expensive stuff
when you put it that way you you can get

10808
03:24:20,450 --> 03:24:20,460
when you put it that way you you can get
 

10809
03:24:20,460 --> 03:24:22,490
when you put it that way you you can get
most people of course it's not as simple

10810
03:24:22,490 --> 03:24:22,500
most people of course it's not as simple
 

10811
03:24:22,500 --> 03:24:24,290
most people of course it's not as simple
as that I know and it gets back to what

10812
03:24:24,290 --> 03:24:24,300
as that I know and it gets back to what
 

10813
03:24:24,300 --> 03:24:26,150
as that I know and it gets back to what
you said earlier that again you talked

10814
03:24:26,150 --> 03:24:26,160
you said earlier that again you talked
 

10815
03:24:26,160 --> 03:24:27,889
you said earlier that again you talked
about collaborative cooperation or

10816
03:24:27,889 --> 03:24:27,899
about collaborative cooperation or
 

10817
03:24:27,899 --> 03:24:28,809
about collaborative cooperation or
whatever

whatever
there's a guy at Columbia Peter Coleman

10820
03:24:31,550 --> 03:24:31,560
there's a guy at Columbia Peter Coleman
 

10821
03:24:31,560 --> 03:24:32,870
there's a guy at Columbia Peter Coleman
who runs this thing called the difficult

yeah yeah that's awesome and when I

10826
03:24:37,370 --> 03:24:37,380
yeah yeah that's awesome and when I
 

10827
03:24:37,380 --> 03:24:38,510
yeah yeah that's awesome and when I
first heard about it I was like oh man

10828
03:24:38,510 --> 03:24:38,520
first heard about it I was like oh man
 

10829
03:24:38,520 --> 03:24:41,450
first heard about it I was like oh man
we need that you know and uh his

10830
03:24:41,450 --> 03:24:41,460
we need that you know and uh his

get over and
 

10841
03:24:51,300 --> 03:24:53,210
get over and
um and there's there's a science to how

10842
03:24:53,210 --> 03:24:53,220
um and there's there's a science to how
 

10843

um and there's there's a science to how
to hold a better conversation is you

10844
03:24:55,670 --> 03:24:55,680
to hold a better conversation is you
 

10845
03:24:55,680 --> 03:24:58,910
to hold a better conversation is you
either through experience or whatever no

10846
03:24:58,910 --> 03:24:58,920
either through experience or whatever no
 

10847
03:24:58,920 --> 03:25:01,429
either through experience or whatever no
um you could if you hold a debate like I

10848
03:25:01,429 --> 03:25:01,439
um you could if you hold a debate like I
 

10849
03:25:01,439 --> 03:25:02,570
um you could if you hold a debate like I
wouldn't want to be in a debate with

wouldn't want to be in a debate with
Bjorn we could find lots of things we

10852
03:25:04,070 --> 03:25:04,080
Bjorn we could find lots of things we
 

10853
03:25:04,080 --> 03:25:06,290
Bjorn we could find lots of things we
disagree on but that's that takes it

10854
03:25:06,290 --> 03:25:06,300
disagree on but that's that takes it
 

10855
03:25:06,300 --> 03:25:08,690
disagree on but that's that takes it
back to the win-lose model right who

10856
03:25:08,690 --> 03:25:08,700
back to the win-lose model right who
 

10857
03:25:08,700 --> 03:25:11,210
back to the win-lose model right who
want that's not how you make progress

10858
03:25:11,210 --> 03:25:11,220
want that's not how you make progress
 

10859
03:25:11,220 --> 03:25:13,429
want that's not how you make progress
and what Peter

and what Peter
 

10861
03:25:13,439 --> 03:25:15,469
and what Peter
when I what I learned absorbed from him

10862
03:25:15,469 --> 03:25:15,479

03:25:19,250 --> 03:25:19,260
because I was thinking like we need room
 

10867

for agreement I need to build a room for

10868
03:25:20,750 --> 03:25:20,760
for agreement I need to build a room for

03:25:24,950 --> 03:25:24,960
then the stuff I do now you know it's
 

10873
03:25:24,960 --> 03:25:26,510
then the stuff I do now you know it's
like how can we talk

10874
03:25:26,510 --> 03:25:26,520
like how can we talk
 

10875
03:25:26,520 --> 03:25:28,250
like how can we talk
and come to agreement he says no no you

10876
03:25:28,250 --> 03:25:28,260
and come to agreement he says no no you
 

10877
03:25:28,260 --> 03:25:29,389
and come to agreement he says no no you
don't want agreement you want

10878
03:25:29,389 --> 03:25:29,399
don't want agreement you want
 

10879
03:25:29,399 --> 03:25:30,950
don't want agreement you want
cooperation

10880
03:25:30,950 --> 03:25:30,960
cooperation
 

10881
03:25:30,960 --> 03:25:33,110
cooperation
that allows you to hold on to your

10882
03:25:33,110 --> 03:25:33,120
that allows you to hold on to your
 

10883
03:25:33,120 --> 03:25:34,790
that allows you to hold on to your
beliefs

10884
03:25:34,790 --> 03:25:34,800
beliefs
 

10885
03:25:34,800 --> 03:25:37,130
beliefs
but to we're good you know we can

10886
03:25:37,130 --> 03:25:37,140
but to we're good you know we can
 

10887
03:25:37,140 --> 03:25:38,870
but to we're good you know we can
disbelieve it we can disagree on all

10888
03:25:38,870 --> 03:25:38,880
disbelieve it we can disagree on all
 

10889
03:25:38,880 --> 03:25:40,190
disbelieve it we can disagree on all
these things but let's cooperate on that

10890
03:25:40,190 --> 03:25:40,200
these things but let's cooperate on that
 

10891
03:25:40,200 --> 03:25:41,030
these things but let's cooperate on that
one thing

10892
03:25:41,030 --> 03:25:41,040
one thing
 

10893
03:25:41,040 --> 03:25:43,309
one thing
and that's that's a really valuable

10894
03:25:43,309 --> 03:25:43,319
and that's that's a really valuable
 

10895
03:25:43,319 --> 03:25:46,130
and that's that's a really valuable
distinction that's needed so much in

10896
03:25:46,130 --> 03:25:46,140
distinction that's needed so much in
 

10897
03:25:46,140 --> 03:25:48,290
distinction that's needed so much in
this Arena because

10898
03:25:48,290 --> 03:25:48,300
this Arena because
 

10899
03:25:48,300 --> 03:25:50,090
this Arena because
as I said earlier you can parse it right

10900
03:25:50,090 --> 03:25:50,100
as I said earlier you can parse it right

wanted you know transmission lines

10906
03:25:55,490 --> 03:25:55,500

you're now we're going to have big

you're now we're going to have big
 

10909

you're now we're going to have big
fights over transmission lines we've got

03:31:28,670 --> 03:31:28,680
that's the ultimate question like if you
 

11209
03:31:28,680 --> 03:31:31,250
that's the ultimate question like if you
want to understand

11210
03:31:31,250 --> 03:31:31,260

 

11211
03:31:31,260 --> 03:31:35,030

like uh if you talk to Hitler in 1941

fellow journalist right and to people

11222
03:31:46,370 --> 03:31:46,380
fellow journalist right and to people
 

11223
03:31:46,380 --> 03:31:49,729
fellow journalist right and to people

11224
03:31:49,729 --> 03:31:49,739
back home that this me the journalist is
 

11225

on the right side
but if you actually want to understand

03:31:52,969 --> 03:31:52,979
but if you actually want to understand
 

11229
03:31:52,979 --> 03:31:56,809
but if you actually want to understand

very I don't know if you have comments
on this well the there is a background

11516
03:37:27,650 --> 03:37:27,660
on this well the there is a background
 

11517
03:37:27,660 --> 03:37:29,990
on this well the there is a background

uh charcoal to Coal to oil and gas is

11522
03:37:37,910 --> 03:37:37,920
uh charcoal to Coal to oil and gas is
 

11523
03:37:37,920 --> 03:37:40,429
uh charcoal to Coal to oil and gas is
cleaner it's more hydrogen less carbon

11524
03:37:40,429 --> 03:37:40,439
cleaner it's more hydrogen less carbon
 

11525
03:37:40,439 --> 03:37:41,269
cleaner it's more hydrogen less carbon
and

11526

these long trajectories of energy
 

11533
03:37:47,580 --> 03:37:49,309
these long trajectories of energy
when you look at those curves is there

11534
03:37:49,309 --> 03:37:49,319
when you look at those curves is there
 

11535
03:37:49,319 --> 03:37:51,050
when you look at those curves is there
anything in that curve that says oh

11536
03:37:51,050 --> 03:37:51,060
anything in that curve that says oh
 

11537
03:37:51,060 --> 03:37:55,610
anything in that curve that says oh

and it's really hard or China I mean
 

11541
03:37:59,100 --> 03:38:00,830
and it's really hard or China I mean
when China came in

11542
03:38:00,830 --> 03:38:00,840
when China came in
 

11543
03:38:00,840 --> 03:38:02,990
when China came in
with his huge growth and Emissions that

11544
03:38:02,990 --> 03:38:03,000
with his huge growth and Emissions that
 

11545
03:38:03,000 --> 03:38:04,969
with his huge growth and Emissions that
that created a

11546
03:38:04,969 --> 03:38:04,979
that created a
 

11547
03:38:04,979 --> 03:38:07,490
that created a
bit of a recarbonization blip but that

11548
03:38:07,490 --> 03:38:07,500
bit of a recarbonization blip but that
 

11549
03:38:07,500 --> 03:38:08,929
bit of a recarbonization blip but that
was this huge growth in their economy

11550
03:38:08,929 --> 03:38:08,939
was this huge growth in their economy
 

11551
03:38:08,939 --> 03:38:10,849
was this huge growth in their economy
they pulled a bunch of people out of out

11552
03:38:10,849 --> 03:38:10,859
they pulled a bunch of people out of out
 

11553
03:38:10,859 --> 03:38:12,469
they pulled a bunch of people out of out
of poverty

11554
03:38:12,469 --> 03:38:12,479
of poverty
 

11555
03:38:12,479 --> 03:38:14,330
of poverty
um so yeah no presidents don't really

11556
03:38:14,330 --> 03:38:14,340
um so yeah no presidents don't really
 

11557
03:38:14,340 --> 03:38:16,130
um so yeah no presidents don't really
change anything on time scales that we

11558
03:38:16,130 --> 03:38:16,140
change anything on time scales that we
 

11559
03:38:16,140 --> 03:38:18,710
change anything on time scales that we
would measure as meaning where you could

11560
03:38:18,710 --> 03:38:18,720
would measure as meaning where you could
 

11561
03:38:18,720 --> 03:38:21,410
would measure as meaning where you could
parse it out I I think that's not to say

11562
03:38:21,410 --> 03:38:21,420
parse it out I I think that's not to say
 

11563
03:38:21,420 --> 03:38:22,690
parse it out I I think that's not to say
that

11564
03:38:22,690 --> 03:38:22,700
that
 

11565
03:38:22,700 --> 03:38:26,269
that
Obama's and the current focus on on the

11566
03:38:26,269 --> 03:38:26,279
Obama's and the current focus on on the
 

11567
03:38:26,279 --> 03:38:27,769
Obama's and the current focus on on the
stimulus that's happening

11568
03:38:27,769 --> 03:38:27,779
stimulus that's happening
 

11569
03:38:27,779 --> 03:38:29,330
stimulus that's happening
which includes a lot more money for

11570
03:38:29,330 --> 03:38:29,340
which includes a lot more money for
 

11571
03:38:29,340 --> 03:38:30,290
which includes a lot more money for
research

11572
03:38:30,290 --> 03:38:30,300
research
 

11573
03:38:30,300 --> 03:38:32,150
research
Etc and innovation

11574
03:38:32,150 --> 03:38:32,160
Etc and innovation
 

11575
03:38:32,160 --> 03:38:33,710
Etc and innovation
I do think that will have to be

11576
03:38:33,710 --> 03:38:33,720
I do think that will have to be
 

11577
03:38:33,720 --> 03:38:36,110
I do think that will have to be
beneficial in a very very long run but I

11578
03:38:36,110 --> 03:38:36,120
beneficial in a very very long run but I
 

11579
03:38:36,120 --> 03:38:37,429
beneficial in a very very long run but I
have to say

11580
03:38:37,429 --> 03:38:37,439
have to say
 

11581
03:38:37,439 --> 03:38:39,590
have to say
you know when Obama stood up and

11582
03:38:39,590 --> 03:38:39,600
you know when Obama stood up and
 

11583
03:38:39,600 --> 03:38:41,990
you know when Obama stood up and
made credit you know took credit for

11584
03:38:41,990 --> 03:38:42,000
made credit you know took credit for
 

11585
03:38:42,000 --> 03:38:44,290
made credit you know took credit for
reductions from moving from coal to gas

11586
03:38:44,290 --> 03:38:44,300
reductions from moving from coal to gas
 

11587
03:38:44,300 --> 03:38:47,030
reductions from moving from coal to gas
because of fracking

11588
03:38:47,030 --> 03:38:47,040
because of fracking
 

11589
03:38:47,040 --> 03:38:49,190
because of fracking
that was actually Cheney who said that

11590
03:38:49,190 --> 03:38:49,200
that was actually Cheney who said that
 

11591
03:38:49,200 --> 03:38:50,929
that was actually Cheney who said that
emotional thing I was thinking I would

11592
03:38:50,929 --> 03:38:50,939
emotional thing I was thinking I would
 

11593
03:38:50,939 --> 03:38:52,969
emotional thing I was thinking I would
say Bush not because I like him or

11594
03:38:52,969 --> 03:38:52,979
say Bush not because I like him or
 

11595
03:38:52,979 --> 03:38:54,530
say Bush not because I like him or
anything but he's the guy who

11596
03:38:54,530 --> 03:38:54,540
anything but he's the guy who
 

11597
03:38:54,540 --> 03:38:57,410
anything but he's the guy who
inadvertently started fracking right and

11598
03:38:57,410 --> 03:38:57,420
inadvertently started fracking right and
 

11599
03:38:57,420 --> 03:38:58,910
inadvertently started fracking right and
it goes further back than that it was a

11600
03:38:58,910 --> 03:38:58,920
it goes further back than that it was a
 

11601
03:38:58,920 --> 03:39:00,290
it goes further back than that it was a
federal investment in fracking in the

11602
03:39:00,290 --> 03:39:00,300
federal investment in fracking in the
 

11603
03:39:00,300 --> 03:39:02,090
federal investment in fracking in the
60s and 70s and then this one guy in

11604
03:39:02,090 --> 03:39:02,100
60s and 70s and then this one guy in
 

11605
03:39:02,100 --> 03:39:04,190
60s and 70s and then this one guy in
Texas right here in Texas uh George

11606
03:39:04,190 --> 03:39:04,200
Texas right here in Texas uh George
 

11607
03:39:04,200 --> 03:39:06,830
Texas right here in Texas uh George
Mitchell who you know cobbled together

11608
03:39:06,830 --> 03:39:06,840
Mitchell who you know cobbled together

03:39:06,840 --> 03:39:08,210

technology

11610
03:39:08,210 --> 03:39:08,220
technology
 

11611
03:39:08,220 --> 03:39:11,570
technology
and that led to this real dramatic

11612
03:39:11,570 --> 03:39:11,580
and that led to this real dramatic
 

11613
03:39:11,580 --> 03:39:14,450
and that led to this real dramatic
change from gas to Coal that mostly

11614
03:39:14,450 --> 03:39:14,460
change from gas to Coal that mostly
 

11615
03:39:14,460 --> 03:39:16,610
change from gas to Coal that mostly
played out in the Obama years but that

11616
03:39:16,610 --> 03:39:16,620
played out in the Obama years but that
 

11617
03:39:16,620 --> 03:39:18,469
played out in the Obama years but that
really was stimulated by Cheney's early

11618
03:39:18,469 --> 03:39:18,479
really was stimulated by Cheney's early
 

11619
03:39:18,479 --> 03:39:22,429
really was stimulated by Cheney's early
energy task force the 2001 when they

11620
03:39:22,429 --> 03:39:22,439
energy task force the 2001 when they
 

11621
03:39:22,439 --> 03:39:24,290
energy task force the 2001 when they
were getting into office and also bush

11622
03:39:24,290 --> 03:39:24,300
were getting into office and also bush
 

11623
03:39:24,300 --> 03:39:26,389
were getting into office and also bush
bush did something interesting

11624
03:39:26,389 --> 03:39:26,399
bush did something interesting
 

11625
03:39:26,399 --> 03:39:29,090
bush did something interesting
in the whole wonky climate treaty

11626
03:39:29,090 --> 03:39:29,100
in the whole wonky climate treaty
 

11627
03:39:29,100 --> 03:39:30,650
in the whole wonky climate treaty
process

11628
03:39:30,650 --> 03:39:30,660
process
 

11629
03:39:30,660 --> 03:39:32,809
process
it was under Bush that they started to

11630
03:39:32,809 --> 03:39:32,819
it was under Bush that they started to
 

11631
03:39:32,819 --> 03:39:34,429
it was under Bush that they started to
focus on sectors

11632
03:39:34,429 --> 03:39:34,439
focus on sectors
 

11633
03:39:34,439 --> 03:39:37,309
focus on sectors
let's do a they did a oh and also on big

11634
03:39:37,309 --> 03:39:37,319
let's do a they did a oh and also on big
 

11635
03:39:37,319 --> 03:39:39,110
let's do a they did a oh and also on big
emitters let's this isn't about 200

11636
03:39:39,110 --> 03:39:39,120
emitters let's this isn't about 200
 

11637
03:39:39,120 --> 03:39:40,190
emitters let's this isn't about 200
countries

11638
03:39:40,190 --> 03:39:40,200
countries
 

11639
03:39:40,200 --> 03:39:42,410
countries
it's about basically eight or ten

11640
03:39:42,410 --> 03:39:42,420
it's about basically eight or ten
 

11641
03:39:42,420 --> 03:39:45,110
it's about basically eight or ten
countries let's get them into a room and

11642
03:39:45,110 --> 03:39:45,120
countries let's get them into a room and
 

11643
03:39:45,120 --> 03:39:48,110
countries let's get them into a room and
let's have these little sub rooms on

11644
03:39:48,110 --> 03:39:48,120
let's have these little sub rooms on
 

11645
03:39:48,120 --> 03:39:51,349
let's have these little sub rooms on
like electrification on mining on

11646
03:39:51,349 --> 03:39:51,359
like electrification on mining on

and Obama picked up the same model they

11650
03:39:56,030 --> 03:39:56,040
and Obama picked up the same model they
 

11651
03:39:56,040 --> 03:39:57,170
and Obama picked up the same model they
had different names for it because

11652
03:39:57,170 --> 03:39:57,180
had different names for it because
 

11653
03:39:57,180 --> 03:39:58,490
had different names for it because
presidents always named something

11654
03:39:58,490 --> 03:39:58,500
presidents always named something
 

11655
03:39:58,500 --> 03:40:00,710

was the major economies forum and then
 

11659
03:40:02,460 --> 03:40:04,910
was the major economies forum and then
it was the major emitters something or

electrification
 

11671
03:40:16,560 --> 03:40:18,349

makes a difference but but again you

03:40:18,349 --> 03:40:18,359
makes a difference but but again you
 

11673
03:40:18,359 --> 03:40:20,630

the lag time and also I I think one very

11676
03:40:25,130 --> 03:40:25,140
the lag time and also I I think one very
 

11677
03:40:25,140 --> 03:40:28,250
the lag time and also I I think one very
under reported fact the uh uh so the

03:40:28,250 --> 03:40:28,260
under reported fact the uh uh so the
 

11679
03:40:28,260 --> 03:40:31,849
under reported fact the uh uh so the
unep the environment program uh they

11680
03:40:31,849 --> 03:40:31,859
unep the environment program uh they
 

11681
03:40:31,859 --> 03:40:33,590
unep the environment program uh they
come out with a what they call a gap

11682
03:40:33,590 --> 03:40:33,600
come out with a what they call a gap
 

11683
03:40:33,600 --> 03:40:35,929
come out with a what they call a gap
report every year uh where they estimate

11684
03:40:35,929 --> 03:40:35,939

before covet hit they actually did a

11692
03:40:47,090 --> 03:40:47,100
before covet hit they actually did a
 

11693
03:40:47,100 --> 03:40:50,510
before covet hit they actually did a
survey of the 2010s so the last big sort

11694
03:40:50,510 --> 03:40:50,520
survey of the 2010s so the last big sort
 

11695
03:40:50,520 --> 03:40:53,269
survey of the 2010s so the last big sort
of report on how well are we doing and

11696
03:40:53,269 --> 03:40:53,279
of report on how well are we doing and
 

11697
03:40:53,279 --> 03:40:55,070
of report on how well are we doing and
their takeaway quote and I'm not going

11698
03:40:55,070 --> 03:40:55,080
their takeaway quote and I'm not going
 

11699
03:40:55,080 --> 03:40:56,750
their takeaway quote and I'm not going
to get this right but it's pretty much

11700
03:40:56,750 --> 03:40:56,760
to get this right but it's pretty much
 

11701
03:40:56,760 --> 03:40:58,790
to get this right but it's pretty much
what they said was

11702
03:40:58,790 --> 03:40:58,800
what they said was
 

11703
03:40:58,800 --> 03:41:01,490
what they said was
if you take the world as if we hadn't

11704
03:41:01,490 --> 03:41:01,500
if you take the world as if we hadn't
 

11705
03:41:01,500 --> 03:41:04,849
if you take the world as if we hadn't
cared about climate change since 2005.

11706
03:41:04,849 --> 03:41:04,859
cared about climate change since 2005.
 

11707
03:41:04,859 --> 03:41:07,429
cared about climate change since 2005.
we can't tell the difference between

11708
03:41:07,429 --> 03:41:07,439
we can't tell the difference between
 

11709
03:41:07,439 --> 03:41:08,929
we can't tell the difference between
that world

11710
03:41:08,929 --> 03:41:08,939
that world
 

11711
03:41:08,939 --> 03:41:10,550
that world
and the world that we're actually living

11712
03:41:10,550 --> 03:41:10,560
and the world that we're actually living
 

11713
03:41:10,560 --> 03:41:11,630
and the world that we're actually living
in

11714
03:41:11,630 --> 03:41:11,640
in
 

11715
03:41:11,640 --> 03:41:13,790
in
so despite the fact that we've had 10

11716
03:41:13,790 --> 03:41:13,800
so despite the fact that we've had 10
 

11717
03:41:13,800 --> 03:41:16,429
so despite the fact that we've had 10
years of you know immense focus on

11718
03:41:16,429 --> 03:41:16,439
years of you know immense focus on
 

11719
03:41:16,439 --> 03:41:19,070
years of you know immense focus on
climate and everybody talks about it and

11720
03:41:19,070 --> 03:41:19,080
climate and everybody talks about it and
 

11721
03:41:19,080 --> 03:41:20,990
climate and everybody talks about it and
the Paris agreement which is perhaps the

11722
03:41:20,990 --> 03:41:21,000
the Paris agreement which is perhaps the
 

11723
03:41:21,000 --> 03:41:23,150
the Paris agreement which is perhaps the
biggest Global sort of agreement and

11724
03:41:23,150 --> 03:41:23,160
biggest Global sort of agreement and
 

11725
03:41:23,160 --> 03:41:24,950
biggest Global sort of agreement and
what we're going to be doing you can't

11726
03:41:24,950 --> 03:41:24,960
what we're going to be doing you can't
 

11727
03:41:24,960 --> 03:41:26,750
what we're going to be doing you can't
actually tell

11728
03:41:26,750 --> 03:41:26,760
actually tell
 

11729
03:41:26,760 --> 03:41:29,510
actually tell
and that I think is incredibly important

11730
03:41:29,510 --> 03:41:29,520
and that I think is incredibly important
 

11731
03:41:29,520 --> 03:41:31,490
and that I think is incredibly important
because what it tells you is all that

11732
03:41:31,490 --> 03:41:31,500
because what it tells you is all that
 

11733
03:41:31,500 --> 03:41:33,650
because what it tells you is all that
we're doing is not even on the margin

11734
03:41:33,650 --> 03:41:33,660
we're doing is not even on the margin
 

11735
03:41:33,660 --> 03:41:35,570
we're doing is not even on the margin
it's sort of smaller than that and I'm

11736
03:41:35,570 --> 03:41:35,580
it's sort of smaller than that and I'm
 

11737
03:41:35,580 --> 03:41:37,550
it's sort of smaller than that and I'm
not sure what that is but you know we're

11738
03:41:37,550 --> 03:41:37,560
not sure what that is but you know we're
 

11739
03:41:37,560 --> 03:41:39,410
not sure what that is but you know we're
basically dealing in you know so for

11740
03:41:39,410 --> 03:41:39,420
basically dealing in you know so for
 

11741
03:41:39,420 --> 03:41:41,269
basically dealing in you know so for
instance the UK loves to point out that

11742
03:41:41,269 --> 03:41:41,279
instance the UK loves to point out that
 

11743
03:41:41,279 --> 03:41:42,830
instance the UK loves to point out that
they have dramatically reduced their

11744
03:41:42,830 --> 03:41:42,840
they have dramatically reduced their
 

11745
03:41:42,840 --> 03:41:45,170
they have dramatically reduced their
carbon emissions and they have they've

11746
03:41:45,170 --> 03:41:45,180
carbon emissions and they have they've
 

11747
03:41:45,180 --> 03:41:46,610
carbon emissions and they have they've
really dramatically lowered their

11748
03:41:46,610 --> 03:41:46,620
really dramatically lowered their
 

11749
03:41:46,620 --> 03:41:48,710
really dramatically lowered their
emissions but mostly because they've

11750
03:41:48,710 --> 03:41:48,720
emissions but mostly because they've
 

11751
03:41:48,720 --> 03:41:50,929
emissions but mostly because they've
de-industrialized they've basically said

11752
03:41:50,929 --> 03:41:50,939
de-industrialized they've basically said
 

11753
03:41:50,939 --> 03:41:52,849
de-industrialized they've basically said
look we're just going to be Bankers for

11754
03:41:52,849 --> 03:41:52,859
look we're just going to be Bankers for
 

11755
03:41:52,859 --> 03:41:54,710
look we're just going to be Bankers for
all of you guys and then everybody else

11756
03:41:54,710 --> 03:41:54,720
all of you guys and then everybody else
 

11757
03:41:54,720 --> 03:41:56,809
all of you guys and then everybody else
is going to produce our stuff which of

11758
03:41:56,809 --> 03:41:56,819
is going to produce our stuff which of
 

11759
03:41:56,819 --> 03:41:58,910
is going to produce our stuff which of
course is great for Britain or I don't

11760
03:41:58,910 --> 03:41:58,920
course is great for Britain or I don't
 

11761
03:41:58,920 --> 03:42:00,950
course is great for Britain or I don't
know if it's great for Britain but we

11762
03:42:00,950 --> 03:42:00,960
know if it's great for Britain but we
 

11763
03:42:00,960 --> 03:42:04,070
know if it's great for Britain but we
can't all do that and and so most of

11764
03:42:04,070 --> 03:42:04,080
can't all do that and and so most of
 

11765
03:42:04,080 --> 03:42:06,229
can't all do that and and so most of
what we're trying to do right now is is

11766
03:42:06,229 --> 03:42:06,239
what we're trying to do right now is is
 

11767
03:42:06,239 --> 03:42:08,690
what we're trying to do right now is is
sort of you know this virtue signaling

11768
03:42:08,690 --> 03:42:08,700
sort of you know this virtue signaling
 

11769
03:42:08,700 --> 03:42:11,150
sort of you know this virtue signaling
it makes us feel good it's sort of yeah

11770
03:42:11,150 --> 03:42:11,160
it makes us feel good it's sort of yeah
 

11771
03:42:11,160 --> 03:42:13,250
it makes us feel good it's sort of yeah
on the margin or in the very tiny margin

11772
03:42:13,250 --> 03:42:13,260
on the margin or in the very tiny margin
 

11773
03:42:13,260 --> 03:42:15,170
on the margin or in the very tiny margin
but you know what we basically in those

11774
03:42:15,170 --> 03:42:15,180
but you know what we basically in those
 

11775
03:42:15,180 --> 03:42:17,330
but you know what we basically in those
those Andy your point with China

11776
03:42:17,330 --> 03:42:17,340
those Andy your point with China
 

11777
03:42:17,340 --> 03:42:19,070
those Andy your point with China
and the reason why we can't tell the

11778
03:42:19,070 --> 03:42:19,080
and the reason why we can't tell the
 

11779
03:42:19,080 --> 03:42:20,690
and the reason why we can't tell the
difference of course is because China

11780
03:42:20,690 --> 03:42:20,700
difference of course is because China
 

11781
03:42:20,700 --> 03:42:22,250
difference of course is because China
basically became the workshop for

11782
03:42:22,250 --> 03:42:22,260
basically became the workshop for
 

11783
03:42:22,260 --> 03:42:25,070
basically became the workshop for
everyone yeah and and so not only did

11784
03:42:25,070 --> 03:42:25,080
everyone yeah and and so not only did
 

11785
03:42:25,080 --> 03:42:26,450
everyone yeah and and so not only did
they lift more than half a million

11786
03:42:26,450 --> 03:42:26,460
they lift more than half a million
 

11787
03:42:26,460 --> 03:42:29,750
they lift more than half a million
people out of poverty sorry yes half a

11788
03:42:29,750 --> 03:42:29,760
people out of poverty sorry yes half a
 

11789
03:42:29,760 --> 03:42:32,210
people out of poverty sorry yes half a
billion people out of poverty but they

11790
03:42:32,210 --> 03:42:32,220
billion people out of poverty but they
 

11791
03:42:32,220 --> 03:42:34,490
billion people out of poverty but they
also you know basically took over most

11792
03:42:34,490 --> 03:42:34,500
also you know basically took over most
 

11793
03:42:34,500 --> 03:42:36,950
also you know basically took over most
production in the world uh and so of

11794
03:42:36,950 --> 03:42:36,960
production in the world uh and so of
 

11795
03:42:36,960 --> 03:42:38,990
production in the world uh and so of
course you know much many rich countries

11796
03:42:38,990 --> 03:42:39,000
course you know much many rich countries
 

11797
03:42:39,000 --> 03:42:41,330
course you know much many rich countries
could decarbonize and or or at least

11798
03:42:41,330 --> 03:42:41,340
could decarbonize and or or at least
 

11799
03:42:41,340 --> 03:42:42,950
could decarbonize and or or at least
reduce their carbon emissions and feel

11800
03:42:42,950 --> 03:42:42,960
reduce their carbon emissions and feel
 

11801
03:42:42,960 --> 03:42:44,990
reduce their carbon emissions and feel
very virtuous about it but fundamentally

11802
03:42:44,990 --> 03:42:45,000
very virtuous about it but fundamentally
 

11803
03:42:45,000 --> 03:42:47,450
very virtuous about it but fundamentally
we haven't solved how does the world do

11804
03:42:47,450 --> 03:42:47,460
we haven't solved how does the world do
 

11805
03:42:47,460 --> 03:42:49,429
we haven't solved how does the world do
this and and that's why I think we're

11806
03:42:49,429 --> 03:42:49,439
this and and that's why I think we're
 

11807
03:42:49,439 --> 03:42:51,410
this and and that's why I think we're
also left with this sense of not only

11808
03:42:51,410 --> 03:42:51,420
also left with this sense of not only
 

11809
03:42:51,420 --> 03:42:53,330
also left with this sense of not only
are we being told this is a you know

11810
03:42:53,330 --> 03:42:53,340
are we being told this is a you know
 

11811
03:42:53,340 --> 03:42:55,550
are we being told this is a you know
unmitigated catastrophe and that's why

11812
03:42:55,550 --> 03:42:55,560
unmitigated catastrophe and that's why
 

11813
03:42:55,560 --> 03:42:56,809
unmitigated catastrophe and that's why
this is the only thing we should be

11814
03:42:56,809 --> 03:42:56,819
this is the only thing we should be
 

11815
03:42:56,819 --> 03:42:59,210
this is the only thing we should be
focusing on but also somehow and and we

11816
03:42:59,210 --> 03:42:59,220
focusing on but also somehow and and we
 

11817
03:42:59,220 --> 03:43:01,309
focusing on but also somehow and and we
can all fix it and and I don't think we

11818
03:43:01,309 --> 03:43:01,319
can all fix it and and I don't think we
 

11819
03:43:01,319 --> 03:43:03,349
can all fix it and and I don't think we
have any sense of how hard this is

11820
03:43:03,349 --> 03:43:03,359
have any sense of how hard this is
 

11821
03:43:03,359 --> 03:43:04,790
have any sense of how hard this is
actually going to be and that's of

11822
03:43:04,790 --> 03:43:04,800
actually going to be and that's of
 

11823
03:43:04,800 --> 03:43:06,469
actually going to be and that's of
course why I would go back and say look

11824
03:43:06,469 --> 03:43:06,479
course why I would go back and say look
 

11825
03:43:06,479 --> 03:43:08,150
course why I would go back and say look
the only way you're going to fix this is

11826
03:43:08,150 --> 03:43:08,160
the only way you're going to fix this is
 

11827
03:43:08,160 --> 03:43:09,590
the only way you're going to fix this is
through Innovation because if you have

11828
03:43:09,590 --> 03:43:09,600
through Innovation because if you have
 

11829
03:43:09,600 --> 03:43:10,969
through Innovation because if you have
something that's cheaper than fossil

11830
03:43:10,969 --> 03:43:10,979
something that's cheaper than fossil
 

11831
03:43:10,979 --> 03:43:13,190
something that's cheaper than fossil
fuels you fixed it if you have something

11832
03:43:13,190 --> 03:43:13,200
fuels you fixed it if you have something
 

11833
03:43:13,200 --> 03:43:16,250
fuels you fixed it if you have something
that's harder and you know costlier and

11834
03:43:16,250 --> 03:43:16,260
that's harder and you know costlier and
 

11835
03:43:16,260 --> 03:43:18,229
that's harder and you know costlier and
more inconvenient no well you're just

11836
03:43:18,229 --> 03:43:18,239
more inconvenient no well you're just
 

11837
03:43:18,239 --> 03:43:20,630
more inconvenient no well you're just
not going to make it and getting more

11838
03:43:20,630 --> 03:43:20,640
not going to make it and getting more
 

11839
03:43:20,640 --> 03:43:23,929
not going to make it and getting more
time by cutting vulnerability yes the

11840
03:43:23,929 --> 03:43:23,939
time by cutting vulnerability yes the
 

11841
03:43:23,939 --> 03:43:25,370
time by cutting vulnerability yes the
pockets of vulnerability on the planet

11842
03:43:25,370 --> 03:43:25,380
pockets of vulnerability on the planet
 

11843
03:43:25,380 --> 03:43:27,229
pockets of vulnerability on the planet
are huge and they're identifiable and

11844
03:43:27,229 --> 03:43:27,239
are huge and they're identifiable and
 

11845
03:43:27,239 --> 03:43:29,330
are huge and they're identifiable and
you know what to do what are the biggest

11846
03:43:29,330 --> 03:43:29,340
you know what to do what are the biggest
 

11847

people are living and what their
 

11853
03:43:34,620 --> 03:43:37,309
people are living and what their

do you how do you decrease the

11856
03:43:38,990 --> 03:43:39,000
do you how do you decrease the
 

11857
03:43:39,000 --> 03:43:40,670
do you how do you decrease the
vulnerability in the world what are the

11858
03:43:40,670 --> 03:43:40,680
vulnerability in the world what are the
 

11859
03:43:40,680 --> 03:43:42,889
vulnerability in the world what are the
big affordable housing one reason so

11860
03:43:42,889 --> 03:43:42,899
big affordable housing one reason so
 

11861
03:43:42,899 --> 03:43:44,750
big affordable housing one reason so
many people moved out of San Francisco

11862
03:43:44,750 --> 03:43:44,760
many people moved out of San Francisco
 

11863
03:43:44,760 --> 03:43:47,330
many people moved out of San Francisco
and adjacent cities into the countryside

11864
03:43:47,330 --> 03:43:47,340
and adjacent cities into the countryside
 

11865
03:43:47,340 --> 03:43:49,849
and adjacent cities into the countryside
and then had their houses burned down

11866
03:43:49,849 --> 03:43:49,859
and then had their houses burned down
 

11867
03:43:49,859 --> 03:43:51,349
and then had their houses burned down
it's because they can't afford to live

11868
03:43:51,349 --> 03:43:51,359
it's because they can't afford to live
 

11869
03:43:51,359 --> 03:43:52,849
it's because they can't afford to live
in the city anymore

11870
03:43:52,849 --> 03:43:52,859
in the city anymore
 

11871
03:43:52,859 --> 03:43:55,490
in the city anymore
so affordable housing in cities can

11872
03:43:55,490 --> 03:43:55,500
so affordable housing in cities can
 

11873
03:43:55,500 --> 03:43:58,210
so affordable housing in cities can
limit exposure to in that case Wildfire

11874
03:43:58,210 --> 03:43:58,220
limit exposure to in that case Wildfire
 

11875
03:43:58,220 --> 03:44:00,650
limit exposure to in that case Wildfire

marginal places where a surge storm
 

11927
03:44:56,760 --> 03:45:00,290
marginal places where a surge storm
surge killed them so those are things we

surge killed them so those are things we
 

11929
03:45:00,300 --> 03:45:02,570
surge killed them so those are things we
we the whatever the we is in the

hiding behind this ex this climate
 

11951
03:45:22,560 --> 03:45:26,269
hiding behind this ex this climate
emergency label that that's really what

11952
03:45:26,269 --> 03:45:26,279
emergency label that that's really what
 

11953
03:45:26,279 --> 03:45:28,969
emergency label that that's really what
needs work and and also on the taco Bond

11954
03:45:28,969 --> 03:45:28,979
needs work and and also on the taco Bond

I mean the the hurricane that hit in

11956
03:45:31,130 --> 03:45:31,140
I mean the the hurricane that hit in
 

11957
03:45:31,140 --> 03:45:33,769
I mean the the hurricane that hit in
2013 there was almost a similar

11958
03:45:33,769 --> 03:45:33,779
2013 there was almost a similar
 

11959
03:45:33,779 --> 03:45:37,130
2013 there was almost a similar
hurricane in the early part of uh 1900s

11960
03:45:37,130 --> 03:45:37,140
hurricane in the early part of uh 1900s
 

11961
03:45:37,140 --> 03:45:39,530
hurricane in the early part of uh 1900s
that hit pretty much the same pretty

11962
03:45:39,530 --> 03:45:39,540
that hit pretty much the same pretty
 

11963
03:45:39,540 --> 03:45:41,809
that hit pretty much the same pretty
much the same strength and it eradicated

11964
03:45:41,809 --> 03:45:41,819
much the same strength and it eradicated
 

11965
03:45:41,819 --> 03:45:44,510
much the same strength and it eradicated
half the city it killed half the city uh

11966
03:45:44,510 --> 03:45:44,520
half the city it killed half the city uh
 

11967
03:45:44,520 --> 03:45:46,550
half the city it killed half the city uh
and so what's happened since then is you

11968
03:45:46,550 --> 03:45:46,560
and so what's happened since then is you
 

11969
03:45:46,560 --> 03:45:48,349
and so what's happened since then is you
know people just got much much richer

11970
03:45:48,349 --> 03:45:48,359
know people just got much much richer
 

11971
03:45:48,359 --> 03:45:52,429
know people just got much much richer
you know from early 1900 to 2013 we've

11972
03:45:52,429 --> 03:45:52,439
you know from early 1900 to 2013 we've
 

11973
03:45:52,439 --> 03:45:54,110
you know from early 1900 to 2013 we've
just moved a lot of people out of

11974
03:45:54,110 --> 03:45:54,120
just moved a lot of people out of
 

11975
03:45:54,120 --> 03:45:55,330
just moved a lot of people out of
poverty now

11976
03:45:55,330 --> 03:45:55,340
poverty now
 

11977
03:45:55,340 --> 03:45:58,070
poverty now
and yeah Bangladesh is even a bigger

11978
03:45:58,070 --> 03:45:58,080
and yeah Bangladesh is even a bigger
 

11979
03:45:58,080 --> 03:46:00,410
and yeah Bangladesh is even a bigger
example of that in the 1970s they had

11980
03:46:00,410 --> 03:46:00,420
example of that in the 1970s they had
 

11981
03:46:00,420 --> 03:46:02,090
example of that in the 1970s they had
horrible Cyclones one of which was the

11982
03:46:02,090 --> 03:46:02,100
horrible Cyclones one of which was the
 

11983
03:46:02,100 --> 03:46:03,950
horrible Cyclones one of which was the

of take the the uh the catastrophism out

12106
03:48:14,809 --> 03:48:14,819
of take the the uh the catastrophism out
 

12107
03:48:14,819 --> 03:48:17,990
of take the the uh the catastrophism out
of the uh of the climate conversation uh

12108
03:48:17,990 --> 03:48:18,000
of the uh of the climate conversation uh
 

12109
03:48:18,000 --> 03:48:19,670
of the uh of the climate conversation uh
and and you know this really matters

12110
03:48:19,670 --> 03:48:19,680
and and you know this really matters
 

12111
03:48:19,680 --> 03:48:22,130
and and you know this really matters
because a lot of kids literally think

12112
03:48:22,130 --> 03:48:22,140
because a lot of kids literally think
 

12113
03:48:22,140 --> 03:48:24,050
because a lot of kids literally think
that the world is going to end pretty

12114
03:48:24,050 --> 03:48:24,060
that the world is going to end pretty
 

12115
03:48:24,060 --> 03:48:26,450
that the world is going to end pretty
soon and that obviously makes any other

12116
03:48:26,450 --> 03:48:26,460
soon and that obviously makes any other
 

12117
03:48:26,460 --> 03:48:30,290
soon and that obviously makes any other
kind of plan uh uh uh uh meaningless so

12118
03:48:30,290 --> 03:48:30,300
kind of plan uh uh uh uh meaningless so
 

12119
03:48:30,300 --> 03:48:32,389
kind of plan uh uh uh uh meaningless so
first of all look you're not going to

12120
03:48:32,389 --> 03:48:32,399
first of all look you're not going to
 

12121
03:48:32,399 --> 03:48:35,090
first of all look you're not going to
die uh you know that that poster that

people that a lot of kids have you're

12124
03:48:37,309 --> 03:48:37,319
people that a lot of kids have you're
 

12125
03:48:37,319 --> 03:48:38,929
people that a lot of kids have you're
going to die from old age but I'm gonna

die much older very likely right so the

12132
03:48:46,130 --> 03:48:46,140
die much older very likely right so the
 

12133
03:48:46,140 --> 03:48:49,190
die much older very likely right so the
reality is the world is has improved

12134
03:48:49,190 --> 03:48:49,200
reality is the world is has improved
 

12135
03:48:49,200 --> 03:48:50,990
reality is the world is has improved
dramatically and it's very likely to

12136
03:48:50,990 --> 03:48:51,000
dramatically and it's very likely to
 

12137
03:48:51,000 --> 03:48:53,809
dramatically and it's very likely to
improve even more so the Baseline is

12138
03:48:53,809 --> 03:48:53,819
improve even more so the Baseline is
 

12139
03:48:53,819 --> 03:48:57,410
improve even more so the Baseline is
good this is just you know the facts

12140
03:48:57,410 --> 03:48:57,420
good this is just you know the facts
 

12141
03:48:57,420 --> 03:48:59,929
good this is just you know the facts
then there's still lots and lots of

you could become the guy that you know
develops fourth generation nuclear up

12162
03:49:21,889 --> 03:49:21,899
develops fourth generation nuclear up
 

12163
03:49:21,899 --> 03:49:24,530
develops fourth generation nuclear up
it's very likely something that neither

12164
03:49:24,530 --> 03:49:24,540
it's very likely something that neither
 

12165
03:49:24,540 --> 03:49:26,450
it's very likely something that neither
of us know anything about right now but

of us know anything about right now but
 

12167
03:49:26,460 --> 03:49:28,550
of us know anything about right now but
develop that you know the energy source

12168
03:49:28,550 --> 03:49:28,560
develop that you know the energy source
 

12169
03:49:28,560 --> 03:49:30,050
develop that you know the energy source
they'll basically power the rest of

03:54:50,210 --> 03:54:50,220
take time then you have to sort of find
 

12465
03:54:50,220 --> 03:54:52,370
take time then you have to sort of find
patience or whatever your word is for

12466
03:54:52,370 --> 03:54:52,380
patience or whatever your word is for
 

12467
03:54:52,380 --> 03:54:53,090
patience or whatever your word is for
that

12468
03:54:53,090 --> 03:54:53,100
that
 

12469
03:54:53,100 --> 03:54:55,010
that
yeah I think you have to oscillate back

12470
03:54:55,010 --> 03:54:55,020
yeah I think you have to oscillate back
 

12471
03:54:55,020 --> 03:54:57,170
yeah I think you have to oscillate back
and forth throughout the day having a

12472
03:54:57,170 --> 03:54:57,180
and forth throughout the day having a
 

12473
03:54:57,180 --> 03:54:58,790
and forth throughout the day having a
sense of urgency when you're trying to

12474
03:54:58,790 --> 03:54:58,800
sense of urgency when you're trying to
 

12475
03:54:58,800 --> 03:55:02,269
sense of urgency when you're trying to
actually be productive and a patience so

12476
03:55:02,269 --> 03:55:02,279
actually be productive and a patience so
 

12477
03:55:02,279 --> 03:55:04,010
actually be productive and a patience so
you can have a calm Header by you in

12478
03:55:04,010 --> 03:55:04,020
you can have a calm Header by you in
 

12479
03:55:04,020 --> 03:55:04,910
you can have a calm Header by you in
terms of putting everything into

12480
03:55:04,910 --> 03:55:04,920
terms of putting everything into
 

12481
03:55:04,920 --> 03:55:07,429
terms of putting everything into
perspective yeah and like you said with

12482
03:55:07,429 --> 03:55:07,439
perspective yeah and like you said with
 

12483
03:55:07,439 --> 03:55:08,990
perspective yeah and like you said with
information

12484
03:55:08,990 --> 03:55:09,000
information
 

12485
03:55:09,000 --> 03:55:11,269
information
that is interesting especially in the

12486
03:55:11,269 --> 03:55:11,279
that is interesting especially in the
 

12487
03:55:11,279 --> 03:55:12,410
that is interesting especially in the
scientific Community I think you've

12488
03:55:12,410 --> 03:55:12,420
scientific Community I think you've
 

12489
03:55:12,420 --> 03:55:14,450
scientific Community I think you've
spoken about this before

12490
03:55:14,450 --> 03:55:14,460
spoken about this before
 

12491
03:55:14,460 --> 03:55:15,889
spoken about this before
you know that there is some

12492
03:55:15,889 --> 03:55:15,899
you know that there is some
 

12493
03:55:15,899 --> 03:55:17,330
you know that there is some
responsibility or at least an

12494
03:55:17,330 --> 03:55:17,340
responsibility or at least an
 

12495
03:55:17,340 --> 03:55:20,030
responsibility or at least an
opportunity for scientists to not just

12496
03:55:20,030 --> 03:55:20,040
opportunity for scientists to not just
 

12497
03:55:20,040 --> 03:55:21,710
opportunity for scientists to not just
do science but to understand the

12498
03:55:21,710 --> 03:55:21,720
do science but to understand the
 

12499
03:55:21,720 --> 03:55:23,090
do science but to understand the
Dynamics of

12500
03:55:23,090 --> 03:55:23,100
Dynamics of
 

12501
03:55:23,100 --> 03:55:24,590
Dynamics of
the different mediums in which

12502
03:55:24,590 --> 03:55:24,600
the different mediums in which
 

12503
03:55:24,600 --> 03:55:26,389
the different mediums in which
information is exchanged so it could be

12504
03:55:26,389 --> 03:55:26,399
information is exchanged so it could be
 

12505
03:55:26,399 --> 03:55:28,610
information is exchanged so it could be
Twitter for a few years then it could be

12506
03:55:28,610 --> 03:55:28,620
Twitter for a few years then it could be
 

12507
03:55:28,620 --> 03:55:31,610
Twitter for a few years then it could be
Tick Tock then it could be you know I'm

12508
03:55:31,610 --> 03:55:31,620
Tick Tock then it could be you know I'm
 

12509
03:55:31,620 --> 03:55:34,729
Tick Tock then it could be you know I'm
a huge believer in the power of YouTube

12510
03:55:34,729 --> 03:55:34,739
a huge believer in the power of YouTube
 

12511
03:55:34,739 --> 03:55:37,189
a huge believer in the power of YouTube
over the next

12512
03:55:37,189 --> 03:55:37,199
over the next
 

12513
03:55:37,199 --> 03:55:39,410
over the next
several years perhaps decades I mean

12514
03:55:39,410 --> 03:55:39,420
several years perhaps decades I mean
 

12515
03:55:39,420 --> 03:55:41,210
several years perhaps decades I mean
it's a very interesting medium for

12516
03:55:41,210 --> 03:55:41,220
it's a very interesting medium for
 

12517
03:55:41,220 --> 03:55:44,750
it's a very interesting medium for
education and communication for debate

12518
03:55:44,750 --> 03:55:44,760
education and communication for debate
 

12519
03:55:44,760 --> 03:55:47,330
education and communication for debate
and that's Grassroots that's from like

12520
03:55:47,330 --> 03:55:47,340
and that's Grassroots that's from like
 

12521
03:55:47,340 --> 03:55:49,910
and that's Grassroots that's from like
the bottom up you know that that every

12522
03:55:49,910 --> 03:55:49,920
the bottom up you know that that every
 

12523
03:55:49,920 --> 03:55:52,189
the bottom up you know that that every
scientist is able to communicate their

12524
03:55:52,189 --> 03:55:52,199
scientist is able to communicate their
 

12525
03:55:52,199 --> 03:55:54,349
scientist is able to communicate their
work and I I personally believe have the

12526
03:55:54,349 --> 03:55:54,359
work and I I personally believe have the
 

12527
03:55:54,359 --> 03:55:57,110
work and I I personally believe have the
responsibility to communicate that work

12528
03:55:57,110 --> 03:55:57,120
responsibility to communicate that work
 

12529
03:55:57,120 --> 03:56:00,229
responsibility to communicate that work
if anything the internet made me realize

12530
03:56:00,229 --> 03:56:00,239
if anything the internet made me realize
 

12531
03:56:00,239 --> 03:56:03,530
if anything the internet made me realize
the science is not just about

12532
03:56:03,530 --> 03:56:03,540
the science is not just about
 

12533
03:56:03,540 --> 03:56:05,150
the science is not just about
doing the science it's about

12534
03:56:05,150 --> 03:56:05,160
doing the science it's about
 

12535
03:56:05,160 --> 03:56:07,189
doing the science it's about
communicating it

12536
03:56:07,189 --> 03:56:07,199
communicating it
 

12537
03:56:07,199 --> 03:56:09,349
communicating it
like that this is not some kind of

12538
03:56:09,349 --> 03:56:09,359
like that this is not some kind of
 

12539
03:56:09,359 --> 03:56:11,870
like that this is not some kind of
virtue signaling on my part no no no

12540
03:56:11,870 --> 03:56:11,880
virtue signaling on my part no no no
 

12541
03:56:11,880 --> 03:56:15,229
virtue signaling on my part no no no
like I feel like if the tree falls in

12542
03:56:15,229 --> 03:56:15,239
like I feel like if the tree falls in
 

12543
03:56:15,239 --> 03:56:17,090
like I feel like if the tree falls in
the forest and nobody's around to hear

12544
03:56:17,090 --> 03:56:17,100
the forest and nobody's around to hear
 

12545
03:56:17,100 --> 03:56:19,309
the forest and nobody's around to hear
it it really didn't fall

12546
03:56:19,309 --> 03:56:19,319
it it really didn't fall
 

12547
03:56:19,319 --> 03:56:21,530
it it really didn't fall
like that's not you should there should

12548
03:56:21,530 --> 03:56:21,540
like that's not you should there should
 

12549
03:56:21,540 --> 03:56:23,809
like that's not you should there should
be a culture of

12550
03:56:23,809 --> 03:56:23,819
be a culture of
 

12551
03:56:23,819 --> 03:56:25,910
be a culture of
um whoever at MIT

12552
03:56:25,910 --> 03:56:25,920
um whoever at MIT
 

12553
03:56:25,920 --> 03:56:28,490
um whoever at MIT
is a place called the media lab yes sir

12554
03:56:28,490 --> 03:56:28,500
is a place called the media lab yes sir
 

12555
03:56:28,500 --> 03:56:32,269
is a place called the media lab yes sir
where they really emphasize

12556
03:56:32,269 --> 03:56:32,279
where they really emphasize
 

12557
03:56:32,279 --> 03:56:34,849
where they really emphasize
uh like you always be able to demo

12558
03:56:34,849 --> 03:56:34,859
uh like you always be able to demo
 

12559
03:56:34,859 --> 03:56:36,290
uh like you always be able to demo
something to show off your work they

12560
03:56:36,290 --> 03:56:36,300
something to show off your work they
 

12561
03:56:36,300 --> 03:56:37,610
something to show off your work they
really emphasize showing off their work

12562
03:56:37,610 --> 03:56:37,620
really emphasize showing off their work
 

12563
03:56:37,620 --> 03:56:40,189
really emphasize showing off their work
and I think that was in some part

12564
03:56:40,189 --> 03:56:40,199
and I think that was in some part
 

12565
03:56:40,199 --> 03:56:42,410
and I think that was in some part
criticized in the bigger MIT culture

12566
03:56:42,410 --> 03:56:42,420
criticized in the bigger MIT culture
 

12567
03:56:42,420 --> 03:56:43,370
criticized in the bigger MIT culture
that

12568
03:56:43,370 --> 03:56:43,380
that
 

12569
03:56:43,380 --> 03:56:45,950
that
you know that's that's like being

12570
03:56:45,950 --> 03:56:45,960
you know that's that's like being
 

12571
03:56:45,960 --> 03:56:47,870
you know that's that's like being
focusing too much on the pr versus doing

12572
03:56:47,870 --> 03:56:47,880
focusing too much on the pr versus doing
 

12573
03:56:47,880 --> 03:56:50,450
focusing too much on the pr versus doing
the science but I really disagree with

12574
03:56:50,450 --> 03:56:50,460
the science but I really disagree with
 

12575
03:56:50,460 --> 03:56:51,710
the science but I really disagree with
that of course there's a balance to

12576
03:56:51,710 --> 03:56:51,720
that of course there's a balance to
 

12577
03:56:51,720 --> 03:56:53,630
that of course there's a balance to
strike you don't want to be all smoke

12578
03:56:53,630 --> 03:56:53,640
strike you don't want to be all smoke
 

12579
03:56:53,640 --> 03:56:56,210
strike you don't want to be all smoke
and mirrors but there really is a lot of

12580
03:56:56,210 --> 03:56:56,220
and mirrors but there really is a lot of
 

12581
03:56:56,220 --> 03:56:59,750
and mirrors but there really is a lot of
value to communication and not just sort

12582
03:56:59,750 --> 03:56:59,760
value to communication and not just sort
 

12583
03:56:59,760 --> 03:57:02,630
value to communication and not just sort
of some broad you almost don't want to

12584
03:57:02,630 --> 03:57:02,640
of some broad you almost don't want to
 

12585
03:57:02,640 --> 03:57:04,670
of some broad you almost don't want to
teach a course on communication Because

12586
03:57:04,670 --> 03:57:04,680
teach a course on communication Because
 

12587
03:57:04,680 --> 03:57:06,530
teach a course on communication Because
by the time you teach the course at 38

12588
03:57:06,530 --> 03:57:06,540
by the time you teach the course at 38
 

12589
03:57:06,540 --> 03:57:09,550
by the time you teach the course at 38
too late it's always being on top of

12590
03:57:09,550 --> 03:57:09,560
too late it's always being on top of
 

12591
03:57:09,560 --> 03:57:12,830
too late it's always being on top of
how what is the language what is the

12592
03:57:12,830 --> 03:57:12,840
how what is the language what is the
 

12593
03:57:12,840 --> 03:57:14,870
how what is the language what is the

03:57:14,870 --> 03:57:14,880
culture and the etiquette what is the
 

12595
03:57:14,880 --> 03:57:16,969

technology of communication that is

12596
03:57:16,969 --> 03:57:16,979
technology of communication that is
 

12597
03:57:16,979 --> 03:57:19,790
technology of communication that is
effective yeah I actually had a big

12598
03:57:19,790 --> 03:57:19,800
effective yeah I actually had a big
 

12599
03:57:19,800 --> 03:57:21,590
effective yeah I actually had a big
conversation about that in my my

12600
03:57:21,590 --> 03:57:21,600
conversation about that in my my
 

12601
03:57:21,600 --> 03:57:23,630
conversation about that in my my
University because I think and this is

12602
03:57:23,630 --> 03:57:23,640
University because I think and this is
 

12603
03:57:23,640 --> 03:57:25,729
University because I think and this is
perhaps especially true for for social

12604
03:57:25,729 --> 03:57:25,739
perhaps especially true for for social
 

12605
03:57:25,739 --> 03:57:27,290
perhaps especially true for for social
sciences but I think it's probably true

12606
03:57:27,290 --> 03:57:27,300
sciences but I think it's probably true
 

12607
03:57:27,300 --> 03:57:29,090
sciences but I think it's probably true
for everyone uh just simply

12608
03:57:29,090 --> 03:57:29,100
for everyone uh just simply
 

12609
03:57:29,100 --> 03:57:30,889
for everyone uh just simply
communicating what it is that you've

12610
03:57:30,889 --> 03:57:30,899
communicating what it is that you've
 

12611
03:57:30,899 --> 03:57:32,929
communicating what it is that you've
done in research makes it possible for

12612
03:57:32,929 --> 03:57:32,939
done in research makes it possible for
 

12613
03:57:32,939 --> 03:57:34,309
done in research makes it possible for
you to sort of get an outsider's

12614
03:57:34,309 --> 03:57:34,319
you to sort of get an outsider's
 

12615
03:57:34,319 --> 03:57:36,469
you to sort of get an outsider's
perspective and see did I just go into

12616
03:57:36,469 --> 03:57:36,479
perspective and see did I just go into
 

12617
03:57:36,479 --> 03:57:38,990
perspective and see did I just go into
an incredibly deep uh you know whole

12618
03:57:38,990 --> 03:57:39,000
an incredibly deep uh you know whole
 

12619
03:57:39,000 --> 03:57:40,729
an incredibly deep uh you know whole

necessarily true but it's probably
 

12637
03:57:57,180 --> 03:57:58,969
necessarily true but it's probably
because it wasn't all that important

and this some someone has to dig in on

12800
04:00:55,490 --> 04:00:55,500
and this some someone has to dig in on
 

12801

me ask the big question what do you
think is the the why of it all

12830

think is the the why of it all
 

12831
04:01:27,779 --> 04:01:29,809
think is the the why of it all
what's the meaning of it what's the

12832
04:01:29,809 --> 04:01:29,819
what's the meaning of it what's the
 

12833
04:01:29,819 --> 04:01:33,429
what's the meaning of it what's the
meaning of our life here on Earth

12834
04:01:33,429 --> 04:01:33,439

 

12835
04:01:33,439 --> 04:01:36,530

you you waited till the last moment to

12836

you you waited till the last moment to
 

12837
04:01:36,540 --> 04:01:39,349
you you waited till the last moment to
ask us that question yes yes in case

12838
04:01:39,349 --> 04:01:39,359
ask us that question yes yes in case
 

12839
04:01:39,359 --> 04:01:40,150
ask us that question yes yes in case
there's

12840
04:01:40,150 --> 04:01:40,160
there's
 

12841

uh yeah in case in case I can trick you
into finding an answer

12844
04:01:46,010 --> 04:01:46,020
into finding an answer
 

12845
04:01:46,020 --> 04:01:48,830
into finding an answer
well so I mean again I'm just going to

12846
04:01:48,830 --> 04:01:48,840
well so I mean again I'm just going to
 

12847
04:01:48,840 --> 04:01:51,349
well so I mean again I'm just going to
take a stab in this because uh I think

12848
04:01:51,349 --> 04:01:51,359
take a stab in this because uh I think
 

12849
04:01:51,359 --> 04:01:54,349
take a stab in this because uh I think
in some ways it's um it's the same thing

12850
04:01:54,349 --> 04:01:54,359
in some ways it's um it's the same thing
 

12851
04:01:54,359 --> 04:01:55,849
in some ways it's um it's the same thing
that you were talking about before it's

12852
04:01:55,849 --> 04:01:55,859
that you were talking about before it's
 

12853
04:01:55,859 --> 04:01:57,590
that you were talking about before it's
not about getting everybody sort of on

12854
04:01:57,590 --> 04:01:57,600
not about getting everybody sort of on
 

12855
04:01:57,600 --> 04:01:59,870
not about getting everybody sort of on
the same track and all agree on

12856
04:01:59,870 --> 04:01:59,880
the same track and all agree on
 

12857
04:01:59,880 --> 04:02:01,910
the same track and all agree on
something but it's about getting a lot

12858
04:02:01,910 --> 04:02:01,920
something but it's about getting a lot
 

12859
04:02:01,920 --> 04:02:03,830
something but it's about getting a lot
of people with very different you know

12860
04:02:03,830 --> 04:02:03,840
of people with very different you know
 

12861
04:02:03,840 --> 04:02:06,410
of people with very different you know
uh goals and targets and ways of

12862
04:02:06,410 --> 04:02:06,420
uh goals and targets and ways of
 

12863
04:02:06,420 --> 04:02:08,929
uh goals and targets and ways of
thinking about the world to go in the

12864
04:02:08,929 --> 04:02:08,939
thinking about the world to go in the
 

12865
04:02:08,939 --> 04:02:12,170
thinking about the world to go in the
same direction so for me the goal of

12866
04:02:12,170 --> 04:02:12,180
same direction so for me the goal of
 

12867
04:02:12,180 --> 04:02:15,530
same direction so for me the goal of
Life certainly Michael but I think for

12868
04:02:15,530 --> 04:02:15,540
Life certainly Michael but I think for
 

12869
04:02:15,540 --> 04:02:17,870
Life certainly Michael but I think for
for most people is to make the world a

12870
04:02:17,870 --> 04:02:17,880
for most people is to make the world a
 

12871
04:02:17,880 --> 04:02:20,450
for most people is to make the world a
better place it sounds incredibly

12872
04:02:20,450 --> 04:02:20,460
better place it sounds incredibly
 

12873
04:02:20,460 --> 04:02:22,130
better place it sounds incredibly
pedestrian because it becomes so

12874
04:02:22,130 --> 04:02:22,140
pedestrian because it becomes so
 

12875
04:02:22,140 --> 04:02:24,170
pedestrian because it becomes so
overused but that really and literally

12876
04:02:24,170 --> 04:02:24,180
overused but that really and literally
 

12877
04:02:24,180 --> 04:02:27,170
overused but that really and literally
is the point you you know your point of

12878
04:02:27,170 --> 04:02:27,180
is the point you you know your point of
 

12879
04:02:27,180 --> 04:02:29,269
is the point you you know your point of
your life is to you know when when one

12880
04:02:29,269 --> 04:02:29,279
your life is to you know when when one
 

12881
04:02:29,279 --> 04:02:31,729

12885
04:02:33,300 --> 04:02:35,510
that they sort of get out of that and
and find out why they're sad and maybe

12886
04:02:35,510 --> 04:02:35,520
and find out why they're sad and maybe
 

12887
04:02:35,520 --> 04:02:36,830
and find out why they're sad and maybe
move them a little bit in the right

12888
04:02:36,830 --> 04:02:36,840
move them a little bit in the right
 

12889
04:02:36,840 --> 04:02:39,349
move them a little bit in the right
direction and you know and and all the

12890
04:02:39,349 --> 04:02:39,359
direction and you know and and all the
 

12891

direction and you know and and all the
things that we've talked about you know

12892
04:02:40,790 --> 04:02:40,800
things that we've talked about you know
 

12893
04:02:40,800 --> 04:02:43,189
things that we've talked about you know
stop people from dying from tuberculosis

12894
04:02:43,189 --> 04:02:43,199
stop people from dying from tuberculosis
 

12895
04:02:43,199 --> 04:02:45,530
stop people from dying from tuberculosis
and live longer lives and fix climate

12896
04:02:45,530 --> 04:02:45,540
and live longer lives and fix climate
 

12897
04:02:45,540 --> 04:02:48,349
and live longer lives and fix climate
change but fix it in such a way

12898
04:02:48,349 --> 04:02:48,359
change but fix it in such a way
 

12899
04:02:48,359 --> 04:02:50,929
change but fix it in such a way
that we actually use resources smartest

12900
04:02:50,929 --> 04:02:50,939
that we actually use resources smartest
 

12901
04:02:50,939 --> 04:02:52,429
that we actually use resources smartest
because there are lots of problems so

12902
04:02:52,429 --> 04:02:52,439
because there are lots of problems so
 

12903
04:02:52,439 --> 04:02:54,950
because there are lots of problems so
let's make sure we you know we we deal

12904
04:02:54,950 --> 04:02:54,960
let's make sure we you know we we deal
 

12905
04:02:54,960 --> 04:02:57,170

with them adequately this is this is

12906
04:02:57,170 --> 04:02:57,180
with them adequately this is this is
 

12907
04:02:57,180 --> 04:03:00,170
with them adequately this is this is
very unsexy in some sense uh but I think

12908
04:03:00,170 --> 04:03:00,180
very unsexy in some sense uh but I think
 

12909
04:03:00,180 --> 04:03:02,630
very unsexy in some sense uh but I think
it's also very basic and really what it

12910
04:03:02,630 --> 04:03:02,640
it's also very basic and really what it
 

12911
04:03:02,640 --> 04:03:06,229
it's also very basic and really what it
matters well you know biologically

12912
04:03:06,229 --> 04:03:06,239
matters well you know biologically
 

12913
04:03:06,239 --> 04:03:10,250

12916
04:03:12,650 --> 04:03:12,660
about finding sources of energy
 

12917
04:03:12,660 --> 04:03:15,110
about finding sources of energy
and perpetuating yourself right so

12918
04:03:15,110 --> 04:03:15,120
and perpetuating yourself right so
 

12919
04:03:15,120 --> 04:03:16,910
and perpetuating yourself right so
that's the Baseline

12920
04:03:16,910 --> 04:03:16,920
that's the Baseline
 

12921
04:03:16,920 --> 04:03:19,189
that's the Baseline
and that's led us into a bit of a

12922
04:03:19,189 --> 04:03:19,199
and that's led us into a bit of a
 

12923
04:03:19,199 --> 04:03:21,769
and that's led us into a bit of a
bollocks because we have this easy

12924
04:03:21,769 --> 04:03:21,779
bollocks because we have this easy
 

12925
04:03:21,779 --> 04:03:23,750
bollocks because we have this easy

12927
04:03:23,760 --> 04:03:25,309
energy that's come from the ground so
far and

12928
04:03:25,309 --> 04:03:25,319

whatever is I don't know that's the
 

13085
04:06:04,080 --> 04:06:06,170
whatever is I don't know that's the
giving that's the Letting Go part

13086
04:06:06,170 --> 04:06:06,180
giving that's the Letting Go part
 

13087
04:06:06,180 --> 04:06:08,870
giving that's the Letting Go part
even if one did something special then

13088
04:06:08,870 --> 04:06:08,880
even if one did something special then
 

13089
04:06:08,880 --> 04:06:11,210
even if one did something special then
that makes me feel job done

13090
04:06:11,210 --> 04:06:11,220
that makes me feel job done
 

13091
04:06:11,220 --> 04:06:12,950
that makes me feel job done
and you know

13092
04:06:12,950 --> 04:06:12,960
and you know
 

13093
04:06:12,960 --> 04:06:14,269
and you know
when I after I've been writing about

13094
04:06:14,269 --> 04:06:14,279
when I after I've been writing about
 

13095
04:06:14,279 --> 04:06:15,670
when I after I've been writing about
climate for 30 years

13096
04:06:15,670 --> 04:06:15,680
climate for 30 years
 

13097
04:06:15,680 --> 04:06:18,530
climate for 30 years
2016-ish I

13098
04:06:18,530 --> 04:06:18,540
2016-ish I
 

13099
04:06:18,540 --> 04:06:20,750
2016-ish I
did a lot of writing about what did I

13100
04:06:20,750 --> 04:06:20,760
did a lot of writing about what did I
 

13101
04:06:20,760 --> 04:06:23,090
did a lot of writing about what did I
learn unlearned and stuff and I had had

13102
04:06:23,090 --> 04:06:23,100
learn unlearned and stuff and I had had
 

13103
04:06:23,100 --> 04:06:25,910
learn unlearned and stuff and I had had
a stroke in 2011. which is interesting

13104
04:06:25,910 --> 04:06:25,920
a stroke in 2011. which is interesting
 

13105
04:06:25,920 --> 04:06:28,070
a stroke in 2011. which is interesting
it was the first time I really thought

13106
04:06:28,070 --> 04:06:28,080
it was the first time I really thought
 

13107
04:06:28,080 --> 04:06:29,809
it was the first time I really thought
about my brain

13108
04:06:29,809 --> 04:06:29,819
about my brain
 

13109
04:06:29,819 --> 04:06:31,550
about my brain
you don't think about your brain on a

13110
04:06:31,550 --> 04:06:31,560
you don't think about your brain on a
 

13111
04:06:31,560 --> 04:06:33,710
you don't think about your brain on a
day-to-day basis but this is my brain

13112
04:06:33,710 --> 04:06:33,720
day-to-day basis but this is my brain
 

13113
04:06:33,720 --> 04:06:35,809
day-to-day basis but this is my brain
telling me you know ding ding ding ding

13114
04:06:35,809 --> 04:06:35,819
telling me you know ding ding ding ding
 

13115
04:06:35,819 --> 04:06:37,790
telling me you know ding ding ding ding
some weird shit's happening

13116
04:06:37,790 --> 04:06:37,800
some weird shit's happening
 

13117
04:06:37,800 --> 04:06:40,189
some weird shit's happening
and when I was thinking about climate or

13118
04:06:40,189 --> 04:06:40,199
and when I was thinking about climate or
 

13119
04:06:40,199 --> 04:06:41,450
and when I was thinking about climate or
confronting climate change it felt like

13120
04:06:41,450 --> 04:06:41,460
confronting climate change it felt like
 

13121
04:06:41,460 --> 04:06:42,889
confronting climate change it felt like
some of the things I learned about my

13122
04:06:42,889 --> 04:06:42,899
some of the things I learned about my
 

13123
04:06:42,899 --> 04:06:45,530
some of the things I learned about my
own existence you know I'm going to die

13124
04:06:45,530 --> 04:06:45,540
own existence you know I'm going to die
 

13125
04:06:45,540 --> 04:06:48,469
own existence you know I'm going to die
but you don't really absorb that is that

13126
04:06:48,469 --> 04:06:48,479
but you don't really absorb that is that
 

13127
04:06:48,479 --> 04:06:50,090
but you don't really absorb that is that
the first time you kind of that was like

13128
04:06:50,090 --> 04:06:50,100
the first time you kind of that was like
 

13129
04:06:50,100 --> 04:06:53,330
the first time you kind of that was like
my face yeah this is really the [\h__\h] you

13130
04:06:53,330 --> 04:06:53,340
my face yeah this is really the [\h__\h] you
 

13131
04:06:53,340 --> 04:06:55,250
my face yeah this is really the [\h__\h] you
know or at least deep disability if not

13132
04:06:55,250 --> 04:06:55,260
know or at least deep disability if not
 

13133
04:06:55,260 --> 04:06:56,809
know or at least deep disability if not
death and

13134
04:06:56,809 --> 04:06:56,819
death and
 

13135
04:06:56,819 --> 04:07:00,349
death and
um that that ability is transitory and I

13136
04:07:00,349 --> 04:07:00,359
um that that ability is transitory and I
 

13137
04:07:00,359 --> 04:07:01,910
um that that ability is transitory and I
thought about the climate problem we're

13138
04:07:01,910 --> 04:07:01,920
thought about the climate problem we're
 

13139
04:07:01,920 --> 04:07:03,469
thought about the climate problem we're
not going to solve the global warming

13140
04:07:03,469 --> 04:07:03,479
not going to solve the global warming
 

13141
04:07:03,479 --> 04:07:04,910
not going to solve the global warming
problem at least not in our lifetimes

13142
04:07:04,910 --> 04:07:04,920
problem at least not in our lifetimes
 

13143
04:07:04,920 --> 04:07:08,389
problem at least not in our lifetimes
but you you work on making

13144
04:07:08,389 --> 04:07:08,399
but you you work on making
 

13145
04:07:08,399 --> 04:07:11,750
but you you work on making
those trajectories sustainable you know

13146
04:07:11,750 --> 04:07:11,760
those trajectories sustainable you know
 

13147
04:07:11,760 --> 04:07:14,210
those trajectories sustainable you know
the end of life particularly you work on

13148
04:07:14,210 --> 04:07:14,220
the end of life particularly you work on
 

13149
04:07:14,220 --> 04:07:16,130
the end of life particularly you work on
making sure other people don't get

13150
04:07:16,130 --> 04:07:16,140
making sure other people don't get
 

13151
04:07:16,140 --> 04:07:17,929
making sure other people don't get
strokes if they can avoid it in my case

13152
04:07:17,929 --> 04:07:17,939
strokes if they can avoid it in my case
 

13153
04:07:17,939 --> 04:07:19,969
strokes if they can avoid it in my case
I wrote about I was blogging about my

13154
04:07:19,969 --> 04:07:19,979
I wrote about I was blogging about my
 

13155
04:07:19,979 --> 04:07:22,189
I wrote about I was blogging about my
stroke while I was having it I was

13156
04:07:22,189 --> 04:07:22,199
stroke while I was having it I was
 

13157
04:07:22,199 --> 04:07:23,630
stroke while I was having it I was
tweeting about it there's a funny tweet

13158
04:07:23,630 --> 04:07:23,640
tweeting about it there's a funny tweet
 

13159
04:07:23,640 --> 04:07:26,689
tweeting about it there's a funny tweet
that's kind of mistyped because

13160
04:07:26,689 --> 04:07:26,699
that's kind of mistyped because
 

13161
04:07:26,699 --> 04:07:28,269
that's kind of mistyped because
um you know um

13162
04:07:28,269 --> 04:07:28,279
um you know um
 

13163
04:07:28,279 --> 04:07:31,790
um you know um
yeah yeah right right so so if you so

13164
04:07:31,790 --> 04:07:31,800
yeah yeah right right so so if you so
 

13165
04:07:31,800 --> 04:07:33,229
yeah yeah right right so so if you so
that's like share your knowledge share

13166
04:07:33,229 --> 04:07:33,239
that's like share your knowledge share
 

13167
04:07:33,239 --> 04:07:35,389
that's like share your knowledge share
your learning and everyone can do this

13168
04:07:35,389 --> 04:07:35,399
your learning and everyone can do this
 

13169
04:07:35,399 --> 04:07:38,510
your learning and everyone can do this
now like on whatever platform and then

um
 

13173
04:07:39,120 --> 04:07:41,510
um
there's also this like giving up part

13174
04:07:41,510 --> 04:07:41,520
there's also this like giving up part
 

13175
04:07:41,520 --> 04:07:44,630
there's also this like giving up part
but not in a depressing well maybe you

13176
04:07:44,630 --> 04:07:44,640
but not in a depressing well maybe you
 

13177
04:07:44,640 --> 04:07:46,849
but not in a depressing well maybe you
could call depressing I started to zoom

13178
04:07:46,849 --> 04:07:46,859
could call depressing I started to zoom
 

13179
04:07:46,859 --> 04:07:48,650
could call depressing I started to zoom
in years ago and the idea of the

13180
04:07:48,650 --> 04:07:48,660
in years ago and the idea of the
 

13181
04:07:48,660 --> 04:07:50,870
in years ago and the idea of the
Serenity Prayer the sobriety thing you

13182
04:07:50,870 --> 04:07:50,880
Serenity Prayer the sobriety thing you
 

13183
04:07:50,880 --> 04:07:52,790
Serenity Prayer the sobriety thing you
know it's like know what you can change

13184
04:07:52,790 --> 04:07:52,800
know it's like know what you can change
 

13185
04:07:52,800 --> 04:07:55,370
know it's like know what you can change
know what you can't grab me the serenity

13186
04:07:55,370 --> 04:07:55,380
know what you can't grab me the serenity
 

13187
04:07:55,380 --> 04:07:57,410
know what you can't grab me the serenity
to accept the things that cannot change

13188
04:07:57,410 --> 04:07:57,420
to accept the things that cannot change
 

13189
04:07:57,420 --> 04:07:59,389
to accept the things that cannot change
the courage to change the things that

13190
04:07:59,389 --> 04:07:59,399
the courage to change the things that
 

13191
04:07:59,399 --> 04:08:02,090
the courage to change the things that
can and the wisdom to know the

13192
04:08:02,090 --> 04:08:02,100
can and the wisdom to know the
 

13193
04:08:02,100 --> 04:08:03,830
can and the wisdom to know the
difference yeah see those three

13194
04:08:03,830 --> 04:08:03,840
difference yeah see those three
 

13195
04:08:03,840 --> 04:08:05,510
difference yeah see those three
properties are really important right

13196
04:08:05,510 --> 04:08:05,520
properties are really important right
 

13197
04:08:05,520 --> 04:08:06,469
properties are really important right
now

13198
04:08:06,469 --> 04:08:06,479
now
 

13199
04:08:06,479 --> 04:08:08,689
now
some aspects of this we know absolutely

13200
04:08:08,689 --> 04:08:08,699
some aspects of this we know absolutely
 

13201
04:08:08,699 --> 04:08:10,309
some aspects of this we know absolutely
what we can work on cutting

13202
04:08:10,309 --> 04:08:10,319
what we can work on cutting
 

13203
04:08:10,319 --> 04:08:11,330
what we can work on cutting
vulnerability

13204
04:08:11,330 --> 04:08:11,340
vulnerability
 

13205
04:08:11,340 --> 04:08:14,630
vulnerability
energy transitions take time science can

13206
04:08:14,630 --> 04:08:14,640
energy transitions take time science can
 

13207
04:08:14,640 --> 04:08:17,450
energy transitions take time science can
help us discriminate the difference

13208
04:08:17,450 --> 04:08:17,460
help us discriminate the difference
 

13209
04:08:17,460 --> 04:08:19,370
help us discriminate the difference
and that's an iterative changing

13210
04:08:19,370 --> 04:08:19,380
and that's an iterative changing
 

13211
04:08:19,380 --> 04:08:22,189
and that's an iterative changing
landscape going forward

13212
04:08:22,189 --> 04:08:22,199
landscape going forward
 

13213
04:08:22,199 --> 04:08:24,590
landscape going forward
but at the same time

13214
04:08:24,590 --> 04:08:24,600
but at the same time
 

13215
04:08:24,600 --> 04:08:26,269
but at the same time
science

13216
04:08:26,269 --> 04:08:26,279
science
 

13217
04:08:26,279 --> 04:08:29,090
science
like I personally on climate modeling or

13218
04:08:29,090 --> 04:08:29,100
like I personally on climate modeling or
 

13219
04:08:29,100 --> 04:08:31,130
like I personally on climate modeling or
like narrowing how hot it's going to get

13220
04:08:31,130 --> 04:08:31,140
like narrowing how hot it's going to get
 

13221
04:08:31,140 --> 04:08:33,889
like narrowing how hot it's going to get
or more clarity on

13222
04:08:33,889 --> 04:08:33,899
or more clarity on
 

13223
04:08:33,899 --> 04:08:36,290
or more clarity on
when an ice sheet is going to collapse I

13224
04:08:36,290 --> 04:08:36,300
when an ice sheet is going to collapse I
 

13225
04:08:36,300 --> 04:08:37,670
when an ice sheet is going to collapse I
think those are what I call known and

13226
04:08:37,670 --> 04:08:37,680
think those are what I call known and
 

13227
04:08:37,680 --> 04:08:39,469
think those are what I call known and
Nobles so being able to

13228
04:08:39,469 --> 04:08:39,479
Nobles so being able to
 

13229
04:08:39,479 --> 04:08:41,229
Nobles so being able to
I've seen enough evidence

13230
04:08:41,229 --> 04:08:41,239
I've seen enough evidence
 

13231
04:08:41,239 --> 04:08:44,269
I've seen enough evidence
that those are deeply complex problems

13232
04:08:44,269 --> 04:08:44,279
that those are deeply complex problems
 

13233
04:08:44,279 --> 04:08:44,990
that those are deeply complex problems
that we're not going to get there

13234
04:08:44,990 --> 04:08:45,000
that we're not going to get there
 

13235
04:08:45,000 --> 04:08:46,670
that we're not going to get there
quickly so then that gives you a

13236
04:08:46,670 --> 04:08:46,680
quickly so then that gives you a
 

13237
04:08:46,680 --> 04:08:48,830
quickly so then that gives you a
landscape to act on

13238
04:08:48,830 --> 04:08:48,840
