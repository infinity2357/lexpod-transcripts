question how did world war one start
on the one hand world war one started uh

70
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:19,680
on the one hand world war one started uh
 

71
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,109
on the one hand world war one started uh
because of a series of events in the

72
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:21,119
because of a series of events in the
 

73
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,270
because of a series of events in the
summer of 1914

74
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:23,280
summer of 1914
 

75
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,630
summer of 1914
that brought

76
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:24,640
that brought
 

77
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,469

sort of the major powers of europe into
 

79

conflict with one another but i actually

80
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:28,479
conflict with one another but i actually
 

81
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,070
conflict with one another but i actually
think it's more useful

82
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:30,080
think it's more useful
 

83
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,030
think it's more useful
to say that world war one started at

84
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:33,040
to say that world war one started at
 

85
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,270
to say that world war one started at
least a generation earlier

86
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:35,280
least a generation earlier
 

87
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,149
least a generation earlier
when

00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:40,799
started devoting more and more of their
 

93
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,350
started devoting more and more of their
resources toward military affairs and

94
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:43,360
resources toward military affairs and
 

95
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,149
resources toward military affairs and
naval affairs this sets off an arms race

naval affairs this sets off an arms race
 

97
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,030
naval affairs this sets off an arms race

but you know in some ways that that war
 

169
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,589
but you know in some ways that that war
is already underway

170
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:09,599
is already underway
 

171
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,910
is already underway
so do you think

172
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:11,920
so do you think
 

173
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,390
so do you think
it was inevitable because world war one

174
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:14,400
it was inevitable because world war one
 

175
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,229
it was inevitable because world war one
is brought up as a case study where it

176
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:16,239
is brought up as a case study where it
 

177
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,070
is brought up as a case study where it
seems like a few

178
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,080
seems like a few
 

179
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,070
seems like a few
accidental leaders and a few accidental

180
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,080
accidental leaders and a few accidental
 

181
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,630
accidental leaders and a few accidental
events or one accidental event led to

182
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:24,640
events or one accidental event led to
 

183
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,710
events or one accidental event led to
the war and if you change that one

the war and if you change that one
 

185
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,229
the war and if you change that one
little thing you could have avoided the

but fundamentally there were
 

209
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,990
but fundamentally there were
irreconcilable conflicts in the system

ii
you know

258
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:47,280
you know
 

259
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,629
you know
that's a really uh tough call to make um

260
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:50,639
that's a really uh tough call to make um
 

261
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,469
that's a really uh tough call to make um
and you know that deciding that is going

262

next 200 years and
 

267
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,150
next 200 years and
i think

268
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:58,160
i think
 

269
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,189
i think
there

270
00:04:59,189 --> 00:04:59,199
there
 

271
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,350

are people who would lay all of the
blame um on the germans right and you

blame um on the germans right and you
 

275
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,469
blame um on the germans right and you
know who would point toward a generation

276
00:05:06,469 --> 00:05:06,479
know who would point toward a generation
 

277
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,670
know who would point toward a generation
of arms buildup you know alliances that

of arms buildup you know alliances that
that germany made and promises that they

um and so yes there's an awful lot of
 

287
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,909
um and so yes there's an awful lot of
responsibility there um

288
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:21,919
responsibility there um
 

289
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,710
responsibility there um
there has been a trend lately to say um

290
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:24,720
there has been a trend lately to say um
 

291
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,230
there has been a trend lately to say um
no it's no one's fault right that uh you

292
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:28,240
no it's no one's fault right that uh you
 

293
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,670
no it's no one's fault right that uh you
know that all of the various powers

294
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:29,680
know that all of the various powers
 

295
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,469
know that all of the various powers
literally were sleepwalking into the war

296
00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:32,479
literally were sleepwalking into the war
 

297
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,189
literally were sleepwalking into the war
right they backed into it inadvertently

298
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:35,199
right they backed into it inadvertently
 

299
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,110
right they backed into it inadvertently
i think that lets everyone a little too

300
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,120
i think that lets everyone a little too
 

301
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,270
i think that lets everyone a little too
much off the hook right and so i think

302
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:39,280
much off the hook right and so i think
 

303
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,469
much off the hook right and so i think
in between

304
00:05:40,469 --> 00:05:40,479
in between
 

305
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,110
in between
is uh you know i would put the blame on

306
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:43,120
is uh you know i would put the blame on
 

307
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,189
is uh you know i would put the blame on
the system of empires itself on the

311
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,550
system
but in that system the actor that sort

312
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:48,560
but in that system the actor that sort
 

313
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,790
but in that system the actor that sort
of carries the most responsibility is

314
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:50,800
of carries the most responsibility is
 

315
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,510
of carries the most responsibility is

you know britain france or or in turn
 

383
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,309
you know britain france or or in turn
germany or russia at the same time that

384
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:10,319
germany or russia at the same time that
 

385
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,469
germany or russia at the same time that
those alliances kind of trigger

386
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:12,479
those alliances kind of trigger
 

387
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,430
those alliances kind of trigger
automatic responses from the other side

388
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:15,440
automatic responses from the other side
 

389
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,070
automatic responses from the other side
and so it escalates um and once that

390
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,080
and so it escalates um and once that
 

391
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,390
and so it escalates um and once that
escalation is combined with the call up

392
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:20,400
escalation is combined with the call up
 

393
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,309
escalation is combined with the call up
of military troops

of military troops
 

395
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,550

uh it could be solved with diplomacy
 

415
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,749
uh it could be solved with diplomacy
later because diplomacy's failing now um

416
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:47,759
later because diplomacy's failing now um

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,269
wide um that include telegraph wires
that include whole hospitals in the back

498
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:15,279
that include whole hospitals in the back
 

499
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,269
that include whole hospitals in the back
and then at that point um you know the

500
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:17,279
and then at that point um you know the
 

501
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,230
and then at that point um you know the
the front is is locked in place and the

502
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:20,240
the front is is locked in place and the
 

503
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,710
the front is is locked in place and the
only way to break that is sort of

504
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:22,720
only way to break that is sort of
 

505
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,509
only way to break that is sort of
basically dialing the war up to 11.

506
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:25,519
basically dialing the war up to 11.
 

507
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,430
basically dialing the war up to 11.
right sort of massive numbers of troops

508
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:27,440
right sort of massive numbers of troops
 

509
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,269
right sort of massive numbers of troops
massive efforts um

510
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:29,279
massive efforts um
 

511
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,350
massive efforts um
none of which work right and so the war

512
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:31,360
none of which work right and so the war
 

513
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,269
none of which work right and so the war
is stuck in this but that's the

514
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:33,279
is stuck in this but that's the
 

515
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,550
is stuck in this but that's the
that's the phase transition right there

516
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:36,560
that's the phase transition right there
 

517
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,949
that's the phase transition right there
what were the machines of war

518
00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:38,959
what were the machines of war
 

519
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,110
what were the machines of war
in that case you mentioned trenches

520
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:41,120
in that case you mentioned trenches
 

521
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,350
in that case you mentioned trenches
what were the guns used

522
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:43,360
what were the guns used
 

523
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,350
what were the guns used
what was the size of guns what are we

524
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:45,360
what was the size of guns what are we
 

525
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,990
what was the size of guns what are we
talking about what what did germany

526
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:48,000
talking about what what did germany
 

527
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,110
talking about what what did germany
start

528
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:49,120
start
 

529
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,910
start
accumulating that led up to this war

530
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:51,920
accumulating that led up to this war
 

531
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,829
accumulating that led up to this war
one of the things that we see

532
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:53,839
one of the things that we see
 

533
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,190
one of the things that we see
immediately

534
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:55,200
immediately
 

535
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,750
immediately
is the industrial revolution of the

536
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:57,760
is the industrial revolution of the
 

537
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,230
is the industrial revolution of the
previous 30 or 40 years

538
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:00,240
previous 30 or 40 years
 

539
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,269
previous 30 or 40 years
brought to bear on warfare

brought to bear on warfare
 

541
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,190
brought to bear on warfare
right and so you see sort of machine

542
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:05,200
right and so you see sort of machine
 

543
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,990
right and so you see sort of machine
guns you see artillery uh you know these

544
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:08,000
guns you see artillery uh you know these
 

545
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,710
guns you see artillery uh you know these
are the kind of the the key weapons of

546
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:10,720
are the kind of the the key weapons of
 

547
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,949
are the kind of the the key weapons of
war on both sides right the vast

war on both sides right the vast
majority of battlefield casualties are

550
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:15,360
majority of battlefield casualties are
 

551
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,310
majority of battlefield casualties are
from artillery shelling from one side to

552
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:18,320
from artillery shelling from one side to
 

553
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,269
from artillery shelling from one side to
another um not you know sort of rifle or

554

another um not you know sort of rifle or
 

555
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,030
another um not you know sort of rifle or
or even sort of you know machine gun

556
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:23,040
or even sort of you know machine gun
 

557
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,110
or even sort of you know machine gun
kind of uh attacks

558
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,120
kind of uh attacks
 

559
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,750
kind of uh attacks
in some ways the weapons of war are

560
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:27,760
in some ways the weapons of war are
 

561
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,389
in some ways the weapons of war are
are human beings right um you know tens

562

are human beings right um you know tens
 

563
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,509
are human beings right um you know tens
of thousands of them poured over the top

564
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:33,519
of thousands of them poured over the top
 

565
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,750
of thousands of them poured over the top
in these sort of waves to kind of try to

566
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:35,760
in these sort of waves to kind of try to
 

567
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,990
in these sort of waves to kind of try to
break through the enemy lines and it

568
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:38,000
break through the enemy lines and it
 

569
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,230
break through the enemy lines and it
would work for a little while um you

570
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:40,240
would work for a little while um you
 

571
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,150
would work for a little while um you
know but but holding the territory that

572
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:42,160
know but but holding the territory that
 

573
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,710
know but but holding the territory that
had been gained often proved to be even

574
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:44,720
had been gained often proved to be even
 

575
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,269
had been gained often proved to be even
more demanding than gaining it and so

576
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:47,279
more demanding than gaining it and so
 

577
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,190
more demanding than gaining it and so
often um you know each side would

578
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:49,200
often um you know each side would
 

579
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,670
often um you know each side would
retreat back into the trenches and wait

580
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:51,680
retreat back into the trenches and wait
 

581
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,350
retreat back into the trenches and wait
for another day

582
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:53,360

well that's really interesting
 

1039
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,270
well that's really interesting
because uh

1040
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:17,280
because uh
 

1041
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,029
because uh
there's echoes of that in in later wars

1042
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:21,039
there's echoes of that in in later wars

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,270
for some reason once you sense that
in terms of sorry in terms of the

i wonder if that was always the case
so you make the case that world war one

1060
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:39,600
so you make the case that world war one
 

1061
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,950
so you make the case that world war one

so in which way

1068
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:49,120
so in which way
 

1069
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,669
so in which way
does it define the american citizen

1070
00:19:51,669 --> 00:19:51,679
does it define the american citizen
 

1071
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,830
does it define the american citizen
when you think about citizenship what it

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,029
sort of the legal citizenship that you
have as a citizen of the united states

there's a lot of pressure interesting
so there's not a significant like uh

1462
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:54,640
so there's not a significant like uh
 

1463
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,390
so there's not a significant like uh
anti-war

1464
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:56,400
anti-war
 

1465

00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,590
movement as you would see maybe
later with vietnam and things like this

1468
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:01,600
later with vietnam and things like this
 

1469
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,669
later with vietnam and things like this
there was a significant movement before

1470
00:27:03,669 --> 00:27:03,679
there was a significant movement before
 

1471
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,350
there was a significant movement before
1917 but but it becomes very hard to

1472
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:07,360
1917 but but it becomes very hard to
 

1473
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,510
1917 but but it becomes very hard to
keep up an organized anti-war movement

keep up an organized anti-war movement
after that particularly when the

1476
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:10,720
after that particularly when the
 

1477
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,430
after that particularly when the
government starts shutting down protests

1478
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:13,440
government starts shutting down protests
 

1479
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,430
government starts shutting down protests

if asked to die for it right
 

1631
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:07,269
if asked to die for it right
and we certainly see that and i think we

1632
00:30:07,269 --> 00:30:07,279
and we certainly see that and i think we
 

1633
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:08,389
and we certainly see that and i think we
see

1634
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:08,399
see
 

1635
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,789
see
the the close linkage of military

1636
00:30:10,789 --> 00:30:10,799
the the close linkage of military
 

1637
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,789
the the close linkage of military
service and u.s citizenship coming out

1638
00:30:12,789 --> 00:30:12,799
service and u.s citizenship coming out
 

1639
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,950
service and u.s citizenship coming out
of this time period

1640
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:14,960
of this time period
 

1641
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,950
of this time period
but um you know when you start making

1642
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:16,960
but um you know when you start making
 

1643
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,870
but um you know when you start making
lots of demands on people to fulfill

1644
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:18,880
lots of demands on people to fulfill
 

1645
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,710
lots of demands on people to fulfill
obligations in turn they're going to

1646
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:20,720
obligations in turn they're going to
 

1647
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,870
obligations in turn they're going to
start demanding rights

1648
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:22,880
start demanding rights
 

1649
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,630
start demanding rights
and we start to see not necessarily

1650
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:24,640
and we start to see not necessarily
 

1651
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,389
and we start to see not necessarily
during the war but after

1652
00:30:26,389 --> 00:30:26,399
during the war but after
 

1653
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,110
during the war but after
more demands for free speech protections

1654
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:29,120
more demands for free speech protections
 

1655
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,430
more demands for free speech protections
more demands for for equality for

1656
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:31,440
more demands for for equality for
 

1657
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,269
more demands for for equality for
marginalized groups

1658
00:30:33,269 --> 00:30:33,279
marginalized groups
 

1659
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,190
marginalized groups
and so you know obligations and rights

1660
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:35,200
and so you know obligations and rights
 

1661
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,350
and so you know obligations and rights
are sort of developing in a dynamic

1662
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:37,360
are sort of developing in a dynamic
 

1663
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,909
are sort of developing in a dynamic
relationship oh it's almost like

1664
00:30:39,909 --> 00:30:39,919
relationship oh it's almost like
 

1665
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,950
relationship oh it's almost like
an overreach of power sparked

1666
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:42,960
an overreach of power sparked
 

1667
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,909
an overreach of power sparked
a sense like oh crap we can't trust

1668
00:30:45,909 --> 00:30:45,919
a sense like oh crap we can't trust
 

1669
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,590
a sense like oh crap we can't trust
centralized power

1670
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:47,600
centralized power
 

1671
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,990
centralized power
to abuse like to drag us into a war we

1672
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:50,000
to abuse like to drag us into a war we
 

1673
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,310
to abuse like to drag us into a war we
need we need to be able to so there's a

1674
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:52,320
need we need to be able to so there's a
 

1675
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,149
need we need to be able to so there's a
the birth of that tension between the

1676
00:30:54,149 --> 00:30:54,159
the birth of that tension between the
 

1677
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,070
the birth of that tension between the
government and the people

1678
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:56,080
government and the people
 

1679
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,909
government and the people
it's a a rebirth of it you know of

1680
00:30:57,909 --> 00:30:57,919
it's a a rebirth of it you know of
 

1681
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:59,029
it's a a rebirth of it you know of
course that you know that tension is

1682
00:30:59,029 --> 00:30:59,039
course that you know that tension is
 

1683
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,029
course that you know that tension is
always there but but uh in its modern

1684
00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:01,039
always there but but uh in its modern
 

1685
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,590
always there but but uh in its modern
form i think it comes from this

1686
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:02,600
form i think it comes from this
 

1687
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,789
form i think it comes from this
re-intensification of it yeah so what

1688
00:31:04,789 --> 00:31:04,799
re-intensification of it yeah so what
 

1689
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,870
re-intensification of it yeah so what
about you said that world war one gave

00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,389
about you said that world war one gave
birth to the surveillance state in the

1692
00:31:08,389 --> 00:31:08,399
birth to the surveillance state in the
 

1693
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:09,430
birth to the surveillance state in the
u.s

1694

00:31:15,029 --> 00:31:15,039
sort of empowers
 

1701
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,070
sort of empowers
federal organizations to watch other

1702
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:18,080
federal organizations to watch other
 

1703
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,830
federal organizations to watch other
americans they are particularly

americans they are particularly
 

1705
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,549
americans they are particularly
interested in anyone who is obstructing

1706
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:22,559
interested in anyone who is obstructing

know all german americans come under
 

1721
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,070
know all german americans come under
surveillance

1722
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:38,080
surveillance
 

1723
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,909
surveillance
initially um you know this is a very

1724
00:31:39,909 --> 00:31:39,919
initially um you know this is a very
 

1725
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,269
initially um you know this is a very
small scale

1726
00:31:41,269 --> 00:31:41,279
small scale
 

1727
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:41,990
small scale
but

1728
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:42,000
but
 

1729
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,230
but
but soon every government agency gets

1730
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:44,240
but soon every government agency gets
 

1731
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,630
but soon every government agency gets
involved from the treasury department

1732
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:46,640
involved from the treasury department
 

1733
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,950
involved from the treasury department
secret service to the post office which

1734
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:48,960
secret service to the post office which
 

1735
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,029
secret service to the post office which
is uh sort of reading mail to the

1736
00:31:51,029 --> 00:31:51,039
is uh sort of reading mail to the
 

1737
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,590
is uh sort of reading mail to the
justice department which mobilizes 200

1738
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:53,600
justice department which mobilizes 200
 

1739
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,070
justice department which mobilizes 200
000 volunteers yeah and you know it's

1740
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:56,080
000 volunteers yeah and you know it's
 

1741
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,389
000 volunteers yeah and you know it's
it's a really significant enterprise

1742
00:31:58,389 --> 00:31:58,399
it's a really significant enterprise
 

1743
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,389
it's a really significant enterprise
much of it goes away after the war

1744
00:32:00,389 --> 00:32:00,399
much of it goes away after the war
 

1745
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,710
much of it goes away after the war
but of all the things that go away this

1746
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:02,720
but of all the things that go away this
 

1747
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,630
but of all the things that go away this
core of the surveillance state is the

1748
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:04,640
core of the surveillance state is the
 

1749
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,630
core of the surveillance state is the
thing that persists um most most fully

1750
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:08,640
thing that persists um most most fully
 

1751
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,710
thing that persists um most most fully
is this also

1752
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:10,720
is this also
 

1753
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,269
is this also
a place where government the size of

1754
00:32:13,269 --> 00:32:13,279
a place where government the size of
 

1755
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,110
a place where government the size of
government starts to grow in these

1756
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:15,120
government starts to grow in these
 

1757
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,509
government starts to grow in these
different organizations or maybe create

1758
00:32:17,509 --> 00:32:17,519
different organizations or maybe create
 

1759
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,590
different organizations or maybe create
some momentum for growth of government

1760
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:19,600
some momentum for growth of government
 

1761
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,470
some momentum for growth of government
oh it's uh it's it's exponential growth

1762
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:22,480
oh it's uh it's it's exponential growth
 

1763
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,710
oh it's uh it's it's exponential growth
right that um you know that over the

1764
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:24,720
right that um you know that over the
 

1765
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,230
right that um you know that over the
course of the war

1766
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:26,240
course of the war
 

1767
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,549
course of the war
by almost any metric you use right the

1768
00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:28,559
by almost any metric you use right the
 

1769
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:29,990
by almost any metric you use right the
the size of the federal budget the

1770
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:30,000
the size of the federal budget the
 

1771
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,990
the size of the federal budget the
number of federal employees the number

1772
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:32,000
number of federal employees the number
 

1773
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,909
number of federal employees the number
of soldiers in the standing army all of

1774
00:32:33,909 --> 00:32:33,919
of soldiers in the standing army all of
 

1775
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,990
of soldiers in the standing army all of
those things skyrocket during the war

1776
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:36,000
those things skyrocket during the war
 

1777
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,230
those things skyrocket during the war
they go down after the war but they

1778
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:38,240
they go down after the war but they
 

1779
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,029
they go down after the war but they
never go down to what they were before

1780
00:32:41,029 --> 00:32:41,039
never go down to what they were before
 

1781
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,990
never go down to what they were before
and probably gave a momentum for growth

1782
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:44,000
and probably gave a momentum for growth
 

1783
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,110
and probably gave a momentum for growth
over time yes absolutely

1784
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:47,120
over time yes absolutely
 

1785
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,430
over time yes absolutely
did world war one give birth to the

1786
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:49,440
did world war one give birth to the
 

1787
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,830
did world war one give birth to the
military industrial complex in the

1788
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:51,840
military industrial complex in the
 

1789
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,590
military industrial complex in the
united states so

1790
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:55,600

 

1791
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,590

war profiteering

1792
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:57,600
war profiteering
 

1793
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,509
war profiteering
expanding of the war machine in order to

1794
00:33:01,509 --> 00:33:01,519
expanding of the war machine in order to
 

1795
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,149
expanding of the war machine in order to
financially benefit a lot of parties

1796
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:04,159
financially benefit a lot of parties
 

1797
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:05,509
financially benefit a lot of parties
involved

1798
00:33:05,509 --> 00:33:05,519
involved
 

1799
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:06,789
involved
so

1800
00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:06,799
so
 

1801
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,470
so
i guess i i would maybe break that into

1802
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:08,480
i guess i i would maybe break that into
 

1803
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,110
i guess i i would maybe break that into
two parts right that um

1804
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:11,120
two parts right that um
 

1805
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,750
two parts right that um
uh on the one hand yes

1806
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:13,760
uh on the one hand yes
 

1807
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,710
uh on the one hand yes
the there is war profiteering um there

1808
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:16,720
the there is war profiteering um there
 

1809
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,950
the there is war profiteering um there
are investigations of it

1810
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:18,960
are investigations of it
 

1811
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,110
are investigations of it
um in the years after the war there's a

1812
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:21,120
um in the years after the war there's a
 

1813
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,669
um in the years after the war there's a
widespread concern that the profit

1814
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:23,679
widespread concern that the profit
 

1815
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:26,070
widespread concern that the profit
motive had played

1816
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:26,080
motive had played
 

1817
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,909
motive had played
you know too much of a part

1818
00:33:27,909 --> 00:33:27,919
you know too much of a part
 

1819
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:29,190
you know too much of a part
in the war and that's definitely the

1820
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:29,200
in the war and that's definitely the
 

1821
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,950
in the war and that's definitely the
case

1822
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:30,960
case
 

1823
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,470
case
but i think when you try to think of

1824
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:32,480
but i think when you try to think of
 

1825
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,350
but i think when you try to think of
this term military industrial complex

1826
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:35,360
this term military industrial complex
 

1827
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,509
this term military industrial complex
it's best you know

1828
00:33:37,509 --> 00:33:37,519
it's best you know
 

1829
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,110
it's best you know
to think of it as you know at what point

1830
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:39,120
to think of it as you know at what point
 

1831
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,269
to think of it as you know at what point
does the one side lock in the other

1832
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:41,279
does the one side lock in the other
 

1833
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,029
does the one side lock in the other
right that military choices are shaped

1834
00:33:43,029 --> 00:33:43,039
right that military choices are shaped
 

1835
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,830
right that military choices are shaped
by industry uh stan you know

1836
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:45,840
by industry uh stan you know
 

1837
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,549
by industry uh stan you know
objectives and and vice versa

1838
00:33:48,549 --> 00:33:48,559
objectives and and vice versa
 

1839
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,230
objectives and and vice versa
and i don't think that that was fully

1840
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:50,240
and i don't think that that was fully
 

1841
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,549
and i don't think that that was fully
locked into place during world war one i

1842
00:33:52,549 --> 00:33:52,559
locked into place during world war one i
 

1843
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:53,909
locked into place during world war one i
think that's really a cold war

1844
00:33:53,909 --> 00:33:53,919
think that's really a cold war
 

1845
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:56,470
think that's really a cold war
phenomenon when the united states is on

1846
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:56,480
phenomenon when the united states is on
 

1847
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,190
phenomenon when the united states is on
this intense kind of footing for for two

1848
00:33:59,190 --> 00:33:59,200
this intense kind of footing for for two
 

1849
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,430
this intense kind of footing for for two
generations in a row so industrial is

1850
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:01,440
generations in a row so industrial is
 

1851
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,630
generations in a row so industrial is
really important there there is

1852
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:02,640
really important there there is
 

1853
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,630
really important there there is
companies

1854
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:04,640
companies
 

1855
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,110
companies
so before then

1856
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:07,120
so before then
 

1857
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,109
so before then
weapons of war were created were uh

1858
00:34:09,109 --> 00:34:09,119
weapons of war were created were uh
 

1859
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,270
weapons of war were created were uh
funded directly by the government were

1860
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:11,280
funded directly by the government were
 

1861
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,550
funded directly by the government were
like

1862
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:12,560
like
 

1863
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,310
like
like who was manufacturing the weapons

1864
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:14,320
like who was manufacturing the weapons
 

1865
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,750
like who was manufacturing the weapons
of war

1866
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:15,760
of war
 

1867
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,510
of war
they were generally manufactured by

1868
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:17,520
they were generally manufactured by
 

1869
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,990
they were generally manufactured by
private industry um uh there were of

1870
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:20,000
private industry um uh there were of
 

1871
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,710
private industry um uh there were of
course art well arsenal sort of 19th

1872
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:22,720
course art well arsenal sort of 19th
 

1873
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,550
course art well arsenal sort of 19th
century iterations where the government

1874
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:24,560
century iterations where the government
 

1875
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,109
century iterations where the government
would produce its own weapons um partly

1876
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:27,119
would produce its own weapons um partly
 

1877
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,030
would produce its own weapons um partly
to make sure that they got what they

1878
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:29,040
to make sure that they got what they
 

1879
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,909
to make sure that they got what they
wanted um but but most of the weapons of

1880
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:31,919
wanted um but but most of the weapons of
 

1881
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:34,310
wanted um but but most of the weapons of
war for all of the european powers and

1882
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:34,320
war for all of the european powers and
 

1883
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,310
war for all of the european powers and
the united states are produced by

1884
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:36,320
the united states are produced by
 

1885
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,909
the united states are produced by
private industry so why do you say that

1886
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:37,919
private industry so why do you say that
 

1887
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:39,829
private industry so why do you say that
the military-industrial complex didn't

1888
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:39,839
the military-industrial complex didn't
 

1889
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:42,550
the military-industrial complex didn't
start then what was the what was the

1890
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:42,560
start then what was the what was the
 

1891
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,829
start then what was the what was the
important thing that happened in the

1892
00:34:43,829 --> 00:34:43,839
important thing that happened in the
 

1893
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:45,270
important thing that happened in the
cold war

1894
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:45,280
cold war
 

1895
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,869
cold war
i think

1896
00:34:46,869 --> 00:34:46,879
i think
 

1897
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,869
i think
one way to think about it is it it's

1898
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:48,879
one way to think about it is it it's
 

1899
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,270
one way to think about it is it it's
the cold war is a point at which it uh

1900
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:51,280
the cold war is a point at which it uh
 

1901
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,909
the cold war is a point at which it uh
switches from being a dial to a ratchet

1902
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:53,919
switches from being a dial to a ratchet
 

1903
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:55,909
switches from being a dial to a ratchet
right so during world war one uh you

1904
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:55,919
right so during world war one uh you
 

1905
00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:57,589
right so during world war one uh you
know the relationship between the

1906
00:34:57,589 --> 00:34:57,599
know the relationship between the
 

1907
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,390
know the relationship between the
military and industry dials up

1908
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:00,400
military and industry dials up
 

1909
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,190
military and industry dials up
you know fast and high and stays you

1910
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:03,200
you know fast and high and stays you
 

1911
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,109
you know fast and high and stays you
know stays that way and it dials back

1912
00:35:05,109 --> 00:35:05,119
know stays that way and it dials back
 

1913
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,310
know stays that way and it dials back
down

1914
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:06,320
down
 

1915
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,790
down
whereas during um the cold war um sort

1916
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:08,800
whereas during um the cold war um sort
 

1917
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,310
whereas during um the cold war um sort
of the relationship between the two

1918
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:10,320
of the relationship between the two
 

1919
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,069
of the relationship between the two
often looks more like a ratchet yeah

1920
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:12,079
often looks more like a ratchet yeah
 

1921
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:14,069
often looks more like a ratchet yeah
because it becomes unstoppable it goes

1922
00:35:14,069 --> 00:35:14,079
because it becomes unstoppable it goes
 

1923
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,349
because it becomes unstoppable it goes
up again

1924
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:15,359
up again
 

1925
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:18,550
up again
and in the way that you start i think

1926
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:18,560
and in the way that you start i think
 

1927
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,390
and in the way that you start i think
the way the military-industrial complex

1928
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:20,400
the way the military-industrial complex
 

1929
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,910
the way the military-industrial complex
is often involved

1930
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:21,920
is often involved
 

1931
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,150
is often involved
um disgust is

1932
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:24,160
um disgust is
 

1933
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,790
um disgust is
as a system that

1934
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:26,800
as a system that
 

1935
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,390
as a system that
is unstoppable

1936
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:28,400
is unstoppable
 

1937
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,270
is unstoppable
right like it expands

1938
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:31,280
right like it expands
 

1939
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,829
right like it expands
it almost i mean if you take a very

1940
00:35:33,829 --> 00:35:33,839
it almost i mean if you take a very
 

1941
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,990
it almost i mean if you take a very
cynical view

1942
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:36,000
cynical view
 

1943
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:36,950
cynical view
it

1944
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:36,960
it
 

1945
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,870
it
creates war

1946
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:38,880
creates war
 

1947
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,589
creates war
so that it can make money

1948
00:35:41,589 --> 00:35:41,599
so that it can make money
 

1949
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:42,950
so that it can make money
it doesn't just

1950
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:42,960
it doesn't just
 

1951
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,109
it doesn't just
find places where it can help through

1952
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:45,119
find places where it can help through
 

1953
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,950
find places where it can help through
military conflict

1954
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:46,960
military conflict
 

1955
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,510
military conflict
it creates tensions that directly or

1956
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:49,520
it creates tensions that directly or
 

1957
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,829
it creates tensions that directly or
indirectly lead to military conflict

1958
00:35:51,829 --> 00:35:51,839
indirectly lead to military conflict
 

1959
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,109
indirectly lead to military conflict
that can then

1960
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:53,119
that can then
 

1961
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:56,230
that can then
fuel and make money from

1962
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:56,240
fuel and make money from
 

1963
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,030
fuel and make money from
that is certainly one of the concerns um

1964
00:35:59,030 --> 00:35:59,040
that is certainly one of the concerns um
 

1965
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,790
that is certainly one of the concerns um
of both people

1966
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:00,800
of both people
 

1967
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,550
of both people

address where he sort of introduces the
term military-industrial complex and

1978
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:13,040
term military-industrial complex and
 

1979
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,550
term military-industrial complex and
some of it is about the profit motive

1980
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:14,560
some of it is about the profit motive
 

1981
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,790
some of it is about the profit motive
but some of it is a a fear that that

1982
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:16,800
but some of it is a a fear that that
 

1983
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,310
but some of it is a a fear that that
eisenhower had

that no one had an interest in stopping
this

1988
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:21,920
this
 

1989
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,670
this
right and that no one had a voice in

00:38:41,109 --> 00:38:41,119
and um you know i think it's it's
 

2113
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,829
and um you know i think it's it's
important to realize that you know uh in

2114
00:38:43,829 --> 00:38:43,839
important to realize that you know uh in
 

2115
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:46,230
important to realize that you know uh in
the generation after world war one this

2116
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:46,240
the generation after world war one this
 

2117
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,790
the generation after world war one this
was a serious civic conversation it led

2118
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:48,800
was a serious civic conversation it led
 

2119
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,270
was a serious civic conversation it led
to you know sort of investigations of

2120
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:51,280
to you know sort of investigations of
 

2121
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,470
to you know sort of investigations of
defense

2122
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:52,480
defense
 

2123
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,270
defense
sort of finance it led to experiments

2124
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:55,280
sort of finance it led to experiments
 

2125
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,270
sort of finance it led to experiments
in britain and france and public finance

2126
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:57,280
in britain and france and public finance
 

2127
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,589
in britain and france and public finance
of war material

2128
00:38:59,589 --> 00:38:59,599
of war material
 

2129
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,270
of war material
and i think those conversations need to

2130
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:01,280
and i think those conversations need to
 

2131
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,510
and i think those conversations need to
be reconvened

2132
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:03,520
be reconvened
 

2133
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,670
be reconvened
now in the 21st century is there any

2134
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:05,680
now in the 21st century is there any
 

2135
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,829
now in the 21st century is there any
parallels between

2136
00:39:07,829 --> 00:39:07,839
parallels between
 

2137
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:11,270
parallels between
world war one and the war in ukraine

2138
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:11,280
world war one and the war in ukraine
 

2139
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,510
world war one and the war in ukraine
the reason i bring it up is because

2140
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:15,520
the reason i bring it up is because
 

2141
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,109
the reason i bring it up is because
you mentioned sort of

2142
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:19,119

 

2143
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,150

there was a hunger for war

2144
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:22,160
there was a hunger for war
 

2145
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,990
there was a hunger for war
a capacity for war that was already

2146
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:24,000
a capacity for war that was already
 

2147
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,349
a capacity for war that was already
established

2148
00:39:25,349 --> 00:39:25,359
established
 

2149
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:27,349
established
and the different parties were just

2150
00:39:27,349 --> 00:39:27,359
and the different parties were just
 

2151
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:29,030
and the different parties were just
boiling the uh

2152
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:29,040
boiling the uh
 

2153
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,470
boiling the uh
the tensions

2154
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:30,480
the tensions
 

2155
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,190
the tensions
so there's a case made that america had

2156
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:33,200
so there's a case made that america had
 

2157
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:33,910
so there's a case made that america had
a

2158
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:33,920
a
 

2159
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,990
a
role to play nato had a role to play in

2160
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:36,000
role to play nato had a role to play in
 

2161
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,990
role to play nato had a role to play in
the current war in ukraine

2162
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:38,000
the current war in ukraine
 

2163
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,870
the current war in ukraine
is there some truth to that

2164
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:40,880
is there some truth to that
 

2165
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,270
is there some truth to that
uh when you think about it in the

2166
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:43,280
uh when you think about it in the
 

2167
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,069
uh when you think about it in the
context of world war one

2168
00:39:46,069 --> 00:39:46,079
context of world war one
 

2169
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,390
context of world war one
or is it purely about the specific

2170
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:48,400
or is it purely about the specific
 

2171
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,630
or is it purely about the specific
parties involved which is russia and

2172
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:50,640
parties involved which is russia and
 

2173
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,310
parties involved which is russia and
ukraine

2174
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:52,320
ukraine
 

2175
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,190
ukraine
i think it's very easy to

2176
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:55,200
i think it's very easy to
 

2177
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,990
i think it's very easy to
draw parallels between world war one uh

2178
00:39:57,990 --> 00:39:58,000
draw parallels between world war one uh
 

2179
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,910
draw parallels between world war one uh
and the war in ukraine um

2180
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:01,920
and the war in ukraine um
 

2181
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,349
and the war in ukraine um
but i don't think they really work um

2182
00:40:05,349 --> 00:40:05,359
but i don't think they really work um
 

2183
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:08,790
but i don't think they really work um
that you know the first world war

2184
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:08,800
that you know the first world war
 

2185
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,990
that you know the first world war
in some ways is generated by

2186
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:12,000
in some ways is generated by
 

2187
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,510
in some ways is generated by
a

2188
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:13,520
a
 

2189
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,710
a
you know fundamental conflict uh in the

2190
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:16,720
you know fundamental conflict uh in the
 

2191
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,950
you know fundamental conflict uh in the
euro european system of empires right in

2192
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:18,960
euro european system of empires right in
 

2193
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,349
euro european system of empires right in
the global system of empires

2194
00:40:21,349 --> 00:40:21,359
the global system of empires
 

2195
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:23,670
the global system of empires
so in many ways if there's a parallel

2196
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:23,680
so in many ways if there's a parallel
 

2197
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,990
so in many ways if there's a parallel
the war in ukraine is the parallel to

2198
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:26,000
the war in ukraine is the parallel to
 

2199
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,069
the war in ukraine is the parallel to
some of the conflicts in

2200
00:40:28,069 --> 00:40:28,079
some of the conflicts in
 

2201
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:29,670
some of the conflicts in
um you know in

2202
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:29,680
um you know in
 

2203
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,630
um you know in
the mediterranean and the balkans in

2204
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:31,640
the mediterranean and the balkans in
 

2205
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,710
the mediterranean and the balkans in
1911 to 1913

2206
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:34,720
1911 to 1913
 

2207
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,470
1911 to 1913
um that

2208
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:36,480
um that
 

2209
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,390
um that
um you know

2210
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:38,400
um you know
 

2211
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,950
um you know
that then later there was a much greater

2212
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:40,960
that then later there was a much greater
 

2213
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,030
that then later there was a much greater
conflict right and so

2214
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:43,040
conflict right and so
 

2215
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,630
conflict right and so
i think if there's any lessons to be

2216
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:44,640
i think if there's any lessons to be
 

2217
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,829
i think if there's any lessons to be
learned um for how not to you know let

2218
00:40:47,829 --> 00:40:47,839
learned um for how not to you know let
 

2219
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:50,550
learned um for how not to you know let
uh world war iii look like world war one

2220
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:50,560
uh world war iii look like world war one
 

2221
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,349
uh world war iii look like world war one
um it would be to make sure that um you

2222
00:40:53,349 --> 00:40:53,359
um it would be to make sure that um you
 

2223
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:55,030
um it would be to make sure that um you
know that systems aren't locked into

2224
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:55,040
know that systems aren't locked into
 

2225
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,670
know that systems aren't locked into
place um that escalate wars out of out

2226
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:57,680
place um that escalate wars out of out
 

2227
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,910
place um that escalate wars out of out
of people's expectations well that's

2228
00:40:59,910 --> 00:40:59,920
of people's expectations well that's
 

2229
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,870
of people's expectations well that's
i suppose what i was uh implying

2230
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:02,880
i suppose what i was uh implying
 

2231
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,190
i suppose what i was uh implying
that this is the early stages of world

2232
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:05,200
that this is the early stages of world
 

2233
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,550
that this is the early stages of world
war iii

war iii
 

2235
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,069
war iii
that in the same way that

2236
00:41:10,069 --> 00:41:10,079

 

2237
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,710

several wolves are licking their

they're they're creating tension they're

they're they're creating tension they're
 

2243

imperative for a global war

00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:25,440
imperative for a global war
 

2249
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,190
imperative for a global war
that's i mean

2250
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:27,200
that's i mean
 

2251
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,710
that's i mean
many kind of

2252
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:28,720
many kind of
 

2253
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,069
many kind of
people that are looking at this are

2254
00:41:30,069 --> 00:41:30,079
people that are looking at this are
 

2255
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,829
people that are looking at this are
really worried about that now

2256
00:41:32,829 --> 00:41:32,839
really worried about that now
 

2257
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:36,309
really worried about that now
the the stopping the forcing function to

2258
00:41:36,309 --> 00:41:36,319
the the stopping the forcing function to
 

2259
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,309
the the stopping the forcing function to
stop this war is that there's

2260
00:41:38,309 --> 00:41:38,319
stop this war is that there's
 

2261
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:40,630
stop this war is that there's
several nuclear powers involved

2262

several nuclear powers involved
 

2263
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,950
several nuclear powers involved
which has at least for now worked to

2264
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:42,960
which has at least for now worked to
 

2265
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,150
which has at least for now worked to

but i'm not sure that's going to be the
 

2273

00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:30,240
and i think
 

2311
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,990
and i think
again it gets back to what i was saying

2312

again it gets back to what i was saying
in that in the summer of 1914

um even then um things that looked
um

2318
00:42:39,109 --> 00:42:39,119
um
 

2319
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:42,150
um
like a march toward war

2320
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:42,160
like a march toward war
 

2321
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,390
like a march toward war

different war
 

2393
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,309
different war
right it's one uh because it is a civil

00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:16,960
so the dynamics are are are really quite
 

2407
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,510
so the dynamics are are are really quite
different right so you know the the

2408
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:19,520
different right so you know the the
 

2409
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,270
different right so you know the the
leaders particularly lincoln have a

2410

00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,430
ii people
kind of framed the narrative that it was

kind of framed the narrative that it was

hitler being evil
 

2461
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,630
hitler being evil
i think the key part of that is probably

2462
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:16,640
i think the key part of that is probably
 

2463
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,950
i think the key part of that is probably
the holocaust that's how you can

2464
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:18,960
the holocaust that's how you can
 

2465
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,510
the holocaust that's how you can
formulate hitler's being evil if there's

00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:21,520
formulate hitler's being evil if there's
 

2467
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,349
formulate hitler's being evil if there's
no holocaust perhaps there's a case to

2468
00:45:23,349 --> 00:45:23,359
no holocaust perhaps there's a case to
 

2469
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:25,190
no holocaust perhaps there's a case to
be made that we wouldn't

2470
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:25,200
be made that we wouldn't
 

2471
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,750
be made that we wouldn't
see world war ii as such

2472
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:27,760

uh to be able to tell a clear narrative
 

2481
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,430
uh to be able to tell a clear narrative
of why we get into this war perhaps such

of why we get into this war perhaps such
 

2483
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,430
of why we get into this war perhaps such
a narrative doesn't exist for world war

00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:41,440
a narrative doesn't exist for world war

one
 

2487
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,470
one
and so that doesn't stay in the american

2488
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:44,480
and so that doesn't stay in the american
 

2489
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,950
and so that doesn't stay in the american
mind we try to uh sweep it under the rug

2490
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:46,960
mind we try to uh sweep it under the rug
 

2491
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:47,990
mind we try to uh sweep it under the rug
even though

00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:48,000
even though
 

2493
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,510
even though
overall 16 million people died

00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:51,520
overall 16 million people died
 

2495
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,109
overall 16 million people died
so

2496
00:45:53,109 --> 00:45:53,119
so
 

2497
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:55,750
so
so to you the difference is in the fact

2498
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:55,760
so to you the difference is in the fact
 

2499
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,150
so to you the difference is in the fact
that you're fighting for us for ideas

2500
00:45:58,150 --> 00:45:58,160
that you're fighting for us for ideas
 

2501
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,150
that you're fighting for us for ideas
and fighting

2502
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:00,160
and fighting
 

2503
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,390
and fighting
on on on the homeland but in terms of

2504
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:02,400
on on on the homeland but in terms of
 

2505
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,349
on on on the homeland but in terms of
people's participation

2506
00:46:05,349 --> 00:46:05,359
people's participation
 

2507
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:06,870
people's participation
you know um

2508
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:06,880

was there similarities there
yeah i mean i think uh

2514
00:46:13,109 --> 00:46:13,119

overwhelmingly um through volunteer
 

2521
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,870
overwhelmingly um through volunteer
recruitment uh there is a draft in in

2522
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:22,880
recruitment uh there is a draft in in
 

2523
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,510
recruitment uh there is a draft in in
both the north and the south but um

2524
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:25,520
both the north and the south but um
 

2525
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:28,309
both the north and the south but um
uh you know it's it's not significant um

2526
00:46:28,309 --> 00:46:28,319
uh you know it's it's not significant um
 

2527
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,630
uh you know it's it's not significant um
only eight percent of of uh

2528
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:30,640
only eight percent of of uh
 

2529
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,790
only eight percent of of uh
of confederate soldiers came in through

um and so in fact you know the
 

2535
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,990
um and so in fact you know the
the mobilization for

00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:44,470
and
you know i think um

2926
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:44,480

 

2927
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,230

it's useful to think and counter

2928
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:46,240
it's useful to think and counter
 

2929
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:49,510
it's useful to think and counter
factuals um you know what if um and

2930
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:49,520
factuals um you know what if um and
 

2931
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,270
factuals um you know what if um and
if you believe

2932
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:51,280
if you believe
 

2933
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:54,069
if you believe
as historians do in causation

2934
00:53:54,069 --> 00:53:54,079
as historians do in causation
 

2935
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:56,870
as historians do in causation
then if that one thing causes another

2936
00:53:56,870 --> 00:53:56,880
then if that one thing causes another
 

2937
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,390
then if that one thing causes another
then you also have to believe in counter

2938
00:53:58,390 --> 00:53:58,400
then you also have to believe in counter
 

2939
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,549
then you also have to believe in counter
factuals right that if something hadn't

2940
00:54:00,549 --> 00:54:00,559
factuals right that if something hadn't
 

2941
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:02,230
factuals right that if something hadn't
happened then maybe that wouldn't you

2942
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:02,240
happened then maybe that wouldn't you
 

2943
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,870
happened then maybe that wouldn't you
know that would have worked differently

2944
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:04,880
know that would have worked differently
 

2945
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:08,470
know that would have worked differently
um but uh i think all the things that

2946
00:54:08,470 --> 00:54:08,480
um but uh i think all the things that
 

2947
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,589
um but uh i think all the things that
led to world war one um are

2948
00:54:11,589 --> 00:54:11,599
led to world war one um are
 

2949
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:13,670
led to world war one um are
multi-causal and nuanced and this is

2950
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:13,680
multi-causal and nuanced and this is
 

2951
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,190
multi-causal and nuanced and this is
what historians do we make things more

2952
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:15,200
what historians do we make things more
 

2953
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,430
what historians do we make things more
complicated um and so

2954
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:17,440
complicated um and so
 

2955
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:18,790
complicated um and so
you know there was no one thing that

2956
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:18,800
you know there was no one thing that
 

2957
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,470
you know there was no one thing that
could have you know uh

2958
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:20,480
could have you know uh
 

2959
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,870
could have you know uh
like that could have turned the the tide

2960
00:54:22,870 --> 00:54:22,880
like that could have turned the the tide
 

2961
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,870
like that could have turned the the tide
of history um you know

2962
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:24,880
of history um you know
 

2963
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,870
of history um you know
and you know oh if only

2964
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:26,880
and you know oh if only
 

2965
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,950
and you know oh if only
hitler had gotten into art school or if

2966
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:28,960
hitler had gotten into art school or if
 

2967
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,030
hitler had gotten into art school or if
only fidel castro had gotten into the

2968
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:31,040
only fidel castro had gotten into the
 

2969
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,190
only fidel castro had gotten into the
major leagues you know uh

2970
00:54:33,190 --> 00:54:33,200
major leagues you know uh
 

2971
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,870
major leagues you know uh
uh those are interesting thought

2972
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:34,880
uh those are interesting thought
 

2973
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,109
uh those are interesting thought
experiments but few few events in

2974
00:54:37,109 --> 00:54:37,119
experiments but few few events in
 

2975
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:39,510
experiments but few few events in
history i think are that contingent well

2976
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:39,520
history i think are that contingent well
 

2977
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,670
history i think are that contingent well
hitler is an example somebody who's a

2978
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:41,680
hitler is an example somebody who's a
 

2979
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,990
hitler is an example somebody who's a
charismatic leader

2980
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:44,000
charismatic leader
 

2981
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,470
charismatic leader
that seems to have a really

2982
00:54:48,470 --> 00:54:48,480

 

2983
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,430

disproportionate amount of influence

2984
00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:51,440
disproportionate amount of influence
 

2985
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,990
disproportionate amount of influence
on the tide of history

2986
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:54,000
on the tide of history
 

2987
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:54,870
on the tide of history
so

2988
00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:54,880
so
 

2989
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,190
so
you know if you look at stalin you can

2990
00:54:57,190 --> 00:54:57,200
you know if you look at stalin you can
 

2991
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:00,150
you know if you look at stalin you can
imagine that many other people could

2992
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:00,160
imagine that many other people could
 

2993
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,790
imagine that many other people could
have stepped into that role

2994
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:02,800
have stepped into that role
 

2995
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,630
have stepped into that role
and the same goes for many other the

2996
00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:04,640
and the same goes for many other the
 

2997
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:08,470
and the same goes for many other the
other presidents through or even mao

2998
00:55:08,470 --> 00:55:08,480
other presidents through or even mao
 

2999
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,630
other presidents through or even mao
it seems that there's a singular nature

3000
00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:10,640
it seems that there's a singular nature
 

3001
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,710
it seems that there's a singular nature
to hitler that you could play the

3002
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:12,720
to hitler that you could play the
 

3003
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,790
to hitler that you could play the
counterfactual

3004
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:14,800
counterfactual
 

3005
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,870
counterfactual
that if there was no hitler you may have

3006
00:55:16,870 --> 00:55:16,880
that if there was no hitler you may have
 

3007
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,430
that if there was no hitler you may have
not had world war ii he

3008
00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:19,440
not had world war ii he
 

3009
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,109
not had world war ii he
better than many

3010
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:21,119
better than many
 

3011
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:23,349
better than many
um leaders in history was able to

3012
00:55:23,349 --> 00:55:23,359
um leaders in history was able to
 

3013
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:26,230
um leaders in history was able to
channel the resentment of the populace

3014
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:26,240
channel the resentment of the populace
 

3015
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,630
channel the resentment of the populace
into a very aggressive expansion of the

3016
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:28,640
into a very aggressive expansion of the
 

3017
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,549
into a very aggressive expansion of the
military and

3018
00:55:30,549 --> 00:55:30,559
military and
 

3019
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:31,670
military and
i would say

3020
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:31,680
i would say
 

3021
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:35,030
i would say
skillful deceit of the entire world

3022
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:35,040
skillful deceit of the entire world
 

3023
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,750
skillful deceit of the entire world
in terms of his plans and was able to

3024
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:37,760
in terms of his plans and was able to
 

3025
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,589
in terms of his plans and was able to
effectively start the war

3026
00:55:39,589 --> 00:55:39,599
effectively start the war
 

3027
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:40,549
effectively start the war
so

3028
00:55:40,549 --> 00:55:40,559
so
 

3029
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:43,829
so
is it is it possible that

3030
00:55:43,829 --> 00:55:43,839
is it is it possible that
 

3031
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:45,910
is it is it possible that
i mean could hitler have been stopped

3032
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:45,920
i mean could hitler have been stopped
 

3033
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,589
i mean could hitler have been stopped
could we have avoided

3034
00:55:47,589 --> 00:55:47,599
could we have avoided
 

3035
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:50,390
could we have avoided
if he just got into art school right

3036
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:50,400
if he just got into art school right
 

3037
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,870
if he just got into art school right
uh or again do you feel like there's a

3038
00:55:52,870 --> 00:55:52,880
uh or again do you feel like there's a
 

3039
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,670
uh or again do you feel like there's a
current of events that was unstoppable i

3040
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:55,680
current of events that was unstoppable i
 

3041
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,030
current of events that was unstoppable i
mean part of what you're talking about

3042
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:57,040
mean part of what you're talking about
 

3043
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:00,309
mean part of what you're talking about
is uh is hitler the individual as a sort

3044
00:56:00,309 --> 00:56:00,319
is uh is hitler the individual as a sort

00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,190
ability to play for example play off his
subordinates against one another to set

3056
00:56:15,190 --> 00:56:15,200
subordinates against one another to set
 

3057
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,349
subordinates against one another to set
up a system and you know of that of that

3058
00:56:17,349 --> 00:56:17,359
up a system and you know of that of that
 

3059
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:19,510
up a system and you know of that of that
nature that that in some ways escalates

3060
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:19,520
nature that that in some ways escalates
 

3061
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,589
nature that that in some ways escalates
violence including um you know the

3062
00:56:21,589 --> 00:56:21,599
violence including um you know the
 

3063
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:23,589
violence including um you know the
violence that leads to the holocaust

3064
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:23,599
violence that leads to the holocaust
 

3065
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:26,390
violence that leads to the holocaust
um and some of it is also hitlerism um

3066
00:56:26,390 --> 00:56:26,400
um and some of it is also hitlerism um
 

3067
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,109
um and some of it is also hitlerism um
as a as a leader cult and we see this in

3068
00:56:29,109 --> 00:56:29,119
as a as a leader cult and we see this in
 

3069
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,549
as a as a leader cult and we see this in
many other sort of

3070
00:56:30,549 --> 00:56:30,559
many other sort of
 

3071
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:32,710
many other sort of
you know things where where a political

3072
00:56:32,710 --> 00:56:32,720
you know things where where a political
 

3073
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:35,030
you know things where where a political
movement surrounds one particular

3074
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:35,040
movement surrounds one particular

replaceable
 

3079
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:42,390
replaceable
um so so yes the world war ii we got um

3080
00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:42,400
um so so yes the world war ii we got um
 

3081
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,390
um so so yes the world war ii we got um
would have been completely different

3082
00:56:44,390 --> 00:56:44,400
would have been completely different
 

3083
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,349
would have been completely different
um if a different um sort of uh faction

3084
00:56:47,349 --> 00:56:47,359
um if a different um sort of uh faction
 

3085
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:49,430

somehow the mind wants to explain all

well

3326
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:03,040
well
 

3327
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:05,990
well
it's it like it's a very sticky idea

3328
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:06,000
it's it like it's a very sticky idea
 

3329
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,910
it's it like it's a very sticky idea
certain ideas certain explanations are

3330
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:07,920
certain ideas certain explanations are
 

3331
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,150
certain ideas certain explanations are
very sticky and i think that's really

3332
01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:10,160
very sticky and i think that's really
 

3333
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:11,990
very sticky and i think that's really
dangerous because then you lose the full

3334
01:01:11,990 --> 01:01:12,000
dangerous because then you lose the full
 

3335
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,789
dangerous because then you lose the full
context and also in the case of drugs

3336
01:01:14,789 --> 01:01:14,799
context and also in the case of drugs
 

3337
01:01:14,799 --> 01:01:16,630
context and also in the case of drugs
it removes the responsibility from the

3338
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:16,640
it removes the responsibility from the
 

3339
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:17,910
it removes the responsibility from the
person

3340
01:01:17,910 --> 01:01:17,920

both for the military genius

3342
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:20,480
both for the military genius
 

3343
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,470
both for the military genius
and the evil

3344
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:22,480
and the evil
 

3345
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,230
and the evil
and i think

3346
01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:24,240
and i think
 

3347
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:26,150
and i think
it's a very dangerous thing to do

3348
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:26,160
it's a very dangerous thing to do
 

3349
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:27,910
it's a very dangerous thing to do
because something about the mind maybe

3350
01:01:27,910 --> 01:01:27,920
because something about the mind maybe
 

3351
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,990
because something about the mind maybe
it's just mine it's sticky to this well

3352
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:30,000
it's just mine it's sticky to this well
 

3353
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,910
it's just mine it's sticky to this well
drugs explain it if the drugs didn't

3354
01:01:31,910 --> 01:01:31,920
drugs explain it if the drugs didn't
 

3355
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:32,950
drugs explain it if the drugs didn't
happen

3356
01:01:32,950 --> 01:01:32,960
happen
 

3357
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:35,349
happen
uh then it would be very different yeah

3358
01:01:35,349 --> 01:01:35,359
uh then it would be very different yeah
 

3359
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:37,109
uh then it would be very different yeah
it worries me

3360
01:01:37,109 --> 01:01:37,119
it worries me
 

3361
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:39,670
it worries me
how compelling it is of an explanation

3362
01:01:39,670 --> 01:01:39,680
how compelling it is of an explanation
 

3363
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,990
how compelling it is of an explanation
you know yeah so that's why it's maybe

3364
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:42,000
you know yeah so that's why it's maybe
 

3365
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,990
you know yeah so that's why it's maybe
better to think of it as a window into

3366
01:01:43,990 --> 01:01:44,000
better to think of it as a window into
 

3367
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,150
better to think of it as a window into
the third round yes than an explanation

3368
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:46,160
the third round yes than an explanation
 

3369
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,309
the third round yes than an explanation
of it but it's also a nice exploration

3370
01:01:48,309 --> 01:01:48,319
of it but it's also a nice exploration
 

3371
01:01:48,319 --> 01:01:49,829
of it but it's also a nice exploration
of hitler the man

3372
01:01:49,829 --> 01:01:49,839
of hitler the man
 

3373
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:51,750

3375
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,750
for some reason discussing his habits

3379
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,430
um his practices with drugs
gives you a window into the person it

3380
01:01:59,430 --> 01:01:59,440
gives you a window into the person it

germany and that
 

3575
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,549
germany and that
goes to primary sources a lot

3576
01:05:16,549 --> 01:05:16,559
goes to primary sources a lot
 

3577
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:18,309
goes to primary sources a lot
which is

3578
01:05:18,309 --> 01:05:18,319
which is
 

3579
01:05:18,319 --> 01:05:19,349
which is
like

3580
01:05:19,349 --> 01:05:19,359
like
 

3581
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:22,069
like
i suppose that's the honest way to do it

3582
01:05:22,069 --> 01:05:22,079
i suppose that's the honest way to do it
 

3583
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:24,150
i suppose that's the honest way to do it
but it's tough it's really tough to

3584
01:05:24,150 --> 01:05:24,160
but it's tough it's really tough to
 

3585
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:26,470
but it's tough it's really tough to
write that way to really go to primary

3586
01:05:26,470 --> 01:05:26,480
write that way to really go to primary
 

3587
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,710
write that way to really go to primary
sources

3588
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:28,720
sources
 

3589
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:30,470
sources
always and i think the one of the things

3590
01:05:30,470 --> 01:05:30,480
always and i think the one of the things
 

3591
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:33,510
always and i think the one of the things
that dan tries to do

3592
01:05:33,510 --> 01:05:33,520
that dan tries to do
 

3593
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:35,510
that dan tries to do
which is also really tough to do perhaps

3594
01:05:35,510 --> 01:05:35,520
which is also really tough to do perhaps
 

3595
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:39,270
which is also really tough to do perhaps

that will be very costly
i feel like there was not a plot in a

4140
01:15:20,470 --> 01:15:20,480
i feel like there was not a plot in a
 

4141
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:21,430
i feel like there was not a plot in a
chart

4142
01:15:21,430 --> 01:15:21,440
chart
 

4143
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:25,110
chart
it was more about short-term effects

4144
01:15:25,110 --> 01:15:25,120
it was more about short-term effects
 

4145
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,750
it was more about short-term effects
uh yes it's again it's the idea of using

4146
01:15:27,750 --> 01:15:27,760
uh yes it's again it's the idea of using
 

4147
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,990
uh yes it's again it's the idea of using
uh military force to solve political

4148
01:15:29,990 --> 01:15:30,000
uh military force to solve political
 

4149
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,830
uh military force to solve political
problems um and i think there's a

4150
01:15:31,830 --> 01:15:31,840
problems um and i think there's a
 

4151
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:34,390
problems um and i think there's a
squandering of of goodwill that people

4152
01:15:34,390 --> 01:15:34,400
squandering of of goodwill that people
 

4153

01:15:37,830 --> 01:15:37,840
states um you know that's a
 

4157
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:40,550
states um you know that's a
respect for uh you know for its economy

4158
01:15:40,550 --> 01:15:40,560
respect for uh you know for its economy
 

4159

for its consumer products and so forth
 

4161
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:44,709
for its consumer products and so forth
and i think that's um uh that's been

4162
01:15:44,709 --> 01:15:44,719
and i think that's um uh that's been
 

4163
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:46,790
and i think that's um uh that's been
lost a lot of that do you think leaders

but
that we

01:20:15,669 --> 01:20:15,679
that we
 

4409
01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:18,070
that we
are fundamentally one society one

um
then

4440
01:20:51,189 --> 01:20:51,199
then
 

4441
01:20:51,199 --> 01:20:52,870
then
if you actually look throughout human

01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:03,350
as contentious as they've recently been
so there's a kind of perception has been

4450
01:21:03,350 --> 01:21:03,360
so there's a kind of perception has been
 

4451
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:05,669
so there's a kind of perception has been
very close and there's

machine of division
 

4459
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:14,790
machine of division
has that often been the case it has we

4460
01:21:14,790 --> 01:21:14,800
has that often been the case it has we
 

4461
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,470
has that often been the case it has we
are um

4462
01:21:16,470 --> 01:21:16,480
are um

right now is is different um and there
 

4467
01:21:20,239 --> 01:21:22,070
right now is is different um and there
it's worth distinguishing

4468
01:21:22,070 --> 01:21:22,080
it's worth distinguishing
 

4469
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:24,470
it's worth distinguishing
you know are there deep social or

partisanship in particular sort of the

4476
01:21:30,630 --> 01:21:30,640
partisanship in particular sort of the
 

4477
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:33,030
partisanship in particular sort of the
rivalry between the two parties and it's

4478
01:21:33,030 --> 01:21:33,040
rivalry between the two parties and it's
 

4479
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:36,070
rivalry between the two parties and it's
very clear that we are in an era of what

4480
01:21:36,070 --> 01:21:36,080
very clear that we are in an era of what
 

4481
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:37,669
very clear that we are in an era of what
we what political scientists call

01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:39,280
hyperpartisanship
 

4485
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:40,709
hyperpartisanship
right and that the two parties have

4486
01:21:40,709 --> 01:21:40,719
right and that the two parties have
 

4487
01:21:40,719 --> 01:21:42,950
right and that the two parties have
taken sort of

4488
01:21:42,950 --> 01:21:42,960
taken sort of
 

4489
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:45,110
taken sort of
fundamentally different positions and

4490
01:21:45,110 --> 01:21:45,120
fundamentally different positions and
 

4491
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:46,470
fundamentally different positions and
moved further

4492
01:21:46,470 --> 01:21:46,480
moved further
 

4493
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:49,189
moved further
you know apart from one another

4494
01:21:49,189 --> 01:21:49,199
you know apart from one another
 

4495
01:21:49,199 --> 01:21:52,149
you know apart from one another
and um you know and that is

4496
01:21:52,149 --> 01:21:52,159
and um you know and that is
 

4497
01:21:52,159 --> 01:21:53,990
and um you know and that is
what i think people talk about when they

4498
01:21:53,990 --> 01:21:54,000
what i think people talk about when they
 

4499
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,470
what i think people talk about when they
say our country is divided so the

4500
01:21:56,470 --> 01:21:56,480
say our country is divided so the
 

4501
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,229
say our country is divided so the
country may not be divided even if our

4502
01:21:58,229 --> 01:21:58,239
country may not be divided even if our
 

4503
01:21:58,239 --> 01:22:00,470
country may not be divided even if our
politics are highly partisan

4504
01:22:00,470 --> 01:22:00,480
politics are highly partisan
 

4505
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:02,950
politics are highly partisan
that is uh you know a divergence from

4506
01:22:02,950 --> 01:22:02,960
that is uh you know a divergence from
 

4507
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:05,510
that is uh you know a divergence from
from other time periods in our history

4508
01:22:05,510 --> 01:22:05,520
from other time periods in our history
 

4509
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:08,830
from other time periods in our history
so i wonder if this kind of political

4510
01:22:08,830 --> 01:22:08,840
so i wonder if this kind of political
 

4511
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:10,470
so i wonder if this kind of political
partisanship

4512
01:22:10,470 --> 01:22:10,480
partisanship
 

4513
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:11,669
partisanship
is actually

4514
01:22:11,669 --> 01:22:11,679
is actually
 

4515
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:14,310
is actually
an illusion of division

4516
01:22:14,310 --> 01:22:14,320
an illusion of division
 

4517
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:17,030
an illusion of division
i sometimes feel like

4518
01:22:17,030 --> 01:22:17,040
i sometimes feel like
 

4519
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:19,510
i sometimes feel like
we mostly all agree

4520
01:22:19,510 --> 01:22:19,520
we mostly all agree
 

4521
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:22,550
we mostly all agree
on some basic fundamentals

4522
01:22:22,550 --> 01:22:22,560
on some basic fundamentals
 

4523
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:25,910
on some basic fundamentals
and and the things that people allegedly

4524
01:22:25,910 --> 01:22:25,920
and and the things that people allegedly
 

4525
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:28,070
and and the things that people allegedly
disagree on are really blown out of

4526
01:22:28,070 --> 01:22:28,080
disagree on are really blown out of
 

4527
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:30,149
disagree on are really blown out of
proportion and there's like a media

4528
01:22:30,149 --> 01:22:30,159
proportion and there's like a media
 

4529
01:22:30,159 --> 01:22:32,149
proportion and there's like a media
machine and the politicians really want

4530
01:22:32,149 --> 01:22:32,159
machine and the politicians really want
 

4531
01:22:32,159 --> 01:22:34,950
machine and the politicians really want
you to pick a a blue side and a red side

4532
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:34,960
you to pick a a blue side and a red side
 

4533
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:36,390
you to pick a a blue side and a red side
and because of that

4534
01:22:36,390 --> 01:22:36,400
and because of that
 

4535
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:39,350
and because of that
somehow i mean families break up over

4536
01:22:39,350 --> 01:22:39,360
somehow i mean families break up over
 

4537
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:41,590
somehow i mean families break up over
thanksgiving dinner about who they voted

4538
01:22:41,590 --> 01:22:41,600
thanksgiving dinner about who they voted
 

4539
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:43,990
thanksgiving dinner about who they voted
for there's a really strong pressure to

for there's a really strong pressure to
 

4541
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,229

and
 

4545
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:50,070
and
i wonder if that's a feature or a bug

4546
01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:50,080
i wonder if that's a feature or a bug
 

4547
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:51,830
i wonder if that's a feature or a bug
whether this is just part of the

4548
01:22:51,830 --> 01:22:51,840
whether this is just part of the
 

4549
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:54,550
whether this is just part of the
mechanism of democracy that we want to

01:22:54,550 --> 01:22:54,560
mechanism of democracy that we want to

even if there's not a real thing to be
 

4553
01:22:56,239 --> 01:22:58,149
even if there's not a real thing to be
divided over we need to construct it

4554
01:22:58,149 --> 01:22:58,159
divided over we need to construct it
 

4555
01:22:58,159 --> 01:23:00,229
divided over we need to construct it
such that you can always have a tension

in order to
 

4561
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:06,149
in order to
make progress to figure out how to

4562
01:23:06,149 --> 01:23:06,159
make progress to figure out how to
 

4563
01:23:06,159 --> 01:23:08,390
make progress to figure out how to
progress as a nation

4564

progress as a nation
 

4565
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:10,149
progress as a nation
i think we're figuring that out in real

4566
01:23:10,149 --> 01:23:10,159
i think we're figuring that out in real
 

4567
01:23:10,159 --> 01:23:12,470
i think we're figuring that out in real
time right on the one hand it's uh it's

4568
01:23:12,470 --> 01:23:12,480
time right on the one hand it's uh it's
 

4569
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:15,510
time right on the one hand it's uh it's
easy to say that it's a feature of uh of

4570
01:23:15,510 --> 01:23:15,520
easy to say that it's a feature of uh of
 

4571
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:17,270
easy to say that it's a feature of uh of
a political system

4572
01:23:17,270 --> 01:23:17,280
a political system
 

4573
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:20,390
a political system
that has two parties right and the

4574
01:23:20,390 --> 01:23:20,400
that has two parties right and the
 

4575
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:22,470
that has two parties right and the
united states is in some ways unique

4576
01:23:22,470 --> 01:23:22,480
united states is in some ways unique
 

4577
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:24,310
united states is in some ways unique
right in

4578
01:23:24,310 --> 01:23:24,320
right in
 

4579
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:26,310
right in
in not being a parliamentary democracy

4580
01:23:26,310 --> 01:23:26,320
in not being a parliamentary democracy

in not being a parliamentary democracy
and so in some ways it you would think

4582
01:23:28,550 --> 01:23:28,560
and so in some ways it you would think
 

4583
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:30,070
and so in some ways it you would think
that would be the feature that is

4584
01:23:30,070 --> 01:23:30,080
that would be the feature that is
 

4585
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:31,430
that would be the feature that is
causing

4586
01:23:31,430 --> 01:23:31,440
causing
 

4587
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:33,590
causing
uh partisanship and to reach these

uh partisanship and to reach these
heights

4590
01:23:34,950 --> 01:23:34,960
heights
 

4591
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:36,470
heights
that said

4592
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:36,480
that said
 

4593
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:37,830
that said

and in which you know in both cases
 

4795
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:24,149
and in which you know in both cases
the feeling is

the feeling is
 

4797
01:27:24,159 --> 01:27:25,830
the feeling is
my

counted right
 

4803
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:33,750
counted right
but the deeper concern is

4804
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:33,760
but the deeper concern is
 

4805
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:36,229
but the deeper concern is
my my vote doesn't count you know my

there's a comfort to the story that
they're not rigged

they're not rigged
 

4823

01:27:52,470 --> 01:27:52,480
and a lot of us like to live in comfort
 

4825
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:54,950
and a lot of us like to live in comfort
so people who articulate conspiracy

4826
01:27:54,950 --> 01:27:54,960
so people who articulate conspiracy
 

4827
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:56,790
so people who articulate conspiracy
theories say sure it's nice to be

4828
01:27:56,790 --> 01:27:56,800
theories say sure it's nice to be
 

4829
01:27:56,800 --> 01:28:00,229
theories say sure it's nice to be
comfortable but here's the reality and

4830
01:28:00,229 --> 01:28:00,239
comfortable but here's the reality and
 

4831
01:28:00,239 --> 01:28:01,750
comfortable but here's the reality and
the thing they articulate is there's

4832
01:28:01,750 --> 01:28:01,760
the thing they articulate is there's
 

4833
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:04,470
the thing they articulate is there's
incentives in close elections which we

4834
01:28:04,470 --> 01:28:04,480
incentives in close elections which we
 

4835
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:06,709
incentives in close elections which we
seem to have non-stop close elections

4836
01:28:06,709 --> 01:28:06,719
seem to have non-stop close elections
 

4837
01:28:06,719 --> 01:28:08,629
seem to have non-stop close elections
there's so many financial interests

4838
01:28:08,629 --> 01:28:08,639
there's so many financial interests
 

4839
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:10,870
there's so many financial interests
there's so many powerful people

4840

there's so many powerful people
 

4841
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:14,070
there's so many powerful people
surely you can construct not just with

4842
01:28:14,070 --> 01:28:14,080
surely you can construct not just with
 

4843
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,750
surely you can construct not just with
the media

4844
01:28:15,750 --> 01:28:15,760
the media
 

4845
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:17,189
the media
and all the ways you describe both on

4846
01:28:17,189 --> 01:28:17,199
and all the ways you describe both on
 

4847
01:28:17,199 --> 01:28:18,550
and all the ways you describe both on
the left and the right the elections

4848
01:28:18,550 --> 01:28:18,560
the left and the right the elections
 

4849
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:21,430
the left and the right the elections
could be rigged but literally

4850
01:28:21,430 --> 01:28:21,440
could be rigged but literally
 

4851
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:22,790
could be rigged but literally
actually

4852
01:28:22,790 --> 01:28:22,800
actually
 

4853
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:23,750
actually
in a

4854
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:23,760
in a
 

4855
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:26,790
in a
fully illegal way

4856
01:28:26,790 --> 01:28:26,800
fully illegal way
 

4857
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:28,629
fully illegal way
manipulate the results of

4858
01:28:28,629 --> 01:28:28,639
manipulate the results of
 

4859
01:28:28,639 --> 01:28:30,070
manipulate the results of
votes

4860
01:28:30,070 --> 01:28:30,080
votes
 

4861
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:33,110
votes
surely there's incentive to do that

4862
01:28:33,110 --> 01:28:33,120
surely there's incentive to do that
 

4863
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:33,990
surely there's incentive to do that
and

4864
01:28:33,990 --> 01:28:34,000
and
 

4865
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,310
and
i don't think that's

4866
01:28:36,310 --> 01:28:36,320
i don't think that's
 

4867
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:38,470
i don't think that's
uh that's a totally ridiculous argument

4868
01:28:38,470 --> 01:28:38,480
uh that's a totally ridiculous argument
 

4869
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:40,470
uh that's a totally ridiculous argument
because it's like all right well

4870
01:28:40,470 --> 01:28:40,480
because it's like all right well
 

4871
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:43,590
because it's like all right well
um i mean it actually lands

4872
01:28:43,590 --> 01:28:43,600
um i mean it actually lands
 

4873
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:45,990
um i mean it actually lands
to the question

4874
01:28:45,990 --> 01:28:46,000
to the question
 

4875
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,669
to the question
uh which is a hard question for me to

4876
01:28:47,669 --> 01:28:47,679
uh which is a hard question for me to
 

4877
01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:50,470
uh which is a hard question for me to
ask us ultimately as an optimist

4878
01:28:50,470 --> 01:28:50,480
ask us ultimately as an optimist
 

4879
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:51,189
ask us ultimately as an optimist
of

4880
01:28:51,189 --> 01:28:51,199
of
 

4881
01:28:51,199 --> 01:28:53,510
of
how many malevolent people out there and

4882
01:28:53,510 --> 01:28:53,520
how many malevolent people out there and
 

4883
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:56,470
how many malevolent people out there and
how many malevolent people are required

4884
01:28:56,470 --> 01:28:56,480
how many malevolent people are required
 

4885
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:58,550
how many malevolent people are required
to rig an election

4886

to rig an election
 

4887
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:01,510
to rig an election
so how many what is the face transition

4888
01:29:01,510 --> 01:29:01,520
so how many what is the face transition
 

4889
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:04,790
so how many what is the face transition
for a system to become from like uh

4890
01:29:04,790 --> 01:29:04,800
for a system to become from like uh
 

4891
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:07,669
for a system to become from like uh
corruption light to corruption

4892
01:29:07,669 --> 01:29:07,679
corruption light to corruption
 

4893
01:29:07,679 --> 01:29:09,990
corruption light to corruption
uh to high level of corruption such that

4894
01:29:09,990 --> 01:29:10,000
uh to high level of corruption such that
 

4895
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,310
uh to high level of corruption such that
you could do things like regulations

4896
01:29:12,310 --> 01:29:12,320
you could do things like regulations
 

4897
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:15,430
you could do things like regulations
which is what happens

4898
01:29:15,430 --> 01:29:15,440
which is what happens
 

4899
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:18,470
which is what happens
quite a lot in many nations in um in the

4900
01:29:18,470 --> 01:29:18,480
quite a lot in many nations in um in the
 

4901
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:19,910
quite a lot in many nations in um in the
world even today

4902
01:29:19,910 --> 01:29:19,920
world even today
 

4903
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:21,990
world even today
so yes there is interference in

4904
01:29:21,990 --> 01:29:22,000
so yes there is interference in
 

4905
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,830
so yes there is interference in
elections and there has been in american

4906
01:29:23,830 --> 01:29:23,840
elections and there has been in american
 

4907
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:25,430
elections and there has been in american
history right and we can go all the way

4908
01:29:25,430 --> 01:29:25,440
history right and we can go all the way
 

4909
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:27,910
history right and we can go all the way
back into the the you know into the 18th

4910
01:29:27,910 --> 01:29:27,920
back into the the you know into the 18th
 

4911
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:30,229
back into the the you know into the 18th
century um you don't have to go back to

4912
01:29:30,229 --> 01:29:30,239
century um you don't have to go back to
 

4913
01:29:30,239 --> 01:29:34,550
century um you don't have to go back to
you know texas in the 1960s uh at lbj to

4914
01:29:34,550 --> 01:29:34,560
you know texas in the 1960s uh at lbj to
 

4915
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:37,350
you know texas in the 1960s uh at lbj to
to find examples of of direct

4916
01:29:37,350 --> 01:29:37,360
to find examples of of direct

interference in the outcome of elections
 

4919
01:29:39,199 --> 01:29:41,510
interference in the outcome of elections
and there are incentives to do that

4920
01:29:41,510 --> 01:29:41,520
and there are incentives to do that
 

4921
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:45,030
and there are incentives to do that
those incentives will only feel more

4922
01:29:45,030 --> 01:29:45,040
those incentives will only feel more
 

4923
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:46,550
those incentives will only feel more

right i'm saying like you know this is
something that we need to to do and to

01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:05,990
sufficiently robust
even if there is corruption even if

5049
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:07,990
that's that's your
that's your current belief uh

5050
01:32:07,990 --> 01:32:08,000
that's your current belief uh
 

5051
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,910
that's your current belief uh
yes as of today

5052
01:32:09,910 --> 01:32:09,920
yes as of today
 

5053
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:12,390
yes as of today
but i do you know i do think that those

5054
01:32:12,390 --> 01:32:12,400
but i do you know i do think that those
 

5055
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:16,310
but i do you know i do think that those
um you know the that will require um

5056
01:32:16,310 --> 01:32:16,320
um you know the that will require um
 

5057
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:19,750
um you know the that will require um
oversight by institutions ideally

5058
01:32:19,750 --> 01:32:19,760
oversight by institutions ideally
 

5059
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:21,590
oversight by institutions ideally
ones that are insulated as much as

5060
01:32:21,590 --> 01:32:21,600
ones that are insulated as much as
 

5061
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:23,350
ones that are insulated as much as
possible from partisan politics which is

5062
01:32:23,350 --> 01:32:23,360
possible from partisan politics which is
 

5063
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:25,030
possible from partisan politics which is
very difficult right now

5064
01:32:25,030 --> 01:32:25,040
very difficult right now
 

5065
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:27,510
very difficult right now
um and it will require uh

5066
01:32:27,510 --> 01:32:27,520
um and it will require uh
 

5067
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:29,590
um and it will require uh
the demands of of the american people

5068
01:32:29,590 --> 01:32:29,600
the demands of of the american people
 

5069
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:31,910
the demands of of the american people
and that they you know that they want um

5070
01:32:31,910 --> 01:32:31,920
and that they you know that they want um
 

5071
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:33,750
and that they you know that they want um
these elections to be

5072
01:32:33,750 --> 01:32:33,760
these elections to be
 

5073
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:35,669
these elections to be
to be fair and secure

5074
01:32:35,669 --> 01:32:35,679
to be fair and secure
 

5075
01:32:35,679 --> 01:32:38,709
to be fair and secure
and that means you know that means

5076
01:32:38,709 --> 01:32:38,719
and that means you know that means
 

5077
01:32:38,719 --> 01:32:41,030
and that means you know that means
being willing to lose them you know

5078
01:32:41,030 --> 01:32:41,040
being willing to lose them you know
 

5079
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:42,790
being willing to lose them you know
regardless of which which party you're

5080
01:32:42,790 --> 01:32:42,800
regardless of which which party you're
 

5081
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:44,310
regardless of which which party you're
you're in favor of so what do you think

5082
01:32:44,310 --> 01:32:44,320
you're in favor of so what do you think
 

5083
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:46,470
you're in favor of so what do you think
about the power of the media to create

5084
01:32:46,470 --> 01:32:46,480
about the power of the media to create
 

5085
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:49,030
about the power of the media to create
partisanship i'm really worried that

5086
01:32:49,030 --> 01:32:49,040
partisanship i'm really worried that
 

5087
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:50,790
partisanship i'm really worried that
there's a huge incentive speaking of

5088
01:32:50,790 --> 01:32:50,800
there's a huge incentive speaking of
 

5089
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:54,870
there's a huge incentive speaking of
incentives to divide the country in the

5090
01:32:54,870 --> 01:32:54,880
incentives to divide the country in the
 

5091
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:56,950
incentives to divide the country in the
in the media and the politicians i'm not

5092
01:32:56,950 --> 01:32:56,960
in the media and the politicians i'm not
 

5093
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:58,629
in the media and the politicians i'm not
sure where it originates but it feels

5094
01:32:58,629 --> 01:32:58,639
sure where it originates but it feels
 

5095
01:32:58,639 --> 01:33:01,189
sure where it originates but it feels
like it's the media maybe it's a very

5096
01:33:01,189 --> 01:33:01,199
like it's the media maybe it's a very
 

5097
01:33:01,199 --> 01:33:03,510
like it's the media maybe it's a very
cynical perspective on journalism but

5098
01:33:03,510 --> 01:33:03,520
cynical perspective on journalism but
 

5099
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:05,910
cynical perspective on journalism but
it seems like if we're angry and divided

5100
01:33:05,910 --> 01:33:05,920
it seems like if we're angry and divided
 

5101
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:08,149
it seems like if we're angry and divided
as evenly as possible you're going to

5102
01:33:08,149 --> 01:33:08,159
as evenly as possible you're going to
 

5103
01:33:08,159 --> 01:33:10,149
as evenly as possible you're going to
maximize the number of clicks

5104
01:33:10,149 --> 01:33:10,159
maximize the number of clicks
 

5105
01:33:10,159 --> 01:33:11,990
maximize the number of clicks
so it's almost like the media wants to

5106
01:33:11,990 --> 01:33:12,000
so it's almost like the media wants to
 

5107
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,270
so it's almost like the media wants to
elect people that are going to be the

5108
01:33:13,270 --> 01:33:13,280
elect people that are going to be the
 

5109
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:14,870
elect people that are going to be the
most uh

5110
01:33:14,870 --> 01:33:14,880
most uh
 

5111
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:17,590
most uh
divisive maximizing

5112
01:33:17,590 --> 01:33:17,600
divisive maximizing
 

5113
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:18,870
divisive maximizing
and

5114
01:33:18,870 --> 01:33:18,880
and
 

5115
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:21,189
and
the worry i have

5116
01:33:21,189 --> 01:33:21,199
the worry i have
 

5117
01:33:21,199 --> 01:33:22,390
the worry i have
is they

5118
01:33:22,390 --> 01:33:22,400
is they
 

5119
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:24,629
is they
are not beyond

5120
01:33:24,629 --> 01:33:24,639
are not beyond
 

5121
01:33:24,639 --> 01:33:27,030
are not beyond
either feeding or if you want to be very

5122
01:33:27,030 --> 01:33:27,040
either feeding or if you want to be very
 

5123
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:29,669
either feeding or if you want to be very
cynical manufacturing narratives

5124
01:33:29,669 --> 01:33:29,679
cynical manufacturing narratives
 

5125
01:33:29,679 --> 01:33:32,149
cynical manufacturing narratives
that lead that division like the

5126
01:33:32,149 --> 01:33:32,159
that lead that division like the
 

5127
01:33:32,159 --> 01:33:34,550
that lead that division like the
narrative of an election being rigged

5128
01:33:34,550 --> 01:33:34,560
narrative of an election being rigged
 

5129
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:36,149
narrative of an election being rigged
because if you convinced half the

5130
01:33:36,149 --> 01:33:36,159
because if you convinced half the
 

5131
01:33:36,159 --> 01:33:37,590
because if you convinced half the
populace that the election was

5132
01:33:37,590 --> 01:33:37,600
populace that the election was
 

5133
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:39,270
populace that the election was
completely rigged

5134
01:33:39,270 --> 01:33:39,280
completely rigged
 

5135
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:41,030
completely rigged
that's a really good way

5136
01:33:41,030 --> 01:33:41,040
that's a really good way
 

5137
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:42,950
that's a really good way
to get a lot of clicks

5138
01:33:42,950 --> 01:33:42,960
to get a lot of clicks
 

5139
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:44,229
to get a lot of clicks
and and like

5140
01:33:44,229 --> 01:33:44,239
and and like
 

5141
01:33:44,239 --> 01:33:46,229
and and like
the very cynical view

5142
01:33:46,229 --> 01:33:46,239
the very cynical view
 

5143
01:33:46,239 --> 01:33:51,270
the very cynical view
is i don't know if the media machine

5144
01:33:51,270 --> 01:33:51,280

 

5145
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:53,189

will stop the destruction of our

5146
01:33:53,189 --> 01:33:53,199
will stop the destruction of our
 

5147
01:33:53,199 --> 01:33:55,750
will stop the destruction of our
democracy

5148
01:33:55,750 --> 01:33:55,760
democracy
 

5149
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:59,430
democracy
uh in service of getting more clicks

5150
01:33:59,430 --> 01:33:59,440
uh in service of getting more clicks
 

5151
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:02,149
uh in service of getting more clicks
it may destroy our entire democracy just

5152
01:34:02,149 --> 01:34:02,159
it may destroy our entire democracy just
 

5153
01:34:02,159 --> 01:34:04,629
it may destroy our entire democracy just
to get more clicks just uh because the

5154
01:34:04,629 --> 01:34:04,639
to get more clicks just uh because the
 

5155
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:07,510
to get more clicks just uh because the
fire as the thing burns down

5156
01:34:07,510 --> 01:34:07,520
fire as the thing burns down
 

5157
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:09,270
fire as the thing burns down
uh will get clicks

5158
01:34:09,270 --> 01:34:09,280
uh will get clicks
 

5159
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:11,189
uh will get clicks
is am i putting too much blame on the

5160
01:34:11,189 --> 01:34:11,199
is am i putting too much blame on the
 

5161
01:34:11,199 --> 01:34:12,470
is am i putting too much blame on the
media here

5162
01:34:12,470 --> 01:34:12,480
media here
 

5163
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:15,030
media here
um the machine of it you're diagnosing

5164
01:34:15,030 --> 01:34:15,040
um the machine of it you're diagnosing
 

5165
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:17,510
um the machine of it you're diagnosing
the incentive structure um you know

5166
01:34:17,510 --> 01:34:17,520
the incentive structure um you know
 

5167
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:21,910
the incentive structure um you know
you're depicting that with 100 accuracy

5168
01:34:21,910 --> 01:34:21,920
you're depicting that with 100 accuracy
 

5169
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:25,110
you're depicting that with 100 accuracy
but uh i think history teaches that you

5170
01:34:25,110 --> 01:34:25,120
but uh i think history teaches that you
 

5171
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:27,350
but uh i think history teaches that you
might be giving the media too much

5172
01:34:27,350 --> 01:34:27,360
might be giving the media too much
 

5173
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:30,790
might be giving the media too much
sort of causal power

5174
01:34:30,790 --> 01:34:30,800
sort of causal power
 

5175
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:32,550
sort of causal power
that uh you know that the american

5176
01:34:32,550 --> 01:34:32,560
that uh you know that the american
 

5177
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:35,030
that uh you know that the american
people are smarter than the media that

5178
01:34:35,030 --> 01:34:35,040
people are smarter than the media that
 

5179
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:37,590
people are smarter than the media that
they consume right and um you know and

5180
01:34:37,590 --> 01:34:37,600
they consume right and um you know and
 

5181
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:39,750
they consume right and um you know and
even even today we we know that right

5182
01:34:39,750 --> 01:34:39,760
even even today we we know that right
 

5183
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:41,590
even even today we we know that right
people who consume

5184
01:34:41,590 --> 01:34:41,600
people who consume
 

5185
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:43,430
people who consume
you know even people who consume just

5186
01:34:43,430 --> 01:34:43,440
you know even people who consume just
 

5187
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:46,310
you know even people who consume just
fox or just msnbc

5188
01:34:46,310 --> 01:34:46,320
fox or just msnbc
 

5189
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:49,510
fox or just msnbc
know what they're consuming right

5190
01:34:49,510 --> 01:34:49,520
know what they're consuming right
 

5191
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:51,990
know what they're consuming right
and you know so i don't think that media

5192
01:34:51,990 --> 01:34:52,000
and you know so i don't think that media
 

5193
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,270
and you know so i don't think that media
will be

5194
01:34:53,270 --> 01:34:53,280
will be
 

5195
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:55,590
will be
the solution

5196
01:34:55,590 --> 01:34:55,600
the solution
 

5197
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:56,950
the solution
and i certainly don't think that

5198
01:34:56,950 --> 01:34:56,960
and i certainly don't think that
 

5199
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:58,870
and i certainly don't think that

which requires us to scrutinize the

01:43:07,270 --> 01:43:07,280
which requires us to scrutinize the
 

5665
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:08,870
which requires us to scrutinize the
structure of the platform and access to

it's a
it's a medium plus

5676
01:43:16,950 --> 01:43:16,960
it's a medium plus
 

5677
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:20,550
it's a medium plus
it's a medium that enables virality

5678

that benefits from virality of
 

5681
01:43:22,719 --> 01:43:25,350
that benefits from virality of
engagement and that means

5682
01:43:25,350 --> 01:43:25,360
engagement and that means
 

5683
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:28,070
engagement and that means
singular voices

5684
01:43:28,070 --> 01:43:28,080
singular voices
 

5685
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:29,189
singular voices
uh can

5686
01:43:29,189 --> 01:43:29,199
uh can
 

5687

uh can
can have a disproportionate impact

5688
01:43:31,830 --> 01:43:31,840
can have a disproportionate impact
 

5689
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:35,350
can have a disproportionate impact
like uh not even voices singular ideas

5690
01:43:35,350 --> 01:43:35,360
like uh not even voices singular ideas
 

5691
01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:36,629
like uh not even voices singular ideas
dramatic ideas can have a

dramatic ideas can have a
 

5693
01:43:36,639 --> 01:43:38,790
dramatic ideas can have a
disproportionate impact and so

5694
01:43:38,790 --> 01:43:38,800
disproportionate impact and so
 

5695
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:40,790
disproportionate impact and so
that actually threatens

5696
01:43:40,790 --> 01:43:40,800
that actually threatens
 

5697
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:42,790
that actually threatens
it's almost like i don't know what the

about um you know uh four centuries
later so one of the the things that you

5964
01:48:21,189 --> 01:48:21,199
later so one of the the things that you
 

5965
01:48:21,199 --> 01:48:23,669
later so one of the the things that you
know at least my understanding is that

5966
01:48:23,669 --> 01:48:23,679
know at least my understanding is that
 

5967
01:48:23,679 --> 01:48:26,229

um and that
 

5973
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:33,270
um and that
is one of the most valuable sources that

5974
01:48:33,270 --> 01:48:33,280
is one of the most valuable sources that
 

5975
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:36,149
is one of the most valuable sources that
historians will use um to understand

5976
01:48:36,149 --> 01:48:36,159
historians will use um to understand
 

5977
01:48:36,159 --> 01:48:38,310
historians will use um to understand
that the era and parts of it were sort

5978
01:48:38,310 --> 01:48:38,320
that the era and parts of it were sort
 

5979
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:40,470
that the era and parts of it were sort
of you know uh archived and

5980
01:48:40,470 --> 01:48:40,480
of you know uh archived and

01:48:42,480 --> 01:48:44,310
reconstructed but uh you know but in
that sense i think that that is also a

5984
01:48:44,310 --> 01:48:44,320
that sense i think that that is also a
 

5985
01:48:44,320 --> 01:48:45,189
that sense i think that that is also a
real

5986
01:48:45,189 --> 01:48:45,199
real

but one of the sad things from a
 

6017
01:49:17,360 --> 01:49:18,950
but one of the sad things from a
historian perspective is how few

6018
01:49:18,950 --> 01:49:18,960

6019
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:21,590

and
that's such a difficult thing because

01:49:26,870 --> 01:49:26,880
that's such a difficult thing because
 

6027
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:28,470
that's such a difficult thing because
it's obvious that talking to donald

6028
01:49:28,470 --> 01:49:28,480
it's obvious that talking to donald
 

6029
01:49:28,480 --> 01:49:29,990
it's obvious that talking to donald
trump

6030
01:49:29,990 --> 01:49:30,000
trump
 

6031
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,310
trump
that talking to xi jinping

6032
01:49:32,310 --> 01:49:32,320
that talking to xi jinping
 

6033
01:49:32,320 --> 01:49:34,390
that talking to xi jinping
talking to putin

6034
01:49:34,390 --> 01:49:34,400
talking to putin
 

6035
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:36,229
talking to putin
is really valuable from a historical

6036
01:49:36,229 --> 01:49:36,239
is really valuable from a historical
 

6037
01:49:36,239 --> 01:49:38,470
is really valuable from a historical
perspective to understand

6038
01:49:38,470 --> 01:49:38,480
perspective to understand
 

6039
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:39,669
perspective to understand
but then

6040
01:49:39,669 --> 01:49:39,679
but then
 

6041
01:49:39,679 --> 01:49:42,070
but then
you think about the momentary impact of

6042
01:49:42,070 --> 01:49:42,080
you think about the momentary impact of
 

6043
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:44,629
you think about the momentary impact of
such a conversation and you think

6044
01:49:44,629 --> 01:49:44,639
such a conversation and you think
 

6045
01:49:44,639 --> 01:49:46,229
such a conversation and you think
well depending on how the conversation

6046
01:49:46,229 --> 01:49:46,239
well depending on how the conversation
 

6047
01:49:46,239 --> 01:49:49,590
well depending on how the conversation
goes you can steer

6048
01:49:49,590 --> 01:49:49,600
goes you can steer
 

6049
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:50,550
goes you can steer
or

6050
01:49:50,550 --> 01:49:50,560
or
 

6051
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:52,310
or
flame

6052
01:49:52,310 --> 01:49:52,320
flame
 

6053
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:54,470
flame
what does it feed the flame

6054
01:49:54,470 --> 01:49:54,480
what does it feed the flame
 

6055
01:49:54,480 --> 01:49:58,390
what does it feed the flame
of war or conflict or um

6056
01:49:58,390 --> 01:49:58,400
of war or conflict or um
 

6057
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:00,950
of war or conflict or um
abuses of power and things like this

6058
01:50:00,950 --> 01:50:00,960
abuses of power and things like this
 

6059
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:03,109
abuses of power and things like this
and that's i think the tension between

6060
01:50:03,109 --> 01:50:03,119
and that's i think the tension between
 

6061
01:50:03,119 --> 01:50:07,109
and that's i think the tension between
the journalists and the historian

6062
01:50:07,109 --> 01:50:07,119

 

6063
01:50:07,119 --> 01:50:08,550

because when journalists interview

6064
01:50:08,550 --> 01:50:08,560
because when journalists interview
 

6065
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:10,709
because when journalists interview
dictators for example

6066
01:50:10,709 --> 01:50:10,719
dictators for example
 

6067
01:50:10,719 --> 01:50:13,350
dictators for example
one of the things that strikes me

6068
01:50:13,350 --> 01:50:13,360
one of the things that strikes me
 

6069
01:50:13,360 --> 01:50:16,550
one of the things that strikes me
is they're often

6070
01:50:16,550 --> 01:50:16,560

 

6071
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:19,270

very critical of the dictator

6072
01:50:19,270 --> 01:50:19,280
very critical of the dictator
 

6073
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:22,070
very critical of the dictator
they're they're like

6074
01:50:22,070 --> 01:50:22,080
they're they're like
 

6075
01:50:22,080 --> 01:50:23,270
they're they're like
they're basically attacking them in

6076
01:50:23,270 --> 01:50:23,280
they're basically attacking them in
 

6077
01:50:23,280 --> 01:50:25,109
they're basically attacking them in
front of their face

6078
01:50:25,109 --> 01:50:25,119
front of their face
 

6079
01:50:25,119 --> 01:50:27,189
front of their face
as opposed to trying to understand

6080
01:50:27,189 --> 01:50:27,199
as opposed to trying to understand
 

6081
01:50:27,199 --> 01:50:29,109
as opposed to trying to understand
because what i perceive they're doing is

6082
01:50:29,109 --> 01:50:29,119
because what i perceive they're doing is
 

6083
01:50:29,119 --> 01:50:31,030
because what i perceive they're doing is
they're signaling to

6084
01:50:31,030 --> 01:50:31,040
they're signaling to
 

6085
01:50:31,040 --> 01:50:32,709
they're signaling to
uh the other journalists that they're on

6086
01:50:32,709 --> 01:50:32,719
uh the other journalists that they're on
 

6087
01:50:32,719 --> 01:50:35,270
uh the other journalists that they're on
the right side of history kind of thing

6088
01:50:35,270 --> 01:50:35,280
the right side of history kind of thing
 

6089
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:37,270
the right side of history kind of thing
but that's not very productive and it's

6090
01:50:37,270 --> 01:50:37,280
but that's not very productive and it's
 

6091
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:38,390
but that's not very productive and it's
also why

6092
01:50:38,390 --> 01:50:38,400
also why
 

6093
01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:40,149
also why
the dictators and leaders often don't do

6094
01:50:40,149 --> 01:50:40,159
the dictators and leaders often don't do
 

6095
01:50:40,159 --> 01:50:41,590
the dictators and leaders often don't do
those interviews

6096
01:50:41,590 --> 01:50:41,600
those interviews
 

6097
01:50:41,600 --> 01:50:43,109
those interviews
it's not productive to understanding who

6098
01:50:43,109 --> 01:50:43,119
it's not productive to understanding who
 

6099
01:50:43,119 --> 01:50:44,790
it's not productive to understanding who
the human being is to understand you

6100
01:50:44,790 --> 01:50:44,800
the human being is to understand you
 

6101
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:46,550
the human being is to understand you
have to empathize

6102
01:50:46,550 --> 01:50:46,560
have to empathize
 

6103
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:48,550
have to empathize
um because

6104
01:50:48,550 --> 01:50:48,560
um because
 

6105
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:50,830
um because
few people i think few leaders do

6106
01:50:50,830 --> 01:50:50,840
few people i think few leaders do
 

6107
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:52,470
few people i think few leaders do
something

6108
01:50:52,470 --> 01:50:52,480
something
 

6109
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:54,629
something
from a place of malevolence i think they

6110
01:50:54,629 --> 01:50:54,639
from a place of malevolence i think they
 

6111
01:50:54,639 --> 01:50:57,350
from a place of malevolence i think they
really do think they're doing good

6112
01:50:57,350 --> 01:50:57,360
really do think they're doing good
 

6113
01:50:57,360 --> 01:50:59,510
really do think they're doing good
and not even for themselves not even for

and not even for themselves not even for
 

6115
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:01,030
and not even for themselves not even for
selfish reasons i think they're doing

6116
01:51:01,030 --> 01:51:01,040
selfish reasons i think they're doing
 

6117
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:02,229
selfish reasons i think they're doing
great for the

6118
01:51:02,229 --> 01:51:02,239
great for the
 

6119
01:51:02,239 --> 01:51:04,310
great for the
they're doing the right thing

6120
01:51:04,310 --> 01:51:04,320
they're doing the right thing
 

6121
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:06,310
they're doing the right thing
for their country

6122
01:51:06,310 --> 01:51:06,320
for their country
 

6123
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:08,149
for their country
or for whoever the group they're leading

6124
01:51:08,149 --> 01:51:08,159
or for whoever the group they're leading
 

6125
01:51:08,159 --> 01:51:10,149
or for whoever the group they're leading
and to understand that you have to

6126
01:51:10,149 --> 01:51:10,159
and to understand that you have to
 

6127
01:51:10,159 --> 01:51:13,109
and to understand that you have to
and and by the way a large percent of

6128
01:51:13,109 --> 01:51:13,119
and and by the way a large percent of
 

6129
01:51:13,119 --> 01:51:15,109
and and by the way a large percent of
the country often supports them

6130
01:51:15,109 --> 01:51:15,119
the country often supports them
 

6131
01:51:15,119 --> 01:51:17,109
the country often supports them
i bet if you pull

6132
01:51:17,109 --> 01:51:17,119
i bet if you pull
 

6133
01:51:17,119 --> 01:51:19,910
i bet if you pull
legitimately poor people in north korea

6134
01:51:19,910 --> 01:51:19,920
legitimately poor people in north korea
 

6135
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:22,149
legitimately poor people in north korea
they will believe that their leader is

6136
01:51:22,149 --> 01:51:22,159
they will believe that their leader is
 

6137
01:51:22,159 --> 01:51:25,270
they will believe that their leader is
doing the right thing for their country

6138
01:51:25,270 --> 01:51:25,280
doing the right thing for their country
 

6139
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:28,229
doing the right thing for their country
and so to understand that

6140
01:51:28,229 --> 01:51:28,239
and so to understand that
 

6141
01:51:28,239 --> 01:51:29,669
and so to understand that
you have to empathize so that's the

6142
01:51:29,669 --> 01:51:29,679
you have to empathize so that's the
 

6143
01:51:29,679 --> 01:51:31,590
you have to empathize so that's the
tension of the journalist i think and

6144
01:51:31,590 --> 01:51:31,600
tension of the journalist i think and
 

6145
01:51:31,600 --> 01:51:33,030
tension of the journalist i think and
the historian because obviously the

6146
01:51:33,030 --> 01:51:33,040
the historian because obviously the
 

6147
01:51:33,040 --> 01:51:34,950
the historian because obviously the
historian doesn't doesn't care they

6148
01:51:34,950 --> 01:51:34,960
historian doesn't doesn't care they
 

6149
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:37,109
historian doesn't doesn't care they
really want to but they care obviously

6150
01:51:37,109 --> 01:51:37,119
really want to but they care obviously
 

6151
01:51:37,119 --> 01:51:40,470
really want to but they care obviously
deeply but they they know that history

6152
01:51:40,470 --> 01:51:40,480
deeply but they they know that history
 

6153
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:42,390
deeply but they they know that history
requires deep understanding of the human

6154
01:51:42,390 --> 01:51:42,400
requires deep understanding of the human
 

6155
01:51:42,400 --> 01:51:45,350
requires deep understanding of the human
being in the full context

6156
01:51:45,350 --> 01:51:45,360
being in the full context
 

6157
01:51:45,360 --> 01:51:47,510
being in the full context
yeah it's a tough decision to make yeah

6158
01:51:47,510 --> 01:51:47,520
yeah it's a tough decision to make yeah
 

6159
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:49,510
yeah it's a tough decision to make yeah
well i think it's uh both for

6160
01:51:49,510 --> 01:51:49,520
well i think it's uh both for
 

6161
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:51,430
well i think it's uh both for
journalists and historians um the

01:51:51,430 --> 01:51:51,440
journalists and historians um the
 

6163
01:51:51,440 --> 01:51:54,310
journalists and historians um the
challenge is not to be too close to your

6164
01:51:54,310 --> 01:51:54,320
challenge is not to be too close to your
 

6165
01:51:54,320 --> 01:51:57,910
challenge is not to be too close to your
subject right um and you know not to be

6166
01:51:57,910 --> 01:51:57,920
subject right um and you know not to be

right you know when you're talking to a
living subject which historians do you

6172
01:52:05,270 --> 01:52:05,280
living subject which historians do you

01:52:07,109 --> 01:52:07,119
know um too
 

6175
01:52:07,119 --> 01:52:09,830
know um too
um you know it's it's a matter of making

6176
01:52:09,830 --> 01:52:09,840
um you know it's it's a matter of making
 

6177
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:12,310
um you know it's it's a matter of making
sure that you triangulate their story

6178
01:52:12,310 --> 01:52:12,320
sure that you triangulate their story
 

6179
01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:14,470
sure that you triangulate their story
with with the the rest of the record

6180
01:52:14,470 --> 01:52:14,480
with with the the rest of the record

right um
 

6183
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:18,229
right um
and that may paint a different picture

6184
01:52:18,229 --> 01:52:18,239
and that may paint a different picture
 

6185
01:52:18,239 --> 01:52:21,189
and that may paint a different picture
of of the person than um and will

whatever those feelings are
you can try to figure out by talking to

6274
01:53:51,910 --> 01:53:51,920
you can try to figure out by talking to
 

6275
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:54,629
you can try to figure out by talking to
people but also talking to the the

6276
01:53:54,629 --> 01:53:54,639
people but also talking to the the
 

6277
01:53:54,639 --> 01:53:55,669
people but also talking to the the
the man

6278
01:53:55,669 --> 01:53:55,679
the man
 

6279
01:53:55,679 --> 01:53:57,510
the man
and then seeing the interplay there what

6280
01:53:57,510 --> 01:53:57,520
and then seeing the interplay there what
 

6281
01:53:57,520 --> 01:53:59,589
and then seeing the interplay there what
does this really represent

6282
01:53:59,589 --> 01:53:59,599
does this really represent
 

6283
01:53:59,599 --> 01:54:01,990
does this really represent
in this period in history in this

6284
01:54:01,990 --> 01:54:02,000
in this period in history in this
 

6285
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:05,350
in this period in history in this
slice of the world um yeah ultimately

6286
01:54:05,350 --> 01:54:05,360
slice of the world um yeah ultimately
 

6287
01:54:05,360 --> 01:54:08,070
slice of the world um yeah ultimately
understanding i think leads to

6288
01:54:08,070 --> 01:54:08,080
understanding i think leads to
 

6289
01:54:08,080 --> 01:54:11,109
understanding i think leads to
compassion and love and unity which is

6290
01:54:11,109 --> 01:54:11,119
compassion and love and unity which is
 

6291
01:54:11,119 --> 01:54:12,709
compassion and love and unity which is
how this whole thing progresses the

6292
01:54:12,709 --> 01:54:12,719
how this whole thing progresses the
 

6293
01:54:12,719 --> 01:54:14,950
how this whole thing progresses the
tension between the different sides

6294
01:54:14,950 --> 01:54:14,960
tension between the different sides
 

6295
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:17,189
tension between the different sides
is useful to um

6296
01:54:17,189 --> 01:54:17,199
is useful to um
 

6297
01:54:17,199 --> 01:54:19,669
is useful to um
have a good conversation but ultimately

6298
01:54:19,669 --> 01:54:19,679
have a good conversation but ultimately
 

6299
01:54:19,679 --> 01:54:20,950
have a good conversation but ultimately
coming up with the right answer and

6300
01:54:20,950 --> 01:54:20,960
coming up with the right answer and
 

6301
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:22,790
coming up with the right answer and
progressing towards that answer is how

6302
01:54:22,790 --> 01:54:22,800
progressing towards that answer is how
 

6303
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:25,350
progressing towards that answer is how
you make progress

6304
01:54:25,350 --> 01:54:25,360
you make progress
 

6305
01:54:25,360 --> 01:54:28,390
you make progress
do you think a pure democracy can work

6306
01:54:28,390 --> 01:54:28,400
do you think a pure democracy can work
 

6307
01:54:28,400 --> 01:54:30,790
do you think a pure democracy can work
so we have this representative democracy

6308
01:54:30,790 --> 01:54:30,800
so we have this representative democracy
 

6309
01:54:30,800 --> 01:54:32,870
so we have this representative democracy
with these contentious elections and so

6310
01:54:32,870 --> 01:54:32,880
with these contentious elections and so
 

6311
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:34,470
with these contentious elections and so
on

6312
01:54:34,470 --> 01:54:34,480
on
 

6313
01:54:34,480 --> 01:54:38,149
on
when we start a civilization on mars

6314
01:54:38,149 --> 01:54:38,159
when we start a civilization on mars
 

6315
01:54:38,159 --> 01:54:40,229
when we start a civilization on mars
which becomes more and more realistic

6316
01:54:40,229 --> 01:54:40,239
which becomes more and more realistic
 

6317
01:54:40,239 --> 01:54:42,229
which becomes more and more realistic
technologically we can have a more

6318
01:54:42,229 --> 01:54:42,239
technologically we can have a more
 

6319
01:54:42,239 --> 01:54:44,390
technologically we can have a more
direct access to be able to vote on

6320
01:54:44,390 --> 01:54:44,400
direct access to be able to vote on
 

6321
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:45,669
direct access to be able to vote on
issues and

6322
01:54:45,669 --> 01:54:45,679
issues and
 

6323
01:54:45,679 --> 01:54:48,629
issues and
vote for ideas do you think it can work

6324
01:54:48,629 --> 01:54:48,639
vote for ideas do you think it can work
 

6325
01:54:48,639 --> 01:54:50,470
vote for ideas do you think it can work
i don't think we have to go to mars uh

6326
01:54:50,470 --> 01:54:50,480
i don't think we have to go to mars uh
 

6327
01:54:50,480 --> 01:54:52,310
i don't think we have to go to mars uh
to do it right um

6328
01:54:52,310 --> 01:54:52,320
to do it right um
 

6329
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:56,070
to do it right um
uh i think um

6330
01:54:56,070 --> 01:54:56,080

 

6331
01:54:56,080 --> 01:54:57,830

the answer is not you know to flip a

6332
01:54:57,830 --> 01:54:57,840
the answer is not you know to flip a
 

6333
01:54:57,840 --> 01:55:00,070
the answer is not you know to flip a
switch and uh turn on something called

6334
01:55:00,070 --> 01:55:00,080
switch and uh turn on something called
 

6335
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:03,830
switch and uh turn on something called
pure democracy um uh when people are not

6336
01:55:03,830 --> 01:55:03,840
pure democracy um uh when people are not
 

6337
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:06,070
pure democracy um uh when people are not
ready for it when their uh incentive

6338
01:55:06,070 --> 01:55:06,080
ready for it when their uh incentive
 

6339
01:55:06,080 --> 01:55:07,990
ready for it when their uh incentive
structures are not um sort of uh

6340
01:55:07,990 --> 01:55:08,000
structures are not um sort of uh
 

6341
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:09,350
structures are not um sort of uh
structured for it

6342
01:55:09,350 --> 01:55:09,360
structured for it
 

6343
01:55:09,360 --> 01:55:11,910
structured for it
but you can um you know experiment with

6344
01:55:11,910 --> 01:55:11,920
but you can um you know experiment with
 

6345
01:55:11,920 --> 01:55:14,470
but you can um you know experiment with
more democratic forms of governance one

6346
01:55:14,470 --> 01:55:14,480
more democratic forms of governance one
 

6347
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:16,790
more democratic forms of governance one
after another right whether it's

6348
01:55:16,790 --> 01:55:16,800
after another right whether it's
 

6349
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:19,030
after another right whether it's
uh you know sort of experimenting with

uh you know sort of experimenting with
 

6351
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:22,070
uh you know sort of experimenting with
um technology to find new ways of sort

6352
01:55:22,070 --> 01:55:22,080
um technology to find new ways of sort
 

6353
01:55:22,080 --> 01:55:24,229
um technology to find new ways of sort
of of getting uh greater

6354
01:55:24,229 --> 01:55:24,239
of of getting uh greater
 

6355
01:55:24,239 --> 01:55:27,270

um i think that we see some experiments

6358
01:55:29,910 --> 01:55:29,920
um i think that we see some experiments
 

6359
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:33,189
um i think that we see some experiments
and sort of more complicated systems of

6360
01:55:33,189 --> 01:55:33,199
and sort of more complicated systems of
 

6361
01:55:33,199 --> 01:55:36,310
and sort of more complicated systems of
voting um that in fact might actually be

6362
01:55:36,310 --> 01:55:36,320
voting um that in fact might actually be
 

6363
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:39,109
voting um that in fact might actually be
more reflective of people's choices than

6364
01:55:39,109 --> 01:55:39,119
more reflective of people's choices than
 

6365
01:55:39,119 --> 01:55:41,030
more reflective of people's choices than
simply picking one candidate right sort

6366
01:55:41,030 --> 01:55:41,040
simply picking one candidate right sort
 

6367
01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:43,030
simply picking one candidate right sort
of ranked choice voting or

6368
01:55:43,030 --> 01:55:43,040
of ranked choice voting or
 

6369
01:55:43,040 --> 01:55:45,030
of ranked choice voting or
runoffs other kinds of things

6370
01:55:45,030 --> 01:55:45,040
runoffs other kinds of things
 

6371
01:55:45,040 --> 01:55:47,430
runoffs other kinds of things
and you know i think that we can think

6372
01:55:47,430 --> 01:55:47,440
and you know i think that we can think
 

6373
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:48,310
and you know i think that we can think
more

6374
01:55:48,310 --> 01:55:48,320
more
 

6375
01:55:48,320 --> 01:55:49,990
more
creatively about something like

6376
01:55:49,990 --> 01:55:50,000
creatively about something like
 

6377
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:51,990
creatively about something like
participatory budgeting right in which

6378
01:55:51,990 --> 01:55:52,000
participatory budgeting right in which
 

6379
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:53,030

um you know
we put all this money into the

6382
01:55:54,229 --> 01:55:54,239
we put all this money into the
 

6383
01:55:54,239 --> 01:55:57,270
we put all this money into the
government um and then um you know we we

going to solve this you know it's a
 

6415
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:29,910
going to solve this you know it's a
combination of technology and and human

6416

and
how will those fundamentals be met

6440
01:56:55,669 --> 01:56:55,679
how will those fundamentals be met
 

6441
01:56:55,679 --> 01:56:57,669
how will those fundamentals be met
by the by the students that received

6442

as you know in places like the
philippines where the united states had

particularly
the u.s philippine connection i think

6636
02:00:28,310 --> 02:00:28,320
the u.s philippine connection i think
 

6637
02:00:28,320 --> 02:00:30,390
the u.s philippine connection i think
were something that needed to be traced

6638
02:00:30,390 --> 02:00:30,400
were something that needed to be traced
 

6639
02:00:30,400 --> 02:00:32,070
were something that needed to be traced
across the 20th century because it's a

6640
02:00:32,070 --> 02:00:32,080
across the 20th century because it's a
 

6641
02:00:32,080 --> 02:00:32,870
across the 20th century because it's a
way

6642
02:00:32,870 --> 02:00:32,880
way
 

6643
02:00:32,880 --> 02:00:34,550
way
kind of a new way of seeing american

6644
02:00:34,550 --> 02:00:34,560
kind of a new way of seeing american
 

6645
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:36,390
kind of a new way of seeing american
power you know from from a different

6646
02:00:36,390 --> 02:00:36,400
power you know from from a different
 

6647
02:00:36,400 --> 02:00:37,270
power you know from from a different
angle

6648
02:00:37,270 --> 02:00:37,280
angle
 

6649
02:00:37,280 --> 02:00:39,189
angle
you see it in in that way

6650
02:00:39,189 --> 02:00:39,199
you see it in in that way
 

6651
02:00:39,199 --> 02:00:40,629
you see it in in that way
what are some aspects that define

6652
02:00:40,629 --> 02:00:40,639
what are some aspects that define
 

6653
02:00:40,639 --> 02:00:43,109
what are some aspects that define
america from from

02:00:43,109 --> 02:00:43,119
america from from
 

6655
02:00:43,119 --> 02:00:44,390
america from from
when you take the perspective of the

02:00:44,390 --> 02:00:44,400
when you take the perspective of the
 

6657
02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:45,510
when you take the perspective of the
pacific

6658
02:00:45,510 --> 02:00:45,520
pacific
 

6659
02:00:45,520 --> 02:00:47,430
pacific
what military conflict

6660
02:00:47,430 --> 02:00:47,440
what military conflict
 

6661
02:00:47,440 --> 02:00:50,070
what military conflict
and and the asymmetry of power there

6662
02:00:50,070 --> 02:00:50,080
and and the asymmetry of power there
 

6663
02:00:50,080 --> 02:00:54,149
and and the asymmetry of power there
right so i start in uh in 1898 um you

6664
02:00:54,149 --> 02:00:54,159
right so i start in uh in 1898 um you
 

6665
02:00:54,159 --> 02:00:55,910
right so i start in uh in 1898 um you
know with the us invasion of the

6666
02:00:55,910 --> 02:00:55,920
know with the us invasion of the
 

6667
02:00:55,920 --> 02:00:58,310
know with the us invasion of the
philippines um uh its conquest and

6668
02:00:58,310 --> 02:00:58,320
philippines um uh its conquest and
 

6669
02:00:58,320 --> 02:00:59,589
philippines um uh its conquest and
annexation

6670
02:00:59,589 --> 02:00:59,599
annexation
 

6671
02:00:59,599 --> 02:01:01,750
annexation
uh and i think in many ways this is a

6672
02:01:01,750 --> 02:01:01,760
uh and i think in many ways this is a
 

6673
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:04,229
uh and i think in many ways this is a
defining conflict of the 20th century

6674
02:01:04,229 --> 02:01:04,239
defining conflict of the 20th century
 

6675
02:01:04,239 --> 02:01:06,629
defining conflict of the 20th century
that's often completely overlooked we're

6676
02:01:06,629 --> 02:01:06,639
that's often completely overlooked we're
 

6677
02:01:06,639 --> 02:01:07,669
that's often completely overlooked we're
described

6678
02:01:07,669 --> 02:01:07,679
described
 

6679
02:01:07,679 --> 02:01:09,830
described
i think incorrectly as merely a war with

it's not obvious and how will history

7104
02:09:05,189 --> 02:09:05,199
it's not obvious and how will history
 

7105
02:09:05,199 --> 02:09:07,350
it's not obvious and how will history
remember putin

02:09:07,350 --> 02:09:07,360
remember putin
 

7107
02:09:07,360 --> 02:09:08,870
remember putin
that too

7108
02:09:08,870 --> 02:09:08,880
that too
 

7109
02:09:08,880 --> 02:09:10,870
that too
is not obvious

7110
02:09:10,870 --> 02:09:10,880
is not obvious
 

7111
02:09:10,880 --> 02:09:12,550
is not obvious
um

7112
02:09:12,550 --> 02:09:12,560
um
 

7113
02:09:12,560 --> 02:09:14,709
um
because it depends on how

7114
02:09:14,709 --> 02:09:14,719
because it depends on how
 

7115
02:09:14,719 --> 02:09:17,189
because it depends on how
the role the geopolitics

7116

the how the nations how the history of

7118
02:09:19,669 --> 02:09:19,679
the how the nations how the history of
 

7119
02:09:19,679 --> 02:09:23,109
the how the nations how the history of
these nations unravel unfold rather

7120
02:09:23,109 --> 02:09:23,119
these nations unravel unfold rather
 

7121
02:09:23,119 --> 02:09:24,069
these nations unravel unfold rather
so

7122
02:09:24,069 --> 02:09:24,079
so
 

7123
02:09:24,079 --> 02:09:25,990
so
it's very interesting to think about and

7124
02:09:25,990 --> 02:09:26,000
it's very interesting to think about and
 

7125
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:27,910
it's very interesting to think about and
the same is true for

7126
02:09:27,910 --> 02:09:27,920
the same is true for
 

7127
02:09:27,920 --> 02:09:30,390
the same is true for
donald trump joe biden

7128
02:09:30,390 --> 02:09:30,400

bill clinton
and so on

7136
02:09:37,669 --> 02:09:37,679
and so on
 

7137
02:09:37,679 --> 02:09:40,550
and so on
i think it's a probably unanswerable

7138
02:09:40,550 --> 02:09:40,560
i think it's a probably unanswerable
 

7139
02:09:40,560 --> 02:09:42,870
i think it's a probably unanswerable
question of which of the presidents will

02:09:42,880 --> 02:09:44,550
question of which of the presidents will
be remembered as a great president from

think about
when the robots finally take over uh
