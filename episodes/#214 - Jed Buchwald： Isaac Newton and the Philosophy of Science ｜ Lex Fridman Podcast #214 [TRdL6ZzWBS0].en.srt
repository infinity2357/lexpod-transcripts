and um
as you just said it offered

70
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:23,119
as you just said it offered
 

71
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,109
as you just said it offered
an outline for what he called a

72
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:25,119
an outline for what he called a
 

73
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,350
an outline for what he called a
paradigmatic structure namely the notion

74
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:27,360
paradigmatic structure namely the notion
 

75
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,550
paradigmatic structure namely the notion
that

76
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:28,560
that
 

77
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,109
that
you have to look at what scientists do

78
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:31,119
you have to look at what scientists do
 

79
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,350
you have to look at what scientists do
is forming a community of investigators

80
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:35,360
is forming a community of investigators
 

81
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,990
is forming a community of investigators
and that they're trying to solve various

82
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:38,000
and that they're trying to solve various
 

83
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,030
and that they're trying to solve various
puzzles as he would put it that crop up

84
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,040
puzzles as he would put it that crop up
 

85
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,950
puzzles as he would put it that crop up
figuring out how this works how that

86
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:42,960
figuring out how this works how that
 

87
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,109
figuring out how this works how that
works and so on and of course they don't

88
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:45,119
works and so on and of course they don't
 

89
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,910
works and so on and of course they don't
do it out of the blue they do it within

90
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:47,920
do it out of the blue they do it within
 

91
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,910
do it out of the blue they do it within
a certain framework the framework can be

92
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:49,920
a certain framework the framework can be
 

93
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,109
a certain framework the framework can be
pretty vague

94
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:51,119
pretty vague
 

95
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,950
pretty vague
he called it a paradigm

96
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:52,960
he called it a paradigm
 

97
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,749
he called it a paradigm
and his notion was that eventually they

98
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:55,759
and his notion was that eventually they
 

99
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,990
and his notion was that eventually they
run into troubles or what he called

100
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:58,000
run into troubles or what he called
 

101
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,190
run into troubles or what he called
anomalies that kind of cracks things

102
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:01,200
anomalies that kind of cracks things
 

103
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,429
anomalies that kind of cracks things
somebody new comes along with a

104
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:03,439
somebody new comes along with a
 

105
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,149
somebody new comes along with a
different way of doing it etc do i think

106
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:06,159
different way of doing it etc do i think
 

107
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,510
different way of doing it etc do i think
things work that way no not really

108
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:09,520
things work that way no not really
 

109
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,430
things work that way no not really
tom and i used to have lengthy

110
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:11,440
tom and i used to have lengthy
 

111
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,510
tom and i used to have lengthy
discussions about that over the years

112
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:15,520

 

113
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,430

i do think there is a common structure

114
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:19,440
i do think there is a common structure
 

115
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,910
i do think there is a common structure
that formulates both theoretical and

116

that formulates both theoretical and
 

117
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,390
that formulates both theoretical and
experimental practices

118
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:24,400
experimental practices
 

119
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,470
experimental practices
and historians nowadays of science like

120
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:26,480
and historians nowadays of science like
 

121
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,030
and historians nowadays of science like
to refer to scientific work as what

122
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,040
to refer to scientific work as what
 

123
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,910
to refer to scientific work as what
scientists practice it's uh almost

124
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:31,920
scientists practice it's uh almost
 

125
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,949
scientists practice it's uh almost
craftsmen like

they can usually adapt in various ways
 

129

of that i
once wrote a book on the origins of wave

134
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:45,519
once wrote a book on the origins of wave
 

135
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,309
once wrote a book on the origins of wave
theory of light and that is one of the

136

theory of light and that is one of the
 

137
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,270
theory of light and that is one of the
paradigmatic examples that tom used only

138
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:51,280
paradigmatic examples that tom used only
 

139
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,190
paradigmatic examples that tom used only
it didn't work that way

140
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:53,200
it didn't work that way
 

141
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,390
it didn't work that way
exactly because he thought that what

142
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:56,400
exactly because he thought that what
 

143
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,830
exactly because he thought that what
happened was

144
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:57,840
happened was
 

145
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,430
happened was
that the

146
00:02:59,430 --> 00:02:59,440
that the
 

147
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,309
that the
wave theory ran into trouble with a

148
00:03:02,309 --> 00:03:02,319
wave theory ran into trouble with a
 

149
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,390
wave theory ran into trouble with a
certain phenomenon which it couldn't

150
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:04,400
certain phenomenon which it couldn't
 

151
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,670
certain phenomenon which it couldn't
crack

152

crack
 

153
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,430
crack
well it turned out that in fact

00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:07,440
well it turned out that in fact
 

155
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,390
well it turned out that in fact
historically that phenomenon was

00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:10,400
historically that phenomenon was
 

157
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,790
historically that phenomenon was
actually um

later on to the wave theory and when the

later on to the wave theory and when the

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,550
later on to the wave theory and when the
wave theory came in

wave theory came in
 

165
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,070
wave theory came in
the alternative to it which had

166
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,080
the alternative to it which had
 

167
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,070
the alternative to it which had
prevailed which was newton's views of

okay okay yeah so i have and i have i

558
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:06,240
okay okay yeah so i have and i have i
 

559
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,310
okay okay yeah so i have and i have i
heard his name there you go no but i

560
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:08,320
heard his name there you go no but i
 

561
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,910
heard his name there you go no but i
don't remember but you don't remember so

562
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:09,920
don't remember but you don't remember so
 

563
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,670
don't remember but you don't remember so
i mean there's there's a very different

564
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:11,680
i mean there's there's a very different
 

565
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,829
i mean there's there's a very different
thing

566
00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:12,839
thing
 

567
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,829
thing
between names attached to principles and

568
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:15,839
between names attached to principles and
 

569
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,829
between names attached to principles and
laws and so on that you sometimes let go

570
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:17,839
laws and so on that you sometimes let go
 

571
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,990
laws and so on that you sometimes let go
of you just remember the equations of

572
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,000
of you just remember the equations of
 

573
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,829
of you just remember the equations of
the principles themselves and the

574
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:21,839
the principles themselves and the
 

575
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,230
the principles themselves and the
personalities of science and there's

576
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:24,240
personalities of science and there's
 

577
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,630
personalities of science and there's
certain personalities certain human

578
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:26,640
certain personalities certain human
 

579
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,389
certain personalities certain human

580
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:28,399
beings that stand out
 

581
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,430
beings that stand out
and that's why there is a sense to which

582
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:31,440
and that's why there is a sense to which
 

583
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,470
and that's why there is a sense to which
the lone inventor the lone scientist is

584
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:34,480
the lone inventor the lone scientist is
 

585

the lone inventor the lone scientist is
the way

i personally mean i think a lot of

588
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:37,519
i personally mean i think a lot of
 

589
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,949
i personally mean i think a lot of
people think about the history of

00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:38,959
people think about the history of
 

591
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,150
people think about the history of
science is these lone geniuses without

from the picture
then science would

600
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:50,320
then science would
 

601
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,750
then science would
there's almost a feeling like it would

there's almost a feeling like it would

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,910
there's almost a feeling like it would
just have stopped there

there's a feeling like it would take
 

609
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,550
there's a feeling like it would take
much longer to develop the things that

610
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:58,560
much longer to develop the things that
 

611
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,030
much longer to develop the things that
were developed is that a silly way to

were developed is that a silly way to
 

613
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,670
were developed is that a silly way to
look at the history that's not entirely

so this notion of the deep theory to

840
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:26,000
so this notion of the deep theory to
 

841
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,150
so this notion of the deep theory to
explain everything

842
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:28,160
explain everything
 

843
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,629
explain everything
is

844
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:30,639

 

845
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:31,910

a

846
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:31,920
a
 

847
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,350
a
long-standing belief

848
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:35,360

 

849
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,350

which goes back pretty far although i

850
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:37,360
which goes back pretty far although i
 

851
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,509
which goes back pretty far although i
think it only takes its fullest form

852
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:41,519
think it only takes its fullest form
 

853
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,150
think it only takes its fullest form
sometime in towards the end of the 19th

854
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:44,160
sometime in towards the end of the 19th
 

855
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,790
sometime in towards the end of the 19th
century so maybe we just speak to that

856
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:46,800
century so maybe we just speak to that
 

857
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,710
century so maybe we just speak to that
you're referring to

858
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:48,720
you're referring to
 

859
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,829
you're referring to
a hope a dream a reality of coming up

860
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:51,839
a hope a dream a reality of coming up
 

861
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,509
a hope a dream a reality of coming up
with a theory of everything that

862
00:16:53,509 --> 00:16:53,519
with a theory of everything that
 

863
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,030
with a theory of everything that
explains everything

864
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:55,040
explains everything
 

865
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,110
explains everything
so there's a very specific thing that

866
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:57,120
so there's a very specific thing that
 

867
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,350
so there's a very specific thing that
that currently means in physics

868
00:16:59,350 --> 00:16:59,360
that currently means in physics
 

869
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,870
that currently means in physics
as the unification of the laws of

870
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:00,880
as the unification of the laws of
 

871
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,150
as the unification of the laws of
physics

872
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:02,160
physics
 

873
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,430
physics
but

874
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:03,440
but
 

875
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,150
but
i'm sure in antiquity or before it meant

876
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:06,160
i'm sure in antiquity or before it meant
 

877
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,750
i'm sure in antiquity or before it meant
maybe something else or is it always

878
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:07,760
maybe something else or is it always
 

879
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,390
maybe something else or is it always
about physics because i mean i think as

880
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:10,400
about physics because i mean i think as
 

881
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,069
about physics because i mean i think as
you've kind of implied

882
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:14,079

 

883
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,590

in physics there's a sense once you get

884
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:15,600
in physics there's a sense once you get
 

885
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,870
in physics there's a sense once you get
to the theory of everything you've

886
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:16,880
to the theory of everything you've
 

887
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,350
to the theory of everything you've
understood everything but there's a very

888
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:19,360
understood everything but there's a very
 

889
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,470
understood everything but there's a very
deep sense in which you've actually

890
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:20,480
deep sense in which you've actually
 

891
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,390
deep sense in which you've actually
understood not very much at all

892
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:22,400
understood not very much at all
 

893
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,470
understood not very much at all
you've understood at that particular

894
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:24,480
you've understood at that particular
 

895
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,549
you've understood at that particular
level how things work but you don't

896
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:26,559
level how things work but you don't
 

897
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,230
level how things work but you don't
understand how the abstractions on top

898
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:28,240
understand how the abstractions on top
 

899
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,390
understand how the abstractions on top
of abstractions form all the way to the

900
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:30,400
of abstractions form all the way to the
 

901
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,990
of abstractions form all the way to the
chemistry to the human mind and the

902
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:32,000
chemistry to the human mind and the
 

903
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,150

human societies and all those kinds of

human societies and all those kinds of
things

906
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:35,039
things
 

907
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,909
things
so uh maybe you can speak to the theory

908
00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:37,919
so uh maybe you can speak to the theory
 

909
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,150
so uh maybe you can speak to the theory
of everything in its history and and

910
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:40,160
of everything in its history and and
 

911
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,909
of everything in its history and and
comment on what the heck does that even

912
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:41,919
comment on what the heck does that even
 

913
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,590
comment on what the heck does that even
mean the theory of everything

914
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:43,600
mean the theory of everything
 

915
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,830
mean the theory of everything
well i don't think you can go back that

916
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:45,840
well i don't think you can go back that
 

917
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,070
well i don't think you can go back that
far with something like that maybe to

918
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:48,080
far with something like that maybe to
 

919
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,590
far with something like that maybe to
the at best to the 17th century if you

920
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:51,600
the at best to the 17th century if you
 

921
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,510
the at best to the 17th century if you
go back all the way in antiquity there

922
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:53,520
go back all the way in antiquity there
 

923
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,789
go back all the way in antiquity there
are of course discussions about

924
00:17:56,789 --> 00:17:56,799
are of course discussions about
 

925
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,190
are of course discussions about
the nature of the world

926
00:17:59,190 --> 00:17:59,200
the nature of the world
 

927
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,350
the nature of the world
but first of all

928
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:01,360
but first of all
 

929
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,590
but first of all
you have to

930
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:03,600
you have to
 

931
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,669
you have to
have to recognize

932
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:05,679
have to recognize
 

933
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,430
have to recognize
that the manipulative character of

00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:09,440
that the manipulative character of

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,350
that the manipulative character of

the probing of

938
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:14,640
the probing of
 

939
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,789
the probing of
let me put it this way

940
00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:16,799
let me put it this way
 

941
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,310
let me put it this way
we assume

942
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:18,320
we assume
 

943
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,870
we assume
and have assumed for a long time

944
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:20,880
and have assumed for a long time
 

945
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,190
and have assumed for a long time
i'll come back to when in a moment

946
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:23,200
i'll come back to when in a moment
 

947
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,110
i'll come back to when in a moment
that if i take

948
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:25,120
that if i take
 

949
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,270
that if i take
a little device which is really

950
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:27,280
a little device which is really
 

951
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,830
a little device which is really
complicatedly made out of all kinds of

952
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:29,840
complicatedly made out of all kinds of
 

953
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,789
complicatedly made out of all kinds of
things

954
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:30,799
things
 

955
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,230
things
and i put a piece of some material in it

956
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:34,240
and i put a piece of some material in it
 

957
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,710
and i put a piece of some material in it
and i monkey around with it and do all

958
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:36,720
and i monkey around with it and do all
 

959
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,350
and i monkey around with it and do all
kinds of unnatural things to it things

960
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:39,360
kinds of unnatural things to it things
 

961
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,750
kinds of unnatural things to it things
that wouldn't happen

962
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:41,760
that wouldn't happen
 

963
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,070
that wouldn't happen
and i find out how it behaves and what

964
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:44,080
and i find out how it behaves and what
 

965
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,870
and i find out how it behaves and what
not and then i try and make an argument

966
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:46,880
not and then i try and make an argument
 

967
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,510
not and then i try and make an argument
about how that really applies even in

968
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:49,520
about how that really applies even in
 

969
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,789
about how that really applies even in
the natural world without any artificial

970
00:18:52,789 --> 00:18:52,799
the natural world without any artificial
 

971
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,669
the natural world without any artificial
structures and so on that's not a belief

972
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:55,679
structures and so on that's not a belief
 

973
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,909
structures and so on that's not a belief
that was widely held

974
00:18:57,909 --> 00:18:57,919
that was widely held
 

975
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,029
that was widely held
by pretty much anyone until sometime

976
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:01,039
by pretty much anyone until sometime
 

977
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,470
by pretty much anyone until sometime
maybe in the 1500s and when it was first

978
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:04,480
maybe in the 1500s and when it was first
 

979
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,350
maybe in the 1500s and when it was first
held it was held by people we now call

980
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:07,360
held it was held by people we now call
 

981
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,870
held it was held by people we now call
alchemists

982
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:08,880
alchemists
 

983
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,190
alchemists
so alchemy was the first the early days

984
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:11,200
so alchemy was the first the early days
 

985
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,710
so alchemy was the first the early days
of the theory of everything of a dream

986
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:12,720
of the theory of everything of a dream
 

987
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,950
of the theory of everything of a dream
of a theory of everything i would put it

988
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:14,960
of a theory of everything i would put it
 

989
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,350
of a theory of everything i would put it
a little differently i think it's more

990
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:17,360
a little differently i think it's more
 

991
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,070
a little differently i think it's more
along the way a dream

992
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:20,080
along the way a dream
 

993
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,549
along the way a dream
that by probing nature in

that by probing nature in
 

995
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:26,870
that by probing nature in
artificially constructed ways we can

996
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:26,880
artificially constructed ways we can
 

997
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:32,630
artificially constructed ways we can
find out what's going on deep down there

998
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:32,640

 

999
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,270

so that was that's distinct from science

1000
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:35,280
so that was that's distinct from science
 

1001

you're talking about probing like

you're talking about probing like
 

1007
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,590
you're talking about probing like
messing with nature to understand it

you have to
 

1015
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,150
you have to
you have to manipulate nature

1016
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:56,160
you have to manipulate nature
 

1017
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,789
you have to manipulate nature
to find out things about it and then you

to find out things about it and then you
 

1019
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,870
to find out things about it and then you
have to convince

then the question is you know what's
 

1137

then the question is you know what's
before the big bang or actually the word

before the big bang or actually the word

but um
 

1145
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,310
but um
why the why do we have the laws that

why the why do we have the laws that

well there is a notion that those laws

there's all kinds of things like

there's all kinds of things like

00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:43,760
inside of a black hole because you get
 

1171
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,110
inside of a black hole because you get
both the general relativity and the

1172
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:45,120
both the general relativity and the
 

1173
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,350
both the general relativity and the
quantum mechanics quantum field theory

in there

1176
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:48,880
in there
 

1177
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,710
in there
uh experimentally of course there's a

1178
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:50,720
uh experimentally of course there's a
 

1179
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,870
uh experimentally of course there's a
lot of interesting ideas we can't really

1180
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:52,880
lot of interesting ideas we can't really
 

1181
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,870
lot of interesting ideas we can't really
look close to the big bang can look that

1182
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:54,880
look close to the big bang can look that
 

1183
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,990
look close to the big bang can look that
far back

1184
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:56,000
far back
 

1185
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,710
far back
this caltech and mit will lie go look

1186
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:58,720
this caltech and mit will lie go look
 

1187
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,029
this caltech and mit will lie go look
into gravitational waves perhaps allows

1188
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:01,039
into gravitational waves perhaps allows
 

1189
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,110
into gravitational waves perhaps allows
us to march backwards and so on yeah

1190
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:03,120
us to march backwards and so on yeah
 

1191
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,710
us to march backwards and so on yeah
it's really exciting space and there's

1192
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:04,720
it's really exciting space and there's
 

1193
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,990
it's really exciting space and there's
of course

1194
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:06,000
of course
 

1195
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,789
of course
the theory of everything like with a lot

1196
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:08,799
the theory of everything like with a lot
 

1197
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:11,190
the theory of everything like with a lot
of things in science captivates the

of things in science captivates the
 

1199
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,789
of things in science captivates the
dreams of those who are perhaps

1200
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:12,799
dreams of those who are perhaps
 

1201
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,950
dreams of those who are perhaps
completely outside of science it's the

1202
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:14,960
completely outside of science it's the
 

1203
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,590
completely outside of science it's the
dream of discovering the key to how the

1204
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:17,600
dream of discovering the key to how the
 

1205
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,190
dream of discovering the key to how the
you know the nature of

1206
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:19,200
you know the nature of
 

1207
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,270
you know the nature of
how everything works

1208
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:21,280
how everything works
 

1209
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,190
how everything works
and that feels uh

1210
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:23,200
and that feels uh
 

1211
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,430
and that feels uh
that feels deeply human

1212
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:25,440
that feels deeply human
 

1213
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,510
that feels deeply human
that's perhaps the thing the

1214
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:27,520
that's perhaps the thing the
 

1215
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,630
that's perhaps the thing the
the basic

1216
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:28,640
the basic
 

1217
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,110
the basic
elements of what makes up a scientist in

00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:33,679
the end is that curiosity that longing

1223
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,510

let me ask you mentioned a disagreement

1224
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:39,520
let me ask you mentioned a disagreement
 

1225
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,029
let me ask you mentioned a disagreement
with weinberg on

1226
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:41,039
with weinberg on

could you elaborate a little bit

00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:45,840
could you elaborate a little bit
 

1231
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,870
could you elaborate a little bit
well i

1232
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:46,880
well i
 

1233
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,029
well i
obviously i don't disagree with steve

1234
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:49,039
obviously i don't disagree with steve
 

1235
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,750
obviously i don't disagree with steve
weinberg on physics itself i wouldn't

1236
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:51,760
weinberg on physics itself i wouldn't
 

1237
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,549
weinberg on physics itself i wouldn't
know enough to even begin to do that

1238
00:23:54,549 --> 00:23:54,559
know enough to even begin to do that
 

1239
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,070
know enough to even begin to do that
and clearly you know he's one of the

and clearly you know he's one of the
 

1241
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,710

founders of the standard model and so on

1242
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:58,720
founders of the standard model and so on
 

1243
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,950
founders of the standard model and so on
and it works

1244
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:00,960
and it works
 

1245
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,510
and it works
to a level of accuracy that no physical

i suppose the question in my mind is

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,470
i suppose the question in my mind is
something that

something that

something that
in one way could go back to the

everything can we corral it

everything can we corral it

everything can we corral it
with mathematics and experimental

uh do i think that a particular way of

00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:57,120
uh do i think that a particular way of
 

1291
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,789
uh do i think that a particular way of
corralling nature

1292
00:24:58,789 --> 00:24:58,799
corralling nature
 

1293
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,909
corralling nature
will inevitably play itself out

1294
00:25:01,909 --> 00:25:01,919
will inevitably play itself out
 

1295
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,350
will inevitably play itself out
i don't know

1296
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:03,360
i don't know
 

1297
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,950
i don't know
it always has

1298
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:04,960
it always has
 

1299
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,110
it always has
i'll put it to you that way

1300
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:07,120
i'll put it to you that way
 

1301
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,470
i'll put it to you that way
um

1302
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:08,480
um
 

1303
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,789
um
so the basic question is

1304
00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:10,799
so the basic question is
 

1305
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,110
so the basic question is
can we

1306
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:13,120
can we
 

1307
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,029
can we
no

1308
00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:15,039
no
 

1309
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,870
no
reality

1310
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:16,880
reality
 

1311
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,110
reality
is that the the con question is that the

1312
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:19,120
is that the the con question is that the
 

1313

weinberg
question

1316
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:22,720
question
 

1317
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,549
question
we humans okay with our brains right can

1318
00:25:26,549 --> 00:25:26,559
we humans okay with our brains right can
 

1319
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:27,590
we humans okay with our brains right can
we

1320
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:27,600
we
 

1321
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,669
we
comprehend reality

1322
00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:29,679
comprehend reality
 

1323
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,029
comprehend reality
sounds like a very trippy question

1324
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:31,039
sounds like a very trippy question
 

1325
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,110
sounds like a very trippy question
because a lot of it rests on definitions

1326
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:33,120
because a lot of it rests on definitions
 

1327
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,110
because a lot of it rests on definitions
of uh no and comprehend and reality but

1328
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:37,120
of uh no and comprehend and reality but
 

1329
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,590
of uh no and comprehend and reality but
get to the bottom of it

1330
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:39,600
get to the bottom of it
 

1331
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,310
get to the bottom of it
like it's it's turtles on top of turtles

1332
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:42,320
like it's it's turtles on top of turtles
 

1333
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,269
like it's it's turtles on top of turtles
can we get to the bottom turtle

1334
00:25:45,269 --> 00:25:45,279
can we get to the bottom turtle
 

1335
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:49,190
can we get to the bottom turtle
well i say hello uh maybe i could um

1336
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:49,200
well i say hello uh maybe i could um
 

1337
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,029
well i say hello uh maybe i could um
put it to you this way

1338
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:51,039
put it to you this way
 

1339
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,590
put it to you this way
in uh

1340
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:53,600
in uh
 

1341
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,870
in uh
a way that i we often i often begin

uh the history of
 

1347
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,510
uh the history of
science and so on

science and so on
 

1349
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,590
science and so on
and say i'm looking at you

1350
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:05,600
and say i'm looking at you
 

1351
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,029
and say i'm looking at you
yes

1352
00:26:07,029 --> 00:26:07,039
yes
 

1353
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,269
yes
um you are in fact a figment of my

1354
00:26:09,269 --> 00:26:09,279
um you are in fact a figment of my
 

1355
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,430
um you are in fact a figment of my
imagination

1356
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:11,440
imagination
 

1357
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,750
imagination
you have a messed up imagination yes

1358
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:13,760
you have a messed up imagination yes
 

1359
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,310
you have a messed up imagination yes
well what do i mean by that

1360
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:16,320
well what do i mean by that
 

1361
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,510
well what do i mean by that
if i were a dragonfly

1362
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:19,520
if i were a dragonfly
 

1363
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,909
if i were a dragonfly
looking at you

1364
00:26:21,909 --> 00:26:21,919
looking at you
 

1365
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:27,029
looking at you
whatever my nervous system would form

1366
00:26:27,029 --> 00:26:27,039
whatever my nervous system would form
 

1367
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,710
whatever my nervous system would form
by way of

1368
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:28,720
by way of
 

1369
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,950
by way of
a perceptual structure

1370
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:30,960
a perceptual structure
 

1371
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,549
a perceptual structure
would is clearly be utterly different

1372
00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:34,559
would is clearly be utterly different
 

1373
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,149
would is clearly be utterly different
from what

1374
00:26:36,149 --> 00:26:36,159
from what
 

1375
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:37,590
from what
my brain

1376
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:37,600
my brain
 

1377
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,390
my brain
and perceptual system altogether is

1378
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:40,400
and perceptual system altogether is
 

1379
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,510
and perceptual system altogether is
forming

1380
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:41,520
forming
 

1381
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,789
forming
when i look at you

1382
00:26:44,789 --> 00:26:44,799

 

1383
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,390

who's right

1384
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:48,400

 

1385
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:54,070

is it me or the dragonfly

1386
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:54,080

 

1387
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,750

well the dragonfly is certainly very

1388
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:55,760
well the dragonfly is certainly very
 

1389
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,990
well the dragonfly is certainly very
impressive so i don't know but yes it's

1390
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:58,000
impressive so i don't know but yes it's
 

1391
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,230
impressive so i don't know but yes it's
uh the observer matters

1392
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:04,240

 

1393
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,870

well how does what is that supposed to

1394
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:06,880
well how does what is that supposed to
 

1395
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,269
well how does what is that supposed to
tell us about objective reality well i

1396
00:27:09,269 --> 00:27:09,279
tell us about objective reality well i
 

1397
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,110
tell us about objective reality well i
think it means that

1398
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:11,120
think it means that
 

1399
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,950
think it means that
it's very difficult to get beyond

1400
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:14,960
it's very difficult to get beyond
 

1401
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,710
it's very difficult to get beyond
the constructs

1402
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:16,720
the constructs
 

1403
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,950
the constructs
that our perceptual system is leading us

1404
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:20,960
that our perceptual system is leading us
 

1405
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,230
that our perceptual system is leading us
to when we make apparatus and devices

1406
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:24,240
to when we make apparatus and devices
 

1407
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,510
to when we make apparatus and devices
and so on we're still making things

1408
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:27,520
and so on we're still making things
 

1409
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,510
and so on we're still making things
the results of which are the outputs of

1410
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:29,520
the results of which are the outputs of
 

1411
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,789
the results of which are the outputs of
which we process perceptually in various

1412
00:27:32,789 --> 00:27:32,799
which we process perceptually in various
 

1413
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:33,669
which we process perceptually in various
ways

1414
00:27:33,669 --> 00:27:33,679
ways
 

1415
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,630
ways
and an analogy i like to use with the

1416
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:36,640
and an analogy i like to use with the
 

1417
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,789
and an analogy i like to use with the
students sometimes is this all right

1418
00:27:38,789 --> 00:27:38,799
students sometimes is this all right
 

1419
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,389
students sometimes is this all right
they all have their laptops open in

1420
00:27:40,389 --> 00:27:40,399
they all have their laptops open in
 

1421
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,470
they all have their laptops open in
front of them of course okay

1422
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:42,480
front of them of course okay
 

1423
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,510
front of them of course okay
and um i've sent them

1424
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:45,520
and um i've sent them
 

1425
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,350
and um i've sent them
something to read

1426
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:47,360
something to read
 

1427
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,830
something to read
and i say okay click on it and open it

1428
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:49,840
and i say okay click on it and open it
 

1429
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,149
and i say okay click on it and open it
up so pdf opens up i said what are you

1430
00:27:52,149 --> 00:27:52,159
up so pdf opens up i said what are you
 

1431
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:53,510
up so pdf opens up i said what are you
looking at

1432
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:53,520
looking at
 

1433
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,269
looking at
i said well i'm looking at you know the

1434
00:27:55,269 --> 00:27:55,279
i said well i'm looking at you know the
 

1435
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,950
i said well i'm looking at you know the
paper that you sent me

1436
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:56,960
paper that you sent me
 

1437
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,950
paper that you sent me
i said no you're not

1438
00:27:58,950 --> 00:27:58,960
i said no you're not
 

1439
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,190
i said no you're not
what you're looking at is a stream of

1440
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:01,200
what you're looking at is a stream of
 

1441
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,430
what you're looking at is a stream of
light coming off leds or lcds coming off

1442
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:05,440
light coming off leds or lcds coming off
 

1443
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,630
light coming off leds or lcds coming off
a screen

1444
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:06,640
a screen
 

1445
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,190
a screen
and and i said what happens when you use

1446
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:09,200
and and i said what happens when you use
 

1447
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,990
and and i said what happens when you use
your mouse and move that

1448
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:12,000
your mouse and move that
 

1449
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,149
your mouse and move that
fake piece of paper on the screen around

1450
00:28:14,149 --> 00:28:14,159
fake piece of paper on the screen around
 

1451
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,830
fake piece of paper on the screen around
what are you doing you're not moving a

1452
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:15,840
what are you doing you're not moving a
 

1453
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,590
what are you doing you're not moving a
piece of paper around are you you're

1454
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:17,600
piece of paper around are you you're
 

1455
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,230
piece of paper around are you you're
moving a construct around

1456
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:20,240
moving a construct around
 

1457
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,950
moving a construct around
a construct that's being processed so

1458
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:22,960
a construct that's being processed so
 

1459
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,830
a construct that's being processed so
that our perceptual system can interact

1460
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:25,840
that our perceptual system can interact
 

1461
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,269
that our perceptual system can interact
with it in the way we interact with

1462
00:28:29,269 --> 00:28:29,279
with it in the way we interact with
 

1463
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,310
with it in the way we interact with
pieces of paper yes but it's not

1464
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:32,320
pieces of paper yes but it's not
 

1465
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,789
pieces of paper yes but it's not
real

1466
00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:34,799

 

1467
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,230

so

1468
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:36,240
so
 

1469
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,230
so
are there things outside the reach of

1470
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:38,240
are there things outside the reach of
 

1471
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,310
are there things outside the reach of
science

1472
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:40,320
science
 

1473
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,909
science
can you maybe

1474
00:28:41,909 --> 00:28:41,919
can you maybe
 

1475
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:43,350
can you maybe
as an example

1476
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:43,360
as an example
 

1477
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,669
as an example
talk about consciousness i'm asking for

1478
00:28:45,669 --> 00:28:45,679
talk about consciousness i'm asking for
 

1479
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,830
talk about consciousness i'm asking for
a friend trying to figure this thing out

1480
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:49,840

 

1481
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,110

well boy i mean i i

1482
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:53,120
well boy i mean i i
 

1483
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,430
well boy i mean i i
i read a fair bit about that but i

1484
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:55,440
i read a fair bit about that but i
 

1485
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,630
i read a fair bit about that but i
certainly don't

1486
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:56,640
certainly don't
 

1487
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:02,870
certainly don't
can't really say much about it

1488
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:02,880

 

1489
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,710

i'm a materialist

1490
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:04,720
i'm a materialist
 

1491
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,789
i'm a materialist
in the deepest sense of the term i don't

1492
00:29:06,789 --> 00:29:06,799
in the deepest sense of the term i don't
 

1493
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,269
in the deepest sense of the term i don't
think there is anything out there

1494
00:29:09,269 --> 00:29:09,279
think there is anything out there
 

1495
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,909
think there is anything out there
except material structures which

1496
00:29:11,909 --> 00:29:11,919
except material structures which
 

1497
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,029
except material structures which
interact

1498
00:29:13,029 --> 00:29:13,039
interact
 

1499
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:16,549
interact
in various ways do i think for example

1500
00:29:16,549 --> 00:29:16,559
in various ways do i think for example
 

1501
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,110
in various ways do i think for example
that this bottle of water is conscious

1502
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:19,120
that this bottle of water is conscious
 

1503
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,990
that this bottle of water is conscious
no i do not

1504
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:22,000
no i do not
 

1505
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,750
no i do not
although how would i know i can't talk

1506
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:23,760
although how would i know i can't talk
 

1507
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,630
although how would i know i can't talk
to it

1508
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:24,640
to it
 

1509
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,430
to it
yeah but so what do it's a hypothesis

1510
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:27,440
yeah but so what do it's a hypothesis
 

1511
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,350
yeah but so what do it's a hypothesis
you have it's an opinion an educated

1512
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:29,360
you have it's an opinion an educated
 

1513
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,669
you have it's an opinion an educated
opinion that may be very wrong well i

1514
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:31,679
opinion that may be very wrong well i
 

1515
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,350
opinion that may be very wrong well i
know that you're conscious because i can

1516
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:33,360
know that you're conscious because i can
 

1517
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,630
know that you're conscious because i can
interact directly with you but am i

1518
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:36,640
interact directly with you but am i
 

1519
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,990
interact directly with you but am i
well unless you're a figment of my

1520
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:38,000
well unless you're a figment of my
 

1521
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,870
well unless you're a figment of my
imagination of course nor or i'm a robot

1522
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:40,880
imagination of course nor or i'm a robot
 

1523
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,430
imagination of course nor or i'm a robot
that's able to generate the illusion uh

1524
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:43,440
that's able to generate the illusion uh
 

1525
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,470
that's able to generate the illusion uh
yes the illusion of consciousness

1526
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:46,480
yes the illusion of consciousness
 

1527
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,630
yes the illusion of consciousness
effectively enough to facilitate a good

00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:50,320
conversation because we humans do want
 

1531
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,750
conversation because we humans do want
to pretend that we're talking to other

1532
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:51,760
to pretend that we're talking to other
 

1533
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,510
to pretend that we're talking to other
conscious beings that's how we respect

1534
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:53,520
conscious beings that's how we respect
 

1535
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,950

them if it's not conscious we don't

them if it's not conscious we don't
 

1537
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,870
them if it's not conscious we don't
respect them we're not good at talking

1538
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:56,880
respect them we're not good at talking

he took a prism
 

1747
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,669
he took a prism
you might ask where do you get prisms in

1748
00:33:55,669 --> 00:33:55,679
you might ask where do you get prisms in
 

1749
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,630
you might ask where do you get prisms in
the you know 1660s

county fairs they were very popular they

1752
00:34:01,029 --> 00:34:01,039
county fairs they were very popular they
 

1753
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,110
county fairs they were very popular they
were pretty crude with bubbles in them

1754
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:03,120
were pretty crude with bubbles in them
 

1755
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,029
were pretty crude with bubbles in them
and everything but they produced colors

1756
00:34:05,029 --> 00:34:05,039
and everything but they produced colors
 

1757
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,870
and everything but they produced colors
so you could buy them at county fairs

1758
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:06,880
so you could buy them at county fairs
 

1759
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,629

00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:26,320
and he could use the
 

1777
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,629
and he could use the
then known laws for how light behaves

1778

and because what he knows is this he
 

1809
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,310
and because what he knows is this he
knows that if you take this prism

1810
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:04,320
knows that if you take this prism
 

1811
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,390
knows that if you take this prism
and you turn it to a certain particular

and you turn it to a certain particular
 

1813
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,790
and you turn it to a certain particular
angle that he knew

1814
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:08,800
angle that he knew
 

1815
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,470
angle that he knew
what it should be because he could

1816
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:10,480
what it should be because he could
 

1817
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,710
what it should be because he could
calculate things and

1818
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:12,720
calculate things and
 

1819
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,470
calculate things and
very few other people in europe at the

very few other people in europe at the
 

1821
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,870
very few other people in europe at the
time could calculate things like he

1822

particular angle
then the sun which is of course a circle

1830
00:35:25,589 --> 00:35:25,599
then the sun which is of course a circle
 

1831
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,190
then the sun which is of course a circle
when its light passes through this

1832
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:27,200
when its light passes through this
 

1833
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,589
when its light passes through this
little hole and then into the prism on

1834
00:35:29,589 --> 00:35:29,599
little hole and then into the prism on
 

1835
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,310
little hole and then into the prism on
the far distant wall

1836
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:32,320
the far distant wall
 

1837
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,349
the far distant wall
should still make a circle

1838
00:35:35,349 --> 00:35:35,359
should still make a circle
 

1839
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,510
should still make a circle
but it doesn't

1840
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:37,520
but it doesn't
 

1841
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,870
but it doesn't
it makes a very long image okay

1842
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:40,880
it makes a very long image okay
 

1843
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,630
it makes a very long image okay
and this

1844
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:42,640
and this
 

1845
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,870
and this
led him to a very different conception

1846
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:44,880
led him to a very different conception
 

1847
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,790
led him to a very different conception
of light indicating that there are

1848
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:46,800
of light indicating that there are
 

1849
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,430
of light indicating that there are
different types of light in the sunlight

1850
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:49,440
different types of light in the sunlight
 

1851
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,310
different types of light in the sunlight
now

1852
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:50,320
now
 

1853
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,390
now
to go beyond that what's particularly

1854
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:52,400
to go beyond that what's particularly
 

1855
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,710
to go beyond that what's particularly
interesting i think is the following

1856
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:54,720
interesting i think is the following
 

1857
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,870
interesting i think is the following
when he published uh this paper which

1858
00:35:58,870 --> 00:35:58,880
when he published uh this paper which
 

1859
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,109
when he published uh this paper which
got him into a controversy

1860
00:36:01,109 --> 00:36:01,119
got him into a controversy
 

1861
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,030
got him into a controversy
he really didn't describe it all what he

1862
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:03,040
he really didn't describe it all what he
 

1863
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,069
he really didn't describe it all what he
did he just gave you some numbers

1864
00:36:06,069 --> 00:36:06,079
did he just gave you some numbers
 

1865
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:07,829
did he just gave you some numbers
now i just told you that you had to set

1866
00:36:07,829 --> 00:36:07,839
now i just told you that you had to set
 

1867
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:11,030
now i just told you that you had to set
this prism at a certain angle right

1868
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:11,040
this prism at a certain angle right
 

1869
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,829
this prism at a certain angle right
you would think because we do have his

1870
00:36:13,829 --> 00:36:13,839
you would think because we do have his
 

1871
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,829
you would think because we do have his
notes and so on

1872
00:36:15,829 --> 00:36:15,839
notes and so on
 

1873
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:18,310
notes and so on
um you would think that he took some

1874
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:18,320
um you would think that he took some
 

1875
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,190
um you would think that he took some
kind of complicated measuring device to

1876
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:21,200
kind of complicated measuring device to
 

1877
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,190
kind of complicated measuring device to
set the prism he didn't

1878
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:23,200
set the prism he didn't
 

1879
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,030
set the prism he didn't
he held it in his hand

1880
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:25,040
he held it in his hand
 

1881
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,390
he held it in his hand
that's all and he twiddled it around

1882
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:28,400
that's all and he twiddled it around
 

1883
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,670
that's all and he twiddled it around
and what was he doing it turns out

1884
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:31,680
and what was he doing it turns out
 

1885
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,230
and what was he doing it turns out
that when you twiddle the prism around

1886
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:34,240
that when you twiddle the prism around
 

1887
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,390
that when you twiddle the prism around
at the point where you should get a

1888
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:36,400
at the point where you should get a
 

1889
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,390
at the point where you should get a
circle from a circle

1890
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:38,400
circle from a circle
 

1891
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,950
circle from a circle
it also is the place where the image

1892
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:40,960
it also is the place where the image
 

1893
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,829
it also is the place where the image
does not move very fast so if you want

1894
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:43,839
does not move very fast so if you want
 

1895
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:46,470
does not move very fast so if you want
to get close to there you just twiddle

1896
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:46,480
to get close to there you just twiddle
 

1897
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,950
to get close to there you just twiddle
it this is manipulative experimentation

1898
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:50,960
it this is manipulative experimentation
 

1899
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,630
it this is manipulative experimentation
taking advantage through his

1900
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:53,640
taking advantage through his
 

1901
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,750
taking advantage through his
mathematical knowledge

1902
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:55,760
mathematical knowledge
 

1903
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,510
mathematical knowledge
of the inherent inaccuracies that label

1904
00:36:59,510 --> 00:36:59,520
of the inherent inaccuracies that label
 

1905
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,829
of the inherent inaccuracies that label
let you come to exact conclusions

1906
00:37:02,829 --> 00:37:02,839
let you come to exact conclusions
 

1907
00:37:02,839 --> 00:37:06,630
let you come to exact conclusions
regardless of the built-in problematics

1908
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:06,640
regardless of the built-in problematics
 

1909
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,430
regardless of the built-in problematics
of measurement he's the only one i know

1910
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:09,440
of measurement he's the only one i know
 

1911
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,630
of measurement he's the only one i know
of doing anything like that at the time

1912
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:12,640
of doing anything like that at the time
 

1913
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,829
of doing anything like that at the time
yeah

1914
00:37:13,829 --> 00:37:13,839
yeah
 

1915
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:15,829
yeah
well even still there's very few people

1916
00:37:15,829 --> 00:37:15,839
well even still there's very few people
 

1917
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,910
well even still there's very few people
that are able to have to calculate as

1918
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:17,920
that are able to have to calculate as
 

1919
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,190
that are able to have to calculate as
well as he did to be a theoretician

1920
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:21,200
well as he did to be a theoretician
 

1921
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,589
well as he did to be a theoretician
and an experimentalist

1922
00:37:23,589 --> 00:37:23,599
and an experimentalist
 

1923
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,230
and an experimentalist
like in the same moment

1924
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:26,240
like in the same moment
 

1925
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,150
like in the same moment
right um it's it's true although until

1926
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:30,160
right um it's it's true although until
 

1927
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,910
right um it's it's true although until
uh the um

1928
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:31,920
uh the um
 

1929
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,510
uh the um
really the

1930
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:33,520
really the
 

1931
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,030
really the
well into the 20th century

1932
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:37,040
well into the 20th century
 

1933
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,870
well into the 20th century
maybe the beginning of the 20th century

1934
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:38,880
maybe the beginning of the 20th century
 

1935
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,150
maybe the beginning of the 20th century
really

1936
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:40,160
really
 

1937
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,790
really
most of the most significant

1938
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:42,800
most of the most significant
 

1939
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,030
most of the most significant
experimental results

1940
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:45,040
experimental results
 

1941
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,510
experimental results
produced in the 1800s

1942
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:47,520
produced in the 1800s
 

1943
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,589
produced in the 1800s
which laid the foundations for light

1944
00:37:49,589 --> 00:37:49,599
which laid the foundations for light
 

1945
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,510
which laid the foundations for light
electricity electrodynamics and so on

1946
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:53,520
electricity electrodynamics and so on
 

1947
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,910
electricity electrodynamics and so on
even

1948
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:54,920
even
 

1949
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,990
even
hydrodynamics and whatnot were also

1950
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:58,000
hydrodynamics and whatnot were also
 

1951
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,950
hydrodynamics and whatnot were also
produced by people who are both

1952
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:00,960
produced by people who are both
 

1953
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,829
produced by people who are both
excellent

1954
00:38:02,829 --> 00:38:02,839
excellent
 

1955
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:04,470
excellent
calculators uh

1956
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:04,480
calculators uh
 

1957
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,510
calculators uh
very talented mathematicians and good

1958
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:07,520
very talented mathematicians and good
 

1959
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,349
very talented mathematicians and good
with their hands experimentally

1960
00:38:11,349 --> 00:38:11,359

 

1961
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:13,430

and then that led to the 21st century

1962
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:13,440
and then that led to the 21st century
 

1963
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,470
and then that led to the 21st century
with enrico from me that uh

1964
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:16,480
with enrico from me that uh
 

1965
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,710
with enrico from me that uh
one of the one of the last people that

1966
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:18,720
one of the one of the last people that
 

1967
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,470
one of the one of the last people that
was able to do that

1968
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:20,480
was able to do that
 

1969
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,470
was able to do that
both of those things very well and that

1970
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:22,480
both of those things very well and that
 

1971
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,589
both of those things very well and that
uh

1972
00:38:23,589 --> 00:38:23,599
uh
 

1973
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,670
uh
he built a little device called an

1974
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:25,680
he built a little device called an
 

1975
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,270
he built a little device called an
atomic bomb

1976
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:27,280
atomic bomb
 

1977
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,069
atomic bomb
that has some positives and negatives

1978
00:38:30,069 --> 00:38:30,079
that has some positives and negatives
 

1979
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:32,069
that has some positives and negatives
right of course that actually did

1980
00:38:32,069 --> 00:38:32,079
right of course that actually did
 

1981
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:34,069
right of course that actually did
involve some pretty large-scale

1982
00:38:34,069 --> 00:38:34,079
involve some pretty large-scale
 

1983
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,230
involve some pretty large-scale
elaborate equipment too yeah while

1984
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:36,240
elaborate equipment too yeah while
 

1985
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,270
elaborate equipment too yeah while
holding a

1986
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:37,280
holding a
 

1987
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,870
holding a
prism in your hands

1988
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:38,880
prism in your hands
 

1989
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,109
prism in your hands
right no what uh what's the controversy

1990
00:38:41,109 --> 00:38:41,119
right no what uh what's the controversy
 

1991
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,829
right no what uh what's the controversy

some of the investigations that had been

00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:35,760
some of the investigations that had been
 

2257
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,030
some of the investigations that had been
done in this

2258
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:37,040
done in this
 

2259
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,030
done in this
period before him to create the

2260
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:39,040
period before him to create the
 

2261
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:42,470
period before him to create the
foundations of a way of investigating

2262
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:42,480
foundations of a way of investigating
 

2263
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,390
foundations of a way of investigating
processes that happen and change

2264
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:45,400
processes that happen and change
 

2265
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,230
processes that happen and change
continuously instead of by leaps and

2266
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:48,240
continuously instead of by leaps and
 

2267
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,710
continuously instead of by leaps and
bounds and so on forming the foundation

2268
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:50,720
bounds and so on forming the foundation
 

2269
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,349
bounds and so on forming the foundation
of what we now call the calculus yeah

2270
00:43:53,349 --> 00:43:53,359
of what we now call the calculus yeah
 

2271
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:54,710
of what we now call the calculus yeah
so

2272
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:54,720
so
 

2273
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,309

how rigorous the mathematics was at that

2322
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:49,760
how rigorous the mathematics was at that
 

2323
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,430
how rigorous the mathematics was at that
point i'm sure it was

2324
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:51,440
point i'm sure it was
 

2325
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,190
point i'm sure it was
geometry and so on no calculus huh

2326
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:55,200
geometry and so on no calculus huh
 

2327
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,670
geometry and so on no calculus huh
there are elements of what turned into

2328
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:57,680
there are elements of what turned into
 

2329
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,790
there are elements of what turned into
the calculus that predate newton but how

2330
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:00,800
the calculus that predate newton but how
 

2331
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,470
the calculus that predate newton but how
much how much rigor was there how much

2332
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:02,480
much how much rigor was there how much
 

2333
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,790
much how much rigor was there how much
uh well rigor no

2334
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:04,800
uh well rigor no
 

2335
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,829
uh well rigor no
and then of course no scientific method

2336
00:45:07,829 --> 00:45:07,839
and then of course no scientific method
 

2337
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:10,710
and then of course no scientific method
not really i mean somewhat like

2338
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:10,720
not really i mean somewhat like
 

2339
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,270
not really i mean somewhat like
i mean appreciation of data

2340
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:13,280
i mean appreciation of data
 

2341
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,430
i mean appreciation of data
ah that is a separate question from a

2342
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:15,440
ah that is a separate question from a
 

2343
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,910
ah that is a separate question from a
question of method appreciation of data

2344
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:17,920
question of method appreciation of data
 

2345
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,829
question of method appreciation of data
is a significant question

2346
00:45:19,829 --> 00:45:19,839
is a significant question
 

2347
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:21,589
is a significant question
as to what you do with data there's lots

2348
00:45:21,589 --> 00:45:21,599
as to what you do with data there's lots
 

2349
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:24,309
as to what you do with data there's lots
of things you're asking i apologize so

2350
00:45:24,309 --> 00:45:24,319
of things you're asking i apologize so

maybe let's backtrack and the first
 

2353
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:27,910
maybe let's backtrack and the first
question is was there something that was

2354
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:27,920
question is was there something that was
 

2355
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:31,430
question is was there something that was
bothering him that he especially

common and he built a large observatory
 

2657
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:25,430
common and he built a large observatory
on the top of his uh brewery actually

00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,190
instruments to make observations of
positions of the stars and he published

00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:39,200
positions of the stars and he published
 

2671
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,750
positions of the stars and he published
a whole new catalog of where the stars

you

2686
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:53,760
you
 

2687
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,750
you
didn't use a telescope here of any kind

2688
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:55,760
didn't use a telescope here of any kind
 

2689
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,829
didn't use a telescope here of any kind
because what's the point

2690
00:51:57,829 --> 00:51:57,839
because what's the point
 

2691
00:51:57,839 --> 00:51:59,670
because what's the point
unless you do something to the telescope

2692
00:51:59,670 --> 00:51:59,680
unless you do something to the telescope
 

2693
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,470
unless you do something to the telescope
all you see are dots with stars you just

2694
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:02,480
all you see are dots with stars you just
 

2695
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,470
all you see are dots with stars you just
use your eye your eyes can't be that

2696
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:04,480
use your eye your eyes can't be that
 

2697
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,630
use your eye your eyes can't be that
good it's impossible

00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:06,640
good it's impossible
 

2699
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,230
good it's impossible
so what did hook do to prove this he

2700
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:08,240
so what did hook do to prove this he
 

2701
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,069
so what did hook do to prove this he
said what you should have done is you

said what you should have done is you
 

2703
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:12,069
said what you should have done is you
should have put a little device in the

00:52:12,069 --> 00:52:12,079
should have put a little device in the
 

2705
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:13,589
should have put a little device in the
telescope that lets you measure

2706
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:13,599
telescope that lets you measure
 

2707
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:16,150
telescope that lets you measure
distances between these dots you didn't

2708

distances between these dots you didn't
 

2709
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,230
distances between these dots you didn't
do that and because you didn't there's

2710
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:18,240
do that and because you didn't there's
 

2711
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:21,670
do that and because you didn't there's
no way you could have been that good

move back looking at it
 

2733
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:45,829
move back looking at it
presumably with one eye until you can't

presumably with one eye until you can't
tell the the black ones from the white

tell the the black ones from the white
stripes he says

stripes he says
 

2739
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,230

that i can then measure the distance i

2740
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:52,240
that i can then measure the distance i
 

2741
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:55,670
that i can then measure the distance i
can see the angles i can give a number

can see the angles i can give a number
then for what is the best possible

00:52:59,030 --> 00:52:59,040
then for what is the best possible
 

2745
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:02,390
then for what is the best possible
what we would uh call perceptual acuity

2746
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:02,400
what we would uh call perceptual acuity
 

2747
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,069
what we would uh call perceptual acuity
of human vision

2748
00:53:04,069 --> 00:53:04,079
of human vision
 

2749
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:07,109
of human vision
and it turned out he thought to be

2750
00:53:07,109 --> 00:53:07,119
and it turned out he thought to be
 

2751
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:11,030
and it turned out he thought to be
something like 10 or more times worse

2752
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:11,040
something like 10 or more times worse
 

2753
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,270
something like 10 or more times worse
than this guy hevelius had claimed so

2754
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:13,280
than this guy hevelius had claimed so
 

2755
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,670
than this guy hevelius had claimed so
obviously says hook of alias

2756
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:15,680
obviously says hook of alias
 

2757
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:16,870
obviously says hook of alias
right well

2758
00:53:16,870 --> 00:53:16,880
right well
 

2759
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,150
right well
years ago

2760
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:18,160
years ago
 

2761
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,109
years ago
i calculated um hevelius's numbers and

2762
00:53:21,109 --> 00:53:21,119
i calculated um hevelius's numbers and
 

2763
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:23,750
i calculated um hevelius's numbers and
so on using modern uh

2764
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:23,760
so on using modern uh
 

2765
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,230
so on using modern uh
tables from nasa and so on and they are

2766
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:26,240
tables from nasa and so on and they are
 

2767
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,790
tables from nasa and so on and they are
even more accurate than hevelius claimed

2768
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:28,800
even more accurate than hevelius claimed
 

2769
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,190
even more accurate than hevelius claimed
and worse than that

2770
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:31,200
and worse than that
 

2771
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,870
and worse than that
the royal society sent a young

2772
00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:32,880
the royal society sent a young
 

2773
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,870
the royal society sent a young
astronomer named hallie

2774
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:34,880
astronomer named hallie
 

2775
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,270
astronomer named hallie
over to dunsig to work with him and

2776
00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:37,280
over to dunsig to work with him and
 

2777
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,190
over to dunsig to work with him and
halley writes back and he says i

2778
00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:39,200
halley writes back and he says i
 

2779
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,549
halley writes back and he says i
couldn't believe it

2780
00:53:40,549 --> 00:53:40,559
couldn't believe it
 

2781
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:42,790
couldn't believe it
but i could he taught me how to do it

2782
00:53:42,790 --> 00:53:42,800
but i could he taught me how to do it
 

2783
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,630
but i could he taught me how to do it
and i could get just as good as he how

2784
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:44,640
and i could get just as good as he how
 

2785
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,069
and i could get just as good as he how
is it possible

2786
00:53:46,069 --> 00:53:46,079
is it possible
 

2787
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:48,069
is it possible
well here this shows you something very

2788
00:53:48,069 --> 00:53:48,079
well here this shows you something very
 

2789
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:51,030
well here this shows you something very
interesting about experiments perception

2790
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:51,040
interesting about experiments perception
 

2791
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,349
interesting about experiments perception
and everything else hook was right but

2792
00:53:53,349 --> 00:53:53,359
and everything else hook was right but
 

2793
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:55,589
and everything else hook was right but
he was also wrong

2794
00:53:55,589 --> 00:53:55,599
he was also wrong
 

2795
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:58,470
he was also wrong
he was wrong for the right reasons

2796
00:53:58,470 --> 00:53:58,480
he was wrong for the right reasons
 

2797
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,470
he was wrong for the right reasons
and he was right for the wrong reasons

and he was right for the wrong reasons
 

2799
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:04,710
and he was right for the wrong reasons
and what do i mean by that

2800
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:04,720

 

2801
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,030

what he actually found

2802
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:07,040
what he actually found
 

2803
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,349
what he actually found
was the number for what we now call 2020

2804
00:54:09,349 --> 00:54:09,359
was the number for what we now call 2020
 

2805
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:11,670
was the number for what we now call 2020
vision he was right

2806
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:11,680
vision he was right
 

2807
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:14,710
vision he was right
you can't tell except a few people much

2808
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:14,720
you can't tell except a few people much
 

2809

you can't tell except a few people much
better than that

2810
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:16,160
better than that
 

2811
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,109
better than that
yeah

2812
00:54:17,109 --> 00:54:17,119
yeah

2840
00:54:54,069 --> 00:54:54,079

2841
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:55,109

five or more times better yeah that's

2848
00:55:01,349 --> 00:55:01,359
five or more times better yeah that's
 

2849
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:02,630
five or more times better yeah that's
fascinating

2850
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:02,640
fascinating
 

2851
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:05,990
fascinating
damn uh and of course

2852
00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:06,000
damn uh and of course
 

2853
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,710
damn uh and of course
i mean i maybe you can comment on

2854
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:08,720
i mean i maybe you can comment on
 

2855
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,549
i mean i maybe you can comment on
their understanding

2856

perception works and they were probably
 

2877
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,270

they probably didn't have any conception

talking about well actually they do

3252
01:02:40,789 --> 01:02:40,799
talking about well actually they do
 

3253
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:42,549
talking about well actually they do
sometimes talk like that

3254
01:02:42,549 --> 01:02:42,559
sometimes talk like that
 

3255
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:45,190
sometimes talk like that
but that is love that i meant

3256
01:02:45,190 --> 01:02:45,200
but that is love that i meant
 

3257
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,910
but that is love that i meant
i see now i talk like that all the time

3258

i see now i talk like that all the time
 

3259
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,670
i see now i talk like that all the time
i think love is somehow

3260
01:02:49,670 --> 01:02:49,680
i think love is somehow
 

3261
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,910
i think love is somehow

01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:15,350
in the same way
it's also a period in which

3634
01:10:15,350 --> 01:10:15,360

 

3635
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:17,350

procedures and rules

3636
01:10:17,350 --> 01:10:17,360
procedures and rules
 

3637
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:20,790
procedures and rules
of practice are being developed to avoid

3638
01:10:20,790 --> 01:10:20,800
of practice are being developed to avoid
 

3639
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,510
of practice are being developed to avoid
um attacking one another directly and

3640
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:23,520
um attacking one another directly and
 

3641
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:25,110
um attacking one another directly and
pulling out a sword to cut off the other

3642
01:10:25,110 --> 01:10:25,120
pulling out a sword to cut off the other
 

3643
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:27,430
pulling out a sword to cut off the other
guy's head if he disagrees with you

3644
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:27,440
guy's head if he disagrees with you
 

3645
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:28,950
guy's head if he disagrees with you
and so on

3646
01:10:28,950 --> 01:10:28,960
and so on
 

3647
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:31,750
and so on
so it's a very different period

3648
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:31,760
so it's a very different period
 

3649
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:34,470
so it's a very different period
controversies happen people get angry i

3650
01:10:34,470 --> 01:10:34,480
controversies happen people get angry i
 

3651
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,550
controversies happen people get angry i
can think of a number of others

3652
01:10:36,550 --> 01:10:36,560
can think of a number of others
 

3653
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:38,630
can think of a number of others
including in the development of optics

3654
01:10:38,630 --> 01:10:38,640
including in the development of optics
 

3655
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:41,430
including in the development of optics
in the 19th century and so on

3656
01:10:41,430 --> 01:10:41,440
in the 19th century and so on
 

3657
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:44,790
in the 19th century and so on
and it can get hot under the collar

3658
01:10:44,790 --> 01:10:44,800
and it can get hot under the collar
 

3659
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,070
and it can get hot under the collar
sometimes

3660
01:10:46,070 --> 01:10:46,080
sometimes
 

3661
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:49,030
sometimes
one character who's worked an area

3662
01:10:49,030 --> 01:10:49,040
one character who's worked an area
 

3663
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:50,950
one character who's worked an area
extensively whether they've come up with

3664
01:10:50,950 --> 01:10:50,960
extensively whether they've come up with
 

3665
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:53,110
extensively whether they've come up with
something terribly novel or not and

3666
01:10:53,110 --> 01:10:53,120
something terribly novel or not and
 

3667
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:55,750
something terribly novel or not and
somebody else kind of moves in

3668
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:55,760
somebody else kind of moves in
 

3669
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:56,870
somebody else kind of moves in
and

3670
01:10:56,870 --> 01:10:56,880
and
 

3671
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:59,189
and
does completely different novel things

3672
01:10:59,189 --> 01:10:59,199
does completely different novel things
 

3673
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:01,510
does completely different novel things
the first guy gets upset about it

3674
01:11:01,510 --> 01:11:01,520
the first guy gets upset about it
 

3675
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:04,149
the first guy gets upset about it
because he's sort of muscled into what i

3676
01:11:04,149 --> 01:11:04,159
because he's sort of muscled into what i
 

3677
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:06,630
because he's sort of muscled into what i
thought was my area yeah and you find

3678
01:11:06,630 --> 01:11:06,640
thought was my area yeah and you find
 

3679
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:08,310
thought was my area yeah and you find
that sort of stuff but uh do you have

3680
01:11:08,310 --> 01:11:08,320
that sort of stuff but uh do you have
 

3681
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:10,790
that sort of stuff but uh do you have
examples of cases where it worked out

3682
01:11:10,790 --> 01:11:10,800
examples of cases where it worked out
 

3683
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:13,510
examples of cases where it worked out
well like uh that competition is good

3684
01:11:13,510 --> 01:11:13,520
well like uh that competition is good
 

3685
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:15,350
well like uh that competition is good
for the progress of science yeah it

3686
01:11:15,350 --> 01:11:15,360
for the progress of science yeah it
 

3687
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:18,229
for the progress of science yeah it
almost always is good in that sense so

3688
01:11:18,229 --> 01:11:18,239
almost always is good in that sense so
 

3689
01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:19,830
almost always is good in that sense so
it's just painful for the individuals

3690
01:11:19,830 --> 01:11:19,840
it's just painful for the individuals
 

3691
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:21,910
it's just painful for the individuals
and b yeah it doesn't have to be you

3692
01:11:21,910 --> 01:11:21,920
and b yeah it doesn't have to be you
 

3693
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:23,590
and b yeah it doesn't have to be you
know nasty

3694
01:11:23,590 --> 01:11:23,600
know nasty
 

3695
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:25,990
know nasty
although sometimes it is so on the space

3696
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:26,000
although sometimes it is so on the space
 

3697
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,669
although sometimes it is so on the space
like for the example of the optics could

3698
01:11:27,669 --> 01:11:27,679
like for the example of the optics could
 

3699
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:30,070
like for the example of the optics could
you comment on that one well yeah sure

3700
01:11:30,070 --> 01:11:30,080
you comment on that one well yeah sure
 

3701
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:31,669
you comment on that one well yeah sure
let me there are several but

3702
01:11:31,669 --> 01:11:31,679
let me there are several but
 

3703
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:35,669
let me there are several but
i could give you um

3704
01:11:35,669 --> 01:11:35,679

 

3705
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:37,350

all right so i'll give you this example

3706
01:11:37,350 --> 01:11:37,360
all right so i'll give you this example
 

3707
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:39,270
all right so i'll give you this example
that probably is

3708
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:39,280
that probably is
 

3709
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:43,430
that probably is
the most pertinent um

3710
01:11:43,430 --> 01:11:43,440

 

3711
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:45,669

the first

3712
01:11:45,669 --> 01:11:45,679
the first
 

3713
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:49,030
the first
polytechnic school like mit or caltech

3714
01:11:49,030 --> 01:11:49,040
polytechnic school like mit or caltech
 

3715
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:50,870
polytechnic school like mit or caltech
was actually founded in france during

was actually founded in france during
 

3717
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,030
was actually founded in france during
the french revolution it exists today

it's the egg called pulley technique

3720
01:11:55,510 --> 01:11:55,520
it's the egg called pulley technique
 

3721
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:56,790
it's the egg called pulley technique
right

3722
01:11:56,790 --> 01:11:56,800
right

01:12:56,310 --> 01:12:56,320
to paris and so on he's greeted as a
 

3773
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:59,350
to paris and so on he's greeted as a
hero and what not in the meantime b.o

01:13:00,870 --> 01:13:00,880
has pretty much published some of the
 

3777
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:02,390
has pretty much published some of the
stuff that he's done and arago doesn't

3778
01:13:02,390 --> 01:13:02,400
stuff that he's done and arago doesn't
 

3779
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:04,950
stuff that he's done and arago doesn't
get much credit for it and aragog starts

3780
01:13:04,950 --> 01:13:04,960
get much credit for it and aragog starts
 

3781
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:08,709
get much credit for it and aragog starts
to get very angry and bo is known for

01:13:08,709 --> 01:13:08,719
to get very angry and bo is known for
 

3783
01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:13,990
to get very angry and bo is known for
this kind of thing so hour ago anyway

01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:41,590
during a pandemic
we're on the outskirts of a pandemic

4122
01:19:41,590 --> 01:19:41,600
we're on the outskirts of a pandemic
 

4123
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:44,229
we're on the outskirts of a pandemic
ourselves right and a lot of people use

4124
01:19:44,229 --> 01:19:44,239
ourselves right and a lot of people use
 

4125
01:19:44,239 --> 01:19:46,870
ourselves right and a lot of people use
that example as motivation for everybody

4126
01:19:46,870 --> 01:19:46,880
that example as motivation for everybody
 

4127
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,709
that example as motivation for everybody
while they're in lockdown to get stuff

4128
01:19:48,709 --> 01:19:48,719
while they're in lockdown to get stuff
 

4129
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:49,590
while they're in lockdown to get stuff
done

4130
01:19:49,590 --> 01:19:49,600
done
 

4131
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:50,709
done
uh so

4132
01:19:50,709 --> 01:19:50,719
uh so
 

4133
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:52,229
uh so
what's that about can you tell the story

4134
01:19:52,229 --> 01:19:52,239
what's that about can you tell the story
 

4135
01:19:52,239 --> 01:19:53,110
what's that about can you tell the story
of that

4136
01:19:53,110 --> 01:19:53,120
of that
 

4137
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:55,350
of that
well i can let me first say that uh of

4138
01:19:55,350 --> 01:19:55,360
well i can let me first say that uh of
 

4139
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:57,669
well i can let me first say that uh of
course we've been teaching over zoom

4140
01:19:57,669 --> 01:19:57,679
course we've been teaching over zoom
 

4141
01:19:57,679 --> 01:20:00,070
course we've been teaching over zoom
lately and there's no zoom back then

4142
01:20:00,070 --> 01:20:00,080
lately and there's no zoom back then
 

4143
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:02,149
lately and there's no zoom back then
yeah there was no zoom back then

4144
01:20:02,149 --> 01:20:02,159
yeah there was no zoom back then
 

4145
01:20:02,159 --> 01:20:03,270
yeah there was no zoom back then
although it wouldn't have made much

4146
01:20:03,270 --> 01:20:03,280
although it wouldn't have made much
 

4147
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:04,790
although it wouldn't have made much
difference because the story was newton

4148
01:20:04,790 --> 01:20:04,800
difference because the story was newton
 

4149
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,870
difference because the story was newton
was so complicated in his lectures that

4150
01:20:06,870 --> 01:20:06,880
was so complicated in his lectures that
 

4151
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:08,470
was so complicated in his lectures that
at one point the humphrey newton

4152
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:08,480
at one point the humphrey newton
 

4153
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:10,629
at one point the humphrey newton
actually said that he might as well have

4154
01:20:10,629 --> 01:20:10,639
actually said that he might as well have
 

4155
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:11,910
actually said that he might as well have
just been lecturing to the walls because

4156
01:20:11,910 --> 01:20:11,920
just been lecturing to the walls because
 

4157
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:14,629
just been lecturing to the walls because
nobody was there yeah to listen to it so

4158
01:20:14,629 --> 01:20:14,639
nobody was there yeah to listen to it so
 

4159
01:20:14,639 --> 01:20:17,030
nobody was there yeah to listen to it so
what difference but uh also not a great

4160
01:20:17,030 --> 01:20:17,040
what difference but uh also not a great
 

4161
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:20,229
what difference but uh also not a great
teacher huh i if you look at his optical

4162
01:20:20,229 --> 01:20:20,239
teacher huh i if you look at his optical
 

4163
01:20:20,239 --> 01:20:21,189
teacher huh i if you look at his optical
notes

4164
01:20:21,189 --> 01:20:21,199
notes
 

4165
01:20:21,199 --> 01:20:23,590
notes
if that's what he's reading from oh boy

4166
01:20:23,590 --> 01:20:23,600
if that's what he's reading from oh boy
 

4167
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:25,430
if that's what he's reading from oh boy
okay

4168
01:20:25,430 --> 01:20:25,440
okay
 

4169
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:27,910
okay
no

4170
01:20:27,910 --> 01:20:27,920

 

4171
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:30,229

so what uh what can you say about that

4172
01:20:30,229 --> 01:20:30,239
so what uh what can you say about that
 

4173
01:20:30,239 --> 01:20:33,189
so what uh what can you say about that
whole journey through the pandemic

4174
01:20:33,189 --> 01:20:33,199
whole journey through the pandemic
 

4175
01:20:33,199 --> 01:20:35,110
whole journey through the pandemic
that uh that resulted in so much

4176
01:20:35,110 --> 01:20:35,120
that uh that resulted in so much
 

4177
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:38,310
that uh that resulted in so much
innovation right of amount of time well

4178
01:20:38,310 --> 01:20:38,320
innovation right of amount of time well
 

4179
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:40,709
innovation right of amount of time well
i mean there's two times that he goes

4180
01:20:40,709 --> 01:20:40,719
i mean there's two times that he goes
 

4181
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:42,390
i mean there's two times that he goes
home

4182
01:20:42,390 --> 01:20:42,400
home
 

4183
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:44,550
home
would he have been able to do it and do

4184
01:20:44,550 --> 01:20:44,560
would he have been able to do it and do
 

4185
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:46,390
would he have been able to do it and do
do it if you'd stayed at cambridge i

4186
01:20:46,390 --> 01:20:46,400
do it if you'd stayed at cambridge i
 

4187
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:47,910
do it if you'd stayed at cambridge i
think you would have

4188
01:20:47,910 --> 01:20:47,920
think you would have
 

4189
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:50,229
think you would have
i don't think it really uh although i do

4190
01:20:50,229 --> 01:20:50,239
i don't think it really uh although i do
 

4191
01:20:50,239 --> 01:20:52,149
i don't think it really uh although i do
like to tell my advanced students when i

4192
01:20:52,149 --> 01:20:52,159
like to tell my advanced students when i
 

4193
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:54,149
like to tell my advanced students when i
lecture on the history of physics to the

4194
01:20:54,149 --> 01:20:54,159
lecture on the history of physics to the
 

4195
01:20:54,159 --> 01:20:56,390
lecture on the history of physics to the
physics and chemistry students

4196
01:20:56,390 --> 01:20:56,400
physics and chemistry students
 

4197
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,149
physics and chemistry students
especially we've been doing it over zoom

4198
01:20:58,149 --> 01:20:58,159
especially we've been doing it over zoom
 

4199
01:20:58,159 --> 01:21:00,310
especially we've been doing it over zoom
last year when we get to newton and so

4200
01:21:00,310 --> 01:21:00,320
last year when we get to newton and so
 

4201
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:03,430
last year when we get to newton and so
on because these kids are you know 21 22

4202
01:21:03,430 --> 01:21:03,440
on because these kids are you know 21 22
 

4203
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:05,510
on because these kids are you know 21 22
i like to say well you know when newton

4204
01:21:05,510 --> 01:21:05,520
i like to say well you know when newton
 

4205
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:06,950
i like to say well you know when newton
was your age

4206
01:21:06,950 --> 01:21:06,960
was your age
 

4207
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:08,790
was your age
and he had to go home

4208
01:21:08,790 --> 01:21:08,800
and he had to go home
 

4209
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:10,629
and he had to go home
during an epidemic do you know what he

4210
01:21:10,629 --> 01:21:10,639
during an epidemic do you know what he
 

4211
01:21:10,639 --> 01:21:12,310
during an epidemic do you know what he
produced

4212
01:21:12,310 --> 01:21:12,320
produced
 

4213
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:13,990
produced
so can you actually summarize this for

4214
01:21:13,990 --> 01:21:14,000
so can you actually summarize this for
 

4215
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,830
so can you actually summarize this for
people who don't know how old was newton

4216
01:21:15,830 --> 01:21:15,840
people who don't know how old was newton
 

4217
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:18,229
people who don't know how old was newton
and what did he produce

4218
01:21:18,229 --> 01:21:18,239
and what did he produce
 

4219
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:20,550
and what did he produce
well newton goes up to cambridge as it

4220
01:21:20,550 --> 01:21:20,560
well newton goes up to cambridge as it
 

4221
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:24,629
well newton goes up to cambridge as it
said when he's 18 years old in 1660

4222
01:21:24,629 --> 01:21:24,639
said when he's 18 years old in 1660
 

4223
01:21:24,639 --> 01:21:28,550
said when he's 18 years old in 1660
and the so-called miraculous year

4224
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:28,560
and the so-called miraculous year
 

4225
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:31,110
and the so-called miraculous year
the anus mirabilis where you get the

4226
01:21:31,110 --> 01:21:31,120
the anus mirabilis where you get the
 

4227
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:33,910
the anus mirabilis where you get the
development in the calculus and in

4228
01:21:33,910 --> 01:21:33,920
development in the calculus and in
 

4229
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:38,629
development in the calculus and in
optical discoveries especially is 1666

4230
01:21:38,629 --> 01:21:38,639
optical discoveries especially is 1666
 

4231
01:21:38,639 --> 01:21:42,550
optical discoveries especially is 1666
right so he's what 24 years old at the

4232
01:21:42,550 --> 01:21:42,560
right so he's what 24 years old at the
 

4233
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:45,350
right so he's what 24 years old at the
time but judging from his

4234
01:21:45,350 --> 01:21:45,360
time but judging from his
 

4235
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:47,590
time but judging from his
the notebooks that i mentioned he's

4236
01:21:47,590 --> 01:21:47,600
the notebooks that i mentioned he's
 

4237
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:51,030
the notebooks that i mentioned he's
already before that come to an awful lot

4238
01:21:51,030 --> 01:21:51,040
already before that come to an awful lot
 

4239
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:54,390
already before that come to an awful lot
of uh developments uh over the previous

4240
01:21:54,390 --> 01:21:54,400
of uh developments uh over the previous
 

4241
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,790
of uh developments uh over the previous
couple of years

4242
01:21:56,790 --> 01:21:56,800
couple of years
 

4243
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,550
couple of years
does it have much to do with the fact

4244
01:21:58,550 --> 01:21:58,560
does it have much to do with the fact
 

4245
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:00,709
does it have much to do with the fact
that he twice went home

4246
01:22:00,709 --> 01:22:00,719
that he twice went home
 

4247
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:02,070
that he twice went home
it is true

4248
01:22:02,070 --> 01:22:02,080
it is true
 

4249
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:04,310
it is true
that the optical experiments that we

4250
01:22:04,310 --> 01:22:04,320
that the optical experiments that we
 

4251
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:06,229
that the optical experiments that we
talked of a while ago with the light on

4252
01:22:06,229 --> 01:22:06,239
talked of a while ago with the light on
 

4253
01:22:06,239 --> 01:22:08,390
talked of a while ago with the light on
the wall moving up and down were done at

4254
01:22:08,390 --> 01:22:08,400
the wall moving up and down were done at
 

4255
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:11,110
the wall moving up and down were done at
home in fact you can visit the very room

4256
01:22:11,110 --> 01:22:11,120
home in fact you can visit the very room
 

4257
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:13,750
home in fact you can visit the very room
he did it in to this day

4258
01:22:13,750 --> 01:22:13,760
he did it in to this day
 

4259
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,830
he did it in to this day
yeah it's very cool and if you look

4260
01:22:15,830 --> 01:22:15,840
yeah it's very cool and if you look
 

4261
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:18,149
yeah it's very cool and if you look
through the window in that room there is

4262
01:22:18,149 --> 01:22:18,159
through the window in that room there is
 

4263
01:22:18,159 --> 01:22:19,830
through the window in that room there is
an apple tree

4264
01:22:19,830 --> 01:22:19,840
an apple tree
 

4265
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,910
an apple tree
out there in the garden so you might be

4266
01:22:21,910 --> 01:22:21,920
out there in the garden so you might be
 

4267
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:23,189
out there in the garden so you might be
wrong about this

4268
01:22:23,189 --> 01:22:23,199
wrong about this
 

4269
01:22:23,199 --> 01:22:24,790
wrong about this
i thought you were lying to me what

4270
01:22:24,790 --> 01:22:24,800
i thought you were lying to me what
 

4271
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:26,310
i thought you were lying to me what
maybe there's an apple involved after

4272
01:22:26,310 --> 01:22:26,320
maybe there's an apple involved after
 

4273
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:28,709
maybe there's an apple involved after
all well it's it's not the same apple

4274
01:22:28,709 --> 01:22:28,719
all well it's it's not the same apple
 

4275
01:22:28,719 --> 01:22:31,430
all well it's it's not the same apple
tree but it's cuttings how do you know

4276
01:22:31,430 --> 01:22:31,440
tree but it's cuttings how do you know
 

4277
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:33,669
tree but it's cuttings how do you know

because he recognized um
 

4327
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:28,950
because he recognized um
not newton may not have learned too much

4328
01:23:28,950 --> 01:23:28,960
not newton may not have learned too much
 

4329
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:31,030
not newton may not have learned too much

from him although they did interact
 

4331
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:33,350
from him although they did interact
and and so newton was the first lucasian

4332
01:23:33,350 --> 01:23:33,360
and and so newton was the first lucasian
 

4333
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:35,510
and and so newton was the first lucasian

01:29:03,110 --> 01:29:03,120
it's it's complicated that's by the way
 

4605
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:05,430
it's it's complicated that's by the way
that was discovered

4606
01:29:05,430 --> 01:29:05,440
that was discovered
 

4607
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:08,629
that was discovered
that was discovered by the babylonians

4608
01:29:08,629 --> 01:29:08,639
that was discovered by the babylonians
 

4609
01:29:08,639 --> 01:29:10,950
that was discovered by the babylonians
that fact in 19 years thousands of years

4610
01:29:10,950 --> 01:29:10,960
that fact in 19 years thousands of years
 

4611
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:12,629
that fact in 19 years thousands of years
ago yeah and then you have to look that

4612
01:29:12,629 --> 01:29:12,639
ago yeah and then you have to look that
 

4613
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:14,470
ago yeah and then you have to look that
little piece of data and how do you make

4614
01:29:14,470 --> 01:29:14,480
little piece of data and how do you make
 

4615
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:15,910
little piece of data and how do you make
sense of it well i mean that that is

4616
01:29:15,910 --> 01:29:15,920
sense of it well i mean that that is
 

4617
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:17,430
sense of it well i mean that that is
data and you have to and it's

4618
01:29:17,430 --> 01:29:17,440
data and you have to and it's
 

4619
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:20,470
data and you have to and it's
complicated so newton actually kind of

4620
01:29:20,470 --> 01:29:20,480
complicated so newton actually kind of
 

4621
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:23,350
complicated so newton actually kind of
reverse engineered a technique that had

4622
01:29:23,350 --> 01:29:23,360
reverse engineered a technique that had
 

4623
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:26,229
reverse engineered a technique that had
been developed by a man named horox

4624
01:29:26,229 --> 01:29:26,239
been developed by a man named horox
 

4625
01:29:26,239 --> 01:29:28,790
been developed by a man named horox
using certain laws of kepler's to try

4626
01:29:28,790 --> 01:29:28,800
using certain laws of kepler's to try
 

4627
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:31,110
using certain laws of kepler's to try
and get around this thing in newton then

4628
01:29:31,110 --> 01:29:31,120
and get around this thing in newton then
 

4629
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:32,070
and get around this thing in newton then
sort of

4630
01:29:32,070 --> 01:29:32,080
sort of
 

4631
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:33,910
sort of
my understanding i've never studied this

4632
01:29:33,910 --> 01:29:33,920
my understanding i've never studied this
 

4633
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:35,270
my understanding i've never studied this
has reversed

4634
01:29:35,270 --> 01:29:35,280
has reversed
 

4635
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:37,669
has reversed
sort of reversed it and fit it together

4636
01:29:37,669 --> 01:29:37,679
sort of reversed it and fit it together
 

4637
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:40,149
sort of reversed it and fit it together
with his force calculations by way of an

4638
01:29:40,149 --> 01:29:40,159
with his force calculations by way of an
 

4639
01:29:40,159 --> 01:29:42,149
with his force calculations by way of an
approximation

4640
01:29:42,149 --> 01:29:42,159
approximation
 

4641
01:29:42,159 --> 01:29:44,229
approximation
and

4642
01:29:44,229 --> 01:29:44,239
and
 

4643
01:29:44,239 --> 01:29:45,910
and
was able to construct a model to make

4644
01:29:45,910 --> 01:29:45,920
was able to construct a model to make
 

4645
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:48,470
was able to construct a model to make
some predictions

4646
01:29:48,470 --> 01:29:48,480
some predictions
 

4647
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:49,350
some predictions
fit

4648
01:29:49,350 --> 01:29:49,360
fit
 

4649
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:53,430
fit
things backwards pretty well

4650
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:53,440
things backwards pretty well
 

4651
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:54,950
things backwards pretty well
okay

4652
01:29:54,950 --> 01:29:54,960
okay
 

4653
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:57,590
okay
where does data fit into this we kind of

4654
01:29:57,590 --> 01:29:57,600
where does data fit into this we kind of
 

4655
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:00,550
where does data fit into this we kind of
earlier in the discussion

4656
01:30:00,550 --> 01:30:00,560
earlier in the discussion
 

4657
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:02,790
earlier in the discussion
uh mention data as part of the

4658
01:30:02,790 --> 01:30:02,800
uh mention data as part of the
 

4659
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:04,709
uh mention data as part of the
scientific method

4660
01:30:04,709 --> 01:30:04,719
scientific method
 

4661
01:30:04,719 --> 01:30:06,390
scientific method
how important was

4662
01:30:06,390 --> 01:30:06,400
how important was
 

4663
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:09,830
how important was
data to newton okay so like you

4664
01:30:09,830 --> 01:30:09,840
data to newton okay so like you
 

4665
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:12,629
data to newton okay so like you
mentioned uh prism and playing with it

4666
01:30:12,629 --> 01:30:12,639
mentioned uh prism and playing with it
 

4667
01:30:12,639 --> 01:30:14,390
mentioned uh prism and playing with it
and looking at stuff and then coming up

4668
01:30:14,390 --> 01:30:14,400
and looking at stuff and then coming up
 

4669
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,470
and looking at stuff and then coming up
with calculations and so on where does

4670
01:30:16,470 --> 01:30:16,480
with calculations and so on where does
 

4671
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:18,709
with calculations and so on where does
data fit into any of his ideas

4672
01:30:18,709 --> 01:30:18,719
data fit into any of his ideas
 

4673
01:30:18,719 --> 01:30:20,790
data fit into any of his ideas
all right well let me say two things

4674
01:30:20,790 --> 01:30:20,800
all right well let me say two things
 

4675
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:23,350
all right well let me say two things
first one we rarely use the phrase

4676
01:30:23,350 --> 01:30:23,360
first one we rarely use the phrase
 

4677
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:26,229
first one we rarely use the phrase
scientific method anymore because there

4678
01:30:26,229 --> 01:30:26,239
scientific method anymore because there
 

4679
01:30:26,239 --> 01:30:27,750
scientific method anymore because there
is no one

4680
01:30:27,750 --> 01:30:27,760
is no one
 

4681
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:28,950
is no one

mean humans have been playing around

4686
01:30:33,510 --> 01:30:33,520
mean humans have been playing around
 

4687
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:35,350
mean humans have been playing around
with the world and learning how to

humans
um

4696
01:30:42,470 --> 01:30:42,480
um
 

4697
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:43,990
um
do you have a preferred definition of

4698
01:30:43,990 --> 01:30:44,000
do you have a preferred definition of
 

4699
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,510
do you have a preferred definition of
the scientific method what are the

the scientific method what are the
 

4701
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:47,750
the scientific method what are the
various uh no i don't

4702
01:30:47,750 --> 01:30:47,760
various uh no i don't
 

4703
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:49,830
various uh no i don't
i prefer to talk about

4704
01:30:49,830 --> 01:30:49,840
i prefer to talk about
 

4705
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:52,870
i prefer to talk about
um

4706
01:30:52,870 --> 01:30:52,880

 

4707
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:53,750

the

4708
01:30:53,750 --> 01:30:53,760
the
 

4709
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:55,030
the
considered

4710
01:30:55,030 --> 01:30:55,040
considered
 

4711
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:58,629
considered
manipulation of artificial structures to

4712
01:30:58,629 --> 01:30:58,639
manipulation of artificial structures to
 

4713
01:30:58,639 --> 01:31:00,310
manipulation of artificial structures to
produce results

4714
01:31:00,310 --> 01:31:00,320
produce results
 

4715
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:05,110
produce results
that can be worked together with schemes

4716
01:31:05,110 --> 01:31:05,120
that can be worked together with schemes
 

4717
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:08,709
that can be worked together with schemes
to construct other devices and make

4718
01:31:08,709 --> 01:31:08,719
to construct other devices and make
 

4719
01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:11,030
to construct other devices and make
uh

4720
01:31:11,030 --> 01:31:11,040

 

4721
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:12,790

predictions if you will about the way

4722
01:31:12,790 --> 01:31:12,800
predictions if you will about the way
 

4723
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,390
predictions if you will about the way
such things will work

4724
01:31:14,390 --> 01:31:14,400
such things will work
 

4725
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:16,470
such things will work
so ultimately it's about producing other

4726
01:31:16,470 --> 01:31:16,480
so ultimately it's about producing other
 

4727
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:19,270
so ultimately it's about producing other
devices it's like leads you down uh i

4728
01:31:19,270 --> 01:31:19,280
devices it's like leads you down uh i
 

4729
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:21,270
devices it's like leads you down uh i
think so principally

4730
01:31:21,270 --> 01:31:21,280
think so principally
 

4731
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:24,149
think so principally
uh i mean you may have data if you will

4732
01:31:24,149 --> 01:31:24,159
uh i mean you may have data if you will
 

4733
01:31:24,159 --> 01:31:26,229
uh i mean you may have data if you will
like astronomical data

4734
01:31:26,229 --> 01:31:26,239
like astronomical data
 

4735
01:31:26,239 --> 01:31:29,189
like astronomical data
obtained otherwise and so on but yes

4736
01:31:29,189 --> 01:31:29,199
obtained otherwise and so on but yes
 

4737
01:31:29,199 --> 01:31:31,669
obtained otherwise and so on but yes
and but but but number two here is this

4738
01:31:31,669 --> 01:31:31,679
and but but but number two here is this
 

4739
01:31:31,679 --> 01:31:33,990
and but but but number two here is this
question of data what is data

4740
01:31:33,990 --> 01:31:34,000
question of data what is data
 

4741
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,669
question of data what is data
in that sense see when we talk about

4742
01:31:35,669 --> 01:31:35,679
in that sense see when we talk about
 

4743
01:31:35,679 --> 01:31:37,750
in that sense see when we talk about
data today

4744
01:31:37,750 --> 01:31:37,760
data today
 

4745
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:39,750
data today
um we have

4746
01:31:39,750 --> 01:31:39,760
um we have
 

4747
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:42,310
um we have
a kind of complex notion which

4748
01:31:42,310 --> 01:31:42,320
a kind of complex notion which
 

4749
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:45,590
a kind of complex notion which
reverts to even issues of statistics

4750
01:31:45,590 --> 01:31:45,600
reverts to even issues of statistics
 

4751
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:50,149
reverts to even issues of statistics
and measurement procedures and so on so

4752
01:31:50,149 --> 01:31:50,159
and measurement procedures and so on so
 

4753
01:31:50,159 --> 01:31:52,310
and measurement procedures and so on so
let me put it to you this way so

4754
01:31:52,310 --> 01:31:52,320
let me put it to you this way so
 

4755
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:55,030
let me put it to you this way so
let's say i had a ruler in front of me

4756
01:31:55,030 --> 01:31:55,040
let's say i had a ruler in front of me
 

4757
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:57,270
let's say i had a ruler in front of me
go on and it's marked off in little

4758
01:31:57,270 --> 01:31:57,280
go on and it's marked off in little
 

4759
01:31:57,280 --> 01:31:59,750
go on and it's marked off in little
black marks separated by let's say

4760
01:31:59,750 --> 01:31:59,760
black marks separated by let's say
 

4761
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:01,830
black marks separated by let's say
distances

4762
01:32:01,830 --> 01:32:01,840
distances
 

4763
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:03,430
distances
called a millimeter

4764
01:32:03,430 --> 01:32:03,440
called a millimeter
 

4765
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:05,590
called a millimeter
okay now i make a mark on this piece of

4766
01:32:05,590 --> 01:32:05,600
okay now i make a mark on this piece of
 

4767
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:08,950
okay now i make a mark on this piece of
paper here so i made a nice black mark

4768
01:32:08,950 --> 01:32:08,960
paper here so i made a nice black mark
 

4769
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:09,990
paper here so i made a nice black mark
right

4770
01:32:09,990 --> 01:32:10,000
right
 

4771
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,430
right
nice black mark

4772
01:32:11,430 --> 01:32:11,440
nice black mark
 

4773
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:13,189
nice black mark
and i ask you i want you to measure that

4774
01:32:13,189 --> 01:32:13,199
and i ask you i want you to measure that
 

4775
01:32:13,199 --> 01:32:15,669
and i ask you i want you to measure that
and tell me how long it is

4776
01:32:15,669 --> 01:32:15,679
and tell me how long it is
 

4777
01:32:15,679 --> 01:32:17,750
and tell me how long it is
you're going to take the ruler

4778
01:32:17,750 --> 01:32:17,760
you're going to take the ruler
 

4779
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:20,310
you're going to take the ruler
you're going to put it next to it

4780
01:32:20,310 --> 01:32:20,320
you're going to put it next to it
 

4781
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:22,229
you're going to put it next to it
and you're going to look

4782
01:32:22,229 --> 01:32:22,239
and you're going to look
 

4783
01:32:22,239 --> 01:32:24,950
and you're going to look
and it's not going to sit even if you

4784
01:32:24,950 --> 01:32:24,960
and it's not going to sit even if you
 

4785
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:27,270
and it's not going to sit even if you
put one end as close as you can on one

4786
01:32:27,270 --> 01:32:27,280
put one end as close as you can on one
 

4787
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:29,510
put one end as close as you can on one
black mark the other end probably isn't

4788
01:32:29,510 --> 01:32:29,520
black mark the other end probably isn't
 

4789
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:31,830
black mark the other end probably isn't
going to be exactly on a black mark well

4790
01:32:31,830 --> 01:32:31,840
going to be exactly on a black mark well
 

4791
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:33,990
going to be exactly on a black mark well
you'll say it's closer to this or that

4792
01:32:33,990 --> 01:32:34,000
you'll say it's closer to this or that
 

4793
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,310
you'll say it's closer to this or that
you write down a number and i say okay

4794
01:32:36,310 --> 01:32:36,320
you write down a number and i say okay
 

4795
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:38,070
you write down a number and i say okay
take the ruler away a minute i take this

4796
01:32:38,070 --> 01:32:38,080
take the ruler away a minute i take this
 

4797
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:40,550
take the ruler away a minute i take this
away come back in five minutes put the

4798
01:32:40,550 --> 01:32:40,560
away come back in five minutes put the
 

4799
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:42,629
away come back in five minutes put the
piece of paper down do it again

4800
01:32:42,629 --> 01:32:42,639
piece of paper down do it again
 

4801
01:32:42,639 --> 01:32:43,910
piece of paper down do it again
you're going to probably come up with a

4802
01:32:43,910 --> 01:32:43,920
you're going to probably come up with a
 

4803
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:45,590
you're going to probably come up with a
different number

4804
01:32:45,590 --> 01:32:45,600
different number
 

4805
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:46,870
different number
and you're going to do that a lot of

4806
01:32:46,870 --> 01:32:46,880
and you're going to do that a lot of
 

4807
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:47,910
and you're going to do that a lot of
times

4808
01:32:47,910 --> 01:32:47,920
times
 

4809
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:49,350
times
and then if i tell you i want you to

4810
01:32:49,350 --> 01:32:49,360
and then if i tell you i want you to
 

4811
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:51,910
and then if i tell you i want you to
give me your best estimate of what the

4812
01:32:51,910 --> 01:32:51,920
give me your best estimate of what the
 

4813
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:54,149
give me your best estimate of what the
actual length of that thing is what are

4814
01:32:54,149 --> 01:32:54,159
actual length of that thing is what are
 

4815
01:32:54,159 --> 01:32:55,510
actual length of that thing is what are
you going to do

4816
01:32:55,510 --> 01:32:55,520
you going to do
 

4817
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:56,870
you going to do
you're going to

4818
01:32:56,870 --> 01:32:56,880
you're going to
 

4819
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:59,830
you're going to
average all of these numbers

4820
01:32:59,830 --> 01:32:59,840
average all of these numbers
 

4821
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:04,550
average all of these numbers
why

4822
01:33:04,550 --> 01:33:04,560

there's lots of ways of going around it

4830
01:33:10,870 --> 01:33:10,880
there's lots of ways of going around it
 

4831
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:14,070
there's lots of ways of going around it
but the average is the best estimate on

4832
01:33:14,070 --> 01:33:14,080
but the average is the best estimate on
 

4833
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:15,910
but the average is the best estimate on
the basis of what's called the central

01:33:19,189 --> 01:33:19,199
a statistical thing we were talking
 

4839
01:33:19,199 --> 01:33:20,470
a statistical thing we were talking
about things

4840
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:20,480
about things
 

4841
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:22,669
about things
that were not really developed until the

01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:33,430
really i'll tell you what people did
including newton although newton is

01:34:41,109 --> 01:34:41,119
when somebody went back to this you do
 

4913
01:34:41,119 --> 01:34:42,790
when somebody went back to this you do
what you just i told you to do with the

what you just i told you to do with the
 

4915
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:44,629
what you just i told you to do with the
ruler you make a lot of measurements and

we have huygens notes he did make a lot

me put them together none of them is

really
 

4961
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:38,149
really
they would have said the right number

they would have said the right number
 

4963
01:35:38,159 --> 01:35:40,870
they would have said the right number
but i'll put them together and give you

4964
01:35:40,870 --> 01:35:40,880
but i'll put them together and give you
 

4965
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:42,709
but i'll put them together and give you
a good number no you would have been

a good number no you would have been

which basically runs into the notion of

01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:57,830
which basically runs into the notion of

which is not so stupid after all

01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:11,830
which is not so stupid after all
i mean we do it except we happen to do

01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:24,470
um i uh
well right but um so that's the way

5146
01:39:24,470 --> 01:39:24,480
well right but um so that's the way
 

5147
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:26,149
well right but um so that's the way
they're thinking about these things

5148
01:39:26,149 --> 01:39:26,159
they're thinking about these things
 

5149
01:39:26,159 --> 01:39:28,550
they're thinking about these things
there's a kind of mix and newton engages

5150
01:39:28,550 --> 01:39:28,560
there's a kind of mix and newton engages
 

5151
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:30,149
there's a kind of mix and newton engages
extensively

5152
01:39:30,149 --> 01:39:30,159
extensively
 

5153
01:39:30,159 --> 01:39:33,590
extensively
in those sorts of manipulations in fact

5154
01:39:33,590 --> 01:39:33,600
in those sorts of manipulations in fact
 

5155
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:38,310
in those sorts of manipulations in fact
more in that than almost anything else

5156
01:39:38,310 --> 01:39:38,320
more in that than almost anything else
 

5157
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:40,629
more in that than almost anything else
except for his optical investigations if

5158
01:39:40,629 --> 01:39:40,639
except for his optical investigations if
 

5159
01:39:40,639 --> 01:39:43,070
except for his optical investigations if
you look through the latter parts of the

5160
01:39:43,070 --> 01:39:43,080
you look through the latter parts of the
 

5161
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:46,470
you look through the latter parts of the
1670s the last five six seven years or

5162
01:39:46,470 --> 01:39:46,480
1670s the last five six seven years or
 

5163
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:49,189
1670s the last five six seven years or
so of that there's more on that than

5164
01:39:49,189 --> 01:39:49,199
so of that there's more on that than
 

5165
01:39:49,199 --> 01:39:51,350
so of that there's more on that than
there is on anything else he's not

5166
01:39:51,350 --> 01:39:51,360
there is on anything else he's not
 

5167
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:54,229
there is on anything else he's not
working on mechanics he's pretty much

5168
01:39:54,229 --> 01:39:54,239

5169
01:39:54,239 --> 01:39:56,390
working on mechanics he's pretty much
gone pretty far in optics he'll turn

5170
01:39:56,390 --> 01:39:56,400
gone pretty far in optics he'll turn
 

5171
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:58,390
gone pretty far in optics he'll turn
back to optics later on

5172
01:39:58,390 --> 01:39:58,400
back to optics later on
 

5173
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:00,390
back to optics later on
so optics and alchemy

5174
01:40:00,390 --> 01:40:00,400
so optics and alchemy
 

5175
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:02,470
so optics and alchemy
so what you're saying is isaac newton

5176
01:40:02,470 --> 01:40:02,480
so what you're saying is isaac newton
 

5177
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:05,430

gravity what do you think that
 

5377
01:43:58,719 --> 01:44:01,109

discussion will go

5378

like
 

5381
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:05,189
like
uh put that way i think newton would sit

01:44:05,189 --> 01:44:05,199
uh put that way i think newton would sit
 

5383
01:44:05,199 --> 01:44:06,790
uh put that way i think newton would sit
there and shock and say i have no idea

there's a time machine you go back and
 

5391
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:15,030
there's a time machine you go back and
bring a somewhat younger newton

so on do that
 

5439
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,590
so on do that
for a couple of months

einstein is young man then we take him
 

5451
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:18,950
einstein is young man then we take him
into some of the laboratories

5452
01:45:18,950 --> 01:45:18,960
into some of the laboratories
 

5453
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:21,189
into some of the laboratories
we show him some of the equipment the

5454
01:45:21,189 --> 01:45:21,199
we show him some of the equipment the
 

5455
01:45:21,199 --> 01:45:24,390
we show him some of the equipment the
devices not the most elaborate ones we

5456
01:45:24,390 --> 01:45:24,400
devices not the most elaborate ones we
 

5457
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:26,870
devices not the most elaborate ones we
show him certain things we educate him

5458

bit by bit well the optics maybe focus

5460
01:45:29,430 --> 01:45:29,440
bit by bit well the optics maybe focus
 

5461
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:31,590
bit by bit well the optics maybe focus
on that certainly

5462
01:45:31,590 --> 01:45:31,600
on that certainly
 

5463
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:33,910
on that certainly
you begin to show him things he's a

5464
01:45:33,910 --> 01:45:33,920
you begin to show him things he's a
 

5465
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:36,149
you begin to show him things he's a
brilliant human being

01:45:38,310 --> 01:45:38,320
i think bit by bit

5471
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:44,070
he would begin to see what's going on
but if you just dumped him in front of

5551
01:47:11,280 --> 01:47:14,470
um i mean the railroad the steam engine
the watt engine etc i mean that was

the watt engine etc i mean that was
 

5553
01:47:14,480 --> 01:47:16,390
the watt engine etc i mean that was
really the one engine you know was

really the one engine you know was
 

5555
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:18,629
