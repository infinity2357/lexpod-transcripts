um and and so you see this throughout
 

71
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,950
um and and so you see this throughout
history this symbiotic relationship

72
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:22,960
history this symbiotic relationship
 

73
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,270
history this symbiotic relationship
you know um for example between um

74
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:27,280
you know um for example between um
 

75
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,670

the royal families

76
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:29,680
the royal families
 

77

the nobility
 

79
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,270

and the church
 

81
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,069
and the church
so you see that group of people

82
00:01:36,069 --> 00:01:36,079
so you see that group of people
 

83
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,950
so you see that group of people
supporting each other in various ways

84
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:38,960
supporting each other in various ways
 

85
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,510
supporting each other in various ways
and then wrestling around with each

86
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:41,520
and then wrestling around with each
 

87
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,469
and then wrestling around with each
other

88
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:42,479
other
 

89
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,830
other
for the money and power among that group

90
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:45,840
for the money and power among that group
 

91
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,950
for the money and power among that group
so the dynamic that's quite classic is

92
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:48,960
so the dynamic that's quite classic is
 

93
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,550
so the dynamic that's quite classic is
you could look at

94
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:50,560
you could look at
 

95
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,789
you could look at
the parties in power

96
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:52,799
the parties in power
 

97
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,590
the parties in power
back in you know the

98
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:55,600
back in you know the
 

99
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,350
back in you know the
16th 17th centuries you would look at uh

100
00:01:59,350 --> 00:01:59,360
16th 17th centuries you would look at uh
 

101
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,270
16th 17th centuries you would look at uh
royal families nobles and um and

102
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:03,280
royal families nobles and um and
 

103
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,910
royal families nobles and um and
the church if you're in europe and then

104
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:05,920
the church if you're in europe and then
 

105
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,910
the church if you're in europe and then
you would look at

106
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:07,920
you would look at
 

107
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,910
you would look at
agricultural land

108
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:09,920
agricultural land
 

109
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,150
agricultural land
and there was a certain dynamic

110
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:12,160
and there was a certain dynamic
 

111
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,550
and there was a certain dynamic
and that varies over time it changes

112
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:16,560
and that varies over time it changes
 

113
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,030
and that varies over time it changes
as those people get thrown out and

114
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:19,040
as those people get thrown out and
 

115
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,430
as those people get thrown out and
technology changes so when we

116
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:21,440
technology changes so when we
 

117
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,470
technology changes so when we
evolved when the society evolved so that

118
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:24,480
evolved when the society evolved so that
 

119
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,910
evolved when the society evolved so that
it would produce

120
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:25,920
it would produce
 

121
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,910
it would produce
goods and services

122
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:27,920
goods and services
 

123
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,390
goods and services
and you have something like the

124
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:30,400
and you have something like the
 

125
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,229
and you have something like the
industrial revolution the first

126
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:32,239
industrial revolution the first
 

127
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,030
industrial revolution the first
industrial revolution you have machines

128
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,040
industrial revolution you have machines
 

129
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,270
industrial revolution you have machines
and you have the talent of people that

130
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:37,280
and you have the talent of people that
 

131
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,990
and you have the talent of people that
are off the farms

132
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:40,000
are off the farms
 

133
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,150
are off the farms
and then you have a struggling for power

134
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:44,160
and then you have a struggling for power
 

135
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,350
and then you have a struggling for power
you see that power mix change

136
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:47,360
you see that power mix change
 

137
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,750
you see that power mix change
and so we don't see that same power mix

138
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:49,760
and so we don't see that same power mix
 

139
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,630
and so we don't see that same power mix
anymore but you still see the same

140
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:52,640
anymore but you still see the same
 

141
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,550
anymore but you still see the same
dynamic you see those with money

142
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:56,560
dynamic you see those with money
 

143
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,550
dynamic you see those with money
dealing with those who have

144
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:58,560
dealing with those who have
 

145
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,470
dealing with those who have
political power

146
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:00,480
political power
 

147
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,589
political power
around those assets that are considered

148
00:03:03,589 --> 00:03:03,599
around those assets that are considered
 

149
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,830
around those assets that are considered
most valuable to particularly the

150
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:05,840
most valuable to particularly the
 

151
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,270
most valuable to particularly the
productive assets that produce money

152
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:09,280
productive assets that produce money
 

153
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,670
productive assets that produce money
and political power is usually centered

154
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:11,680
and political power is usually centered
 

155
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,910
and political power is usually centered
around nation state

156
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:13,920
around nation state
 

157
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,390
around nation state
so the major locus there's of power is

158
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:16,400
so the major locus there's of power is
 

159
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,830
so the major locus there's of power is
the nations

160
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:17,840
the nations
 

161
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,509

after 30 years of war

00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,120
after 30 years of war
 

167
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,030
after 30 years of war
there was

168
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,040
there was
 

169
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,229
there was
the development of nation states before

the development of nation states before
 

171
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,030
the development of nation states before
then

172
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,040
then
 

173
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,990
then
we had it was really the development of

174
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:34,000
we had it was really the development of
 

175
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,149
we had it was really the development of
countries as we know it that there were

176
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:36,159
countries as we know it that there were
 

177
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,350
countries as we know it that there were
borders

178
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:37,360
borders
 

179
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,869
borders
and that within those borders uh those

180
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:40,879
and that within those borders uh those
 

181
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,630
and that within those borders uh those
who had control got to control it and

182
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:44,640
who had control got to control it and
 

183
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,430
who had control got to control it and
there was not to be intrusions in those

184
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:47,440
there was not to be intrusions in those
 

185
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,830
there was not to be intrusions in those
borders and that's how we established

186
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:49,840
borders and that's how we established
 

187
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,350
borders and that's how we established
the nation state

188
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:51,360
the nation state
 

189
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,990
the nation state
and then of course within each country

190
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,000
and then of course within each country
 

191
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,309
and then of course within each country
there is levels

192
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:56,319
there is levels
 

193
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,670
there is levels
there is a

194
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:57,680
there is a
 

195
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,509
there is a
central level

196
00:03:59,509 --> 00:03:59,519
central level
 

197
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,550
central level
and then there is a typically a province

198
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:02,560
and then there is a typically a province
 

199
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,509
and then there is a typically a province
or state level down below and then

200
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:05,519
or state level down below and then
 

201
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,509
or state level down below and then
there's a municipal level so they each

202
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:07,519
there's a municipal level so they each
 

203
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,869
there's a municipal level so they each
have different levels of power and it's

204
00:04:10,869 --> 00:04:10,879
have different levels of power and it's
 

205
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,470
have different levels of power and it's
the coordination

206
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:12,480
the coordination
 

207
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,390
the coordination
of those that determines how the

208
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:16,400
of those that determines how the
 

209
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,110
of those that determines how the
country is run

210
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,120
country is run
 

211
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,069
country is run
you write that the quote archetypal big

00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:22,079
you write that the quote archetypal big
 

213
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,189
you write that the quote archetypal big

00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:25,680
governs the rising and declining empires
 

217
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,749
governs the rising and declining empires
and influences everything about them

218
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:27,759
and influences everything about them
 

219
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,150
and influences everything about them

including their currencies and markets

including their currencies and markets
the most important three cycles are the

222
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:31,840
the most important three cycles are the
 

223
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,790
the most important three cycles are the
ones

224
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:32,800
ones
 

225
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,030
ones
you mentioned in the introduction the

226
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:35,040
you mentioned in the introduction the
 

227
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,990
you mentioned in the introduction the
long-term debt and capital market cycle

228
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:38,000
long-term debt and capital market cycle
 

229
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,469
long-term debt and capital market cycle
the internal order and disorder cycle

230
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:40,479
the internal order and disorder cycle
 

231
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,590
the internal order and disorder cycle
and the external order and disorder

232
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:43,600
and the external order and disorder
 

233
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,230
and the external order and disorder
cycle can you describe this

234
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:46,240
cycle can you describe this
 

235
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,230
cycle can you describe this
big cycle

236
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:48,240
big cycle
 

237
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,629
big cycle
there are two orders

238
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:50,639
there are two orders
 

239
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,909
there are two orders
there is an order by a sip order i mean

240
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:53,919
there is an order by a sip order i mean
 

241
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,189
there is an order by a sip order i mean
a system

242
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:55,199
a system
 

243
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,150
a system
how the system works

244
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:58,160
how the system works
 

245
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,870
how the system works
so

246
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:58,880
so
 

247
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,590
so
there's an internal order

248
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:01,600
there's an internal order
 

249
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,909
there's an internal order
that is the internal governance system

250
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:03,919
that is the internal governance system
 

251
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,510
that is the internal governance system
and it's usually set out in a

252
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:05,520
and it's usually set out in a
 

253
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,790
and it's usually set out in a
constitution or some agreements

254
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:08,800
constitution or some agreements
 

255
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,950
constitution or some agreements
and then there's the world order

256
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:10,960
and then there's the world order
 

257
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,670
and then there's the world order
uh how the world system so for example

258
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:13,680
uh how the world system so for example
 

259
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,070
uh how the world system so for example
in 1945

260
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,080
in 1945
 

261
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,310
in 1945
um at the end of a war

262
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:18,320
um at the end of a war
 

263
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,390
um at the end of a war
which is basically a fight for

264
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:20,400
which is basically a fight for
 

265
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,629
which is basically a fight for
determining the world order

266
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:22,639
determining the world order
 

267
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,550
determining the world order
um the winners of the fight

268
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:26,560
um the winners of the fight
 

269
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,990
um the winners of the fight
got together and created the world

270
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,000
got together and created the world
 

271
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,430
got together and created the world
system as we now know it 44 they created

272
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:33,440
system as we now know it 44 they created
 

273
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,909
system as we now know it 44 they created
the brenton woods monetary system that

274
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:35,919
the brenton woods monetary system that
 

275
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,469
the brenton woods monetary system that
determined the money pretty much

276
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:38,479
determined the money pretty much
 

277
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,270
determined the money pretty much
and because the united states won

278
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:41,280
and because the united states won
 

279
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,990
and because the united states won
and had 80 percent of the world's money

280
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:44,000
and had 80 percent of the world's money
 

281
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,230
and had 80 percent of the world's money
gold was money then and had 80 of the

282
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:46,240
gold was money then and had 80 of the
 

283
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,070
gold was money then and had 80 of the
world's gold and it was half the world

284
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,080
world's gold and it was half the world
 

285
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,230
world's gold and it was half the world
economy and it was the great military

286
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:50,240
economy and it was the great military
 

287
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,430
economy and it was the great military
power

288
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:51,440
power
 

289
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,390
power
the

290
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:52,400
the
 

291
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,790
the
order was built around an american world

292
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:54,800
order was built around an american world
 

293
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,590
order was built around an american world
order so that the united nations was in

294
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:57,600
order so that the united nations was in
 

295
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,990
order so that the united nations was in
new york the world bank and the imf were

296
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,000
new york the world bank and the imf were
 

297
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,309
new york the world bank and the imf were
in washington and they built that new

298
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:02,319
in washington and they built that new
 

299
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,309
in washington and they built that new
order so classically

300
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:04,319
order so classically
 

301
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,270
order so classically
you have a war to determine whose rules

302
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:07,280
you have a war to determine whose rules
 

303
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,629
you have a war to determine whose rules
we're following and then you have um the

304
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:10,639
we're following and then you have um the
 

305
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,350
we're following and then you have um the
new water beings constructed

306
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:13,360
new water beings constructed
 

307
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,550
new water beings constructed
after that

308
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:14,560
after that
 

309
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,189
after that
there is usually period of extended

310
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:17,199
there is usually period of extended
 

311
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,710
there is usually period of extended
peace and

312
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:18,720
peace and
 

313
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,230
peace and
prosperity

314
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:20,240
prosperity
 

315
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,189
prosperity
uh peace suits prosperity

316
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:23,199
uh peace suits prosperity
 

317
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,990
uh peace suits prosperity
um and so there's not and the reason you

318
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:26,000
um and so there's not and the reason you
 

319
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,230
um and so there's not and the reason you
have the peace is because no one wants

320
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:28,240
have the peace is because no one wants
 

321
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,070
have the peace is because no one wants
to fight with the

322
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:30,080
to fight with the
 

323
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,390
to fight with the
um dominant power you know you're going

324
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:32,400
um dominant power you know you're going
 

325
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,230
um dominant power you know you're going
to lose you've surrendered there's been

326
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:34,240
to lose you've surrendered there's been
 

327
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,390
to lose you've surrendered there's been
the surrendering they carve up the world

328
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:36,400
the surrendering they carve up the world
 

329
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,230
the surrendering they carve up the world
they say what it's going to look like

330
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:38,240
they say what it's going to look like
 

331
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,350
they say what it's going to look like
who's going to control what and then

332
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:41,360
who's going to control what and then
 

333
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,550
who's going to control what and then
you come into that period of of peace

334
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:44,560
you come into that period of of peace
 

335
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,510
you come into that period of of peace
and then

336
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:45,520
and then
 

337
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,350
and then
prosperity where then there's uh

338
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:49,360
prosperity where then there's uh
 

339
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,029
prosperity where then there's uh
a working together usually at that point

340
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:53,039
a working together usually at that point
 

341
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,309
a working together usually at that point
you've wiped out a lot of the

342
00:06:56,309 --> 00:06:56,319
you've wiped out a lot of the
 

343
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,990
you've wiped out a lot of the
debt you've wiped out a lot of the

344
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
debt you've wiped out a lot of the
 

345
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,790
debt you've wiped out a lot of the
issues the class warfare and so on

346
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:02,800
issues the class warfare and so on
 

347
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,710
issues the class warfare and so on
and then there's good working together

348
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:04,720
and then there's good working together
 

349
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,950
and then there's good working together
so those great periods

350
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:06,960
so those great periods
 

351
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,629
so those great periods
um such as the industrial revolution in

352
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:10,639
um such as the industrial revolution in
 

353
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,430
um such as the industrial revolution in
the late 1800s

354
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:13,440
the late 1800s
 

355
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,350
the late 1800s
or what we've experienced in the

356
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:15,360
or what we've experienced in the
 

357
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,830
or what we've experienced in the
post-world war ii period are peaceful

358
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:17,840
post-world war ii period are peaceful
 

359
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,150
post-world war ii period are peaceful
and prosperous periods

360
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:20,160
and prosperous periods
 

361
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,430
and prosperous periods
led largely by the dominant world power

362
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:23,440
led largely by the dominant world power
 

363
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,830
led largely by the dominant world power
over a period of time

364
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:25,840
over a period of time
 

365
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,990
over a period of time
since really 1500

366
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,000
since really 1500
 

367
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,670
since really 1500
and maybe before but really 1500

368
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:31,680
and maybe before but really 1500
 

369
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,790
and maybe before but really 1500
when the

370
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:32,800
when the
 

371
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,749
when the
dutch

372
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:33,759
dutch
 

373
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,550
dutch
invented capitalism and what i mean by

374
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:36,560
invented capitalism and what i mean by
 

375
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,469
invented capitalism and what i mean by
that they invest invented the first

376
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:38,479
that they invest invented the first
 

377
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,110
that they invest invented the first
capital markets the first stocks and the

378
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:41,120
capital markets the first stocks and the
 

379
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,870
capital markets the first stocks and the
first stock market

380
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:42,880
first stock market
 

381
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,309
first stock market
um that since then capitalism has been

382
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:46,319
um that since then capitalism has been
 

383
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,629
um that since then capitalism has been
an effective tool for building wealth

384
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:48,639
an effective tool for building wealth
 

385
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,510
an effective tool for building wealth
because it got resources into the hands

386
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:51,520
because it got resources into the hands
 

387
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,830
because it got resources into the hands
of inventive people

388
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:53,840
of inventive people
 

389
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,550
of inventive people
that's when we moved from agriculture to

390
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:56,560
that's when we moved from agriculture to
 

391
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,309
that's when we moved from agriculture to
the importance of inventiveness of

392
00:07:58,309 --> 00:07:58,319
the importance of inventiveness of
 

393
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,110
the importance of inventiveness of
people they got resources and then they

394
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:01,120
people they got resources and then they
 

395
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,430
people they got resources and then they
built that prosperity

396
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:03,440
built that prosperity
 

397
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,909
built that prosperity
in that process of doing that

398
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:05,919
in that process of doing that
 

399
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,189
in that process of doing that
they create wealth gaps naturally those

400
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:09,199
they create wealth gaps naturally those
 

401
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,909
they create wealth gaps naturally those
who make a lot of money

402
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:11,919
who make a lot of money
 

403
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,309
who make a lot of money
make a lot more and than those that

404
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:14,319
make a lot more and than those that
 

405
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,909
make a lot more and than those that
don't

406
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:15,919
don't
 

407
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:16,710
don't
and

408
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:16,720
and
 

409
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,150
and
it also produces opportunity gaps

410
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:20,160
it also produces opportunity gaps
 

411
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,990
it also produces opportunity gaps
because uh for example those who earn a

412
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,000
because uh for example those who earn a
 

413
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,390
because uh for example those who earn a
lot of money have that wealth

414
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:26,400
lot of money have that wealth
 

415
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,629
lot of money have that wealth
they have the power to educate their

416
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:28,639
they have the power to educate their
 

417
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,909
they have the power to educate their
children in a way that others don't

418
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:31,919
children in a way that others don't
 

419
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,110
children in a way that others don't
and

420
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:33,120
and
 

421
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,790
and
the gaps grow

422
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:34,800
the gaps grow
 

423
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,469
the gaps grow
and also the debts grow at that time

424
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:38,479
and also the debts grow at that time
 

425
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,990
and also the debts grow at that time
when they go around the world with their

426
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:42,000
when they go around the world with their
 

427
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,829
when they go around the world with their
competitiveness

428
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:43,839
competitiveness
 

429
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:44,710
competitiveness
they

430
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:44,720
they
 

431
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,949
they
earn a lot of money so for example the

432
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:46,959
earn a lot of money so for example the
 

433
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,949
earn a lot of money so for example the
dutch the dutch empire

434
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:48,959
dutch the dutch empire
 

435
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,430
dutch the dutch empire
learned how to build ships

436
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:51,440
learned how to build ships
 

437
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,230
learned how to build ships
um and that would go around the world a

438
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:54,240
um and that would go around the world a
 

439
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,710
um and that would go around the world a
key ingredient of this improvement in

440
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:56,720
key ingredient of this improvement in
 

441
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,910
key ingredient of this improvement in
this cycle

442
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:57,920
this cycle
 

443
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,870
this cycle
is the improvement of education and by

444
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:00,880
is the improvement of education and by
 

445
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,190
is the improvement of education and by
education i mean the skills that come

446
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:03,200
education i mean the skills that come
 

447
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,990
education i mean the skills that come
from education but also civility the

448
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:06,000
from education but also civility the
 

449
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,550
from education but also civility the
ability to deal with well together

450
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:08,560
ability to deal with well together
 

451
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,990
ability to deal with well together
so the dutch

452
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,000
so the dutch
 

453
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,829
so the dutch
invented ships that could go around the

454
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:11,839
invented ships that could go around the
 

455
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,750
invented ships that could go around the
world and they had military power but

456
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:13,760
world and they had military power but
 

457
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,670
world and they had military power but
they were also very inventive society 25

458
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:17,680
they were also very inventive society 25
 

459
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,230
they were also very inventive society 25
of the world's new inventions came from

460
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:20,240
of the world's new inventions came from
 

461
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,350
of the world's new inventions came from
the dutch

462
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:21,360
the dutch
 

463
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,590
the dutch
and so as they went around the world

464
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:23,600
and so as they went around the world
 

465
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,150
and so as they went around the world
they also brought their currency

466
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,160
they also brought their currency
 

467
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,310
they also brought their currency
and they brought their military they

468
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:28,320
and they brought their military they
 

469
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,470
and they brought their military they
needed their the currency they paid for

470
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:30,480
needed their the currency they paid for
 

471
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,110
needed their the currency they paid for
things um and that currency and then the

472
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:33,120
things um and that currency and then the
 

473
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,670
things um and that currency and then the
more that happens the more that becomes

474
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:35,680
more that happens the more that becomes
 

475
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,910
more that happens the more that becomes
a reserve currency

476
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:37,920
a reserve currency
 

477
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,230
a reserve currency
and then they have their military so

478
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:40,240
and then they have their military so
 

479
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,150
and then they have their military so
they need their military strength and so

480
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,160
they need their military strength and so
 

481
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,750
they need their military strength and so
you see it evolve in all of those ways

482
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:45,760
you see it evolve in all of those ways
 

483
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,150
you see it evolve in all of those ways
but over a period of time

484
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,160
but over a period of time
 

485
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,110
but over a period of time
um as they become more successful and

486
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:51,120
um as they become more successful and
 

487
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,630
um as they become more successful and
more expensive

488
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:52,640
more expensive
 

489
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,230
more expensive
um they became they become more

490
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:54,240
um they became they become more
 

491
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,590
um they became they become more
expensive

492
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:55,600
expensive
 

493
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,630
expensive
um

494
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:56,640
um
 

495
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,150
um
and and

496
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:58,160
and and
 

497
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,949
and and
newer countries come along like um the

498
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:00,959
newer countries come along like um the
 

499
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,150
newer countries come along like um the
uk

500
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:02,160
uk
 

501
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,110
uk
um

502
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:03,120
um
 

503
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,310
um
then uh be learned to build ships from a

504
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:06,320
then uh be learned to build ships from a
 

505
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,870
then uh be learned to build ships from a
lot the dutch and could do that less

506
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:08,880
lot the dutch and could do that less
 

507
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,389
lot the dutch and could do that less
expensively

508
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:10,399
expensively
 

509
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,670
expensively
and also when they become more

510
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:13,680
and also when they become more
 

511
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,470
and also when they become more
expensive so less competitive and also

512
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:16,480
expensive so less competitive and also
 

513
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,110
expensive so less competitive and also
the work ethic begins to change they

514
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:19,120
the work ethic begins to change they
 

515
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,790
the work ethic begins to change they
believe that since they're richer they

516
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:20,800
believe that since they're richer they
 

517
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,509
believe that since they're richer they
can enjoy life more they don't have to

518
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:23,519
can enjoy life more they don't have to
 

519
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,110
can enjoy life more they don't have to
work quite as hard

520
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,120
work quite as hard
 

521
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,829
work quite as hard
and so you start to see the tilt

522
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:27,839
and so you start to see the tilt
 

523
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,910
and so you start to see the tilt
now you start to see the development of

524
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:29,920
now you start to see the development of
 

525
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,310
now you start to see the development of
the top and when you have a world

526
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:32,320
the top and when you have a world
 

527
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,230
the top and when you have a world
reserve currency

528
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,240
reserve currency
 

529
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,870
reserve currency
that allows you to borrow a lot of money

530
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:36,880
that allows you to borrow a lot of money
 

531
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,389
that allows you to borrow a lot of money
because those who want to save

532
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:40,399
because those who want to save
 

533
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,550
because those who want to save
want to hold your money and that means

534
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:42,560
want to hold your money and that means
 

535
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,550
want to hold your money and that means
that they'll lend you money and so those

536
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:44,560
that they'll lend you money and so those
 

537
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,949
that they'll lend you money and so those
countries get deeper into debt

538
00:10:46,949 --> 00:10:46,959
countries get deeper into debt
 

539
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,269
countries get deeper into debt
so you see that they gradually lose

540
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:49,279
so you see that they gradually lose
 

541
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,269
so you see that they gradually lose
their competitiveness

542
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:51,279
their competitiveness
 

543
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,389
their competitiveness
and they um and they get themselves into

544
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:54,399
and they um and they get themselves into
 

545
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,190
and they um and they get themselves into
financial circumstances which are not

546
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:57,200
financial circumstances which are not
 

547
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,550
financial circumstances which are not
good

548
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:58,560
good
 

549
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,269
good
and they have large wealth gaps

550
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:01,279
and they have large wealth gaps
 

551
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,630
and they have large wealth gaps
which set the stage for downturns and

552
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:04,640
which set the stage for downturns and
 

553
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,870
which set the stage for downturns and
when they have downturns

554
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:06,880
when they have downturns
 

555
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,030
when they have downturns
um the first question is do they have

556
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,040
um the first question is do they have
 

557
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,910
um the first question is do they have
enough money and traditionally you know

558
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:11,920
enough money and traditionally you know
 

559
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,150
enough money and traditionally you know
uh money is is resources um so you

560
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:16,160
uh money is is resources um so you
 

561
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,949
uh money is is resources um so you
classically see that the coffers are

562
00:11:18,949 --> 00:11:18,959
classically see that the coffers are
 

563
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:19,829
classically see that the coffers are
bare

564
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:19,839
bare
 

565
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,829
bare
that they're spending more money than

566
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:21,839
that they're spending more money than
 

567
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:22,790
that they're spending more money than
their

568
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:22,800
their
 

569
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,150
their
than they are earning and they run out

570
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:26,160
than they are earning and they run out
 

571
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,790
than they are earning and they run out
of money in the coffers

572
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:28,800
of money in the coffers
 

573
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,910
of money in the coffers
and their granaries are empty rather

574
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:31,920
and their granaries are empty rather
 

575
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,230
and their granaries are empty rather
than stocked so that they give them the

576
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:34,240
than stocked so that they give them the
 

577
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,190
than stocked so that they give them the
buffer

578
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:35,200
buffer
 

579
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,230
buffer
and as that deteriorates that's that

580
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:38,240
and as that deteriorates that's that
 

581
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,190
and as that deteriorates that's that
worsens conditions and if they have a

582
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:41,200
worsens conditions and if they have a
 

583
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,310
worsens conditions and if they have a
rival power that's also challenging them

584
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:44,320
rival power that's also challenging them
 

585
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,509
rival power that's also challenging them
they see greater internal conflict over

586
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:47,519
they see greater internal conflict over
 

587
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,710
they see greater internal conflict over
wealth

588
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:48,720
wealth
 

589
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,190
wealth
and then they have the problems

590
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:51,200
and then they have the problems
 

591
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,990
and then they have the problems
internally and the problems externally

592
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,000
internally and the problems externally
 

593
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,509
internally and the problems externally
which usually results in an internal war

594
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:57,519
which usually results in an internal war
 

595
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,790
which usually results in an internal war
or an external war that leads to the

596
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:00,800
or an external war that leads to the
 

597
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,710
or an external war that leads to the
change in the to the new world order

the british
 

605
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,110
the british
what are some of the key examples that

606
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:11,120
what are some of the key examples that
 

607
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,030
what are some of the key examples that
you think about in the book

608
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,040
you think about in the book
 

609
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,030
you think about in the book
of this process that follow the big

empires
um

620
00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:22,959
um
 

621
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,590
um
were the the dutch the british uh the

622
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:25,600
were the the dutch the british uh the

american and the chinese
 

625
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,110
american and the chinese
um but um you could follow the same

626
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:31,120
um but um you could follow the same
 

627
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,069
um but um you could follow the same
pattern

628
00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:32,079
pattern
 

629
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,710
pattern
um in the book i it was very important

630
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:34,720
um in the book i it was very important
 

631
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,150
um in the book i it was very important
for me to not just use words and

632
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:38,160
for me to not just use words and
 

633
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,269
for me to not just use words and
concepts because that's subjective it

634
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:41,279
concepts because that's subjective it
 

635
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,990
concepts because that's subjective it
was very important for me to use

636
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,000
was very important for me to use
 

637
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,710
was very important for me to use
actual measurements so as you see in the

638
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:46,720
actual measurements so as you see in the
 

639
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,430
actual measurements so as you see in the
book you can see every level of this you

640
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:49,440
book you can see every level of this you
 

641
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,910
book you can see every level of this you
can see where is the education level

642
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:51,920
can see where is the education level
 

643
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,790
can see where is the education level
what is the military power each one of

644
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:54,800
what is the military power each one of
 

645
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,190
what is the military power each one of
those and you could see them back going

646
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:57,200
those and you could see them back going
 

647
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,190
those and you could see them back going
over the 500 years

648
00:12:59,190 --> 00:12:59,200
over the 500 years
 

649
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,389
over the 500 years
and so um you can see the arcs and the

650
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:02,399
and so um you can see the arcs and the
 

651
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,230
and so um you can see the arcs and the
composition of those

652
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:04,240
composition of those
 

653
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,670
composition of those
arcs and what you see is really in most

654
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:07,680
arcs and what you see is really in most
 

655
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,910
arcs and what you see is really in most
countries in most dynasties you can see

656
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:09,920
countries in most dynasties you can see
 

657
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,389
countries in most dynasties you can see
that but you also can see through those

658
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:12,399
that but you also can see through those
 

659
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,430
that but you also can see through those
numbers

660
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:13,440
numbers
 

661
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,949
numbers
the health um of those countries today

662
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:16,959
the health um of those countries today
 

663
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,269
the health um of those countries today
um there are there are statistics that

664
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:19,279
um there are there are statistics that
 

665
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,150
um there are there are statistics that
you could that are in the book that show

666
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:22,160
you could that are in the book that show
 

667
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,269
you could that are in the book that show
what is the level of education what is

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,910
the letter level of economic output what
is the level of

672
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:29,920
is the level of
 

673
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,790
is the level of
um military strength what is the level

674
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:32,800
um military strength what is the level
 

675
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,710
um military strength what is the level
of a number of different measures of

676
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:34,720
of a number of different measures of
 

677
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,110
of a number of different measures of
strength so that you can then compare

678
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:37,120
strength so that you can then compare
 

679
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,269
strength so that you can then compare
that and i think that because there are

680
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:39,279
that and i think that because there are
 

681
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,509
that and i think that because there are
objective measures of strength that you

682
00:13:41,509 --> 00:13:41,519
objective measures of strength that you
 

683
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,310
objective measures of strength that you
could see change

684
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:44,320
could see change
 

685
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,110
could see change
that shows the picture of where we are

686
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:47,120
that shows the picture of where we are
 

687
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,269
that shows the picture of where we are
today and i think one of the most

688
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:49,279
today and i think one of the most
 

689
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,509
today and i think one of the most
important things about the book

690
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:51,519
important things about the book
 

691
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,470
important things about the book
is that it allows people to monitor how

692
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:54,480
is that it allows people to monitor how
 

693
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,189
is that it allows people to monitor how
those things are transpiring i think for

694
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:57,199
those things are transpiring i think for
 

695
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:58,949
those things are transpiring i think for
policy makers

696
00:13:58,949 --> 00:13:58,959
policy makers
 

697
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,670
policy makers
um you know are your policy policymakers

698
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:01,680
um you know are your policy policymakers
 

699
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,110
um you know are your policy policymakers
doing a good job and there's so much

700
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:04,120
doing a good job and there's so much
 

701
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,870
doing a good job and there's so much
subjectivity in that but i think it's

702
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:06,880
subjectivity in that but i think it's
 

703
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,910
subjectivity in that but i think it's
very simple if those lines on the chart

704
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:09,920
very simple if those lines on the chart
 

705
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,069
very simple if those lines on the chart
are improving if your health index is

706
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:12,079
are improving if your health index is
 

707
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,350
are improving if your health index is
improving

708
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:13,360
improving
 

709
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,509
improving
then you're moving toward a better life

710
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:17,519
then you're moving toward a better life
 

711
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,069
then you're moving toward a better life
so that's what the book works like also

712
00:14:20,069 --> 00:14:20,079
so that's what the book works like also
 

713
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,870
so that's what the book works like also
it was used to create a model for the

714
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:22,880
it was used to create a model for the
 

715
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,990
it was used to create a model for the
future

716
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:24,000
future
 

717
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,470
future
in other words there are cause effect

718
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:26,480
in other words there are cause effect
 

719
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,069
in other words there are cause effect
relationships

720
00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:28,079
relationships
 

721
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,949
relationships
everything that happens has reasons

722
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:30,959
everything that happens has reasons
 

723
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,829
everything that happens has reasons
causes that preceded it that made it

724
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:33,839
causes that preceded it that made it
 

725
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:34,710
causes that preceded it that made it
happen

726
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:34,720
happen
 

727
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,910
happen
and so by having all those in numbers

728
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:37,920
and so by having all those in numbers
 

729
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,030
and so by having all those in numbers
one can see the probabilities of certain

730
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,040
one can see the probabilities of certain
 

731
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,790
one can see the probabilities of certain
things happening so um that's what

732
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:44,800
things happening so um that's what
 

733
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,790
things happening so um that's what
that's what you see in in the book it's

734
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:46,800
that's what you see in in the book it's
 

735
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,829
that's what you see in in the book it's
not just

736
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:47,839
not just
 

737
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,069
not just
you know rey's interpretation i didn't

738
00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:50,079
you know rey's interpretation i didn't
 

739
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:51,750
you know rey's interpretation i didn't
want to make it raise interpretation

740
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:51,760
want to make it raise interpretation
 

741
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,990
want to make it raise interpretation
because i don't know if i'm right yeah

742
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:54,000
because i don't know if i'm right yeah
 

743
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,750
because i don't know if i'm right yeah
so one of the fascinating things in the

744
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:55,760
so one of the fascinating things in the
 

745
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,629
so one of the fascinating things in the
book so you have list these 18 measures

746
00:14:58,629 --> 00:14:58,639
book so you have list these 18 measures
 

747
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,269
book so you have list these 18 measures
and there's like a little scorecard

748
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:01,279
and there's like a little scorecard
 

749
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,949
and there's like a little scorecard
for the

750
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:02,959
for the
 

751
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,710
for the
countries of the world today so let's

752
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:04,720
countries of the world today so let's
 

753
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,670
countries of the world today so let's
say u.s china and europe

754
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:07,680
say u.s china and europe
 

755
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,150
say u.s china and europe
and what it was 20 years ago and looking

756
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:10,160
and what it was 20 years ago and looking
 

757
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,829
and what it was 20 years ago and looking
at the change from 20 years ago and

758
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:11,839
at the change from 20 years ago and
 

759
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,910
at the change from 20 years ago and
that's another indicator to change

760
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:13,920
that's another indicator to change
 

761
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,430
that's another indicator to change
itself to see

762
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:15,440
itself to see
 

763
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,110
itself to see
where things are headed

764
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:17,120
where things are headed
 

765
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,430
where things are headed
maybe can you comment on

766
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:19,440
maybe can you comment on
 

767
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,550
maybe can you comment on
from a score perspective how is u.s and

768
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:22,560
from a score perspective how is u.s and
 

769
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,990
from a score perspective how is u.s and
china doing

770
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:24,000
china doing
 

771
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,150
china doing
and in the 18 measures what are some

772
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,160
and in the 18 measures what are some
 

773
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,069
and in the 18 measures what are some
measures that stand out to you is

774
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:28,079
measures that stand out to you is
 

775
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,550
measures that stand out to you is
particularly important to think about

776
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:30,560
particularly important to think about
 

777
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,269
particularly important to think about
today for the united states for china

778
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:33,279
today for the united states for china
 

779
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,670
today for the united states for china
well there are a number um

780
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:35,680
well there are a number um
 

781
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,110
well there are a number um
financially

782
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:39,120

 

783
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,350

what you see in the united states is

784
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:41,360
what you see in the united states is
 

785
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,110
what you see in the united states is
that um

786
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:43,120
that um
 

787
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,710
that um
we're borrowing a lot more money

788
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:44,720
we're borrowing a lot more money
 

789
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,550
we're borrowing a lot more money
creating a lot of debt

790
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:46,560
creating a lot of debt
 

791
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,230
creating a lot of debt
and we're uh printing a lot of money

792
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:50,240
and we're uh printing a lot of money
 

793
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,110
and we're uh printing a lot of money
and our capacity to do that

794
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:53,120
and our capacity to do that
 

795
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,670
and our capacity to do that
is very much is limited first of all

796
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:55,680
is very much is limited first of all
 

797
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,949
is very much is limited first of all
because um when you when there's a sale

798
00:15:58,949 --> 00:15:58,959
because um when you when there's a sale
 

799
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,749
because um when you when there's a sale
of a bond when the government

800
00:16:01,749 --> 00:16:01,759
of a bond when the government
 

801
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,310
of a bond when the government
borrows more than it borrows money

802
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:04,320
borrows more than it borrows money
 

803
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,670
borrows more than it borrows money
because it spends more than it takes in

804
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:07,680
because it spends more than it takes in
 

805
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,150
because it spends more than it takes in
um you have to sell a bond

806
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:10,160
um you have to sell a bond
 

807
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,189
um you have to sell a bond
and the world right now has a lot of us

808
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:13,199
and the world right now has a lot of us
 

809
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,350
and the world right now has a lot of us
dollar denominated bonds because as the

810
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:15,360
dollar denominated bonds because as the
 

811
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,310
dollar denominated bonds because as the
world's reserve currency they sell sold

812
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:18,320
world's reserve currency they sell sold
 

813
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,030
world's reserve currency they sell sold
on them and they have very

814
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:21,040
on them and they have very
 

815
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,550
on them and they have very
bad returns

816
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:22,560
bad returns
 

817
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,110
bad returns
negative real returns negative real

818
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:25,120
negative real returns negative real
 

819
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,670
negative real returns negative real
returns significantly and so on

820
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:27,680
returns significantly and so on
 

821
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,230
returns significantly and so on
so that um

822
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:30,240
so that um
 

823
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,470
so that um
means that more bonds has to be sold

824
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:32,480
means that more bonds has to be sold
 

825
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,430
means that more bonds has to be sold
than

826
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:33,440
than
 

827
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,509
than
um are

828
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:35,519
um are
 

829
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,550
um are
bought

830
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:36,560
bought
 

831
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,910
bought
and that means that the federal reserve

832
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:39,920
and that means that the federal reserve
 

833
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,470
and that means that the federal reserve
has is faced with the choice of having

834
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:42,480
has is faced with the choice of having
 

835
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,949
has is faced with the choice of having
to raise the interest rate

836
00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:44,959
to raise the interest rate
 

837
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,269
to raise the interest rate
to curtail borrowing

838
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:47,279
to curtail borrowing
 

839
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,110
to curtail borrowing
which slows the economy and hurts the

840
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:49,120
which slows the economy and hurts the
 

841
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,509
which slows the economy and hurts the
markets or by

842
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:51,519
markets or by
 

843
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,269
markets or by
filling that difference

844
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:53,279
filling that difference
 

845
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,350
filling that difference
and producing money the debt

846
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:55,360
and producing money the debt
 

847
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,870
and producing money the debt
monetization

848
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:56,880
monetization
 

849
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,670
monetization
which produces an inflation

850
00:16:59,670 --> 00:16:59,680
which produces an inflation
 

851
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,350
which produces an inflation
in goods services and financial assets

852
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:03,360
in goods services and financial assets
 

853
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,630
in goods services and financial assets
so in that regard that's our the united

854
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:06,640
so in that regard that's our the united
 

855
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,789
so in that regard that's our the united
states's position

856
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:08,799
states's position
 

857
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,829
states's position
in china's case its balance of payments

858
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:11,839
in china's case its balance of payments
 

859
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,470
in china's case its balance of payments
um is a better

860
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:14,480
um is a better
 

861
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,309
um is a better
um china has

862
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:16,319
um china has
 

863
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,390
um china has
displaced the united states

864
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:18,400
displaced the united states
 

865
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,510
displaced the united states
as the world's largest trading country

866
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:21,520
as the world's largest trading country
 

867
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,270
as the world's largest trading country
in other words more exports to other

868
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:23,280
in other words more exports to other
 

869
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,710
in other words more exports to other
countries and as a result it's

870
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:26,720
countries and as a result it's
 

871
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,510
countries and as a result it's
economically competitive

872
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:29,520
economically competitive
 

873
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,270
economically competitive
but it doesn't have the world's reserve

874
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:31,280
but it doesn't have the world's reserve
 

875
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,990
but it doesn't have the world's reserve
currency it's a real blessing so the

876
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:34,000
currency it's a real blessing so the
 

877
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,470
currency it's a real blessing so the
united states it has the world's reserve

878
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:36,480
united states it has the world's reserve
 

879
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,909
united states it has the world's reserve
currency but it is risking it because of

880
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:39,919
currency but it is risking it because of
 

881
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,870
currency but it is risking it because of
this imbalance so if you look at history

882
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:42,880
this imbalance so if you look at history
 

883
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,590
this imbalance so if you look at history
you see that those go slowly but when

884
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:45,600
you see that those go slowly but when
 

885
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,190
you see that those go slowly but when
they go

886
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:47,200
they go
 

887
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,990
they go
eventually they go quickly

888
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:50,000
eventually they go quickly
 

889
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,549
eventually they go quickly
so there's a risk of of

890
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:52,559
so there's a risk of of
 

891
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,710
so there's a risk of of
of that financially

892
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:54,720
of that financially
 

893
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,350
of that financially
then there's the issue of uh internal

894
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:57,360
then there's the issue of uh internal
 

895
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,310
then there's the issue of uh internal
order

896
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:58,320
order
 

897
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,070
order
so i'm just giving you the major ones

898
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,080
so i'm just giving you the major ones
 

899
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,750
so i'm just giving you the major ones
but i'll get into some of the other ones

900
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:01,760
but i'll get into some of the other ones
 

901
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,630
but i'll get into some of the other ones
too

902
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:02,640
too
 

903
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,150
too
right now um there's a lot of internal

904
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:06,160
right now um there's a lot of internal
 

905
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,470
right now um there's a lot of internal
conflict in the united states

906
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:08,480
conflict in the united states
 

907
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,070
conflict in the united states
uh which affects its and um

908
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:12,080
uh which affects its and um
 

909
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,990
uh which affects its and um
how well it works um in china there's

910
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:16,000
how well it works um in china there's
 

911
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,470
how well it works um in china there's
less internal conflict because it's a

912
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:18,480
less internal conflict because it's a
 

913
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,150
less internal conflict because it's a
more autocratic

914
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:20,160
more autocratic
 

915
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,870
more autocratic
state but also they've created

916
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:22,880
state but also they've created
 

917
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,029
state but also they've created
this bifurcation

918
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:25,039
this bifurcation
 

919
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,270
this bifurcation
of what is political

920
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:27,280
of what is political
 

921
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,150
of what is political
and what is um economic in terms of

922
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:30,160
and what is um economic in terms of
 

923
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,549
and what is um economic in terms of
producing that prosperity so if you stay

924
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:32,559
producing that prosperity so if you stay
 

925
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,029
producing that prosperity so if you stay
out of the politics pretty much

926
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:35,039
out of the politics pretty much
 

927
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,150
out of the politics pretty much
um

928
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:36,160
um
 

929
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,390
um
and then you're seeing um

930
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:38,400
and then you're seeing um
 

931
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,470
and then you're seeing um
entrepreneurship you're seeing the

932
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:40,480
entrepreneurship you're seeing the
 

933
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,390
entrepreneurship you're seeing the
finances of new businesses and so on and

934
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:44,400
finances of new businesses and so on and
 

935
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,950
finances of new businesses and so on and
so that internal working

936
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:46,960
so that internal working
 

937
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,909
so that internal working
um you know that's subject to different

938
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:49,919
um you know that's subject to different
 

939
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,669
um you know that's subject to different
people's interpretations whether they

940
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:51,679
people's interpretations whether they
 

941
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,470
people's interpretations whether they
like it or not but the internal conflict

942
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:54,480
like it or not but the internal conflict
 

943
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,950
like it or not but the internal conflict
in terms of those kinds of measures is

944
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:56,960
in terms of those kinds of measures is
 

945
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,350
in terms of those kinds of measures is
is less sorry to pause on that for a

946
00:18:59,350 --> 00:18:59,360
is less sorry to pause on that for a
 

947
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,750
is less sorry to pause on that for a
second so these measures

948
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:01,760
second so these measures
 

949
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,029
second so these measures
i guess you don't want to sort of um

950
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:05,039
i guess you don't want to sort of um
 

951
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,029
i guess you don't want to sort of um
romanticize any one measure or something

952
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:07,039
romanticize any one measure or something
 

953
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,909
romanticize any one measure or something
like that over interpret any one measure

954
00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:09,919
like that over interpret any one measure
 

955
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,630
like that over interpret any one measure
but is internal conflict

956
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:12,640
but is internal conflict
 

957
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,990
but is internal conflict
always a bad thing is some is this uh

958
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:16,000
always a bad thing is some is this uh
 

959
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,390
always a bad thing is some is this uh
is it a complicated calculation or do

960
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:18,400
is it a complicated calculation or do
 

961
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,070
is it a complicated calculation or do
you kind of the way we think about these

962
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:20,080
you kind of the way we think about these
 

963
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,510
you kind of the way we think about these
measures that you've presented we should

964
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:21,520
measures that you've presented we should
 

965
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,029
measures that you've presented we should
be thinking like

966
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:23,039
be thinking like
 

967
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,310
be thinking like
the higher the better the lower worse or

968
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:26,320
the higher the better the lower worse or
 

969
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,310
the higher the better the lower worse or
i mean of course depending on well

970
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:28,320
i mean of course depending on well
 

971
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,150
i mean of course depending on well
in many cases

972
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:30,160
in many cases
 

973
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,230
in many cases
the conflict that produces the

974
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:32,240
the conflict that produces the
 

975
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,750
the conflict that produces the
revolution

976
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:33,760
revolution
 

977
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,950
revolution
produces revolutionary changes

978
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:36,960
produces revolutionary changes
 

979
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,190
produces revolutionary changes
that lead to

980
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:39,200
that lead to
 

981
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,950
that lead to
resolutions

982
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:40,960
resolutions
 

983
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,470
resolutions
that and lead to new starts

984
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:44,480
that and lead to new starts
 

985
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,750
that and lead to new starts
and so

986
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:45,760
and so
 

987
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,990
and so
their short term

988
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:48,000
their short term
 

989
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,310
their short term
a short-term civil war

990
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:50,320
a short-term civil war
 

991
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,789
a short-term civil war
is a hellacious experience

992
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:52,799
is a hellacious experience
 

993
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,870
is a hellacious experience
and at the same time it can be um the

994
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:56,880
and at the same time it can be um the
 

995
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,270
and at the same time it can be um the
transition to a new beginning

996
00:19:59,270 --> 00:19:59,280
transition to a new beginning
 

997
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,310
transition to a new beginning
um

998
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:00,320
um
 

999
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,909
um
also there are different types of

1000
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:01,919
also there are different types of
 

1001
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,029
also there are different types of
conflict

1002

conflict
 

1011
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,990
conflict
whereas destructive conflicts

1012
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:16,000
whereas destructive conflicts
 

1013
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,830
whereas destructive conflicts
are

1014
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:17,840
are
 

1015
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,870
are
not good over the short time

1016
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:20,880
not good over the short time
 

1017
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,909
not good over the short time
so you know that's how that those go so

1018
00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:23,919
so you know that's how that those go so
 

1019
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,510
so you know that's how that those go so
within each measure the story

1020
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:27,520
within each measure the story
 

1021
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,029
within each measure the story
is complicated

1022
00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:29,039
is complicated
 

1023
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,590
is complicated
yeah but my measures are are sort of

1024
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:31,600
yeah but my measures are are sort of
 

1025
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,350
yeah but my measures are are sort of
clear meaning

1026
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:33,360
clear meaning
 

1027
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,789
clear meaning
how much political conflict how much

1028
00:20:36,789 --> 00:20:36,799
how much political conflict how much
 

1029
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,630
how much political conflict how much
social conflict

1030
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:38,640
social conflict
 

1031
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,470
social conflict
in other words you can measure conflict

1032
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:40,480
in other words you can measure conflict
 

1033
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,270
in other words you can measure conflict
you can measure fighting you can measure

1034
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:43,280
you can measure fighting you can measure
 

1035
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,750
you can measure fighting you can measure
crime rates you can measure

1036
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:45,760
crime rates you can measure
 

1037
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,190
crime rates you can measure
um

1038
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:47,200
um
 

1039
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,669
um
lots of different ways of conflict so

1040
00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:49,679
lots of different ways of conflict so
 

1041
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,470
lots of different ways of conflict so
the measures are a composite of

1042
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:52,480
the measures are a composite of
 

1043
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,590
the measures are a composite of
different types of internal conflict

1044
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:55,600
different types of internal conflict
 

1045
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,830
different types of internal conflict
what are some other interesting measures

1046
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:57,840
what are some other interesting measures
 

1047
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,909
what are some other interesting measures
maybe if you can also mention like for

1048
00:20:59,909 --> 00:20:59,919
maybe if you can also mention like for
 

1049
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,909
maybe if you can also mention like for
me in particular interest is education

1050
00:21:01,909 --> 00:21:01,919
me in particular interest is education
 

1051
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,310
me in particular interest is education
and innovation yes

1052
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:04,320
and innovation yes
 

1053
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,870
and innovation yes
the classic cycle the most important

1054
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:06,880
the classic cycle the most important
 

1055
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,630
the classic cycle the most important
leading indicator

1056
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:08,640
leading indicator
 

1057
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,110
leading indicator
is the quality of education

1058
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:11,120
is the quality of education
 

1059
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,270
is the quality of education
most importantly

1060
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:13,280
most importantly
 

1061
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,830
most importantly
broad-based

1062
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:14,840
broad-based
 

1063
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,110
broad-based
education drawn as a

1064
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:17,120
education drawn as a
 

1065
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,830
education drawn as a
from the largest population because you

1066
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:19,840
from the largest population because you
 

1067
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,390
from the largest population because you
can never tell who the talent is going

1068
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:22,400
can never tell who the talent is going
 

1069
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,310
can never tell who the talent is going
to be so where they're going to come

1070
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:24,320
to be so where they're going to come
 

1071
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,470
to be so where they're going to come
from so for example if you look at the

1072
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:26,480
from so for example if you look at the
 

1073
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,950
from so for example if you look at the
chinese dynasties the great chinese

1074
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:28,960
chinese dynasties the great chinese
 

1075
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,110
chinese dynasties the great chinese
dynasties um and the confucian approach

1076
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:33,120
dynasties um and the confucian approach
 

1077
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,390
dynasties um and the confucian approach
it was meritocratic of um

1078
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:36,400
it was meritocratic of um
 

1079
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,870
it was meritocratic of um
everybody could sit for exams and so on

1080
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:38,880
everybody could sit for exams and so on
 

1081
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,430
everybody could sit for exams and so on
broad base of drawing in the populations

1082
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:41,440
broad base of drawing in the populations
 

1083
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,110
broad base of drawing in the populations
and you see that if you go across

1084
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:43,120
and you see that if you go across
 

1085
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,029
and you see that if you go across
societies

1086
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:45,039
societies
 

1087
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,430
societies
because that draws on the largest number

1088
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:47,440
because that draws on the largest number
 

1089
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,789
because that draws on the largest number
of population to get education

1090
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:50,799
of population to get education
 

1091
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:55,190
of population to get education
and it also um that creates um

1092
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:55,200
and it also um that creates um
 

1093
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,190
and it also um that creates um
a reality and a

1094
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:57,200
a reality and a
 

1095
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,909
a reality and a
perception that the system is fairer

1096
00:21:59,909 --> 00:21:59,919
perception that the system is fairer
 

1097
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,230
perception that the system is fairer
equal opportunity not just one of

1098
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:02,240
equal opportunity not just one of
 

1099
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,549
equal opportunity not just one of
privilege and that helps to create

1100
00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:04,559
privilege and that helps to create
 

1101
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,149
privilege and that helps to create
social stability

1102
00:22:06,149 --> 00:22:06,159
social stability
 

1103
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,909
social stability
but education

1104
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:07,919
but education
 

1105
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,149
but education
is not just uh education in

1106
00:22:12,149 --> 00:22:12,159
is not just uh education in
 

1107
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,470
is not just uh education in
understanding facts and so on it is

1108
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:14,480
understanding facts and so on it is
 

1109
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,669
understanding facts and so on it is
education

1110
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:15,679
education
 

1111
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:16,950
education
and um

1112
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:16,960
and um
 

1113
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,350
and um
civility of how to behave together and

1114
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:19,360
civility of how to behave together and
 

1115
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,110
civility of how to behave together and
so if they're smart

1116
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:21,120
so if they're smart
 

1117
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,830
so if they're smart
they understand how to be productive

1118
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:23,840
they understand how to be productive
 

1119
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,750
they understand how to be productive
because they work well together and

1120
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:25,760
because they work well together and
 

1121
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,710
because they work well together and
they're productive and then that leads

1122
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:28,720
they're productive and then that leads
 

1123
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,270
they're productive and then that leads
to the next stage you could see in the

1124
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:31,280
to the next stage you could see in the
 

1125
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,029
to the next stage you could see in the
lines in the charts we i plotted these

1126
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:35,039
lines in the charts we i plotted these
 

1127
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,510
lines in the charts we i plotted these
so that you could see in a typical cycle

1128
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:37,520
so that you could see in a typical cycle
 

1129
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,909
so that you could see in a typical cycle
you could see that education is the long

1130
00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:39,919
you could see that education is the long
 

1131
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,350
you could see that education is the long
leading

1132
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:41,360
leading
 

1133
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,990
leading
indicator and then you could see as you

1134
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:44,000
indicator and then you could see as you
 

1135
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,270
indicator and then you could see as you
mentioned

1136
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:45,280
mentioned
 

1137
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,590
mentioned
that you what you see is inventiveness

1138
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:47,600
that you what you see is inventiveness
 

1139
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,110
that you what you see is inventiveness
and technology measures then follow and

1140
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:51,120
and technology measures then follow and
 

1141
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,070
and technology measures then follow and
you see

1142
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:52,080
you see
 

1143
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,470
you see
then also competitiveness in world

1144
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:54,480
then also competitiveness in world
 

1145
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,270
then also competitiveness in world
markets follows for example in the early

1146
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:57,280
markets follows for example in the early
 

1147
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,230
markets follows for example in the early
stages of a cycle the industries that

1148
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:00,240
stages of a cycle the industries that
 

1149
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,390
stages of a cycle the industries that
they go into um

1150
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:02,400
they go into um
 

1151
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,630
they go into um
tend to be very basic industry because

1152
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:04,640
tend to be very basic industry because
 

1153
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,870
tend to be very basic industry because
they have cheap labor something like

1154
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:06,880
they have cheap labor something like
 

1155
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,710
they have cheap labor something like
textiles and

1156
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:08,720
textiles and
 

1157
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,350
textiles and
simple manufactured goods and so on but

1158
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:11,360
simple manufactured goods and so on but
 

1159
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,390
simple manufactured goods and so on but
as the education rises then they move up

1160
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:14,400
as the education rises then they move up
 

1161
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,990
as the education rises then they move up
the value chain to uh tech greater

1162
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:18,000
the value chain to uh tech greater
 

1163
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,549
the value chain to uh tech greater
technologies and so on which raises

1164
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:20,559
technologies and so on which raises
 

1165
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,669
technologies and so on which raises
incomes and raises productivity so yes

1166
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:23,679
incomes and raises productivity so yes
 

1167
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,990
incomes and raises productivity so yes
those and and you know as you say there

1168
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:26,000
those and and you know as you say there
 

1169
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,390
those and and you know as you say there
are 18 different measures like that but

1170
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:28,400
are 18 different measures like that but
 

1171
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,230
are 18 different measures like that but
education um

1172
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:30,240
education um
 

1173
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,630
education um
and then civility and the inventiveness

1174
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:32,640
and then civility and the inventiveness
 

1175
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,870
and then civility and the inventiveness
so you see it reflected in

1176
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:34,880
so you see it reflected in
 

1177
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,430
so you see it reflected in
in who's inventing what

1178
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:37,440
in who's inventing what
 

1179
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,990
in who's inventing what
um and that corresponds then who's

1180
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:40,000
um and that corresponds then who's
 

1181
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,669
um and that corresponds then who's
trading with

1182
00:23:41,669 --> 00:23:41,679
trading with
 

1183
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,070
trading with
who's a big trading country and where's

1184
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:44,080
who's a big trading country and where's
 

1185
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,310
who's a big trading country and where's
the value of economic output and what

1186
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:46,320
the value of economic output and what
 

1187
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,789
the value of economic output and what
are per capita incomes they all follow

1188
00:23:48,789 --> 00:23:48,799
are per capita incomes they all follow
 

1189
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,950
are per capita incomes they all follow
those arcs

1190
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:50,960
those arcs
 

1191
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,789
those arcs
yeah like you said the fascinating thing

1192
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:52,799
yeah like you said the fascinating thing
 

1193
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,630
yeah like you said the fascinating thing
about your book so there's philosophy

1194
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:54,640
about your book so there's philosophy
 

1195
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,990
about your book so there's philosophy
there's wisdom

1196
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:56,000
there's wisdom
 

1197
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,549
there's wisdom
uh but there's plots

1198
00:23:58,549 --> 00:23:58,559
uh but there's plots
 

1199
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,789
uh but there's plots
yeah you can see it

1200
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:00,799
yeah you can see it
 

1201
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,789
yeah you can see it
so it's not just your opinion it's kind

you like uh but you're just giving a lot
 

1207
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,909
you like uh but you're just giving a lot
of of your own insights along with the

1208
00:24:09,909 --> 00:24:09,919
of of your own insights along with the
 

1209
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,909
of of your own insights along with the
numbers

1210
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:11,919
numbers
 

1211
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,029
numbers
if you were to look at the american

00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:22,559
given these measures
 

1221
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,190
given these measures
what is the trajectory that leads to the

1222
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:25,200
what is the trajectory that leads to the
 

1223

these measures what are the concerning
 

1227
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,870
these measures what are the concerning
indicators and if um if those break down

00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:32,880
indicators and if um if those break down
 

1229
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,430
indicators and if um if those break down
further what does that look like

1230
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:35,440
further what does that look like
 

1231
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,510
further what does that look like
well all of those indicators

1232
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:39,520
well all of those indicators
 

1233
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,750
well all of those indicators
are concerning

1234
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:41,760
are concerning
 

1235
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,909
are concerning
um maybe

1236
00:24:43,909 --> 00:24:43,919
um maybe
 

1237
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,909
um maybe
except for one which is technology

1238
00:24:47,909 --> 00:24:47,919
except for one which is technology
 

1239

the technology niche
 

1241
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,549
the technology niche
although even in that area the united

1242
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:52,559
although even in that area the united
 

1243
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,029
although even in that area the united
states is

1244
00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:55,039
states is
 

1245
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,710
states is
improving at a slower rate than is china

1246
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:58,720
improving at a slower rate than is china
 

1247
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,110
improving at a slower rate than is china
for various advantages that they have

1248

for various advantages that they have
 

1249
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,190
for various advantages that they have
there they put out about eight times as

1250
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:03,200
there they put out about eight times as
 

1251
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,590
there they put out about eight times as
many computer engineers they have free

1252
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:05,600
many computer engineers they have free
 

1253
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,510
many computer engineers they have free
data and so on but if you look at them

1254
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:09,520
data and so on but if you look at them
 

1255
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,190
data and so on but if you look at them
so the financial is a is a concern

1256
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:13,200
so the financial is a is a concern
 

1257

then if you look at education levels

1260
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:21,279
then if you look at education levels
 

1261
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,430
then if you look at education levels
the united states

the united states
 

1263
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,070
the united states
is in many way is is losing its

1264
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:26,080
is in many way is is losing its
 

1265
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,710
is in many way is is losing its
educational advantage if you were to

1266
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:28,720
educational advantage if you were to
 

1267

the world or something and that was a
 

1283
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,510
the world or something and that was a
big plunge average public education if

1284
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:51,520
big plunge average public education if
 

1285
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,990
big plunge average public education if
you look at the best universities in the

1286
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:54,000
you look at the best universities in the
 

1287
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,630
you look at the best universities in the
world the united states is unique in

the comparison education in china
 

1301
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,590
the comparison education in china
is improving rapidly

1302
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:13,600
is improving rapidly
 

1303
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,390
is improving rapidly
and it and the quantity

1304
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:16,400
and it and the quantity
 

1305
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,350
and it and the quantity
is a quantity of educated people in the

1306
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:19,360
is a quantity of educated people in the
 

1307
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,310
is a quantity of educated people in the
areas that they're moving in are is is

1308
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:22,320
areas that they're moving in are is is
 

1309
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,350
areas that they're moving in are is is
greater

1310
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:23,360
greater
 

1311
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,110
greater
and the resources that they're putting

1312
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:25,120
and the resources that they're putting
 

1313
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,149
and the resources that they're putting
behind it is greater and so you see the

1314
00:26:28,149 --> 00:26:28,159
behind it is greater and so you see the
 

1315
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,750
behind it is greater and so you see the
results are greater

1316
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:29,760
results are greater
 

1317
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,990
results are greater
um but um

1318
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:32,000
um but um
 

1319
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,590
um but um
it's sort of along the lines that i'm

1320
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:33,600
it's sort of along the lines that i'm
 

1321
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,350
it's sort of along the lines that i'm
i'm dealing with if you were to follow

1322
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:35,360
i'm dealing with if you were to follow
 

1323
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,470
i'm dealing with if you were to follow
through

1324
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:36,480
through
 

1325
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,870
through
in terms of um

1326
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:38,880
in terms of um
 

1327
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,669
in terms of um
actual productions i i think uh you you

1328
00:26:41,669 --> 00:26:41,679
actual productions i i think uh you you
 

1329
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,029
actual productions i i think uh you you
know in terms of technologies um there

1331
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,590
know in terms of technologies um there
are some areas that the united states is

1332
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:47,600
are some areas that the united states is
 

1333
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,830
are some areas that the united states is
in a lead at the moment there's some

you know many areas
 

1361
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,350
you know many areas
you have a race going on and so if you

1362
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:21,360
you have a race going on and so if you
 

1363
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,750
you have a race going on and so if you
take the trajectory of the

take the trajectory of the
 

1365
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,669

00:27:25,669 --> 00:27:25,679
competitiveness not just look at the
 

1367
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,149
competitiveness not just look at the
current level you have a situation where

1368
00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:28,159
current level you have a situation where
 

1369
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,110
current level you have a situation where
they're improving at a much faster rate

they're improving at a much faster rate
this is all good for the world if the

00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:33,520
this is all good for the world if the
 

1373
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,470
this is all good for the world if the
world can get along

but you make it sound simple of course

but you make it sound simple of course
because there's a momentum when things

once once they start going down it's uh
 

1419
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,549
once once they start going down it's uh
there's a momentum to it right so it's

there's a momentum to it right so it's

because their constituencies only look

1436
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:47,520
because their constituencies only look
 

1437
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,110
because their constituencies only look
at what they get

00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:49,120
at what they get
 

1439
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,269
at what they get
and when they get a lot they don't pay

1440
00:28:51,269 --> 00:28:51,279
and when they get a lot they don't pay
 

1441
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,269
and when they get a lot they don't pay
attention to the balance sheet and how

1442
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:53,279
attention to the balance sheet and how
 

1443
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,750

much debt is on the books so it's always

1444
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:55,760
much debt is on the books so it's always
 

1445
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,950
much debt is on the books so it's always
better to

00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:56,960
better to
 

1447
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,470
better to
borrow spend

and so you inherit a lot

1454
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:04,640
and so you inherit a lot
 

1455
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,110
and so you inherit a lot
you inherited as

1456
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:07,120
you inherited as
 

1457
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,230
you inherited as
a new president enters in or new

1458
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:10,240
a new president enters in or new
 

1459
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,269
a new president enters in or new
legislators they have a lot of debt

1460
00:29:13,269 --> 00:29:13,279
legislators they have a lot of debt
 

1461
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:16,630
legislators they have a lot of debt
they have a broken down infrastructure

1462
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:16,640
they have a broken down infrastructure
 

1463
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,830
they have a broken down infrastructure
um they don't have enough money to fix

1464
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:19,840
um they don't have enough money to fix
 

1465
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,710
um they don't have enough money to fix
that

1466
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:20,720
that
 

1467
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,070
that
and so that's the lay of the land that

1468
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:24,080
and so that's the lay of the land that
 

1469
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,510
and so that's the lay of the land that
the prior generations put you in

1470
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:27,520
the prior generations put you in
 

1471
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,870
the prior generations put you in
and there you are and so that's right

1472
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:30,880
and there you are and so that's right
 

1473
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,269
and there you are and so that's right
um it's difficult because when you start

1474
00:29:33,269 --> 00:29:33,279
um it's difficult because when you start
 

1475
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:36,310
um it's difficult because when you start
to think okay what's healthy well spend

1476
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:36,320
to think okay what's healthy well spend
 

1477
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,389
to think okay what's healthy well spend
earn more than you spend well that's not

1478
00:29:38,389 --> 00:29:38,399
earn more than you spend well that's not
 

1479
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:39,510
earn more than you spend well that's not
so easy

1480
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:39,520
so easy
 

1481
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,389
so easy
because

1482
00:29:40,389 --> 00:29:40,399
because
 

1483
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,470
because
you know what does that mean go earn

1484
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:42,480
you know what does that mean go earn
 

1485
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,750
you know what does that mean go earn
more i mean okay that's not so easy

1486
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:45,760
more i mean okay that's not so easy
 

1487
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,190
more i mean okay that's not so easy
spend less

1488
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:47,200
spend less
 

1489
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,950
spend less
that isn't going to work

1490
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:48,960
that isn't going to work
 

1491
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,590
that isn't going to work
so now what do you do okay you have this

1492
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:51,600
so now what do you do okay you have this
 

1493
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,549
so now what do you do okay you have this
debt that you then monetize and that's

1494
00:29:54,549 --> 00:29:54,559
debt that you then monetize and that's
 

1495
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,710
debt that you then monetize and that's
why it's classic so yes that's why these

1496
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:56,720
why it's classic so yes that's why these
 

1497
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,350
why it's classic so yes that's why these
cycles occur because what has created

1498
00:29:59,350 --> 00:29:59,360
cycles occur because what has created
 

1499
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,630
cycles occur because what has created
before put

1500
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:00,640
before put
 

1501
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,710
before put
what happened before created the lay of

1502
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:02,720
what happened before created the lay of
 

1503
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,710
what happened before created the lay of
the land that is then increasingly

1504
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:04,720
the land that is then increasingly
 

1505
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,310
the land that is then increasingly
difficult to deal with

1506
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:06,320
difficult to deal with
 

1507
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,070
difficult to deal with
so what can great leaders do in this

1508
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:08,080
so what can great leaders do in this
 

1509
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,470
so what can great leaders do in this
moment i mean maybe um

1510
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:10,480
moment i mean maybe um
 

1511
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,350
moment i mean maybe um
my sense is leadership is crucial here

1512
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:13,360
my sense is leadership is crucial here
 

1513
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,990
my sense is leadership is crucial here
so for example to do very large projects

1514
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:16,000
so for example to do very large projects
 

1515
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,310
so for example to do very large projects
that invest in the education system that

1516
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:18,320
that invest in the education system that
 

1517
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,070
that invest in the education system that
sort of try to

1518
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:20,080
sort of try to
 

1519
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,110
sort of try to
fix the fundamentals or maybe

1520
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:23,120
fix the fundamentals or maybe
 

1521
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,750
fix the fundamentals or maybe
invest more and more into the innovation

1522
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:25,760
invest more and more into the innovation
 

1523
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,110
invest more and more into the innovation
and the develop development of new

1524
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:27,120
and the develop development of new
 

1525
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,430
and the develop development of new
technologies and so on

1526
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:29,440
technologies and so on
 

1527
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,830
technologies and so on
it feels like that just doesn't happen

1528
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:31,840
it feels like that just doesn't happen
 

1529
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,830
it feels like that just doesn't happen
organically

1530
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:33,840
organically
 

1531
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,950
organically
so you have to have strong

1532
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:36,960
so you have to have strong
 

1533
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,269
so you have to have strong
leaders that

1534
00:30:39,269 --> 00:30:39,279
leaders that
 

1535
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,669
leaders that
convince the populace of the importance

1536
00:30:41,669 --> 00:30:41,679
convince the populace of the importance
 

1537
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,510
convince the populace of the importance
of these ideas

1538
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:43,520
of these ideas
 

1539
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,549
of these ideas

what we have is a situation where
 

1543
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,389
what we have is a situation where
everybody

their opinions so the most important
thing

1554
00:31:00,389 --> 00:31:00,399
thing
 

1555
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:03,750
thing
is that we are become bipartisan so that

1556
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:03,760
is that we are become bipartisan so that
 

1557
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,710
is that we are become bipartisan so that
we don't

1558

we don't
 

1559
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,269
we don't
and we get over our differences i would

1560
00:31:07,269 --> 00:31:07,279
and we get over our differences i would
 

1561
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,149
and we get over our differences i would
have a bipartisan cabinet

1562
00:31:10,149 --> 00:31:10,159
have a bipartisan cabinet
 

1563
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,830
have a bipartisan cabinet
i would draw upon

1564
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:11,840
i would draw upon
 

1565
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,950
i would draw upon
um

1566
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:12,960
um
 

1567
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,909
um
both members of both parties the the

1568
00:31:15,909 --> 00:31:15,919
both members of both parties the the
 

1569
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:18,230
both members of both parties the the
moderates who are going to be able to

1570
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:18,240
moderates who are going to be able to
 

1571
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,389
moderates who are going to be able to
work together

1572
00:31:20,389 --> 00:31:20,399
work together
 

1573
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:24,230
work together
so as then we have one country

1574
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:24,240
so as then we have one country
 

1575
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,110
so as then we have one country
and then we deal with those in

1576
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:27,120
and then we deal with those in
 

1577
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,269
and then we deal with those in
a means that works for the majority of

1578
00:31:29,269 --> 00:31:29,279
a means that works for the majority of
 

1579
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,350
a means that works for the majority of
the people in the middle rather than the

1580
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:31,360
the people in the middle rather than the
 

1581
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,389
the people in the middle rather than the
polarity

1582
00:31:32,389 --> 00:31:32,399
polarity
 

1583
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:36,149
polarity
i think our greatest risk is in not

1584
00:31:36,149 --> 00:31:36,159
i think our greatest risk is in not
 

1585
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,789
i think our greatest risk is in not
being able to do that so i would say

1586
00:31:38,789 --> 00:31:38,799
being able to do that so i would say
 

1587
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:39,669
being able to do that so i would say
that's

1588
00:31:39,669 --> 00:31:39,679
that's
 

1589
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,149
that's
a paramount importance

1590
00:31:42,149 --> 00:31:42,159
a paramount importance
 

1591
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,630
a paramount importance
because we have the resources

1592
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:44,640
because we have the resources
 

1593
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,389
because we have the resources
you know um

1594
00:31:46,389 --> 00:31:46,399
you know um
 

1595

everything has never been better than it
 

1599
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,310
everything has never been better than it
is

1600
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:52,320
is
 

1601
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,470
is
but the notion is that it has to work

1602
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:54,480
but the notion is that it has to work
 

1603
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,630
but the notion is that it has to work
for the majority of people

1604

for the majority of people
 

1605
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,750
for the majority of people
and we

1606
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:57,760
and we
 

1607
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,029
and we
have to keep it being productive so that

1608
00:32:01,029 --> 00:32:01,039
have to keep it being productive so that
 

1609
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,909
have to keep it being productive so that
that group has got to calmly and

1610
00:32:03,909 --> 00:32:03,919
that group has got to calmly and
 

1611
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,350
that group has got to calmly and
knowledgeably work together so that they

1612
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:07,360
knowledgeably work together so that they
 

1613
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,070
knowledgeably work together so that they
increase the size of the pie and they

1614
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:10,080
increase the size of the pie and they
 

1615
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,549
increase the size of the pie and they
create broad-based prosperity

1616
00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:12,559
create broad-based prosperity
 

1617
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,509

00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:20,800
within and that is then causing the
 

1969
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,589
within and that is then causing the
adjustments that are going on now which

1970
00:39:23,589 --> 00:39:23,599
adjustments that are going on now which
 

1971
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:27,109
adjustments that are going on now which
in my view are very healthy because um

1972
00:39:27,109 --> 00:39:27,119
in my view are very healthy because um
 

1973
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,109

1983
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,190
bad practices and so um that's what's
going on so that's let's say

1984
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:41,200
going on so that's let's say
 

1985
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:45,510
going on so that's let's say
economically at the same time there is

1986

um what's called core what they call
 

2007
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:14,470
um what's called core what they call
core leadership which means

2008
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:14,480
core leadership which means
 

2009
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,109
core leadership which means
a leadership more around him

00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,230
a leadership more around him
that

2012
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:18,240
that
 

2013
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,670
that
is less

2014
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:19,680
is less
 

2015
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,030
is less
challenging

2016
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:21,040
challenging
 

2017
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,270
challenging
because they believe in history

2018
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:23,280
because they believe in history
 

2019
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,670
because they believe in history
that during very difficult times

2020
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:25,680
that during very difficult times
 

2021
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,309
that during very difficult times
um a more centrally controlled

2022
00:40:28,309 --> 00:40:28,319
um a more centrally controlled
 

2023
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:30,630
um a more centrally controlled
decision-making process lends itself

2024
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:30,640
decision-making process lends itself
 

2025
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,630
decision-making process lends itself
better than to a more fragmented

2026
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:32,640
better than to a more fragmented
 

2027
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,589
better than to a more fragmented
political contentious project and that's

2028
00:40:35,589 --> 00:40:35,599
political contentious project and that's
 

2029
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,270
political contentious project and that's
basically what's

2030
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:37,280
basically what's
 

2031
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,069
basically what's
going on now

2032
00:40:40,069 --> 00:40:40,079
going on now
 

2033
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,069
going on now
you said it very eloquently

2034
00:40:42,069 --> 00:40:42,079
you said it very eloquently
 

2035
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:43,670
you said it very eloquently
but you mean

2036
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:43,680
but you mean
 

2037
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,470
but you mean
the leadership is surrounded by yes men

2038
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:46,480
the leadership is surrounded by yes men
 

2039
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,069
the leadership is surrounded by yes men
and there's a lot of

2040
00:40:48,069 --> 00:40:48,079
and there's a lot of
 

2041
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:49,990
and there's a lot of
centralized control

2042
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:50,000
centralized control
 

2043
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,230
centralized control
that characterization

2044
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:52,240
that characterization
 

2045
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,349
that characterization
is view is much more black and white

2046
00:40:55,349 --> 00:40:55,359
is view is much more black and white
 

2047
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:57,030
is view is much more black and white
than it really is

2048
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:57,040
than it really is
 

2049
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,910
than it really is
uh but it leans towards that direction

2050
00:40:59,910 --> 00:40:59,920
uh but it leans towards that direction
 

2051
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,829
uh but it leans towards that direction
they're like for example of the standing

2052
00:41:01,829 --> 00:41:01,839
they're like for example of the standing
 

2053
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:04,069
they're like for example of the standing
members of the polar bureau four are

2054
00:41:04,069 --> 00:41:04,079
members of the polar bureau four are
 

2055
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:07,109
members of the polar bureau four are
more eligi allied him

2056
00:41:07,109 --> 00:41:07,119
more eligi allied him
 

2057
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,349
more eligi allied him
three or less so

2058
00:41:09,349 --> 00:41:09,359
three or less so
 

2059
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:11,430
three or less so
you have to understand that it's kind of

2060
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:11,440
you have to understand that it's kind of
 

2061
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,550
you have to understand that it's kind of
a collective leadership at the top

2062
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:14,560
a collective leadership at the top
 

2063
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,150
a collective leadership at the top
and then of course there's just

2064
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:16,160
and then of course there's just
 

2065
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,630
and then of course there's just
jockeying for power um you know in a

2066
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:18,640
jockeying for power um you know in a
 

2067
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,550
jockeying for power um you know in a
highly political sense

2068
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:20,560
highly political sense
 

2069
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,470
highly political sense
um at the top uh but no one leader can

2070
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:24,480
um at the top uh but no one leader can
 

2071
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,630
um at the top uh but no one leader can
be successful against the uh all those

2072
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:28,640
be successful against the uh all those
 

2073
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,190
be successful against the uh all those
powers at the top so it's very

2074
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:31,200
powers at the top so it's very
 

2075
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,670
powers at the top so it's very
politically negotiating it's you know

2076
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:33,680
politically negotiating it's you know
 

2077
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,069
politically negotiating it's you know
it's very much more like if you put

2078
00:41:36,069 --> 00:41:36,079
it's very much more like if you put
 

2079
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,150
it's very much more like if you put
um in the united states the democrats

2080
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:38,160
um in the united states the democrats
 

2081
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,069
um in the united states the democrats
and the republicans and they had to be

2082
00:41:40,069 --> 00:41:40,079
and the republicans and they had to be
 

2083
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:41,910
and the republicans and they had to be
in the same government and they work it

2084
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:41,920
in the same government and they work it
 

2085
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,030
in the same government and they work it
out uh it's kind of something like that

2086
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:45,040
out uh it's kind of something like that
 

2087
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,430
out uh it's kind of something like that
and then so that's that struggle but

2088
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:47,440
and then so that's that struggle but
 

2089
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,670
and then so that's that struggle but
it's an internal struggle

2090
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:49,680
it's an internal struggle
 

2091
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,349
it's an internal struggle

then that becomes the objective and then
they move that along so there are these

they move that along so there are these
 

2187
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,829
they move that along so there are these

that is the american approach

that is the american approach

that is the american approach
um he was describing

2236
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:41,920
um he was describing
 

2237
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,950
um he was describing
that in china it's an extension of the

2238
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:44,960
that in china it's an extension of the
 

2239
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,550
that in china it's an extension of the
confucian family essentially and so it's

2240
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:48,560
confucian family essentially and so it's
 

2241
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,190
confucian family essentially and so it's
almost like um um you know there's a

2242
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:51,200
almost like um um you know there's a
 

2243
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:54,309
almost like um um you know there's a
hierarchy and so what they think about

2244
00:44:54,309 --> 00:44:54,319
hierarchy and so what they think about
 

2245
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,550
hierarchy and so what they think about
is the common good

2246
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:56,560
is the common good
 

2247
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,270
is the common good
uh not the individualism

2248
00:44:59,270 --> 00:44:59,280
uh not the individualism
 

2249
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,510
uh not the individualism
so for example if they want a high-speed

2250
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:01,520
so for example if they want a high-speed
 

2251
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,150
so for example if they want a high-speed
rail to go from one place to another and

2252
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:04,160
rail to go from one place to another and
 

2253
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,630
rail to go from one place to another and
that's best in the common good

2254
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:06,640
that's best in the common good
 

2255
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,870
that's best in the common good
then the individual protections that

2256
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:08,880
then the individual protections that
 

2257
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,190
then the individual protections that
would stand in the way of doing that

2258
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:11,200
would stand in the way of doing that
 

2259
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,589
would stand in the way of doing that
would be of secondary concern

2260
00:45:13,589 --> 00:45:13,599
would be of secondary concern
 

2261
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:17,430
would be of secondary concern
so that notion of uh controlling so it

2262
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:17,440
so that notion of uh controlling so it
 

2263
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,270
so that notion of uh controlling so it
it for example

2264
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:19,280
it for example
 

2265
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,670
it for example
um the what what they're doing with uh

2266
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:21,680
um the what what they're doing with uh
 

2267
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,109
um the what what they're doing with uh
video games

2268
00:45:23,109 --> 00:45:23,119
video games
 

2269
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:24,150
video games
um

2270
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:24,160
um
 

2271
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,390
um
they um control

2272
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:26,400
they um control
 

2273
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,109
they um control
uh what type of video games and how

2274
00:45:29,109 --> 00:45:29,119
uh what type of video games and how
 

2275
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:32,069
uh what type of video games and how
many hours a day kids can be on video

2276
00:45:32,069 --> 00:45:32,079
many hours a day kids can be on video
 

2277
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:33,030
many hours a day kids can be on video
games

2278
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:33,040
games
 

2279
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,069
games
um

2280
00:45:34,069 --> 00:45:34,079
um
 

2281
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,550
um
operating in that way because they

2282
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:36,560
operating in that way because they
 

2283
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,790
operating in that way because they
believe that that's good for the society

2284
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:38,800
believe that that's good for the society
 

2285
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,630
believe that that's good for the society
and that's very controlling

2286
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:40,640
and that's very controlling
 

2287
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,030
and that's very controlling
in the united states i i think probably

2288
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:43,040
in the united states i i think probably
 

2289
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,950
in the united states i i think probably
most parents would say leave it to me

2290
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:44,960
most parents would say leave it to me
 

2291
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,430
most parents would say leave it to me
and it's it's a matter between me and my

2292
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:47,440
and it's it's a matter between me and my
 

2293
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,550
and it's it's a matter between me and my
kids the same thing has to do with data

2294
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:50,560
kids the same thing has to do with data
 

2295
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,950
kids the same thing has to do with data
in other words in the united states who

2296
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:52,960
in other words in the united states who
 

2297
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,030
in other words in the united states who
controls the data

2298
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:55,040
controls the data
 

2299
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,670
controls the data
does the company control the data do you

2300
00:45:57,670 --> 00:45:57,680
does the company control the data do you
 

2301
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,790
does the company control the data do you
individually control the data and so the

2302
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:00,800
individually control the data and so the
 

2303
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,430
individually control the data and so the
inclination would be to figure that out

2304
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:03,440
inclination would be to figure that out
 

2305
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,510
inclination would be to figure that out
but nobody would say that the government

2306
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:05,520
but nobody would say that the government
 

2307
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,829
but nobody would say that the government
is going to control the data because of

2308
00:46:07,829 --> 00:46:07,839
is going to control the data because of
 

2309
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:09,710
is going to control the data because of
our inclination of really

anti-government control
 

2313
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,069
anti-government control
in china it would be that the government

in china it would be that the government
 

2315
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:15,829
in china it would be that the government
will control the data

2316

will control the data
 

2317
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,069
will control the data
because that's going to be best for the

2318
00:46:18,069 --> 00:46:18,079
because that's going to be best for the

00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:36,630
control of the situation you know that
was in um germany italy uh japan and

systems that uh turned themselves over
 

2435
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:47,309

to that so both systems um have
 

2437
00:48:47,319 --> 00:48:49,349
to that so both systems um have
vulnerabilities um

2438

vulnerabilities um
 

2439
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,750
vulnerabilities um
i think the main thing now that we need

2440
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:51,760
i think the main thing now that we need
 

2441
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,190
i think the main thing now that we need
to think about

2442
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:53,200
to think about
 

2443
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,390
to think about
is those vulnerabilities democracy is an

2444
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:56,400
is those vulnerabilities democracy is an
 

2445
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,829
is those vulnerabilities democracy is an
amazing system because it requ

2446
00:48:59,829 --> 00:48:59,839
amazing system because it requ
 

2447
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:02,630

system and the checks and balances is
 

2451
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,430
system and the checks and balances is
quite amazing and it gives it a

2472
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:32,400
important to them than the system the
 

2473
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,190
important to them than the system the
system is in jeopardy so we have a

2474
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:35,200
system is in jeopardy so we have a
 

2475
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,150
system is in jeopardy so we have a
situation that's very much like that

2476
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:38,160
situation that's very much like that
 

2477
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,349
situation that's very much like that
in terms of

2478
00:49:39,349 --> 00:49:39,359
in terms of
 

2479
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:42,829
in terms of
let's say the 2024 elections

2480
00:49:42,829 --> 00:49:42,839
let's say the 2024 elections
 

2481
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:45,750
let's say the 2024 elections
i believe that there's a very high

2482
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:45,760
i believe that there's a very high
 

2483
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,190
i believe that there's a very high
chance that neither side will accept

2484
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:49,200
chance that neither side will accept
 

2485
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,549
chance that neither side will accept
losing

2486
00:49:50,549 --> 00:49:50,559
losing
 

2487
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:54,230
losing
for example and so we um

2488
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:54,240
for example and so we um
 

2489
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,870
for example and so we um
we have that kind of a situation so

2490
00:49:56,870 --> 00:49:56,880
we have that kind of a situation so
 

2491
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,990
we have that kind of a situation so
one would hope that one could rise above

2492
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:00,000
one would hope that one could rise above
 

2493
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,670
one would hope that one could rise above
the disagreements

2494
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:01,680
the disagreements
 

2495
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:05,510
the disagreements
and rely on the system uh for resolving

2496
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:05,520
and rely on the system uh for resolving
 

2497
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,390
and rely on the system uh for resolving
disagreements because if if that doesn't

2498
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:08,400
disagreements because if if that doesn't
 

2499
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:13,190
disagreements because if if that doesn't
happen then we have our own uh chaos

2500
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:13,200
happen then we have our own uh chaos
 

2501
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,430
happen then we have our own uh chaos
so the kind of the trend that started in

2502
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:15,440
so the kind of the trend that started in
 

2503
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,390
so the kind of the trend that started in
2020 this or i mean i mean i suppose

2504
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:18,400
2020 this or i mean i mean i suppose
 

2505
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,670
2020 this or i mean i mean i suppose
it's been there

2506
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:19,680
it's been there
 

2507
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,430
it's been there
it's been growing

2508
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:21,440
it's been growing
 

2509
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,109
it's been growing
a rep one representation of this

2510
00:50:23,109 --> 00:50:23,119
a rep one representation of this
 

2511
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:25,589
a rep one representation of this
internal disorder has been the growing

2512
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:25,599
internal disorder has been the growing
 

2513
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:27,750
internal disorder has been the growing
trend of being skeptical about the

2514
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:27,760
trend of being skeptical about the
 

2515
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,510
trend of being skeptical about the
results of the election

2516
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:29,520
results of the election
 

2517
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,589
results of the election
well it started before that

2518
00:50:31,589 --> 00:50:31,599
well it started before that
 

2519
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:34,549
well it started before that
there was the emergence of populism

2520
00:50:34,549 --> 00:50:34,559
there was the emergence of populism
 

2521
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:38,309
there was the emergence of populism
where before uh president uh trump was

2522
00:50:38,309 --> 00:50:38,319
where before uh president uh trump was
 

2523
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:39,829
where before uh president uh trump was
elected

2524
00:50:39,829 --> 00:50:39,839
elected
 

2525
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:42,069
elected
he was basically elected

2526
00:50:42,069 --> 00:50:42,079
he was basically elected
 

2527
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:44,390
he was basically elected
as a populist because there was a large

2528
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:44,400
as a populist because there was a large
 

2529
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,710
as a populist because there was a large
percentage of the population

2530
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:46,720
percentage of the population
 

2531
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,589
percentage of the population
that felt that the system didn't work

2532
00:50:49,589 --> 00:50:49,599
that felt that the system didn't work
 

2533
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:50,549
that felt that the system didn't work
for them

2534
00:50:50,549 --> 00:50:50,559
for them
 

2535
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:53,109
for them
and he tapped into that and he was

2536
00:50:53,109 --> 00:50:53,119
and he tapped into that and he was
 

2537
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:55,990
and he tapped into that and he was
largely elected as a populist leader

2538
00:50:55,990 --> 00:50:56,000
largely elected as a populist leader
 

2539
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,549
largely elected as a populist leader
first populous leader in a developed

2540
00:50:58,549 --> 00:50:58,559
first populous leader in a developed
 

2541
00:50:58,559 --> 00:50:59,750
first populous leader in a developed
country

2542
00:50:59,750 --> 00:50:59,760
country
 

2543
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:04,069
country
um and so populism began that then

2544
00:51:04,069 --> 00:51:04,079
um and so populism began that then
 

2545
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:06,390
um and so populism began that then
and that was a battle of one group

2546
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:06,400
and that was a battle of one group
 

2547
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,510
and that was a battle of one group
against the other group and so since

2548
00:51:09,510 --> 00:51:09,520
against the other group and so since
 

2549
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,230
against the other group and so since
then it's been like that and it

2550
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:12,240
then it's been like that and it
 

2551
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:17,829
then it's been like that and it
continued to grow

2552
00:51:17,829 --> 00:51:17,839

 

2553
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:20,470

you've mentioned

2554
00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:20,480
you've mentioned
 

2555
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,190
you've mentioned
the vulnerability of democracy that

2556
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:23,200
the vulnerability of democracy that
 

2557
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,349
the vulnerability of democracy that
internal disorder is the vulnerability

2558
00:51:25,349 --> 00:51:25,359
internal disorder is the vulnerability
 

2559
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:28,069
internal disorder is the vulnerability
of democracy what's the vulnerability of

2560
00:51:28,069 --> 00:51:28,079
of democracy what's the vulnerability of
 

2561
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:31,109
of democracy what's the vulnerability of
a system like china maybe one way to say

2562
00:51:31,109 --> 00:51:31,119
a system like china maybe one way to say
 

2563
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:33,270
a system like china maybe one way to say
is put china aside and look at history

2564
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:33,280
is put china aside and look at history
 

2565
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,190
is put china aside and look at history
like a soviet union what's the

2566
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:35,200
like a soviet union what's the
 

2567
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,150
like a soviet union what's the
vulnerability of a communist

2568
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:38,160
vulnerability of a communist
 

2569
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,750
vulnerability of a communist
type system

2570
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:39,760
type system
 

2571
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,790
type system
well i'll call it both communist

2572
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:42,800
well i'll call it both communist
 

2573
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,069
well i'll call it both communist
and

2574
00:51:44,069 --> 00:51:44,079
and
 

2575
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:46,390
and
autocratic sure

2576
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:46,400
autocratic sure
 

2577
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,950
autocratic sure
depending on how much autocracy

2578
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:48,960
depending on how much autocracy
 

2579
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,390
depending on how much autocracy
is that it lacks flexibility

2580
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:52,400
is that it lacks flexibility
 

2581
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,470
is that it lacks flexibility
it it lacks um the ability

2582
00:51:56,470 --> 00:51:56,480
it it lacks um the ability
 

2583
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,069
it it lacks um the ability
so but i should deal with them

2584
00:51:58,069 --> 00:51:58,079
so but i should deal with them
 

2585
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,230
so but i should deal with them
differently um in other words there's

2586
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:00,240
differently um in other words there's
 

2587
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,990
differently um in other words there's
the economic system

2588
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:02,000
the economic system
 

2589
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,790
the economic system
the economic system um threatens

2590
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:04,800
the economic system um threatens
 

2591
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,069
the economic system um threatens
motivation

2592
00:52:06,069 --> 00:52:06,079
motivation
 

2593
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:08,870
motivation
and productivity so communism or

2594
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:08,880
and productivity so communism or
 

2595
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,230
and productivity so communism or
socialism

2596
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:10,240
socialism
 

2597
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:13,510
socialism
uh has to be done in a way where

2598
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:13,520
uh has to be done in a way where
 

2599
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,950
uh has to be done in a way where
um you can threaten productivity

2600
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:16,960
um you can threaten productivity
 

2601
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,270
um you can threaten productivity
capitalism has

2602
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:19,280
capitalism has
 

2603
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,430
capitalism has
and what i mean by that i mean free

2604
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:21,440
and what i mean by that i mean free
 

2605
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,549
and what i mean by that i mean free
markets and capital markets

2606
00:52:24,549 --> 00:52:24,559
markets and capital markets
 

2607
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:26,230
markets and capital markets
i have been an effective way of

2608
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:26,240
i have been an effective way of
 

2609
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,390
i have been an effective way of
allocating resources

2610
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:28,400
allocating resources
 

2611
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,950
allocating resources
and also creating the

2612
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:30,960
and also creating the
 

2613
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,390
and also creating the
the incentives

2614
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:32,400
the incentives
 

2615
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,069
the incentives
and the resources providing the

2616
00:52:34,069 --> 00:52:34,079
and the resources providing the
 

2617
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:36,309
and the resources providing the
resources for the inventiveness of new

2618
00:52:36,309 --> 00:52:36,319
resources for the inventiveness of new
 

2619
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:40,470
resources for the inventiveness of new
ideas and so if i compare that

2620
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:40,480
ideas and so if i compare that
 

2621
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,950
ideas and so if i compare that
what the chinese have done to a large

2622
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:42,960
what the chinese have done to a large
 

2623
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,670
what the chinese have done to a large
extent is to recognize that and have

2624
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:45,680
extent is to recognize that and have
 

2625
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,030
extent is to recognize that and have
made a move

2626
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:47,040
made a move
 

2627
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,069
made a move
that's why the uh seeming

2628
00:52:50,069 --> 00:52:50,079
that's why the uh seeming
 

2629
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:52,549
that's why the uh seeming
dialectic or the conflict between those

2630
00:52:52,549 --> 00:52:52,559
dialectic or the conflict between those
 

2631
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:55,430
dialectic or the conflict between those
two things exists but anyway that's it

2632
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:55,440
two things exists but anyway that's it
 

2633
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,790
two things exists but anyway that's it
as far as an autocratic system

2634
00:52:58,790 --> 00:52:58,800
as far as an autocratic system
 

2635
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,470
as far as an autocratic system
rather than um one man one vote from the

2636
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:02,480
rather than um one man one vote from the
 

2637
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,150
rather than um one man one vote from the
population up

2638
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:04,160
population up
 

2639
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,270
population up
the risks of the autocratic system

2640
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:07,280
the risks of the autocratic system
 

2641
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:10,470
the risks of the autocratic system
is that there's enough discontent that

2642
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:10,480
is that there's enough discontent that
 

2643
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,230
is that there's enough discontent that
arises

2644
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:12,240
arises
 

2645
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,870
arises
that the system doesn't have the

2646
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:14,880
that the system doesn't have the
 

2647
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,390
that the system doesn't have the
flexibility

2648
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:16,400
flexibility
 

2649
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,589
flexibility
and that rather than bending um it

2650
00:53:19,589 --> 00:53:19,599
and that rather than bending um it
 

2651
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:20,630
and that rather than bending um it
breaks

2652
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:20,640
breaks
 

2653
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:24,309
breaks
um that's that's the big risk um the

2654
00:53:24,309 --> 00:53:24,319
um that's that's the big risk um the
 

2655
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:27,750
um that's that's the big risk um the
notion of trying to control a

2656
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:27,760
notion of trying to control a
 

2657
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:30,069
notion of trying to control a
um if there's that rather than giving it

2658
00:53:30,069 --> 00:53:30,079
um if there's that rather than giving it
 

2659
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:31,670
um if there's that rather than giving it
the flexibility

2660
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:31,680
the flexibility
 

2661
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:34,309
the flexibility
um so that's the that would be the big

2662
00:53:34,309 --> 00:53:34,319
um so that's the that would be the big
 

2663
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:36,470
um so that's the that would be the big
risk of the autocratic system what's the

2664
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:36,480
risk of the autocratic system what's the
 

2665
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,349
risk of the autocratic system what's the
human

2666
00:53:37,349 --> 00:53:37,359
human
 

2667
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:38,549
human
uh

2668
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:38,559
uh
 

2669
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:39,910
uh
because you mentioned like the top gets

2670
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:39,920
because you mentioned like the top gets
 

2671
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,390
because you mentioned like the top gets
bigger with empires

2672
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:42,400
bigger with empires
 

2673
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,589
bigger with empires
and you start taking things for granted

2674
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:45,599
and you start taking things for granted
 

2675
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:48,150
and you start taking things for granted
is the some of this just human nature

2676
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:48,160
is the some of this just human nature
 

2677
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,710
is the some of this just human nature
so the concern with with china

2678
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:50,720
so the concern with with china
 

2679
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,190
so the concern with with china
with autocratic nations

2680
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:53,200
with autocratic nations
 

2681
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,589
with autocratic nations
the concern with the

2682
00:53:55,589 --> 00:53:55,599
the concern with the
 

2683
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:57,589
the concern with the
the third reich

2684
00:53:57,589 --> 00:53:57,599
the third reich
 

2685
00:53:57,599 --> 00:53:59,829
the third reich
the soviet union

2686
00:53:59,829 --> 00:53:59,839
the soviet union
 

2687
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:01,670
the soviet union
was that

2688
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:01,680
was that
 

2689
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,430
was that
fundamentally at the individual level

2690
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:03,440
fundamentally at the individual level
 

2691
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,309
fundamentally at the individual level
the humans involved at the top

2692
00:54:06,309 --> 00:54:06,319
the humans involved at the top
 

2693
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:08,790
the humans involved at the top
they start becoming they're starting to

2694
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:08,800
they start becoming they're starting to
 

2695
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,030
they start becoming they're starting to
lose touch with reality

2696
00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:11,040
lose touch with reality
 

2697
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,230
lose touch with reality
in a way that

2698
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:12,240
in a way that
 

2699
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,069
in a way that
no longer makes them i guess that's the

2700
00:54:14,069 --> 00:54:14,079
no longer makes them i guess that's the
 

2701
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:15,750
no longer makes them i guess that's the
representation of the flexibility that

2702
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:15,760
representation of the flexibility that
 

2703
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,309
representation of the flexibility that
you're referring to well i'm i mean in a

2704
00:54:18,309 --> 00:54:18,319
you're referring to well i'm i mean in a
 

2705
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:20,309
you're referring to well i'm i mean in a
democracy

2706
00:54:20,309 --> 00:54:20,319
democracy
 

2707
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:22,150
democracy
you could change you can go as far left

2708
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:22,160
you could change you can go as far left
 

2709
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,309
you could change you can go as far left
or as far right you can change the

2710
00:54:24,309 --> 00:54:24,319
or as far right you can change the
 

2711
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:26,870
or as far right you can change the
leaders easily and so the people don't

2712
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:26,880
leaders easily and so the people don't
 

2713
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:27,910
leaders easily and so the people don't
become

2714
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:27,920
become
 

2715
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,910
become
um you know they pretty much only have

2716
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:29,920
um you know they pretty much only have
 

2717
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,829
um you know they pretty much only have
themselves to blame uh yeah you know and

2718
00:54:33,829 --> 00:54:33,839
themselves to blame uh yeah you know and
 

2719
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:36,230
themselves to blame uh yeah you know and
one of the problems of that is they may

2720
00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:36,240
one of the problems of that is they may
 

2721
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:39,270
one of the problems of that is they may
not choose the best leaders

2722
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:39,280
not choose the best leaders
 

2723
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:40,630
not choose the best leaders
but they

2724
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:40,640
but they
 

2725
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,270
but they
they have that flexibility so if vote

2726
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:43,280
they have that flexibility so if vote
 

2727
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,230
they have that flexibility so if vote
and

2728
00:54:44,230 --> 00:54:44,240
and
 

2729
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,069
and
you get what you wanted

2730
00:54:46,069 --> 00:54:46,079
you get what you wanted
 

2731
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:48,069
you get what you wanted
in the case of the autocratic let's say

2732
00:54:48,069 --> 00:54:48,079
in the case of the autocratic let's say
 

2733
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:50,309
in the case of the autocratic let's say
leaders and then the movement from

2734
00:54:50,309 --> 00:54:50,319
leaders and then the movement from
 

2735
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:53,990
leaders and then the movement from
democracies to autocracies

2736
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:54,000
democracies to autocracies
 

2737
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,190
democracies to autocracies
what you

2738
00:54:55,190 --> 00:54:55,200
what you
 

2739
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,910
what you
see normally that movement is that one

2740
00:54:57,910 --> 00:54:57,920
see normally that movement is that one
 

2741
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,390
see normally that movement is that one
of the systems is it is not working

2742
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:00,400
of the systems is it is not working
 

2743
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,150
of the systems is it is not working
let's say the democracy is not

2744
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:02,160
let's say the democracy is not
 

2745
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,990
let's say the democracy is not
effectively everybody's arguing with

2746
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:04,000
effectively everybody's arguing with
 

2747
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,430
effectively everybody's arguing with
each other and nobody's getting anything

2748
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:05,440
each other and nobody's getting anything
 

2749
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,470
each other and nobody's getting anything
done and

2750
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:06,480
done and
 

2751
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,630
done and
you know like mussolini the trains are

2752
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:08,640
you know like mussolini the trains are
 

2753
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:11,430
you know like mussolini the trains are
not running on time and that would be

2754
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:11,440
not running on time and that would be
 

2755
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,750
not running on time and that would be
the example jesus this place has gotten

2756
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:13,760
the example jesus this place has gotten
 

2757
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,549
the example jesus this place has gotten
chaotic will somebody get into control

2758
00:55:16,549 --> 00:55:16,559
chaotic will somebody get into control
 

2759
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:18,829
chaotic will somebody get into control
and then they then you get the

2760
00:55:18,829 --> 00:55:18,839
and then they then you get the
 

2761
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:22,309
and then they then you get the
autocratic um and then he's autocratic

2762
00:55:22,309 --> 00:55:22,319
autocratic um and then he's autocratic
 

2763
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:26,390
autocratic um and then he's autocratic
enough to boss people around and um and

2764
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:26,400
enough to boss people around and um and
 

2765
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,870
enough to boss people around and um and
then you follow those kinds of orders

2766
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:28,880
then you follow those kinds of orders
 

2767
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,510
then you follow those kinds of orders
and it's like a maybe a ceo in a

2768
00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:31,520
and it's like a maybe a ceo in a
 

2769
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,430
and it's like a maybe a ceo in a
powerful company ordering around and

2770
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:33,440
powerful company ordering around and
 

2771
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,190
powerful company ordering around and
that could work well or it could work

2772
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:35,200
that could work well or it could work
 

2773
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,190
that could work well or it could work
badly you know most

2774
00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:37,200
badly you know most
 

2775
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,030
badly you know most
um companies

2776
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:39,040
um companies
 

2777
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,990
um companies
are run as um

2778
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:42,000
are run as um
 

2779
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,990
are run as um
like autocracies in a sense you know

2780
00:55:43,990 --> 00:55:44,000
like autocracies in a sense you know
 

2781
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,910
like autocracies in a sense you know
there's the hierarchy and you the

2782
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:45,920
there's the hierarchy and you the
 

2783
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,510
there's the hierarchy and you the
command economy and that kind of thing

2784
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:49,520
command economy and that kind of thing
 

2785
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:54,069
command economy and that kind of thing
and now that can work well or not um but

2786
00:55:54,069 --> 00:55:54,079
and now that can work well or not um but
 

2787
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:56,309
and now that can work well or not um but
then what quite often when you get the

2788
00:55:56,309 --> 00:55:56,319
then what quite often when you get the
 

2789
00:55:56,319 --> 00:56:00,390
then what quite often when you get the
populist autocratic their personality is

2790
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:00,400
populist autocratic their personality is
 

2791
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,270
populist autocratic their personality is
something that they want to fight

2792
00:56:03,270 --> 00:56:03,280
something that they want to fight
 

2793
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:06,870
something that they want to fight
and they become more nationalistic

2794
00:56:06,870 --> 00:56:06,880
and they become more nationalistic
 

2795
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,470
and they become more nationalistic
and they tend to become more

2796
00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:08,480
and they tend to become more
 

2797
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:11,750
and they tend to become more
militaristic and human nature at that

2798
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:11,760
militaristic and human nature at that

stage
 

2801
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,829
stage
lends itself to fighting there's an arc

2802
00:56:15,829 --> 00:56:15,839
lends itself to fighting there's an arc
 

2803
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:17,829
lends itself to fighting there's an arc
here that when we think

2804
00:56:17,829 --> 00:56:17,839
here that when we think
 

2805
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:20,230
here that when we think
it's we think of a country

2806
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:20,240
it's we think of a country
 

2807
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,950
it's we think of a country
um and we say we when we think of a

2808
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:22,960
um and we say we when we think of a
 

2809

um and we say we when we think of a
country

2810
00:56:23,910 --> 00:56:23,920
country
 

2811
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,549
country
um it's not true it's not like that

2812
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:26,559
um it's not true it's not like that
 

2813

um it's not true it's not like that
there are individuals who change

2814
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:28,960
there are individuals who change
 

2815
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,950
there are individuals who change
one generation dies and another

2816
00:56:30,950 --> 00:56:30,960
one generation dies and another
 

2817
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,870
one generation dies and another
generation comes along

2818
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:32,880
generation comes along
 

2819
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:37,349
generation comes along
and one of those arcs is that um

2820
00:56:37,349 --> 00:56:37,359
and one of those arcs is that um
 

2821
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:39,670
and one of those arcs is that um
the ones who have been through war

2822

um abide by whatever the rules are
 

2829
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:50,710
um abide by whatever the rules are
as you get farther along into that cycle

2830
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:50,720
as you get farther along into that cycle
 

2831
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,630
as you get farther along into that cycle
and you get a new generation and they

2832
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:52,640
and you get a new generation and they
 

2833
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,470

then they want to uh uh fight and so
 

2839
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:01,670
then they want to uh uh fight and so
you're seeing right now

2840
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:01,680
you're seeing right now
 

2841
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:05,190
you're seeing right now
the emergent of fight for right and and

2842
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:05,200
the emergent of fight for right and and
 

2843
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:08,470
the emergent of fight for right and and
what that means is you see it internally

2844
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:08,480
what that means is you see it internally
 

2845
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,750
what that means is you see it internally
uh fight

2846
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:09,760
uh fight
 

2847
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:13,030
uh fight
where are you and fight for that thing

2848
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:13,040
where are you and fight for that thing
 

2849
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,710
where are you and fight for that thing
and they mean fight

2850

and they mean fight
 

2851
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,910
and they mean fight
and then into externally fight are you

2852
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:17,920
and then into externally fight are you
 

2853
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,390
and then into externally fight are you
going to be uh the strong one who will

2854
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:20,400

2857
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:26,630
fight and win and that develops on both
sides this fight and win and each side

2858
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:26,640
sides this fight and win and each side
 

2859
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:30,150
sides this fight and win and each side
is cheering each other on into uh a war

is cheering each other on into uh a war
 

2861

interesting because like in doing this
 

2879
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:53,910
interesting because like in doing this
study and it comes across in the study

2880

study and it comes across in the study
 

2881
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:55,750
study and it comes across in the study
it's like watching the same movie over

00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,030
when he
came to power

2962
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:23,040

and um there were not

2964
00:59:26,069 --> 00:59:26,079

institutions

2966
00:59:27,589 --> 00:59:27,599
institutions
 

2967
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:29,349
institutions
the whole thing had collapsed and it was

2968
00:59:29,349 --> 00:59:29,359
the whole thing had collapsed and it was
 

2969
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:31,829
the whole thing had collapsed and it was
not effective ministry of education

2970

ministry of anything
 

2973
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:36,950
ministry of anything
and so the idea

2974
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:36,960
and so the idea
 

2975
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:39,910
and so the idea
was that they needed 25 years of

2976
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:39,920
was that they needed 25 years of
 

2977

00:59:43,589 --> 00:59:43,599
stability and they needed a democracy
 

2979
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:45,109

and they needed
the the improvement of capital markets

3249
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:58,470
choices and then beyond that in many
cases the issues are quite complex like

3250
01:04:58,470 --> 01:04:58,480
cases the issues are quite complex like
 

3251
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,950
cases the issues are quite complex like
there are geopolitical questions that

3252
01:05:00,950 --> 01:05:00,960
there are geopolitical questions that
 

3253
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:04,950
there are geopolitical questions that
enter into it so um uh and then i i

3254
01:05:04,950 --> 01:05:04,960
enter into it so um uh and then i i
 

3255
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:07,510
enter into it so um uh and then i i
believe that if if you

3256
01:05:07,510 --> 01:05:07,520
believe that if if you
 

3257
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:10,710
believe that if if you
disconnected if all those

3258
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:10,720
disconnected if all those
 

3259
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:14,150
disconnected if all those
if entities like myself the businesses

3260
01:05:14,150 --> 01:05:14,160
if entities like myself the businesses
 

3261
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,390
if entities like myself the businesses
uh doing business with china

3262
01:05:16,390 --> 01:05:16,400
uh doing business with china
 

3263
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:19,510
uh doing business with china
disconnected i think that that would be

3264
01:05:19,510 --> 01:05:19,520
disconnected i think that that would be
 

3265
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:22,390
disconnected i think that that would be
disastrous economically disastrous and

3266
01:05:22,390 --> 01:05:22,400
disastrous economically disastrous and
 

3267
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:25,270
disastrous economically disastrous and
it would also be um reduce

3268
01:05:25,270 --> 01:05:25,280
it would also be um reduce
 

3269
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:28,390
it would also be um reduce
um the the understanding that comes from

3270
01:05:28,390 --> 01:05:28,400
um the the understanding that comes from
 

3271
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,470
um the the understanding that comes from
working together that helps to reduce

3272
01:05:30,470 --> 01:05:30,480
working together that helps to reduce
 

3273
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:33,910
working together that helps to reduce
wars and so these are all complicated so

3274
01:05:33,910 --> 01:05:33,920
wars and so these are all complicated so
 

3275
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:35,349
wars and so these are all complicated so
what we do

3276
01:05:35,349 --> 01:05:35,359
what we do
 

3277
01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:36,549
what we do
is uh

3278
01:05:36,549 --> 01:05:36,559
is uh
 

3279
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:39,029
is uh

01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:31,990
exchange and a storehold of wealth
and we are looking for

3844
01:16:31,990 --> 01:16:32,000
and we are looking for
 

3845
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,590
and we are looking for
and it's portable

3846
01:16:33,590 --> 01:16:33,600
and it's portable
 

3847
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:36,070
and it's portable
and you can and it's best if it's

3848
01:16:36,070 --> 01:16:36,080
and you can and it's best if it's
 

3849

recognized in other countries
 

3851
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:43,030
recognized in other countries
um so gold is one of those so i look at

3852
01:16:43,030 --> 01:16:43,040
um so gold is one of those so i look at
 

3853
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:46,390
um so gold is one of those so i look at
it as an alternative gold

3854
01:16:46,390 --> 01:16:46,400
it as an alternative gold
 

3855
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:48,310
it as an alternative gold
but i look at a number of things as

3856
01:16:48,310 --> 01:16:48,320
but i look at a number of things as
 

3857
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:49,910
but i look at a number of things as
alternative gold

3858
01:16:49,910 --> 01:16:49,920
alternative gold
 

3859
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:53,030
alternative gold
um and i think that and i think and gold

3860
01:16:53,030 --> 01:16:53,040
um and i think that and i think and gold
 

3861
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:54,709
um and i think that and i think and gold
is still my favorite

3862
01:16:54,709 --> 01:16:54,719
is still my favorite
 

3863
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:57,590
is still my favorite
because of certain qualities for example

3864
01:16:57,590 --> 01:16:57,600
because of certain qualities for example
 

3865
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:00,790
because of certain qualities for example
um you can't trace it in in bitcoin you

3866
01:17:00,790 --> 01:17:00,800
um you can't trace it in in bitcoin you
 

3867
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:03,030
um you can't trace it in in bitcoin you
can trace who owns it where it's going

3868
01:17:03,030 --> 01:17:03,040
can trace who owns it where it's going
 

3869
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:05,030
can trace who owns it where it's going
and and so on governments can't have

3870
01:17:05,030 --> 01:17:05,040
and and so on governments can't have
 

3871
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:07,510
and and so on governments can't have
that ability to trace it and so on a

3872
01:17:07,510 --> 01:17:07,520
that ability to trace it and so on a
 

3873
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:09,669
that ability to trace it and so on a
gold piece of coin it's it's not

3874
01:17:09,669 --> 01:17:09,679
gold piece of coin it's it's not
 

3875
01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:12,229
gold piece of coin it's it's not
connected i think not connected has

3876
01:17:12,229 --> 01:17:12,239
connected i think not connected has
 

3877
01:17:12,239 --> 01:17:15,110
connected i think not connected has
benefits particularly in a world where

3878
01:17:15,110 --> 01:17:15,120
benefits particularly in a world where
 

3879
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:17,990
benefits particularly in a world where
maybe connections can be more risky

3880
01:17:17,990 --> 01:17:18,000
maybe connections can be more risky
 

3881
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,590
maybe connections can be more risky
um so

3882
01:17:19,590 --> 01:17:19,600
um so
 

3883
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:22,709
um so
and then also gold has been

3884
01:17:22,709 --> 01:17:22,719
and then also gold has been
 

3885
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:25,830
and then also gold has been
for many thousands of years universally

3886
01:17:25,830 --> 01:17:25,840
for many thousands of years universally
 

3887
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:28,550
for many thousands of years universally
recognized as a source of money and

3888
01:17:28,550 --> 01:17:28,560
recognized as a source of money and
 

3889
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:31,430
recognized as a source of money and
central banks it's the third largest

3890
01:17:31,430 --> 01:17:31,440
central banks it's the third largest
 

3891
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:34,149
central banks it's the third largest
uh source of money in central bank

3892
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:34,159
uh source of money in central bank
 

3893
01:17:34,159 --> 01:17:35,350
uh source of money in central bank
reserves

3894
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:35,360
reserves
 

3895
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:37,830
reserves
and i don't think bitcoin is going to

3896
01:17:37,830 --> 01:17:37,840
and i don't think bitcoin is going to
 

3897
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:40,310
and i don't think bitcoin is going to
serve those types of purposes and so on

3898
01:17:40,310 --> 01:17:40,320
serve those types of purposes and so on
 

3899
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:43,189
serve those types of purposes and so on
so for various reasons i prefer gold to

3900
01:17:43,189 --> 01:17:43,199
so for various reasons i prefer gold to
 

3901
01:17:43,199 --> 01:17:45,590
so for various reasons i prefer gold to
the other but it's a little bit part of

3902
01:17:45,590 --> 01:17:45,600
the other but it's a little bit part of
 

3903
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:46,790
the other but it's a little bit part of
my mix

3904
01:17:46,790 --> 01:17:46,800
my mix
 

3905
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,870
my mix
but then you look at it it hit i think

3906
01:17:48,870 --> 01:17:48,880
but then you look at it it hit i think
 

3907
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:52,630
but then you look at it it hit i think
69 000 this year as the high bitcoin hit

3908
01:17:52,630 --> 01:17:52,640
69 000 this year as the high bitcoin hit
 

3909
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:54,310
69 000 this year as the high bitcoin hit
do you think it's possible you mentioned

3910
01:17:54,310 --> 01:17:54,320
do you think it's possible you mentioned
 

3911
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:55,430
do you think it's possible you mentioned
gold

3912
01:17:55,430 --> 01:17:55,440
gold
 

3913

01:17:57,830 --> 01:17:57,840
do you think it's possible it reaches
 

3915
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:00,790
do you think it's possible it reaches
very high numbers like 1 million some

3916
01:18:00,790 --> 01:18:00,800
very high numbers like 1 million some
 

3917
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:02,229
very high numbers like 1 million some
people talk about

01:18:15,669 --> 01:18:15,679
a certain amount of it
 

3931
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:17,830
a certain amount of it
and there's a certain amount of gold

3932
01:18:17,830 --> 01:18:17,840
and there's a certain amount of gold
 

3933
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:21,189
and there's a certain amount of gold
i'll use gold as a benchmark

3934
01:18:21,189 --> 01:18:21,199
i'll use gold as a benchmark
 

3935
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:24,229
i'll use gold as a benchmark
the amount of it is worth about five uh

3936
01:18:24,229 --> 01:18:24,239
the amount of it is worth about five uh
 

3937
01:18:24,239 --> 01:18:26,630
the amount of it is worth about five uh
about one trillion dollars

3938
01:18:26,630 --> 01:18:26,640
about one trillion dollars
 

3939
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:29,669
about one trillion dollars
total cryptos about 2.2 trillion but

3940
01:18:29,669 --> 01:18:29,679
total cryptos about 2.2 trillion but
 

3941
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:32,390
total cryptos about 2.2 trillion but
let's say bitcoin uh it's one trillion

3942
01:18:32,390 --> 01:18:32,400
let's say bitcoin uh it's one trillion
 

3943
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:33,669
let's say bitcoin uh it's one trillion
dollars

3944
01:18:33,669 --> 01:18:33,679
dollars
 

3945
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:36,709
dollars
if you take the amount of money that is

3946
01:18:36,709 --> 01:18:36,719
if you take the amount of money that is
 

3947
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:38,390
if you take the amount of money that is
in um

3948
01:18:38,390 --> 01:18:38,400
in um
 

3949
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:39,350
in um
gold

3950
01:18:39,350 --> 01:18:39,360
gold
 

3951
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:42,229
gold
that is not used for jewelry purposes

3952
01:18:42,229 --> 01:18:42,239
that is not used for jewelry purposes
 

3953
01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:45,189
that is not used for jewelry purposes
and not used by central banks and i

3954
01:18:45,189 --> 01:18:45,199
and not used by central banks and i
 

3955
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:47,590
and not used by central banks and i
assume bitcoin won't be used for jewelry

3956
01:18:47,590 --> 01:18:47,600
assume bitcoin won't be used for jewelry
 

3957

purposes or central bank purposes
 

3959
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:53,510
purposes or central bank purposes
um that amount in gold is about five

3960
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:53,520
um that amount in gold is about five
 

3961
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:55,030
um that amount in gold is about five
trillion dollars

3962
01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:55,040
trillion dollars
 

3963
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:57,590
trillion dollars
so right now if you were to

3964
01:18:57,590 --> 01:18:57,600
so right now if you were to
 

3965
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:00,709
so right now if you were to
have a portfolio that has um gold and

3966
01:19:00,709 --> 01:19:00,719
have a portfolio that has um gold and
 

3967
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:04,390
have a portfolio that has um gold and
crypto um gold then bitcoin it's worth

3968
01:19:04,390 --> 01:19:04,400
crypto um gold then bitcoin it's worth
 

3969
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:07,430
crypto um gold then bitcoin it's worth
about 20 of the value of gold

3970
01:19:07,430 --> 01:19:07,440
about 20 of the value of gold
 

3971
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:10,390
about 20 of the value of gold
do i think it's going to be uh worth

3972
01:19:10,390 --> 01:19:10,400
do i think it's going to be uh worth
 

3973
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:12,470
do i think it's going to be uh worth
more than gold

3974
01:19:12,470 --> 01:19:12,480
more than gold
 

3975
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:14,070
more than gold
in terms of that mix

3976
01:19:14,070 --> 01:19:14,080
in terms of that mix
 

3977
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:16,070
in terms of that mix
i don't think it'll be worth more than

3978
01:19:16,070 --> 01:19:16,080
i don't think it'll be worth more than
 

3979
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:19,830
i don't think it'll be worth more than
gold but let's say it became worth

3980
01:19:19,830 --> 01:19:19,840
gold but let's say it became worth
 

3981
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:21,990
gold but let's say it became worth
as as much as gold i don't believe it

3982
01:19:21,990 --> 01:19:22,000
as as much as gold i don't believe it
 

3983
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,149
as as much as gold i don't believe it
will be i think that 20

3984
01:19:24,149 --> 01:19:24,159
will be i think that 20
 

3985
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:25,830
will be i think that 20
sounds kind of about right i really

3986
01:19:25,830 --> 01:19:25,840
sounds kind of about right i really
 

3987
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:28,390
sounds kind of about right i really
don't know that what the right answer is

3988
01:19:28,390 --> 01:19:28,400
don't know that what the right answer is
 

3989
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:30,790
don't know that what the right answer is
um and then there's the question of what

3990
01:19:30,790 --> 01:19:30,800
um and then there's the question of what
 

3991
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:33,750
um and then there's the question of what
is all of that pool of money

3992
01:19:33,750 --> 01:19:33,760
is all of that pool of money
 

3993
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:36,070
is all of that pool of money
that let's say gold and gold equivalents

3994
01:19:36,070 --> 01:19:36,080
that let's say gold and gold equivalents
 

3995
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:38,630
that let's say gold and gold equivalents
relative to everything else does it go

3996
01:19:38,630 --> 01:19:38,640
relative to everything else does it go
 

3997
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:39,750
relative to everything else does it go
from

3998
01:19:39,750 --> 01:19:39,760
from
 

3999
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:41,830
from
you know let's call it

4000
01:19:41,830 --> 01:19:41,840
you know let's call it
 

4001
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:44,229
you know let's call it
six seven eight trillion to sixteen

4002
01:19:44,229 --> 01:19:44,239
six seven eight trillion to sixteen
 

4003
01:19:44,239 --> 01:19:46,149
six seven eight trillion to sixteen
trillion maybe it could double it

4004
01:19:46,149 --> 01:19:46,159
trillion maybe it could double it
 

4005
01:19:46,159 --> 01:19:47,590
trillion maybe it could double it
depends what it is in the world

4006
01:19:47,590 --> 01:19:47,600
depends what it is in the world
 

4007
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:50,310
depends what it is in the world
environment but basically if you use

4008
01:19:50,310 --> 01:19:50,320
environment but basically if you use
 

4009
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:51,990
environment but basically if you use
gold as a measure

4010
01:19:51,990 --> 01:19:52,000
gold as a measure
 

4011
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:56,070
gold as a measure
i um there's no it just makes no sense

4012
01:19:56,070 --> 01:19:56,080
i um there's no it just makes no sense
 

4013
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:58,550
i um there's no it just makes no sense
that it's going to be used um

4014
01:19:58,550 --> 01:19:58,560
that it's going to be used um
 

4015
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:00,229
that it's going to be used um
that much more

4016
01:20:00,229 --> 01:20:00,239
that much more
 

4017
01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:02,470
that much more
am i sure about that i'm not sure about

4018
01:20:02,470 --> 01:20:02,480
am i sure about that i'm not sure about
 

4019
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:06,070
am i sure about that i'm not sure about
anything but logically it seems to me

4020
01:20:06,070 --> 01:20:06,080
anything but logically it seems to me
 

4021
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:09,270
anything but logically it seems to me
that there's a limitation on its price

4022
01:20:09,270 --> 01:20:09,280
that there's a limitation on its price
 

4023
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:11,510
that there's a limitation on its price
in relationship to other things that are

4090
01:21:26,550 --> 01:21:26,560
and so then there's always what's behind
 

4091
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:29,430
and so then there's always what's behind
it i have a lot of respect for

4092
01:21:29,430 --> 01:21:29,440
it i have a lot of respect for
 

4093
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:32,950
it i have a lot of respect for
elon's ability to do other things behind

4094
01:21:32,950 --> 01:21:32,960
elon's ability to do other things behind
 

4095
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:37,189
elon's ability to do other things behind
it uh and so i would take that as um

4096
01:21:37,189 --> 01:21:37,199
it uh and so i would take that as um
 

4097
01:21:37,199 --> 01:21:39,430
it uh and so i would take that as um
symbolic and i'd be asking him what's

4098
01:21:39,430 --> 01:21:39,440
symbolic and i'd be asking him what's
 

4099
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:41,750
symbolic and i'd be asking him what's
behind it what's what's next and i'm

4100
01:21:41,750 --> 01:21:41,760
behind it what's what's next and i'm
 

4101
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:43,910
behind it what's what's next and i'm

4105
01:21:46,159 --> 01:21:48,470

01:21:48,470 --> 01:21:48,480
of humor and lightheartedness
 

4107
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:51,189
of humor and lightheartedness
that's that's really interesting about

01:21:51,189 --> 01:21:51,199
that's that's really interesting about
 

4109

there's something about taking things

4118
01:21:59,110 --> 01:21:59,120
there's something about taking things
 

4119
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:01,110
there's something about taking things
too seriously that somehow slows it all

4120

too seriously that somehow slows it all
 

4121
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:03,510
too seriously that somehow slows it all
down and it's interesting you're right

4122
01:22:03,510 --> 01:22:03,520
down and it's interesting you're right
 

4123
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:05,510
down and it's interesting you're right
that's part of human nature somehow so

4124
01:22:05,510 --> 01:22:05,520
that's part of human nature somehow so
 

4125

that's part of human nature somehow so
like humor is part of this whole thing

4127
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:11,990

you've uh talked about the importance of

4128
01:22:11,990 --> 01:22:12,000
you've uh talked about the importance of
 

4129
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,310
you've uh talked about the importance of
writing ideas down

4130
01:22:14,310 --> 01:22:14,320
writing ideas down
 

4131
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:15,430
writing ideas down
and uh you have

4132
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:15,440
and uh you have
 

4133
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:18,149
and uh you have
principles in particular in principles

4134
01:22:18,149 --> 01:22:18,159
principles in particular in principles
 

4135
01:22:18,159 --> 01:22:19,510
principles in particular in principles
and you have this really nice thing in

4136
01:22:19,510 --> 01:22:19,520
and you have this really nice thing in
 

4137
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:22,470
and you have this really nice thing in
your in your book we actually um

4138
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:22,480
your in your book we actually um
 

4139
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:24,790
your in your book we actually um
i think there's such a brilliant way

4140
01:22:24,790 --> 01:22:24,800
i think there's such a brilliant way
 

4141
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:25,750
i think there's such a brilliant way
okay

4142
01:22:25,750 --> 01:22:25,760
okay
 

4143
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:28,070
okay
uh you have such a brilliant way of

4144
01:22:28,070 --> 01:22:28,080
uh you have such a brilliant way of
 

4145
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:30,629
uh you have such a brilliant way of
highlighting which parts are

4146
01:22:30,629 --> 01:22:30,639
highlighting which parts are
 

4147
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:33,270
highlighting which parts are
extra important and you make them bold

4148
01:22:33,270 --> 01:22:33,280
extra important and you make them bold
 

4149
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:35,110
extra important and you make them bold
that's a brilliant idea but let me just

4150
01:22:35,110 --> 01:22:35,120
that's a brilliant idea but let me just
 

4151
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:36,870
that's a brilliant idea but let me just
ask the high-level question of what's a

4152
01:22:36,870 --> 01:22:36,880
ask the high-level question of what's a
 

4153
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:40,229
ask the high-level question of what's a
good system for um

4154
01:22:40,229 --> 01:22:40,239
good system for um
 

4155
01:22:40,239 --> 01:22:41,990
good system for um

4156
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:42,000

4157
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:42,870
taking notes
well

4158
01:22:42,870 --> 01:22:42,880
well
 

4159
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:45,430
well
i find that almost everything happens

4160
01:22:45,430 --> 01:22:45,440
i find that almost everything happens
 

4161
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:47,430
i find that almost everything happens
over and over again

4162
01:22:47,430 --> 01:22:47,440
over and over again
 

4163
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:48,470
over and over again
um

4164
01:22:48,470 --> 01:22:48,480
um
 

4165
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:50,950
um
and we're in this the blizzard of these

4166
01:22:50,950 --> 01:22:50,960
and we're in this the blizzard of these
 

4167
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:53,750
and we're in this the blizzard of these
things happening and what i found is

4168
01:22:53,750 --> 01:22:53,760
things happening and what i found is
 

4169
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:54,870
things happening and what i found is
that

4170
01:22:54,870 --> 01:22:54,880
that
 

4171
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:58,229
that
if i'm making a decision

4172
01:22:58,229 --> 01:22:58,239
if i'm making a decision
 

4173
01:22:58,239 --> 01:22:59,830
if i'm making a decision
that

4174
01:22:59,830 --> 01:22:59,840
that
 

4175
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:01,990
that
that after i make the decision usually

4176
01:23:01,990 --> 01:23:02,000
that after i make the decision usually
 

4177
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,870
that after i make the decision usually
or right at the time if i pause and

4178
01:23:04,870 --> 01:23:04,880
or right at the time if i pause and
 

4179
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:08,790
or right at the time if i pause and
reflect and i write my principle down in

4180
01:23:08,790 --> 01:23:08,800
reflect and i write my principle down in
 

4181
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:11,110
reflect and i write my principle down in
other words principle is sort of a

4182
01:23:11,110 --> 01:23:11,120
other words principle is sort of a
 

4183
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:12,229
other words principle is sort of a
recipe

4184
01:23:12,229 --> 01:23:12,239
recipe
 

4185
01:23:12,239 --> 01:23:15,110
recipe
what would i use to how would i make

4186
01:23:15,110 --> 01:23:15,120
what would i use to how would i make
 

4187
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:17,669
what would i use to how would i make
that decision and what are the criteria

4188
01:23:17,669 --> 01:23:17,679
that decision and what are the criteria
 

4189
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:20,070
that decision and what are the criteria
around it i find that i make it much

4190
01:23:20,070 --> 01:23:20,080
around it i find that i make it much
 

4191
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:20,870
around it i find that i make it much
more

4192
01:23:20,870 --> 01:23:20,880
more
 

4193
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:24,070
more
clear it becomes clearer and it applies

4194
01:23:24,070 --> 01:23:24,080
clear it becomes clearer and it applies
 

4195
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:26,629
clear it becomes clearer and it applies
to the next thing that comes along it'll

4196
01:23:26,629 --> 01:23:26,639
to the next thing that comes along it'll
 

4197
01:23:26,639 --> 01:23:27,350
to the next thing that comes along it'll
be

4198
01:23:27,350 --> 01:23:27,360
be
 

4199
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:29,669
be
that way because everything happens over

4200
01:23:29,669 --> 01:23:29,679
that way because everything happens over
 

4201
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:31,430
that way because everything happens over
and over and over again and i think

4202
01:23:31,430 --> 01:23:31,440
and over and over again and i think
 

4203
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:34,229
and over and over again and i think
people make the mistake of looking at

4204
01:23:34,229 --> 01:23:34,239
people make the mistake of looking at
 

4205
01:23:34,239 --> 01:23:36,470
people make the mistake of looking at
just the one like it's the first one

4206
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:36,480
just the one like it's the first one
 

4207
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:38,390
just the one like it's the first one
they have i don't know they have the

4208
01:23:38,390 --> 01:23:38,400
they have i don't know they have the
 

4209
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,790
they have i don't know they have the
first problem of this sort of the first

4210
01:23:40,790 --> 01:23:40,800
first problem of this sort of the first
 

4211
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:42,950
first problem of this sort of the first
child or whatever it is and this has

4212
01:23:42,950 --> 01:23:42,960
child or whatever it is and this has
 

4213
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:45,189
child or whatever it is and this has
been happening plenty of times and so if

4214
01:23:45,189 --> 01:23:45,199
been happening plenty of times and so if
 

4215
01:23:45,199 --> 01:23:47,669
been happening plenty of times and so if
you have the principles i found that

4216
01:23:47,669 --> 01:23:47,679
you have the principles i found that
 

4217
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:50,070
you have the principles i found that
that helped me think more clearly about

4218
01:23:50,070 --> 01:23:50,080
that helped me think more clearly about
 

4219
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:53,030
that helped me think more clearly about
it and it helped me communicate better

4220
01:23:53,030 --> 01:23:53,040
it and it helped me communicate better
 

4221
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:54,310
it and it helped me communicate better
like why

4222
01:23:54,310 --> 01:23:54,320
like why
 

4223
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:57,270
like why
and so over the years over the last 30

4224
01:23:57,270 --> 01:23:57,280
and so over the years over the last 30
 

4225
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:58,790
and so over the years over the last 30
years or so

4226
01:23:58,790 --> 01:23:58,800
years or so
 

4227
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,550
years or so
that's what i've done i did it

4228
01:24:00,550 --> 01:24:00,560
that's what i've done i did it
 

4229
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:02,790
that's what i've done i did it
originally to communicate very well with

4230
01:24:02,790 --> 01:24:02,800
originally to communicate very well with
 

4231
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:05,030
originally to communicate very well with
the people i work with um you know i set

4232
01:24:05,030 --> 01:24:05,040
the people i work with um you know i set
 

4233
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:07,350
the people i work with um you know i set
up my company and and i it was very

4234
01:24:07,350 --> 01:24:07,360
up my company and and i it was very
 

4235
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:09,270
up my company and and i it was very
important to have good communication and

4236
01:24:09,270 --> 01:24:09,280
important to have good communication and
 

4237
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:11,910
important to have good communication and
then we could debate the principles and

4238
01:24:11,910 --> 01:24:11,920
then we could debate the principles and
 

4239
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:13,910
then we could debate the principles and
so that's the process

4240
01:24:13,910 --> 01:24:13,920
so that's the process
 

4241
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:17,350
so that's the process
i urge people to do that there are many

4242
01:24:17,350 --> 01:24:17,360
i urge people to do that there are many
 

4243
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:19,990
i urge people to do that there are many
excellent decision makers um

4244
01:24:19,990 --> 01:24:20,000
excellent decision makers um
 

4245
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,390
excellent decision makers um
and i just wish that they wrote down

4246
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:22,400
and i just wish that they wrote down
 

4247
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:25,189
and i just wish that they wrote down
their principles when this set

4248
01:24:25,189 --> 01:24:25,199
their principles when this set
 

4249
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:26,070
their principles when this set
so

4250
01:24:26,070 --> 01:24:26,080
so
 

4251
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:27,669
so
for example

4252
01:24:27,669 --> 01:24:27,679
for example
 

4253
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:29,910
for example
we talked about henry kissinger and his

4254
01:24:29,910 --> 01:24:29,920
we talked about henry kissinger and his
 

4255
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:31,430
we talked about henry kissinger and his
new book is going to come out with a

4256
01:24:31,430 --> 01:24:31,440
new book is going to come out with a
 

4257
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:33,110
new book is going to come out with a
book on leadership

4258
01:24:33,110 --> 01:24:33,120
book on leadership
 

4259
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:36,870
book on leadership
um and don't just describe the leaders

4260
01:24:36,870 --> 01:24:36,880
um and don't just describe the leaders
 

4261
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:39,590
um and don't just describe the leaders
describe then what about them were the

4262
01:24:39,590 --> 01:24:39,600
describe then what about them were the
 

4263
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:42,470
describe then what about them were the
essential elements to make a good leader

4264
01:24:42,470 --> 01:24:42,480
essential elements to make a good leader
 

4265
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:45,030
essential elements to make a good leader
under what circumstances and so if we

4266
01:24:45,030 --> 01:24:45,040
under what circumstances and so if we
 

4267
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:48,470
under what circumstances and so if we
think about that when then also then you

4268
01:24:48,470 --> 01:24:48,480
think about that when then also then you
 

4269
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:51,669
think about that when then also then you
begin to think in a principled way

4270
01:24:51,669 --> 01:24:51,679
begin to think in a principled way
 

4271
01:24:51,679 --> 01:24:53,750
begin to think in a principled way
and then when you start to think in a

4272
01:24:53,750 --> 01:24:53,760
and then when you start to think in a
 

4273
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:56,709
and then when you start to think in a
principle way life becomes

4274
01:24:56,709 --> 01:24:56,719
principle way life becomes
 

4275
01:24:56,719 --> 01:24:58,629
principle way life becomes
it's so much easier to make decisions

4276
01:24:58,629 --> 01:24:58,639
it's so much easier to make decisions
 

4277
01:24:58,639 --> 01:25:01,510
it's so much easier to make decisions
and it's so much less confusing because

4278
01:25:01,510 --> 01:25:01,520
and it's so much less confusing because
 

4279
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:04,550
and it's so much less confusing because
it's like coming up on a species and you

4280
01:25:04,550 --> 01:25:04,560
it's like coming up on a species and you
 

4281
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:08,310
it's like coming up on a species and you
say okay well what species is it not

4282
01:25:08,310 --> 01:25:08,320
say okay well what species is it not
 

4283
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:11,030
say okay well what species is it not
just another it's a thing no what

4284
01:25:11,030 --> 01:25:11,040
just another it's a thing no what
 

4285
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:13,350
just another it's a thing no what
species is it and how do i deal with

4286
01:25:13,350 --> 01:25:13,360
species is it and how do i deal with
 

4287
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:16,470
species is it and how do i deal with
that species effectively and and so

4288
01:25:16,470 --> 01:25:16,480
that species effectively and and so
 

4289
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:18,870
that species effectively and and so
that's what that is and so i encourage

4290
01:25:18,870 --> 01:25:18,880
that's what that is and so i encourage
 

4291
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:21,430
that's what that is and so i encourage
people to write it down i wish anybody

4292
01:25:21,430 --> 01:25:21,440
people to write it down i wish anybody
 

4293
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:23,510
people to write it down i wish anybody
who's successful wrote down their

4294
01:25:23,510 --> 01:25:23,520
who's successful wrote down their
 

4295
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:25,510
who's successful wrote down their
principles or their recipes for making

4296
01:25:25,510 --> 01:25:25,520
principles or their recipes for making
 

4297
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:28,950
principles or their recipes for making
those types of decisions so the events

4298
01:25:28,950 --> 01:25:28,960
those types of decisions so the events
 

4299
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:31,270
those types of decisions so the events
of interest here happens over and over

4300
01:25:31,270 --> 01:25:31,280
of interest here happens over and over
 

4301
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:32,229
of interest here happens over and over
and over

4302
01:25:32,229 --> 01:25:32,239
and over
 

4303
01:25:32,239 --> 01:25:34,149
and over
in similar ways as you're looking for

4304
01:25:34,149 --> 01:25:34,159
in similar ways as you're looking for
 

4305
01:25:34,159 --> 01:25:35,669
in similar ways as you're looking for
the patterns and you're defining the

4306
01:25:35,669 --> 01:25:35,679
the patterns and you're defining the
 

4307
01:25:35,679 --> 01:25:37,510
the patterns and you're defining the
process

4308
01:25:37,510 --> 01:25:37,520
process
 

4309
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:39,270
process
that's right to respond

4310
01:25:39,270 --> 01:25:39,280
that's right to respond
 

4311
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:41,189
that's right to respond
to those patterns and you call that the

4312
01:25:41,189 --> 01:25:41,199
to those patterns and you call that the
 

4313
01:25:41,199 --> 01:25:42,870
to those patterns and you call that the
principles

4314
01:25:42,870 --> 01:25:42,880
principles
 

4315
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:44,229
principles
and

4316
01:25:44,229 --> 01:25:44,239
and
 

4317
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:45,830

01:27:37,199 --> 01:27:40,310
is pain plus reflection equals progress
and so that reflection is important to

4414
01:27:40,310 --> 01:27:40,320
and so that reflection is important to
 

4415
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:42,550
and so that reflection is important to
know yourself know your pulls

4416
01:27:42,550 --> 01:27:42,560
know yourself know your pulls
 

4417
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:45,590
know yourself know your pulls
know your weaknesses and when you also

4418
01:27:45,590 --> 01:27:45,600
know your weaknesses and when you also
 

4419
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:47,510
know your weaknesses and when you also
know your weaknesses and the strengths

4420
01:27:47,510 --> 01:27:47,520
know your weaknesses and the strengths
 

4421
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:50,790
know your weaknesses and the strengths
of other people there are people who um

4422
01:27:50,790 --> 01:27:50,800
of other people there are people who um
 

4423
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:52,709
of other people there are people who um
have strengths where you're weak and you

4424
01:27:52,709 --> 01:27:52,719
have strengths where you're weak and you
 

4425
01:27:52,719 --> 01:27:54,790
have strengths where you're weak and you
have strengths where they're weak and to

4426
01:27:54,790 --> 01:27:54,800
have strengths where they're weak and to
 

4427
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:57,430
have strengths where they're weak and to
be able to work well together is the

4428
01:27:57,430 --> 01:27:57,440
be able to work well together is the
 

4429
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:59,830
be able to work well together is the
most effective way of

4430
01:27:59,830 --> 01:27:59,840
most effective way of
 

4431
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:02,310
most effective way of
achieving uh success

4432
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:02,320
achieving uh success
 

4433
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:04,870
achieving uh success
so yeah it's that journey

4434
01:28:04,870 --> 01:28:04,880
so yeah it's that journey
 

4435
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:07,270
so yeah it's that journey
and there's a life arc and there's a

4436
01:28:07,270 --> 01:28:07,280
and there's a life arc and there's a
 

4437
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:09,590
and there's a life arc and there's a
journey and you want to make it the best

4438
01:28:09,590 --> 01:28:09,600
journey and you want to make it the best
 

4439
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:13,110
journey and you want to make it the best
that you can make it and it has

4440
01:28:13,110 --> 01:28:13,120
that you can make it and it has
 

4441
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:15,910
that you can make it and it has
it's like a video game you know it has

4442
01:28:15,910 --> 01:28:15,920
it's like a video game you know it has
 

4443
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:18,390
it's like a video game you know it has
the challenges and the

4444
01:28:18,390 --> 01:28:18,400
the challenges and the
 

4445
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:21,110
the challenges and the
obstacles and the learning experiences

4446
01:28:21,110 --> 01:28:21,120
obstacles and the learning experiences
 

4447
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:24,229
obstacles and the learning experiences
and the temptations and all of that and

4448
01:28:24,229 --> 01:28:24,239
and the temptations and all of that and
 

4449
01:28:24,239 --> 01:28:26,629
and the temptations and all of that and
the maximizing learning to go where you

4450
01:28:26,629 --> 01:28:26,639
the maximizing learning to go where you
 

4451
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:29,590
the maximizing learning to go where you
want to go to achieve the life you want

4452
01:28:29,590 --> 01:28:29,600
want to go to achieve the life you want
 

4453
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:31,830
want to go to achieve the life you want
is the most important that's kind of

4454
01:28:31,830 --> 01:28:31,840
is the most important that's kind of
 

4455
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:35,110
is the most important that's kind of
maybe a long-winded way of suing it but

4456
01:28:35,110 --> 01:28:35,120
maybe a long-winded way of suing it but
 

4457
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:38,229
maybe a long-winded way of suing it but
to learn i think i'll try to say it

4458
01:28:38,229 --> 01:28:38,239
to learn i think i'll try to say it
 

4459
01:28:38,239 --> 01:28:41,590
to learn i think i'll try to say it
simply there's a five-step process step

4460
01:28:41,590 --> 01:28:41,600
simply there's a five-step process step
 

4461
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:42,629
simply there's a five-step process step
one

4462
01:28:42,629 --> 01:28:42,639
one
 

4463
01:28:42,639 --> 01:28:43,910
one
is

4464
01:28:43,910 --> 01:28:43,920
is
 

4465
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:45,910
is
know your goals

4466
01:28:45,910 --> 01:28:45,920
know your goals
 

4467
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:48,229
know your goals
know what you're going after

4468
01:28:48,229 --> 01:28:48,239
know what you're going after
 

4469
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:50,070
know what you're going after
you could have almost anything you want

4470
01:28:50,070 --> 01:28:50,080
you could have almost anything you want
 

4471
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:52,229
you could have almost anything you want
but you can't have everything you want

4472
01:28:52,229 --> 01:28:52,239
but you can't have everything you want
 

4473
01:28:52,239 --> 01:28:53,990
but you can't have everything you want
and so you have to prioritize and you

4474
01:28:53,990 --> 01:28:54,000
and so you have to prioritize and you
 

4475
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,629
and so you have to prioritize and you
move in that direction on the way to

4476
01:28:56,629 --> 01:28:56,639
move in that direction on the way to
 

4477
01:28:56,639 --> 01:28:58,310
move in that direction on the way to
your goals you're going to encounter

4478
01:28:58,310 --> 01:28:58,320
your goals you're going to encounter
 

4479
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:00,950
your goals you're going to encounter
your problems and your obstacles

4480
01:29:00,950 --> 01:29:00,960
your problems and your obstacles
 

4481
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:04,229
your problems and your obstacles
so identifying step two is understanding

4482
01:29:04,229 --> 01:29:04,239
so identifying step two is understanding
 

4483
01:29:04,239 --> 01:29:05,030
so identifying step two is understanding
your

4484
01:29:05,030 --> 01:29:05,040
your
 

4485
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:06,790
your
problems and your obstacles identify

4486
01:29:06,790 --> 01:29:06,800
problems and your obstacles identify
 

4487
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:07,669
problems and your obstacles identify
them

4488
01:29:07,669 --> 01:29:07,679
them
 

4489
01:29:07,679 --> 01:29:09,110
them
step three

4490
01:29:09,110 --> 01:29:09,120
step three
 

4491
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:11,510
step three
is to diagnose them to get at the root

4492
01:29:11,510 --> 01:29:11,520
is to diagnose them to get at the root
 

4493
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:13,750
is to diagnose them to get at the root
cause of the problem

4494
01:29:13,750 --> 01:29:13,760
cause of the problem
 

4495
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:15,430
cause of the problem
and that could be

4496
01:29:15,430 --> 01:29:15,440
and that could be
 

4497
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:17,270
and that could be
many root causes but it could also be

4498
01:29:17,270 --> 01:29:17,280
many root causes but it could also be
 

4499
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:19,510
many root causes but it could also be
your weaknesses or weaknesses of others

4500
01:29:19,510 --> 01:29:19,520
your weaknesses or weaknesses of others
 

4501
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:22,070
your weaknesses or weaknesses of others
but you have to be objective about them

4502
01:29:22,070 --> 01:29:22,080
but you have to be objective about them
 

4503
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:24,950
but you have to be objective about them
once you diagnose them then you go to

4504
01:29:24,950 --> 01:29:24,960
once you diagnose them then you go to
 

4505
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:28,070
once you diagnose them then you go to
step four which is to design a way to

4506
01:29:28,070 --> 01:29:28,080
step four which is to design a way to
 

4507
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:30,229
step four which is to design a way to
get around them

4508
01:29:30,229 --> 01:29:30,239
get around them
 

4509
01:29:30,239 --> 01:29:31,189
get around them
and

4510
01:29:31,189 --> 01:29:31,199
and
 

4511
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:33,830
and
then after you have that design

4512
01:29:33,830 --> 01:29:33,840
then after you have that design
 

4513
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:36,229
then after you have that design
you implement that design so you have to

4514
01:29:36,229 --> 01:29:36,239
you implement that design so you have to
 

4515
01:29:36,239 --> 01:29:39,430
you implement that design so you have to
follow through and do it and you do that

4516
01:29:39,430 --> 01:29:39,440
follow through and do it and you do that
 

4517
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:42,149
follow through and do it and you do that
and and that will then produce its new

4518
01:29:42,149 --> 01:29:42,159
and and that will then produce its new
 

4519
01:29:42,159 --> 01:29:44,709
and and that will then produce its new
results which should be better results i

4520
01:29:44,709 --> 01:29:44,719
results which should be better results i
 

4521
01:29:44,719 --> 01:29:46,709
results which should be better results i
have i call this kind of the looping

4522
01:29:46,709 --> 01:29:46,719
have i call this kind of the looping
 

4523
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:49,110
have i call this kind of the looping
process it's the evolutionary looping

4524
01:29:49,110 --> 01:29:49,120
process it's the evolutionary looping
 

4525
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:50,149
process it's the evolutionary looping
process

4526
01:29:50,149 --> 01:29:50,159
process
 

4527
01:29:50,159 --> 01:29:51,669
process
and um

4528
01:29:51,669 --> 01:29:51,679
and um
 

4529
01:29:51,679 --> 01:29:53,590
and um
you do you just keep doing that and you

4530
01:29:53,590 --> 01:29:53,600
you do you just keep doing that and you
 

4531
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:55,990
you do you just keep doing that and you
learn over a period of time and you move

4532
01:29:55,990 --> 01:29:56,000
learn over a period of time and you move
 

4533
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,310
learn over a period of time and you move
in the direction that you want

4534
01:29:58,310 --> 01:29:58,320
in the direction that you want
 

4535
01:29:58,320 --> 01:29:59,990
in the direction that you want
last question and you only have one

4536
01:29:59,990 --> 01:30:00,000
last question and you only have one
 

4537
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,470
last question and you only have one
minute to answer it

4538
01:30:02,470 --> 01:30:02,480
minute to answer it
 

4539
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:04,390
minute to answer it
you dedicate the book

4540
01:30:04,390 --> 01:30:04,400
you dedicate the book
 

4541
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:07,110
you dedicate the book
quote to my grandchildren and those of

4542
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:07,120
quote to my grandchildren and those of
 

4543
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:08,550
quote to my grandchildren and those of
their generation

their generation
 

4545
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:09,990
their generation
who will be participants in the

4546
01:30:09,990 --> 01:30:10,000
who will be participants in the
 

4547
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,790
who will be participants in the
continuation of the story

4548
01:30:12,790 --> 01:30:12,800
continuation of the story
 

4549
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:15,590
continuation of the story
may the force of evolution be with you

4550
01:30:15,590 --> 01:30:15,600
may the force of evolution be with you
 

4551
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:17,750
may the force of evolution be with you
so let me ask where is this force of

4552
01:30:17,750 --> 01:30:17,760
so let me ask where is this force of
 

4553
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:20,390
so let me ask where is this force of
evolution taking human civilization

4554
01:30:20,390 --> 01:30:20,400
evolution taking human civilization
 

4555
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:23,590
evolution taking human civilization
and what in this story that evolution is

4556
01:30:23,590 --> 01:30:23,600
and what in this story that evolution is
 

4557
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:24,550
and what in this story that evolution is
writing

4558
01:30:24,550 --> 01:30:24,560
writing
 

4559
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:26,390
writing
gives you hope

4560
01:30:26,390 --> 01:30:26,400
gives you hope
 

4561
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:28,470
gives you hope
evolution isn't

4562
01:30:28,470 --> 01:30:28,480
evolution isn't
 

4563
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:31,270
evolution isn't
a direction toward improvement

4564
01:30:31,270 --> 01:30:31,280
a direction toward improvement
 

4565
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:35,669
a direction toward improvement
um and the greatest force is

4566
01:30:35,669 --> 01:30:35,679
um and the greatest force is
 

4567
01:30:35,679 --> 01:30:40,070
um and the greatest force is
a man's capacity to adapt and invent

4568
01:30:40,070 --> 01:30:40,080
a man's capacity to adapt and invent
 

4569
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:42,870
a man's capacity to adapt and invent
and so you see in the charts in the book

4570
01:30:42,870 --> 01:30:42,880
and so you see in the charts in the book
 

4571
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:46,550
and so you see in the charts in the book
you see that um this upward movement

4572
01:30:46,550 --> 01:30:46,560
you see that um this upward movement
 

4573
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:49,030
you see that um this upward movement
life expectancy

4574
01:30:49,030 --> 01:30:49,040
