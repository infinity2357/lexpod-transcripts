00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:37,910
that allows you to move from micro scale
 

165
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:40,270
that allows you to move from micro scale
to the macro scale all right so the

166
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:40,280
to the macro scale all right so the
 

167
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,090
to the macro scale all right so the
dividers itself I mean it's it's not a

168
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:43,100
dividers itself I mean it's it's not a
 

169
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,200
dividers itself I mean it's it's not a
living organism

170
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:44,210
living organism
 

171
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:48,910
living organism
it's a machine to me it's a machine but

172
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:48,920
it's a machine to me it's a machine but
 

173
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,260
it's a machine to me it's a machine but
it is perfected to the way that it

174
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:52,270
it is perfected to the way that it
 

175
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:55,300
it is perfected to the way that it
essentially has a limited number of

176
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:55,310
essentially has a limited number of
 

177
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,990
essentially has a limited number of
functions it needs to do necessary some

178
00:03:58,990 --> 00:03:59,000
functions it needs to do necessary some
 

179
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,180
functions it needs to do necessary some
functions and essentially has enough

180
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:04,190
functions and essentially has enough
 

181
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,760
functions and essentially has enough
information just to do those functions

182
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:06,770
information just to do those functions
 

183
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:12,620
information just to do those functions
as well as the ability to modify itself

184
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:12,630
as well as the ability to modify itself
 

185
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:16,580
as well as the ability to modify itself
so you know it's it's a machine it's an

186
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:16,590
so you know it's it's a machine it's an
 

187
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,979
so you know it's it's a machine it's an
intelligent machine so yeah look maybe

188
00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:18,989
intelligent machine so yeah look maybe
 

189
00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:21,020
intelligent machine so yeah look maybe
on that point you're in danger of

190
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:21,030
on that point you're in danger of
 

191
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,390
on that point you're in danger of
reducing the power of this thing by

192
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:23,400
reducing the power of this thing by
 

193
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,560
reducing the power of this thing by
calling it a machine right but you now

194
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:27,570
calling it a machine right but you now
 

195
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,060
calling it a machine right but you now
mention that it's also possibly

196
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,070
mention that it's also possibly
 

197
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,790
mention that it's also possibly
intelligent it seems that there's these

198
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:31,800
intelligent it seems that there's these
 

199
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,120
intelligent it seems that there's these
elements of brilliance that a virus has

200
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,130
elements of brilliance that a virus has
 

201
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:41,090
elements of brilliance that a virus has
of intelligence of maximizing so many

202
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:41,100
of intelligence of maximizing so many
 

203
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,100
of intelligence of maximizing so many
things about its behavior in to ensure

204
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:43,110
things about its behavior in to ensure
 

205
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:48,340
things about its behavior in to ensure
its survival and its and its success so

206
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:48,350
its survival and its and its success so
 

207
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:52,250
its survival and its and its success so
do you see it as intelligent so you know

208
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:52,260
do you see it as intelligent so you know
 

209
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,150
do you see it as intelligent so you know
I think the it's a different

210
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:55,160
I think the it's a different
 

211
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,430
I think the it's a different
understanding differently than you know

212
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:58,440
understanding differently than you know
 

213
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,970
understanding differently than you know
I think about you know intelligence over

214
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:01,980
I think about you know intelligence over
 

215
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,850
I think about you know intelligence over
human kind or intelligence of of the of

216
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:04,860
human kind or intelligence of of the of
 

217
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,330
human kind or intelligence of of the of
the you know of the artificial

218
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:08,340
the you know of the artificial
 

219
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,780
the you know of the artificial
intelligence mechanisms

220
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:11,790
intelligence mechanisms
 

221
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:16,510
intelligence mechanisms
I think the intelligence of a virus is

222
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:16,520
I think the intelligence of a virus is
 

223
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,230
I think the intelligence of a virus is
in its simplicity

224
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:20,240
in its simplicity
 

225
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:27,760
in its simplicity
the ability to do so much with so little

226
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:27,770
the ability to do so much with so little
 

227
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:34,850
the ability to do so much with so little
material and information but also I

228
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:34,860
material and information but also I
 

229
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,280
material and information but also I
think it's it's interesting it keeps me

230
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:37,290
think it's it's interesting it keeps me
 

231
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:40,730
think it's it's interesting it keeps me
thinking you know it gives me wondering

232
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:40,740
thinking you know it gives me wondering
 

233
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:45,380
thinking you know it gives me wondering
whether or not it's also the an example

234
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:45,390
whether or not it's also the an example
 

235
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:51,440
whether or not it's also the an example
of the basic swarm intelligence where

236
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:51,450
of the basic swarm intelligence where
 

237
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:55,840
of the basic swarm intelligence where
you know essentially the viruses act as

238
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:55,850
you know essentially the viruses act as
 

239
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:59,840
you know essentially the viruses act as
the whole and extremely efficient in

240
00:05:59,840 --> 00:05:59,850
the whole and extremely efficient in
 

241
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:03,590
the whole and extremely efficient in
that so what do you attribute the

242
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:03,600
that so what do you attribute the
 

243
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,220
that so what do you attribute the
incredible simplicity and the efficiency

244
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:06,230
incredible simplicity and the efficiency
 

245
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:09,950
incredible simplicity and the efficiency
- is it the evolutionary process - maybe

246
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:09,960
- is it the evolutionary process - maybe
 

247
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,650
- is it the evolutionary process - maybe
another way to ask that if you look at

248
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:12,660
another way to ask that if you look at
 

249
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,090
another way to ask that if you look at
the next hundred years

250
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:14,100
the next hundred years
 

251
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,020
the next hundred years
are you more worried about the natural

252
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:17,030
are you more worried about the natural
 

253
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:20,480
are you more worried about the natural
pandemics or the engineered pandemics so

254
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:20,490
pandemics or the engineered pandemics so
 

255
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:23,540
pandemics or the engineered pandemics so
how hard is it to build a virus yes it's

256
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:23,550
how hard is it to build a virus yes it's
 

257
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,679
how hard is it to build a virus yes it's
it's a very very interesting

258
00:06:25,679 --> 00:06:25,689
it's a very very interesting
 

259
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:28,379
it's a very very interesting
question because obviously there is a

260
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:28,389
question because obviously there is a
 

261
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:33,689
question because obviously there is a
lot of conversations about the you know

262
00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:33,699
lot of conversations about the you know
 

263
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:38,269
lot of conversations about the you know
whether we are capable of engineering a

264
00:06:38,269 --> 00:06:38,279
whether we are capable of engineering a
 

265
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:41,879
whether we are capable of engineering a
you know anyone worse the virus

266
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:41,889
you know anyone worse the virus
 

267
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:46,979
you know anyone worse the virus
I personally expect in a mostly

268
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:46,989
I personally expect in a mostly
 

269
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:49,699
I personally expect in a mostly
concerned with the naturally occurring

270
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:49,709
concerned with the naturally occurring
 

271
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:53,699
concerned with the naturally occurring
viruses simply because we keep seeing

272
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:53,709
viruses simply because we keep seeing
 

273
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:56,850
viruses simply because we keep seeing
that we keep seeing new strains of

274
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:56,860
that we keep seeing new strains of
 

275
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:01,079
that we keep seeing new strains of
influenza emerging some of them becoming

276
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:01,089
influenza emerging some of them becoming
 

277
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:03,959
influenza emerging some of them becoming
pandemic we keep seeing new strains of

278
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:03,969
pandemic we keep seeing new strains of
 

279
00:07:03,969 --> 00:07:08,819
pandemic we keep seeing new strains of
coronaviruses emerging this is a natural

280
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:08,829
coronaviruses emerging this is a natural
 

281
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:12,779
coronaviruses emerging this is a natural
process and I think this is why it's so

282
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:12,789
process and I think this is why it's so
 

283
00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:20,309
process and I think this is why it's so
powerful you know if you ask me you know

284
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:20,319
powerful you know if you ask me you know
 

285
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,779
powerful you know if you ask me you know
did I've read papers about scientists

286
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:24,789
did I've read papers about scientists
 

287
00:07:24,789 --> 00:07:30,239
did I've read papers about scientists
trying to study the capacity of the

288
00:07:30,239 --> 00:07:30,249
trying to study the capacity of the
 

289
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:34,709
trying to study the capacity of the
modern you know by technology to alter

290
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:34,719
modern you know by technology to alter
 

291
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:41,609
modern you know by technology to alter
the viruses but I hope that that you

292
00:07:41,609 --> 00:07:41,619
the viruses but I hope that that you
 

293
00:07:41,619 --> 00:07:45,509
the viruses but I hope that that you
know it in it won't be our main concern

294
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:45,519
know it in it won't be our main concern
 

295
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:47,719
know it in it won't be our main concern
in the near future

296
00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:47,729
in the near future
 

297
00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:55,829
in the near future
do you mean by hope well you know if you

298
00:07:55,829 --> 00:07:55,839
do you mean by hope well you know if you
 

299
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:59,429
do you mean by hope well you know if you
look back and look at the history of the

300
00:07:59,429 --> 00:07:59,439
look back and look at the history of the
 

301
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:02,759
look back and look at the history of the
of the most dangerous viruses right so

302
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:02,769
of the most dangerous viruses right so
 

303
00:08:02,769 --> 00:08:05,249
of the most dangerous viruses right so
that's the first thing that comes into

304
00:08:05,249 --> 00:08:05,259
that's the first thing that comes into
 

305
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:12,290
that's the first thing that comes into
mind is a smallpox so right now there is

306
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:12,300
mind is a smallpox so right now there is
 

307
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,559
mind is a smallpox so right now there is
perhaps a handful of places where this

308
00:08:16,559 --> 00:08:16,569
perhaps a handful of places where this
 

309
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:19,129
perhaps a handful of places where this
you know the the strains of this virus

310
00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:19,139
you know the the strains of this virus
 

311
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:23,459
you know the the strains of this virus
are stored right so this is essentially

312
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:23,469
are stored right so this is essentially
 

313
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:27,299
are stored right so this is essentially
the effort of the whole society to limit

314
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:27,309
the effort of the whole society to limit
 

315
00:08:27,309 --> 00:08:32,670
the effort of the whole society to limit
the access to those viruses I mean in a

316
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:32,680
the access to those viruses I mean in a
 

317
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,559
the access to those viruses I mean in a
lab in a controlled environment in order

318
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:34,569
lab in a controlled environment in order
 

319
00:08:34,569 --> 00:08:37,110
lab in a controlled environment in order
to study and then smallpox is one of the

320
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:37,120
to study and then smallpox is one of the
 

321
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,800
to study and then smallpox is one of the
viruses for which

322
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:39,810
viruses for which
 

323
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,810
viruses for which
should be stated there's a vaccine is

324
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:42,820
should be stated there's a vaccine is
 

325
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,060
should be stated there's a vaccine is
developed yes yes and that's you know

326
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:45,070
developed yes yes and that's you know
 

327
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:50,370
developed yes yes and that's you know
it's until seventies it wasn't in my

328
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:50,380
it's until seventies it wasn't in my
 

329
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,500
it's until seventies it wasn't in my
opinion it was perhaps the most

330
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:52,510
opinion it was perhaps the most
 

331
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:56,910
opinion it was perhaps the most
dangerous think that was there is there

332
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:56,920
dangerous think that was there is there
 

333
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,260
dangerous think that was there is there
a very different virus then then the

334
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:01,270
a very different virus then then the
 

335
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:05,280
a very different virus then then the
influenza and coronaviruses it is it is

336
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:05,290
influenza and coronaviruses it is it is
 

337
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:08,720
influenza and coronaviruses it is it is
different in several aspects

338
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:08,730
different in several aspects
 

339
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:12,920
different in several aspects
biologically it's a so-called

340
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:12,930
biologically it's a so-called
 

341
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:17,430
biologically it's a so-called
double-stranded DNA virus but also in

342
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:17,440
double-stranded DNA virus but also in
 

343
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:23,810
double-stranded DNA virus but also in
the way that it is much more contagious

344
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:23,820
the way that it is much more contagious
 

345
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:28,590
the way that it is much more contagious
so they are not for so this is this is

346
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:28,600
so they are not for so this is this is
 

347
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,639
so they are not for so this is this is
the what are not are not is essentially

348
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:32,649
the what are not are not is essentially
 

349
00:09:32,649 --> 00:09:37,470
the what are not are not is essentially
an average number as person infected by

350
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:37,480
an average number as person infected by
 

351
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:42,019
an average number as person infected by
the virus can spread to other people so

352
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:42,029
the virus can spread to other people so
 

353
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:45,360
the virus can spread to other people so
then the average number of people that

354
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:45,370
then the average number of people that
 

355
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:51,660
then the average number of people that
he or she can spread it to and you know

356
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:51,670
he or she can spread it to and you know
 

357
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,389
he or she can spread it to and you know
the there is still some you know

358
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:54,399
the there is still some you know
 

359
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,150
the there is still some you know
discussion about the estimates of the

360
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:57,160
discussion about the estimates of the
 

361
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,530
discussion about the estimates of the
current virus you know the estimations

362
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:01,540
current virus you know the estimations
 

363
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,590
current virus you know the estimations
vary between you know one point five and

364
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:04,600
vary between you know one point five and
 

365
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:10,500
vary between you know one point five and
three in case of smallpox it was five to

366
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:10,510
three in case of smallpox it was five to
 

367
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:15,930
three in case of smallpox it was five to
seven and we're talking about the

368
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:15,940
seven and we're talking about the
 

369
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,269
seven and we're talking about the
exponential growth right so that's

370
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:18,279
exponential growth right so that's
 

371
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:24,060
exponential growth right so that's
that's a very big difference it's not

372
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:24,070
that's a very big difference it's not
 

373
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,250
that's a very big difference it's not
the most contagious one measles for

374
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:26,260
the most contagious one measles for
 

375
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:31,110
the most contagious one measles for
example it's I think 15 and up so so

376
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,120
example it's I think 15 and up so so
 

377
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,970
example it's I think 15 and up so so
it's it's you know but it's definitely

378
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:34,980
it's it's you know but it's definitely
 

379
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:39,930
it's it's you know but it's definitely
definitely more contagious that that the

380
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:39,940
definitely more contagious that that the
 

381
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,790
definitely more contagious that that the
seasonal flu then

382
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:42,800
seasonal flu then
 

383
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,840
seasonal flu then
the current coronavirus were stars for

384
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:46,850
the current coronavirus were stars for
 

385
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:50,590
the current coronavirus were stars for
that matter so what makes a what makes a

386
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:50,600
that matter so what makes a what makes a
 

387
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,139
that matter so what makes a what makes a
virus more contagious or the I'm sure

388
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:53,149
virus more contagious or the I'm sure
 

389
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:54,280
virus more contagious or the I'm sure
there's a lot of variables that come

390
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:54,290
there's a lot of variables that come
 

391
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:57,100
there's a lot of variables that come
into play but is it is it that whole

392
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:57,110
into play but is it is it that whole
 

393
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,920
into play but is it is it that whole
discussion of aerosol and like the size

394
00:10:59,920 --> 00:10:59,930
discussion of aerosol and like the size
 

395
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:02,350
discussion of aerosol and like the size
of droplets if if it's airborne or

396
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:02,360
of droplets if if it's airborne or
 

397
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,670
of droplets if if it's airborne or
there's some other stuff that's more

398
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:03,680
there's some other stuff that's more
 

399
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,650
there's some other stuff that's more
biology centered I mean there are a lot

400
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:05,660
biology centered I mean there are a lot
 

401
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,990
biology centered I mean there are a lot
of components and and there are

402
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:08,000
of components and and there are
 

403
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,600
of components and and there are
biological components that there are

404
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:10,610
biological components that there are
 

405
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:15,040
biological components that there are
also you know social components the

406
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,050
also you know social components the
 

407
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:18,790
also you know social components the
ability of the virus to you know the the

408
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:18,800
ability of the virus to you know the the
 

409
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,070
ability of the virus to you know the the
ways in which the virus is spread is

410
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:21,080
ways in which the virus is spread is
 

411
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,910
ways in which the virus is spread is
definitely one the ability to virus to

412
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:24,920
definitely one the ability to virus to
 

413
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:29,530
definitely one the ability to virus to
stay on the surfaces to survive the

414
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:29,540
stay on the surfaces to survive the
 

415
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:33,699
stay on the surfaces to survive the
ability of the virus to replicate fast

416
00:11:33,699 --> 00:11:33,709
ability of the virus to replicate fast
 

417
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:36,699
ability of the virus to replicate fast
also you know once it's in the cell or

418
00:11:36,699 --> 00:11:36,709
also you know once it's in the cell or
 

419
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:40,410
also you know once it's in the cell or
whatever once it's inside the host and

420
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:40,420
whatever once it's inside the host and
 

421
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,870
whatever once it's inside the host and
interesting enough something that I

422
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:42,880
interesting enough something that I
 

423
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,720
interesting enough something that I
think we didn't pay that much attention

424
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:46,730
think we didn't pay that much attention
 

425
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:52,150
think we didn't pay that much attention
to is the incubation period the were you

426
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:52,160
to is the incubation period the were you
 

427
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,280
to is the incubation period the were you
know hosts are symptomatic and now it

428
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:54,290
know hosts are symptomatic and now it
 

429
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:57,250
know hosts are symptomatic and now it
turns out that another thing that we one

430
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:57,260
turns out that another thing that we one
 

431
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:01,780
turns out that another thing that we one
really needs to take into account the

432
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:01,790
really needs to take into account the
 

433
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,660
really needs to take into account the
percentage of the asymptomatic

434
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:03,670
percentage of the asymptomatic
 

435
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:07,900
percentage of the asymptomatic
population because those people still

436
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:07,910
population because those people still
 

437
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:11,260
population because those people still
shared this virus and still are you know

438
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:11,270
shared this virus and still are you know
 

439
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:14,079
shared this virus and still are you know
they still are contagious as other than

440
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:14,089
they still are contagious as other than
 

441
00:12:14,089 --> 00:12:16,120
they still are contagious as other than
the Iceland study which i think is

442
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:16,130
the Iceland study which i think is
 

443
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,860
the Iceland study which i think is
probably the most impressive size-wise

444
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:17,870
probably the most impressive size-wise
 

445
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:22,870
probably the most impressive size-wise
shows 50 percent asymptomatic this virus

446
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:22,880
shows 50 percent asymptomatic this virus
 

447
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,829
shows 50 percent asymptomatic this virus
I also recently learned the swine flu is

448
00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:28,839
I also recently learned the swine flu is
 

449
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:32,260
I also recently learned the swine flu is
like just a number of people who got

450
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:32,270
like just a number of people who got
 

451
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:36,519
like just a number of people who got
infected was in the billions it was some

452
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:36,529
infected was in the billions it was some
 

453
00:12:36,529 --> 00:12:39,900
infected was in the billions it was some
crazy number it was like it was like

454
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:39,910
crazy number it was like it was like
 

455
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:42,639
crazy number it was like it was like
like 20 percent of poverty percent of

456
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:42,649
like 20 percent of poverty percent of
 

457
00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:44,440
like 20 percent of poverty percent of
population something crazy like that so

458
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:44,450
population something crazy like that so
 

459
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,860
population something crazy like that so
the lucky thing there is the fatality

460
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:46,870
the lucky thing there is the fatality
 

461
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:50,620
the lucky thing there is the fatality
rate is low but the fact that a virus

462
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:50,630
rate is low but the fact that a virus
 

463
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,960
rate is low but the fact that a virus
can just take over an entire population

464
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:52,970
can just take over an entire population
 

465
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:55,050
can just take over an entire population
so quickly

466
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:55,060
so quickly
 

467
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:58,320
so quickly
it's terrifying I think I mean this is

468
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:58,330
it's terrifying I think I mean this is
 

469
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:01,560
it's terrifying I think I mean this is
you know that's perhaps my favorite

470
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:01,570
you know that's perhaps my favorite
 

471
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:05,070
you know that's perhaps my favorite
example of a butterfly effect because

472
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:05,080
example of a butterfly effect because
 

473
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,530
example of a butterfly effect because
it's really I mean it's it's even tinier

474
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:07,540
it's really I mean it's it's even tinier
 

475
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:10,590
it's really I mean it's it's even tinier
they'd then a butterfly and look at you

476
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:10,600
they'd then a butterfly and look at you
 

477
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,330
they'd then a butterfly and look at you
know and with you know if you think

478
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:12,340
know and with you know if you think
 

479
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:16,140
know and with you know if you think
about it right so it used to be in in

480
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:16,150
about it right so it used to be in in
 

481
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:21,690
about it right so it used to be in in
those bad species and perhaps because of

482
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:21,700
those bad species and perhaps because of
 

483
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:26,400
those bad species and perhaps because of
you know a couple of small changes in in

484
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:26,410
you know a couple of small changes in in
 

485
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:29,700
you know a couple of small changes in in
the in the viral genome his first had

486
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:29,710
the in the viral genome his first had
 

487
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:33,180
the in the viral genome his first had
you know become capable of jumping from

488
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:33,190
you know become capable of jumping from
 

489
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:36,300
you know become capable of jumping from
bats to human and then it became capable

490
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:36,310
bats to human and then it became capable
 

491
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,400
bats to human and then it became capable
of jumping from human to human

492
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:38,410
of jumping from human to human
 

493
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:41,040
of jumping from human to human
alright so this is this is I mean it's

494
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,050
alright so this is this is I mean it's
 

495
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,930
alright so this is this is I mean it's
not even the size of a virus it's the

496
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:42,940
not even the size of a virus it's the
 

497
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,620
not even the size of a virus it's the
size of several you know several atoms

498
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:46,630
size of several you know several atoms
 

499
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:51,300
size of several you know several atoms
or says you know few atoms and our

500
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:51,310
or says you know few atoms and our
 

501
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:56,730
or says you know few atoms and our
sudden this change has such a major

502
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:56,740
sudden this change has such a major
 

503
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:00,060
sudden this change has such a major
impact so is that a mutation like on a

504
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:00,070
impact so is that a mutation like on a
 

505
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:03,720
impact so is that a mutation like on a
single virus is that like so if we talk

506
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:03,730
single virus is that like so if we talk
 

507
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:06,120
single virus is that like so if we talk
about those the the flap of a butterfly

508
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:06,130
about those the the flap of a butterfly
 

509
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:09,480
about those the the flap of a butterfly
wing like what's the first flap well I

510
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:09,490
wing like what's the first flap well I
 

511
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:12,060
wing like what's the first flap well I
think this is the the the mutations that

512
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:12,070
think this is the the the mutations that
 

513
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:17,340
think this is the the the mutations that
make that made this virus capable of

514
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:17,350
make that made this virus capable of
 

515
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:21,420
make that made this virus capable of
jumping from bat species to human and of

516
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:21,430
jumping from bat species to human and of
 

517
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:23,100
jumping from bat species to human and of
course there's you know the scientists

518
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:23,110
course there's you know the scientists
 

519
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,990
course there's you know the scientists
are still trying to find I mean they

520
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:25,000
are still trying to find I mean they
 

521
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,270
are still trying to find I mean they
still even trying to find the the who

522
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:27,280
still even trying to find the the who
 

523
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,210
still even trying to find the the who
was the first in fact it is the patient

524
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:30,220
was the first in fact it is the patient
 

525
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,970
was the first in fact it is the patient
zero the first human the first human

526
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:32,980
zero the first human the first human
 

527
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:35,610
zero the first human the first human
infected right I mean the fact that

528
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:35,620
infected right I mean the fact that
 

529
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,610
infected right I mean the fact that
there are corona viruses different

530
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:38,620
there are corona viruses different
 

531
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,370
there are corona viruses different
strains of corona viruses in various bat

532
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:41,380
strains of corona viruses in various bat
 

533
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,090
strains of corona viruses in various bat
species I mean we know that so so we you

534
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:45,100
species I mean we know that so so we you
 

535
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,910
species I mean we know that so so we you
know viola gist absurdum they studied

536
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:47,920
know viola gist absurdum they studied
 

537
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,150
know viola gist absurdum they studied
them they look at their and genomic

538
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:51,160
them they look at their and genomic
 

539
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,070
them they look at their and genomic
sequences they're trying of course to

540
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:53,080
sequences they're trying of course to
 

541
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,190
sequences they're trying of course to
understand what make this virus is to

542
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:56,200
understand what make this virus is to
 

543
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:02,199
understand what make this virus is to
jump from from bats to human there was

544
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:02,209
jump from from bats to human there was
 

545
00:15:02,209 --> 00:15:04,660
jump from from bats to human there was
you know similar to that and in you know

546
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:04,670
you know similar to that and in you know
 

547
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,819
you know similar to that and in you know
in influenza that was I think a few

548
00:15:06,819 --> 00:15:06,829
in influenza that was I think a few
 

549
00:15:06,829 --> 00:15:11,639
in influenza that was I think a few
years ago there was this you know

550
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:11,649
years ago there was this you know
 

551
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:16,119
years ago there was this you know
interesting story where several groups

552
00:15:16,119 --> 00:15:16,129
interesting story where several groups
 

553
00:15:16,129 --> 00:15:19,419
interesting story where several groups
of scientists studying influenza virus

554
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:19,429
of scientists studying influenza virus
 

555
00:15:19,429 --> 00:15:23,139
of scientists studying influenza virus
essentially you know made experiments to

556
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:23,149
essentially you know made experiments to
 

557
00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:26,650
essentially you know made experiments to
show that this virus can jump from one

558
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:26,660
show that this virus can jump from one
 

559
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:31,660
show that this virus can jump from one
species to another you know by changing

560
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:31,670
species to another you know by changing
 

561
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:34,809
species to another you know by changing
I think just a couple of residues and

562
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:34,819
I think just a couple of residues and
 

563
00:15:34,819 --> 00:15:38,169
I think just a couple of residues and
and and of course it was very

564
00:15:38,169 --> 00:15:38,179
and and of course it was very
 

565
00:15:38,179 --> 00:15:40,210
and and of course it was very
controversial I think there was a

566
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:40,220
controversial I think there was a
 

567
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:43,660
controversial I think there was a
moratorium on this study for a while but

568
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:43,670
moratorium on this study for a while but
 

569
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,850
moratorium on this study for a while but
then the study was released it was

570
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:45,860
then the study was released it was
 

571
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:49,359
then the study was released it was
published so that was their moratorium

572
00:15:49,359 --> 00:15:49,369
published so that was their moratorium
 

573
00:15:49,369 --> 00:15:52,059
published so that was their moratorium
is because it shows through engineering

574
00:15:52,059 --> 00:15:52,069
is because it shows through engineering
 

575
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:55,269
is because it shows through engineering
it through modifying it you can make a

576
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:55,279
it through modifying it you can make a
 

577
00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:00,939
it through modifying it you can make a
jump yes yeah I I personally think it is

578
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:00,949
jump yes yeah I I personally think it is
 

579
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:04,150
jump yes yeah I I personally think it is
important to study this I mean we should

580
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:04,160
important to study this I mean we should
 

581
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,900
important to study this I mean we should
be inform to should try to understand as

582
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:07,910
be inform to should try to understand as
 

583
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:11,309
be inform to should try to understand as
much as possible in order to prevent it

584
00:16:11,309 --> 00:16:11,319
much as possible in order to prevent it
 

585
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:14,439
much as possible in order to prevent it
but so then the engineering aspect there

586
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:14,449
but so then the engineering aspect there
 

587
00:16:14,449 --> 00:16:18,400
but so then the engineering aspect there
is can't you then just start searching

588
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:18,410
is can't you then just start searching
 

589
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:19,989
is can't you then just start searching
because there's so many strands of

590
00:16:19,989 --> 00:16:19,999
because there's so many strands of
 

591
00:16:19,999 --> 00:16:21,100
because there's so many strands of
viruses out there

592
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:21,110
viruses out there
 

593
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:23,739
viruses out there
can't you just search for the ones in

594
00:16:23,739 --> 00:16:23,749
can't you just search for the ones in
 

595
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:26,699
can't you just search for the ones in
bats that are the deadliest from the

596
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:26,709
bats that are the deadliest from the
 

597
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:31,059
bats that are the deadliest from the
virologist perspective and then just try

598
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:31,069
virologist perspective and then just try
 

599
00:16:31,069 --> 00:16:34,600
virologist perspective and then just try
to engineer try to see how to but see

600
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:34,610
to engineer try to see how to but see
 

601
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:38,530
to engineer try to see how to but see
that's a there's a nice aspect to it the

602
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:38,540
that's a there's a nice aspect to it the
 

603
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,449
that's a there's a nice aspect to it the
really nice thing about engineering

604
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:40,459
really nice thing about engineering
 

605
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:43,059
really nice thing about engineering
viruses it has the same problems nuclear

606
00:16:43,059 --> 00:16:43,069
viruses it has the same problems nuclear
 

607
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:47,169
viruses it has the same problems nuclear
weapons is it's hard for it to not only

608
00:16:47,169 --> 00:16:47,179
weapons is it's hard for it to not only
 

609
00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:50,109
weapons is it's hard for it to not only
to mutual self-destruction so you can't

610
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:50,119
to mutual self-destruction so you can't
 

611
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:52,150
to mutual self-destruction so you can't
control a virus it can't be used as a

612
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:52,160
control a virus it can't be used as a
 

613
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,150
control a virus it can't be used as a
weapon right yeah that's why I you know

614
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:55,160
weapon right yeah that's why I you know
 

615
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,249
weapon right yeah that's why I you know
in the beginning I said you know I I'm

616
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:57,259
in the beginning I said you know I I'm
 

617
00:16:57,259 --> 00:17:00,429
in the beginning I said you know I I'm
hopeful because that definitely the

618
00:17:00,429 --> 00:17:00,439
hopeful because that definitely the
 

619
00:17:00,439 --> 00:17:03,819
hopeful because that definitely the
definitely regulations to be needed to

620
00:17:03,819 --> 00:17:03,829
definitely regulations to be needed to
 

621
00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:08,159
definitely regulations to be needed to
be introduced and I mean as the

622
00:17:08,159 --> 00:17:08,169
be introduced and I mean as the
 

623
00:17:08,169 --> 00:17:12,129
be introduced and I mean as the
scientific society is we are in charge

624
00:17:12,129 --> 00:17:12,139
scientific society is we are in charge
 

625
00:17:12,139 --> 00:17:12,870
scientific society is we are in charge
of

626
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:12,880
of
 

627
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,760
of
you know making the right actions making

628
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:17,770
you know making the right actions making
 

629
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,630
you know making the right actions making
the right decisions but I think we we

630
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:21,640
the right decisions but I think we we
 

631
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,559
the right decisions but I think we we
will benefit tremendously by

632
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:24,569
will benefit tremendously by
 

633
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:28,740
will benefit tremendously by
understanding the mechanisms by which

634
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:28,750
understanding the mechanisms by which
 

635
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:32,160
understanding the mechanisms by which
the virus can jump by which the virus

636
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:32,170
the virus can jump by which the virus
 

637
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:37,250
the virus can jump by which the virus
can become more you know more more

638
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:37,260
can become more you know more more
 

639
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:42,560
can become more you know more more
dangerous to humans because all this

640
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:42,570
dangerous to humans because all this
 

641
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:46,800
dangerous to humans because all this
answers with you know eventually to to

642
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:46,810
answers with you know eventually to to
 

643
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:48,480
answers with you know eventually to to
designing better vaccines hopefully

644
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:48,490
designing better vaccines hopefully
 

645
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:51,090
designing better vaccines hopefully
Universal vaccines right and that would

646
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:51,100
Universal vaccines right and that would
 

647
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:57,210
Universal vaccines right and that would
be a triumph of the you know science so

648
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:57,220
be a triumph of the you know science so
 

649
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,950
be a triumph of the you know science so
what's the universe of vaccines is that

650
00:17:58,950 --> 00:17:58,960
what's the universe of vaccines is that
 

651
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,530
what's the universe of vaccines is that
something that well how universal is

652
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:01,540
something that well how universal is
 

653
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,080
something that well how universal is
universal well I mean you know so what's

654
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,090
universal well I mean you know so what's
 

655
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,490
universal well I mean you know so what's
the dream I guess because you kind of

656
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:05,500
the dream I guess because you kind of
 

657
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,500
the dream I guess because you kind of
mentioned the dream of this I would be

658
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:07,510
mentioned the dream of this I would be
 

659
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:12,570
mentioned the dream of this I would be
extremely happy if you know we designed

660
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:12,580
extremely happy if you know we designed
 

661
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,390
extremely happy if you know we designed
the vaccine that is able I mean I'll

662
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:15,400
the vaccine that is able I mean I'll
 

663
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,820
the vaccine that is able I mean I'll
give you an example right so so every

664
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:17,830
give you an example right so so every
 

665
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:21,630
give you an example right so so every
year we do a seasonal flu shot the

666
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:21,640
year we do a seasonal flu shot the
 

667
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,330
year we do a seasonal flu shot the
reason we do it is because you know we

668
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:24,340
reason we do it is because you know we
 

669
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,550
reason we do it is because you know we
are in the arms race you know our

670
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:26,560
are in the arms race you know our
 

671
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,850
are in the arms race you know our
vaccines are in the arms race with with

672
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:28,860
vaccines are in the arms race with with
 

673
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:35,150
vaccines are in the arms race with with
constantly changing virus right now if

674
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:35,160
constantly changing virus right now if
 

675
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,290
constantly changing virus right now if
the

676
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:36,300
the
 

677
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,450
the
neck's pandemic influenza pandemic will

678
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:38,460
neck's pandemic influenza pandemic will
 

679
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,390
neck's pandemic influenza pandemic will
a cure most likely this vaccine would

680
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:41,400
a cure most likely this vaccine would
 

681
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,920
a cure most likely this vaccine would
not save us right although it's it's you

682
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:45,930
not save us right although it's it's you
 

683
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:48,680
not save us right although it's it's you
know it's the same virus might be

684
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:48,690
know it's the same virus might be
 

685
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:55,300
know it's the same virus might be
different strain so if we're able to

686
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:55,310
different strain so if we're able to
 

687
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:58,430
different strain so if we're able to
essentially design a vaccine against you

688
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:58,440
essentially design a vaccine against you
 

689
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,700
essentially design a vaccine against you
know influenza A virus no matter what's

690
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:01,710
know influenza A virus no matter what's
 

691
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:06,080
know influenza A virus no matter what's
the strain no matter which species did

692
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:06,090
the strain no matter which species did
 

693
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:08,810
the strain no matter which species did
jump from that would be I think that

694
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:08,820
jump from that would be I think that
 

695
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:12,470
jump from that would be I think that
would be a huge huge progress and

696
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:12,480
would be a huge huge progress and
 

697
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,370
would be a huge huge progress and
advancement

698
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:13,380
advancement
 

699
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,310
advancement
you mentioned the smallpox until the

700
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:16,320
you mentioned the smallpox until the
 

701
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,080
you mentioned the smallpox until the
seventies might have been something that

702
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:18,090
seventies might have been something that
 

703
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,840
seventies might have been something that
he would be worried the most about what

704
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:20,850
he would be worried the most about what
 

705
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:23,420
he would be worried the most about what
about these days well we're sitting here

706
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:23,430
about these days well we're sitting here
 

707
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:27,110
about these days well we're sitting here
in the middle of a cove in nineteen

708
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:27,120
in the middle of a cove in nineteen
 

709
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,500
in the middle of a cove in nineteen
pandemic but these days nevertheless

710
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:30,510
pandemic but these days nevertheless
 

711
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:34,030
pandemic but these days nevertheless
what is your biggest worry virus wise

712
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:34,040
what is your biggest worry virus wise
 

713
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:38,570
what is your biggest worry virus wise
what are you keeping your eye are on it

714
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:38,580
what are you keeping your eye are on it
 

715
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,710
what are you keeping your eye are on it
looks like and you know based on the

716
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:41,720
looks like and you know based on the
 

717
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,860
looks like and you know based on the
past several years of the of the new

718
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:45,870
past several years of the of the new
 

719
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:50,830
past several years of the of the new
viruses emerging I think we're still

720
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:50,840
viruses emerging I think we're still
 

721
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,260
viruses emerging I think we're still
dealing with different types of

722
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:54,270
dealing with different types of
 

723
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:57,740
dealing with different types of
influence I mean so so the eight seven

724
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:57,750
influence I mean so so the eight seven
 

725
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:04,820
influence I mean so so the eight seven
and nine avian flu that was that emerged

726
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:04,830
and nine avian flu that was that emerged
 

727
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:07,690
and nine avian flu that was that emerged
I think a couple of years ago in China I

728
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:07,700
I think a couple of years ago in China I
 

729
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:12,400
I think a couple of years ago in China I
think the the mortality rate was

730
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:12,410
think the the mortality rate was
 

731
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:15,140
think the the mortality rate was
incredible I mean it was you know I

732
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:15,150
incredible I mean it was you know I
 

733
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:17,150
incredible I mean it was you know I
think above thirty percent

734
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:17,160
think above thirty percent
 

735
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,450
think above thirty percent
you know so this is this is fuchsia I

736
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:20,460
you know so this is this is fuchsia I
 

737
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:24,980
you know so this is this is fuchsia I
mean luckily for us this strain was not

738
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:24,990
mean luckily for us this strain was not
 

739
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:28,340
mean luckily for us this strain was not
pandemic alright so it was jumping from

740
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:28,350
pandemic alright so it was jumping from
 

741
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:31,700
pandemic alright so it was jumping from
birds to human but I don't think it it

742
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:31,710
birds to human but I don't think it it
 

743
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,950
birds to human but I don't think it it
it was actually transmittable between

744
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:33,960
it was actually transmittable between
 

745
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,470
it was actually transmittable between
the humans and you know this is actually

746
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:36,480
the humans and you know this is actually
 

747
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,180
the humans and you know this is actually
a very interesting question

748
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:38,190
a very interesting question
 

749
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:42,020
a very interesting question
which scientists tried to understand

750
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:42,030
which scientists tried to understand
 

751
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:44,060
which scientists tried to understand
right so the balance the delicate

752
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:44,070
right so the balance the delicate
 

753
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:46,520
right so the balance the delicate
balance between the virus being very

754
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:46,530
balance between the virus being very
 

755
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:49,609
balance between the virus being very
contagious right so

756
00:20:49,609 --> 00:20:49,619
contagious right so
 

757
00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:52,999
contagious right so
efficient in spreading and virus to be

758
00:20:52,999 --> 00:20:53,009
efficient in spreading and virus to be
 

759
00:20:53,009 --> 00:20:59,100
efficient in spreading and virus to be
very pathogenic you know causing you

760
00:20:59,100 --> 00:20:59,110
very pathogenic you know causing you
 

761
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:03,450
very pathogenic you know causing you
know harms you know and and that's to

762
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:03,460
know harms you know and and that's to
 

763
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:07,950
know harms you know and and that's to
their horse so it looks like that the

764
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:07,960
their horse so it looks like that the
 

765
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,879
their horse so it looks like that the
more pathogenic the viruses the less

766
00:21:11,879 --> 00:21:11,889
more pathogenic the viruses the less
 

767
00:21:11,889 --> 00:21:15,330
more pathogenic the viruses the less
contagious it is is that a property

768
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:15,340
contagious it is is that a property
 

769
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,659
contagious it is is that a property
biology or what is it was I I don't have

770
00:21:18,659 --> 00:21:18,669
biology or what is it was I I don't have
 

771
00:21:18,669 --> 00:21:19,470
biology or what is it was I I don't have
an answer to that

772
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:19,480
an answer to that
 

773
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,690
an answer to that
and III think this is this is still an

774
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:21,700
and III think this is this is still an
 

775
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,299
and III think this is this is still an
open question but you know if you look

776
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:24,309
open question but you know if you look
 

777
00:21:24,309 --> 00:21:27,509
open question but you know if you look
at you know you know with the corona

778
00:21:27,509 --> 00:21:27,519
at you know you know with the corona
 

779
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:29,759
at you know you know with the corona
virus for example if you look at you

780
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:29,769
virus for example if you look at you
 

781
00:21:29,769 --> 00:21:33,590
virus for example if you look at you
know the the deadlier relative Merce

782
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:33,600
know the the deadlier relative Merce
 

783
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:39,049
know the the deadlier relative Merce
Merce was never in a pandemic virus

784
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:39,059
Merce was never in a pandemic virus
 

785
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:43,229
Merce was never in a pandemic virus
right but the you know did again the the

786
00:21:43,229 --> 00:21:43,239
right but the you know did again the the
 

787
00:21:43,239 --> 00:21:46,320
right but the you know did again the the
mortality rate from nurseries far above

788
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:46,330
mortality rate from nurseries far above
 

789
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:48,359
mortality rate from nurseries far above
you know I think twenty or thirty

790
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:48,369
you know I think twenty or thirty
 

791
00:21:48,369 --> 00:21:54,299
you know I think twenty or thirty
percent so so whatever is making this

792
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:54,309
percent so so whatever is making this
 

793
00:21:54,309 --> 00:21:57,779
percent so so whatever is making this
all happen doesn't want us dead because

794
00:21:57,779 --> 00:21:57,789
all happen doesn't want us dead because
 

795
00:21:57,789 --> 00:22:01,529
all happen doesn't want us dead because
it's balancing yeah nicely I mean how do

796
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:01,539
it's balancing yeah nicely I mean how do
 

797
00:22:01,539 --> 00:22:06,479
it's balancing yeah nicely I mean how do
you explain that one not dead yet like

798
00:22:06,479 --> 00:22:06,489
you explain that one not dead yet like
 

799
00:22:06,489 --> 00:22:08,879
you explain that one not dead yet like
because there's so many viruses and

800
00:22:08,879 --> 00:22:08,889
because there's so many viruses and
 

801
00:22:08,889 --> 00:22:11,700
because there's so many viruses and
they're so good at what they do why do

802
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:11,710
they're so good at what they do why do
 

803
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:15,599
they're so good at what they do why do
they keep us alive I mean we will also

804
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:15,609
they keep us alive I mean we will also
 

805
00:22:15,609 --> 00:22:18,629
they keep us alive I mean we will also
have you know a lot of protection right

806
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:18,639
have you know a lot of protection right
 

807
00:22:18,639 --> 00:22:25,639
have you know a lot of protection right
so the immune system and so I mean we do

808
00:22:25,639 --> 00:22:25,649
so the immune system and so I mean we do
 

809
00:22:25,649 --> 00:22:29,909
so the immune system and so I mean we do
have you know ways to to fight against

810
00:22:29,909 --> 00:22:29,919
have you know ways to to fight against
 

811
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,109
have you know ways to to fight against
those viruses and I think with the I now

812
00:22:34,109 --> 00:22:34,119
those viruses and I think with the I now
 

813
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,330
those viruses and I think with the I now
weigh much better equipped right so with

814
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:36,340
weigh much better equipped right so with
 

815
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:39,029
weigh much better equipped right so with
the discoveries of vaccines and you know

816
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:39,039
the discoveries of vaccines and you know
 

817
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,979
the discoveries of vaccines and you know
there are vaccines against the the

818
00:22:42,979 --> 00:22:42,989
there are vaccines against the the
 

819
00:22:42,989 --> 00:22:46,080
there are vaccines against the the
viruses that maybe two hundred years ago

820
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:46,090
viruses that maybe two hundred years ago
 

821
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:50,879
viruses that maybe two hundred years ago
would wipe us out completely but because

822
00:22:50,879 --> 00:22:50,889
would wipe us out completely but because
 

823
00:22:50,889 --> 00:22:53,190
would wipe us out completely but because
of this vaccines we are actually we're

824
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:53,200
of this vaccines we are actually we're
 

825
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,159
of this vaccines we are actually we're
capable of eradicating pretty much fully

826
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:56,169
capable of eradicating pretty much fully
 

827
00:22:56,169 --> 00:22:59,789
capable of eradicating pretty much fully
as is the case with smallpox so if we

828
00:22:59,789 --> 00:22:59,799
as is the case with smallpox so if we
 

829
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:01,710
as is the case with smallpox so if we
could can we go to the basics a little

830
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:01,720
could can we go to the basics a little
 

831
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,470
could can we go to the basics a little
bit of

832
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:02,480
bit of
 

833
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,410
bit of
the biology of the virus how does the

834
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:05,420
the biology of the virus how does the
 

835
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:09,130
the biology of the virus how does the
virus infect the body so I think there

836
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:09,140
virus infect the body so I think there
 

837
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:13,030
virus infect the body so I think there
are some key steps that the virus needs

838
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:13,040
are some key steps that the virus needs
 

839
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,210
are some key steps that the virus needs
to perform and of course the first one

840
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:15,220
to perform and of course the first one
 

841
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:20,020
to perform and of course the first one
the viral particle needs to get attached

842
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,030
the viral particle needs to get attached
 

843
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:23,410
the viral particle needs to get attached
to the host cell in the case of corona

844
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:23,420
to the host cell in the case of corona
 

845
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:27,340
to the host cell in the case of corona
virus there is a lot of evidence that it

846
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:27,350
virus there is a lot of evidence that it
 

847
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:30,270
virus there is a lot of evidence that it
actually interacts in the same way of

848
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:30,280
actually interacts in the same way of
 

849
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:35,350
actually interacts in the same way of
the as the SARS coronavirus so it gets

850
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:35,360
the as the SARS coronavirus so it gets
 

851
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,940
the as the SARS coronavirus so it gets
attached to a c2 human receptor and so

852
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:39,950
attached to a c2 human receptor and so
 

853
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:42,850
attached to a c2 human receptor and so
there is I mean as we speak there is a

854
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:42,860
there is I mean as we speak there is a
 

855
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:46,260
there is I mean as we speak there is a
growing number of papers suggesting it

856
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:46,270
growing number of papers suggesting it
 

857
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:49,930
growing number of papers suggesting it
moreover a most recent I think most

858
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:49,940
moreover a most recent I think most
 

859
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:53,850
moreover a most recent I think most
recent results suggest that this virus

860
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:53,860
recent results suggest that this virus
 

861
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:57,490
recent results suggest that this virus
attaches more efficiently to this human

862
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:57,500
attaches more efficiently to this human
 

863
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:02,010
attaches more efficiently to this human
receptor then SARS just a sore back off

864
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:02,020
receptor then SARS just a sore back off
 

865
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:05,800
receptor then SARS just a sore back off
so there is a family viruses the corona

866
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:05,810
so there is a family viruses the corona
 

867
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:08,830
so there is a family viruses the corona
viruses and SARS whatever the heck for

868
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:08,840
viruses and SARS whatever the heck for
 

869
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,940
viruses and SARS whatever the heck for
that respite or wherever that stands for

870
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:11,950
that respite or wherever that stands for
 

871
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:16,060
that respite or wherever that stands for
so SARS actually stands for the disease

872
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:16,070
so SARS actually stands for the disease
 

873
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:18,760
so SARS actually stands for the disease
that you get is the syndrome of acute

874
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:18,770
that you get is the syndrome of acute
 

875
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:22,900
that you get is the syndrome of acute
respiratory so SARS is the first strand

876
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:22,910
respiratory so SARS is the first strand
 

877
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:28,210
respiratory so SARS is the first strand
and there's Merce Merce and there is yes

878
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:28,220
and there's Merce Merce and there is yes
 

879
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:31,540
and there's Merce Merce and there is yes
but people scientists actually know more

880
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:31,550
but people scientists actually know more
 

881
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,150
but people scientists actually know more
than three strains I mean so there is

882
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:33,160
than three strains I mean so there is
 

883
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,420
than three strains I mean so there is
the mhv

884
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:36,430
the mhv
 

885
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:40,720
the mhv
strain which is considered to be a

886
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:40,730
strain which is considered to be a
 

887
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:45,670
strain which is considered to be a
canonical model disease model in mice

888
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:45,680
canonical model disease model in mice
 

889
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:49,810
canonical model disease model in mice
and so there is a lot of work done on on

890
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:49,820
and so there is a lot of work done on on
 

891
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:52,810
and so there is a lot of work done on on
this virus because it's but he hasn't

892
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:52,820
this virus because it's but he hasn't
 

893
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:55,750
this virus because it's but he hasn't
jumped to humans yet no no yes it's

894
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:55,760
jumped to humans yet no no yes it's
 

895
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:01,600
jumped to humans yet no no yes it's
fascinating so any mention a c2 so the

896
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:01,610
fascinating so any mention a c2 so the
 

897
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:05,080
fascinating so any mention a c2 so the
when you say attached proteins are

898
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:05,090
when you say attached proteins are
 

899
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:07,720
when you say attached proteins are
involved yeah on both sides yes so so we

900
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:07,730
involved yeah on both sides yes so so we
 

901
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:10,000
involved yeah on both sides yes so so we
have you know so we have this infamous

902
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,010
have you know so we have this infamous
 

903
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:13,750
have you know so we have this infamous
spike protein on the surface of the

904
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:13,760
spike protein on the surface of the
 

905
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,610
spike protein on the surface of the
virion particle and

906
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:15,620
virion particle and
 

907
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,650
virion particle and
does look like a spike and I mean that's

908
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:17,660
does look like a spike and I mean that's
 

909
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:20,590
does look like a spike and I mean that's
essentially because of this protein you

910
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:20,600
essentially because of this protein you
 

911
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,060
essentially because of this protein you
know we called the coronavirus

912
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:22,070
know we called the coronavirus
 

913
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:25,060
know we called the coronavirus
coronavirus so that what makes Corona on

914
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:25,070
coronavirus so that what makes Corona on
 

915
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:29,620
coronavirus so that what makes Corona on
top of the surface so so this via this

916
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:29,630
top of the surface so so this via this
 

917
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:34,510
top of the surface so so this via this
protein it actually it acts so it

918
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:34,520
protein it actually it acts so it
 

919
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,830
protein it actually it acts so it
doesn't act alone it actually it makes a

920
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:37,840
doesn't act alone it actually it makes a
 

921
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,770
doesn't act alone it actually it makes a
three copies and it's it makes so-called

922
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:41,780
three copies and it's it makes so-called
 

923
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,410
three copies and it's it makes so-called
trimer so this trimer is essentially a

924
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:44,420
trimer so this trimer is essentially a
 

925
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,870
trimer so this trimer is essentially a
functional unit a single functional unit

926
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:46,880
functional unit a single functional unit
 

927
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:52,060
functional unit a single functional unit
that in starts interacting with the AC

928
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:52,070
that in starts interacting with the AC
 

929
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:56,140
that in starts interacting with the AC
two receptor so this is again another

930
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:56,150
two receptor so this is again another
 

931
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:58,750
two receptor so this is again another
protein that now sits on the surface of

932
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:58,760
protein that now sits on the surface of
 

933
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:04,500
protein that now sits on the surface of
a human cell host cell I would say and

934
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:04,510
a human cell host cell I would say and
 

935
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:09,120
a human cell host cell I would say and
that's essentially in that way the virus

936
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:09,130
that's essentially in that way the virus
 

937
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:15,010
that's essentially in that way the virus
anchors itself to the host cell because

938
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:15,020
anchors itself to the host cell because
 

939
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,590
anchors itself to the host cell because
then it needs to actually it needs to

940
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:17,600
then it needs to actually it needs to
 

941
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,790
then it needs to actually it needs to
get inside you know it fuses its

942
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:20,800
get inside you know it fuses its
 

943
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,130
get inside you know it fuses its
membrane with the host membrane it

944
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:24,140
membrane with the host membrane it
 

945
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:27,790
membrane with the host membrane it
releases the the key components it

946
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:27,800
releases the the key components it
 

947
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:32,770
releases the the key components it
releases its you know RNA and then

948
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:32,780
releases its you know RNA and then
 

949
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:36,419
releases its you know RNA and then
essentially hijacks the the machinery of

950
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:36,429
essentially hijacks the the machinery of
 

951
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:41,470
essentially hijacks the the machinery of
the cell because none of the viruses

952
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:41,480
the cell because none of the viruses
 

953
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:46,510
the cell because none of the viruses
that we know of have ribosome the the

954
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:46,520
that we know of have ribosome the the
 

955
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,200
that we know of have ribosome the the
machinery that allows us to print out

956
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:49,210
machinery that allows us to print out
 

957
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:52,330
machinery that allows us to print out
proteins so in order to print out

958
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:52,340
proteins so in order to print out
 

959
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,580
proteins so in order to print out
proteins that are necessary for

960
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:54,590
proteins that are necessary for
 

961
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:56,380
proteins that are necessary for
functioning of this virus it actually

962
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:56,390
functioning of this virus it actually
 

963
00:26:56,390 --> 00:27:00,430
functioning of this virus it actually
needs to hijack the host ribosomes the

964
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:00,440
needs to hijack the host ribosomes the
 

965
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,799
needs to hijack the host ribosomes the
virus is an RNA wrapped in a bunch of

966
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:02,809
virus is an RNA wrapped in a bunch of
 

967
00:27:02,809 --> 00:27:05,890
virus is an RNA wrapped in a bunch of
proteins one of which is this functional

968
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:05,900
proteins one of which is this functional
 

969
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,900
proteins one of which is this functional
mechanism with by protein that does the

970
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:07,910
mechanism with by protein that does the
 

971
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:10,960
mechanism with by protein that does the
attachment so yeah so you know so if you

972
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:10,970
attachment so yeah so you know so if you
 

973
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:12,940
attachment so yeah so you know so if you
look at this virus that there are you

974
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:12,950
look at this virus that there are you
 

975
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:15,460
look at this virus that there are you
know several basic components right so

976
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:15,470
know several basic components right so
 

977
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:18,610
know several basic components right so
we start with the Spike protein this is

978
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:18,620
we start with the Spike protein this is
 

979
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,919
we start with the Spike protein this is
not the only surface protein the the

980
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:20,929
not the only surface protein the the
 

981
00:27:20,929 --> 00:27:22,810
not the only surface protein the the
protein that lives on the surface of the

982
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:22,820
protein that lives on the surface of the
 

983
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:28,819
protein that lives on the surface of the
viral particle there is also perhaps the

984
00:27:28,819 --> 00:27:28,829

 

985
00:27:28,829 --> 00:27:31,439

the protein with the highest number of

986
00:27:31,439 --> 00:27:31,449
the protein with the highest number of
 

987
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:34,139
the protein with the highest number of
copies is the membrane protein so it's

988
00:27:34,139 --> 00:27:34,149
copies is the membrane protein so it's
 

989
00:27:34,149 --> 00:27:38,549
copies is the membrane protein so it's
essentially it forms the capsid sorry

990
00:27:38,549 --> 00:27:38,559
essentially it forms the capsid sorry
 

991
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,119
essentially it forms the capsid sorry
the envelope of the protein of the viral

992
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:42,129
the envelope of the protein of the viral
 

993
00:27:42,129 --> 00:27:48,689
the envelope of the protein of the viral
particle and essentially you know helps

994
00:27:48,689 --> 00:27:48,699
particle and essentially you know helps
 

995
00:27:48,699 --> 00:27:52,769
particle and essentially you know helps
to maintain a certain curvature helps to

996
00:27:52,769 --> 00:27:52,779
to maintain a certain curvature helps to
 

997
00:27:52,779 --> 00:27:55,489
to maintain a certain curvature helps to
make a certain curvature then there is a

998
00:27:55,489 --> 00:27:55,499
make a certain curvature then there is a
 

999
00:27:55,499 --> 00:27:59,549
make a certain curvature then there is a
another protein called envelope protein

1000
00:27:59,549 --> 00:27:59,559
another protein called envelope protein
 

1001
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:03,059
another protein called envelope protein
or a protein and it it actually occurs

1002
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:03,069
or a protein and it it actually occurs
 

1003
00:28:03,069 --> 00:28:06,959
or a protein and it it actually occurs
in in far less quantities and still

1004
00:28:06,959 --> 00:28:06,969
in in far less quantities and still
 

1005
00:28:06,969 --> 00:28:10,619
in in far less quantities and still
there is ongoing research what exactly

1006
00:28:10,619 --> 00:28:10,629
there is ongoing research what exactly
 

1007
00:28:10,629 --> 00:28:14,489
there is ongoing research what exactly
does this protein do so these are sort

1008
00:28:14,489 --> 00:28:14,499
does this protein do so these are sort
 

1009
00:28:14,499 --> 00:28:17,459
does this protein do so these are sort
of the three major surface proteins that

1010
00:28:17,459 --> 00:28:17,469
of the three major surface proteins that
 

1011
00:28:17,469 --> 00:28:21,599
of the three major surface proteins that
you know make the divider envelope and

1012
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:21,609
you know make the divider envelope and
 

1013
00:28:21,609 --> 00:28:26,669
you know make the divider envelope and
when we go inside then we have another

1014
00:28:26,669 --> 00:28:26,679
when we go inside then we have another
 

1015
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:28,739
when we go inside then we have another
structural protein called nuclear

1016
00:28:28,739 --> 00:28:28,749
structural protein called nuclear
 

1017
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:31,559
structural protein called nuclear
protein and the the purpose of this

1018
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:31,569
protein and the the purpose of this
 

1019
00:28:31,569 --> 00:28:34,949
protein and the the purpose of this
protein is to protect the viral RNA it

1020
00:28:34,949 --> 00:28:34,959
protein is to protect the viral RNA it
 

1021
00:28:34,959 --> 00:28:37,289
protein is to protect the viral RNA it
actually binds to the viral RNA creates

1022
00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:37,299
actually binds to the viral RNA creates
 

1023
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:41,999
actually binds to the viral RNA creates
a capsid and so the rest of the virus

1024
00:28:41,999 --> 00:28:42,009
a capsid and so the rest of the virus
 

1025
00:28:42,009 --> 00:28:45,209
a capsid and so the rest of the virus
viral information is inside of this you

1026
00:28:45,209 --> 00:28:45,219
viral information is inside of this you
 

1027
00:28:45,219 --> 00:28:52,559
viral information is inside of this you
know RNA and you know if you compare the

1028
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:52,569
know RNA and you know if you compare the
 

1029
00:28:52,569 --> 00:28:55,979
know RNA and you know if you compare the
amount of the genes or you know proteins

1030
00:28:55,979 --> 00:28:55,989
amount of the genes or you know proteins
 

1031
00:28:55,989 --> 00:28:59,279
amount of the genes or you know proteins
that are made of these genes it's much

1032
00:28:59,279 --> 00:28:59,289
that are made of these genes it's much
 

1033
00:28:59,289 --> 00:29:01,259
that are made of these genes it's much
you know it's significantly higher than

1034
00:29:01,259 --> 00:29:01,269
you know it's significantly higher than
 

1035
00:29:01,269 --> 00:29:05,219
you know it's significantly higher than
of influenza virus for example influenza

1036
00:29:05,219 --> 00:29:05,229
of influenza virus for example influenza
 

1037
00:29:05,229 --> 00:29:07,609
of influenza virus for example influenza
virus has I think around eight or nine

1038
00:29:07,609 --> 00:29:07,619
virus has I think around eight or nine
 

1039
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:12,379
virus has I think around eight or nine
proteins where this one has at least 29

1040
00:29:12,379 --> 00:29:12,389
proteins where this one has at least 29
 

1041
00:29:12,389 --> 00:29:13,889
proteins where this one has at least 29
Wow

1042
00:29:13,889 --> 00:29:13,899
Wow
 

1043
00:29:13,899 --> 00:29:15,839
Wow
that has to do with the length of the

1044
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:15,849
that has to do with the length of the
 

1045
00:29:15,849 --> 00:29:18,719
that has to do with the length of the
RNA strand I mean so I mean so it's it

1046
00:29:18,719 --> 00:29:18,729
RNA strand I mean so I mean so it's it
 

1047
00:29:18,729 --> 00:29:21,059
RNA strand I mean so I mean so it's it
it affects the length of the RNA strand

1048
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:21,069
it affects the length of the RNA strand
 

1049
00:29:21,069 --> 00:29:23,369
it affects the length of the RNA strand
right so so so because you essentially

1050
00:29:23,369 --> 00:29:23,379
right so so so because you essentially
 

1051
00:29:23,379 --> 00:29:26,309
right so so so because you essentially
need to have sort of the minimum amount

1052
00:29:26,309 --> 00:29:26,319
need to have sort of the minimum amount
 

1053
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:29,549
need to have sort of the minimum amount
of information to encode those genes how

1054
00:29:29,549 --> 00:29:29,559
of information to encode those genes how
 

1055
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:34,319
of information to encode those genes how
many proteases you say 2909 protease yes

1056
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:34,329
many proteases you say 2909 protease yes
 

1057
00:29:34,329 --> 00:29:37,019
many proteases you say 2909 protease yes
so this is this is you know something

1058
00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:37,029
so this is this is you know something
 

1059
00:29:37,029 --> 00:29:40,619
so this is this is you know something
definitely interesting because you know

1060
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:40,629
definitely interesting because you know
 

1061
00:29:40,629 --> 00:29:41,800
definitely interesting because you know
believe it or not

1062
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:41,810
believe it or not
 

1063
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:44,380
believe it or not
we've been studying you know

1064
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:44,390
we've been studying you know
 

1065
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:47,470
we've been studying you know
coronaviruses for over two decades we've

1066
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:47,480
coronaviruses for over two decades we've
 

1067
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,560
coronaviruses for over two decades we've
yet to uncover all functionalities of

1068
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:50,570
yet to uncover all functionalities of
 

1069
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:53,710
yet to uncover all functionalities of
his proteins could we maybe take a small

1070
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:53,720
his proteins could we maybe take a small
 

1071
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:58,450
his proteins could we maybe take a small
tangent and can you can you say how one

1072
00:29:58,450 --> 00:29:58,460
tangent and can you can you say how one
 

1073
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,250
tangent and can you can you say how one
would try to figure out what a function

1074
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:00,260
would try to figure out what a function
 

1075
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:04,000
would try to figure out what a function
of a particular protein is so you've

1076
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,010
of a particular protein is so you've
 

1077
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,340
of a particular protein is so you've
mentioned people are still trying to

1078
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:06,350
mentioned people are still trying to
 

1079
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:07,990
mentioned people are still trying to
figure out what the function of the

1080
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:08,000
figure out what the function of the
 

1081
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,810
figure out what the function of the
envelope protein might be or what's the

1082
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:10,820
envelope protein might be or what's the
 

1083
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:14,710
envelope protein might be or what's the
process so this is where the research

1084
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:14,720
process so this is where the research
 

1085
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,980
process so this is where the research
that computational scientists do might

1086
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:17,990
that computational scientists do might
 

1087
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:22,450
that computational scientists do might
be of help because you know in the past

1088
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:22,460
be of help because you know in the past
 

1089
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,730
be of help because you know in the past
several decades was that we actually

1090
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:24,740
several decades was that we actually
 

1091
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:27,490
several decades was that we actually
have collected a pretty decent amount of

1092
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:27,500
have collected a pretty decent amount of
 

1093
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:32,020
have collected a pretty decent amount of
knowledge about different proteins in

1094
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:32,030
knowledge about different proteins in
 

1095
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:35,770
knowledge about different proteins in
different viruses so what we can

1096
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:35,780
different viruses so what we can
 

1097
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:38,620
different viruses so what we can
actually try to do and this is sort of

1098
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:38,630
actually try to do and this is sort of
 

1099
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:43,390
actually try to do and this is sort of
could be sort of the our first lead to a

1100
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:43,400
could be sort of the our first lead to a
 

1101
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,120
could be sort of the our first lead to a
possible function is to see whether

1102
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:46,130
possible function is to see whether
 

1103
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:48,970
possible function is to see whether
those you know say we have this genome

1104
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:48,980
those you know say we have this genome
 

1105
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,640
those you know say we have this genome
of the corona virus other of the novel

1106
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:51,650
of the corona virus other of the novel
 

1107
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:52,330
of the corona virus other of the novel
coronavirus

1108
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:52,340
coronavirus
 

1109
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:56,590
coronavirus
and we identify the potential proteins

1110
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:56,600
and we identify the potential proteins
 

1111
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,080
and we identify the potential proteins
then in order to infer the function what

1112
00:30:59,080 --> 00:30:59,090
then in order to infer the function what
 

1113
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:01,830
then in order to infer the function what
we can do can actually see whether those

1114
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:01,840
we can do can actually see whether those
 

1115
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,830
we can do can actually see whether those
proteins are similar to those ones that

1116
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:05,840
proteins are similar to those ones that
 

1117
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,820
proteins are similar to those ones that
we already know okay in such a way we

1118
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:09,830
we already know okay in such a way we
 

1119
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:12,240
we already know okay in such a way we
can you know for example clearly

1120
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:12,250
can you know for example clearly
 

1121
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:15,010
can you know for example clearly
identified you know some critical

1122
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:15,020
identified you know some critical
 

1123
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,680
identified you know some critical
components that RNA polymerase or

1124
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:17,690
components that RNA polymerase or
 

1125
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:19,750
components that RNA polymerase or
different types of proteases these are

1126
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:19,760
different types of proteases these are
 

1127
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:24,670
different types of proteases these are
the proteins that essentially clip the

1128
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:24,680
the proteins that essentially clip the
 

1129
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:30,610
the proteins that essentially clip the
protein sequences and so this works in

1130
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:30,620
protein sequences and so this works in
 

1131
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:33,190
protein sequences and so this works in
many cases however in some cases you

1132
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:33,200
many cases however in some cases you
 

1133
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,980
many cases however in some cases you
have truly novel proteins and this is a

1134
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:37,990
have truly novel proteins and this is a
 

1135
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:42,310
have truly novel proteins and this is a
much more difficult task now as a small

1136
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:42,320
much more difficult task now as a small
 

1137
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,550
much more difficult task now as a small
pause when you say similar like what if

1138
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:45,560
pause when you say similar like what if
 

1139
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,440
pause when you say similar like what if
some parts are different and some parts

1140
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:47,450
some parts are different and some parts
 

1141
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:50,860
some parts are different and some parts
are similar like how do you disentangle

1142
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:50,870
are similar like how do you disentangle
 

1143
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:51,720
are similar like how do you disentangle
that

1144
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:51,730
that
 

1145
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:53,850
that
you know it's it's a big question of

1146
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:53,860
you know it's it's a big question of
 

1147
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:57,440
you know it's it's a big question of
course you know what by informatics does

1148
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:57,450
course you know what by informatics does
 

1149
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:00,300
course you know what by informatics does
it does predictions right so those

1150
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:00,310
it does predictions right so those
 

1151
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:02,990
it does predictions right so those
predictions and they have to be

1152
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:03,000
predictions and they have to be
 

1153
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,270
predictions and they have to be
validated by experiments functional or

1154
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:06,280
validated by experiments functional or
 

1155
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,390
validated by experiments functional or
structural predictions both I mean we we

1156
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:09,400
structural predictions both I mean we we
 

1157
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,010
structural predictions both I mean we we
do structural predictions with the

1158
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:11,020
do structural predictions with the
 

1159
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,040
do structural predictions with the
functional predictions we do

1160
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:13,050
functional predictions we do
 

1161
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:15,870
functional predictions we do
interactions predictions things you just

1162
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:15,880
interactions predictions things you just
 

1163
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,620
interactions predictions things you just
generate a lot of predictions like

1164
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:18,630
generate a lot of predictions like
 

1165
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:20,670
generate a lot of predictions like
reasonable predictions based on

1166
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:20,680
reasonable predictions based on
 

1167
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,350
reasonable predictions based on
structure and function interaction like

1168
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:22,360
structure and function interaction like
 

1169
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,470
structure and function interaction like
you said and then here you go

1170
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:25,480
you said and then here you go
 

1171
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,800
you said and then here you go
that's the power of bioinformatics is

1172
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:27,810
that's the power of bioinformatics is
 

1173
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:31,620
that's the power of bioinformatics is
data grounded good predictions of what

1174
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:31,630
data grounded good predictions of what
 

1175
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:34,110
data grounded good predictions of what
should happen so we you know in the way

1176
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:34,120
should happen so we you know in the way
 

1177
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:38,820
should happen so we you know in the way
I see it we're helping experimental

1178
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:38,830
I see it we're helping experimental
 

1179
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:41,190
I see it we're helping experimental
scientists to streamline the discovery

1180
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:41,200
scientists to streamline the discovery
 

1181
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,370
scientists to streamline the discovery
process yeah and the experimental

1182
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:44,380
process yeah and the experimental
 

1183
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,770
process yeah and the experimental
scientists is that what a virologist is

1184
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:46,780
scientists is that what a virologist is
 

1185
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:49,200
scientists is that what a virologist is
solely about virology is one of the

1186
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:49,210
solely about virology is one of the
 

1187
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:51,810
solely about virology is one of the
experimental sciences that you know

1188
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:51,820
experimental sciences that you know
 

1189
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:56,280
experimental sciences that you know
focus on viruses they often work with

1190
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:56,290
focus on viruses they often work with
 

1191
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:58,080
focus on viruses they often work with
other experimental scientists for

1192
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,090
other experimental scientists for
 

1193
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:01,830
other experimental scientists for
example the molecular imaging scientists

1194
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:01,840
example the molecular imaging scientists
 

1195
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:06,770
example the molecular imaging scientists
right so the the viruses often can be

1196
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:06,780
right so the the viruses often can be
 

1197
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:09,270
right so the the viruses often can be
viewed and reconstructed through

1198
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:09,280
viewed and reconstructed through
 

1199
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,660
viewed and reconstructed through
electron microscopy techniques so but

1200
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:12,670
electron microscopy techniques so but
 

1201
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:14,400
electron microscopy techniques so but
these are you know specialists that are

1202
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:14,410
these are you know specialists that are
 

1203
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:17,160
these are you know specialists that are
not necessarily by biologists they've

1204
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:17,170
not necessarily by biologists they've
 

1205
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:23,460
not necessarily by biologists they've
worked with small small particles more

1206
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:23,470
worked with small small particles more
 

1207
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:26,070
worked with small small particles more
by whether it's viruses or is it an

1208
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:26,080
by whether it's viruses or is it an
 

1209
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,640
by whether it's viruses or is it an
organelle of a you know of a human cell

1210
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:29,650
organelle of a you know of a human cell
 

1211
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:32,370
organelle of a you know of a human cell
whether it's a you know complex

1212
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:32,380
whether it's a you know complex
 

1213
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:35,010
whether it's a you know complex
molecular machinery so the techniques

1214
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:35,020
molecular machinery so the techniques
 

1215
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:38,780
molecular machinery so the techniques
that are use are very similar in in

1216
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:38,790
that are use are very similar in in
 

1217
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:42,780
that are use are very similar in in
surfing in its in their essence and so

1218
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:42,790
surfing in its in their essence and so
 

1219
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:46,440
surfing in its in their essence and so
yeah so so typically me and in we see it

1220
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:46,450
yeah so so typically me and in we see it
 

1221
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:54,710
yeah so so typically me and in we see it
now the research on you know that is

1222
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:54,720
now the research on you know that is
 

1223
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,720
now the research on you know that is
emerging and that

1224
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:56,730
emerging and that
 

1225
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:59,539
emerging and that
is needed often involves the

1226
00:33:59,539 --> 00:33:59,549
is needed often involves the
 

1227
00:33:59,549 --> 00:34:03,320
is needed often involves the
collaborations between biologists you

1228
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:03,330
collaborations between biologists you
 

1229
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:05,470
collaborations between biologists you
know

pharmaceutical sciences computational
 

1235
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:19,070
pharmaceutical sciences computational
sciences so we have to work together so

1236
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:19,080
sciences so we have to work together so
 

1237
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,169
sciences so we have to work together so
from my perspective is to step back

1238
00:34:21,169 --> 00:34:21,179
from my perspective is to step back
 

1239
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:25,070
from my perspective is to step back
sometimes I look at this stuff it's the

1240
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:25,080
sometimes I look at this stuff it's the
 

1241
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,470
sometimes I look at this stuff it's the
how much we understand about RNA DNA how

1242
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:27,480
how much we understand about RNA DNA how
 

1243
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,790
how much we understand about RNA DNA how
much we understand about protein like

1244
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:28,800
much we understand about protein like
 

1245
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,389
much we understand about protein like
your work the amount of proteins that

1246
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:32,399
your work the amount of proteins that
 

1247
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:36,050
your work the amount of proteins that
you're exploring is it surprising to you

1248
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:36,060
you're exploring is it surprising to you
 

1249
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:39,349
you're exploring is it surprising to you
that we were able we descendants of apes

1250
00:34:39,349 --> 00:34:39,359
that we were able we descendants of apes
 

1251
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,980
that we were able we descendants of apes
were able to figure all of this out like

1252
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:41,990
were able to figure all of this out like
 

1253
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:46,820
were able to figure all of this out like
how so your computer scientists so for

1254
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:46,830
how so your computer scientists so for
 

1255
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:49,310
how so your computer scientists so for
me from computer science perspective I I

me from computer science perspective I I
 

1257
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,080
me from computer science perspective I I
know how to write a Python program

1258
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:51,090
know how to write a Python program
 

1259
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:53,599
know how to write a Python program
things are clear but biology is a giant

1260
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:53,609
things are clear but biology is a giant

00:34:56,899 --> 00:34:56,909
mess it feels like to me from an
 

1263
00:34:56,909 --> 00:35:00,440
mess it feels like to me from an
outsider's perspective is how surprising

1264
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:00,450
outsider's perspective is how surprising
 

1265
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:02,330
outsider's perspective is how surprising
is it amazing is it that we were able to

1266
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:02,340
is it amazing is it that we were able to
 

1267
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:05,030
is it amazing is it that we were able to
figure this stuff out you know if you

1268
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:05,040
figure this stuff out you know if you
 

1269
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,030
figure this stuff out you know if you
look at the you know how computational

1270
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:08,040
look at the you know how computational
 

1271
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,240
look at the you know how computational
science and computer science was

1272
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:11,250
science and computer science was
 

1273
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:13,790
science and computer science was
evolving right I think it was just a

1274
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:13,800
evolving right I think it was just a
 

1275
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,790
evolving right I think it was just a
matter of time that we would approach

1276
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:15,800
matter of time that we would approach
 

1277
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,770
matter of time that we would approach
biology so so we we started from you

1278
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:18,780
biology so so we we started from you
 

1279
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:21,890
biology so so we we started from you
know applications to much more

1280
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:21,900
know applications to much more
 

1281
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:25,900
know applications to much more
fundamental systems physics you know and

1282
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:25,910
fundamental systems physics you know and
 

1283
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:30,859
fundamental systems physics you know and
now we are or you know small chemical

1284
00:35:30,859 --> 00:35:30,869
now we are or you know small chemical
 

1285
00:35:30,869 --> 00:35:34,340
now we are or you know small chemical
compounds right so now we are

1286
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:34,350
compounds right so now we are
 

1287
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:38,440
compounds right so now we are
approaching the more complex biological

1288
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:38,450
approaching the more complex biological
 

1289
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:42,140
approaching the more complex biological
systems and I think it's a natural

1290
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:42,150
systems and I think it's a natural
 

1291
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:46,760
systems and I think it's a natural
evolution of you know of the computer

1292
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:46,770
evolution of you know of the computer
 

1293
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:49,310
evolution of you know of the computer
science of mathematics sure that's the

1294
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:49,320
science of mathematics sure that's the
 

1295
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,620
science of mathematics sure that's the
computer science I just might even in in

1296
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:51,630
computer science I just might even in in
 

1297
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:54,020
computer science I just might even in in
higher level so that to me surprising

1298
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:54,030
higher level so that to me surprising
 

1299
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,849
higher level so that to me surprising
that computer science can offer help in

1300
00:35:55,849 --> 00:35:55,859
that computer science can offer help in
 

1301
00:35:55,859 --> 00:35:58,370
that computer science can offer help in
this messy world but I just mean it's

1302
00:35:58,370 --> 00:35:58,380
this messy world but I just mean it's
 

1303
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:01,520
this messy world but I just mean it's
incredible that the biologists and the

1304
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:01,530
incredible that the biologists and the
 

1305
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:03,349
incredible that the biologists and the
chemists can figure all this out or is

1306
00:36:03,349 --> 00:36:03,359
chemists can figure all this out or is
 

1307
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,010
chemists can figure all this out or is
it you sound ridiculous to you that

1308
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:06,020
it you sound ridiculous to you that
 

1309
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:08,260
it you sound ridiculous to you that
that of course they would it just seems

1310
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:08,270
that of course they would it just seems
 

1311
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:10,240
that of course they would it just seems
like a very complicated set of problems

1312
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:10,250
like a very complicated set of problems
 

1313
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:13,120
like a very complicated set of problems
like the the variety of the kinds of

1314
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:13,130
like the the variety of the kinds of
 

1315
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:14,890
like the the variety of the kinds of
things that could be produced in the

1316
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:14,900
things that could be produced in the
 

1317
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:17,680
things that could be produced in the
body the just just like you said 20 and

1318
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:17,690
body the just just like you said 20 and
 

1319
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:20,410
body the just just like you said 20 and
I approach I mean just getting a hand of

1320
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:20,420
I approach I mean just getting a hand of
 

1321
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:25,090
I approach I mean just getting a hand of
in a hang of it so quickly it just seems

1322
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:25,100
in a hang of it so quickly it just seems
 

1323
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:28,720
in a hang of it so quickly it just seems
impossible to me I agree I mean it's and

1324
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:28,730
impossible to me I agree I mean it's and
 

1325
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:30,940
impossible to me I agree I mean it's and
I have to say we are you know in the

1326
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:30,950
I have to say we are you know in the
 

1327
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:34,170
I have to say we are you know in the
very very beginning of this journey I

1328
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:34,180
very very beginning of this journey I
 

1329
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:38,860
very very beginning of this journey I
mean we we've yet to I mean we've yet to

1330
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:38,870
mean we we've yet to I mean we've yet to
 

1331
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:43,150
mean we we've yet to I mean we've yet to
comprehend not even try to understand

1332
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:43,160
comprehend not even try to understand
 

1333
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:46,060
comprehend not even try to understand
and figure out all the details but we've

1334
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:46,070
and figure out all the details but we've
 

1335
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:50,440
and figure out all the details but we've
yet to comprehend the complexity of the

1336
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:50,450
yet to comprehend the complexity of the
 

1337
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:55,150
yet to comprehend the complexity of the
cell we know that neuroscience is not

1338
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:55,160
cell we know that neuroscience is not
 

1339
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,520
cell we know that neuroscience is not
even at the beginning of understanding

1340
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:57,530
even at the beginning of understanding
 

1341
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:59,490
even at the beginning of understanding
human mind

1342
00:36:59,490 --> 00:36:59,500
human mind
 

1343
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:03,460
human mind
so where's biology said in terms of

1344
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:03,470
so where's biology said in terms of
 

1345
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:06,460
so where's biology said in terms of
understanding the function deeply

1346
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:06,470
understanding the function deeply
 

1347
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:08,410
understanding the function deeply
understanding the function of viruses

1348
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:08,420
understanding the function of viruses
 

1349
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:12,070
understanding the function of viruses
and cells so there sometimes it's easy

1350
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:12,080
and cells so there sometimes it's easy
 

1351
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,470
and cells so there sometimes it's easy
to say when you talk about function what

1352
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:14,480
to say when you talk about function what
 

1353
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,630
to say when you talk about function what
you really refer to it's perhaps not a

1354
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:16,640
you really refer to it's perhaps not a
 

1355
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,950
you really refer to it's perhaps not a
deep understanding but more of a

1356
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:19,960
deep understanding but more of a
 

1357
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,240
deep understanding but more of a
understanding sufficient to be able to

1358
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:22,250
understanding sufficient to be able to
 

1359
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:25,930
understanding sufficient to be able to
mess with it using a antiviral like mess

1360
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:25,940
mess with it using a antiviral like mess
 

1361
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:28,540
mess with it using a antiviral like mess
with it chemically to prevent some of

1362
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:28,550
with it chemically to prevent some of
 

1363
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:30,760
with it chemically to prevent some of
its function or do you understand the

1364
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:30,770
its function or do you understand the
 

1365
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:33,070
its function or do you understand the
function well I think equally I think

1366
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:33,080
function well I think equally I think
 

1367
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,050
function well I think equally I think
we're much farther in terms of

1368
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:35,060
we're much farther in terms of
 

1369
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:38,650
we're much farther in terms of
understanding of the complex genetic

1370
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:38,660
understanding of the complex genetic
 

1371
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:41,320
understanding of the complex genetic
disorders such as cancer where you have

1372
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:41,330
disorders such as cancer where you have
 

1373
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:43,450
disorders such as cancer where you have
layers of complexity and we you know as

1374
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:43,460
layers of complexity and we you know as
 

1375
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:46,330
layers of complexity and we you know as
in my laboratory we're trying to

1376
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:46,340
in my laboratory we're trying to
 

1377
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,010
in my laboratory we're trying to
contribute to that research but we're

1378
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:48,020
contribute to that research but we're
 

1379
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:50,890
contribute to that research but we're
also in a way overwhelmed with how many

1380
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:50,900
also in a way overwhelmed with how many
 

1381
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,910
also in a way overwhelmed with how many
different layers of complexity different

1382
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:53,920
different layers of complexity different
 

1383
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,940
different layers of complexity different
layers of mechanisms that can be

1384
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:57,950
layers of mechanisms that can be
 

1385
00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:02,820
layers of mechanisms that can be
hijacked by cancer simultaneously and so

1386
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:02,830
hijacked by cancer simultaneously and so
 

1387
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:07,390
hijacked by cancer simultaneously and so
you know I think biology in the past 20

1388
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:07,400
you know I think biology in the past 20
 

1389
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,290
you know I think biology in the past 20
years again from the perspective of the

1390
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:10,300
years again from the perspective of the
 

1391
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:13,720
years again from the perspective of the
outsider because I'm not a biologist but

1392
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:13,730
outsider because I'm not a biologist but
 

1393
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:18,350
outsider because I'm not a biologist but
I think it has advanced tremendously

1394
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:18,360
I think it has advanced tremendously
 

1395
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:22,580
I think it has advanced tremendously
and one thing that we're computational

1396
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:22,590
and one thing that we're computational
 

1397
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:27,410
and one thing that we're computational
scientists and data scientists are now

1398
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:27,420
scientists and data scientists are now
 

1399
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:33,560
scientists and data scientists are now
becoming very very helpful is in the

1400
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:33,570
becoming very very helpful is in the
 

1401
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:36,110
becoming very very helpful is in the
fact it's kind of from the fact that we

1402
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:36,120
fact it's kind of from the fact that we
 

1403
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,630
fact it's kind of from the fact that we
are now able to generate a lot of

1404
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:38,640
are now able to generate a lot of
 

1405
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:44,500
are now able to generate a lot of
information about the cell whether it's

1406
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:44,510
information about the cell whether it's
 

1407
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:46,580
information about the cell whether it's
next-generation sequencing or

1408
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:46,590
next-generation sequencing or
 

1409
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:50,150
next-generation sequencing or
transcriptomics whether it's life

1410
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:50,160
transcriptomics whether it's life
 

1411
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,920
transcriptomics whether it's life
imaging information where it is you know

1412
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:53,930
imaging information where it is you know
 

1413
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:57,950
imaging information where it is you know
complex interactions between proteins or

1414
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:57,960
complex interactions between proteins or
 

1415
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,380
complex interactions between proteins or
between proteins and small molecules

1416
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:00,390
between proteins and small molecules
 

1417
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:04,880
between proteins and small molecules
such as drugs we we are becoming very

1418
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:04,890
such as drugs we we are becoming very
 

1419
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:07,160
such as drugs we we are becoming very
efficient in generating this information

1420
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:07,170
efficient in generating this information
 

1421
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:10,480
efficient in generating this information
and now the next step is to become

1422
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:10,490
and now the next step is to become
 

1423
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:15,620
and now the next step is to become
equally efficient in processing this

1424
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:15,630
equally efficient in processing this
 

1425
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:18,740
equally efficient in processing this
information and extracting the the key

1426
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:18,750
information and extracting the the key
 

1427
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:21,710
information and extracting the the key
knowledge from that they could then be

1428
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:21,720
knowledge from that they could then be
 

1429
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,230
knowledge from that they could then be
validated with the experiment yeah yeah

1430
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:24,240
validated with the experiment yeah yeah
 

1431
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,330
validated with the experiment yeah yeah
so maybe then going all the way back

1432
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:26,340
so maybe then going all the way back
 

1433
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:29,480
so maybe then going all the way back
we're talking you said the first step is

1434
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:29,490
we're talking you said the first step is
 

1435
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:32,360
we're talking you said the first step is
seeing if we can match the new proteins

1436
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:32,370
seeing if we can match the new proteins
 

1437
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,610
seeing if we can match the new proteins
you found in the virus against something

1438
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:34,620
you found in the virus against something
 

1439
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,170
you found in the virus against something
we've seen before to figure out its

1440
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:36,180
we've seen before to figure out its
 

1441
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,870
we've seen before to figure out its
function and then you also mentioned

1442
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:38,880
function and then you also mentioned
 

1443
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,760
function and then you also mentioned
that but there could be cases where it's

1444
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:40,770
that but there could be cases where it's
 

1445
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:43,670
that but there could be cases where it's
a totally new protein is there something

1446
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:43,680
a totally new protein is there something
 

1447
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,740
a totally new protein is there something
biron firm addicts can offer when it's a

1448
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:45,750
biron firm addicts can offer when it's a
 

1449
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:49,640
biron firm addicts can offer when it's a
totally new protein this is where many

1450
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:49,650
totally new protein this is where many
 

1451
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:51,470
totally new protein this is where many
of the methods and you probably are

1452
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:51,480
of the methods and you probably are
 

1453
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,420
of the methods and you probably are
aware of you know the the case of

1454
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:53,430
aware of you know the the case of
 

1455
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:55,300
aware of you know the the case of
machine learning many of these methods

1456
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:55,310
machine learning many of these methods
 

1457
00:39:55,310 --> 00:40:00,800
machine learning many of these methods
rely on the previous knowledge right so

1458
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:00,810
rely on the previous knowledge right so
 

1459
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:04,010
rely on the previous knowledge right so
things that where we try to do from

1460
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:04,020
things that where we try to do from
 

1461
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:08,180
things that where we try to do from
scratch are incredibly difficult you

1462
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:08,190
scratch are incredibly difficult you
 

1463
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,950
scratch are incredibly difficult you
know something that we call a Benicia

1464
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:09,960
know something that we call a Benicia
 

1465
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,350
know something that we call a Benicia
and this is I mean it's not just the

1466
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:12,360
and this is I mean it's not just the
 

1467
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,380
and this is I mean it's not just the
function I mean you know we've yet to

1468
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:14,390
function I mean you know we've yet to
 

1469
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:18,320
function I mean you know we've yet to
have a robust method to predict the

1470
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:18,330
have a robust method to predict the
 

1471
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:20,510
have a robust method to predict the
structures of these proteins in a

1472
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:20,520
structures of these proteins in a
 

1473
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:26,170
structures of these proteins in a
Benicia you know by not using any

1474
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:26,180
Benicia you know by not using any
 

1475
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:29,270
Benicia you know by not using any
templates

1476
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:29,280

 

1477
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,870

of other related proteins so protein is

1478
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:32,880
of other related proteins so protein is
 

1479
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,460
of other related proteins so protein is
a chain of amino acids residues as

1480
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:37,470
a chain of amino acids residues as
 

1481
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:41,900
a chain of amino acids residues as
residues yeah and then however somehow

1482
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:41,910
residues yeah and then however somehow
 

1483
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:44,780
residues yeah and then however somehow
magically maybe you can tell me they

1484
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:44,790
magically maybe you can tell me they
 

1485
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:47,630
magically maybe you can tell me they
seem to fold in incredibly weird and

1486
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:47,640
seem to fold in incredibly weird and
 

1487
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:54,500
seem to fold in incredibly weird and
complicated 3d shapes yes so and that's

1488
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:54,510
complicated 3d shapes yes so and that's
 

1489
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:56,480
complicated 3d shapes yes so and that's
where actually the idea of protein

1490
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:56,490
where actually the idea of protein
 

1491
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:58,280
where actually the idea of protein
folding or just not the idea but the

1492
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:58,290
folding or just not the idea but the
 

1493
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:00,200
folding or just not the idea but the
problem of figuring out how the hell it

1494
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:00,210
problem of figuring out how the hell it
 

1495
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:02,720
problem of figuring out how the hell it
wants up the concept how they fold into

1496
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:02,730
wants up the concept how they fold into
 

1497
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:05,420
wants up the concept how they fold into
those weird shapes comes in so that's

1498
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:05,430
those weird shapes comes in so that's
 

1499
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:09,380
those weird shapes comes in so that's
another side of computational work so

1500
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:09,390
another side of computational work so
 

1501
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:11,240
another side of computational work so
what can you describe what protein

1502
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:11,250
what can you describe what protein
 

1503
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:13,010
what can you describe what protein
folding from the computational side is

1504
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:13,020
folding from the computational side is
 

1505
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,710
folding from the computational side is
and maybe your thoughts on the folding

1506
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:15,720
and maybe your thoughts on the folding
 

1507
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,690
and maybe your thoughts on the folding
at home efforts that a lot of people

1508
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:17,700
at home efforts that a lot of people
 

1509
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:21,260
at home efforts that a lot of people
know they you can use your machine to to

1510
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:21,270
know they you can use your machine to to
 

1511
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,460
know they you can use your machine to to
do protein folding

1512
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:22,470
do protein folding
 

1513
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:24,680
do protein folding
so yeah broad protein folding is you

1514
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:24,690
so yeah broad protein folding is you
 

1515
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,470
so yeah broad protein folding is you
know one of that those 1 million dollar

1516
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:27,480
know one of that those 1 million dollar
 

1517
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:31,820
know one of that those 1 million dollar
price challenges right so the reason for

1518
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:31,830
price challenges right so the reason for
 

1519
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:34,810
price challenges right so the reason for
that is we've yet to understand

1520
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:34,820
that is we've yet to understand
 

1521
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:41,420
that is we've yet to understand
precisely how the protein gets folded so

1522
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:41,430
precisely how the protein gets folded so
 

1523
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:44,090
precisely how the protein gets folded so
efficiently to the point that in many

1524
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:44,100
efficiently to the point that in many
 

1525
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:47,330
efficiently to the point that in many
cases where you you know where you try

1526
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:47,340
cases where you you know where you try
 

1527
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:49,850
cases where you you know where you try
to unfold it due to the high temperature

1528
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:49,860
to unfold it due to the high temperature
 

1529
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:53,120
to unfold it due to the high temperature
it actually folds back into its original

1530
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:53,130
it actually folds back into its original
 

1531
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:56,660
it actually folds back into its original
state right so we know a lot about the

1532
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:56,670
state right so we know a lot about the
 

1533
00:41:56,670 --> 00:42:01,460
state right so we know a lot about the
mechanisms right but put putting those

1534
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:01,470
mechanisms right but put putting those
 

1535
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:06,470
mechanisms right but put putting those
mechanisms together and making sense

1536
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:06,480
mechanisms together and making sense
 

1537
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,520
mechanisms together and making sense
it's a computationally very expensive

1538
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:09,530
it's a computationally very expensive
 

1539
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:14,360
it's a computationally very expensive
task in general the proteins fold can

1540
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:14,370
task in general the proteins fold can
 

1541
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:16,520
task in general the proteins fold can
they fold in arbitrary large number of

1542
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:16,530
they fold in arbitrary large number of
 

1543
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:18,440
they fold in arbitrary large number of
ways it is they usually fold in a very

1544
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:18,450
ways it is they usually fold in a very
 

1545
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:20,480
ways it is they usually fold in a very
small number no it's it's typically I

1546
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:20,490
small number no it's it's typically I
 

1547
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:22,940
small number no it's it's typically I
mean you we tend to think that you know

1548
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:22,950
mean you we tend to think that you know
 

1549
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:25,910
mean you we tend to think that you know
there is a one sort of canonical fold

1550
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:25,920
there is a one sort of canonical fold
 

1551
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,010
there is a one sort of canonical fold
for protein although that there are many

1552
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:28,020
for protein although that there are many
 

1553
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:30,920
for protein although that there are many
cases where the proteins you know upon

1554
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:30,930
cases where the proteins you know upon
 

1555
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:34,130
cases where the proteins you know upon
the stabilization it can be folded into

1556
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:34,140
the stabilization it can be folded into
 

1557
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:36,039
the stabilization it can be folded into
a different conformation

1558
00:42:36,039 --> 00:42:36,049
a different conformation
 

1559
00:42:36,049 --> 00:42:39,069
a different conformation
and this is especially true when you

1560
00:42:39,069 --> 00:42:39,079
and this is especially true when you
 

1561
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:43,419
and this is especially true when you
look at sort of proteins that in that

1562
00:42:43,419 --> 00:42:43,429
look at sort of proteins that in that
 

1563
00:42:43,429 --> 00:42:45,729
look at sort of proteins that in that
include more than one structural unions

1564
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:45,739
include more than one structural unions
 

1565
00:42:45,739 --> 00:42:47,589
include more than one structural unions
so those structural unions we call them

1566
00:42:47,589 --> 00:42:47,599
so those structural unions we call them
 

1567
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:50,199
so those structural unions we call them
protein domains essentially protein

1568
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:50,209
protein domains essentially protein
 

1569
00:42:50,209 --> 00:42:54,849
protein domains essentially protein
domain is a single unit that typically

00:42:54,849 --> 00:42:54,859
domain is a single unit that typically
 

1571
00:42:54,859 --> 00:42:57,579

is evolutionary preserved that typically

1572
00:42:57,579 --> 00:42:57,589
is evolutionary preserved that typically
 

1573
00:42:57,589 --> 00:42:59,439
is evolutionary preserved that typically
carries out the single function and

1574
00:42:59,439 --> 00:42:59,449
carries out the single function and
 

1575
00:42:59,449 --> 00:43:04,229
carries out the single function and
typically has a very distinct fault

1576
00:43:04,229 --> 00:43:04,239
typically has a very distinct fault
 

1577
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:07,269
typically has a very distinct fault
structure 3d structure organization but

1578
00:43:07,269 --> 00:43:07,279
structure 3d structure organization but
 

1579
00:43:07,279 --> 00:43:09,489
structure 3d structure organization but
turns out that if you look at human an

1580
00:43:09,489 --> 00:43:09,499
turns out that if you look at human an

00:43:27,999 --> 00:43:28,009
into the sort of you know next level
 

1589
00:43:28,009 --> 00:43:30,249
into the sort of you know next level
fold right

1590
00:43:30,249 --> 00:43:30,259
fold right
 

1591
00:43:30,259 --> 00:43:33,370
fold right
so within subunit is folding and then

1592
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:33,380
so within subunit is folding and then
 

1593
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:36,969
so within subunit is folding and then
and then they fold into the larger 3d

1594
00:43:36,969 --> 00:43:36,979
and then they fold into the larger 3d
 

1595
00:43:36,979 --> 00:43:40,329
and then they fold into the larger 3d
structure right and and all that there's

1596
00:43:40,329 --> 00:43:40,339
structure right and and all that there's
 

1597
00:43:40,339 --> 00:43:42,189
structure right and and all that there's
some wonder saying the basic mechanisms

1598
00:43:42,189 --> 00:43:42,199
some wonder saying the basic mechanisms
 

1599
00:43:42,199 --> 00:43:44,109
some wonder saying the basic mechanisms
but not to put together to be able to

1600
00:43:44,109 --> 00:43:44,119
but not to put together to be able to
 

1601
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:46,120
but not to put together to be able to
fold it we're still I mean we're still

1602
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:46,130
fold it we're still I mean we're still
 

1603
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:48,179
fold it we're still I mean we're still
struggling I mean we're we're getting

1604
00:43:48,179 --> 00:43:48,189
struggling I mean we're we're getting
 

1605
00:43:48,189 --> 00:43:51,849
struggling I mean we're we're getting
pretty good about folding relatively

1606
00:43:51,849 --> 00:43:51,859
pretty good about folding relatively
 

1607
00:43:51,859 --> 00:43:55,169
pretty good about folding relatively
small proteins up to hundred residues

1608
00:43:55,169 --> 00:43:55,179
small proteins up to hundred residues
 

1609
00:43:55,179 --> 00:43:58,539
small proteins up to hundred residues
which I mean but we're still far away

1610
00:43:58,539 --> 00:43:58,549
which I mean but we're still far away
 

1611
00:43:58,549 --> 00:44:01,839
which I mean but we're still far away
from folding you know larger proteins

1612
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:01,849
from folding you know larger proteins
 

1613
00:44:01,849 --> 00:44:05,049
from folding you know larger proteins
and some of them are notoriously

1614
00:44:05,049 --> 00:44:05,059
and some of them are notoriously
 

1615
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:07,209
and some of them are notoriously
difficult for example transmembrane

1616
00:44:07,209 --> 00:44:07,219
difficult for example transmembrane
 

1617
00:44:07,219 --> 00:44:09,660
difficult for example transmembrane
proteins proteins that that sit in the

1618
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:09,670
proteins proteins that that sit in the
 

1619
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:13,589
proteins proteins that that sit in the
in the membranes of the cell they're

1620
00:44:13,589 --> 00:44:13,599
in the membranes of the cell they're
 

1621
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:16,900
in the membranes of the cell they're
incredibly important but they are

1622
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:16,910
incredibly important but they are
 

1623
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:19,900
incredibly important but they are
incredibly difficult to solve and so

1624
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:19,910
incredibly difficult to solve and so
 

1625
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:22,239
incredibly difficult to solve and so
basically there's a lot of degrees of

1626
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:22,249
basically there's a lot of degrees of
 

1627
00:44:22,249 --> 00:44:24,819
basically there's a lot of degrees of
freedom how it folds and so it's a

1628
00:44:24,819 --> 00:44:24,829
freedom how it folds and so it's a
 

1629
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:26,979
freedom how it folds and so it's a
combinatorial problem or just explodes

1630
00:44:26,979 --> 00:44:26,989
combinatorial problem or just explodes
 

1631
00:44:26,989 --> 00:44:29,380
combinatorial problem or just explodes
there's so many dimensions Hey well it

1632
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:29,390
there's so many dimensions Hey well it
 

1633
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:31,900
there's so many dimensions Hey well it
is a combinatorial problem but it

1634
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:31,910
is a combinatorial problem but it
 

1635
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:34,179
is a combinatorial problem but it
doesn't mean that we cannot approach it

1636
00:44:34,179 --> 00:44:34,189
doesn't mean that we cannot approach it
 

1637
00:44:34,189 --> 00:44:37,660
doesn't mean that we cannot approach it
from the non canal not from the boot for

1638
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:37,670
from the non canal not from the boot for
 

1639
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:42,279
from the non canal not from the boot for
a force approach and so the machine

1640
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:42,289
a force approach and so the machine
 

1641
00:44:42,289 --> 00:44:44,529
a force approach and so the machine
learning approaches you know have been

1642
00:44:44,529 --> 00:44:44,539
learning approaches you know have been
 

1643
00:44:44,539 --> 00:44:48,279
learning approaches you know have been
emerged that try to tackle it so folding

1644
00:44:48,279 --> 00:44:48,289
emerged that try to tackle it so folding
 

1645
00:44:48,289 --> 00:44:49,280
emerged that try to tackle it so folding
at home

1646
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:49,290

I don't know how familiar with it but is

1648
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:52,170
I don't know how familiar with it but is
 

1649
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:54,500
I don't know how familiar with it but is
that used machine learning or is it more

1650
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:54,510
that used machine learning or is it more
 

1651
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:56,599
that used machine learning or is it more
brute force no so folding at home it was

1652
00:44:56,599 --> 00:44:56,609
brute force no so folding at home it was
 

1653
00:44:56,609 --> 00:45:00,020
brute force no so folding at home it was
originally and I remember I was a it was

1654
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:00,030
originally and I remember I was a it was
 

1655
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:03,920
originally and I remember I was a it was
a long time ago I was a postdoc and we

1656
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:03,930
a long time ago I was a postdoc and we
 

1657
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:06,680
a long time ago I was a postdoc and we
we learned about this you know this game

1658
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:06,690
we learned about this you know this game
 

1659
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:09,320
we learned about this you know this game
because it was originally designed as

1660
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:09,330
because it was originally designed as
 

1661
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:14,780
because it was originally designed as
the game and we you know I took a look

1662
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:14,790
the game and we you know I took a look
 

1663
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:16,970
the game and we you know I took a look
at it and it's interesting because it's

1664
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:16,980
at it and it's interesting because it's
 

1665
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,790
at it and it's interesting because it's
it's really you know it's very

1666
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:19,800
it's really you know it's very
 

1667
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:23,930
it's really you know it's very
transparent very intuitive so and from

1668
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:23,940
transparent very intuitive so and from
 

1669
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:26,690
transparent very intuitive so and from
what I heard a via to introduce it to my

1670
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:26,700
what I heard a via to introduce it to my
 

1671
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:29,120
what I heard a via to introduce it to my
son but you know kids are actually

1672
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:29,130
son but you know kids are actually
 

1673
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:31,609
son but you know kids are actually
getting very good at folding the

1674
00:45:31,609 --> 00:45:31,619
getting very good at folding the
 

1675
00:45:31,619 --> 00:45:36,859
getting very good at folding the
proteins and it was you know it came to

1676
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:36,869
proteins and it was you know it came to
 

1677
00:45:36,869 --> 00:45:40,910
proteins and it was you know it came to
me as they as the not as a surprise but

1678
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:40,920
me as they as the not as a surprise but
 

1679
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:45,710
me as they as the not as a surprise but
actually as the sort of manifest of you

1680
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:45,720
actually as the sort of manifest of you
 

1681
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:50,900
actually as the sort of manifest of you
know our capacity to do this kind of to

1682
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:50,910
know our capacity to do this kind of to
 

1683
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:54,820
know our capacity to do this kind of to
solve these kind of problems when a

00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:54,830
solve these kind of problems when a
 

1685
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:59,540

these top journals with the coasters

1688
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:03,180
these top journals with the coasters
 

1689
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:07,790
these top journals with the coasters
been the actual players of this game so

1690
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:07,800
been the actual players of this game so
 

1691
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:12,830
been the actual players of this game so
and what happened is was that they

1692
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:12,840
and what happened is was that they
 

1693
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,530
and what happened is was that they
managed to get better structures than

1694
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:15,540
managed to get better structures than
 

1695
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:20,870
managed to get better structures than
the scientists themselves so so that you

1696
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:20,880
the scientists themselves so so that you
 

1697
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,920
the scientists themselves so so that you
know that was very I mean it was kind of

1698
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:24,930
know that was very I mean it was kind of
 

1699
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:28,870
know that was very I mean it was kind of
profound you know revelation that

1700
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:28,880
profound you know revelation that
 

1701
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,930
profound you know revelation that
problems that are so challenging for a

problems that are so challenging for a
 

1703
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:36,380
problems that are so challenging for a
computational science maybe not that

1704
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:36,390
computational science maybe not that
 

1705
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:38,330
computational science maybe not that
challenging for a human brain well

1706
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:38,340
challenging for a human brain well
 

1707
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:41,000
challenging for a human brain well
that's a really good that's a hopeful

1708
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:41,010
that's a really good that's a hopeful
 

1709
00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:46,550
that's a really good that's a hopeful
message always when there's a the proof

00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:49,980
of existence the existence proof that
 

1713
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:51,980
of existence the existence proof that
it's possible that's really interesting

1714

it's possible that's really interesting
 

1715
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:55,849
it's possible that's really interesting
but the it seems what are the best ways

1716
00:46:55,849 --> 00:46:55,859
but the it seems what are the best ways
 

1717
00:46:55,859 --> 00:46:59,060
but the it seems what are the best ways
to do protein folding now so if you look

1718
00:46:59,060 --> 00:46:59,070
to do protein folding now so if you look
 

1719
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:02,779
to do protein folding now so if you look
at what deep mind does with alpha fall

1720
00:47:02,779 --> 00:47:02,789
at what deep mind does with alpha fall
 

1721
00:47:02,789 --> 00:47:05,239
at what deep mind does with alpha fall
alpha fold yes so they kind of is that's

1722
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:05,249
alpha fold yes so they kind of is that's
 

1723
00:47:05,249 --> 00:47:07,999
alpha fold yes so they kind of is that's
a learning approach what's your sense I

1724
00:47:07,999 --> 00:47:08,009
a learning approach what's your sense I
 

1725
00:47:08,009 --> 00:47:09,799
a learning approach what's your sense I
mean your backgrounds in machine

1726
00:47:09,799 --> 00:47:09,809
mean your backgrounds in machine
 

1727
00:47:09,809 --> 00:47:12,349
mean your backgrounds in machine
learning but is this a learnable problem

1728
00:47:12,349 --> 00:47:12,359
learning but is this a learnable problem
 

1729
00:47:12,359 --> 00:47:15,789
learning but is this a learnable problem
is this still a brute-force away in the

00:47:15,789 --> 00:47:15,799
is this still a brute-force away in the
 

1731
00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:19,789
is this still a brute-force away in the
garry kasparov deep blue days are we in

00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:37,849
olympic game for protein folders called
CASP and it's essentially it's you know

1744
00:47:37,849 --> 00:47:37,859
CASP and it's essentially it's you know
 

1745
00:47:37,859 --> 00:47:41,929
CASP and it's essentially it's you know
it's a competition where different teams

1746
00:47:41,929 --> 00:47:41,939
it's a competition where different teams
 

1747
00:47:41,939 --> 00:47:46,370
it's a competition where different teams
are given exactly the same protein

1748
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:46,380
are given exactly the same protein
 

1749
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:48,859
are given exactly the same protein
sequences and they try to predict their

1750
00:47:48,859 --> 00:47:48,869
sequences and they try to predict their
 

1751
00:47:48,869 --> 00:47:51,409
sequences and they try to predict their
structures right and of course there's

1752
00:47:51,409 --> 00:47:51,419
structures right and of course there's
 

1753
00:47:51,419 --> 00:47:57,019
structures right and of course there's
different sort of subtasks but in the

1754
00:47:57,019 --> 00:47:57,029
different sort of subtasks but in the
 

1755
00:47:57,029 --> 00:47:59,269
different sort of subtasks but in the
recent competition half a fault was

1756
00:47:59,269 --> 00:47:59,279
recent competition half a fault was
 

1757
00:47:59,279 --> 00:48:02,539
recent competition half a fault was
among the top performing teams if not

1758
00:48:02,539 --> 00:48:02,549
among the top performing teams if not
 

1759
00:48:02,549 --> 00:48:06,589
among the top performing teams if not
the top performing team so there is

1760
00:48:06,589 --> 00:48:06,599
the top performing team so there is
 

1761
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:11,079
the top performing team so there is
definitely a benefit from the data that

1762
00:48:11,079 --> 00:48:11,089
definitely a benefit from the data that
 

1763
00:48:11,089 --> 00:48:14,689
definitely a benefit from the data that
had been generated you know in the past

1764
00:48:14,689 --> 00:48:14,699
had been generated you know in the past
 

1765
00:48:14,699 --> 00:48:16,880
had been generated you know in the past
several decades the structural data and

1766
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:16,890
several decades the structural data and
 

1767
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:22,339
several decades the structural data and
certainly you know we are now at the

1768
00:48:22,339 --> 00:48:22,349
certainly you know we are now at the
 

1769
00:48:22,349 --> 00:48:26,419
certainly you know we are now at the
capacity to summarize this data to

1770
00:48:26,419 --> 00:48:26,429
capacity to summarize this data to
 

1771
00:48:26,429 --> 00:48:29,059
capacity to summarize this data to
generalize this data and to use those

1772
00:48:29,059 --> 00:48:29,069
generalize this data and to use those
 

1773
00:48:29,069 --> 00:48:32,349
generalize this data and to use those
principles you know in order to predict

1774
00:48:32,349 --> 00:48:32,359
principles you know in order to predict
 

1775
00:48:32,359 --> 00:48:34,909
principles you know in order to predict
protein structures as one of the really

1776
00:48:34,909 --> 00:48:34,919
protein structures as one of the really
 

1777
00:48:34,919 --> 00:48:37,549
protein structures as one of the really
cool things here is there's maybe you

1778
00:48:37,549 --> 00:48:37,559
cool things here is there's maybe you
 

1779
00:48:37,559 --> 00:48:39,140
cool things here is there's maybe you
can comment on it there seems to be

1780
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:39,150
can comment on it there seems to be
 

1781
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:42,919
can comment on it there seems to be
these open datasets of protein how did

1782
00:48:42,919 --> 00:48:42,929
these open datasets of protein how did
 

1783
00:48:42,929 --> 00:48:45,819
these open datasets of protein how did
that with the protein databank

1784
00:48:45,819 --> 00:48:45,829
that with the protein databank
 

1785
00:48:45,829 --> 00:48:49,489
that with the protein databank
the a protein databank I mean as create

1786
00:48:49,489 --> 00:48:49,499
the a protein databank I mean as create
 

1787
00:48:49,499 --> 00:48:51,709
the a protein databank I mean as create
is this a recent thing for just the

1788
00:48:51,709 --> 00:48:51,719
is this a recent thing for just the
 

1789
00:48:51,719 --> 00:48:54,890
is this a recent thing for just the
corona virus or it's it's been for many

1790
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:54,900
corona virus or it's it's been for many
 

1791
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:57,799
corona virus or it's it's been for many
many years I believe the first protein

1792
00:48:57,799 --> 00:48:57,809
many years I believe the first protein
 

1793
00:48:57,809 --> 00:49:03,159
many years I believe the first protein
databank was designed on flash cards so

1794
00:49:03,159 --> 00:49:03,169
databank was designed on flash cards so
 

1795
00:49:03,169 --> 00:49:08,569
databank was designed on flash cards so
on the so yes it's so this I mean this

1796
00:49:08,569 --> 00:49:08,579
on the so yes it's so this I mean this
 

1797
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:12,949
on the so yes it's so this I mean this
is a great example of the community

1798
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:12,959
is a great example of the community
 

1799
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:14,270
is a great example of the community
efforts

1800
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:14,280
efforts
 

1801
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:17,270
efforts
of everyone contributing cause every

1802
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:17,280
of everyone contributing cause every
 

1803
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:21,380
of everyone contributing cause every
time you solve a protein or a protein

1804
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:21,390
time you solve a protein or a protein
 

1805
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:25,370
time you solve a protein or a protein
complex this is where you submit it and

1806
00:49:25,370 --> 00:49:25,380
complex this is where you submit it and
 

1807
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:30,770
complex this is where you submit it and
you know the scientists get access to it

1808
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:30,780
you know the scientists get access to it
 

1809
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:35,810
you know the scientists get access to it
scientists get to test it and we went

1810
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:35,820
scientists get to test it and we went
 

1811
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:38,800
scientists get to test it and we went
from occasions use this information to

1812
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:38,810
from occasions use this information to
 

1813
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:43,070
from occasions use this information to
you know to make predictions so there's

1814
00:49:43,070 --> 00:49:43,080
you know to make predictions so there's
 

1815
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:46,510
you know to make predictions so there's
no there's no culture like hoarding

1816
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:46,520
no there's no culture like hoarding
 

1817
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:49,790
no there's no culture like hoarding
discoveries here so that's I mean you've

1818
00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:49,800
discoveries here so that's I mean you've
 

1819
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:53,450
discoveries here so that's I mean you've
you've you've released a few or a bunch

1820
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:53,460
you've you've released a few or a bunch
 

1821
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:55,160
you've you've released a few or a bunch
of proteins they were matching its

1822
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:55,170
of proteins they were matching its
 

1823
00:49:55,170 --> 00:49:56,990
of proteins they were matching its
whatever we'll talk about details a

1824
00:49:56,990 --> 00:49:57,000
whatever we'll talk about details a
 

1825
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,650
whatever we'll talk about details a
little bit but it's kind of amazing that

1826
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:00,660
little bit but it's kind of amazing that
 

1827
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:05,300
little bit but it's kind of amazing that
that's the the it's kind of amazing how

1828
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:05,310
that's the the it's kind of amazing how
 

1829
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:08,420
that's the the it's kind of amazing how
open the culture here is it is and I

1830
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:08,430
open the culture here is it is and I
 

1831
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:11,900
open the culture here is it is and I
think this pandemic actually

1832
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:11,910
think this pandemic actually
 

1833
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:16,880
think this pandemic actually
demonstrated the ability of scientific

1834
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:16,890
demonstrated the ability of scientific
 

1835
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:21,800
demonstrated the ability of scientific
community to you know to solve this

1836
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:21,810
community to you know to solve this
 

1837
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:24,440
community to you know to solve this
challenge collaboratively and this is I

1838
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:24,450
challenge collaboratively and this is I
 

1839
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:27,170
challenge collaboratively and this is I
think it if anything it actually moved

1840
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:27,180
think it if anything it actually moved
 

1841
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:31,060
think it if anything it actually moved
us to a brand new level of

1842
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:31,070
us to a brand new level of
 

1843
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:35,000
us to a brand new level of
collaborations of the efficiency in

1844
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:35,010
collaborations of the efficiency in
 

1845
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:36,800
collaborations of the efficiency in
which people establish new

1846
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:36,810
which people establish new
 

1847
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:41,210
which people establish new
collaborations in in which people offer

1848
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:41,220
collaborations in in which people offer
 

1849
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:43,310
collaborations in in which people offer
their help to each other scientists

1850
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:43,320
their help to each other scientists
 

1851
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:44,720
their help to each other scientists
offer their help to each other and

1852
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:44,730
offer their help to each other and
 

1853
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:46,490
offer their help to each other and
publish results to it's very interesting

1854
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:46,500
publish results to it's very interesting
 

1855
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:49,430
publish results to it's very interesting
we're now trying to figure out as a few

1856
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:49,440
we're now trying to figure out as a few
 

1857
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,080
we're now trying to figure out as a few
journals that are trying to sort of do

1858
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:51,090
journals that are trying to sort of do
 

1859
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:54,800
journals that are trying to sort of do
the very accelerated review cycle but so

1860
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:54,810
the very accelerated review cycle but so
 

1861
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:57,320
the very accelerated review cycle but so
many preprints so just hosting a paper

1862
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:57,330
many preprints so just hosting a paper
 

1863
00:50:57,330 --> 00:50:58,130
many preprints so just hosting a paper
going out

1864
00:50:58,130 --> 00:50:58,140
going out
 

1865
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:01,030
going out
I think it's fundamentally changing the

1866
00:51:01,030 --> 00:51:01,040
I think it's fundamentally changing the
 

1867
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:05,270
I think it's fundamentally changing the
the way we think about papers yes I mean

1868
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:05,280
the way we think about papers yes I mean
 

1869
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,000
the way we think about papers yes I mean
the way we think about knowledge now

1870
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:08,010
the way we think about knowledge now
 

1871
00:51:08,010 --> 00:51:11,120
the way we think about knowledge now
let's say no yes because yes I

1872
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:11,130
let's say no yes because yes I
 

1873
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:17,210
let's say no yes because yes I
completely agree I think now it's the

1874
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:17,220
completely agree I think now it's the
 

1875
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:18,210
completely agree I think now it's the
knowledge

1876
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:18,220
knowledge
 

1877
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:22,109
knowledge
is becoming sort of the the core value

1878
00:51:22,109 --> 00:51:22,119
is becoming sort of the the core value
 

1879
00:51:22,119 --> 00:51:25,440
is becoming sort of the the core value
not the paper or the journal where this

1880
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:25,450
not the paper or the journal where this
 

1881
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:28,109
not the paper or the journal where this
knowledge is published and I think this

1882
00:51:28,109 --> 00:51:28,119
knowledge is published and I think this
 

1883
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:31,589
knowledge is published and I think this
is again this is we are living in the in

1884
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:31,599
is again this is we are living in the in
 

1885
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:37,170
is again this is we are living in the in
the times where it becomes really

1886
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:37,180
the times where it becomes really
 

1887
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:40,800
the times where it becomes really
crystallized that the idea that the most

1888
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:40,810
crystallized that the idea that the most
 

1889
00:51:40,810 --> 00:51:43,830
crystallized that the idea that the most
important value is in the knowledge so

1890
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:43,840
important value is in the knowledge so
 

1891
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,540
important value is in the knowledge so
maybe you can comment like what do you

1892
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:45,550
maybe you can comment like what do you
 

1893
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:47,190
maybe you can comment like what do you
think the future of that knowledge

1894
00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:47,200
think the future of that knowledge
 

1895
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,900
think the future of that knowledge
sharing looks like so you have this

1896
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:48,910
sharing looks like so you have this
 

1897
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:50,790
sharing looks like so you have this
paper that will I hope you get a chance

1898
00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:50,800
paper that will I hope you get a chance
 

1899
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,890
paper that will I hope you get a chance
to talk about a little bit but it has

1900
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:52,900
to talk about a little bit but it has
 

1901
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,660
to talk about a little bit but it has
like a really nice abstract and the

1902
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:54,670
like a really nice abstract and the
 

1903
00:51:54,670 --> 00:51:56,880
like a really nice abstract and the
introduction and related like it has all

1904
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:56,890
introduction and related like it has all
 

1905
00:51:56,890 --> 00:51:59,010
introduction and related like it has all
the usual I mean probably took a long

1906
00:51:59,010 --> 00:51:59,020
the usual I mean probably took a long
 

1907
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:03,930
the usual I mean probably took a long
time to put together so but is that

1908
00:52:03,930 --> 00:52:03,940
time to put together so but is that
 

1909
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:07,020
time to put together so but is that
going to remain like you could have

1910
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:07,030
going to remain like you could have
 

1911
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:09,060
going to remain like you could have
communicated a lot of fundamental ideas

1912
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:09,070
communicated a lot of fundamental ideas
 

1913
00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:12,630
communicated a lot of fundamental ideas
here in much shorter amount that's less

1914
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:12,640
here in much shorter amount that's less
 

1915
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,940
here in much shorter amount that's less
traditionally acceptable by the journal

1916
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:14,950
traditionally acceptable by the journal
 

1917
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:19,010
traditionally acceptable by the journal
context so so well you know so the first

1918
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:19,020
context so so well you know so the first
 

1919
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:24,660
context so so well you know so the first
version that we posted not even on a bi

1920
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:24,670
version that we posted not even on a bi
 

1921
00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:27,599
version that we posted not even on a bi
archive because by archive back then it

1922
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:27,609
archive because by archive back then it
 

1923
00:52:27,609 --> 00:52:32,370
archive because by archive back then it
was essentially you know overwhelmed

1924
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:32,380
was essentially you know overwhelmed
 

1925
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:34,770
was essentially you know overwhelmed
with the number of submissions so so our

1926
00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:34,780
with the number of submissions so so our
 

1927
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:38,040
with the number of submissions so so our
submission I think it took five or six

1928
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:38,050
submission I think it took five or six
 

1929
00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:40,980
submission I think it took five or six
days to just for it to be screened and

1930
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:40,990
days to just for it to be screened and
 

1931
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:45,210
days to just for it to be screened and
and and put online so we you know

1932
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:45,220
and and put online so we you know
 

1933
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:48,690
and and put online so we you know
essentially we put the first pre pre n't

1934
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:48,700
essentially we put the first pre pre n't
 

1935
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:52,370
essentially we put the first pre pre n't
on our website and you know it was

1936
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:52,380
on our website and you know it was
 

1937
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:57,510
on our website and you know it was
started getting accessed right away so

1938
00:52:57,510 --> 00:52:57,520
started getting accessed right away so
 

1939
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:00,960
started getting accessed right away so
and and you know so this original

1940
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:00,970
and and you know so this original
 

1941
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:03,990
and and you know so this original
preprint was in a much rougher shape

1942
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:04,000
preprint was in a much rougher shape
 

1943
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,720
preprint was in a much rougher shape
than this paper and but we tried I mean

1944
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:09,730
than this paper and but we tried I mean
 

1945
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:12,900
than this paper and but we tried I mean
we honestly try to be as compact as

1946
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:12,910
we honestly try to be as compact as
 

1947
00:53:12,910 --> 00:53:16,470
we honestly try to be as compact as
possible with you know

1948
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:16,480
possible with you know
 

1949
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:20,250
possible with you know
introducing the the information that is

1950
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:20,260
introducing the the information that is
 

1951
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:24,750
introducing the the information that is
necessary that to explain our you know

1952
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:24,760
necessary that to explain our you know
 

1953
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:28,410
necessary that to explain our you know
our results so maybe you can dive right

1954
00:53:28,410 --> 00:53:28,420
our results so maybe you can dive right
 

1955
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:30,599
our results so maybe you can dive right
in if it's okay sure so it's a paper

1956
00:53:30,599 --> 00:53:30,609
in if it's okay sure so it's a paper
 

1957
00:53:30,609 --> 00:53:32,010
in if it's okay sure so it's a paper
called structured

1958
00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:32,020
called structured
 

1959
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:35,250
called structured
of Tsarskoe how do you even pronounce

1960
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:35,260
of Tsarskoe how do you even pronounce
 

1961
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:40,020
of Tsarskoe how do you even pronounce
our scurvy - Co V - yeah by The Cove it

1962
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:40,030
our scurvy - Co V - yeah by The Cove it
 

1963
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:42,090
our scurvy - Co V - yeah by The Cove it
is such a terrible name but it stuck

1964
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:42,100
is such a terrible name but it stuck
 

1965
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:45,150
is such a terrible name but it stuck
and yes Tsarskoe V - indicates

1966
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:45,160
and yes Tsarskoe V - indicates
 

1967
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:47,880
and yes Tsarskoe V - indicates
evolutionary conserved functional

1968
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:47,890
evolutionary conserved functional
 

1969
00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:51,150
evolutionary conserved functional
regions of viral proteins so this is

1970
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:51,160
regions of viral proteins so this is
 

1971
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:53,340
regions of viral proteins so this is
looking at all kinds of proteins that

1972
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:53,350
looking at all kinds of proteins that
 

1973
00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:56,850
looking at all kinds of proteins that
are part of the this novel coronavirus

1974
00:53:56,850 --> 00:53:56,860
are part of the this novel coronavirus
 

1975
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:59,850
are part of the this novel coronavirus
and how they match up against the

1976
00:53:59,850 --> 00:53:59,860
and how they match up against the
 

1977
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:01,890
and how they match up against the
previous other kinds of corona viruses

1978
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:01,900
previous other kinds of corona viruses
 

1979
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:04,050
previous other kinds of corona viruses
and there's a lot of beautiful figures I

1980
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:04,060
and there's a lot of beautiful figures I
 

1981
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:06,120
and there's a lot of beautiful figures I
was wondering if you could I mean

1982
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:06,130
was wondering if you could I mean
 

1983
00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:07,380
was wondering if you could I mean
there's so many questions I could ask

1984
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:07,390
there's so many questions I could ask
 

1985
00:54:07,390 --> 00:54:10,200
there's so many questions I could ask
her but maybe a tough how do you get

1986
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:10,210
her but maybe a tough how do you get
 

1987
00:54:10,210 --> 00:54:12,270
her but maybe a tough how do you get
started at doing this paper so how do

1988
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:12,280
started at doing this paper so how do
 

1989
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:14,100
started at doing this paper so how do
you start to figure out the 3d structure

1990
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:14,110
you start to figure out the 3d structure
 

1991
00:54:14,110 --> 00:54:17,160
you start to figure out the 3d structure
of a novel virus yes so there is

1992
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:17,170
of a novel virus yes so there is
 

1993
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:21,300
of a novel virus yes so there is
actually a little story behind it and so

1994
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:21,310
actually a little story behind it and so
 

1995
00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:24,320
actually a little story behind it and so
the story actually dated back in

1996
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:24,330
the story actually dated back in
 

1997
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:29,040
the story actually dated back in
September of 2019 and you probably

1998
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:29,050
September of 2019 and you probably
 

1999
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:31,440
September of 2019 and you probably
remember that back then we had another

2000
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:31,450
remember that back then we had another
 

2001
00:54:31,450 --> 00:54:35,550
remember that back then we had another
dangerous virus Triple E virus its

2002
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:35,560
dangerous virus Triple E virus its
 

2003
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:39,980
dangerous virus Triple E virus its
eastern equine encephalitis virus and

2004
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:39,990
eastern equine encephalitis virus and
 

2005
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:43,050
eastern equine encephalitis virus and
can you maybe linger in it I have to

2006
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:43,060
can you maybe linger in it I have to
 

2007
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:46,140
can you maybe linger in it I have to
admit I was sadly completely unaware so

2008
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:46,150
admit I was sadly completely unaware so
 

2009
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:48,750
admit I was sadly completely unaware so
so that was actually a virus outbreak

2010
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:48,760
so that was actually a virus outbreak
 

2011
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:53,070
so that was actually a virus outbreak
that happened in New England only the

2012
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:53,080
that happened in New England only the
 

2013
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:55,500
that happened in New England only the
the danger in this virus was that it

2014
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:55,510
the danger in this virus was that it
 

2015
00:54:55,510 --> 00:55:00,360
the danger in this virus was that it
actually it targeted your brain so so

2016
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:00,370
actually it targeted your brain so so
 

2017
00:55:00,370 --> 00:55:05,450
actually it targeted your brain so so
the word deaths from this virus it was

2018
00:55:05,450 --> 00:55:05,460
the word deaths from this virus it was
 

2019
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:08,940
the word deaths from this virus it was
it was transferred you know transfer the

2020
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:08,950
it was transferred you know transfer the
 

2021
00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:13,520
it was transferred you know transfer the
main vector was mosquitoes and obviously

2022
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:13,530
main vector was mosquitoes and obviously
 

2023
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:16,770
main vector was mosquitoes and obviously
full-time is you know the time where you

2024
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:16,780
full-time is you know the time where you
 

2025
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:20,270
full-time is you know the time where you
have a lot of them in New England and

2026
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:20,280
have a lot of them in New England and
 

2027
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:24,570
have a lot of them in New England and
you know on one hand people realize this

2028
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:24,580
you know on one hand people realize this
 

2029
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:26,160
you know on one hand people realize this
is this is this actually very dangerous

2030
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:26,170
is this is this actually very dangerous
 

2031
00:55:26,170 --> 00:55:29,970
is this is this actually very dangerous
thing so it had an impact on the local

2032
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:29,980
thing so it had an impact on the local
 

2033
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:36,900
thing so it had an impact on the local
economy the schools were closed past six

2034
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:36,910
economy the schools were closed past six
 

2035
00:55:36,910 --> 00:55:39,330
economy the schools were closed past six
o'clock no activities outside for the

2036
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:39,340
o'clock no activities outside for the
 

2037
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:42,230
o'clock no activities outside for the
kids because the kids were suffering

2038
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:42,240
kids because the kids were suffering
 

2039
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:45,260
kids because the kids were suffering
quite tremendously from you know what

2040
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:45,270
quite tremendously from you know what
 

2041
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:48,860
quite tremendously from you know what
infected from this virus and how do I

2042
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:48,870
infected from this virus and how do I
 

2043
00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:52,760
infected from this virus and how do I
not know about this was impacted it was

2044
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:52,770
not know about this was impacted it was
 

2045
00:55:52,770 --> 00:55:55,370
not know about this was impacted it was
in the news I mean it was not impacted

2046
00:55:55,370 --> 00:55:55,380
in the news I mean it was not impacted
 

2047
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:59,080
in the news I mean it was not impacted
to to high degree in in Boston

2048
00:55:59,080 --> 00:55:59,090
to to high degree in in Boston
 

2049
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:02,240
to to high degree in in Boston
necessarily but in the Metro West area

2050
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:02,250
necessarily but in the Metro West area
 

2051
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:05,300
necessarily but in the Metro West area
and actually spread around I think all

2052
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:05,310
and actually spread around I think all
 

2053
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:08,960
and actually spread around I think all
the way to New Hampshire Connecticut and

2054
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:08,970
the way to New Hampshire Connecticut and
 

2055
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:11,150
the way to New Hampshire Connecticut and
you mentioned affecting the brain that's

2056
00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:11,160
you mentioned affecting the brain that's
 

2057
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,410
you mentioned affecting the brain that's
one other comment

2058
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:12,420
one other comment
 

2059
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:15,920
one other comment
we should make so you mentioned a AC two

2060
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:15,930
we should make so you mentioned a AC two
 

2061
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:19,760
we should make so you mentioned a AC two
for the corona virus so these viruses

2062
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:19,770
for the corona virus so these viruses
 

2063
00:56:19,770 --> 00:56:22,960
for the corona virus so these viruses
kind of attach to something in the body

2064
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:22,970
kind of attach to something in the body
 

2065
00:56:22,970 --> 00:56:26,180
kind of attach to something in the body
so it essentially attaches to the to

2066
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:26,190
so it essentially attaches to the to
 

2067
00:56:26,190 --> 00:56:30,470
so it essentially attaches to the to
these proteins in those cells in the

2068
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:30,480
these proteins in those cells in the
 

2069
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,940
these proteins in those cells in the
body where those proteins are expressed

2070
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:31,950
body where those proteins are expressed
 

2071
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:34,940
body where those proteins are expressed
where they actually have them in in

2072
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:34,950
where they actually have them in in
 

2073
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:36,830
where they actually have them in in
abundance so sometimes that could be in

2074
00:56:36,830 --> 00:56:36,840
abundance so sometimes that could be in
 

2075
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:38,930
abundance so sometimes that could be in
the lungs that could be a brain that

2076
00:56:38,930 --> 00:56:38,940
the lungs that could be a brain that
 

2077
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:42,970
the lungs that could be a brain that
could be so I think what they right now

2078
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:42,980
could be so I think what they right now
 

2079
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:47,240
could be so I think what they right now
from what I read they have the

2080
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:47,250
from what I read they have the
 

2081
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:51,530
from what I read they have the
epithelial cells inside in so did the

2082
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:51,540
epithelial cells inside in so did the
 

2083
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:53,360
epithelial cells inside in so did the
cells essentially inside the you know

2084
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:53,370
cells essentially inside the you know
 

2085
00:56:53,370 --> 00:56:56,660
cells essentially inside the you know
the it's the cells that are covering the

2086
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:56,670
the it's the cells that are covering the
 

2087
00:56:56,670 --> 00:57:01,150
the it's the cells that are covering the
surface you know so inside the nasal

2088
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:01,160
surface you know so inside the nasal
 

2089
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:05,960
surface you know so inside the nasal
surfaces the this road the lung cells

2090
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:05,970
surfaces the this road the lung cells
 

2091
00:57:05,970 --> 00:57:09,410
surfaces the this road the lung cells
and I believe liver as a couple of other

2092
00:57:09,410 --> 00:57:09,420
and I believe liver as a couple of other
 

2093
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:11,450
and I believe liver as a couple of other
organs where they are actually

2094
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:11,460
organs where they are actually
 

2095
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:14,300
organs where they are actually
expressing in abundance that's for the

2096
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:14,310
expressing in abundance that's for the
 

2097
00:57:14,310 --> 00:57:17,450
expressing in abundance that's for the
AC tuition for 318 two percenters okay

2098
00:57:17,450 --> 00:57:17,460
AC tuition for 318 two percenters okay
 

2099
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:20,030
AC tuition for 318 two percenters okay
so back back to the story yes in the

2100
00:57:20,030 --> 00:57:20,040
so back back to the story yes in the
 

2101
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:25,160
so back back to the story yes in the
fall so now the these you know the

2102
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:25,170
fall so now the these you know the
 

2103
00:57:25,170 --> 00:57:29,450
fall so now the these you know the
impact of this virus is significant

2104
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:29,460
impact of this virus is significant
 

2105
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:33,710
impact of this virus is significant
however it's a pre local problem to the

2106
00:57:33,710 --> 00:57:33,720
however it's a pre local problem to the
 

2107
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:36,230
however it's a pre local problem to the
point that you know this something that

2108
00:57:36,230 --> 00:57:36,240
point that you know this something that
 

2109
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,710
point that you know this something that
we would call a neglected disease

2110
00:57:38,710 --> 00:57:38,720
we would call a neglected disease
 

2111
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:44,120
we would call a neglected disease
because it's not big enough to make you

2112
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:44,130
because it's not big enough to make you
 

2113
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:48,620
because it's not big enough to make you
know the the drug design companies to

2114
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:48,630
know the the drug design companies to
 

2115
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:52,280
know the the drug design companies to
design a new antiviral or in York seen

2116
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:52,290
design a new antiviral or in York seen
 

2117
00:57:52,290 --> 00:57:57,900
design a new antiviral or in York seen
it's not big enough to generate a lot of

2118
00:57:57,900 --> 00:57:57,910
it's not big enough to generate a lot of
 

2119
00:57:57,910 --> 00:58:02,910
it's not big enough to generate a lot of
grants from the nation of finding

2120
00:58:02,910 --> 00:58:02,920
grants from the nation of finding
 

2121
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:07,589
grants from the nation of finding
agencies so so does it mean we cannot do

2122
00:58:07,589 --> 00:58:07,599
agencies so so does it mean we cannot do
 

2123
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:11,430
agencies so so does it mean we cannot do
anything about it and so what I did is I

2124
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:11,440
anything about it and so what I did is I
 

2125
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:17,579
anything about it and so what I did is I
taught a by informatics class and is in

2126
00:58:17,579 --> 00:58:17,589
taught a by informatics class and is in
 

2127
00:58:17,589 --> 00:58:19,650
taught a by informatics class and is in
Worcester Polytechnic Institute and we

2128
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:19,660
Worcester Polytechnic Institute and we
 

2129
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:25,069
Worcester Polytechnic Institute and we
are very much problem learning

2130
00:58:25,069 --> 00:58:25,079
are very much problem learning
 

2131
00:58:25,079 --> 00:58:28,020
are very much problem learning
institution so I thought that that would

2132
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:28,030
institution so I thought that that would
 

2133
00:58:28,030 --> 00:58:32,579
institution so I thought that that would
be a perfect you know perfect project in

2134
00:58:32,579 --> 00:58:32,589
be a perfect you know perfect project in
 

2135
00:58:32,589 --> 00:58:36,270
be a perfect you know perfect project in
case study so so I asked it you know so

2136
00:58:36,270 --> 00:58:36,280
case study so so I asked it you know so
 

2137
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:39,960
case study so so I asked it you know so
so I we essentially designed a study

2138
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:39,970
so I we essentially designed a study
 

2139
00:58:39,970 --> 00:58:42,260
so I we essentially designed a study
where we tried to use by informatics to

2140
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:42,270
where we tried to use by informatics to
 

2141
00:58:42,270 --> 00:58:45,990
where we tried to use by informatics to
to understand as much as possible about

2142
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:46,000
to understand as much as possible about
 

2143
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,549
to understand as much as possible about
this virus and a very substantial

2144
00:58:50,549 --> 00:58:50,559
this virus and a very substantial
 

2145
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:52,970
this virus and a very substantial
portion of the study was to understand

2146
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:52,980
portion of the study was to understand
 

2147
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:55,859
portion of the study was to understand
the structures of the proteins to

2148
00:58:55,859 --> 00:58:55,869
the structures of the proteins to
 

2149
00:58:55,869 --> 00:58:59,250
the structures of the proteins to
understand how they interact with with

2150
00:58:59,250 --> 00:58:59,260
understand how they interact with with
 

2151
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:02,220
understand how they interact with with
each other and with the with the host

2152
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:02,230
each other and with the with the host
 

2153
00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:05,880
each other and with the with the host
proteins try to understand the evolution

2154
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:05,890
proteins try to understand the evolution
 

2155
00:59:05,890 --> 00:59:07,829
proteins try to understand the evolution
of this virus

2156
00:59:07,829 --> 00:59:07,839
of this virus
 

2157
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:10,500
of this virus
it's obviously you know a very important

2158
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:10,510
it's obviously you know a very important
 

2159
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:13,620
it's obviously you know a very important
question how where it will evolve

2160
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:13,630
question how where it will evolve
 

2161
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:18,380
question how where it will evolve
further how you know how it happened

2162
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:18,390
further how you know how it happened
 

2163
00:59:18,390 --> 00:59:23,640
further how you know how it happened
here you know so so we did all this you

2164
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:23,650
here you know so so we did all this you
 

2165
00:59:23,650 --> 00:59:24,029
here you know so so we did all this you
know

2166
00:59:24,029 --> 00:59:24,039
know
 

2167
00:59:24,039 --> 00:59:26,940
know
projects and now I'm trying to put them

2168
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:26,950
projects and now I'm trying to put them
 

2169
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:29,069
projects and now I'm trying to put them
into a paper where all these

2170
00:59:29,069 --> 00:59:29,079
into a paper where all these
 

2171
00:59:29,079 --> 00:59:31,640
into a paper where all these
undergraduate students will be coasters

2172
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:31,650
undergraduate students will be coasters
 

2173
00:59:31,650 --> 00:59:35,339
undergraduate students will be coasters
but essentially the projects were

2174
00:59:35,339 --> 00:59:35,349
but essentially the projects were
 

2175
00:59:35,349 --> 00:59:39,930
but essentially the projects were
finished right about mid-december and a

2176
00:59:39,930 --> 00:59:39,940
finished right about mid-december and a
 

2177
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:43,980
finished right about mid-december and a
couple of weeks later I heard about this

2178
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:43,990
couple of weeks later I heard about this
 

2179
00:59:43,990 --> 00:59:46,890
couple of weeks later I heard about this
mysterious new virus that was discovered

2180
00:59:46,890 --> 00:59:46,900
mysterious new virus that was discovered
 

2181
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:49,710
mysterious new virus that was discovered
in you know was reported in in Wuhan

2182
00:59:49,710 --> 00:59:49,720
in you know was reported in in Wuhan
 

2183
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:53,190
in you know was reported in in Wuhan
province and immediately I thought that

2184
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:53,200
province and immediately I thought that
 

2185
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:58,680
province and immediately I thought that
well we just did that can't we do the

2186
00:59:58,680 --> 00:59:58,690
well we just did that can't we do the
 

2187
00:59:58,690 --> 01:00:01,319
well we just did that can't we do the
same thing with this virus and so we

2188
01:00:01,319 --> 01:00:01,329
same thing with this virus and so we
 

2189
01:00:01,329 --> 01:00:03,569
same thing with this virus and so we
started waiting for the genome to be

2190
01:00:03,569 --> 01:00:03,579
started waiting for the genome to be
 

2191
01:00:03,579 --> 01:00:05,970
started waiting for the genome to be
released because that's essentially the

2192
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:05,980
released because that's essentially the
 

2193
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:08,099
released because that's essentially the
first piece of information that is

2194
01:00:08,099 --> 01:00:08,109
first piece of information that is
 

2195
01:00:08,109 --> 01:00:10,140
first piece of information that is
critical once you have the genome

2196
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:10,150
critical once you have the genome
 

2197
01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:11,370
critical once you have the genome
sequence you can

2198
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:11,380
sequence you can
 

2199
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:14,069
sequence you can
doing a lot using my informatics when

2200
01:00:14,069 --> 01:00:14,079
doing a lot using my informatics when
 

2201
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:15,809
doing a lot using my informatics when
you see genome sequence that's referring

2202
01:00:15,809 --> 01:00:15,819
you see genome sequence that's referring
 

2203
01:00:15,819 --> 01:00:18,930
you see genome sequence that's referring
to the sequence of letters that make up

2204
01:00:18,930 --> 01:00:18,940
to the sequence of letters that make up
 

2205
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:23,940
to the sequence of letters that make up
the RNA so the sequence that make up the

2206
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:23,950
the RNA so the sequence that make up the
 

2207
01:00:23,950 --> 01:00:27,569
the RNA so the sequence that make up the
entire information encoded in the

2208
01:00:27,569 --> 01:00:27,579
entire information encoded in the
 

2209
01:00:27,579 --> 01:00:31,700
entire information encoded in the
protein right so so that includes all 29

2210
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:31,710
protein right so so that includes all 29
 

2211
01:00:31,710 --> 01:00:33,620
protein right so so that includes all 29
genes

2212
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:33,630
genes
 

2213
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:37,289
genes
what are genes what's the encoding of

2214
01:00:37,289 --> 01:00:37,299
what are genes what's the encoding of
 

2215
01:00:37,299 --> 01:00:40,559
what are genes what's the encoding of
information sosigenes is essentially is

2216
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:40,569
information sosigenes is essentially is
 

2217
01:00:40,569 --> 01:00:46,769
information sosigenes is essentially is
a basic functional unit that we can

2218
01:00:46,769 --> 01:00:46,779
a basic functional unit that we can
 

2219
01:00:46,779 --> 01:00:49,440
a basic functional unit that we can
consider so so each gene in the virus

2220
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:49,450
consider so so each gene in the virus
 

2221
01:00:49,450 --> 01:00:54,210
consider so so each gene in the virus
would correspond to a protein that so

2222
01:00:54,210 --> 01:00:54,220
would correspond to a protein that so
 

2223
01:00:54,220 --> 01:00:56,999
would correspond to a protein that so
gene by itself doesn't do it function it

2224
01:00:56,999 --> 01:00:57,009
gene by itself doesn't do it function it
 

2225
01:00:57,009 --> 01:01:00,210
gene by itself doesn't do it function it
needs to be converted or translated into

2226
01:01:00,210 --> 01:01:00,220
needs to be converted or translated into
 

2227
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:05,539
needs to be converted or translated into
the protein that will become the actual

2228
01:01:05,539 --> 01:01:05,549
the protein that will become the actual
 

2229
01:01:05,549 --> 01:01:08,490
the protein that will become the actual
functional unit like you said the

2230
01:01:08,490 --> 01:01:08,500
functional unit like you said the
 

2231
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:11,279
functional unit like you said the
printer so so we need the printer for

2232
01:01:11,279 --> 01:01:11,289
printer so so we need the printer for
 

2233
01:01:11,289 --> 01:01:13,440
printer so so we need the printer for
that we need to print it okay so the the

2234
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:13,450
that we need to print it okay so the the
 

2235
01:01:13,450 --> 01:01:16,200
that we need to print it okay so the the
first step is to figure out that the

2236
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:16,210
first step is to figure out that the
 

2237
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:19,859
first step is to figure out that the
genome the sequence of things that to be

2238
01:01:19,859 --> 01:01:19,869
genome the sequence of things that to be
 

2239
01:01:19,869 --> 01:01:21,990
genome the sequence of things that to be
then used for printing the protein so

2240
01:01:21,990 --> 01:01:22,000
then used for printing the protein so
 

2241
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,039
then used for printing the protein so
okay so then then the next step so once

2242
01:01:26,039 --> 01:01:26,049
okay so then then the next step so once
 

2243
01:01:26,049 --> 01:01:29,999
okay so then then the next step so once
we have this and so we use the existing

2244
01:01:29,999 --> 01:01:30,009
we have this and so we use the existing
 

2245
01:01:30,009 --> 01:01:32,849
we have this and so we use the existing
information about Sarkis the Czar's

2246
01:01:32,849 --> 01:01:32,859
information about Sarkis the Czar's
 

2247
01:01:32,859 --> 01:01:38,370
information about Sarkis the Czar's
genomics has been done in abundance so

2248
01:01:38,370 --> 01:01:38,380
genomics has been done in abundance so
 

2249
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:41,160
genomics has been done in abundance so
we have different strains of SARS and

2250
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:41,170
we have different strains of SARS and
 

2251
01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:43,710
we have different strains of SARS and
actually other related coronaviruses

2252
01:01:43,710 --> 01:01:43,720
actually other related coronaviruses
 

2253
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:51,720
actually other related coronaviruses
MERS the bat coronavirus and we started

2254
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:51,730
MERS the bat coronavirus and we started
 

2255
01:01:51,730 --> 01:01:54,930
MERS the bat coronavirus and we started
by identifying the potential genes

2256
01:01:54,930 --> 01:01:54,940
by identifying the potential genes
 

2257
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:56,430
by identifying the potential genes
because right now it's just the sequence

2258
01:01:56,430 --> 01:01:56,440
because right now it's just the sequence
 

2259
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:58,999
because right now it's just the sequence
right it's a sequence that is roughly

2260
01:01:58,999 --> 01:01:59,009
right it's a sequence that is roughly
 

2261
01:01:59,009 --> 01:02:03,870
right it's a sequence that is roughly
it's less than 30,000 nucleotide long

2262
01:02:03,870 --> 01:02:03,880
it's less than 30,000 nucleotide long
 

2263
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:07,109
it's less than 30,000 nucleotide long
and this the raw sequence it's a rose

2264
01:02:07,109 --> 01:02:07,119
and this the raw sequence it's a rose
 

2265
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:10,650
and this the raw sequence it's a rose
ignore the information really and we now

2266
01:02:10,650 --> 01:02:10,660
ignore the information really and we now
 

2267
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:14,579
ignore the information really and we now
need to define the boundaries of the

2268
01:02:14,579 --> 01:02:14,589
need to define the boundaries of the
 

2269
01:02:14,589 --> 01:02:15,930
need to define the boundaries of the
genes

2270
01:02:15,930 --> 01:02:15,940
genes
 

2271
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:19,740
genes
that would then be used to identify the

2272
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:19,750
that would then be used to identify the
 

2273
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:22,770
that would then be used to identify the
proteins and protein structures how hard

2274
01:02:22,770 --> 01:02:22,780
proteins and protein structures how hard
 

2275
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:25,020
proteins and protein structures how hard
is that problem it's not I mean it's

2276
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:25,030
is that problem it's not I mean it's
 

2277
01:02:25,030 --> 01:02:26,940
is that problem it's not I mean it's
pretty straightforward

2278
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:26,950
pretty straightforward
 

2279
01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:30,870
pretty straightforward
so you know so because we use the

2280
01:02:30,870 --> 01:02:30,880
so you know so because we use the
 

2281
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:33,810
so you know so because we use the
existing information about SARS proteins

2282
01:02:33,810 --> 01:02:33,820
existing information about SARS proteins
 

2283
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:35,160
existing information about SARS proteins
and SARS genes

2284
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:35,170
and SARS genes
 

2285
01:02:35,170 --> 01:02:38,490
and SARS genes
so once again we kind of we are relying

2286
01:02:38,490 --> 01:02:38,500
so once again we kind of we are relying
 

2287
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:45,560
so once again we kind of we are relying
on the yes so and then once we get there

2288
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:45,570
on the yes so and then once we get there
 

2289
01:02:45,570 --> 01:02:49,700
on the yes so and then once we get there
this is where sort of the first more

2290
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:49,710
this is where sort of the first more
 

2291
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:52,890
this is where sort of the first more
traditional bind phonetic steps step

2292
01:02:52,890 --> 01:02:52,900
traditional bind phonetic steps step
 

2293
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:55,650
traditional bind phonetic steps step
begins we are trying to use these

2294
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:55,660
begins we are trying to use these
 

2295
01:02:55,660 --> 01:02:59,610
begins we are trying to use these
protein sequences and get the 3d

2296
01:02:59,610 --> 01:02:59,620
protein sequences and get the 3d
 

2297
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:05,730
protein sequences and get the 3d
information about those proteins so this

2298
01:03:05,730 --> 01:03:05,740
information about those proteins so this
 

2299
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:09,810
information about those proteins so this
is where we are relying heavily on the

2300
01:03:09,810 --> 01:03:09,820
is where we are relying heavily on the
 

2301
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:12,480
is where we are relying heavily on the
structure information specifically from

2302
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:12,490
structure information specifically from
 

2303
01:03:12,490 --> 01:03:14,790
structure information specifically from
the protein data bank that we are

2304
01:03:14,790 --> 01:03:14,800
the protein data bank that we are
 

2305
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,740
the protein data bank that we are
talking about and here you're looking

2306
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:16,750
talking about and here you're looking
 

2307
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:20,400
talking about and here you're looking
for similar proteins yes so so the the

2308
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:20,410
for similar proteins yes so so the the
 

2309
01:03:20,410 --> 01:03:23,820
for similar proteins yes so so the the
concept that we are operating when we do

2310
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:23,830
concept that we are operating when we do
 

2311
01:03:23,830 --> 01:03:25,560
concept that we are operating when we do
this kind of modeling it's called

2312
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:25,570
this kind of modeling it's called
 

2313
01:03:25,570 --> 01:03:28,500
this kind of modeling it's called
homology or template based modeling so

2314
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:28,510
homology or template based modeling so
 

2315
01:03:28,510 --> 01:03:32,550
homology or template based modeling so
essentially using the concept that if

2316
01:03:32,550 --> 01:03:32,560
essentially using the concept that if
 

2317
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:36,240
essentially using the concept that if
you have two sequences that are similar

2318
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:36,250
you have two sequences that are similar
 

2319
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:40,710
you have two sequences that are similar
in terms of the letters the structures

2320
01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:40,720
in terms of the letters the structures
 

2321
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,690
in terms of the letters the structures
of these sequences are expected to be

2322
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:42,700
of these sequences are expected to be
 

2323
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:46,110
of these sequences are expected to be
similar as well and this is at the micro

2324
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:46,120
similar as well and this is at the micro
 

2325
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:49,560
similar as well and this is at the micro
at a very local scale and at the scale

2326
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:49,570
at a very local scale and at the scale
 

2327
01:03:49,570 --> 01:03:50,790
at a very local scale and at the scale
of the whole protein at the whole

2328
01:03:50,790 --> 01:03:50,800
of the whole protein at the whole
 

2329
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:54,660
of the whole protein at the whole
protein I saw actually so you know so of

2330
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:54,670
protein I saw actually so you know so of
 

2331
01:03:54,670 --> 01:03:58,470
protein I saw actually so you know so of
course the devil is any details and this

2332
01:03:58,470 --> 01:03:58,480
course the devil is any details and this
 

2333
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:03,590
course the devil is any details and this
is why we need actually pre

2334
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:03,600
is why we need actually pre
 

2335
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:10,990
is why we need actually pre
sophisticated modeling tools to do so

2336
01:04:10,990 --> 01:04:11,000

 

2337
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,630

once we get these structures of the

2338
01:04:14,630 --> 01:04:14,640
once we get these structures of the
 

2339
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:18,890
once we get these structures of the
individual proteins we try to see

2340
01:04:18,890 --> 01:04:18,900
individual proteins we try to see
 

2341
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:23,029
individual proteins we try to see
whether or not this proteins act alone

2342
01:04:23,029 --> 01:04:23,039
whether or not this proteins act alone
 

2343
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:27,620
whether or not this proteins act alone
or they have to be forming protein

2344
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:27,630
or they have to be forming protein
 

2345
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:30,019
or they have to be forming protein
complexes in order to perform this

2346
01:04:30,019 --> 01:04:30,029
complexes in order to perform this
 

2347
01:04:30,029 --> 01:04:32,930
complexes in order to perform this
function and again so this is sort of

2348
01:04:32,930 --> 01:04:32,940
function and again so this is sort of
 

2349
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:35,299
function and again so this is sort of
the next level of the modeling because

2350
01:04:35,299 --> 01:04:35,309
the next level of the modeling because
 

2351
01:04:35,309 --> 01:04:38,390
the next level of the modeling because
now you need to understand how proteins

2352
01:04:38,390 --> 01:04:38,400
now you need to understand how proteins
 

2353
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,940
now you need to understand how proteins
interact and it could be the case that

2354
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:40,950
interact and it could be the case that
 

2355
01:04:40,950 --> 01:04:45,650
interact and it could be the case that
the protein interacts with itself and

2356
01:04:45,650 --> 01:04:45,660
the protein interacts with itself and
 

2357
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:51,620
the protein interacts with itself and
makes sort of a multi marek complex the

2358
01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:51,630
makes sort of a multi marek complex the
 

2359
01:04:51,630 --> 01:04:53,630
makes sort of a multi marek complex the
same protein just repeated multiple

2360
01:04:53,630 --> 01:04:53,640
same protein just repeated multiple
 

2361
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:57,859
same protein just repeated multiple
times and we have quite quite a few such

2362
01:04:57,859 --> 01:04:57,869
times and we have quite quite a few such
 

2363
01:04:57,869 --> 01:05:03,700
times and we have quite quite a few such
proteins in Tsarskoe v2 specifically

2364
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:03,710
proteins in Tsarskoe v2 specifically
 

2365
01:05:03,710 --> 01:05:07,819
proteins in Tsarskoe v2 specifically
spike protein needs three copies to

2366
01:05:07,819 --> 01:05:07,829
spike protein needs three copies to
 

2367
01:05:07,829 --> 01:05:12,470
spike protein needs three copies to
function and load protein needs five

2368
01:05:12,470 --> 01:05:12,480
function and load protein needs five
 

2369
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:15,589
function and load protein needs five
copies to function and there are some

2370
01:05:15,589 --> 01:05:15,599
copies to function and there are some
 

2371
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:19,430
copies to function and there are some
other multimeric complexes that we mean

2372
01:05:19,430 --> 01:05:19,440
other multimeric complexes that we mean
 

2373
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:21,019
other multimeric complexes that we mean
by interacted with itself and you see

2374
01:05:21,019 --> 01:05:21,029
by interacted with itself and you see
 

2375
01:05:21,029 --> 01:05:24,349
by interacted with itself and you see
multiple copy so how do you how do you

2376
01:05:24,349 --> 01:05:24,359
multiple copy so how do you how do you
 

2377
01:05:24,359 --> 01:05:25,730
multiple copy so how do you how do you
make a good guess whether something's

2378
01:05:25,730 --> 01:05:25,740
make a good guess whether something's
 

2379
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:28,430
make a good guess whether something's
going to interact well again so there

2380
01:05:28,430 --> 01:05:28,440
going to interact well again so there
 

2381
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:30,950
going to interact well again so there
are two approaches right so one is look

2382
01:05:30,950 --> 01:05:30,960
are two approaches right so one is look
 

2383
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:34,609
are two approaches right so one is look
at the previously solved complexes now

2384
01:05:34,609 --> 01:05:34,619
at the previously solved complexes now
 

2385
01:05:34,619 --> 01:05:36,349
at the previously solved complexes now
we're looking not at the individual

2386
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:36,359
we're looking not at the individual
 

2387
01:05:36,359 --> 01:05:38,690
we're looking not at the individual
structures but the structures of the

2388
01:05:38,690 --> 01:05:38,700
structures but the structures of the
 

2389
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:42,890
structures but the structures of the
whole complex complex is upon multiple

2390
01:05:42,890 --> 01:05:42,900
whole complex complex is upon multiple
 

2391
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:45,170
whole complex complex is upon multiple
proteins yes so it's a bunch of proteins

2392
01:05:45,170 --> 01:05:45,180
proteins yes so it's a bunch of proteins
 

2393
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:47,870
proteins yes so it's a bunch of proteins
essentially glued together and and when

2394
01:05:47,870 --> 01:05:47,880
essentially glued together and and when
 

2395
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:49,700
essentially glued together and and when
you say glued that's the interaction

2396
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:49,710
you say glued that's the interaction
 

2397
01:05:49,710 --> 01:05:51,769
you say glued that's the interaction
that's the interaction so so the

2398
01:05:51,769 --> 01:05:51,779
that's the interaction so so the
 

2399
01:05:51,779 --> 01:05:54,289
that's the interaction so so the
different forces different sort of

2400
01:05:54,289 --> 01:05:54,299
different forces different sort of
 

2401
01:05:54,299 --> 01:05:57,380
different forces different sort of
physical forces behind this as I

2402
01:05:57,380 --> 01:05:57,390
physical forces behind this as I
 

2403
01:05:57,390 --> 01:05:59,779
physical forces behind this as I
certainly keep asking dumb questions but

2404
01:05:59,779 --> 01:05:59,789
certainly keep asking dumb questions but
 

2405
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:03,170
certainly keep asking dumb questions but
is it is the glue is that the

2406
01:06:03,170 --> 01:06:03,180
is it is the glue is that the
 

2407
01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:05,809
is it is the glue is that the
interaction fundamentally structural or

2408
01:06:05,809 --> 01:06:05,819
interaction fundamentally structural or
 

2409
01:06:05,819 --> 01:06:08,990
interaction fundamentally structural or
is it functional like in the way you're

2410
01:06:08,990 --> 01:06:09,000
is it functional like in the way you're
 

2411
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,630
is it functional like in the way you're
thinking about it that's actually a very

2412
01:06:11,630 --> 01:06:11,640
thinking about it that's actually a very
 

2413
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:14,720
thinking about it that's actually a very
good way to ask this question because

2414
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:14,730
good way to ask this question because
 

2415
01:06:14,730 --> 01:06:18,319
good way to ask this question because
turns out that the interaction is

2416
01:06:18,319 --> 01:06:18,329
turns out that the interaction is
 

2417
01:06:18,329 --> 01:06:22,640
turns out that the interaction is
structural but in the way it forms this

2418
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:22,650
structural but in the way it forms this
 

2419
01:06:22,650 --> 01:06:23,270
structural but in the way it forms this
truck

2420
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:23,280
truck
 

2421
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,730
truck
it actually also carries out the

2422
01:06:25,730 --> 01:06:25,740
it actually also carries out the
 

2423
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:30,140
it actually also carries out the
function so interaction is often needed

2424
01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:30,150
function so interaction is often needed
 

2425
01:06:30,150 --> 01:06:33,770
function so interaction is often needed
to carry out very specific function or

2426
01:06:33,770 --> 01:06:33,780
to carry out very specific function or
 

2427
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:37,690
to carry out very specific function or
protein but in terms of an earth-sized

2428
01:06:37,690 --> 01:06:37,700
protein but in terms of an earth-sized
 

2429
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:40,430
protein but in terms of an earth-sized
figuring out you're really starting at

2430
01:06:40,430 --> 01:06:40,440
figuring out you're really starting at
 

2431
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:42,590
figuring out you're really starting at
the structure before you figure out the

2432
01:06:42,590 --> 01:06:42,600
the structure before you figure out the
 

2433
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:46,280
the structure before you figure out the
function so there's a beautiful figure

2434
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:46,290
function so there's a beautiful figure
 

2435
01:06:46,290 --> 01:06:49,580
function so there's a beautiful figure
two in the paper of all the different

2436
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:49,590
two in the paper of all the different
 

2437
01:06:49,590 --> 01:06:52,220
two in the paper of all the different
proteins that make up the able to figure

2438
01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:52,230
proteins that make up the able to figure
 

2439
01:06:52,230 --> 01:06:57,380
proteins that make up the able to figure
out the makeup the the new the novel

2440
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:57,390
out the makeup the the new the novel
 

2441
01:06:57,390 --> 01:07:00,530
out the makeup the the new the novel
current virus what what are we looking

2442
01:07:00,530 --> 01:07:00,540
current virus what what are we looking
 

2443
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:05,690
current virus what what are we looking
at right so these are like that's this

2444
01:07:05,690 --> 01:07:05,700
at right so these are like that's this
 

2445
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:08,000
at right so these are like that's this
through the the step to the mentioned

2446
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:08,010
through the the step to the mentioned
 

2447
01:07:08,010 --> 01:07:11,000
through the the step to the mentioned
when you try to guess at the possible

2448
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:11,010
when you try to guess at the possible
 

2449
01:07:11,010 --> 01:07:13,400
when you try to guess at the possible
proteins that's what you're going to get

2450
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:13,410
proteins that's what you're going to get
 

2451
01:07:13,410 --> 01:07:17,330
proteins that's what you're going to get
is these blue blue cyan blobs yes so

2452
01:07:17,330 --> 01:07:17,340
is these blue blue cyan blobs yes so
 

2453
01:07:17,340 --> 01:07:20,630
is these blue blue cyan blobs yes so
those are the individual proteins for

2454
01:07:20,630 --> 01:07:20,640
those are the individual proteins for
 

2455
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:24,650
those are the individual proteins for
which we have at least some information

2456
01:07:24,650 --> 01:07:24,660
which we have at least some information
 

2457
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:29,060
which we have at least some information
from the previous studies right so there

2458
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:29,070
from the previous studies right so there
 

2459
01:07:29,070 --> 01:07:30,860
from the previous studies right so there
is advantage and disadvantage of using

2460
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:30,870
is advantage and disadvantage of using
 

2461
01:07:30,870 --> 01:07:33,830
is advantage and disadvantage of using
previous studies the biggest well the

2462
01:07:33,830 --> 01:07:33,840
previous studies the biggest well the
 

2463
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:36,620
previous studies the biggest well the
disadvantage is that you know we may not

2464
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:36,630
disadvantage is that you know we may not
 

2465
01:07:36,630 --> 01:07:39,560
disadvantage is that you know we may not
necessarily have the coverage of all 29

2466
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:39,570
necessarily have the coverage of all 29
 

2467
01:07:39,570 --> 01:07:42,650
necessarily have the coverage of all 29
proteins however the biggest advantage

2468
01:07:42,650 --> 01:07:42,660
proteins however the biggest advantage
 

2469
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:46,040
proteins however the biggest advantage
is that the accuracy in which we can

2470
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:46,050
is that the accuracy in which we can
 

2471
01:07:46,050 --> 01:07:48,740
is that the accuracy in which we can
model these proteins is very high much

2472
01:07:48,740 --> 01:07:48,750
model these proteins is very high much
 

2473
01:07:48,750 --> 01:07:51,530
model these proteins is very high much
higher compared to a Benicia methods

2474
01:07:51,530 --> 01:07:51,540
higher compared to a Benicia methods
 

2475
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:55,810
higher compared to a Benicia methods
that do not use any template information

2476
01:07:55,810 --> 01:07:55,820
that do not use any template information
 

2477
01:07:55,820 --> 01:07:59,470
that do not use any template information
so but nevertheless this figure also has

2478
01:07:59,470 --> 01:07:59,480
so but nevertheless this figure also has
 

2479
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:02,840
so but nevertheless this figure also has
incision beautiful and I love these

2480
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:02,850
incision beautiful and I love these
 

2481
01:08:02,850 --> 01:08:06,410
incision beautiful and I love these
pictures so much you've as it has like

2482
01:08:06,410 --> 01:08:06,420
pictures so much you've as it has like
 

2483
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:08,270
pictures so much you've as it has like
the pink parts yes there are the parts

2484
01:08:08,270 --> 01:08:08,280
the pink parts yes there are the parts
 

2485
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:10,610
the pink parts yes there are the parts
that are different so you're

2486
01:08:10,610 --> 01:08:10,620
that are different so you're
 

2487
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:13,190
that are different so you're
highlighting so the difference you find

2488
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:13,200
highlighting so the difference you find
 

2489
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:16,039
highlighting so the difference you find
is on the 2d sequence and then you try

2490
01:08:16,039 --> 01:08:16,049
is on the 2d sequence and then you try
 

2491
01:08:16,049 --> 01:08:17,660
is on the 2d sequence and then you try
to infer what I would look like on the

2492
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:17,670
to infer what I would look like on the
 

2493
01:08:17,670 --> 01:08:21,099
to infer what I would look like on the
3d yeah so the difference actually is on

2494
01:08:21,099 --> 01:08:21,109
3d yeah so the difference actually is on
 

2495
01:08:21,109 --> 01:08:25,430
3d yeah so the difference actually is on
1d sequence one d1 design idea so and

2496
01:08:25,430 --> 01:08:25,440
1d sequence one d1 design idea so and
 

2497
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:28,400
1d sequence one d1 design idea so and
and so this is one of these first

2498
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:28,410
and so this is one of these first
 

2499
01:08:28,410 --> 01:08:32,329
and so this is one of these first
questions that we try to answer is that

2500
01:08:32,329 --> 01:08:32,339
questions that we try to answer is that
 

2501
01:08:32,339 --> 01:08:35,960
questions that we try to answer is that
well if you take this new virus and you

2502
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:35,970
well if you take this new virus and you
 

2503
01:08:35,970 --> 01:08:36,710
well if you take this new virus and you
take

2504
01:08:36,710 --> 01:08:36,720
take
 

2505
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:42,320
take
the closest relatives which are SARS and

2506
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:42,330
the closest relatives which are SARS and
 

2507
01:08:42,330 --> 01:08:47,750
the closest relatives which are SARS and
a couple of bad coronavirus strains they

2508
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:47,760
a couple of bad coronavirus strains they
 

2509
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:49,820
a couple of bad coronavirus strains they
are already the closest relatives that

2510
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:49,830
are already the closest relatives that
 

2511
01:08:49,830 --> 01:08:53,660
are already the closest relatives that
we are aware of now what are the

2512
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:53,670
we are aware of now what are the
 

2513
01:08:53,670 --> 01:08:56,270
we are aware of now what are the
difference between this virus and its

2514
01:08:56,270 --> 01:08:56,280
difference between this virus and its
 

2515
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:59,210
difference between this virus and its
close relatives right and what if you

2516
01:08:59,210 --> 01:08:59,220
close relatives right and what if you
 

2517
01:08:59,220 --> 01:09:02,410
close relatives right and what if you
look DIPA Klee when you take a sequence

2518
01:09:02,410 --> 01:09:02,420
look DIPA Klee when you take a sequence
 

2519
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:06,350
look DIPA Klee when you take a sequence
those differences could be quite far

2520
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:06,360
those differences could be quite far
 

2521
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:10,250
those differences could be quite far
away from each other so what make what

2522
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:10,260
away from each other so what make what
 

2523
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:13,490
away from each other so what make what
3d structure makes those difference to

2524
01:09:13,490 --> 01:09:13,500
3d structure makes those difference to
 

2525
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:16,880
3d structure makes those difference to
do they very often they tend to cluster

2526
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:16,890
do they very often they tend to cluster
 

2527
01:09:16,890 --> 01:09:20,450
do they very often they tend to cluster
together interesting and over sudden the

2528
01:09:20,450 --> 01:09:20,460
together interesting and over sudden the
 

2529
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:22,460
together interesting and over sudden the
differences that may look completely

2530
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:22,470
differences that may look completely
 

2531
01:09:22,470 --> 01:09:26,930
differences that may look completely
unrelated actually relate to each other

2532
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:26,940
unrelated actually relate to each other
 

2533
01:09:26,940 --> 01:09:30,920
unrelated actually relate to each other
and sometimes they are there because

2534
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:30,930
and sometimes they are there because
 

2535
01:09:30,930 --> 01:09:33,980
and sometimes they are there because
they correspond they attack the

2536
01:09:33,980 --> 01:09:33,990
they correspond they attack the
 

2537
01:09:33,990 --> 01:09:37,100
they correspond they attack the
functional side right so they are there

2538
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:37,110
functional side right so they are there
 

2539
01:09:37,110 --> 01:09:40,820
functional side right so they are there
because this is the functional side that

2540
01:09:40,820 --> 01:09:40,830
because this is the functional side that
 

2541
01:09:40,830 --> 01:09:44,320
because this is the functional side that
is highly mutated so that's a

2542
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:44,330
is highly mutated so that's a
 

2543
01:09:44,330 --> 01:09:47,960
is highly mutated so that's a
computational approach to figuring

2544
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:47,970
computational approach to figuring
 

2545
01:09:47,970 --> 01:09:50,270
computational approach to figuring
something out when when it comes

2546
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:50,280
something out when when it comes
 

2547
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:52,010
something out when when it comes
together like that that's kind of a nice

2548
01:09:52,010 --> 01:09:52,020
together like that that's kind of a nice
 

2549
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:54,080
together like that that's kind of a nice
clean indication that there's something

2550
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:54,090
clean indication that there's something
 

2551
01:09:54,090 --> 01:09:56,090
clean indication that there's something
this could be actually indicative of

2552
01:09:56,090 --> 01:09:56,100
this could be actually indicative of
 

2553
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:59,900
this could be actually indicative of
what's what's happening yes I mean so we

2554
01:09:59,900 --> 01:09:59,910
what's what's happening yes I mean so we
 

2555
01:09:59,910 --> 01:10:03,590
what's what's happening yes I mean so we
need this information and you know 3d

2556
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:03,600
need this information and you know 3d
 

2557
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:09,220
need this information and you know 3d
the 3d structure gives us just a very

2558
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:09,230
the 3d structure gives us just a very
 

2559
01:10:09,230 --> 01:10:11,960
the 3d structure gives us just a very
intuitive way to look at this

2560
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:11,970
intuitive way to look at this
 

2561
01:10:11,970 --> 01:10:16,010
intuitive way to look at this
information and then start to ask you

2562
01:10:16,010 --> 01:10:16,020
information and then start to ask you
 

2563
01:10:16,020 --> 01:10:19,550
information and then start to ask you
know start asking questions such as so

2564
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:19,560
know start asking questions such as so
 

2565
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:22,010
know start asking questions such as so
this place of this protein that is

2566
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:22,020
this place of this protein that is
 

2567
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:29,210
this place of this protein that is
highly mutated does it does it is it the

2568
01:10:29,210 --> 01:10:29,220
highly mutated does it does it is it the
 

2569
01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:33,290
highly mutated does it does it is it the
functional part of the protein so does

2570
01:10:33,290 --> 01:10:33,300
functional part of the protein so does
 

2571
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:37,160
functional part of the protein so does
this part of the protein interact with

2572
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:37,170
this part of the protein interact with
 

2573
01:10:37,170 --> 01:10:40,100
this part of the protein interact with
some other protein so maybe with some

2574
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:40,110
some other protein so maybe with some
 

2575
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:42,530
some other protein so maybe with some
other ligands small small molecules

2576
01:10:42,530 --> 01:10:42,540
other ligands small small molecules
 

2577
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:45,250
other ligands small small molecules
right so we would try now to

2578
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:45,260
right so we would try now to
 

2579
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:50,200
right so we would try now to
functionally inform this 3d structure

2580
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:50,210
functionally inform this 3d structure
 

2581
01:10:50,210 --> 01:10:53,899
functionally inform this 3d structure
so so you have a bunch of these mutated

2582
01:10:53,899 --> 01:10:53,909
so so you have a bunch of these mutated
 

2583
01:10:53,909 --> 01:10:59,060
so so you have a bunch of these mutated
parts is like I don't know how like how

2584
01:10:59,060 --> 01:10:59,070
parts is like I don't know how like how
 

2585
01:10:59,070 --> 01:11:02,120
parts is like I don't know how like how
many are there in the new novel

2586
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:02,130
many are there in the new novel
 

2587
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:03,740
many are there in the new novel
coronavirus being compared it's ours oh

2588
01:11:03,740 --> 01:11:03,750
coronavirus being compared it's ours oh
 

2589
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:04,760
coronavirus being compared it's ours oh
we're talking about hundreds of

2590
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:04,770
we're talking about hundreds of
 

2591
01:11:04,770 --> 01:11:08,030
we're talking about hundreds of
thousands like these these pink region

2592
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:08,040
thousands like these these pink region
 

2593
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:10,850
thousands like these these pink region
all know did much less than that and

2594
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:10,860
all know did much less than that and
 

2595
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:12,919
all know did much less than that and
it's very interesting that if you look

2596
01:11:12,919 --> 01:11:12,929
it's very interesting that if you look
 

2597
01:11:12,929 --> 01:11:14,600
it's very interesting that if you look
at that you know so the first thing that

2598
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:14,610
at that you know so the first thing that
 

2599
01:11:14,610 --> 01:11:17,390
at that you know so the first thing that
you you start seeing right you know you

2600
01:11:17,390 --> 01:11:17,400
you you start seeing right you know you
 

2601
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:20,180
you you start seeing right you know you
look at patterns right and the first

2602
01:11:20,180 --> 01:11:20,190
look at patterns right and the first
 

2603
01:11:20,190 --> 01:11:23,799
look at patterns right and the first
pattern that becomes obvious is that

2604
01:11:23,799 --> 01:11:23,809
pattern that becomes obvious is that
 

2605
01:11:23,809 --> 01:11:27,799
pattern that becomes obvious is that
some of the proteins in the new

2606
01:11:27,799 --> 01:11:27,809
some of the proteins in the new
 

2607
01:11:27,809 --> 01:11:31,129
some of the proteins in the new
coronavirus are pretty much intact right

2608
01:11:31,129 --> 01:11:31,139
coronavirus are pretty much intact right
 

2609
01:11:31,139 --> 01:11:33,350
coronavirus are pretty much intact right
so they're pretty much exactly the same

2610
01:11:33,350 --> 01:11:33,360
so they're pretty much exactly the same
 

2611
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:38,390
so they're pretty much exactly the same
as SARS as the bat coronavirus

2612
01:11:38,390 --> 01:11:38,400
as SARS as the bat coronavirus
 

2613
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:43,520
as SARS as the bat coronavirus
where some others are heavily mutated so

2614
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:43,530
where some others are heavily mutated so
 

2615
01:11:43,530 --> 01:11:46,760
where some others are heavily mutated so
so it looks like that the you know the

2616
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:46,770
so it looks like that the you know the
 

2617
01:11:46,770 --> 01:11:52,879
so it looks like that the you know the
evolution is not is not a curing you

2618
01:11:52,879 --> 01:11:52,889
evolution is not is not a curing you
 

2619
01:11:52,889 --> 01:11:56,450
evolution is not is not a curing you
know uniformly across the entire you

2620
01:11:56,450 --> 01:11:56,460
know uniformly across the entire you
 

2621
01:11:56,460 --> 01:11:59,450
know uniformly across the entire you
know viral genome but actually target

2622
01:11:59,450 --> 01:11:59,460
know viral genome but actually target
 

2623
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:02,720
know viral genome but actually target
very specific proteins what do you do

2624
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:02,730
very specific proteins what do you do
 

2625
01:12:02,730 --> 01:12:04,669
very specific proteins what do you do
with that like from the Sherlock Holmes

2626
01:12:04,669 --> 01:12:04,679
with that like from the Sherlock Holmes
 

2627
01:12:04,679 --> 01:12:07,899
with that like from the Sherlock Holmes
perspective well you know so one of the

2628
01:12:07,899 --> 01:12:07,909
perspective well you know so one of the
 

2629
01:12:07,909 --> 01:12:14,000
perspective well you know so one of the
of the most interesting findings we had

2630
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:14,010
of the most interesting findings we had
 

2631
01:12:14,010 --> 01:12:20,750
of the most interesting findings we had
was the fact that the viral so the the

2632
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:20,760
was the fact that the viral so the the
 

2633
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:25,220
was the fact that the viral so the the
binding sites on the viral surfaces that

2634
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:25,230
binding sites on the viral surfaces that
 

2635
01:12:25,230 --> 01:12:28,760
binding sites on the viral surfaces that
get targeted by the known small

2636
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:28,770
get targeted by the known small
 

2637
01:12:28,770 --> 01:12:33,049
get targeted by the known small
molecules the world pretty much not

2638
01:12:33,049 --> 01:12:33,059
molecules the world pretty much not
 

2639
01:12:33,059 --> 01:12:36,189
molecules the world pretty much not
affected at all and so that means that

2640
01:12:36,189 --> 01:12:36,199
affected at all and so that means that
 

2641
01:12:36,199 --> 01:12:42,319
affected at all and so that means that
the same small drugs or small small drug

2642
01:12:42,319 --> 01:12:42,329
the same small drugs or small small drug
 

2643
01:12:42,329 --> 01:12:48,350
the same small drugs or small small drug
like compounds can be efficient for the

2644
01:12:48,350 --> 01:12:48,360
like compounds can be efficient for the
 

2645
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:52,569
like compounds can be efficient for the
new current a virus

2646
01:12:52,569 --> 01:12:52,579

 

2647
01:12:52,579 --> 01:12:54,069

this all actually maps to the drug

2648
01:12:54,069 --> 01:12:54,079
this all actually maps to the drug
 

2649
01:12:54,079 --> 01:12:56,709
this all actually maps to the drug
compounds - like so so you're actually

2650
01:12:56,709 --> 01:12:56,719
compounds - like so so you're actually
 

2651
01:12:56,719 --> 01:13:01,359
compounds - like so so you're actually
mapping out what old stuff is gonna work

2652
01:13:01,359 --> 01:13:01,369
mapping out what old stuff is gonna work
 

2653
01:13:01,369 --> 01:13:03,879
mapping out what old stuff is gonna work
on this thing and then possibilities for

2654
01:13:03,879 --> 01:13:03,889
on this thing and then possibilities for
 

2655
01:13:03,889 --> 01:13:06,520
on this thing and then possibilities for
new stuff to work by mapping out the

2656
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:06,530
new stuff to work by mapping out the
 

2657
01:13:06,530 --> 01:13:08,919
new stuff to work by mapping out the
things I've mutated yes so so we

2658
01:13:08,919 --> 01:13:08,929
things I've mutated yes so so we
 

2659
01:13:08,929 --> 01:13:11,500
things I've mutated yes so so we
essentially know which parts is in

2660
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:11,510
essentially know which parts is in
 

2661
01:13:11,510 --> 01:13:15,939
essentially know which parts is in
behave differently and which parts are

2662
01:13:15,939 --> 01:13:15,949
behave differently and which parts are
 

2663
01:13:15,949 --> 01:13:19,149
behave differently and which parts are
likely to behave similar and again you

2664
01:13:19,149 --> 01:13:19,159
likely to behave similar and again you
 

2665
01:13:19,159 --> 01:13:22,540
likely to behave similar and again you
know of course all our predictions need

2666
01:13:22,540 --> 01:13:22,550
know of course all our predictions need
 

2667
01:13:22,550 --> 01:13:26,020
know of course all our predictions need
to be validated by experiments but

2668
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:26,030
to be validated by experiments but
 

2669
01:13:26,030 --> 01:13:28,989
to be validated by experiments but
hopefully that sort of helps us to

2670
01:13:28,989 --> 01:13:28,999
hopefully that sort of helps us to
 

2671
01:13:28,999 --> 01:13:33,429
hopefully that sort of helps us to
delineate the regions of this virus that

2672
01:13:33,429 --> 01:13:33,439
delineate the regions of this virus that
 

2673
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:36,549
delineate the regions of this virus that
you know can be promising in terms of

2674
01:13:36,549 --> 01:13:36,559
you know can be promising in terms of
 

2675
01:13:36,559 --> 01:13:40,119
you know can be promising in terms of
the drug discovery you kind of you kind

2676
01:13:40,119 --> 01:13:40,129
the drug discovery you kind of you kind
 

2677
01:13:40,129 --> 01:13:42,339
the drug discovery you kind of you kind
of mentioned this already but maybe you

2678
01:13:42,339 --> 01:13:42,349
of mentioned this already but maybe you
 

2679
01:13:42,349 --> 01:13:45,069
of mentioned this already but maybe you
can elaborate so how different from this

2680
01:13:45,069 --> 01:13:45,079
can elaborate so how different from this
 

2681
01:13:45,079 --> 01:13:46,929
can elaborate so how different from this
structural and functional perspective

2682
01:13:46,929 --> 01:13:46,939
structural and functional perspective
 

2683
01:13:46,939 --> 01:13:50,229
structural and functional perspective
does the new corona virus appear to be

2684
01:13:50,229 --> 01:13:50,239
does the new corona virus appear to be
 

2685
01:13:50,239 --> 01:13:54,399
does the new corona virus appear to be
relative to SARS we now are trying to

2686
01:13:54,399 --> 01:13:54,409
relative to SARS we now are trying to
 

2687
01:13:54,409 --> 01:13:58,329
relative to SARS we now are trying to
understand the overall structural

2688
01:13:58,329 --> 01:13:58,339
understand the overall structural
 

2689
01:13:58,339 --> 01:14:00,250
understand the overall structural
characteristics of this virus because I

2690
01:14:00,250 --> 01:14:00,260
characteristics of this virus because I
 

2691
01:14:00,260 --> 01:14:02,529
characteristics of this virus because I
mean that's that's our next step trying

2692
01:14:02,529 --> 01:14:02,539
mean that's that's our next step trying
 

2693
01:14:02,539 --> 01:14:07,419
mean that's that's our next step trying
to model the viral particle of a single

2694
01:14:07,419 --> 01:14:07,429
to model the viral particle of a single
 

2695
01:14:07,429 --> 01:14:09,520
to model the viral particle of a single
viral particle of this virus so that

2696
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:09,530
viral particle of this virus so that
 

2697
01:14:09,530 --> 01:14:12,250
viral particle of this virus so that
means you have the individual proteins

2698
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:12,260
means you have the individual proteins
 

2699
01:14:12,260 --> 01:14:13,839
means you have the individual proteins
you think you said you have to figure

2700
01:14:13,839 --> 01:14:13,849
you think you said you have to figure
 

2701
01:14:13,849 --> 01:14:16,599
you think you said you have to figure
out what their interaction is as you

2702
01:14:16,599 --> 01:14:16,609
out what their interaction is as you
 

2703
01:14:16,609 --> 01:14:18,429
out what their interaction is as you
have this is that where this graph kind

2704
01:14:18,429 --> 01:14:18,439
have this is that where this graph kind
 

2705
01:14:18,439 --> 01:14:21,310
have this is that where this graph kind
of interact on so so internet so so the

2706
01:14:21,310 --> 01:14:21,320
of interact on so so internet so so the
 

2707
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:24,119
of interact on so so internet so so the
interactome at the site is essentially a

2708
01:14:24,119 --> 01:14:24,129
interactome at the site is essentially a
 

2709
01:14:24,129 --> 01:14:27,750
interactome at the site is essentially a
so our prediction on the potential

2710
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:27,760
so our prediction on the potential
 

2711
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:29,969
so our prediction on the potential
interactions some of them that we

2712
01:14:29,969 --> 01:14:29,979
interactions some of them that we
 

2713
01:14:29,979 --> 01:14:33,159
interactions some of them that we
already deciphered from the structural

2714
01:14:33,159 --> 01:14:33,169
already deciphered from the structural
 

2715
01:14:33,169 --> 01:14:34,719
already deciphered from the structural
knowledge but some of them that

2716
01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:34,729
knowledge but some of them that
 

2717
01:14:34,729 --> 01:14:37,089
knowledge but some of them that
essentially are deciphered from the

2718
01:14:37,089 --> 01:14:37,099
essentially are deciphered from the
 

2719
01:14:37,099 --> 01:14:40,149
essentially are deciphered from the
knowledge of the existing interactions

2720
01:14:40,149 --> 01:14:40,159
knowledge of the existing interactions
 

2721
01:14:40,159 --> 01:14:44,859
knowledge of the existing interactions
that people previously obtained for SARS

2722
01:14:44,859 --> 01:14:44,869
that people previously obtained for SARS
 

2723
01:14:44,869 --> 01:14:49,869
that people previously obtained for SARS
for MERS or other related viruses so is

2724
01:14:49,869 --> 01:14:49,879
for MERS or other related viruses so is
 

2725
01:14:49,879 --> 01:14:53,229
for MERS or other related viruses so is
there kind of interact ohms am i

2726
01:14:53,229 --> 01:14:53,239
there kind of interact ohms am i
 

2727
01:14:53,239 --> 01:14:54,399
there kind of interact ohms am i
pronouncing that correctly weather

2728
01:14:54,399 --> 01:14:54,409
pronouncing that correctly weather
 

2729
01:14:54,409 --> 01:14:58,679
pronouncing that correctly weather
interaction yeah are those already

2730
01:14:58,679 --> 01:14:58,689
interaction yeah are those already
 

2731
01:14:58,689 --> 01:15:02,829
interaction yeah are those already
converged towards for SARS for so do I

2732
01:15:02,829 --> 01:15:02,839
converged towards for SARS for so do I
 

2733
01:15:02,839 --> 01:15:06,130
converged towards for SARS for so do I
think there is there are a couple of

2734
01:15:06,130 --> 01:15:06,140
think there is there are a couple of
 

2735
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:12,280
think there is there are a couple of
papers that now investigate the sort of

2736
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:12,290
papers that now investigate the sort of
 

2737
01:15:12,290 --> 01:15:16,360
papers that now investigate the sort of
the large-scale set of sets of

2738
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:16,370
the large-scale set of sets of
 

2739
01:15:16,370 --> 01:15:20,490
the large-scale set of sets of
interactions between the new czars and

2740
01:15:20,490 --> 01:15:20,500
interactions between the new czars and
 

2741
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:24,520
interactions between the new czars and
its hosts and so I think that's that's

2742
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:24,530
its hosts and so I think that's that's
 

2743
01:15:24,530 --> 01:15:26,800
its hosts and so I think that's that's
an ongoing study I think and the success

2744
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:26,810
an ongoing study I think and the success
 

2745
01:15:26,810 --> 01:15:28,720
an ongoing study I think and the success
of that the result would be an interact

2746
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:28,730
of that the result would be an interact
 

2747
01:15:28,730 --> 01:15:29,650
of that the result would be an interact
on yes

2748
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:29,660
on yes
 

2749
01:15:29,660 --> 01:15:33,940
on yes
and so when you say not trying to figure

2750
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:33,950
and so when you say not trying to figure
 

2751
01:15:33,950 --> 01:15:37,420
and so when you say not trying to figure
out the entire the article the entire

2752
01:15:37,420 --> 01:15:37,430
out the entire the article the entire
 

2753
01:15:37,430 --> 01:15:39,520
out the entire the article the entire
wrinkle right so if you look you know so

2754
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:39,530
wrinkle right so if you look you know so
 

2755
01:15:39,530 --> 01:15:41,650
wrinkle right so if you look you know so
structure right so what this viral

2756
01:15:41,650 --> 01:15:41,660
structure right so what this viral
 

2757
01:15:41,660 --> 01:15:44,920
structure right so what this viral
particle looks like right so as I said

2758
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:44,930
particle looks like right so as I said
 

2759
01:15:44,930 --> 01:15:47,710
particle looks like right so as I said
it's it's you know the surface of it is

2760
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:47,720
it's it's you know the surface of it is
 

2761
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:50,440
it's it's you know the surface of it is
an envelope which is essentially a

2762
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:50,450
an envelope which is essentially a
 

2763
01:15:50,450 --> 01:15:56,010
an envelope which is essentially a
so-called lipid bilayer with proteins

2764
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:56,020
so-called lipid bilayer with proteins
 

2765
01:15:56,020 --> 01:16:01,000
so-called lipid bilayer with proteins
integrated into the surface so how so so

2766
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:01,010
integrated into the surface so how so so
 

2767
01:16:01,010 --> 01:16:07,210
integrated into the surface so how so so
an average particle is around 18

2768
01:16:07,210 --> 01:16:07,220
an average particle is around 18
 

2769
01:16:07,220 --> 01:16:13,620
an average particle is around 18
nanometers right so this particle can

2770
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:13,630
nanometers right so this particle can
 

2771
01:16:13,630 --> 01:16:21,700
nanometers right so this particle can
have about 5,200 spike proteins so at

2772
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:21,710
have about 5,200 spike proteins so at
 

2773
01:16:21,710 --> 01:16:23,710
have about 5,200 spike proteins so at
least we suspect it and you know based

2774
01:16:23,710 --> 01:16:23,720
least we suspect it and you know based
 

2775
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:24,150
least we suspect it and you know based
on the

2776
01:16:24,150 --> 01:16:24,160
on the
 

2777
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:27,670
on the
micrographs images it's very comparable

2778
01:16:27,670 --> 01:16:27,680
micrographs images it's very comparable
 

2779
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:32,250
micrographs images it's very comparable
to m hv virus in mice and SARS virus

2780
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:32,260
to m hv virus in mice and SARS virus
 

2781
01:16:32,260 --> 01:16:34,870
to m hv virus in mice and SARS virus
micrographs are actual pictures of the

2782
01:16:34,870 --> 01:16:34,880
micrographs are actual pictures of the
 

2783
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:37,720
micrographs are actual pictures of the
actual virus okay so these are models

2784
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:37,730
actual virus okay so these are models
 

2785
01:16:37,730 --> 01:16:39,520
actual virus okay so these are models
this is that at least so they did actual

2786
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:39,530
this is that at least so they did actual
 

2787
01:16:39,530 --> 01:16:41,770
this is that at least so they did actual
meat images right what do they sorry for

2788
01:16:41,770 --> 01:16:41,780
meat images right what do they sorry for
 

2789
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:43,120
meat images right what do they sorry for
the tangents but what are these things

2790
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:43,130
the tangents but what are these things
 

2791
01:16:43,130 --> 01:16:46,210
the tangents but what are these things
so when you look on the internet the

2792
01:16:46,210 --> 01:16:46,220
so when you look on the internet the
 

2793
01:16:46,220 --> 01:16:49,300
so when you look on the internet the
models and the pictures are in pen and

2794
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:49,310
models and the pictures are in pen and
 

2795
01:16:49,310 --> 01:16:50,740
models and the pictures are in pen and
the models you have here just gorgeous

2796
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:50,750
the models you have here just gorgeous
 

2797
01:16:50,750 --> 01:16:53,080
the models you have here just gorgeous
and beautiful when you actually take

2798
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:53,090
and beautiful when you actually take
 

2799
01:16:53,090 --> 01:16:54,970
and beautiful when you actually take
pictures of them or the micrograph like

2800
01:16:54,970 --> 01:16:54,980
pictures of them or the micrograph like
 

2801
01:16:54,980 --> 01:16:56,620
pictures of them or the micrograph like
what what do we look well

2802
01:16:56,620 --> 01:16:56,630
what what do we look well
 

2803
01:16:56,630 --> 01:17:00,250
what what do we look well
they typically are not perfect it's also

2804
01:17:00,250 --> 01:17:00,260
they typically are not perfect it's also
 

2805
01:17:00,260 --> 01:17:03,070
they typically are not perfect it's also
the most of the images that you see now

2806
01:17:03,070 --> 01:17:03,080
the most of the images that you see now
 

2807
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:08,350
the most of the images that you see now
is the is the sphere with those spikes

2808
01:17:08,350 --> 01:17:08,360
is the is the sphere with those spikes
 

2809
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:11,110
is the is the sphere with those spikes
you actually see bikes yes yes you do

2810
01:17:11,110 --> 01:17:11,120
you actually see bikes yes yes you do
 

2811
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:15,940
you actually see bikes yes yes you do
see the spikes and now you know the our

2812
01:17:15,940 --> 01:17:15,950
see the spikes and now you know the our
 

2813
01:17:15,950 --> 01:17:21,100
see the spikes and now you know the our
collaborators for Texas and I am

2814
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:21,110

 

2815
01:17:21,110 --> 01:17:25,520

Benjamin Moomin he actually in the

2816
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:25,530
Benjamin Moomin he actually in the
 

2817
01:17:25,530 --> 01:17:27,860
Benjamin Moomin he actually in the
recent paper about SARS he proposed and

2818
01:17:27,860 --> 01:17:27,870
recent paper about SARS he proposed and
 

2819
01:17:27,870 --> 01:17:31,250
recent paper about SARS he proposed and
there is some actually evidence behind

2820
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:31,260
there is some actually evidence behind
 

2821
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:34,939
there is some actually evidence behind
it that the particle is not a sphere but

2822
01:17:34,939 --> 01:17:34,949
it that the particle is not a sphere but
 

2823
01:17:34,949 --> 01:17:41,200
it that the particle is not a sphere but
is actually is elongated ellipsoid like

2824
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:41,210
is actually is elongated ellipsoid like
 

2825
01:17:41,210 --> 01:17:45,439
is actually is elongated ellipsoid like
particles so so that's what we are

2826
01:17:45,439 --> 01:17:45,449
particles so so that's what we are
 

2827
01:17:45,449 --> 01:17:49,870
particles so so that's what we are
trying to incorporate into our model and

2828
01:17:49,870 --> 01:17:49,880
trying to incorporate into our model and
 

2829
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:54,680
trying to incorporate into our model and
the reaiiy mean you know if you look at

2830
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:54,690
the reaiiy mean you know if you look at
 

2831
01:17:54,690 --> 01:17:57,020
the reaiiy mean you know if you look at
the actual micrographs you see that

2832
01:17:57,020 --> 01:17:57,030
the actual micrographs you see that
 

2833
01:17:57,030 --> 01:18:01,490
the actual micrographs you see that
those particles are you know are not

2834
01:18:01,490 --> 01:18:01,500
those particles are you know are not
 

2835
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:04,939
those particles are you know are not
symmetric so there's some of them and of

2836
01:18:04,939 --> 01:18:04,949
symmetric so there's some of them and of
 

2837
01:18:04,949 --> 01:18:06,560
symmetric so there's some of them and of
course you know it could be due to the

2838
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:06,570
course you know it could be due to the
 

2839
01:18:06,570 --> 01:18:10,430
course you know it could be due to the
treatment of the of the material it

2840
01:18:10,430 --> 01:18:10,440
treatment of the of the material it
 

2841
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:14,030
treatment of the of the material it
could be due to the some noise in the

2842
01:18:14,030 --> 01:18:14,040
could be due to the some noise in the
 

2843
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:16,370
could be due to the some noise in the
imaging so there's a lot of uncertainty

2844
01:18:16,370 --> 01:18:16,380
imaging so there's a lot of uncertainty
 

2845
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:18,860
imaging so there's a lot of uncertainty
so it's okay so structurally figuring

2846
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:18,870
so it's okay so structurally figuring
 

2847
01:18:18,870 --> 01:18:21,709
so it's okay so structurally figuring
out the entire part by the way again

2848
01:18:21,709 --> 01:18:21,719
out the entire part by the way again
 

2849
01:18:21,719 --> 01:18:24,860
out the entire part by the way again
sorry for the tangents but why the term

2850
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:24,870
sorry for the tangents but why the term
 

2851
01:18:24,870 --> 01:18:28,640
sorry for the tangents but why the term
particle or is it just it's it's a

2852
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:28,650
particle or is it just it's it's a
 

2853
01:18:28,650 --> 01:18:30,860
particle or is it just it's it's a
single you know so we could you know we

2854
01:18:30,860 --> 01:18:30,870
single you know so we could you know we
 

2855
01:18:30,870 --> 01:18:33,470
single you know so we could you know we
call it the virion so very unparticle

2856
01:18:33,470 --> 01:18:33,480
call it the virion so very unparticle
 

2857
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:36,080
call it the virion so very unparticle
it's essentially a single virus single

2858
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:36,090
it's essentially a single virus single
 

2859
01:18:36,090 --> 01:18:39,380
it's essentially a single virus single
virus but just feels like this particle

2860
01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:39,390
virus but just feels like this particle
 

2861
01:18:39,390 --> 01:18:41,840
virus but just feels like this particle
to me from the physics perspective feels

2862
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:41,850
to me from the physics perspective feels
 

2863
01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:46,220
to me from the physics perspective feels
like this the most basic unit because

2864
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:46,230
like this the most basic unit because
 

2865
01:18:46,230 --> 01:18:47,689
like this the most basic unit because
there seems to be so much going on

2866
01:18:47,689 --> 01:18:47,699
there seems to be so much going on
 

2867
01:18:47,699 --> 01:18:50,030
there seems to be so much going on
inside the virus yeah it doesn't feel

2868
01:18:50,030 --> 01:18:50,040
inside the virus yeah it doesn't feel
 

2869
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:52,160
inside the virus yeah it doesn't feel
like a particle - yes well yeah it's

2870
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:52,170
like a particle - yes well yeah it's
 

2871
01:18:52,170 --> 01:18:54,770
like a particle - yes well yeah it's
probably I think it's the the you know

2872
01:18:54,770 --> 01:18:54,780
probably I think it's the the you know
 

2873
01:18:54,780 --> 01:18:58,479
probably I think it's the the you know
variant is is a good way to call it so

2874
01:18:58,479 --> 01:18:58,489
variant is is a good way to call it so
 

2875
01:18:58,489 --> 01:19:02,780
variant is is a good way to call it so
okay so trying to figure out trying to

2876
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:02,790
okay so trying to figure out trying to
 

2877
01:19:02,790 --> 01:19:04,820
okay so trying to figure out trying to
figure out the entirety of the system

2878
01:19:04,820 --> 01:19:04,830
figure out the entirety of the system
 

2879
01:19:04,830 --> 01:19:08,750
figure out the entirety of the system
yes so you know so you know so this is

2880
01:19:08,750 --> 01:19:08,760
yes so you know so you know so this is
 

2881
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:15,290
yes so you know so you know so this is
so severe ian has 5,200 spikes a trimer

2882
01:19:15,290 --> 01:19:15,300
so severe ian has 5,200 spikes a trimer
 

2883
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:22,120
so severe ian has 5,200 spikes a trimer
spikes it has roughly 200 to 400

2884
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:22,130

 

2885
01:19:22,130 --> 01:19:25,880

membrane protein dimers and those are

2886
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:25,890
membrane protein dimers and those are
 

2887
01:19:25,890 --> 01:19:28,700
membrane protein dimers and those are
arranged in there very nice lattice so

2888
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:28,710
arranged in there very nice lattice so
 

2889
01:19:28,710 --> 01:19:30,590
arranged in there very nice lattice so
you can actually see sort of the it's

2890
01:19:30,590 --> 01:19:30,600
you can actually see sort of the it's
 

2891
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:33,120
you can actually see sort of the it's
it's like a

2892
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:33,130
it's like a
 

2893
01:19:33,130 --> 01:19:36,270
it's like a
it's a carpet of on the surface again

2894
01:19:36,270 --> 01:19:36,280
it's a carpet of on the surface again
 

2895
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:39,600
it's a carpet of on the surface again
exactly on the surface and occasionally

2896
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:39,610
exactly on the surface and occasionally
 

2897
01:19:39,610 --> 01:19:42,410
exactly on the surface and occasionally
you also see this envelope protein

2898
01:19:42,410 --> 01:19:42,420
you also see this envelope protein
 

2899
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:45,000
you also see this envelope protein
inside and some of the one we don't know

2900
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:45,010
inside and some of the one we don't know
 

2901
01:19:45,010 --> 01:19:47,220
inside and some of the one we don't know
what it does actually exactly the one

2902
01:19:47,220 --> 01:19:47,230
what it does actually exactly the one
 

2903
01:19:47,230 --> 01:19:49,560
what it does actually exactly the one
that that forms the pentamer this very

2904
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:49,570
that that forms the pentamer this very
 

2905
01:19:49,570 --> 01:19:53,880
that that forms the pentamer this very
nice pentameric ring and so you know so

2906
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:53,890
nice pentameric ring and so you know so
 

2907
01:19:53,890 --> 01:19:55,620
nice pentameric ring and so you know so
this is what we're trying to you know

2908
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:55,630
this is what we're trying to you know
 

2909
01:19:55,630 --> 01:19:57,630
this is what we're trying to you know
we're trying to put now all our

2910
01:19:57,630 --> 01:19:57,640
we're trying to put now all our
 

2911
01:19:57,640 --> 01:20:01,290
we're trying to put now all our
knowledge together and see whether we

2912
01:20:01,290 --> 01:20:01,300
knowledge together and see whether we
 

2913
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:04,530
knowledge together and see whether we
can actually generate this overall

2914
01:20:04,530 --> 01:20:04,540
can actually generate this overall
 

2915
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:11,540
can actually generate this overall
variant model with an idea to understand

2916
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:11,550
variant model with an idea to understand
 

2917
01:20:11,550 --> 01:20:14,190
variant model with an idea to understand
you know well first of all to understand

2918
01:20:14,190 --> 01:20:14,200
you know well first of all to understand
 

2919
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:17,430
you know well first of all to understand
how how it looks like how far it is from

2920
01:20:17,430 --> 01:20:17,440
how how it looks like how far it is from
 

2921
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:21,660
how how it looks like how far it is from
those images that were generated but I

2922
01:20:21,660 --> 01:20:21,670
those images that were generated but I
 

2923
01:20:21,670 --> 01:20:25,530
those images that were generated but I
mean the implications are you know there

2924
01:20:25,530 --> 01:20:25,540
mean the implications are you know there
 

2925
01:20:25,540 --> 01:20:28,910
mean the implications are you know there
is a potential for the you know

2926
01:20:28,910 --> 01:20:28,920
is a potential for the you know
 

2927
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:33,350
is a potential for the you know
nanoparticle design that will mimic this

2928
01:20:33,350 --> 01:20:33,360
nanoparticle design that will mimic this
 

2929
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:36,590
nanoparticle design that will mimic this
variant particle is the process of

2930
01:20:36,590 --> 01:20:36,600
variant particle is the process of
 

2931
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:39,690
variant particle is the process of
nanoparticle design meaning artificially

2932
01:20:39,690 --> 01:20:39,700
nanoparticle design meaning artificially
 

2933
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:41,220
nanoparticle design meaning artificially
designing something that looks similar

2934
01:20:41,220 --> 01:20:41,230
designing something that looks similar
 

2935
01:20:41,230 --> 01:20:44,370
designing something that looks similar
yes you know so the one that can

2936
01:20:44,370 --> 01:20:44,380
yes you know so the one that can
 

2937
01:20:44,380 --> 01:20:48,230
yes you know so the one that can
potentially compete with the actual

2938
01:20:48,230 --> 01:20:48,240
potentially compete with the actual
 

2939
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:52,560
potentially compete with the actual
variant particles and therefore reduce

2940
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:52,570
variant particles and therefore reduce
 

2941
01:20:52,570 --> 01:20:55,920
variant particles and therefore reduce
the effect of the infection so is this

2942
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:55,930
the effect of the infection so is this
 

2943
01:20:55,930 --> 01:20:59,520
the effect of the infection so is this
the idea of like what is a vaccine so

2944
01:20:59,520 --> 01:20:59,530
the idea of like what is a vaccine so
 

2945
01:20:59,530 --> 01:21:02,820
the idea of like what is a vaccine so
vaccine vaccine so so that yes so there

2946
01:21:02,820 --> 01:21:02,830
vaccine vaccine so so that yes so there
 

2947
01:21:02,830 --> 01:21:05,730
vaccine vaccine so so that yes so there
are two ways of essentially treating and

2948
01:21:05,730 --> 01:21:05,740
are two ways of essentially treating and
 

2949
01:21:05,740 --> 01:21:09,150
are two ways of essentially treating and
in the case of vaccine is preventing the

2950
01:21:09,150 --> 01:21:09,160
in the case of vaccine is preventing the
 

2951
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:15,000
in the case of vaccine is preventing the
infection so vaccine is you know a way

2952
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:15,010
infection so vaccine is you know a way
 

2953
01:21:15,010 --> 01:21:20,550
infection so vaccine is you know a way
to train our immune system so our immune

2954
01:21:20,550 --> 01:21:20,560
to train our immune system so our immune
 

2955
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:24,600
to train our immune system so our immune
system becomes aware of this new danger

2956
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:24,610
system becomes aware of this new danger
 

2957
01:21:24,610 --> 01:21:28,250
system becomes aware of this new danger
and therefore is capable of generating

2958
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:28,260
and therefore is capable of generating
 

2959
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:33,090
and therefore is capable of generating
the antibodies then we'll essentially

2960
01:21:33,090 --> 01:21:33,100
the antibodies then we'll essentially
 

2961
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:37,800
the antibodies then we'll essentially
bind to the spike proteins because

2962
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:37,810
bind to the spike proteins because
 

2963
01:21:37,810 --> 01:21:40,220
bind to the spike proteins because
that's the main target for the end of

2964
01:21:40,220 --> 01:21:40,230
that's the main target for the end of
 

2965
01:21:40,230 --> 01:21:46,500
that's the main target for the end of
for the vaccines design and block its

2966
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:46,510
for the vaccines design and block its
 

2967
01:21:46,510 --> 01:21:47,050
for the vaccines design and block its
found

2968
01:21:47,050 --> 01:21:47,060
found
 

2969
01:21:47,060 --> 01:21:50,630
found
if you have the spike with the antibody

2970
01:21:50,630 --> 01:21:50,640
if you have the spike with the antibody
 

2971
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:54,110
if you have the spike with the antibody
on top and can no longer interact with a

2972
01:21:54,110 --> 01:21:54,120
on top and can no longer interact with a
 

2973
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:59,270
on top and can no longer interact with a
co2 receptor so the the process of

2974
01:21:59,270 --> 01:21:59,280
co2 receptor so the the process of
 

2975
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:01,520
co2 receptor so the the process of
designing vaccine and is you have to

2976
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:01,530
designing vaccine and is you have to
 

2977
01:22:01,530 --> 01:22:03,050
designing vaccine and is you have to
understand enough about the structure

2978
01:22:03,050 --> 01:22:03,060
understand enough about the structure
 

2979
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:06,290
understand enough about the structure
the virus itself to be able to create an

2980
01:22:06,290 --> 01:22:06,300
the virus itself to be able to create an
 

2981
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:10,550
the virus itself to be able to create an
artificial our official particle well I

2982
01:22:10,550 --> 01:22:10,560
artificial our official particle well I
 

2983
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:13,400
artificial our official particle well I
mean so so so the nanoparticle is is a

2984
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:13,410
mean so so so the nanoparticle is is a
 

2985
01:22:13,410 --> 01:22:17,270
mean so so so the nanoparticle is is a
very exciting and new research so there

2986
01:22:17,270 --> 01:22:17,280
very exciting and new research so there
 

2987
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:20,780
very exciting and new research so there
are already established ways to you know

2988
01:22:20,780 --> 01:22:20,790
are already established ways to you know
 

2989
01:22:20,790 --> 01:22:24,140
are already established ways to you know
to make vaccines and several different

2990
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:24,150
to make vaccines and several different
 

2991
01:22:24,150 --> 01:22:28,060
to make vaccines and several different
ones right so so there is one where

2992
01:22:28,060 --> 01:22:28,070
ones right so so there is one where
 

2993
01:22:28,070 --> 01:22:31,820
ones right so so there is one where
essentially the the virus gets through

2994
01:22:31,820 --> 01:22:31,830
essentially the the virus gets through
 

2995
01:22:31,830 --> 01:22:35,000
essentially the the virus gets through
the cell culture multiple times so it

2996
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:35,010
the cell culture multiple times so it
 

2997
01:22:35,010 --> 01:22:36,680
the cell culture multiple times so it
becomes essentially account you know

2998
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:36,690
becomes essentially account you know
 

2999
01:22:36,690 --> 01:22:40,520
becomes essentially account you know
adjusted to the to the specific

3000
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:40,530
adjusted to the to the specific
 

3001
01:22:40,530 --> 01:22:43,820
adjusted to the to the specific
embryonic cell and as a result become

3002
01:22:43,820 --> 01:22:43,830
embryonic cell and as a result become
 

3003
01:22:43,830 --> 01:22:48,320
embryonic cell and as a result become
becomes less I you know compatible with

3004
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:48,330
becomes less I you know compatible with
 

3005
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:53,500
becomes less I you know compatible with
the you know host human cells so

3006
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:53,510
the you know host human cells so
 

3007
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:56,780
the you know host human cells so
therefore it's sort of the idea of the

3008
01:22:56,780 --> 01:22:56,790
therefore it's sort of the idea of the
 

3009
01:22:56,790 --> 01:23:00,950
therefore it's sort of the idea of the
life vaccine where the particles are

3010
01:23:00,950 --> 01:23:00,960
life vaccine where the particles are
 

3011
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:03,680
life vaccine where the particles are
there but they are not so efficient you

3012
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:03,690
there but they are not so efficient you
 

3013
01:23:03,690 --> 01:23:07,040
there but they are not so efficient you
know so they cannot replicate you know

3014
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:07,050
know so they cannot replicate you know
 

3015
01:23:07,050 --> 01:23:11,330
know so they cannot replicate you know
as rapidly as you know before the

3016
01:23:11,330 --> 01:23:11,340
as rapidly as you know before the
 

3017
01:23:11,340 --> 01:23:14,090
as rapidly as you know before the
vaccine and that they can be introduced

3018
01:23:14,090 --> 01:23:14,100
vaccine and that they can be introduced
 

3019
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:16,730
vaccine and that they can be introduced
to the immune system the immune system

3020
01:23:16,730 --> 01:23:16,740
to the immune system the immune system
 

3021
01:23:16,740 --> 01:23:21,320
to the immune system the immune system
will learn and the person who gets this

3022
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:21,330
will learn and the person who gets this
 

3023
01:23:21,330 --> 01:23:25,160
will learn and the person who gets this
vaccine one won't get you know sick or

3024
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:25,170
vaccine one won't get you know sick or
 

3025
01:23:25,170 --> 01:23:28,730
vaccine one won't get you know sick or
you know will have mild you know mild

3026
01:23:28,730 --> 01:23:28,740
you know will have mild you know mild
 

3027
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:31,040
you know will have mild you know mild
symptoms so then there is sort of

3028
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:31,050
symptoms so then there is sort of
 

3029
01:23:31,050 --> 01:23:33,910
symptoms so then there is sort of
different types of the way to introduce

3030
01:23:33,910 --> 01:23:33,920
different types of the way to introduce
 

3031
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:39,080
different types of the way to introduce
the non-functional non-functional part

3032
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:39,090
the non-functional non-functional part
 

3033
01:23:39,090 --> 01:23:43,400
the non-functional non-functional part
of this virus or the virus where some of

3034
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:43,410
of this virus or the virus where some of
 

3035
01:23:43,410 --> 01:23:45,830
of this virus or the virus where some of
the information is stripped down for

01:23:45,830 --> 01:23:45,840
the information is stripped down for
 

3037
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:49,460
the information is stripped down for
example device with no genetic material

01:23:49,460 --> 01:23:49,470
example device with no genetic material
 

3039
01:23:49,470 --> 01:23:52,670
example device with no genetic material
so so we ignore our age you know exactly

3040
01:23:52,670 --> 01:23:52,680
so so we ignore our age you know exactly
 

3041
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:54,620
so so we ignore our age you know exactly
so you cannot replicate it cannot

3042
01:23:54,620 --> 01:23:54,630
so you cannot replicate it cannot
 

3043
01:23:54,630 --> 01:23:57,950
so you cannot replicate it cannot

3051
01:24:04,979 --> 01:24:07,819
hurtle to design one of these to arrive
one of these is it the work that you're

3052
01:24:07,819 --> 01:24:07,829
one of these is it the work that you're
 

3053
01:24:07,829 --> 01:24:09,319
one of these is it the work that you're
doing in the fundamental understanding

3054
01:24:09,319 --> 01:24:09,329
doing in the fundamental understanding
 

3055
01:24:09,329 --> 01:24:13,040
doing in the fundamental understanding
of this new virus or is it in the from

3056
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:13,050
of this new virus or is it in the from
 

3057
01:24:13,050 --> 01:24:16,849
of this new virus or is it in the from
our perspective a complicated world of

3058
01:24:16,849 --> 01:24:16,859
our perspective a complicated world of
 

3059
01:24:16,859 --> 01:24:18,889
our perspective a complicated world of
experimental validation and sort of

3060
01:24:18,889 --> 01:24:18,899
experimental validation and sort of
 

3061
01:24:18,899 --> 01:24:20,750
experimental validation and sort of
showing that this like going through the

3062
01:24:20,750 --> 01:24:20,760
showing that this like going through the
 

3063
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:22,009
showing that this like going through the
whole process of showing this is

3064
01:24:22,009 --> 01:24:22,019
whole process of showing this is
 

3065
01:24:22,019 --> 01:24:23,810
whole process of showing this is
actually gonna work with FDA approval

3066
01:24:23,810 --> 01:24:23,820
actually gonna work with FDA approval
 

3067
01:24:23,820 --> 01:24:25,699
actually gonna work with FDA approval
all that kind of stuff I think it's both

3068
01:24:25,699 --> 01:24:25,709
all that kind of stuff I think it's both
 

3069
01:24:25,709 --> 01:24:28,939
all that kind of stuff I think it's both
I mean you know our understanding of the

3070
01:24:28,939 --> 01:24:28,949
I mean you know our understanding of the
 

3071
01:24:28,949 --> 01:24:31,459
I mean you know our understanding of the
molecular mechanisms will allow us to

3072
01:24:31,459 --> 01:24:31,469
molecular mechanisms will allow us to
 

3073
01:24:31,469 --> 01:24:34,279
molecular mechanisms will allow us to
you know to design to have more

3074
01:24:34,279 --> 01:24:34,289
you know to design to have more
 

3075
01:24:34,289 --> 01:24:38,169
you know to design to have more
efficient designs of the vaccines

3076
01:24:38,169 --> 01:24:38,179

 

3077
01:24:38,179 --> 01:24:40,819

however they once you design the vaccine

3078
01:24:40,819 --> 01:24:40,829
however they once you design the vaccine
 

3079
01:24:40,829 --> 01:24:43,579
however they once you design the vaccine
it it needs to be tested but when you

3080
01:24:43,579 --> 01:24:43,589
it it needs to be tested but when you
 

3081
01:24:43,589 --> 01:24:45,679
it it needs to be tested but when you
look at the 18 months and the different

3082
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:45,689
look at the 18 months and the different
 

3083
01:24:45,689 --> 01:24:47,209
look at the 18 months and the different
projections which seems like an

3084
01:24:47,209 --> 01:24:47,219
projections which seems like an
 

3085
01:24:47,219 --> 01:24:49,849
projections which seems like an
exceptionally from historically speaking

3086
01:24:49,849 --> 01:24:49,859
exceptionally from historically speaking
 

3087
01:24:49,859 --> 01:24:52,250
exceptionally from historically speaking
maybe you can correct me but it's even

3088
01:24:52,250 --> 01:24:52,260
maybe you can correct me but it's even
 

3089
01:24:52,260 --> 01:24:53,959
maybe you can correct me but it's even
18 months seems like a very accelerated

3090
01:24:53,959 --> 01:24:53,969
18 months seems like a very accelerated
 

3091
01:24:53,969 --> 01:24:57,679
18 months seems like a very accelerated
timeline it is it is I mean I remember

3092
01:24:57,679 --> 01:24:57,689
timeline it is it is I mean I remember
 

3093
01:24:57,689 --> 01:25:02,479
timeline it is it is I mean I remember
reading about the you know in a book

3094
01:25:02,479 --> 01:25:02,489
reading about the you know in a book
 

3095
01:25:02,489 --> 01:25:05,359
reading about the you know in a book
about some previous vaccines that it

3096
01:25:05,359 --> 01:25:05,369
about some previous vaccines that it
 

3097
01:25:05,369 --> 01:25:08,239
about some previous vaccines that it
could take up to 10 years to design and

3098
01:25:08,239 --> 01:25:08,249
could take up to 10 years to design and
 

3099
01:25:08,249 --> 01:25:12,619
could take up to 10 years to design and
you know properly test a vaccine before

3100
01:25:12,619 --> 01:25:12,629
you know properly test a vaccine before
 

3101
01:25:12,629 --> 01:25:15,859
you know properly test a vaccine before
its mass production so yeah we you know

3102
01:25:15,859 --> 01:25:15,869
its mass production so yeah we you know
 

3103
01:25:15,869 --> 01:25:18,669
its mass production so yeah we you know
everything is accelerated these days I

3104
01:25:18,669 --> 01:25:18,679
everything is accelerated these days I
 

3105
01:25:18,679 --> 01:25:21,919
everything is accelerated these days I
mean for better for worse but but you

3106
01:25:21,919 --> 01:25:21,929
mean for better for worse but but you
 

3107
01:25:21,929 --> 01:25:24,109
mean for better for worse but but you
know we we definitely need that well

3108
01:25:24,109 --> 01:25:24,119
know we we definitely need that well
 

3109
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:25,729
know we we definitely need that well
especially the corner virus and in the

3110
01:25:25,729 --> 01:25:25,739
especially the corner virus and in the
 

3111
01:25:25,739 --> 01:25:27,139
especially the corner virus and in the
scientific community is really stepping

3112
01:25:27,139 --> 01:25:27,149
scientific community is really stepping
 

3113
01:25:27,149 --> 01:25:28,549
scientific community is really stepping
up and working together the

3114
01:25:28,549 --> 01:25:28,559
up and working together the
 

3115
01:25:28,559 --> 01:25:29,599
up and working together the
collaborative aspect is really

3116
01:25:29,599 --> 01:25:29,609
collaborative aspect is really
 

3117
01:25:29,609 --> 01:25:32,449
collaborative aspect is really
interesting you mentioned so the vaccine

3118
01:25:32,449 --> 01:25:32,459
interesting you mentioned so the vaccine
 

3119
01:25:32,459 --> 01:25:34,669
interesting you mentioned so the vaccine
is one and then there's antivirals

3120
01:25:34,669 --> 01:25:34,679
is one and then there's antivirals
 

3121
01:25:34,679 --> 01:25:37,429
is one and then there's antivirals
antiviral drugs so antiviral drugs so

3122
01:25:37,429 --> 01:25:37,439
antiviral drugs so antiviral drugs so
 

3123
01:25:37,439 --> 01:25:40,219
antiviral drugs so antiviral drugs so
we're you know vaccines are typically

3124
01:25:40,219 --> 01:25:40,229
we're you know vaccines are typically
 

3125
01:25:40,229 --> 01:25:42,349
we're you know vaccines are typically
needed to prevent the infection right

3126
01:25:42,349 --> 01:25:42,359
needed to prevent the infection right
 

3127
01:25:42,359 --> 01:25:45,109
needed to prevent the infection right
but once you have an infection one you

3128
01:25:45,109 --> 01:25:45,119
but once you have an infection one you
 

3129
01:25:45,119 --> 01:25:48,139
but once you have an infection one you
know so what we try to do try to stop it

3130
01:25:48,139 --> 01:25:48,149
know so what we try to do try to stop it
 

3131
01:25:48,149 --> 01:25:51,349
know so what we try to do try to stop it
so we try to stop virus from functioning

3132
01:25:51,349 --> 01:25:51,359
so we try to stop virus from functioning
 

3133
01:25:51,359 --> 01:25:54,889
so we try to stop virus from functioning
and so the antiviral drugs are designed

3134
01:25:54,889 --> 01:25:54,899
and so the antiviral drugs are designed
 

3135
01:25:54,899 --> 01:26:01,060
and so the antiviral drugs are designed
to block some critical function of the

3136
01:26:01,060 --> 01:26:01,070
to block some critical function of the
 

3137
01:26:01,070 --> 01:26:05,869
to block some critical function of the
of the proteins from the viral from the

3138
01:26:05,869 --> 01:26:05,879
of the proteins from the viral from the
 

3139
01:26:05,879 --> 01:26:09,649
of the proteins from the viral from the
virus so there are a number of

3140
01:26:09,649 --> 01:26:09,659
virus so there are a number of
 

3141
01:26:09,659 --> 01:26:13,069
virus so there are a number of
interesting candidates and I think you

3142
01:26:13,069 --> 01:26:13,079
interesting candidates and I think you
 

3143
01:26:13,079 --> 01:26:14,480
interesting candidates and I think you
know if you

3144
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:14,490
know if you
 

3145
01:26:14,490 --> 01:26:21,350
know if you
ask me I you know I think remedy severe

3146
01:26:21,350 --> 01:26:21,360
ask me I you know I think remedy severe
 

3147
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:26,870
ask me I you know I think remedy severe
is perhaps the most promising it's it

3148
01:26:26,870 --> 01:26:26,880
is perhaps the most promising it's it
 

3149
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:31,610
is perhaps the most promising it's it
has been shown to be you know an

3150
01:26:31,610 --> 01:26:31,620
has been shown to be you know an
 

3151
01:26:31,620 --> 01:26:36,100
has been shown to be you know an
efficient and effective antiviral for

3152
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:36,110
efficient and effective antiviral for
 

3153
01:26:36,110 --> 01:26:41,600
efficient and effective antiviral for
SARS originally it was the the antiviral

3154
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:41,610
SARS originally it was the the antiviral
 

3155
01:26:41,610 --> 01:26:45,670
SARS originally it was the the antiviral
drug developed for completely different

3156
01:26:45,670 --> 01:26:45,680
drug developed for completely different
 

3157
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:49,040
drug developed for completely different
virus I think for a ball and bar Marburg

3158
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:49,050
virus I think for a ball and bar Marburg
 

3159
01:26:49,050 --> 01:26:51,770
virus I think for a ball and bar Marburg
and high level you know how it works so

3160
01:26:51,770 --> 01:26:51,780
and high level you know how it works so
 

3161
01:26:51,780 --> 01:26:57,890
and high level you know how it works so
it tries to mimic one of the nucleotides

3162
01:26:57,890 --> 01:26:57,900
it tries to mimic one of the nucleotides
 

3163
01:26:57,900 --> 01:27:03,020
it tries to mimic one of the nucleotides
in RNA and essentially that that stops

3164
01:27:03,020 --> 01:27:03,030
in RNA and essentially that that stops
 

3165
01:27:03,030 --> 01:27:06,620
in RNA and essentially that that stops
the replication from so messes I guess

3166
01:27:06,620 --> 01:27:06,630
the replication from so messes I guess
 

3167
01:27:06,630 --> 01:27:08,810
the replication from so messes I guess
that's what so anywhere all drugs mess

3168
01:27:08,810 --> 01:27:08,820
that's what so anywhere all drugs mess
 

3169
01:27:08,820 --> 01:27:11,840
that's what so anywhere all drugs mess
some aspect of this yes process so you

3170
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:11,850
some aspect of this yes process so you
 

3171
01:27:11,850 --> 01:27:14,030
some aspect of this yes process so you
know so essentially we try to stop

3172
01:27:14,030 --> 01:27:14,040
know so essentially we try to stop
 

3173
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:17,990
know so essentially we try to stop
certain functions of the virus there are

3174
01:27:17,990 --> 01:27:18,000
certain functions of the virus there are
 

3175
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:22,850
certain functions of the virus there are
some other ones you know that are

3176
01:27:22,850 --> 01:27:22,860
some other ones you know that are
 

3177
01:27:22,860 --> 01:27:27,290
some other ones you know that are
designed to inhibit the protease the the

3178
01:27:27,290 --> 01:27:27,300
designed to inhibit the protease the the
 

3179
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:32,330
designed to inhibit the protease the the
thing that clips protein sequences there

3180
01:27:32,330 --> 01:27:32,340
thing that clips protein sequences there
 

3181
01:27:32,340 --> 01:27:35,950
thing that clips protein sequences there
is one that was originally designed for

3182
01:27:35,950 --> 01:27:35,960
is one that was originally designed for
 

3183
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:39,490
is one that was originally designed for
malaria which is a bacterial you know

3184
01:27:39,490 --> 01:27:39,500
malaria which is a bacterial you know
 

3185
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:43,310
malaria which is a bacterial you know
bacterial disease so this is so cool so

3186
01:27:43,310 --> 01:27:43,320
bacterial disease so this is so cool so
 

3187
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:45,200
bacterial disease so this is so cool so
but that's exactly where your work steps

3188
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:45,210
but that's exactly where your work steps
 

3189
01:27:45,210 --> 01:27:47,710
but that's exactly where your work steps
in is you're figuring out the functional

3190
01:27:47,710 --> 01:27:47,720
in is you're figuring out the functional
 

3191
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:50,600
in is you're figuring out the functional
then the structure these different so

3192
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:50,610
then the structure these different so
 

3193
01:27:50,610 --> 01:27:52,880
then the structure these different so
like providing candidates for where

3194
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:52,890
like providing candidates for where
 

3195
01:27:52,890 --> 01:27:55,400
like providing candidates for where
drugs can plug in exactly well yes

3196
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:55,410
drugs can plug in exactly well yes
 

3197
01:27:55,410 --> 01:27:59,900
drugs can plug in exactly well yes
because you know one thing that we don't

3198
01:27:59,900 --> 01:27:59,910
because you know one thing that we don't
 

3199
01:27:59,910 --> 01:28:03,050
because you know one thing that we don't
know is whether or not so let's say we

3200
01:28:03,050 --> 01:28:03,060
know is whether or not so let's say we
 

3201
01:28:03,060 --> 01:28:05,480
know is whether or not so let's say we
have a perfect drug candidate that is

3202
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:05,490
have a perfect drug candidate that is
 

3203
01:28:05,490 --> 01:28:08,300
have a perfect drug candidate that is
efficient against SARS and again Smurfs

3204
01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:08,310
efficient against SARS and again Smurfs
 

3205
01:28:08,310 --> 01:28:12,070
efficient against SARS and again Smurfs
now is it going to be efficient against

3206
01:28:12,070 --> 01:28:12,080
now is it going to be efficient against
 

3207
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:16,010
now is it going to be efficient against
New South Korea too we don't know that

3208
01:28:16,010 --> 01:28:16,020
New South Korea too we don't know that
 

3209
01:28:16,020 --> 01:28:20,360
New South Korea too we don't know that
and there are multiple aspects that can

3210
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:20,370
and there are multiple aspects that can
 

3211
01:28:20,370 --> 01:28:24,260
and there are multiple aspects that can
affect this efficiency so for instance

3212
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:24,270
affect this efficiency so for instance
 

3213
01:28:24,270 --> 01:28:28,250
affect this efficiency so for instance
if the the binding site so the the part

3214
01:28:28,250 --> 01:28:28,260
if the the binding site so the the part
 

3215
01:28:28,260 --> 01:28:30,919
if the the binding site so the the part
of the protein where this ligand gets

3216
01:28:30,919 --> 01:28:30,929
of the protein where this ligand gets
 

3217
01:28:30,929 --> 01:28:34,970
of the protein where this ligand gets
attached if this site is mutated then

3218
01:28:34,970 --> 01:28:34,980
attached if this site is mutated then
 

3219
01:28:34,980 --> 01:28:38,299
attached if this site is mutated then
the ligand may not be attachable to this

3220
01:28:38,299 --> 01:28:38,309
the ligand may not be attachable to this
 

3221
01:28:38,309 --> 01:28:43,520
the ligand may not be attachable to this
part any longer and you know our work

3222
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:43,530
part any longer and you know our work
 

3223
01:28:43,530 --> 01:28:45,890
part any longer and you know our work
and the work of other by informatics

3224
01:28:45,890 --> 01:28:45,900
and the work of other by informatics
 

3225
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:49,850
and the work of other by informatics
groups you know essentially are trying

3226
01:28:49,850 --> 01:28:49,860
groups you know essentially are trying
 

3227
01:28:49,860 --> 01:28:52,580
groups you know essentially are trying
to understand whether or not that will

3228
01:28:52,580 --> 01:28:52,590
to understand whether or not that will
 

3229
01:28:52,590 --> 01:28:57,200
to understand whether or not that will
be the case or and it looks like for for

3230
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:57,210
be the case or and it looks like for for
 

3231
01:28:57,210 --> 01:29:02,540
be the case or and it looks like for for
the ligands that we looked at the ligand

3232
01:29:02,540 --> 01:29:02,550
the ligands that we looked at the ligand
 

3233
01:29:02,550 --> 01:29:05,140
the ligands that we looked at the ligand
binding sites are pretty much intact

3234
01:29:05,140 --> 01:29:05,150
binding sites are pretty much intact
 

3235
01:29:05,150 --> 01:29:08,029
binding sites are pretty much intact
which is very promising so if we can

3236
01:29:08,029 --> 01:29:08,039
which is very promising so if we can
 

3237
01:29:08,039 --> 01:29:10,520
which is very promising so if we can
just like zoom out for a second

3238
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:10,530
just like zoom out for a second
 

3239
01:29:10,530 --> 01:29:17,330
just like zoom out for a second
what are you optimistic so this - well

3240
01:29:17,330 --> 01:29:17,340
what are you optimistic so this - well
 

3241
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:19,430
what are you optimistic so this - well
there's three possible ends - the corona

3242
01:29:19,430 --> 01:29:19,440
there's three possible ends - the corona
 

3243
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:23,540
there's three possible ends - the corona
virus pandemic so one is there's or

3244
01:29:23,540 --> 01:29:23,550
virus pandemic so one is there's or
 

3245
01:29:23,550 --> 01:29:27,290
virus pandemic so one is there's or
drugs or vaccines get figured out very

3246
01:29:27,290 --> 01:29:27,300
drugs or vaccines get figured out very
 

3247
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:30,830
drugs or vaccines get figured out very
quickly probably drugs first the other

3248
01:29:30,830 --> 01:29:30,840
quickly probably drugs first the other
 

3249
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:35,020
quickly probably drugs first the other
is the the the pandemic runs its course

3250
01:29:35,020 --> 01:29:35,030
is the the the pandemic runs its course
 

3251
01:29:35,030 --> 01:29:38,689
is the the the pandemic runs its course
for this wave at least and then the the

3252
01:29:38,689 --> 01:29:38,699
for this wave at least and then the the
 

3253
01:29:38,699 --> 01:29:42,589
for this wave at least and then the the
third is you know things go much worse

3254
01:29:42,589 --> 01:29:42,599
third is you know things go much worse
 

3255
01:29:42,599 --> 01:29:45,620
third is you know things go much worse
and some in some dark bad very bad

3256
01:29:45,620 --> 01:29:45,630
and some in some dark bad very bad
 

3257
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:48,950
and some in some dark bad very bad
direction do you see let's focus on the

3258
01:29:48,950 --> 01:29:48,960
direction do you see let's focus on the
 

3259
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:53,270
direction do you see let's focus on the
first two do you see the anti-drugs of

3260
01:29:53,270 --> 01:29:53,280
first two do you see the anti-drugs of
 

3261
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:57,319
first two do you see the anti-drugs of
the work you're doing being relevant for

3262
01:29:57,319 --> 01:29:57,329
the work you're doing being relevant for
 

3263
01:29:57,329 --> 01:30:03,529
the work you're doing being relevant for
us right now in stopping the pandemic or

3264
01:30:03,529 --> 01:30:03,539
us right now in stopping the pandemic or
 

3265
01:30:03,539 --> 01:30:05,930
us right now in stopping the pandemic or
do you hope that the pandemic will run

3266
01:30:05,930 --> 01:30:05,940
do you hope that the pandemic will run
 

3267
01:30:05,940 --> 01:30:06,770
do you hope that the pandemic will run
its course

3268
01:30:06,770 --> 01:30:06,780
its course
 

3269
01:30:06,780 --> 01:30:10,810
its course
so the social distancing things like

3270
01:30:10,810 --> 01:30:10,820
so the social distancing things like
 

3271
01:30:10,820 --> 01:30:13,430
so the social distancing things like
wearing masks all those discussions that

3272
01:30:13,430 --> 01:30:13,440
wearing masks all those discussions that
 

3273
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:17,180
wearing masks all those discussions that
we're having will be the the method with

3274
01:30:17,180 --> 01:30:17,190
we're having will be the the method with
 

3275
01:30:17,190 --> 01:30:20,419
we're having will be the the method with
which we fight coronavirus in the short

3276
01:30:20,419 --> 01:30:20,429
which we fight coronavirus in the short
 

3277
01:30:20,429 --> 01:30:23,779
which we fight coronavirus in the short
term or do you think that it'll have to

3278
01:30:23,779 --> 01:30:23,789
term or do you think that it'll have to
 

3279
01:30:23,789 --> 01:30:28,790
term or do you think that it'll have to
be antiviral drugs I think I think

3280
01:30:28,790 --> 01:30:28,800
be antiviral drugs I think I think
 

3281
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:33,680
be antiviral drugs I think I think
antivirals would be I would view that as

3282
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:33,690
antivirals would be I would view that as
 

3283
01:30:33,690 --> 01:30:36,979
antivirals would be I would view that as
the at least the short term solution I

3284
01:30:36,979 --> 01:30:36,989
the at least the short term solution I
 

3285
01:30:36,989 --> 01:30:40,950
the at least the short term solution I
see more and more cases in

3286
01:30:40,950 --> 01:30:40,960
see more and more cases in
 

3287
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:45,810
see more and more cases in
news of those new drug candidates been

3288
01:30:45,810 --> 01:30:45,820
news of those new drug candidates been
 

3289
01:30:45,820 --> 01:30:51,290
news of those new drug candidates been
administered in hospitals and I mean

3290
01:30:51,290 --> 01:30:51,300
administered in hospitals and I mean
 

3291
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:55,320
administered in hospitals and I mean
this is right now the best what we have

3292
01:30:55,320 --> 01:30:55,330
this is right now the best what we have
 

3293
01:30:55,330 --> 01:30:58,920
this is right now the best what we have
but do we need it to reopen the economy

3294
01:30:58,920 --> 01:30:58,930
but do we need it to reopen the economy
 

3295
01:30:58,930 --> 01:31:03,170
but do we need it to reopen the economy
I mean we definitely need it i i cannot

3296
01:31:03,170 --> 01:31:03,180
I mean we definitely need it i i cannot
 

3297
01:31:03,180 --> 01:31:07,140
I mean we definitely need it i i cannot
sort of speculate on how that will

3298
01:31:07,140 --> 01:31:07,150
sort of speculate on how that will
 

3299
01:31:07,150 --> 01:31:10,440
sort of speculate on how that will
affect reopening of the economy because

3300
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:10,450
affect reopening of the economy because
 

3301
01:31:10,450 --> 01:31:14,840
affect reopening of the economy because
we are you know we are kind of deep in

3302
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:14,850
we are you know we are kind of deep in
 

3303
01:31:14,850 --> 01:31:17,940
we are you know we are kind of deep in
into the pandemic and it's not just the

3304
01:31:17,940 --> 01:31:17,950
into the pandemic and it's not just the
 

3305
01:31:17,950 --> 01:31:21,200
into the pandemic and it's not just the
the states it's also you know worldwide

3306
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:21,210
the states it's also you know worldwide
 

3307
01:31:21,210 --> 01:31:26,940
the states it's also you know worldwide
you know of course you know there is

3308
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:26,950
you know of course you know there is
 

3309
01:31:26,950 --> 01:31:29,370
you know of course you know there is
also the possibility of the second wave

3310
01:31:29,370 --> 01:31:29,380
also the possibility of the second wave
 

3311
01:31:29,380 --> 01:31:35,520
also the possibility of the second wave
as we you know as you mentioned and this

3312
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:35,530
as we you know as you mentioned and this
 

3313
01:31:35,530 --> 01:31:39,690
as we you know as you mentioned and this
is why you know we need to be super

3314
01:31:39,690 --> 01:31:39,700
is why you know we need to be super
 

3315
01:31:39,700 --> 01:31:45,979
is why you know we need to be super
careful we need to follow all the

3316
01:31:45,979 --> 01:31:45,989
careful we need to follow all the
 

3317
01:31:45,989 --> 01:31:49,470
careful we need to follow all the
precautions that the doctors tell us to

3318
01:31:49,470 --> 01:31:49,480
precautions that the doctors tell us to
 

3319
01:31:49,480 --> 01:31:52,680
precautions that the doctors tell us to
do are you worried about the mutation

3320
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:52,690
do are you worried about the mutation
 

3321
01:31:52,690 --> 01:31:57,540
do are you worried about the mutation
the virus so it's of course a real

3322
01:31:57,540 --> 01:31:57,550
the virus so it's of course a real
 

3323
01:31:57,550 --> 01:32:03,080
the virus so it's of course a real
possibility now how to what extent this

3324
01:32:03,080 --> 01:32:03,090
possibility now how to what extent this
 

3325
01:32:03,090 --> 01:32:06,570
possibility now how to what extent this
virus can mutate it's an open question I

3326
01:32:06,570 --> 01:32:06,580
virus can mutate it's an open question I
 

3327
01:32:06,580 --> 01:32:10,140
virus can mutate it's an open question I
mean we know that it is able to mutate

3328
01:32:10,140 --> 01:32:10,150
mean we know that it is able to mutate
 

3329
01:32:10,150 --> 01:32:13,380
mean we know that it is able to mutate
to jump from one species to another and

3330
01:32:13,380 --> 01:32:13,390
to jump from one species to another and
 

3331
01:32:13,390 --> 01:32:17,660
to jump from one species to another and
to to become transmissible between

3332
01:32:17,660 --> 01:32:17,670
to to become transmissible between
 

3333
01:32:17,670 --> 01:32:22,400
to to become transmissible between
humans right so will it you know so

3334
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:22,410
humans right so will it you know so
 

3335
01:32:22,410 --> 01:32:25,050
humans right so will it you know so
let's imagine that we have the new

3336
01:32:25,050 --> 01:32:25,060
let's imagine that we have the new
 

3337
01:32:25,060 --> 01:32:30,020
let's imagine that we have the new
antiviral will this virus become

3338
01:32:30,020 --> 01:32:30,030
antiviral will this virus become
 

3339
01:32:30,030 --> 01:32:32,940
antiviral will this virus become
eventually resistant to this antiviral

3340
01:32:32,940 --> 01:32:32,950
eventually resistant to this antiviral
 

3341
01:32:32,950 --> 01:32:35,580
eventually resistant to this antiviral
we don't know I mean this is what needs

3342
01:32:35,580 --> 01:32:35,590
we don't know I mean this is what needs
 

3343
01:32:35,590 --> 01:32:38,209
we don't know I mean this is what needs
to be studied this is such a beautiful

3344
01:32:38,209 --> 01:32:38,219
to be studied this is such a beautiful
 

3345
01:32:38,219 --> 01:32:42,090
to be studied this is such a beautiful
and terrifying process that a virus some

3346
01:32:42,090 --> 01:32:42,100
and terrifying process that a virus some
 

3347
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:46,200
and terrifying process that a virus some
viruses may be able to mutate to respond

3348
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:46,210
viruses may be able to mutate to respond
 

3349
01:32:46,210 --> 01:32:50,700
viruses may be able to mutate to respond
to the mutate around the thing we've put

3350
01:32:50,700 --> 01:32:50,710
to the mutate around the thing we've put
 

3351
01:32:50,710 --> 01:32:53,580
to the mutate around the thing we've put
before it can you explain that process

3352
01:32:53,580 --> 01:32:53,590
before it can you explain that process
 

3353
01:32:53,590 --> 01:32:54,610
before it can you explain that process
like how does that happen

3354
01:32:54,610 --> 01:32:54,620
like how does that happen
 

3355
01:32:54,620 --> 01:32:57,630
like how does that happen
just is that just the way of evolution I

3356
01:32:57,630 --> 01:32:57,640
just is that just the way of evolution I
 

3357
01:32:57,640 --> 01:33:01,030
just is that just the way of evolution I
would say so yes I mean it's it's the

3358
01:33:01,030 --> 01:33:01,040
would say so yes I mean it's it's the
 

3359
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:04,620
would say so yes I mean it's it's the
evolutionary mechanisms there is nothing

3360
01:33:04,620 --> 01:33:04,630
evolutionary mechanisms there is nothing
 

3361
01:33:04,630 --> 01:33:08,320
evolutionary mechanisms there is nothing
imprinted into this virus that makes it

3362
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:08,330
imprinted into this virus that makes it
 

3363
01:33:08,330 --> 01:33:12,940
imprinted into this virus that makes it
you know it just the way it it walls and

3364
01:33:12,940 --> 01:33:12,950
you know it just the way it it walls and
 

3365
01:33:12,950 --> 01:33:16,180
you know it just the way it it walls and
actually it's the way it Cory walls with

3366
01:33:16,180 --> 01:33:16,190
actually it's the way it Cory walls with
 

3367
01:33:16,190 --> 01:33:20,170
actually it's the way it Cory walls with
its host it's just amazing it's

3368
01:33:20,170 --> 01:33:20,180
its host it's just amazing it's
 

3369
01:33:20,180 --> 01:33:22,240
its host it's just amazing it's
especially the evolution mechanism is

3370
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:22,250
especially the evolution mechanism is
 

3371
01:33:22,250 --> 01:33:26,080
especially the evolution mechanism is
especially amazing given how simple the

3372
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:26,090
especially amazing given how simple the
 

3373
01:33:26,090 --> 01:33:31,210
especially amazing given how simple the
virus is it's incredible that it's I

3374
01:33:31,210 --> 01:33:31,220
virus is it's incredible that it's I
 

3375
01:33:31,220 --> 01:33:32,590
virus is it's incredible that it's I
mean it's beautiful

3376
01:33:32,590 --> 01:33:32,600
mean it's beautiful
 

3377
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:35,260
mean it's beautiful
it's beautiful because it's the one of

3378
01:33:35,260 --> 01:33:35,270
it's beautiful because it's the one of
 

3379
01:33:35,270 --> 01:33:36,850
it's beautiful because it's the one of
the cleanest examples of evolution

3380
01:33:36,850 --> 01:33:36,860
the cleanest examples of evolution
 

3381
01:33:36,860 --> 01:33:40,630
the cleanest examples of evolution
working well I think I mean the one of

3382
01:33:40,630 --> 01:33:40,640
working well I think I mean the one of
 

3383
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:45,070
working well I think I mean the one of
the sort of the reasons for its

3384
01:33:45,070 --> 01:33:45,080
the sort of the reasons for its
 

3385
01:33:45,080 --> 01:33:47,800
the sort of the reasons for its
simplicity is because it does not

3386
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:47,810
simplicity is because it does not
 

3387
01:33:47,810 --> 01:33:52,240
simplicity is because it does not
require all the necessary functions to

3388
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:52,250
require all the necessary functions to
 

3389
01:33:52,250 --> 01:33:55,390
require all the necessary functions to
be stored right so it actually can

3390
01:33:55,390 --> 01:33:55,400
be stored right so it actually can
 

3391
01:33:55,400 --> 01:33:58,660
be stored right so it actually can
hijack they may the majority of the

3392
01:33:58,660 --> 01:33:58,670
hijack they may the majority of the
 

3393
01:33:58,670 --> 01:34:00,310
hijack they may the majority of the
necessary function from the host cell

3394
01:34:00,310 --> 01:34:00,320
necessary function from the host cell
 

3395
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:04,000
necessary function from the host cell
and it's so so so so the ability to do

3396
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:04,010
and it's so so so so the ability to do
 

3397
01:34:04,010 --> 01:34:08,110
and it's so so so so the ability to do
so in my view reduces the complexity of

3398
01:34:08,110 --> 01:34:08,120
so in my view reduces the complexity of
 

3399
01:34:08,120 --> 01:34:13,210
so in my view reduces the complexity of
this machine drastically although if you

3400
01:34:13,210 --> 01:34:13,220
this machine drastically although if you
 

3401
01:34:13,220 --> 01:34:15,250
this machine drastically although if you
look at the you know most recent

3402
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:15,260
look at the you know most recent
 

3403
01:34:15,260 --> 01:34:17,770
look at the you know most recent
discoveries right so the scientists

3404
01:34:17,770 --> 01:34:17,780
discoveries right so the scientists
 

3405
01:34:17,780 --> 01:34:21,280
discoveries right so the scientists
discovered viruses that are as large as

3406
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:21,290
discovered viruses that are as large as
 

3407
01:34:21,290 --> 01:34:24,520
discovered viruses that are as large as
bacteria right so this mini viruses and

3408
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:24,530
bacteria right so this mini viruses and
 

3409
01:34:24,530 --> 01:34:28,480
bacteria right so this mini viruses and
Mama viruses it actually those

3410
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:28,490
Mama viruses it actually those
 

3411
01:34:28,490 --> 01:34:31,810
Mama viruses it actually those
discoveries made scientists to

3412
01:34:31,810 --> 01:34:31,820
discoveries made scientists to
 

3413
01:34:31,820 --> 01:34:36,880
discoveries made scientists to
reconsider the origins of the virus you

3414
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:36,890
reconsider the origins of the virus you
 

3415
01:34:36,890 --> 01:34:39,000
reconsider the origins of the virus you
know and what are the mechanisms and how

3416
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:39,010
know and what are the mechanisms and how
 

3417
01:34:39,010 --> 01:34:42,880
know and what are the mechanisms and how
you know what are the mechanisms the

3418
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:42,890
you know what are the mechanisms the
 

3419
01:34:42,890 --> 01:34:44,800
you know what are the mechanisms the
evolution mechanisms that leads to the

3420
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:44,810
evolution mechanisms that leads to the
 

3421
01:34:44,810 --> 01:34:47,320
evolution mechanisms that leads to the
appearance of the viruses by the way I

3422
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:47,330
appearance of the viruses by the way I
 

3423
01:34:47,330 --> 01:34:49,620
appearance of the viruses by the way I
mean you did mention that viruses are I

3424
01:34:49,620 --> 01:34:49,630
mean you did mention that viruses are I
 

3425
01:34:49,630 --> 01:34:51,910
mean you did mention that viruses are I
think you mentioned that they're now

3426
01:34:51,910 --> 01:34:51,920
think you mentioned that they're now
 

3427
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:54,670
think you mentioned that they're now
living yes they are not living organisms

3428
01:34:54,670 --> 01:34:54,680
living yes they are not living organisms
 

3429
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:57,970
living yes they are not living organisms
so let me ask that questioning and why

3430
01:34:57,970 --> 01:34:57,980
so let me ask that questioning and why
 

3431
01:34:57,980 --> 01:34:59,470
so let me ask that questioning and why
do you think they're not living

3432
01:34:59,470 --> 01:34:59,480
do you think they're not living
 

3433
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:02,920
do you think they're not living
organisms well because they they are

3434
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:02,930
organisms well because they they are
 

3435
01:35:02,930 --> 01:35:05,060
organisms well because they they are
dependent

3436
01:35:05,060 --> 01:35:05,070
dependent
 

3437
01:35:05,070 --> 01:35:07,700
dependent
the majority of the functions of the

3438
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:07,710
the majority of the functions of the
 

3439
01:35:07,710 --> 01:35:12,380
the majority of the functions of the
virus are dependent on the on the host

3440
01:35:12,380 --> 01:35:12,390
virus are dependent on the on the host
 

3441
01:35:12,390 --> 01:35:15,590
virus are dependent on the on the host
so let me do the devil's advocate let me

3442
01:35:15,590 --> 01:35:15,600
so let me do the devil's advocate let me
 

3443
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:19,010
so let me do the devil's advocate let me
be the philosophical that was advocate

3444
01:35:19,010 --> 01:35:19,020
be the philosophical that was advocate
 

3445
01:35:19,020 --> 01:35:21,980
be the philosophical that was advocate
here and say while humans which we would

3446
01:35:21,980 --> 01:35:21,990
here and say while humans which we would
 

3447
01:35:21,990 --> 01:35:26,540
here and say while humans which we would
say our living need our host planet to

3448
01:35:26,540 --> 01:35:26,550
say our living need our host planet to
 

3449
01:35:26,550 --> 01:35:30,800
say our living need our host planet to
survive so you can basically take every

3450
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:30,810
survive so you can basically take every
 

3451
01:35:30,810 --> 01:35:33,320
survive so you can basically take every
living organism that we think of as

3452
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:33,330
living organism that we think of as
 

3453
01:35:33,330 --> 01:35:36,170
living organism that we think of as
definitively living it's always going to

3454
01:35:36,170 --> 01:35:36,180
definitively living it's always going to
 

3455
01:35:36,180 --> 01:35:39,410
definitively living it's always going to
have some aspects of it this host that

3456
01:35:39,410 --> 01:35:39,420
have some aspects of it this host that
 

3457
01:35:39,420 --> 01:35:44,660
have some aspects of it this host that
it needs of its environment so is that

3458
01:35:44,660 --> 01:35:44,670
it needs of its environment so is that
 

3459
01:35:44,670 --> 01:35:48,110
it needs of its environment so is that
really the key aspect of why a virus is

3460
01:35:48,110 --> 01:35:48,120
really the key aspect of why a virus is
 

3461
01:35:48,120 --> 01:35:50,570
really the key aspect of why a virus is
that dependence because it seems to be

3462
01:35:50,570 --> 01:35:50,580
that dependence because it seems to be
 

3463
01:35:50,580 --> 01:35:55,340
that dependence because it seems to be
very good at doing so many things that

3464
01:35:55,340 --> 01:35:55,350
very good at doing so many things that
 

3465
01:35:55,350 --> 01:35:58,580
very good at doing so many things that
we consider to be intelligent it's just

3466
01:35:58,580 --> 01:35:58,590
we consider to be intelligent it's just
 

3467
01:35:58,590 --> 01:36:02,870
we consider to be intelligent it's just
that dependence part well I mean it yeah

3468
01:36:02,870 --> 01:36:02,880
that dependence part well I mean it yeah
 

3469
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:10,400
that dependence part well I mean it yeah
it's it's difficult to answer in this

3470
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:10,410
it's it's difficult to answer in this
 

3471
01:36:10,410 --> 01:36:14,420
it's it's difficult to answer in this
way I mean I the way I think about the

3472
01:36:14,420 --> 01:36:14,430
way I mean I the way I think about the
 

3473
01:36:14,430 --> 01:36:18,940
way I mean I the way I think about the
virus is you know in order for it to

3474
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:18,950
virus is you know in order for it to
 

3475
01:36:18,950 --> 01:36:25,580
virus is you know in order for it to
function it needs to have the critical

3476
01:36:25,580 --> 01:36:25,590
function it needs to have the critical
 

3477
01:36:25,590 --> 01:36:29,780
function it needs to have the critical
component the critical tools that it

3478
01:36:29,780 --> 01:36:29,790
component the critical tools that it
 

3479
01:36:29,790 --> 01:36:35,780
component the critical tools that it
doesn't have so I mean that's that's you

3480
01:36:35,780 --> 01:36:35,790
doesn't have so I mean that's that's you
 

3481
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:41,030
doesn't have so I mean that's that's you
know in my way you know the it's not

3482
01:36:41,030 --> 01:36:41,040
know in my way you know the it's not
 

3483
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:44,180
know in my way you know the it's not
autonomous I sense and that that's how I

3484
01:36:44,180 --> 01:36:44,190
autonomous I sense and that that's how I
 

3485
01:36:44,190 --> 01:36:47,120
autonomous I sense and that that's how I
separate the the idea of the living work

3486
01:36:47,120 --> 01:36:47,130
separate the the idea of the living work
 

3487
01:36:47,130 --> 01:36:49,610
separate the the idea of the living work
is on a very high level yes between the

3488
01:36:49,610 --> 01:36:49,620
is on a very high level yes between the
 

3489
01:36:49,620 --> 01:36:53,210
is on a very high level yes between the
living organism and and you have some no

3490
01:36:53,210 --> 01:36:53,220
living organism and and you have some no
 

3491
01:36:53,220 --> 01:36:55,600
living organism and and you have some no
we have I mean this is just terms and

3492
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:55,610
we have I mean this is just terms and
 

3493
01:36:55,610 --> 01:36:57,950
we have I mean this is just terms and
perhaps they don't mean much but we have

3494
01:36:57,950 --> 01:36:57,960
perhaps they don't mean much but we have
 

3495
01:36:57,960 --> 01:36:59,690
perhaps they don't mean much but we have
some kind of sense of what autonomous

3496
01:36:59,690 --> 01:36:59,700
some kind of sense of what autonomous
 

3497
01:36:59,700 --> 01:37:04,720
some kind of sense of what autonomous
means and that humans are autonomous

3498
01:37:04,720 --> 01:37:04,730

 

3499
01:37:04,730 --> 01:37:11,350

you've also done excellent work in the

3500
01:37:11,350 --> 01:37:11,360
you've also done excellent work in the
 

3501
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:14,500
you've also done excellent work in the
epidemiological modeling the simulation

3502
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:14,510
epidemiological modeling the simulation
 

3503
01:37:14,510 --> 01:37:16,240
epidemiological modeling the simulation
of these things so the zooming out

3504
01:37:16,240 --> 01:37:16,250
of these things so the zooming out
 

3505
01:37:16,250 --> 01:37:17,470
of these things so the zooming out
outside of the body

3506
01:37:17,470 --> 01:37:17,480
outside of the body
 

3507
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:19,960
outside of the body
during the aging based simulation so

3508
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:19,970
during the aging based simulation so
 

3509
01:37:19,970 --> 01:37:22,120
during the aging based simulation so
that's where you actually simulate

3510
01:37:22,120 --> 01:37:22,130
that's where you actually simulate
 

3511
01:37:22,130 --> 01:37:25,060
that's where you actually simulate
individual human beings and then the

3512
01:37:25,060 --> 01:37:25,070
individual human beings and then the
 

3513
01:37:25,070 --> 01:37:27,960
individual human beings and then the
spread of viruses from one to the other

3514
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:27,970
spread of viruses from one to the other
 

3515
01:37:27,970 --> 01:37:32,020
spread of viruses from one to the other
how does at a high level agent-based

3516
01:37:32,020 --> 01:37:32,030
how does at a high level agent-based
 

3517
01:37:32,030 --> 01:37:35,530
how does at a high level agent-based
simulation work all right so it's it's

3518
01:37:35,530 --> 01:37:35,540
simulation work all right so it's it's
 

3519
01:37:35,540 --> 01:37:40,600
simulation work all right so it's it's
also one of this I irony of timing

3520
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:40,610
also one of this I irony of timing
 

3521
01:37:40,610 --> 01:37:43,090
also one of this I irony of timing
because I mean way we we've worked on

3522
01:37:43,090 --> 01:37:43,100
because I mean way we we've worked on
 

3523
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:47,550
because I mean way we we've worked on
this project for the past five years and

3524
01:37:47,550 --> 01:37:47,560
this project for the past five years and
 

3525
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:51,520
this project for the past five years and
the New Year's Eve I got an email from

3526
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:51,530
the New Year's Eve I got an email from
 

3527
01:37:51,530 --> 01:37:54,880
the New Year's Eve I got an email from
my Fiji student that you know the last

3528
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:54,890
my Fiji student that you know the last
 

3529
01:37:54,890 --> 01:37:58,390
my Fiji student that you know the last
experiments were completed and you know

3530
01:37:58,390 --> 01:37:58,400
experiments were completed and you know
 

3531
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:01,090
experiments were completed and you know
the three weeks after that we get we get

3532
01:38:01,090 --> 01:38:01,100
the three weeks after that we get we get
 

3533
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:05,830
the three weeks after that we get we get
this diamond princess story and emailing

3534
01:38:05,830 --> 01:38:05,840
this diamond princess story and emailing
 

3535
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:07,480
this diamond princess story and emailing
each other with the same you know the

3536
01:38:07,480 --> 01:38:07,490
each other with the same you know the
 

3537
01:38:07,490 --> 01:38:11,170
each other with the same you know the
same news saying okay so the damn place

3538
01:38:11,170 --> 01:38:11,180
same news saying okay so the damn place
 

3539
01:38:11,180 --> 01:38:13,810
same news saying okay so the damn place
is a cruise ship yes and what was the

3540
01:38:13,810 --> 01:38:13,820
is a cruise ship yes and what was the
 

3541
01:38:13,820 --> 01:38:15,940
is a cruise ship yes and what was the
project that you working so I project I

3542
01:38:15,940 --> 01:38:15,950
project that you working so I project I
 

3543
01:38:15,950 --> 01:38:19,420
project that you working so I project I
mean it's you know the codename it

3544
01:38:19,420 --> 01:38:19,430
mean it's you know the codename it
 

3545
01:38:19,430 --> 01:38:22,320
mean it's you know the codename it
started with the bunch of undergrad use

3546
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:22,330
started with the bunch of undergrad use
 

3547
01:38:22,330 --> 01:38:25,630
started with the bunch of undergrad use
the code name was zombies on a cruise

3548
01:38:25,630 --> 01:38:25,640
the code name was zombies on a cruise
 

3549
01:38:25,640 --> 01:38:29,170
the code name was zombies on a cruise
ship so they they wanted to essentially

3550
01:38:29,170 --> 01:38:29,180
ship so they they wanted to essentially
 

3551
01:38:29,180 --> 01:38:32,040
ship so they they wanted to essentially
model the the you know zombie apocalypse

3552
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:32,050
model the the you know zombie apocalypse
 

3553
01:38:32,050 --> 01:38:36,790
model the the you know zombie apocalypse
apocalypses on a cruise ship and and you

3554
01:38:36,790 --> 01:38:36,800
apocalypses on a cruise ship and and you
 

3555
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:39,160
apocalypses on a cruise ship and and you
know after having you know some fun we

3556
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:39,170
know after having you know some fun we
 

3557
01:38:39,170 --> 01:38:42,040
know after having you know some fun we
then thought about the fact that you

3558
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:42,050
then thought about the fact that you
 

3559
01:38:42,050 --> 01:38:44,200
then thought about the fact that you
know if you look at the cruise ships I

3560
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:44,210
know if you look at the cruise ships I
 

3561
01:38:44,210 --> 01:38:47,520
know if you look at the cruise ships I
mean the infectious outbreak is has been

3562
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:47,530
mean the infectious outbreak is has been
 

3563
01:38:47,530 --> 01:38:50,920
mean the infectious outbreak is has been
one of the biggest threat you know

3564
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:50,930
one of the biggest threat you know
 

3565
01:38:50,930 --> 01:38:54,250
one of the biggest threat you know
threats to the cruise ship economy so

3566
01:38:54,250 --> 01:38:54,260
threats to the cruise ship economy so
 

3567
01:38:54,260 --> 01:38:58,120
threats to the cruise ship economy so
perhaps the most you know frequently

3568
01:38:58,120 --> 01:38:58,130
perhaps the most you know frequently
 

3569
01:38:58,130 --> 01:39:01,950
perhaps the most you know frequently
occurring via is the normal choirs and

3570
01:39:01,950 --> 01:39:01,960
occurring via is the normal choirs and
 

3571
01:39:01,960 --> 01:39:05,590
occurring via is the normal choirs and
this is essentially one of this stomach

3572
01:39:05,590 --> 01:39:05,600
this is essentially one of this stomach
 

3573
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:10,270
this is essentially one of this stomach
flus that you have and you know it it

3574
01:39:10,270 --> 01:39:10,280
flus that you have and you know it it
 

3575
01:39:10,280 --> 01:39:13,180
flus that you have and you know it it
can be quite devastating you know so

3576
01:39:13,180 --> 01:39:13,190
can be quite devastating you know so
 

3577
01:39:13,190 --> 01:39:16,660
can be quite devastating you know so
there are occasionally there are cruise

3578
01:39:16,660 --> 01:39:16,670
there are occasionally there are cruise
 

3579
01:39:16,670 --> 01:39:20,230
there are occasionally there are cruise
ships get you know they get canceled

3580
01:39:20,230 --> 01:39:20,240
ships get you know they get canceled
 

3581
01:39:20,240 --> 01:39:23,200
ships get you know they get canceled
they get returned to the back to the to

3582
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:23,210
they get returned to the back to the to
 

3583
01:39:23,210 --> 01:39:24,560
they get returned to the back to the to
the origin

3584
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:24,570
the origin
 

3585
01:39:24,570 --> 01:39:28,460
the origin
and so we wanted to study and this is

3586
01:39:28,460 --> 01:39:28,470
and so we wanted to study and this is
 

3587
01:39:28,470 --> 01:39:30,280
and so we wanted to study and this is
very different from the traditional

3588
01:39:30,280 --> 01:39:30,290
very different from the traditional
 

3589
01:39:30,290 --> 01:39:32,870
very different from the traditional
epidemiological studies where this scale

3590
01:39:32,870 --> 01:39:32,880
epidemiological studies where this scale
 

3591
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:35,510
epidemiological studies where this scale
is much larger so we wanted to study

3592
01:39:35,510 --> 01:39:35,520
is much larger so we wanted to study
 

3593
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:39,410
is much larger so we wanted to study
this in a confined environment which is

3594
01:39:39,410 --> 01:39:39,420
this in a confined environment which is
 

3595
01:39:39,420 --> 01:39:41,570
this in a confined environment which is
a cruise ship it could be a school it

3596
01:39:41,570 --> 01:39:41,580
a cruise ship it could be a school it
 

3597
01:39:41,580 --> 01:39:45,740
a cruise ship it could be a school it
could be other you know other places

3598
01:39:45,740 --> 01:39:45,750
could be other you know other places
 

3599
01:39:45,750 --> 01:39:48,910
could be other you know other places
such as you know these large large

3600
01:39:48,910 --> 01:39:48,920
such as you know these large large
 

3601
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:53,390
such as you know these large large
company where people are in interaction

3602
01:39:53,390 --> 01:39:53,400
company where people are in interaction
 

3603
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:58,760
company where people are in interaction
and the benefit of this model is we can

3604
01:39:58,760 --> 01:39:58,770
and the benefit of this model is we can
 

3605
01:39:58,770 --> 01:40:02,120
and the benefit of this model is we can
actually track that in the real time so

3606
01:40:02,120 --> 01:40:02,130
actually track that in the real time so
 

3607
01:40:02,130 --> 01:40:04,670
actually track that in the real time so
we can actually see the whole course of

3608
01:40:04,670 --> 01:40:04,680
we can actually see the whole course of
 

3609
01:40:04,680 --> 01:40:08,780
we can actually see the whole course of
the evolution or the whole course of the

3610
01:40:08,780 --> 01:40:08,790
the evolution or the whole course of the
 

3611
01:40:08,790 --> 01:40:14,230
the evolution or the whole course of the
interaction between the infected pass

3612
01:40:14,230 --> 01:40:14,240
interaction between the infected pass
 

3613
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:19,160
interaction between the infected pass
infected horse and you know the host and

3614
01:40:19,160 --> 01:40:19,170
infected horse and you know the host and
 

3615
01:40:19,170 --> 01:40:23,860
infected horse and you know the host and
the pathogen etcetera so so agent based

3616
01:40:23,860 --> 01:40:23,870
the pathogen etcetera so so agent based
 

3617
01:40:23,870 --> 01:40:27,880
the pathogen etcetera so so agent based
system multi-agent system to be

3618
01:40:27,880 --> 01:40:27,890
system multi-agent system to be
 

3619
01:40:27,890 --> 01:40:35,680
system multi-agent system to be
precisely is a good way to approach this

3620
01:40:35,680 --> 01:40:35,690
precisely is a good way to approach this
 

3621
01:40:35,690 --> 01:40:42,080
precisely is a good way to approach this
problem because we can introduce the

3622
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:42,090
problem because we can introduce the
 

3623
01:40:42,090 --> 01:40:46,550
problem because we can introduce the
behavior of the of the passengers of the

3624
01:40:46,550 --> 01:40:46,560
behavior of the of the passengers of the
 

3625
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:49,850
behavior of the of the passengers of the
cruise and what we did for the first

3626
01:40:49,850 --> 01:40:49,860
cruise and what we did for the first
 

3627
01:40:49,860 --> 01:40:53,060
cruise and what we did for the first
time that's where you know we introduced

3628
01:40:53,060 --> 01:40:53,070
time that's where you know we introduced
 

3629
01:40:53,070 --> 01:40:57,500
time that's where you know we introduced
um knology is we introduced a pathogen

3630
01:40:57,500 --> 01:40:57,510
um knology is we introduced a pathogen
 

3631
01:40:57,510 --> 01:41:02,980
um knology is we introduced a pathogen
agent explicitly so that allowed us to

3632
01:41:02,980 --> 01:41:02,990
agent explicitly so that allowed us to
 

3633
01:41:02,990 --> 01:41:06,850
agent explicitly so that allowed us to
essentially model the behavior on the

3634
01:41:06,850 --> 01:41:06,860
essentially model the behavior on the
 

3635
01:41:06,860 --> 01:41:10,760
essentially model the behavior on the
host site as well on the pathogen site

3636
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:10,770
host site as well on the pathogen site
 

3637
01:41:10,770 --> 01:41:15,290
host site as well on the pathogen site
and over sudden weekends we can have a

3638
01:41:15,290 --> 01:41:15,300
and over sudden weekends we can have a
 

3639
01:41:15,300 --> 01:41:19,490
and over sudden weekends we can have a
flexible model that allows us to

3640
01:41:19,490 --> 01:41:19,500
flexible model that allows us to
 

3641
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:22,340
flexible model that allows us to
integrate all the key parameters about

3642
01:41:22,340 --> 01:41:22,350
integrate all the key parameters about
 

3643
01:41:22,350 --> 01:41:28,700
integrate all the key parameters about
the infections so for example the virus

3644
01:41:28,700 --> 01:41:28,710
the infections so for example the virus
 

3645
01:41:28,710 --> 01:41:32,720
the infections so for example the virus
right so the ways of of transmitting the

3646
01:41:32,720 --> 01:41:32,730
right so the ways of of transmitting the
 

3647
01:41:32,730 --> 01:41:37,590
right so the ways of of transmitting the
virus between the the horse

3648
01:41:37,590 --> 01:41:37,600
virus between the the horse
 

3649
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:42,850
virus between the the horse
how long does virus survive on the

3650
01:41:42,850 --> 01:41:42,860
how long does virus survive on the
 

3651
01:41:42,860 --> 01:41:50,610
how long does virus survive on the
surface for might what is you know how

3652
01:41:50,610 --> 01:41:50,620
surface for might what is you know how
 

3653
01:41:50,620 --> 01:41:56,530
surface for might what is you know how
much of the viral particles does a host

3654
01:41:56,530 --> 01:41:56,540
much of the viral particles does a host
 

3655
01:41:56,540 --> 01:42:00,450
much of the viral particles does a host
shed when he or she is asymptomatic

3656
01:42:00,450 --> 01:42:00,460
shed when he or she is asymptomatic
 

3657
01:42:00,460 --> 01:42:03,940
shed when he or she is asymptomatic
versus symptomatic you can encode all of

3658
01:42:03,940 --> 01:42:03,950
versus symptomatic you can encode all of
 

3659
01:42:03,950 --> 01:42:06,130
versus symptomatic you can encode all of
that into this pattern just for people

3660
01:42:06,130 --> 01:42:06,140
that into this pattern just for people
 

3661
01:42:06,140 --> 01:42:07,690
that into this pattern just for people
who don't know so agent-based simulation

3662
01:42:07,690 --> 01:42:07,700
who don't know so agent-based simulation
 

3663
01:42:07,700 --> 01:42:10,060
who don't know so agent-based simulation
usually the agent represents a single

3664
01:42:10,060 --> 01:42:10,070
usually the agent represents a single
 

3665
01:42:10,070 --> 01:42:14,410
usually the agent represents a single
human being and then there's some graphs

3666
01:42:14,410 --> 01:42:14,420
human being and then there's some graphs
 

3667
01:42:14,420 --> 01:42:16,930
human being and then there's some graphs
like contact graphs that represent the

3668
01:42:16,930 --> 01:42:16,940
like contact graphs that represent the
 

3669
01:42:16,940 --> 01:42:18,970
like contact graphs that represent the
interaction between those human being so

3670
01:42:18,970 --> 01:42:18,980
interaction between those human being so
 

3671
01:42:18,980 --> 01:42:22,360
interaction between those human being so
yes so we so essentially is you know

3672
01:42:22,360 --> 01:42:22,370
yes so we so essentially is you know
 

3673
01:42:22,370 --> 01:42:25,810
yes so we so essentially is you know
social agents are you know individual

3674
01:42:25,810 --> 01:42:25,820
social agents are you know individual
 

3675
01:42:25,820 --> 01:42:30,690
social agents are you know individual
programs that are run in parallel and

3676
01:42:30,690 --> 01:42:30,700
programs that are run in parallel and
 

3677
01:42:30,700 --> 01:42:35,470
programs that are run in parallel and
we're saying we can provide instructions

3678
01:42:35,470 --> 01:42:35,480
we're saying we can provide instructions
 

3679
01:42:35,480 --> 01:42:39,220
we're saying we can provide instructions
for these agents how to interact with

3680
01:42:39,220 --> 01:42:39,230
for these agents how to interact with
 

3681
01:42:39,230 --> 01:42:41,500
for these agents how to interact with
each other how to exchange information

3682
01:42:41,500 --> 01:42:41,510
each other how to exchange information
 

3683
01:42:41,510 --> 01:42:45,670
each other how to exchange information
in this case exchange the infection but

3684
01:42:45,670 --> 01:42:45,680
in this case exchange the infection but
 

3685
01:42:45,680 --> 01:42:47,620
in this case exchange the infection but
in this case in your case you've added a

3686
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:47,630
in this case in your case you've added a
 

3687
01:42:47,630 --> 01:42:50,470
in this case in your case you've added a
pathogen as an Asian I mean that's kind

3688
01:42:50,470 --> 01:42:50,480
pathogen as an Asian I mean that's kind
 

3689
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:54,010
pathogen as an Asian I mean that's kind
of fascinating it's a it's kind of a

3690
01:42:54,010 --> 01:42:54,020
of fascinating it's a it's kind of a
 

3691
01:42:54,020 --> 01:42:56,530
of fascinating it's a it's kind of a
brilliant simple like a brilliant way to

3692
01:42:56,530 --> 01:42:56,540
brilliant simple like a brilliant way to
 

3693
01:42:56,540 --> 01:43:00,430
brilliant simple like a brilliant way to
condense the parameters to aggregate to

3694
01:43:00,430 --> 01:43:00,440
condense the parameters to aggregate to
 

3695
01:43:00,440 --> 01:43:02,050
condense the parameters to aggregate to
bring the parameters together that

3696
01:43:02,050 --> 01:43:02,060
bring the parameters together that
 

3697
01:43:02,060 --> 01:43:04,000
bring the parameters together that
represent them in the pathogen the virus

3698
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:04,010
represent them in the pathogen the virus
 

3699
01:43:04,010 --> 01:43:05,800
represent them in the pathogen the virus
yes that's fascinating

3700
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:05,810
yes that's fascinating
 

3701
01:43:05,810 --> 01:43:09,880
yes that's fascinating
actually so yeah it was a you know we

3702
01:43:09,880 --> 01:43:09,890
actually so yeah it was a you know we
 

3703
01:43:09,890 --> 01:43:11,770
actually so yeah it was a you know we
realized that you know by bringing in

3704
01:43:11,770 --> 01:43:11,780
realized that you know by bringing in
 

3705
01:43:11,780 --> 01:43:14,980
realized that you know by bringing in
the virus we can actually start modeling

3706
01:43:14,980 --> 01:43:14,990
the virus we can actually start modeling
 

3707
01:43:14,990 --> 01:43:18,610
the virus we can actually start modeling
I mean we were not no longer bounded by

3708
01:43:18,610 --> 01:43:18,620
I mean we were not no longer bounded by
 

3709
01:43:18,620 --> 01:43:22,870
I mean we were not no longer bounded by
very specific sort of aspects of the

3710
01:43:22,870 --> 01:43:22,880
very specific sort of aspects of the
 

3711
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:26,800
very specific sort of aspects of the
specific virus so we end up we started

3712
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:26,810
specific virus so we end up we started
 

3713
01:43:26,810 --> 01:43:29,830
specific virus so we end up we started
with you know Norwalk virus and of

3714
01:43:29,830 --> 01:43:29,840
with you know Norwalk virus and of
 

3715
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:33,570
with you know Norwalk virus and of
course zombies but we continued to

3716
01:43:33,570 --> 01:43:33,580
course zombies but we continued to
 

3717
01:43:33,580 --> 01:43:37,980
course zombies but we continued to
modeling Ebola virus outbreak flu SARS

3718
01:43:37,980 --> 01:43:37,990
modeling Ebola virus outbreak flu SARS
 

3719
01:43:37,990 --> 01:43:43,990
modeling Ebola virus outbreak flu SARS
and because I felt that we need to add a

3720
01:43:43,990 --> 01:43:44,000
and because I felt that we need to add a
 

3721
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,330
and because I felt that we need to add a
little bit more

3722
01:43:46,330 --> 01:43:46,340
little bit more
 

3723
01:43:46,340 --> 01:43:50,290
little bit more
of excitement for our undergraduate

3724
01:43:50,290 --> 01:43:50,300
of excitement for our undergraduate
 

3725
01:43:50,300 --> 01:43:54,070
of excitement for our undergraduate
students so we actually modeled the

3726
01:43:54,070 --> 01:43:54,080
students so we actually modeled the
 

3727
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:56,530
students so we actually modeled the
virus from the contagion movie yes

3728
01:43:56,530 --> 01:43:56,540
virus from the contagion movie yes
 

3729
01:43:56,540 --> 01:44:03,120
virus from the contagion movie yes
so MeV won and you know unfortunately

3730
01:44:03,120 --> 01:44:03,130
so MeV won and you know unfortunately
 

3731
01:44:03,130 --> 01:44:06,100
so MeV won and you know unfortunately
that virus and we we try to extract as

3732
01:44:06,100 --> 01:44:06,110
that virus and we we try to extract as
 

3733
01:44:06,110 --> 01:44:09,280
that virus and we we try to extract as
much information luckily the this movie

3734
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:09,290
much information luckily the this movie
 

3735
01:44:09,290 --> 01:44:13,450
much information luckily the this movie
was the scientific consultant was Ian

3736
01:44:13,450 --> 01:44:13,460
was the scientific consultant was Ian

01:44:19,959 --> 01:44:19,969
University who is actually who provided
 

3741
01:44:19,969 --> 01:44:24,550
University who is actually who provided
I think he designed this virus for this

3742
01:44:24,550 --> 01:44:24,560
I think he designed this virus for this
 

3743
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:27,160
I think he designed this virus for this
movie based on Nipah virus and I think

3744
01:44:27,160 --> 01:44:27,170
movie based on Nipah virus and I think
 

3745
01:44:27,170 --> 01:44:31,540
movie based on Nipah virus and I think
with some ideas behind source of flu

3746
01:44:31,540 --> 01:44:31,550
with some ideas behind source of flu
 

3747
01:44:31,550 --> 01:44:36,160
with some ideas behind source of flu
like airborne viruses and you know the

3748
01:44:36,160 --> 01:44:36,170
like airborne viruses and you know the
 

3749
01:44:36,170 --> 01:44:39,240
like airborne viruses and you know the
it the movie surprisingly contained

3750
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:39,250
it the movie surprisingly contained
 

3751
01:44:39,250 --> 01:44:42,550
it the movie surprisingly contained
enough details for us to extract and to

3752
01:44:42,550 --> 01:44:42,560
enough details for us to extract and to
 

3753
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:45,129
enough details for us to extract and to
model it I was hoping you'd like publish

3754
01:44:45,129 --> 01:44:45,139
model it I was hoping you'd like publish
 

3755
01:44:45,139 --> 01:44:47,050
model it I was hoping you'd like publish
a paper of how this virus works

3756
01:44:47,050 --> 01:44:47,060
a paper of how this virus works
 

3757
01:44:47,060 --> 01:44:49,570
a paper of how this virus works
yeah we're planning to publish I would

3758
01:44:49,570 --> 01:44:49,580
yeah we're planning to publish I would
 

3759
01:44:49,580 --> 01:44:51,669
yeah we're planning to publish I would
love it if you guys will be nice if the

3760
01:44:51,669 --> 01:44:51,679
love it if you guys will be nice if the
 

3761
01:44:51,679 --> 01:44:57,430
love it if you guys will be nice if the
you know of the origin of the virus but

3762
01:44:57,430 --> 01:44:57,440
you know of the origin of the virus but
 

3763
01:44:57,440 --> 01:44:59,109
you know of the origin of the virus but
you're now actually being a scientist

3764
01:44:59,109 --> 01:44:59,119
you're now actually being a scientist
 

3765
01:44:59,119 --> 01:45:00,820
you're now actually being a scientist
and studying the virus from that

3766
01:45:00,820 --> 01:45:00,830
and studying the virus from that
 

3767
01:45:00,830 --> 01:45:02,740
and studying the virus from that
perspective but the origin of the virus

3768
01:45:02,740 --> 01:45:02,750
perspective but the origin of the virus
 

3769
01:45:02,750 --> 01:45:05,350
perspective but the origin of the virus
you do you know you know the first time

3770
01:45:05,350 --> 01:45:05,360
you do you know you know the first time
 

3771
01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:08,740
you do you know you know the first time
actually so this movie is assignment

3772
01:45:08,740 --> 01:45:08,750
actually so this movie is assignment
 

3773
01:45:08,750 --> 01:45:11,169
actually so this movie is assignment
number one in my band families class

3774
01:45:11,169 --> 01:45:11,179
number one in my band families class
 

3775
01:45:11,179 --> 01:45:15,550
number one in my band families class
that they give because it it also tell

3776
01:45:15,550 --> 01:45:15,560

I don't know you watch the have you
 

3783
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:25,750
I don't know you watch the have you
watched it a long time so so there is

3784
01:45:25,750 --> 01:45:25,760
watched it a long time so so there is
 

3785
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:29,500
watched it a long time so so there is
you know approximately a week from the

this is where I tell my students that

3794
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:41,210
this is where I tell my students that
 

3795
01:45:41,210 --> 01:45:43,479
this is where I tell my students that
you know if you ask experimental

3796
01:45:43,479 --> 01:45:43,489
you know if you ask experimental
 

3797
01:45:43,489 --> 01:45:46,540
you know if you ask experimental
biologists they will tell you that it's

01:45:46,540 --> 01:45:46,550
biologists they will tell you that it's
 

3799
01:45:46,550 --> 01:45:50,050
biologists they will tell you that it's
impossible because it takes months maybe

3800
01:45:50,050 --> 01:45:50,060
impossible because it takes months maybe
 

3801

3803
01:45:53,090 --> 01:45:55,510
years to get the crystal structure of
this you know the structure that is

01:45:55,510 --> 01:45:55,520
this you know the structure that is
 

3805
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:57,490
this you know the structure that is

Titian they tell you

3808
01:46:00,190 --> 01:46:00,200
Titian they tell you
 

3809
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:06,750
Titian they tell you
why not just get it modeled and and yes

3810
01:46:06,750 --> 01:46:06,760
why not just get it modeled and and yes
 

3811
01:46:06,760 --> 01:46:10,210
why not just get it modeled and and yes
but it was very interesting to to see

3812
01:46:10,210 --> 01:46:10,220
but it was very interesting to to see
 

3813
01:46:10,220 --> 01:46:13,990
but it was very interesting to to see
that there is actually you know and if

3814
01:46:13,990 --> 01:46:14,000
that there is actually you know and if
 

3815
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:17,950
that there is actually you know and if
you do it do screenshots you actually

3816
01:46:17,950 --> 01:46:17,960
you do it do screenshots you actually
 

3817
01:46:17,960 --> 01:46:19,540
you do it do screenshots you actually
see they feel a genetic tree is the

3818
01:46:19,540 --> 01:46:19,550
see they feel a genetic tree is the
 

3819
01:46:19,550 --> 01:46:21,550
see they feel a genetic tree is the
evolutionary tree that relate this virus

3820
01:46:21,550 --> 01:46:21,560
evolutionary tree that relate this virus
 

3821
01:46:21,560 --> 01:46:24,850
evolutionary tree that relate this virus
with other viruses so it was a lot of

3822
01:46:24,850 --> 01:46:24,860
with other viruses so it was a lot of
 

3823
01:46:24,860 --> 01:46:27,250
with other viruses so it was a lot of
scientific thought put into the movie

3824

and one thing that I was actually you

3826
01:46:30,940 --> 01:46:30,950
and one thing that I was actually you
 

3827
01:46:30,950 --> 01:46:33,070
and one thing that I was actually you
know it was interesting to to learn is

3828
01:46:33,070 --> 01:46:33,080
know it was interesting to to learn is
 

3829
01:46:33,080 --> 01:46:35,860
know it was interesting to to learn is
that the origin of this virus was a

3830

that the origin of this virus was a
 

3831
01:46:35,870 --> 01:46:41,590
that the origin of this virus was a

the dynamics of the infection exactly I
 

3897
01:48:38,349 --> 01:48:41,830
the dynamics of the infection exactly I
do also I don't know how close you're

3898
01:48:41,830 --> 01:48:41,840
do also I don't know how close you're
 

3899
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:45,399
do also I don't know how close you're
tracking this but do you also think that

3900
01:48:45,399 --> 01:48:45,409
tracking this but do you also think that
 

3901
01:48:45,409 --> 01:48:48,700
tracking this but do you also think that
there's a different like rate of

01:49:03,769 --> 01:49:08,649
so one important parameter that tells us
how contagious the the person with a

01:49:14,080 --> 01:49:14,090
symptomatic is looking at the number of
 

3917
01:49:14,090 --> 01:49:19,149
symptomatic is looking at the number of
viral particles this person sheds you

viral particles this person sheds you
 

3919
01:49:19,159 --> 01:49:23,469
viral particles this person sheds you
know as a function of time so so far

3920
01:49:23,469 --> 01:49:23,479
know as a function of time so so far
 

3921
01:49:23,479 --> 01:49:31,540
know as a function of time so so far
what I saw is the study that tells us

3922
01:49:31,540 --> 01:49:31,550
what I saw is the study that tells us
 

3923
01:49:31,550 --> 01:49:35,649
what I saw is the study that tells us
that the you know the person during the

3924
01:49:35,649 --> 01:49:35,659
that the you know the person during the
 

3925
01:49:35,659 --> 01:49:37,989
that the you know the person during the
asymptomatic period is already

3926

asymptomatic period is already
 

3927
01:49:37,999 --> 01:49:41,739
asymptomatic period is already
contagious and it said the person says

3928
01:49:41,739 --> 01:49:41,749
contagious and it said the person says
 

3929
01:49:41,749 --> 01:49:47,229
contagious and it said the person says
enough viruses to infect yeah and

3930

another horse and I think there's too
 

3933
01:49:48,739 --> 01:49:51,100
another horse and I think there's too
many excellent papers coming up but I

3934
01:49:51,100 --> 01:49:51,110
many excellent papers coming up but I
 

3935
01:49:51,110 --> 01:49:53,319
many excellent papers coming up but I
think I just saw so maybe a nature paper

3936
01:49:53,319 --> 01:49:53,329
think I just saw so maybe a nature paper
 

3937
01:49:53,329 --> 01:49:57,870
think I just saw so maybe a nature paper
that said the first week is when you're

3938
01:49:57,870 --> 01:49:57,880
that said the first week is when you're
 

3939
01:49:57,880 --> 01:50:00,250
that said the first week is when you're
symptomatic or asymptomatic you're the

3940
01:50:00,250 --> 01:50:00,260
symptomatic or asymptomatic you're the
 

3941
01:50:00,260 --> 01:50:02,339
symptomatic or asymptomatic you're the
most contagious so the highest level of

3942
01:50:02,339 --> 01:50:02,349
most contagious so the highest level of
 

3943
01:50:02,349 --> 01:50:05,469
most contagious so the highest level of
the like there's a plot sort of in the

3944
01:50:05,469 --> 01:50:05,479
the like there's a plot sort of in the
 

3945
01:50:05,479 --> 01:50:08,529
the like there's a plot sort of in the
14-day period they collected a bunch of

3946
01:50:08,529 --> 01:50:08,539
14-day period they collected a bunch of
 

3947
01:50:08,539 --> 01:50:10,779
14-day period they collected a bunch of
subjects and I think the first week is

3948
01:50:10,779 --> 01:50:10,789
subjects and I think the first week is
 

3949
01:50:10,789 --> 01:50:12,879
subjects and I think the first week is
one is the most yeah I I think I mean

3950
01:50:12,879 --> 01:50:12,889
one is the most yeah I I think I mean
 

3951
01:50:12,889 --> 01:50:17,290
one is the most yeah I I think I mean
I'm waiting I'm waiting to see sort of

3952
01:50:17,290 --> 01:50:17,300
I'm waiting I'm waiting to see sort of
 

3953
01:50:17,300 --> 01:50:21,939
I'm waiting I'm waiting to see sort of
more more populated studies where I just

3954
01:50:21,939 --> 01:50:21,949
more more populated studies where I just
 

3955
01:50:21,949 --> 01:50:23,850
more more populated studies where I just
it was kinda

3956
01:50:23,850 --> 01:50:23,860
it was kinda
 

3957
01:50:23,860 --> 01:50:29,319
it was kinda
my one of my favorite styles was again

3958
01:50:29,319 --> 01:50:29,329
my one of my favorite styles was again
 

3959
01:50:29,329 --> 01:50:31,899
my one of my favorite styles was again
very recent one where scientists

3960
01:50:31,899 --> 01:50:31,909
very recent one where scientists
 

3961
01:50:31,909 --> 01:50:39,870
very recent one where scientists
determined that tears are not contagious

3962
01:50:39,870 --> 01:50:39,880

 

3963
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:42,939

so so there is you know so there is no

3964
01:50:42,939 --> 01:50:42,949
so so there is you know so there is no
 

3965
01:50:42,949 --> 01:50:45,720
so so there is you know so there is no
viral shedding down through three tears

3966
01:50:45,720 --> 01:50:45,730
viral shedding down through three tears
 

3967
01:50:45,730 --> 01:50:49,689
viral shedding down through three tears
so they found one wick moist thing

3968
01:50:49,689 --> 01:50:49,699
so they found one wick moist thing
 

3969
01:50:49,699 --> 01:50:51,729
so they found one wick moist thing
that's not contagious and I mean there's

3970
01:50:51,729 --> 01:50:51,739
that's not contagious and I mean there's
 

3971
01:50:51,739 --> 01:50:56,260
that's not contagious and I mean there's
a lot of I'm personally been I'm gonna

3972
01:50:56,260 --> 01:50:56,270
a lot of I'm personally been I'm gonna
 

3973
01:50:56,270 --> 01:50:59,830
a lot of I'm personally been I'm gonna
serve a paper somehow that's looking at

3974
01:50:59,830 --> 01:50:59,840
serve a paper somehow that's looking at
 

3975
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:02,890
serve a paper somehow that's looking at
masks and there's been so much

3976
01:51:02,890 --> 01:51:02,900
masks and there's been so much
 

3977
01:51:02,900 --> 01:51:04,810
masks and there's been so much
interesting debate on the efficacy of

3978
01:51:04,810 --> 01:51:04,820
interesting debate on the efficacy of
 

3979
01:51:04,820 --> 01:51:06,939
interesting debate on the efficacy of
masks and there's a lot of work and

3980
01:51:06,939 --> 01:51:06,949
masks and there's a lot of work and
 

3981
01:51:06,949 --> 01:51:10,709
masks and there's a lot of work and
there's a lot of interesting work on

3982
01:51:10,709 --> 01:51:10,719
there's a lot of interesting work on
 

3983
01:51:10,719 --> 01:51:13,600
there's a lot of interesting work on
whether this virus is airborne and it's

3984
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:13,610
whether this virus is airborne and it's
 

3985
01:51:13,610 --> 01:51:15,850
whether this virus is airborne and it's
a totally open question is it's leaning

3986
01:51:15,850 --> 01:51:15,860
a totally open question is it's leaning
 

3987
01:51:15,860 --> 01:51:18,310
a totally open question is it's leaning
one way right now but it's a totally

3988
01:51:18,310 --> 01:51:18,320
one way right now but it's a totally
 

3989
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:20,560
one way right now but it's a totally
open question whether it can travel and

3990
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:20,570
open question whether it can travel and
 

3991
01:51:20,570 --> 01:51:23,200
open question whether it can travel and
aerosols long distances I mean do you

3992
01:51:23,200 --> 01:51:23,210
aerosols long distances I mean do you
 

3993
01:51:23,210 --> 01:51:25,120
aerosols long distances I mean do you
have us do you think about the stuff do

3994
01:51:25,120 --> 01:51:25,130
have us do you think about the stuff do
 

3995
01:51:25,130 --> 01:51:26,890
have us do you think about the stuff do
you track this stuff are you focused on

3996
01:51:26,890 --> 01:51:26,900
you track this stuff are you focused on
 

3997
01:51:26,900 --> 01:51:29,439
you track this stuff are you focused on
them yeah I mean I'm at it I mean did

3998
01:51:29,439 --> 01:51:29,449
them yeah I mean I'm at it I mean did
 

3999
01:51:29,449 --> 01:51:33,160
them yeah I mean I'm at it I mean did
this is this is a very important aspect

4000
01:51:33,160 --> 01:51:33,170
this is this is a very important aspect
 

4001
01:51:33,170 --> 01:51:38,350
this is this is a very important aspect
for our epidemiology study I think the I

4002
01:51:38,350 --> 01:51:38,360
for our epidemiology study I think the I
 

4003
01:51:38,360 --> 01:51:44,049
for our epidemiology study I think the I
mean and it's sort of a very simple sort

4004
01:51:44,049 --> 01:51:44,059
mean and it's sort of a very simple sort
 

4005
01:51:44,059 --> 01:51:48,069
mean and it's sort of a very simple sort
of idea but I agree with people who say

4006
01:51:48,069 --> 01:51:48,079
of idea but I agree with people who say
 

4007
01:51:48,079 --> 01:51:53,979
of idea but I agree with people who say
that they mask the masks work in both

4008
01:51:53,979 --> 01:51:53,989
that they mask the masks work in both
 

4009
01:51:53,989 --> 01:51:58,000
that they mask the masks work in both
stay in both ways so it not only it

4010
01:51:58,000 --> 01:51:58,010
stay in both ways so it not only it
 

4011
01:51:58,010 --> 01:52:00,609
stay in both ways so it not only it
protects you from the you know incoming

4012
01:52:00,609 --> 01:52:00,619
protects you from the you know incoming
 

4013
01:52:00,619 --> 01:52:03,700
protects you from the you know incoming
viral particles it also protect you know

4014
01:52:03,700 --> 01:52:03,710
viral particles it also protect you know
 

4015
01:52:03,710 --> 01:52:07,140
viral particles it also protect you know
it it you know makes the potentially

4016
01:52:07,140 --> 01:52:07,150
it it you know makes the potentially
 

4017
01:52:07,150 --> 01:52:10,870
it it you know makes the potentially
contagious person not to spread the

4018
01:52:10,870 --> 01:52:10,880
contagious person not to spread the
 

4019
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:12,339
contagious person not to spread the
right of party noise when they're

4020
01:52:12,339 --> 01:52:12,349
right of party noise when they're
 

4021
01:52:12,349 --> 01:52:14,200
right of party noise when they're
asymptomatic may not even know that

4022
01:52:14,200 --> 01:52:14,210
asymptomatic may not even know that
 

4023
01:52:14,210 --> 01:52:16,930
asymptomatic may not even know that
they're in fact it seems to be there's

4024
01:52:16,930 --> 01:52:16,940
they're in fact it seems to be there's
 

4025
01:52:16,940 --> 01:52:20,319
they're in fact it seems to be there's
evidence that they don't surgical and

4026
01:52:20,319 --> 01:52:20,329
evidence that they don't surgical and
 

4027
01:52:20,329 --> 01:52:22,089
evidence that they don't surgical and
certainly homemade masks which is what's

4028
01:52:22,089 --> 01:52:22,099
certainly homemade masks which is what's
 

4029
01:52:22,099 --> 01:52:23,950
certainly homemade masks which is what's
needed now actually because there's a

4030
01:52:23,950 --> 01:52:23,960
needed now actually because there's a
 

4031
01:52:23,960 --> 01:52:27,430
needed now actually because there's a
huge shortage of they don't work as to

4032
01:52:27,430 --> 01:52:27,440
huge shortage of they don't work as to
 

4033
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:30,310
huge shortage of they don't work as to
protect you that while they work much

4034
01:52:30,310 --> 01:52:30,320
protect you that while they work much
 

4035
01:52:30,320 --> 01:52:33,580
protect you that while they work much
better to protect others it's it's a

4036
01:52:33,580 --> 01:52:33,590
better to protect others it's it's a
 

4037
01:52:33,590 --> 01:52:36,820
better to protect others it's it's a
motivation for us to all wear one

4038
01:52:36,820 --> 01:52:36,830
motivation for us to all wear one
 

4039
01:52:36,830 --> 01:52:38,860
motivation for us to all wear one
exactly because I mean you know very you

4040
01:52:38,860 --> 01:52:38,870
exactly because I mean you know very you
 

4041
01:52:38,870 --> 01:52:40,810
exactly because I mean you know very you
don't know where you know inside you

4042
01:52:40,810 --> 01:52:40,820
don't know where you know inside you
 

4043
01:52:40,820 --> 01:52:44,650
don't know where you know inside you
know about 30% as far as I remember at

4044
01:52:44,650 --> 01:52:44,660
know about 30% as far as I remember at
 

4045
01:52:44,660 --> 01:52:48,150
know about 30% as far as I remember at
least 30% of the asymptomatic cases are

4046
01:52:48,150 --> 01:52:48,160
least 30% of the asymptomatic cases are
 

4047
01:52:48,160 --> 01:52:50,950
least 30% of the asymptomatic cases are
completely asymptomatic here right so

4048
01:52:50,950 --> 01:52:50,960
completely asymptomatic here right so
 

4049
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:54,790
completely asymptomatic here right so
you don't really care you don't I mean

4050
01:52:54,790 --> 01:52:54,800
you don't really care you don't I mean
 

4051
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:57,730
you don't really care you don't I mean
you don't have any symptoms yet you shed

4052
01:52:57,730 --> 01:52:57,740
you don't have any symptoms yet you shed
 

4053
01:52:57,740 --> 01:53:00,010
you don't have any symptoms yet you shed
viruses do you think it's possible that

4054
01:53:00,010 --> 01:53:00,020
viruses do you think it's possible that
 

4055
01:53:00,020 --> 01:53:02,860
viruses do you think it's possible that
we'll all wear masks so I wore masks at

4056
01:53:02,860 --> 01:53:02,870
we'll all wear masks so I wore masks at
 

4057
01:53:02,870 --> 01:53:05,080
we'll all wear masks so I wore masks at
a grocery store and you just you get

4058
01:53:05,080 --> 01:53:05,090
a grocery store and you just you get
 

4059
01:53:05,090 --> 01:53:07,770
a grocery store and you just you get
looks I mean it was like we could go

4060
01:53:07,770 --> 01:53:07,780
looks I mean it was like we could go
 

4061
01:53:07,780 --> 01:53:10,360
looks I mean it was like we could go
maybe it's already changed because I

4062
01:53:10,360 --> 01:53:10,370
maybe it's already changed because I
 

4063
01:53:10,370 --> 01:53:13,570
maybe it's already changed because I
think CDC or somebody's I think the CDC

4064
01:53:13,570 --> 01:53:13,580
think CDC or somebody's I think the CDC
 

4065
01:53:13,580 --> 01:53:15,220
think CDC or somebody's I think the CDC
has said that we should be wearing masks

4066
01:53:15,220 --> 01:53:15,230
has said that we should be wearing masks
 

4067
01:53:15,230 --> 01:53:18,310
has said that we should be wearing masks
like la they starting to happen but you

4068
01:53:18,310 --> 01:53:18,320
like la they starting to happen but you
 

4069
01:53:18,320 --> 01:53:20,530
like la they starting to happen but you
it just seems like something that this

4070
01:53:20,530 --> 01:53:20,540
it just seems like something that this
 

4071
01:53:20,540 --> 01:53:23,800
it just seems like something that this
country will really struggle doing or no

4072
01:53:23,800 --> 01:53:23,810
country will really struggle doing or no
 

4073
01:53:23,810 --> 01:53:27,850
country will really struggle doing or no
I hope not I mean you know it it was

4074
01:53:27,850 --> 01:53:27,860
I hope not I mean you know it it was
 

4075
01:53:27,860 --> 01:53:30,450
I hope not I mean you know it it was
interesting I was looking through the

4076
01:53:30,450 --> 01:53:30,460
interesting I was looking through the
 

4077
01:53:30,460 --> 01:53:33,850
interesting I was looking through the
through the old pictures during the

4078
01:53:33,850 --> 01:53:33,860
through the old pictures during the
 

4079
01:53:33,860 --> 01:53:38,410
through the old pictures during the
Spanish flu and you could see that the

4080
01:53:38,410 --> 01:53:38,420
Spanish flu and you could see that the
 

4081
01:53:38,420 --> 01:53:43,030
Spanish flu and you could see that the
you know pretty much everyone was

4082
01:53:43,030 --> 01:53:43,040
you know pretty much everyone was
 

4083
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:44,950
you know pretty much everyone was
wearing masks with some exceptions and

4084
01:53:44,950 --> 01:53:44,960
wearing masks with some exceptions and
 

4085
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:47,140
wearing masks with some exceptions and
they were like you know sort of iconic

4086
01:53:47,140 --> 01:53:47,150
they were like you know sort of iconic
 

4087
01:53:47,150 --> 01:53:50,500
they were like you know sort of iconic
photograph of the thing it was San

4088
01:53:50,500 --> 01:53:50,510
photograph of the thing it was San
 

4089
01:53:50,510 --> 01:53:54,460

Francisco this tram who was refusing to

4090
01:53:54,460 --> 01:53:54,470
Francisco this tram who was refusing to
 

4091
01:53:54,470 --> 01:53:57,940
Francisco this tram who was refusing to
let in a you know someone without the

4092
01:53:57,940 --> 01:53:57,950
let in a you know someone without the
 

4093
01:53:57,950 --> 01:54:02,850
let in a you know someone without the
mask so I think well you know it's also

4094
01:54:02,850 --> 01:54:02,860
mask so I think well you know it's also
 

4095
01:54:02,860 --> 01:54:06,430
mask so I think well you know it's also
you know it's related to the fact you

4096
01:54:06,430 --> 01:54:06,440
you know it's related to the fact you
 

4097
01:54:06,440 --> 01:54:11,200
you know it's related to the fact you
know how much we are scared right so how

4098
01:54:11,200 --> 01:54:11,210
know how much we are scared right so how
 

4099
01:54:11,210 --> 01:54:16,380
know how much we are scared right so how
much do we treat this problem seriously

4100
01:54:16,380 --> 01:54:16,390
much do we treat this problem seriously
 

4101
01:54:16,390 --> 01:54:24,720
much do we treat this problem seriously
and you know my take on it is we should

4102
01:54:24,720 --> 01:54:24,730
and you know my take on it is we should
 

4103
01:54:24,730 --> 01:54:28,230
and you know my take on it is we should
because it is very serious

4104
01:54:28,230 --> 01:54:28,240
because it is very serious
 

4105
01:54:28,240 --> 01:54:31,450
because it is very serious
yeah I i from a psychology perspective

4106
01:54:31,450 --> 01:54:31,460
yeah I i from a psychology perspective
 

4107
01:54:31,460 --> 01:54:34,570
yeah I i from a psychology perspective
just worried about the entirely the

4108
01:54:34,570 --> 01:54:34,580
just worried about the entirely the
 

4109
01:54:34,580 --> 01:54:37,120
just worried about the entirely the
entire big mess the of a psychology

4110
01:54:37,120 --> 01:54:37,130
entire big mess the of a psychology
 

4111
01:54:37,130 --> 01:54:39,160
entire big mess the of a psychology
experiment that this is whether masks

4112
01:54:39,160 --> 01:54:39,170
experiment that this is whether masks
 

4113
01:54:39,170 --> 01:54:43,300
experiment that this is whether masks
will help it or heard it you know the

4114
01:54:43,300 --> 01:54:43,310
will help it or heard it you know the
 

4115
01:54:43,310 --> 01:54:46,000
will help it or heard it you know the
masks have a way of distancing us from

4116
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:46,010
masks have a way of distancing us from
 

4117
01:54:46,010 --> 01:54:49,810
masks have a way of distancing us from
others by removing the emotional

4118
01:54:49,810 --> 01:54:49,820
others by removing the emotional
 

4119
01:54:49,820 --> 01:54:51,850
others by removing the emotional
and all that kind of stuff but at the

4120
01:54:51,850 --> 01:54:51,860
and all that kind of stuff but at the
 

4121
01:54:51,860 --> 01:54:56,260
and all that kind of stuff but at the
same time masks also signal that I care

4122
01:54:56,260 --> 01:54:56,270
same time masks also signal that I care
 

4123
01:54:56,270 --> 01:54:58,930
same time masks also signal that I care
about your well-being exactly so it's a

4124
01:54:58,930 --> 01:54:58,940
about your well-being exactly so it's a
 

4125
01:54:58,940 --> 01:55:01,090
about your well-being exactly so it's a
really interesting trade-off that's just

4126
01:55:01,090 --> 01:55:01,100
really interesting trade-off that's just
 

4127
01:55:01,100 --> 01:55:03,790
really interesting trade-off that's just
uh yeah it's it's interesting right

4128
01:55:03,790 --> 01:55:03,800
uh yeah it's it's interesting right
 

4129
01:55:03,800 --> 01:55:06,220
uh yeah it's it's interesting right
about distancing uh aren't we distance

4130
01:55:06,220 --> 01:55:06,230
about distancing uh aren't we distance
 

4131
01:55:06,230 --> 01:55:08,680
about distancing uh aren't we distance
enough right exactly

4132
01:55:08,680 --> 01:55:08,690
enough right exactly
 

4133
01:55:08,690 --> 01:55:13,000
enough right exactly
Hey and when we tried to come closer

4134
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:13,010
Hey and when we tried to come closer
 

4135
01:55:13,010 --> 01:55:15,630
Hey and when we tried to come closer
together when they do reopen the economy

4136
01:55:15,630 --> 01:55:15,640
together when they do reopen the economy
 

4137
01:55:15,640 --> 01:55:19,170
together when they do reopen the economy
that's going to be a long road of

4138
01:55:19,170 --> 01:55:19,180
that's going to be a long road of
 

4139
01:55:19,180 --> 01:55:21,850
that's going to be a long road of
rebuilding trust and not not all being

4140
01:55:21,850 --> 01:55:21,860
rebuilding trust and not not all being
 

4141
01:55:21,860 --> 01:55:28,300
rebuilding trust and not not all being
huge germophobes let me ask sort of you

4142
01:55:28,300 --> 01:55:28,310
huge germophobes let me ask sort of you
 

4143

I have a pre thick Russian accent what
are your favorite memories of Russia so

4154
01:55:45,310 --> 01:55:45,320
are your favorite memories of Russia so
 

4155
01:55:45,320 --> 01:55:51,250

I so I moved first to Canada and then to

4156
01:55:51,250 --> 01:55:51,260
I so I moved first to Canada and then to
 

4157
01:55:51,260 --> 01:55:55,300
I so I moved first to Canada and then to
the United States back in 99 so by that

4158
01:55:55,300 --> 01:55:55,310
the United States back in 99 so by that
 

4159
01:55:55,310 --> 01:55:59,980
the United States back in 99 so by that
time I was 22 so you know whatever

4160
01:55:59,980 --> 01:55:59,990
time I was 22 so you know whatever
 

4161
01:55:59,990 --> 01:56:03,670
time I was 22 so you know whatever
Russian accent III got back then you

4162
01:56:03,670 --> 01:56:03,680
Russian accent III got back then you
 

4163
01:56:03,680 --> 01:56:06,250
Russian accent III got back then you
know it's that use me for the rest of my

4164
01:56:06,250 --> 01:56:06,260
know it's that use me for the rest of my
 

4165
01:56:06,260 --> 01:56:08,130
know it's that use me for the rest of my
life

4166
01:56:08,130 --> 01:56:08,140
life
 

4167
01:56:08,140 --> 01:56:12,850
life
you know it's yeah so I you know by the

4168
01:56:12,850 --> 01:56:12,860
you know it's yeah so I you know by the
 

4169
01:56:12,860 --> 01:56:16,870
you know it's yeah so I you know by the
time the Soviet Union collapsed I was

4170
01:56:16,870 --> 01:56:16,880
time the Soviet Union collapsed I was
 

4171
01:56:16,880 --> 01:56:22,300
time the Soviet Union collapsed I was
you know I was a kid but through you

4172
01:56:22,300 --> 01:56:22,310
you know I was a kid but through you
 

4173
01:56:22,310 --> 01:56:25,270
you know I was a kid but through you
know old enough to to realize that there

4174
01:56:25,270 --> 01:56:25,280
know old enough to to realize that there
 

4175
01:56:25,280 --> 01:56:29,530
know old enough to to realize that there
are changes and did you want to be a

4176
01:56:29,530 --> 01:56:29,540
are changes and did you want to be a
 

4177
01:56:29,540 --> 01:56:31,720
are changes and did you want to be a
scientist back then oh yes oh yeah I

4178
01:56:31,720 --> 01:56:31,730
scientist back then oh yes oh yeah I
 

4179
01:56:31,730 --> 01:56:37,810
scientist back then oh yes oh yeah I
mean my first the first sort of ten

4180
01:56:37,810 --> 01:56:37,820
mean my first the first sort of ten
 

4181
01:56:37,820 --> 01:56:43,120
mean my first the first sort of ten
years of my sort of you know a juvenile

4182
01:56:43,120 --> 01:56:43,130
years of my sort of you know a juvenile
 

4183
01:56:43,130 --> 01:56:48,850
years of my sort of you know a juvenile
life I wanted to be a pilot of a

4184
01:56:48,850 --> 01:56:48,860
life I wanted to be a pilot of a
 

4185
01:56:48,860 --> 01:56:51,310
life I wanted to be a pilot of a
passenger jet plane Wow

4186
01:56:51,310 --> 01:56:51,320
passenger jet plane Wow
 

4187
01:56:51,320 --> 01:56:54,490
passenger jet plane Wow
so yes it was like you know I was

4188
01:56:54,490 --> 01:56:54,500
so yes it was like you know I was
 

4189
01:56:54,500 --> 01:56:58,810
so yes it was like you know I was
getting ready you know to go to a

4190
01:56:58,810 --> 01:56:58,820
getting ready you know to go to a
 

4191
01:56:58,820 --> 01:57:02,570
getting ready you know to go to a
college to get the degree but

4192
01:57:02,570 --> 01:57:02,580
college to get the degree but
 

4193
01:57:02,580 --> 01:57:06,530
college to get the degree but
I've been always fascinated by science

4194
01:57:06,530 --> 01:57:06,540
I've been always fascinated by science
 

4195
01:57:06,540 --> 01:57:10,610
I've been always fascinated by science
and you know so not just by mass of

4196
01:57:10,610 --> 01:57:10,620
and you know so not just by mass of
 

4197
01:57:10,620 --> 01:57:12,620
and you know so not just by mass of
course math was one of my favorite

4198
01:57:12,620 --> 01:57:12,630
course math was one of my favorite
 

4199
01:57:12,630 --> 01:57:15,110
course math was one of my favorite
subjects but you know biology chemistry

4200
01:57:15,110 --> 01:57:15,120
subjects but you know biology chemistry
 

4201
01:57:15,120 --> 01:57:20,150
subjects but you know biology chemistry
physics somehow I you know I liked those

4202
01:57:20,150 --> 01:57:20,160
physics somehow I you know I liked those
 

4203
01:57:20,160 --> 01:57:26,330
physics somehow I you know I liked those
four subjects together and guess so so

4204
01:57:26,330 --> 01:57:26,340
four subjects together and guess so so
 

4205
01:57:26,340 --> 01:57:30,890
four subjects together and guess so so
so essentially after a certain period of

4206
01:57:30,890 --> 01:57:30,900
so essentially after a certain period of
 

4207
01:57:30,900 --> 01:57:36,500
so essentially after a certain period of
time I wanted to actually back then it

4208
01:57:36,500 --> 01:57:36,510
time I wanted to actually back then it
 

4209
01:57:36,510 --> 01:57:40,940
time I wanted to actually back then it
was a very popular sort of area of

4210
01:57:40,940 --> 01:57:40,950
was a very popular sort of area of
 

4211
01:57:40,950 --> 01:57:43,640
was a very popular sort of area of
science called cybernetics so it's sort

4212
01:57:43,640 --> 01:57:43,650
science called cybernetics so it's sort
 

4213
01:57:43,650 --> 01:57:45,530
science called cybernetics so it's sort
of it's not really computer science but

4214
01:57:45,530 --> 01:57:45,540
of it's not really computer science but
 

4215
01:57:45,540 --> 01:57:48,170
of it's not really computer science but
it's it was like you know computation or

4216
01:57:48,170 --> 01:57:48,180
it's it was like you know computation or
 

4217
01:57:48,180 --> 01:57:51,590
it's it was like you know computation or
robotics yes in this sense and so I

4218
01:57:51,590 --> 01:57:51,600
robotics yes in this sense and so I
 

4219
01:57:51,600 --> 01:57:56,480
robotics yes in this sense and so I
really wanted to do that and but then

4220
01:57:56,480 --> 01:57:56,490
really wanted to do that and but then
 

4221
01:57:56,490 --> 01:58:01,340
really wanted to do that and but then
you know I you know I realized that you

4222
01:58:01,340 --> 01:58:01,350
you know I you know I realized that you
 

4223
01:58:01,350 --> 01:58:04,810
you know I you know I realized that you
know my biggest passion was in

4224
01:58:04,810 --> 01:58:04,820
know my biggest passion was in
 

4225
01:58:04,820 --> 01:58:10,390
know my biggest passion was in
mathematics and later I you know when

4226
01:58:10,390 --> 01:58:10,400
mathematics and later I you know when
 

4227
01:58:10,400 --> 01:58:13,190
mathematics and later I you know when
you know studying in Moscow State

4228
01:58:13,190 --> 01:58:13,200
you know studying in Moscow State
 

4229
01:58:13,200 --> 01:58:15,620
you know studying in Moscow State
University I also realized that I really

4230
01:58:15,620 --> 01:58:15,630
University I also realized that I really
 

4231
01:58:15,630 --> 01:58:20,930
University I also realized that I really
want to apply the the knowledge so I

4232
01:58:20,930 --> 01:58:20,940
want to apply the the knowledge so I
 

4233
01:58:20,940 --> 01:58:26,030
want to apply the the knowledge so I
really wanted to to mix you know the

4234
01:58:26,030 --> 01:58:26,040
really wanted to to mix you know the
 

4235
01:58:26,040 --> 01:58:28,960
really wanted to to mix you know the
mathematical knowledge that I get with

4236
01:58:28,960 --> 01:58:28,970
mathematical knowledge that I get with
 

4237
01:58:28,970 --> 01:58:32,540
mathematical knowledge that I get with
real-life problems and that could be you

4238
01:58:32,540 --> 01:58:32,550
real-life problems and that could be you
 

4239
01:58:32,550 --> 01:58:37,070
real-life problems and that could be you
mentioned chemistry and now biology and

4240
01:58:37,070 --> 01:58:37,080
mentioned chemistry and now biology and
 

4241
01:58:37,080 --> 01:58:42,170
mentioned chemistry and now biology and
I sort of does it make you sad maybe I'm

4242
01:58:42,170 --> 01:58:42,180
I sort of does it make you sad maybe I'm
 

4243

I sort of does it make you sad maybe I'm
wrong on this but it seems like it's

4244
01:58:47,170 --> 01:58:47,180
wrong on this but it seems like it's
 

4245
01:58:47,180 --> 01:58:50,870
wrong on this but it seems like it's
difficult to be in collaboration to do

4246
01:58:50,870 --> 01:58:50,880
difficult to be in collaboration to do
 

4247
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:54,710
difficult to be in collaboration to do
open big science in Russia from my

4248
01:58:54,710 --> 01:58:54,720
open big science in Russia from my
 

4249
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:57,230
open big science in Russia from my
distant perspective in computer science

4250
01:58:57,230 --> 01:58:57,240
distant perspective in computer science
 

4251
01:58:57,240 --> 01:59:00,170
distant perspective in computer science
I don't I'm not like we can go to

4252
01:59:00,170 --> 01:59:00,180
I don't I'm not like we can go to

have collaborators in biometrics in

4270
01:59:22,970 --> 01:59:22,980
have collaborators in biometrics in
 

4271
01:59:22,980 --> 01:59:25,280
have collaborators in biometrics in
Russia and I think this is the divine

4272
01:59:25,280 --> 01:59:25,290
Russia and I think this is the divine
 

4273

Novosibirsk in st. Petersburg have great
collaborators in cousin and so at least

4280
01:59:43,970 --> 01:59:43,980
collaborators in cousin and so at least
 

4281
01:59:43,980 --> 01:59:50,089
collaborators in cousin and so at least
you know in terms of you know my area of

4287
01:59:55,380 --> 02:00:01,790
yes strong people a lot of great ideas
very open to collaborations so I perhaps

4288
02:00:01,790 --> 02:00:01,800
very open to collaborations so I perhaps
 

4289
02:00:01,800 --> 02:00:04,550
very open to collaborations so I perhaps
you know it's my luck but you know I

4290
02:00:04,550 --> 02:00:04,560
you know it's my luck but you know I
 

4291

you know it's my luck but you know I
haven't experienced you know any

4292
02:00:09,320 --> 02:00:09,330
haven't experienced you know any
 

4293
02:00:09,330 --> 02:00:10,700
haven't experienced you know any
difficulties in establishing

4294
02:00:10,700 --> 02:00:10,710
difficulties in establishing
 

4295

collaborations
 

4297
02:00:12,619 --> 02:00:15,229
collaborations
that's why informatics it could be bad

4298
02:00:15,229 --> 02:00:15,239
that's why informatics it could be bad
 

4299
02:00:15,239 --> 02:00:18,050
that's why informatics it could be bad
from a text to an ink yeah it's it could

4300
02:00:18,050 --> 02:00:18,060
from a text to an ink yeah it's it could
 

4301
02:00:18,060 --> 02:00:20,030
from a text to an ink yeah it's it could
be person by person related but I just

4302
02:00:20,030 --> 02:00:20,040
be person by person related but I just
 

4303
02:00:20,040 --> 02:00:22,850
be person by person related but I just
don't feel the warmth and love that I

4304
02:00:22,850 --> 02:00:22,860
don't feel the warmth and love that I
 

4305
02:00:22,860 --> 02:00:26,660
don't feel the warmth and love that I
would you know you talk about the

4306
02:00:26,660 --> 02:00:26,670
would you know you talk about the
 

4307
02:00:26,670 --> 02:00:28,459
would you know you talk about the
seminal people who are French in

4308
02:00:28,459 --> 02:00:28,469
seminal people who are French in
 

4309
02:00:28,469 --> 02:00:31,370
seminal people who are French in
artificial intelligence France welcomes

4310
02:00:31,370 --> 02:00:31,380
artificial intelligence France welcomes
 

4311
02:00:31,380 --> 02:00:34,430
artificial intelligence France welcomes
him with open arms in so many ways I

4312
02:00:34,430 --> 02:00:34,440
him with open arms in so many ways I
 

4313
02:00:34,440 --> 02:00:37,129
him with open arms in so many ways I
just don't feel the love from Russia I I

just don't feel the love from Russia I I
 

4315
02:00:37,139 --> 02:00:40,520
just don't feel the love from Russia I I
do on the human beings like people in

4316
02:00:40,520 --> 02:00:40,530
do on the human beings like people in
 

4317
02:00:40,530 --> 02:00:43,910
do on the human beings like people in
general like friends and and just cool

4318
02:00:43,910 --> 02:00:43,920
general like friends and and just cool
 

4319
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:45,200
general like friends and and just cool
interesting people but from the

4320
02:00:45,200 --> 02:00:45,210
interesting people but from the
 

4321
02:00:45,210 --> 02:00:46,339
interesting people but from the
scientific community

4322
02:00:46,339 --> 02:00:46,349
scientific community
 

4323
02:00:46,349 --> 02:00:49,160
scientific community
no conferences no big conferences and

4324
02:00:49,160 --> 02:00:49,170
no conferences no big conferences and
 

4325
02:00:49,170 --> 02:00:51,669
no conferences no big conferences and
it's uh yeah it's actually you know I

4326
02:00:51,669 --> 02:00:51,679
it's uh yeah it's actually you know I
 

4327
02:00:51,679 --> 02:00:55,520
it's uh yeah it's actually you know I
I'm trying to think yeah I cannot recall

4328
02:00:55,520 --> 02:00:55,530
I'm trying to think yeah I cannot recall
 

4329
02:00:55,530 --> 02:01:01,939
I'm trying to think yeah I cannot recall
any any big AI conferences in Russia it

4330
02:01:01,939 --> 02:01:01,949
any any big AI conferences in Russia it
 

4331
02:01:01,949 --> 02:01:03,800
any any big AI conferences in Russia it
has an effect on for me

4332
02:01:03,800 --> 02:01:03,810
has an effect on for me
 

4333
02:01:03,810 --> 02:01:07,129
has an effect on for me
I haven't sadly been back to Russia so I

4334
02:01:07,129 --> 02:01:07,139
I haven't sadly been back to Russia so I
 

4335
02:01:07,139 --> 02:01:09,320
I haven't sadly been back to Russia so I
should but my problem is it's very

4336
02:01:09,320 --> 02:01:09,330
should but my problem is it's very
 

4337
02:01:09,330 --> 02:01:12,260
should but my problem is it's very
difficult so I am now I have to renounce

4338
02:01:12,260 --> 02:01:12,270
difficult so I am now I have to renounce
 

4339
02:01:12,270 --> 02:01:15,229
difficult so I am now I have to renounce
the citizenship I was alright I mean I'm

4340
02:01:15,229 --> 02:01:15,239
the citizenship I was alright I mean I'm
 

4341
02:01:15,239 --> 02:01:16,729
the citizenship I was alright I mean I'm
a citizen in the United States and it

4342
02:01:16,729 --> 02:01:16,739
a citizen in the United States and it
 

4343
02:01:16,739 --> 02:01:18,350
a citizen in the United States and it
makes it very difficult there's a mess

4344
02:01:18,350 --> 02:01:18,360
makes it very difficult there's a mess
 

4345
02:01:18,360 --> 02:01:22,459
makes it very difficult there's a mess
now right so I want to be able to travel

4346
02:01:22,459 --> 02:01:22,469
now right so I want to be able to travel
 

4347
02:01:22,469 --> 02:01:27,109
now right so I want to be able to travel
like you know legitimately yeah and it's

4348
02:01:27,109 --> 02:01:27,119
like you know legitimately yeah and it's
 

4349
02:01:27,119 --> 02:01:29,120
like you know legitimately yeah and it's
it's not it's not an obvious process

4350
02:01:29,120 --> 02:01:29,130
it's not it's not an obvious process
 

4351
02:01:29,130 --> 02:01:30,320
it's not it's not an obvious process
they don't make it super easy I mean

4352
02:01:30,320 --> 02:01:30,330
they don't make it super easy I mean
 

4353
02:01:30,330 --> 02:01:30,740
they don't make it super easy I mean
that's

4354
02:01:30,740 --> 02:01:30,750
that's
 

4355
02:01:30,750 --> 02:01:32,960
that's
that like you know it should be super

4356
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:32,970
that like you know it should be super
 

4357
02:01:32,970 --> 02:01:35,090
that like you know it should be super
easy for me to travel there well you

4358
02:01:35,090 --> 02:01:35,100
easy for me to travel there well you
 

4359
02:01:35,100 --> 02:01:39,250
easy for me to travel there well you
know hopefully this unfortunate

4360
02:01:39,250 --> 02:01:39,260
know hopefully this unfortunate
 

4361
02:01:39,260 --> 02:01:42,130
know hopefully this unfortunate
circumstances that we are in will

4362
02:01:42,130 --> 02:01:42,140
circumstances that we are in will
 

4363
02:01:42,140 --> 02:01:46,630
circumstances that we are in will
actually promote the remote

4364
02:01:46,630 --> 02:01:46,640
actually promote the remote
 

4365
02:01:46,640 --> 02:01:50,530
actually promote the remote
collaborations yes and I think we weave

4366
02:01:50,530 --> 02:01:50,540
collaborations yes and I think we weave
 

4367
02:01:50,540 --> 02:01:54,020
collaborations yes and I think we weave
jr' experiencing right now is that you

4368
02:01:54,020 --> 02:01:54,030
jr' experiencing right now is that you
 

4369
02:01:54,030 --> 02:01:58,070
jr' experiencing right now is that you
still can do science you know being

4370
02:01:58,070 --> 02:01:58,080
still can do science you know being
 

4371
02:01:58,080 --> 02:02:00,800
still can do science you know being
current in in your own homes yeah

4372
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:00,810
current in in your own homes yeah
 

4373
02:02:00,810 --> 02:02:02,780
current in in your own homes yeah
especially when it comes I mean you know

4374
02:02:02,780 --> 02:02:02,790
especially when it comes I mean you know
 

4375
02:02:02,790 --> 02:02:04,610
especially when it comes I mean you know
I I certainly understand there is a very

4376
02:02:04,610 --> 02:02:04,620
I I certainly understand there is a very
 

4377
02:02:04,620 --> 02:02:06,350
I I certainly understand there is a very
challenging time for experimental

4378
02:02:06,350 --> 02:02:06,360
challenging time for experimental
 

4379
02:02:06,360 --> 02:02:08,540
challenging time for experimental
scientists and and I have many

4380
02:02:08,540 --> 02:02:08,550
scientists and and I have many
 

4381
02:02:08,550 --> 02:02:10,910
scientists and and I have many
collaborators who are you know who are

4382
02:02:10,910 --> 02:02:10,920
collaborators who are you know who are
 

4383
02:02:10,920 --> 02:02:13,280
collaborators who are you know who are
affected by that but for computational

4384
02:02:13,280 --> 02:02:13,290
affected by that but for computational
 

4385
02:02:13,290 --> 02:02:15,800
affected by that but for computational
scientists they are really leading into

4386
02:02:15,800 --> 02:02:15,810
scientists they are really leading into
 

4387
02:02:15,810 --> 02:02:18,260
scientists they are really leading into
the remote communication nevertheless I

4388
02:02:18,260 --> 02:02:18,270
the remote communication nevertheless I
 

4389
02:02:18,270 --> 02:02:21,140
the remote communication nevertheless I
had to force you to talk to you in

4390
02:02:21,140 --> 02:02:21,150
had to force you to talk to you in
 

4391
02:02:21,150 --> 02:02:22,340
had to force you to talk to you in
person because there's something that

4392
02:02:22,340 --> 02:02:22,350
person because there's something that
 

4393
02:02:22,350 --> 02:02:24,560
person because there's something that
you just can't do in terms of

4394
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:24,570
you just can't do in terms of
 

4395
02:02:24,570 --> 02:02:26,030
you just can't do in terms of
conversation like this I don't know why

4396
02:02:26,030 --> 02:02:26,040
conversation like this I don't know why

really appreciate you doing it you have
a collection of science bobbleheads yes

4402
02:02:35,560 --> 02:02:35,570
a collection of science bobbleheads yes
 

4403
02:02:35,570 --> 02:02:39,140
a collection of science bobbleheads yes
which look amazing which which

4404
02:02:39,140 --> 02:02:39,150
which look amazing which which
 

4405
02:02:39,150 --> 02:02:42,170
which look amazing which which
bobblehead is your favorite and which

4406
02:02:42,170 --> 02:02:42,180
bobblehead is your favorite and which
 

4407
02:02:42,180 --> 02:02:44,690
bobblehead is your favorite and which
real-world version which scientist is

4408
02:02:44,690 --> 02:02:44,700
real-world version which scientist is
 

4409
02:02:44,700 --> 02:02:48,050
real-world version which scientist is
your favorite yeah so yeah by the way I

4410
02:02:48,050 --> 02:02:48,060
your favorite yeah so yeah by the way I
 

4411
02:02:48,060 --> 02:02:50,540
your favorite yeah so yeah by the way I
was trying to bring it in but they're

4412
02:02:50,540 --> 02:02:50,550
was trying to bring it in but they're
 

4413
02:02:50,550 --> 02:02:54,140
was trying to bring it in but they're
cranking now in my in my office they

4414
02:02:54,140 --> 02:02:54,150
cranking now in my in my office they
 

4415
02:02:54,150 --> 02:02:56,540
cranking now in my in my office they
sort of demonstrate the social distance

4416
02:02:56,540 --> 02:02:56,550
sort of demonstrate the social distance
 

4417
02:02:56,550 --> 02:03:00,740
sort of demonstrate the social distance
so they're nicely spaced away from each

4418
02:03:00,740 --> 02:03:00,750
so they're nicely spaced away from each
 

4419
02:03:00,750 --> 02:03:03,920
so they're nicely spaced away from each
other but so you know it's interesting

4420
02:03:03,920 --> 02:03:03,930
other but so you know it's interesting
 

4421
02:03:03,930 --> 02:03:06,020
other but so you know it's interesting
so I've been I've been collecting those

4422
02:03:06,020 --> 02:03:06,030
so I've been I've been collecting those
 

4423
02:03:06,030 --> 02:03:10,100
so I've been I've been collecting those
bubble has for the past maybe twelve or

4424
02:03:10,100 --> 02:03:10,110
bubble has for the past maybe twelve or
 

4425
02:03:10,110 --> 02:03:13,090
bubble has for the past maybe twelve or
thirteen years and it you know

4426
02:03:13,090 --> 02:03:13,100
thirteen years and it you know
 

4427
02:03:13,100 --> 02:03:15,710
thirteen years and it you know
interesting enough it started with the

4428
02:03:15,710 --> 02:03:15,720
interesting enough it started with the
 

4429
02:03:15,720 --> 02:03:21,160
interesting enough it started with the
two bubble heads of Watson and Crick and

4430
02:03:21,160 --> 02:03:21,170

 

4431
02:03:21,170 --> 02:03:24,410

interestingly enough my last bubble had

4432
02:03:24,410 --> 02:03:24,420
interestingly enough my last bubble had
 

4433
02:03:24,420 --> 02:03:26,990
interestingly enough my last bubble had
in this collection for now and my

4434
02:03:26,990 --> 02:03:27,000
in this collection for now and my
 

4435
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:30,560
in this collection for now and my
favorite one cuz I felt so good when I

4436
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:30,570
favorite one cuz I felt so good when I
 

4437
02:03:30,570 --> 02:03:37,010
favorite one cuz I felt so good when I
got it was the rosalind Franklin and so

4438
02:03:37,010 --> 02:03:37,020
got it was the rosalind Franklin and so
 

4439
02:03:37,020 --> 02:03:39,320
got it was the rosalind Franklin and so
so you know when I go who's the full

4440
02:03:39,320 --> 02:03:39,330
so you know when I go who's the full
 

4441
02:03:39,330 --> 02:03:43,220
so you know when I go who's the full
group so I have what some Creek Newton

4442
02:03:43,220 --> 02:03:43,230
group so I have what some Creek Newton

Moscow yes so but then I mean you know

4482
02:05:05,710 --> 02:05:05,720
Moscow yes so but then I mean you know
 

4483
02:05:05,720 --> 02:05:08,540
Moscow yes so but then I mean you know
other people that I would definitely

4484
02:05:08,540 --> 02:05:08,550
other people that I would definitely
 

4485
02:05:08,550 --> 02:05:12,020
other people that I would definitely
like to see in my collections was would

4486
02:05:12,020 --> 02:05:12,030
like to see in my collections was would
 

4487
02:05:12,030 --> 02:05:17,620
like to see in my collections was would
be Alan Turing would be John von Neumann

4488
02:05:17,620 --> 02:05:17,630
be Alan Turing would be John von Neumann
 

4489
02:05:17,630 --> 02:05:20,000
be Alan Turing would be John von Neumann
yeah you're a little bit later in the

4490
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:20,010
yeah you're a little bit later in the
 

4491
02:05:20,010 --> 02:05:22,850
yeah you're a little bit later in the
computer scientists yes well I mean they

4492
02:05:22,850 --> 02:05:22,860
computer scientists yes well I mean they
 

4493
02:05:22,860 --> 02:05:24,830
computer scientists yes well I mean they
don't they don't make them you know III

4494
02:05:24,830 --> 02:05:24,840
don't they don't make them you know III
 

4495
02:05:24,840 --> 02:05:27,170
don't they don't make them you know III
still I'm amazed they they haven't made

4496
02:05:27,170 --> 02:05:27,180
still I'm amazed they they haven't made
 

4497
02:05:27,180 --> 02:05:33,290
still I'm amazed they they haven't made
Alan Turing yeah yet yes and and and I

4498
02:05:33,290 --> 02:05:33,300
Alan Turing yeah yet yes and and and I
 

4499
02:05:33,300 --> 02:05:37,490
Alan Turing yeah yet yes and and and I
would also add the Linus Pauling line is

4500
02:05:37,490 --> 02:05:37,500
would also add the Linus Pauling line is
 

4501
02:05:37,500 --> 02:05:41,450
would also add the Linus Pauling line is
falling so with Linus point so this is

4502
02:05:41,450 --> 02:05:41,460
falling so with Linus point so this is
 

4503
02:05:41,460 --> 02:05:44,920
falling so with Linus point so this is
this is to me is one of the greatest

4504
02:05:44,920 --> 02:05:44,930
this is to me is one of the greatest
 

4505
02:05:44,930 --> 02:05:50,870
this is to me is one of the greatest
chemists and the person who actually

4506
02:05:50,870 --> 02:05:50,880
chemists and the person who actually
 

4507
02:05:50,880 --> 02:05:53,140
chemists and the person who actually
discovered

4508
02:05:53,140 --> 02:05:53,150
discovered
 

4509
02:05:53,150 --> 02:05:55,930
discovered
secondary structure of proteins was very

4510
02:05:55,930 --> 02:05:55,940
secondary structure of proteins was very
 

4511
02:05:55,940 --> 02:06:01,620
secondary structure of proteins was very
close to solving the DNA structure and

4512
02:06:01,620 --> 02:06:01,630
close to solving the DNA structure and
 

4513
02:06:01,630 --> 02:06:05,979
close to solving the DNA structure and
you know people argue but some of them

4514
02:06:05,979 --> 02:06:05,989
you know people argue but some of them
 

4515
02:06:05,989 --> 02:06:09,300
you know people argue but some of them
were pretty sure that if not for this

4516
02:06:09,300 --> 02:06:09,310
were pretty sure that if not for this
 

4517
02:06:09,310 --> 02:06:12,430
were pretty sure that if not for this
you know

4518
02:06:12,430 --> 02:06:12,440
you know
 

4519
02:06:12,440 --> 02:06:16,660
you know
photograph 51 by rosalind Franklin that

4520
02:06:16,660 --> 02:06:16,670
photograph 51 by rosalind Franklin that
 

4521
02:06:16,670 --> 02:06:21,669
photograph 51 by rosalind Franklin that
you know what Sun Cree got access to he

4522
02:06:21,669 --> 02:06:21,679
you know what Sun Cree got access to he
 

4523
02:06:21,679 --> 02:06:26,880
you know what Sun Cree got access to he
would be he would be the one who so

4524
02:06:26,880 --> 02:06:26,890
would be he would be the one who so
 

4525
02:06:26,890 --> 02:06:30,930
would be he would be the one who so
sense is a funny race

4526
02:06:30,930 --> 02:06:30,940

 

4527
02:06:30,940 --> 02:06:33,850

let me ask the biggest the most

4528
02:06:33,850 --> 02:06:33,860
let me ask the biggest the most
 

4529
02:06:33,860 --> 02:06:36,010
let me ask the biggest the most
ridiculous question so you've kind of

4530
02:06:36,010 --> 02:06:36,020
ridiculous question so you've kind of
 

4531
02:06:36,020 --> 02:06:42,040
ridiculous question so you've kind of
studied the human body and its defenses

4532
02:06:42,040 --> 02:06:42,050
studied the human body and its defenses
 

4533
02:06:42,050 --> 02:06:47,590
studied the human body and its defenses
and these enemies that are about from a

4534
02:06:47,590 --> 02:06:47,600
and these enemies that are about from a
 

4535
02:06:47,600 --> 02:06:49,149
and these enemies that are about from a
biological perspective and from a tax

4536
02:06:49,149 --> 02:06:49,159
biological perspective and from a tax
 

4537
02:06:49,159 --> 02:06:50,680
biological perspective and from a tax
perspective a computer scientist

4538
02:06:50,680 --> 02:06:50,690
perspective a computer scientist
 

4539
02:06:50,690 --> 02:06:54,370
perspective a computer scientist
perspective how is that made you see

4540
02:06:54,370 --> 02:06:54,380
perspective how is that made you see
 

4541
02:06:54,380 --> 02:06:58,120
perspective how is that made you see
your own life sort of the meaning of it

4542
02:06:58,120 --> 02:06:58,130
your own life sort of the meaning of it
 

4543
02:06:58,130 --> 02:07:01,930
your own life sort of the meaning of it
or just even seeing your what it means

4544
02:07:01,930 --> 02:07:01,940
or just even seeing your what it means
 

4545
02:07:01,940 --> 02:07:03,630
or just even seeing your what it means
to be human

4546
02:07:03,630 --> 02:07:03,640
to be human
 

4547
02:07:03,640 --> 02:07:08,590
to be human
well it certainly makes me realizing how

4548
02:07:08,590 --> 02:07:08,600
well it certainly makes me realizing how
 

4549
02:07:08,600 --> 02:07:13,450
well it certainly makes me realizing how
fragile the human life is if you think

4550
02:07:13,450 --> 02:07:13,460
fragile the human life is if you think
 

4551
02:07:13,460 --> 02:07:18,060
fragile the human life is if you think
