he puts Steve above like elons of the
 

279
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,110
he puts Steve above like elons of the
world because Steve is a designer not

he's a designer engineer but he's a

282
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:53,280
he's a designer engineer but he's a
 

283
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,950
he's a designer engineer but he's a
design he's a Visionary in the design

284
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:54,960
design he's a Visionary in the design
 

285
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,050
design he's a Visionary in the design
space well I would link to him because

286
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:57,060
space well I would link to him because
 

287
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,610
space well I would link to him because
I'm not an engineer right so I'm more

I'm not an engineer right so I'm more
like then you're an engineer if if Steve

290
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:00,539
like then you're an engineer if if Steve
 

291
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:01,909
like then you're an engineer if if Steve
is an engineer you're an engineer

292
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:01,919
is an engineer you're an engineer

yeah I mean
 

563
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:43,310
yeah I mean
it's just the the DNA is like she's a

564
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:43,320
it's just the the DNA is like she's a
 

565

mix of Rob and Chris
can you explain

568
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:46,920
can you explain
 

569
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,590
can you explain
I mean that's like

570

I mean that's like
 

571
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,750
I mean that's like
a really high pool right there

evolution of the human species created
 

579
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:08,210
evolution of the human species created
this DNA that created this being there's

580
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:08,220
this DNA that created this being there's
 

581
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,370
this DNA that created this being there's
a life there there's a set of memories

582
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:10,380
a life there there's a set of memories
 

583
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,050
a life there there's a set of memories
in the history that brought you together

00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:12,060
in the history that brought you together
 

585
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,650
in the history that brought you together
and you're like damn I like this DNA

586
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:15,660
and you're like damn I like this DNA
 

587
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,170
and you're like damn I like this DNA
yeah and so certain people have just

588
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:18,180
yeah and so certain people have just
 

589
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:22,610
yeah and so certain people have just
like hi DNA Ivanka Trump has high DNA

590
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:22,620
like hi DNA Ivanka Trump has high DNA
 

591
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,250
like hi DNA Ivanka Trump has high DNA
you know it's like how's your DNA

592
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:25,260
you know it's like how's your DNA
 

593
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,730
you know it's like how's your DNA
pretty good uh I I think we've seen that

594
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:28,740
pretty good uh I I think we've seen that
 

595
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,949
pretty good uh I I think we've seen that
it's been proven I mean but look at my

cells
 

679
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,910
cells
that are very

680
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:10,920

there's something different that's there

694
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:28,680

 

695
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,710

so
what are you drawing I'm drawing these

698
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:33,120
what are you drawing I'm drawing these
 

699
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,970
what are you drawing I'm drawing these
new living cells that we will exist in

700
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:36,980
new living cells that we will exist in
 

701
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,189
new living cells that we will exist in
and this is over

702
00:14:40,189 --> 00:14:40,199
and this is over
 

703
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:44,990
and this is over
okay let's do like

704
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:45,000

 

705
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,790

like man make money up anyways like four
 

709
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,230
like man make money up anyways like four
quadrillion

710
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:51,240
quadrillion
 

711
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,870
quadrillion
respected dollars and then you have

712
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:53,880
respected dollars and then you have
 

713
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,569
respected dollars and then you have
other forms of currency of course social

714
00:14:56,569 --> 00:14:56,579
other forms of currency of course social
 

715
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:58,129
other forms of currency of course social
currency is super important right now

716
00:14:58,129 --> 00:14:58,139
currency is super important right now
 

717
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:01,730
currency is super important right now
but this is a drawing

718
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:01,740
but this is a drawing
 

719
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,610
but this is a drawing
and it's at a pretty good place

720
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:04,620
and it's at a pretty good place
 

721
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,030
and it's at a pretty good place
now this will be forty thousand square

722
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:08,040
now this will be forty thousand square
 

723
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,769
now this will be forty thousand square

I'll just draw a person here for scale
 

733
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:23,870
I'll just draw a person here for scale
uh yeah that would help

734
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:23,880
uh yeah that would help
 

735
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,730

what do you think of that look at my
 

739
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,629
what do you think of that look at my
person see the scale in this room

740
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:29,639
person see the scale in this room
 

741
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:31,970
person see the scale in this room
all right so

742
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:31,980
all right so
 

743
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,269
all right so
wait the dot is the person yeah

744
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:35,279
wait the dot is the person yeah
 

745
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,790
wait the dot is the person yeah
I'm saying it's 40 000 square feet

746
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:37,800
I'm saying it's 40 000 square feet
 

747
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,530
I'm saying it's 40 000 square feet
but that would be like what are the

748
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:39,540
but that would be like what are the
 

749
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,210
but that would be like what are the
other parts of the cell

750
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:41,220
other parts of the cell
 

751
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,730
other parts of the cell
okay so what it's a screen it doesn't go

752
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:43,740
okay so what it's a screen it doesn't go
 

753
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,470
okay so what it's a screen it doesn't go
all the all the way to the top and it's

754
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:45,480
all the all the way to the top and it's
 

755
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,889
all the all the way to the top and it's
one hole for light but the water and the

756
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:48,899
one hole for light but the water and the
 

757
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:50,509
one hole for light but the water and the
light and air all come in from the top

758
00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:50,519
light and air all come in from the top
 

759
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:52,490
light and air all come in from the top
so that's like

760
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:52,500
so that's like
 

761
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,250
so that's like
like the mouth and then this is the

762
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:55,260
like the mouth and then this is the
 

763

connected yes I'm drawing how these
other cells go next to each other what's

772
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:06,660
other cells go next to each other what's

of
okay one of one of the things okay let's

okay one of one of the things okay let's
 

985
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,770
okay one of one of the things okay let's
go back to the sale explanation because

go back to the sale explanation because
I'm also doing it what's that thing when

988
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:18,480
I'm also doing it what's that thing when
 

989
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,570
I'm also doing it what's that thing when
Elon just put all the information open

990
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:20,580
Elon just put all the information open
 

991
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,650
Elon just put all the information open
and people could figure out if they

um so where I've got to with my research

1008
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:45,360
um so where I've got to with my research
 

1009
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,710
um so where I've got to with my research
is that there will be a hole at the top

1010
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:47,720
is that there will be a hole at the top
 

1011
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,990
is that there will be a hole at the top
that allows natural light

1012
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:51,000
that allows natural light
 

1013
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,490
that allows natural light
natural air and there's a constant water

1014
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:55,500
natural air and there's a constant water
 

1015
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,529
natural air and there's a constant water
system so it becomes like a water city

1016
00:20:57,529 --> 00:20:57,539
system so it becomes like a water city
 

1017
00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:00,650
system so it becomes like a water city
where it's a constant flow uh that's not

1018
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:00,660
where it's a constant flow uh that's not
 

1019
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,810
where it's a constant flow uh that's not
it's it's regenerative it's not wasting

1020
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:02,820
it's it's regenerative it's not wasting
 

1021
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,330
it's it's regenerative it's not wasting
the water and it's just a constant flow

1022
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:05,340
the water and it's just a constant flow
 

1023
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,909
the water and it's just a constant flow
so I put the toilet really close to

1024
00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:07,919
so I put the toilet really close to
 

1025
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,510
so I put the toilet really close to
where this uh this

1026
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:11,520
where this uh this
 

1027
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,070
where this uh this
um I don't want to call it a wave pool

1028
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:13,080
um I don't want to call it a wave pool
 

1029
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,690
um I don't want to call it a wave pool
but in the pool the water is not still

1030
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:14,700
but in the pool the water is not still
 

1031
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,890
but in the pool the water is not still
so that exists in in water

1032
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:18,900
so that exists in in water
 

1033
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,750
so that exists in in water

yes like right now okay say I got this
 

1145
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:48,110
yes like right now okay say I got this
pattern cutter that I wanted

1146
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:48,120
pattern cutter that I wanted
 

1147
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,830
pattern cutter that I wanted
to remove because I felt like she was

1148
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:50,840
to remove because I felt like she was
 

1149
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,970
to remove because I felt like she was
copying our patterns into the computer

1150
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:52,980
copying our patterns into the computer
 

1151
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,010
copying our patterns into the computer
and I didn't know why she wanted to do

1152
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:55,020
and I didn't know why she wanted to do
 

1153

that and I just wanted to do the
 

1155
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,890
that and I just wanted to do the
patterns by hand

1156
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:57,900
patterns by hand
 

1157
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,529
patterns by hand
and then you know you mean like

1158
00:24:00,529 --> 00:24:00,539
and then you know you mean like
 

1159
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,990
and then you know you mean like
automating the patterns is that yeah and

1160
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:03,000
automating the patterns is that yeah and
 

1161
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,090
automating the patterns is that yeah and
my head of it because they just that's

1162
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:05,100
my head of it because they just that's
 

1163
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,149
my head of it because they just that's
the whole thing it's like

1164
00:24:08,149 --> 00:24:08,159

 

1165
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,490

1166
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:10,500
it's a war of it's a war of human beings
 

1167
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,770
it's a war of it's a war of human beings
and robots yeah but that makes it more

1168
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:12,780
and robots yeah but that makes it more
 

1169
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,029
and robots yeah but that makes it more
efficient right you don't like the

1170
00:24:14,029 --> 00:24:14,039
efficient right you don't like the
 

1171

efficient right you don't like the
efficiency you like the creativity of

1172
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:15,900
efficiency you like the creativity of
 

1173
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,230
efficiency you like the creativity of
the singular nature of the pattern I

1174
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:18,240
the singular nature of the pattern I
 

1175
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,049
the singular nature of the pattern I
believe that the human beings and I'm

01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:57,770
um
designer yeah of all time uh to

4086
01:26:57,770 --> 01:26:57,780
designer yeah of all time uh to
 

4087
01:26:57,780 --> 01:26:58,790
designer yeah of all time uh to
um

4088
01:26:58,790 --> 01:26:58,800
um
 

4089
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:00,790
um
to say we're going to use biodegradable

4090
01:27:00,790 --> 01:27:00,800
to say we're going to use biodegradable
 

4091
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:05,570
to say we're going to use biodegradable
uh clothing now the issue there is

4092
01:27:05,570 --> 01:27:05,580
uh clothing now the issue there is
 

4093
01:27:05,580 --> 01:27:06,669
uh clothing now the issue there is
um

4094
01:27:06,669 --> 01:27:06,679
um
 

4095
01:27:06,679 --> 01:27:09,530
um
the elastic

4096
01:27:09,530 --> 01:27:09,540
the elastic
 

4097
01:27:09,540 --> 01:27:11,930
the elastic
is not biodegradable

4098
01:27:11,930 --> 01:27:11,940
is not biodegradable
 

4099
01:27:11,940 --> 01:27:14,689
is not biodegradable
so that means it's actually better to

4100
01:27:14,689 --> 01:27:14,699
so that means it's actually better to
 

4101
01:27:14,699 --> 01:27:17,750
so that means it's actually better to
use genes and a belt

4102
01:27:17,750 --> 01:27:17,760
use genes and a belt
 

4103
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:20,990
use genes and a belt
than to have an elastic waistband

4104
01:27:20,990 --> 01:27:21,000
than to have an elastic waistband
 

4105
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,669
than to have an elastic waistband
because elastic waistband is not

4106
01:27:22,669 --> 01:27:22,679
because elastic waistband is not
 

4107
01:27:22,679 --> 01:27:24,410
because elastic waistband is not
biodegradable

4108
01:27:24,410 --> 01:27:24,420
biodegradable
 

4109
01:27:24,420 --> 01:27:28,610
biodegradable
so I use the planet

4110
01:27:28,610 --> 01:27:28,620
so I use the planet
 

4111
01:27:28,620 --> 01:27:31,669
so I use the planet
as a big the future of the planet is a

4112
01:27:31,669 --> 01:27:31,679
as a big the future of the planet is a
 

4113
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:35,149
as a big the future of the planet is a
big piece of

4114
01:27:35,149 --> 01:27:35,159
big piece of
 

4115
01:27:35,159 --> 01:27:38,450
big piece of
the way I Engineer and the way we talk

4116
01:27:38,450 --> 01:27:38,460
the way I Engineer and the way we talk
 

4117
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:40,250
the way I Engineer and the way we talk
about where designs are going the

4118
01:27:40,250 --> 01:27:40,260
about where designs are going the
 

4119
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:41,810
about where designs are going the
constraints on your design and

4120
01:27:41,810 --> 01:27:41,820
constraints on your design and
 

4121
01:27:41,820 --> 01:27:43,970
constraints on your design and
Engineering is given by the planet by

4122
01:27:43,970 --> 01:27:43,980
Engineering is given by the planet by
 

4123
01:27:43,980 --> 01:27:46,910
Engineering is given by the planet by
the future of the planet yes

4124
01:27:46,910 --> 01:27:46,920
the future of the planet yes
 

4125
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:48,590
the future of the planet yes

listened to a lot of debates because
 

4157
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:33,290
listened to a lot of debates because
it's really humbling

4158
01:28:33,290 --> 01:28:33,300
it's really humbling
 

4159
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:37,310
it's really humbling
that the the question of when does Life

4160

is a really difficult question
 

4165
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:43,490
is a really difficult question
for me as an engineer and scientist

4166
01:28:43,490 --> 01:28:43,500
for me as an engineer and scientist
 

4167
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:46,129
for me as an engineer and scientist
it's a philosophical question I mean we

4168
01:28:46,129 --> 01:28:46,139
it's a philosophical question I mean we
 

4169
01:28:46,139 --> 01:28:47,930
it's a philosophical question I mean we
could just go on population control not

could just go on population control not
 

4171

could say factually
 

4175
01:28:53,699 --> 01:28:57,530
could say factually

01:29:00,169 --> 01:29:00,179
for population control and it is
 

4179
01:29:00,179 --> 01:29:02,750
for population control and it is
controlling the population as is the

a lot of organizations use tragedy it

5364
01:53:51,290 --> 01:53:51,300
a lot of organizations use tragedy it
 

5365
01:53:51,300 --> 01:53:52,370
a lot of organizations use tragedy it
and

5366
01:53:52,370 --> 01:53:52,380
and
 

5367
01:53:52,380 --> 01:53:53,870
and
um and I watched the Candace Owens

5368
01:53:53,870 --> 01:53:53,880
um and I watched the Candace Owens
 

5369

documentary
and what was your take on it

5372
01:53:57,530 --> 01:53:57,540
and what was your take on it
 

5373
01:53:57,540 --> 01:53:59,390
and what was your take on it
I think it's important to question the

5374
01:53:59,390 --> 01:53:59,400
I think it's important to question the
 

5375
01:53:59,400 --> 01:54:01,910
I think it's important to question the
mainstream narratives but I don't agree

mainstream narratives but I don't agree
 

5377
01:54:01,920 --> 01:54:04,669

with it I still believe that George

5378
01:54:04,669 --> 01:54:04,679
with it I still believe that George
 

5379
01:54:04,679 --> 01:54:05,750

died

5382
01:54:07,669 --> 01:54:07,679
died
 

5383
01:54:07,679 --> 01:54:09,830
died
from the knee of the cop

5384
01:54:09,830 --> 01:54:09,840
from the knee of the cop
 

5385
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:12,649
from the knee of the cop
not from Fentanyl and and even if that

5386
01:54:12,649 --> 01:54:12,659
not from Fentanyl and and even if that
 

5387
01:54:12,659 --> 01:54:15,290
not from Fentanyl and and even if that
was the case there's still 50 percent of

5388
01:54:15,290 --> 01:54:15,300
was the case there's still 50 percent of
 

5389
01:54:15,300 --> 01:54:20,570
was the case there's still 50 percent of
black deaths is actually abortion

5390
01:54:20,570 --> 01:54:20,580

 

5391
01:54:20,580 --> 01:54:22,910

so let's get into engineering let's just

5392
01:54:22,910 --> 01:54:22,920
so let's get into engineering let's just
 

5393
01:54:22,920 --> 01:54:24,470
so let's get into engineering let's just
go because that's how do you fix that

5394
01:54:24,470 --> 01:54:24,480
go because that's how do you fix that
 

5395
01:54:24,480 --> 01:54:28,250
go because that's how do you fix that
population control of social engineering

5396
01:54:28,250 --> 01:54:28,260
population control of social engineering
 

5397
01:54:28,260 --> 01:54:31,669
population control of social engineering
and and it's most literal form

5398
01:54:31,669 --> 01:54:31,679
and and it's most literal form
 

5399
01:54:31,679 --> 01:54:34,189
and and it's most literal form
the blacks that are under population

5400
01:54:34,189 --> 01:54:34,199
the blacks that are under population
 

5401

the blacks that are under population
control

control
 

5403
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:38,090
control
that's something that I mean that's just

5404
01:54:38,090 --> 01:54:38,100
that's something that I mean that's just
 

5405
01:54:38,100 --> 01:54:40,370
that's something that I mean that's just
what it is African-Americans are not

5406
01:54:40,370 --> 01:54:40,380
what it is African-Americans are not
 

5407

first of all knowledge because knowledge
 

5451
01:55:37,139 --> 01:55:39,890
first of all knowledge because knowledge
is the most important resource to our

species above water knowledge it's
 

5455
01:55:43,679 --> 01:55:46,189
species above water knowledge it's
itself because then you can go get water

but the baby doesn't have it you know so
 

5463
01:55:51,780 --> 01:55:55,129

that those with the knowledge teach the
 

5471
01:56:03,239 --> 01:56:05,570
that those with the knowledge teach the
baby how to find the water themselves

on the stove
 

6123
02:09:04,380 --> 02:09:07,070
on the stove
so how do we get to engineering there's

6124
02:09:07,070 --> 02:09:07,080
so how do we get to engineering there's
 

6125
02:09:07,080 --> 02:09:09,530
so how do we get to engineering there's
a deal to be done here not saying you're

with engineering opportunities for a

6138
02:09:23,390 --> 02:09:23,400
with engineering opportunities for a
 

6139
02:09:23,400 --> 02:09:24,589
with engineering opportunities for a
long time I thought somebody should

6140
02:09:24,589 --> 02:09:24,599
long time I thought somebody should
 

6141
02:09:24,599 --> 02:09:26,270

and it looks like
 

6145
02:09:28,500 --> 02:09:31,129
and it looks like
great engineering can do that you got

6146
02:09:31,129 --> 02:09:31,139
great engineering can do that you got
 

6147
02:09:31,139 --> 02:09:32,450
great engineering can do that you got
two at one time from two of your

but other than that Instagram but I was
 

6221
02:11:01,619 --> 02:11:04,070
but other than that Instagram but I was
like well Instagram is porn also it's

like well Instagram is porn also it's
like soft it's more subtle it's not

6224
02:11:06,589 --> 02:11:06,599
like soft it's more subtle it's not
 

6225
02:11:06,599 --> 02:11:08,629
like soft it's more subtle it's not
telling you it's not it's not

6226
02:11:08,629 --> 02:11:08,639
telling you it's not it's not
 

6227
02:11:08,639 --> 02:11:10,070

conservative

6228
02:11:10,070 --> 02:11:10,080
conservative
 

6229
02:11:10,080 --> 02:11:12,169
conservative
by any means

6230
02:11:12,169 --> 02:11:12,179
by any means
 

6231
02:11:12,179 --> 02:11:14,629
by any means
you know and I mean that's the thing you

6232
02:11:14,629 --> 02:11:14,639
you know and I mean that's the thing you
 

6233
02:11:14,639 --> 02:11:15,950
you know and I mean that's the thing you
have to please a lot of people with

6234
02:11:15,950 --> 02:11:15,960
have to please a lot of people with
 

6235
02:11:15,960 --> 02:11:19,310
have to please a lot of people with
these platforms and I think the goal of

6236
02:11:19,310 --> 02:11:19,320
these platforms and I think the goal of
 

6237
02:11:19,320 --> 02:11:22,250
these platforms and I think the goal of
a platform should be to um help

6238
02:11:22,250 --> 02:11:22,260
a platform should be to um help
 

6239
02:11:22,260 --> 02:11:24,669
a platform should be to um help
individuals

6240
02:11:24,669 --> 02:11:24,679
individuals
 

6241
02:11:24,679 --> 02:11:28,370
individuals
maximize their long-term happiness and

6242
02:11:28,370 --> 02:11:28,380
maximize their long-term happiness and
 

6243
02:11:28,380 --> 02:11:31,030
maximize their long-term happiness and
growth like intellectually

6244
02:11:31,030 --> 02:11:31,040
growth like intellectually
 

6245
02:11:31,040 --> 02:11:33,589
growth like intellectually
spiritually psychologically all that

6246
02:11:33,589 --> 02:11:33,599
spiritually psychologically all that
 

6247
02:11:33,599 --> 02:11:35,330
spiritually psychologically all that
it's a tricky thing to figure out how to

6248
02:11:35,330 --> 02:11:35,340
it's a tricky thing to figure out how to
 

6249
02:11:35,340 --> 02:11:36,350
it's a tricky thing to figure out how to
do that

6250
02:11:36,350 --> 02:11:36,360
do that
 

6251
02:11:36,360 --> 02:11:38,149
do that
of course you could just have a platform

6252
02:11:38,149 --> 02:11:38,159
of course you could just have a platform
 

6253
02:11:38,159 --> 02:11:39,709
of course you could just have a platform
that's just strictly for fun I think

6254
02:11:39,709 --> 02:11:39,719
that's just strictly for fun I think
 

6255
02:11:39,719 --> 02:11:41,770
that's just strictly for fun I think
that's where Tick Tock leans

6256
02:11:41,770 --> 02:11:41,780
that's where Tick Tock leans
 

6257
02:11:41,780 --> 02:11:43,430
that's where Tick Tock leans
but

6258
02:11:43,430 --> 02:11:43,440
but
 

6259
02:11:43,440 --> 02:11:45,410
but
um there has I think there's a balance

6260
02:11:45,410 --> 02:11:45,420
um there has I think there's a balance
 

6261
02:11:45,420 --> 02:11:47,450
um there has I think there's a balance
to strike like Twitter there's a lot of

6262
02:11:47,450 --> 02:11:47,460
to strike like Twitter there's a lot of
 

6263
02:11:47,460 --> 02:11:49,010
to strike like Twitter there's a lot of
intellectual philosophical stuff going

6264
02:11:49,010 --> 02:11:49,020
intellectual philosophical stuff going
 

6265
02:11:49,020 --> 02:11:50,810
intellectual philosophical stuff going
on on Twitter but it somehow currently

6266
02:11:50,810 --> 02:11:50,820
on on Twitter but it somehow currently
 

6267
02:11:50,820 --> 02:11:52,850
on on Twitter but it somehow currently
makes it too easy to be divisive and
