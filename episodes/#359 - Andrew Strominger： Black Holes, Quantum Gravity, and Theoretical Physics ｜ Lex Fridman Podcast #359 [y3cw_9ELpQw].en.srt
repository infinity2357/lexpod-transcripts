a black hole is a mirror

2
00:00:02,869 --> 00:00:02,879
a black hole is a mirror
 

3
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,289
a black hole is a mirror
and the way it's a mirror is if light a

00:00:06,289 --> 00:00:06,299
and the way it's a mirror is if light a
 

5
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:09,890
and the way it's a mirror is if light a
photon bounces off your face

6
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:09,900
photon bounces off your face
 

7
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,169
photon bounces off your face
towards the black hole and it goes

8
00:00:12,169 --> 00:00:12,179
towards the black hole and it goes
 

9
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,450
towards the black hole and it goes
straight to the black hole just Falls in

10
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:14,460
straight to the black hole just Falls in
 

11
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,609
straight to the black hole just Falls in
you never see it again

12
00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:16,619
you never see it again
 

13
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:20,510
you never see it again
but if it just misses the black hole

14
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:20,520
but if it just misses the black hole
 

15
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,450
but if it just misses the black hole
it'll swing around the back and come

16
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:23,460
it'll swing around the back and come
 

17
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,890
it'll swing around the back and come
back to you

18
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:24,900
back to you
 

19
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,870
back to you
and you see yourself

20
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:26,880
and you see yourself
 

21
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,450
and you see yourself
from the photon that went around the

22
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:29,460
from the photon that went around the
 

23
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,189
from the photon that went around the
back of the black hole

24
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:31,199
back of the black hole
 

25
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,470
back of the black hole
but not only can that happen

26
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:33,480
but not only can that happen
 

27
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,650
but not only can that happen
the black hole the photon can swing

28
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:36,660
the black hole the photon can swing
 

29
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,930
the black hole the photon can swing
around twice

30
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:38,940
around twice
 

31
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,330
around twice
and come back so you actually see an

32
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:41,340
and come back so you actually see an
 

33
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,369
and come back so you actually see an
infinite number of copies

34
00:00:43,369 --> 00:00:43,379
infinite number of copies
 

35
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:46,610
infinite number of copies
of yourself

00:01:22,969 --> 00:01:22,979
philosophers so let me ask the big
 

67
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:25,310
philosophers so let me ask the big
question what is a black hole from a

68
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:25,320
question what is a black hole from a
 

69
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,429
question what is a black hole from a
theoretical from an experimental uh

70
00:01:28,429 --> 00:01:28,439
theoretical from an experimental uh
 

71
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:29,929
theoretical from an experimental uh
maybe even from a philosophical

72
00:01:29,929 --> 00:01:29,939
maybe even from a philosophical
 

73
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:34,310
maybe even from a philosophical
perspective so a black hole is defined

74
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:34,320
perspective so a black hole is defined
 

75
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,870
perspective so a black hole is defined
theoretically

76
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:35,880
theoretically
 

77
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,170
theoretically
as a region of space-time

78
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:39,180
as a region of space-time
 

79
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,130
as a region of space-time
from which light can never Escape

80
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:42,140
from which light can never Escape
 

81
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,810
from which light can never Escape
therefore it's black

82
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:44,820
therefore it's black
 

83
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,350
therefore it's black
now that's just the starting point many

84
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:48,360
now that's just the starting point many
 

85
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,010
now that's just the starting point many
weird things uh follow from that basic

86
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:52,020
weird things uh follow from that basic
 

87
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,590
weird things uh follow from that basic
definition but that is

88
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:54,600
definition but that is
 

89
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,050
definition but that is
that is the basic definition what is

90
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:57,060
that is the basic definition what is
 

91
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,130
that is the basic definition what is
light

92
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:58,140
light
 

93
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,590
light
they can't escape from a black hole well

94
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:00,600
they can't escape from a black hole well
 

95
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,929
they can't escape from a black hole well
light is uh you know the stuff that

96
00:02:02,929 --> 00:02:02,939
light is uh you know the stuff that
 

97
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:04,789
light is uh you know the stuff that
comes out of the Sun that stuff that

98
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:04,799
comes out of the Sun that stuff that
 

99
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,490
comes out of the Sun that stuff that
goes into your eyes

100
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:06,500
goes into your eyes
 

101
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,229
goes into your eyes
light is one of the the stuff that

102
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:09,239
light is one of the the stuff that
 

103
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:11,750
light is one of the the stuff that
disappears when the lights go off this

104
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:11,760
disappears when the lights go off this
 

105
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,490
disappears when the lights go off this
is stuff that appears when the lights

106
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:13,500
is stuff that appears when the lights
 

107
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,229
is stuff that appears when the lights
come on

108
00:02:15,229 --> 00:02:15,239
come on
 

109
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:17,030
come on
um of course that could give you a Beth

110
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,040
um of course that could give you a Beth
 

111
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,610
um of course that could give you a Beth
a medical definition but or physical

112
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:19,620
a medical definition but or physical
 

113
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,430
a medical definition but or physical
mathematical definition but I think it's

114
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:22,440
mathematical definition but I think it's
 

115
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,790
mathematical definition but I think it's
something that we uh will understand

116
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:25,800
something that we uh will understand
 

117
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,970
something that we uh will understand
very intuitively

118
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:27,980
very intuitively
 

119
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,949
very intuitively
what is light black holes on the other

120
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:30,959
what is light black holes on the other
 

121
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,290
what is light black holes on the other
hand we don't understand intuitively

122
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:33,300
hand we don't understand intuitively
 

123
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,850
hand we don't understand intuitively
they're very weird

124
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:34,860
they're very weird
 

125
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,589
they're very weird
and

126
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:36,599
and
 

127
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:39,350
and
one of the questions is about black

128
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:39,360
one of the questions is about black
 

129
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,250
one of the questions is about black
holes which I think you were alluding to

130
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:42,260
holes which I think you were alluding to
 

131
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:47,210
holes which I think you were alluding to
is you know why doesn't light get out or

132
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:47,220
is you know why doesn't light get out or
 

133
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,309
is you know why doesn't light get out or
how is it that there can be a region of

134
00:02:49,309 --> 00:02:49,319
how is it that there can be a region of
 

135
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:51,170
how is it that there can be a region of
space-time

136
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:51,180
space-time
 

137
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,530
space-time
from which light can't escape

138
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:54,540
from which light can't escape
 

139
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,949
from which light can't escape
it definitely happens we've seen those

140
00:02:57,949 --> 00:02:57,959
it definitely happens we've seen those
 

141
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:00,670
it definitely happens we've seen those
regions we have spectacular pictures

142
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:00,680
regions we have spectacular pictures
 

143
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,250
regions we have spectacular pictures
especially in the last several years of

144
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:04,260
especially in the last several years of
 

145
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,350
especially in the last several years of
those regions

146
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:06,360
those regions
 

147
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,970
those regions
um they're there

148
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:07,980
um they're there
 

149
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,910
um they're there
in fact they're up in the sky thousands

150
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:10,920
in fact they're up in the sky thousands
 

151
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,130
in fact they're up in the sky thousands
or millions of them

152
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:13,140
or millions of them
 

153
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,309
or millions of them
we don't yet know how many

154
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:16,319
we don't yet know how many
 

155
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,390
we don't yet know how many
um but the proper explanation

156
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:20,400
um but the proper explanation
 

157
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,550
um but the proper explanation
of why light doesn't escape from

158
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:25,560
of why light doesn't escape from
 

159
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,050
of why light doesn't escape from
uh

160

uh
 

161
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:32,270
uh
a black hole is still a matter of some

162
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:32,280
a black hole is still a matter of some
 

163
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,410
a black hole is still a matter of some

debate
 

165
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,009

00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:38,640
one explanation
 

171
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,830
one explanation
which perhaps Einstein might have given

172
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:42,840
which perhaps Einstein might have given
 

173
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,530
which perhaps Einstein might have given
is that light carries energy

174
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:47,540
is that light carries energy
 

175
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:50,809
is that light carries energy
you know it carries energy because

176
00:03:50,809 --> 00:03:50,819
you know it carries energy because
 

177
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:53,750
you know it carries energy because
you know we have uh photo cells and we

178
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:53,760
you know we have uh photo cells and we
 

179
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,430
you know we have uh photo cells and we
can take the light from the sun and

180
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:55,440
can take the light from the sun and
 

181
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,490
can take the light from the sun and
collect it turn it into electricity so

182
00:03:58,490 --> 00:03:58,500
collect it turn it into electricity so
 

183
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,890
collect it turn it into electricity so
there's energy in light

184
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:00,900
there's energy in light
 

185
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,830
there's energy in light
and anything that carries energy is

186
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:03,840
and anything that carries energy is
 

187
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,410
and anything that carries energy is
subject to a gravitational pull

188
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:06,420
subject to a gravitational pull
 

189
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,690
subject to a gravitational pull
gravity will pull at anything with

190
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:08,700
gravity will pull at anything with
 

191
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,089
gravity will pull at anything with
energy

192
00:04:11,089 --> 00:04:11,099

 

193
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:12,890

now it turns out that the gravital

194
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:12,900
now it turns out that the gravital
 

195
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,229
now it turns out that the gravital
gravitational pull

196
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:15,239
gravitational pull
 

197
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:17,569
gravitational pull
exerted by an object

198
00:04:17,569 --> 00:04:17,579
exerted by an object
 

199
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,830
exerted by an object
uh is proportional to its mass

200
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:21,840
uh is proportional to its mass
 

201
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,129
uh is proportional to its mass
and so if you get enough Mass

202
00:04:25,129 --> 00:04:25,139
and so if you get enough Mass
 

203
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,570
and so if you get enough Mass
in

204
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:26,580
in
 

205
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,870
in
a small enough region

206
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:29,880
a small enough region
 

207
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,310
a small enough region
um

208
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:31,320
um
 

209
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,870
um
you you can prevent light from escaping

210
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:35,880
you you can prevent light from escaping
 

211
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,249
you you can prevent light from escaping
and let me flesh that out a little more

212
00:04:40,249 --> 00:04:40,259
and let me flesh that out a little more
 

213
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:42,350
and let me flesh that out a little more
um if you're

214
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:42,360
um if you're
 

215
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,770
um if you're
on the Earth

216
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:44,780
on the Earth
 

217
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,990
on the Earth
and you're on a rocket ship leaving this

218
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,000
and you're on a rocket ship leaving this
 

219
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,689
and you're on a rocket ship leaving this
the surface of the Earth and if we

220
00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:50,699
the surface of the Earth and if we
 

221
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:54,650
the surface of the Earth and if we
ignore the friction from the air

222
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:54,660
ignore the friction from the air
 

223
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,890
ignore the friction from the air
um if your rocket accelerates up to 11

224
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:57,900
um if your rocket accelerates up to 11
 

225
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,689
um if your rocket accelerates up to 11
kilometers per second

226
00:04:59,689 --> 00:04:59,699
kilometers per second
 

227
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,850
kilometers per second
that's escape velocity

228
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:01,860
that's escape velocity
 

229
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,550
that's escape velocity
and it can if there were no friction it

230
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:04,560
and it can if there were no friction it
 

231
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,950
and it can if there were no friction it
could just continue forever to the next

232
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:06,960
could just continue forever to the next
 

233
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,629
could just continue forever to the next

on the moon which has less Mass it's

236
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:11,820
on the moon which has less Mass it's
 

237
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:16,490
on the moon which has less Mass it's
only seven kilometers per second

238
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:16,500

 

239
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,710

so but going in the other direction if

240
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:18,720
so but going in the other direction if
 

241
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,090
so but going in the other direction if
you have

242
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:20,100
you have
 

243
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,330
you have
enough mass in one place the escape

244
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:23,340
enough mass in one place the escape
 

245
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,189
enough mass in one place the escape
Velocity

00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:25,199
Velocity
 

247
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,450
Velocity
can become the speed of light

248
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:29,460
can become the speed of light
 

249
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,150
can become the speed of light
if you shine light straight up away from

00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:32,160
if you shine light straight up away from
 

251
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,650
if you shine light straight up away from
the earth it doesn't have too much

00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:33,660
the earth it doesn't have too much
 

253
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,450
the earth it doesn't have too much
trouble it's going way above the escape

00:05:38,749 --> 00:05:38,759
and
 

259
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,029
and
um but if you have enough Mass there

260
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:41,039
um but if you have enough Mass there
 

261
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,090
um but if you have enough Mass there
even light can't escape the escape

262
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:44,100
even light can't escape the escape
 

263
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,189
even light can't escape the escape
Velocity and according to

264
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:48,199
Velocity and according to
 

265
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:52,070
Velocity and according to
Einstein's theory of relativity there is

266
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,080
Einstein's theory of relativity there is
 

267
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,969
Einstein's theory of relativity there is
an absolute speed limit in the universe

268
00:05:55,969 --> 00:05:55,979
an absolute speed limit in the universe
 

269
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:57,830
an absolute speed limit in the universe
the speed of light

270
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:57,840
the speed of light
 

271
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,330
the speed of light
and nothing

272
00:05:59,330 --> 00:05:59,340
and nothing
 

273
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,670
and nothing
makes any sense nothing could be

274
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:01,680
makes any sense nothing could be
 

275
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,189
makes any sense nothing could be
self-consistent if there are objects

276
00:06:04,189 --> 00:06:04,199
self-consistent if there are objects
 

277
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,570
self-consistent if there are objects
that could exceed

278
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:05,580
that could exceed
 

279
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,969
that could exceed
light speed

280
00:06:07,969 --> 00:06:07,979
light speed
 

281
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:11,870
light speed
and so uh in these very very massive

282
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:11,880
and so uh in these very very massive
 

283
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,350
and so uh in these very very massive
regions of space-time even light cannot

284
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:15,360
regions of space-time even light cannot
 

285
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,270
regions of space-time even light cannot
escape and the interesting thing is

286
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:17,280
escape and the interesting thing is
 

287
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,450
escape and the interesting thing is
Einstein himself didn't think that uh

288
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:20,460
Einstein himself didn't think that uh
 

289
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,390
Einstein himself didn't think that uh
these uh objects would call the black

290
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:23,400
these uh objects would call the black
 

291
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,550
these uh objects would call the black
holes could exist but let me actually

00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,010
seem completely obvious in retrospect
yeah

338
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:19,020
yeah
 

339
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,830
yeah
even my own discoveries which of course

340
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:21,840
even my own discoveries which of course
 

341
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,890
even my own discoveries which of course
are far lesser than Einsteins but many

342
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:24,900
are far lesser than Einsteins but many
 

343
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,990
are far lesser than Einsteins but many
of my papers many of my collaborators

344
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:27,000
of my papers many of my collaborators
 

345
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,110
of my papers many of my collaborators
get a little confused we'll try to

346
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:30,120
get a little confused we'll try to
 

347
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,370
get a little confused we'll try to
understand something we said we've got

348
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:31,380
understand something we said we've got
 

349
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,930
understand something we said we've got
to solve this problem we'll get all

350
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:32,940
to solve this problem we'll get all
 

351
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,150
to solve this problem we'll get all
confused finally we'll solve it we'll

352
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:35,160
confused finally we'll solve it we'll
 

353
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,770
confused finally we'll solve it we'll
get it all together

354
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:36,780
get it all together
 

355
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,150
get it all together
and

356
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:38,160
and
 

357
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,110
and
um

358
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:39,120
um
 

359
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,430
um
then we'll

360
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:40,440
then we'll
 

361
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,870
then we'll
all of a sudden everything will fall

362
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:41,880
all of a sudden everything will fall
 

363
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,570
all of a sudden everything will fall
into place we'll explain it and then

364
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:44,580
into place we'll explain it and then
 

365
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,089
into place we'll explain it and then
we'll look back at our discussions for

366
00:07:47,089 --> 00:07:47,099
we'll look back at our discussions for
 

367
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:50,330
we'll look back at our discussions for
the precedings of months and literally

368
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:50,340
the precedings of months and literally
 

369
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,749
the precedings of months and literally
be unable to reconstruct

370
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:53,759
be unable to reconstruct
 

371
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,629
be unable to reconstruct
how confused we were yeah and how we

372
00:07:56,629 --> 00:07:56,639
how confused we were yeah and how we
 

373
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,089
how confused we were yeah and how we
could ever have thought of it any other

374
00:07:59,089 --> 00:07:59,099
could ever have thought of it any other
 

375
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:00,070
could ever have thought of it any other
way

376
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,080
way
 

377
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,670
way
so not only can I not fathom

378
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:04,680
so not only can I not fathom
 

379
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,550
so not only can I not fathom
how confused

380
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:07,560
how confused
 

381
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,350
how confused
Einstein was

382
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:09,360
Einstein was
 

383
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,409
Einstein was
before he when you know when he started

384
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:12,419
before he when you know when he started
 

385
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:15,370
before he when you know when he started
thinking about the issues I can't even

386
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:15,380
thinking about the issues I can't even
 

387
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,529
thinking about the issues I can't even
reconstruct my own confusion from from

388
00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:18,539
reconstruct my own confusion from from
 

389
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:22,249
reconstruct my own confusion from from
two weeks ago uh you know so the really

390
00:08:22,249 --> 00:08:22,259
two weeks ago uh you know so the really
 

391
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:24,529
two weeks ago uh you know so the really
beautiful ideas that physics have this

392
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:24,539
beautiful ideas that physics have this
 

393
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:27,290
beautiful ideas that physics have this
very hard to get yourself back into the

394
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:27,300
very hard to get yourself back into the
 

395
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,550
very hard to get yourself back into the
mindset of course Einstein was confused

396
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:31,560
mindset of course Einstein was confused
 

397
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,290
mindset of course Einstein was confused
about many many things

398
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:36,300

 

399
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,149

doesn't matter if you're a physicist

400
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:38,159
doesn't matter if you're a physicist
 

401
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,769
doesn't matter if you're a physicist
it's not how many things you got wrong

402
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:39,779
it's not how many things you got wrong
 

403
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:42,409
it's not how many things you got wrong
it's not the ratio of how many you got

404
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:42,419
it's not the ratio of how many you got
 

405
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:45,050
it's not the ratio of how many you got
wrong coming you got right it's the

406
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:45,060
wrong coming you got right it's the
 

407
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,269
wrong coming you got right it's the
number that you got right

408
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:47,279
number that you got right
 

409
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,509
number that you got right
so Einstein didn't believe black holes

410
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:50,519
so Einstein didn't believe black holes
 

411
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:53,210
so Einstein didn't believe black holes
existed even though he predicted them

412
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:53,220
existed even though he predicted them
 

413
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,490
existed even though he predicted them
and I went and I read that paper which

414
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:55,500
and I went and I read that paper which
 

415
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,590
and I went and I read that paper which
he wrote you know Einstein wrote down

416
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:57,600
he wrote you know Einstein wrote down
 

417
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,070
he wrote you know Einstein wrote down
his field equations and

418
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:00,080
his field equations and
 

419
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,670
his field equations and
1915 and short Shield solved them and

420
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:04,680
1915 and short Shield solved them and
 

421
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,970
1915 and short Shield solved them and
discovered the black hole solution

422
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:06,980
discovered the black hole solution
 

423
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,769
discovered the black hole solution
three or four months later in very early

424
00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:09,779
three or four months later in very early
 

425
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:11,810
three or four months later in very early
1916

426
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:11,820
1916
 

427
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:16,910
1916
and um 25 years later Einstein wrote a

428
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:16,920
and um 25 years later Einstein wrote a
 

429
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,250
and um 25 years later Einstein wrote a
paper so with 25 years to think about

430
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:19,260
paper so with 25 years to think about
 

431
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,250
paper so with 25 years to think about
what this solution means yeah wrote a

432
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:22,260
what this solution means yeah wrote a
 

433
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,910
what this solution means yeah wrote a
paper in which he said that black holes

434
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:24,920
paper in which he said that black holes
 

435
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,430
paper in which he said that black holes
didn't exist

436
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:28,440

 

437
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,310

and I I'm like whoa

438
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:31,320
and I I'm like whoa
 

439
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,070
and I I'm like whoa
you know if one of my students in my

440
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,080
you know if one of my students in my
 

441
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,889
you know if one of my students in my
general relativity course wrote this

442
00:09:36,889 --> 00:09:36,899
general relativity course wrote this
 

443
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:39,350
general relativity course wrote this
you know I wouldn't pass them you get I

444
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:39,360
you know I wouldn't pass them you get I
 

445
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,550
you know I wouldn't pass them you get I
get to see mine oh you wouldn't pass

446
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:40,560
get to see mine oh you wouldn't pass
 

447
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,230
get to see mine oh you wouldn't pass
them okay all right good to see minus

448
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:42,240
them okay all right good to see minus
 

449
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,509
them okay all right good to see minus
okay same thing with gravity waves you

450
00:09:44,509 --> 00:09:44,519
okay same thing with gravity waves you
 

451
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:45,650
okay same thing with gravity waves you
didn't believe oh he didn't believe in

452
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:45,660
didn't believe oh he didn't believe in
 

453
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,269
didn't believe oh he didn't believe in
gravitational waves either he went back

454
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:47,279
gravitational waves either he went back
 

455
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,190
gravitational waves either he went back
and forth but he wrote a paper and I

456
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:49,200
and forth but he wrote a paper and I
 

457
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,070
and forth but he wrote a paper and I
think 34 saying that gravity waves

458
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:52,080
think 34 saying that gravity waves
 

459
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,710
think 34 saying that gravity waves
didn't exist because it people were very

460
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:54,720
didn't exist because it people were very
 

461
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,150
didn't exist because it people were very
confused about what a coordinate

462
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:56,160
confused about what a coordinate
 

463
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,730
confused about what a coordinate
transformation is and in fact this

464
00:09:58,730 --> 00:09:58,740
transformation is and in fact this
 

465
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,350
transformation is and in fact this
confusion about what a coordinate

466
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:00,360
confusion about what a coordinate
 

467
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,790
confusion about what a coordinate
transformation

468
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:01,800
transformation
 

469
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,850
transformation
is has persisted

470
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:04,860
is has persisted
 

471
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,650
is has persisted
and we actually think

472
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:08,660
and we actually think
 

473
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,509
and we actually think
we were on the

474
00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:11,519
we were on the
 

475
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,329
we were on the
edge of solving it

476
00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:14,339
edge of solving it
 

477
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:16,670
edge of solving it
a hundred years later

478
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:16,680
a hundred years later
 

479
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,250
a hundred years later
well what a hundred years later what is

480
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:19,260
well what a hundred years later what is
 

481
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,590
well what a hundred years later what is
coordinate transformation as it was a

482
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:21,600
coordinate transformation as it was a
 

483
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,570
coordinate transformation as it was a
hundred years ago to today let's imagine

484
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:23,580
hundred years ago to today let's imagine
 

485
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:29,210
hundred years ago to today let's imagine
I want to draw a map with pictures of

486
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:29,220
I want to draw a map with pictures of
 

487
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,889
I want to draw a map with pictures of
all the states and the mountains and

488
00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:30,899
all the states and the mountains and
 

489
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:34,490
all the states and the mountains and
then I want to draw the weather forecast

490
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:34,500
then I want to draw the weather forecast
 

491
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,290
then I want to draw the weather forecast
what the temperatures are going to be

492
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:36,300
what the temperatures are going to be
 

493
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,550
what the temperatures are going to be
all over the country

494
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:39,560
all over the country
 

495
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,730
all over the country
and I do that using one set of weather

496
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:43,740
and I do that using one set of weather
 

497
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,170
and I do that using one set of weather
stations

498
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:45,180
stations
 

499
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,870
stations
and I number the weather stations

500
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:47,880
and I number the weather stations
 

501
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,449
and I number the weather stations
and you have some other set of

502
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:50,459
and you have some other set of
 

503
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:52,310
and you have some other set of
weather stations

504
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:52,320
weather stations
 

505
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,630
weather stations
and you

506
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:53,640
and you
 

507
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,269
and you
you do the same thing so the coordinates

508
00:10:56,269 --> 00:10:56,279
you do the same thing so the coordinates
 

509
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:57,650
you do the same thing so the coordinates
are the locations of the weather

510
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:57,660
are the locations of the weather
 

511
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,050
are the locations of the weather
stations yeah they're how we describe

512
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:00,060
stations yeah they're how we describe
 

513
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,610
stations yeah they're how we describe
where the things are

514
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:01,620
where the things are
 

515
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,889
where the things are
at the end of the day

516
00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:03,899
at the end of the day
 

517
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:06,170
at the end of the day
we should draw the same

518
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:06,180
we should draw the same
 

519
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,490
we should draw the same
map

520
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:07,500
map
 

521
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,009
map
that is coordinate invariance

522
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:10,019
that is coordinate invariance
 

523
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:13,490
that is coordinate invariance
and if we're telling somebody uh we're

524
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:13,500
and if we're telling somebody uh we're
 

525
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,290
and if we're telling somebody uh we're
going to tell somebody at a real

526
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:15,300
going to tell somebody at a real
 

527
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,750
going to tell somebody at a real
physical operation we want you to stay

528
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:17,760
physical operation we want you to stay
 

529
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,910
physical operation we want you to stay
as dry as possible on your drive from

530
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:19,920
as dry as possible on your drive from
 

531
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,670
as dry as possible on your drive from
here to California

532
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:21,680
here to California
 

533
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,170
here to California
we should give them exactly the same

534
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:24,180
we should give them exactly the same
 

535
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,910
we should give them exactly the same
route

536
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:25,920
route
 

537
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,009
route
no matter which weather stations we use

538
00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:28,019
no matter which weather stations we use
 

539
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:30,829
no matter which weather stations we use
or how we you know it's a very trivial

540
00:11:30,829 --> 00:11:30,839
or how we you know it's a very trivial
 

541
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:34,130
or how we you know it's a very trivial
it's it's the labeling of points is an

542
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:34,140
it's it's the labeling of points is an
 

543
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,650
it's it's the labeling of points is an
artifact and not in the real physics

544
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:36,660
artifact and not in the real physics
 

545
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,750
artifact and not in the real physics
sure

546
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:38,760
sure
 

547
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,569
sure
so it turns out that that's

548
00:11:41,569 --> 00:11:41,579
so it turns out that that's
 

549
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:44,150
so it turns out that that's
almost true

550
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,160
almost true
 

551
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,449
almost true
but but not quite there's some

552
00:11:47,449 --> 00:11:47,459
but but not quite there's some
 

553
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:49,250
but but not quite there's some
subtleties to it

554
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:49,260
subtleties to it
 

555
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,810
subtleties to it
the statement that you should always

556
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:50,820
the statement that you should always
 

557
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,090
the statement that you should always
have the same give it this the same kind

558
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:53,100
have the same give it this the same kind
 

559
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,769
have the same give it this the same kind
of trajectory the same kind of uh

560
00:11:54,769 --> 00:11:54,779
of trajectory the same kind of uh
 

561
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:56,810
of trajectory the same kind of uh
instructions no matter the weather

562
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:56,820
instructions no matter the weather
 

563
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,110
instructions no matter the weather
station yeah yeah there's some very

564
00:11:59,110 --> 00:11:59,120
station yeah yeah there's some very
 

565
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,790
station yeah yeah there's some very
delicate subtleties to that which

566
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:03,800
delicate subtleties to that which
 

567
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:08,569
delicate subtleties to that which
begin to be noticed in the in the 50s

568
00:12:08,569 --> 00:12:08,579
begin to be noticed in the in the 50s
 

569
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:13,130
begin to be noticed in the in the 50s
it's mostly true but when you have a

570
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:13,140
it's mostly true but when you have a
 

571
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,310
it's mostly true but when you have a
space-time with edges

572
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:16,320
space-time with edges
 

573
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,530
space-time with edges
it gets very tricky how you label the

574
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:18,540
it gets very tricky how you label the
 

575
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,630
it gets very tricky how you label the
edges and space-time in terms of spacer

576
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:20,640
edges and space-time in terms of spacer
 

577
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,949
edges and space-time in terms of spacer
in terms of time in terms of everything

578
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:21,959
in terms of time in terms of everything
 

579
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:24,050
in terms of time in terms of everything
just based on either one okay space or

580
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:24,060
just based on either one okay space or
 

581
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,569
just based on either one okay space or
time that gets very tricky and Einstein

582
00:12:26,569 --> 00:12:26,579
time that gets very tricky and Einstein
 

583
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,769
time that gets very tricky and Einstein
uh didn't

584
00:12:29,769 --> 00:12:29,779
uh didn't
 

585
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:32,870
uh didn't
didn't didn't have it right and in fact

586
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:32,880
didn't didn't have it right and in fact
 

587
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,509
didn't didn't have it right and in fact
he had an earlier version of general

588
00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:35,519
he had an earlier version of general
 

589
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,910
he had an earlier version of general
relativity

590
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:37,920
relativity
 

591
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:43,850
relativity
in 1914 which he was very excited about

592
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:43,860

 

593
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,470

um which was

594
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:45,480
um which was
 

595
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,750
um which was
wrong

596
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:47,760
wrong
 

597
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,210
wrong
um gave it wasn't fully coordinate and

598
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:50,220
um gave it wasn't fully coordinate and
 

599
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,590
um gave it wasn't fully coordinate and
variant it was only partially

600
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:51,600
variant it was only partially
 

601
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,129
variant it was only partially
coordinated variant it was wrong

602
00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:55,139
coordinated variant it was wrong
 

603
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:57,290
coordinated variant it was wrong
it gave the wrong answer for bending

604
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:57,300
it gave the wrong answer for bending
 

605
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,150
it gave the wrong answer for bending
light to the Sun

606
00:12:59,150 --> 00:12:59,160
light to the Sun
 

607
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,129
light to the Sun
by a factor of two

608
00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:01,139
by a factor of two
 

609
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:03,170
by a factor of two
there was an expedition

610
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:03,180
there was an expedition
 

611
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,750
there was an expedition
sent out to measure it during World War

612
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:05,760
sent out to measure it during World War
 

613
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,650
sent out to measure it during World War
One

614
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:06,660
One
 

615
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,750
One
they were captured

616
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:08,760
they were captured
 

617
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,530
they were captured
before they could measure it and that

618
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:12,540
before they could measure it and that
 

619
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,690
before they could measure it and that
came that came Einstein four more years

620
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:14,700
came that came Einstein four more years
 

621
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,050
came that came Einstein four more years
to clean it to clean his act act up by

622
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:18,060
to clean it to clean his act act up by
 

623
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,449
to clean it to clean his act act up by
which time he had gotten it right

624
00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:20,459
which time he had gotten it right
 

625
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:22,490
which time he had gotten it right
so it's a very it's a very tricky

626
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:22,500
so it's a very it's a very tricky
 

627
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,310
so it's a very it's a very tricky
business but once it's all laid out it

628
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:25,320
business but once it's all laid out it
 

629
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,470
business but once it's all laid out it
saves uh

630
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:27,480
saves uh
 

631
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,110
saves uh
it's it's it's clear then what do you

632
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:30,120
it's it's it's clear then what do you
 

633
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,509
it's it's it's clear then what do you
think Einstein

634
00:13:32,509 --> 00:13:32,519
think Einstein
 

635
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:35,629
think Einstein
didn't uh believe his own equations and

636
00:13:35,629 --> 00:13:35,639
didn't uh believe his own equations and
 

637
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:36,949
didn't uh believe his own equations and
didn't think that black holes are real

638
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:36,959
didn't think that black holes are real
 

639
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,930
didn't think that black holes are real
well why was that such a difficult idea

640
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:38,940
well why was that such a difficult idea
 

641
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,650
well why was that such a difficult idea
for him well something very interesting

642
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:42,660
for him well something very interesting
 

643
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,170
for him well something very interesting
happens in

644
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:45,180
happens in
 

645
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,269
happens in
short Shield solution of the Einstein

646
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:47,279
short Shield solution of the Einstein
 

647
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:52,129
short Shield solution of the Einstein
equation

648
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:52,139

 

649
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:54,350

I think his reasoning was ultimately

650
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:54,360
I think his reasoning was ultimately
 

651
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,629
I think his reasoning was ultimately
wrong but let me

652
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:56,639
wrong but let me
 

653
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,090
wrong but let me
explain to you uh

654
00:13:59,090 --> 00:13:59,100
explain to you uh
 

655
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,910
explain to you uh
what it was

656
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:01,920
what it was
 

657
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,530
what it was
um

658
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:03,540
um
 

659
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,870
um

00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,829
see and live to tell about it
as a center of the black hole there's a

668
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:15,839
as a center of the black hole there's a
 

669
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,350
as a center of the black hole there's a
singularity and if you pass the Horizon

670
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:18,360
singularity and if you pass the Horizon
 

671
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,629
singularity and if you pass the Horizon
you go into the singularity you get

672
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:20,639
you go into the singularity you get
 

673
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,769
you go into the singularity you get
crushed and that's the end of everything

674
00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:24,779
crushed and that's the end of everything
 

675
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:28,990
crushed and that's the end of everything
now the word singularity

676
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:29,000
now the word singularity
 

677
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,790
now the word singularity
means that

678
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:31,800
means that
 

679
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,569
means that
um

680
00:14:32,569 --> 00:14:32,579
um
 

681
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:36,069
um
it just means that Einstein's equations

682
00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:36,079
it just means that Einstein's equations
 

683
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,629
it just means that Einstein's equations
break down

684
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:38,639
break down
 

685
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,509
break down
they become infinite you write them down

686
00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:41,519
they become infinite you write them down
 

687
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,670
they become infinite you write them down
you put them on the computer when the

688
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:43,680
you put them on the computer when the
 

689
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,949
you put them on the computer when the
computer hits that Singularity it

690
00:14:45,949 --> 00:14:45,959
computer hits that Singularity it
 

691
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:47,210
computer hits that Singularity it
crashes

692
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:47,220
crashes
 

693
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,629
crashes
everything becomes infinite there's two

694
00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:50,639
everything becomes infinite there's two
 

695
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,230
everything becomes infinite there's two
so the questions are just no good there

696
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:54,240
so the questions are just no good there
 

697
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,030
so the questions are just no good there
now

698
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:56,040
now
 

699
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,090
now
that's actually

700
00:14:59,090 --> 00:14:59,100
that's actually
 

701
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,150
that's actually
not a bad thing it's a really good thing

702
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:02,160
not a bad thing it's a really good thing
 

703
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,629
not a bad thing it's a really good thing
and let me explain why

704
00:15:05,629 --> 00:15:05,639
and let me explain why
 

705
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:06,290
and let me explain why
um

706
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:06,300
um
 

707
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,350
um
so

708
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:09,360

 

709
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,050

it's an odd thing

710
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:12,060
it's an odd thing
 

711
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,750
it's an odd thing
that Maxwell's Theory

712
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:14,760
that Maxwell's Theory
 

713
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,269
that Maxwell's Theory
and Newton's Theory

714
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:17,279
and Newton's Theory
 

715
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,710
and Newton's Theory
never

716
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:18,720
never
 

717
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,530
never
exhibit this phenomena you write them

718
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:21,540
exhibit this phenomena you write them
 

719
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,870
exhibit this phenomena you write them
down you can solve them exactly they're

720
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:23,880
down you can solve them exactly they're
 

721
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,310
down you can solve them exactly they're
really Newton's theory of gravity

722
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:25,320
really Newton's theory of gravity
 

723
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,550
really Newton's theory of gravity
they're really very simple theories you

724
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:28,560
they're really very simple theories you
 

725
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,350
they're really very simple theories you
can solve them well you can't solve the

726
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:30,360
can solve them well you can't solve the
 

727
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,629
can solve them well you can't solve the
three body problem but

728
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:32,639
three body problem but
 

729
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:33,530
three body problem but
um

730
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:33,540
um
 

731
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,930
um
you can certainly solve a lot of things

732
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:35,940
you can certainly solve a lot of things
 

733
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,629
you can certainly solve a lot of things
about them

734
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:38,639

 

735
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,329

nevertheless

736
00:15:41,329 --> 00:15:41,339
nevertheless
 

737
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:46,069
nevertheless
there was never any reason

738
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:46,079

 

739
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,930

even though Maxwell and Newton perhaps

740
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:50,940
even though Maxwell and Newton perhaps
 

741
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,410
even though Maxwell and Newton perhaps
fell for this trap there were never any

742
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:54,420
fell for this trap there were never any
 

743
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,889
fell for this trap there were never any
reason to think that these equations

744
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:56,899
reason to think that these equations
 

745
00:15:56,899 --> 00:16:01,189
reason to think that these equations
were exact

746
00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:01,199

 

747
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,990

um and

748
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:03,000
um and
 

749
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,050
um and
every there's no equation

750
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:06,060
every there's no equation
 

751
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,550
every there's no equation
well

752
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:07,560
well
 

753
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,230
well
there's some equations that we've

754
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:09,240
there's some equations that we've
 

755
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,509
there's some equations that we've
written down that we still think are

756
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:11,519
written down that we still think are
 

757
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,250
written down that we still think are
exact

758
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:13,260
exact
 

759
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,889
exact
some people still think are exact my

760
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:15,899
some people still think are exact my
 

761
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:17,750
some people still think are exact my
view is that there's no exact equation

762
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:17,760
view is that there's no exact equation
 

763
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,189
view is that there's no exact equation
everything is an approximation

764
00:16:19,189 --> 00:16:19,199
everything is an approximation
 

765
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,050
everything is an approximation
everything is an approximation are you

766
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:21,060
everything is an approximation are you
 

767
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,449
everything is an approximation are you
trying to get as close as possible yeah

768
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:23,459
trying to get as close as possible yeah
 

769
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:25,009
trying to get as close as possible yeah
so you think are you saying objective

770
00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:25,019
so you think are you saying objective
 

771
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:29,170
so you think are you saying objective
truth doesn't exist in this world

772
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:29,180

 

773
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,430

we could discuss that but that's a

774
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:31,440
we could discuss that but that's a
 

775
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,829
we could discuss that but that's a
different that's a different thing

776
00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:33,839
different that's a different thing
 

777
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,629
different that's a different thing
um we wouldn't say Newton's theory was

778
00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:35,639
um we wouldn't say Newton's theory was
 

779
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:36,769
um we wouldn't say Newton's theory was
wrong

780
00:16:36,769 --> 00:16:36,779
wrong
 

781
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:40,310
wrong
it had very very small Corrections Inc

782
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:40,320
it had very very small Corrections Inc
 

783
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,470
it had very very small Corrections Inc
incomplete small Corrections it's

784
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:42,480
incomplete small Corrections it's
 

785
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,290
incomplete small Corrections it's
actually a puzzle why they're so small

786
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:45,300
actually a puzzle why they're so small
 

787
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,150
actually a puzzle why they're so small
so if you watch the procession of

788
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:47,160
so if you watch the procession of
 

789
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,129
so if you watch the procession of
Mercury's perihelia this was the first

790
00:16:49,129 --> 00:16:49,139
Mercury's perihelia this was the first
 

791
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:50,629
Mercury's perihelia this was the first
indication

792
00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:50,639
indication
 

793
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,930
indication
of something going wrong according to

794
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:53,940
of something going wrong according to
 

795
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,210
of something going wrong according to
Newton's Theory mercury has an

796
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:56,220
Newton's Theory mercury has an
 

797
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,710
Newton's Theory mercury has an
elliptical orbit

798
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:57,720
elliptical orbit
 

799
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:02,269
elliptical orbit
the long part of it moves around

800
00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:02,279
the long part of it moves around
 

801
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:05,929
the long part of it moves around
as other planets come by and perturb it

802
00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:05,939
as other planets come by and perturb it
 

803
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:08,809
as other planets come by and perturb it
and so on and so this was measured by

804
00:17:08,809 --> 00:17:08,819
and so on and so this was measured by
 

805
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:13,309
and so on and so this was measured by
leveria in 1859 and he compared

806
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:13,319
leveria in 1859 and he compared
 

807
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:16,250
leveria in 1859 and he compared
Theory and experiment and he found out

808
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:16,260
Theory and experiment and he found out
 

809
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,730
Theory and experiment and he found out
that the perihelion process moves around

810
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:19,740
that the perihelion process moves around
 

811
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,590
that the perihelion process moves around
the Sun

812
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:21,600
the Sun
 

813
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,329
the Sun
once every

814
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:25,339

 

815
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:29,090

233 centuries instead of every 231

816
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:29,100
233 centuries instead of every 231
 

817
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,830
233 centuries instead of every 231
centuries

818
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:30,840
centuries
 

819
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,510
centuries
okay now this is the wonderful thing

820
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:32,520
okay now this is the wonderful thing
 

821
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,130
okay now this is the wonderful thing
about science

822
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:34,140
about science
 

823
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,590
about science
why was this guy

824
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:36,600
why was this guy
 

825
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,990
why was this guy
are we didn't get any idea how much work

826
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:39,000
are we didn't get any idea how much work
 

827
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,789
are we didn't get any idea how much work
this is you know

828
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:40,799
this is you know
 

829
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,710
this is you know
but of course he made one of the

830
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:42,720
but of course he made one of the
 

831
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,930
but of course he made one of the
greatest discoveries of the history of

832
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:44,940
greatest discoveries of the history of
 

833
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,690
greatest discoveries of the history of
science without you know even knowing

834
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:47,700
science without you know even knowing
 

835
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:52,970
science without you know even knowing
what it what good it was going to be

836
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:52,980

 

837
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,430

so that's how small that that was the

838
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:55,440
so that's how small that that was the
 

839
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,630
so that's how small that that was the
first sign that there was something

840
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:56,640
first sign that there was something
 

841
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,810
first sign that there was something
wrong with Newton yeah

842
00:17:59,810 --> 00:17:59,820
wrong with Newton yeah
 

843
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,630
wrong with Newton yeah
nah so the corrections to Newton's law

844
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:02,640
nah so the corrections to Newton's law
 

845
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,430
nah so the corrections to Newton's law
are very very small but they're

846
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:04,440
are very very small but they're
 

847
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,049
are very very small but they're
definitely there

848
00:18:06,049 --> 00:18:06,059
definitely there
 

849
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:09,529
definitely there
the corrections to electromagnetism

850
00:18:09,529 --> 00:18:09,539
the corrections to electromagnetism
 

851
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:12,169
the corrections to electromagnetism
they're mostly the ones that we see are

852
00:18:12,169 --> 00:18:12,179
they're mostly the ones that we see are
 

853
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:16,010
they're mostly the ones that we see are
mostly coming from Quantum effects

854
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:16,020
mostly coming from Quantum effects
 

855
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:19,730
mostly coming from Quantum effects
and so so the corrections there for uh

856
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:19,740
and so so the corrections there for uh
 

857
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:23,029
and so so the corrections there for uh
Maxwell's equations is when you get

858
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:23,039
Maxwell's equations is when you get
 

859
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,950
Maxwell's equations is when you get
super tiny and then the corrections for

860
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:24,960
super tiny and then the corrections for
 

861
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,690
super tiny and then the corrections for
the

862
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:26,700
the
 

863
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,830
the
um for Newton's uh laws gravity is when

864
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:30,840
um for Newton's uh laws gravity is when
 

865
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,390
um for Newton's uh laws gravity is when
you get super big

866
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:32,400
you get super big
 

867
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,190
you get super big
that though that's when you acquire

868
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:34,200
that though that's when you acquire
 

869
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,110
that though that's when you acquire
Corrections that's true but I would

870
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:36,120
Corrections that's true but I would
 

871
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,549
Corrections that's true but I would
phrase it as saying when it's super

872
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:37,559
phrase it as saying when it's super
 

873
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:39,890
phrase it as saying when it's super
accurate you know if you look at the

874
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:39,900
accurate you know if you look at the
 

875
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,330
accurate you know if you look at the
Bohr atom

876
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:41,340
Bohr atom
 

877
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,330

Maxwell electromagnetism is not a very

878
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:44,340
Maxwell electromagnetism is not a very
 

879
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,789
Maxwell electromagnetism is not a very
good approximation

880
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:45,799
good approximation
 

881
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:49,549
good approximation
to the force between the proton and the

882
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:49,559
to the force between the proton and the
 

883
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:52,430
to the force between the proton and the
electron the quantum mechanics

884
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:52,440
electron the quantum mechanics
 

885
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,190
electron the quantum mechanics
if you if you if you didn't have quantum

886
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:55,200
if you if you if you didn't have quantum
 

887
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,590
if you if you if you didn't have quantum
mechanics the electron would would

888
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:57,600
mechanics the electron would would
 

889
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,130
mechanics the electron would would
spiral into the proton and the atom

890
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:01,140
spiral into the proton and the atom
 

891
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,750
spiral into the proton and the atom
would collapse it's Quantum you know so

892
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:02,760
would collapse it's Quantum you know so
 

893
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,970
would collapse it's Quantum you know so
that's a huge correction there sure

894
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:04,980
that's a huge correction there sure
 

895
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,610
that's a huge correction there sure
so every Theory gets corrected as we

896
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:07,620
so every Theory gets corrected as we
 

897
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,169
so every Theory gets corrected as we
learn more

898
00:19:09,169 --> 00:19:09,179

00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:15,299
it should be otherwise well how is this
 

903
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:16,850
it should be otherwise well how is this
really to the singularity why the

really to the singularity why the
 

905
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,370
really to the singularity why the
singular so when you hit the singularity

00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:19,380
singular so when you hit the singularity
 

907
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:23,890

00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:23,900
you know that you need some

00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:44,700
um
 

927
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,789
um
we don't understand exactly what the

928
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:46,799
we don't understand exactly what the
 

929
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,310
we don't understand exactly what the
theory is but we know there's no reason

930
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:49,320
theory is but we know there's no reason
 

931
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,430
theory is but we know there's no reason
to think you know Einstein's theory was

00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:52,440
to think you know Einstein's theory was

00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,210
weekly curves things the solar system
and so on it it's incredibly robust that

938
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:02,220
and so on it it's incredibly robust that
 

939
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,870
and so on it it's incredibly robust that
we now see that it works very well near

00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:05,880
we now see that it works very well near
 

941
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,870
we now see that it works very well near
the horizons of around black holes and

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,610
the horizons of around black holes and
so on so

944
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:10,620
so on so
 

945
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,250
so on so
so it's a good thing

946
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:13,260
so it's a good thing
 

947
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,250
so it's a good thing
that the theory drives itself

948
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:16,260
that the theory drives itself

that the theory drives itself
that it predicts its own demise

00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:27,900
something like this so why is that uh
 

1003
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,870
something like this so why is that uh
why is that interesting to you in that

1004
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:29,880
why is that interesting to you in that
 

1005
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,490
why is that interesting to you in that
same way that there's contradictions

1006
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:31,500
same way that there's contradictions
 

1007
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,350
same way that there's contradictions
that create Discovery there's no

1008
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:33,360
that create Discovery there's no
 

1009
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,870
that create Discovery there's no
question in my mind of course many

1010
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:35,880
question in my mind of course many
 

1011
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,870
question in my mind of course many
people would disagree with me that now

1012
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:38,880
people would disagree with me that now
 

1013
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,049
people would disagree with me that now
is the most

1014
00:21:42,049 --> 00:21:42,059
is the most
 

1015
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:45,890
is the most
wonderful time to be a physicist so so

1016
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:45,900
wonderful time to be a physicist so so
 

1017
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:50,330
wonderful time to be a physicist so so
people people look back at at um

1018
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:50,340
people people look back at at um
 

1019
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:53,210
people people look back at at um
it's a classical thing to say

1020
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:53,220
it's a classical thing to say
 

1021
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:58,549
it's a classical thing to say
among physicists uh I wish it were 1920.

1022
00:21:58,549 --> 00:21:58,559
among physicists uh I wish it were 1920.
 

1023
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,669
among physicists uh I wish it were 1920.
right quantum mechanics had been just

1024
00:22:01,669 --> 00:22:01,679
right quantum mechanics had been just
 

1025
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:02,830
right quantum mechanics had been just
understood

1026
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:02,840
understood
 

1027
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,110
understood
uh there was the periodic table

1028
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:06,120
uh there was the periodic table
 

1029
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:09,230
uh there was the periodic table
there was but in fact that was such a

1030
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:09,240
there was but in fact that was such a
 

1031
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,049
there was but in fact that was such a
rich thing

1032
00:22:12,049 --> 00:22:12,059

 

1033
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:13,610

um that

1034
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:13,620
um that
 

1035
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,529
um that
uh

1036
00:22:15,529 --> 00:22:15,539
uh
 

1037
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:18,350
uh
well so that what a lot of exciting

1038
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:18,360
well so that what a lot of exciting
 

1039
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,049
well so that what a lot of exciting
stuff happened around 1920. it took it

took the whole it took a whole century
 

1043
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,710
took the whole it took a whole century

that kind of stuff yeah yeah yeah it was
 

1057
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,010
that kind of stuff yeah yeah yeah it was
a whole sort of Wonderful

1058

they they don't seem to you know they
would just we understood something wrong

1140
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:32,640
would just we understood something wrong
 

1141
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,250
would just we understood something wrong
we made a mistake we set up our

1142
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:34,260
we made a mistake we set up our
 

1143
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,930
we made a mistake we set up our
equations in the wrong way we didn't

1144
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:35,940
equations in the wrong way we didn't
 

1145
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,210
equations in the wrong way we didn't
translate the formalisms as opposed to

1146
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:38,220
translate the formalisms as opposed to
 

1147
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,830
translate the formalisms as opposed to
revealing some deep mystery that's yet

1148
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:39,840
revealing some deep mystery that's yet
 

1149
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,990
revealing some deep mystery that's yet
to be uncovered yeah yeah and so we

1150
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:42,000
to be uncovered yeah yeah and so we
 

1151
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,570
to be uncovered yeah yeah and so we
never we're never very sure which are

1152
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:44,580
never we're never very sure which are
 

1153
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,149
never we're never very sure which are
which are the really important ones

1154
00:24:47,149 --> 00:24:47,159
which are the really important ones
 

1155
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:48,590
which are the really important ones
but to you the difference between

1156
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:48,600
but to you the difference between
 

1157
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,710
but to you the difference between
quantum mechanics and general relativity

1158
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:50,720
quantum mechanics and general relativity
 

1159
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,270

seem the the tension the contradiction
 

1161
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,610

00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:57,240
deeper thing that's going to be
 

1165
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,330
deeper thing that's going to be
discovered in the century yes because

1166
00:24:59,330 --> 00:24:59,340
discovered in the century yes because
 

1167
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:02,750
discovered in the century yes because
that one has been understood since the

1168
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:02,760
that one has been understood since the
 

1169
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,090
that one has been understood since the
50s poly was the

1170
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:05,100
50s poly was the
 

1171
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:10,310
50s poly was the
uh first person to notice it and Hawking

1172
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:10,320
uh first person to notice it and Hawking
 

1173
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,649
uh first person to notice it and Hawking
in the early 70s gave it a really much

1174
00:25:12,649 --> 00:25:12,659
in the early 70s gave it a really much
 

1175
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:16,010
in the early 70s gave it a really much
more visceral form

1176
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:16,020
more visceral form
 

1177
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:20,230
more visceral form
um and people have been

1178
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:20,240
um and people have been
 

1179
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,730
um and people have been
hurling themselves at it trying to

1180
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:22,740
hurling themselves at it trying to
 

1181
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:25,669
hurling themselves at it trying to
reduce it to some technicality but

1182
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:25,679
reduce it to some technicality but
 

1183
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,750
reduce it to some technicality but
nobody has succeeded and the efforts to

1184
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:29,760
nobody has succeeded and the efforts to
 

1185
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,169
nobody has succeeded and the efforts to
understand it have led to

1186
00:25:32,169 --> 00:25:32,179
understand it have led to
 

1187
00:25:32,179 --> 00:25:35,510
understand it have led to
uh all kinds of interesting relations

1188
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:35,520
uh all kinds of interesting relations
 

1189
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,310
uh all kinds of interesting relations
between Quantum systems and and

1190
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:39,320
between Quantum systems and and
 

1191
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,169
between Quantum systems and and
applications to other fields and and so

1192
00:25:42,169 --> 00:25:42,179
applications to other fields and and so
 

1193
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:44,570
applications to other fields and and so
on well let's actually jump around so

1194
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:44,580
on well let's actually jump around so
 

1195
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,070
on well let's actually jump around so
we'll return to black holes I have a

1196
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:46,080
we'll return to black holes I have a
 

1197
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,810
we'll return to black holes I have a
million questions there but let's let's

1198
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:47,820
million questions there but let's let's
 

1199
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,810
million questions there but let's let's
go into this unification

1200
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:50,820
go into this unification
 

1201
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,210
go into this unification
uh the battle against the contradictions

1202
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:53,220
uh the battle against the contradictions
 

1203
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,950
uh the battle against the contradictions
and the tensions between the theories of

1204
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:54,960
and the tensions between the theories of
 

1205
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,370
and the tensions between the theories of
physics what is quantum gravity maybe

1206
00:25:58,370 --> 00:25:58,380
physics what is quantum gravity maybe
 

1207
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,769
physics what is quantum gravity maybe
what is the standard model of physics

1208
00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:00,779
what is the standard model of physics
 

1209
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:02,330
what is the standard model of physics
what is quantum mechanics what is

1210
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:02,340
what is quantum mechanics what is
 

1211
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,130
what is quantum mechanics what is
general relativity what's quantum

1212
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:04,140
general relativity what's quantum
 

1213
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,029
general relativity what's quantum
gravity

1214
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:05,039
gravity
 

1215
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,470
gravity
uh what are all the different

1216
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:06,480
uh what are all the different
 

1217
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,250
uh what are all the different
unification efforts

1218
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:10,260

 

1219
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:13,909

okay so again five questions yeah

1220
00:26:13,909 --> 00:26:13,919
okay so again five questions yeah
 

1221
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,510
okay so again five questions yeah
it's a theory that describes

1222
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:17,520
it's a theory that describes
 

1223
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,250
it's a theory that describes
everything with astonishing accuracy

Theory and experiment have been
 

1233
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,970
Theory and experiment have been
successfully compared to 16 decimal

we have that stenciled on the door where

1238
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:39,960
we have that stenciled on the door where
 

1239
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,010
we have that stenciled on the door where
where I work you know it's a it's an

00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:43,020
where I work you know it's a it's an

human mind

1244
00:26:47,769 --> 00:26:47,779
human mind
 

1245
00:26:47,779 --> 00:26:50,570
human mind
it describes

1246
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:50,580
it describes
 

1247
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,110
it describes
um the electromagnetic interaction

1248
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:53,120
um the electromagnetic interaction
 

1249
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,490
um the electromagnetic interaction
unifies the electromagnetic interaction

1250
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:55,500
unifies the electromagnetic interaction
 

1251
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,950
unifies the electromagnetic interaction
with the so-called weak interaction

1252
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:57,960
with the so-called weak interaction
 

1253
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,149
with the so-called weak interaction
which

1254
00:26:59,149 --> 00:26:59,159
which
 

1255
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:02,390
which
you need some good tools to even view

1256
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:02,400
you need some good tools to even view
 

1257
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,669
you need some good tools to even view
the weak interaction and then there's

1258
00:27:04,669 --> 00:27:04,679
the weak interaction and then there's
 

1259
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:07,149
the weak interaction and then there's
the strong interaction

1260
00:27:07,149 --> 00:27:07,159
the strong interaction
 

1261
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:11,710
the strong interaction
which binds the quarks into protons

1262
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:11,720
which binds the quarks into protons
 

1263
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:16,010
which binds the quarks into protons
and the forces between them are mediated

1264
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:16,020
and the forces between them are mediated
 

1265
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,890
and the forces between them are mediated
by something called Yang Mills Theory

1266
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:18,900
by something called Yang Mills Theory
 

1267
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:23,529
by something called Yang Mills Theory
which is a a beautiful mathematical

1268
00:27:23,529 --> 00:27:23,539
which is a a beautiful mathematical
 

1269
00:27:23,539 --> 00:27:27,590
which is a a beautiful mathematical
generalization of electromagnetism

1270
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:27,600
generalization of electromagnetism
 

1271
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:32,570
generalization of electromagnetism
in which the analogs of the photons

1272
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:32,580
in which the analogs of the photons
 

1273
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:35,810
in which the analogs of the photons
and themselves carry charge

1274
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:35,820
and themselves carry charge
 

1275
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,430
and themselves carry charge
and

1276
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:37,440
and
 

1277
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,350
and
um so this uh the final piece of this

1278
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:42,360
um so this uh the final piece of this
 

1279
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,450
um so this uh the final piece of this
of the standard model everything in the

1280
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:44,460
of the standard model everything in the
 

1281
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,090
of the standard model everything in the
standard model has been observed and its

1282
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:47,100
standard model has been observed and its
 

1283
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,610
standard model has been observed and its
properties have been measured the final

1284
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:49,620
properties have been measured the final
 

1285
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,070
properties have been measured the final
particle to be observed was the Higgs

1286
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:52,080
particle to be observed was the Higgs
 

1287
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,450

00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,510
particle
served like a over a decade ago the

1290
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:56,520
served like a over a decade ago the
 

1291
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,730
served like a over a decade ago the
Higgs is already a decade ago I I think

1292
00:27:58,730 --> 00:27:58,740
Higgs is already a decade ago I I think
 

1293
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:01,669
Higgs is already a decade ago I I think
it is yeah wow time flies but you better

1294
00:28:01,669 --> 00:28:01,679
it is yeah wow time flies but you better
 

1295
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,850
it is yeah wow time flies but you better
check me on that yeah it's it's true but

1296
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:04,860
check me on that yeah it's it's true but
 

1297
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,890
check me on that yeah it's it's true but
so much fun has been happening it's so

1298
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:06,900
so much fun has been happening it's so
 

1299
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,830
so much fun has been happening it's so
much fun it's been happening and so

1300
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:09,840
much fun it's been happening and so
 

1301
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,450
much fun it's been happening and so
that's all

1302
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:11,460
that's all
 

1303
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,549
that's all
um

1304
00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:12,559
um
 

1305
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:15,730
um
that's that's all pretty well understood

1306
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:15,740
that's that's all pretty well understood
 

1307
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:19,850
that's that's all pretty well understood
there's some things that miter might not

1308
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:19,860
there's some things that miter might not
 

1309
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,669
there's some things that miter might not
around the edges of that you know Dark

anything very new
 

1327
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,450
anything very new
conceptually

1328
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:47,460
conceptually
 

1329
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,149
conceptually
in the completion of that anything

1330
00:28:50,149 --> 00:28:50,159
in the completion of that anything
 

1331
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,850
in the completion of that anything
contradictory but I'm new because can't

1332
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:52,860
contradictory but I'm new because can't
 

1333
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,769
contradictory but I'm new because can't
you think contradictory yeah I'll have

1334
00:28:54,769 --> 00:28:54,779
you think contradictory yeah I'll have
 

1335
00:28:54,779 --> 00:28:57,590
you think contradictory yeah I'll have
some wild questions uh for you on that

1336
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:57,600
some wild questions uh for you on that
 

1337
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,450
some wild questions uh for you on that
front but yeah anything that yeah

1338
00:28:59,450 --> 00:28:59,460
front but yeah anything that yeah
 

1339
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,970
front but yeah anything that yeah
because there's no gaps it's so accurate

1340
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:01,980
because there's no gaps it's so accurate
 

1341
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,710
because there's no gaps it's so accurate
so precise it's predictions it's hard to

1342
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:03,720
so precise it's predictions it's hard to
 

1343
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,070
so precise it's predictions it's hard to
imagine something yeah yeah yeah and

1344
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:07,080
imagine something yeah yeah yeah and
 

1345
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,909
imagine something yeah yeah yeah and
it was all based on something called let

1346
00:29:10,909 --> 00:29:10,919
it was all based on something called let
 

1347
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:12,409
it was all based on something called let
me not explain what it is let me just

1348
00:29:12,409 --> 00:29:12,419
me not explain what it is let me just
 

1349
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:14,289
me not explain what it is let me just
throw out the buzzword

1350
00:29:14,289 --> 00:29:14,299
throw out the buzzword
 

1351
00:29:14,299 --> 00:29:17,090
throw out the buzzword
renormalizable quantum field Theory they

00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:17,100
renormalizable quantum field Theory they
 

1353
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:20,269
renormalizable quantum field Theory they
all fall in the category of

00:29:20,269 --> 00:29:20,279
all fall in the category of
 

1355
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:23,090
all fall in the category of

renormalizable quantum field Theory I'm
 

1357
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,889
renormalizable quantum field Theory I'm
going to throw that at a bar later to

1358
00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:24,899
going to throw that at a bar later to
 

1359
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:25,970
going to throw that at a bar later to
impress

1360
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:25,980
impress
 

1361
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,970

impress the girls
 

1363
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:32,350
impress the girls
good luck thank you

1364
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:32,360

 

1365
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,630

all right so uh they all they all fall

1366
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:35,640
all right so uh they all they all fall
 

1367
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,049
all right so uh they all they all fall
under that rubric gravity will not will

1368
00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:39,059
under that rubric gravity will not will
 

1369
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:42,230
under that rubric gravity will not will
not will not put that suit on

1370
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:42,240
not will not put that suit on
 

1371
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,870
not will not put that suit on
so the force of gravity

1372
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:44,880
so the force of gravity
 

1373
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,070
so the force of gravity
Cannot Be Tamed by the same

in my view some people would disagree

00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:24,970
in my view some people would disagree
with me

with me
 

1445
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:29,210
with me
but there isn't a reasonable uh

00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:29,220
but there isn't a reasonable uh
 

1447
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,250
but there isn't a reasonable uh
possibility that we would be able to do

possibility that we would be able to do
 

1449
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:34,029
possibility that we would be able to do
an experiment in the foreseeable future

an experiment in the foreseeable future
 

1451

which would be sort of a yes or no
to to string theory okay so you've been

1454
00:31:41,269 --> 00:31:41,279
to to string theory okay so you've been
 

1455
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:42,590
to to string theory okay so you've been
there from the early days of string

1456
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:42,600
there from the early days of string
 

1457
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,389
there from the early days of string
theory you've seen his developments what

1458
00:31:44,389 --> 00:31:44,399
theory you've seen his developments what
 

1459
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,430
theory you've seen his developments what
are some interesting developments uh

1460
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:46,440
are some interesting developments uh
 

1461
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,930
are some interesting developments uh
what do you see as the also the future

1462
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:47,940
what do you see as the also the future
 

1463
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,549
what do you see as the also the future
of string theory

1464
00:31:49,549 --> 00:31:49,559
of string theory
 

1465
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:53,210
of string theory
and what is string theory

1466
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:53,220

 

1467
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:57,830

well the basic idea which emerged in

1468
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:57,840
well the basic idea which emerged in
 

1469
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,990
well the basic idea which emerged in
the early 70s

1470
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:00,000
the early 70s
 

1471
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,570
the early 70s
was that if you uh

1472
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:05,580

 

1473
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,070

you take

1474
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:07,080
you take
 

1475
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:10,850
you take
uh the notion of a particle and you

1476
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:10,860
uh the notion of a particle and you
 

1477
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,830
uh the notion of a particle and you
literally

1478
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:12,840
literally
 

1479
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,909
literally
replace it by a little Loop of string

1480
00:32:16,909 --> 00:32:16,919
replace it by a little Loop of string
 

1481
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:20,090
replace it by a little Loop of string
that strings are sort of softer

1482
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:20,100
that strings are sort of softer
 

1483
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,149
that strings are sort of softer
than than particles what do you mean by

1484
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:23,159
than than particles what do you mean by
 

1485
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:24,590
than than particles what do you mean by
softer

1486
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:24,600
softer
 

1487
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,370
softer
well you know if you hit a particle

1488
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:28,380
well you know if you hit a particle
 

1489
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,710
well you know if you hit a particle
if there were particle on this table a

1490

if there were particle on this table a
 

1491
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,269
if there were particle on this table a
big one and you hit it you might bruise

1492
00:32:32,269 --> 00:32:32,279
big one and you hit it you might bruise

yourself sure

yourself sure
 

1495
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,510
yourself sure
but if there was a string on the table

1496
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:35,520
but if there was a string on the table
 

1497
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,149
but if there was a string on the table
you would probably just push it around

1498
00:32:38,149 --> 00:32:38,159
you would probably just push it around
 

1499
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:40,730
you would probably just push it around

00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:53,520
a jarring effect and and uh
 

1511
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,370
a jarring effect and and uh
I've never described it this way before

1512
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:55,380
I've never described it this way before
 

1513
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,810
I've never described it this way before
but it's actually scientifically

1514
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:56,820
but it's actually scientifically
 

1515
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:59,029
but it's actually scientifically
accurate but if you throw strings at

1516
00:32:59,029 --> 00:32:59,039
accurate but if you throw strings at
 

1517
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,470
accurate but if you throw strings at
each other it's a little more friendly

one thing I can't explain is how

one thing I can't explain is how
 

1521
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:07,909
one thing I can't explain is how

wonderfully precise will the mathematics
 

1523
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,430
wonderfully precise will the mathematics
is that goes into describing String

1539
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,870

00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:49,190
if you go to the bar and I already got
the renormalizable quantity and you look

00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:49,200
the renormalizable quantity and you look
 

1603
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,770
the renormalizable quantity and you look
in the mirror across the bar yes the

1604
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:51,780
in the mirror across the bar yes the
 

1605
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:54,409
in the mirror across the bar yes the
universe that you see in the mirror is

1606
00:34:54,409 --> 00:34:54,419
universe that you see in the mirror is
 

1607

00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:05,220
the lady in the bar the photograph that
 

1615
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,430
the lady in the bar the photograph that
shows both the mirror and you there's a

00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:07,440
shows both the mirror and you there's a
 

1617
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,290
shows both the mirror and you there's a
difference if she's smart enough she'll

1618
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:09,300
difference if she's smart enough she'll
 

1619
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:12,470
difference if she's smart enough she'll
be able to to tell which one is the real

00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:12,480
be able to to tell which one is the real
 

1621
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,109
be able to to tell which one is the real
world and which one is you now she would

00:35:15,109 --> 00:35:15,119
world and which one is you now she would
 

1623
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,730
world and which one is you now she would
have to do some very precise

00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:16,740
have to do some very precise
 

1625
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,210
have to do some very precise

and if the photograph was too grainy it
 

1629
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,870

as possible why is this interesting why
 

1633
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:28,970
as possible why is this interesting why
is it does this mean that there is some

1634
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:28,980
is it does this mean that there is some
 

1635
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:31,490
is it does this mean that there is some
um not perfect determinism or uh what

1636
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:31,500
um not perfect determinism or uh what
 

1637
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,750
um not perfect determinism or uh what
does that mean there's some uncertainty

1638
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:32,760
does that mean there's some uncertainty
 

1639
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,089
does that mean there's some uncertainty
no it's a very interesting feature of

1640
00:35:35,089 --> 00:35:35,099
no it's a very interesting feature of
 

1641
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:36,290
no it's a very interesting feature of
the real world

1642
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:36,300
the real world
 

1643
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,410
the real world
that it isn't parody of invariant and

00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:41,820
string theory it was thought could not
 

1647
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,530
string theory it was thought could not
tolerate that

1648
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:44,540
tolerate that
 

1649
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:48,349
tolerate that
and um then it was learned in the mid

1650
00:35:48,349 --> 00:35:48,359
and um then it was learned in the mid
 

1651
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:51,109
and um then it was learned in the mid

right always I mean Einstein didn't
 

1705
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,810
right always I mean Einstein didn't

the black hole okay well that money was
 

1709
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:04,930
the black hole okay well that money was
wrong about that but

1710
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:04,940
wrong about that but
 

1711
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:08,710
wrong about that but
but you might be wrong too right uh so

1712
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:08,720
but you might be wrong too right uh so
 

1713
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,089
but you might be wrong too right uh so
do you think string theory is dead if

00:37:11,089 --> 00:37:11,099
do you think string theory is dead if
 

1715
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:13,550
do you think string theory is dead if
you were to bet all your money on

00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:13,560
you were to bet all your money on

00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,650
you were to bet all your money on
um no the future of strength I think

um no the future of strength I think
 

1719
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,630
um no the future of strength I think
it's a

it's a

00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,670
it's a
a logical error

1722
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:19,680
a logical error
 

1723
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,910
a logical error
to think that string theory is either

1724
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:22,920
to think that string theory is either
 

1725
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,109
to think that string theory is either
right or wrong or dead or alive

right or wrong or dead or alive
 

1727
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:31,250
right or wrong or dead or alive
what it is is a stepping stone

what it is is a stepping stone

he was missing some pieces and you
 

1783
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,550

everything I mean technically you would
have to say it was wrong

1794
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:51,060
have to say it was wrong
 

1795
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,550
have to say it was wrong
and technically you would have to say

Yang and Mills were wrong and I guess in

Yang and Mills were wrong and I guess in

that sense
 

1801
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:59,630
that sense
I would believe just

1811
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,730
strings Theory and technically what we
call String Theory Now isn't quite right

1812

call String Theory Now isn't quite right
 

1813

00:39:13,609 --> 00:39:13,619
but we're always going to be wrong but
 

1815
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:15,470
but we're always going to be wrong but
hopefully a little bit less wrong every

1816
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:15,480
hopefully a little bit less wrong every
 

1817
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,950
hopefully a little bit less wrong every
time except exactly and I I would you

1818
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:18,960
time except exactly and I I would you
 

1819
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,109
time except exactly and I I would you
know bet the farm as they say do you

1820
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:21,119
know bet the farm as they say do you
 

1821
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,270
know bet the farm as they say do you
have a farm

1822
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:22,280
have a farm
 

1823
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,770
have a farm
you know I say that much more seriously

1824
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:24,780
you know I say that much more seriously
 

1825
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,690
you know I say that much more seriously
because not only do I have a farm but we

1826
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:26,700
because not only do I have a farm but we
 

1827
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,050
because not only do I have a farm but we
just renovated it

1828
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:29,060
just renovated it
 

1829
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:32,510
just renovated it
simply before I read it so before I

1830
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:32,520
simply before I read it so before I
 

1831
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,609
simply before I read it so before I
renovated better get the far my wife I

1832
00:39:34,609 --> 00:39:34,619
renovated better get the far my wife I
 

1833
00:39:34,619 --> 00:39:37,190
renovated better get the far my wife I
spent five years renovating it before I

1834
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:37,200
spent five years renovating it before I
 

1835
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,170
spent five years renovating it before I
you were much much looser with that

1836
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:39,180
you were much much looser with that
 

1837
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,609
you were much much looser with that
statement but now I really means

1838
00:39:40,609 --> 00:39:40,619
statement but now I really means
 

1839
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:42,349
statement but now I really means
something no no it really means

1840
00:39:42,349 --> 00:39:42,359
something no no it really means
 

1841
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:45,829
something no no it really means
something and and I would bet the farm

1842
00:39:45,829 --> 00:39:45,839
something and and I would bet the farm
 

1843
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:49,569
something and and I would bet the farm
on the um

1844
00:39:49,569 --> 00:39:49,579

 

1845
00:39:49,579 --> 00:39:54,370

on the uh guess that 100 years from now

1846
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:54,380
on the uh guess that 100 years from now
 

1847
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:58,069
on the uh guess that 100 years from now
String Theory will be viewed as a

1848
00:39:58,069 --> 00:39:58,079
String Theory will be viewed as a
 

1849
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:59,810
String Theory will be viewed as a
stepping stone towards a greater

1850
00:39:59,810 --> 00:39:59,820
stepping stone towards a greater
 

1851
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:02,810
stepping stone towards a greater
understanding of of nature

1852
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:02,820
understanding of of nature
 

1853
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:05,750
understanding of of nature
and and it would I mean another thing

1854
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:05,760
and and it would I mean another thing
 

1855
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,609
and and it would I mean another thing
that I didn't mention about strings

1856
00:40:07,609 --> 00:40:07,619
that I didn't mention about strings
 

1857
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:10,870
that I didn't mention about strings
theory is of course we knew that it

1858
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:10,880
theory is of course we knew that it
 

1859
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,450
theory is of course we knew that it
solved the Infinities problem and then

1860
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:14,460
solved the Infinities problem and then
 

1861
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:17,349
solved the Infinities problem and then
we later learned that it also solved

1862
00:40:17,349 --> 00:40:17,359
we later learned that it also solved
 

1863
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:20,390
we later learned that it also solved
Hawking's puzzle about

1864
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:20,400
Hawking's puzzle about
 

1865
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,210
Hawking's puzzle about
what's inside of a black hole

1866
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:23,220
what's inside of a black hole
 

1867
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:27,290
what's inside of a black hole
and you put in one assumption you get

1868
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:27,300
and you put in one assumption you get
 

1869
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,870
and you put in one assumption you get
five things out you somehow you're doing

1870
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:29,880
five things out you somehow you're doing
 

1871
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,730
five things out you somehow you're doing
something right you know probably not

1872
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:31,740
something right you know probably not
 

1873
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:34,069
something right you know probably not
everything but you're you're you know

1874
00:40:34,069 --> 00:40:34,079
everything but you're you're you know
 

1875
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:36,050
everything but you're you're you know
there's some good signposts and there

1876
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:36,060
there's some good signposts and there
 

1877
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,849
there's some good signposts and there
have been a lot of good signposts like

1878
00:40:37,849 --> 00:40:37,859
have been a lot of good signposts like
 

1879
00:40:37,859 --> 00:40:38,750
have been a lot of good signposts like
that

1880
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:38,760
that
 

1881
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,270
that
it is also mathematical toolkit and you

1882
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:41,280
it is also mathematical toolkit and you
 

1883
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,950
it is also mathematical toolkit and you
you've used it you've used it with

1884
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:42,960
you've used it you've used it with
 

1885
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,250
you've used it you've used it with
comrade Waffa uh maybe we can sneak our

1886
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:46,260
comrade Waffa uh maybe we can sneak our
 

1887
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:48,050
comrade Waffa uh maybe we can sneak our
way back from String Theory into black

1888
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:48,060
way back from String Theory into black
 

1889
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,490
way back from String Theory into black
holes yeah

1890
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:49,500
holes yeah
 

1891
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,109
holes yeah
um what was the idea that you and

1892
00:40:51,109 --> 00:40:51,119
um what was the idea that you and
 

1893
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:52,970
um what was the idea that you and
Cameron valpha developed with the

1894
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:52,980
Cameron valpha developed with the
 

1895
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,890
Cameron valpha developed with the
holographic principle and string theory

1896
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:54,900
holographic principle and string theory
 

1897
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,870
holographic principle and string theory
were we able to discover through through

1898
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:56,880
were we able to discover through through
 

1899
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,569
were we able to discover through through
this through string theory about black

1900
00:40:59,569 --> 00:40:59,579
this through string theory about black
 

1901
00:40:59,579 --> 00:41:01,970
this through string theory about black
holes or um

1902
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:01,980
holes or um
 

1903
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:04,250
holes or um
that connects us back to the reality of

1904
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:04,260
that connects us back to the reality of
 

1905
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:07,190
that connects us back to the reality of
black holes yeah so that is a very

1906
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:07,200
black holes yeah so that is a very
 

1907
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,670
black holes yeah so that is a very
interesting story I was

1908
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:10,680
interesting story I was
 

1909
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,770
interesting story I was
interested in black holes before I was

1910
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:12,780
interested in black holes before I was
 

1911
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:16,069
interested in black holes before I was
interested in String Theory I was sort

1912
00:41:16,069 --> 00:41:16,079
interested in String Theory I was sort
 

1913
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:18,170
interested in String Theory I was sort
of a reluctance

1914
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:18,180
of a reluctance
 

1915
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,849
of a reluctance
strength there is in the beginning I

1916
00:41:19,849 --> 00:41:19,859
strength there is in the beginning I
 

1917
00:41:19,859 --> 00:41:21,890
strength there is in the beginning I
thought I had to learn it because people

1918
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:21,900
thought I had to learn it because people
 

1919
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,630
thought I had to learn it because people
were talking about it but you know once

1920
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:23,640
were talking about it but you know once
 

1921
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,630
were talking about it but you know once
I studied it I I grew to love it first I

1922
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:26,640
I studied it I I grew to love it first I
 

1923
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,730
I studied it I I grew to love it first I
did it in a sort of dutiful way these

1924
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:28,740
did it in a sort of dutiful way these
 

1925
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,170
did it in a sort of dutiful way these
people say they've claimed quantum

1926
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:30,180
people say they've claimed quantum
 

1927
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,910
people say they've claimed quantum
gravity I ought to read their papers at

1928
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:31,920
gravity I ought to read their papers at
 

1929
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:32,990
gravity I ought to read their papers at
least

1930
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:33,000
least
 

1931
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,630
least
and then the more I read them the more

1932
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:35,640
and then the more I read them the more
 

1933
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,030
and then the more I read them the more
interested I got and I began to see you

1934
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:38,040
interested I got and I began to see you
 

1935
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,170
interested I got and I began to see you
know they

1936
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:39,180
know they
 

1937
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:43,010
know they
they phrased it in a very clumsy way the

1938
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:43,020
they phrased it in a very clumsy way the
 

1939
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,750
they phrased it in a very clumsy way the
description of string theory was was

1940
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:44,760
description of string theory was was
 

1941
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,390
description of string theory was was
very clumsy and mathematically clumsy or

1942
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:47,400
very clumsy and mathematically clumsy or
 

1943
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,089
very clumsy and mathematically clumsy or
just mathematically yeah

1944
00:41:50,089 --> 00:41:50,099
just mathematically yeah
 

1945
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:52,430
just mathematically yeah
it was all correct but

1946
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:52,440
it was all correct but
 

1947
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,630
it was all correct but
but

1948
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:53,640
but
 

1949
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,750
but
mathematically clumsy but it often

1950
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:56,760
mathematically clumsy but it often
 

1951
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,730
mathematically clumsy but it often
happens

1952
00:41:58,730 --> 00:41:58,740
happens
 

1953
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:02,089
happens
that in all kinds of branches of physics

1954
00:42:02,089 --> 00:42:02,099
that in all kinds of branches of physics
 

1955
00:42:02,099 --> 00:42:04,310
that in all kinds of branches of physics
that

1956
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:04,320
that
 

1957
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,109
that
um people start working on it really

1958
00:42:06,109 --> 00:42:06,119
um people start working on it really
 

1959
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:09,050
um people start working on it really
hard and they sort of dream about it and

1960
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:09,060
hard and they sort of dream about it and
 

1961
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,910
hard and they sort of dream about it and
live it and breathe it and they begin to

1962
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:10,920
live it and breathe it and they begin to
 

1963
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,430
live it and breathe it and they begin to
see inner relationships and

1964
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:13,440
see inner relationships and
 

1965
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,250
see inner relationships and
they see a beauty that

1966
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:16,260
they see a beauty that
 

1967
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:18,170
they see a beauty that
is really there they're not they're not

1968
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:18,180
is really there they're not they're not
 

1969
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,030
is really there they're not they're not
deceived they're really seeing something

1970
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:20,040
deceived they're really seeing something
 

1971
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,030
deceived they're really seeing something
that exists but if you just kind of look

1972
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:23,040
that exists but if you just kind of look
 

1973
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,670
that exists but if you just kind of look
at it you know you can't you can't grasp

1974
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:25,680
at it you know you can't you can't grasp
 

1975
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:30,470
at it you know you can't you can't grasp
it all in the beginning and and um

1976
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:30,480
it all in the beginning and and um
 

1977
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,510
it all in the beginning and and um
so

1978
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:32,520
so
 

1979
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:37,069
so
our understanding of string theory in uh

1980
00:42:37,069 --> 00:42:37,079
our understanding of string theory in uh
 

1981
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:43,790
our understanding of string theory in uh
uh in 1985 was almost all about uh you

1982
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:43,800
uh in 1985 was almost all about uh you
 

1983
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,010
uh in 1985 was almost all about uh you
know

1984
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:45,020
know
 

1985
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:48,490
know
weekly coupled waves of strings

1986
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:48,500
weekly coupled waves of strings
 

1987
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,990
weekly coupled waves of strings
colliding and so on we didn't know how

1988
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:51,000
colliding and so on we didn't know how
 

1989
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,370
colliding and so on we didn't know how
to describe

1990
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:52,380
to describe
 

1991
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:55,609
to describe
a big thing like a black hole and so you

1992
00:42:55,609 --> 00:42:55,619
a big thing like a black hole and so you
 

1993
00:42:55,619 --> 00:42:57,290
a big thing like a black hole and so you
know in string theory of course we could

1994
00:42:57,290 --> 00:42:57,300
know in string theory of course we could
 

1995
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:00,410
know in string theory of course we could
show that strings in theory in some

1996
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:00,420
show that strings in theory in some
 

1997
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,510
show that strings in theory in some
limit reproduced Einstein's theory of

1998
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:02,520
limit reproduced Einstein's theory of
 

1999
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,250
limit reproduced Einstein's theory of
general relativity

2000
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:04,260
general relativity
 

2001
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:07,069
general relativity
and corrected it but we couldn't do any

2002
00:43:07,069 --> 00:43:07,079
and corrected it but we couldn't do any
 

2003
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:09,170
and corrected it but we couldn't do any
better with black holes

2004
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:09,180
better with black holes
 

2005
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,790
better with black holes
than

2006
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:10,800
than
 

2007
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,910
than
um

2008
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:12,920

 

2009
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,290

before my work with command we couldn't

2010
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:15,300
before my work with command we couldn't
 

2011
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,510
before my work with command we couldn't
do any better than Einstein and tortill

2012
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:17,520
do any better than Einstein and tortill
 

2013
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,490
do any better than Einstein and tortill
had done

2014
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:19,500
had done
 

2015
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,170
had done
now

2016
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:21,180
now
 

2017
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:24,650
now
um one of the puzzles

2018
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:24,660

 

2019
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:27,609

um you know if you look at the

2020
00:43:27,609 --> 00:43:27,619
um you know if you look at the
 

2021
00:43:27,619 --> 00:43:31,069
um you know if you look at the
Hawking's headstone and also Boltzmann's

2022
00:43:31,069 --> 00:43:31,079
Hawking's headstone and also Boltzmann's
 

2023
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:32,630
Hawking's headstone and also Boltzmann's
headstone and you

2024
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:32,640
headstone and you
 

2025
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:36,290
headstone and you
put them together you get a formula

2026
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:36,300
put them together you get a formula
 

2027
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:41,630
put them together you get a formula
for their really Central equations in

2028
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:41,640
for their really Central equations in
 

2029
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:44,990
for their really Central equations in
20th century physics I don't

2030
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:45,000
20th century physics I don't
 

2031
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,970
20th century physics I don't
think there are many equations that made

2032
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:46,980
think there are many equations that made
 

2033
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:50,710
think there are many equations that made
it to headstones

2034
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:50,720

 

2035
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,870

and and they're really Central equations

2036
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:53,880
and and they're really Central equations
 

2037
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,930
and and they're really Central equations
and you put them together and you get a

2038
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:56,940
and you put them together and you get a
 

2039
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:59,630
and you put them together and you get a
formula for the number of gigabytes in a

2040
00:43:59,630 --> 00:43:59,640
formula for the number of gigabytes in a
 

2041
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,970
formula for the number of gigabytes in a
black hole

2042
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:01,980
black hole
 

2043
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:06,349
black hole
now a short shelves description

2044
00:44:06,349 --> 00:44:06,359

 

2045
00:44:06,359 --> 00:44:08,630

the black hole is literally a hole in

2046
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:08,640
the black hole is literally a hole in
 

2047
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,490
the black hole is literally a hole in
space and there's no place to store the

2048
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:10,500
space and there's no place to store the
 

2049
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:13,849
space and there's no place to store the
gigabytes

2050
00:44:13,849 --> 00:44:13,859

 

2051
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:16,849

and it's not too hard to and this really

2052
00:44:16,849 --> 00:44:16,859
and it's not too hard to and this really
 

2053
00:44:16,859 --> 00:44:20,270
and it's not too hard to and this really
was wheeler and beckenstein and

2054
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:20,280
was wheeler and beckenstein and
 

2055
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,210
was wheeler and beckenstein and
wheeler beckenstein and Hawking

2056
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:23,220
wheeler beckenstein and Hawking
 

2057
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:27,349
wheeler beckenstein and Hawking
to come to the conclusion that

2058
00:44:27,349 --> 00:44:27,359
to come to the conclusion that
 

2059
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:30,650
to come to the conclusion that
if there isn't a sense in which a black

2060
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:30,660
if there isn't a sense in which a black
 

2061
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:32,450
if there isn't a sense in which a black
hole can store

2062
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:32,460
hole can store
 

2063
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:35,390
hole can store
some large number of gigabytes

2064
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:35,400
some large number of gigabytes
 

2065
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,870
some large number of gigabytes
that quantum mechanics and gravity can't

2066
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:38,880
that quantum mechanics and gravity can't
 

2067
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,730
that quantum mechanics and gravity can't
be consistent

2068
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:40,740
be consistent
 

2069
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,530
be consistent
we got we got to go there a little bit

2070
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:42,540
we got we got to go there a little bit
 

2071
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:45,770
we got we got to go there a little bit
so uh so how is it possible I won't say

2072
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:45,780
so uh so how is it possible I won't say
 

2073
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:47,270
so uh so how is it possible I won't say
gigabyte say there's some information so

2074
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:47,280
gigabyte say there's some information so
 

2075
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,950
gigabyte say there's some information so
black holes can store information how is

2076
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:48,960
black holes can store information how is
 

2077
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,930
black holes can store information how is
this thing that sucks up all light and

2078
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:50,940
this thing that sucks up all light and
 

2079
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,790
this thing that sucks up all light and
it's supposed to basically be you know

2080
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:52,800
it's supposed to basically be you know
 

2081
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,210
it's supposed to basically be you know
be super homogeneous and boring how is

2082
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:56,220
be super homogeneous and boring how is
 

2083
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:57,470
be super homogeneous and boring how is
that actually able to store information

2084
00:44:57,470 --> 00:44:57,480
that actually able to store information
 

2085
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,630
that actually able to store information
where does the store information on the

2086
00:44:59,630 --> 00:44:59,640
where does the store information on the
 

2087
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,670
where does the store information on the
inside on the surface

2088
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:01,680
inside on the surface
 

2089
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,550
inside on the surface
uh where where's yeah and what's

2090
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:04,560
uh where where's yeah and what's
 

2091
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,930
uh where where's yeah and what's
information

2092
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:05,940
information
 

2093
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:08,390
information
I'm liking this ask five questions to

2094
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:08,400
I'm liking this ask five questions to
 

2095
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,609
I'm liking this ask five questions to
see which one you actually answer oh

2096
00:45:10,609 --> 00:45:10,619
see which one you actually answer oh
 

2097
00:45:10,619 --> 00:45:12,290
see which one you actually answer oh
okay I'm going to ask you about that I

2098
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:12,300
okay I'm going to ask you about that I
 

2099
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:13,790
okay I'm going to ask you about that I
should try to memorize them and answer

2100
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:13,800
should try to memorize them and answer
 

2101
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,410
should try to memorize them and answer
each one in order just to answer them I

2102
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:15,420
each one in order just to answer them I
 

2103
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:16,609
each one in order just to answer them I
don't know I don't know what I'm doing

2104
00:45:16,609 --> 00:45:16,619
don't know I don't know what I'm doing
 

2105
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:19,730
don't know I don't know what I'm doing
I'm desperately desperately uh trying to

2106
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:19,740
I'm desperately desperately uh trying to
 

2107
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:22,250
I'm desperately desperately uh trying to
figure it out as I go along here so

2108
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:22,260
figure it out as I go along here so
 

2109
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:24,890
figure it out as I go along here so
um Einstein's Black Culture short sort

2110
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:24,900
um Einstein's Black Culture short sort
 

2111
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:25,910
um Einstein's Black Culture short sort
of black hole they can't store

2112
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:25,920
of black hole they can't store
 

2113
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:26,870
of black hole they can't store
information

2114
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:26,880
information
 

2115
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,450
information
this stuff stuff goes in there and it

2116
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:29,460
this stuff stuff goes in there and it
 

2117
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,490
this stuff stuff goes in there and it
just keeps flying and it goes to the

2118
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:31,500
just keeps flying and it goes to the
 

2119
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,309
just keeps flying and it goes to the
singularity and it's gone

2120
00:45:34,309 --> 00:45:34,319
singularity and it's gone
 

2121
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:35,510
singularity and it's gone
however

2122
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:35,520
however
 

2123
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,849
however
Einstein's theory is not exact

2124
00:45:37,849 --> 00:45:37,859
Einstein's theory is not exact
 

2125
00:45:37,859 --> 00:45:40,309
Einstein's theory is not exact
it has Corrections

2126
00:45:40,309 --> 00:45:40,319
it has Corrections
 

2127
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:43,190
it has Corrections
and string theory tells you what those

2128
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:43,200
and string theory tells you what those
 

2129
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,550
and string theory tells you what those
Corrections are

2130
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:46,560

 

2131
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,790

and so you should be able to find some

2132
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:49,800
and so you should be able to find some
 

2133
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:54,470
and so you should be able to find some
way of some alternate way of describing

2134
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:54,480
way of some alternate way of describing
 

2135
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:59,450
way of some alternate way of describing
the black hole that enables you

2136
00:45:59,450 --> 00:45:59,460

 

2137
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:02,150

00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,910
to understand
where the gigabytes are stored

2140
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:04,920
where the gigabytes are stored
 

2141
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,790
where the gigabytes are stored
so what Hawking and beckenstein really

2142
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:07,800
so what Hawking and beckenstein really
 

2143
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,849
so what Hawking and beckenstein really
did was they showed that physics is

2144
00:46:10,849 --> 00:46:10,859
did was they showed that physics is
 

2145
00:46:10,859 --> 00:46:12,589
did was they showed that physics is
inconsistent

2146
00:46:12,589 --> 00:46:12,599
inconsistent
 

2147
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:14,270
inconsistent
unless

00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:18,470
unless
a black hole can store an a number of

a black hole can store an a number of
 

2151
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,450
a black hole can store an a number of
gigabytes proportional to its area

2152
00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:22,460
gigabytes proportional to its area
 

2153
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:25,730
gigabytes proportional to its area
divided by four times

Newton's constant times Planck's
 

2157
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:30,349
Newton's constant times Planck's
Constant and that's another wild idea

2158
00:46:30,349 --> 00:46:30,359
Constant and that's another wild idea
 

2159
00:46:30,359 --> 00:46:32,210
Constant and that's another wild idea
you said area not volume

2160
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:32,220
you said area not volume
 

2161
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:33,710
you said area not volume
exactly

2162
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:33,720
exactly
 

2163
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,809
exactly
and that's the holographic principle the

2164
00:46:35,809 --> 00:46:35,819
and that's the holographic principle the
 

2165
00:46:35,819 --> 00:46:37,730
and that's the holographic principle the
universe is so weird and that's the

2166
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:37,740
universe is so weird and that's the
 

2167
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:39,230
universe is so weird and that's the
holographic principle that's called the

00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:39,240
holographic principle that's called the
 

2169
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,450

holographic principle that is it's the
 

2171
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:44,569

the holographic principle what does that
 

2175
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,569
the holographic principle what does that
mean well is this some kind of weird

2176
00:46:47,569 --> 00:46:47,579
mean well is this some kind of weird
 

2177
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:49,670
mean well is this some kind of weird
projection going on what what the heck

00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:49,680
projection going on what what the heck
 

2179
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,250
projection going on what what the heck
uh well I was just before I came here

2180
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:52,260
uh well I was just before I came here
 

2181

uh well I was just before I came here
writing an introduction to a paper and

2182
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:54,060
writing an introduction to a paper and
 

2183
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:55,910
writing an introduction to a paper and
the first sentence was

00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:55,920
the first sentence was

00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,370
the first sentence was
the

the
 

2187
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:02,450
the

2191
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:07,069

blah blah blah so nobody knows exactly

2192
00:47:07,069 --> 00:47:07,079
blah blah blah so nobody knows exactly
 

2193
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:08,569
blah blah blah so nobody knows exactly
what it is

2194
00:47:08,569 --> 00:47:08,579
what it is
 

2195
00:47:08,579 --> 00:47:11,450
what it is
but roughly speaking it says just what

2196
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:11,460
but roughly speaking it says just what
 

2197
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:14,750
but roughly speaking it says just what
we were alluding to that

2198
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:14,760
we were alluding to that
 

2199
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:15,290
we were alluding to that
um

2200
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:15,300
um
 

2201
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,589
um
really all the information

2202
00:47:17,589 --> 00:47:17,599
really all the information
 

2203
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:21,349
really all the information
that is in some volume of space-time can

2204
00:47:21,349 --> 00:47:21,359
that is in some volume of space-time can
 

2205
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:26,390
that is in some volume of space-time can
be stored on the boundary of that region

2206
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:26,400
be stored on the boundary of that region
 

2207
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,130
be stored on the boundary of that region
so this is not just about black holes

2208
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:28,140
so this is not just about black holes
 

2209
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:30,230
so this is not just about black holes
it's about any any areas based on any

2210
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:30,240
it's about any any areas based on any
 

2211
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,809
it's about any any areas based on any
area space however we've made sense of

2212
00:47:32,809 --> 00:47:32,819
area space however we've made sense of
 

2213
00:47:32,819 --> 00:47:34,550
area space however we've made sense of
the holographic principle for black

2214
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:34,560
the holographic principle for black
 

2215
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,230
the holographic principle for black
holes

2216
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:36,240
holes
 

2217
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,150
holes
we've made sense of the holographic

2218
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:38,160
we've made sense of the holographic
 

2219
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,250
we've made sense of the holographic
principle for something which could be

2220
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:40,260
principle for something which could be
 

2221
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:43,730
principle for something which could be
called anti-decider space which

2222
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:43,740
called anti-decider space which
 

2223
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:47,809
called anti-decider space which
could be thought of as a giant as the

2224
00:47:47,809 --> 00:47:47,819
could be thought of as a giant as the
 

2225
00:47:47,819 --> 00:47:52,190
could be thought of as a giant as the
black hole turned into a whole universe

2226
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:52,200

 

2227
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,870

and

2228
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:53,880
and
 

2229
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:57,710
and
um we don't really understand how to

2230
00:47:57,710 --> 00:47:57,720
um we don't really understand how to
 

2231
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:01,069
um we don't really understand how to
talk about the holographic principle for

2232
00:48:01,069 --> 00:48:01,079
talk about the holographic principle for
 

2233
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:03,589
talk about the holographic principle for
either flat space which we appear to

2234
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:03,599
either flat space which we appear to
 

2235
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:04,550
either flat space which we appear to
live in

2236
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:04,560
live in
 

2237
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,309
live in
or

2238
00:48:06,309 --> 00:48:06,319
or
 

2239
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:08,589
or
asymptotically the sitter space which

2240
00:48:08,589 --> 00:48:08,599
asymptotically the sitter space which
 

2241
00:48:08,599 --> 00:48:11,210
asymptotically the sitter space which
astronomers tell us we actually live in

2242
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:11,220
astronomers tell us we actually live in
 

2243
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:14,690
astronomers tell us we actually live in
as the universe continues to expand

2244
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:14,700
as the universe continues to expand
 

2245
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:18,050
as the universe continues to expand
so it's one of the one of the huge

2246
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:18,060
so it's one of the one of the huge
 

2247
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:24,050
so it's one of the one of the huge
problems in uh physics is to

2248
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:24,060
problems in uh physics is to
 

2249
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:27,050
problems in uh physics is to
you know apply or even formulate the

2250
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:27,060
you know apply or even formulate the
 

2251
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:29,270
you know apply or even formulate the
holographic principle for

2252
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:29,280
holographic principle for
 

2253
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,069
holographic principle for
more realistic

2254
00:48:31,069 --> 00:48:31,079
more realistic
 

2255
00:48:31,079 --> 00:48:33,290
more realistic
well black holes are realistic we see

2256
00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:33,300
well black holes are realistic we see
 

2257
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:35,870
well black holes are realistic we see
them but um

2258
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:35,880
them but um
 

2259
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:38,930
them but um
yeah in in more General context so from

2260
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:38,940
yeah in in more General context so from
 

2261
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:40,490
yeah in in more General context so from
a general statement of the holographic

2262
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:40,500
a general statement of the holographic
 

2263
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,589
a general statement of the holographic
principle what's the difference in flat

2264
00:48:42,589 --> 00:48:42,599
principle what's the difference in flat
 

2265
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:46,250
principle what's the difference in flat
space and uh asymptotic decider space so

2266
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:46,260
space and uh asymptotic decider space so
 

2267
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:48,109
space and uh asymptotic decider space so
flat space is just an approximation of

2268
00:48:48,109 --> 00:48:48,119
flat space is just an approximation of
 

2269
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:50,809
flat space is just an approximation of
like the world we live in so like uh uh

2270
00:48:50,809 --> 00:48:50,819
like the world we live in so like uh uh
 

2271
00:48:50,819 --> 00:48:53,089
like the world we live in so like uh uh
the sitter space at some time I wonder

2272
00:48:53,089 --> 00:48:53,099
the sitter space at some time I wonder
 

2273
00:48:53,099 --> 00:48:55,670
the sitter space at some time I wonder
what that even means meaning like

2274
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:55,680
what that even means meaning like
 

2275
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:59,210
what that even means meaning like
uh asymptotic over what okay so for

2276
00:48:59,210 --> 00:48:59,220
uh asymptotic over what okay so for
 

2277
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:00,650
uh asymptotic over what okay so for
thousands of years

2278
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:00,660
thousands of years
 

2279
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:03,050
thousands of years
you know until the last half of the 20th

2280
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:03,060
you know until the last half of the 20th
 

2281
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:06,170
you know until the last half of the 20th
well sorry until the 20th century

2282
00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:06,180
well sorry until the 20th century
 

2283
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:10,250
well sorry until the 20th century
um we thought space time was flat

2284
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:10,260
um we thought space time was flat
 

2285
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:12,890
um we thought space time was flat
can you elaborate on flat

2286
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:12,900
can you elaborate on flat
 

2287
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:15,650
can you elaborate on flat
or what do we mean by flat

2288
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:15,660
or what do we mean by flat
 

2289
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:18,550
or what do we mean by flat
well like the surface of this table

2290
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:18,560
well like the surface of this table
 

2291
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:22,550
well like the surface of this table
is is flat let me just give an intuitive

2292
00:49:22,550 --> 00:49:22,560
is is flat let me just give an intuitive
 

2293
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,670
is is flat let me just give an intuitive
explanation surface of the table is flat

2294
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:25,680
explanation surface of the table is flat
 

2295
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,250
explanation surface of the table is flat
but the surface of a basketball

2296
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:28,260
but the surface of a basketball
 

2297
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:30,710
but the surface of a basketball
is curved

2298
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:30,720
is curved
 

2299
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:34,010
is curved
so the universe itself

2300
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:34,020
so the universe itself
 

2301
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:36,530
so the universe itself
could be flat like the surface of a

2302
00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:36,540
could be flat like the surface of a
 

2303
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:38,930
could be flat like the surface of a
table or it could be curved like a

2304
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:38,940
table or it could be curved like a
 

2305
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:41,089
table or it could be curved like a
basketball which actually has a positive

2306
00:49:41,089 --> 00:49:41,099
basketball which actually has a positive
 

2307
00:49:41,099 --> 00:49:42,230
basketball which actually has a positive
curvature

2308
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:42,240
curvature
 

2309
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,730
curvature
and then there's another kind of

2310
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:43,740
and then there's another kind of
 

2311
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:46,370
and then there's another kind of
curvature called the negative curvature

2312
00:49:46,370 --> 00:49:46,380
curvature called the negative curvature
 

2313
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:48,710
curvature called the negative curvature
and curvature can be even weirder

2314
00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:48,720
and curvature can be even weirder
 

2315
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,870
and curvature can be even weirder
because

2316
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:50,880
because
 

2317
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,790
because
that kind of curvature I've just

2318
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:52,800
that kind of curvature I've just
 

2319
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,490
that kind of curvature I've just
described is the curvature of space

2320
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:55,500
described is the curvature of space
 

2321
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,589
described is the curvature of space
but Einstein taught us that we really

2322
00:49:57,589 --> 00:49:57,599
but Einstein taught us that we really
 

2323
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:00,050
but Einstein taught us that we really
live in a space-time continuum

2324
00:50:00,050 --> 00:50:00,060
live in a space-time continuum
 

2325
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:02,510
live in a space-time continuum
so we can have curvature in a way that

2326
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:02,520
so we can have curvature in a way that
 

2327
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:05,750
so we can have curvature in a way that
mixes up space and time

2328
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:05,760
mixes up space and time
 

2329
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,430
mixes up space and time
and that's kind of hard to visualize

2330
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:07,440
and that's kind of hard to visualize
 

2331
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,349
and that's kind of hard to visualize
because you have to step what a couple

2332
00:50:09,349 --> 00:50:09,359
because you have to step what a couple
 

2333
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:12,170
because you have to step what a couple
of Dimensions up so it's hard to you

2334
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:12,180
of Dimensions up so it's hard to you
 

2335
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:16,250
of Dimensions up so it's hard to you
have to step a couple but even a

2336
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:16,260
have to step a couple but even a
 

2337
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:19,910
have to step a couple but even a
if you have flat space and it's

2338
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:19,920
if you have flat space and it's
 

2339
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,210
if you have flat space and it's
expanding in time

2340
00:50:23,210 --> 00:50:23,220
expanding in time
 

2341
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:24,890
expanding in time
you know we could imagine we're sitting

2342
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:24,900
you know we could imagine we're sitting
 

2343
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:26,870
you know we could imagine we're sitting
here this room good approximation it's

00:50:26,870 --> 00:50:26,880
here this room good approximation it's
 

2345
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,370
here this room good approximation it's

flat but imagine we suddenly start
 

2347
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:31,370

getting further and further apart then

2348
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:31,380
getting further and further apart then
 

2349
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:34,309
getting further and further apart then
space is flat

2350
00:50:34,309 --> 00:50:34,319
space is flat
 

2351
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:36,170
space is flat
but it's expanding which means it's

2352
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:36,180
but it's expanding which means it's
 

2353
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:39,290
but it's expanding which means it's
space time is curved

the three simplest space times
 

2363
00:50:48,359 --> 00:50:50,329
the three simplest space times
are flat space time which we call

2364
00:50:50,329 --> 00:50:50,339
are flat space time which we call
 

2365
00:50:50,339 --> 00:50:52,190
are flat space time which we call
minkowski's base time

minkowski's base time
 

2367

and negatively curved space-time

2368
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:55,040
and negatively curved space-time
 

2369
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,109
and negatively curved space-time
anti-decider space

2372
00:51:00,049 --> 00:51:00,059
and positively curved space-time the
 

2373
00:51:00,059 --> 00:51:03,290

2375
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:06,290

and so astronomers

2376
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:06,300
and so astronomers
 

2377
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:09,109
and so astronomers
um think that

2378
00:51:09,109 --> 00:51:09,119
um think that
 

2379
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:11,510
um think that
on large scales even though for

2380
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:11,520
on large scales even though for
 

2381
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,670
on large scales even though for
thousands of years we hadn't noticed it

thousands of years we hadn't noticed it
 

2383
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,069
thousands of years we hadn't noticed it
beginning with Hubble

beginning with Hubble
 

2385
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:19,370
beginning with Hubble
we started to notice that space time was

2386
00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:19,380
we started to notice that space time was
 

2387
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:23,210
we started to notice that space time was
curved space is expanding in time means

2388
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:23,220
curved space is expanding in time means
 

2389
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:25,730
curved space is expanding in time means
that space time is curved

2390
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:25,740
that space time is curved
 

2391
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:29,569
that space time is curved
and the nature of this curvature is

2392
00:51:29,569 --> 00:51:29,579
and the nature of this curvature is
 

2393
00:51:29,579 --> 00:51:31,790
and the nature of this curvature is
affected by the matter in it

2394
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:31,800
affected by the matter in it
 

2395
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,910
affected by the matter in it
because matter itself

2396
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:34,920
because matter itself
 

2397
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:37,730
because matter itself
causes the curvature of space-time

2398
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:37,740
causes the curvature of space-time
 

2399
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:40,790
causes the curvature of space-time
but as it expands the matter gets more

2400
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:40,800
but as it expands the matter gets more
 

2401
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,290
but as it expands the matter gets more
and more diluted

2402
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:42,300
and more diluted
 

2403
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:45,049
and more diluted
and one might ask when it's all diluted

2404
00:51:45,049 --> 00:51:45,059
and one might ask when it's all diluted
 

2405
00:51:45,059 --> 00:51:46,130
and one might ask when it's all diluted
away

00:51:49,619 --> 00:51:53,930
is space-time still curved
and astronomers believe they've done

the universe is now expanding eventually
all the unit matter in it will be

why do we think it's there
 

2451
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,470
why do we think it's there
it's because of this it comes from the

00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,309
and um
uh we think it's there

2462
00:52:55,309 --> 00:52:55,319
uh we think it's there
 

2463
00:52:55,319 --> 00:52:57,829
uh we think it's there
because the astronomers have told us

2464
00:52:57,829 --> 00:52:57,839
because the astronomers have told us
 

2465
00:52:57,839 --> 00:52:59,089
because the astronomers have told us
it's there

2466
00:52:59,089 --> 00:52:59,099
it's there
 

2467
00:52:59,099 --> 00:53:00,829
it's there
and

2468
00:53:00,829 --> 00:53:00,839
and
 

2469
00:53:00,839 --> 00:53:04,069
and
um they they know what they're doing and

2470
00:53:04,069 --> 00:53:04,079
um they they know what they're doing and
 

2471
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:05,870
um they they know what they're doing and
we don't know really really hard

2472
00:53:05,870 --> 00:53:05,880
we don't know really really hard
 

2473
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,549
we don't know really really hard
measurement but they know they really

2474
00:53:07,549 --> 00:53:07,559
measurement but they know they really
 

2475
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:08,750
measurement but they know they really
know what they're doing

2476
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:08,760
know what they're doing
 

2477
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,309
know what they're doing
and

2478
00:53:10,309 --> 00:53:10,319
and
 

2479
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:12,950
and
we have no freaking idea why it's there

2480
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:12,960
we have no freaking idea why it's there
 

2481
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,290
we have no freaking idea why it's there
another big mystery another another

2482
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:15,300
another big mystery another another
 

2483
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:18,770
another big mystery another another
reason it's fun to be a physicist and if

2484
00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:18,780
reason it's fun to be a physicist and if
 

2485
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:23,150
reason it's fun to be a physicist and if
it is there why should it be so small

2486
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:23,160
it is there why should it be so small
 

2487
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,370
it is there why should it be so small
why should there be so little why should

2488
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:25,380
why should there be so little why should
 

2489
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:27,770
why should there be so little why should
it have hit itself from us

2490
00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:27,780
it have hit itself from us
 

2491
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:29,930
it have hit itself from us
why shouldn't there enough be enough of

2492
00:53:29,930 --> 00:53:29,940
why shouldn't there enough be enough of
 

2493
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:32,809
why shouldn't there enough be enough of
it to substantially cons curve the space

2494
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:32,819
it to substantially cons curve the space
 

2495
00:53:32,819 --> 00:53:35,270
it to substantially cons curve the space
between us and the moon why did there

2496
00:53:35,270 --> 00:53:35,280
between us and the moon why did there
 

2497
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:38,569
between us and the moon why did there
have to be such a

2498
00:53:38,569 --> 00:53:38,579
have to be such a
 

2499
00:53:38,579 --> 00:53:40,849
have to be such a
small amount that only the crazy best

2500
00:53:40,849 --> 00:53:40,859
small amount that only the crazy best
 

2501
00:53:40,859 --> 00:53:43,430
small amount that only the crazy best
astronomers in the world could find it

2502
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:43,440
astronomers in the world could find it
 

2503
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,790
astronomers in the world could find it
well again the same thing be said about

2504
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:45,800
well again the same thing be said about
 

2505
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,650
well again the same thing be said about
all all the constants

2506
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:48,660
all all the constants
 

2507
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:51,049
all all the constants
all of the content be said about gravity

2508
00:53:51,049 --> 00:53:51,059
all of the content be said about gravity
 

2509
00:53:51,059 --> 00:53:52,370
all of the content be said about gravity
can't they be said about the speed of

2510
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:52,380
can't they be said about the speed of
 

2511
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:53,270
can't they be said about the speed of
light

2512
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:53,280
light
 

2513
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,030
light
like why is the speed of light so slow

2514
00:53:56,030 --> 00:53:56,040
like why is the speed of light so slow
 

2515
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,849
like why is the speed of light so slow
so fast so slow

2516
00:53:58,849 --> 00:53:58,859
so fast so slow
 

2517
00:53:58,859 --> 00:54:00,770
so fast so slow
relative to the size of the universe

2518
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:00,780
relative to the size of the universe
 

2519
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:03,309
relative to the size of the universe
can't it be faster

2520
00:54:03,309 --> 00:54:03,319
can't it be faster
 

2521
00:54:03,319 --> 00:54:06,650
can't it be faster
or no well the speed of Lights is a

2522
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:06,660
or no well the speed of Lights is a
 

2523
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,569
or no well the speed of Lights is a
funny one because you could always

2524
00:54:08,569 --> 00:54:08,579
funny one because you could always
 

2525
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:10,849
funny one because you could always
choose units

2526
00:54:10,849 --> 00:54:10,859
choose units
 

2527
00:54:10,859 --> 00:54:13,250
choose units
in which the speed of light is one you

2528
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:13,260
in which the speed of light is one you
 

2529
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:14,990
in which the speed of light is one you
know we measure it in kilometers per

2530
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:15,000
know we measure it in kilometers per
 

2531
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,170
know we measure it in kilometers per
second and it's 100

2532
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:17,180
second and it's 100
 

2533
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:20,690
second and it's 100
86 000 or miles per second is 186 000

2534
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:20,700
86 000 or miles per second is 186 000
 

2535
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:22,010
86 000 or miles per second is 186 000
miles per second

2536
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:22,020
miles per second
 

2537
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:25,130
miles per second
and but if we had used different units

2538
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:25,140
and but if we had used different units
 

2539
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:28,790
and but if we had used different units
yeah then we could make it one but you

2540
00:54:28,790 --> 00:54:28,800
yeah then we could make it one but you
 

2541
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,549
yeah then we could make it one but you
can make dimensionless ratios

2542
00:54:31,549 --> 00:54:31,559
can make dimensionless ratios
 

2543
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:33,170
can make dimensionless ratios
so

2544
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:33,180
so
 

2545
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:35,270
so
um you know you could say why is the

2546
00:54:35,270 --> 00:54:35,280
um you know you could say why is the
 

2547
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,849
um you know you could say why is the
time scale set by the expansion of the

2548
00:54:37,849 --> 00:54:37,859
time scale set by the expansion of the
 

2549
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:41,690
time scale set by the expansion of the
universe so large compared to the time

2550
00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:41,700
universe so large compared to the time
 

2551
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:43,670
universe so large compared to the time
scale of a human life or so large

2552
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:43,680
scale of a human life or so large
 

2553
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,849
scale of a human life or so large
compared to the time scale for a neutron

2554
00:54:46,849 --> 00:54:46,859
compared to the time scale for a neutron
 

2555
00:54:46,859 --> 00:54:49,490
compared to the time scale for a neutron
to Decay you know yeah I mean ultimately

2556
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:49,500
to Decay you know yeah I mean ultimately
 

2557
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,530
to Decay you know yeah I mean ultimately
you know the reference the temporal

2558
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:51,540
you know the reference the temporal
 

2559
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:52,849
you know the reference the temporal
reference frame here is a human life

2560
00:54:52,849 --> 00:54:52,859
reference frame here is a human life
 

2561
00:54:52,859 --> 00:54:55,430
reference frame here is a human life
maybe isn't that the important thing for

2562
00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:55,440
maybe isn't that the important thing for
 

2563
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,950
maybe isn't that the important thing for
us uh descendants of Apes isn't that a

2564
00:54:57,950 --> 00:54:57,960
us uh descendants of Apes isn't that a
 

2565
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,170
us uh descendants of Apes isn't that a
really important aspect of physics

2566
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:00,180
really important aspect of physics
 

2567
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:03,290
really important aspect of physics
like uh because we kind of experienced

2568
00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:03,300
like uh because we kind of experienced
 

2569
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,690
like uh because we kind of experienced
the world we Intuit the World Through

2570
00:55:05,690 --> 00:55:05,700
the world we Intuit the World Through
 

2571
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,190
the world we Intuit the World Through
The Eyes of

2572
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:07,200
The Eyes of
 

2573
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:11,390
The Eyes of
the these biological organisms I guess

2574
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:11,400
the these biological organisms I guess
 

2575
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,970
the these biological organisms I guess
mathematics helps you escape that for a

2576
00:55:13,970 --> 00:55:13,980
mathematics helps you escape that for a
 

2577
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:15,710
mathematics helps you escape that for a
time but ultimately isn't that

2578
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:15,720
time but ultimately isn't that
 

2579
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:18,049
time but ultimately isn't that
how you wonder about the world

2580
00:55:18,049 --> 00:55:18,059
how you wonder about the world
 

2581
00:55:18,059 --> 00:55:20,809
how you wonder about the world
absolutely that like a human life yeah

2582
00:55:20,809 --> 00:55:20,819
absolutely that like a human life yeah
 

2583
00:55:20,819 --> 00:55:22,250
absolutely that like a human life yeah
time is only 100 years because if you

2584
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:22,260
time is only 100 years because if you
 

2585
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:24,230
time is only 100 years because if you
think of everything

2586
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:24,240
think of everything
 

2587
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,210
think of everything
um if you're able to think in I don't

2588
00:55:26,210 --> 00:55:26,220
um if you're able to think in I don't
 

2589
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:28,870
um if you're able to think in I don't
know in billions of years

2590
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:28,880
know in billions of years
 

2591
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,849
know in billions of years
uh then maybe everything looks way

2592
00:55:31,849 --> 00:55:31,859
uh then maybe everything looks way
 

2593
00:55:31,859 --> 00:55:33,069
uh then maybe everything looks way
different

2594
00:55:33,069 --> 00:55:33,079
different
 

2595
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:37,069
different
maybe universes are born and die and

2596
00:55:37,069 --> 00:55:37,079
maybe universes are born and die and
 

2597
00:55:37,079 --> 00:55:39,290
maybe universes are born and die and
maybe all these physical phenomena

2598
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:39,300
maybe all these physical phenomena
 

2599
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:41,450
maybe all these physical phenomena
become much more intuitive that we see

2600
00:55:41,450 --> 00:55:41,460
become much more intuitive that we see
 

2601
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:44,329
become much more intuitive that we see
at the Grand scale of general relativity

2602
00:55:44,329 --> 00:55:44,339
at the Grand scale of general relativity
 

2603
00:55:44,339 --> 00:55:47,450
at the Grand scale of general relativity
well that is one of the a little off the

2604
00:55:47,450 --> 00:55:47,460
well that is one of the a little off the
 

2605
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:49,010
well that is one of the a little off the
track here but that certainly is one of

2606
00:55:49,010 --> 00:55:49,020
track here but that certainly is one of
 

2607
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:50,809
track here but that certainly is one of
the nice things about being a physicist

2608
00:55:50,809 --> 00:55:50,819
the nice things about being a physicist
 

2609
00:55:50,819 --> 00:55:51,650
the nice things about being a physicist
it's

2610
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:51,660
it's
 

2611
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:53,510
it's
you spend a lot of time thinking about

2612
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:53,520
you spend a lot of time thinking about
 

2613
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:56,030
you spend a lot of time thinking about
you know insides of black holes and

2614
00:55:56,030 --> 00:55:56,040
you know insides of black holes and
 

2615
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:58,730
you know insides of black holes and
billions of years in the future and and

2616
00:55:58,730 --> 00:55:58,740
billions of years in the future and and
 

2617
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:00,829
billions of years in the future and and
it's sort of uh

2618
00:56:00,829 --> 00:56:00,839
it's sort of uh
 

2619
00:56:00,839 --> 00:56:04,250
it's sort of uh
gets you away from the day-to-day uh

2620
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:04,260
gets you away from the day-to-day uh
 

2621
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:06,890
gets you away from the day-to-day uh
into into another fantastic

2622
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:06,900
into into another fantastic
 

2623
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:08,569
into into another fantastic
realm

2624
00:56:08,569 --> 00:56:08,579
realm
 

2625
00:56:08,579 --> 00:56:09,950
realm
um

2626
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:09,960
um
 

2627
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:13,490
um
but I was answering your question about

2628
00:56:13,490 --> 00:56:13,500
but I was answering your question about
 

2629
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,349
but I was answering your question about
how there could be information in a

2630
00:56:15,349 --> 00:56:15,359
how there could be information in a
 

2631
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,030
how there could be information in a
black hole yes

2632
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:17,040
black hole yes
 

2633
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,710
black hole yes
so

2634
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:18,720
so
 

2635
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,690
so
Einstein only gave us

2636
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:20,700
Einstein only gave us
 

2637
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:23,990
Einstein only gave us
an approximate description and we now

2638
00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:24,000
an approximate description and we now
 

2639
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,910
an approximate description and we now
have a theory that corrects it string

2640
00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:25,920
have a theory that corrects it string
 

2641
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,069
have a theory that corrects it string
theory

2642
00:56:28,069 --> 00:56:28,079
theory
 

2643
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:31,490
theory
and now sort of was the Moment of Truth

2644
00:56:31,490 --> 00:56:31,500
and now sort of was the Moment of Truth
 

2645
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:33,410
and now sort of was the Moment of Truth
well when we first discovered String

2646
00:56:33,410 --> 00:56:33,420
well when we first discovered String
 

2647
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:35,510
well when we first discovered String
Theory we knew we knew from the get-go

2648
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:35,520
Theory we knew we knew from the get-go
 

2649
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,069
Theory we knew we knew from the get-go
that string theory would correct what

2650
00:56:37,069 --> 00:56:37,079
that string theory would correct what
 

2651
00:56:37,079 --> 00:56:38,510
that string theory would correct what
Einstein said

2652
00:56:38,510 --> 00:56:38,520
Einstein said
 

2653
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,790
Einstein said
just like Einstein corrected what Newton

2654
00:56:40,790 --> 00:56:40,800
just like Einstein corrected what Newton
 

2655
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,069
just like Einstein corrected what Newton
said

2656
00:56:43,069 --> 00:56:43,079

 

2657
00:56:43,079 --> 00:56:45,230

um but we didn't understand it well

2658
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:45,240
um but we didn't understand it well
 

2659
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:46,849
um but we didn't understand it well
enough

2660
00:56:46,849 --> 00:56:46,859
enough
 

2661
00:56:46,859 --> 00:56:49,730
enough
to actually compute the correction to

2662
00:56:49,730 --> 00:56:49,740
to actually compute the correction to
 

2663
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:53,030
to actually compute the correction to
compute how many gigabytes there were

2664
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:53,040
compute how many gigabytes there were
 

2665
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:58,450
compute how many gigabytes there were
and sometime in the early 90s

2666
00:56:58,450 --> 00:56:58,460
and sometime in the early 90s
 

2667
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:02,150
and sometime in the early 90s
we began to understand the mathematics

2668
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:02,160
we began to understand the mathematics
 

2669
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,670
we began to understand the mathematics
of string theory better and better

2670
00:57:04,670 --> 00:57:04,680
of string theory better and better
 

2671
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:07,490
of string theory better and better
and it came to the point where it was

2672
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:07,500
and it came to the point where it was
 

2673
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:10,910
and it came to the point where it was
clear that this was something we might

2674
00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:10,920
clear that this was something we might
 

2675
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:13,069
clear that this was something we might
be able to compute

2676
00:57:13,069 --> 00:57:13,079
be able to compute
 

2677
00:57:13,079 --> 00:57:15,530
be able to compute
and it was a kind of Moment of Truth for

2678
00:57:15,530 --> 00:57:15,540
and it was a kind of Moment of Truth for
 

2679
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:17,329
and it was a kind of Moment of Truth for
string theory because

2680
00:57:17,329 --> 00:57:17,339
string theory because
 

2681
00:57:17,339 --> 00:57:21,890
string theory because
if it hadn't given the answer

2682
00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:21,900
if it hadn't given the answer
 

2683
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:26,809
if it hadn't given the answer
that beckenstein and Hawking said it had

2684
00:57:26,809 --> 00:57:26,819
that beckenstein and Hawking said it had
 

2685
00:57:26,819 --> 00:57:29,210
that beckenstein and Hawking said it had
to give for consistency

2686
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:29,220
to give for consistency
 

2687
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:31,730
to give for consistency
String Theory itself would have

2688
00:57:31,730 --> 00:57:31,740
String Theory itself would have
 

2689
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:33,890
String Theory itself would have
been inconsistent and we wouldn't be

2690
00:57:33,890 --> 00:57:33,900
been inconsistent and we wouldn't be
 

2691
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:36,829
been inconsistent and we wouldn't be
doing this interview well

2692
00:57:36,829 --> 00:57:36,839
doing this interview well
 

2693
00:57:36,839 --> 00:57:39,370
doing this interview well
that's a very dramatic statement but yes

2694
00:57:39,370 --> 00:57:39,380
that's a very dramatic statement but yes
 

2695
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:42,349
that's a very dramatic statement but yes
uh that's not the most that's not the

2696
00:57:42,349 --> 00:57:42,359
uh that's not the most that's not the
 

2697
00:57:42,359 --> 00:57:44,530
uh that's not the most that's not the
most dramatic thing

2698
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:44,540
most dramatic thing
 

2699
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:47,569
most dramatic thing
I mean but like okay that's very life

2700
00:57:47,569 --> 00:57:47,579
I mean but like okay that's very life
 

2701
00:57:47,579 --> 00:57:50,270
I mean but like okay that's very life
and death you mean like that that uh

2702
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:50,280
and death you mean like that that uh
 

2703
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:51,950
and death you mean like that that uh
because string theory was Central to

2704
00:57:51,950 --> 00:57:51,960
because string theory was Central to
 

2705
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:54,349
because string theory was Central to
your work at that time is that what you

2706
00:57:54,349 --> 00:57:54,359
your work at that time is that what you
 

2707
00:57:54,359 --> 00:57:55,910
your work at that time is that what you
mean well String Theory would have been

2708
00:57:55,910 --> 00:57:55,920
mean well String Theory would have been
 

2709
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,370
mean well String Theory would have been
inconsistent yeah okay so that would be

2710
00:57:58,370 --> 00:57:58,380
inconsistent yeah okay so that would be
 

2711
00:57:58,380 --> 00:57:59,450
inconsistent yeah okay so that would be
a string theory would have been

2712
00:57:59,450 --> 00:57:59,460
a string theory would have been
 

2713
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:01,069
a string theory would have been
inconsistent but those inconsistencies

2714
00:58:01,069 --> 00:58:01,079
inconsistent but those inconsistencies
 

2715
00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:02,690
inconsistent but those inconsistencies
can give birth to other theories like

2716
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:02,700
can give birth to other theories like
 

2717
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:04,549
can give birth to other theories like
you said the inconsistency right

2718
00:58:04,549 --> 00:58:04,559
you said the inconsistency right
 

2719
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:05,809
you said the inconsistency right
something else could have happened yes

2720
00:58:05,809 --> 00:58:05,819
something else could have happened yes
 

2721
00:58:05,819 --> 00:58:08,890
something else could have happened yes
yeah it would have been a major a major

2722
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:08,900
yeah it would have been a major a major
 

2723
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:11,569
yeah it would have been a major a major
uh change in the way we think about

2724
00:58:11,569 --> 00:58:11,579
uh change in the way we think about
 

2725
00:58:11,579 --> 00:58:14,089
uh change in the way we think about
string theory if it and it was a good

2726
00:58:14,089 --> 00:58:14,099
string theory if it and it was a good
 

2727
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:17,809
string theory if it and it was a good
thing that you know one supposition that

2728
00:58:17,809 --> 00:58:17,819
thing that you know one supposition that
 

2729
00:58:17,819 --> 00:58:20,569
thing that you know one supposition that
the world is made of strings solves two

2730
00:58:20,569 --> 00:58:20,579
the world is made of strings solves two
 

2731
00:58:20,579 --> 00:58:23,569
the world is made of strings solves two
problems not not one solves the infinity

2732
00:58:23,569 --> 00:58:23,579
problems not not one solves the infinity
 

2733
00:58:23,579 --> 00:58:26,210
problems not not one solves the infinity
problem and it solved the Hawking's

2734
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:26,220
problem and it solved the Hawking's
 

2735
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:27,049
problem and it solved the Hawking's
problem

2736
00:58:27,049 --> 00:58:27,059
problem
 

2737
00:58:27,059 --> 00:58:30,190
problem
and also the way that it did it

2738
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:30,200
and also the way that it did it
 

2739
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:35,030
and also the way that it did it
was very uh was very beautiful

2740
00:58:35,030 --> 00:58:35,040
was very uh was very beautiful
 

2741
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:38,930
was very uh was very beautiful
um it it gave an alternate description

2742
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:38,940
um it it gave an alternate description
 

2743
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:40,250
um it it gave an alternate description
so

2744
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:40,260
so
 

2745
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:42,829
so
alternate description thing of things

2746
00:58:42,829 --> 00:58:42,839
alternate description thing of things
 

2747
00:58:42,839 --> 00:58:46,010
alternate description thing of things
are are uh

2748
00:58:46,010 --> 00:58:46,020
are are uh
 

2749
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:48,770
are are uh
are very common I mean we could to take

2750
00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:48,780
are very common I mean we could to take
 

2751
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:51,710
are very common I mean we could to take
a simple example this bottle of water

2752
00:58:51,710 --> 00:58:51,720
a simple example this bottle of water
 

2753
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:52,789
a simple example this bottle of water
here is

2754
00:58:52,789 --> 00:58:52,799
here is
 

2755
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:56,329
here is
90 percent full I could say it's 90 full

2756
00:58:56,329 --> 00:58:56,339
90 percent full I could say it's 90 full
 

2757
00:58:56,339 --> 00:58:59,390
90 percent full I could say it's 90 full
I could also say it's ten percent empty

2758
00:58:59,390 --> 00:58:59,400
I could also say it's ten percent empty
 

2759
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:02,690
I could also say it's ten percent empty
those are obviously the same statement

2760
00:59:02,690 --> 00:59:02,700
those are obviously the same statement
 

2761
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:05,089
those are obviously the same statement
and they're it's trivial to see that

2762
00:59:05,089 --> 00:59:05,099
and they're it's trivial to see that
 

2763
00:59:05,099 --> 00:59:06,710
and they're it's trivial to see that
they're the same but there are many

2764
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:06,720
they're the same but there are many
 

2765
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,049
they're the same but there are many
statements that can be made in

2766
00:59:09,049 --> 00:59:09,059
statements that can be made in
 

2767
00:59:09,059 --> 00:59:11,809
statements that can be made in
mathematics and mathematical physics

2768
00:59:11,809 --> 00:59:11,819
mathematics and mathematical physics
 

2769
00:59:11,819 --> 00:59:13,549
mathematics and mathematical physics
that are equivalent

2770
00:59:13,549 --> 00:59:13,559
that are equivalent
 

2771
00:59:13,559 --> 00:59:16,670
that are equivalent
but might take years to understand that

2772
00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:16,680
but might take years to understand that
 

2773
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:17,870
but might take years to understand that
they're equivalent

2774
00:59:17,870 --> 00:59:17,880
they're equivalent
 

2775
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:20,089
they're equivalent
and might take the invention or

2776
00:59:20,089 --> 00:59:20,099
and might take the invention or
 

2777
00:59:20,099 --> 00:59:21,770
and might take the invention or
discovery of whole new fields of

2778
00:59:21,770 --> 00:59:21,780
discovery of whole new fields of
 

2779
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:24,410
discovery of whole new fields of
mathematics to prove their equivalent

2780
00:59:24,410 --> 00:59:24,420
mathematics to prove their equivalent
 

2781
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:26,690
mathematics to prove their equivalent
and this was one of those

2782
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:26,700
and this was one of those
 

2783
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:30,950
and this was one of those
we found an alternate description

2784
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:30,960
we found an alternate description
 

2785
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,589
we found an alternate description
of the certain black holes and string

2786
00:59:33,589 --> 00:59:33,599
of the certain black holes and string
 

2787
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:34,490
of the certain black holes and string
theory

2788
00:59:34,490 --> 00:59:34,500
theory
 

2789
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:38,510
theory
which we could prove was equivalent and

2790
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:38,520
which we could prove was equivalent and
 

2791
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:40,670
which we could prove was equivalent and
it was a description of the black hole

2792
00:59:40,670 --> 00:59:40,680
it was a description of the black hole
 

2793
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,770
it was a description of the black hole
as a hologram

2794
00:59:42,770 --> 00:59:42,780
as a hologram
 

2795
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:45,349
as a hologram
that can be thought of a holographic

2796
00:59:45,349 --> 00:59:45,359
that can be thought of a holographic
 

2797
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:47,089
that can be thought of a holographic
plate

2798
00:59:47,089 --> 00:59:47,099
plate
 

2799
00:59:47,099 --> 00:59:49,970
plate
that could be thought of as sitting on

2800
00:59:49,970 --> 00:59:49,980
that could be thought of as sitting on
 

2801
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:52,010
that could be thought of as sitting on
the surface of the black hole

2802
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:52,020
the surface of the black hole
 

2803
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:54,530
the surface of the black hole
and the interior of the black hole

2804
00:59:54,530 --> 00:59:54,540
and the interior of the black hole
 

2805
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:57,770
and the interior of the black hole
itself sort of arises as a projection

2806
00:59:57,770 --> 00:59:57,780
itself sort of arises as a projection
 

2807
00:59:57,780 --> 01:00:00,170
itself sort of arises as a projection
uh or the near Horizon region of the

2808
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:00,180
uh or the near Horizon region of the
 

2809
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:03,049
uh or the near Horizon region of the
black hole arises as a projection

2810
01:00:03,049 --> 01:00:03,059
black hole arises as a projection
 

2811
01:00:03,059 --> 01:00:06,349
black hole arises as a projection
of that holographic plate so the two

2812
01:00:06,349 --> 01:00:06,359
of that holographic plate so the two
 

2813
01:00:06,359 --> 01:00:09,289
of that holographic plate so the two
descriptions were the hologram

2814
01:00:09,289 --> 01:00:09,299
descriptions were the hologram
 

2815
01:00:09,299 --> 01:00:11,390
descriptions were the hologram
the three-dimensional image and the

2816
01:00:11,390 --> 01:00:11,400
the three-dimensional image and the
 

2817
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,490
the three-dimensional image and the
holographic plate

2818
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:13,500
holographic plate
 

2819
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:16,309
holographic plate
and the whole gram is what Einstein

2820
01:00:16,309 --> 01:00:16,319
and the whole gram is what Einstein
 

2821
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:18,589
and the whole gram is what Einstein
discovered in the holographic plate

2822
01:00:18,589 --> 01:00:18,599
discovered in the holographic plate
 

2823
01:00:18,599 --> 01:00:21,109
discovered in the holographic plate
is what we discovered

2824
01:00:21,109 --> 01:00:21,119
is what we discovered
 

2825
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:25,490
is what we discovered
and this idea that you could describe

2826
01:00:25,490 --> 01:00:25,500
and this idea that you could describe
 

2827
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:28,789
and this idea that you could describe
things very very concretely in string

2828
01:00:28,789 --> 01:00:28,799
things very very concretely in string
 

2829
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,609
things very very concretely in string
theory in these two different languages

01:00:30,609 --> 01:00:30,619
theory in these two different languages
 

2831
01:00:30,619 --> 01:00:34,309
theory in these two different languages
of course took off and was applied to

2832
01:00:34,309 --> 01:00:34,319
of course took off and was applied to
 

2833
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:37,309
of course took off and was applied to
many uh many different

many different contexts within string

2836
01:00:40,130 --> 01:00:40,140
many different contexts within string
 

2837
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:42,530
many different contexts within string
string theory so you mentioned the

2838
01:00:42,530 --> 01:00:42,540
string theory so you mentioned the
 

2839
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:43,930
string theory so you mentioned the
infinity problem in the Hawking problem

2840
01:00:43,930 --> 01:00:43,940
infinity problem in the Hawking problem
 

2841
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:47,450
infinity problem in the Hawking problem
uh witch-hawking problem the the that

2842
01:00:47,450 --> 01:00:47,460
uh witch-hawking problem the the that
 

2843
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:49,069
uh witch-hawking problem the the that
the black hole destroys information or

2844
01:00:49,069 --> 01:00:49,079
the black hole destroys information or
 

2845
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:51,349
the black hole destroys information or
that the what which Hawking problem are

2846
01:00:51,349 --> 01:00:51,359
that the what which Hawking problem are
 

2847
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:53,690
that the what which Hawking problem are
we talking about well there's really two

2848
01:00:53,690 --> 01:00:53,700
we talking about well there's really two
 

2849
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:55,910
we talking about well there's really two
Hawking problems they're very closely

2850
01:00:55,910 --> 01:00:55,920
Hawking problems they're very closely
 

2851
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,549
Hawking problems they're very closely
related

2852
01:00:57,549 --> 01:00:57,559
related
 

2853
01:00:57,559 --> 01:01:01,309
related
one is how does the black hole store the

2854
01:01:01,309 --> 01:01:01,319
one is how does the black hole store the
 

2855
01:01:01,319 --> 01:01:03,370
one is how does the black hole store the
information

2856
01:01:03,370 --> 01:01:03,380
information
 

2857
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:04,970
information
and

2858
01:01:04,970 --> 01:01:04,980
and
 

2859
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:06,470
and
um

2860
01:01:06,470 --> 01:01:06,480
um
 

2861
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:09,670
um
that is the one that we

2862
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:09,680
that is the one that we
 

2863
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:13,549
that is the one that we
solved in some cases so it's sort of

2864
01:01:13,549 --> 01:01:13,559
solved in some cases so it's sort of
 

2865
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:17,569
solved in some cases so it's sort of
like you know your your smartphone

2866
01:01:17,569 --> 01:01:17,579
like you know your your smartphone
 

2867
01:01:17,579 --> 01:01:21,470
like you know your your smartphone
how does it store at 64 gigabytes well

2868
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:21,480
how does it store at 64 gigabytes well
 

2869
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:23,270
how does it store at 64 gigabytes well
you rip the cover off and you count the

2870
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:23,280
you rip the cover off and you count the
 

2871
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,430
you rip the cover off and you count the
chips and there's 64 of them each with a

2872
01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:25,440
chips and there's 64 of them each with a
 

2873
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,770
chips and there's 64 of them each with a
gigabyte and you know they're 64

2874
01:01:27,770 --> 01:01:27,780
gigabyte and you know they're 64
 

2875

gigabytes
 

2877
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:32,150
gigabytes
but that does not solve the problem of

2878
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:32,160
but that does not solve the problem of
 

2879
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,250
but that does not solve the problem of
how you get information in and out of

gets in and out you can't you couldn't
 

2897
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:59,030

how it's stored in the first place so
 

2905
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,910
how it's stored in the first place so
just to clarify the storage is on the

just to clarify the storage is on the
 

2907
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:08,750
just to clarify the storage is on the

01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:43,789
how a black hole
could store information on a holographic

mathematical detail and also intuitively
 

2939
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:55,250
mathematical detail and also intuitively
and it's very much like an ordinary

and it's very much like an ordinary
 

2941
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:57,289
and it's very much like an ordinary
hologram or you hold up a holographic

01:02:59,809 --> 01:02:59,819
plate and you sh it contains all the
 

2945
01:02:59,819 --> 01:03:01,609
plate and you sh it contains all the
information you shine a light through it

2946
01:03:01,609 --> 01:03:01,619
information you shine a light through it
 

2947
01:03:01,619 --> 01:03:04,390
information you shine a light through it
and you get an image which looks

2948
01:03:04,390 --> 01:03:04,400
and you get an image which looks
 

2949
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,650
and you get an image which looks
three-dimensional yeah but why should

2950
01:03:06,650 --> 01:03:06,660
three-dimensional yeah but why should
 

2951
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:10,690
three-dimensional yeah but why should
there be a holographic plate

2952
01:03:10,690 --> 01:03:10,700

 

2953
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:14,450

why should there be yeah why

2954
01:03:14,450 --> 01:03:14,460
why should there be yeah why
 

2955
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:17,270
why should there be yeah why
that is the Great thing about being a

2956
01:03:17,270 --> 01:03:17,280
that is the Great thing about being a
 

2957
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:20,329
that is the Great thing about being a
theoretical physicist is

2958
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:20,339
theoretical physicist is
 

2959
01:03:20,339 --> 01:03:23,270
theoretical physicist is
anybody can very quickly stump you if

2960
01:03:23,270 --> 01:03:23,280
anybody can very quickly stump you if
 

2961
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:25,849
anybody can very quickly stump you if
they going to the next level of wise

2962
01:03:25,849 --> 01:03:25,859
they going to the next level of wise
 

2963
01:03:25,859 --> 01:03:29,210
they going to the next level of wise
yeah so if I can just keep asking yeah

2964
01:03:29,210 --> 01:03:29,220
yeah so if I can just keep asking yeah
 

2965
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:31,190
yeah so if I can just keep asking yeah
you could just keep asking and it won't

2966
01:03:31,190 --> 01:03:31,200
you could just keep asking and it won't
 

2967
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,470
you could just keep asking and it won't
take you very long to

2968
01:03:33,470 --> 01:03:33,480
take you very long to
 

2969
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:36,589
take you very long to
so the trick in being a theory a

2970
01:03:36,589 --> 01:03:36,599
so the trick in being a theory a
 

2971
01:03:36,599 --> 01:03:38,690
so the trick in being a theory a
theoretical physics is finding the

2972
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:38,700
theoretical physics is finding the
 

2973
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:40,309
theoretical physics is finding the
questions that

2974
01:03:40,309 --> 01:03:40,319
questions that
 

2975
01:03:40,319 --> 01:03:44,210
questions that
you can answer sure so so the questions

2976
01:03:44,210 --> 01:03:44,220
you can answer sure so so the questions
 

2977
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:46,069
you can answer sure so so the questions
that we think we might be able to answer

2978
01:03:46,069 --> 01:03:46,079
that we think we might be able to answer
 

2979
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:48,890
that we think we might be able to answer
now and we've partially answered

2980
01:03:48,890 --> 01:03:48,900
now and we've partially answered
 

2981
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:51,230
now and we've partially answered
is that

2982
01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:51,240
is that
 

2983
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:55,010
is that
um there is a holographic explanation

2984
01:03:55,010 --> 01:03:55,020
um there is a holographic explanation
 

2985
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:56,650
um there is a holographic explanation
for certain

2986
01:03:56,650 --> 01:03:56,660
for certain
 

2987
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:59,690
for certain
kinds of things and string theory Sure

01:03:59,690 --> 01:03:59,700
kinds of things and string theory Sure
 

2989
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:01,670
kinds of things and string theory Sure
we've answered that

2990
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:01,680
we've answered that
 

2991
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:04,069
we've answered that
now we'd like to take what we've learned

2992
01:04:04,069 --> 01:04:04,079
now we'd like to take what we've learned
 

2993
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:06,049
now we'd like to take what we've learned
and that's what I've mostly been doing

2994
01:04:06,049 --> 01:04:06,059
and that's what I've mostly been doing
 

2995
01:04:06,059 --> 01:04:08,390
and that's what I've mostly been doing
for the last 15

2996
01:04:08,390 --> 01:04:08,400
for the last 15
 

2997
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,789
for the last 15
20 years I haven't really been working

2998
01:04:10,789 --> 01:04:10,799
20 years I haven't really been working
 

2999
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:13,069
20 years I haven't really been working
so much on string theory proper I've

3000
01:04:13,069 --> 01:04:13,079
so much on string theory proper I've
 

3001
01:04:13,079 --> 01:04:16,270
so much on string theory proper I've
been sort of taking the lessons that you

3002
01:04:16,270 --> 01:04:16,280
been sort of taking the lessons that you
 

3003
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:19,130
been sort of taking the lessons that you
we learned in string theory

3004
01:04:19,130 --> 01:04:19,140
we learned in string theory
 

3005
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:21,650
we learned in string theory
and trying to apply them to the real

3006
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:21,660
and trying to apply them to the real
 

3007
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:22,849
and trying to apply them to the real
world

3008
01:04:22,849 --> 01:04:22,859
world
 

3009
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:25,130

01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:30,410
assuming only what we know for sure
about the real world so on this uh topic

01:04:30,410 --> 01:04:30,420
about the real world so on this uh topic
 

3015
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:32,510
about the real world so on this uh topic
you you co-wrote co-author the paper

3016
01:04:32,510 --> 01:04:32,520
you you co-wrote co-author the paper
 

3017
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:35,089
you you co-wrote co-author the paper
with Stephen Hawking called soft hair on

01:04:35,089 --> 01:04:35,099
with Stephen Hawking called soft hair on
 

3019
01:04:35,099 --> 01:04:37,130
with Stephen Hawking called soft hair on
black holes yes that makes the argument

3020
01:04:37,130 --> 01:04:37,140
black holes yes that makes the argument
 

3021
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:38,750
black holes yes that makes the argument
against Hawking's original prediction

01:04:41,030 --> 01:04:41,040
that black holes destroy information can
 

3025
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:42,829
that black holes destroy information can
you explain this paper

the hair on black holes

3034
01:04:51,730 --> 01:04:51,740
the hair on black holes
 

3035
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:56,510
the hair on black holes
is a word that was coined by the

is a word that was coined by the
 

3037
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:59,870
is a word that was coined by the
greatest phrase master in the history of

01:04:59,870 --> 01:04:59,880
greatest phrase master in the history of
 

3039
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:02,089
greatest phrase master in the history of

black hole
and he also said that uh he made the

3044
01:05:08,089 --> 01:05:08,099
and he also said that uh he made the
 

3045
01:05:08,099 --> 01:05:11,470
and he also said that uh he made the
statement that black holes have no hair

3046
01:05:11,470 --> 01:05:11,480
statement that black holes have no hair
 

3047
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:16,490
statement that black holes have no hair
that is every black hole in the universe

3048
01:05:16,490 --> 01:05:16,500
that is every black hole in the universe
 

3049
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:21,650
that is every black hole in the universe
is described just by its mass and spin

um
 

3059
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:33,109
um
and this is very much unlike a star

3060
01:05:33,109 --> 01:05:33,119
and this is very much unlike a star
 

3061
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:38,510
and this is very much unlike a star
right every Star of the same mass is

black holes are all the same
and that means when you throw some in

3080
01:06:03,470 --> 01:06:03,480
and that means when you throw some in
 

3081
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:05,750
and that means when you throw some in
Einstein's description of them

which we think must be corrected
and um

3086
01:06:10,849 --> 01:06:10,859
and um
 

3087
01:06:10,859 --> 01:06:13,190
and um
if you throw something into a black hole

3088
01:06:13,190 --> 01:06:13,200
if you throw something into a black hole
 

3089
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:15,470
if you throw something into a black hole
it gets sucked in

3090
01:06:15,470 --> 01:06:15,480
it gets sucked in
 

3091
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:20,870
it gets sucked in
and if you uh throw in a red book or a

3092
01:06:20,870 --> 01:06:20,880
and if you uh throw in a red book or a
 

3093
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,430
and if you uh throw in a red book or a
Blue Book

the black hole gets a little bigger but
 

3097
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,349
the black hole gets a little bigger but
there's no way within Einstein's theory

of telling how they're different
 

3101
01:06:32,220 --> 01:06:36,470
of telling how they're different
and that was one of the assumptions

3102
01:06:36,470 --> 01:06:36,480
and that was one of the assumptions
 

3103
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:40,750
and that was one of the assumptions
that Hawking made in his

3104

that Hawking made in his
 

3105
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:45,670
that Hawking made in his

01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:45,680
1974-75 papers in which he concluded
 

3107
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:49,130
1974-75 papers in which he concluded
that black holes destroy information you

3108
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:49,140
that black holes destroy information you
 

3109
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:52,069
that black holes destroy information you

the Library of Congress it doesn't

3112
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:54,720
the Library of Congress it doesn't
 

3113
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:57,410
the Library of Congress it doesn't
matter it's going to behave exactly the

01:06:57,410 --> 01:06:57,420
matter it's going to behave exactly the
 

3115
01:06:57,420 --> 01:07:01,190
matter it's going to behave exactly the
same uniform way yeah so what what

3116
01:07:01,190 --> 01:07:01,200
same uniform way yeah so what what
 

3117
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:04,549
same uniform way yeah so what what
Hawking and I showed and also Malcolm

Perry
um

3122
01:07:06,789 --> 01:07:06,799
um
 

3123
01:07:06,799 --> 01:07:12,829
um
is that one has to be very careful about

3124
01:07:12,829 --> 01:07:12,839
is that one has to be very careful about
 

3125
01:07:12,839 --> 01:07:14,569
is that one has to be very careful about
what happens

3126
01:07:14,569 --> 01:07:14,579
what happens
 

3127
01:07:14,579 --> 01:07:17,990
what happens
at the boundary of the black hole

3128
01:07:17,990 --> 01:07:18,000
at the boundary of the black hole
 

3129
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,329
at the boundary of the black hole
and this gets back to something I

3130
01:07:20,329 --> 01:07:20,339
and this gets back to something I
 

3131
01:07:20,339 --> 01:07:23,270
and this gets back to something I
mentioned earlier about when two things

3132
01:07:23,270 --> 01:07:23,280
mentioned earlier about when two things
 

3133
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,609
mentioned earlier about when two things
which are related by a coordinate

3134
01:07:25,609 --> 01:07:25,619
which are related by a coordinate
 

3135
01:07:25,619 --> 01:07:28,130
which are related by a coordinate
transformation are and are not

3136
01:07:28,130 --> 01:07:28,140
transformation are and are not
 

3137
01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:30,890
transformation are and are not
equivalent

3138
01:07:30,890 --> 01:07:30,900
equivalent
 

3139
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:32,329
equivalent
and

3140
01:07:32,329 --> 01:07:32,339
and
 

3141
01:07:32,339 --> 01:07:33,049
and
um

3142
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:33,059
um
 

3143
01:07:33,059 --> 01:07:36,890
um
and what we showed is that they're very

3144
01:07:36,890 --> 01:07:36,900
and what we showed is that they're very
 

3145
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:39,230
and what we showed is that they're very
subtle imprints when you throw something

3146
01:07:39,230 --> 01:07:39,240
subtle imprints when you throw something
 

3147
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:41,089
subtle imprints when you throw something
into a black hole

3148
01:07:41,089 --> 01:07:41,099
into a black hole
 

3149
01:07:41,099 --> 01:07:43,970
into a black hole
they're very subtle imprints left on the

3150
01:07:43,970 --> 01:07:43,980
they're very subtle imprints left on the
 

3151
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:46,670
they're very subtle imprints left on the
horizon of the black hole which you can

3152
01:07:46,670 --> 01:07:46,680
horizon of the black hole which you can
 

3153
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:51,730
horizon of the black hole which you can
read off at least partially what went in

3154
01:07:51,730 --> 01:07:51,740
read off at least partially what went in
 

3155
01:07:51,740 --> 01:07:53,329
read off at least partially what went in
and

3156
01:07:53,329 --> 01:07:53,339
and
 

3157
01:07:53,339 --> 01:07:54,910
and
um so this

3158
01:07:54,910 --> 01:07:54,920
um so this
 

3159
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:59,829
um so this
invalidates uh Steven's original

3160
01:07:59,829 --> 01:07:59,839
invalidates uh Steven's original
 

3161
01:07:59,839 --> 01:08:03,109
invalidates uh Steven's original
uh argument that the information is

3162
01:08:03,109 --> 01:08:03,119
uh argument that the information is
 

3163
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:05,390
uh argument that the information is
destroyed and that's a soft hair that's

3164
01:08:05,390 --> 01:08:05,400
destroyed and that's a soft hair that's
 

3165
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:08,750
destroyed and that's a soft hair that's
the soft hair right so and soft is the

3166
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:08,760
the soft hair right so and soft is the
 

3167
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:11,569
the soft hair right so and soft is the
word that is used in physics for things

3168
01:08:11,569 --> 01:08:11,579
word that is used in physics for things
 

3169
01:08:11,579 --> 01:08:14,630
word that is used in physics for things
which have very low energy and these

3170
01:08:14,630 --> 01:08:14,640
which have very low energy and these
 

3171
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:17,030
which have very low energy and these
things actually carry no energy

3172
01:08:17,030 --> 01:08:17,040
things actually carry no energy
 

3173
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:18,890
things actually carry no energy
there are things in the universe which

3174
01:08:18,890 --> 01:08:18,900
there are things in the universe which
 

3175
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:20,450
there are things in the universe which
carry no energy

3176
01:08:20,450 --> 01:08:20,460
carry no energy
 

3177
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:24,829
carry no energy
you said I think to Sean Carroll

3178
01:08:24,829 --> 01:08:24,839
you said I think to Sean Carroll
 

3179
01:08:24,839 --> 01:08:26,150
you said I think to Sean Carroll
um by the way everyone should go check

3180
01:08:26,150 --> 01:08:26,160
um by the way everyone should go check
 

3181
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:28,070
um by the way everyone should go check

it's incredible and Sean Carroll is an

3184
01:08:30,709 --> 01:08:30,719
it's incredible and Sean Carroll is an
 

3185
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:32,150
it's incredible and Sean Carroll is an
incredible person I think he said there

3186
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:32,160
incredible person I think he said there
 

3187
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:34,669
incredible person I think he said there
maybe in a paper I have a quote you said

3188
01:08:34,669 --> 01:08:34,679
maybe in a paper I have a quote you said
 

3189
01:08:34,679 --> 01:08:37,430
maybe in a paper I have a quote you said
that a soft particle is a particle

3190
01:08:37,430 --> 01:08:37,440
that a soft particle is a particle
 

3191
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:39,829
that a soft particle is a particle
that has zero energy just like you said

3192
01:08:39,829 --> 01:08:39,839
that has zero energy just like you said
 

3193
01:08:39,839 --> 01:08:41,990
that has zero energy just like you said
now and when the energy goes to zero

3194
01:08:41,990 --> 01:08:42,000
now and when the energy goes to zero
 

3195
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,430
now and when the energy goes to zero
because the energy is proportional to

3196
01:08:43,430 --> 01:08:43,440
because the energy is proportional to
 

3197
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:45,950
because the energy is proportional to
the wave of length it's also spread over

3198
01:08:45,950 --> 01:08:45,960
the wave of length it's also spread over
 

3199
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:48,890
the wave of length it's also spread over
an infinitely large distance if you like

3200
01:08:48,890 --> 01:08:48,900
an infinitely large distance if you like
 

3201
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:51,169
an infinitely large distance if you like
it's spread over the whole universe

3202
01:08:51,169 --> 01:08:51,179
it's spread over the whole universe
 

3203
01:08:51,179 --> 01:08:54,050
it's spread over the whole universe
it somehow runs off to the boundary what

3204
01:08:54,050 --> 01:08:54,060
it somehow runs off to the boundary what
 

3205
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:56,209
it somehow runs off to the boundary what
we learned from that is that if you add

3206
01:08:56,209 --> 01:08:56,219
we learned from that is that if you add
 

3207
01:08:56,219 --> 01:08:58,370
we learned from that is that if you add
a zero energy particle to the vacuum you

3208
01:08:58,370 --> 01:08:58,380
a zero energy particle to the vacuum you
 

3209
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:01,189
a zero energy particle to the vacuum you
get a new state and so there are

3210
01:09:01,189 --> 01:09:01,199
get a new state and so there are
 

3211
01:09:01,199 --> 01:09:04,610
get a new state and so there are
infinitely many vacuole

3212
01:09:04,610 --> 01:09:04,620
infinitely many vacuole
 

3213
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:07,130
infinitely many vacuole
plural for vacuum which can be thought

3214
01:09:07,130 --> 01:09:07,140
plural for vacuum which can be thought
 

3215
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:09,950
plural for vacuum which can be thought
of as being different from one another

3216
01:09:09,950 --> 01:09:09,960
of as being different from one another
 

3217
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:12,590
of as being different from one another
by the addition of soft photons or soft

3218
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:12,600
by the addition of soft photons or soft
 

3219
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:16,249
by the addition of soft photons or soft
gravitons right can you uh elaborate on

3220
01:09:16,249 --> 01:09:16,259
gravitons right can you uh elaborate on
 

3221
01:09:16,259 --> 01:09:18,709
gravitons right can you uh elaborate on
this wild idea

3222
01:09:18,709 --> 01:09:18,719
this wild idea
 

3223
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:20,630
this wild idea
if you like it spreads over the whole

3224
01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:20,640
if you like it spreads over the whole
 

3225
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:23,209
if you like it spreads over the whole
universe when the energy goes to zero

3226
01:09:23,209 --> 01:09:23,219
universe when the energy goes to zero
 

3227
01:09:23,219 --> 01:09:24,950
universe when the energy goes to zero
because the energy is proportional to

3228
01:09:24,950 --> 01:09:24,960
because the energy is proportional to
 

3229
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,630
because the energy is proportional to
the wavelength it also spreads over an

3230
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:26,640
the wavelength it also spreads over an
 

3231
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:28,729
the wavelength it also spreads over an
infinitely large distance if you like

3232
01:09:28,729 --> 01:09:28,739
infinitely large distance if you like
 

3233
01:09:28,739 --> 01:09:30,709
infinitely large distance if you like
it's spread over the whole unit it's

3234
01:09:30,709 --> 01:09:30,719
it's spread over the whole unit it's
 

3235
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:32,870
it's spread over the whole unit it's
spread over the whole universe what

3236
01:09:32,870 --> 01:09:32,880
spread over the whole universe what
 

3237
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:35,930
spread over the whole universe what
um can you explain these soft gravitons

3238
01:09:35,930 --> 01:09:35,940
um can you explain these soft gravitons
 

3239
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:37,189
um can you explain these soft gravitons
and photons

3240
01:09:37,189 --> 01:09:37,199
and photons
 

3241
01:09:37,199 --> 01:09:41,209
and photons
yeah so the soft gravitons and photons

3242
01:09:41,209 --> 01:09:41,219
yeah so the soft gravitons and photons
 

3243
01:09:41,219 --> 01:09:46,729
yeah so the soft gravitons and photons
um have been uh known about since the

3244
01:09:46,729 --> 01:09:46,739
um have been uh known about since the
 

3245
01:09:46,739 --> 01:09:47,950
um have been uh known about since the
60s

3246
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:47,960
60s
 

3247
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:50,990
60s
but exactly what we're supposed to do

3248
01:09:50,990 --> 01:09:51,000
but exactly what we're supposed to do
 

3249
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,910
but exactly what we're supposed to do
with them or how we're supposed to think

3250
01:09:52,910 --> 01:09:52,920
with them or how we're supposed to think

about them
 

3253
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:57,130
about them
um I think what has been

3254
01:09:57,130 --> 01:09:57,140
um I think what has been
 

3255
01:09:57,140 --> 01:09:59,450
um I think what has been
well understood

3256
01:09:59,450 --> 01:09:59,460
well understood
 

3257
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:01,729

01:10:12,179 --> 01:10:14,570
times its wavelength
so when the energy goes to zero the

3268
01:10:14,570 --> 01:10:14,580
so when the energy goes to zero the
 

3269
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:17,169
so when the energy goes to zero the
wavelength gets goes to Infinity

3270
01:10:17,169 --> 01:10:17,179
wavelength gets goes to Infinity
 

3271
01:10:17,179 --> 01:10:21,130
wavelength gets goes to Infinity
now if something has

3272
01:10:21,130 --> 01:10:21,140
now if something has
 

3273
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:24,649
now if something has
uh zero energy and it's spread all over

3274
01:10:24,649 --> 01:10:24,659
uh zero energy and it's spread all over
 

3275
01:10:24,659 --> 01:10:26,030
uh zero energy and it's spread all over
the universe

3276
01:10:26,030 --> 01:10:26,040
the universe
 

3277
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:29,030
the universe
in what sense is it actually there

3278
01:10:29,030 --> 01:10:29,040
in what sense is it actually there
 

3279
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:32,330
in what sense is it actually there
that's yeah that's been the confusing

3280
01:10:32,330 --> 01:10:32,340
that's yeah that's been the confusing
 

3281
01:10:32,340 --> 01:10:33,290
that's yeah that's been the confusing
thing

3282
01:10:33,290 --> 01:10:33,300
thing
 

3283
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:37,430
thing
to make a precise statement about when

3284
01:10:37,430 --> 01:10:37,440
to make a precise statement about when
 

3285
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:39,649
to make a precise statement about when
something is and isn't there

3286
01:10:39,649 --> 01:10:39,659
something is and isn't there
 

3287
01:10:39,659 --> 01:10:43,910
something is and isn't there
now the simplest way of seeing

3288
01:10:43,910 --> 01:10:43,920
now the simplest way of seeing
 

3289
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:46,729
now the simplest way of seeing
so people might have taken the point of

3290
01:10:46,729 --> 01:10:46,739
so people might have taken the point of
 

3291
01:10:46,739 --> 01:10:47,810
so people might have taken the point of
view

3292
01:10:47,810 --> 01:10:47,820
view
 

3293
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:52,490
view
that if it has zero energy and is spread

3294
01:10:52,490 --> 01:10:52,500
that if it has zero energy and is spread
 

3295
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:54,950
that if it has zero energy and is spread
all over the universe it's not there we

3296
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:54,960
all over the universe it's not there we
 

3297
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:58,130
all over the universe it's not there we
can ignore it

3298
01:10:58,130 --> 01:10:58,140

 

3299
01:10:58,140 --> 01:11:01,850

um but if you do this you'll get into

3300
01:11:01,850 --> 01:11:01,860
um but if you do this you'll get into
 

3301
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:03,050
um but if you do this you'll get into
trouble

3302
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:03,060
trouble
 

3303
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:04,850
trouble
and one of the ways that you'll get into

3304
01:11:04,850 --> 01:11:04,860
and one of the ways that you'll get into
 

3305
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:07,610
and one of the ways that you'll get into
trouble is that even though it has zero

3306
01:11:07,610 --> 01:11:07,620
trouble is that even though it has zero
 

3307
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:10,189
trouble is that even though it has zero
energy it doesn't have zero angular

3308
01:11:10,189 --> 01:11:10,199
energy it doesn't have zero angular
 

3309
01:11:10,199 --> 01:11:12,050
energy it doesn't have zero angular
momentum

3310
01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:12,060
momentum
 

3311
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:14,270
momentum
if it's a photon it always has angular

3312
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:14,280
if it's a photon it always has angular
 

3313
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:17,810
if it's a photon it always has angular
momentum one if it's a graviton it's uh

3314
01:11:17,810 --> 01:11:17,820
momentum one if it's a graviton it's uh
 

3315
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:21,649
momentum one if it's a graviton it's uh
angular momentum two

3316
01:11:21,649 --> 01:11:21,659

 

3317
01:11:21,659 --> 01:11:25,430

so you can't say that the state of the

3318
01:11:25,430 --> 01:11:25,440
so you can't say that the state of the
 

3319
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:29,510
so you can't say that the state of the
system with the Zero Energy Photon

3320
01:11:29,510 --> 01:11:29,520
system with the Zero Energy Photon
 

3321
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:33,050
system with the Zero Energy Photon
should be identified with the one

3322
01:11:33,050 --> 01:11:33,060
should be identified with the one
 

3323
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:35,630
should be identified with the one
without the Zero Energy Photon that we

3324
01:11:35,630 --> 01:11:35,640
without the Zero Energy Photon that we
 

3325
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:37,189
without the Zero Energy Photon that we
can just ignore them because then you

3326
01:11:37,189 --> 01:11:37,199
can just ignore them because then you
 

3327
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:39,890
can just ignore them because then you
will conclude that angular momentum is

3328
01:11:39,890 --> 01:11:39,900
will conclude that angular momentum is
 

3329
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:41,810
will conclude that angular momentum is
not conserved

3330
01:11:41,810 --> 01:11:41,820
not conserved
 

3331
01:11:41,820 --> 01:11:44,149
not conserved
and the angular momentum is not

3332
01:11:44,149 --> 01:11:44,159
and the angular momentum is not
 

3333
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:47,570
and the angular momentum is not
conserved things won't be consistent

3334
01:11:47,570 --> 01:11:47,580
conserved things won't be consistent
 

3335
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:48,890
conserved things won't be consistent
and

3336
01:11:48,890 --> 01:11:48,900
and
 

3337
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:51,350
and
um and of course you can have a lot of

3338
01:11:51,350 --> 01:11:51,360
um and of course you can have a lot of
 

3339
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:53,450
um and of course you can have a lot of
these things and typically you do get a

3340
01:11:53,450 --> 01:11:53,460
these things and typically you do get a
 

3341
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:54,649
these things and typically you do get a
lot of them

3342
01:11:54,649 --> 01:11:54,659
lot of them
 

3343
01:11:54,659 --> 01:11:57,229
lot of them
and when you you can actually do a

3344
01:11:57,229 --> 01:11:57,239
and when you you can actually do a
 

3345
01:11:57,239 --> 01:11:59,450
and when you you can actually do a
calculation that shows that every time

3346
01:11:59,450 --> 01:11:59,460
calculation that shows that every time
 

3347
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:01,490
calculation that shows that every time
you scatter

3348
01:12:01,490 --> 01:12:01,500
you scatter
 

3349
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:03,709
you scatter
two particles you create an infinite

3350
01:12:03,709 --> 01:12:03,719
two particles you create an infinite
 

3351
01:12:03,719 --> 01:12:05,870
two particles you create an infinite
number of them infinite number of the

3352
01:12:05,870 --> 01:12:05,880
number of them infinite number of the
 

3353
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:08,630
number of them infinite number of the
soft photons the Zero Energy ones yeah

3354
01:12:08,630 --> 01:12:08,640
soft photons the Zero Energy ones yeah
 

3355
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,970
soft photons the Zero Energy ones yeah
and so these are and they're somehow

3356
01:12:10,970 --> 01:12:10,980
and so these are and they're somehow
 

3357
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:13,010
and so these are and they're somehow
everywhere but they're everywhere but

3358
01:12:13,010 --> 01:12:13,020
everywhere but they're everywhere but
 

3359
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:14,570
everywhere but they're everywhere but
they're also contained information or

3360
01:12:14,570 --> 01:12:14,580
they're also contained information or
 

3361
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:16,370
they're also contained information or
they're able to store information and

3362
01:12:16,370 --> 01:12:16,380
they're able to store information and
 

3363
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:17,390
they're able to store information and
they're able to store information

3364
01:12:17,390 --> 01:12:17,400
they're able to store information
 

3365
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:20,390
they're able to store information
they're able to store an arbitrary large

3366
01:12:20,390 --> 01:12:20,400
they're able to store an arbitrary large
 

3367
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,250
they're able to store an arbitrary large
amount of information

3368
01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:22,260
amount of information
 

3369
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:25,669
amount of information
so what we pointed out is

3370
01:12:25,669 --> 01:12:25,679
so what we pointed out is
 

3371
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:27,950
so what we pointed out is
so what these things really do one way

3372
01:12:27,950 --> 01:12:27,960
so what these things really do one way
 

3373
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:29,689
so what these things really do one way
of thinking of them is they rush off to

3374
01:12:29,689 --> 01:12:29,699
of thinking of them is they rush off to
 

3375
01:12:29,699 --> 01:12:31,550
of thinking of them is they rush off to
the edges of the universe

3376
01:12:31,550 --> 01:12:31,560
the edges of the universe
 

3377
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:33,950
the edges of the universe
spreading out all over the space is like

3378
01:12:33,950 --> 01:12:33,960
spreading out all over the space is like
 

3379
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:35,750
spreading out all over the space is like
saying they rush off to the energy edge

3380
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:35,760
saying they rush off to the energy edge
 

3381
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:37,370
saying they rush off to the energy edge
of the universe right

3382
01:12:37,370 --> 01:12:37,380
of the universe right
 

3383
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:40,189
of the universe right
and that includes if the interior of the

3384
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:40,199
and that includes if the interior of the
 

3385
01:12:40,199 --> 01:12:42,410
and that includes if the interior of the
black hole is not considered part of the

3386
01:12:42,410 --> 01:12:42,420
black hole is not considered part of the
 

3387
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:44,270
black hole is not considered part of the
universe that includes the edge of the

3388
01:12:44,270 --> 01:12:44,280
universe that includes the edge of the
 

3389
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:46,850
universe that includes the edge of the
black hole

3390
01:12:46,850 --> 01:12:46,860

 

3391
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:49,729

so we need to set up our description of

3392
01:12:49,729 --> 01:12:49,739
so we need to set up our description of
 

3393
01:12:49,739 --> 01:12:50,810
so we need to set up our description of
physics

3394
01:12:50,810 --> 01:12:50,820
physics
 

3395
01:12:50,820 --> 01:12:53,930
physics
so that all the things that are

3396
01:12:53,930 --> 01:12:53,940
so that all the things that are
 

3397
01:12:53,940 --> 01:12:55,790
so that all the things that are
conserved

3398
01:12:55,790 --> 01:12:55,800
conserved
 

3399
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:57,830
conserved
are still conserved in the way that

3400
01:12:57,830 --> 01:12:57,840
are still conserved in the way that
 

3401
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:00,290
are still conserved in the way that
we're describing them and that will not

3402
01:13:00,290 --> 01:13:00,300
we're describing them and that will not
 

3403
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:02,090
we're describing them and that will not
be true if we ignore these things we

3404
01:13:02,090 --> 01:13:02,100
be true if we ignore these things we
 

3405
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:03,709
be true if we ignore these things we
have to keep careful track of these

3406
01:13:03,709 --> 01:13:03,719
have to keep careful track of these
 

3407
01:13:03,719 --> 01:13:05,030
have to keep careful track of these
things

3408
01:13:05,030 --> 01:13:05,040
things
 

3409
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:07,070
things
and people had been sloppy about that

3410
01:13:07,070 --> 01:13:07,080
and people had been sloppy about that
 

3411
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:09,410
and people had been sloppy about that
that and we learned how to be very

3412
01:13:09,410 --> 01:13:09,420
that and we learned how to be very
 

3413
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:11,570
that and we learned how to be very
precise and careful about it and this

3414
01:13:11,570 --> 01:13:11,580
precise and careful about it and this
 

3415
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:13,430
precise and careful about it and this
and once you're being precise you can

3416
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:13,440
and once you're being precise you can
 

3417
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:15,470
and once you're being precise you can
actually uh that makes you can actually

3418
01:13:15,470 --> 01:13:15,480
actually uh that makes you can actually
 

3419
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:17,689
actually uh that makes you can actually
answer this kind of very problematic

3420
01:13:17,689 --> 01:13:17,699
answer this kind of very problematic
 

3421
01:13:17,699 --> 01:13:19,729
answer this kind of very problematic
thing that Hawking suggested that black

3422
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:19,739
thing that Hawking suggested that black
 

3423
01:13:19,739 --> 01:13:22,850
thing that Hawking suggested that black
holes destroy information well what we

3424
01:13:22,850 --> 01:13:22,860

01:13:23,930 --> 01:13:23,940
showed
 

3427
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:27,410
showed
is that there's an error in the argument

3428
01:13:27,410 --> 01:13:27,420
is that there's an error in the argument
 

3429
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:29,870
is that there's an error in the argument
that all black holes are the same

3430
01:13:29,870 --> 01:13:29,880
that all black holes are the same
 

3431
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:33,050
that all black holes are the same
because they hadn't kept track of these

3432
01:13:33,050 --> 01:13:33,060
because they hadn't kept track of these
 

3433
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:35,930
because they hadn't kept track of these
uh these very subtle things

3434
01:13:35,930 --> 01:13:35,940
uh these very subtle things
 

3435
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:37,490
uh these very subtle things
and

3436
01:13:37,490 --> 01:13:37,500
and
 

3437
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:39,649
and
um whether or not

3438
01:13:39,649 --> 01:13:39,659
um whether or not
 

3439
01:13:39,659 --> 01:13:43,310
um whether or not
this is the key error in the argument

3440
01:13:43,310 --> 01:13:43,320
this is the key error in the argument
 

3441
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:46,669
this is the key error in the argument
remains to be seen or whether this is a

3442
01:13:46,669 --> 01:13:46,679
remains to be seen or whether this is a
 

3443
01:13:46,679 --> 01:13:49,250
remains to be seen or whether this is a
technical Point yes but it is an error

3444
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:49,260
technical Point yes but it is an error
 

3445
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:53,270
technical Point yes but it is an error
it is an error and uh Hawking obviously

3446
01:13:53,270 --> 01:13:53,280
it is an error and uh Hawking obviously
 

3447
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:55,010
it is an error and uh Hawking obviously
agreed with it Hawking agreed with it

3448
01:13:55,010 --> 01:13:55,020
agreed with it Hawking agreed with it
 

3449
01:13:55,020 --> 01:13:57,950
agreed with it Hawking agreed with it
and he was sure that this was the he was

3450
01:13:57,950 --> 01:13:57,960
and he was sure that this was the he was
 

3451
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:00,169
and he was sure that this was the he was
sure that this was this was a critical

3452
01:14:00,169 --> 01:14:00,179
sure that this was this was a critical
 

3453
01:14:00,179 --> 01:14:01,850
sure that this was this was a critical
error that this was the critical error

3454
01:14:01,850 --> 01:14:01,860
error that this was the critical error
 

3455
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:05,090
error that this was the critical error
in that understanding this would would

3456
01:14:05,090 --> 01:14:05,100
in that understanding this would would
 

3457
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:07,490
in that understanding this would would
would get us the whole story and and and

3458
01:14:07,490 --> 01:14:07,500
would get us the whole story and and and
 

3459
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:10,070
would get us the whole story and and and
and and that could well be what was it

3460
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:10,080
and and that could well be what was it
 

3461
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:11,689
and and that could well be what was it
like working with Stephen Hawking on

3462
01:14:11,689 --> 01:14:11,699
like working with Stephen Hawking on
 

3463
01:14:11,699 --> 01:14:14,750
like working with Stephen Hawking on

his Oneness with
the problem and uh I mean it's

3480
01:14:36,290 --> 01:14:36,300
the problem and uh I mean it's
 

3481
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:38,810
the problem and uh I mean it's
so his mind is all occupied by the world

3482
01:14:38,810 --> 01:14:38,820
so his mind is all occupied by the world
 

3483

a lot of distractions pulling it is uh
 

3493
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:55,130
a lot of distractions pulling it is uh
at his mind he's still there that's

3494
01:14:55,130 --> 01:14:55,140
at his mind he's still there that's
 

3495
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:57,709
at his mind he's still there that's
right I remember him turning down

3496
01:14:57,709 --> 01:14:57,719
right I remember him turning down
 

3497
01:14:57,719 --> 01:15:00,290

that my friend's dedication what did you
 

3503
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:11,209
that my friend's dedication what did you
learn about physics what did you learn

3504

learn about physics what did you learn
 

3505
01:15:11,219 --> 01:15:14,689
learn about physics what did you learn
about life uh from uh having worked with

3506

Stephen Hawking well he was one of my

3508
01:15:16,310 --> 01:15:16,320
Stephen Hawking well he was one of my
 

3509
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,169
Stephen Hawking well he was one of my
great teachers of course he's he's older

3510
01:15:18,169 --> 01:15:18,179
great teachers of course he's he's older

than me and I was I was reading his um
 

3513
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:26,390
than me and I was I was reading his um
his textbooks in in um

3515
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:30,130

in graduate school and um

3516
01:15:30,130 --> 01:15:30,140
in graduate school and um
 

3517
01:15:30,140 --> 01:15:33,290
in graduate school and um
uh you know I learned a lot about uh

3518
01:15:33,290 --> 01:15:33,300
uh you know I learned a lot about uh
 

3519
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:35,990
uh you know I learned a lot about uh
relativity from him I learned about

3520
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:36,000
relativity from him I learned about
 

3521
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,830
relativity from him I learned about
passion for a problem I I learned about

3522
01:15:39,830 --> 01:15:39,840
passion for a problem I I learned about
 

3523
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:41,930
passion for a problem I I learned about
um

3524
01:15:41,930 --> 01:15:41,940

 

3525
01:15:41,940 --> 01:15:44,450

not caring what other

3526
01:15:44,450 --> 01:15:44,460
not caring what other
 

3527
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:47,149
not caring what other
people think you know I mean physics

3528
01:15:47,149 --> 01:15:47,159
people think you know I mean physics
 

3529
01:15:47,159 --> 01:15:48,290
people think you know I mean physics
isn't

3530
01:15:48,290 --> 01:15:48,300
isn't
 

3531
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:50,689
isn't
interesting culture even if you make a

3532
01:15:50,689 --> 01:15:50,699
interesting culture even if you make a
 

3533
01:15:50,699 --> 01:15:52,250
interesting culture even if you make a
great discovery

3534
01:15:52,250 --> 01:15:52,260
great discovery
 

3535
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:55,090
great discovery
like Walking Dead

3536
01:15:55,090 --> 01:15:55,100
like Walking Dead
 

3537

people don't believe everything you say

3538
01:15:58,090 --> 01:15:58,100
people don't believe everything you say
 

3539
01:15:58,100 --> 01:16:01,970

in fact people love to disagree

3540
01:16:01,970 --> 01:16:01,980
in fact people love to disagree
 

3541
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:06,709
in fact people love to disagree
it's it's a it's a a culture that uh

3542
01:16:06,709 --> 01:16:06,719
it's it's a it's a a culture that uh
 

3543
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:10,010
it's it's a it's a a culture that uh
cherishes disagreement and and so you

3544
01:16:10,010 --> 01:16:10,020
cherishes disagreement and and so you
 

3545
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:12,410
cherishes disagreement and and so you
know he kept ahead with what he believed

3546
01:16:12,410 --> 01:16:12,420
know he kept ahead with what he believed
 

3547
01:16:12,420 --> 01:16:14,330
know he kept ahead with what he believed
in and sometimes he was right and

3548
01:16:14,330 --> 01:16:14,340
in and sometimes he was right and
 

3549
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:16,250
in and sometimes he was right and
sometimes he was wrong do you feel

3550
01:16:16,250 --> 01:16:16,260
sometimes he was wrong do you feel
 

3551
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:17,689
sometimes he was wrong do you feel
pressure from the community so for

3552
01:16:17,689 --> 01:16:17,699
pressure from the community so for
 

3553
01:16:17,699 --> 01:16:19,550
pressure from the community so for
example with strength Theory

3554
01:16:19,550 --> 01:16:19,560
example with strength Theory
 

3555
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:22,310

I was very popular for a time there's a

3556
01:16:22,310 --> 01:16:22,320
I was very popular for a time there's a
 

3557
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:25,070
I was very popular for a time there's a
bit of criticism or is less popular now

3558
01:16:25,070 --> 01:16:25,080
bit of criticism or is less popular now
 

3559
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:27,169
bit of criticism or is less popular now
do you feel the forces of the community

3560
01:16:27,169 --> 01:16:27,179
do you feel the forces of the community
 

3561
01:16:27,179 --> 01:16:29,149
do you feel the forces of the community
as it moves in and out of different

3562
01:16:29,149 --> 01:16:29,159
as it moves in and out of different
 

3563
01:16:29,159 --> 01:16:31,669
as it moves in and out of different
fields or do you try to stay like how

3564
01:16:31,669 --> 01:16:31,679
fields or do you try to stay like how
 

3565
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:33,229
fields or do you try to stay like how
difficult is it to stay uh

3566
01:16:33,229 --> 01:16:33,239
difficult is it to stay uh
 

3567
01:16:33,239 --> 01:16:35,450
difficult is it to stay uh
intellectually and mathematically

3568
01:16:35,450 --> 01:16:35,460
intellectually and mathematically
 

3569
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:39,649
intellectually and mathematically
independent from the community

3570
01:16:39,649 --> 01:16:39,659

 

3571
01:16:39,659 --> 01:16:43,450

I when I
started out in graduate school the

3580
01:16:54,830 --> 01:16:54,840
started out in graduate school the
 

3581
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:58,149
started out in graduate school the
problem of quantum gravity was

3582
01:16:58,149 --> 01:16:58,159
problem of quantum gravity was
 

3583
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:01,130
problem of quantum gravity was
not considered interesting

3589
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:08,390
anyway I I'm a little bit of a
contrarian I guess and I think that has

3590
01:17:08,390 --> 01:17:08,400
contrarian I guess and I think that has
 

3591
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:10,850
contrarian I guess and I think that has
served me well

3592
01:17:10,850 --> 01:17:10,860
served me well
 

3593
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:11,590
served me well
um

3594
01:17:11,590 --> 01:17:11,600
um
 

3595
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:14,990
um
and uh

3596
01:17:14,990 --> 01:17:15,000

 

3597
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,970

people are always sort of disagreeing

3598
01:17:16,970 --> 01:17:16,980
people are always sort of disagreeing
 

3599
01:17:16,980 --> 01:17:17,990
people are always sort of disagreeing
with me

3600
01:17:17,990 --> 01:17:18,000
with me
 

3601
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,229
with me
and they're usually right but I'm right

3602
01:17:21,229 --> 01:17:21,239
and they're usually right but I'm right
 

3603
01:17:21,239 --> 01:17:23,570
and they're usually right but I'm right
enough and like you said the

3604
01:17:23,570 --> 01:17:23,580
enough and like you said the
 

3605
01:17:23,580 --> 01:17:25,669
enough and like you said the
contradiction ultimately paves the path

3606
01:17:25,669 --> 01:17:25,679
contradiction ultimately paves the path
 

3607
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:28,669
contradiction ultimately paves the path
of Discovery yeah uh let me ask you just

3608
01:17:28,669 --> 01:17:28,679
of Discovery yeah uh let me ask you just
 

3609
01:17:28,679 --> 01:17:29,810
of Discovery yeah uh let me ask you just
on this tension we've been dancing

3610
01:17:29,810 --> 01:17:29,820
on this tension we've been dancing
 

3611
01:17:29,820 --> 01:17:32,149
on this tension we've been dancing
between physics and Mathematics

3612
01:17:32,149 --> 01:17:32,159
between physics and Mathematics
 

3613
01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:35,090
between physics and Mathematics
um what to you is an interesting line

3614
01:17:35,090 --> 01:17:35,100
um what to you is an interesting line
 

3615
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:37,430
um what to you is an interesting line
you can draw between the two uh you have

3616
01:17:37,430 --> 01:17:37,440
you can draw between the two uh you have
 

3617
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:39,410
you can draw between the two uh you have
done some very complicated mathematics

3618
01:17:39,410 --> 01:17:39,420
done some very complicated mathematics
 

3619
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:40,970
done some very complicated mathematics
in your life to explore the laws of

3620
01:17:40,970 --> 01:17:40,980
in your life to explore the laws of
 

3621
01:17:40,980 --> 01:17:43,130
in your life to explore the laws of
nature what's the difference between

3622
01:17:43,130 --> 01:17:43,140
nature what's the difference between
 

3623
01:17:43,140 --> 01:17:45,709
nature what's the difference between
physics and Mathematics

3624
01:17:45,709 --> 01:17:45,719
physics and Mathematics
 

3625
01:17:45,719 --> 01:17:49,550
physics and Mathematics
to you well um

3626
01:17:49,550 --> 01:17:49,560
to you well um
 

3627
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:52,729
to you well um
I love math I think my first love is is

3628
01:17:52,729 --> 01:17:52,739
I love math I think my first love is is
 

3629
01:17:52,739 --> 01:17:55,910
I love math I think my first love is is
physics and the math that I've done I've

3630
01:17:55,910 --> 01:17:55,920
physics and the math that I've done I've
 

3631
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:59,990
physics and the math that I've done I've
I've done to because it was needed and

3632
01:17:59,990 --> 01:18:00,000
I've done to because it was needed and
 

3633
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,330
I've done to because it was needed and
serve as a physics in service of physics

3634
01:18:02,330 --> 01:18:02,340
serve as a physics in service of physics
 

3635
01:18:02,340 --> 01:18:04,669
serve as a physics in service of physics
but then of course in the

3636
01:18:04,669 --> 01:18:04,679
but then of course in the
 

3637
01:18:04,679 --> 01:18:08,450
but then of course in the
In the Heat of it it has its own appeal

3638
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:08,460
In the Heat of it it has its own appeal
 

3639
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:11,689
In the Heat of it it has its own appeal
and uh In the Heat of it I like it sure

3640
01:18:11,689 --> 01:18:11,699
and uh In the Heat of it I like it sure
 

3641
01:18:11,699 --> 01:18:14,510
and uh In the Heat of it I like it sure
it has its its own appeal and I

3642
01:18:14,510 --> 01:18:14,520
it has its its own appeal and I
 

3643
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:16,610
it has its its own appeal and I
certainly enjoyed it and

3644
01:18:16,610 --> 01:18:16,620
certainly enjoyed it and
 

3645
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:19,490
certainly enjoyed it and
ultimately I would like to think I

3646
01:18:19,490 --> 01:18:19,500
ultimately I would like to think I
 

3647
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:21,229
ultimately I would like to think I
wouldn't say I believe

3648
01:18:21,229 --> 01:18:21,239
wouldn't say I believe
 

3649
01:18:21,239 --> 01:18:24,410
wouldn't say I believe
but I would like like to think that

3650
01:18:24,410 --> 01:18:24,420
but I would like like to think that
 

3651
01:18:24,420 --> 01:18:26,930
but I would like like to think that
there's no difference between physics

3652
01:18:26,930 --> 01:18:26,940
there's no difference between physics
 

3653
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:29,870
there's no difference between physics
and Mathematics that

3654
01:18:29,870 --> 01:18:29,880
and Mathematics that
 

3655
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:32,030
and Mathematics that
or mathematics

3656
01:18:32,030 --> 01:18:32,040
or mathematics
 

3657
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:34,910
or mathematics
is realized in the physical world and

3658
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:34,920
is realized in the physical world and
 

3659
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:37,910
is realized in the physical world and
all physics has a for a mathematical

3660
01:18:37,910 --> 01:18:37,920
all physics has a for a mathematical
 

3661
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:39,770
all physics has a for a mathematical
basis that they're really the same thing

3662
01:18:39,770 --> 01:18:39,780
basis that they're really the same thing
 

3663
01:18:39,780 --> 01:18:43,010
basis that they're really the same thing
I mean why would there be math that had

3664
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:43,020
I mean why would there be math that had
 

3665
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:46,149
I mean why would there be math that had
no physical

3666
01:18:46,149 --> 01:18:46,159

 

3667
01:18:46,159 --> 01:18:48,950

manifestation it seems a little odd

3668
01:18:48,950 --> 01:18:48,960
manifestation it seems a little odd
 

3669
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:51,590
manifestation it seems a little odd
right you have two kinds of math some

3670
01:18:51,590 --> 01:18:51,600
right you have two kinds of math some
 

3671
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:52,669
right you have two kinds of math some
that

3672
01:18:52,669 --> 01:18:52,679
that
 

3673
01:18:52,679 --> 01:18:54,470
that
are relevant to the real world where

3674
01:18:54,470 --> 01:18:54,480
are relevant to the real world where
 

3675
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:55,729
are relevant to the real world where
they don't have to be contradictory but

3676
01:18:55,729 --> 01:18:55,739
they don't have to be contradictory but
 

3677
01:18:55,739 --> 01:18:57,410
they don't have to be contradictory but
you can have a can't you not have

3678
01:18:57,410 --> 01:18:57,420
you can have a can't you not have
 

3679
01:18:57,420 --> 01:18:59,750
you can have a can't you not have
mathematical objects that are not at all

3680
01:18:59,750 --> 01:18:59,760
mathematical objects that are not at all
 

3681
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:01,729
mathematical objects that are not at all
connected to the physical world so I

3682
01:19:01,729 --> 01:19:01,739
connected to the physical world so I
 

3683
01:19:01,739 --> 01:19:03,290
connected to the physical world so I
mean this is to the question of is math

3684
01:19:03,290 --> 01:19:03,300
mean this is to the question of is math
 

3685
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:05,270
mean this is to the question of is math
discovered or invented

3686
01:19:05,270 --> 01:19:05,280
discovered or invented
 

3687
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:08,209
discovered or invented
I said to you math is just discovered

3688
01:19:08,209 --> 01:19:08,219
I said to you math is just discovered
 

3689
01:19:08,219 --> 01:19:10,850
I said to you math is just discovered
and and and there's a deep linkage

3690
01:19:10,850 --> 01:19:10,860
and and and there's a deep linkage
 

3691
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:13,550
and and and there's a deep linkage
between the two yeah yeah yeah do you

3692
01:19:13,550 --> 01:19:13,560
between the two yeah yeah yeah do you
 

3693
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:16,130
between the two yeah yeah yeah do you
find it all compelling these ideas uh

3694
01:19:16,130 --> 01:19:16,140
find it all compelling these ideas uh
 

3695
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:18,649
find it all compelling these ideas uh
like something like Max tag Mark where

3696
01:19:18,649 --> 01:19:18,659
like something like Max tag Mark where
 

3697
01:19:18,659 --> 01:19:20,630
like something like Max tag Mark where
our universe is actually fundamentally a

3698
01:19:20,630 --> 01:19:20,640
our universe is actually fundamentally a
 

3699
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:22,310
our universe is actually fundamentally a
mathematical object

3700
01:19:22,310 --> 01:19:22,320
mathematical object
 

3701
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:24,590
mathematical object
that math is our universe is

3702
01:19:24,590 --> 01:19:24,600
that math is our universe is
 

3703
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:27,169
that math is our universe is
mathematical fundamentally mathematical

3704
01:19:27,169 --> 01:19:27,179
mathematical fundamentally mathematical
 

3705
01:19:27,179 --> 01:19:28,390
mathematical fundamentally mathematical
in nature

3706
01:19:28,390 --> 01:19:28,400
in nature
 

3707
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:33,830
in nature
my expertise is a a physicist doesn't

3708
01:19:33,830 --> 01:19:33,840
my expertise is a a physicist doesn't
 

3709
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:37,209
my expertise is a a physicist doesn't
add anything to that

3710
01:19:37,209 --> 01:19:37,219
add anything to that
 

3711
01:19:37,219 --> 01:19:40,610
add anything to that
it's not really you know physics is

3712
01:19:40,610 --> 01:19:40,620
it's not really you know physics is
 

3713
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:45,470
it's not really you know physics is
you know I was once very interested in

3714
01:19:45,470 --> 01:19:45,480

 

3715
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:48,229

philosophy and

3716
01:19:48,229 --> 01:19:48,239
philosophy and
 

3717
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:50,030
philosophy and
you know physics

3718
01:19:50,030 --> 01:19:50,040
you know physics
 

3719
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:51,530
you know physics
physics

3720
01:19:51,530 --> 01:19:51,540
physics
 

3721
01:19:51,540 --> 01:19:54,130
physics
I like questions that can be answered

3722
01:19:54,130 --> 01:19:54,140
I like questions that can be answered
 

3723
01:19:54,140 --> 01:19:57,169
I like questions that can be answered
that it's not obvious what the answer is

3724
01:19:57,169 --> 01:19:57,179
that it's not obvious what the answer is
 

3725
01:19:57,179 --> 01:19:59,870
that it's not obvious what the answer is
and that you can find a

3726
01:19:59,870 --> 01:19:59,880
and that you can find a
 

3727
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:02,090
and that you can find a
an answer to the question

3728
01:20:02,090 --> 01:20:02,100
an answer to the question
 

3729
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:04,550
an answer to the question
and everybody will agree

3730
01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:04,560
and everybody will agree
 

3731
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:07,189
and everybody will agree
what the answer is and that there's a an

3732
01:20:07,189 --> 01:20:07,199
what the answer is and that there's a an
 

3733
01:20:07,199 --> 01:20:10,250
what the answer is and that there's a an
algorithm for for getting there

3734
01:20:10,250 --> 01:20:10,260
algorithm for for getting there
 

3735
01:20:10,260 --> 01:20:12,050
algorithm for for getting there
um not that these other questions aren't

3736
01:20:12,050 --> 01:20:12,060
um not that these other questions aren't
 

3737
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:14,270
um not that these other questions aren't
interesting

3738
01:20:14,270 --> 01:20:14,280
interesting
 

3739
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:16,370
interesting
um and they don't somehow have a way of

3740
01:20:16,370 --> 01:20:16,380
um and they don't somehow have a way of
 

3741
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:19,490
um and they don't somehow have a way of
preventing presenting themselves but to

3742
01:20:19,490 --> 01:20:19,500
preventing presenting themselves but to
 

3743
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:22,669
preventing presenting themselves but to
me the interesting thing is to

3744
01:20:22,669 --> 01:20:22,679
me the interesting thing is to
 

3745
01:20:22,679 --> 01:20:26,570
me the interesting thing is to
is is motion in what we know is learning

3746
01:20:26,570 --> 01:20:26,580
is is motion in what we know is learning
 

3747
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:29,450
is is motion in what we know is learning
more and understanding things that we

3748
01:20:29,450 --> 01:20:29,460
more and understanding things that we
 

3749
01:20:29,460 --> 01:20:32,149
more and understanding things that we
didn't understanding before things that

3750
01:20:32,149 --> 01:20:32,159
didn't understanding before things that
 

3751
01:20:32,159 --> 01:20:34,550
didn't understanding before things that
seemed totally confusing having them

3752
01:20:34,550 --> 01:20:34,560
seemed totally confusing having them
 

3753
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:37,729
seemed totally confusing having them
seem obvious that's wonderful so

3754
01:20:37,729 --> 01:20:37,739
seem obvious that's wonderful so
 

3755
01:20:37,739 --> 01:20:39,890
seem obvious that's wonderful so
I think that's those questions are there

3756
01:20:39,890 --> 01:20:39,900
I think that's those questions are there
 

3757
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:41,750
I think that's those questions are there
I mean I would

3758
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:41,760
I mean I would
 

3759
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:44,030
I mean I would
even go further you know the whole

3760
01:20:44,030 --> 01:20:44,040
even go further you know the whole
 

3761
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:46,010
even go further you know the whole
Multiverse I don't

3762
01:20:46,010 --> 01:20:46,020
Multiverse I don't
 

3763
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:47,990
Multiverse I don't
I don't think there's too much we

3764
01:20:47,990 --> 01:20:48,000
I don't think there's too much we
 

3765
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,810
I don't think there's too much we
concrete we're ever going to be able to

3766
01:20:50,810 --> 01:20:50,820
concrete we're ever going to be able to
 

3767
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:53,570
concrete we're ever going to be able to
say about it this this is fascinating

3768
01:20:53,570 --> 01:20:53,580
say about it this this is fascinating
 

3769
01:20:53,580 --> 01:20:55,250
say about it this this is fascinating
because you spend so much time in string

3770
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:55,260
because you spend so much time in string
 

3771
01:20:55,260 --> 01:20:58,550
because you spend so much time in string
theory which is devoid from a connection

3772
01:20:58,550 --> 01:20:58,560
theory which is devoid from a connection
 

3773
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:00,770
theory which is devoid from a connection
to the physical world for a long time

3774
01:21:00,770 --> 01:21:00,780
to the physical world for a long time
 

3775
01:21:00,780 --> 01:21:03,649
to the physical world for a long time
like it did not devoid but it it travels

3776
01:21:03,649 --> 01:21:03,659
like it did not devoid but it it travels
 

3777
01:21:03,659 --> 01:21:05,390
like it did not devoid but it it travels
in a mathematical world that seems to be

3778
01:21:05,390 --> 01:21:05,400
in a mathematical world that seems to be
 

3779
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:07,550
in a mathematical world that seems to be
beautiful and consistent and seems to

3780
01:21:07,550 --> 01:21:07,560
beautiful and consistent and seems to
 

3781
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:11,930
beautiful and consistent and seems to
indicate uh that it could be a a good

3782
01:21:11,930 --> 01:21:11,940
indicate uh that it could be a a good
 

3783
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:14,390
indicate uh that it could be a a good
model of the laws of nature but there's

3784
01:21:14,390 --> 01:21:14,400
model of the laws of nature but there's
 

3785
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,729
model of the laws of nature but there's
it's still traveling independently

3786
01:21:16,729 --> 01:21:16,739
it's still traveling independently
 

3787
01:21:16,739 --> 01:21:18,110
it's still traveling independently
because it's very difficult to

3788
01:21:18,110 --> 01:21:18,120
because it's very difficult to
 

3789
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:20,209
because it's very difficult to
experimentally verify but there's a

3790
01:21:20,209 --> 01:21:20,219
experimentally verify but there's a
 

3791
01:21:20,219 --> 01:21:22,130
experimentally verify but there's a
promise with Laden in it in the same way

3792
01:21:22,130 --> 01:21:22,140
promise with Laden in it in the same way
 

3793
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:24,709

Multiverse or uh you can have a lot of

3794
01:21:24,709 --> 01:21:24,719
Multiverse or uh you can have a lot of
 

3795
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:27,890
Multiverse or uh you can have a lot of
kind of very far out there questions or

3796
01:21:27,890 --> 01:21:27,900
kind of very far out there questions or
 

3797
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:30,050
kind of very far out there questions or
your gut and Instinct and intuition says

your gut and Instinct and intuition says
 

3799
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:32,630
your gut and Instinct and intuition says
that maybe in 1500 200 years you'll be

3800
01:21:32,630 --> 01:21:32,640
that maybe in 1500 200 years you'll be
 

3801
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:34,630
that maybe in 1500 200 years you'll be
able to actually have strong

01:21:34,630 --> 01:21:34,640
able to actually have strong
 

3803
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:36,590

experimental validation

3804
01:21:36,590 --> 01:21:36,600
experimental validation
 

3805
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:37,850
experimental validation
right

3806
01:21:37,850 --> 01:21:37,860
right
 

3807
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:40,970
right
I think that with string theory

3808
01:21:40,970 --> 01:21:40,980
I think that with string theory
 

3809
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:42,950
I think that with string theory
um

3810
01:21:42,950 --> 01:21:42,960
um
 

3811
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:45,050
um
I don't think it's likely that we could

3812
01:21:45,050 --> 01:21:45,060
I don't think it's likely that we could
 

3813
01:21:45,060 --> 01:21:46,850
I don't think it's likely that we could
measure it

3814
01:21:46,850 --> 01:21:46,860
measure it
 

3815
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:50,330
measure it
but we could get lucky

3816
01:21:50,330 --> 01:21:50,340
but we could get lucky
 

3817
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:52,790
but we could get lucky
in other words just to take an example

3818
01:21:52,790 --> 01:21:52,800
in other words just to take an example
 

3819
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:56,090
in other words just to take an example
about 10 or 20 years ago it was thought

3820
01:21:56,090 --> 01:21:56,100
about 10 or 20 years ago it was thought
 

3821
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:59,270
about 10 or 20 years ago it was thought
that they had seen a string in the sky

3822
01:21:59,270 --> 01:21:59,280
that they had seen a string in the sky
 

3823
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:02,930
that they had seen a string in the sky
in it that it was seen by

01:22:02,930 --> 01:22:02,940
in it that it was seen by
 

3825
01:22:02,940 --> 01:22:03,770
in it that it was seen by
um

3826
01:22:03,770 --> 01:22:03,780
um
 

3827
01:22:03,780 --> 01:22:06,649
um
you know uh doubled stars that were

3828
01:22:06,649 --> 01:22:06,659
you know uh doubled stars that were
 

3829
01:22:06,659 --> 01:22:09,229
you know uh doubled stars that were
gravitationally lensed around the

3830
01:22:09,229 --> 01:22:09,239
gravitationally lensed around the
 

3831
01:22:09,239 --> 01:22:11,270
gravitationally lensed around the
gravitational field produced by some

01:22:13,020 --> 01:22:15,169
long string there was a line of double
instant now the signal went away okay

3836
01:22:15,169 --> 01:22:15,179
instant now the signal went away okay
 

3837
01:22:15,179 --> 01:22:17,209
instant now the signal went away okay
but

3838
01:22:17,209 --> 01:22:17,219
but
 

3839
01:22:17,219 --> 01:22:19,250
but
people were hoping that they'd seen a

3840
01:22:19,250 --> 01:22:19,260
people were hoping that they'd seen a
 

3841
01:22:19,260 --> 01:22:20,750
people were hoping that they'd seen a
string and it could be a fundamental

3842
01:22:20,750 --> 01:22:20,760
string and it could be a fundamental
 

3843
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:23,090
string and it could be a fundamental
string that it somehow gotten stretched

3844
01:22:23,090 --> 01:22:23,100
string that it somehow gotten stretched
 

3845
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:25,189
string that it somehow gotten stretched
and that would be some evidence for

3846
01:22:25,189 --> 01:22:25,199
and that would be some evidence for
 

3847
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:28,790
and that would be some evidence for
string theory there was also bicep two

3848
01:22:28,790 --> 01:22:28,800
string theory there was also bicep two
 

3849
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:31,490
string theory there was also bicep two
which

3850
01:22:31,490 --> 01:22:31,500
which
 

3851
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:34,669
which
it was a the experiment was wrong

3852
01:22:34,669 --> 01:22:34,679
it was a the experiment was wrong
 

3853
01:22:34,679 --> 01:22:37,790
it was a the experiment was wrong
but it could have happened

3854
01:22:37,790 --> 01:22:37,800
but it could have happened
 

3855
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:39,649
but it could have happened
it could have happened that we got lucky

3856
01:22:39,649 --> 01:22:39,659
it could have happened that we got lucky
 

3857
01:22:39,659 --> 01:22:41,810
it could have happened that we got lucky
and this experiment was able to make

3858
01:22:41,810 --> 01:22:41,820
and this experiment was able to make
 

3859
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:43,430
and this experiment was able to make
direct measurements

3860
01:22:43,430 --> 01:22:43,440
direct measurements
 

3861
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:45,050
direct measurements
certainly would have been measurements

3862
01:22:45,050 --> 01:22:45,060
certainly would have been measurements
 

3863
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:47,990
certainly would have been measurements
of quantum gravity if not string theory

3864
01:22:47,990 --> 01:22:48,000
of quantum gravity if not string theory
 

3865
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,149
of quantum gravity if not string theory
so it's a logical it's a very logical

3866
01:22:50,149 --> 01:22:50,159
so it's a logical it's a very logical
 

3867
01:22:50,159 --> 01:22:53,209
so it's a logical it's a very logical
possibility that we could get

3868
01:22:53,209 --> 01:22:53,219
possibility that we could get
 

3869
01:22:53,219 --> 01:22:55,490
possibility that we could get
experimental evidence from string that

3870
01:22:55,490 --> 01:22:55,500
experimental evidence from string that
 

3871
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:59,090
experimental evidence from string that
is a very different thing than saying do

3872
01:22:59,090 --> 01:22:59,100
is a very different thing than saying do
 

3873
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:01,729
is a very different thing than saying do
this experiment here's a billion dollars

3874
01:23:01,729 --> 01:23:01,739
this experiment here's a billion dollars
 

3875
01:23:01,739 --> 01:23:03,649
this experiment here's a billion dollars
and after you do it we'll know whether

3876
01:23:03,649 --> 01:23:03,659
and after you do it we'll know whether
 

3877
01:23:03,659 --> 01:23:05,330
and after you do it we'll know whether
or not strings are real

3878
01:23:05,330 --> 01:23:05,340
or not strings are real
 

3879
01:23:05,340 --> 01:23:08,450
or not strings are real
but I think it's a crucial difference

3880
01:23:08,450 --> 01:23:08,460
but I think it's a crucial difference
 

3881
01:23:08,460 --> 01:23:11,149
but I think it's a crucial difference
it's measurable in principle

3882
01:23:11,149 --> 01:23:11,159
it's measurable in principle
 

3883
01:23:11,159 --> 01:23:15,649
it's measurable in principle
and we don't see how to get

3884
01:23:15,649 --> 01:23:15,659
and we don't see how to get
 

3885
01:23:15,659 --> 01:23:18,830
and we don't see how to get
from here to there

3886
01:23:18,830 --> 01:23:18,840
from here to there
 

3887
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:21,709
from here to there
if we see how to get from here to there

3888
01:23:21,709 --> 01:23:21,719
if we see how to get from here to there
 

3889
01:23:21,719 --> 01:23:24,290
if we see how to get from here to there
in my eyes it's boring

3890
01:23:24,290 --> 01:23:24,300
in my eyes it's boring
 

3891
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:26,870
in my eyes it's boring
right so when I was a graduate student

3892
01:23:26,870 --> 01:23:26,880
right so when I was a graduate student
 

3893
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:31,970
right so when I was a graduate student
they knew how to measure the Higgs boson

3894
01:23:31,970 --> 01:23:31,980

 

3895
01:23:31,980 --> 01:23:33,590

took 40 years

3896
01:23:33,590 --> 01:23:33,600
took 40 years
 

3897
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:34,970
took 40 years
but

3898
01:23:34,970 --> 01:23:34,980
but
 

3899
01:23:34,980 --> 01:23:36,770
but
they did it

3900
01:23:36,770 --> 01:23:36,780
they did it
 

3901
01:23:36,780 --> 01:23:38,630
they did it
I not just say that stuff is boring I

3902
01:23:38,630 --> 01:23:38,640
I not just say that stuff is boring I
 

3903
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:41,030
I not just say that stuff is boring I
don't want to say that stuff yeah but I

3904
01:23:41,030 --> 01:23:41,040
don't want to say that stuff yeah but I
 

3905
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:43,610
don't want to say that stuff yeah but I
I you know you know would Magellan set

3906
01:23:43,610 --> 01:23:43,620
I you know you know would Magellan set
 

3907
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:44,450
I you know you know would Magellan set
out

3908
01:23:44,450 --> 01:23:44,460
out
 

3909
01:23:44,460 --> 01:23:46,130
out
he didn't know we could get around the

01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:52,850
there was no map you know so I don't

01:23:52,850 --> 01:23:52,860
know how we're gonna
 

3917
01:23:52,860 --> 01:23:54,410

um all these ideas of string theory to
 

3923
01:24:00,659 --> 01:24:02,750
um all these ideas of string theory to
the real world and you know when I

3924
01:24:02,750 --> 01:24:02,760
the real world and you know when I
 

3925
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:05,090
the real world and you know when I
started out in graduate school I said

3926
01:24:05,090 --> 01:24:05,100
started out in graduate school I said
 

3927
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:07,850
started out in graduate school I said
what is the what is the most interesting

3928
01:24:07,850 --> 01:24:07,860
what is the what is the most interesting
 

3929
01:24:07,860 --> 01:24:08,990
what is the what is the most interesting
problem

3930
01:24:08,990 --> 01:24:09,000
problem
 

3931
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,330

01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:13,189
that there might be the deepest most

progress on in 60 years

3936
01:24:17,590 --> 01:24:17,600
progress on in 60 years
 

3937
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,250
progress on in 60 years
and

3938
01:24:19,250 --> 01:24:19,260
and
 

3939
01:24:19,260 --> 01:24:24,590
and
I think it could be you know uh that you

3940
01:24:24,590 --> 01:24:24,600
I think it could be you know uh that you
 

3941
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:27,110
I think it could be you know uh that you
know in another 30 years that maybe

3942
01:24:27,110 --> 01:24:27,120
know in another 30 years that maybe
 

3943
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:30,110
know in another 30 years that maybe
we'll learn that uh we have understood

3944
01:24:30,110 --> 01:24:30,120
we'll learn that uh we have understood
 

3945
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:32,689
we'll learn that uh we have understood
how black holes store information you

3946
01:24:32,689 --> 01:24:32,699
how black holes store information you
 

3947
01:24:32,699 --> 01:24:36,410
how black holes store information you
know that doesn't seem wild that that

3948
01:24:36,410 --> 01:24:36,420
know that doesn't seem wild that that
 

3949
01:24:36,420 --> 01:24:38,270
know that doesn't seem wild that that
we're able to abstract what we learned

3950
01:24:38,270 --> 01:24:38,280
we're able to abstract what we learned
 

3951
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:40,669
we're able to abstract what we learned
from string theory and show that it's

3952
01:24:40,669 --> 01:24:40,679
from string theory and show that it's
 

3953
01:24:40,679 --> 01:24:44,570
from string theory and show that it's
operative and and and and and you know I

3954
01:24:44,570 --> 01:24:44,580
operative and and and and and you know I
 

3955
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:47,090
operative and and and and and you know I

3956
01:24:47,090 --> 01:24:47,100
mean the Bose Einstein condensate they
 

3957
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:48,830
mean the Bose Einstein condensate they
did you know they if you win Bose and

3958
01:24:48,830 --> 01:24:48,840
did you know they if you win Bose and
 

3959
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:50,930
did you know they if you win Bose and

uh predicted it when was that the 30s

3962
01:24:54,350 --> 01:24:54,360
uh predicted it when was that the 30s
 

3963
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:56,209
uh predicted it when was that the 30s
maybe early 30s

3964
01:24:56,209 --> 01:24:56,219
maybe early 30s
 

3965
01:24:56,219 --> 01:24:59,390
maybe early 30s
it took they were there were 20 orders

3966
01:24:59,390 --> 01:24:59,400
it took they were there were 20 orders
 

3967
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:01,550
it took they were there were 20 orders
of magnitude that were needed

3968
01:25:01,550 --> 01:25:01,560
of magnitude that were needed
 

3969
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:03,950
of magnitude that were needed
in order to Improvement in order to

3970
01:25:03,950 --> 01:25:03,960
in order to Improvement in order to
 

3971
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:05,209
in order to Improvement in order to
measure it

3972
01:25:05,209 --> 01:25:05,219
measure it
 

3973
01:25:05,219 --> 01:25:08,450
measure it
um and they did 50 years later

3974
01:25:08,450 --> 01:25:08,460
um and they did 50 years later
 

3975
01:25:08,460 --> 01:25:10,310
um and they did 50 years later
so and then you couldn't have guessed

3976
01:25:10,310 --> 01:25:10,320
so and then you couldn't have guessed
 

3977
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:13,070
so and then you couldn't have guessed
how that had happened how they could

3978
01:25:13,070 --> 01:25:13,080
how that had happened how they could
 

3979
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:14,570
how that had happened how they could
have gotten that

3980
01:25:14,570 --> 01:25:14,580
have gotten that
 

3981
01:25:14,580 --> 01:25:17,030
have gotten that
and it could happen that we I don't

3982
01:25:17,030 --> 01:25:17,040
and it could happen that we I don't
 

3983
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:18,830
and it could happen that we I don't
think we're gonna light

3984
01:25:18,830 --> 01:25:18,840
think we're gonna light
 

3985
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:21,410
think we're gonna light
see the heterotic string Spectrum in an

3986
01:25:21,410 --> 01:25:21,420
see the heterotic string Spectrum in an
 

3987
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:25,850
see the heterotic string Spectrum in an

01:25:25,850 --> 01:25:25,860
accelerator but but it could be that
 

3989
01:25:25,860 --> 01:25:29,570

things come around and and uh

3990
01:25:29,570 --> 01:25:29,580
things come around and and uh
 

3991
01:25:29,580 --> 01:25:31,970
things come around and and uh
in an interesting way and

3992
01:25:31,970 --> 01:25:31,980
in an interesting way and
 

3993
01:25:31,980 --> 01:25:33,649
in an interesting way and
somehow it comes together and the fact

3994
01:25:33,649 --> 01:25:33,659
somehow it comes together and the fact
 

3995
01:25:33,659 --> 01:25:36,770
somehow it comes together and the fact
that we can't see to the end

3996
01:25:36,770 --> 01:25:36,780
that we can't see to the end
 

3997
01:25:36,780 --> 01:25:40,070
that we can't see to the end
isn't a reason not to do it you know we

3998
01:25:40,070 --> 01:25:40,080
isn't a reason not to do it you know we
 

3999
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:42,229
isn't a reason not to do it you know we
just you know what did they do when they

4000
01:25:42,229 --> 01:25:42,239
just you know what did they do when they
 

4001
01:25:42,239 --> 01:25:44,750
just you know what did they do when they
were trying to find the Pacific right

4002
01:25:44,750 --> 01:25:44,760
were trying to find the Pacific right
 

4003
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:46,850
were trying to find the Pacific right
they just they took every route they

4004
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:46,860
they just they took every route they
 

4005
01:25:46,860 --> 01:25:48,649
they just they took every route they
just tried everything and that's what

4006
01:25:48,649 --> 01:25:48,659
just tried everything and that's what
 

4007
01:25:48,659 --> 01:25:51,290
just tried everything and that's what
we're doing and we're taking and I'm

4008
01:25:51,290 --> 01:25:51,300
we're doing and we're taking and I'm
 

4009
01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:54,709
we're doing and we're taking and I'm
taking the one that my nose tells me is

4010
01:25:54,709 --> 01:25:54,719
taking the one that my nose tells me is
 

4011
01:25:54,719 --> 01:25:56,930
taking the one that my nose tells me is
the best you know and other people are

4012
01:25:56,930 --> 01:25:56,940
the best you know and other people are
 

4013
01:25:56,940 --> 01:25:58,430
the best you know and other people are
taking other ones and that's good

4014
01:25:58,430 --> 01:25:58,440
taking other ones and that's good
 

4015
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:00,590
taking other ones and that's good
because we need every

4016
01:26:00,590 --> 01:26:00,600
because we need every
 

4017
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:03,189
because we need every
person taking every route

4018
01:26:03,189 --> 01:26:03,199
person taking every route

that's what I mean why some of the
 

4049

that's what I mean why some of the

01:27:00,110 --> 01:27:00,120
practically interesting topic but
 

4069
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:02,990
practically interesting topic but
there's also philosophers uh Sean

4070
01:27:02,990 --> 01:27:03,000
there's also philosophers uh Sean
 

4071
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,050
there's also philosophers uh Sean
Carroll loves to argue against them but

4072
01:27:06,050 --> 01:27:06,060
Carroll loves to argue against them but
 

4073
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:07,310
Carroll loves to argue against them but
there's the philosophers that are pen

4074
01:27:07,310 --> 01:27:07,320
there's the philosophers that are pen
 

4075
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:09,169
there's the philosophers that are pen
psychist I'm not against philosophers

4076
01:27:09,169 --> 01:27:09,179
psychist I'm not against philosophers
 

4077
01:27:09,179 --> 01:27:11,030
psychist I'm not against philosophers
it's just not as fun I don't it's not a

4078
01:27:11,030 --> 01:27:11,040
it's just not as fun I don't it's not a
 

4079
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:12,669
it's just not as fun I don't it's not a
fun right

4080
01:27:12,669 --> 01:27:12,679
fun right
 

4081
01:27:12,679 --> 01:27:16,370
fun right
but they they uh they start a little

4082
01:27:16,370 --> 01:27:16,380
but they they uh they start a little
 

4083
01:27:16,380 --> 01:27:20,090
but they they uh they start a little
flame of a fire going that some of those

4084
01:27:20,090 --> 01:27:20,100
flame of a fire going that some of those
 

4085
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:23,450
flame of a fire going that some of those
Flames I think eventually become physics

4086
01:27:23,450 --> 01:27:23,460
Flames I think eventually become physics
 

4087
01:27:23,460 --> 01:27:25,610
Flames I think eventually become physics
So eventually it becomes something that

4088
01:27:25,610 --> 01:27:25,620
So eventually it becomes something that
 

4089
01:27:25,620 --> 01:27:28,729
So eventually it becomes something that
we can really like having them around is

4090
01:27:28,729 --> 01:27:28,739
we can really like having them around is
 

4091
01:27:28,739 --> 01:27:30,229
we can really like having them around is
really important because you'll discover

4092
01:27:30,229 --> 01:27:30,239
really important because you'll discover
 

4093
01:27:30,239 --> 01:27:33,110
really important because you'll discover
something by modeling and exploring

4094
01:27:33,110 --> 01:27:33,120
something by modeling and exploring
 

4095
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:35,450
something by modeling and exploring
black holes it's really weird and having

4096
01:27:35,450 --> 01:27:35,460
black holes it's really weird and having
 

4097
01:27:35,460 --> 01:27:38,930
black holes it's really weird and having
these ideas around like the ideas of pan

4098
01:27:38,930 --> 01:27:38,940
these ideas around like the ideas of pan
 

4099
01:27:38,940 --> 01:27:41,209
these ideas around like the ideas of pan
psychists that Consciousness could be a

4100
01:27:41,209 --> 01:27:41,219
psychists that Consciousness could be a
 

4101
01:27:41,219 --> 01:27:43,490
psychists that Consciousness could be a
fundamental force of nature just even

4102
01:27:43,490 --> 01:27:43,500
fundamental force of nature just even
 

4103
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:45,470
fundamental force of nature just even
having that crazy idea swimming around

4104
01:27:45,470 --> 01:27:45,480
having that crazy idea swimming around
 

4105
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:47,750
having that crazy idea swimming around
in the background could really spark

4106
01:27:47,750 --> 01:27:47,760
in the background could really spark
 

4107
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:49,430
in the background could really spark
something where

4108
01:27:49,430 --> 01:27:49,440
something where
 

4109
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:50,870
something where
that you were missing something

4110
01:27:50,870 --> 01:27:50,880
that you were missing something
 

4111
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:52,209
that you were missing something
completely

4112
01:27:52,209 --> 01:27:52,219
completely
 

4113
01:27:52,219 --> 01:27:54,290
completely
and it's just that's where the

4114
01:27:54,290 --> 01:27:54,300
and it's just that's where the
 

4115
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:58,129
and it's just that's where the
philosophy done right I think is very

4116
01:27:58,129 --> 01:27:58,139
philosophy done right I think is very
 

4117
01:27:58,139 --> 01:28:00,110
philosophy done right I think is very
useful that's where even the you know

4118
01:28:00,110 --> 01:28:00,120
useful that's where even the you know
 

4119
01:28:00,120 --> 01:28:01,669
useful that's where even the you know
these thought experiments which is very

4120
01:28:01,669 --> 01:28:01,679
these thought experiments which is very
 

4121
01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:03,950
these thought experiments which is very
fun and sort of the the tech sci-fi

4122
01:28:03,950 --> 01:28:03,960
fun and sort of the the tech sci-fi
 

4123
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:07,090
fun and sort of the the tech sci-fi
world that we live in a simulation uh

4124
01:28:07,090 --> 01:28:07,100
world that we live in a simulation uh
 

4125
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:10,610
world that we live in a simulation uh
that you know taking a perspective of

4126
01:28:10,610 --> 01:28:10,620
that you know taking a perspective of
 

4127
01:28:10,620 --> 01:28:13,669
that you know taking a perspective of
the universe as a as a computer as a as

4128
01:28:13,669 --> 01:28:13,679
the universe as a as a computer as a as
 

4129
01:28:13,679 --> 01:28:15,169
the universe as a as a computer as a as
a computational system that process

4130
01:28:15,169 --> 01:28:15,179
a computational system that process
 

4131
01:28:15,179 --> 01:28:17,629
a computational system that process
information which is a pretty intuitive

4132
01:28:17,629 --> 01:28:17,639
information which is a pretty intuitive
 

4133
01:28:17,639 --> 01:28:19,970
information which is a pretty intuitive
notion but you can just even reframing

4134
01:28:19,970 --> 01:28:19,980
notion but you can just even reframing
 

4135
01:28:19,980 --> 01:28:21,890
notion but you can just even reframing
it that way for yourself could really

4136
01:28:21,890 --> 01:28:21,900
it that way for yourself could really
 

4137
01:28:21,900 --> 01:28:25,570
it that way for yourself could really
open up some different way of thinking

4138
01:28:25,570 --> 01:28:25,580
open up some different way of thinking
 

4139
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:28,310
open up some different way of thinking
and then you have

4140
01:28:28,310 --> 01:28:28,320
and then you have
 

4141
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:29,450
and then you have
I don't know if you're familiar with

4142
01:28:29,450 --> 01:28:29,460
I don't know if you're familiar with
 

4143
01:28:29,460 --> 01:28:31,490
I don't know if you're familiar with
Stephen wolfram's work of like cellular

4144
01:28:31,490 --> 01:28:31,500
Stephen wolfram's work of like cellular
 

4145
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:34,189
Stephen wolfram's work of like cellular
atom and complexity yeah I did a podcast

4146
01:28:34,189 --> 01:28:34,199
atom and complexity yeah I did a podcast
 

4147
01:28:34,199 --> 01:28:35,930
atom and complexity yeah I did a podcast
with Stephen Hey Stephen that's awesome

4148
01:28:35,930 --> 01:28:35,940
with Stephen Hey Stephen that's awesome
 

4149
01:28:35,940 --> 01:28:39,129
with Stephen Hey Stephen that's awesome
I I to me forget physics to get all that

4150
01:28:39,129 --> 01:28:39,139
I I to me forget physics to get all that
 

4151
01:28:39,139 --> 01:28:42,410
I I to me forget physics to get all that
uh cellular automata

4152
01:28:42,410 --> 01:28:42,420
uh cellular automata
 

4153
01:28:42,420 --> 01:28:44,270
uh cellular automata
make no sense they're so beautiful

4154
01:28:44,270 --> 01:28:44,280
make no sense they're so beautiful
 

4155
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:46,250
make no sense they're so beautiful
they're so like they're from simple

4156
01:28:46,250 --> 01:28:46,260
they're so like they're from simple
 

4157
01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:49,129
they're so like they're from simple
rules you can create complexity I I just

4158
01:28:49,129 --> 01:28:49,139
rules you can create complexity I I just
 

4159
01:28:49,139 --> 01:28:50,750
rules you can create complexity I I just
don't think you know he wrote a book A

4160
01:28:50,750 --> 01:28:50,760
don't think you know he wrote a book A
 

4161
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:53,270
don't think you know he wrote a book A
New Kind of Science

New Kind of Science
 

4163
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:54,129

um

4164
01:28:54,129 --> 01:28:54,139
um
 

4165
01:28:54,139 --> 01:28:57,050
um
basically hinting at which a lot of

4166
01:28:57,050 --> 01:28:57,060
basically hinting at which a lot of
 

4167
01:28:57,060 --> 01:28:58,850
basically hinting at which a lot of
people offended as like we don't have a

4168
01:28:58,850 --> 01:28:58,860
people offended as like we don't have a
 

4169
01:28:58,860 --> 01:29:01,189
people offended as like we don't have a
good way to talk about these objects we

4170
01:29:01,189 --> 01:29:01,199
good way to talk about these objects we
 

4171
01:29:01,199 --> 01:29:02,450
good way to talk about these objects we
don't we can't figure out what is

4172
01:29:02,450 --> 01:29:02,460
don't we can't figure out what is
 

4173
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:04,250
don't we can't figure out what is
happening here these simple these

4174
01:29:04,250 --> 01:29:04,260
happening here these simple these
 

4175
01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:05,870
happening here these simple these
trivial rules can create incredible

4176
01:29:05,870 --> 01:29:05,880
trivial rules can create incredible
 

4177
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:07,669
trivial rules can create incredible
complexity all right he's totally right

4178
01:29:07,669 --> 01:29:07,679
complexity all right he's totally right
 

4179
01:29:07,679 --> 01:29:09,350
complexity all right he's totally right
about that yeah

4180
01:29:09,350 --> 01:29:09,360
about that yeah
 

4181
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:12,229
about that yeah
and I and physicists I guess don't have

4182
01:29:12,229 --> 01:29:12,239
and I and physicists I guess don't have
 

4183
01:29:12,239 --> 01:29:14,209
and I and physicists I guess don't have
don't know what to do with that

4184
01:29:14,209 --> 01:29:14,219
don't know what to do with that
 

4185
01:29:14,219 --> 01:29:16,070
don't know what to do with that
don't know do with cellular automata

4186
01:29:16,070 --> 01:29:16,080
don't know do with cellular automata
 

4187
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:18,290
don't know do with cellular automata
because you can describe the simple

4188
01:29:18,290 --> 01:29:18,300
because you can describe the simple
 

4189
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:20,750
because you can describe the simple
rules that will govern the system but

4190
01:29:20,750 --> 01:29:20,760
rules that will govern the system but
 

4191
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:23,330
rules that will govern the system but
how complexity can emerge like

4192
01:29:23,330 --> 01:29:23,340
how complexity can emerge like
 

4193
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:26,330
how complexity can emerge like
incredible complexity yeah

4194
01:29:26,330 --> 01:29:26,340
incredible complexity yeah
 

4195
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:28,370
incredible complexity yeah
of course wolfram's version of that is

4196
01:29:28,370 --> 01:29:28,380
of course wolfram's version of that is
 

4197
01:29:28,380 --> 01:29:30,169
of course wolfram's version of that is
that physicists will never be able to

4198
01:29:30,169 --> 01:29:30,179
that physicists will never be able to
 

4199
01:29:30,179 --> 01:29:33,290
that physicists will never be able to
describe it right yeah exactly he tries

4200
01:29:33,290 --> 01:29:33,300
describe it right yeah exactly he tries
 

4201
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:35,629
describe it right yeah exactly he tries
to prove that it's impossible what do

4202
01:29:35,629 --> 01:29:35,639
to prove that it's impossible what do
 

4203
01:29:35,639 --> 01:29:36,890
to prove that it's impossible what do
you make of that what do you what do you

4204
01:29:36,890 --> 01:29:36,900
you make of that what do you what do you
 

4205
01:29:36,900 --> 01:29:39,229
you make of that what do you what do you
uh what do you make about the tension of

4206
01:29:39,229 --> 01:29:39,239
uh what do you make about the tension of
 

4207
01:29:39,239 --> 01:29:42,649
uh what do you make about the tension of
being a physicist and potentially not

4208
01:29:42,649 --> 01:29:42,659
being a physicist and potentially not
 

4209
01:29:42,659 --> 01:29:44,629
being a physicist and potentially not
being able to it's like a Freud or

4210
01:29:44,629 --> 01:29:44,639
being able to it's like a Freud or
 

4211
01:29:44,639 --> 01:29:47,510
being able to it's like a Freud or
somebody that maybe uh Sigmund Freud

4212
01:29:47,510 --> 01:29:47,520
somebody that maybe uh Sigmund Freud
 

4213
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:49,189
somebody that maybe uh Sigmund Freud
maybe you'll never be able to actually

4214
01:29:49,189 --> 01:29:49,199
maybe you'll never be able to actually
 

4215
01:29:49,199 --> 01:29:51,169
maybe you'll never be able to actually
describe the human psyche

4216
01:29:51,169 --> 01:29:51,179
describe the human psyche
 

4217
01:29:51,179 --> 01:29:54,410
describe the human psyche
uh is that a possibility for you that

4218
01:29:54,410 --> 01:29:54,420
uh is that a possibility for you that
 

4219
01:29:54,420 --> 01:29:55,729
uh is that a possibility for you that
you will never be able to get to the

4220
01:29:55,729 --> 01:29:55,739
you will never be able to get to the
 

4221
01:29:55,739 --> 01:29:58,189
you will never be able to get to the
core fundamental description of the laws

4222
01:29:58,189 --> 01:29:58,199
core fundamental description of the laws
 

4223
01:29:58,199 --> 01:30:01,250
core fundamental description of the laws
of nature

4224
01:30:01,250 --> 01:30:01,260

 

4225
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:03,890

yeah so I had this conversation with

4226
01:30:03,890 --> 01:30:03,900
yeah so I had this conversation with
 

4227
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:06,729
yeah so I had this conversation with
Weinberg

4228
01:30:06,729 --> 01:30:06,739

 

4229
01:30:06,739 --> 01:30:10,550

yeah how'd it go

4230
01:30:10,550 --> 01:30:10,560
yeah how'd it go
 

4231
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:13,790
yeah how'd it go
so Weinberg has this book called dreams

4232
01:30:13,790 --> 01:30:13,800
so Weinberg has this book called dreams
 

4233
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:16,129
so Weinberg has this book called dreams
of a final Theory yeah

4234
01:30:16,129 --> 01:30:16,139
of a final Theory yeah
 

4235
01:30:16,139 --> 01:30:18,350
of a final Theory yeah
and I had this conversation with him I

4236
01:30:18,350 --> 01:30:18,360
and I had this conversation with him I
 

4237
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:19,070
and I had this conversation with him I
said

4238
01:30:19,070 --> 01:30:19,080
said
 

4239
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:21,470
said
why do you think

4240
01:30:21,470 --> 01:30:21,480
why do you think
 

4241
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:23,030
why do you think
um there's ever going to be a final

4242
01:30:23,030 --> 01:30:23,040
um there's ever going to be a final
 

4243
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:25,070
um there's ever going to be a final
Theory why should there ever be a final

4244
01:30:25,070 --> 01:30:25,080
Theory why should there ever be a final
 

4245
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:26,810
Theory why should there ever be a final
Theory I mean what does that mean do

4246
01:30:26,810 --> 01:30:26,820
Theory I mean what does that mean do
 

4247
01:30:26,820 --> 01:30:28,729
Theory I mean what does that mean do
physics departments shut down we've

4248
01:30:28,729 --> 01:30:28,739
physics departments shut down we've
 

4249
01:30:28,739 --> 01:30:30,649
physics departments shut down we've
solved everything

4250
01:30:30,649 --> 01:30:30,659
solved everything
 

4251
01:30:30,659 --> 01:30:35,149
solved everything
um and you know what is it doesn't it

4252
01:30:35,149 --> 01:30:35,159
um and you know what is it doesn't it
 

4253
01:30:35,159 --> 01:30:37,129
um and you know what is it doesn't it
seem that every time we answer some old

4254
01:30:37,129 --> 01:30:37,139
seem that every time we answer some old
 

4255
01:30:37,139 --> 01:30:38,629
seem that every time we answer some old
questions we'll

4256
01:30:38,629 --> 01:30:38,639
questions we'll
 

4257
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:40,669
questions we'll
we'll just find new ones and that will

4258
01:30:40,669 --> 01:30:40,679
we'll just find new ones and that will
 

4259
01:30:40,679 --> 01:30:43,070
we'll just find new ones and that will
just keep going on forever and ever

4260
01:30:43,070 --> 01:30:43,080
just keep going on forever and ever
 

4261
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:44,450
just keep going on forever and ever
he said well

4262
01:30:44,450 --> 01:30:44,460
he said well
 

4263
01:30:44,460 --> 01:30:46,070
he said well
that's what they used to say about the

4264
01:30:46,070 --> 01:30:46,080
that's what they used to say about the
 

4265
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:47,810
that's what they used to say about the
Nile they were never going to find the

4266
01:30:47,810 --> 01:30:47,820
Nile they were never going to find the
 

4267
01:30:47,820 --> 01:30:51,169
Nile they were never going to find the
end

4268
01:30:51,169 --> 01:30:51,179

 

4269
01:30:51,179 --> 01:30:54,290

and one day they found it yeah so I

4270
01:30:54,290 --> 01:30:54,300
and one day they found it yeah so I
 

4271
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:56,149
and one day they found it yeah so I
don't I don't know

4272
01:30:56,149 --> 01:30:56,159
don't I don't know
 

4273
01:30:56,159 --> 01:31:00,050
don't I don't know
um String Theory doesn't

4274
01:31:00,050 --> 01:31:00,060
um String Theory doesn't
 

4275
01:31:00,060 --> 01:31:02,149
um String Theory doesn't
String Theory doesn't look like a

4276
01:31:02,149 --> 01:31:02,159
String Theory doesn't look like a
 

4277
01:31:02,159 --> 01:31:06,530
String Theory doesn't look like a
candidate to me for a final Theory it

4278
01:31:06,530 --> 01:31:06,540
candidate to me for a final Theory it
 

4279
01:31:06,540 --> 01:31:09,050
candidate to me for a final Theory it
as it stands now it doesn't get to the

4280
01:31:09,050 --> 01:31:09,060
as it stands now it doesn't get to the
 

4281
01:31:09,060 --> 01:31:10,689
as it stands now it doesn't get to the
bottom of the world

4282
01:31:10,689 --> 01:31:10,699
bottom of the world
 

4283
01:31:10,699 --> 01:31:13,790
bottom of the world
yeah it seems to me that even if we kind

4284
01:31:13,790 --> 01:31:13,800
yeah it seems to me that even if we kind
 

4285
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:15,830
yeah it seems to me that even if we kind
of solved it and we've

4286
01:31:15,830 --> 01:31:15,840
of solved it and we've
 

4287
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:17,990
of solved it and we've
did experiments there still would be

4288
01:31:17,990 --> 01:31:18,000
did experiments there still would be
 

4289
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,970
did experiments there still would be
more questions like why are there four

4290
01:31:19,970 --> 01:31:19,980
more questions like why are there four
 

4291
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:22,250
more questions like why are there four
dimensions instead of six it doesn't

4292
01:31:22,250 --> 01:31:22,260
dimensions instead of six it doesn't
 

4293
01:31:22,260 --> 01:31:24,709
dimensions instead of six it doesn't
seem to have any anything that in it

4294
01:31:24,709 --> 01:31:24,719
seem to have any anything that in it
 

4295
01:31:24,719 --> 01:31:27,530
seem to have any anything that in it
that would explain that you could you

4296
01:31:27,530 --> 01:31:27,540
that would explain that you could you
 

4297
01:31:27,540 --> 01:31:29,450
that would explain that you could you
can always hope you know that there's

4298
01:31:29,450 --> 01:31:29,460
can always hope you know that there's
 

4299
01:31:29,460 --> 01:31:30,470
can always hope you know that there's
something that we don't know about

4300
01:31:30,470 --> 01:31:30,480
something that we don't know about
 

4301
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:32,270
something that we don't know about
string theory that we'll explain it but

4302
01:31:32,270 --> 01:31:32,280
string theory that we'll explain it but
 

4303
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:35,090
string theory that we'll explain it but
but it but it still doesn't look like

4304
01:31:35,090 --> 01:31:35,100
but it but it still doesn't look like
 

4305
01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:37,550
but it but it still doesn't look like
it's going to answer every question

4306
01:31:37,550 --> 01:31:37,560
it's going to answer every question
 

4307
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:39,649
it's going to answer every question
and um

4308
01:31:39,649 --> 01:31:39,659
and um
 

4309
01:31:39,659 --> 01:31:42,590
and um
why is there one time not two you know

4310
01:31:42,590 --> 01:31:42,600
why is there one time not two you know
 

4311
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:45,290
why is there one time not two you know
why is this but you know it doesn't seem

4312
01:31:45,290 --> 01:31:45,300
why is this but you know it doesn't seem
 

4313
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:46,790
why is this but you know it doesn't seem
like it's

4314
01:31:46,790 --> 01:31:46,800
like it's
 

4315
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:48,649
like it's
I don't even know what it would mean to

4316
01:31:48,649 --> 01:31:48,659
I don't even know what it would mean to
 

4317
01:31:48,659 --> 01:31:50,930
I don't even know what it would mean to
answer every question but to answer

4318
01:31:50,930 --> 01:31:50,940
answer every question but to answer
 

4319
01:31:50,940 --> 01:31:53,270
answer every question but to answer
every question obviously so when you

4320
01:31:53,270 --> 01:31:53,280
every question obviously so when you
 

4321
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:55,370
every question obviously so when you
refer to The Theory of Everything

4322
01:31:55,370 --> 01:31:55,380
refer to The Theory of Everything
 

4323
01:31:55,380 --> 01:31:58,129
refer to The Theory of Everything
you'll be able to have a

4324
01:31:58,129 --> 01:31:58,139
you'll be able to have a
 

4325
01:31:58,139 --> 01:31:59,990
you'll be able to have a
if it exists

4326
01:31:59,990 --> 01:32:00,000
if it exists
 

4327
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,729
if it exists
it would be a theory that allows you to

4328
01:32:01,729 --> 01:32:01,739
it would be a theory that allows you to
 

4329
01:32:01,739 --> 01:32:05,030
it would be a theory that allows you to
predict precisely the the behavior of

4330
01:32:05,030 --> 01:32:05,040
predict precisely the the behavior of
 

4331
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:07,189
predict precisely the the behavior of
objects in the universe and their their

4332
01:32:07,189 --> 01:32:07,199
objects in the universe and their their
 

4333
01:32:07,199 --> 01:32:10,189
objects in the universe and their their
movement right what what about them

4334
01:32:10,189 --> 01:32:10,199
movement right what what about them
 

4335
01:32:10,199 --> 01:32:11,570
movement right what what about them
their movement

4336
01:32:11,570 --> 01:32:11,580
their movement
 

4337
01:32:11,580 --> 01:32:14,209
their movement
yeah like like precisely no matter the

4338
01:32:14,209 --> 01:32:14,219
yeah like like precisely no matter the
 

4339
01:32:14,219 --> 01:32:16,310
yeah like like precisely no matter the
option right that's true so so that

4340
01:32:16,310 --> 01:32:16,320
option right that's true so so that
 

4341
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:18,470
option right that's true so so that
would be a really interesting State of

4342
01:32:18,470 --> 01:32:18,480
would be a really interesting State of
 

4343
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:19,910
would be a really interesting State of
Affairs

4344
01:32:19,910 --> 01:32:19,920
Affairs
 

4345
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:22,850
Affairs
if we could predict everything

4346
01:32:22,850 --> 01:32:22,860
if we could predict everything
 

4347
01:32:22,860 --> 01:32:25,310
if we could predict everything
but not necessarily understand

4348
01:32:25,310 --> 01:32:25,320
but not necessarily understand
 

4349
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:27,169
but not necessarily understand
everything

4350
01:32:27,169 --> 01:32:27,179
everything
 

4351
01:32:27,179 --> 01:32:29,149
everything
so for example

4352
01:32:29,149 --> 01:32:29,159
so for example
 

4353
01:32:29,159 --> 01:32:31,310
so for example
let's just forget about gravity I mean

4354
01:32:31,310 --> 01:32:31,320
let's just forget about gravity I mean
 

4355
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:34,310
let's just forget about gravity I mean
we're not too far from that situation if

4356
01:32:34,310 --> 01:32:34,320
we're not too far from that situation if
 

4357
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:36,770
we're not too far from that situation if
we forget about gravity the standard

4358
01:32:36,770 --> 01:32:36,780
we forget about gravity the standard
 

4359
01:32:36,780 --> 01:32:38,090
we forget about gravity the standard

4360
01:32:38,090 --> 01:32:38,100

in principle given a big enough computer

4362
01:32:42,169 --> 01:32:42,179
in principle given a big enough computer

01:32:42,179 --> 01:32:45,110
in principle given a big enough computer
predicts almost everything

4364
01:32:45,110 --> 01:32:45,120
predicts almost everything
 

4365
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:46,910
predicts almost everything
but

4366
01:32:46,910 --> 01:32:46,920
but
 

4367
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:49,610
but
if you look at the standard model it's

4368
01:32:49,610 --> 01:32:49,620
if you look at the standard model it's
 

4369
01:32:49,620 --> 01:32:51,410
if you look at the standard model it's
kind of a laundry list with neutrino

4370
01:32:51,410 --> 01:32:51,420
kind of a laundry list with neutrino
 

4371
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:53,209
kind of a laundry list with neutrino
masses and all that stuff they're

4372
01:32:53,209 --> 01:32:53,219
masses and all that stuff they're
 

4373
01:32:53,219 --> 01:32:54,950
masses and all that stuff they're
they're hundreds of free parameters

4374
01:32:54,950 --> 01:32:54,960
they're hundreds of free parameters
 

4375
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:57,590
they're hundreds of free parameters
where do they come from

4376
01:32:57,590 --> 01:32:57,600
where do they come from
 

4377
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:00,290
where do they come from
is there an organizing principle

4378
01:33:00,290 --> 01:33:00,300
is there an organizing principle
 

4379
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:02,870
is there an organizing principle
is there some further unification sure

4380
01:33:02,870 --> 01:33:02,880
is there some further unification sure
 

4381
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:06,290
is there some further unification sure
so so being able to predict

4382
01:33:06,290 --> 01:33:06,300
so so being able to predict
 

4383
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:09,470
so so being able to predict
uh everything is not the only goal that

4384
01:33:09,470 --> 01:33:09,480
uh everything is not the only goal that
 

4385
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:11,629
uh everything is not the only goal that
physicists have

4386
01:33:11,629 --> 01:33:11,639
physicists have
 

4387
01:33:11,639 --> 01:33:13,370
physicists have
so on the way to trying to predict

4388
01:33:13,370 --> 01:33:13,380
so on the way to trying to predict
 

4389
01:33:13,380 --> 01:33:14,570
so on the way to trying to predict
you're trying to understand that's

4390
01:33:14,570 --> 01:33:14,580
you're trying to understand that's
 

4391
01:33:14,580 --> 01:33:15,830
you're trying to understand that's
actually probably the goal is to

4392
01:33:15,830 --> 01:33:15,840
actually probably the goal is to
 

4393
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:17,510
actually probably the goal is to
understand yeah

4394
01:33:17,510 --> 01:33:17,520
understand yeah
 

4395
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:19,970
understand yeah
but but but right we're more interested

4396
01:33:19,970 --> 01:33:19,980
but but but right we're more interested
 

4397
01:33:19,980 --> 01:33:22,689
but but but right we're more interested
in understanding than actually

4398
01:33:22,689 --> 01:33:22,699
in understanding than actually
 

4399
01:33:22,699 --> 01:33:25,310
in understanding than actually
than actually doing the predictions but

4400
01:33:25,310 --> 01:33:25,320
than actually doing the predictions but
 

4401
01:33:25,320 --> 01:33:27,169
than actually doing the predictions but
the predictions are more

4402
01:33:27,169 --> 01:33:27,179
the predictions are more
 

4403
01:33:27,179 --> 01:33:30,530
the predictions are more
focusing on how to make predictions is a

4404
01:33:30,530 --> 01:33:30,540
focusing on how to make predictions is a
 

4405
01:33:30,540 --> 01:33:33,590
focusing on how to make predictions is a
good way to improve your understanding

4406
01:33:33,590 --> 01:33:33,600
good way to improve your understanding
 

4407
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:35,390
good way to improve your understanding
because you know you've understood it if

4408
01:33:35,390 --> 01:33:35,400
because you know you've understood it if
 

4409
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:37,070
because you know you've understood it if
you could do the predictions yeah one of

4410
01:33:37,070 --> 01:33:37,080
you could do the predictions yeah one of
 

4411
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:38,570
you could do the predictions yeah one of
the interesting

4412
01:33:38,570 --> 01:33:38,580
the interesting
 

4413
01:33:38,580 --> 01:33:41,090
the interesting
things that might come to a head with is

4414
01:33:41,090 --> 01:33:41,100
things that might come to a head with is
 

4415
01:33:41,100 --> 01:33:43,729
things that might come to a head with is
our artificial intelligence there's an

4416
01:33:43,729 --> 01:33:43,739
our artificial intelligence there's an
 

4417
01:33:43,739 --> 01:33:48,110
our artificial intelligence there's an
increasing use of AI in in physics we

4418
01:33:48,110 --> 01:33:48,120
increasing use of AI in in physics we
 

4419
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:50,689
increasing use of AI in in physics we
might live in a world where AI would be

4420
01:33:50,689 --> 01:33:50,699
might live in a world where AI would be
 

4421
01:33:50,699 --> 01:33:52,189
might live in a world where AI would be
able to predict perfectly what's

4422
01:33:52,189 --> 01:33:52,199
able to predict perfectly what's
 

4423
01:33:52,199 --> 01:33:56,270
able to predict perfectly what's
happening and so that will as physicists

4424
01:33:56,270 --> 01:33:56,280
happening and so that will as physicists
 

4425
01:33:56,280 --> 01:33:59,330
happening and so that will as physicists
you'll have to come to to the fact that

4426
01:33:59,330 --> 01:33:59,340
you'll have to come to to the fact that
 

4427
01:33:59,340 --> 01:34:00,890
you'll have to come to to the fact that
you're actually not that interested in

4428
01:34:00,890 --> 01:34:00,900
you're actually not that interested in
 

4429
01:34:00,900 --> 01:34:02,030
you're actually not that interested in
prediction

4430
01:34:02,030 --> 01:34:02,040
prediction
 

4431
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:04,490
prediction
I mean it's very useful but you're

4432
01:34:04,490 --> 01:34:04,500
I mean it's very useful but you're
 

4433
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:05,629
I mean it's very useful but you're
interested in really understanding the

4434
01:34:05,629 --> 01:34:05,639
interested in really understanding the
 

4435
01:34:05,639 --> 01:34:07,550
interested in really understanding the
Deep laws of nature versus a perfect

Deep laws of nature versus a perfect
 

4437
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:09,350
Deep laws of nature versus a perfect
predictor yeah like uh you want to play

Just within AI yeah AI people are trying

4440
01:34:12,649 --> 01:34:12,659
Just within AI yeah AI people are trying
 

4441
01:34:12,659 --> 01:34:14,149
Just within AI yeah AI people are trying
to understand

4442
01:34:14,149 --> 01:34:14,159
to understand
 

4443
01:34:14,159 --> 01:34:16,729
to understand
what it is that the AI Bots have learned

01:34:16,729 --> 01:34:16,739
what it is that the AI Bots have learned
 

4445
01:34:16,739 --> 01:34:20,090
what it is that the AI Bots have learned
in order to

produce whatever they produce for sure
 

4449
01:34:22,380 --> 01:34:24,169
produce whatever they produce for sure
but you still don't understand deeply

4450
01:34:24,169 --> 01:34:24,179
but you still don't understand deeply
 

4451
01:34:24,179 --> 01:34:26,450
but you still don't understand deeply
especially because they're getting

they're trained on the internet they
 

4467
01:34:40,679 --> 01:34:44,870
they're trained on the internet they
seem to be very very good at uh

seem to be very very good at uh
 

4469
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:46,250
seem to be very very good at uh
something that looks like reasoning

4470
01:34:46,250 --> 01:34:46,260
something that looks like reasoning

it just feels like this thing is

4476
01:34:51,649 --> 01:34:51,659
it just feels like this thing is
 

4477
01:34:51,659 --> 01:34:54,530
it just feels like this thing is
intelligent right uh and I could just

4478
01:34:54,530 --> 01:34:54,540
intelligent right uh and I could just
 

4479
01:34:54,540 --> 01:34:56,750
intelligent right uh and I could just
see that being possible with physics you

4480
01:34:56,750 --> 01:34:56,760
see that being possible with physics you
 

4481
01:34:56,760 --> 01:34:58,430
see that being possible with physics you
ask any kind of physical question and

4482
01:34:58,430 --> 01:34:58,440
ask any kind of physical question and
 

4483
01:34:58,440 --> 01:35:00,830
ask any kind of physical question and
it'll be able to very precise about a

4484
01:35:00,830 --> 01:35:00,840
it'll be able to very precise about a
 

4485
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:02,510
it'll be able to very precise about a
particular star system or a particular

4486
01:35:02,510 --> 01:35:02,520
particular star system or a particular
 

4487
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:04,189
particular star system or a particular
black hole you'll say well these are the

4488
01:35:04,189 --> 01:35:04,199
black hole you'll say well these are the
 

4489
01:35:04,199 --> 01:35:07,010
black hole you'll say well these are the
numbers it's it'll perfectly predict

01:35:07,010 --> 01:35:07,020
numbers it's it'll perfectly predict
 

4491
01:35:07,020 --> 01:35:10,189
numbers it's it'll perfectly predict
and then sure you can understand

4492
01:35:10,189 --> 01:35:10,199
and then sure you can understand
 

4493
01:35:10,199 --> 01:35:12,770
and then sure you can understand
uh how the neural network is the

4494
01:35:12,770 --> 01:35:12,780
uh how the neural network is the
 

4495
01:35:12,780 --> 01:35:14,510
uh how the neural network is the
architecture is structured actually for

4496
01:35:14,510 --> 01:35:14,520
architecture is structured actually for
 

4497
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:16,490
architecture is structured actually for
most of them now they're very simple you

4498
01:35:16,490 --> 01:35:16,500
most of them now they're very simple you
 

4499
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:18,169
most of them now they're very simple you
can understand what data is trained on

4500
01:35:18,169 --> 01:35:18,179
can understand what data is trained on
 

4501
01:35:18,179 --> 01:35:20,209
can understand what data is trained on
huge amount of data you're giving a huge

4502
01:35:20,209 --> 01:35:20,219
huge amount of data you're giving a huge
 

4503
01:35:20,219 --> 01:35:21,229
huge amount of data you're giving a huge
amount of data from a very nice

4504
01:35:21,229 --> 01:35:21,239
amount of data from a very nice
 

4505
01:35:21,239 --> 01:35:23,030
amount of data from a very nice
telescope or something

01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:25,370
telescope or something
and then but it seems to predict

01:35:25,370 --> 01:35:25,380
and then but it seems to predict
 

4509
01:35:25,380 --> 01:35:28,010
and then but it seems to predict
everything perfectly you know how a

everything is perfectly predicted you
 

4515
01:35:32,639 --> 01:35:34,189
everything is perfectly predicted you
still don't have a deep understanding of

um
 

4521
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:38,689

01:35:43,430 --> 01:35:43,440
to the Galaxy type answer uh that you
 

4527
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:46,729
to the Galaxy type answer uh that you
know it's a funny world uh we live in of

4528
01:35:46,729 --> 01:35:46,739
know it's a funny world uh we live in of
 

4529
01:35:46,739 --> 01:35:48,110
know it's a funny world uh we live in of
course it's also possible that there's

4530
01:35:48,110 --> 01:35:48,120
course it's also possible that there's
 

4531
01:35:48,120 --> 01:35:51,530
course it's also possible that there's
no such deep simple governing laws of

behind the whole thing I mean you
 

4537
01:35:55,260 --> 01:35:57,470
behind the whole thing I mean you
there's something in US humans it's

there's something in US humans it's
possible that wants it there to be yeah

it doesn't have to be right right I do
what's where do you again you're betting

4544
01:36:04,790 --> 01:36:04,800
what's where do you again you're betting
 

4545
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:07,010
what's where do you again you're betting
the you already bet the farm but if you

4546
01:36:07,010 --> 01:36:07,020
the you already bet the farm but if you
 

4547
01:36:07,020 --> 01:36:08,450
the you already bet the farm but if you
were to have a second Farm

4548
01:36:08,450 --> 01:36:08,460
were to have a second Farm
 

4549
01:36:08,460 --> 01:36:09,950
were to have a second Farm
do you think there is a theory of

4550
01:36:09,950 --> 01:36:09,960
do you think there is a theory of
 

4551
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:11,990
do you think there is a theory of
everything that we might get at so

4552
01:36:11,990 --> 01:36:12,000
everything that we might get at so
 

4553
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:15,350
everything that we might get at so
um simple laws in the whole thing

4554
01:36:15,350 --> 01:36:15,360
um simple laws in the whole thing
 

4555
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:17,990
um simple laws in the whole thing
I don't I don't

4556
01:36:17,990 --> 01:36:18,000
I don't I don't
 

4557
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:22,610
I don't I don't
I I honestly I I don't know but I'm

4558
01:36:22,610 --> 01:36:22,620
I I honestly I I don't know but I'm
 

4559
01:36:22,620 --> 01:36:25,250
I I honestly I I don't know but I'm
pretty confident that if there is

4560
01:36:25,250 --> 01:36:25,260
pretty confident that if there is
 

4561
01:36:25,260 --> 01:36:28,370
pretty confident that if there is
we won't get to it in my lifetime

4562
01:36:28,370 --> 01:36:28,380
we won't get to it in my lifetime
 

4563
01:36:28,380 --> 01:36:30,530
we won't get to it in my lifetime
I don't think we're near it but doesn't

4564
01:36:30,530 --> 01:36:30,540
I don't think we're near it but doesn't
 

4565
01:36:30,540 --> 01:36:32,270
I don't think we're near it but doesn't
it feel like they're like the fact that

4566
01:36:32,270 --> 01:36:32,280
it feel like they're like the fact that
 

4567
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:34,189
it feel like they're like the fact that
we have the laws we do they're

4568
01:36:34,189 --> 01:36:34,199
we have the laws we do they're
 

4569
01:36:34,199 --> 01:36:36,110
we have the laws we do they're
relatively simple already

01:36:36,120 --> 01:36:37,910
relatively simple already
that's kind of incredible it's just

01:36:37,910 --> 01:36:37,920
that's kind of incredible it's just
 

4573
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:40,070
that's kind of incredible it's just

so for me it would be a sad day

4592
01:37:00,950 --> 01:37:00,960
so for me it would be a sad day
 

4593
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:03,290
so for me it would be a sad day
if we arrived at that

4594
01:37:03,290 --> 01:37:03,300
if we arrived at that
 

4595
01:37:03,300 --> 01:37:07,370
if we arrived at that
without answering some deeper questions

01:37:09,350 --> 01:37:09,360
sure of course it definitely is but the

question yes
 

4601
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:14,090
question yes
but one of the questions before we

but one of the questions before we
 

4603
01:37:14,100 --> 01:37:16,010
but one of the questions before we

arrive there we're going to ask does

arrive there we're going to ask does
such a destination even exist so because

4606
01:37:19,689 --> 01:37:19,699
such a destination even exist so because

01:37:19,699 --> 01:37:22,370
such a destination even exist so because
the asking the question and the possible

answers and the process of trying to
 

4611
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,570
answers and the process of trying to
answer that question is in itself super

4612
01:37:26,570 --> 01:37:26,580
answer that question is in itself super
 

4613
01:37:26,580 --> 01:37:29,570
answer that question is in itself super
interesting is that is is it is even

4614
01:37:29,570 --> 01:37:29,580
interesting is that is is it is even
 

4615
01:37:29,580 --> 01:37:31,610
interesting is that is is it is even
possible to get there well there's an

parameters but

can predict a lot of things about our
 

4627
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:45,050
can predict a lot of things about our

universe well okay but just to sort of
 

4629
01:37:45,060 --> 01:37:48,229

throw one thing in in order to answer

01:37:48,229 --> 01:37:48,239
throw one thing in in order to answer
 

4631
01:37:48,239 --> 01:37:49,970
throw one thing in in order to answer
every question

4632
01:37:49,970 --> 01:37:49,980
every question
 

4633
01:37:49,980 --> 01:37:52,490
every question
we would need a theory of the origin of

4634
01:37:52,490 --> 01:37:52,500
we would need a theory of the origin of
 

4635
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:54,770
we would need a theory of the origin of
the universe right

4636
01:37:54,770 --> 01:37:54,780
the universe right
 

4637
01:37:54,780 --> 01:37:57,770
the universe right
and that is a huge

4638
01:37:57,770 --> 01:37:57,780
and that is a huge
 

4639
01:37:57,780 --> 01:38:02,450
and that is a huge
uh task right so and the fact that the

4640
01:38:02,450 --> 01:38:02,460
uh task right so and the fact that the
 

4641
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:05,750
uh task right so and the fact that the
Universe seems to have a beginning

4642
01:38:05,750 --> 01:38:05,760
Universe seems to have a beginning
 

4643
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:08,590
Universe seems to have a beginning
defies everything we know and love right

4644
01:38:08,590 --> 01:38:08,600
defies everything we know and love right
 

4645
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:11,870
defies everything we know and love right
because we we you know one of the one of

4646
01:38:11,870 --> 01:38:11,880
because we we you know one of the one of
 

4647
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:12,709
because we we you know one of the one of
the

4648
01:38:12,709 --> 01:38:12,719
the
 

4649
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:14,990
the
basic principles the physics is

4650
01:38:14,990 --> 01:38:15,000
basic principles the physics is
 

4651
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:18,410
basic principles the physics is
determinism that the past follows from

4652
01:38:18,410 --> 01:38:18,420
determinism that the past follows from
 

4653
01:38:18,420 --> 01:38:19,430
determinism that the past follows from
the

4654
01:38:19,430 --> 01:38:19,440
the
 

4655
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:22,129
the
the present follows from the past

4656
01:38:22,129 --> 01:38:22,139
the present follows from the past
 

4657
01:38:22,139 --> 01:38:25,010
the present follows from the past
the future follows from the present so

4658
01:38:25,010 --> 01:38:25,020
the future follows from the present so
 

4659
01:38:25,020 --> 01:38:26,090
the future follows from the present so
on

4660
01:38:26,090 --> 01:38:26,100
on
 

4661
01:38:26,100 --> 01:38:27,530
on
but

4662
01:38:27,530 --> 01:38:27,540
but
 

4663
01:38:27,540 --> 01:38:29,090
but
if you have the origin of the universe

4664
01:38:29,090 --> 01:38:29,100
if you have the origin of the universe
 

4665
01:38:29,100 --> 01:38:30,709
if you have the origin of the universe
if you have a big bang that means before

4666
01:38:30,709 --> 01:38:30,719
if you have a big bang that means before
 

4667
01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:32,330
if you have a big bang that means before
that there was nothing

4668
01:38:32,330 --> 01:38:32,340
that there was nothing
 

4669
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:34,189
that there was nothing
and you can't have a theory in which

4670
01:38:34,189 --> 01:38:34,199
and you can't have a theory in which
 

4671
01:38:34,199 --> 01:38:37,129
and you can't have a theory in which
something Falls from nothing

4672
01:38:37,129 --> 01:38:37,139
something Falls from nothing
 

4673
01:38:37,139 --> 01:38:39,350
something Falls from nothing
so somehow sounds like you don't like

4674
01:38:39,350 --> 01:38:39,360
so somehow sounds like you don't like
 

4675
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:42,169
so somehow sounds like you don't like
singularities

4676
01:38:42,169 --> 01:38:42,179

 

4677
01:38:42,179 --> 01:38:44,030

well I thought for somebody that works

4678
01:38:44,030 --> 01:38:44,040
well I thought for somebody that works
 

4679
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:45,530
well I thought for somebody that works
with black holes you'll get used to them

4680
01:38:45,530 --> 01:38:45,540
with black holes you'll get used to them
 

4681
01:38:45,540 --> 01:38:48,110
with black holes you'll get used to them
by now no no I I like this because it's

4682
01:38:48,110 --> 01:38:48,120
by now no no I I like this because it's
 

4683
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:50,270
by now no no I I like this because it's
it's so hard to understand

4684
01:38:50,270 --> 01:38:50,280
it's so hard to understand
 

4685
01:38:50,280 --> 01:38:51,770
it's so hard to understand
I like it because it's hard to

4686
01:38:51,770 --> 01:38:51,780
I like it because it's hard to
 

4687
01:38:51,780 --> 01:38:53,810
I like it because it's hard to
understand but but it's really

4688
01:38:53,810 --> 01:38:53,820
understand but but it's really
 

4689
01:38:53,820 --> 01:38:55,729
understand but but it's really
challenging us it's not a I don't think

4690
01:38:55,729 --> 01:38:55,739
challenging us it's not a I don't think
 

4691
01:38:55,739 --> 01:38:57,830
challenging us it's not a I don't think
we're close to solving that problem so

4692
01:38:57,830 --> 01:38:57,840
we're close to solving that problem so
 

4693
01:38:57,840 --> 01:38:59,209
we're close to solving that problem so
even uh

4694
01:38:59,209 --> 01:38:59,219
even uh
 

4695
01:38:59,219 --> 01:39:01,430
even uh
and strength string theory has basically

4696
01:39:01,430 --> 01:39:01,440
and strength string theory has basically
 

4697
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:03,890
and strength string theory has basically
had nothing there's been almost nothing

4698
01:39:03,890 --> 01:39:03,900
had nothing there's been almost nothing
 

4699
01:39:03,900 --> 01:39:06,229
had nothing there's been almost nothing
interesting said about that

4700
01:39:06,229 --> 01:39:06,239
interesting said about that
 

4701
01:39:06,239 --> 01:39:07,850
interesting said about that
in the last

4702
01:39:07,850 --> 01:39:07,860
in the last
 

4703
01:39:07,860 --> 01:39:10,189
in the last
many decades so String Theory hasn't

4704
01:39:10,189 --> 01:39:10,199
many decades so String Theory hasn't
 

4705
01:39:10,199 --> 01:39:12,410
many decades so String Theory hasn't
really looked at the big bang it hasn't

4706
01:39:12,410 --> 01:39:12,420
really looked at the big bang it hasn't
 

4707
01:39:12,420 --> 01:39:14,090
really looked at the big bang it hasn't
really tried to get to see the origin

4708
01:39:14,090 --> 01:39:14,100
really tried to get to see the origin
 

4709
01:39:14,100 --> 01:39:17,209
really tried to get to see the origin
not not successfully not not in there

4710
01:39:17,209 --> 01:39:17,219
not not successfully not not in there
 

4711
01:39:17,219 --> 01:39:19,310
not not successfully not not in there
there aren't compelling papers that lots

4712
01:39:19,310 --> 01:39:19,320
there aren't compelling papers that lots
 

4713
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:21,709
there aren't compelling papers that lots
of people have read that that people

4714
01:39:21,709 --> 01:39:21,719
of people have read that that people
 

4715
01:39:21,719 --> 01:39:23,810
of people have read that that people
have taken it up and tried to go at it

4716
01:39:23,810 --> 01:39:23,820
have taken it up and tried to go at it
 

4717
01:39:23,820 --> 01:39:26,570
have taken it up and tried to go at it
but but there aren't there aren't there

4718
01:39:26,570 --> 01:39:26,580
but but there aren't there aren't there
 

4719
01:39:26,580 --> 01:39:28,310
but but there aren't there aren't there
aren't compelling

4720
01:39:28,310 --> 01:39:28,320
aren't compelling
 

4721
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:30,830
aren't compelling
String Theory doesn't seem to

4722
01:39:30,830 --> 01:39:30,840
String Theory doesn't seem to
 

4723
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:32,930
String Theory doesn't seem to
have a trick that

4724
01:39:32,930 --> 01:39:32,940
have a trick that
 

4725
01:39:32,940 --> 01:39:35,570
have a trick that
that helps us with that puzzle do you

4726
01:39:35,570 --> 01:39:35,580
that helps us with that puzzle do you
 

4727
01:39:35,580 --> 01:39:36,890
that helps us with that puzzle do you
think we'll be able to sneak up to the

4728
01:39:36,890 --> 01:39:36,900
think we'll be able to sneak up to the
 

4729
01:39:36,900 --> 01:39:39,110
think we'll be able to sneak up to the
the origin of the universe like reverse

4730
01:39:39,110 --> 01:39:39,120
the origin of the universe like reverse
 

4731
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:41,330
the origin of the universe like reverse
engineer it from experimental from

4732
01:39:41,330 --> 01:39:41,340
engineer it from experimental from
 

4733
01:39:41,340 --> 01:39:44,570
engineer it from experimental from
theoretical perspective like okay if if

4734
01:39:44,570 --> 01:39:44,580
theoretical perspective like okay if if
 

4735
01:39:44,580 --> 01:39:48,110
theoretical perspective like okay if if
we can well it's what would be you've

4736
01:39:48,110 --> 01:39:48,120
we can well it's what would be you've
 

4737
01:39:48,120 --> 01:39:50,090
we can well it's what would be you've
already gotten yourself in trouble you

4738
01:39:50,090 --> 01:39:50,100
already gotten yourself in trouble you
 

4739
01:39:50,100 --> 01:39:51,709
already gotten yourself in trouble you
see because you use the word reverse

4740
01:39:51,709 --> 01:39:51,719
see because you use the word reverse
 

4741
01:39:51,719 --> 01:39:52,910
see because you use the word reverse
engineer

4742
01:39:52,910 --> 01:39:52,920
engineer
 

4743
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:55,270
engineer
so if you're going to reverse engineer

4744
01:39:55,270 --> 01:39:55,280
so if you're going to reverse engineer
 

4745
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:59,330
so if you're going to reverse engineer
that means you know you you

4746
01:39:59,330 --> 01:39:59,340
that means you know you you
 

4747
01:39:59,340 --> 01:40:01,610
that means you know you you
forward engineering means that you take

4748
01:40:01,610 --> 01:40:01,620
forward engineering means that you take
 

4749
01:40:01,620 --> 01:40:03,169
forward engineering means that you take
the present and determine the future

4750
01:40:03,169 --> 01:40:03,179
the present and determine the future
 

4751
01:40:03,179 --> 01:40:05,629
the present and determine the future
reverse engineering means that you take

4752
01:40:05,629 --> 01:40:05,639
reverse engineering means that you take
 

4753
01:40:05,639 --> 01:40:08,390
reverse engineering means that you take
the present and determine the past but

4754
01:40:08,390 --> 01:40:08,400
the present and determine the past but
 

4755
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:11,450
the present and determine the past but
estimate the best but yes sure but but

4756
01:40:11,450 --> 01:40:11,460
estimate the best but yes sure but but
 

4757
01:40:11,460 --> 01:40:14,209
estimate the best but yes sure but but
but if the past was nothing how are you

4758
01:40:14,209 --> 01:40:14,219
but if the past was nothing how are you
 

4759
01:40:14,219 --> 01:40:17,570
but if the past was nothing how are you
ever gonna reverse engineer to nothing

4760
01:40:17,570 --> 01:40:17,580
ever gonna reverse engineer to nothing
 

4761
01:40:17,580 --> 01:40:19,370
ever gonna reverse engineer to nothing
well that's hard to do run up against

4762
01:40:19,370 --> 01:40:19,380
well that's hard to do run up against
 

4763
01:40:19,380 --> 01:40:21,470
well that's hard to do run up against
the nothing right until they have

4764
01:40:21,470 --> 01:40:21,480
the nothing right until they have
 

4765
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:22,850
the nothing right until they have
mathematical models that break down

4766
01:40:22,850 --> 01:40:22,860
mathematical models that break down
 

4767
01:40:22,860 --> 01:40:24,830
mathematical models that break down
nicely to where you can actually start

4768
01:40:24,830 --> 01:40:24,840
nicely to where you can actually start
 

4769
01:40:24,840 --> 01:40:29,830
nicely to where you can actually start
to infer things

4770
01:40:29,830 --> 01:40:29,840

 

4771
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:32,930

let's work on it no but do you think

4772
01:40:32,930 --> 01:40:32,940
let's work on it no but do you think
 

4773
01:40:32,940 --> 01:40:36,470
let's work on it no but do you think
that that it could maybe but it is

4774
01:40:36,470 --> 01:40:36,480
that that it could maybe but it is
 

4775
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:38,390
that that it could maybe but it is
people try to do things like that yeah

4776
01:40:38,390 --> 01:40:38,400
people try to do things like that yeah
 

4777
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:40,610
people try to do things like that yeah
but have not succeeded it's not it's not

4778
01:40:40,610 --> 01:40:40,620
but have not succeeded it's not it's not
 

4779
01:40:40,620 --> 01:40:42,770
but have not succeeded it's not it's not
something that we we you know we're

4780
01:40:42,770 --> 01:40:42,780
something that we we you know we're
 

4781
01:40:42,780 --> 01:40:45,169
something that we we you know we're
getting a pluses in sure

4782
01:40:45,169 --> 01:40:45,179
getting a pluses in sure
 

4783
01:40:45,179 --> 01:40:47,629
getting a pluses in sure
let's pretend we live in a world where

4784
01:40:47,629 --> 01:40:47,639
let's pretend we live in a world where
 

4785
01:40:47,639 --> 01:40:50,209
let's pretend we live in a world where
in a hundred years we have an answer to

4786
01:40:50,209 --> 01:40:50,219
in a hundred years we have an answer to
 

4787
01:40:50,219 --> 01:40:51,410
in a hundred years we have an answer to
that

4788
01:40:51,410 --> 01:40:51,420
that
 

4789
01:40:51,420 --> 01:40:53,229
that
yeah what would that answer look like

4790
01:40:53,229 --> 01:40:53,239
yeah what would that answer look like
 

4791
01:40:53,239 --> 01:40:57,229
yeah what would that answer look like
who what department is that from

4792
01:40:57,229 --> 01:40:57,239
who what department is that from
 

4793
01:40:57,239 --> 01:41:01,310
who what department is that from
What fields left led us there what uh uh

4794
01:41:01,310 --> 01:41:01,320
What fields left led us there what uh uh
 

4795
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:03,229
What fields left led us there what uh uh
not what feels what set of ideas and

4796
01:41:03,229 --> 01:41:03,239
not what feels what set of ideas and
 

4797
01:41:03,239 --> 01:41:05,450
not what feels what set of ideas and
theoretical physics

4798
01:41:05,450 --> 01:41:05,460
theoretical physics
 

4799
01:41:05,460 --> 01:41:08,390
theoretical physics
um is it experimental is it theoretical

4800
01:41:08,390 --> 01:41:08,400
um is it experimental is it theoretical
 

4801
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:10,310
um is it experimental is it theoretical
like what can you imagine possibly could

4802
01:41:10,310 --> 01:41:10,320
like what can you imagine possibly could
 

4803
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:11,810
like what can you imagine possibly could
have possibly lead us there is it

4804
01:41:11,810 --> 01:41:11,820
have possibly lead us there is it
 

4805
01:41:11,820 --> 01:41:13,070
have possibly lead us there is it
through gravitational waves and some

4806
01:41:13,070 --> 01:41:13,080
through gravitational waves and some
 

4807
01:41:13,080 --> 01:41:14,810
through gravitational waves and some
kind of observations there is it

4808
01:41:14,810 --> 01:41:14,820
kind of observations there is it
 

4809
01:41:14,820 --> 01:41:16,910
kind of observations there is it
investigation of black holes is a

4810
01:41:16,910 --> 01:41:16,920
investigation of black holes is a
 

4811
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:20,810
investigation of black holes is a
simulation of universes is it uh

4812
01:41:20,810 --> 01:41:20,820
simulation of universes is it uh
 

4813
01:41:20,820 --> 01:41:22,669
simulation of universes is it uh
maybe you start creating black holes

4814
01:41:22,669 --> 01:41:22,679
maybe you start creating black holes
 

4815
01:41:22,679 --> 01:41:24,890
maybe you start creating black holes
somehow I don't I don't know uh

4816
01:41:24,890 --> 01:41:24,900
somehow I don't I don't know uh
 

4817
01:41:24,900 --> 01:41:26,570
somehow I don't I don't know uh
maybe some kind of high energy physics

4818
01:41:26,570 --> 01:41:26,580
maybe some kind of high energy physics
 

4819
01:41:26,580 --> 01:41:28,310
maybe some kind of high energy physics
type of experiments

4820
01:41:28,310 --> 01:41:28,320
type of experiments
 

4821
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:31,610
type of experiments
well

4822
01:41:31,610 --> 01:41:31,620

 

4823
01:41:31,620 --> 01:41:33,950

I have some late night ideas about that

4824
01:41:33,950 --> 01:41:33,960
I have some late night ideas about that
 

4825
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:36,229
I have some late night ideas about that
that aren't really ready for Prime drugs

4826
01:41:36,229 --> 01:41:36,239
that aren't really ready for Prime drugs
 

4827
01:41:36,239 --> 01:41:39,109
that aren't really ready for Prime drugs
okay sure but you have some ideas yeah

4828
01:41:39,109 --> 01:41:39,119
okay sure but you have some ideas yeah
 

4829
01:41:39,119 --> 01:41:41,330
okay sure but you have some ideas yeah
yeah but but

4830
01:41:41,330 --> 01:41:41,340
yeah but but
 

4831
01:41:41,340 --> 01:41:44,570
yeah but but
um and many people do it could be that

4832
01:41:44,570 --> 01:41:44,580
um and many people do it could be that
 

4833
01:41:44,580 --> 01:41:46,070
um and many people do it could be that
some of the advances in Quantum

4834
01:41:46,070 --> 01:41:46,080
some of the advances in Quantum
 

4835
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:49,790
some of the advances in Quantum
information Theory are important in in

4836
01:41:49,790 --> 01:41:49,800
information Theory are important in in
 

4837
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:50,930
information Theory are important in in
that they

4838
01:41:50,930 --> 01:41:50,940
that they
 

4839
01:41:50,940 --> 01:41:54,530
that they
kind of go beyond taking Quantum systems

4840
01:41:54,530 --> 01:41:54,540
kind of go beyond taking Quantum systems
 

4841
01:41:54,540 --> 01:41:57,229
kind of go beyond taking Quantum systems
and just replicating themselves but

4842
01:41:57,229 --> 01:41:57,239
and just replicating themselves but
 

4843
01:41:57,239 --> 01:42:00,830
and just replicating themselves but
combining them with others do you think

4844
01:42:00,830 --> 01:42:00,840
combining them with others do you think
 

4845
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:04,370
combining them with others do you think
since uh you highlighted the issue with

4846
01:42:04,370 --> 01:42:04,380
since uh you highlighted the issue with
 

4847
01:42:04,380 --> 01:42:06,229
since uh you highlighted the issue with
time and the origin of the universe do

4848
01:42:06,229 --> 01:42:06,239
time and the origin of the universe do
 

4849
01:42:06,239 --> 01:42:07,910
time and the origin of the universe do
you think time is fundamental or or

4850
01:42:07,910 --> 01:42:07,920
you think time is fundamental or or
 

4851
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:10,490
you think time is fundamental or or
emergent

4852
01:42:10,490 --> 01:42:10,500
emergent
 

4853
01:42:10,500 --> 01:42:13,550
emergent
I think ultimately it has to be emergent

4854
01:42:13,550 --> 01:42:13,560
I think ultimately it has to be emergent
 

4855
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:15,229
I think ultimately it has to be emergent
yeah what does it mean for time to be

4856
01:42:15,229 --> 01:42:15,239
yeah what does it mean for time to be
 

4857
01:42:15,239 --> 01:42:17,750
yeah what does it mean for time to be
emergent

4858
01:42:17,750 --> 01:42:17,760

 

4859
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:19,729

well

4860
01:42:19,729 --> 01:42:19,739
well
 

4861
01:42:19,739 --> 01:42:21,830
well
because let's review what it means for

4862
01:42:21,830 --> 01:42:21,840
because let's review what it means for
 

4863
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:23,750
because let's review what it means for
space to be emergent

4864
01:42:23,750 --> 01:42:23,760
space to be emergent
 

4865
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:26,270
space to be emergent
yes what it means for space to be

4866
01:42:26,270 --> 01:42:26,280
yes what it means for space to be
 

4867
01:42:26,280 --> 01:42:29,510
yes what it means for space to be
emergent is that

4868
01:42:29,510 --> 01:42:29,520
emergent is that
 

4869
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:30,109
emergent is that
um

4870
01:42:30,109 --> 01:42:30,119
um
 

4871
01:42:30,119 --> 01:42:33,709
um
you you have a holographic plate

4872
01:42:33,709 --> 01:42:33,719
you you have a holographic plate
 

4873
01:42:33,719 --> 01:42:37,070
you you have a holographic plate
and you shine some light that's moving

4874
01:42:37,070 --> 01:42:37,080
and you shine some light that's moving
 

4875
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:38,870
and you shine some light that's moving
in space

4876
01:42:38,870 --> 01:42:38,880
in space
 

4877
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:41,750
in space
and it produces an image

4878
01:42:41,750 --> 01:42:41,760
and it produces an image
 

4879
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:43,729
and it produces an image
which contains an extra spatial

4880
01:42:43,729 --> 01:42:43,739
which contains an extra spatial
 

4881
01:42:43,739 --> 01:42:44,870
which contains an extra spatial
dimension

4882
01:42:44,870 --> 01:42:44,880
dimension
 

4883
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:49,189
dimension
and time just goes along for the ride

4884
01:42:49,189 --> 01:42:49,199

 

4885
01:42:49,199 --> 01:42:52,250

so what we'd like to

4886
01:42:52,250 --> 01:42:52,260
so what we'd like to
 

4887
01:42:52,260 --> 01:42:55,010
so what we'd like to
do and indeed there is some rather

4888
01:42:55,010 --> 01:42:55,020
do and indeed there is some rather
 

4889
01:42:55,020 --> 01:42:56,689
do and indeed there is some rather
concrete

4890
01:42:56,689 --> 01:42:56,699
concrete
 

4891
01:42:56,699 --> 01:42:58,669
concrete
work in this direction though again I

4892
01:42:58,669 --> 01:42:58,679
work in this direction though again I
 

4893
01:42:58,679 --> 01:43:01,550
work in this direction though again I
would say even within our stringy

4894
01:43:01,550 --> 01:43:01,560
would say even within our stringy
 

4895
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:04,070
would say even within our stringy

5029
01:45:55,679 --> 01:46:00,189
through conversations with them
which started out in an effort

5030
01:46:00,189 --> 01:46:00,199
which started out in an effort
 

5031
01:46:00,199 --> 01:46:04,490
which started out in an effort
to understand the image that they'd seen

5032
01:46:04,490 --> 01:46:04,500
to understand the image that they'd seen
 

5033
01:46:04,500 --> 01:46:07,490
to understand the image that they'd seen
so it's a great thing for somebody like

01:46:07,490 --> 01:46:07,500
so it's a great thing for somebody like
 

5035
01:46:07,500 --> 01:46:10,010
so it's a great thing for somebody like

what do you want to concentrate on in

5066
01:47:02,149 --> 01:47:02,159
what do you want to concentrate on in
 

5067
01:47:02,159 --> 01:47:04,729
what do you want to concentrate on in
the photograph you know just point at

5068
01:47:04,729 --> 01:47:04,739
the photograph you know just point at
 

5069
01:47:04,739 --> 01:47:06,470
the photograph you know just point at
the sky and click no you don't do that

5070
01:47:06,470 --> 01:47:06,480
the sky and click no you don't do that
 

5071
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:10,010
the sky and click no you don't do that
you you optimize for various features

5072
01:47:10,010 --> 01:47:10,020
you you optimize for various features
 

5073
01:47:10,020 --> 01:47:16,250
you you optimize for various features
and um it's it's both shaping that and

5074
01:47:16,250 --> 01:47:16,260
and um it's it's both shaping that and
 

5075
01:47:16,260 --> 01:47:18,709
and um it's it's both shaping that and
in the process of

light behaves around a black hole

5080
01:47:24,290 --> 01:47:24,300
light behaves around a black hole
 

5081
01:47:24,300 --> 01:47:27,709
light behaves around a black hole
it they black holes just have so many

5082
01:47:27,709 --> 01:47:27,719
it they black holes just have so many
 

5083
01:47:27,719 --> 01:47:29,810
it they black holes just have so many
magic tricks and they do so many weird

5084
01:47:29,810 --> 01:47:29,820
magic tricks and they do so many weird
 

5085
01:47:29,820 --> 01:47:31,010
magic tricks and they do so many weird
things

5086
01:47:31,010 --> 01:47:31,020
things
 

5087
01:47:31,020 --> 01:47:33,590
things
and the photon ring is among the

5088
01:47:33,590 --> 01:47:33,600
and the photon ring is among the
 

5089
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:36,950
and the photon ring is among the
weirdest of them we understood the this

5090
01:47:36,950 --> 01:47:36,960
weirdest of them we understood the this
 

5091
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:39,709
weirdest of them we understood the this
Photon ring and in the process of this

5092
01:47:39,709 --> 01:47:39,719
Photon ring and in the process of this
 

5093
01:47:39,719 --> 01:47:44,950
Photon ring and in the process of this
we said hey this Photon ring

5094
01:47:44,950 --> 01:47:44,960
we said hey this Photon ring
 

5095
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:48,169
we said hey this Photon ring
has got to be telling us something

5096
01:47:48,169 --> 01:47:48,179
has got to be telling us something
 

5097
01:47:48,179 --> 01:47:50,149
has got to be telling us something
about the puzzle

5098
01:47:50,149 --> 01:47:50,159
about the puzzle
 

5099
01:47:50,159 --> 01:47:55,370
about the puzzle
of where the holographic plate is

5100
01:47:55,370 --> 01:47:55,380

 

5101
01:47:55,380 --> 01:47:58,430

um outside of a ordinary astrophysical

5102
01:47:58,430 --> 01:47:58,440
um outside of a ordinary astrophysical
 

5103
01:47:58,440 --> 01:48:01,370
um outside of a ordinary astrophysical
black hole and we nailed it for the

5104
01:48:01,370 --> 01:48:01,380
black hole and we nailed it for the
 

5105
01:48:01,380 --> 01:48:02,990
black hole and we nailed it for the
stringy black holes

5106
01:48:02,990 --> 01:48:03,000
stringy black holes
 

5107
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,810
stringy black holes
but they have a somewhat different

5108
01:48:05,810 --> 01:48:05,820
but they have a somewhat different
 

5109
01:48:05,820 --> 01:48:08,870
but they have a somewhat different
character with a stringy black hole the

5110
01:48:08,870 --> 01:48:08,880
character with a stringy black hole the
 

5111
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:10,729
character with a stringy black hole the
the black holes that describe us the

5112
01:48:10,729 --> 01:48:10,739
the black holes that describe us the
 

5113
01:48:10,739 --> 01:48:12,470
the black holes that describe us the
black holes that are contained in string

5114
01:48:12,470 --> 01:48:12,480
black holes that are contained in string
 

5115
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:15,530
black holes that are contained in string
theory and they have different structure

5116
01:48:15,530 --> 01:48:15,540
theory and they have different structure
 

5117
01:48:15,540 --> 01:48:17,629
theory and they have different structure
in them sure well basically can we step

5118
01:48:17,629 --> 01:48:17,639
in them sure well basically can we step
 

5119
01:48:17,639 --> 01:48:19,430
in them sure well basically can we step
back so what was the light in the image

5120
01:48:19,430 --> 01:48:19,440
back so what was the light in the image
 

5121
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:23,209
back so what was the light in the image
taken in 2019 not taken to 2018

5122
01:48:23,209 --> 01:48:23,219
taken in 2019 not taken to 2018
 

5123
01:48:23,219 --> 01:48:25,430
taken in 2019 not taken to 2018
um uh presented in 2000 so here's the

5124
01:48:25,430 --> 01:48:25,440
um uh presented in 2000 so here's the
 

5125
01:48:25,440 --> 01:48:27,410
um uh presented in 2000 so here's the
puzzle

5126
01:48:27,410 --> 01:48:27,420
puzzle
 

5127
01:48:27,420 --> 01:48:30,350
puzzle
um what they really saw

5128
01:48:30,350 --> 01:48:30,360
um what they really saw
 

5129
01:48:30,360 --> 01:48:34,450
um what they really saw
so the black holes tend to gather stuff

5130
01:48:34,450 --> 01:48:34,460
so the black holes tend to gather stuff
 

5131
01:48:34,460 --> 01:48:37,129
so the black holes tend to gather stuff
that swirls around it

5132
01:48:37,129 --> 01:48:37,139
that swirls around it
 

5133
01:48:37,139 --> 01:48:38,390
that swirls around it
yeah

5134
01:48:38,390 --> 01:48:38,400
yeah
 

5135
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:41,209
yeah
and they don't know what that stuff is

5136
01:48:41,209 --> 01:48:41,219
and they don't know what that stuff is
 

5137
01:48:41,219 --> 01:48:42,770
and they don't know what that stuff is
made of they don't know what its

5138
01:48:42,770 --> 01:48:42,780
made of they don't know what its
 

5139
01:48:42,780 --> 01:48:45,109
made of they don't know what its
temperature is they don't know what kind

5140
01:48:45,109 --> 01:48:45,119
temperature is they don't know what kind
 

5141
01:48:45,119 --> 01:48:46,910
temperature is they don't know what kind
of magnetic fields there are around

5142
01:48:46,910 --> 01:48:46,920
of magnetic fields there are around
 

5143
01:48:46,920 --> 01:48:48,169
of magnetic fields there are around
there

5144
01:48:48,169 --> 01:48:48,179
there
 

5145
01:48:48,179 --> 01:48:49,850
there
so

5146
01:48:49,850 --> 01:48:49,860
so
 

5147
01:48:49,860 --> 01:48:53,209
so
the form of the image has a lot of

5148
01:48:53,209 --> 01:48:53,219
the form of the image has a lot of
 

5149
01:48:53,219 --> 01:48:55,189
the form of the image has a lot of
unknowns in it that it's dependent on

5150
01:48:55,189 --> 01:48:55,199
unknowns in it that it's dependent on
 

5151
01:48:55,199 --> 01:48:57,770
unknowns in it that it's dependent on
many other things other than the

5152
01:48:57,770 --> 01:48:57,780
many other things other than the
 

5153
01:48:57,780 --> 01:49:00,229
many other things other than the
geometry of the black hole

5154
01:49:00,229 --> 01:49:00,239
geometry of the black hole
 

5155
01:49:00,239 --> 01:49:03,350
geometry of the black hole
so most of what you're learning

5156
01:49:03,350 --> 01:49:03,360
so most of what you're learning
 

5157
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:07,010
so most of what you're learning
is about the stuff

5158
01:49:07,010 --> 01:49:07,020
is about the stuff
 

5159
01:49:07,020 --> 01:49:11,030
is about the stuff
now the stuff the swirling stuff the hot

5160
01:49:11,030 --> 01:49:11,040
now the stuff the swirling stuff the hot
 

5161
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:12,530
now the stuff the swirling stuff the hot
swirling stuff

5162
01:49:12,530 --> 01:49:12,540
swirling stuff
 

5163
01:49:12,540 --> 01:49:14,930
swirling stuff
is interesting as hell

5164
01:49:14,930 --> 01:49:14,940
is interesting as hell
 

5165
01:49:14,940 --> 01:49:17,030
is interesting as hell
but it's not as interesting as the black

5166
01:49:17,030 --> 01:49:17,040
but it's not as interesting as the black
 

5167
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:19,850
but it's not as interesting as the black
hole which are the which are the most in

5168
01:49:19,850 --> 01:49:19,860
hole which are the which are the most in
 

5169
01:49:19,860 --> 01:49:20,810
hole which are the which are the most in
my view

5170
01:49:20,810 --> 01:49:20,820
my view
 

5171
01:49:20,820 --> 01:49:22,729
my view
the most interesting things of the

5172
01:49:22,729 --> 01:49:22,739
the most interesting things of the
 

5173
01:49:22,739 --> 01:49:25,370
the most interesting things of the
universe so you don't want to just learn

5174
01:49:25,370 --> 01:49:25,380
universe so you don't want to just learn
 

5175
01:49:25,380 --> 01:49:28,030
universe so you don't want to just learn
about the stuff you want to learn about

5176
01:49:28,030 --> 01:49:28,040
about the stuff you want to learn about
 

5177
01:49:28,040 --> 01:49:30,770
about the stuff you want to learn about
the black hole that that it's swirling

5178
01:49:30,770 --> 01:49:30,780
the black hole that that it's swirling
 

5179
01:49:30,780 --> 01:49:33,350
the black hole that that it's swirling
around so one of the

5180
01:49:33,350 --> 01:49:33,360
around so one of the
 

5181
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:35,570
around so one of the
at the very first step of the very

5182
01:49:35,570 --> 01:49:35,580
at the very first step of the very
 

5183
01:49:35,580 --> 01:49:38,209
at the very first step of the very
primitive level this is just a big leap

5184
01:49:38,209 --> 01:49:38,219
primitive level this is just a big leap
 

5185
01:49:38,219 --> 01:49:41,450
primitive level this is just a big leap
for human civilization to be able to see

5186
01:49:41,450 --> 01:49:41,460
for human civilization to be able to see
 

5187
01:49:41,460 --> 01:49:44,570
for human civilization to be able to see
a black hole and the way you can see it

5188
01:49:44,570 --> 01:49:44,580
a black hole and the way you can see it
 

5189
01:49:44,580 --> 01:49:47,030
a black hole and the way you can see it
is because there's stuff around it but

5190
01:49:47,030 --> 01:49:47,040
is because there's stuff around it but
 

5191
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:49,070
is because there's stuff around it but
you don't get to learn much about the

5192
01:49:49,070 --> 01:49:49,080
you don't get to learn much about the
 

5193
01:49:49,080 --> 01:49:51,590
you don't get to learn much about the
black hole you get to learn more about

5194
01:49:51,590 --> 01:49:51,600
black hole you get to learn more about
 

5195
01:49:51,600 --> 01:49:54,709
black hole you get to learn more about
the stuff just from the image yeah okay

5196
01:49:54,709 --> 01:49:54,719
the stuff just from the image yeah okay
 

5197
01:49:54,719 --> 01:49:56,330
the stuff just from the image yeah okay
but you're not going to learn about the

5198
01:49:56,330 --> 01:49:56,340
but you're not going to learn about the
 

5199
01:49:56,340 --> 01:49:58,310
but you're not going to learn about the
details before you've even seen it

5200
01:49:58,310 --> 01:49:58,320
details before you've even seen it
 

5201
01:49:58,320 --> 01:49:59,570
details before you've even seen it
because there's too many parameters

5202
01:49:59,570 --> 01:49:59,580
because there's too many parameters
 

5203
01:49:59,580 --> 01:50:00,830
because there's too many parameters
there's too many variables that govern

5204
01:50:00,830 --> 01:50:00,840
there's too many variables that govern
 

5205
01:50:00,840 --> 01:50:05,330
there's too many variables that govern
the stuff yeah so then we found a very

5206
01:50:05,330 --> 01:50:05,340
the stuff yeah so then we found a very
 

5207
01:50:05,340 --> 01:50:07,010
the stuff yeah so then we found a very
wonderful way

5208
01:50:07,010 --> 01:50:07,020
wonderful way
 

5209
01:50:07,020 --> 01:50:09,770
wonderful way
to learn about the black hole and here's

5210
01:50:09,770 --> 01:50:09,780
to learn about the black hole and here's
 

5211
01:50:09,780 --> 01:50:11,990
to learn about the black hole and here's
how it works

5212
01:50:11,990 --> 01:50:12,000
how it works
 

5213
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,990
how it works
a black hole is a mirror

5214
01:50:14,990 --> 01:50:15,000
a black hole is a mirror
 

5215
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:18,290
a black hole is a mirror
and the way it's a mirror is if light a

5216
01:50:18,290 --> 01:50:18,300
and the way it's a mirror is if light a
 

5217
01:50:18,300 --> 01:50:22,070
and the way it's a mirror is if light a
photon bounces off your face

5218
01:50:22,070 --> 01:50:22,080
photon bounces off your face
 

5219
01:50:22,080 --> 01:50:24,410
photon bounces off your face
towards the black hole it goes straight

5220
01:50:24,410 --> 01:50:24,420
towards the black hole it goes straight
 

5221
01:50:24,420 --> 01:50:26,870
towards the black hole it goes straight
to the black hole just Falls in you

5222
01:50:26,870 --> 01:50:26,880
to the black hole just Falls in you
 

5223
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:28,669
to the black hole just Falls in you
never see it again

5224
01:50:28,669 --> 01:50:28,679
never see it again
 

5225
01:50:28,679 --> 01:50:32,570
never see it again
but if it just misses the black hole

5226
01:50:32,570 --> 01:50:32,580
but if it just misses the black hole
 

5227
01:50:32,580 --> 01:50:35,570
but if it just misses the black hole
it'll swing around the back and come

5228
01:50:35,570 --> 01:50:35,580
it'll swing around the back and come
 

5229
01:50:35,580 --> 01:50:37,010
it'll swing around the back and come
back to you

5230
01:50:37,010 --> 01:50:37,020
back to you
 

5231
01:50:37,020 --> 01:50:39,050
back to you
and you see yourself

5232
01:50:39,050 --> 01:50:39,060
and you see yourself
 

5233
01:50:39,060 --> 01:50:41,570
and you see yourself
from the photon that went around the

5234
01:50:41,570 --> 01:50:41,580
from the photon that went around the
 

5235
01:50:41,580 --> 01:50:43,189
from the photon that went around the
back of the black hole

5236
01:50:43,189 --> 01:50:43,199
back of the black hole
 

5237
01:50:43,199 --> 01:50:45,590
back of the black hole
but not only can that happen

5238
01:50:45,590 --> 01:50:45,600
but not only can that happen
 

5239
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:48,649
but not only can that happen
the black hole the photon can swing

5240
01:50:48,649 --> 01:50:48,659
the black hole the photon can swing
 

5241
01:50:48,659 --> 01:50:51,050
the black hole the photon can swing
around twice

5242
01:50:51,050 --> 01:50:51,060
around twice
 

5243
01:50:51,060 --> 01:50:53,390
around twice
and come back so you actually see an

5244
01:50:53,390 --> 01:50:53,400
and come back so you actually see an
 

5245
01:50:53,400 --> 01:50:55,490
and come back so you actually see an
infinite number of copies

5246
01:50:55,490 --> 01:50:55,500
infinite number of copies
 

5247
01:50:55,500 --> 01:50:57,890
infinite number of copies
of yourself like with a little bit of a

5248
01:50:57,890 --> 01:50:57,900
of yourself like with a little bit of a
 

5249
01:50:57,900 --> 01:50:58,790
of yourself like with a little bit of a
delay

5250
01:50:58,790 --> 01:50:58,800
delay
 

5251
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:02,450
delay
with a little bit of a delay right

5252
01:51:02,450 --> 01:51:02,460
with a little bit of a delay right
 

5253
01:51:02,460 --> 01:51:07,189
with a little bit of a delay right
this is awesome yeah and in fact I mean

5254
01:51:07,189 --> 01:51:07,199
this is awesome yeah and in fact I mean
 

5255
01:51:07,199 --> 01:51:08,990
this is awesome yeah and in fact I mean
we're not used to an object that bends

5256
01:51:08,990 --> 01:51:09,000
we're not used to an object that bends
 

5257
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:10,850
we're not used to an object that bends
light like that right yeah so you're

5258
01:51:10,850 --> 01:51:10,860
light like that right yeah so you're
 

5259
01:51:10,860 --> 01:51:13,729
light like that right yeah so you're
gonna get some trippier effects and in

5260
01:51:13,729 --> 01:51:13,739
gonna get some trippier effects and in
 

5261
01:51:13,739 --> 01:51:16,189
gonna get some trippier effects and in
fact one of my my students has made a

5262
01:51:16,189 --> 01:51:16,199
fact one of my my students has made a
 

5263
01:51:16,199 --> 01:51:18,709
fact one of my my students has made a
really awesome computer animation of

5264
01:51:18,709 --> 01:51:18,719
really awesome computer animation of
 

5265
01:51:18,719 --> 01:51:20,990
really awesome computer animation of
this which I'm going to show at a public

5266
01:51:20,990 --> 01:51:21,000
this which I'm going to show at a public
 

5267
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,330
this which I'm going to show at a public
lecture in a couple weeks where the

5268
01:51:23,330 --> 01:51:23,340
lecture in a couple weeks where the
 

5269
01:51:23,340 --> 01:51:25,250
lecture in a couple weeks where the
audience will see infinitely many copies

5270
01:51:25,250 --> 01:51:25,260
audience will see infinitely many copies
 

5271
01:51:25,260 --> 01:51:26,810
audience will see infinitely many copies
of themselves

5272
01:51:26,810 --> 01:51:26,820
of themselves
 

5273
01:51:26,820 --> 01:51:30,530
of themselves
so

5274
01:51:30,530 --> 01:51:30,540

 

5275
01:51:30,540 --> 01:51:31,790

so

5276
01:51:31,790 --> 01:51:31,800
so
 

5277
01:51:31,800 --> 01:51:34,609
so
if you so it's a black hole is like a

5278
01:51:34,609 --> 01:51:34,619
if you so it's a black hole is like a
 

5279
01:51:34,619 --> 01:51:36,770
if you so it's a black hole is like a
Hall of Mirrors you know like a

5280
01:51:36,770 --> 01:51:36,780
Hall of Mirrors you know like a
 

5281
01:51:36,780 --> 01:51:38,149
Hall of Mirrors you know like a
department store where you go and

5282
01:51:38,149 --> 01:51:38,159
department store where you go and
 

5283
01:51:38,159 --> 01:51:40,070
department store where you go and
there's there's the three mirrors and

5284
01:51:40,070 --> 01:51:40,080
there's there's the three mirrors and
 

5285
01:51:40,080 --> 01:51:41,689
there's there's the three mirrors and
you see infinitely many copies of

5286
01:51:41,689 --> 01:51:41,699
you see infinitely many copies of
 

5287
01:51:41,699 --> 01:51:43,070
you see infinitely many copies of
yourself yeah

5288
01:51:43,070 --> 01:51:43,080
yourself yeah
 

5289
01:51:43,080 --> 01:51:46,430
yourself yeah
think of the black hole as the mirror

5290
01:51:46,430 --> 01:51:46,440
think of the black hole as the mirror
 

5291
01:51:46,440 --> 01:51:48,890
think of the black hole as the mirror
you know and you know you go in there

5292
01:51:48,890 --> 01:51:48,900
you know and you know you go in there
 

5293
01:51:48,900 --> 01:51:50,450
you know and you know you go in there
with your clothes if you want to know

5294
01:51:50,450 --> 01:51:50,460
with your clothes if you want to know
 

5295
01:51:50,460 --> 01:51:51,950
with your clothes if you want to know
about your clothes you just look at the

5296
01:51:51,950 --> 01:51:51,960
about your clothes you just look at the
 

5297
01:51:51,960 --> 01:51:53,330
about your clothes you just look at the
direct image you're not learning

5298
01:51:53,330 --> 01:51:53,340
direct image you're not learning
 

5299
01:51:53,340 --> 01:51:55,550
direct image you're not learning
anything about the configuration of

5300
01:51:55,550 --> 01:51:55,560
anything about the configuration of
 

5301
01:51:55,560 --> 01:51:56,510
anything about the configuration of
mirrors

5302
01:51:56,510 --> 01:51:56,520
mirrors
 

5303
01:51:56,520 --> 01:51:58,790
mirrors
but the relation

5304
01:51:58,790 --> 01:51:58,800
but the relation
 

5305
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:01,490
but the relation
of of

5306
01:52:01,490 --> 01:52:01,500
of of
 

5307
01:52:01,500 --> 01:52:02,810
of of
um

5308
01:52:02,810 --> 01:52:02,820
um
 

5309
01:52:02,820 --> 01:52:05,390
um
the image you see in front of you

5310
01:52:05,390 --> 01:52:05,400
the image you see in front of you
 

5311
01:52:05,400 --> 01:52:08,030
the image you see in front of you
to the one you see at the side and the

5312
01:52:08,030 --> 01:52:08,040
to the one you see at the side and the
 

5313
01:52:08,040 --> 01:52:10,010
to the one you see at the side and the
next one and then so on

5314
01:52:10,010 --> 01:52:10,020
next one and then so on
 

5315
01:52:10,020 --> 01:52:12,290
next one and then so on
depends only on the mirrors it doesn't

5316
01:52:12,290 --> 01:52:12,300
depends only on the mirrors it doesn't
 

5317
01:52:12,300 --> 01:52:14,750
depends only on the mirrors it doesn't
matter what clothes you're wearing

5318
01:52:14,750 --> 01:52:14,760
matter what clothes you're wearing
 

5319
01:52:14,760 --> 01:52:17,390
matter what clothes you're wearing
so you can go there a thousand times

5320
01:52:17,390 --> 01:52:17,400
so you can go there a thousand times
 

5321
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:19,970
so you can go there a thousand times
wearing different clothes but each time

5322
01:52:19,970 --> 01:52:19,980
wearing different clothes but each time
 

5323
01:52:19,980 --> 01:52:22,250
wearing different clothes but each time
there will be the same relation between

5324
01:52:22,250 --> 01:52:22,260
there will be the same relation between
 

5325
01:52:22,260 --> 01:52:24,590
there will be the same relation between
the subsequent images

5326
01:52:24,590 --> 01:52:24,600
the subsequent images
 

5327
01:52:24,600 --> 01:52:27,830
the subsequent images
and that is how

5328
01:52:27,830 --> 01:52:27,840
and that is how
 

5329
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:29,629
and that is how
we're going to learn about the black

5330
01:52:29,629 --> 01:52:29,639
we're going to learn about the black
 

5331
01:52:29,639 --> 01:52:30,649
we're going to learn about the black
holes

5332
01:52:30,649 --> 01:52:30,659
holes
 

5333
01:52:30,659 --> 01:52:32,870
holes
we're going to take the stuff that is

5334
01:52:32,870 --> 01:52:32,880
we're going to take the stuff that is
 

5335
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:34,490
we're going to take the stuff that is
swirling around

5336
01:52:34,490 --> 01:52:34,500
swirling around
 

5337
01:52:34,500 --> 01:52:37,250
swirling around
and we're going to tease out the

5338
01:52:37,250 --> 01:52:37,260
and we're going to tease out the
 

5339
01:52:37,260 --> 01:52:39,950
and we're going to tease out the
subsequent images and look at their

5340
01:52:39,950 --> 01:52:39,960
subsequent images and look at their
 

5341
01:52:39,960 --> 01:52:41,270
subsequent images and look at their
relation

5342
01:52:41,270 --> 01:52:41,280
relation
 

5343
01:52:41,280 --> 01:52:44,149
relation
and there's some very beautiful

5344
01:52:44,149 --> 01:52:44,159
and there's some very beautiful
 

5345
01:52:44,159 --> 01:52:46,370
and there's some very beautiful
really beautiful mathematics which we

5346
01:52:46,370 --> 01:52:46,380
really beautiful mathematics which we
 

5347
01:52:46,380 --> 01:52:49,550
really beautiful mathematics which we
were surprised to realize with the

5348
01:52:49,550 --> 01:52:49,560
were surprised to realize with the
 

5349
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:51,590
were surprised to realize with the
volumes and volumes of

5350
01:52:51,590 --> 01:52:51,600
volumes and volumes of
 

5351
01:52:51,600 --> 01:52:54,530
volumes and volumes of
papers on black holes in their

5352
01:52:54,530 --> 01:52:54,540
papers on black holes in their
 

5353
01:52:54,540 --> 01:52:57,229
papers on black holes in their
properties this particular

5354
01:52:57,229 --> 01:52:57,239
properties this particular
 

5355
01:52:57,239 --> 01:52:59,090
properties this particular
because it was a physical question that

5356
01:52:59,090 --> 01:52:59,100
because it was a physical question that
 

5357
01:52:59,100 --> 01:53:01,310
because it was a physical question that
had never been asked in exactly this way

5358
01:53:01,310 --> 01:53:01,320
had never been asked in exactly this way
 

5359
01:53:01,320 --> 01:53:03,470
had never been asked in exactly this way
so basically you're looking at the the

5360
01:53:03,470 --> 01:53:03,480
so basically you're looking at the the
 

5361
01:53:03,480 --> 01:53:05,510
so basically you're looking at the the
relationship with the subsequent images

5362
01:53:05,510 --> 01:53:05,520
relationship with the subsequent images
 

5363
01:53:05,520 --> 01:53:07,129
relationship with the subsequent images
the relationship but those are

5364
01:53:07,129 --> 01:53:07,139
the relationship but those are
 

5365
01:53:07,139 --> 01:53:08,629
the relationship but those are
ultimately formed by photons that are

5366
01:53:08,629 --> 01:53:08,639
ultimately formed by photons that are
 

5367
01:53:08,639 --> 01:53:10,790
ultimately formed by photons that are
swirling around the photons that are

5368
01:53:10,790 --> 01:53:10,800
swirling around the photons that are
 

5369
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:13,430
swirling around the photons that are
orbiting so the photon ring are the

5370
01:53:13,430 --> 01:53:13,440
orbiting so the photon ring are the
 

5371
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:16,370
orbiting so the photon ring are the
photons that orbit around and Beyond so

5372
01:53:16,370 --> 01:53:16,380
photons that orbit around and Beyond so
 

5373
01:53:16,380 --> 01:53:18,290
photons that orbit around and Beyond so
like orbit and lose orbit like they are

5374
01:53:18,290 --> 01:53:18,300
like orbit and lose orbit like they are
 

5375
01:53:18,300 --> 01:53:20,649
like orbit and lose orbit like they are
they yeah like so

5376
01:53:20,649 --> 01:53:20,659
they yeah like so
 

5377
01:53:20,659 --> 01:53:23,750
they yeah like so
uh wow and that starts to give you what

5378
01:53:23,750 --> 01:53:23,760
uh wow and that starts to give you what
 

5379
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:24,950
uh wow and that starts to give you what
can you possibly figure out

5380
01:53:24,950 --> 01:53:24,960
can you possibly figure out
 

5381
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:26,629
can you possibly figure out
mathematically about the black hole can

5382
01:53:26,629 --> 01:53:26,639
mathematically about the black hole can
 

5383
01:53:26,639 --> 01:53:28,370
mathematically about the black hole can
you the geometry of it does this

5384
01:53:28,370 --> 01:53:28,380
you the geometry of it does this
 

5385
01:53:28,380 --> 01:53:31,189
you the geometry of it does this
geometry the spin

5386
01:53:31,189 --> 01:53:31,199
geometry the spin
 

5387
01:53:31,199 --> 01:53:34,129
geometry the spin
um and you can verify

5388
01:53:34,129 --> 01:53:34,139
um and you can verify
 

5389
01:53:34,139 --> 01:53:36,830
um and you can verify
things behaving you know we have never

5390
01:53:36,830 --> 01:53:36,840
things behaving you know we have never
 

5391
01:53:36,840 --> 01:53:38,750
things behaving you know we have never
seen

5392
01:53:38,750 --> 01:53:38,760

5393
01:53:38,760 --> 01:53:41,990
seen
a region of space-time

5394
01:53:41,990 --> 01:53:42,000
a region of space-time
 

5395
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,689
a region of space-time
with such high curvature I mean yeah the

5396
01:53:44,689 --> 01:53:44,699
with such high curvature I mean yeah the
 

5397
01:53:44,699 --> 01:53:47,209
with such high curvature I mean yeah the
region around a black hole is crazy it's

5398
01:53:47,209 --> 01:53:47,219
region around a black hole is crazy it's
 

5399
01:53:47,219 --> 01:53:49,010
region around a black hole is crazy it's
not like in this room right the

5400
01:53:49,010 --> 01:53:49,020
not like in this room right the
 

5401
01:53:49,020 --> 01:53:51,290
not like in this room right the
curvature is everything you know you

5402
01:53:51,290 --> 01:53:51,300
curvature is everything you know you
 

5403
01:53:51,300 --> 01:53:52,609
curvature is everything you know you
spend probably enough time with the math

5404
01:53:52,609 --> 01:53:52,619
spend probably enough time with the math
 

5405
01:53:52,619 --> 01:53:54,109
spend probably enough time with the math
and the photons

5406
01:53:54,109 --> 01:53:54,119
and the photons
 

5407
01:53:54,119 --> 01:53:55,790
and the photons
can you

5408
01:53:55,790 --> 01:53:55,800
can you
 

5409
01:53:55,800 --> 01:53:58,310
can you
put yourself in that space so we're like

5410
01:53:58,310 --> 01:53:58,320
put yourself in that space so we're like
 

5411
01:53:58,320 --> 01:54:00,410
put yourself in that space so we're like
having a conversation pretty peaceful

5412
01:54:00,410 --> 01:54:00,420
having a conversation pretty peaceful
 

5413
01:54:00,420 --> 01:54:02,689
having a conversation pretty peaceful
comfortable flat space are you able to

5414
01:54:02,689 --> 01:54:02,699
comfortable flat space are you able to
 

5415
01:54:02,699 --> 01:54:04,910
comfortable flat space are you able to
put yourself in in a place around a

5416
01:54:04,910 --> 01:54:04,920
put yourself in in a place around a
 

5417
01:54:04,920 --> 01:54:07,609
put yourself in in a place around a
black hole yeah I'm able to imagine that

5418
01:54:07,609 --> 01:54:07,619
black hole yeah I'm able to imagine that
 

5419
01:54:07,619 --> 01:54:10,250
black hole yeah I'm able to imagine that
kind of thing yeah so for example and

5420
01:54:10,250 --> 01:54:10,260
kind of thing yeah so for example and
 

5421
01:54:10,260 --> 01:54:12,229
kind of thing yeah so for example and
actually there's a wonderful movie

5422
01:54:12,229 --> 01:54:12,239
actually there's a wonderful movie
 

5423
01:54:12,239 --> 01:54:12,970
actually there's a wonderful movie
um

5424
01:54:12,970 --> 01:54:12,980
um
 

5425
01:54:12,980 --> 01:54:16,430
um
Interstellar yeah and

5426
01:54:16,430 --> 01:54:16,440
Interstellar yeah and
 

5427
01:54:16,440 --> 01:54:17,149
Interstellar yeah and
um

5428
01:54:17,149 --> 01:54:17,159
um
 

5429
01:54:17,159 --> 01:54:20,750
um
in that movie you know Kip Thorne of

5430
01:54:20,750 --> 01:54:20,760
in that movie you know Kip Thorne of
 

5431
01:54:20,760 --> 01:54:22,790
in that movie you know Kip Thorne of
course is a great

5432
01:54:22,790 --> 01:54:22,800
course is a great
 

5433
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:25,010
course is a great
theoretical physicist experimental who

5434
01:54:25,010 --> 01:54:25,020
theoretical physicist experimental who
 

5435
01:54:25,020 --> 01:54:28,070
theoretical physicist experimental who
later won the Nobel Prize

01:54:28,070 --> 01:54:28,080
later won the Nobel Prize
 

5437
01:54:28,080 --> 01:54:31,010
later won the Nobel Prize
um for ligo and

5438
01:54:31,010 --> 01:54:31,020
um for ligo and
 

5439
01:54:31,020 --> 01:54:32,870
um for ligo and
that movie is very accurate

5440
01:54:32,870 --> 01:54:32,880
that movie is very accurate
 

5441
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:34,370
that movie is very accurate
scientifically

5442
01:54:34,370 --> 01:54:34,380
scientifically
 

5443
01:54:34,380 --> 01:54:37,070
scientifically
and there's some funny statements in

5444
01:54:37,070 --> 01:54:37,080
and there's some funny statements in
 

5445
01:54:37,080 --> 01:54:38,689
and there's some funny statements in
there

5446
01:54:38,689 --> 01:54:38,699

you know 100 million people who saw that
 

5453
01:54:44,699 --> 01:54:47,209
you know 100 million people who saw that
movie there can't be more than 10 or 20

movie there can't be more than 10 or 20
understood

5456
01:54:48,729 --> 01:54:48,739
understood
 

5457
01:54:48,739 --> 01:54:52,090
understood
about why Matthew McConaughey is

5458
01:54:52,090 --> 01:54:52,100
about why Matthew McConaughey is
 

5459
01:54:52,100 --> 01:54:54,050
about why Matthew McConaughey is
ejecting the trash in a certain

5460
01:54:54,050 --> 01:54:54,060
ejecting the trash in a certain
 

5461
01:54:54,060 --> 01:54:56,169
ejecting the trash in a certain
direction in order to

direction in order to
 

5463
01:54:56,179 --> 01:54:59,090
direction in order to
but you know for example if I wear a

5464
01:54:59,090 --> 01:54:59,100
but you know for example if I wear a
 

5465
01:54:59,100 --> 01:55:00,770
but you know for example if I wear a
spinning black hole right here if I was

5466
01:55:00,770 --> 01:55:00,780
spinning black hole right here if I was
 

5467
01:55:00,780 --> 01:55:02,330
spinning black hole right here if I was
spinning fast enough

5468
01:55:02,330 --> 01:55:02,340
spinning fast enough
 

5469
01:55:02,340 --> 01:55:05,030
spinning fast enough
you wouldn't be able to stay still there

5470
01:55:05,030 --> 01:55:05,040
you wouldn't be able to stay still there
 

5471
01:55:05,040 --> 01:55:08,149
you wouldn't be able to stay still there
you'd be have to be orbiting around like

5472
01:55:08,149 --> 01:55:08,159
you'd be have to be orbiting around like
 

5473
01:55:08,159 --> 01:55:09,590
you'd be have to be orbiting around like
that you know you'd have to have your

5474
01:55:09,590 --> 01:55:09,600
that you know you'd have to have your
 

5475
01:55:09,600 --> 01:55:12,350
that you know you'd have to have your
microphone on them but I wonder what the

5476
01:55:12,350 --> 01:55:12,360
microphone on them but I wonder what the
 

5477
01:55:12,360 --> 01:55:14,450
microphone on them but I wonder what the
experiences with the actual experience

5478
01:55:14,450 --> 01:55:14,460
experiences with the actual experience
 

5479
01:55:14,460 --> 01:55:16,609
experiences with the actual experience
because I mean space itself is curved

5480
01:55:16,609 --> 01:55:16,619
because I mean space itself is curved
 

5481
01:55:16,619 --> 01:55:18,410
because I mean space itself is curved
well space gets very curved you get

5482
01:55:18,410 --> 01:55:18,420
well space gets very curved you get
 

5483
01:55:18,420 --> 01:55:21,290
well space gets very curved you get
crushed

5484
01:55:21,290 --> 01:55:21,300

 

5485
01:55:21,300 --> 01:55:23,450

you know my body gets ripped apart

5486
01:55:23,450 --> 01:55:23,460
you know my body gets ripped apart
 

5487
01:55:23,460 --> 01:55:25,010
you know my body gets ripped apart
because the forces are different on

5488
01:55:25,010 --> 01:55:25,020
because the forces are different on
 

5489
01:55:25,020 --> 01:55:26,990
because the forces are different on
different parts sure okay so that would

5490
01:55:26,990 --> 01:55:27,000
different parts sure okay so that would
 

5491
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,090
different parts sure okay so that would
be but if but if it can be less curved

5492
01:55:29,090 --> 01:55:29,100
be but if but if it can be less curved
 

5493
01:55:29,100 --> 01:55:30,790
be but if but if it can be less curved
so that the curvature is very noticeable

5494
01:55:30,790 --> 01:55:30,800
so that the curvature is very noticeable
 

5495
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:36,709
so that the curvature is very noticeable
but you're not ripped apart

5496
01:55:36,709 --> 01:55:36,719

 

5497
01:55:36,719 --> 01:55:38,870

the fact that this was just nonchalantly

5498
01:55:38,870 --> 01:55:38,880
the fact that this was just nonchalantly
 

5499
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:42,050
the fact that this was just nonchalantly
stated is is just beautiful like two

5500
01:55:42,050 --> 01:55:42,060
stated is is just beautiful like two
 

5501
01:55:42,060 --> 01:55:45,410
stated is is just beautiful like two
biological systems discussing uh which

5502
01:55:45,410 --> 01:55:45,420
biological systems discussing uh which
 

5503
01:55:45,420 --> 01:55:47,390
biological systems discussing uh which
level of curvature is required to rip

5504
01:55:47,390 --> 01:55:47,400
level of curvature is required to rip
 

5505
01:55:47,400 --> 01:55:51,530
level of curvature is required to rip
apart said biological system very well

5506
01:55:51,530 --> 01:55:51,540
apart said biological system very well
 

5507
01:55:51,540 --> 01:55:53,330
apart said biological system very well
um so you propose in the paper that a

5508
01:55:53,330 --> 01:55:53,340
um so you propose in the paper that a
 

5509
01:55:53,340 --> 01:55:55,370
um so you propose in the paper that a
photon ring of a warped black hole is

5510
01:55:55,370 --> 01:55:55,380
photon ring of a warped black hole is
 

5511
01:55:55,380 --> 01:55:58,609
photon ring of a warped black hole is

uh so what can you Intuit about the

5518
01:56:09,830 --> 01:56:09,840
uh so what can you Intuit about the
 

5519
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:12,649
uh so what can you Intuit about the
hologram

5520

well this paper

5526
01:56:21,890 --> 01:56:21,900
well this paper
 

5527
01:56:21,900 --> 01:56:25,729
well this paper
is exploring a new idea it's not making

is exploring a new idea it's not making
it's not

01:56:27,770 --> 01:56:27,780
it's not
 

5531
01:56:27,780 --> 01:56:32,590
it's not
it's it's not making a new

5532
01:56:32,590 --> 01:56:32,600
it's it's not making a new
 

5533
01:56:32,600 --> 01:56:36,050
it's it's not making a new
Discovery so to speak it's exploring an

5534
01:56:36,050 --> 01:56:36,060
Discovery so to speak it's exploring an
 

5535
01:56:36,060 --> 01:56:38,629
Discovery so to speak it's exploring an
idea and and and

5536
01:56:38,629 --> 01:56:38,639
idea and and and
 

5537
01:56:38,639 --> 01:56:41,570
idea and and and
um the ins and outs of it and and what

5538
01:56:41,570 --> 01:56:41,580
um the ins and outs of it and and what
 

5539
01:56:41,580 --> 01:56:42,890
um the ins and outs of it and and what
might work and

5540
01:56:42,890 --> 01:56:42,900
might work and
 

5541
01:56:42,900 --> 01:56:46,729
might work and
and what might not and this Photon ring

5542
01:56:46,729 --> 01:56:46,739
and what might not and this Photon ring
 

5543
01:56:46,739 --> 01:56:48,770
and what might not and this Photon ring
somehow everybody always thought that

5544
01:56:48,770 --> 01:56:48,780
somehow everybody always thought that
 

5545
01:56:48,780 --> 01:56:51,470
somehow everybody always thought that
the holographic plate sat at the Horizon

5546
01:56:51,470 --> 01:56:51,480
the holographic plate sat at the Horizon
 

5547
01:56:51,480 --> 01:56:53,510
the holographic plate sat at the Horizon
of the black hole right

of the black hole right
 

5549
01:56:53,520 --> 01:56:56,330
of the black hole right
and that the quantum system that

01:57:04,430 --> 01:57:04,440
and it in fact
 

5557
01:57:04,440 --> 01:57:06,229
and it in fact
um we think

5558
01:57:06,229 --> 01:57:06,239
um we think
 

5559
01:57:06,239 --> 01:57:08,270
um we think
it's plausible

5560
01:57:08,270 --> 01:57:08,280
it's plausible
 

5561
01:57:08,280 --> 01:57:11,990
it's plausible
and we give some evidence in some

5562
01:57:11,990 --> 01:57:12,000
and we give some evidence in some
 

5563
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:15,229
and we give some evidence in some
soluble examples in this case in an

01:57:15,229 --> 01:57:15,239
soluble examples in this case in an
 

5565
01:57:15,239 --> 01:57:17,209
soluble examples in this case in an
example in one lower Dimension where we

5566
01:57:17,209 --> 01:57:17,219
example in one lower Dimension where we
 

5567
01:57:17,219 --> 01:57:19,070
example in one lower Dimension where we
can handle the equations better

5568
01:57:19,070 --> 01:57:19,080
can handle the equations better
 

5569
01:57:19,080 --> 01:57:22,609
can handle the equations better
that the quantum system that describes

01:57:22,609 --> 01:57:22,619
that the quantum system that describes

01:57:22,619 --> 01:57:24,950
that the quantum system that describes
the black hole

5572
01:57:24,950 --> 01:57:24,960
the black hole
 

5573
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:27,109
the black hole
should correspond to a region of

5574
01:57:27,109 --> 01:57:27,119
should correspond to a region of
 

5575
01:57:27,119 --> 01:57:30,410
should correspond to a region of
space-time which is includes the photon

ring
 

5579
01:57:31,619 --> 01:57:34,550
ring
so it's bigger hmm

5580
01:57:34,550 --> 01:57:34,560
so it's bigger hmm
 

5581
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:36,890
so it's bigger hmm
so that that would be the holographic

5582
01:57:36,890 --> 01:57:36,900
so that that would be the holographic
 

5583
01:57:36,900 --> 01:57:38,209
so that that would be the holographic
plays so that would be the holographic

5584
01:57:38,209 --> 01:57:38,219

5585
01:57:38,219 --> 01:57:41,149
plays so that would be the holographic
play all of that I mean we didn't prove

5586
01:57:41,149 --> 01:57:41,159
play all of that I mean we didn't prove
 

5587
01:57:41,159 --> 01:57:44,709
play all of that I mean we didn't prove
this we we

5588
01:57:44,709 --> 01:57:44,719
this we we
 

5589
01:57:44,719 --> 01:57:48,050
this we we
we uh you know we put it out there with

5590
01:57:48,050 --> 01:57:48,060
we uh you know we put it out there with
 

5591
01:57:48,060 --> 01:57:50,510
we uh you know we put it out there with
hadn't really been considered previously

5592
01:57:50,510 --> 01:57:50,520
hadn't really been considered previously
 

5593
01:57:50,520 --> 01:57:53,089
hadn't really been considered previously
we put it out there and

01:57:53,089 --> 01:57:53,099
we put it out there and
 

5595
01:57:53,099 --> 01:57:55,970
we put it out there and
um it does seem more plausible than the

5596
01:57:55,970 --> 01:57:55,980
um it does seem more plausible than the
 

5597
01:57:55,980 --> 01:57:58,070
um it does seem more plausible than the
idea that it sits literally at the

5598
01:57:58,070 --> 01:57:58,080
idea that it sits literally at the
 

5599
01:57:58,080 --> 01:58:00,950
idea that it sits literally at the
Horizon and it is a big

5600
01:58:00,950 --> 01:58:00,960
Horizon and it is a big
 

5601
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:05,629
Horizon and it is a big
outstanding problem of of how you have a

5602
01:58:05,629 --> 01:58:05,639
outstanding problem of of how you have a
 

5603
01:58:05,639 --> 01:58:08,450
outstanding problem of of how you have a
holographic reconstruction of black

5604

holographic reconstruction of black
 

5605
01:58:08,460 --> 01:58:10,790

5607
01:58:10,800 --> 01:58:13,189
holes like m87
do you think uh there could be

5608
01:58:13,189 --> 01:58:13,199
do you think uh there could be
 

5609
01:58:13,199 --> 01:58:15,890
do you think uh there could be
experimental further experimental data

5610
01:58:15,890 --> 01:58:15,900
experimental further experimental data
 

5611
01:58:15,900 --> 01:58:17,689
experimental further experimental data
that helps explore some of these ideas

5612
01:58:17,689 --> 01:58:17,699
that helps explore some of these ideas
 

5613
01:58:17,699 --> 01:58:20,089
that helps explore some of these ideas
that you have for Photon rings and

5614
01:58:20,089 --> 01:58:20,099
that you have for Photon rings and
 

5615
01:58:20,099 --> 01:58:22,729
that you have for Photon rings and
holographic plates through Imaging and

5621
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:28,510

more data I wish so but I don't think so
 

5623
01:58:28,520 --> 01:58:32,030
more data I wish so but I don't think so
and but what I think already has

5624
01:58:32,030 --> 01:58:32,040
and but what I think already has
 

5625
01:58:32,040 --> 01:58:34,609
and but what I think already has
happened and will continue happen

5626
01:58:34,609 --> 01:58:34,619
happened and will continue happen
 

5627
01:58:34,619 --> 01:58:38,450
happened and will continue happen
is that the you know there there are

01:58:38,450 --> 01:58:38,460
is that the you know there there are
 

5629
01:58:38,460 --> 01:58:40,910
is that the you know there there are
many different ways that

many different ways that
uh theorists and

uh theorists and
 

5633
01:58:43,639 --> 01:58:46,729
uh theorists and
observers can interact

Observer uh makes a

01:58:59,300 --> 01:59:03,169
Observer uh makes a
discovery and the theorist explains it

5644
01:59:03,169 --> 01:59:03,179
discovery and the theorist explains it
 

5645
01:59:03,179 --> 01:59:05,510
discovery and the theorist explains it
um but there's a lot less than that

5646
01:59:05,510 --> 01:59:05,520
um but there's a lot less than that
 

5647
01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:08,629
um but there's a lot less than that
which is really kind of the bread and

5648
01:59:08,629 --> 01:59:08,639
which is really kind of the bread and
 

5649
01:59:08,639 --> 01:59:11,689
which is really kind of the bread and
butter of those are dramatic moments

in a lifetime moments when that happens
but the bread and butter is more when

but the bread and butter is more when
 

5657

01:59:23,689 --> 01:59:23,699
they came to us and said what what is

01:59:23,699 --> 01:59:25,669
they came to us and said what what is
the interesting theoretical things we

5662
01:59:25,669 --> 01:59:25,679
the interesting theoretical things we
 

5663
01:59:25,679 --> 01:59:27,169
the interesting theoretical things we
can understand

01:59:27,169 --> 01:59:27,179
can understand
 

5665
01:59:27,179 --> 01:59:28,910
can understand
in this

01:59:28,910 --> 01:59:28,920
in this
 

5667
01:59:28,920 --> 01:59:33,050
in this
swirl around the black hole and we give

5668
01:59:33,050 --> 01:59:33,060
swirl around the black hole and we give
 

5669
01:59:33,060 --> 01:59:35,470
swirl around the black hole and we give
an answer and then that

5670
01:59:35,470 --> 01:59:35,480
an answer and then that
 

5671
01:59:35,480 --> 01:59:39,530
an answer and then that
in turn jogged us to

5672
01:59:39,530 --> 01:59:39,540
in turn jogged us to
 

5673
01:59:39,540 --> 01:59:42,169
in turn jogged us to
think about the holographic principle in

5674
01:59:42,169 --> 01:59:42,179
think about the holographic principle in
 

5675
01:59:42,179 --> 01:59:43,669
think about the holographic principle in
the context of

5676
01:59:43,669 --> 01:59:43,679
the context of
 

5677
01:59:43,679 --> 01:59:46,850
the context of
m87 a little bit differently and so it's

5678
01:59:46,850 --> 01:59:46,860
m87 a little bit differently and so it's
 

5679
01:59:46,860 --> 01:59:49,070
m87 a little bit differently and so it's
a useful and in the same vein it's

5680
01:59:49,070 --> 01:59:49,080
a useful and in the same vein it's
 

5681
01:59:49,080 --> 01:59:51,709
a useful and in the same vein it's
useful to talk to the philosophers and

5682
01:59:51,709 --> 01:59:51,719
useful to talk to the philosophers and
 

5683
01:59:51,719 --> 01:59:54,250
useful to talk to the philosophers and
it's useful to talk to the

5684
01:59:54,250 --> 01:59:54,260
it's useful to talk to the
 

5685
01:59:54,260 --> 01:59:58,490
it's useful to talk to the
mathematicians and you know a lot of

5686
01:59:58,490 --> 01:59:58,500
mathematicians and you know a lot of
 

5687
01:59:58,500 --> 02:00:01,669
mathematicians and you know a lot of
you gotta we just gotta you know we

5688
02:00:01,669 --> 02:00:01,679
you gotta we just gotta you know we
 

5689
02:00:01,679 --> 02:00:02,990
you gotta we just gotta you know we
don't know where we're going we just

5690
02:00:02,990 --> 02:00:03,000
don't know where we're going we just
 

5691
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:04,370
don't know where we're going we just
gotta like

5692
02:00:04,370 --> 02:00:04,380
gotta like
 

5693
02:00:04,380 --> 02:00:07,010
gotta like
do everything let me ask you another

5694
02:00:07,010 --> 02:00:07,020
do everything let me ask you another
 

5695
02:00:07,020 --> 02:00:09,649
do everything let me ask you another
sort of philosophical type question but

5696
02:00:09,649 --> 02:00:09,659
sort of philosophical type question but
 

5697
02:00:09,659 --> 02:00:11,149
sort of philosophical type question but
not really actually

5698
02:00:11,149 --> 02:00:11,159
not really actually
 

5699
02:00:11,159 --> 02:00:11,930
not really actually
um

5700
02:00:11,930 --> 02:00:11,940
um
 

5701
02:00:11,940 --> 02:00:14,030
um
it seems that thought experiments are

5702
02:00:14,030 --> 02:00:14,040
it seems that thought experiments are
 

5703
02:00:14,040 --> 02:00:15,589
it seems that thought experiments are
used so it's not just mathematics that

5704
02:00:15,589 --> 02:00:15,599
used so it's not just mathematics that
 

5705
02:00:15,599 --> 02:00:17,149
used so it's not just mathematics that
makes progress in theoretical physics

5706
02:00:17,149 --> 02:00:17,159
makes progress in theoretical physics
 

5707
02:00:17,159 --> 02:00:18,890
makes progress in theoretical physics
but thought experiments too they did for

5708
02:00:18,890 --> 02:00:18,900
but thought experiments too they did for
 

5709
02:00:18,900 --> 02:00:21,890
but thought experiments too they did for
Einstein as well they did for a lot of a

5710
02:00:21,890 --> 02:00:21,900
Einstein as well they did for a lot of a
 

5711
02:00:21,900 --> 02:00:23,390
Einstein as well they did for a lot of a
lot of great physicists throughout

02:00:23,390 --> 02:00:23,400
lot of great physicists throughout
 

5713
02:00:23,400 --> 02:00:26,149
lot of great physicists throughout
history over the years how is your

02:00:26,149 --> 02:00:26,159
history over the years how is your
 

5715
02:00:26,159 --> 02:00:27,589
history over the years how is your
ability to generate thought experiments

5716
02:00:27,589 --> 02:00:27,599
ability to generate thought experiments
 

5717
02:00:27,599 --> 02:00:29,030
ability to generate thought experiments
it's just your intuition about some of

02:00:29,030 --> 02:00:29,040
it's just your intuition about some of
 

5719
02:00:29,040 --> 02:00:30,229
it's just your intuition about some of
these weird

5720
02:00:30,229 --> 02:00:30,239
these weird
 

5721
02:00:30,239 --> 02:00:33,129
these weird
things like quantum mechanics

02:00:33,129 --> 02:00:33,139
things like quantum mechanics
 

5723
02:00:33,139 --> 02:00:35,870

some of which you've asked me but we

some of which you've asked me but we
 

5761
02:01:21,960 --> 02:01:25,850
some of which you've asked me but we
don't have a clue how to solve them

5763
02:01:25,860 --> 02:01:28,250

and when first presented with the

02:01:28,250 --> 02:01:28,260
and when first presented with the
 

5765
02:01:28,260 --> 02:01:29,270

problem
 

5767
02:01:29,280 --> 02:01:32,750

almost every problem is one or the other

almost every problem is one or the other
 

5769
02:01:32,760 --> 02:01:35,390
almost every problem is one or the other
it's it's the jackpot when you find one

02:01:35,390 --> 02:01:35,400
it's it's the jackpot when you find one
 

5771
02:01:35,400 --> 02:01:37,850
it's it's the jackpot when you find one

that isn't one or the other
 

5773
02:01:37,860 --> 02:01:40,490
that isn't one or the other
and it seems like there's a gray area

5774
02:01:40,490 --> 02:01:40,500
and it seems like there's a gray area
 

5775
02:01:40,500 --> 02:01:42,169

between the two right that's where you

well I wouldn't describe it as a gray

happen and then after that I wanted to
 

5827
02:02:40,980 --> 02:02:42,709
happen and then after that I wanted to

know the meaning of life and I realized

02:02:53,420 --> 02:02:56,930

Justice and socialism and World things

5838
02:02:56,930 --> 02:02:56,940
Justice and socialism and World things
 

5839
02:02:56,940 --> 02:02:58,189
Justice and socialism and World things
and

5840
02:02:58,189 --> 02:02:58,199
and
 

5841
02:02:58,199 --> 02:03:02,770
and
couldn't figure those out either and the

5842
02:03:02,770 --> 02:03:02,780
couldn't figure those out either and the
 

5843
02:03:02,780 --> 02:03:06,850
couldn't figure those out either and the
simplest smaller and smaller problems

5844
02:03:06,850 --> 02:03:06,860
simplest smaller and smaller problems
 

5845
02:03:06,860 --> 02:03:09,050
simplest smaller and smaller problems
I mean most of this stuff talking about

5846
02:03:09,050 --> 02:03:09,060
I mean most of this stuff talking about
 

5847
02:03:09,060 --> 02:03:12,109
I mean most of this stuff talking about
adolescence you know but but uh it was

5848
02:03:12,109 --> 02:03:12,119
adolescence you know but but uh it was
 

5849
02:03:12,119 --> 02:03:14,450
adolescence you know but but uh it was
the biggest problem

5850
02:03:14,450 --> 02:03:14,460
the biggest problem
 

5851
02:03:14,460 --> 02:03:17,450
the biggest problem
that I thought that there was uh a

5852
02:03:17,450 --> 02:03:17,460
that I thought that there was uh a
 

5853
02:03:17,460 --> 02:03:18,770
that I thought that there was uh a
prospect of

5854
02:03:18,770 --> 02:03:18,780
prospect of
 

5855
02:03:18,780 --> 02:03:21,410
prospect of
but not a hundred percent you know and I

5856
02:03:21,410 --> 02:03:21,420
but not a hundred percent you know and I
 

5857
02:03:21,420 --> 02:03:22,970
but not a hundred percent you know and I
was definitely

5858
02:03:22,970 --> 02:03:22,980
was definitely
 

5859
02:03:22,980 --> 02:03:25,910
was definitely
ready to

5860
02:03:25,910 --> 02:03:25,920
ready to
 

5861
02:03:25,920 --> 02:03:28,010
ready to
spend my

5862
02:03:28,010 --> 02:03:28,020
spend my
 

5863
02:03:28,020 --> 02:03:30,470
spend my
my life in the wilderness knocking my

5864
02:03:30,470 --> 02:03:30,480
my life in the wilderness knocking my
 

5865
02:03:30,480 --> 02:03:32,330
my life in the wilderness knocking my
head against the wall but

5866
02:03:32,330 --> 02:03:32,340
head against the wall but
 

5867
02:03:32,340 --> 02:03:33,770
head against the wall but
I haven't

5868
02:03:33,770 --> 02:03:33,780
I haven't
 

5869
02:03:33,780 --> 02:03:34,970
I haven't
had to

5870
02:03:34,970 --> 02:03:34,980
had to
 

5871
02:03:34,980 --> 02:03:37,490
had to
I haven't solved them but

5872
02:03:37,490 --> 02:03:37,500
I haven't solved them but
 

5873
02:03:37,500 --> 02:03:39,589
I haven't solved them but
I've said enough interesting things that

5874
02:03:39,589 --> 02:03:39,599
I've said enough interesting things that
 

5875
02:03:39,599 --> 02:03:41,109
I've said enough interesting things that
you're you're you're you're you're

5876
02:03:41,109 --> 02:03:41,119
you're you're you're you're you're
 

5877
02:03:41,119 --> 02:03:43,729
you're you're you're you're you're
interviewing me so so I'm not in the

5878
02:03:43,729 --> 02:03:43,739
interviewing me so so I'm not in the
 

5879
02:03:43,739 --> 02:03:46,550
interviewing me so so I'm not in the
wilderness but yeah so do you remember

5880
02:03:46,550 --> 02:03:46,560
wilderness but yeah so do you remember
 

5881
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:49,189
wilderness but yeah so do you remember
the the early days of if you feel

5882
02:03:49,189 --> 02:03:49,199
the the early days of if you feel
 

5883
02:03:49,199 --> 02:03:51,290
the the early days of if you feel
nostalgic when you think back to the

5884
02:03:51,290 --> 02:03:51,300
nostalgic when you think back to the
 

5885
02:03:51,300 --> 02:03:53,390
nostalgic when you think back to the
ideas the circumstances that let down

5886
02:03:53,390 --> 02:03:53,400
ideas the circumstances that let down
 

5887
02:03:53,400 --> 02:03:55,729
ideas the circumstances that let down
that led you down this

5888
02:03:55,729 --> 02:03:55,739
that led you down this
 

5889
02:03:55,739 --> 02:03:57,109
that led you down this
the path

5890
02:03:57,109 --> 02:03:57,119
the path
 

5891
02:03:57,119 --> 02:03:59,089
the path
towards black holes those theoretical

5892
02:03:59,089 --> 02:03:59,099
towards black holes those theoretical
 

5893
02:03:59,099 --> 02:04:00,649
towards black holes those theoretical
physics doors the tools of physics

5894
02:04:00,649 --> 02:04:00,659
physics doors the tools of physics
 

5895
02:04:00,659 --> 02:04:02,570
physics doors the tools of physics

02:04:05,340 --> 02:04:07,550
theoretical physics
well I wouldn't I wouldn't

5900
02:04:07,550 --> 02:04:07,560
well I wouldn't I wouldn't
 

5901
02:04:07,560 --> 02:04:15,830
well I wouldn't I wouldn't
add Nostalgia to it because

5902
02:04:15,830 --> 02:04:15,840

 

5903
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:19,490

it's not like a

5904
02:04:19,490 --> 02:04:19,500

 

5905
02:04:19,500 --> 02:04:21,229

you know

5906
02:04:21,229 --> 02:04:21,239
you know
 

5907
02:04:21,239 --> 02:04:24,050
you know
a summer in Italy or something it's it's

5908
02:04:24,050 --> 02:04:24,060
a summer in Italy or something it's it's
 

5909
02:04:24,060 --> 02:04:26,030
a summer in Italy or something it's it's
like there there's

5910
02:04:26,030 --> 02:04:26,040
like there there's
 

5911
02:04:26,040 --> 02:04:27,189
like there there's
there's

5912
02:04:27,189 --> 02:04:27,199
there's
 

5913
02:04:27,199 --> 02:04:32,209
there's
results that are there that that people

5914
02:04:32,209 --> 02:04:32,219
results that are there that that people
 

5915
02:04:32,219 --> 02:04:34,430
results that are there that that people
are and that's what's that's what's so

5916
02:04:34,430 --> 02:04:34,440
are and that's what's that's what's so
 

5917
02:04:34,440 --> 02:04:36,350
are and that's what's that's what's so
gratifying

5918
02:04:36,350 --> 02:04:36,360
gratifying
 

5919
02:04:36,360 --> 02:04:39,189
gratifying
I mean of course one's name

5920
02:04:39,189 --> 02:04:39,199
I mean of course one's name
 

5921
02:04:39,199 --> 02:04:41,450
I mean of course one's name
disappears from these

5922
02:04:41,450 --> 02:04:41,460
disappears from these
 

5923
02:04:41,460 --> 02:04:43,129
disappears from these
these things

5924
02:04:43,129 --> 02:04:43,139
these things
 

5925
02:04:43,139 --> 02:04:46,129
these things
um unless you're Einstein or Newton or

5926
02:04:46,129 --> 02:04:46,139
um unless you're Einstein or Newton or
 

5927
02:04:46,139 --> 02:04:48,430
um unless you're Einstein or Newton or
something you're people are not gonna

5928
02:04:48,430 --> 02:04:48,440
something you're people are not gonna
 

5929
02:04:48,440 --> 02:04:52,790
something you're people are not gonna
remember my name in 50 years almost no

5930
02:04:52,790 --> 02:04:52,800
remember my name in 50 years almost no
 

5931
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:54,530
remember my name in 50 years almost no
basically every nail will be forgotten

5932
02:04:54,530 --> 02:04:54,540
basically every nail will be forgotten
 

5933
02:04:54,540 --> 02:04:57,530
basically every nail will be forgotten
in hundreds of years yeah yeah are you

5934
02:04:57,530 --> 02:04:57,540
in hundreds of years yeah yeah are you
 

5935
02:04:57,540 --> 02:04:59,990
in hundreds of years yeah yeah are you
able to by the way

5936
02:04:59,990 --> 02:05:00,000
able to by the way
 

5937
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,270
able to by the way
um love the idea the exploration of

5938
02:05:02,270 --> 02:05:02,280
um love the idea the exploration of
 

5939
02:05:02,280 --> 02:05:04,490
um love the idea the exploration of
ideas themselves without the names yeah

5940
02:05:04,490 --> 02:05:04,500
ideas themselves without the names yeah
 

5941
02:05:04,500 --> 02:05:07,010
ideas themselves without the names yeah
yeah that's what I'm saying so I have

5942
02:05:07,010 --> 02:05:07,020
yeah that's what I'm saying so I have
 

5943
02:05:07,020 --> 02:05:11,330
yeah that's what I'm saying so I have
not I hope someday but I have not

5944
02:05:11,330 --> 02:05:11,340
not I hope someday but I have not
 

5945
02:05:11,340 --> 02:05:13,189
not I hope someday but I have not
um you know there are some experiments

5946
02:05:13,189 --> 02:05:13,199
um you know there are some experiments
 

5947
02:05:13,199 --> 02:05:14,330
um you know there are some experiments
now to

5948
02:05:14,330 --> 02:05:14,340
now to
 

5949
02:05:14,340 --> 02:05:16,850
now to
verify some of my

5950
02:05:16,850 --> 02:05:16,860
verify some of my
 

5951
02:05:16,860 --> 02:05:19,910
verify some of my
predictions about you know properties of

5952
02:05:19,910 --> 02:05:19,920
predictions about you know properties of
 

5953
02:05:19,920 --> 02:05:24,649
predictions about you know properties of
gravity and so on but I I have not like

5954
02:05:24,649 --> 02:05:24,659

 

5955
02:05:24,659 --> 02:05:28,729

you know most of what I've done is in

5956
02:05:28,729 --> 02:05:28,739
you know most of what I've done is in
 

5957
02:05:28,739 --> 02:05:31,729
you know most of what I've done is in
the you know it could happen still it's

5958
02:05:31,729 --> 02:05:31,739
the you know it could happen still it's
 

5959
02:05:31,739 --> 02:05:33,410
the you know it could happen still it's
still a logical possibility that

5960
02:05:33,410 --> 02:05:33,420
still a logical possibility that
 

5961
02:05:33,420 --> 02:05:35,510
still a logical possibility that
everything having to do with string

5962
02:05:35,510 --> 02:05:35,520
everything having to do with string
 

5963
02:05:35,520 --> 02:05:39,169
everything having to do with string
theory and the uh I mean as I as we

5964
02:05:39,169 --> 02:05:39,179
theory and the uh I mean as I as we
 

5965
02:05:39,179 --> 02:05:40,910
theory and the uh I mean as I as we
mentioned I'm betting the farm that it's

5966
02:05:40,910 --> 02:05:40,920
mentioned I'm betting the farm that it's
 

5967
02:05:40,920 --> 02:05:43,970
mentioned I'm betting the farm that it's
not but but it is a lot indeed a logical

5968
02:05:43,970 --> 02:05:43,980
not but but it is a lot indeed a logical
 

5969
02:05:43,980 --> 02:05:46,910
not but but it is a lot indeed a logical
possibility that that people always say

5970
02:05:46,910 --> 02:05:46,920
possibility that that people always say
 

5971
02:05:46,920 --> 02:05:48,709
possibility that that people always say
can you believe

5972
02:05:48,709 --> 02:05:48,719
can you believe
 

5973
02:05:48,719 --> 02:05:52,370
can you believe
Lex Fred men interviewed Elon Musk and

this working on this theory that just
 

5983
02:05:59,940 --> 02:06:02,149
this working on this theory that just
completely went into the yeah it

5984
02:06:02,149 --> 02:06:02,159
completely went into the yeah it
 

5985
02:06:02,159 --> 02:06:03,890
completely went into the yeah it
completely went into the toilet you know

5986
02:06:03,890 --> 02:06:03,900
completely went into the toilet you know
 

5987
02:06:03,900 --> 02:06:06,830
completely went into the toilet you know
I'm gonna make I'm gonna get uh with a

I'm gonna make I'm gonna get uh with a
 

5989

I'm gonna make I'm gonna get uh with a
wife I don't have I'm gonna make a

02:06:08,030 --> 02:06:08,040
wife I don't have I'm gonna make a
 

5991

public statement she'll be on stage I'll

public statement she'll be on stage I'll
 

5993
02:06:09,599 --> 02:06:11,450
public statement she'll be on stage I'll
say I'm really sorry I made this giant

5994
02:06:11,450 --> 02:06:11,460
say I'm really sorry I made this giant
 

5995
02:06:11,460 --> 02:06:12,950
say I'm really sorry I made this giant
mistake

5996
02:06:12,950 --> 02:06:12,960
mistake
 

5997
02:06:12,960 --> 02:06:16,850
mistake
of platforming this wild-eyed physicist

02:06:16,850 --> 02:06:16,860
of platforming this wild-eyed physicist
 

5999
02:06:16,860 --> 02:06:19,490
of platforming this wild-eyed physicist
that believed for decades in the power

6000
02:06:19,490 --> 02:06:19,500
that believed for decades in the power
 

6001
02:06:19,500 --> 02:06:22,430
that believed for decades in the power
of theoretical physics yes no like you

6002
02:06:22,430 --> 02:06:22,440
of theoretical physics yes no like you
 

6003
02:06:22,440 --> 02:06:24,410
of theoretical physics yes no like you
said so that could happen it could

6004
02:06:24,410 --> 02:06:24,420
said so that could happen it could
 

6005
02:06:24,420 --> 02:06:26,330
said so that could happen it could
happen it could happen it's it's in the

6006
02:06:26,330 --> 02:06:26,340
happen it could happen it's it's in the
 

6007
02:06:26,340 --> 02:06:28,010
happen it could happen it's it's in the
and of course if that couldn't happen

6008
02:06:28,010 --> 02:06:28,020
and of course if that couldn't happen
 

6009
02:06:28,020 --> 02:06:30,050
and of course if that couldn't happen
yeah it wouldn't be real exploration

6010
02:06:30,050 --> 02:06:30,060
yeah it wouldn't be real exploration
 

6011
02:06:30,060 --> 02:06:33,770
yeah it wouldn't be real exploration
right absolutely and um

6012
02:06:33,770 --> 02:06:33,780
right absolutely and um
 

6013
02:06:33,780 --> 02:06:37,790
right absolutely and um
so but I I you know I do take a lot of

6014
02:06:37,790 --> 02:06:37,800
so but I I you know I do take a lot of
 

6015
02:06:37,800 --> 02:06:40,609
so but I I you know I do take a lot of
satisfaction that some of the things I

6016
02:06:40,609 --> 02:06:40,619
satisfaction that some of the things I
 

6017
02:06:40,619 --> 02:06:42,290
satisfaction that some of the things I
discovered are

6018
02:06:42,290 --> 02:06:42,300
discovered are
 

6019
02:06:42,300 --> 02:06:45,410
discovered are
at the minimum mathematical truths and

6020
02:06:45,410 --> 02:06:45,420
at the minimum mathematical truths and
 

6021
02:06:45,420 --> 02:06:48,109
at the minimum mathematical truths and
they're still so you don't have that

6022
02:06:48,109 --> 02:06:48,119
they're still so you don't have that
 

6023
02:06:48,119 --> 02:06:50,930
they're still so you don't have that
sort of nostalgic feeling of it being

6024
02:06:50,930 --> 02:06:50,940
sort of nostalgic feeling of it being
 

6025
02:06:50,940 --> 02:06:53,209
sort of nostalgic feeling of it being
something that was

6026
02:06:53,209 --> 02:06:53,219
something that was
 

6027
02:06:53,219 --> 02:06:56,750
something that was
gone and and uh and I'm still making

6028
02:06:56,750 --> 02:06:56,760
gone and and uh and I'm still making
 

6029
02:06:56,760 --> 02:06:58,310
gone and and uh and I'm still making
discoveries

6030
02:06:58,310 --> 02:06:58,320
discoveries
 

6031
02:06:58,320 --> 02:07:02,030
discoveries
now that I'm as excited about we'll see

6032
02:07:02,030 --> 02:07:02,040
now that I'm as excited about we'll see
 

6033
02:07:02,040 --> 02:07:03,410
now that I'm as excited about we'll see
if they

6034
02:07:03,410 --> 02:07:03,420
if they
 

6035
02:07:03,420 --> 02:07:06,050
if they
hold the test of time that

6036
02:07:06,050 --> 02:07:06,060
hold the test of time that
 

6037
02:07:06,060 --> 02:07:08,810
hold the test of time that
that stand the test of time that these

6038
02:07:08,810 --> 02:07:08,820
that stand the test of time that these
 

6039
02:07:08,820 --> 02:07:10,669
that stand the test of time that these
other ones did that but that I'm as

6040
02:07:10,669 --> 02:07:10,679
other ones did that but that I'm as
 

6041
02:07:10,679 --> 02:07:12,530
other ones did that but that I'm as
excited about as I

6042
02:07:12,530 --> 02:07:12,540
excited about as I
 

6043
02:07:12,540 --> 02:07:16,010
excited about as I
was about those when I when I when I

6044
02:07:16,010 --> 02:07:16,020
was about those when I when I when I
 

6045
02:07:16,020 --> 02:07:18,109
was about those when I when I when I
made them I am easily excitable as my

6046
02:07:18,109 --> 02:07:18,119
made them I am easily excitable as my
 

6047
02:07:18,119 --> 02:07:19,490
made them I am easily excitable as my
friends will tell you well one

6048
02:07:19,490 --> 02:07:19,500
friends will tell you well one
 

6049
02:07:19,500 --> 02:07:21,109
friends will tell you well one
interesting thing about you is and I

6050
02:07:21,109 --> 02:07:21,119
interesting thing about you is and I
 

6051
02:07:21,119 --> 02:07:22,250
interesting thing about you is and I
have been very excited about things

6052
02:07:22,250 --> 02:07:22,260
have been very excited about things
 

6053
02:07:22,260 --> 02:07:23,629
have been very excited about things
which turned out to be completely wrong

6054
02:07:23,629 --> 02:07:23,639
which turned out to be completely wrong
 

6055
02:07:23,639 --> 02:07:25,729
which turned out to be completely wrong
you know well that's the the excitement

6056
02:07:25,729 --> 02:07:25,739
you know well that's the the excitement
 

6057
02:07:25,739 --> 02:07:28,010
you know well that's the the excitement
is a precondition for uh for

6058
02:07:28,010 --> 02:07:28,020
is a precondition for uh for
 

6059
02:07:28,020 --> 02:07:29,270
is a precondition for uh for
breakthroughs

6060
02:07:29,270 --> 02:07:29,280
breakthroughs
 

6061
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:31,310
breakthroughs
um but you're also somebody like just

6062
02:07:31,310 --> 02:07:31,320
um but you're also somebody like just
 

6063
02:07:31,320 --> 02:07:33,410
um but you're also somebody like just
like you said you don't have a cynical

6064
02:07:33,410 --> 02:07:33,420
like you said you don't have a cynical
 

6065
02:07:33,420 --> 02:07:36,589
like you said you don't have a cynical
view of the modern state of physics so

6066
02:07:36,589 --> 02:07:36,599
view of the modern state of physics so
 

6067
02:07:36,599 --> 02:07:38,390
view of the modern state of physics so
so there's a lot of people that glorify

6068
02:07:38,390 --> 02:07:38,400
so there's a lot of people that glorify
 

6069
02:07:38,400 --> 02:07:40,070
so there's a lot of people that glorify
like the early days of string theory and

6070
02:07:40,070 --> 02:07:40,080
like the early days of string theory and
 

6071
02:07:40,080 --> 02:07:42,189
like the early days of string theory and
that you know all these yeah

6072
02:07:42,189 --> 02:07:42,199
that you know all these yeah
 

6073
02:07:42,199 --> 02:07:44,870
that you know all these yeah
yeah yeah but you're saying like this

6074
02:07:44,870 --> 02:07:44,880
yeah yeah but you're saying like this
 

6075
02:07:44,880 --> 02:07:49,070
yeah yeah but you're saying like this
this to you uh might be one of if not

6076
02:07:49,070 --> 02:07:49,080
this to you uh might be one of if not
 

6077
02:07:49,080 --> 02:07:50,930
this to you uh might be one of if not
the most exciting times to be a

6078
02:07:50,930 --> 02:07:50,940
the most exciting times to be a
 

6079
02:07:50,940 --> 02:07:53,570
the most exciting times to be a
theoretical physicist like uh when uh

6080
02:07:53,570 --> 02:07:53,580
theoretical physicist like uh when uh
 

6081
02:07:53,580 --> 02:07:55,669
theoretical physicist like uh when uh
the alien civilizations 500 years from

6082
02:07:55,669 --> 02:07:55,679
the alien civilizations 500 years from
 

6083
02:07:55,679 --> 02:07:57,830
the alien civilizations 500 years from
now that visit Earth will look back

6084
02:07:57,830 --> 02:07:57,840
now that visit Earth will look back
 

6085
02:07:57,840 --> 02:08:00,229
now that visit Earth will look back
they'll think the 21st century some of

6086
02:08:00,229 --> 02:08:00,239
they'll think the 21st century some of
 

6087
02:08:00,239 --> 02:08:01,669
they'll think the 21st century some of
the biggest discoveries ever were made

6088
02:08:01,669 --> 02:08:01,679
the biggest discoveries ever were made
 

6089
02:08:01,679 --> 02:08:03,530
the biggest discoveries ever were made
in the 21st and they have a when they

6090
02:08:03,530 --> 02:08:03,540
in the 21st and they have a when they
 

6091
02:08:03,540 --> 02:08:05,209
in the 21st and they have a when they
have a measurement of string theory the

6092
02:08:05,209 --> 02:08:05,219
have a measurement of string theory the
 

6093
02:08:05,219 --> 02:08:07,629
have a measurement of string theory the
fund's over

6094
02:08:07,629 --> 02:08:07,639
fund's over
 

6095
02:08:07,639 --> 02:08:09,770
fund's over
then we have to go on to something new

6096
02:08:09,770 --> 02:08:09,780
then we have to go on to something new
 

6097
02:08:09,780 --> 02:08:11,810
then we have to go on to something new
you know no there's deep there's oh

6098
02:08:11,810 --> 02:08:11,820
you know no there's deep there's oh
 

6099
02:08:11,820 --> 02:08:14,990
you know no there's deep there's oh
there's going to be the fun is over oh

6100
02:08:14,990 --> 02:08:15,000
there's going to be the fun is over oh
 

6101
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:15,770
there's going to be the fun is over oh
man

6102
02:08:15,770 --> 02:08:15,780
man
 

6103
02:08:15,780 --> 02:08:17,450
man
um but there is an end to the Nile right

6104
02:08:17,450 --> 02:08:17,460
um but there is an end to the Nile right
 

6105
02:08:17,460 --> 02:08:19,870
um but there is an end to the Nile right
I mean there that's there's is there

6106
02:08:19,870 --> 02:08:19,880
I mean there that's there's is there
 

6107
02:08:19,880 --> 02:08:22,030
I mean there that's there's is there
who told you

6108
02:08:22,030 --> 02:08:22,040
who told you
 

6109
02:08:22,040 --> 02:08:27,410
who told you
some Weber guy uh uh let me let me ask

6110
02:08:27,410 --> 02:08:27,420
some Weber guy uh uh let me let me ask
 

6111
02:08:27,420 --> 02:08:29,209
some Weber guy uh uh let me let me ask
you another trippy out there question uh

6112
02:08:29,209 --> 02:08:29,219
you another trippy out there question uh
 

6113
02:08:29,219 --> 02:08:33,109
you another trippy out there question uh
so uh again perhaps unanswerable from a

6114
02:08:33,109 --> 02:08:33,119
so uh again perhaps unanswerable from a
 

6115
02:08:33,119 --> 02:08:34,790
so uh again perhaps unanswerable from a
physics perspective but do you wonder

6116
02:08:34,790 --> 02:08:34,800
physics perspective but do you wonder
 

6117
02:08:34,800 --> 02:08:36,770
physics perspective but do you wonder
about

6118
02:08:36,770 --> 02:08:36,780
about
 

6119
02:08:36,780 --> 02:08:39,229
about
um alien civilizations do you wonder

6120
02:08:39,229 --> 02:08:39,239
um alien civilizations do you wonder
 

6121
02:08:39,239 --> 02:08:40,189
um alien civilizations do you wonder
about

6122
02:08:40,189 --> 02:08:40,199
about
 

6123
02:08:40,199 --> 02:08:42,169
about
other intelligent beings out there

6124
02:08:42,169 --> 02:08:42,179
other intelligent beings out there
 

6125
02:08:42,179 --> 02:08:44,030
other intelligent beings out there
making up their own math and physics

6126
02:08:44,030 --> 02:08:44,040
making up their own math and physics
 

6127
02:08:44,040 --> 02:08:45,890
making up their own math and physics
trying to figure out the world do you

6128
02:08:45,890 --> 02:08:45,900
trying to figure out the world do you
 

6129
02:08:45,900 --> 02:08:49,010
trying to figure out the world do you
think they're they're out there

6130
02:08:49,010 --> 02:08:49,020

 

6131
02:08:49,020 --> 02:08:52,750

it is hard to understand

6132
02:08:52,750 --> 02:08:52,760
it is hard to understand
 

6133
02:08:52,760 --> 02:08:55,310
it is hard to understand
why there were given that there's so

6134
02:08:55,310 --> 02:08:55,320
why there were given that there's so
 

6135
02:08:55,320 --> 02:08:57,410
why there were given that there's so
many planets and of course there's

6136
02:08:57,410 --> 02:08:57,420
many planets and of course there's
 

6137
02:08:57,420 --> 02:08:59,990
many planets and of course there's
Drake's formula and we don't exactly

6138
02:08:59,990 --> 02:09:00,000
Drake's formula and we don't exactly
 

6139
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:01,430
Drake's formula and we don't exactly
know what the

6140
02:09:01,430 --> 02:09:01,440
know what the
 

6141
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:05,149
know what the
but I mean I think fermi's Paradox that

6142
02:09:05,149 --> 02:09:05,159
but I mean I think fermi's Paradox that
 

6143
02:09:05,159 --> 02:09:06,229
but I mean I think fermi's Paradox that
you know

6144
02:09:06,229 --> 02:09:06,239
you know
 

6145
02:09:06,239 --> 02:09:08,570
you know
is a real Paradox and

6146
02:09:08,570 --> 02:09:08,580
is a real Paradox and
 

6147
02:09:08,580 --> 02:09:10,250
is a real Paradox and
I

6148
02:09:10,250 --> 02:09:10,260
I
 

6149
02:09:10,260 --> 02:09:12,589
I
I think they're

6150
02:09:12,589 --> 02:09:12,599
I think they're
 

6151
02:09:12,599 --> 02:09:15,649
I think they're
there probably are and I think it's very

6152
02:09:15,649 --> 02:09:15,659
there probably are and I think it's very
 

6153
02:09:15,659 --> 02:09:18,470
there probably are and I think it's very
exciting that uh

6154
02:09:18,470 --> 02:09:18,480
exciting that uh
 

6155
02:09:18,480 --> 02:09:22,490
exciting that uh
you know we might you know find some

6156
02:09:22,490 --> 02:09:22,500
you know we might you know find some
 

6157
02:09:22,500 --> 02:09:25,550
you know we might you know find some
it's it's a logical possibility that we

6158
02:09:25,550 --> 02:09:25,560
it's it's a logical possibility that we
 

6159
02:09:25,560 --> 02:09:27,290
it's it's a logical possibility that we
could learn about it I mean to me it's

6160
02:09:27,290 --> 02:09:27,300
could learn about it I mean to me it's
 

6161
02:09:27,300 --> 02:09:29,030
could learn about it I mean to me it's
super interesting to think about aliens

6162
02:09:29,030 --> 02:09:29,040
super interesting to think about aliens
 

6163
02:09:29,040 --> 02:09:31,910
super interesting to think about aliens
from a perspective of physics because so

6164
02:09:31,910 --> 02:09:31,920
from a perspective of physics because so
 

6165
02:09:31,920 --> 02:09:33,830
from a perspective of physics because so
any intelligent civilization is going to

6166
02:09:33,830 --> 02:09:33,840
any intelligent civilization is going to
 

6167
02:09:33,840 --> 02:09:36,830
any intelligent civilization is going to
be contending with the ideas but you're

6168
02:09:36,830 --> 02:09:36,840
be contending with the ideas but you're
 

6169
02:09:36,840 --> 02:09:39,050
be contending with the ideas but you're
trying to understand the world around it

6170
02:09:39,050 --> 02:09:39,060
trying to understand the world around it
 

6171
02:09:39,060 --> 02:09:42,350
trying to understand the world around it
so I think that the alien I think that

6172
02:09:42,350 --> 02:09:42,360
so I think that the alien I think that
 

6173
02:09:42,360 --> 02:09:44,149
so I think that the alien I think that
the universe is filled with alien

6174
02:09:44,149 --> 02:09:44,159
the universe is filled with alien
 

6175
02:09:44,159 --> 02:09:46,189
the universe is filled with alien
civilizations so they're all have their

6176
02:09:46,189 --> 02:09:46,199
civilizations so they're all have their
 

6177
02:09:46,199 --> 02:09:48,470
civilizations so they're all have their
physicists right they all have their

6178
02:09:48,470 --> 02:09:48,480
physicists right they all have their
 

6179
02:09:48,480 --> 02:09:49,910
physicists right they all have their
they're all trying to understand the

6180
02:09:49,910 --> 02:09:49,920
they're all trying to understand the
 

6181
02:09:49,920 --> 02:09:51,350
they're all trying to understand the
world around them and it's just

6182
02:09:51,350 --> 02:09:51,360
world around them and it's just
 

6183
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:53,209
world around them and it's just
interesting to me to imagine all these

6184
02:09:53,209 --> 02:09:53,219
interesting to me to imagine all these
 

6185
02:09:53,219 --> 02:09:54,589
interesting to me to imagine all these
different perspectives all these

6186
02:09:54,589 --> 02:09:54,599
different perspectives all these
 

6187
02:09:54,599 --> 02:09:56,930
different perspectives all these
different Einsteins yeah like trying to

6188
02:09:56,930 --> 02:09:56,940
different Einsteins yeah like trying to
 

6189
02:09:56,940 --> 02:09:58,550
different Einsteins yeah like trying to
make sense of like though they might be

6190
02:09:58,550 --> 02:09:58,560
make sense of like though they might be
 

6191
02:09:58,560 --> 02:10:01,370
make sense of like though they might be
more different than we think they might

6192
02:10:01,370 --> 02:10:01,380
more different than we think they might
 

6193
02:10:01,380 --> 02:10:03,229
more different than we think they might
be different in a way that we haven't

6194
02:10:03,229 --> 02:10:03,239
be different in a way that we haven't
 

6195
02:10:03,239 --> 02:10:05,689
be different in a way that we haven't
even thought of like smarter or

6196
02:10:05,689 --> 02:10:05,699
even thought of like smarter or
 

6197
02:10:05,699 --> 02:10:06,770
even thought of like smarter or
different

6198
02:10:06,770 --> 02:10:06,780
different
 

6199
02:10:06,780 --> 02:10:08,930
different
just just different something that we

6200
02:10:08,930 --> 02:10:08,940
just just different something that we
 

6201
02:10:08,940 --> 02:10:10,310
just just different something that we
don't even we're not even able to

6202
02:10:10,310 --> 02:10:10,320
don't even we're not even able to
 

6203
02:10:10,320 --> 02:10:12,770
don't even we're not even able to
describe now we just haven't thought

6204
02:10:12,770 --> 02:10:12,780
describe now we just haven't thought
 

6205
02:10:12,780 --> 02:10:14,570
describe now we just haven't thought
about it you know man

6206
02:10:14,570 --> 02:10:14,580
about it you know man
 

6207
02:10:14,580 --> 02:10:16,430
about it you know man
yeah this is a really frustrating thing

6208
02:10:16,430 --> 02:10:16,440
yeah this is a really frustrating thing
 

6209
02:10:16,440 --> 02:10:19,189
yeah this is a really frustrating thing
when we think from uh me as an AI person

6210
02:10:19,189 --> 02:10:19,199
when we think from uh me as an AI person
 

6211
02:10:19,199 --> 02:10:20,390
when we think from uh me as an AI person
you start to think about what is

6212
02:10:20,390 --> 02:10:20,400
you start to think about what is
 

6213
02:10:20,400 --> 02:10:23,030
you start to think about what is
intelligence which is consciousness you

6214
02:10:23,030 --> 02:10:23,040
intelligence which is consciousness you
 

6215
02:10:23,040 --> 02:10:26,810
intelligence which is consciousness you
start to sometimes again uh night

6216
02:10:26,810 --> 02:10:26,820
start to sometimes again uh night
 

6217
02:10:26,820 --> 02:10:30,169
start to sometimes again uh night
evening thoughts is um

6218
02:10:30,169 --> 02:10:30,179
evening thoughts is um
 

6219
02:10:30,179 --> 02:10:32,689
evening thoughts is um
how little we understand how narrow our

6220
02:10:32,689 --> 02:10:32,699
how little we understand how narrow our
 

6221
02:10:32,699 --> 02:10:35,089
how little we understand how narrow our
thinking is about these Concepts yeah

6222
02:10:35,089 --> 02:10:35,099
thinking is about these Concepts yeah
 

6223
02:10:35,099 --> 02:10:38,750
thinking is about these Concepts yeah
yeah that that it could be intelligence

6224
02:10:38,750 --> 02:10:38,760
yeah that that it could be intelligence
 

6225
02:10:38,760 --> 02:10:42,290
yeah that that it could be intelligence
could be something could be intelligent

6226
02:10:42,290 --> 02:10:42,300
could be something could be intelligent
 

6227
02:10:42,300 --> 02:10:45,229
could be something could be intelligent
and be very different intelligent in a

6228
02:10:45,229 --> 02:10:45,239
and be very different intelligent in a
 

6229
02:10:45,239 --> 02:10:47,149
and be very different intelligent in a
very different way they won't be able to

6230
02:10:47,149 --> 02:10:47,159
very different way they won't be able to
 

6231
02:10:47,159 --> 02:10:49,550
very different way they won't be able to
detect because we're not keeping an open

6232
02:10:49,550 --> 02:10:49,560
detect because we're not keeping an open
 

6233
02:10:49,560 --> 02:10:52,910
detect because we're not keeping an open
mind open enough mind

6234
02:10:52,910 --> 02:10:52,920
mind open enough mind
 

6235
02:10:52,920 --> 02:10:55,189
mind open enough mind
and that's kind of sad because to me

6236
02:10:55,189 --> 02:10:55,199
and that's kind of sad because to me
 

6237
02:10:55,199 --> 02:10:56,810
and that's kind of sad because to me
there's also just a strong possibility

6238
02:10:56,810 --> 02:10:56,820
there's also just a strong possibility
 

6239
02:10:56,820 --> 02:10:59,390
there's also just a strong possibility
that aliens or something like alien

6240
02:10:59,390 --> 02:10:59,400
that aliens or something like alien
 

6241
02:10:59,400 --> 02:11:01,910
that aliens or something like alien
intelligence or some

6242
02:11:01,910 --> 02:11:01,920
intelligence or some
 

6243
02:11:01,920 --> 02:11:05,209
intelligence or some
fascinating beautiful physical phenomena

6244
02:11:05,209 --> 02:11:05,219
fascinating beautiful physical phenomena
 

6245
02:11:05,219 --> 02:11:07,669
fascinating beautiful physical phenomena
are all around us

6246
02:11:07,669 --> 02:11:07,679
are all around us
 

6247
02:11:07,679 --> 02:11:09,830
are all around us
and we're too dumb to see it

6248
02:11:09,830 --> 02:11:09,840
and we're too dumb to see it
 

6249
02:11:09,840 --> 02:11:11,330
and we're too dumb to see it
for now

6250
02:11:11,330 --> 02:11:11,340
for now
 

6251
02:11:11,340 --> 02:11:14,689
for now
or to close-minded to see it

6252
02:11:14,689 --> 02:11:14,699
or to close-minded to see it
 

6253
02:11:14,699 --> 02:11:16,129
or to close-minded to see it
there's something we're just deeply

6254
02:11:16,129 --> 02:11:16,139
there's something we're just deeply
 

6255
02:11:16,139 --> 02:11:18,169
there's something we're just deeply
missing whether it's uh like fundamental

6256
02:11:18,169 --> 02:11:18,179
missing whether it's uh like fundamental
 

6257
02:11:18,179 --> 02:11:19,850
missing whether it's uh like fundamental
limitations of our cognitive abilities

6258
02:11:19,850 --> 02:11:19,860
limitations of our cognitive abilities
 

6259
02:11:19,860 --> 02:11:22,729
limitations of our cognitive abilities
or just because our tools are too

6260
02:11:22,729 --> 02:11:22,739
or just because our tools are too
 

6261
02:11:22,739 --> 02:11:24,109
or just because our tools are too
primitive right now

6262
02:11:24,109 --> 02:11:24,119
primitive right now
 

6263
02:11:24,119 --> 02:11:26,390
primitive right now
or like the way we it's like you said

6264
02:11:26,390 --> 02:11:26,400
or like the way we it's like you said
 

6265
02:11:26,400 --> 02:11:27,530
or like the way we it's like you said
like uh

6266
02:11:27,530 --> 02:11:27,540
like uh
 

6267
02:11:27,540 --> 02:11:29,570
like uh
the idea seemed trivial once you figure

6268
02:11:29,570 --> 02:11:29,580
the idea seemed trivial once you figure
 

6269
02:11:29,580 --> 02:11:35,330
the idea seemed trivial once you figure
it all out looking back yeah but

6270
02:11:35,330 --> 02:11:35,340
it all out looking back yeah but
 

6271
02:11:35,340 --> 02:11:37,129
it all out looking back yeah but
that kind of makes me sad because there

6272
02:11:37,129 --> 02:11:37,139
that kind of makes me sad because there
 

6273
02:11:37,139 --> 02:11:38,390
that kind of makes me sad because there
could be so much Beauty in the world

6274
02:11:38,390 --> 02:11:38,400
could be so much Beauty in the world
 

6275
02:11:38,400 --> 02:11:40,430
could be so much Beauty in the world
we're not seeing

6276
02:11:40,430 --> 02:11:40,440
we're not seeing
 

6277
02:11:40,440 --> 02:11:42,890
we're not seeing
because we're too dumb there surely is

6278
02:11:42,890 --> 02:11:42,900
because we're too dumb there surely is
 

6279
02:11:42,900 --> 02:11:44,810
because we're too dumb there surely is
and that's I guess the process of

6280
02:11:44,810 --> 02:11:44,820
and that's I guess the process of
 

6281
02:11:44,820 --> 02:11:46,550
and that's I guess the process of
Science and physics is to keep exploring

6282
02:11:46,550 --> 02:11:46,560
Science and physics is to keep exploring
 

6283
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:49,609
Science and physics is to keep exploring
to keep exploring

6284
02:11:49,609 --> 02:11:49,619
to keep exploring
 

6285
02:11:49,619 --> 02:11:51,830
to keep exploring
to find the thing that will uh in a

6286
02:11:51,830 --> 02:11:51,840
to find the thing that will uh in a
 

6287
02:11:51,840 --> 02:11:53,810
to find the thing that will uh in a
century seem obvious

6288
02:11:53,810 --> 02:11:53,820
century seem obvious
 

6289
02:11:53,820 --> 02:11:56,450
century seem obvious
well it's something we know for sure I

6290
02:11:56,450 --> 02:11:56,460
well it's something we know for sure I
 

6291
02:11:56,460 --> 02:11:58,550
well it's something we know for sure I
mean the brain we don't

6292
02:11:58,550 --> 02:11:58,560
mean the brain we don't
 

6293
02:11:58,560 --> 02:12:01,550
mean the brain we don't
really understand and that's got to base

6294
02:12:01,550 --> 02:12:01,560
really understand and that's got to base
 

6295
02:12:01,560 --> 02:12:02,930
really understand and that's got to base
some

6296
02:12:02,930 --> 02:12:02,940
some
 

6297
02:12:02,940 --> 02:12:06,290
some
fabulously beautiful story that uh I'm

6298
02:12:06,290 --> 02:12:06,300
fabulously beautiful story that uh I'm
 

6299
02:12:06,300 --> 02:12:08,689
fabulously beautiful story that uh I'm
hoping some of that story will be

6300
02:12:08,689 --> 02:12:08,699
hoping some of that story will be
 

6301
02:12:08,699 --> 02:12:10,370
hoping some of that story will be
written through the process of trying to

6302
02:12:10,370 --> 02:12:10,380
written through the process of trying to
 

6303
02:12:10,380 --> 02:12:12,169
written through the process of trying to
build a brain so the process of

6304
02:12:12,169 --> 02:12:12,179
build a brain so the process of
 

6305
02:12:12,179 --> 02:12:14,870
build a brain so the process of
engineering intelligence not just the

6306
02:12:14,870 --> 02:12:14,880
engineering intelligence not just the
 

6307
02:12:14,880 --> 02:12:16,370
engineering intelligence not just the
neuroscience perspective of just looking

6308
02:12:16,370 --> 02:12:16,380
neuroscience perspective of just looking
 

6309
02:12:16,380 --> 02:12:19,250
neuroscience perspective of just looking
at the brain but trying to create it

6310
02:12:19,250 --> 02:12:19,260
at the brain but trying to create it
 

6311
02:12:19,260 --> 02:12:21,410
at the brain but trying to create it
uh

6312
02:12:21,410 --> 02:12:21,420
uh
 

6313
02:12:21,420 --> 02:12:23,750
uh
but yeah that story hasn't been written

6314
02:12:23,750 --> 02:12:23,760
but yeah that story hasn't been written
 

6315
02:12:23,760 --> 02:12:26,270
but yeah that story hasn't been written
almost at all which is the early days of

6316
02:12:26,270 --> 02:12:26,280
almost at all which is the early days of
 

6317
02:12:26,280 --> 02:12:27,950
almost at all which is the early days of
figuring that one out but see like you

6318
02:12:27,950 --> 02:12:27,960
figuring that one out but see like you
 

6319
02:12:27,960 --> 02:12:30,770
figuring that one out but see like you
said that math is discovered so

6320
02:12:30,770 --> 02:12:30,780
said that math is discovered so
 

6321
02:12:30,780 --> 02:12:32,990
said that math is discovered so
um aliens should at least have the same

6322
02:12:32,990 --> 02:12:33,000
um aliens should at least have the same
 

6323
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:34,850
um aliens should at least have the same
math as us

6324
02:12:34,850 --> 02:12:34,860
math as us
 

6325
02:12:34,860 --> 02:12:38,030
math as us
right I think so maybe different symbols

6326
02:12:38,030 --> 02:12:38,040
right I think so maybe different symbols
 

6327
02:12:38,040 --> 02:12:39,589
right I think so maybe different symbols
oh well they might have discovered

6328
02:12:39,589 --> 02:12:39,599
oh well they might have discovered
 

6329
02:12:39,599 --> 02:12:41,030
oh well they might have discovered
different

6330
02:12:41,030 --> 02:12:41,040
different
 

6331
02:12:41,040 --> 02:12:42,890
different
they might have discovered it

6332
02:12:42,890 --> 02:12:42,900
they might have discovered it
 

6333
02:12:42,900 --> 02:12:44,390
they might have discovered it
differently

6334
02:12:44,390 --> 02:12:44,400
differently
 

6335
02:12:44,400 --> 02:12:47,510
differently
and they might have had a different idea

6336
02:12:47,510 --> 02:12:47,520
and they might have had a different idea
 

6337
02:12:47,520 --> 02:12:51,550
and they might have had a different idea
of what a proof is

6338
02:12:51,550 --> 02:12:51,560

 

6339
02:12:51,560 --> 02:12:55,550

sure yeah we're very uh we're very like

6340
02:12:55,550 --> 02:12:55,560
sure yeah we're very uh we're very like
 

6341
02:12:55,560 --> 02:12:56,990
sure yeah we're very uh we're very like
black and white with the proof thing

6342
02:12:56,990 --> 02:12:57,000
black and white with the proof thing
 

6343
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:00,229
black and white with the proof thing
yeah maybe they're looser

6344
02:13:00,229 --> 02:13:00,239
yeah maybe they're looser
 

6345
02:13:00,239 --> 02:13:03,050
yeah maybe they're looser
right well so you can you can know

6346
02:13:03,050 --> 02:13:03,060
right well so you can you can know
 

6347
02:13:03,060 --> 02:13:05,450
right well so you can you can know
something is true

6348
02:13:05,450 --> 02:13:05,460
something is true
 

6349
02:13:05,460 --> 02:13:07,609
something is true
to first of all you never know something

6350
02:13:07,609 --> 02:13:07,619
to first of all you never know something
 

6351
02:13:07,619 --> 02:13:11,089
to first of all you never know something
is true with 100 uncertainty I mean

6352
02:13:11,089 --> 02:13:11,099
is true with 100 uncertainty I mean
 

6353
02:13:11,099 --> 02:13:14,569
is true with 100 uncertainty I mean
you might have had a blackout it's just

6354
02:13:14,569 --> 02:13:14,579
you might have had a blackout it's just
 

6355
02:13:14,579 --> 02:13:16,970
you might have had a blackout it's just
to be it's never a hundred percent right

6356
02:13:16,970 --> 02:13:16,980
to be it's never a hundred percent right
 

6357
02:13:16,980 --> 02:13:19,490
to be it's never a hundred percent right
you you might have had a momentary lapse

6358
02:13:19,490 --> 02:13:19,500
you you might have had a momentary lapse
 

6359
02:13:19,500 --> 02:13:21,530
you you might have had a momentary lapse
of Consciousness it's a key step in the

6360
02:13:21,530 --> 02:13:21,540
of Consciousness it's a key step in the
 

6361
02:13:21,540 --> 02:13:24,109
of Consciousness it's a key step in the
proof and nobody read it and whatever

6362
02:13:24,109 --> 02:13:24,119
proof and nobody read it and whatever
 

6363
02:13:24,119 --> 02:13:27,050
proof and nobody read it and whatever
okay so you never know for sure

6364
02:13:27,050 --> 02:13:27,060
okay so you never know for sure
 

6365
02:13:27,060 --> 02:13:29,050
okay so you never know for sure
but you can

6366
02:13:29,050 --> 02:13:29,060
but you can
 

6367
02:13:29,060 --> 02:13:32,510
but you can
be have a preponderance of evidence

6368
02:13:32,510 --> 02:13:32,520
be have a preponderance of evidence
 

6369
02:13:32,520 --> 02:13:35,450
be have a preponderance of evidence
which makes it

6370
02:13:35,450 --> 02:13:35,460

 

6371
02:13:35,460 --> 02:13:37,910

and preponderance of evidence

6372
02:13:37,910 --> 02:13:37,920
and preponderance of evidence
 

6373
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:41,030
and preponderance of evidence
is not accepted very much

6374
02:13:41,030 --> 02:13:41,040
is not accepted very much
 

6375
02:13:41,040 --> 02:13:43,010
is not accepted very much
in mathematics and

6376
02:13:43,010 --> 02:13:43,020
in mathematics and
 

6377
02:13:43,020 --> 02:13:44,810
in mathematics and
and that was sort of

6378
02:13:44,810 --> 02:13:44,820
and that was sort of
 

6379
02:13:44,820 --> 02:13:47,990
and that was sort of
how you know the famous ramanujan work

6380
02:13:47,990 --> 02:13:48,000
how you know the famous ramanujan work
 

6381
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,089
how you know the famous ramanujan work
he worked he had

6382
02:13:50,089 --> 02:13:50,099
he worked he had
 

6383
02:13:50,099 --> 02:13:52,970
he worked he had
formulas which he guessed at and then he

6384
02:13:52,970 --> 02:13:52,980
formulas which he guessed at and then he
 

6385
02:13:52,980 --> 02:13:54,830
formulas which he guessed at and then he
gathered a preponderance of evidence

6386
02:13:54,830 --> 02:13:54,840
gathered a preponderance of evidence
 

6387
02:13:54,840 --> 02:13:57,050
gathered a preponderance of evidence
that that you were sure they were true

6388
02:13:57,050 --> 02:13:57,060
that that you were sure they were true
 

6389
02:13:57,060 --> 02:13:59,330
that that you were sure they were true
and so there might be or something

6390
02:13:59,330 --> 02:13:59,340
and so there might be or something
 

6391
02:13:59,340 --> 02:14:00,830
and so there might be or something
completely different you know they might

6392
02:14:00,830 --> 02:14:00,840
completely different you know they might
 

6393
02:14:00,840 --> 02:14:02,569
completely different you know they might
function in a different in a very

6394
02:14:02,569 --> 02:14:02,579
function in a different in a very
 

6395
02:14:02,579 --> 02:14:04,310
function in a different in a very
different way

6396
02:14:04,310 --> 02:14:04,320
different way
 

6397
02:14:04,320 --> 02:14:06,709
different way
let me ask you um kind of a heavy

6398
02:14:06,709 --> 02:14:06,719
let me ask you um kind of a heavy
 

6399
02:14:06,719 --> 02:14:09,290
let me ask you um kind of a heavy
question for a physicist but one on

6400
02:14:09,290 --> 02:14:09,300
question for a physicist but one on
 

6401
02:14:09,300 --> 02:14:10,609
question for a physicist but one on
nuclear weapons

6402
02:14:10,609 --> 02:14:10,619
nuclear weapons
 

6403
02:14:10,619 --> 02:14:12,229
nuclear weapons
just in general what do you think about

6404
02:14:12,229 --> 02:14:12,239
just in general what do you think about
 

6405
02:14:12,239 --> 02:14:15,350
just in general what do you think about
nuclear weapons where like philosophical

6406
02:14:15,350 --> 02:14:15,360
nuclear weapons where like philosophical
 

6407
02:14:15,360 --> 02:14:16,729
nuclear weapons where like philosophical
level

6408
02:14:16,729 --> 02:14:16,739
level
 

6409
02:14:16,739 --> 02:14:19,550
level
where brilliant physicists and Brilliant

6410
02:14:19,550 --> 02:14:19,560
where brilliant physicists and Brilliant
 

6411
02:14:19,560 --> 02:14:21,169
where brilliant physicists and Brilliant
engineering leads to thing that can

6412
02:14:21,169 --> 02:14:21,179
engineering leads to thing that can
 

6413
02:14:21,179 --> 02:14:23,030
engineering leads to thing that can
destroy human civilization

6414
02:14:23,030 --> 02:14:23,040
destroy human civilization
 

6415
02:14:23,040 --> 02:14:25,729
destroy human civilization
sort of like some of the ideas

6416
02:14:25,729 --> 02:14:25,739
sort of like some of the ideas
 

6417
02:14:25,739 --> 02:14:29,089
sort of like some of the ideas
that you're working on

6418
02:14:29,089 --> 02:14:29,099

 

6419
02:14:29,099 --> 02:14:32,750

have power when it when engineered into

6420
02:14:32,750 --> 02:14:32,760
have power when it when engineered into
 

6421
02:14:32,760 --> 02:14:35,270
have power when it when engineered into
machines into systems is there some

6422
02:14:35,270 --> 02:14:35,280
machines into systems is there some
 

6423
02:14:35,280 --> 02:14:37,729
machines into systems is there some
aspects I don't know what the brilliant

6424
02:14:37,729 --> 02:14:37,739
aspects I don't know what the brilliant
 

6425
02:14:37,739 --> 02:14:40,189
aspects I don't know what the brilliant
had to do with it because of course

6426
02:14:40,189 --> 02:14:40,199
had to do with it because of course
 

6427
02:14:40,199 --> 02:14:42,169
had to do with it because of course
you know Oppenheimer and all that okay

6428
02:14:42,169 --> 02:14:42,179
you know Oppenheimer and all that okay
 

6429
02:14:42,179 --> 02:14:44,510
you know Oppenheimer and all that okay
they did it really fast but if you

6430
02:14:44,510 --> 02:14:44,520
they did it really fast but if you
 

6431
02:14:44,520 --> 02:14:47,030
they did it really fast but if you
didn't have Oppenheimer yeah you know I

6432
02:14:47,030 --> 02:14:47,040
didn't have Oppenheimer yeah you know I
 

6433
02:14:47,040 --> 02:14:49,550
didn't have Oppenheimer yeah you know I
mean would all have happened anyway

6434
02:14:49,550 --> 02:14:49,560
mean would all have happened anyway
 

6435
02:14:49,560 --> 02:14:52,910
mean would all have happened anyway
it it's the it had a reality of its own

6436
02:14:52,910 --> 02:14:52,920
it it's the it had a reality of its own
 

6437
02:14:52,920 --> 02:14:55,129
it it's the it had a reality of its own
the possibility of making a nuclear

6438
02:14:55,129 --> 02:14:55,139
the possibility of making a nuclear
 

6439
02:14:55,139 --> 02:14:57,290
the possibility of making a nuclear
didn't it didn't depend on the fact that

6440
02:14:57,290 --> 02:14:57,300
didn't it didn't depend on the fact that
 

6441
02:14:57,300 --> 02:14:58,550
didn't it didn't depend on the fact that
the physicists who built it were

6442
02:14:58,550 --> 02:14:58,560
the physicists who built it were
 

6443
02:14:58,560 --> 02:15:01,010
the physicists who built it were
brilliant maybe that

6444
02:15:01,010 --> 02:15:01,020
brilliant maybe that
 

6445
02:15:01,020 --> 02:15:03,649
brilliant maybe that
bed it up by a year two years or but by

6446
02:15:03,649 --> 02:15:03,659
bed it up by a year two years or but by
 

6447
02:15:03,659 --> 02:15:05,810
bed it up by a year two years or but by
now we'd have nuclear weapons it's it's

6448
02:15:05,810 --> 02:15:05,820
now we'd have nuclear weapons it's it's
 

6449
02:15:05,820 --> 02:15:07,609
now we'd have nuclear weapons it's it's
something that so the ideas have

6450
02:15:07,609 --> 02:15:07,619
something that so the ideas have
 

6451
02:15:07,619 --> 02:15:09,709
something that so the ideas have
momentum and that they're um yeah

6452
02:15:09,709 --> 02:15:09,719
momentum and that they're um yeah
 

6453
02:15:09,719 --> 02:15:13,129
momentum and that they're um yeah
Unstoppable right the possibility of

6454
02:15:13,129 --> 02:15:13,139
Unstoppable right the possibility of
 

6455
02:15:13,139 --> 02:15:16,430
Unstoppable right the possibility of
making nuclear weapons was discovered

6456
02:15:16,430 --> 02:15:16,440
making nuclear weapons was discovered
 

6457
02:15:16,440 --> 02:15:19,609
making nuclear weapons was discovered
right it was there before

6458
02:15:19,609 --> 02:15:19,619
right it was there before
 

6459
02:15:19,619 --> 02:15:21,410
right it was there before
we didn't we didn't it's not like

6460
02:15:21,410 --> 02:15:21,420
we didn't we didn't it's not like
 

6461
02:15:21,420 --> 02:15:23,810
we didn't we didn't it's not like
somebody made it right

6462
02:15:23,810 --> 02:15:23,820
somebody made it right
 

6463
02:15:23,820 --> 02:15:25,850
somebody made it right
um

6464
02:15:25,850 --> 02:15:25,860
um
 

6465
02:15:25,860 --> 02:15:27,830
um
without Picasso

6466
02:15:27,830 --> 02:15:27,840
without Picasso
 

6467
02:15:27,840 --> 02:15:30,410
without Picasso
you know there would never have been a

6468
02:15:30,410 --> 02:15:30,420
you know there would never have been a
 

6469
02:15:30,420 --> 02:15:33,410
you know there would never have been a
Guernica but without Oppenheimer that

6470
02:15:33,410 --> 02:15:33,420
Guernica but without Oppenheimer that
 

6471
02:15:33,420 --> 02:15:35,270
Guernica but without Oppenheimer that
would surely have still been

6472
02:15:35,270 --> 02:15:35,280
would surely have still been
 

6473
02:15:35,280 --> 02:15:36,770
would surely have still been
an atom bomb

6474
02:15:36,770 --> 02:15:36,780
an atom bomb
 

6475
02:15:36,780 --> 02:15:39,109
an atom bomb
but timing matters right timing is very

6476
02:15:39,109 --> 02:15:39,119
but timing matters right timing is very
 

6477
02:15:39,119 --> 02:15:41,390
but timing matters right timing is very
important there's a guy of course of

6478
02:15:41,390 --> 02:15:41,400
important there's a guy of course of
 

6479
02:15:41,400 --> 02:15:44,510
important there's a guy of course of
course of course but the timing matter

6480
02:15:44,510 --> 02:15:44,520
course of course but the timing matter
 

6481
02:15:44,520 --> 02:15:46,370
course of course but the timing matter
the timing mattered there

6482
02:15:46,370 --> 02:15:46,380
the timing mattered there
 

6483
02:15:46,380 --> 02:15:48,169
the timing mattered there
um

6484
02:15:48,169 --> 02:15:48,179
um
 

6485
02:15:48,179 --> 02:15:49,970
um
but I

6486

I yeah
 

6489
02:15:51,540 --> 02:15:54,410
I yeah
uh okay I mean you could try to make a

6490
02:15:54,410 --> 02:15:54,420
uh okay I mean you could try to make a
 

6491
02:15:54,420 --> 02:15:56,990
uh okay I mean you could try to make a
case for

6492
02:15:56,990 --> 02:15:57,000

 

6493
02:15:57,000 --> 02:16:00,050

stopping uh no no no it's the case of

6494
02:16:00,050 --> 02:16:00,060
stopping uh no no no it's the case of
 

6495
02:16:00,060 --> 02:16:01,550
stopping uh no no no it's the case of
carrying the burden of the

how to make systems more and more
 

6515
02:16:23,760 --> 02:16:25,850
how to make systems more and more
intelligent how to you have a bunch of

now you can have world wars you can have
 

6535
02:16:45,359 --> 02:16:48,770
now you can have world wars you can have
a lot of really risky instabilities they

6536
02:16:48,770 --> 02:16:48,780
a lot of really risky instabilities they
 

6537
02:16:48,780 --> 02:16:50,570
a lot of really risky instabilities they
really are incredible and so to think

6538
02:16:50,570 --> 02:16:50,580
really are incredible and so to think
 

6539
02:16:50,580 --> 02:16:53,509
really are incredible and so to think
like there's some responsibility this is

6540
02:16:53,509 --> 02:16:53,519
like there's some responsibility this is
 

6541
02:16:53,519 --> 02:16:55,070

yeah
 

6551
02:17:04,500 --> 02:17:06,589
yeah
at that moment it was certainly a

6552
02:17:06,589 --> 02:17:06,599
at that moment it was certainly a
 

6553
02:17:06,599 --> 02:17:08,990
at that moment it was certainly a
question for Oppenheimer and everybody

6554
02:17:08,990 --> 02:17:09,000
question for Oppenheimer and everybody
 

6555
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:12,230
question for Oppenheimer and everybody
who participated in that what it what is

6556
02:17:12,230 --> 02:17:12,240
who participated in that what it what is
 

6557
02:17:12,240 --> 02:17:14,450
who participated in that what it what is
the responsible way to

6558
02:17:14,450 --> 02:17:14,460
the responsible way to
 

6559
02:17:14,460 --> 02:17:16,370
the responsible way to
serve Society

6560
02:17:16,370 --> 02:17:16,380
serve Society
 

6561
02:17:16,380 --> 02:17:18,589
serve Society
when you're

6562
02:17:18,589 --> 02:17:18,599
when you're
 

6563
02:17:18,599 --> 02:17:21,110
when you're
sort of accidentally in this position of

being at the Forefront of
 

6567
02:17:24,840 --> 02:17:26,990
being at the Forefront of
a development that has a huge impact on

a development that has a huge impact on
 

6569
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:31,429
a development that has a huge impact on
society I I don't see my work

6570
02:17:31,429 --> 02:17:31,439
society I I don't see my work
 

6571

the likelihood of having a huge impact

6572
02:17:34,310 --> 02:17:34,320
the likelihood of having a huge impact
 

6573
02:17:34,320 --> 02:17:37,250
the likelihood of having a huge impact
on the development of society itself but

6574
02:17:37,250 --> 02:17:37,260
on the development of society itself but
 

6575
02:17:37,260 --> 02:17:38,810
on the development of society itself but
if I were you

6576
02:17:38,810 --> 02:17:38,820
if I were you
 

6577
02:17:38,820 --> 02:17:43,070
if I were you
oh I love this working on AI yeah I

6578
02:17:43,070 --> 02:17:43,080
oh I love this working on AI yeah I
 

6579
02:17:43,080 --> 02:17:45,410
oh I love this working on AI yeah I
think that there is a possibility there

6580
02:17:45,410 --> 02:17:45,420
think that there is a possibility there
 

6581
02:17:45,420 --> 02:17:48,070
think that there is a possibility there
and that it is as a responsible

6582
02:17:48,070 --> 02:17:48,080
and that it is as a responsible
 

6583
02:17:48,080 --> 02:17:50,990
and that it is as a responsible
scientist that it's really not a good

6584
02:17:50,990 --> 02:17:51,000
scientist that it's really not a good
 

6585
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,990
scientist that it's really not a good
thing to say I'm just the scientist here

6586
02:17:53,990 --> 02:17:54,000
thing to say I'm just the scientist here
 

6587
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,150
thing to say I'm just the scientist here
and I'm figuring out what's possible

6588
02:17:56,150 --> 02:17:56,160
and I'm figuring out what's possible
 

6589
02:17:56,160 --> 02:17:58,370
and I'm figuring out what's possible
because

6590
02:17:58,370 --> 02:17:58,380
because
 

6591
02:17:58,380 --> 02:18:01,429
because
you're in a role where you

6592
02:18:01,429 --> 02:18:01,439
you're in a role where you
 

6593
02:18:01,439 --> 02:18:06,169
you're in a role where you
you're you know you have more of a

6594
02:18:06,169 --> 02:18:06,179
you're you know you have more of a
 

6595
02:18:06,179 --> 02:18:08,929
you're you know you have more of a
a Podium to influence things than other

6596
02:18:08,929 --> 02:18:08,939
a Podium to influence things than other
 

6597
02:18:08,939 --> 02:18:11,389
a Podium to influence things than other
people and

6598
02:18:11,389 --> 02:18:11,399
people and
 

6599
02:18:11,399 --> 02:18:16,429
people and
it's your responsibility is it citizen

6600
02:18:16,429 --> 02:18:16,439
it's your responsibility is it citizen
 

6601
02:18:16,439 --> 02:18:19,849
it's your responsibility is it citizen
of the planet or or let me phrase it a

6602
02:18:19,849 --> 02:18:19,859
of the planet or or let me phrase it a
 

6603
02:18:19,859 --> 02:18:24,169
of the planet or or let me phrase it a
little less shouldy it's you know you

6604
02:18:24,169 --> 02:18:24,179
little less shouldy it's you know you
 

6605
02:18:24,179 --> 02:18:27,709
little less shouldy it's you know you
have an opportunity yeah as a citizen of

6606
02:18:27,709 --> 02:18:27,719
have an opportunity yeah as a citizen of
 

6607
02:18:27,719 --> 02:18:29,330
have an opportunity yeah as a citizen of
the planet to

6608
02:18:29,330 --> 02:18:29,340
the planet to
 

6609
02:18:29,340 --> 02:18:31,490
the planet to
make the world a better place which

6610
02:18:31,490 --> 02:18:31,500
make the world a better place which
 

6611
02:18:31,500 --> 02:18:34,790
make the world a better place which
which it would be sad too

6612
02:18:34,790 --> 02:18:34,800
which it would be sad too
 

6613
02:18:34,800 --> 02:18:37,610
which it would be sad too
to bypass yeah it's a nice world without

6614

to bypass yeah it's a nice world without
 

6615
02:18:37,620 --> 02:18:39,530
to bypass yeah it's a nice world without
going it'd be nice to keep it going for

6616
02:18:39,530 --> 02:18:39,540
going it'd be nice to keep it going for
