1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,910

and so our goal was a natural looking

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:01,920
and so our goal was a natural looking
 

3
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,490
and so our goal was a natural looking
gate it was real it was surprisingly

4
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:04,500
gate it was real it was surprisingly
 

5
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,130
gate it was real it was surprisingly
hard to get that to work

6
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:07,140
hard to get that to work
 

7
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,810
hard to get that to work
um and we but we did build an early

8
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:08,820
um and we but we did build an early
 

9
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:09,790
um and we but we did build an early
machine

10
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:09,800
machine
 

11
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,890
machine
uh we called it pet man prototype it was

12
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:12,900
uh we called it pet man prototype it was
 

13
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,730
uh we called it pet man prototype it was
the Prototype before the Pac-Man robot

14
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:15,740
the Prototype before the Pac-Man robot
 

15
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,630
the Prototype before the Pac-Man robot
and it had a really nice looking

16
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:19,640
and it had a really nice looking
 

17
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,670
and it had a really nice looking
gate where you know it would stick the

18
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:22,680
gate where you know it would stick the
 

19
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,529
gate where you know it would stick the
leg out it would do heel strike first

20
00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:24,539
leg out it would do heel strike first
 

21
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,390
leg out it would do heel strike first
before it rolled onto the toe so you

22
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:26,400
before it rolled onto the toe so you
 

23
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,890
before it rolled onto the toe so you
didn't land with a flat foot you

24
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:27,900
didn't land with a flat foot you
 

25
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,589
didn't land with a flat foot you
extended your leg a little bit

26
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:30,599
extended your leg a little bit
 

27
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:32,810
extended your leg a little bit
um but even then it was hard to get the

28
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:32,820
um but even then it was hard to get the
 

29
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,850
um but even then it was hard to get the
robot to walk where when you're walking

30
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:34,860
robot to walk where when you're walking
 

31
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,430
robot to walk where when you're walking
that it fully extended its leg

32
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:37,440
that it fully extended its leg
 

33
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,310
that it fully extended its leg
and getting that all to work well

34
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:40,320
and getting that all to work well
 

35
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,670
and getting that all to work well
took such a long time in fact I I

36
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:43,680
took such a long time in fact I I
 

37
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,950
took such a long time in fact I I
probably didn't really see the nice

38
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:45,960
probably didn't really see the nice
 

39
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,410
probably didn't really see the nice
natural walking that I expected out of

40
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:48,420
natural walking that I expected out of
 

41
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,770
natural walking that I expected out of
our humanoids until maybe last year

42
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:51,780
our humanoids until maybe last year
 

43
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,410
our humanoids until maybe last year
and the team was developing on our newer

44
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:54,420
and the team was developing on our newer
 

45
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,510
and the team was developing on our newer
generation of Atlas you know some new

46
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:56,520
generation of Atlas you know some new
 

47
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,450
generation of Atlas you know some new
techniques

48
00:00:58,450 --> 00:00:58,460
techniques
 

49
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,770
techniques
for developing a walking control

50
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:00,780
for developing a walking control
 

51
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,750
for developing a walking control
algorithm and they got that natural

52
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:02,760
algorithm and they got that natural
 

53
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,750
algorithm and they got that natural
looking motion as sort of a byproduct of

54
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:05,760
looking motion as sort of a byproduct of
 

55
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,090
looking motion as sort of a byproduct of
a just a different process that we're

56
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:08,100
a just a different process that we're
 

57
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,030
a just a different process that we're
applying to developing the control

58
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:11,040
applying to developing the control
 

59
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,450
applying to developing the control
so that probably took 15 years 10 to 15

60
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:14,460
so that probably took 15 years 10 to 15
 

61
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,850
so that probably took 15 years 10 to 15
years to sort of get that from from you

62
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:16,860
years to sort of get that from from you
 

63
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:17,510
years to sort of get that from from you
know

64
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:17,520
know
 

65
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,490
know
the Petman prototype was probably in

66
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:19,500
the Petman prototype was probably in
 

67
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,210
the Petman prototype was probably in
2008 and what was it 2022 last year that

68
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:23,220
2008 and what was it 2022 last year that
 

69
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,230
2008 and what was it 2022 last year that
I think I saw a good walking on Atlas

70
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:27,240

00:02:59,390 --> 00:02:59,400
when did you first fall in love with
 

141
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,790
when did you first fall in love with
robotics

let's start with love and robots well

144
00:03:05,089 --> 00:03:05,099
let's start with love and robots well
 

145
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:08,630
let's start with love and robots well
love is is relevant because I think the

146
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:08,640
love is is relevant because I think the
 

147
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,030
love is is relevant because I think the
the fascination the Deep Fascination is

the fascination the Deep Fascination is
 

149

165
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:31,369
of the AI lab
and so I walked down there and saw him

166
00:03:31,369 --> 00:03:31,379
and so I walked down there and saw him
 

167
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,770
and so I walked down there and saw him
he showed me his robots

168
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:33,780
he showed me his robots
 

169
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,809
he showed me his robots
and he showed me this robot doing a

170
00:03:35,809 --> 00:03:35,819
and he showed me this robot doing a
 

171
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:36,949
and he showed me this robot doing a
somersault

172
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:36,959
somersault
 

173
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,890
somersault
and I just immediately went whoa you

174
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:39,900
and I just immediately went whoa you
 

175
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,110
and I just immediately went whoa you
know yeah robots can do that and because

176
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:42,120
know yeah robots can do that and because
 

177
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,509
know yeah robots can do that and because
of my own interest in in gymnastics

178
00:03:44,509 --> 00:03:44,519
of my own interest in in gymnastics
 

179
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:46,729
of my own interest in in gymnastics
there was like this immediate connection

180
00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:46,739
there was like this immediate connection
 

181
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:49,550
there was like this immediate connection
and um you know I was interested in I

182
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:49,560
and um you know I was interested in I
 

183
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,430
and um you know I was interested in I
was in an arrow Astro degree because you

184
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:52,440
was in an arrow Astro degree because you
 

185
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,770
was in an arrow Astro degree because you
know flight and movement was all so

186
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:54,780
know flight and movement was all so
 

187
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,390
know flight and movement was all so
fascinating to me and then it turned out

188
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:56,400
fascinating to me and then it turned out
 

189
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,610
fascinating to me and then it turned out
that you know robotics had this big

190
00:03:58,610 --> 00:03:58,620
that you know robotics had this big
 

191
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,770
that you know robotics had this big
challenge how do you how do you balance

192
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:00,780
challenge how do you how do you balance
 

193
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,869
challenge how do you how do you balance
uh how do you how do you build a legged

194
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:02,879
uh how do you how do you build a legged
 

195
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,610
uh how do you how do you build a legged
robot that can really get around

196
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:04,620
robot that can really get around
 

197
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,089
robot that can really get around
and that just that was a Fascination and

198
00:04:08,089 --> 00:04:08,099
and that just that was a Fascination and
 

199
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:09,949
and that just that was a Fascination and
it still exists today you're still

200
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:09,959
it still exists today you're still
 

201
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,770
it still exists today you're still

they work extremely hard and work a long

there's a

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,270
there's a happiness there the only other
group of people I met like that are

00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:14,280
group of people I met like that are
 

423
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,570
group of people I met like that are
people that Skydive a lot like for some

424
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:17,580
people that Skydive a lot like for some
 

425
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,950

427
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,770
reason there's a deep fulfilling
happiness maybe from like a long period

428
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:21,780
happiness maybe from like a long period
 

429
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,510
happiness maybe from like a long period
of struggle to get a thing to work and

430
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:23,520
of struggle to get a thing to work and
 

431
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,129
of struggle to get a thing to work and
it works and there's a magic to it I

432
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:25,139
it works and there's a magic to it I
 

433
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:27,469
it works and there's a magic to it I
don't know exactly because it's so

434
00:08:27,469 --> 00:08:27,479
don't know exactly because it's so
 

435
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:29,629
don't know exactly because it's so
fundamentally Hands-On and you're

436
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:29,639
fundamentally Hands-On and you're
 

437
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,070
fundamentally Hands-On and you're
bringing a thing to life I don't know

438
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:31,080
bringing a thing to life I don't know
 

439
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,930
bringing a thing to life I don't know
what it is but they're happy

440
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:32,940
what it is but they're happy
 

441
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,110
what it is but they're happy
we see you know our our attrition at the

442
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:36,120
we see you know our our attrition at the
 

443
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,269
we see you know our our attrition at the
company is really low people come and

444
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:38,279
company is really low people come and
 

445
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:40,310
company is really low people come and
they love the pursuit

446
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:40,320
they love the pursuit
 

447
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,949
they love the pursuit
and I think part of that is that there's

448
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:42,959
and I think part of that is that there's
 

449
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:45,170
and I think part of that is that there's
perhaps an external connection to it

450
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:45,180
perhaps an external connection to it
 

451
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,910
perhaps an external connection to it
it's a little bit easier to connect when

452
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:46,920
it's a little bit easier to connect when
 

453
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,009
it's a little bit easier to connect when
you have a robot that's moving around in

454
00:08:49,009 --> 00:08:49,019
you have a robot that's moving around in
 

455
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:50,449
you have a robot that's moving around in
the world and part of your goal is to

456
00:08:50,449 --> 00:08:50,459
the world and part of your goal is to
 

457
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:52,250
the world and part of your goal is to
make it move around in the world

458
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:52,260
make it move around in the world
 

459
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,829
make it move around in the world
you can identify with that and and this

460
00:08:54,829 --> 00:08:54,839
you can identify with that and and this
 

461
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:56,570
you can identify with that and and this
is on a this is one of the unique things

462
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:56,580
is on a this is one of the unique things
 

463
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,130
is on a this is one of the unique things
about the kinds of robots we're building

464
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:58,140
about the kinds of robots we're building
 

465
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,910
about the kinds of robots we're building
is this physical interaction

466
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:00,920
is this physical interaction
 

467
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,250
is this physical interaction
lets you perhaps identify with it so I

468
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:04,260
lets you perhaps identify with it so I
 

469
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,050
lets you perhaps identify with it so I
think that is a source of happiness I

470
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:06,060
think that is a source of happiness I
 

471
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,490
think that is a source of happiness I
don't think it's Unique to robotics I

472
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:07,500
don't think it's Unique to robotics I
 

473
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,370
don't think it's Unique to robotics I
think anybody also who is just pursuing

474
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:10,380
think anybody also who is just pursuing
 

475
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,230
think anybody also who is just pursuing
something they love

something they love
 

477
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,269

it's easier to work hard at it and be

00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:14,279
it's easier to work hard at it and be
 

479
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:15,949
it's easier to work hard at it and be
good at it and

480
00:09:15,949 --> 00:09:15,959
good at it and
 

481
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:16,810
good at it and
um

482
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:16,820
um
 

483
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,910
um
not everybody gets to find that I I do

not everybody gets to find that I I do
 

485
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,430
not everybody gets to find that I I do
feel lucky in that way and I think we're

486
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:22,440
feel lucky in that way and I think we're
 

487
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,710
feel lucky in that way and I think we're
lucky as an organization that we've been

488
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:24,720
lucky as an organization that we've been
 

489
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,350
lucky as an organization that we've been
able to build a business around this and

490
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:27,360
able to build a business around this and
 

491
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,269
able to build a business around this and
that keeps people engaged

492
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:29,279
that keeps people engaged
 

493
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,970
that keeps people engaged
so if it's all right let's link on mark

494
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:31,980
so if it's all right let's link on mark
 

495
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,130
so if it's all right let's link on mark
for a little bit longer Mark raybert so

496
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:34,140
for a little bit longer Mark raybert so
 

497
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,350
for a little bit longer Mark raybert so
he's a legend

498
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:36,360
he's a legend
 

499
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,230
he's a legend
uh he's a legendary engineer Roboto says

500
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:39,240
uh he's a legendary engineer Roboto says
 

501
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,970
uh he's a legendary engineer Roboto says
what what have you learned about life

502
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:40,980
what what have you learned about life
 

503
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,610
what what have you learned about life
about Robotics and Mark through all the

504
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:43,620
about Robotics and Mark through all the
 

505
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,650
about Robotics and Mark through all the
many years you worked with him I think

506
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:45,660
many years you worked with him I think
 

507
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,990
many years you worked with him I think
the most important lesson which was you

508
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:48,000
the most important lesson which was you
 

509
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,009
the most important lesson which was you
know have the courage of your

510
00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:49,019
know have the courage of your
 

511
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:50,810
know have the courage of your
convictions and and do what you think is

512
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:50,820
convictions and and do what you think is
 

513
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,970
convictions and and do what you think is
interesting

514
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:52,980
interesting
 

515
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:53,509
interesting
um

516
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:53,519
um
 

517
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,750
um
be willing to try to find big big

518
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:56,760
be willing to try to find big big
 

519
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,930
be willing to try to find big big
problems to go after and at the time you

520
00:09:59,930 --> 00:09:59,940
problems to go after and at the time you
 

521
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,910
problems to go after and at the time you
know like at Locomotion

522
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:01,920
know like at Locomotion
 

523
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,210
know like at Locomotion
um especially in a dynamic machine

524
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:05,220
um especially in a dynamic machine
 

525
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,329
um especially in a dynamic machine
nobody had solved it and that felt like

526
00:10:08,329 --> 00:10:08,339
nobody had solved it and that felt like
 

527
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:09,310
nobody had solved it and that felt like
a

528
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:09,320
a
 

529
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,350
a
multi-decade problem to go after

530
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:12,360
multi-decade problem to go after
 

531
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,389
multi-decade problem to go after
and so you know have the courage to go

532
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:14,399
and so you know have the courage to go
 

533
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,389
and so you know have the courage to go
after that because you're interested

534
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:16,399
after that because you're interested
 

535
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,769
after that because you're interested
don't worry if it's going to make money

536
00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:18,779
don't worry if it's going to make money
 

537
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:21,470
don't worry if it's going to make money
you know that that's been a theme so

538
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:21,480
you know that that's been a theme so
 

539
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,230
you know that that's been a theme so
that that's really uh probably the most

540
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:24,240
that that's really uh probably the most
 

541
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,530
that that's really uh probably the most
uh important lesson I think that uh I

542
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:27,540
uh important lesson I think that uh I
 

543
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,509
uh important lesson I think that uh I
got from Mark how crazy is the effort of

544
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:29,519
got from Mark how crazy is the effort of
 

545
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,509
got from Mark how crazy is the effort of
doing legged

546
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:31,519
doing legged
 

547
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,150
doing legged
robotics at that time especially

548
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:35,160
robotics at that time especially
 

549
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,210
robotics at that time especially
you know Mark got some stuff to work uh

550
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:38,220
you know Mark got some stuff to work uh
 

551
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,430
you know Mark got some stuff to work uh
starting from the simple ideas oh so

552
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:40,440
starting from the simple ideas oh so
 

553
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,710
starting from the simple ideas oh so
maybe the other another important idea

00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:42,720
maybe the other another important idea
 

555
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,990
maybe the other another important idea
that has really become a value of the

what he started with was a pogo stick
 

569
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:02,810
what he started with was a pogo stick
because he was trying to reduce the

because he was trying to reduce the
 

571
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,610
because he was trying to reduce the

00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,230
the fundamental problems that if we
solve those you could eventually

extrapolate to something that galloped

582
00:11:14,269 --> 00:11:14,279
extrapolate to something that galloped
 

583
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:15,470
extrapolate to something that galloped
like a horse

584
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:15,480
like a horse
 

585
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,449
like a horse
and so look for those simplifying

586
00:11:17,449 --> 00:11:17,459
and so look for those simplifying
 

587
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:19,430
and so look for those simplifying
principles

588
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:19,440
principles
 

589
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,949
principles
um how tough is the job of simplifying a

590
00:11:21,949 --> 00:11:21,959
um how tough is the job of simplifying a
 

591
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:24,949
um how tough is the job of simplifying a
robot so I I'd say in the early days the

is that we we worked on under figuring
 

601
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,810
is that we we worked on under figuring
out what that that Central principle was

out what that that Central principle was
 

603
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:41,030
out what that that Central principle was
and then building software or machines

feedback control algorithm that was
 

621
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:02,449

um and that was not something everybody
 

629
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:12,110

um but at the time there weren't many
 

645
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,590
um but at the time there weren't many
groups who could really sort of work at

groups who could really sort of work at

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,069
with both the software and
and make the hardware work

652
00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:37,079
and make the hardware work
 

653
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:38,509
and make the hardware work
and I'll and I'll say one other thing

654
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:38,519
and I'll and I'll say one other thing
 

655
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,670
and I'll and I'll say one other thing
about your sort of talking about what

656
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:40,680
about your sort of talking about what
 

657
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,410
about your sort of talking about what
are the special things the other thing

658
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:42,420
are the special things the other thing
 

659
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,290
are the special things the other thing
was it's okay it's good to break stuff

660
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:45,300
was it's okay it's good to break stuff
 

661
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,269
was it's okay it's good to break stuff
you know

662
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:47,279
you know
 

663
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,389
you know
um you know use the robots break them

664
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:50,399
um you know use the robots break them
 

665
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,490
um you know use the robots break them
repair them

666
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:52,500
repair them
 

667
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,850
repair them
um you know fix and repeat test fix and

668
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:55,860
um you know fix and repeat test fix and
 

669
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,069
um you know fix and repeat test fix and
repeat and that and that's also a core

670
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:58,079
repeat and that and that's also a core
 

671
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,290
repeat and that and that's also a core
principle that has become part of the

672
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:00,300
principle that has become part of the
 

673
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,490
principle that has become part of the
company

674
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:01,500
company
 

675
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,449
company
and it lets you be Fearless in your work

676
00:13:05,449 --> 00:13:05,459
and it lets you be Fearless in your work
 

677
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:08,210
and it lets you be Fearless in your work
too often if you are working with a very

678
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:08,220
too often if you are working with a very
 

679
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,069
too often if you are working with a very
expensive robot maybe one that you

680
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:10,079
expensive robot maybe one that you
 

681
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,509
expensive robot maybe one that you
bought from somebody else or that you

682
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:11,519
bought from somebody else or that you
 

683
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,030
bought from somebody else or that you
don't know how to fix then you treat it

684
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:14,040
don't know how to fix then you treat it
 

685
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,790
don't know how to fix then you treat it
with kit gloves and you can't actually

686
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:16,800
with kit gloves and you can't actually
 

687
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,470
with kit gloves and you can't actually
make progress you have to be able to

688
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:18,480
make progress you have to be able to
 

689
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,509
make progress you have to be able to
break something and so I think that's a

690
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:20,519
break something and so I think that's a
 

691
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:23,030
break something and so I think that's a
been a a principle as well so just the

692
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:23,040
been a a principle as well so just the
 

693
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,650
been a a principle as well so just the
link on that psychologically how do you

694
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:24,660
link on that psychologically how do you
 

695
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,030
link on that psychologically how do you
deal with that because I remember I had

696
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:26,040
deal with that because I remember I had
 

697
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,009
deal with that because I remember I had
uh

698
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:27,019
uh
 

699
00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:30,110
uh
uh I built a RC car

700
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:30,120
uh I built a RC car
 

701
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,930
uh I built a RC car
with that some

702
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:31,940
with that some
 

703
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:35,329
with that some
uh it had some custom stuff like compute

704
00:13:35,329 --> 00:13:35,339
uh it had some custom stuff like compute
 

705
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:36,850
uh it had some custom stuff like compute
on it and all that kind of stuff cameras

706
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:36,860
on it and all that kind of stuff cameras
 

707
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:41,090
on it and all that kind of stuff cameras
and uh because I didn't sleep much the

708
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:41,100
and uh because I didn't sleep much the
 

709
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,129
and uh because I didn't sleep much the
code I wrote has an issue where it

710
00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:43,139
code I wrote has an issue where it
 

711
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:46,129
code I wrote has an issue where it
didn't stop the car and then the car got

712
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:46,139
didn't stop the car and then the car got
 

713
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:48,650
didn't stop the car and then the car got
confused and at full speed at like 20 25

714
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:48,660
confused and at full speed at like 20 25
 

715
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,170
confused and at full speed at like 20 25
miles an hour slammed into a wall

716
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:51,180
miles an hour slammed into a wall
 

717
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,449
miles an hour slammed into a wall
and I just remember sitting there alone

718
00:13:53,449 --> 00:13:53,459
and I just remember sitting there alone
 

719
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:55,970
and I just remember sitting there alone
in the deep sadness

720
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:55,980
in the deep sadness
 

721
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:56,569
in the deep sadness
um

722
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:56,579
um
 

723
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:58,009
um
sort of

724
00:13:58,009 --> 00:13:58,019
sort of
 

725
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:01,910
sort of
full of regret I think almost anger

726
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:01,920
full of regret I think almost anger
 

727
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,170
full of regret I think almost anger
um

728
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:03,180
um
 

729
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,870
um
uh but also like sadness because you

730
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:05,880
uh but also like sadness because you
 

731
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,030
uh but also like sadness because you
think about well these robots especially

732
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:08,040
think about well these robots especially
 

733
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,250
think about well these robots especially
for autonomous vehicles like like you

734
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:10,260
for autonomous vehicles like like you
 

735
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,930
for autonomous vehicles like like you
should be taking safety very seriously

736
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:11,940
should be taking safety very seriously
 

737
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,930
should be taking safety very seriously
even in these kinds of things but just

738
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:14,940
even in these kinds of things but just
 

739
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:18,110
even in these kinds of things but just
no good feelings and made me more afraid

740
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:18,120
no good feelings and made me more afraid
 

741
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,970
no good feelings and made me more afraid
probably to do this kind of experiments

742
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:19,980
probably to do this kind of experiments
 

743
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,949
probably to do this kind of experiments
in the future perhaps the right way to

744
00:14:21,949 --> 00:14:21,959
in the future perhaps the right way to
 

745
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:24,350
in the future perhaps the right way to
have seen that is positively

746
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:24,360
have seen that is positively
 

747
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,629
have seen that is positively
like it's it's too it depends if you

748
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:26,639
like it's it's too it depends if you
 

749
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,790
like it's it's too it depends if you
could have built that car or or just

750
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:28,800
could have built that car or or just
 

751
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,110
could have built that car or or just
gotten another one right that would have

752
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:30,120
gotten another one right that would have
 

753
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,970
gotten another one right that would have
been the approach

754
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:31,980
been the approach
 

755
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,850
been the approach
um I remember

756
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:34,860

 

757
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,509

um

758
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:35,519
um
 

759
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,690
um
when I got to grad school

760
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:38,700
when I got to grad school
 

761
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,910
when I got to grad school
um you know I got some training about uh

762
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:40,920
um you know I got some training about uh
 

763
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,910
um you know I got some training about uh
operating a lathe and a mill up in the

764
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:43,920
operating a lathe and a mill up in the
 

765
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,189
operating a lathe and a mill up in the
machine shop and I could start to make

766
00:14:46,189 --> 00:14:46,199
machine shop and I could start to make
 

767
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:49,069
machine shop and I could start to make
my own parts and I remember breaking

768
00:14:49,069 --> 00:14:49,079
my own parts and I remember breaking
 

769
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:52,430
my own parts and I remember breaking
some piece of equipment in the lab and

770
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:52,440
some piece of equipment in the lab and
 

771
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,689
some piece of equipment in the lab and
then realizing

772
00:14:53,689 --> 00:14:53,699
then realizing
 

773
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:55,610
then realizing
because I maybe this was a unique part

774
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:55,620
because I maybe this was a unique part
 

775
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,949
because I maybe this was a unique part
and I couldn't go buy it and I realized

776
00:14:57,949 --> 00:14:57,959
and I couldn't go buy it and I realized
 

777
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:00,170
and I couldn't go buy it and I realized
oh I can just go make it

778
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:00,180
oh I can just go make it
 

779
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:03,230
oh I can just go make it
that was an enabling feeling yeah then

780
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:03,240
that was an enabling feeling yeah then
 

781
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,970
that was an enabling feeling yeah then
you're not afraid yeah it might take

782
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:04,980
you're not afraid yeah it might take
 

783
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,610
you're not afraid yeah it might take
time it might take more work than you

784
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:07,620
time it might take more work than you
 

785
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,050
time it might take more work than you
thought it was going to be required to

786
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:09,060
thought it was going to be required to
 

787
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,430
thought it was going to be required to
get this thing done

788
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:10,440
get this thing done
 

789
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,009
get this thing done
but you can just go make it and that's

790
00:15:13,009 --> 00:15:13,019
but you can just go make it and that's
 

791
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:16,150
but you can just go make it and that's
freeing in a way that nothing else is

792
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:16,160
freeing in a way that nothing else is
 

793
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,069
freeing in a way that nothing else is
you mentioned uh the the feedback

794
00:15:19,069 --> 00:15:19,079
you mentioned uh the the feedback
 

795
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:21,829
you mentioned uh the the feedback
control the Dynamics sorry for the

796
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:21,839
control the Dynamics sorry for the
 

797
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,930
control the Dynamics sorry for the
Romantic question but is in the early

798
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:23,940
Romantic question but is in the early
 

799
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,689
Romantic question but is in the early
days and even now is the Dynamics

800
00:15:26,689 --> 00:15:26,699
days and even now is the Dynamics
 

801
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:28,250
days and even now is the Dynamics
probably more appropriate for the early

802
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:28,260
probably more appropriate for the early
 

803
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:33,110
probably more appropriate for the early
days is it more art or science

804
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:33,120

 

805
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,509

there's a lot of science around it

806
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:35,519
there's a lot of science around it
 

807
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,150
there's a lot of science around it
and and trying to develop you know

808
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:38,160
and and trying to develop you know
 

809
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,189
and and trying to develop you know
scientific principles

810
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:40,199
scientific principles
 

811
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:42,769
scientific principles
that let you extrapolate from like one

812
00:15:42,769 --> 00:15:42,779
that let you extrapolate from like one
 

813
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:44,569
that let you extrapolate from like one
legged machine to another

814
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:44,579
legged machine to another
 

815
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:47,150
legged machine to another
you know develop a core set of

816
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:47,160
you know develop a core set of
 

817
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,370
you know develop a core set of
principles like like a spring Mass

818
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:49,380
principles like like a spring Mass
 

819
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,910
principles like like a spring Mass
bouncing system and then figure out how

820
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:52,920
bouncing system and then figure out how
 

821
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,769
bouncing system and then figure out how
to apply that from a one-legged machine

822
00:15:54,769 --> 00:15:54,779
to apply that from a one-legged machine
 

823
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:57,170
to apply that from a one-legged machine
to a two or a four-legged machine those

824
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:57,180
to a two or a four-legged machine those
 

825
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,090
to a two or a four-legged machine those
principles are really important and and

826
00:15:59,090 --> 00:15:59,100
principles are really important and and
 

827
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:04,329
principles are really important and and
we're definitely a core part of our work

828
00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:04,339
we're definitely a core part of our work
 

829
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:07,069
we're definitely a core part of our work
there's also

830
00:16:07,069 --> 00:16:07,079
there's also
 

831
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:08,750
there's also
you know when we started to pursue

832
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:08,760
you know when we started to pursue
 

833
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,210
you know when we started to pursue
humanoid robots

834
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:11,220
humanoid robots
 

835
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,949
humanoid robots
um there was so much complexity in that

836
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:12,959
um there was so much complexity in that
 

837
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,150
um there was so much complexity in that
machine

838
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:14,160
machine
 

839
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,530
machine
that

840
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:15,540
that
 

841
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,329
that
you know one of the benefits of the

842
00:16:17,329 --> 00:16:17,339
you know one of the benefits of the
 

843
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:19,310
you know one of the benefits of the
humanoid form is you have some intuition

844
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:19,320
humanoid form is you have some intuition
 

845
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,410
humanoid form is you have some intuition
about how it should look while it's

846
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:21,420
about how it should look while it's
 

847
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,569
about how it should look while it's
moving

848
00:16:22,569 --> 00:16:22,579
moving
 

849
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:25,430
moving
and that's a little bit of an art I

850
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:25,440
and that's a little bit of an art I
 

851
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,230
and that's a little bit of an art I
think and now I'd say or maybe it's just

852
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:27,240
think and now I'd say or maybe it's just
 

853
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,030
think and now I'd say or maybe it's just
tapping into a knowledge that you have

854
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,040
tapping into a knowledge that you have
 

855
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,610
tapping into a knowledge that you have
deep in your body and then trying to

856
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:31,620
deep in your body and then trying to
 

857
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,650
deep in your body and then trying to
express that in the machine but that's

858
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:33,660
express that in the machine but that's
 

859
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,990
express that in the machine but that's
an intuition that's a little bit more on

860
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:36,000
an intuition that's a little bit more on
 

861
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,810
an intuition that's a little bit more on
the art side maybe it it predates your

862
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:38,820
the art side maybe it it predates your
 

863
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,550
the art side maybe it it predates your
knowledge you know before you have the

864
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:40,560
knowledge you know before you have the
 

865
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,050
knowledge you know before you have the
knowledge of how to control it you try

866
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:42,060
knowledge of how to control it you try
 

867
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,030
knowledge of how to control it you try
to work through the Art Channel and

868
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:44,040
to work through the Art Channel and
 

869
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,769
to work through the Art Channel and
humanoids sort of make that available to

870
00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:45,779
humanoids sort of make that available to
 

871
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:47,150
humanoids sort of make that available to
you if it had been a different shape

872
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:47,160
you if it had been a different shape
 

873
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,949
you if it had been a different shape
maybe we wouldn't have had the same

874
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:48,959
maybe we wouldn't have had the same
 

875
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,189
maybe we wouldn't have had the same
intuition about it yeah so you're

876
00:16:52,189 --> 00:16:52,199
intuition about it yeah so you're
 

877
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:54,590
intuition about it yeah so you're
knowledge about moving through the world

878
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:54,600
knowledge about moving through the world
 

879
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,530
knowledge about moving through the world
is not made explicit to you

880
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:57,540
is not made explicit to you
 

881
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,930
is not made explicit to you
so you just that's why it's art and it

882
00:16:59,930 --> 00:16:59,940
so you just that's why it's art and it
 

883
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,129
so you just that's why it's art and it
might yeah it might be hard to actually

884
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:01,139
might yeah it might be hard to actually
 

885
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:03,889
might yeah it might be hard to actually
articulate exactly you know there's

886
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:03,899
articulate exactly you know there's
 

887
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:04,909
articulate exactly you know there's
something about

888
00:17:04,909 --> 00:17:04,919
something about
 

889
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:07,189
something about
um and being a competitive uh athlete

890
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:07,199
um and being a competitive uh athlete
 

891
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,750
um and being a competitive uh athlete
there's something about

892
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:08,760
there's something about
 

893
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,289
there's something about
seeing a movement you know a coach one

894
00:17:12,289 --> 00:17:12,299
seeing a movement you know a coach one
 

895
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:13,970
seeing a movement you know a coach one
of their greatest strengths a coach has

896
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:13,980
of their greatest strengths a coach has
 

897
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,669
of their greatest strengths a coach has
is being able to see you know some

898
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:16,679
is being able to see you know some
 

899
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:18,289
is being able to see you know some
little change in what the athlete is

900
00:17:18,289 --> 00:17:18,299
little change in what the athlete is
 

901
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:20,090
little change in what the athlete is
doing and then being able to articulate

902
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:20,100
doing and then being able to articulate
 

903
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,590
doing and then being able to articulate
that to the athlete you know and then

904
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:21,600
that to the athlete you know and then
 

905
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,390
that to the athlete you know and then
maybe even trying to say and you should

906
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:23,400
maybe even trying to say and you should
 

907
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,850
maybe even trying to say and you should
try to feel this

908
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:25,860
try to feel this
 

909
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,610
try to feel this
um so there's something just in scene

910
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:27,620
um so there's something just in scene
 

911
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:31,010
um so there's something just in scene
and again you know sometimes it's hard

912
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:31,020
and again you know sometimes it's hard
 

913
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,510
and again you know sometimes it's hard
to articulate what it is you're seeing

914
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:32,520
to articulate what it is you're seeing
 

915
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,430
to articulate what it is you're seeing
but there's a

916
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:34,440
but there's a
 

917
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,690
but there's a
receiving the motion at a rate that is

918
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:38,700
receiving the motion at a rate that is
 

919
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,110
receiving the motion at a rate that is
again sometimes hard to put into words

920
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:41,120
again sometimes hard to put into words
 

921
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,310
again sometimes hard to put into words
yeah I

922
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:43,320
yeah I
 

923
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,130
yeah I
Wonder

924
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:45,140
Wonder
 

925
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,810
Wonder
how it is possible to achieve sort of

926
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:47,820
how it is possible to achieve sort of
 

927
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,330
how it is possible to achieve sort of
truly elegant movement you have a movie

928
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:50,340
truly elegant movement you have a movie
 

929
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,490
truly elegant movement you have a movie
like ex machina I'm not sure if you've

930
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:52,500
like ex machina I'm not sure if you've
 

931
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,669
like ex machina I'm not sure if you've
seen it but the main actress in that who

932
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:55,679
seen it but the main actress in that who
 

933
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,830
seen it but the main actress in that who
plays the AI robot I think is a

934
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:57,840
plays the AI robot I think is a
 

935
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,150
plays the AI robot I think is a
ballerina I mean just a natural

936
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:01,160
ballerina I mean just a natural
 

937
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,610
ballerina I mean just a natural
elegance and the I don't know eloquence

938
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:04,620
elegance and the I don't know eloquence
 

939
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,750
elegance and the I don't know eloquence
of movement

940
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:05,760
of movement
 

941
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,130
of movement
it's it's it looks efficient and easy

942
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:10,140
it's it's it looks efficient and easy
 

943
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:13,070
it's it's it looks efficient and easy
and just it looks right

944
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:13,080
and just it looks right
 

945
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,049
and just it looks right
it looks it looks right is sort of the

946
00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:15,059
it looks it looks right is sort of the
 

947
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:17,510
it looks it looks right is sort of the
key yeah and then you you look at uh

948
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:17,520
key yeah and then you you look at uh
 

949
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,430
key yeah and then you you look at uh
especially early robots I mean they

950
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:19,440
especially early robots I mean they
 

951
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,710
especially early robots I mean they
they're so cautious in in the way they

952
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:21,720
they're so cautious in in the way they
 

953
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,590
they're so cautious in in the way they
move that

954
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:24,600
move that
 

955
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,690
move that
it's not it's not the caution that looks

956
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:26,700
it's not it's not the caution that looks
 

957
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,210
it's not it's not the caution that looks
wrong it's it's something about the

958
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:29,220
wrong it's it's something about the
 

959
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,890
wrong it's it's something about the
movement that looks wrong that feels

960
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:30,900
movement that looks wrong that feels
 

961
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,830
movement that looks wrong that feels
like it's very inefficient unnecessarily

962
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:33,840
like it's very inefficient unnecessarily
 

963
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,549
like it's very inefficient unnecessarily
so and it's hard to put that into words

964
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:36,559
so and it's hard to put that into words
 

965
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,250
so and it's hard to put that into words
exactly we think that and part of the

966
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:40,260
exactly we think that and part of the
 

967
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,990
exactly we think that and part of the
reason why people are attracted to the

968
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:42,000
reason why people are attracted to the
 

969
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,730
reason why people are attracted to the
machines we build

970
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:43,740
machines we build
 

971
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,190
machines we build
is because the inherent dynamics of

972
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:46,200
is because the inherent dynamics of
 

973
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,850
is because the inherent dynamics of
movement are are closer to right

974
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:49,860
movement are are closer to right
 

975
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,610
movement are are closer to right
um because we we try to use you know

976
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:52,620
um because we we try to use you know
 

977
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,169
um because we we try to use you know
walking Gates or we build a machine

978
00:18:54,169 --> 00:18:54,179
walking Gates or we build a machine
 

979
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:56,450
walking Gates or we build a machine
around this gate where you're trying to

980
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:56,460
around this gate where you're trying to
 

981
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,430
around this gate where you're trying to
work with the Dynamics of the machine

982
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:58,440
work with the Dynamics of the machine
 

983
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,930
work with the Dynamics of the machine
instead of

984
00:18:59,930 --> 00:18:59,940
instead of
 

985
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,970
instead of
to stop them you know some of the early

986
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:01,980
to stop them you know some of the early
 

987
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,470
to stop them you know some of the early
walking machines

988
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:03,480
walking machines
 

989
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,870
walking machines
you know you're essentially you're

990
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:05,880
you know you're essentially you're
 

991
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,730
you know you're essentially you're
really trying hard to not let them fall

992
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:07,740
really trying hard to not let them fall
 

993
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,010
really trying hard to not let them fall
over and so you're always stopping the

994
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:10,020
over and so you're always stopping the
 

995
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,810
over and so you're always stopping the
Tipping motion you know

996
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:11,820
Tipping motion you know
 

997
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,690
Tipping motion you know
and sort of the insight

998
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:14,700
and sort of the insight
 

999
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,210
and sort of the insight
of dynamic stability and a lighted

1000
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:17,220
of dynamic stability and a lighted
 

1001
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,610
of dynamic stability and a lighted
machine is to go with it you know let

1002
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:19,620
machine is to go with it you know let
 

1003
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,770
machine is to go with it you know let
the Tipping happen you know let yourself

1004
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:21,780
the Tipping happen you know let yourself
 

1005
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,810
the Tipping happen you know let yourself
fall but then catch her catch yourself

1006
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:23,820
fall but then catch her catch yourself
 

1007
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,370
fall but then catch her catch yourself
with that next foot and there's

1008
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:25,380
with that next foot and there's
 

1009
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,590
with that next foot and there's
something about getting those physics to

1010
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:27,600
something about getting those physics to
 

1011
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,570
something about getting those physics to
be expressed in the machine

1012
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:29,580
be expressed in the machine
 

1013
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,870
be expressed in the machine
that people interpret as

1014
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:32,880
that people interpret as
 

1015
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,490
that people interpret as
lifelike or or elegant or just natural

1016
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:37,500
lifelike or or elegant or just natural
 

1017
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,470
lifelike or or elegant or just natural
looking and so I think if you get the

1018
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:39,480
looking and so I think if you get the
 

1019
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,970
looking and so I think if you get the
physics right

1020
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:40,980
physics right
 

1021
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,890
physics right
it also ends up being more efficient

1022
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:42,900
it also ends up being more efficient
 

1023
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,390
it also ends up being more efficient
likely

1024
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:44,400
likely
 

1025
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,010
likely
there's a benefit that it probably ends

1026
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:46,020
there's a benefit that it probably ends
 

1027
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,390
there's a benefit that it probably ends
up being

1028
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:47,400
up being
 

1029
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,730
up being
more stable in the long run you know it

1030
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:49,740
more stable in the long run you know it
 

1031
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,770
more stable in the long run you know it
could it could walk stably over a wider

1032
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:51,780
could it could walk stably over a wider
 

1033
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,850
could it could walk stably over a wider
uh rain range of conditions

1034
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:54,860
uh rain range of conditions
 

1035
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,409
uh rain range of conditions
and it's uh and it's more beautiful and

1036
00:19:57,409 --> 00:19:57,419
and it's uh and it's more beautiful and
 

1037
00:19:57,419 --> 00:19:59,690
and it's uh and it's more beautiful and
attractive at the same time so how hard

1038
00:19:59,690 --> 00:19:59,700
attractive at the same time so how hard
 

1039
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,529
attractive at the same time so how hard
is it to get the humanoid robot Atlas

1040
00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:03,539
is it to get the humanoid robot Atlas
 

1041
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:05,330
is it to get the humanoid robot Atlas
to do some of the things that's recently

1042
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:05,340
to do some of the things that's recently
 

1043
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,310
to do some of the things that's recently
been doing let's forget the flips and

1044
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:07,320
been doing let's forget the flips and
 

1045
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,289
been doing let's forget the flips and
all of that let's just look at the

1046
00:20:09,289 --> 00:20:09,299
all of that let's just look at the
 

1047
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:10,190
all of that let's just look at the
running

1048
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:10,200
running
 

1049
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,930
running
maybe you can correct me but there's

1050
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:11,940
maybe you can correct me but there's
 

1051
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,610
maybe you can correct me but there's
something about running I mean that's

1052
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:13,620
something about running I mean that's
 

1053
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,409
something about running I mean that's
not careful at all that's you're falling

1054
00:20:15,409 --> 00:20:15,419
not careful at all that's you're falling
 

1055
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:16,430
not careful at all that's you're falling
forward

1056
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:16,440
forward
 

1057
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,930
forward
you're jumping forward and they're

1058
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:17,940
you're jumping forward and they're
 

1059
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,909
you're jumping forward and they're
falling so how hard is it to get that

1060
00:20:19,909 --> 00:20:19,919
falling so how hard is it to get that
 

1061
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,630
falling so how hard is it to get that
right our first humanoid we needed to

1062
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:23,640
right our first humanoid we needed to
 

1063
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,549
right our first humanoid we needed to
deliver natural looking walking you know

1064
00:20:25,549 --> 00:20:25,559
deliver natural looking walking you know
 

1065
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:28,010
deliver natural looking walking you know
we took a contract uh from the army they

1066
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:28,020
we took a contract uh from the army they
 

1067
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,010
we took a contract uh from the army they
wanted a robot that could walk naturally

1068
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:31,020
wanted a robot that could walk naturally
 

1069
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,890
wanted a robot that could walk naturally
they wanted to put a suit on the robot

1070
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:33,900
they wanted to put a suit on the robot
 

1071
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,570
they wanted to put a suit on the robot
and be able to test it in a gas

1072
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:35,580
and be able to test it in a gas
 

1073
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:38,150
and be able to test it in a gas
environment and so they wanted that the

1074
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:38,160
environment and so they wanted that the
 

1075
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,270
environment and so they wanted that the
motion to be natural

1076
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:40,280
motion to be natural
 

1077
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,770
motion to be natural
and so our goal was a natural looking

1078
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:42,780
and so our goal was a natural looking
 

1079
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,289
and so our goal was a natural looking
gate it was real it was surprisingly

1080
00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:45,299
gate it was real it was surprisingly
 

1081
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:47,570
gate it was real it was surprisingly
hard to get that to work

1082
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:47,580
hard to get that to work
 

1083
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:51,070
hard to get that to work
and we but we did build an early machine

1084
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:51,080
and we but we did build an early machine
 

1085
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,750
and we but we did build an early machine
we called it pet man prototype it was

1086
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:53,760
we called it pet man prototype it was
 

1087
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,110
we called it pet man prototype it was
the Prototype before the Pac-Man robot

1088
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:57,120
the Prototype before the Pac-Man robot
 

1089
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,490
the Prototype before the Pac-Man robot
and it had a really nice looking

1090
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:00,500
and it had a really nice looking
 

1091
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,529
and it had a really nice looking
gate where you know it would stick the

1092
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:03,539
gate where you know it would stick the
 

1093
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:05,390
gate where you know it would stick the
leg out it would do heel strike first

1094
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:05,400
leg out it would do heel strike first
 

1095
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,250
leg out it would do heel strike first
before it rolled onto the toe so you

1096
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:07,260
before it rolled onto the toe so you
 

1097
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,750
before it rolled onto the toe so you
didn't land with a flat foot you

1098
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:08,760
didn't land with a flat foot you
 

1099
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,110
didn't land with a flat foot you
extended your leg a little bit

1100
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:11,120
extended your leg a little bit
 

1101
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,669
extended your leg a little bit
but even then it was hard to get the

1102
00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:13,679
but even then it was hard to get the
 

1103
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,710
but even then it was hard to get the
robot to walk where when you're walking

1104
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:15,720
robot to walk where when you're walking
 

1105
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,169
robot to walk where when you're walking
that it fully extended its leg and

1106
00:21:18,169 --> 00:21:18,179
that it fully extended its leg and
 

1107
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:20,090
that it fully extended its leg and
essentially landed on an extended leg

1108
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:20,100
essentially landed on an extended leg
 

1109
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,010
essentially landed on an extended leg
and if you watch closely how you walk

1110
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:22,020
and if you watch closely how you walk
 

1111
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,230
and if you watch closely how you walk
you probably land on an extended leg but

1112
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:24,240
you probably land on an extended leg but
 

1113
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,029
you probably land on an extended leg but
then you immediately flex your knee as

1114
00:21:26,029 --> 00:21:26,039
then you immediately flex your knee as
 

1115
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:28,010
then you immediately flex your knee as
you start to make that contact

1116
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:28,020
you start to make that contact
 

1117
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,950
you start to make that contact
and getting that all to work well

1118
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:30,960
and getting that all to work well
 

1119
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,310
and getting that all to work well
took such a long time in fact I I

1120
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:34,320
took such a long time in fact I I
 

1121
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,590
took such a long time in fact I I
probably didn't really see the nice

1122
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:36,600
probably didn't really see the nice
 

1123
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,990
probably didn't really see the nice
natural walking that I expected out of

1124
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:39,000
natural walking that I expected out of
 

1125
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,409
natural walking that I expected out of
our humanoids until maybe last year

1126
00:21:42,409 --> 00:21:42,419
our humanoids until maybe last year
 

1127
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:45,049
our humanoids until maybe last year
and the team was developing on our newer

1128
00:21:45,049 --> 00:21:45,059
and the team was developing on our newer
 

1129
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:47,149
and the team was developing on our newer
generation of Atlas you know some new

1130
00:21:47,149 --> 00:21:47,159
generation of Atlas you know some new
 

1131
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:48,830
generation of Atlas you know some new
techniques

1132
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:48,840
techniques
 

1133
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,350
techniques
um uh for developing a walking control

1134
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:51,360
um uh for developing a walking control
 

1135
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,390
um uh for developing a walking control
algorithm and they got that natural

1136
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:53,400
algorithm and they got that natural
 

1137
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,270
algorithm and they got that natural
looking motion as sort of a byproduct of

1138
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:56,280
looking motion as sort of a byproduct of
 

1139
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,730
looking motion as sort of a byproduct of
a just a different process they were

1140
00:21:58,730 --> 00:21:58,740
a just a different process they were
 

1141
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,669
a just a different process they were
applying to developing the control

1142
00:22:01,669 --> 00:22:01,679
applying to developing the control
 

1143
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,090
applying to developing the control
so that probably took 15 years 10 to 15

1144
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:05,100
so that probably took 15 years 10 to 15
 

1145
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,490
so that probably took 15 years 10 to 15
years to sort of get that from from you

1146
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:07,500
years to sort of get that from from you
 

1147
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,890
years to sort of get that from from you
know the Petman prototype was probably

1148
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:09,900
know the Petman prototype was probably
 

1149
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,669
know the Petman prototype was probably
in 2008 and what was it 2022 last year

1150
00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:13,679
in 2008 and what was it 2022 last year
 

1151
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,230
in 2008 and what was it 2022 last year
that I think I saw a good walking on

1152
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:15,240
that I think I saw a good walking on
 

1153
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,510
that I think I saw a good walking on
Atlas if you could just like Linger on

1154
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:17,520
Atlas if you could just like Linger on
 

1155
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,070
Atlas if you could just like Linger on
it what are some challenges of getting

1156
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:19,080
it what are some challenges of getting
 

1157
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,909
it what are some challenges of getting
good walking so is it uh

1158
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:22,919
good walking so is it uh
 

1159
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:25,250
good walking so is it uh
is this is this partially like a

1160
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:25,260
is this is this partially like a
 

1161
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,950
is this is this partially like a
hardware like actuator problem is it the

1162
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:27,960
hardware like actuator problem is it the
 

1163
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,649
hardware like actuator problem is it the
control is it the artistic element of

1164
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:30,659
control is it the artistic element of
 

1165
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:31,850
control is it the artistic element of
just observing the whole system

1166
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:31,860
just observing the whole system
 

1167
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,350
just observing the whole system
operating in different conditions

1168
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:33,360
operating in different conditions
 

1169
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,390
operating in different conditions
together I mean is there some kind of

1170
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:35,400
together I mean is there some kind of
 

1171
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,390
together I mean is there some kind of
interesting

1172
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:37,400
interesting
 

1173
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,830
interesting
quirks or challenges you can speak to

1174
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:39,840
quirks or challenges you can speak to
 

1175
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,230
quirks or challenges you can speak to
like the heel strike yeah so one of the

1176
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:42,240
like the heel strike yeah so one of the
 

1177
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,090
like the heel strike yeah so one of the
things that makes the like this straight

1178
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:44,100
things that makes the like this straight
 

1179
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,510
things that makes the like this straight
leg uh a challenge is you're sort of up

1180
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:47,520
leg uh a challenge is you're sort of up
 

1181
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,630
leg uh a challenge is you're sort of up
against a singularity a mathematical

1182
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:50,640
against a singularity a mathematical
 

1183
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,610
against a singularity a mathematical
single Singularity where you know when

1184
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:52,620
single Singularity where you know when
 

1185
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,710
single Singularity where you know when
your leg is fully extended it can't go

1186
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:54,720
your leg is fully extended it can't go
 

1187
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,149
your leg is fully extended it can't go
further the other direction right

1188
00:22:56,149 --> 00:22:56,159
further the other direction right
 

1189
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,250
further the other direction right
there's only you can only move in One

1190
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:58,260
there's only you can only move in One
 

1191
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,289
there's only you can only move in One
Direction and that makes all of the

1192
00:23:00,289 --> 00:23:00,299
Direction and that makes all of the
 

1193
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:02,930
Direction and that makes all of the
calculations around how to produce

1194
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:02,940
calculations around how to produce
 

1195
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:06,289
calculations around how to produce
twerks at that joint or positions makes

1196
00:23:06,289 --> 00:23:06,299
twerks at that joint or positions makes
 

1197
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:09,110
twerks at that joint or positions makes
it more complicated and so having all

1198
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:09,120
it more complicated and so having all
 

1199
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,350
it more complicated and so having all
the mathematics so it can deal with

1200
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:11,360
the mathematics so it can deal with
 

1201
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,470
the mathematics so it can deal with
these singular configurations is one of

1202
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:15,480
these singular configurations is one of
 

1203
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:20,450
these singular configurations is one of
many challenges uh that we face and I'd

1204
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:20,460
many challenges uh that we face and I'd
 

1205
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,250
many challenges uh that we face and I'd
say in in the

1206
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:22,260
say in in the
 

1207
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,169
say in in the
you know in those earlier days again we

1208
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:24,179
you know in those earlier days again we
 

1209
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:25,190
you know in those earlier days again we
were working with these really

1210
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:25,200
were working with these really
 

1211
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,110
were working with these really
simplified models

1212
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:27,120
simplified models
 

1213
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,510
simplified models
so we're trying to boil all the physics

1214
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:29,520
so we're trying to boil all the physics
 

1215
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,930
so we're trying to boil all the physics
of the complex human body into a simpler

1216
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:32,940
of the complex human body into a simpler
 

1217
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,090
of the complex human body into a simpler
subsystem that we can more easily

1218
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:35,100
subsystem that we can more easily
 

1219
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,549
subsystem that we can more easily
describe in mathematics and sometimes

1220
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:37,559
describe in mathematics and sometimes
 

1221
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:40,010
describe in mathematics and sometimes
those simpler subsystems don't have all

1222
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:40,020
those simpler subsystems don't have all
 

1223
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,470
those simpler subsystems don't have all
of that complexity of the straight leg

1224
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:42,480
of that complexity of the straight leg
 

1225
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,590
of that complexity of the straight leg
built into them and so what's happened

1226
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:45,600
built into them and so what's happened
 

1227
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,630
built into them and so what's happened
more recently is we're able to apply

1228
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:47,640
more recently is we're able to apply
 

1229
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,250
more recently is we're able to apply
techniques that let us take the full

1230
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:49,260
techniques that let us take the full
 

1231
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:54,350
techniques that let us take the full
physics of the robot into account and

1232
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:54,360
physics of the robot into account and
 

1233
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,630
physics of the robot into account and
and deal with some of those strange

1234
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:56,640
and deal with some of those strange
 

1235
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,430
and deal with some of those strange
situations like this like the straight

1236
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:58,440
situations like this like the straight
 

1237
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,710
situations like this like the straight
leg so is there a fundamental challenge

1238
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:00,720
leg so is there a fundamental challenge
 

1239
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,169
leg so is there a fundamental challenge
here that it's uh maybe you can correct

1240
00:24:03,169 --> 00:24:03,179
here that it's uh maybe you can correct
 

1241
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:05,630
here that it's uh maybe you can correct
me but is it under actuated are you

1242
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:05,640
me but is it under actuated are you
 

1243
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,149
me but is it under actuated are you
falling under actuated is the right word

1244
00:24:08,149 --> 00:24:08,159
falling under actuated is the right word
 

1245
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,610
falling under actuated is the right word
right you can't you can't uh push the

1246
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:10,620
right you can't you can't uh push the
 

1247
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,770
right you can't you can't uh push the
robot in any direction you want to right

1248
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:12,780
robot in any direction you want to right
 

1249
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,930
robot in any direction you want to right
and so that that is one of the hard

1250
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:14,940
and so that that is one of the hard
 

1251
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,270
and so that that is one of the hard
problems of of uh like at Locomotion and

1252
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:17,280
problems of of uh like at Locomotion and
 

1253
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,630
problems of of uh like at Locomotion and
you have to do that for natural movement

1254
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:19,640
you have to do that for natural movement
 

1255
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,590
you have to do that for natural movement
it's not necessarily required for

1256
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:21,600
it's not necessarily required for
 

1257
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,350
it's not necessarily required for
natural movement it's just required

1258
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:24,360
natural movement it's just required
 

1259
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,990
natural movement it's just required
you know we don't have you know a

1260
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:27,000
you know we don't have you know a
 

1261
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,310
you know we don't have you know a
gravity force that you can hook yourself

1262
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:28,320
gravity force that you can hook yourself
 

1263
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,549
gravity force that you can hook yourself
onto to apply uh an external force in

1264
00:24:31,549 --> 00:24:31,559
onto to apply uh an external force in
 

1265
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:32,990
onto to apply uh an external force in
the direction you want at all times

1266
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:33,000
the direction you want at all times
 

1267
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,149
the direction you want at all times
right the only the only external forces

1268
00:24:35,149 --> 00:24:35,159
right the only the only external forces
 

1269
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:37,430
right the only the only external forces
are being mediated through your feet and

1270
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:37,440
are being mediated through your feet and
 

1271
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,110
are being mediated through your feet and
how they get mediated depend on how you

1272
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:39,120
how they get mediated depend on how you
 

1273
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,289
how they get mediated depend on how you
place your feet and uh you know you

1274
00:24:42,289 --> 00:24:42,299
place your feet and uh you know you
 

1275
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:44,810
place your feet and uh you know you
can't just uh you know God's hand can't

1276
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:44,820
can't just uh you know God's hand can't
 

1277
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,909
can't just uh you know God's hand can't
reach down and give and push in any

1278
00:24:46,909 --> 00:24:46,919
reach down and give and push in any
 

1279
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:49,970
reach down and give and push in any
direction you want you know so is there

1280
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:49,980
direction you want you know so is there
 

1281
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,190
direction you want you know so is there
uh is there some extra challenge to the

1282
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:52,200
uh is there some extra challenge to the
 

1283
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,110
uh is there some extra challenge to the
fact that Alice is such a big robot

1284
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:54,120
fact that Alice is such a big robot
 

1285
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:58,210
fact that Alice is such a big robot
there is the humanoid form is um

1286
00:24:58,210 --> 00:24:58,220
there is the humanoid form is um
 

1287
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,649
there is the humanoid form is um
attractive in many ways but it's also a

1288
00:25:00,649 --> 00:25:00,659
attractive in many ways but it's also a
 

1289
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:02,510
attractive in many ways but it's also a
challenge in many ways

1290
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:02,520
challenge in many ways
 

1291
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,190
challenge in many ways
um

1292
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:03,200
um
 

1293
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,110
um
you have this big upper body that has a

1294
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:06,120
you have this big upper body that has a
 

1295
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,630
you have this big upper body that has a
lot of mass and inertia

1296
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:08,640
lot of mass and inertia
 

1297
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,570
lot of mass and inertia
um and throwing that inertia around

1298
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:10,580
um and throwing that inertia around
 

1299
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,950
um and throwing that inertia around
increases the complexity of maintaining

1300
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:12,960
increases the complexity of maintaining
 

1301
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,110
increases the complexity of maintaining
balance and as soon as you pick up

1302
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:15,120
balance and as soon as you pick up
 

1303
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,850
balance and as soon as you pick up
something heavy in your arms you've made

1304
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:16,860
something heavy in your arms you've made
 

1305
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,950
something heavy in your arms you've made
that problem even harder

1306
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:18,960
that problem even harder
 

1307
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,850
that problem even harder
and so uh in the early work in the leg

1308
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:22,860
and so uh in the early work in the leg
 

1309
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,890
and so uh in the early work in the leg
lab and in the early days at the company

1310
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:24,900
lab and in the early days at the company
 

1311
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,289
lab and in the early days at the company
and we were pursuing these quadruped

1312
00:25:27,289 --> 00:25:27,299
and we were pursuing these quadruped
 

1313
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:30,230
and we were pursuing these quadruped
robots which had a a kind of built-in

1314
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:30,240
robots which had a a kind of built-in
 

1315
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,090
robots which had a a kind of built-in
simplification you had this big rigid

1316
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:32,100
simplification you had this big rigid
 

1317
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,909
simplification you had this big rigid
body and then really light legs so when

1318
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:34,919
body and then really light legs so when
 

1319
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:36,350
body and then really light legs so when
you swing the legs

1320
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:36,360
you swing the legs
 

1321
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,710
you swing the legs
the leg motion didn't impact the body

1322
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:39,720
the leg motion didn't impact the body
 

1323
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,330
the leg motion didn't impact the body
motion very much

1324
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:41,340
motion very much
 

1325
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,250
motion very much
all the mass and inertia was in the body

1326
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:43,260
all the mass and inertia was in the body
 

1327
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,409
all the mass and inertia was in the body
but when you have the humanoid that

1328
00:25:45,409 --> 00:25:45,419
but when you have the humanoid that
 

1329
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:47,269
but when you have the humanoid that
doesn't work you have big heavy legs you

1330
00:25:47,269 --> 00:25:47,279
doesn't work you have big heavy legs you
 

1331
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,769
doesn't work you have big heavy legs you
swing the legs it affects everything

1332
00:25:48,769 --> 00:25:48,779
swing the legs it affects everything
 

1333
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:49,909
swing the legs it affects everything
else

1334
00:25:49,909 --> 00:25:49,919
else
 

1335
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,230
else
and so

1336
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:51,240
and so
 

1337
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,169
and so
dealing with all of that interaction

1338
00:25:54,169 --> 00:25:54,179
dealing with all of that interaction
 

1339
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:56,390
dealing with all of that interaction
does make the humanoid a much more

1340
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:56,400
does make the humanoid a much more
 

1341
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,950
does make the humanoid a much more
complicated platform

1342
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:57,960
complicated platform
 

1343
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,830
complicated platform
and I also saw that at least recently

1344
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:00,840
and I also saw that at least recently
 

1345
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,930
and I also saw that at least recently
you've been doing more explicit modeling

1346
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:02,940
you've been doing more explicit modeling
 

1347
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,990
you've been doing more explicit modeling
of the stuff you pick up yeah which is

1348
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:06,000
of the stuff you pick up yeah which is
 

1349
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,269
of the stuff you pick up yeah which is
very real

1350
00:26:08,269 --> 00:26:08,279
very real
 

1351
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:10,549
very real
um really interesting so you have to

1352
00:26:10,549 --> 00:26:10,559
um really interesting so you have to
 

1353
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,490
um really interesting so you have to
what model the shape

1354
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:13,500
what model the shape
 

1355
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,790
what model the shape
the weight distribution

1356
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:14,800
the weight distribution
 

1357
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,950
the weight distribution
[Music]

1358
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:15,960
[Music]
 

1359
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,350
[Music]
I don't know what like you have to under

1360
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:18,360
I don't know what like you have to under
 

1361
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,850
I don't know what like you have to under
like include that as part of the

1362
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:19,860
like include that as part of the
 

1363
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,010
like include that as part of the
modeling as part of the planning because

1364
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:22,020
modeling as part of the planning because
 

1365
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,169
modeling as part of the planning because
okay so for people who don't know

1366
00:26:24,169 --> 00:26:24,179
okay so for people who don't know
 

1367
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:26,930
okay so for people who don't know
uh so Atlas at least in like a recent

1368
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:26,940
uh so Atlas at least in like a recent
 

1369
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,810
uh so Atlas at least in like a recent
video like throws a heavy bag throws a

1370
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:29,820
video like throws a heavy bag throws a
 

1371
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,029
video like throws a heavy bag throws a
bunch of stuff

1372
00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:31,039
bunch of stuff
 

1373
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,890
bunch of stuff
so what what's involved in uh picking up

1374
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:33,900
so what what's involved in uh picking up
 

1375
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,130
so what what's involved in uh picking up
a thing a heavy thing

1376
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:36,140
a thing a heavy thing
 

1377
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:39,049
a thing a heavy thing
uh and when that thing is a bunch of

1378
00:26:39,049 --> 00:26:39,059
uh and when that thing is a bunch of
 

1379
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:41,090
uh and when that thing is a bunch of
different non-standard things I think it

1380
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:41,100
different non-standard things I think it
 

1381
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,370
different non-standard things I think it
also picked up like a barbell

1382
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:43,380
also picked up like a barbell
 

1383
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,769
also picked up like a barbell
and to be able to throw in some cases

1384
00:26:45,769 --> 00:26:45,779
and to be able to throw in some cases
 

1385
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:47,390
and to be able to throw in some cases
what are some interesting challenges

1386
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:47,400
what are some interesting challenges
 

1387
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,529
what are some interesting challenges
there

1388
00:26:48,529 --> 00:26:48,539
there
 

1389
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:50,570
there
so we were definitely trying to show

1390
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:50,580
so we were definitely trying to show
 

1391
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,610
so we were definitely trying to show
that the robot and the techniques were

1392
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:52,620
that the robot and the techniques were
 

1393
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:55,610
that the robot and the techniques were
applying to the robe uh to Atlas let us

1394
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:55,620
applying to the robe uh to Atlas let us
 

1395
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:58,130
applying to the robe uh to Atlas let us
deal with heavy things in the world

1396
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:58,140
deal with heavy things in the world
 

1397
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,390
deal with heavy things in the world
because if the robot's going to be

1398
00:26:59,390 --> 00:26:59,400
because if the robot's going to be
 

1399
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,430
because if the robot's going to be
useful it's actually got to move stuff

1400
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:01,440
useful it's actually got to move stuff
 

1401
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,990
useful it's actually got to move stuff
around yeah and that and that needs to

1402
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:03,000
around yeah and that and that needs to
 

1403
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,090
around yeah and that and that needs to
be significant stuff that's an

1404
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:05,100
be significant stuff that's an
 

1405
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,950
be significant stuff that's an
appreciable portion of the the body

1406
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:06,960
appreciable portion of the the body
 

1407
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,870
appreciable portion of the the body
weight of the robot

1408
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:08,880
weight of the robot
 

1409
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,970
weight of the robot
and we also think this differentiates us

1410
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:10,980
and we also think this differentiates us
 

1411
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,190
and we also think this differentiates us
from the other humanoid robot activities

1412
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:13,200
from the other humanoid robot activities
 

1413
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,750
from the other humanoid robot activities
that you're seeing out there mostly

1414
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:14,760
that you're seeing out there mostly
 

1415
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,610
that you're seeing out there mostly
they're not picking stuff up yet

1416
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:16,620
they're not picking stuff up yet
 

1417
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:19,370
they're not picking stuff up yet
and not heavy stuff anyway

1418
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:19,380
and not heavy stuff anyway
 

1419
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,350
and not heavy stuff anyway
um but just like you or me you know you

1420
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:21,360
um but just like you or me you know you
 

1421
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,850
um but just like you or me you know you
need to anticipate that moment you know

1422
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:22,860
need to anticipate that moment you know
 

1423
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,169
need to anticipate that moment you know
you're reaching out to pick something up

1424
00:27:24,169 --> 00:27:24,179
you're reaching out to pick something up
 

1425
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:25,610
you're reaching out to pick something up
and as soon as you pick it up your

1426
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:25,620
and as soon as you pick it up your
 

1427
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,529
and as soon as you pick it up your
center of mass is going to shift

1428
00:27:27,529 --> 00:27:27,539
center of mass is going to shift
 

1429
00:27:27,539 --> 00:27:30,769
center of mass is going to shift
and if you're gonna you know turn in a

1430
00:27:30,769 --> 00:27:30,779
and if you're gonna you know turn in a
 

1431
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:32,390
and if you're gonna you know turn in a
circle you have to take that inertia

1432
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:32,400
circle you have to take that inertia
 

1433
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,250
circle you have to take that inertia
into account and if you're gonna throw a

1434
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:34,260
into account and if you're gonna throw a
 

1435
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,769
into account and if you're gonna throw a
thing you know you've got all of that

1436
00:27:36,769 --> 00:27:36,779
thing you know you've got all of that
 

1437
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:39,289
thing you know you've got all of that
has to be sort of included in in the

1438
00:27:39,289 --> 00:27:39,299
has to be sort of included in in the
 

1439
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:41,690
has to be sort of included in in the
model of what you're trying to do so the

1440
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:41,700
model of what you're trying to do so the
 

1441
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,730
model of what you're trying to do so the
robot needs to have some idea or

1442
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:43,740
robot needs to have some idea or
 

1443
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,769
robot needs to have some idea or
expectation of what that weight is and

1444
00:27:45,769 --> 00:27:45,779
expectation of what that weight is and
 

1445
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:48,590
expectation of what that weight is and
then and sort of predict you know think

1446
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:48,600
then and sort of predict you know think
 

1447
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,390
then and sort of predict you know think
a couple of seconds ahead how do I

1448
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:50,400
a couple of seconds ahead how do I
 

1449
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,870
a couple of seconds ahead how do I
manage my now my my body plus this big

1450
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:53,880
manage my now my my body plus this big
 

1451
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,570
manage my now my my body plus this big
heavy thing together to get and and

1452
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:56,580
heavy thing together to get and and
 

1453
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:00,529
heavy thing together to get and and
still maintain balance right and so um I

1454
00:28:00,529 --> 00:28:00,539
still maintain balance right and so um I
 

1455
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:04,370
still maintain balance right and so um I
I uh that's a big change for us and I

1456
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:04,380
I uh that's a big change for us and I
 

1457
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,990
I uh that's a big change for us and I
think the tools we've built are really

1458
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:06,000
think the tools we've built are really
 

1459
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,490
think the tools we've built are really
allowing that to happen

1460
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:07,500
allowing that to happen
 

1461
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,529
allowing that to happen
um quickly now some of those motions

1462
00:28:09,529 --> 00:28:09,539
um quickly now some of those motions
 

1463
00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:11,990
um quickly now some of those motions
that you saw in that most recent video

1464
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:12,000
that you saw in that most recent video
 

1465
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,570
that you saw in that most recent video
we were able to create in a matter of

1466
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:14,580
we were able to create in a matter of
 

1467
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,850
we were able to create in a matter of
days it used to be it took six months to

1468
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:16,860
days it used to be it took six months to
 

1469
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,769
days it used to be it took six months to
do anything new you know on your robot

1470
00:28:18,769 --> 00:28:18,779
do anything new you know on your robot
 

1471
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:20,510
do anything new you know on your robot
and and now we're starting to develop

1472
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:20,520
and and now we're starting to develop
 

1473
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,010
and and now we're starting to develop
the tools that let us do that in a

1474
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:22,020
the tools that let us do that in a
 

1475
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,230
the tools that let us do that in a
matter of days and so we think that's

1476
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:24,240
matter of days and so we think that's
 

1477
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,149
matter of days and so we think that's
really exciting it means that the

1478
00:28:26,149 --> 00:28:26,159
really exciting it means that the
 

1479
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:27,890
really exciting it means that the
ability to create new behaviors for the

1480
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:27,900
ability to create new behaviors for the
 

1481
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,590
ability to create new behaviors for the
robot is going to be um

1482
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:30,600
robot is going to be um
 

1483
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,690
robot is going to be um
a quicker process so being able to

1484
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:32,700
a quicker process so being able to
 

1485
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,250
a quicker process so being able to
explicitly model

1486
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:34,260
explicitly model
 

1487
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,350
explicitly model
new things that it might need to pick up

1488
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:36,360
new things that it might need to pick up
 

1489
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,690
new things that it might need to pick up
new type of thing and you know to some

1490
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:38,700
new type of thing and you know to some
 

1491
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,430
new type of thing and you know to some
degree you don't you don't want to have

1492
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:40,440
degree you don't you don't want to have
 

1493
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,010
degree you don't you don't want to have
to pay too much attention to each

1494
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:43,020
to pay too much attention to each
 

1495
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,230
to pay too much attention to each
specific thing right

1496
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:45,240
specific thing right
 

1497
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,789
specific thing right
um there's sort of a generalization here

1498
00:28:46,789 --> 00:28:46,799
um there's sort of a generalization here
 

1499
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,950
um there's sort of a generalization here
yeah

1500
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:48,960
yeah
 

1501
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,409
yeah
um obviously when you grab a thing you

1502
00:28:51,409 --> 00:28:51,419
um obviously when you grab a thing you
 

1503
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:53,570
um obviously when you grab a thing you
have to conform your your hand your end

1504
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:53,580
have to conform your your hand your end
 

1505
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,549
have to conform your your hand your end
effector to the surface of that shape

1506
00:28:55,549 --> 00:28:55,559
effector to the surface of that shape
 

1507
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:57,830
effector to the surface of that shape
but once it's in your hands it's

1508
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:57,840
but once it's in your hands it's
 

1509
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,690
but once it's in your hands it's
probably just the mass and inertia that

1510
00:28:59,690 --> 00:28:59,700
probably just the mass and inertia that
 

1511
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,330
probably just the mass and inertia that
matter and the the shape may not be as

1512
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:02,340
matter and the the shape may not be as
 

1513
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,510
matter and the the shape may not be as
important yeah and so you know for some

1514
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:05,520
important yeah and so you know for some
 

1515
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,070
important yeah and so you know for some
in some ways you want to pay attention

1516
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:07,080
in some ways you want to pay attention
 

1517
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,649
in some ways you want to pay attention
to that detailed shape and in others you

1518
00:29:09,649 --> 00:29:09,659
to that detailed shape and in others you
 

1519
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:11,690
to that detailed shape and in others you
want to generalize it and say uh well

1520
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:11,700
want to generalize it and say uh well
 

1521
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,850
want to generalize it and say uh well
all I really care about is the center of

1522
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:13,860
all I really care about is the center of
 

1523
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,230
all I really care about is the center of
mass of this thing especially if I'm

1524
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:15,240
mass of this thing especially if I'm
 

1525
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,909
mass of this thing especially if I'm
going to throw it up on that scaffolding

1526
00:29:16,909 --> 00:29:16,919
going to throw it up on that scaffolding
 

1527
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:18,889
going to throw it up on that scaffolding
and it's easier if the body is rigid

1528
00:29:18,889 --> 00:29:18,899
and it's easier if the body is rigid
 

1529
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:21,049
and it's easier if the body is rigid
what if it's there's some doesn't it

1530
00:29:21,049 --> 00:29:21,059
what if it's there's some doesn't it
 

1531
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:23,090
what if it's there's some doesn't it
throw like a sandbag type thing that

1532
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:23,100
throw like a sandbag type thing that
 

1533
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,130
throw like a sandbag type thing that
tool bag you know you've had loose had

1534
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:25,140
tool bag you know you've had loose had
 

1535
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,769
tool bag you know you've had loose had
loose stuff in it yeah so it it managed

1536
00:29:27,769 --> 00:29:27,779
loose stuff in it yeah so it it managed
 

1537
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:29,870
loose stuff in it yeah so it it managed
that there are harder things that we

1538
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:29,880
that there are harder things that we
 

1539
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,130
that there are harder things that we
haven't done yet you know we could have

1540
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:31,140
haven't done yet you know we could have
 

1541
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,470
haven't done yet you know we could have
had a big jointed thing or I don't know

1542
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:33,480
had a big jointed thing or I don't know
 

1543
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,450
had a big jointed thing or I don't know
a bunch of loose wire or rope what about

1544
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:35,460
a bunch of loose wire or rope what about
 

1545
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:39,110
a bunch of loose wire or rope what about
carrying another robot how about that

1546
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:39,120

 

1547
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,230

yeah we haven't we haven't done that yet

1548
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:41,240
yeah we haven't we haven't done that yet
 

1549
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,970
yeah we haven't we haven't done that yet
I guess we did a little bit of uh we did

1550
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:43,980
I guess we did a little bit of uh we did
 

1551
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,370
I guess we did a little bit of uh we did
a a little skit around Christmas where

1552
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:46,380
a a little skit around Christmas where
 

1553
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,830
a a little skit around Christmas where
we had two spots holding up another spot

1554
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:48,840
we had two spots holding up another spot
 

1555
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,870
we had two spots holding up another spot
that was trying to put you know a bow on

1556
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:50,880
that was trying to put you know a bow on
 

1557
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,789
that was trying to put you know a bow on
a tree so I guess we're doing that in a

1558
00:29:52,789 --> 00:29:52,799
a tree so I guess we're doing that in a
 

1559
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:53,769
a tree so I guess we're doing that in a
small way

1560
00:29:53,769 --> 00:29:53,779
small way
 

1561
00:29:53,779 --> 00:29:56,630
small way
okay that's pretty good uh let me ask

1562
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:56,640
okay that's pretty good uh let me ask
 

1563
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,610
okay that's pretty good uh let me ask
the all-important question uh do you

1564
00:29:58,610 --> 00:29:58,620
the all-important question uh do you
 

1565
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:02,510
the all-important question uh do you
know how much Atlas can curl goodbye

1566
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:02,520
know how much Atlas can curl goodbye
 

1567
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,970
know how much Atlas can curl goodbye
have you

1568
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:03,980
have you
 

1569
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:06,889
have you
I mean you know this for us humans

1570
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:06,899
I mean you know this for us humans
 

1571
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:08,570
I mean you know this for us humans
that's really one of the most

1572
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:08,580
that's really one of the most
 

1573
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,789
that's really one of the most
fundamental questions you can ask

1574
00:30:10,789 --> 00:30:10,799
fundamental questions you can ask
 

1575
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:15,049
fundamental questions you can ask
another human being a bench it probably

1576
00:30:15,049 --> 00:30:15,059
another human being a bench it probably
 

1577
00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:17,750
another human being a bench it probably
can't curl as much as we can yet but a

1578
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:17,760
can't curl as much as we can yet but a
 

1579
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,870
can't curl as much as we can yet but a
metric that I think is interesting is um

1580
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:20,880
metric that I think is interesting is um
 

1581
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,610
metric that I think is interesting is um
you know another way of looking at that

1582
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:22,620
you know another way of looking at that
 

1583
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,570
you know another way of looking at that
strength

1584
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:23,580
strength
 

1585
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,269
strength
is you know the box jump so if how high

1586
00:30:26,269 --> 00:30:26,279
is you know the box jump so if how high
 

1587
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:30,710
is you know the box jump so if how high
of a box can you jump onto question and

1588
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:30,720
of a box can you jump onto question and
 

1589
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,870
of a box can you jump onto question and
uh Alice I don't know the exact height

1590
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:32,880
uh Alice I don't know the exact height
 

1591
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,490
uh Alice I don't know the exact height
it was probably a meter high or

1592
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:34,500
it was probably a meter high or
 

1593
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,570
it was probably a meter high or
something like that it was a pretty

1594
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:35,580
something like that it was a pretty
 

1595
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,909
something like that it was a pretty
pretty tall jump that Atlas was able to

1596
00:30:37,909 --> 00:30:37,919
pretty tall jump that Atlas was able to
 

1597
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,490
pretty tall jump that Atlas was able to
manage when we last tried to do this and

1598
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:40,500
manage when we last tried to do this and
 

1599
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,310
manage when we last tried to do this and
and I have video of my chief technical

1600
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:43,320
and I have video of my chief technical
 

1601
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,330
and I have video of my chief technical
officer

1602
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:44,340
officer
 

1603
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,070
officer
doing the same jump and he really

1604
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:46,080
doing the same jump and he really
 

1605
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,289
doing the same jump and he really
struggled you know the human but the

1606
00:30:48,289 --> 00:30:48,299
struggled you know the human but the
 

1607
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:50,029
struggled you know the human but the
human getting all the way on top of this

1608
00:30:50,029 --> 00:30:50,039
human getting all the way on top of this
 

1609
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:52,070
human getting all the way on top of this
box but then you know Atlas was able to

1610
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:52,080
box but then you know Atlas was able to
 

1611
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,450
box but then you know Atlas was able to
do it

1612
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:53,460
do it
 

1613
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,669
do it
um we're now thinking about the next

1614
00:30:55,669 --> 00:30:55,679
um we're now thinking about the next
 

1615
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,010
um we're now thinking about the next
generation of Atlas and we're probably

1616
00:30:58,010 --> 00:30:58,020
generation of Atlas and we're probably
 

1617
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,810
generation of Atlas and we're probably
going to be in the realm of a person

1618
00:30:59,810 --> 00:30:59,820
going to be in the realm of a person
 

1619
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,669
going to be in the realm of a person
can't do it you know with this with the

1620
00:31:01,669 --> 00:31:01,679
can't do it you know with this with the
 

1621
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,889
can't do it you know with this with the
Next Generation you know the robots the

1622
00:31:03,889 --> 00:31:03,899
Next Generation you know the robots the
 

1623
00:31:03,899 --> 00:31:05,269
Next Generation you know the robots the
actuators are going to get stronger

1624
00:31:05,269 --> 00:31:05,279
actuators are going to get stronger
 

1625
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,610
actuators are going to get stronger
where there really is the case that at

1626
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:07,620
where there really is the case that at
 

1627
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,810
where there really is the case that at
least some of these joints some of these

1628
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:08,820
least some of these joints some of these
 

1629
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,669
least some of these joints some of these
motions will be stronger and to

1630
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:10,679
motions will be stronger and to
 

1631
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:12,110
motions will be stronger and to
understand how high it can jump you

1632
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:12,120
understand how high it can jump you
 

1633
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,610
understand how high it can jump you
probably had to do quite a bit of

1634
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:13,620
probably had to do quite a bit of
 

1635
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,350
probably had to do quite a bit of
testing oh yeah and there's lots of

1636
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:15,360
testing oh yeah and there's lots of
 

1637
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,090
testing oh yeah and there's lots of
videos of it trying and failing and

1638
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:17,100
videos of it trying and failing and
 

1639
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,370
videos of it trying and failing and
that's you know that's all you know we

1640
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:19,380
that's you know that's all you know we
 

1641
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,870
that's you know that's all you know we
don't always release those those videos

1642
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:20,880
don't always release those those videos
 

1643
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,930
don't always release those those videos
but they're a lot of fun to look at

1644
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:22,940
but they're a lot of fun to look at
 

1645
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:26,029
but they're a lot of fun to look at
uh so we'll talk a little bit about that

1646
00:31:26,029 --> 00:31:26,039
uh so we'll talk a little bit about that
 

1647
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:28,669
uh so we'll talk a little bit about that
uh but if can you talk to the jumping

1648
00:31:28,669 --> 00:31:28,679
uh but if can you talk to the jumping
 

1649
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:30,470
uh but if can you talk to the jumping
because you talked about the walking it

1650
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:30,480
because you talked about the walking it
 

1651
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,330
because you talked about the walking it
took a long time many many years to get

1652
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:32,340
took a long time many many years to get
 

1653
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,850
took a long time many many years to get
the walking to be natural but there's

1654
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:34,860
the walking to be natural but there's
 

1655
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,930
the walking to be natural but there's
also really natural looking

1656
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:37,940
also really natural looking
 

1657
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:41,570
also really natural looking
uh robust resilient jumping how hard is

1658
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:41,580
uh robust resilient jumping how hard is
 

1659
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,070
uh robust resilient jumping how hard is
it to do the jumping

1660
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:43,080
it to do the jumping
 

1661
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,169
it to do the jumping
well again this stuff has really evolved

1662
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:45,179
well again this stuff has really evolved
 

1663
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:47,090
well again this stuff has really evolved
rapidly in the last few years you know

1664
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:47,100
rapidly in the last few years you know
 

1665
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,370
rapidly in the last few years you know
the first time we did a somersault

1666
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:49,380
the first time we did a somersault
 

1667
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,230
the first time we did a somersault
um you know there's a lot of kind of

1668
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:51,240
um you know there's a lot of kind of
 

1669
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,909
um you know there's a lot of kind of
manual iteration

1670
00:31:52,909 --> 00:31:52,919
manual iteration
 

1671
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:55,010
manual iteration
what is the trajectory you know how hard

1672
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:55,020
what is the trajectory you know how hard
 

1673
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,230
what is the trajectory you know how hard
do you throw it in fact in these early

1674
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:57,240
do you throw it in fact in these early
 

1675
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,950
do you throw it in fact in these early
days uh I actually would when I'd see

1676
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:00,960
days uh I actually would when I'd see
 

1677
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,110
days uh I actually would when I'd see
early experiments that the team was

1678
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:03,120
early experiments that the team was
 

1679
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,450
early experiments that the team was
doing I might make suggestions about how

1680
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:05,460
doing I might make suggestions about how
 

1681
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,250
doing I might make suggestions about how
to change the technique again kind of

1682
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:07,260
to change the technique again kind of
 

1683
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,289
to change the technique again kind of
borrowing from my own intuition about

1684
00:32:09,289 --> 00:32:09,299
borrowing from my own intuition about
 

1685
00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:11,510
borrowing from my own intuition about
how backflips work

1686
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:11,520
how backflips work
 

1687
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,049
how backflips work
um

1688
00:32:12,049 --> 00:32:12,059
um
 

1689
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:13,549
um
but frankly they don't need that anymore

1690
00:32:13,549 --> 00:32:13,559
but frankly they don't need that anymore
 

1691
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:16,430
but frankly they don't need that anymore
so in the early days you had to iterate

1692
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:16,440
so in the early days you had to iterate
 

1693
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,549
so in the early days you had to iterate
kind of in almost a manual way trying to

1694
00:32:19,549 --> 00:32:19,559
kind of in almost a manual way trying to
 

1695
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:21,649
kind of in almost a manual way trying to
change these trajectories of the arms or

1696
00:32:21,649 --> 00:32:21,659
change these trajectories of the arms or
 

1697
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:24,710
change these trajectories of the arms or
the legs to try to get you know a

1698
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:24,720
the legs to try to get you know a
 

1699
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,930
the legs to try to get you know a
successful backflip to happen

1700
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:26,940
successful backflip to happen
 

1701
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,389
successful backflip to happen
but more recently we're running

1702
00:32:29,389 --> 00:32:29,399
but more recently we're running
 

1703
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:32,990
but more recently we're running
these model predictive uh control

1704
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:33,000
these model predictive uh control
 

1705
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,110
these model predictive uh control
techniques where we're able to the robot

1706
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:36,120
techniques where we're able to the robot
 

1707
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,810
techniques where we're able to the robot
essentially can think in advance for the

1708
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:38,820
essentially can think in advance for the
 

1709
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:41,750
essentially can think in advance for the
next second or two about how its motion

1710
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:41,760
next second or two about how its motion
 

1711
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,149
next second or two about how its motion
is going to transpire and you can you

1712
00:32:44,149 --> 00:32:44,159
is going to transpire and you can you
 

1713
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,250
is going to transpire and you can you
know solve for optimal trajectories to

1714
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:46,260
know solve for optimal trajectories to
 

1715
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,889
know solve for optimal trajectories to
get from A to B so this is happening in

1716
00:32:48,889 --> 00:32:48,899
get from A to B so this is happening in
 

1717
00:32:48,899 --> 00:32:50,990
get from A to B so this is happening in
a much more natural way and we're really

1718
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:51,000
a much more natural way and we're really
 

1719
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,510
a much more natural way and we're really
seeing an acceleration happen in the

1720
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:53,520
seeing an acceleration happen in the
 

1721
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,669
seeing an acceleration happen in the
development of these behaviors again

1722
00:32:55,669 --> 00:32:55,679
development of these behaviors again
 

1723
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,029
development of these behaviors again
partly due to these

1724
00:32:58,029 --> 00:32:58,039
partly due to these
 

1725
00:32:58,039 --> 00:33:00,769
partly due to these
optimization techniques uh sometimes

1726
00:33:00,769 --> 00:33:00,779
optimization techniques uh sometimes
 

1727
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:03,010
optimization techniques uh sometimes
learning techniques

1728
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:03,020
learning techniques
 

1729
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:06,470
learning techniques
so it's there's it's hard in that

1730
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:06,480
so it's there's it's hard in that
 

1731
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,649
so it's there's it's hard in that
there's a lot of mathematics in behind

1732
00:33:09,649 --> 00:33:09,659
there's a lot of mathematics in behind
 

1733
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:12,710
there's a lot of mathematics in behind
it but we're figuring that out so you

1734
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:12,720
it but we're figuring that out so you
 

1735
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,529
it but we're figuring that out so you
can do model predictive control for

1736
00:33:15,529 --> 00:33:15,539
can do model predictive control for
 

1737
00:33:15,539 --> 00:33:17,750
can do model predictive control for
uh I mean I don't even understand what

1738
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:17,760
uh I mean I don't even understand what
 

1739
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,789
uh I mean I don't even understand what
that looks like when the entire robot is

1740
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:19,799
that looks like when the entire robot is
 

1741
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:23,210
that looks like when the entire robot is
in the air flying and doing a back yeah

1742
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:23,220
in the air flying and doing a back yeah
 

1743
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:26,029
in the air flying and doing a back yeah
I mean but but that's the cool part

1744
00:33:26,029 --> 00:33:26,039
I mean but but that's the cool part
 

1745
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:27,710
I mean but but that's the cool part
right so you know yeah you know the

1746
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:27,720
right so you know yeah you know the
 

1747
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,630
right so you know yeah you know the
physics we we can calculate physics

1748
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:29,640
physics we we can calculate physics
 

1749
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,610
physics we we can calculate physics
pretty well using you know Newton's laws

1750
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:31,620
pretty well using you know Newton's laws
 

1751
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:34,190
pretty well using you know Newton's laws
about how it's going to evolve over time

1752
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:34,200
about how it's going to evolve over time
 

1753
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,590
about how it's going to evolve over time
and the road you know this this the sick

1754
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:36,600
and the road you know this this the sick
 

1755
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,930
and the road you know this this the sick
trick which was a front somersault with

1756
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:38,940
trick which was a front somersault with
 

1757
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:42,470
trick which was a front somersault with
a half twist is a good example right

1758
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:42,480
a half twist is a good example right
 

1759
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,769
a half twist is a good example right
you saw the robot on various versions of

1760
00:33:45,769 --> 00:33:45,779
you saw the robot on various versions of
 

1761
00:33:45,779 --> 00:33:48,230
you saw the robot on various versions of
that trick I've seen it land in

1762
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:48,240
that trick I've seen it land in
 

1763
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,269
that trick I've seen it land in
different configurations and it still

1764
00:33:50,269 --> 00:33:50,279
different configurations and it still
 

1765
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:53,690
different configurations and it still
manages to stabilize itself and so you

1766
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:53,700
manages to stabilize itself and so you
 

1767
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,009
manages to stabilize itself and so you
know what this model predictive control

1768
00:33:55,009 --> 00:33:55,019
know what this model predictive control
 

1769
00:33:55,019 --> 00:33:58,549
know what this model predictive control
means is again the in real time the

1770
00:33:58,549 --> 00:33:58,559
means is again the in real time the
 

1771
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:01,549
means is again the in real time the
robot is projecting ahead you know a

1772
00:34:01,549 --> 00:34:01,559
robot is projecting ahead you know a
 

1773
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:03,590
robot is projecting ahead you know a
second into the future and sort of

1774
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:03,600
second into the future and sort of
 

1775
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,930
second into the future and sort of
exploring options and if I if I move my

1776
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:05,940
exploring options and if I if I move my
 

1777
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,370
exploring options and if I if I move my
arm a little bit more this way how is

1778
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:07,380
arm a little bit more this way how is
 

1779
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,990
arm a little bit more this way how is
that going to affect the outcome and so

1780
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:09,000
that going to affect the outcome and so
 

1781
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,030
that going to affect the outcome and so
it can do these calculations many of

1782
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:11,040
it can do these calculations many of
 

1783
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,210
it can do these calculations many of
them you know uh and and basically solve

1784
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:14,220
them you know uh and and basically solve
 

1785
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:16,849
them you know uh and and basically solve
for you know given where I am now maybe

1786
00:34:16,849 --> 00:34:16,859
for you know given where I am now maybe
 

1787
00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:19,190
for you know given where I am now maybe
I took off a little bit screwy from how

1788
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:19,200
I took off a little bit screwy from how
 

1789
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,589
I took off a little bit screwy from how
I had planned I can adjust so you're

1790
00:34:21,589 --> 00:34:21,599
I had planned I can adjust so you're
 

1791
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,409
I had planned I can adjust so you're
adjusting in there just on the fly so

1792
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:24,419
adjusting in there just on the fly so
 

1793
00:34:24,419 --> 00:34:26,030
adjusting in there just on the fly so
the the model predictive control lets

1794
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:26,040
the the model predictive control lets
 

1795
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,649
the the model predictive control lets
you adjust on the Fly

1796
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:27,659
you adjust on the Fly
 

1797
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:29,510
you adjust on the Fly
and of course I think this is what you

1798
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:29,520
and of course I think this is what you
 

1799
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,389
and of course I think this is what you
know people adapt as well we when when

1800
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:32,399
know people adapt as well we when when
 

1801
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,030
know people adapt as well we when when
we do it even a gymnastics trick we try

1802
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:35,040
we do it even a gymnastics trick we try
 

1803
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,010
we do it even a gymnastics trick we try
to set it up so it's as close to the

1804
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:37,020
to set it up so it's as close to the
 

1805
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,050
to set it up so it's as close to the
same every time but we figured out how

1806
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:39,060
same every time but we figured out how
 

1807
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,030
same every time but we figured out how
to do some adjustment on the Fly and now

1808
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:41,040
to do some adjustment on the Fly and now
 

1809
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,230
to do some adjustment on the Fly and now
we're starting to figure out that the

1810
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:42,240
we're starting to figure out that the
 

1811
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,030
we're starting to figure out that the
robots can do this adjustment on the fly

1812
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:44,040
robots can do this adjustment on the fly
 

1813
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,790
robots can do this adjustment on the fly
as well using these techniques in the

1814
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:46,800
as well using these techniques in the
 

1815
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,810
as well using these techniques in the
air

1816
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:47,820
air
 

1817
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:50,990
air
and so I mean it just feels from a

1818
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:51,000
and so I mean it just feels from a
 

1819
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,270
and so I mean it just feels from a
robotics perspective just surreal well

1820
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:53,280
robotics perspective just surreal well
 

1821
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,530
robotics perspective just surreal well
that's sort of the you talked about

1822
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:54,540
that's sort of the you talked about
 

1823
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:57,170
that's sort of the you talked about
under actuated right so when you're when

1824
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:57,180
under actuated right so when you're when
 

1825
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,910
under actuated right so when you're when
you're in the air there's something

1826
00:34:58,910 --> 00:34:58,920
you're in the air there's something
 

1827
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,410
you're in the air there's something
there's some things you can't change

1828
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:00,420
there's some things you can't change
 

1829
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,030
there's some things you can't change
right you can't change the momentum

1830
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:02,040
right you can't change the momentum
 

1831
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,650
right you can't change the momentum
while it's in the air because you can't

1832
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:03,660
while it's in the air because you can't
 

1833
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,930
while it's in the air because you can't
apply an external force or Torque and so

1834
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:05,940
apply an external force or Torque and so
 

1835
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,970
apply an external force or Torque and so
the momentum isn't going to change so

1836
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:07,980
the momentum isn't going to change so
 

1837
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,710
the momentum isn't going to change so
how do you work within the constraint of

1838
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:09,720
how do you work within the constraint of
 

1839
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,109
how do you work within the constraint of
that fixed momentum to still get from A

1840
00:35:12,109 --> 00:35:12,119
that fixed momentum to still get from A
 

1841
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:14,990
that fixed momentum to still get from A
to B where you want to be that's really

1842
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:15,000
to B where you want to be that's really
 

1843
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,230
to B where you want to be that's really
unfortunate

1844
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:17,240
unfortunate
 

1845
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,329
unfortunate
you're in the air I mean you become a

1846
00:35:20,329 --> 00:35:20,339
you're in the air I mean you become a
 

1847
00:35:20,339 --> 00:35:22,010
you're in the air I mean you become a
drone for a brief moment of time no

1848
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:22,020
drone for a brief moment of time no
 

1849
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,210
drone for a brief moment of time no
you're not even a drone because you

1850
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:23,220
you're not even a drone because you
 

1851
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,730
you're not even a drone because you
can't can't ever you can't hover you're

1852
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:25,740
can't can't ever you can't hover you're
 

1853
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:28,190
can't can't ever you can't hover you're
gonna you're gonna impact soon be ready

1854
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:28,200
gonna you're gonna impact soon be ready
 

1855
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,470
gonna you're gonna impact soon be ready
yeah are you considered like a hover

1856
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:30,480
yeah are you considered like a hover
 

1857
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,190
yeah are you considered like a hover
type thing or no no it's too much weight

1858
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:33,200
type thing or no no it's too much weight
 

1859
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,010
type thing or no no it's too much weight
I mean it's just it's just incredible uh

1860
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:37,020
I mean it's just it's just incredible uh
 

1861
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,930
I mean it's just it's just incredible uh
and just even to have the guts to try

1862
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:38,940
and just even to have the guts to try
 

1863
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:42,050
and just even to have the guts to try
backflip with such a large body

1864
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:42,060
backflip with such a large body
 

1865
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:45,290
backflip with such a large body
that's wild but like uh we definitely

1866
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:45,300
that's wild but like uh we definitely
 

1867
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,810
that's wild but like uh we definitely
broke a few robots trying but that but

1868
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:47,820
broke a few robots trying but that but
 

1869
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,069
broke a few robots trying but that but
that's where the build it break it fix

1870
00:35:49,069 --> 00:35:49,079
that's where the build it break it fix
 

1871
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:51,829
that's where the build it break it fix
it you know uh strategy comes in you

1872
00:35:51,829 --> 00:35:51,839
it you know uh strategy comes in you
 

1873
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,750
it you know uh strategy comes in you
gotta be willing to break and what ends

1874
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:53,760
gotta be willing to break and what ends
 

1875
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,849
gotta be willing to break and what ends
up happening is you end up by breaking

1876
00:35:55,849 --> 00:35:55,859
up happening is you end up by breaking
 

1877
00:35:55,859 --> 00:35:57,589
up happening is you end up by breaking
the robot repeatedly you find the weak

1878
00:35:57,589 --> 00:35:57,599
the robot repeatedly you find the weak
 

1879
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,450
the robot repeatedly you find the weak
points and then you end up redesigning

1880
00:35:59,450 --> 00:35:59,460
points and then you end up redesigning
 

1881
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,950
points and then you end up redesigning
it so it doesn't break so easily next

1882
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:00,960
it so it doesn't break so easily next
 

1883
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,930
it so it doesn't break so easily next
time you know through the breaking

1884
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:02,940
time you know through the breaking
 

1885
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:05,870
time you know through the breaking
process you learn a lot like a lot of

1886
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:05,880
process you learn a lot like a lot of
 

1887
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,970
process you learn a lot like a lot of
lessons and you keep improving not just

1888
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:07,980
lessons and you keep improving not just
 

1889
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,829
lessons and you keep improving not just
how to make the backflip work but

1890
00:36:09,829 --> 00:36:09,839
how to make the backflip work but
 

1891
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:11,270
how to make the backflip work but
everything and how to build the machine

1892
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:11,280
everything and how to build the machine
 

1893
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,069
everything and how to build the machine
better yeah yeah

1894
00:36:13,069 --> 00:36:13,079
better yeah yeah
 

1895
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:15,410
better yeah yeah
I mean is there something about just the

1896
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:15,420
I mean is there something about just the
 

1897
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,670
I mean is there something about just the
guts that

1898
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:16,680
guts that
 

1899
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,670
guts that
come up with an idea of saying you know

1900
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:19,680
come up with an idea of saying you know
 

1901
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,650
come up with an idea of saying you know
what let's try to make it do a backflip

1902
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:21,660
what let's try to make it do a backflip
 

1903
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,690
what let's try to make it do a backflip
well I think the courage to do a

1904
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:23,700
well I think the courage to do a
 

1905
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,970
well I think the courage to do a
backflip in the first place and and to

1906
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:25,980
backflip in the first place and and to
 

1907
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,890
backflip in the first place and and to
not worry too much about the ridicule of

1908
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:27,900
not worry too much about the ridicule of
 

1909
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,569
not worry too much about the ridicule of
somebody saying why the heck are you

1910
00:36:29,569 --> 00:36:29,579
somebody saying why the heck are you
 

1911
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:32,030
somebody saying why the heck are you
doing backflips with robots because a

1912
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:32,040
doing backflips with robots because a
 

1913
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,410
doing backflips with robots because a
lot of people have asked that you know

1914
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:33,420
lot of people have asked that you know
 

1915
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:36,290
lot of people have asked that you know
why why why are you doing this why go to

1916
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:36,300
why why why are you doing this why go to
 

1917
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:39,170
why why why are you doing this why go to
the moon in this decade and do the other

1918
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:39,180
the moon in this decade and do the other
 

1919
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,060
the moon in this decade and do the other
things JFK

1920
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:40,070
things JFK
 

1921
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,630
things JFK
[Laughter]

1922
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:41,640
[Laughter]
 

1923
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,250
[Laughter]
it's not because it's easy because it's

1924
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:43,260
it's not because it's easy because it's
 

1925
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:46,790
it's not because it's easy because it's
hard yeah exactly

1926
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:46,800

 

1927
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,490

don't ask questions okay so the uh the

1928
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:49,500
don't ask questions okay so the uh the
 

1929
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,870
don't ask questions okay so the uh the
jumping I mean it's just there's a lot

1930
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:50,880
jumping I mean it's just there's a lot
 

1931
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,069
jumping I mean it's just there's a lot
of incredible stuff if we can just

1932
00:36:52,069 --> 00:36:52,079
of incredible stuff if we can just
 

1933
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,130
of incredible stuff if we can just
rewind a little bit to uh the DARPA

1934
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:55,140
rewind a little bit to uh the DARPA
 

1935
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:58,490
rewind a little bit to uh the DARPA
robotics challenge in 2015 I think which

1936
00:36:58,490 --> 00:36:58,500
robotics challenge in 2015 I think which
 

1937
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,650
robotics challenge in 2015 I think which
was for people who are familiar with the

1938
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:00,660
was for people who are familiar with the
 

1939
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,210
was for people who are familiar with the
DARPA challenges

1940
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:02,220
DARPA challenges
 

1941
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,750
DARPA challenges
it uh was first with autonomous vehicles

1942
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:05,760
it uh was first with autonomous vehicles
 

1943
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,890
it uh was first with autonomous vehicles
and there's a lot of interesting

1944
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:06,900
and there's a lot of interesting
 

1945
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,750
and there's a lot of interesting
challenges around that and the DARPA

1946
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:08,760
challenges around that and the DARPA
 

1947
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,270
challenges around that and the DARPA
robotics challenge is when uh humanoid

1948
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:11,280
robotics challenge is when uh humanoid
 

1949
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:17,030
robotics challenge is when uh humanoid
robots were tasked to do all kinds of

1950
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:17,040
robots were tasked to do all kinds of
 

1951
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,230
robots were tasked to do all kinds of
uh you know manipulation walking driving

1952
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:21,240
uh you know manipulation walking driving
 

1953
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,770
uh you know manipulation walking driving
your car all these kinds of challenges

1954
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:23,780
your car all these kinds of challenges
 

1955
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:27,069
your car all these kinds of challenges
with if I remember correctly sort of

1956
00:37:27,069 --> 00:37:27,079
with if I remember correctly sort of
 

1957
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:30,530
with if I remember correctly sort of
some slight capability to communicate

1958
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:30,540
some slight capability to communicate
 

1959
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:33,710
some slight capability to communicate
with humans but the communication was

1960
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:33,720
with humans but the communication was
 

1961
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,450
with humans but the communication was
very poor so it basically has to be

1962
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:35,460
very poor so it basically has to be
 

1963
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:38,089
very poor so it basically has to be
almost entirely autonomous you can have

1964
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:38,099
almost entirely autonomous you can have
 

1965
00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:39,650
almost entirely autonomous you can have
periods where the communication was

1966
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:39,660
periods where the communication was
 

1967
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,329
periods where the communication was
entirely interrupted and the robot had

1968
00:37:41,329 --> 00:37:41,339
entirely interrupted and the robot had
 

1969
00:37:41,339 --> 00:37:43,190
entirely interrupted and the robot had
to be able to proceed yeah but you could

1970
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:43,200
to be able to proceed yeah but you could
 

1971
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,870
to be able to proceed yeah but you could
provide some high level guidance to the

1972
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:44,880
provide some high level guidance to the
 

1973
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,329
provide some high level guidance to the
robot basically load low bandwidth

1974
00:37:47,329 --> 00:37:47,339
robot basically load low bandwidth
 

1975
00:37:47,339 --> 00:37:50,510
robot basically load low bandwidth
Communications to steer it I watched

1976
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:50,520
Communications to steer it I watched
 

1977
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,849
Communications to steer it I watched
that challenge with kind of tears in my

1978
00:37:52,849 --> 00:37:52,859
that challenge with kind of tears in my
 

1979
00:37:52,859 --> 00:37:56,530
that challenge with kind of tears in my
eyes eating popcorn

1980
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:56,540

 

1981
00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:00,290

but I wasn't personally losing uh you

1982
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:00,300
but I wasn't personally losing uh you
 

1983
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,910
but I wasn't personally losing uh you
know hundreds of thousands millions of

1984
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:01,920
know hundreds of thousands millions of
 

1985
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,970
know hundreds of thousands millions of
dollars and many years of incredible

1986
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:04,980
dollars and many years of incredible
 

1987
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,250
dollars and many years of incredible
hard work by some of the most brilliant

1988
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:07,260
hard work by some of the most brilliant
 

1989
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,410
hard work by some of the most brilliant
roboticists in the world so that was why

1990
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:09,420
roboticists in the world so that was why
 

1991
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,569
roboticists in the world so that was why
the tragic that's why tears came so

1992
00:38:11,569 --> 00:38:11,579
the tragic that's why tears came so
 

1993
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:14,030
the tragic that's why tears came so
anyway what what have you uh just

1994
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:14,040
anyway what what have you uh just
 

1995
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,829
anyway what what have you uh just
looking back to that time what have you

1996
00:38:15,829 --> 00:38:15,839
looking back to that time what have you
 

1997
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:17,930
looking back to that time what have you
learned from that experience

1998
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:17,940
learned from that experience
 

1999
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,730
learned from that experience
I mean maybe if you could describe what

2000
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:19,740
I mean maybe if you could describe what
 

2001
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:22,250
I mean maybe if you could describe what
it was uh sort of the setup for people

2002
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:22,260
it was uh sort of the setup for people
 

2003
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,290
it was uh sort of the setup for people
who haven't seen it well so there was a

2004
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:24,300
who haven't seen it well so there was a
 

2005
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,990
who haven't seen it well so there was a
contest where a bunch of different

2006
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:27,000
contest where a bunch of different
 

2007
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,450
contest where a bunch of different
um robots were asked to do a series of

2008
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:29,460
um robots were asked to do a series of
 

2009
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,430
um robots were asked to do a series of
tasks uh some of those that you

2010
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:31,440
tasks uh some of those that you
 

2011
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,829
tasks uh some of those that you
mentioned drive a vehicle get out open a

2012
00:38:33,829 --> 00:38:33,839
mentioned drive a vehicle get out open a
 

2013
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:37,190
mentioned drive a vehicle get out open a
door go identify a vowel shutter valve

2014
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:37,200
door go identify a vowel shutter valve
 

2015
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,089
door go identify a vowel shutter valve
use a tool to maybe cut a hole in

2016
00:38:41,089 --> 00:38:41,099
use a tool to maybe cut a hole in
 

2017
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:41,690
use a tool to maybe cut a hole in
um

2018
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:41,700
um
 

2019
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:45,170
um
a surface and then crawl over some

2020
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:45,180
a surface and then crawl over some
 

2021
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:47,750
a surface and then crawl over some
stairs and maybe some rough Terrain

2022
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:47,760
stairs and maybe some rough Terrain
 

2023
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,670
stairs and maybe some rough Terrain
so it was

2024
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:49,680
so it was
 

2025
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,550
so it was
the idea was have a general purpose

2026
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:52,560
the idea was have a general purpose
 

2027
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,109
the idea was have a general purpose
robot that could do lots of different

2028
00:38:54,109 --> 00:38:54,119
robot that could do lots of different
 

2029
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:56,329
robot that could do lots of different
things

2030
00:38:56,329 --> 00:38:56,339
things
 

2031
00:38:56,339 --> 00:38:58,370
things
um it had to be mobility and

2032
00:38:58,370 --> 00:38:58,380
um it had to be mobility and
 

2033
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:01,609
um it had to be mobility and
manipulation on board perception

2034
00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:01,619
manipulation on board perception
 

2035
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:04,609
manipulation on board perception
and there was a contest which DARPA

2036
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:04,619
and there was a contest which DARPA
 

2037
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:07,609
and there was a contest which DARPA
likes at the time was running sort of

2038
00:39:07,609 --> 00:39:07,619
likes at the time was running sort of
 

2039
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:09,170
likes at the time was running sort of
follow on to the

2040
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:09,180
follow on to the
 

2041
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,510
follow on to the
the Grand Challenge which was let's

2042
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:11,520
the Grand Challenge which was let's
 

2043
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,089
the Grand Challenge which was let's
let's try to push vehicle autonomy along

2044
00:39:14,089 --> 00:39:14,099
let's try to push vehicle autonomy along
 

2045
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:16,490
let's try to push vehicle autonomy along
right they they encourage people to

2046
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:16,500
right they they encourage people to
 

2047
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,770
right they they encourage people to
build autonomous cars so they're trying

2048
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:18,780
build autonomous cars so they're trying
 

2049
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,630
build autonomous cars so they're trying
to basically push an industry forward

2050
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:20,640
to basically push an industry forward
 

2051
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,609
to basically push an industry forward
and

2052
00:39:22,609 --> 00:39:22,619
and
 

2053
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:23,210
and
um

2054
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:23,220
um
 

2055
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:26,810
um
uh we were asked our role in this was to

2056
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:26,820
uh we were asked our role in this was to
 

2057
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:27,530
uh we were asked our role in this was to
build

2058
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:27,540
build
 

2059
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,329
build
um a humanoid at the time it was our

2060
00:39:29,329 --> 00:39:29,339
um a humanoid at the time it was our
 

2061
00:39:29,339 --> 00:39:32,930
um a humanoid at the time it was our
sort of first generation Atlas robot

2062
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:32,940
sort of first generation Atlas robot
 

2063
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:37,490
sort of first generation Atlas robot
and we built maybe 10 of them I don't

2064
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:37,500
and we built maybe 10 of them I don't
 

2065
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,130
and we built maybe 10 of them I don't
remember the exact number

2066
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:39,140
remember the exact number
 

2067
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:42,890
remember the exact number
and DARPA distributed those to various

2068
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:42,900
and DARPA distributed those to various
 

2069
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,569
and DARPA distributed those to various
teams

2070
00:39:44,569 --> 00:39:44,579
teams
 

2071
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:47,750
teams
um that sort of won a contest showed

2072
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:47,760
um that sort of won a contest showed
 

2073
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,390
um that sort of won a contest showed
that they could you know program these

2074
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:50,400
that they could you know program these
 

2075
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,430
that they could you know program these
robots and then use them to compete

2076
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:52,440
robots and then use them to compete
 

2077
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,050
robots and then use them to compete
against each other and then other robots

2078
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:54,060
against each other and then other robots
 

2079
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,089
against each other and then other robots
were introduced as well some teams built

2080
00:39:56,089 --> 00:39:56,099
were introduced as well some teams built
 

2081
00:39:56,099 --> 00:39:57,829
were introduced as well some teams built
their own robots Carnegie

2082
00:39:57,829 --> 00:39:57,839
their own robots Carnegie
 

2083
00:39:57,839 --> 00:39:59,569
their own robots Carnegie
um melon for example built their own

2084
00:39:59,569 --> 00:39:59,579
um melon for example built their own
 

2085
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:02,690
um melon for example built their own
robot and uh and all these robots

2086
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:02,700
robot and uh and all these robots
 

2087
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,310
robot and uh and all these robots
competed to see who could sort of get

2088
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:04,320
competed to see who could sort of get
 

2089
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,450
competed to see who could sort of get
through this this maze or the fastest

2090
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:07,460
through this this maze or the fastest
 

2091
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:10,190
through this this maze or the fastest
and again I think the purpose was to

2092
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:10,200
and again I think the purpose was to
 

2093
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,890
and again I think the purpose was to
kind of push the whole industry forward

2094
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:12,900
kind of push the whole industry forward
 

2095
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,650
kind of push the whole industry forward
we provided the robot and some baseline

2096
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:15,660
we provided the robot and some baseline
 

2097
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,630
we provided the robot and some baseline
software but we didn't we didn't

2098
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:17,640
software but we didn't we didn't
 

2099
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,630
software but we didn't we didn't
actually compete as a participant uh

2100
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:20,640
actually compete as a participant uh
 

2101
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,750
actually compete as a participant uh
where we were trying to uh you know

2102
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:23,760
where we were trying to uh you know
 

2103
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,970
where we were trying to uh you know
Drive the robot through this maze we

2104
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:25,980
Drive the robot through this maze we
 

2105
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,230
Drive the robot through this maze we
were just trying to support the other

2106
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:27,240
were just trying to support the other
 

2107
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,430
were just trying to support the other
teams

2108
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:28,440
teams
 

2109
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,770
teams
it was humbling because it was it was

2110
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:30,780
it was humbling because it was it was
 

2111
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:33,349
it was humbling because it was it was
really a hard task and honestly the

2112
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:33,359
really a hard task and honestly the
 

2113
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,569
really a hard task and honestly the
robots the tears were because mostly the

2114
00:40:35,569 --> 00:40:35,579
robots the tears were because mostly the
 

2115
00:40:35,579 --> 00:40:37,250
robots the tears were because mostly the
robots didn't do it you know they fell

2116
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:37,260
robots didn't do it you know they fell
 

2117
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,150
robots didn't do it you know they fell
down

2118
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:38,160
down
 

2119
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,210
down
you know repeatedly

2120
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:41,220
you know repeatedly
 

2121
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,770
you know repeatedly
um it was hard to get through this

2122
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:42,780
um it was hard to get through this
 

2123
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:46,010
um it was hard to get through this
contest uh some did and and you know

2124
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:46,020
contest uh some did and and you know
 

2125
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,990
contest uh some did and and you know
they were rewarded and won

2126
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:48,000
they were rewarded and won
 

2127
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,270
they were rewarded and won
but it was humbling because of just how

2128
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:50,280
but it was humbling because of just how
 

2129
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,010
but it was humbling because of just how
hard these tasks weren't all that hard a

2130
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:52,020
hard these tasks weren't all that hard a
 

2131
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,349
hard these tasks weren't all that hard a
person could have done it very easily

2132
00:40:53,349 --> 00:40:53,359
person could have done it very easily
 

2133
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:56,089
person could have done it very easily
but it was really hard to get the robots

2134
00:40:56,089 --> 00:40:56,099
but it was really hard to get the robots
 

2135
00:40:56,099 --> 00:40:58,970
but it was really hard to get the robots
to do it you know the general nature of

2136
00:40:58,970 --> 00:40:58,980
to do it you know the general nature of
 

2137
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:01,670
to do it you know the general nature of
it the variety of it the variety and

2138
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:01,680
it the variety of it the variety and
 

2139
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:06,170
it the variety of it the variety and
also that I don't know if the tasks were

2140
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:06,180

 

2141
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:09,770

sort of the task in themselves help us

2142
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:09,780
sort of the task in themselves help us
 

2143
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:11,510
sort of the task in themselves help us
understand what is difficult and what is

2144
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:11,520
understand what is difficult and what is
 

2145
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,190
understand what is difficult and what is
not I don't know if that was obvious

2146
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:13,200
not I don't know if that was obvious
 

2147
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,069
not I don't know if that was obvious
before the contest was designed so you

2148
00:41:16,069 --> 00:41:16,079
before the contest was designed so you
 

2149
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:18,230
before the contest was designed so you
kind of tried to figure that out and I

2150
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:18,240
kind of tried to figure that out and I
 

2151
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,410
kind of tried to figure that out and I
think Atlas is really a general robot

2152
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:21,420
think Atlas is really a general robot
 

2153
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:24,410
think Atlas is really a general robot
platform and it's perhaps not best

2154
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:24,420
platform and it's perhaps not best
 

2155
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,870
platform and it's perhaps not best
suited for the specific tasks of that

2156
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:26,880
suited for the specific tasks of that
 

2157
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,510
suited for the specific tasks of that
contest like for just for example

2158
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:29,520
contest like for just for example
 

2159
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,030
contest like for just for example
probably the hardest task is not the

2160
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:32,040
probably the hardest task is not the
 

2161
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,310
probably the hardest task is not the
driving of the car but getting in and

2162
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:34,320
driving of the car but getting in and
 

2163
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:38,150
driving of the car but getting in and
out of the car and Atlas probably you

2164
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:38,160
out of the car and Atlas probably you
 

2165
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,710
out of the car and Atlas probably you
know if you were to design a robot that

2166
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:39,720
know if you were to design a robot that
 

2167
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,109
know if you were to design a robot that
can get into the car easily and get out

2168
00:41:42,109 --> 00:41:42,119
can get into the car easily and get out
 

2169
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:44,089
can get into the car easily and get out
easily you probably would not make Atlas

2170
00:41:44,089 --> 00:41:44,099
easily you probably would not make Atlas
 

2171
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:46,849
easily you probably would not make Atlas
that particular car yeah the robot was a

2172
00:41:46,849 --> 00:41:46,859
that particular car yeah the robot was a
 

2173
00:41:46,859 --> 00:41:48,650
that particular car yeah the robot was a
little bit big to get in and out of that

2174
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:48,660
little bit big to get in and out of that
 

2175
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:51,109
little bit big to get in and out of that
car right it doesn't fit yeah this is

2176
00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:51,119
car right it doesn't fit yeah this is
 

2177
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:52,970
car right it doesn't fit yeah this is
the curse of a general purpose robot

2178
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:52,980
the curse of a general purpose robot
 

2179
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,890
the curse of a general purpose robot
that they're not perfect at any one

2180
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:54,900
that they're not perfect at any one
 

2181
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:55,730
that they're not perfect at any one
thing

2182
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:55,740
thing
 

2183
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,829
thing
but they might be able to do a wide

2184
00:41:57,829 --> 00:41:57,839
but they might be able to do a wide
 

2185
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:02,510
but they might be able to do a wide
variety of things and and that is

2186
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:02,520
variety of things and and that is
 

2187
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,730
variety of things and and that is
that is the goal at the end of the day

2188
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:04,740
that is the goal at the end of the day
 

2189
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,230
that is the goal at the end of the day
you know I think we all want to build

2190
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:06,240
you know I think we all want to build
 

2191
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,870
you know I think we all want to build
general purpose robots that can be used

2192
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:08,880
general purpose robots that can be used
 

2193
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,030
general purpose robots that can be used
for lots of different activities

2194
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:11,040
for lots of different activities
 

2195
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,370
for lots of different activities
but it's hard and

2196
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:13,380
but it's hard and
 

2197
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:16,490
but it's hard and
um and the wisdom in in building

2198
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:16,500
um and the wisdom in in building
 

2199
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,069
um and the wisdom in in building
successful robots up until this point

2200
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:19,079
successful robots up until this point
 

2201
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:21,890
successful robots up until this point
have been go build a robot for a

2202
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:21,900
have been go build a robot for a
 

2203
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,690
have been go build a robot for a
specific task and it'll do it very well

2204
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:23,700
specific task and it'll do it very well
 

2205
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,730
specific task and it'll do it very well
and as long as you control that

2206
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:25,740
and as long as you control that
 

2207
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:28,370
and as long as you control that
environment it'll operate perfectly but

2208
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:28,380
environment it'll operate perfectly but
 

2209
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,770
environment it'll operate perfectly but
but robots need to be able to deal with

2210
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:30,780
but robots need to be able to deal with
 

2211
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:31,910
but robots need to be able to deal with
uncertainty if they're going to be

2212
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:31,920
uncertainty if they're going to be
 

2213
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,250
uncertainty if they're going to be
useful to us in the future

2214
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:34,260
useful to us in the future
 

2215
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,870
useful to us in the future
they need to be able to deal with

2216
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:35,880
they need to be able to deal with
 

2217
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:39,470
they need to be able to deal with
unexpected uh situations and that's sort

2218
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:39,480
unexpected uh situations and that's sort
 

2219
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,030
unexpected uh situations and that's sort
of the goal of a general purpose or

2220
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:41,040
of the goal of a general purpose or
 

2221
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,710
of the goal of a general purpose or
multi-purpose robot

2222
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:42,720
multi-purpose robot
 

2223
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,109
multi-purpose robot
and that's just darn hard and so some of

2224
00:42:45,109 --> 00:42:45,119
and that's just darn hard and so some of
 

2225
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,250
and that's just darn hard and so some of
you know there's these curious little

2226
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:46,260
you know there's these curious little
 

2227
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:49,010
you know there's these curious little
failures like I remember one of the a

2228
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:49,020
failures like I remember one of the a
 

2229
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:52,430
failures like I remember one of the a
robot you know the first the first time

2230
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:52,440
robot you know the first the first time
 

2231
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,050
robot you know the first the first time
you start to try to push on the world

2232
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:54,060
you start to try to push on the world
 

2233
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:57,230
you start to try to push on the world
with a robot you you forget that the

2234
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:57,240
with a robot you you forget that the
 

2235
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,870
with a robot you you forget that the
world pushes back and and will push you

2236
00:42:59,870 --> 00:42:59,880
world pushes back and and will push you
 

2237
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,510
world pushes back and and will push you
over if you're not ready for it and the

2238
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:02,520
over if you're not ready for it and the
 

2239
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,910
over if you're not ready for it and the
robot you know reached to grab the door

2240
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:04,920
robot you know reached to grab the door
 

2241
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,950
robot you know reached to grab the door
handle I think it missed the grasp of

2242
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:06,960
handle I think it missed the grasp of
 

2243
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,530
handle I think it missed the grasp of
the door handle was expecting that its

2244
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:09,540
the door handle was expecting that its
 

2245
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:11,390
the door handle was expecting that its
hand was on the door handle and so when

2246
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:11,400
hand was on the door handle and so when
 

2247
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,490
hand was on the door handle and so when
it tried to turn the knob it just threw

2248
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:13,500
it tried to turn the knob it just threw
 

2249
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,650
it tried to turn the knob it just threw
itself over it didn't realize oh I had

2250
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:15,660
itself over it didn't realize oh I had
 

2251
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:18,290
itself over it didn't realize oh I had
missed the door handle I didn't have I

2252
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:18,300
missed the door handle I didn't have I
 

2253
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,210
missed the door handle I didn't have I
didn't I was expecting a force back from

2254
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:20,220
didn't I was expecting a force back from
 

2255
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:22,490
didn't I was expecting a force back from
the door it wasn't there and then I lost

2256
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:22,500
the door it wasn't there and then I lost
 

2257
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,370
the door it wasn't there and then I lost
my balance so these little simple things

2258
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:25,380
my balance so these little simple things
 

2259
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:27,290
my balance so these little simple things
that you and I would take totally for

2260
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:27,300
that you and I would take totally for
 

2261
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:30,290
that you and I would take totally for
granted and deal with the robots don't

2262
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:30,300
granted and deal with the robots don't
 

2263
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:31,910
granted and deal with the robots don't
know how to deal with yet and so you

2264
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:31,920
know how to deal with yet and so you
 

2265
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,530
know how to deal with yet and so you
have to start to deal with all of those

2266
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:33,540
have to start to deal with all of those
 

2267
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:36,650
have to start to deal with all of those
uh circumstances well I think a lot of

2268
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:36,660
uh circumstances well I think a lot of
 

2269
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:40,790
uh circumstances well I think a lot of
us experience this in uh even when sober

2270
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:40,800
us experience this in uh even when sober
 

2271
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,030
us experience this in uh even when sober
but drunk too uh sort of you pick up a

2272
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:44,040
but drunk too uh sort of you pick up a
 

2273
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,829
but drunk too uh sort of you pick up a
thing and expect it to be

2274
00:43:45,829 --> 00:43:45,839
thing and expect it to be
 

2275
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:48,530
thing and expect it to be
what is it heavy and it turns out to be

2276
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:48,540
what is it heavy and it turns out to be
 

2277
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:51,770
what is it heavy and it turns out to be
light yeah oh yeah and then so the same

2278
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:51,780
light yeah oh yeah and then so the same
 

2279
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:53,690
light yeah oh yeah and then so the same
and I'm sure if your depth perception

2280
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:53,700
and I'm sure if your depth perception
 

2281
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,910
and I'm sure if your depth perception
for whatever reason is screwed up if

2282
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:55,920
for whatever reason is screwed up if
 

2283
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,410
for whatever reason is screwed up if
you're if you're drunk or some other

2284
00:43:57,410 --> 00:43:57,420
you're if you're drunk or some other
 

2285
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:59,690
you're if you're drunk or some other
reason and then you think you're putting

2286
00:43:59,690 --> 00:43:59,700
reason and then you think you're putting
 

2287
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:02,270
reason and then you think you're putting
your hand on the table and you miss it I

2288
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:02,280
your hand on the table and you miss it I
 

2289
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,530
your hand on the table and you miss it I
mean it's the same kind of situation

2290
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:03,540
mean it's the same kind of situation
 

2291
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,510
mean it's the same kind of situation
yeah but

2292
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:05,520
yeah but
 

2293
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,250
yeah but
there's why you need to be able to

2294
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:07,260
there's why you need to be able to
 

2295
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:09,410
there's why you need to be able to
predict forward just a little bit and so

2296
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:09,420
predict forward just a little bit and so
 

2297
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:10,670
predict forward just a little bit and so
that's where this model predictive

2298
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:10,680
that's where this model predictive
 

2299
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,470
that's where this model predictive
control stuff comes in predict forward

2300
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:12,480
control stuff comes in predict forward
 

2301
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,390
control stuff comes in predict forward
what you think is going to happen

2302
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:14,400
what you think is going to happen
 

2303
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,890
what you think is going to happen
and then if and if that does happen

2304
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:15,900
and then if and if that does happen
 

2305
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,390
and then if and if that does happen
you're in good shape if something else

2306
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:17,400
you're in good shape if something else
 

2307
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,770
you're in good shape if something else
happens you better start predicting

2308
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:18,780
happens you better start predicting
 

2309
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:22,490
happens you better start predicting
again so if we like we re-uh regenerate

2310
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:22,500
again so if we like we re-uh regenerate
 

2311
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:26,030
again so if we like we re-uh regenerate
a plan yeah when you don't I mean that

2312
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:26,040
a plan yeah when you don't I mean that
 

2313
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:29,470
a plan yeah when you don't I mean that
um that also requires a very uh fast

2314
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:29,480
um that also requires a very uh fast
 

2315
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:32,390
um that also requires a very uh fast
feedback loop of updating

2316
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:32,400
feedback loop of updating
 

2317
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,790
feedback loop of updating
what your prediction how it matches to

2318
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:34,800
what your prediction how it matches to
 

2319
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,349
what your prediction how it matches to
the actual real world

2320
00:44:36,349 --> 00:44:36,359
the actual real world
 

2321
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:37,849
the actual real world
yeah those things have to run pretty

2322
00:44:37,849 --> 00:44:37,859
yeah those things have to run pretty
 

2323
00:44:37,859 --> 00:44:39,829
yeah those things have to run pretty
quickly what's the challenge of running

2324
00:44:39,829 --> 00:44:39,839
quickly what's the challenge of running
 

2325
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:42,710
quickly what's the challenge of running
things pretty quickly a thousand Hertz

2326
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:42,720
things pretty quickly a thousand Hertz
 

2327
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,950
things pretty quickly a thousand Hertz
of acting and sensing

2328
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:45,960
of acting and sensing
 

2329
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,349
of acting and sensing
quickly you know there's a few different

2330
00:44:48,349 --> 00:44:48,359
quickly you know there's a few different
 

2331
00:44:48,359 --> 00:44:50,690
quickly you know there's a few different
layers of that you you want at the

2332
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:50,700
layers of that you you want at the
 

2333
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:52,609
layers of that you you want at the
lowest level you like to run things

2334
00:44:52,609 --> 00:44:52,619
lowest level you like to run things
 

2335
00:44:52,619 --> 00:44:54,770
lowest level you like to run things
typically at around a thousand Hertz

2336
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:54,780
typically at around a thousand Hertz
 

2337
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:56,630
typically at around a thousand Hertz
which means that you know at each joint

2338
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:56,640
which means that you know at each joint
 

2339
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,790
which means that you know at each joint
of the robot you're measuring position

2340
00:44:58,790 --> 00:44:58,800
of the robot you're measuring position
 

2341
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,790
of the robot you're measuring position
or force and then trying to control your

2342
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:01,800
or force and then trying to control your
 

2343
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,530
or force and then trying to control your
actuator whether it's a hydraulic or

2344
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:03,540
actuator whether it's a hydraulic or
 

2345
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:05,990
actuator whether it's a hydraulic or
electric motor trying to control the

2346
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:06,000
electric motor trying to control the
 

2347
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,849
electric motor trying to control the
force coming out of that actuator and

2348
00:45:07,849 --> 00:45:07,859
force coming out of that actuator and
 

2349
00:45:07,859 --> 00:45:10,370
force coming out of that actuator and
you want to do that really fast

2350
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:10,380
you want to do that really fast
 

2351
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:12,290
you want to do that really fast
something like a thousand Hertz and that

2352
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:12,300
something like a thousand Hertz and that
 

2353
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:13,550
something like a thousand Hertz and that
means you can't have too much

2354
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:13,560
means you can't have too much
 

2355
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,970
means you can't have too much
calculation going on at that joint

2356
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:16,980
calculation going on at that joint
 

2357
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:18,710
calculation going on at that joint
um but that's pretty manageable these

2358
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:18,720
um but that's pretty manageable these
 

2359
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,630
um but that's pretty manageable these
days and it's fairly common

2360
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:20,640
days and it's fairly common
 

2361
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,550
days and it's fairly common
and then there's another layer that

2362
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:22,560
and then there's another layer that
 

2363
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,650
and then there's another layer that
you're probably calculating you know

2364
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:24,660
you're probably calculating you know
 

2365
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:27,770
you're probably calculating you know
maybe at 100 Hertz maybe 10 times slower

2366
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:27,780
maybe at 100 Hertz maybe 10 times slower
 

2367
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,450
maybe at 100 Hertz maybe 10 times slower
which is now starting to look at the

2368
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:29,460
which is now starting to look at the
 

2369
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:32,390
which is now starting to look at the
overall body motion and thinking about

2370
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:32,400
overall body motion and thinking about
 

2371
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,809
overall body motion and thinking about
the the larger physics of of the uh of

2372
00:45:35,809 --> 00:45:35,819
the the larger physics of of the uh of
 

2373
00:45:35,819 --> 00:45:37,790
the the larger physics of of the uh of
the robot

2374
00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:37,800
the robot
 

2375
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,530
the robot
um and then there's yet another loop

2376
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:39,540
um and then there's yet another loop
 

2377
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:41,030
um and then there's yet another loop
that's probably happening a little bit

2378
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:41,040
that's probably happening a little bit
 

2379
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,829
that's probably happening a little bit
slower which is where you start to bring

2380
00:45:42,829 --> 00:45:42,839
slower which is where you start to bring
 

2381
00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:44,930
slower which is where you start to bring
you know your perception and your vision

2382
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:44,940
you know your perception and your vision
 

2383
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:47,930
you know your perception and your vision
and things like that and so you need to

2384
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:47,940
and things like that and so you need to
 

2385
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,309
and things like that and so you need to
run all of these Loops sort of

2386
00:45:49,309 --> 00:45:49,319
run all of these Loops sort of
 

2387
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:51,890
run all of these Loops sort of
simultaneously you do have to manage

2388
00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:51,900
simultaneously you do have to manage
 

2389
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:55,130
simultaneously you do have to manage
your your computer time so that you can

2390
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:55,140
your your computer time so that you can
 

2391
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:57,109
your your computer time so that you can
squeeze in all the calculations you need

2392
00:45:57,109 --> 00:45:57,119
squeeze in all the calculations you need
 

2393
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:01,150
squeeze in all the calculations you need
in real time in a very consistent way

2394
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:01,160
in real time in a very consistent way
 

2395
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:04,609
in real time in a very consistent way
and the amount of calculation we can do

2396
00:46:04,609 --> 00:46:04,619
and the amount of calculation we can do
 

2397
00:46:04,619 --> 00:46:07,430
and the amount of calculation we can do
is increasing as computers get better

2398
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:07,440
is increasing as computers get better
 

2399
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,170
is increasing as computers get better
which means we can start to do more

2400
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:09,180
which means we can start to do more
 

2401
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:11,450
which means we can start to do more
sophisticated calculations I can have a

2402
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:11,460
sophisticated calculations I can have a
 

2403
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:13,250
sophisticated calculations I can have a
more complex model

2404
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:13,260
more complex model
 

2405
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:15,650
more complex model
doing my forward prediction

2406
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:15,660
doing my forward prediction
 

2407
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:18,530
doing my forward prediction
and and that might allow me to do even

2408
00:46:18,530 --> 00:46:18,540
and and that might allow me to do even
 

2409
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:20,329
and and that might allow me to do even
better predictions as I as I get better

2410
00:46:20,329 --> 00:46:20,339
better predictions as I as I get better
 

2411
00:46:20,339 --> 00:46:22,309
better predictions as I as I get better
and better and and it used to be again

2412
00:46:22,309 --> 00:46:22,319
and better and and it used to be again
 

2413
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:23,630
and better and and it used to be again
we had

2414
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:23,640
we had
 

2415
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,790
we had
you know 10 years ago

00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:25,800
you know 10 years ago
 

2417
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:29,210
you know 10 years ago
we had to have pretty simple models

2418
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:29,220
we had to have pretty simple models
 

2419
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:31,609
we had to have pretty simple models
that we were running you know at those

2420
00:46:31,609 --> 00:46:31,619
that we were running you know at those
 

2421
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:33,650
that we were running you know at those
fast rates because the computers weren't

00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:33,660
fast rates because the computers weren't
 

2423
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:36,230

pipeline of software engineering how
 

2433
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:49,490

00:46:58,970 --> 00:46:58,980
it's an important part of building a
 

2443
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:03,109
it's an important part of building a
team around it which means you know you

2444
00:47:03,109 --> 00:47:03,119
team around it which means you know you
 

2445
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:04,849
team around it which means you know you
need to also have a software tools

2446
00:47:04,849 --> 00:47:04,859
need to also have a software tools
 

2447
00:47:04,859 --> 00:47:07,849
need to also have a software tools
simulation tools you know so

2448
00:47:07,849 --> 00:47:07,859
simulation tools you know so
 

2449
00:47:07,859 --> 00:47:11,770
simulation tools you know so
um we have always made strong use of

2450
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:11,780
um we have always made strong use of
 

2451
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:14,870
um we have always made strong use of
physics-based simulation tools to do uh

2452
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:14,880
physics-based simulation tools to do uh
 

2453
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,050
physics-based simulation tools to do uh
some of this calculation basically

2454
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:18,060
some of this calculation basically
 

2455
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:20,089
some of this calculation basically
tested in simulation before you put it

2456
00:47:20,089 --> 00:47:20,099
tested in simulation before you put it
 

2457
00:47:20,099 --> 00:47:22,370
tested in simulation before you put it
on the robot but you also want the same

2458
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:22,380
on the robot but you also want the same
 

2459
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:23,990
on the robot but you also want the same
code that you're running in simulation

2460
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:24,000
code that you're running in simulation
 

2461
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,730
code that you're running in simulation
to be the same code you're running on

2462
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:25,740
to be the same code you're running on
 

2463
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:28,730
to be the same code you're running on
the hardware and so even getting to the

2464
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:28,740
the hardware and so even getting to the
 

2465
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:30,589
the hardware and so even getting to the
point where it was the same code going

2466
00:47:30,589 --> 00:47:30,599
point where it was the same code going
 

2467
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:32,030
point where it was the same code going
from one to the other

2468
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:32,040
from one to the other
 

2469
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,770
from one to the other
we probably didn't really get that

2470
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:33,780
we probably didn't really get that
 

2471
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:35,569
we probably didn't really get that
working until you know a few years

several years ago
 

2475
00:47:37,619 --> 00:47:38,930
several years ago
um but that was a you know that was a

2476
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:38,940
um but that was a you know that was a
 

2477
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:41,270
um but that was a you know that was a
bit of a milestone and so you want to

2478
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:41,280
bit of a milestone and so you want to
 

2479
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,950
bit of a milestone and so you want to
work certainly work these pipelines so

2480
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:42,960
work certainly work these pipelines so
 

2481
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,630
work certainly work these pipelines so
that you can make it as easy as possible

2482
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:44,640
that you can make it as easy as possible
 

2483
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,250
that you can make it as easy as possible
and have a bunch of people working in

and have a bunch of people working in
 

2485
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:48,230

00:47:59,099 --> 00:48:01,309
40 developers there all trying to gain
access to it and so you need to share

2498

access to it and so you need to share
 

2499
00:48:01,319 --> 00:48:03,770
access to it and so you need to share
resources and use some of these uh some

2500
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:03,780
resources and use some of these uh some

00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:34,140
started at MIT and
 

2525
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:37,370
started at MIT and
um we built some some good physics-based

2526
00:48:37,370 --> 00:48:37,380
um we built some some good physics-based
 

2527
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:38,870
um we built some some good physics-based
modeling tools there

00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:42,770
the early days of the company we were
trying to develop those tools as a

trying to develop those tools as a
 

2533
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:44,690
trying to develop those tools as a
commercial product so we continued to

2534
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:44,700
commercial product so we continued to
 

2535
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,609
commercial product so we continued to
develop them it wasn't a particularly

develop them it wasn't a particularly
 

2537
00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:48,589
develop them it wasn't a particularly
successful commercial product but we

2538
00:48:48,589 --> 00:48:48,599
successful commercial product but we
 

2539
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:50,030
successful commercial product but we
ended up with some nice physics-based

2540
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:50,040
ended up with some nice physics-based
 

2541
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,589
ended up with some nice physics-based
simulation tools so that when we started

2542
00:48:51,589 --> 00:48:51,599
simulation tools so that when we started
 

2543
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:53,329
simulation tools so that when we started
doing legged robotics again we had a

2544
00:48:53,329 --> 00:48:53,339
doing legged robotics again we had a
 

2545
00:48:53,339 --> 00:48:55,069
doing legged robotics again we had a
really nice tool to work with

2546
00:48:55,069 --> 00:48:55,079
really nice tool to work with
 

2547
00:48:55,079 --> 00:48:57,410
really nice tool to work with
and the things we paid attention to were

2548
00:48:57,410 --> 00:48:57,420
and the things we paid attention to were
 

2549
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:59,630
and the things we paid attention to were
were things that weren't necessarily

2550
00:48:59,630 --> 00:48:59,640
were things that weren't necessarily
 

2551
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,550
were things that weren't necessarily
handled very well in the commercial

2552
00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:01,560
handled very well in the commercial
 

2553
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,470
handled very well in the commercial
tools you could buy off the shelf like

2554
00:49:03,470 --> 00:49:03,480
tools you could buy off the shelf like
 

2555
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,630
tools you could buy off the shelf like
like interaction with the world like

2556
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:05,640
like interaction with the world like
 

2557
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:08,270
like interaction with the world like
foot ground contact so trying to model

2558
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:08,280
foot ground contact so trying to model
 

2559
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,910
foot ground contact so trying to model
those contact

2560
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:10,920
those contact
 

2561
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,829
those contact
um events well

2562
00:49:12,829 --> 00:49:12,839
um events well
 

2563
00:49:12,839 --> 00:49:16,670
um events well
in a way that captured the important

2564
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:16,680
in a way that captured the important
 

2565
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,730
in a way that captured the important
parts of the interaction

2566
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:18,740
parts of the interaction
 

2567
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:21,890
parts of the interaction
was a really important element uh to get

2568
00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:21,900
was a really important element uh to get
 

2569
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:24,109
was a really important element uh to get
right and to also do in a way that was

2570
00:49:24,109 --> 00:49:24,119
right and to also do in a way that was
 

2571
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:25,790
right and to also do in a way that was
computationally feasible

2572
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:25,800
computationally feasible
 

2573
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,730
computationally feasible
and could run fast because if you if

2574
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:28,740
and could run fast because if you if
 

2575
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:31,130
and could run fast because if you if
your simulation runs too slow you know

2576
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:31,140
your simulation runs too slow you know
 

2577
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:32,390
your simulation runs too slow you know
then your developers are sitting around

2578
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:32,400
then your developers are sitting around
 

2579
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,670
then your developers are sitting around
waiting for stuff to run and compile so

2580
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:34,680
waiting for stuff to run and compile so
 

2581
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:38,990
waiting for stuff to run and compile so
it's always about efficient uh a fast

2582
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:39,000
it's always about efficient uh a fast
 

2583
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,150
it's always about efficient uh a fast
operation as well so that's been a big

2584
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:41,160
operation as well so that's been a big
 

2585
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,650
operation as well so that's been a big
part of it you know I think developing

2586
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:42,660
part of it you know I think developing
 

2587
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:44,750
part of it you know I think developing
those tools in parallel to the

2588
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:44,760
those tools in parallel to the
 

2589
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:47,270
those tools in parallel to the
development of the the platform and

2590
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:47,280
development of the the platform and
 

2591
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,430
development of the the platform and
trying to scale them has has really been

2592
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:49,440
trying to scale them has has really been
 

2593
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,970
trying to scale them has has really been
essential I'd say to us being able to

2594
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:52,980
essential I'd say to us being able to
 

2595
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:54,530
essential I'd say to us being able to
assemble a team of people that could do

2596
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:54,540
assemble a team of people that could do
 

2597
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:56,690
assemble a team of people that could do
this yeah how to simulate contact

2598
00:49:56,690 --> 00:49:56,700
this yeah how to simulate contact
 

2599
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:59,270
this yeah how to simulate contact
periods so flick ground contact but sort

2600
00:49:59,270 --> 00:49:59,280
periods so flick ground contact but sort
 

2601
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,430
periods so flick ground contact but sort
of for manipulation

2602
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:01,440
of for manipulation
 

2603
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:05,450
of for manipulation
because don't you want to model all

2604
00:50:05,450 --> 00:50:05,460
because don't you want to model all
 

2605
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,609
because don't you want to model all
kinds of surfaces yeah so it will be

2606
00:50:07,609 --> 00:50:07,619
kinds of surfaces yeah so it will be
 

2607
00:50:07,619 --> 00:50:09,890
kinds of surfaces yeah so it will be
even more complex with manipulation

2608
00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:09,900
even more complex with manipulation
 

2609
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:11,809
even more complex with manipulation
because there's a lot more going on you

2610
00:50:11,809 --> 00:50:11,819
because there's a lot more going on you
 

2611
00:50:11,819 --> 00:50:14,569
because there's a lot more going on you
know and you need to capture I don't

2612
00:50:14,569 --> 00:50:14,579
know and you need to capture I don't
 

2613
00:50:14,579 --> 00:50:16,910
know and you need to capture I don't
know things slipping and moving you know

2614
00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:16,920
know things slipping and moving you know
 

2615
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,849
know things slipping and moving you know
in in your in your hand

2616
00:50:19,849 --> 00:50:19,859
in in your in your hand
 

2617
00:50:19,859 --> 00:50:22,790
in in your in your hand
um it's a level of complexity that I

2618
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:22,800
um it's a level of complexity that I
 

2619
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,390
um it's a level of complexity that I
think goes above foot ground contact

2620
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:26,400
think goes above foot ground contact
 

2621
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,790
think goes above foot ground contact
when you really start doing dexterous

2622
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:28,800
when you really start doing dexterous
 

2623
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,829
when you really start doing dexterous
manipulation so there's challenges ahead

2624
00:50:30,829 --> 00:50:30,839
manipulation so there's challenges ahead
 

2625
00:50:30,839 --> 00:50:33,470
manipulation so there's challenges ahead
still so how far are we away from me

2626
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:33,480
still so how far are we away from me
 

2627
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,870
still so how far are we away from me
being able to walk with Atlas in the

2628
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:35,880
being able to walk with Atlas in the
 

2629
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,809
being able to walk with Atlas in the
sand along the beach and

2630
00:50:38,809 --> 00:50:38,819
sand along the beach and
 

2631
00:50:38,819 --> 00:50:42,230
sand along the beach and
us both drinking a beer

2632
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:42,240
us both drinking a beer
 

2633
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,210
us both drinking a beer
yeah maybe we can out of a kid maybe

2634
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:44,220
yeah maybe we can out of a kid maybe
 

2635
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:45,829
yeah maybe we can out of a kid maybe
Atlas could spill his beer because he's

2636
00:50:45,829 --> 00:50:45,839
Atlas could spill his beer because he's
 

2637
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:48,470
Atlas could spill his beer because he's
got nowhere to put it

2638
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:48,480
got nowhere to put it
 

2639
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,990
got nowhere to put it
Alice could walk on the sand uh so can

2640
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:51,000
Alice could walk on the sand uh so can
 

2641
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,930
Alice could walk on the sand uh so can
it yeah uh yeah I mean you know have we

2642
00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:53,940
it yeah uh yeah I mean you know have we
 

2643
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:55,970
it yeah uh yeah I mean you know have we
really had him out on the beach you know

2644
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:55,980
really had him out on the beach you know
 

2645
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:57,890
really had him out on the beach you know
we take them outside often you know

2646
00:50:57,890 --> 00:50:57,900
we take them outside often you know
 

2647
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:00,170
we take them outside often you know
rocks Hills that sort of thing even just

2648
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:00,180
rocks Hills that sort of thing even just
 

2649
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:02,569
rocks Hills that sort of thing even just
around our lab in Waltham we probably

2650
00:51:02,569 --> 00:51:02,579
around our lab in Waltham we probably
 

2651
00:51:02,579 --> 00:51:05,329
around our lab in Waltham we probably
haven't been on the sand but I'm a salt

2652
00:51:05,329 --> 00:51:05,339
haven't been on the sand but I'm a salt
 

2653
00:51:05,339 --> 00:51:07,069
haven't been on the sand but I'm a salt
surface I don't doubt that we could deal

2654
00:51:07,069 --> 00:51:07,079
surface I don't doubt that we could deal
 

2655
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:09,829
surface I don't doubt that we could deal
with it yeah we we might have to spend a

2656
00:51:09,829 --> 00:51:09,839
with it yeah we we might have to spend a
 

2657
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:10,970
with it yeah we we might have to spend a
little bit of time to sort of make that

2658
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:10,980
little bit of time to sort of make that
 

2659
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:15,290
little bit of time to sort of make that
work but we did take uh we we had a had

2660
00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:15,300
work but we did take uh we we had a had
 

2661
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:16,309
work but we did take uh we we had a had
to take

2662
00:51:16,309 --> 00:51:16,319
to take
 

2663
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:21,650
to take
big dog to Thailand years ago and uh we

2664
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:21,660
big dog to Thailand years ago and uh we
 

2665
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:23,870
big dog to Thailand years ago and uh we
did this great video of the robot

2666
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:23,880
did this great video of the robot
 

2667
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,569
did this great video of the robot
walking in the sand walking into the

2668
00:51:26,569 --> 00:51:26,579
walking in the sand walking into the
 

2669
00:51:26,579 --> 00:51:29,809
walking in the sand walking into the
ocean up to I don't know its belly or

2670
00:51:29,809 --> 00:51:29,819
ocean up to I don't know its belly or
 

2671
00:51:29,819 --> 00:51:31,069
ocean up to I don't know its belly or
something like that and then turning

2672
00:51:31,069 --> 00:51:31,079
something like that and then turning
 

2673
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:32,930
something like that and then turning
around and walking out all while playing

2674
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:32,940
around and walking out all while playing
 

2675
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:35,630
around and walking out all while playing
some cool beach music yeah great show

2676
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:35,640
some cool beach music yeah great show
 

2677
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,010
some cool beach music yeah great show
but then you know we didn't really clean

2678
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:37,020
but then you know we didn't really clean
 

2679
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:38,630
but then you know we didn't really clean
the robot off and the salt water was

2680
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:38,640
the robot off and the salt water was
 

2681
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,910
the robot off and the salt water was
really hard on it so you know we put it

2682
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:40,920
really hard on it so you know we put it
 

2683
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,950
really hard on it so you know we put it
in a box shipped it back by the time it

2684
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:42,960
in a box shipped it back by the time it
 

2685
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,309
in a box shipped it back by the time it
came back we had some problems with salt

2686
00:51:46,309 --> 00:51:46,319
came back we had some problems with salt
 

2687
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:48,349
came back we had some problems with salt
it's the salt water it's not like old

2688
00:51:48,349 --> 00:51:48,359
it's the salt water it's not like old
 

2689
00:51:48,359 --> 00:51:50,390
it's the salt water it's not like old
stuff it's not like sand getting into

2690
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:50,400
stuff it's not like sand getting into
 

2691
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,770
stuff it's not like sand getting into
the components or something like this

2692
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:51,780
the components or something like this
 

2693
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:54,049
the components or something like this
but I'm sure if if this is a big

2694
00:51:54,049 --> 00:51:54,059
but I'm sure if if this is a big
 

2695
00:51:54,059 --> 00:51:56,450
but I'm sure if if this is a big
priority you can make it like waterproof

2696
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:56,460
priority you can make it like waterproof
 

2697
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:58,970
priority you can make it like waterproof
right that just wasn't our our goal at

2698
00:51:58,970 --> 00:51:58,980
right that just wasn't our our goal at
 

2699
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:01,130
right that just wasn't our our goal at
the time well it's a personal goal of

2700
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:01,140
the time well it's a personal goal of
 

2701
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:03,950
the time well it's a personal goal of
mine to it walk along the beach but it's

2702
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:03,960
mine to it walk along the beach but it's
 

2703
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:05,390
mine to it walk along the beach but it's
a human problem too you get sand

2704
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:05,400
a human problem too you get sand
 

2705
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,809
a human problem too you get sand
everywhere it's it's just a jam mess

2706
00:52:07,809 --> 00:52:07,819
everywhere it's it's just a jam mess
 

2707
00:52:07,819 --> 00:52:11,510
everywhere it's it's just a jam mess
so soft surfaces are okay so I mean can

2708
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:11,520
so soft surfaces are okay so I mean can
 

2709
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,549
so soft surfaces are okay so I mean can
we just uh link on the the robotics

2710
00:52:13,549 --> 00:52:13,559
we just uh link on the the robotics
 

2711
00:52:13,559 --> 00:52:17,150
we just uh link on the the robotics
challenge there's a there's a pile of uh

2712
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:17,160
challenge there's a there's a pile of uh
 

2713
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:20,210
challenge there's a there's a pile of uh
like Rubble they had to walk over is

2714
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:20,220
like Rubble they had to walk over is
 

2715
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,770
like Rubble they had to walk over is
that's

2716
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:21,780
that's
 

2717
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:23,809
that's
um how difficult is that task

2718
00:52:23,809 --> 00:52:23,819
um how difficult is that task
 

2719
00:52:23,819 --> 00:52:26,150
um how difficult is that task
in the early days of developing big dog

2720
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:26,160
in the early days of developing big dog
 

2721
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:29,210
in the early days of developing big dog
the loose Rock was the epitome of the

2722
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:29,220
the loose Rock was the epitome of the
 

2723
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:30,950
the loose Rock was the epitome of the
hard walking surface because you step

2724
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:30,960
hard walking surface because you step
 

2725
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,049
hard walking surface because you step
down and then the Rock and you had these

2726
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:33,059
down and then the Rock and you had these
 

2727
00:52:33,059 --> 00:52:35,329
down and then the Rock and you had these
little Point feet on the robot

2728
00:52:35,329 --> 00:52:35,339
little Point feet on the robot
 

2729
00:52:35,339 --> 00:52:38,930
little Point feet on the robot
and the rock and roll and and you have

2730
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:38,940
and the rock and roll and and you have
 

2731
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:41,329
and the rock and roll and and you have
to deal with that last minute you know

2732
00:52:41,329 --> 00:52:41,339
to deal with that last minute you know
 

2733
00:52:41,339 --> 00:52:44,390
to deal with that last minute you know
change in your foot placement yes so you

2734
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:44,400
change in your foot placement yes so you
 

2735
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,069
change in your foot placement yes so you
you step on the thing and that thing

2736
00:52:46,069 --> 00:52:46,079
you step on the thing and that thing
 

2737
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:48,410
you step on the thing and that thing
responds to you stepping on it yeah and

2738
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:48,420
responds to you stepping on it yeah and
 

2739
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:49,910
responds to you stepping on it yeah and
and it moves where your point of support

2740
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:49,920
and it moves where your point of support
 

2741
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,210
and it moves where your point of support
is and so it's really that that became

2742
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:53,220
is and so it's really that that became
 

2743
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:55,730
is and so it's really that that became
kind of the essence of the test and so

2744
00:52:55,730 --> 00:52:55,740
kind of the essence of the test and so
 

2745
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:57,829
kind of the essence of the test and so
that was the beginning of us starting to

2746
00:52:57,829 --> 00:52:57,839
that was the beginning of us starting to
 

2747
00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:02,030
that was the beginning of us starting to
build Rock piles in our parking lots and

2748
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:02,040
build Rock piles in our parking lots and
 

2749
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:04,069
build Rock piles in our parking lots and
and we would actually build boxes full

2750
00:53:04,069 --> 00:53:04,079
and we would actually build boxes full
 

2751
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:06,470
and we would actually build boxes full
of rocks and bring them into the lab and

2752
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:06,480
of rocks and bring them into the lab and
 

2753
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,790
of rocks and bring them into the lab and
then we would have the robots walking

2754
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:07,800
then we would have the robots walking
 

2755
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,950
then we would have the robots walking
across these boxes of rocks because that

2756
00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:09,960
across these boxes of rocks because that
 

2757
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,250
across these boxes of rocks because that
became the essential test

2758
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:12,260
became the essential test
 

2759
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:15,109
became the essential test
so you mentioned big dog can you can we

2760
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:15,119
so you mentioned big dog can you can we
 

2761
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:16,970
so you mentioned big dog can you can we
maybe take a stroll through the history

2762
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:16,980
maybe take a stroll through the history
 

2763
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:20,870
maybe take a stroll through the history
of Boston Dynamics uh so what and who's

2764
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:20,880
of Boston Dynamics uh so what and who's
 

2765
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,890
of Boston Dynamics uh so what and who's
Big Dog by the way is who

2766
00:53:23,890 --> 00:53:23,900
Big Dog by the way is who
 

2767
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:27,410
Big Dog by the way is who
do you try not to anthropomorphize the

2768
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:27,420
do you try not to anthropomorphize the
 

2769
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:29,870
do you try not to anthropomorphize the
robots do you try not to

2770
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:29,880
robots do you try not to
 

2771
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:32,089
robots do you try not to
to try to remember that they're this is

2772
00:53:32,089 --> 00:53:32,099
to try to remember that they're this is
 

2773
00:53:32,099 --> 00:53:33,589
to try to remember that they're this is
like the division I have because I for

2774
00:53:33,589 --> 00:53:33,599
like the division I have because I for
 

2775
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:34,910
like the division I have because I for
me it's impossible

2776
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:34,920
me it's impossible
 

2777
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,250
me it's impossible
for me there's a magic to the to the

2778
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:37,260
for me there's a magic to the to the
 

2779
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:38,930
for me there's a magic to the to the
being that is a robot it is not human

2780
00:53:38,930 --> 00:53:38,940
being that is a robot it is not human
 

2781
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:41,270
being that is a robot it is not human
but it is

2782
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:41,280
but it is
 

2783
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,210
but it is
the same Magic

2784
00:53:44,210 --> 00:53:44,220
the same Magic
 

2785
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:46,670
the same Magic
uh the living being has when it moves

2786
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:46,680
uh the living being has when it moves
 

2787
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:49,790
uh the living being has when it moves
about the world is there in the robot so

2788
00:53:49,790 --> 00:53:49,800
about the world is there in the robot so
 

2789
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,829
about the world is there in the robot so
um I don't know what question I'm asking

2790
00:53:51,829 --> 00:53:51,839
um I don't know what question I'm asking
 

2791
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:53,930
um I don't know what question I'm asking
but uh should I say what or who I guess

2792
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:53,940
but uh should I say what or who I guess
 

2793
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:56,990
but uh should I say what or who I guess
who is Big Dog what is big dog

2794
00:53:56,990 --> 00:53:57,000
who is Big Dog what is big dog
 

2795
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,089
who is Big Dog what is big dog
well I'll say to address the medic

2796
00:53:59,089 --> 00:53:59,099
well I'll say to address the medic
 

2797
00:53:59,099 --> 00:54:00,230
well I'll say to address the medic
question

2798
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:00,240
question
 

2799
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,690
question
we don't try to draw hard lines around

2800
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:02,700
we don't try to draw hard lines around
 

2801
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:06,710
we don't try to draw hard lines around
it being an it or a him or a her

2802
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:06,720
it being an it or a him or a her
 

2803
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:10,010
it being an it or a him or a her
um it's okay right people I think part

2804
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:10,020
um it's okay right people I think part
 

2805
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:12,370
um it's okay right people I think part
of the magic of these kinds of machines

2806
00:54:12,370 --> 00:54:12,380
of the magic of these kinds of machines
 

2807
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:16,370
of the magic of these kinds of machines
is by nature of their organic movement

2808
00:54:16,370 --> 00:54:16,380
is by nature of their organic movement
 

2809
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:18,829
is by nature of their organic movement
of the of their Dynamics

2810
00:54:18,829 --> 00:54:18,839
of the of their Dynamics
 

2811
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:22,609
of the of their Dynamics
we tend to want to identify with them we

2812
00:54:22,609 --> 00:54:22,619
we tend to want to identify with them we
 

2813
00:54:22,619 --> 00:54:24,410
we tend to want to identify with them we
tend to look at them and sort of

2814
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:24,420
tend to look at them and sort of
 

2815
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:25,849
tend to look at them and sort of
attribute

2816
00:54:25,849 --> 00:54:25,859
attribute
 

2817
00:54:25,859 --> 00:54:28,549
attribute
maybe feeling to that because we've only

2818
00:54:28,549 --> 00:54:28,559
maybe feeling to that because we've only
 

2819
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:31,010
maybe feeling to that because we've only
seen things that move like this that

2820
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:31,020
seen things that move like this that
 

2821
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:32,510
seen things that move like this that
were alive

2822
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:32,520
were alive
 

2823
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,309
were alive
and so

2824
00:54:34,309 --> 00:54:34,319
and so
 

2825
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:36,470
and so
um this is an opportunity it means that

2826
00:54:36,470 --> 00:54:36,480
um this is an opportunity it means that
 

2827
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,990
um this is an opportunity it means that
you could have

2828
00:54:38,990 --> 00:54:39,000
you could have
 

2829
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,049
you could have
feelings for a machine and you know

2830
00:54:42,049 --> 00:54:42,059
feelings for a machine and you know
 

2831
00:54:42,059 --> 00:54:43,790
feelings for a machine and you know
people have feelings for their cars you

2832
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:43,800
people have feelings for their cars you
 

2833
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,770
people have feelings for their cars you
know they get attracted to them attached

2834
00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:45,780
know they get attracted to them attached
 

2835
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:49,010
know they get attracted to them attached
to them so that's inherently could be a

2836
00:54:49,010 --> 00:54:49,020
to them so that's inherently could be a
 

2837
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:50,809
to them so that's inherently could be a
good thing as long as we manage what

2838
00:54:50,809 --> 00:54:50,819
good thing as long as we manage what
 

2839
00:54:50,819 --> 00:54:52,309
good thing as long as we manage what
that interaction is

2840
00:54:52,309 --> 00:54:52,319
that interaction is
 

2841
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:56,030
that interaction is
so we don't put strong boundaries around

2842
00:54:56,030 --> 00:54:56,040
so we don't put strong boundaries around
 

2843
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,069
so we don't put strong boundaries around
this and ultimately think it's a benefit

2844
00:54:58,069 --> 00:54:58,079
this and ultimately think it's a benefit
 

2845
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:01,250
this and ultimately think it's a benefit
but it's also can be a bit of a curse

2846
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:01,260
but it's also can be a bit of a curse
 

2847
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:03,109
but it's also can be a bit of a curse
because I think people look at these

2848
00:55:03,109 --> 00:55:03,119
because I think people look at these
 

2849
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:04,430
because I think people look at these
machines

2850
00:55:04,430 --> 00:55:04,440
machines
 

2851
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,230
machines
and they attribute a level of

2852
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:06,240
and they attribute a level of
 

2853
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,490
and they attribute a level of
intelligence that the machines don't

2854
00:55:07,490 --> 00:55:07,500
intelligence that the machines don't
 

2855
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:10,309
intelligence that the machines don't
have why because again they've seen

2856
00:55:10,309 --> 00:55:10,319
have why because again they've seen
 

2857
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:12,049
have why because again they've seen
things move like this that we're living

2858
00:55:12,049 --> 00:55:12,059
things move like this that we're living
 

2859
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:13,970
things move like this that we're living
beings

2860
00:55:13,970 --> 00:55:13,980
beings
 

2861
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:15,829
beings
which are intelligent

2862
00:55:15,829 --> 00:55:15,839
which are intelligent
 

2863
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:17,210
which are intelligent
and so they want to attribute

2864
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:17,220
and so they want to attribute
 

2865
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:19,430
and so they want to attribute
intelligence to the robots that isn't

2866
00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:19,440
intelligence to the robots that isn't
 

2867
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,049
intelligence to the robots that isn't
appropriate yet even though they move

2868
00:55:21,049 --> 00:55:21,059
appropriate yet even though they move
 

2869
00:55:21,059 --> 00:55:23,569
appropriate yet even though they move
like an intelligent being but you try to

2870
00:55:23,569 --> 00:55:23,579
like an intelligent being but you try to
 

2871
00:55:23,579 --> 00:55:25,030
like an intelligent being but you try to
acknowledge that the

2872
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:25,040
acknowledge that the
 

2873
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:28,849
acknowledge that the
anthropomorphization is there and try to

2874
00:55:28,849 --> 00:55:28,859
anthropomorphization is there and try to
 

2875
00:55:28,859 --> 00:55:31,549
anthropomorphization is there and try to
first of all acknowledge that it's there

2876
00:55:31,549 --> 00:55:31,559
first of all acknowledge that it's there
 

2877
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:33,410
first of all acknowledge that it's there
and have a little fun with it you know

2878
00:55:33,410 --> 00:55:33,420
and have a little fun with it you know
 

2879
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:35,270
and have a little fun with it you know

it's just kind of fun you know to to

2882
00:55:38,349 --> 00:55:38,359
it's just kind of fun you know to to
 

2883
00:55:38,359 --> 00:55:41,690
it's just kind of fun you know to to
look at the robot we started off the the

2884
00:55:41,690 --> 00:55:41,700
look at the robot we started off the the
 

2885
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:44,329
look at the robot we started off the the
video with Atlas

2886
00:55:44,329 --> 00:55:44,339
video with Atlas
 

2887
00:55:44,339 --> 00:55:46,670
video with Atlas
um kind of looking around for where the

2888
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:46,680
um kind of looking around for where the
 

2889
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:49,010
um kind of looking around for where the
bag of tools was because the guy up on

2890
00:55:49,010 --> 00:55:49,020
bag of tools was because the guy up on
 

2891
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:50,870
bag of tools was because the guy up on
the scaffolding says send me some tools

2892
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:50,880
the scaffolding says send me some tools
 

2893
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,510
the scaffolding says send me some tools
Atlas has to kind of look around and see

2894
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:53,520
Atlas has to kind of look around and see
 

2895
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,370
Atlas has to kind of look around and see
where they are and there's a little

2896
00:55:55,370 --> 00:55:55,380
where they are and there's a little
 

2897
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:58,309
where they are and there's a little
personality there that is fun it's

2898
00:55:58,309 --> 00:55:58,319
personality there that is fun it's
 

2899
00:55:58,319 --> 00:55:59,450
personality there that is fun it's
entertaining it makes our jobs

2900
00:55:59,450 --> 00:55:59,460
entertaining it makes our jobs
 

2901
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:01,790
entertaining it makes our jobs
interesting and I think in the long run

2902
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:01,800
interesting and I think in the long run
 

2903
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:04,549
interesting and I think in the long run
can enhance interaction between humans

2904
00:56:04,549 --> 00:56:04,559
can enhance interaction between humans
 

2905
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:06,950
can enhance interaction between humans
and robots that in a way that isn't

2906
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:06,960
and robots that in a way that isn't
 

2907
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,870
and robots that in a way that isn't
available to machines that don't move

2908
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:08,880
available to machines that don't move
 

2909
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,430
available to machines that don't move
that way this is something to me

2910
00:56:10,430 --> 00:56:10,440
that way this is something to me
 

2911
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:12,290
that way this is something to me
personally is very interesting I've been

2912
00:56:12,290 --> 00:56:12,300
personally is very interesting I've been
 

2913
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:12,950

um
 

2915
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:17,710
um
I happen to have a lot of legged robots

2916
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:17,720
I happen to have a lot of legged robots
 

2917
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:20,930
I happen to have a lot of legged robots
I hope uh to have a lot of spots in my

2918
00:56:20,930 --> 00:56:20,940
I hope uh to have a lot of spots in my
 

2919
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:22,670
I hope uh to have a lot of spots in my
possession

2920
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:22,680
possession
 

2921
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:24,109
possession
um I'm interested in celebrating

2922
00:56:24,109 --> 00:56:24,119
um I'm interested in celebrating
 

2923
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:26,150
um I'm interested in celebrating
Robotics and celebrating companies and I

2924
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:26,160
Robotics and celebrating companies and I
 

2925
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,010
Robotics and celebrating companies and I
also don't want to companies that do

2926
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:28,020
also don't want to companies that do
 

2927
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:29,569
also don't want to companies that do
incredible stuff like Boston Dynamics

2928
00:56:29,569 --> 00:56:29,579
incredible stuff like Boston Dynamics
 

2929
00:56:29,579 --> 00:56:32,450
incredible stuff like Boston Dynamics
and I there's a

2930
00:56:32,450 --> 00:56:32,460
and I there's a
 

2931
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:35,270
and I there's a
you know I'm a little crazy and you say

2932
00:56:35,270 --> 00:56:35,280
you know I'm a little crazy and you say
 

2933
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,030
you know I'm a little crazy and you say
you don't want to you you want to align

2934
00:56:38,030 --> 00:56:38,040
you don't want to you you want to align
 

2935
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:40,190
you don't want to you you want to align
you want to help the company because I

2936
00:56:40,190 --> 00:56:40,200
you want to help the company because I
 

2937
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,710
you want to help the company because I
ultimately want a company that busted an

2938
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:42,720
ultimately want a company that busted an
 

2939
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,690
ultimately want a company that busted an
image to succeed and part of that will

2940
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:44,700
image to succeed and part of that will
 

2941
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,549
image to succeed and part of that will
talk about you know success kind of

2942
00:56:46,549 --> 00:56:46,559
talk about you know success kind of
 

2943
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:48,109
talk about you know success kind of
requires making money

2944
00:56:48,109 --> 00:56:48,119
requires making money
 

2945
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:50,750
requires making money
and so the kind of stuff I'm

2946
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:50,760
and so the kind of stuff I'm
 

2947
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:53,210
and so the kind of stuff I'm
particularly interested in may not be

2948
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:53,220
particularly interested in may not be
 

2949
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:54,410
particularly interested in may not be
the thing that makes money in the short

2950
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:54,420
the thing that makes money in the short
 

2951
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:56,630
the thing that makes money in the short
term I can make an argument they will in

2952
00:56:56,630 --> 00:56:56,640
term I can make an argument they will in
 

2953
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,790
term I can make an argument they will in
the long term but the kind of stuff I've

2954
00:56:58,790 --> 00:56:58,800
the long term but the kind of stuff I've
 

2955
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:03,589
the long term but the kind of stuff I've
been playing with is a robust way of uh

2956
00:57:03,589 --> 00:57:03,599
been playing with is a robust way of uh
 

2957
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:05,329
been playing with is a robust way of uh
having the quadruped though the robot

2958
00:57:05,329 --> 00:57:05,339
having the quadruped though the robot
 

2959
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:07,670
having the quadruped though the robot
dogs communicate emotion with their body

2960
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:07,680
dogs communicate emotion with their body
 

2961
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,589
dogs communicate emotion with their body
movement the same kind of stuff you do

2962
00:57:09,589 --> 00:57:09,599
movement the same kind of stuff you do
 

2963
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:11,870
movement the same kind of stuff you do
with it with a dog but not not

2964
00:57:11,870 --> 00:57:11,880
with it with a dog but not not
 

2965
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:15,530
with it with a dog but not not
hard-coded uh but in a robust way and be

2966
00:57:15,530 --> 00:57:15,540
hard-coded uh but in a robust way and be
 

2967
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:18,130
hard-coded uh but in a robust way and be
able to communicate excitement or fear

2968
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:18,140
able to communicate excitement or fear
 

2969
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:21,290
able to communicate excitement or fear
boredom all this kind of stuff and I

2970
00:57:21,290 --> 00:57:21,300
boredom all this kind of stuff and I
 

2971
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:23,870
boredom all this kind of stuff and I
think as a base layer

2972
00:57:23,870 --> 00:57:23,880
think as a base layer
 

2973
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:27,530
think as a base layer
of function of behavior to add on top of

2974
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:27,540
of function of behavior to add on top of
 

2975
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:29,089
of function of behavior to add on top of
a robot I think that's a really powerful

2976
00:57:29,089 --> 00:57:29,099
a robot I think that's a really powerful
 

2977
00:57:29,099 --> 00:57:32,750
a robot I think that's a really powerful
way uh to make the robot more usable for

2978
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:32,760
way uh to make the robot more usable for
 

2979
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:34,190
way uh to make the robot more usable for
humans for whatever application it's

2980
00:57:34,190 --> 00:57:34,200
humans for whatever application it's
 

2981
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,589
humans for whatever application it's
going to be really important and um it's

2982
00:57:36,589 --> 00:57:36,599
going to be really important and um it's
 

2983
00:57:36,599 --> 00:57:38,569
going to be really important and um it's
a thing we're we're beginning to pay

2984
00:57:38,569 --> 00:57:38,579
a thing we're we're beginning to pay
 

2985
00:57:38,579 --> 00:57:40,790
a thing we're we're beginning to pay
attention to

2986
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:40,800
attention to
 

2987
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:43,130
attention to
um we really want to start a

2988
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:43,140
um we really want to start a
 

2989
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:44,630
um we really want to start a
differentiator for the company has

2990
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:44,640
differentiator for the company has
 

2991
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,609
differentiator for the company has
always been we really want the robot to

2992
00:57:46,609 --> 00:57:46,619
always been we really want the robot to
 

2993
00:57:46,619 --> 00:57:50,210
always been we really want the robot to
work we want it to be useful uh

2994
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:50,220
work we want it to be useful uh
 

2995
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:52,730
work we want it to be useful uh
making it work at first meant the the

2996
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:52,740
making it work at first meant the the
 

2997
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:55,010
making it work at first meant the the
legged Locomotion really works it can

2998
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:55,020
legged Locomotion really works it can
 

2999
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:56,510
legged Locomotion really works it can
really get around and it doesn't fall

3000
00:57:56,510 --> 00:57:56,520
really get around and it doesn't fall
 

3001
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:58,730
really get around and it doesn't fall
down and

3002
00:57:58,730 --> 00:57:58,740
down and
 

3003
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:01,309
down and
um but beyond that and now it needs to

3004
00:58:01,309 --> 00:58:01,319
um but beyond that and now it needs to
 

3005
00:58:01,319 --> 00:58:04,250
um but beyond that and now it needs to

to get through this complex facility in
 

3015
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:15,349
to get through this complex facility in
a reliable way you know taking taking

3016
00:58:15,349 --> 00:58:15,359
a reliable way you know taking taking
 

3017
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:17,510
a reliable way you know taking taking
measurements

measurements
 

3019
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:20,750
measurements
we need for people who are operating

3020
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:20,760
we need for people who are operating
 

3021
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:22,370
we need for people who are operating
those robots to understand what the

3022
00:58:22,370 --> 00:58:22,380
those robots to understand what the
 

3023
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:23,569
those robots to understand what the
robots are doing

3024
00:58:23,569 --> 00:58:23,579
robots are doing
 

3025
00:58:23,579 --> 00:58:26,690
robots are doing
if the robot gets into needs help or or

3026
00:58:26,690 --> 00:58:26,700
if the robot gets into needs help or or
 

3027
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:29,210
if the robot gets into needs help or or
you know is in trouble or something it

3028
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:29,220
you know is in trouble or something it
 

3029
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:30,890
you know is in trouble or something it
needs to be able to communicate

3030
00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:30,900
needs to be able to communicate
 

3031
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:34,130
needs to be able to communicate
and a physical indication of some sort

3032
00:58:34,130 --> 00:58:34,140
and a physical indication of some sort
 

3033
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:36,289
and a physical indication of some sort
uh to so that a person looked at the

3034
00:58:36,289 --> 00:58:36,299
uh to so that a person looked at the
 

3035
00:58:36,299 --> 00:58:37,609
uh to so that a person looked at the
robot and goes oh I know what that's

3036
00:58:37,609 --> 00:58:37,619
robot and goes oh I know what that's
 

3037
00:58:37,619 --> 00:58:39,650
robot and goes oh I know what that's
that robot's doing the robot's going to

3038
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:39,660
that robot's doing the robot's going to
 

3039
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:42,530
that robot's doing the robot's going to
go take measurements of my vacuum pump

3040
00:58:42,530 --> 00:58:42,540
go take measurements of my vacuum pump
 

3041
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:44,569
go take measurements of my vacuum pump
with its thermal camera

3042
00:58:44,569 --> 00:58:44,579
with its thermal camera
 

3043
00:58:44,579 --> 00:58:47,329
with its thermal camera
you know you want to be able to indicate

3044
00:58:47,329 --> 00:58:47,339
you know you want to be able to indicate
 

3045
00:58:47,339 --> 00:58:51,109
you know you want to be able to indicate
that and or even just the robots

3046
00:58:51,109 --> 00:58:51,119
that and or even just the robots
 

3047
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:52,910
that and or even just the robots
um about to turn you know in front of

3048
00:58:52,910 --> 00:58:52,920
um about to turn you know in front of
 

3049
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:55,069
um about to turn you know in front of
you and maybe indicate that it's going

3050
00:58:55,069 --> 00:58:55,079
you and maybe indicate that it's going
 

3051
00:58:55,079 --> 00:58:57,289
you and maybe indicate that it's going
to turn and so you sort of see and can

3052
00:58:57,289 --> 00:58:57,299
to turn and so you sort of see and can
 

3053
00:58:57,299 --> 00:58:59,450
to turn and so you sort of see and can
anticipate its motion so these this kind

3054
00:58:59,450 --> 00:58:59,460
anticipate its motion so these this kind
 

3055
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:01,190
anticipate its motion so these this kind
of communication is going to become more

3056
00:59:01,190 --> 00:59:01,200
of communication is going to become more
 

3057
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,530
of communication is going to become more
and more important it wasn't sort of our

3058
00:59:03,530 --> 00:59:03,540
and more important it wasn't sort of our
 

3059
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,030
and more important it wasn't sort of our
starting point

3060
00:59:05,030 --> 00:59:05,040
starting point
 

3061
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,789
starting point
um you know but now the the robots are

3062
00:59:07,789 --> 00:59:07,799
um you know but now the the robots are
 

3063
00:59:07,799 --> 00:59:10,609
um you know but now the the robots are
really out in the world and you know we

3064
00:59:10,609 --> 00:59:10,619
really out in the world and you know we
 

3065
00:59:10,619 --> 00:59:12,230
really out in the world and you know we
have about a thousand of them out with

3066
00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:12,240
have about a thousand of them out with
 

3067
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,270
have about a thousand of them out with
with customers right now

3068
00:59:14,270 --> 00:59:14,280
with customers right now
 

3069
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:18,770
with customers right now
this layer of physical indication I

3070
00:59:18,770 --> 00:59:18,780
this layer of physical indication I
 

3071
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:20,150
this layer of physical indication I
think is going to become more and more

3072
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:20,160
think is going to become more and more
 

3073
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,849
think is going to become more and more
important we'll talk about where it goes

3074
00:59:22,849 --> 00:59:22,859
important we'll talk about where it goes
 

3075
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:24,049
important we'll talk about where it goes
because there's a lot of interesting

3076
00:59:24,049 --> 00:59:24,059
because there's a lot of interesting
 

3077
00:59:24,059 --> 00:59:26,089
because there's a lot of interesting
possibilities but if you can return back

3078
00:59:26,089 --> 00:59:26,099
possibilities but if you can return back
 

3079
00:59:26,099 --> 00:59:28,370
possibilities but if you can return back
to the origins of Boston and Dynamics

3080
00:59:28,370 --> 00:59:28,380
to the origins of Boston and Dynamics
 

3081
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:30,789
to the origins of Boston and Dynamics
with so that the more research the r d

3082
00:59:30,789 --> 00:59:30,799
with so that the more research the r d
 

3083
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:34,789
with so that the more research the r d
side before we talk about how to build

3084
00:59:34,789 --> 00:59:34,799
side before we talk about how to build
 

3085
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:38,270
side before we talk about how to build
robots at scale so big dog so um who's

3086
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:38,280
robots at scale so big dog so um who's
 

3087
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:43,970
robots at scale so big dog so um who's
Big Dog so the company started in 1992.

3088
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:43,980
Big Dog so the company started in 1992.
 

3089
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:50,450
Big Dog so the company started in 1992.
and in um probably uh uh 2003

3090
00:59:50,450 --> 00:59:50,460
and in um probably uh uh 2003
 

3091
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:54,049
and in um probably uh uh 2003
I believe is when we uh took a contract

3092
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:54,059
I believe is when we uh took a contract
 

3093
00:59:54,059 --> 00:59:58,970
I believe is when we uh took a contract
from darpto basically 10 years 11 years

3094
00:59:58,970 --> 00:59:58,980
from darpto basically 10 years 11 years
 

3095
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:00,650
from darpto basically 10 years 11 years
um we weren't doing robotics we did a

3096
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:00,660
um we weren't doing robotics we did a
 

3097
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:02,990
um we weren't doing robotics we did a
little bit of Robotics with Sony they

3098
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:03,000
little bit of Robotics with Sony they
 

3099
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,809
little bit of Robotics with Sony they
had uh IBO the their IBO robot we were

3100
01:00:05,809 --> 01:00:05,819
had uh IBO the their IBO robot we were
 

3101
01:00:05,819 --> 01:00:07,370
had uh IBO the their IBO robot we were
developing some software for that that

3102
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:07,380
developing some software for that that
 

3103
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:08,930
developing some software for that that
kind of got us a little bit involved

3104
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:08,940
kind of got us a little bit involved
 

3105
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:11,210
kind of got us a little bit involved
with robotics again then there's this

3106
01:00:11,210 --> 01:00:11,220
with robotics again then there's this
 

3107
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:13,609
with robotics again then there's this
opportunity to do a DARPA contract where

3108
01:00:13,609 --> 01:00:13,619
opportunity to do a DARPA contract where
 

3109
01:00:13,619 --> 01:00:16,309
opportunity to do a DARPA contract where
they wanted to build

3110
01:00:16,309 --> 01:00:16,319
they wanted to build
 

3111
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:20,390
they wanted to build
a robot dog and uh we we won a contract

3112
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:20,400
a robot dog and uh we we won a contract
 

3113
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,549
a robot dog and uh we we won a contract
to build that and so that was the

3114
01:00:22,549 --> 01:00:22,559
to build that and so that was the
 

3115
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:24,589
to build that and so that was the
Genesis of big dog

3116
01:00:24,589 --> 01:00:24,599
Genesis of big dog
 

3117
01:00:24,599 --> 01:00:27,049
Genesis of big dog
and it was a quadruped and it was the

3118
01:00:27,049 --> 01:00:27,059
and it was a quadruped and it was the
 

3119
01:00:27,059 --> 01:00:28,730
and it was a quadruped and it was the
first time we built a robot that had

3120
01:00:28,730 --> 01:00:28,740
first time we built a robot that had
 

3121
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:30,349
first time we built a robot that had
everything on board that you could

3122
01:00:30,349 --> 01:00:30,359
everything on board that you could
 

3123
01:00:30,359 --> 01:00:32,089
everything on board that you could
actually take the robot out into the

3124
01:00:32,089 --> 01:00:32,099
actually take the robot out into the
 

3125
01:00:32,099 --> 01:00:33,829
actually take the robot out into the
wild and operate it so it had onboard

3126
01:00:33,829 --> 01:00:33,839
wild and operate it so it had onboard
 

3127
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:36,710
wild and operate it so it had onboard
power plant it had onboard computers it

3128
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:36,720
power plant it had onboard computers it
 

3129
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:37,630
power plant it had onboard computers it
had

3130
01:00:37,630 --> 01:00:37,640
had
 

3131
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:40,190
had
hydraulic actuators that needed to be

3132
01:00:40,190 --> 01:00:40,200
hydraulic actuators that needed to be
 

3133
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,230
hydraulic actuators that needed to be
cooled so we had cooling systems built

3134
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:42,240
cooled so we had cooling systems built
 

3135
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:42,890
cooled so we had cooling systems built
in

3136
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:42,900
in
 

3137
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:45,530
in
everything integrated into the robot

3138
01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:45,540
everything integrated into the robot
 

3139
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:47,990
everything integrated into the robot
and uh that was a pretty rough start

3140
01:00:47,990 --> 01:00:48,000
and uh that was a pretty rough start
 

3141
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,809
and uh that was a pretty rough start
right it was it was 10 years that we

3142
01:00:50,809 --> 01:00:50,819
right it was it was 10 years that we
 

3143
01:00:50,819 --> 01:00:52,549
right it was it was 10 years that we
were not a robotics company we were a

3144
01:00:52,549 --> 01:00:52,559
were not a robotics company we were a
 

3145
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:54,109
were not a robotics company we were a
simulation company and then we had to

3146
01:00:54,109 --> 01:00:54,119
simulation company and then we had to
 

3147
01:00:54,119 --> 01:00:56,270
simulation company and then we had to
build a robot in about a year so that

3148
01:00:56,270 --> 01:00:56,280
build a robot in about a year so that
 

3149
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:59,390
build a robot in about a year so that
was a little bit of a rough transition

3150
01:00:59,390 --> 01:00:59,400
was a little bit of a rough transition
 

3151
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,910
was a little bit of a rough transition
um

3152
01:01:00,910 --> 01:01:00,920
um
 

3153
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:03,349
um
can you just comment on the roughness of

3154
01:01:03,349 --> 01:01:03,359
can you just comment on the roughness of
 

3155
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:06,410
can you just comment on the roughness of
that transition because uh big dog I

3156
01:01:06,410 --> 01:01:06,420
that transition because uh big dog I
 

3157
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:08,470
that transition because uh big dog I
mean this is just big

3158
01:01:08,470 --> 01:01:08,480
mean this is just big
 

3159
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:12,530
mean this is just big
uh quadruped four legs robot rebuilt a

3160
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:12,540
uh quadruped four legs robot rebuilt a
 

3161
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:14,150
uh quadruped four legs robot rebuilt a
few different versions of them but the

3162
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:14,160
few different versions of them but the
 

3163
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,770
few different versions of them but the
first one you're the very earliest ones

3164
01:01:15,770 --> 01:01:15,780
first one you're the very earliest ones
 

3165
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:17,809
first one you're the very earliest ones
you know it didn't work very well and we

3166
01:01:17,809 --> 01:01:17,819
you know it didn't work very well and we
 

3167
01:01:17,819 --> 01:01:20,329
you know it didn't work very well and we
would take them out and it was hard to

3168
01:01:20,329 --> 01:01:20,339
would take them out and it was hard to
 

3169
01:01:20,339 --> 01:01:22,190
would take them out and it was hard to
get you know uh

3170
01:01:22,190 --> 01:01:22,200
get you know uh
 

3171
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,770
get you know uh
you know a go-kart engine driving a

3172
01:01:24,770 --> 01:01:24,780
you know a go-kart engine driving a
 

3173
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:26,809
you know a go-kart engine driving a
hydraulic that's not what it was

3174
01:01:26,809 --> 01:01:26,819
hydraulic that's not what it was
 

3175
01:01:26,819 --> 01:01:29,870
hydraulic that's not what it was
and and you know uh having that all work

3176
01:01:29,870 --> 01:01:29,880
and and you know uh having that all work
 

3177
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:33,170
and and you know uh having that all work
uh while trying to get you know the

3178
01:01:33,170 --> 01:01:33,180
uh while trying to get you know the
 

3179
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:35,270
uh while trying to get you know the
robot to stabilize itself and so what

3180
01:01:35,270 --> 01:01:35,280
robot to stabilize itself and so what
 

3181
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,829
robot to stabilize itself and so what
was the power plan what was the engine

3182
01:01:36,829 --> 01:01:36,839
was the power plan what was the engine
 

3183
01:01:36,839 --> 01:01:38,990
was the power plan what was the engine
it seemed like uh my vague direct

3184
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:39,000
it seemed like uh my vague direct
 

3185
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,170
it seemed like uh my vague direct
collection

3186
01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:41,180
collection
 

3187
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:44,690
collection
I don't know it felt very loud and

3188
01:01:44,690 --> 01:01:44,700
I don't know it felt very loud and
 

3189
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:46,910
I don't know it felt very loud and
aggressive and uh kind of thrown

3190
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:46,920
aggressive and uh kind of thrown
 

3191
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:48,530
aggressive and uh kind of thrown
together that's what it kind of oh it

3192
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:48,540
together that's what it kind of oh it
 

3193
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:50,630
together that's what it kind of oh it
absolutely was right we weren't trying

3194
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:50,640
absolutely was right we weren't trying
 

3195
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:53,150
absolutely was right we weren't trying
to design the best robot Hardware at the

3196
01:01:53,150 --> 01:01:53,160
to design the best robot Hardware at the
 

3197
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:53,870
to design the best robot Hardware at the
time

3198
01:01:53,870 --> 01:01:53,880
time
 

3199
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:57,109
time
and uh we wanted to buy an off-the-shelf

3200
01:01:57,109 --> 01:01:57,119
and uh we wanted to buy an off-the-shelf
 

3201
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:00,170
and uh we wanted to buy an off-the-shelf
engine and so many of the early versions

3202
01:02:00,170 --> 01:02:00,180
engine and so many of the early versions
 

3203
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:03,410
engine and so many of the early versions
of big dog had literally go-kart engines

3204
01:02:03,410 --> 01:02:03,420
of big dog had literally go-kart engines
 

3205
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:05,690
of big dog had literally go-kart engines
or something like that usually yeah like

3206
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:05,700
or something like that usually yeah like
 

3207
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:07,849
or something like that usually yeah like
a yeah gas powered two-stroke engine

3208
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:07,859
a yeah gas powered two-stroke engine
 

3209
01:02:07,859 --> 01:02:09,650
a yeah gas powered two-stroke engine
and the reason why it was two-stroke is

3210
01:02:09,650 --> 01:02:09,660
and the reason why it was two-stroke is
 

3211
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:12,049
and the reason why it was two-stroke is
two-stroke engines are lighter weight

3212
01:02:12,049 --> 01:02:12,059
two-stroke engines are lighter weight
 

3213
01:02:12,059 --> 01:02:14,809
two-stroke engines are lighter weight
but they're also and we we generally

3214
01:02:14,809 --> 01:02:14,819
but they're also and we we generally
 

3215
01:02:14,819 --> 01:02:16,069
but they're also and we we generally
didn't put Mufflers on them because

3216
01:02:16,069 --> 01:02:16,079
didn't put Mufflers on them because
 

3217
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:17,569
didn't put Mufflers on them because
we're trying to save the weight and we

3218
01:02:17,569 --> 01:02:17,579
we're trying to save the weight and we
 

3219
01:02:17,579 --> 01:02:19,609
we're trying to save the weight and we
didn't care about the noise and so these

3220
01:02:19,609 --> 01:02:19,619
didn't care about the noise and so these
 

3221
01:02:19,619 --> 01:02:21,710
didn't care about the noise and so these
things were horribly loud

3222
01:02:21,710 --> 01:02:21,720
things were horribly loud
 

3223
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:23,030
things were horribly loud
um but we're trying to manage weight

3224
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:23,040
um but we're trying to manage weight
 

3225
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:25,309
um but we're trying to manage weight
because managing weight in a legged

3226
01:02:25,309 --> 01:02:25,319
because managing weight in a legged
 

3227
01:02:25,319 --> 01:02:27,109
because managing weight in a legged
robot is always important because it has

3228
01:02:27,109 --> 01:02:27,119
robot is always important because it has
 

3229
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:28,549
robot is always important because it has
to carry everything

3230
01:02:28,549 --> 01:02:28,559
to carry everything
 

3231
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:31,309
to carry everything
that said that thing was big well I've

3232
01:02:31,309 --> 01:02:31,319
that said that thing was big well I've
 

3233
01:02:31,319 --> 01:02:33,049
that said that thing was big well I've
seen the videos yeah I mean the the

3234
01:02:33,049 --> 01:02:33,059
seen the videos yeah I mean the the
 

3235
01:02:33,059 --> 01:02:35,390
seen the videos yeah I mean the the
early versions you know stood about I

3236
01:02:35,390 --> 01:02:35,400
early versions you know stood about I
 

3237
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:38,630
early versions you know stood about I
don't know belly High chest High

3238
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:38,640
don't know belly High chest High
 

3239
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,609
don't know belly High chest High
um you know they probably weighed maybe

3240
01:02:40,609 --> 01:02:40,619
um you know they probably weighed maybe
 

3241
01:02:40,619 --> 01:02:43,069
um you know they probably weighed maybe
a couple of hundred pounds but you know

3242
01:02:43,069 --> 01:02:43,079
a couple of hundred pounds but you know
 

3243
01:02:43,079 --> 01:02:45,890
a couple of hundred pounds but you know
it over the course of probably five

3244
01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:45,900
it over the course of probably five
 

3245
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:47,569
it over the course of probably five
years

3246
01:02:47,569 --> 01:02:47,579
years
 

3247
01:02:47,579 --> 01:02:50,950
years
we are able to get that robot

3248
01:02:50,950 --> 01:02:50,960
we are able to get that robot
 

3249
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:54,829
we are able to get that robot
to really manage a remarkable level of

3250
01:02:54,829 --> 01:02:54,839
to really manage a remarkable level of
 

3251
01:02:54,839 --> 01:02:56,750
to really manage a remarkable level of
rough terrain so you know we started out

3252
01:02:56,750 --> 01:02:56,760
rough terrain so you know we started out
 

3253
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:58,250
rough terrain so you know we started out
with just walking on the flat and then

3254
01:02:58,250 --> 01:02:58,260
with just walking on the flat and then
 

3255
01:02:58,260 --> 01:02:59,750
with just walking on the flat and then
we started walking on rocks and then

3256
01:02:59,750 --> 01:02:59,760
we started walking on rocks and then
 

3257
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,930
we started walking on rocks and then
inclines and then mud and slippery mud

3258
01:03:02,930 --> 01:03:02,940
inclines and then mud and slippery mud
 

3259
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:05,109
inclines and then mud and slippery mud
and you know by the end of that program

3260
01:03:05,109 --> 01:03:05,119
and you know by the end of that program
 

3261
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:09,289
and you know by the end of that program
we were convinced that legged Locomotion

3262
01:03:09,289 --> 01:03:09,299
we were convinced that legged Locomotion
 

3263
01:03:09,299 --> 01:03:11,630
we were convinced that legged Locomotion
in a robot could actually work because

3264
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:11,640
in a robot could actually work because
 

3265
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:13,370
in a robot could actually work because
you know going into it we didn't we

3266
01:03:13,370 --> 01:03:13,380
you know going into it we didn't we
 

3267
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:15,710
you know going into it we didn't we
didn't know that we had built quadrupeds

3268
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:15,720
didn't know that we had built quadrupeds
 

3269
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:17,630
didn't know that we had built quadrupeds
at at MIT

3270
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:17,640
at at MIT
 

3271
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,910
at at MIT
but they were they used a giant

3272
01:03:19,910 --> 01:03:19,920
but they were they used a giant
 

3273
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,010
but they were they used a giant
hydraulic pump you know in the lab they

3274
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:22,020
hydraulic pump you know in the lab they
 

3275
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:23,630
hydraulic pump you know in the lab they
used a giant computer that was in the

3276
01:03:23,630 --> 01:03:23,640
used a giant computer that was in the
 

3277
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:26,150
used a giant computer that was in the
lab they were always Tethered to the lab

3278
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:26,160
lab they were always Tethered to the lab
 

3279
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:28,130
lab they were always Tethered to the lab
this was the first time something that

3280
01:03:28,130 --> 01:03:28,140
this was the first time something that
 

3281
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:30,170
this was the first time something that
was sort of self-contained you know

3282
01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:30,180
was sort of self-contained you know
 

3283
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:32,870
was sort of self-contained you know
walked around in the world

3284
01:03:32,870 --> 01:03:32,880
walked around in the world
 

3285
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:35,510
walked around in the world
and balance but and and the purpose was

3286
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:35,520
and balance but and and the purpose was
 

3287
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,190
and balance but and and the purpose was
to prove to ourselves that the legged

3288
01:03:37,190 --> 01:03:37,200
to prove to ourselves that the legged
 

3289
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:39,710
to prove to ourselves that the legged
Locomotion could really work and so

3290
01:03:39,710 --> 01:03:39,720
Locomotion could really work and so
 

3291
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,450
Locomotion could really work and so
um big dog really cut that open for us

3292
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:41,460
um big dog really cut that open for us
 

3293
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:43,910
um big dog really cut that open for us
and it was the beginning of what became

3294
01:03:43,910 --> 01:03:43,920
and it was the beginning of what became
 

3295
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,190
and it was the beginning of what became
a whole series of robots so once once we

3296
01:03:46,190 --> 01:03:46,200
a whole series of robots so once once we
 

3297
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:47,930
a whole series of robots so once once we
showed to darpan that you could make it

3298
01:03:47,930 --> 01:03:47,940
showed to darpan that you could make it
 

3299
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:49,730
showed to darpan that you could make it
like a robot that could work

3300
01:03:49,730 --> 01:03:49,740
like a robot that could work
 

3301
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:51,589
like a robot that could work
there was a period at DARPA where

3302
01:03:51,589 --> 01:03:51,599
there was a period at DARPA where
 

3303
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:53,990
there was a period at DARPA where
robotics got really hot and there was

3304
01:03:53,990 --> 01:03:54,000
robotics got really hot and there was
 

3305
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,609
robotics got really hot and there was
lots of different programs

3306
01:03:55,609 --> 01:03:55,619
lots of different programs
 

3307
01:03:55,619 --> 01:03:57,770
lots of different programs
and uh you know we were able to build

3308
01:03:57,770 --> 01:03:57,780
and uh you know we were able to build
 

3309
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:00,230
and uh you know we were able to build
other robots we built other quadrupeds

3310
01:04:00,230 --> 01:04:00,240
other robots we built other quadrupeds
 

3311
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:02,329
other robots we built other quadrupeds
to hand like LS3

3312
01:04:02,329 --> 01:04:02,339
to hand like LS3
 

3313
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:05,569
to hand like LS3
designed to carry heavy loads we built

3314
01:04:05,569 --> 01:04:05,579
designed to carry heavy loads we built
 

3315
01:04:05,579 --> 01:04:08,030
designed to carry heavy loads we built
cheetah which was designed to explore

3316
01:04:08,030 --> 01:04:08,040
cheetah which was designed to explore
 

3317
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:10,130
cheetah which was designed to explore
what are the limits to how fast you can

3318
01:04:10,130 --> 01:04:10,140
what are the limits to how fast you can
 

3319
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:10,789
what are the limits to how fast you can
run

3320
01:04:10,789 --> 01:04:10,799
run
 

3321
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:13,069
run
you know we began to build sort of a

3322
01:04:13,069 --> 01:04:13,079
you know we began to build sort of a
 

3323
01:04:13,079 --> 01:04:14,450
you know we began to build sort of a
portfolio

3324
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:14,460
portfolio
 

3325
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:18,349
portfolio
of machines and software that let us

3326
01:04:18,349 --> 01:04:18,359
of machines and software that let us
 

3327
01:04:18,359 --> 01:04:20,809
of machines and software that let us
build not just one robot but a whole

3328
01:04:20,809 --> 01:04:20,819
build not just one robot but a whole
 

3329
01:04:20,819 --> 01:04:22,670
build not just one robot but a whole
family everyone to push the limits in

3330
01:04:22,670 --> 01:04:22,680
family everyone to push the limits in
 

3331
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:24,289
family everyone to push the limits in
all kinds of directions yeah and to

3332
01:04:24,289 --> 01:04:24,299
all kinds of directions yeah and to
 

3333
01:04:24,299 --> 01:04:25,789
all kinds of directions yeah and to
discover those principles you know you

3334
01:04:25,789 --> 01:04:25,799
discover those principles you know you
 

3335
01:04:25,799 --> 01:04:27,470
discover those principles you know you
asked earlier about the Art and Science

3336
01:04:27,470 --> 01:04:27,480
asked earlier about the Art and Science
 

3337
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:29,210
asked earlier about the Art and Science
of a leg and locomotion

3338
01:04:29,210 --> 01:04:29,220
of a leg and locomotion
 

3339
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:31,730
of a leg and locomotion
we it were able to develop principles of

3340
01:04:31,730 --> 01:04:31,740
we it were able to develop principles of
 

3341
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:33,530
we it were able to develop principles of
legged Locomotion so that we knew how to

3342
01:04:33,530 --> 01:04:33,540
legged Locomotion so that we knew how to
 

3343
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:34,190
legged Locomotion so that we knew how to
build

3344
01:04:34,190 --> 01:04:34,200
build
 

3345
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:36,230
build
a small legged robot or a big one so

3346
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:36,240
a small legged robot or a big one so
 

3347
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,870
a small legged robot or a big one so
like like length you know was now a

3348
01:04:38,870 --> 01:04:38,880
like like length you know was now a
 

3349
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:41,150
like like length you know was now a
parameter that we could play with

3350
01:04:41,150 --> 01:04:41,160
parameter that we could play with
 

3351
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:43,490
parameter that we could play with
payload was a parameter we could play

3352
01:04:43,490 --> 01:04:43,500
payload was a parameter we could play
 

3353
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:45,650
payload was a parameter we could play
with so we built the LS3 which was an

3354
01:04:45,650 --> 01:04:45,660
with so we built the LS3 which was an
 

3355
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:47,990
with so we built the LS3 which was an
800 pound robot designed to carry a 400

3356
01:04:47,990 --> 01:04:48,000
800 pound robot designed to carry a 400
 

3357
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,430
800 pound robot designed to carry a 400
pound payload

3358
01:04:49,430 --> 01:04:49,440
pound payload
 

3359
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,530
pound payload
and we we learned the design rules

3360
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:51,540
and we we learned the design rules
 

3361
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:54,049
and we we learned the design rules
basically developed the design rules how

3362
01:04:54,049 --> 01:04:54,059
basically developed the design rules how
 

3363
01:04:54,059 --> 01:04:56,870
basically developed the design rules how
do you scale different robot systems to

3364
01:04:56,870 --> 01:04:56,880
do you scale different robot systems to
 

3365
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:59,630
do you scale different robot systems to
you know their terrain to their walking

3366
01:04:59,630 --> 01:04:59,640
you know their terrain to their walking
 

3367
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:01,970
you know their terrain to their walking
speed to their payload

3368
01:05:01,970 --> 01:05:01,980
speed to their payload
 

3369
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:07,569
speed to their payload
so when uh was spot born

3370
01:05:07,569 --> 01:05:07,579

 

3371
01:05:07,579 --> 01:05:13,190

2000 and uh 12 or so so again almost 10

3372
01:05:13,190 --> 01:05:13,200
2000 and uh 12 or so so again almost 10
 

3373
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,470
2000 and uh 12 or so so again almost 10
years into sort of a run with DARPA

3374
01:05:15,470 --> 01:05:15,480
years into sort of a run with DARPA
 

3375
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:17,150
years into sort of a run with DARPA
where we built a bunch of different

3376
01:05:17,150 --> 01:05:17,160
where we built a bunch of different
 

3377
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:19,190
where we built a bunch of different
quadrupeds we had a sort of a different

3378
01:05:19,190 --> 01:05:19,200
quadrupeds we had a sort of a different
 

3379
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,510
quadrupeds we had a sort of a different
thread where we started building

3380
01:05:20,510 --> 01:05:20,520
thread where we started building
 

3381
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:23,150
thread where we started building
humanoids

3382
01:05:23,150 --> 01:05:23,160
humanoids
 

3383
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:26,870
humanoids
um we we saw that probably an end was

3384
01:05:26,870 --> 01:05:26,880
um we we saw that probably an end was
 

3385
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:28,789
um we we saw that probably an end was
coming where the government was going to

3386
01:05:28,789 --> 01:05:28,799
coming where the government was going to
 

3387
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:31,130
coming where the government was going to
kind of back off from a lot of Robotics

3388
01:05:31,130 --> 01:05:31,140
kind of back off from a lot of Robotics
 

3389
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:32,569
kind of back off from a lot of Robotics
investment

3390
01:05:32,569 --> 01:05:32,579
investment
 

3391
01:05:32,579 --> 01:05:38,270
investment
and uh in order to maintain progress we

3392
01:05:38,270 --> 01:05:38,280
and uh in order to maintain progress we
 

3393
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:40,430
and uh in order to maintain progress we
just deduced that well we probably need

3394
01:05:40,430 --> 01:05:40,440
just deduced that well we probably need
 

3395
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:42,109
just deduced that well we probably need
to sell ourselves to somebody who wants

3396
01:05:42,109 --> 01:05:42,119
to sell ourselves to somebody who wants
 

3397
01:05:42,119 --> 01:05:43,910
to sell ourselves to somebody who wants
to continue to invest in this this area

3398
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:43,920
to continue to invest in this this area
 

3399
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,770
to continue to invest in this this area
and that was Google

3400
01:05:45,770 --> 01:05:45,780
and that was Google
 

3401
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:47,030
and that was Google
and so

3402
01:05:47,030 --> 01:05:47,040
and so
 

3403
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:50,390
and so
um at Google we would meet regularly

3404
01:05:50,390 --> 01:05:50,400
um at Google we would meet regularly
 

3405
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,210
um at Google we would meet regularly
with Larry Page and Larry just started

3406
01:05:53,210 --> 01:05:53,220
with Larry Page and Larry just started
 

3407
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:54,650
with Larry Page and Larry just started
asking us you know what's your product

3408
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:54,660
asking us you know what's your product
 

3409
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:57,730
asking us you know what's your product
going to be and you know the logical

3410
01:05:57,730 --> 01:05:57,740
going to be and you know the logical
 

3411
01:05:57,740 --> 01:06:00,170
going to be and you know the logical
thing the thing that we had the most

3412
01:06:00,170 --> 01:06:00,180
thing the thing that we had the most
 

3413
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:02,690
thing the thing that we had the most
history with that we wanted to continue

3414
01:06:02,690 --> 01:06:02,700
history with that we wanted to continue
 

3415
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:06,049
history with that we wanted to continue
developing was a quadruped but we knew

3416
01:06:06,049 --> 01:06:06,059
developing was a quadruped but we knew
 

3417
01:06:06,059 --> 01:06:07,490
developing was a quadruped but we knew
it needed to be smaller we knew it

3418
01:06:07,490 --> 01:06:07,500
it needed to be smaller we knew it
 

3419
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:09,890
it needed to be smaller we knew it
couldn't have a gas engine we thought it

3420
01:06:09,890 --> 01:06:09,900
couldn't have a gas engine we thought it
 

3421
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:11,569
couldn't have a gas engine we thought it
probably couldn't be hydraulically

3422
01:06:11,569 --> 01:06:11,579
probably couldn't be hydraulically
 

3423
01:06:11,579 --> 01:06:12,650
probably couldn't be hydraulically
actuated

3424
01:06:12,650 --> 01:06:12,660
actuated
 

3425
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:16,490
actuated
so that began the process of exploring

3426
01:06:16,490 --> 01:06:16,500
so that began the process of exploring
 

3427
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:18,770
so that began the process of exploring
if we could migrate to a smaller

3428
01:06:18,770 --> 01:06:18,780
if we could migrate to a smaller
 

3429
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:21,109
if we could migrate to a smaller
electrically actuated

3430
01:06:21,109 --> 01:06:21,119
electrically actuated
 

3431
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:22,910
electrically actuated
um robot and that was really the Genesis

3432
01:06:22,910 --> 01:06:22,920
um robot and that was really the Genesis
 

3433
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:24,190
um robot and that was really the Genesis
of spot

3434
01:06:24,190 --> 01:06:24,200
of spot
 

3435
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:27,349
of spot
so not a gas engine and the actuators

3436
01:06:27,349 --> 01:06:27,359
so not a gas engine and the actuators
 

3437
01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:29,750
so not a gas engine and the actuators
are electric yes so can you maybe

3438
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:29,760
are electric yes so can you maybe
 

3439
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:32,150
are electric yes so can you maybe
comment on what it's like

3440
01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:32,160
comment on what it's like
 

3441
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:34,670
comment on what it's like
um my Google working with Larry Page

3442
01:06:34,670 --> 01:06:34,680
um my Google working with Larry Page
 

3443
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:36,950
um my Google working with Larry Page
having those meetings and thinking of

3444
01:06:36,950 --> 01:06:36,960
having those meetings and thinking of
 

3445
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,470
having those meetings and thinking of
what will a robot look like

3446
01:06:39,470 --> 01:06:39,480
what will a robot look like
 

3447
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:41,210
what will a robot look like
that could be

3448
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:41,220
that could be
 

3449
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:43,789
that could be
built that scale what like starting to

3450
01:06:43,789 --> 01:06:43,799
built that scale what like starting to
 

3451
01:06:43,799 --> 01:06:45,470
built that scale what like starting to
think about a product

3452
01:06:45,470 --> 01:06:45,480
think about a product
 

3453
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:48,589
think about a product
Larry always liked the the toothbrush

3454
01:06:48,589 --> 01:06:48,599
Larry always liked the the toothbrush
 

3455
01:06:48,599 --> 01:06:50,450
Larry always liked the the toothbrush
test he wanted products that you used

3456
01:06:50,450 --> 01:06:50,460
test he wanted products that you used
 

3457
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:53,029
test he wanted products that you used
every day

3458
01:06:53,029 --> 01:06:53,039

 

3459
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:54,170

um

3460
01:06:54,170 --> 01:06:54,180
um
 

3461
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:56,809
um
what they really wanted was

3462
01:06:56,809 --> 01:06:56,819
what they really wanted was
 

3463
01:06:56,819 --> 01:06:58,510
what they really wanted was
you know a consumer level product

3464
01:06:58,510 --> 01:06:58,520
you know a consumer level product
 

3465
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:02,870
you know a consumer level product
something that would work in your house

3466
01:07:02,870 --> 01:07:02,880

 

3467
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:05,089

we didn't think that was the right next

3468
01:07:05,089 --> 01:07:05,099
we didn't think that was the right next
 

3469
01:07:05,099 --> 01:07:08,089
we didn't think that was the right next
thing to do because to be a consumer

3470
01:07:08,089 --> 01:07:08,099
thing to do because to be a consumer
 

3471
01:07:08,099 --> 01:07:09,950
thing to do because to be a consumer
level product cost is going to be very

3472
01:07:09,950 --> 01:07:09,960
level product cost is going to be very
 

3473
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:11,150
level product cost is going to be very
important

3474
01:07:11,150 --> 01:07:11,160
important
 

3475
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:13,490
important
probably need to cost a few thousand

3476
01:07:13,490 --> 01:07:13,500
probably need to cost a few thousand
 

3477
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:15,650
probably need to cost a few thousand
dollars and we were we were building

3478
01:07:15,650 --> 01:07:15,660
dollars and we were we were building
 

3479
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:17,450
dollars and we were we were building
these machines that cost hundreds of

3480
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:17,460
these machines that cost hundreds of
 

3481
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:19,130
these machines that cost hundreds of
thousands of dollars maybe a million

3482
01:07:19,130 --> 01:07:19,140
thousands of dollars maybe a million
 

3483
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:20,990
thousands of dollars maybe a million
dollars to build of course we were only

3484
01:07:20,990 --> 01:07:21,000
dollars to build of course we were only
 

3485
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,690
dollars to build of course we were only
building a two but

3486
01:07:23,690 --> 01:07:23,700
building a two but
 

3487
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:25,670
building a two but
but we didn't see how to get all the way

3488
01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:25,680
but we didn't see how to get all the way
 

3489
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,470
but we didn't see how to get all the way
to this consumer level product in a

3490
01:07:27,470 --> 01:07:27,480
to this consumer level product in a
 

3491
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:29,809
to this consumer level product in a
short amount in a short amount of time

3492
01:07:29,809 --> 01:07:29,819
short amount in a short amount of time
 

3493
01:07:29,819 --> 01:07:32,990
short amount in a short amount of time
and he suggested that we we make the

3494
01:07:32,990 --> 01:07:33,000
and he suggested that we we make the
 

3495
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,910
and he suggested that we we make the
robots really inexpensive

3496
01:07:34,910 --> 01:07:34,920
robots really inexpensive
 

3497
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:36,890
robots really inexpensive
and part of our philosophy has always

3498
01:07:36,890 --> 01:07:36,900
and part of our philosophy has always
 

3499
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:38,029
and part of our philosophy has always
been

3500
01:07:38,029 --> 01:07:38,039
been
 

3501
01:07:38,039 --> 01:07:40,370
been
build the best hardware you can

3502
01:07:40,370 --> 01:07:40,380
build the best hardware you can
 

3503
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:44,210
build the best hardware you can
make make the machine operate well

3504
01:07:44,210 --> 01:07:44,220
make make the machine operate well
 

3505
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:47,870
make make the machine operate well
so that you're trying to solve

3506
01:07:47,870 --> 01:07:47,880
so that you're trying to solve
 

3507
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:50,630
so that you're trying to solve
you know discover the the hard problem

3508
01:07:50,630 --> 01:07:50,640
you know discover the the hard problem
 

3509
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:52,309
you know discover the the hard problem
that you don't know about don't don't

3510
01:07:52,309 --> 01:07:52,319
that you don't know about don't don't
 

3511
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:54,230
that you don't know about don't don't
make it harder by by building a crappy

3512
01:07:54,230 --> 01:07:54,240
make it harder by by building a crappy
 

3513
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:55,609
make it harder by by building a crappy
machine basically you build the best

3514
01:07:55,609 --> 01:07:55,619
machine basically you build the best
 

3515
01:07:55,619 --> 01:07:57,650
machine basically you build the best
machine you can there's plenty of hard

3516
01:07:57,650 --> 01:07:57,660
machine you can there's plenty of hard
 

3517
01:07:57,660 --> 01:07:58,970
machine you can there's plenty of hard
problems to solve that are going to have

3518
01:07:58,970 --> 01:07:58,980
problems to solve that are going to have
 

3519
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:00,770
problems to solve that are going to have
to do with you know under actuated

3520
01:08:00,770 --> 01:08:00,780
to do with you know under actuated
 

3521
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:02,809
to do with you know under actuated
systems and balance

3522
01:08:02,809 --> 01:08:02,819
systems and balance
 

3523
01:08:02,819 --> 01:08:04,549
systems and balance
and so we wanted to build these high

3524
01:08:04,549 --> 01:08:04,559
and so we wanted to build these high
 

3525
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:07,069
and so we wanted to build these high
quality machines still and we thought

3526
01:08:07,069 --> 01:08:07,079
quality machines still and we thought
 

3527
01:08:07,079 --> 01:08:08,510
quality machines still and we thought
that was important for us to continue

3528
01:08:08,510 --> 01:08:08,520
that was important for us to continue
 

3529
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:11,630
that was important for us to continue
learning about really what was the

3530
01:08:11,630 --> 01:08:11,640
learning about really what was the
 

3531
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:15,890
learning about really what was the
important parts of the make robots work

3532
01:08:15,890 --> 01:08:15,900
important parts of the make robots work
 

3533
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:17,870
important parts of the make robots work
um and so there was a little bit of a

3534
01:08:17,870 --> 01:08:17,880
um and so there was a little bit of a
 

3535
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:20,269
um and so there was a little bit of a
philosophical difference there that we

3536
01:08:20,269 --> 01:08:20,279
philosophical difference there that we
 

3537
01:08:20,279 --> 01:08:22,669
philosophical difference there that we
and and so ultimately that's why we're

3538
01:08:22,669 --> 01:08:22,679
and and so ultimately that's why we're
 

3539
01:08:22,679 --> 01:08:24,050
and and so ultimately that's why we're
building robots for the industrial

3540
01:08:24,050 --> 01:08:24,060
building robots for the industrial
 

3541
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:27,410
building robots for the industrial
sector now because the industry can

3542
01:08:27,410 --> 01:08:27,420
sector now because the industry can
 

3543
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:29,749
sector now because the industry can
afford a more expensive machine because

3544
01:08:29,749 --> 01:08:29,759
afford a more expensive machine because
 

3545
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:32,450
afford a more expensive machine because
you know their productivity depends on

3546
01:08:32,450 --> 01:08:32,460
you know their productivity depends on
 

3547
01:08:32,460 --> 01:08:35,450
you know their productivity depends on
keeping their Factory going and so if

3548
01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:35,460
keeping their Factory going and so if
 

3549
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:38,329
keeping their Factory going and so if
spot costs you know a hundred thousand

3550
01:08:38,329 --> 01:08:38,339
spot costs you know a hundred thousand
 

3551
01:08:38,339 --> 01:08:40,070
spot costs you know a hundred thousand
dollars or more that's not such a big

3552
01:08:40,070 --> 01:08:40,080
dollars or more that's not such a big
 

3553
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:43,010
dollars or more that's not such a big
expense to them whereas at the consumer

3554
01:08:43,010 --> 01:08:43,020
expense to them whereas at the consumer
 

3555
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:44,870
expense to them whereas at the consumer
level no one's going to buy a robot like

3556
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:44,880
level no one's going to buy a robot like
 

3557
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,809
level no one's going to buy a robot like
that and I think we might eventually get

3558
01:08:47,809 --> 01:08:47,819
that and I think we might eventually get
 

3559
01:08:47,819 --> 01:08:50,150
that and I think we might eventually get
to a consumer level product that will be

3560
01:08:50,150 --> 01:08:50,160
to a consumer level product that will be
 

3561
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:51,950
to a consumer level product that will be
that cheap but I think the path to

3562
01:08:51,950 --> 01:08:51,960
that cheap but I think the path to
 

3563
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:53,630
that cheap but I think the path to
getting there needs to go through these

3564
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:53,640
getting there needs to go through these
 

3565
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:55,669
getting there needs to go through these
really nice machines so we can then

3566
01:08:55,669 --> 01:08:55,679
really nice machines so we can then
 

3567
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:57,650
really nice machines so we can then
learn how to simplify

3568
01:08:57,650 --> 01:08:57,660
learn how to simplify
 

3569
01:08:57,660 --> 01:09:00,229
learn how to simplify
so what can you say to the almost the

3570
01:09:00,229 --> 01:09:00,239
so what can you say to the almost the
 

3571
01:09:00,239 --> 01:09:02,990
so what can you say to the almost the
engineering challenge of bringing down

3572
01:09:02,990 --> 01:09:03,000
engineering challenge of bringing down
 

3573
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,729
engineering challenge of bringing down
costs

3574
01:09:04,729 --> 01:09:04,739
costs
 

3575
01:09:04,739 --> 01:09:08,749
costs
of a robot so that presumably when you

3576
01:09:08,749 --> 01:09:08,759
of a robot so that presumably when you
 

3577
01:09:08,759 --> 01:09:10,370
of a robot so that presumably when you
try to build the robot at scale that

3578
01:09:10,370 --> 01:09:10,380
try to build the robot at scale that
 

3579
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:11,870
try to build the robot at scale that
also comes into play when you're trying

3580
01:09:11,870 --> 01:09:11,880
also comes into play when you're trying
 

3581
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:13,430
also comes into play when you're trying
to make money on a robot even in the

3582
01:09:13,430 --> 01:09:13,440
to make money on a robot even in the
 

3583
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:16,490
to make money on a robot even in the
industrial setting but how interesting

3584
01:09:16,490 --> 01:09:16,500
industrial setting but how interesting
 

3585
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:18,550
industrial setting but how interesting
how challenging

3586
01:09:18,550 --> 01:09:18,560
how challenging
 

3587
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:23,150
how challenging
of of a thing is that in particular

3588
01:09:23,150 --> 01:09:23,160
of of a thing is that in particular
 

3589
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:26,090
of of a thing is that in particular
probably new to an r d company yeah I'm

3590
01:09:26,090 --> 01:09:26,100
probably new to an r d company yeah I'm
 

3591
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:28,130
probably new to an r d company yeah I'm
glad you brought that last part up the

3592
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:28,140
glad you brought that last part up the
 

3593
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:29,990
glad you brought that last part up the
transition from an r d company to a

3594
01:09:29,990 --> 01:09:30,000
transition from an r d company to a
 

3595
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,249
transition from an r d company to a
commercial company

3596
01:09:31,249 --> 01:09:31,259
commercial company
 

3597
01:09:31,259 --> 01:09:33,110
commercial company
that's the thing you worry about you

3598
01:09:33,110 --> 01:09:33,120
that's the thing you worry about you
 

3599
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:34,309
that's the thing you worry about you
know because you've got these Engineers

3600
01:09:34,309 --> 01:09:34,319
know because you've got these Engineers
 

3601
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:36,349
know because you've got these Engineers
who love hard problems who want to

3602
01:09:36,349 --> 01:09:36,359
who love hard problems who want to
 

3603
01:09:36,359 --> 01:09:38,510
who love hard problems who want to
figure out how to make robots work and

3604
01:09:38,510 --> 01:09:38,520
figure out how to make robots work and
 

3605
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:39,950
figure out how to make robots work and
you don't know if you have Engineers

3606
01:09:39,950 --> 01:09:39,960
you don't know if you have Engineers
 

3607
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:42,229
you don't know if you have Engineers
that want to work on the quality and

3608
01:09:42,229 --> 01:09:42,239
that want to work on the quality and
 

3609
01:09:42,239 --> 01:09:44,510
that want to work on the quality and
reliability and costs that is ultimately

3610
01:09:44,510 --> 01:09:44,520
reliability and costs that is ultimately
 

3611
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:46,610
reliability and costs that is ultimately
required

3612
01:09:46,610 --> 01:09:46,620
required
 

3613
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:48,829
required
um and indeed you know we have brought

3614
01:09:48,829 --> 01:09:48,839
um and indeed you know we have brought
 

3615
01:09:48,839 --> 01:09:50,689
um and indeed you know we have brought
on a lot of new people who are inspired

3616
01:09:50,689 --> 01:09:50,699
on a lot of new people who are inspired
 

3617
01:09:50,699 --> 01:09:52,010
on a lot of new people who are inspired
by those problems

3618
01:09:52,010 --> 01:09:52,020
by those problems
 

3619
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:54,590
by those problems
but but the big takeaway lesson for me

3620
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:54,600
but but the big takeaway lesson for me
 

3621
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:55,790
but but the big takeaway lesson for me
is

3622
01:09:55,790 --> 01:09:55,800
is
 

3623
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:57,590
is
we have good people we have Engineers

3624
01:09:57,590 --> 01:09:57,600
we have good people we have Engineers
 

3625
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:00,650
we have good people we have Engineers
who want to solve problems and and the

3626
01:10:00,650 --> 01:10:00,660
who want to solve problems and and the
 

3627
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:02,870
who want to solve problems and and the
quality and cost and manufacturability

3628
01:10:02,870 --> 01:10:02,880
quality and cost and manufacturability
 

3629
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:04,970
quality and cost and manufacturability
is just another kind of problem

3630
01:10:04,970 --> 01:10:04,980
is just another kind of problem
 

3631
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:07,910
is just another kind of problem
and because they're so invested in what

3632
01:10:07,910 --> 01:10:07,920
and because they're so invested in what
 

3633
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:10,189
and because they're so invested in what
we're doing they're interested in and

3634
01:10:10,189 --> 01:10:10,199
we're doing they're interested in and
 

3635
01:10:10,199 --> 01:10:12,590
we're doing they're interested in and
we'll go work on on those problems as

3636
01:10:12,590 --> 01:10:12,600
we'll go work on on those problems as
 

3637
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:15,290
we'll go work on on those problems as
well and so I think we're managing that

3638
01:10:15,290 --> 01:10:15,300
well and so I think we're managing that
 

3639
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:17,570
well and so I think we're managing that
transition very well in fact I'm really

3640
01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:17,580
transition very well in fact I'm really
 

3641
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:19,430
transition very well in fact I'm really
pleased that

3642
01:10:19,430 --> 01:10:19,440
pleased that
 

3643
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:22,970
pleased that
I mean uh it's a huge undertaking by the

3644
01:10:22,970 --> 01:10:22,980
I mean uh it's a huge undertaking by the
 

3645
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:25,850
I mean uh it's a huge undertaking by the
way right so even having

3646
01:10:25,850 --> 01:10:25,860
way right so even having
 

3647
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:28,250
way right so even having
to get reliability to where it needs to

3648
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:28,260
to get reliability to where it needs to
 

3649
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:30,709
to get reliability to where it needs to
be we have to have fleets of robots that

3650
01:10:30,709 --> 01:10:30,719
be we have to have fleets of robots that
 

3651
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:33,709
be we have to have fleets of robots that
we're just operating 24 7 in our offices

3652
01:10:33,709 --> 01:10:33,719
we're just operating 24 7 in our offices
 

3653
01:10:33,719 --> 01:10:36,350
we're just operating 24 7 in our offices
to go find those rare failures and

3654
01:10:36,350 --> 01:10:36,360
to go find those rare failures and
 

3655
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:38,450
to go find those rare failures and
eliminate them it's just a totally

3656
01:10:38,450 --> 01:10:38,460
eliminate them it's just a totally
 

3657
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:39,890
eliminate them it's just a totally
different kind of activity than the

3658
01:10:39,890 --> 01:10:39,900
different kind of activity than the
 

3659
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:41,570
different kind of activity than the
research activity where you get it to

3660
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:41,580
research activity where you get it to
 

3661
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:44,510
research activity where you get it to
work you know the one robot you have to

3662
01:10:44,510 --> 01:10:44,520
work you know the one robot you have to
 

3663
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:47,570
work you know the one robot you have to
work in a repeatable way you know at the

3664
01:10:47,570 --> 01:10:47,580
work in a repeatable way you know at the
 

3665
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:49,550
work in a repeatable way you know at the
at the high stakes demo it's just very

3666
01:10:49,550 --> 01:10:49,560
at the high stakes demo it's just very
 

3667
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:51,110
at the high stakes demo it's just very
different

3668
01:10:51,110 --> 01:10:51,120
different
 

3669
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:53,149
different
um but I think we're making remarkable

3670
01:10:53,149 --> 01:10:53,159
um but I think we're making remarkable
 

3671
01:10:53,159 --> 01:10:55,430
um but I think we're making remarkable
progress against it so one of the cool

3672
01:10:55,430 --> 01:10:55,440
progress against it so one of the cool
 

3673
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:57,350
progress against it so one of the cool
things that got a chance to visit Boston

3674
01:10:57,350 --> 01:10:57,360
things that got a chance to visit Boston
 

3675
01:10:57,360 --> 01:11:01,030
things that got a chance to visit Boston
Dynamics and I mean

3676
01:11:01,030 --> 01:11:01,040

 

3677
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:03,950

one of the things that's really cool is

3678
01:11:03,950 --> 01:11:03,960
one of the things that's really cool is
 

3679
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:06,470
one of the things that's really cool is
to see a large number of robots moving

3680
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:06,480
to see a large number of robots moving
 

3681
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:07,550
to see a large number of robots moving
about

3682
01:11:07,550 --> 01:11:07,560
about
 

3683
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:09,350
about
because I think one of the things you

3684
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:09,360
because I think one of the things you
 

3685
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:12,530
because I think one of the things you
notice in the research environment is

3686
01:11:12,530 --> 01:11:12,540
notice in the research environment is
 

3687
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:15,229
notice in the research environment is
the MIT for example I don't think anyone

3688
01:11:15,229 --> 01:11:15,239
the MIT for example I don't think anyone
 

3689
01:11:15,239 --> 01:11:18,010
the MIT for example I don't think anyone
ever has a working robot for prolonged

3690
01:11:18,010 --> 01:11:18,020
ever has a working robot for prolonged
 

3691
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:21,229
ever has a working robot for prolonged
exactly so like most robots are just

3692
01:11:21,229 --> 01:11:21,239
exactly so like most robots are just
 

3693
01:11:21,239 --> 01:11:22,970
exactly so like most robots are just
sitting there in a sad

3694
01:11:22,970 --> 01:11:22,980
sitting there in a sad
 

3695
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:25,310
sitting there in a sad
state of despair waiting to be born

3696
01:11:25,310 --> 01:11:25,320
state of despair waiting to be born
 

3697
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:27,530
state of despair waiting to be born
brought to life for a brief moment of

3698
01:11:27,530 --> 01:11:27,540
brought to life for a brief moment of
 

3699
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:29,990
brought to life for a brief moment of
time but just to have I just I just

3700
01:11:29,990 --> 01:11:30,000
time but just to have I just I just
 

3701
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,970
time but just to have I just I just
remember there's like a there's a spot

3702
01:11:31,970 --> 01:11:31,980
remember there's like a there's a spot
 

3703
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:34,850
remember there's like a there's a spot
robot just I I had like a cowboy hat on

3704
01:11:34,850 --> 01:11:34,860
robot just I I had like a cowboy hat on
 

3705
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:36,470
robot just I I had like a cowboy hat on
it was just walking randomly for

3706
01:11:36,470 --> 01:11:36,480
it was just walking randomly for
 

3707
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:38,209
it was just walking randomly for
whatever reason I don't even know but

3708
01:11:38,209 --> 01:11:38,219
whatever reason I don't even know but
 

3709
01:11:38,219 --> 01:11:41,810
whatever reason I don't even know but
there's a kind of a sense of sentience

3710
01:11:41,810 --> 01:11:41,820
there's a kind of a sense of sentience
 

3711
01:11:41,820 --> 01:11:43,610
there's a kind of a sense of sentience
to it because it doesn't seem like

3712
01:11:43,610 --> 01:11:43,620
to it because it doesn't seem like
 

3713
01:11:43,620 --> 01:11:46,010
to it because it doesn't seem like
anybody was supervising it but it was

3714
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:46,020
anybody was supervising it but it was
 

3715
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:47,390
anybody was supervising it but it was
just doing it I'm gonna stop way short

3716
01:11:47,390 --> 01:11:47,400
just doing it I'm gonna stop way short
 

3717
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:48,890
just doing it I'm gonna stop way short
of the sentience

3718
01:11:48,890 --> 01:11:48,900
of the sentience
 

3719
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:50,330
of the sentience
um it is the case that if you come to

3720
01:11:50,330 --> 01:11:50,340
um it is the case that if you come to
 

3721
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:52,310
um it is the case that if you come to
our office you know today and walk

3722
01:11:52,310 --> 01:11:52,320
our office you know today and walk
 

3723
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,470
our office you know today and walk
around the hallways

3724
01:11:54,470 --> 01:11:54,480
around the hallways
 

3725
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:56,689
around the hallways
um you're gonna see a dozen robots just

3726
01:11:56,689 --> 01:11:56,699
um you're gonna see a dozen robots just
 

3727
01:11:56,699 --> 01:11:58,870
um you're gonna see a dozen robots just
kind of walking around yes all the time

3728
01:11:58,870 --> 01:11:58,880
kind of walking around yes all the time
 

3729
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:02,810
kind of walking around yes all the time
and that's really a reliability test for

3730
01:12:02,810 --> 01:12:02,820
and that's really a reliability test for
 

3731
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:05,450
and that's really a reliability test for
us so we have these robots programmed to

3732
01:12:05,450 --> 01:12:05,460
us so we have these robots programmed to
 

3733
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:08,390
us so we have these robots programmed to
do autonomous missions get up off their

3734
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:08,400
do autonomous missions get up off their
 

3735
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:09,890
do autonomous missions get up off their
charging dock walk around the building

3736
01:12:09,890 --> 01:12:09,900
charging dock walk around the building
 

3737
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:11,810
charging dock walk around the building
collect data at a few different places

3738
01:12:11,810 --> 01:12:11,820
collect data at a few different places
 

3739
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:14,570
collect data at a few different places
and go sit back down and we want that to

3740
01:12:14,570 --> 01:12:14,580
and go sit back down and we want that to
 

3741
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:16,250
and go sit back down and we want that to
be a very reliable process because

3742
01:12:16,250 --> 01:12:16,260
be a very reliable process because
 

3743
01:12:16,260 --> 01:12:19,490
be a very reliable process because
that's what somebody who's running a a

3744
01:12:19,490 --> 01:12:19,500
that's what somebody who's running a a
 

3745
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:22,370
that's what somebody who's running a a
brewery a factory that's what they need

3746
01:12:22,370 --> 01:12:22,380
brewery a factory that's what they need
 

3747
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:24,950
brewery a factory that's what they need
the robot to do so we have to we have to

3748
01:12:24,950 --> 01:12:24,960
the robot to do so we have to we have to
 

3749
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:26,750
the robot to do so we have to we have to
dog food our own robot we have to test

3750
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:26,760
dog food our own robot we have to test
 

3751
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,130
dog food our own robot we have to test
it in that way

3752
01:12:28,130 --> 01:12:28,140
it in that way
 

3753
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:32,149
it in that way
and um so on a weekly basis we have

3754
01:12:32,149 --> 01:12:32,159
and um so on a weekly basis we have
 

3755
01:12:32,159 --> 01:12:35,510
and um so on a weekly basis we have
robots that are accruing something like

3756
01:12:35,510 --> 01:12:35,520
robots that are accruing something like
 

3757
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,910
robots that are accruing something like
um 1500 or maybe 2 000 kilometers of

3758
01:12:37,910 --> 01:12:37,920
um 1500 or maybe 2 000 kilometers of
 

3759
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:38,930
um 1500 or maybe 2 000 kilometers of
walking

3760
01:12:38,930 --> 01:12:38,940
walking
 

3761
01:12:38,940 --> 01:12:41,870
walking
and uh you know over a thousand hours of

3762
01:12:41,870 --> 01:12:41,880
and uh you know over a thousand hours of
 

3763
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:44,689
and uh you know over a thousand hours of
operation every week and that's

3764
01:12:44,689 --> 01:12:44,699
operation every week and that's
 

3765
01:12:44,699 --> 01:12:46,010
operation every week and that's
something that almost I don't think

3766
01:12:46,010 --> 01:12:46,020
something that almost I don't think
 

3767
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:47,510
something that almost I don't think
anybody else in the world can do because

3768
01:12:47,510 --> 01:12:47,520
anybody else in the world can do because
 

3769
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:49,010
anybody else in the world can do because
hey you have to have a fleet of robots

3770
01:12:49,010 --> 01:12:49,020
hey you have to have a fleet of robots
 

3771
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:51,070
hey you have to have a fleet of robots
to just accrue that much information

3772
01:12:51,070 --> 01:12:51,080
to just accrue that much information
 

3773
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:53,750
to just accrue that much information
you have to be willing to dedicate it to

3774
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:53,760
you have to be willing to dedicate it to
 

3775
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:57,530
you have to be willing to dedicate it to
that test and uh so that's but that's

3776
01:12:57,530 --> 01:12:57,540
that test and uh so that's but that's
 

3777
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:58,970
that test and uh so that's but that's
essential that's how you get the

3778
01:12:58,970 --> 01:12:58,980
essential that's how you get the
 

3779
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:00,590
essential that's how you get the
reliability that's how you get it what

3780
01:13:00,590 --> 01:13:00,600
reliability that's how you get it what
 

3781
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,270
reliability that's how you get it what
about some of the cost cutting from the

3782
01:13:02,270 --> 01:13:02,280
about some of the cost cutting from the
 

3783
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:04,430
about some of the cost cutting from the
from the manufacturer side what what

3784
01:13:04,430 --> 01:13:04,440
from the manufacturer side what what
 

3785
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:06,470
from the manufacturer side what what
have you learned from the manufacturer

3786
01:13:06,470 --> 01:13:06,480
have you learned from the manufacturer
 

3787
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:09,229
have you learned from the manufacturer
side of the transition from r d and

3788
01:13:09,229 --> 01:13:09,239
side of the transition from r d and
 

3789
01:13:09,239 --> 01:13:10,729
side of the transition from r d and
we're still we're still learning a lot

3790
01:13:10,729 --> 01:13:10,739
we're still we're still learning a lot
 

3791
01:13:10,739 --> 01:13:11,930
we're still we're still learning a lot
there

3792
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:11,940
there
 

3793
01:13:11,940 --> 01:13:13,729
there
um we're learning how to cast Parts in

3794
01:13:13,729 --> 01:13:13,739
um we're learning how to cast Parts in
 

3795
01:13:13,739 --> 01:13:16,189
um we're learning how to cast Parts in
Solo instead of Mill it all out of you

3796
01:13:16,189 --> 01:13:16,199
Solo instead of Mill it all out of you
 

3797
01:13:16,199 --> 01:13:18,350
Solo instead of Mill it all out of you
know Billet aluminum

3798
01:13:18,350 --> 01:13:18,360
know Billet aluminum
 

3799
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:20,149
know Billet aluminum
um we're learning how to get plastic

3800
01:13:20,149 --> 01:13:20,159
um we're learning how to get plastic
 

3801
01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:22,790
um we're learning how to get plastic
molded parts for and we're learning

3802
01:13:22,790 --> 01:13:22,800
molded parts for and we're learning
 

3803
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:24,950
molded parts for and we're learning
about how to control that process so

3804
01:13:24,950 --> 01:13:24,960
about how to control that process so
 

3805
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:26,570
about how to control that process so
that you can build the same robot twice

3806
01:13:26,570 --> 01:13:26,580
that you can build the same robot twice
 

3807
01:13:26,580 --> 01:13:28,729
that you can build the same robot twice
in a row there's a lot to learn there

3808
01:13:28,729 --> 01:13:28,739
in a row there's a lot to learn there
 

3809
01:13:28,739 --> 01:13:30,470
in a row there's a lot to learn there
and we're only part way through that

3810
01:13:30,470 --> 01:13:30,480
and we're only part way through that
 

3811
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:32,030
and we're only part way through that
process

3812
01:13:32,030 --> 01:13:32,040
process
 

3813
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:33,709
process
um we've we've set up a manufacturing

3814
01:13:33,709 --> 01:13:33,719
um we've we've set up a manufacturing
 

3815
01:13:33,719 --> 01:13:37,310
um we've we've set up a manufacturing
facility in Waltham it's about a mile

3816
01:13:37,310 --> 01:13:37,320
facility in Waltham it's about a mile
 

3817
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:40,070
facility in Waltham it's about a mile
from our headquarters and we're doing

3818
01:13:40,070 --> 01:13:40,080
from our headquarters and we're doing
 

3819
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:41,990
from our headquarters and we're doing
final assembly and test of both spots

3820
01:13:41,990 --> 01:13:42,000
final assembly and test of both spots
 

3821
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,570
final assembly and test of both spots
and stretches you know at that factory

3822
01:13:44,570 --> 01:13:44,580
and stretches you know at that factory
 

3823
01:13:44,580 --> 01:13:46,729
and stretches you know at that factory
and um

3824
01:13:46,729 --> 01:13:46,739
and um
 

3825
01:13:46,739 --> 01:13:49,370
and um
and it's hard because to be honest we're

3826
01:13:49,370 --> 01:13:49,380
and it's hard because to be honest we're
 

3827
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:50,870
and it's hard because to be honest we're
still iterating on the design of the

3828
01:13:50,870 --> 01:13:50,880
still iterating on the design of the
 

3829
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:53,090
still iterating on the design of the
robot as we find failures from these

3830
01:13:53,090 --> 01:13:53,100
robot as we find failures from these
 

3831
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:55,130
robot as we find failures from these
reliability tests we need to go engineer

3832
01:13:55,130 --> 01:13:55,140
reliability tests we need to go engineer
 

3833
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:57,890
reliability tests we need to go engineer
changes and those changes need to now be

3834
01:13:57,890 --> 01:13:57,900
changes and those changes need to now be
 

3835
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:00,290
changes and those changes need to now be
propagated to the manufacturing line and

3836
01:14:00,290 --> 01:14:00,300
propagated to the manufacturing line and
 

3837
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:01,850
propagated to the manufacturing line and
that's a hard process especially when

3838
01:14:01,850 --> 01:14:01,860
that's a hard process especially when
 

3839
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:03,830
that's a hard process especially when
you want to move as fast as we do

3840
01:14:03,830 --> 01:14:03,840
you want to move as fast as we do
 

3841
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:08,450
you want to move as fast as we do
and that's been challenging and it makes

3842
01:14:08,450 --> 01:14:08,460
and that's been challenging and it makes
 

3843
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:09,830
and that's been challenging and it makes
it you know the folks who are working

3844
01:14:09,830 --> 01:14:09,840
it you know the folks who are working
 

3845
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:12,169
it you know the folks who are working
supply chain who are trying to get the

3846
01:14:12,169 --> 01:14:12,179
supply chain who are trying to get the
 

3847
01:14:12,179 --> 01:14:15,169
supply chain who are trying to get the
cheapest parts for us kind of requires

3848
01:14:15,169 --> 01:14:15,179
cheapest parts for us kind of requires
 

3849
01:14:15,179 --> 01:14:16,729
cheapest parts for us kind of requires
that you buy a lot of them to make them

3850
01:14:16,729 --> 01:14:16,739
that you buy a lot of them to make them
 

3851
01:14:16,739 --> 01:14:18,350
that you buy a lot of them to make them
cheap and then we go change the design

3852
01:14:18,350 --> 01:14:18,360
cheap and then we go change the design
 

3853
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:19,669
cheap and then we go change the design
from underneath them and they're like

3854
01:14:19,669 --> 01:14:19,679
from underneath them and they're like
 

3855
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:20,990
from underneath them and they're like
what are you doing and so you know

3856
01:14:20,990 --> 01:14:21,000
what are you doing and so you know
 

3857
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,270
what are you doing and so you know
getting everybody on the same page here

3858
01:14:23,270 --> 01:14:23,280
getting everybody on the same page here
 

3859
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:25,490
getting everybody on the same page here
that it yep we still need to move fast

3860
01:14:25,490 --> 01:14:25,500
that it yep we still need to move fast
 

3861
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:27,110
that it yep we still need to move fast
but we also need to try to figure out

3862
01:14:27,110 --> 01:14:27,120
but we also need to try to figure out
 

3863
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:29,570
but we also need to try to figure out
how to reduce costs that's one of the

3864
01:14:29,570 --> 01:14:29,580
how to reduce costs that's one of the
 

3865
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:31,790
how to reduce costs that's one of the
challenges of of this migration we're

3866
01:14:31,790 --> 01:14:31,800
challenges of of this migration we're
 

3867
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:33,410
challenges of of this migration we're
going through and over the past few

3868
01:14:33,410 --> 01:14:33,420
going through and over the past few
 

3869
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:35,990
going through and over the past few
years challenges to the supply chain I

3870
01:14:35,990 --> 01:14:36,000
years challenges to the supply chain I
 

3871
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,729
years challenges to the supply chain I
mean imagine you've been a part of a

3872
01:14:37,729 --> 01:14:37,739
mean imagine you've been a part of a
 

3873
01:14:37,739 --> 01:14:39,410
mean imagine you've been a part of a
bunch of stressful meetings yeah things

3874
01:14:39,410 --> 01:14:39,420
bunch of stressful meetings yeah things
 

3875
01:14:39,420 --> 01:14:42,770
bunch of stressful meetings yeah things
got more expensive and harder to get and

3876
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:42,780
got more expensive and harder to get and
 

3877
01:14:42,780 --> 01:14:44,870
got more expensive and harder to get and
yeah so it's it's all been a challenge

3878
01:14:44,870 --> 01:14:44,880
yeah so it's it's all been a challenge
 

3879
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,790
yeah so it's it's all been a challenge
is there still room for simplification

3880
01:14:46,790 --> 01:14:46,800
is there still room for simplification
 

3881
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:49,850
is there still room for simplification
oh yeah much more and you know these are

3882
01:14:49,850 --> 01:14:49,860
oh yeah much more and you know these are
 

3883
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:51,470
oh yeah much more and you know these are
really just the first generation of

3884
01:14:51,470 --> 01:14:51,480
really just the first generation of
 

3885
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:53,689
really just the first generation of
these machines we're already thinking

3886
01:14:53,689 --> 01:14:53,699
these machines we're already thinking
 

3887
01:14:53,699 --> 01:14:55,310
these machines we're already thinking
about what the next generation of spots

3888
01:14:55,310 --> 01:14:55,320
about what the next generation of spots
 

3889
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:56,689
about what the next generation of spots
going to look like

3890
01:14:56,689 --> 01:14:56,699
going to look like
 

3891
01:14:56,699 --> 01:14:59,330
going to look like
spot was built as a platform so you

3892
01:14:59,330 --> 01:14:59,340
spot was built as a platform so you
 

3893
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:01,430
spot was built as a platform so you
could put almost any sensor on it and we

3894
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:01,440
could put almost any sensor on it and we
 

3895
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:04,189
could put almost any sensor on it and we
provided data Communications mechanical

3896
01:15:04,189 --> 01:15:04,199
provided data Communications mechanical
 

3897
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:07,850
provided data Communications mechanical
connections uh Power connections

3898
01:15:07,850 --> 01:15:07,860
connections uh Power connections
 

3899
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:10,970
connections uh Power connections
and but for example in the applications

3900
01:15:10,970 --> 01:15:10,980
and but for example in the applications
 

3901
01:15:10,980 --> 01:15:13,010
and but for example in the applications
that we're excited about where you're

3902
01:15:13,010 --> 01:15:13,020
that we're excited about where you're
 

3903
01:15:13,020 --> 01:15:15,350
that we're excited about where you're
you're monitoring these factories for

3904
01:15:15,350 --> 01:15:15,360
you're monitoring these factories for
 

3905
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:16,810
you're monitoring these factories for
their health

3906
01:15:16,810 --> 01:15:16,820
their health
 

3907
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:19,189
their health
there's probably a simpler machine that

3908
01:15:19,189 --> 01:15:19,199
there's probably a simpler machine that
 

3909
01:15:19,199 --> 01:15:21,470
there's probably a simpler machine that
we could build that's really focused on

3910
01:15:21,470 --> 01:15:21,480
we could build that's really focused on
 

3911
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:24,649
we could build that's really focused on
that use case and that's the difference

3912
01:15:24,649 --> 01:15:24,659
that use case and that's the difference
 

3913
01:15:24,659 --> 01:15:27,470
that use case and that's the difference
between the general purpose machine or

3914
01:15:27,470 --> 01:15:27,480
between the general purpose machine or
 

3915
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:29,570
between the general purpose machine or
the platform versus the purpose-built

3916
01:15:29,570 --> 01:15:29,580
the platform versus the purpose-built
 

3917
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:31,610
the platform versus the purpose-built
machine and so even though even in the

3918
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:31,620
machine and so even though even in the
 

3919
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:33,590
machine and so even though even in the
factory we'd still like the robot to do

3920
01:15:33,590 --> 01:15:33,600
factory we'd still like the robot to do
 

3921
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,990
factory we'd still like the robot to do
lots of different tasks if it's if we

3922
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:36,000
lots of different tasks if it's if we
 

3923
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,610
lots of different tasks if it's if we
really knew on day one that we're going

3924
01:15:37,610 --> 01:15:37,620
really knew on day one that we're going
 

3925
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:39,530
really knew on day one that we're going
to be operating in a factory with these

3926
01:15:39,530 --> 01:15:39,540
to be operating in a factory with these
 

3927
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:41,570
to be operating in a factory with these
three sensors in it we would have it all

3928
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:41,580
three sensors in it we would have it all
 

3929
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:43,250
three sensors in it we would have it all
integrated in a package that would be

3930
01:15:43,250 --> 01:15:43,260
integrated in a package that would be
 

3931
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:46,130
integrated in a package that would be
easier more less expensive and more

3932
01:15:46,130 --> 01:15:46,140
easier more less expensive and more
 

3933
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:48,530
easier more less expensive and more
reliable so we're contemplating building

3934
01:15:48,530 --> 01:15:48,540
reliable so we're contemplating building
 

3935
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:50,209
reliable so we're contemplating building
you know a next generation of that

3936
01:15:50,209 --> 01:15:50,219
you know a next generation of that
 

3937
01:15:50,219 --> 01:15:52,729
you know a next generation of that
machine so she mentioned that there's a

3938
01:15:52,729 --> 01:15:52,739
machine so she mentioned that there's a
 

3939
01:15:52,739 --> 01:15:53,570
machine so she mentioned that there's a
spot

3940
01:15:53,570 --> 01:15:53,580
spot
 

3941
01:15:53,580 --> 01:15:55,610
spot
for people who somehow are not familiar

3942
01:15:55,610 --> 01:15:55,620
for people who somehow are not familiar
 

3943
01:15:55,620 --> 01:16:00,350
for people who somehow are not familiar
uh so it's a yellow robotic dog

3944
01:16:00,350 --> 01:16:00,360
uh so it's a yellow robotic dog
 

3945
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:01,850
uh so it's a yellow robotic dog
and

3946
01:16:01,850 --> 01:16:01,860
and
 

3947
01:16:01,860 --> 01:16:03,649

videos it also has gained an arm

3950
01:16:07,970 --> 01:16:07,980
videos it also has gained an arm
 

3951
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:10,070
videos it also has gained an arm
so what can you say about the arm that

3952
01:16:10,070 --> 01:16:10,080
so what can you say about the arm that
 

3953
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:12,649
so what can you say about the arm that
spot has about the challenges of this

3954
01:16:12,649 --> 01:16:12,659
spot has about the challenges of this
 

3955
01:16:12,659 --> 01:16:13,790
spot has about the challenges of this
design

3956
01:16:13,790 --> 01:16:13,800
design
 

3957
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:17,030
design
and the manufacture of it we think the

3958
01:16:17,030 --> 01:16:17,040
and the manufacture of it we think the
 

3959
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:19,850
and the manufacture of it we think the
future of mobile robots is mobile

3960
01:16:19,850 --> 01:16:19,860
future of mobile robots is mobile
 

3961
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:22,490
future of mobile robots is mobile
manipulation that's where

3962
01:16:22,490 --> 01:16:22,500
manipulation that's where
 

3963
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:24,709
manipulation that's where
you know in the past 10 years

3964
01:16:24,709 --> 01:16:24,719
you know in the past 10 years
 

3965
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:26,450
you know in the past 10 years
it was getting Mobility to work getting

3966
01:16:26,450 --> 01:16:26,460
it was getting Mobility to work getting
 

3967
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:28,310
it was getting Mobility to work getting
the legged look emotional work if you

3968
01:16:28,310 --> 01:16:28,320
the legged look emotional work if you
 

3969
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:29,990
the legged look emotional work if you
ask what's the hard problem in the next

3970
01:16:29,990 --> 01:16:30,000
ask what's the hard problem in the next
 

3971
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:30,950
ask what's the hard problem in the next
10 years

3972
01:16:30,950 --> 01:16:30,960
10 years
 

3973
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:33,709
10 years
it's getting a mobile robot to do useful

3974
01:16:33,709 --> 01:16:33,719
it's getting a mobile robot to do useful
 

3975
01:16:33,719 --> 01:16:35,209
it's getting a mobile robot to do useful
manipulation for you

3976
01:16:35,209 --> 01:16:35,219
manipulation for you
 

3977
01:16:35,219 --> 01:16:38,350
manipulation for you
and so we wanted spot to have an arm to

3978
01:16:38,350 --> 01:16:38,360
and so we wanted spot to have an arm to
 

3979
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:41,930
and so we wanted spot to have an arm to
experiment with those problems

3980
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:41,940
experiment with those problems
 

3981
01:16:41,940 --> 01:16:44,870
experiment with those problems
um and the arm is

3982
01:16:44,870 --> 01:16:44,880
um and the arm is
 

3983
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:45,530
um and the arm is
um

3984
01:16:45,530 --> 01:16:45,540
um
 

3985
01:16:45,540 --> 01:16:47,770
um
almost as complex as the robot itself

3986
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:47,780
almost as complex as the robot itself
 

3987
01:16:47,780 --> 01:16:50,810
almost as complex as the robot itself
you know and uh it's a it's an

3988
01:16:50,810 --> 01:16:50,820
you know and uh it's a it's an
 

3989
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:53,209
you know and uh it's a it's an
attachable payload

3990
01:16:53,209 --> 01:16:53,219
attachable payload
 

3991
01:16:53,219 --> 01:16:55,850
attachable payload
um it has you know several Motors and

3992
01:16:55,850 --> 01:16:55,860
um it has you know several Motors and
 

3993
01:16:55,860 --> 01:16:58,370
um it has you know several Motors and
actuators and sensors it has a camera in

3994
01:16:58,370 --> 01:16:58,380
actuators and sensors it has a camera in
 

3995
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:00,470
actuators and sensors it has a camera in
the end of its hand so you know you can

3996
01:17:00,470 --> 01:17:00,480
the end of its hand so you know you can
 

3997
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:03,110
the end of its hand so you know you can
sort of see something

3998
01:17:03,110 --> 01:17:03,120
sort of see something
 

3999
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:05,450
sort of see something
the and the robot will control the

4000
01:17:05,450 --> 01:17:05,460
the and the robot will control the
 

4001
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:07,310
the and the robot will control the
motion of its hand to go pick it up

4002
01:17:07,310 --> 01:17:07,320
motion of its hand to go pick it up
 

4003
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:09,229
motion of its hand to go pick it up
autonomously so in the same way the

4004
01:17:09,229 --> 01:17:09,239
autonomously so in the same way the
 

4005
01:17:09,239 --> 01:17:12,229
autonomously so in the same way the
robot walks and balances managing its

4006
01:17:12,229 --> 01:17:12,239
robot walks and balances managing its
 

4007
01:17:12,239 --> 01:17:13,910
robot walks and balances managing its
own foot placement to stay balanced we

4008
01:17:13,910 --> 01:17:13,920
own foot placement to stay balanced we
 

4009
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:16,610
own foot placement to stay balanced we
want manipulation to be mostly

4010
01:17:16,610 --> 01:17:16,620
want manipulation to be mostly
 

4011
01:17:16,620 --> 01:17:18,649
want manipulation to be mostly
autonomous where the robot you indicate

4012
01:17:18,649 --> 01:17:18,659
autonomous where the robot you indicate
 

4013
01:17:18,659 --> 01:17:20,330
autonomous where the robot you indicate
okay go grab that bottle and then the

4014
01:17:20,330 --> 01:17:20,340
okay go grab that bottle and then the
 

4015
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:22,189
okay go grab that bottle and then the
robot will just go do it using the

4016
01:17:22,189 --> 01:17:22,199
robot will just go do it using the
 

4017
01:17:22,199 --> 01:17:23,870
robot will just go do it using the
camera in its hand and then sort of

4018
01:17:23,870 --> 01:17:23,880
camera in its hand and then sort of
 

4019
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:27,410
camera in its hand and then sort of
closing in on that um the grasp

4020
01:17:27,410 --> 01:17:27,420
closing in on that um the grasp
 

4021
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:29,209
closing in on that um the grasp
but it's it's a whole nother complex

4022
01:17:29,209 --> 01:17:29,219
but it's it's a whole nother complex
 

4023
01:17:29,219 --> 01:17:32,209
but it's it's a whole nother complex
robot on top of a complex legged robot

4024
01:17:32,209 --> 01:17:32,219
robot on top of a complex legged robot
 

4025
01:17:32,219 --> 01:17:35,510
robot on top of a complex legged robot
and so and of course we made it the hand

4026
01:17:35,510 --> 01:17:35,520
and so and of course we made it the hand
 

4027
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:38,330
and so and of course we made it the hand
look a little like a head you know

4028
01:17:38,330 --> 01:17:38,340
look a little like a head you know
 

4029
01:17:38,340 --> 01:17:41,090
look a little like a head you know
because again we want it to be sort of

4030
01:17:41,090 --> 01:17:41,100
because again we want it to be sort of
 

4031
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:45,169
because again we want it to be sort of
identifiable in the last year a lot of

4032
01:17:45,169 --> 01:17:45,179
identifiable in the last year a lot of
 

4033
01:17:45,179 --> 01:17:47,209
identifiable in the last year a lot of
our sales have been people who already

4034
01:17:47,209 --> 01:17:47,219
our sales have been people who already
 

4035
01:17:47,219 --> 01:17:49,550
our sales have been people who already
have a robot now buying an arm to add to

4036
01:17:49,550 --> 01:17:49,560
have a robot now buying an arm to add to
 

4037
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:53,570
have a robot now buying an arm to add to
that robot oh interesting and so the the

4038
01:17:53,570 --> 01:17:53,580
that robot oh interesting and so the the
 

4039
01:17:53,580 --> 01:17:56,030
that robot oh interesting and so the the
armor is for sale oh yeah oh yeah it's

4040
01:17:56,030 --> 01:17:56,040
armor is for sale oh yeah oh yeah it's
 

4041
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:58,070
armor is for sale oh yeah oh yeah it's
an option what's the what's the

4042
01:17:58,070 --> 01:17:58,080
an option what's the what's the
 

4043
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:00,590
an option what's the what's the
interface like to work with the arm like

4044
01:18:00,590 --> 01:18:00,600
interface like to work with the arm like
 

4045
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:03,290
interface like to work with the arm like
is it pretty so are they designed

4046
01:18:03,290 --> 01:18:03,300
is it pretty so are they designed
 

4047
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:05,810
is it pretty so are they designed
primarily I guess just ask that question

4048
01:18:05,810 --> 01:18:05,820
primarily I guess just ask that question
 

4049
01:18:05,820 --> 01:18:08,390
primarily I guess just ask that question
in general about robots from Boston

4050
01:18:08,390 --> 01:18:08,400
in general about robots from Boston
 

4051
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:10,910
in general about robots from Boston
Dynamics is it designed to be

4052
01:18:10,910 --> 01:18:10,920
Dynamics is it designed to be
 

4053
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:14,270
Dynamics is it designed to be
easily and efficiently operated remotely

4054
01:18:14,270 --> 01:18:14,280
easily and efficiently operated remotely
 

4055
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:17,209
easily and efficiently operated remotely
by a human being or is there also the

4056
01:18:17,209 --> 01:18:17,219
by a human being or is there also the
 

4057
01:18:17,219 --> 01:18:21,229
by a human being or is there also the
capability to push towards autonomy we

4058
01:18:21,229 --> 01:18:21,239
capability to push towards autonomy we
 

4059
01:18:21,239 --> 01:18:22,510
capability to push towards autonomy we
want both

4060
01:18:22,510 --> 01:18:22,520
want both
 

4061
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:25,310
want both
uh in the next version of the software

4062
01:18:25,310 --> 01:18:25,320
uh in the next version of the software
 

4063
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:27,590
uh in the next version of the software
that we release uh which will be version

4064
01:18:27,590 --> 01:18:27,600
that we release uh which will be version
 

4065
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:30,950
that we release uh which will be version
3.3 we're going to offer the ability of

4066
01:18:30,950 --> 01:18:30,960
3.3 we're going to offer the ability of
 

4067
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:33,290
3.3 we're going to offer the ability of
if you have a autonomous mission for the

4068
01:18:33,290 --> 01:18:33,300
if you have a autonomous mission for the
 

4069
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:35,750
if you have a autonomous mission for the
robot we're going to include the option

4070
01:18:35,750 --> 01:18:35,760
robot we're going to include the option
 

4071
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:37,430
robot we're going to include the option
that it can go through a door which

4072
01:18:37,430 --> 01:18:37,440
that it can go through a door which
 

4073
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:38,689
that it can go through a door which
means it's going to have to have an arm

4074
01:18:38,689 --> 01:18:38,699
means it's going to have to have an arm
 

4075
01:18:38,699 --> 01:18:40,070
means it's going to have to have an arm
and it's gonna have to use that arm to

4076
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:40,080
and it's gonna have to use that arm to
 

4077
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:41,270
and it's gonna have to use that arm to
open the door

4078
01:18:41,270 --> 01:18:41,280
open the door
 

4079
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:42,830
open the door
and so that'll be an autonomous

4080
01:18:42,830 --> 01:18:42,840
and so that'll be an autonomous
 

4081
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:45,830
and so that'll be an autonomous
manipulation task that just you can

4082
01:18:45,830 --> 01:18:45,840
manipulation task that just you can
 

4083
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:48,430
manipulation task that just you can
program easily uh with the robot

4084
01:18:48,430 --> 01:18:48,440
program easily uh with the robot
 

4085
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:50,630
program easily uh with the robot
strictly through you know we have a

4086
01:18:50,630 --> 01:18:50,640
strictly through you know we have a
 

4087
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:51,950
strictly through you know we have a
tablet interface

4088
01:18:51,950 --> 01:18:51,960
tablet interface
 

4089
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:53,930
tablet interface
and so on the tablet you know you sort

4090
01:18:53,930 --> 01:18:53,940
and so on the tablet you know you sort
 

4091
01:18:53,940 --> 01:18:56,390
and so on the tablet you know you sort
of see the The View that spot sees you

4092
01:18:56,390 --> 01:18:56,400
of see the The View that spot sees you
 

4093
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:58,970
of see the The View that spot sees you
say there's the door handle you know the

4094
01:18:58,970 --> 01:18:58,980
say there's the door handle you know the
 

4095
01:18:58,980 --> 01:19:00,649
say there's the door handle you know the
hinges are on the left and it opens in

4096
01:19:00,649 --> 01:19:00,659
hinges are on the left and it opens in
 

4097
01:19:00,659 --> 01:19:03,709
hinges are on the left and it opens in
the rest is up to you take care oh so it

4098
01:19:03,709 --> 01:19:03,719
the rest is up to you take care oh so it
 

4099
01:19:03,719 --> 01:19:06,649
the rest is up to you take care oh so it
just takes care of everything yeah so we

4100
01:19:06,649 --> 01:19:06,659
just takes care of everything yeah so we
 

4101
01:19:06,659 --> 01:19:09,709
just takes care of everything yeah so we
we want in for a task like opening doors

4102
01:19:09,709 --> 01:19:09,719
we want in for a task like opening doors
 

4103
01:19:09,719 --> 01:19:11,750
we want in for a task like opening doors
you can automate most of that and we've

4104
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:11,760
you can automate most of that and we've
 

4105
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:14,270
you can automate most of that and we've
automated a few other tasks we had a

4106
01:19:14,270 --> 01:19:14,280
automated a few other tasks we had a
 

4107
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:15,410
automated a few other tasks we had a
customer

4108
01:19:15,410 --> 01:19:15,420
customer
 

4109
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:19,430
customer
who had a high-powered breaker switch

4110
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:19,440
who had a high-powered breaker switch
 

4111
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:21,790
who had a high-powered breaker switch
essentially it's an electric utility

4112
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:21,800
essentially it's an electric utility
 

4113
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:24,649
essentially it's an electric utility
Ontario power generation

4114
01:19:24,649 --> 01:19:24,659
Ontario power generation
 

4115
01:19:24,659 --> 01:19:27,110
Ontario power generation
and they have to when they're going to

4116
01:19:27,110 --> 01:19:27,120
and they have to when they're going to
 

4117
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:28,910
and they have to when they're going to
disconnect you know their power supply

4118
01:19:28,910 --> 01:19:28,920
disconnect you know their power supply
 

4119
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:30,649
disconnect you know their power supply
right that could be a gas generator

4120
01:19:30,649 --> 01:19:30,659
right that could be a gas generator
 

4121
01:19:30,659 --> 01:19:32,390
right that could be a gas generator
could be a nuclear power plant you know

4122
01:19:32,390 --> 01:19:32,400
could be a nuclear power plant you know
 

4123
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:33,890
could be a nuclear power plant you know
from the grid you have to disconnect

4124
01:19:33,890 --> 01:19:33,900
from the grid you have to disconnect
 

4125
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:36,350
from the grid you have to disconnect
this breaker switch as you can imagine

4126
01:19:36,350 --> 01:19:36,360
this breaker switch as you can imagine
 

4127
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:38,810
this breaker switch as you can imagine
there's you know hundreds or thousands

4128
01:19:38,810 --> 01:19:38,820
there's you know hundreds or thousands
 

4129
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:41,030
there's you know hundreds or thousands
of amps and volts involved in this

4130
01:19:41,030 --> 01:19:41,040
of amps and volts involved in this
 

4131
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:42,290
of amps and volts involved in this
breaker switch

4132
01:19:42,290 --> 01:19:42,300
breaker switch
 

4133
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:43,850
breaker switch
and it's a dangerous event because

4134
01:19:43,850 --> 01:19:43,860
and it's a dangerous event because
 

4135
01:19:43,860 --> 01:19:45,350
and it's a dangerous event because
occasionally you'll get what's called an

4136
01:19:45,350 --> 01:19:45,360
occasionally you'll get what's called an
 

4137
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,410
occasionally you'll get what's called an
arc flash as you just do this disconnect

4138
01:19:47,410 --> 01:19:47,420
arc flash as you just do this disconnect
 

4139
01:19:47,420 --> 01:19:50,870
arc flash as you just do this disconnect
the power the Sparks jump across and

4140
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:50,880
the power the Sparks jump across and
 

4141
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:53,149
the power the Sparks jump across and
people die doing this

4142
01:19:53,149 --> 01:19:53,159
people die doing this
 

4143
01:19:53,159 --> 01:19:56,209
people die doing this
and so uh Ontario power generation used

4144
01:19:56,209 --> 01:19:56,219
and so uh Ontario power generation used
 

4145
01:19:56,219 --> 01:19:58,970
and so uh Ontario power generation used
our spot and and the arm through the

4146
01:19:58,970 --> 01:19:58,980
our spot and and the arm through the
 

4147
01:19:58,980 --> 01:20:02,270
our spot and and the arm through the
interface to to operate this this

4148
01:20:02,270 --> 01:20:02,280
interface to to operate this this
 

4149
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:03,770
interface to to operate this this
disconnect

4150
01:20:03,770 --> 01:20:03,780
disconnect
 

4151
01:20:03,780 --> 01:20:05,530
disconnect
um that's right in an interactive way

4152
01:20:05,530 --> 01:20:05,540
um that's right in an interactive way
 

4153
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:07,850
um that's right in an interactive way
and they showed it to us

4154
01:20:07,850 --> 01:20:07,860
and they showed it to us
 

4155
01:20:07,860 --> 01:20:10,610
and they showed it to us
and we were so excited about it and said

4156
01:20:10,610 --> 01:20:10,620
and we were so excited about it and said
 

4157
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:12,290
and we were so excited about it and said
you know I bet we can automate that task

4158
01:20:12,290 --> 01:20:12,300
you know I bet we can automate that task
 

4159
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:14,750
you know I bet we can automate that task
and so we we got some examples of that

4160
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:14,760
and so we we got some examples of that
 

4161
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:17,570
and so we we got some examples of that
breaker switch and I believe in the next

4162
01:20:17,570 --> 01:20:17,580
breaker switch and I believe in the next
 

4163
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:19,130
breaker switch and I believe in the next
generation of the software now we're

4164
01:20:19,130 --> 01:20:19,140
generation of the software now we're
 

4165
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:20,870
generation of the software now we're
going to deliver back to Ontario power

4166
01:20:20,870 --> 01:20:20,880
going to deliver back to Ontario power
 

4167
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:22,370
going to deliver back to Ontario power
generation they're going to be able to

4168
01:20:22,370 --> 01:20:22,380
generation they're going to be able to
 

4169
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:23,990
generation they're going to be able to
just point the robot

4170
01:20:23,990 --> 01:20:24,000
just point the robot
 

4171
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,050
just point the robot
at that breaker so we have to indicate

4172
01:20:27,050 --> 01:20:27,060
at that breaker so we have to indicate
 

4173
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:29,450
at that breaker so we have to indicate
that's the switch there's sort of two

4174
01:20:29,450 --> 01:20:29,460
that's the switch there's sort of two
 

4175
01:20:29,460 --> 01:20:31,550
that's the switch there's sort of two
actions you have to do you have to flip

4176
01:20:31,550 --> 01:20:31,560
actions you have to do you have to flip
 

4177
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:34,130
actions you have to do you have to flip
up this little cover press a button then

4178
01:20:34,130 --> 01:20:34,140
up this little cover press a button then
 

4179
01:20:34,140 --> 01:20:37,310
up this little cover press a button then
get a ratchet stick it in to a socket

4180
01:20:37,310 --> 01:20:37,320
get a ratchet stick it in to a socket
 

4181
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:40,790
get a ratchet stick it in to a socket
and literally unscrew this giant breaker

4182
01:20:40,790 --> 01:20:40,800
and literally unscrew this giant breaker
 

4183
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,169
and literally unscrew this giant breaker
switch so there's a bunch of different

4184
01:20:42,169 --> 01:20:42,179
switch so there's a bunch of different
 

4185
01:20:42,179 --> 01:20:44,990
switch so there's a bunch of different
tasks and we basically automated them so

4186
01:20:44,990 --> 01:20:45,000
tasks and we basically automated them so
 

4187
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,669
tasks and we basically automated them so
that the human says okay there's the

4188
01:20:46,669 --> 01:20:46,679
that the human says okay there's the
 

4189
01:20:46,679 --> 01:20:49,189
that the human says okay there's the
switch go do that part

4190
01:20:49,189 --> 01:20:49,199
switch go do that part
 

4191
01:20:49,199 --> 01:20:51,530
switch go do that part
that right there is the socket where

4192
01:20:51,530 --> 01:20:51,540
that right there is the socket where
 

4193
01:20:51,540 --> 01:20:52,790
that right there is the socket where
you're going to put your tool and you're

4194
01:20:52,790 --> 01:20:52,800
you're going to put your tool and you're
 

4195
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:54,770
you're going to put your tool and you're
going to open it up and so you can

4196
01:20:54,770 --> 01:20:54,780
going to open it up and so you can
 

4197
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:57,229
going to open it up and so you can
remotely sort of indicate this on the a

4198
01:20:57,229 --> 01:20:57,239
remotely sort of indicate this on the a
 

4199
01:20:57,239 --> 01:20:59,330
remotely sort of indicate this on the a
tablet and then the robot just does

4200
01:20:59,330 --> 01:20:59,340
tablet and then the robot just does
 

4201
01:20:59,340 --> 01:21:01,070
tablet and then the robot just does
everything in between and it does

4202
01:21:01,070 --> 01:21:01,080
everything in between and it does
 

4203
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:02,630
everything in between and it does
everything all the coordinated movement

4204
01:21:02,630 --> 01:21:02,640
everything all the coordinated movement
 

4205
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:04,130
everything all the coordinated movement
of all the different actuators that

4206
01:21:04,130 --> 01:21:04,140
of all the different actuators that
 

4207
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:05,990
of all the different actuators that
include the body and it maintains its

4208
01:21:05,990 --> 01:21:06,000
include the body and it maintains its
 

4209
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,450
include the body and it maintains its
balance it it walks itself you know into

4210
01:21:08,450 --> 01:21:08,460
balance it it walks itself you know into
 

4211
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:11,750
balance it it walks itself you know into
position so it's within reach and the

4212
01:21:11,750 --> 01:21:11,760
position so it's within reach and the
 

4213
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:13,669
position so it's within reach and the
arm is in a position where it can do the

4214
01:21:13,669 --> 01:21:13,679
arm is in a position where it can do the
 

4215
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:16,910
arm is in a position where it can do the
whole task so it manages uh the whole

4216
01:21:16,910 --> 01:21:16,920
whole task so it manages uh the whole
 

4217
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:19,669
whole task so it manages uh the whole
body so how does one become a big enough

4218
01:21:19,669 --> 01:21:19,679
body so how does one become a big enough
 

4219
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:22,250
body so how does one become a big enough
customer to request features because I

4220
01:21:22,250 --> 01:21:22,260
customer to request features because I
 

4221
01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:24,830
customer to request features because I
personally want a robot that gets me

4222
01:21:24,830 --> 01:21:24,840
personally want a robot that gets me
 

4223

beer

4224
01:21:26,149 --> 01:21:26,159
beer
 

4225
01:21:26,159 --> 01:21:28,430
beer
I mean that has to be like one of the

01:21:28,430 --> 01:21:28,440
I mean that has to be like one of the
 

4227
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:29,990
I mean that has to be like one of the
most requests I suppose in the

4228
01:21:29,990 --> 01:21:30,000
most requests I suppose in the
 

4229
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,970
most requests I suppose in the
industrial setting that's uh a

4230
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:31,980
industrial setting that's uh a
 

4231
01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:34,970
industrial setting that's uh a
non-alcoholic beverage

4232
01:21:34,970 --> 01:21:34,980
non-alcoholic beverage
 

4233
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:37,070
non-alcoholic beverage
um of picking up objects and bringing

customers who have challenging problems

4238
01:21:41,030 --> 01:21:41,040
customers who have challenging problems
 

4239
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:43,130
customers who have challenging problems
like this and and this one in particular

4240
01:21:43,130 --> 01:21:43,140
like this and and this one in particular
 

4241
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:44,870
like this and and this one in particular
because we felt like

4242
01:21:44,870 --> 01:21:44,880
because we felt like
 

4243
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:47,209
because we felt like
what they were doing a it was a safety

4244
01:21:47,209 --> 01:21:47,219
what they were doing a it was a safety
 

4245
01:21:47,219 --> 01:21:50,810
what they were doing a it was a safety
feature B we saw that the robot could do

4246
01:21:50,810 --> 01:21:50,820
feature B we saw that the robot could do
 

4247
01:21:50,820 --> 01:21:53,209
feature B we saw that the robot could do
it because they they tele operated it

4248
01:21:53,209 --> 01:21:53,219
it because they they tele operated it
 

4249
01:21:53,219 --> 01:21:54,470
it because they they tele operated it
the first time probably took him an hour

4250
01:21:54,470 --> 01:21:54,480
the first time probably took him an hour
 

4251
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,330
the first time probably took him an hour
to do it the first time right but the

4252
01:21:56,330 --> 01:21:56,340
to do it the first time right but the
 

4253
01:21:56,340 --> 01:21:58,610
to do it the first time right but the
robot was clearly capable and we thought

4254
01:21:58,610 --> 01:21:58,620
robot was clearly capable and we thought
 

4255
01:21:58,620 --> 01:22:00,530
robot was clearly capable and we thought
oh this is a great problem for us to

4256
01:22:00,530 --> 01:22:00,540
oh this is a great problem for us to
 

4257
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:03,050
oh this is a great problem for us to
work on to figure out how to automate a

4258
01:22:03,050 --> 01:22:03,060
work on to figure out how to automate a
 

4259
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:04,790
work on to figure out how to automate a
manipulation task and so we took it on

4260
01:22:04,790 --> 01:22:04,800
manipulation task and so we took it on
 

4261
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:07,130
manipulation task and so we took it on
not not because we were going to make a

4262
01:22:07,130 --> 01:22:07,140
not not because we were going to make a
 

4263
01:22:07,140 --> 01:22:08,450
not not because we were going to make a
bunch of money from it and selling the

4264
01:22:08,450 --> 01:22:08,460
bunch of money from it and selling the
 

4265
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:10,910
bunch of money from it and selling the
robot back to them but because it

4266
01:22:10,910 --> 01:22:10,920
robot back to them but because it
 

4267
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:13,610
robot back to them but because it
motivated us to go solve what we saw as

4268
01:22:13,610 --> 01:22:13,620
motivated us to go solve what we saw as
 

4269
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:15,410
motivated us to go solve what we saw as
the next logical step

4270
01:22:15,410 --> 01:22:15,420
the next logical step
 

4271
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:18,649
the next logical step
but many of our customers in fact uh we

4272
01:22:18,649 --> 01:22:18,659
but many of our customers in fact uh we
 

4273
01:22:18,659 --> 01:22:21,229
but many of our customers in fact uh we
we try to our bigger customers who

4274
01:22:21,229 --> 01:22:21,239
we try to our bigger customers who
 

4275
01:22:21,239 --> 01:22:22,970
we try to our bigger customers who
typically ones who are going to run a

4276
01:22:22,970 --> 01:22:22,980
typically ones who are going to run a
 

4277
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:24,530
typically ones who are going to run a
utility or a factory or something like

4278
01:22:24,530 --> 01:22:24,540
utility or a factory or something like
 

4279
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:25,550
utility or a factory or something like
that

4280
01:22:25,550 --> 01:22:25,560
that
 

4281
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:27,470
that
we take that kind of direction from them

4282
01:22:27,470 --> 01:22:27,480
we take that kind of direction from them
 

4283
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:28,790
we take that kind of direction from them
and if they're especially if they're

4284
01:22:28,790 --> 01:22:28,800
and if they're especially if they're
 

4285
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:31,310
and if they're especially if they're
going to buy 10 or 20 or 30 robots and

4286
01:22:31,310 --> 01:22:31,320
going to buy 10 or 20 or 30 robots and
 

4287
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:33,350
going to buy 10 or 20 or 30 robots and
they say I really needed to do this well

4288
01:22:33,350 --> 01:22:33,360
they say I really needed to do this well
 

4289
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:34,910
they say I really needed to do this well
that's exactly the right kind of problem

4290
01:22:34,910 --> 01:22:34,920
that's exactly the right kind of problem
 

4291
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:37,610
that's exactly the right kind of problem
that we want to be working on and and so

4292
01:22:37,610 --> 01:22:37,620
that we want to be working on and and so
 

4293
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:40,790
that we want to be working on and and so

01:22:46,130 --> 01:22:46,140
I think it's fair to say it's
 

4301
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:47,990
I think it's fair to say it's
notoriously difficult to make a lot of

4302
01:22:47,990 --> 01:22:48,000
notoriously difficult to make a lot of
 

4303
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,970
notoriously difficult to make a lot of
money as a robotics company

4304
01:22:49,970 --> 01:22:49,980
money as a robotics company
 

4305
01:22:49,980 --> 01:22:53,630
money as a robotics company
how can you make money as a robotics

4306
01:22:53,630 --> 01:22:53,640
how can you make money as a robotics
 

4307
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:56,450
how can you make money as a robotics
company can you speak to that it seems

4308
01:22:56,450 --> 01:22:56,460
company can you speak to that it seems
 

4309
01:22:56,460 --> 01:23:00,290
company can you speak to that it seems
that a lot of Robotics companies fail

4310
01:23:00,290 --> 01:23:00,300
that a lot of Robotics companies fail
 

4311
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:02,630
that a lot of Robotics companies fail
um it's difficult to build robots it's

4312
01:23:02,630 --> 01:23:02,640
um it's difficult to build robots it's
 

4313
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:05,390
um it's difficult to build robots it's
difficult to build robots at a low

4314
01:23:05,390 --> 01:23:05,400
difficult to build robots at a low
 

4315
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:07,430
difficult to build robots at a low
enough cost where customers even the

4316
01:23:07,430 --> 01:23:07,440
enough cost where customers even the
 

4317
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:08,930
enough cost where customers even the
industrial setting want to purchase them

4318
01:23:08,930 --> 01:23:08,940
industrial setting want to purchase them
 

4319
01:23:08,940 --> 01:23:11,030
industrial setting want to purchase them
and it's difficult to build robots that

4320
01:23:11,030 --> 01:23:11,040
and it's difficult to build robots that
 

4321
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:13,970
and it's difficult to build robots that
are useful sufficiently useful so what

4322
01:23:13,970 --> 01:23:13,980
are useful sufficiently useful so what
 

4323
01:23:13,980 --> 01:23:15,830
are useful sufficiently useful so what
can you speak to and Boston Dynamics has

4324
01:23:15,830 --> 01:23:15,840
can you speak to and Boston Dynamics has
 

4325
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:16,729
can you speak to and Boston Dynamics has
been

4326
01:23:16,729 --> 01:23:16,739
been
 

4327
01:23:16,739 --> 01:23:19,610
been
uh successful for many years of finding

4328
01:23:19,610 --> 01:23:19,620
uh successful for many years of finding
 

4329
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:21,890
uh successful for many years of finding
a way to make money well in the early

4330
01:23:21,890 --> 01:23:21,900
a way to make money well in the early
 

4331
01:23:21,900 --> 01:23:23,630
a way to make money well in the early
days of course you know the money we

4332
01:23:23,630 --> 01:23:23,640
days of course you know the money we
 

4333
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:26,270
days of course you know the money we
made was from doing contract r d work

4334
01:23:26,270 --> 01:23:26,280
made was from doing contract r d work
 

4335
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:28,310
made was from doing contract r d work
and we made money

4336
01:23:28,310 --> 01:23:28,320
and we made money
 

4337
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:30,290
and we made money
but you know we weren't growing and we

4338
01:23:30,290 --> 01:23:30,300
but you know we weren't growing and we
 

4339
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:31,729
but you know we weren't growing and we
weren't selling a product

4340
01:23:31,729 --> 01:23:31,739
weren't selling a product
 

4341
01:23:31,739 --> 01:23:33,950
weren't selling a product
and then we went through several owners

4342
01:23:33,950 --> 01:23:33,960
and then we went through several owners
 

4343
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:35,630
and then we went through several owners
who

4344
01:23:35,630 --> 01:23:35,640
who
 

4345
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:38,990
who
you know had a vision of not only

4346
01:23:38,990 --> 01:23:39,000
you know had a vision of not only
 

4347
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,910
you know had a vision of not only
developing advanced technology but

4348
01:23:40,910 --> 01:23:40,920
developing advanced technology but
 

4349
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:43,070
developing advanced technology but
eventually developing products and so

4350
01:23:43,070 --> 01:23:43,080
eventually developing products and so
 

4351
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:45,290
eventually developing products and so
both you know Google and SoftBank and

4352
01:23:45,290 --> 01:23:45,300
both you know Google and SoftBank and
 

4353
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:46,550
both you know Google and SoftBank and
now Hyundai

4354
01:23:46,550 --> 01:23:46,560
now Hyundai
 

4355
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,770
now Hyundai
you know had that vision and were

4356
01:23:48,770 --> 01:23:48,780
you know had that vision and were
 

4357
01:23:48,780 --> 01:23:52,250
you know had that vision and were
willing to you know provide that in

4358
01:23:52,250 --> 01:23:52,260
willing to you know provide that in
 

4359
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:54,830
willing to you know provide that in
investment

4360
01:23:54,830 --> 01:23:54,840
investment
 

4361
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:57,590
investment
um now our discipline is that we need to

4362
01:23:57,590 --> 01:23:57,600
um now our discipline is that we need to
 

4363
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:00,530
um now our discipline is that we need to
go find applications that are broad

4364
01:24:00,530 --> 01:24:00,540
go find applications that are broad
 

4365
01:24:00,540 --> 01:24:02,450
go find applications that are broad
enough that you could imagine selling

4366
01:24:02,450 --> 01:24:02,460
enough that you could imagine selling
 

4367
01:24:02,460 --> 01:24:04,310
enough that you could imagine selling
thousands of robots because it doesn't

4368
01:24:04,310 --> 01:24:04,320
thousands of robots because it doesn't
 

4369
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:06,290
thousands of robots because it doesn't
work if you don't sell thousands or tens

4370
01:24:06,290 --> 01:24:06,300
work if you don't sell thousands or tens
 

4371
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:07,850
work if you don't sell thousands or tens
of thousands of robots if you only sell

4372
01:24:07,850 --> 01:24:07,860
of thousands of robots if you only sell
 

4373
01:24:07,860 --> 01:24:09,169
of thousands of robots if you only sell
hundreds

4374
01:24:09,169 --> 01:24:09,179
hundreds
 

4375
01:24:09,179 --> 01:24:11,209
hundreds
you will commercially fail and that's

4376
01:24:11,209 --> 01:24:11,219
you will commercially fail and that's
 

4377
01:24:11,219 --> 01:24:13,130
you will commercially fail and that's
where most of the small robot companies

4378
01:24:13,130 --> 01:24:13,140
where most of the small robot companies
 

4379
01:24:13,140 --> 01:24:15,530
where most of the small robot companies
have died

4380
01:24:15,530 --> 01:24:15,540
have died
 

4381
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:17,330
have died
um

4382
01:24:17,330 --> 01:24:17,340
um
 

4383
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:20,450
um
and and that's a challenge because

4384
01:24:20,450 --> 01:24:20,460
and and that's a challenge because
 

4385
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:22,250
and and that's a challenge because
you know a you need to field the robots

4386
01:24:22,250 --> 01:24:22,260
you know a you need to field the robots
 

4387
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:23,870
you know a you need to field the robots
they need to start to become reli

4388
01:24:23,870 --> 01:24:23,880
they need to start to become reli
 

4389
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:25,910
they need to start to become reli
reliable and as we as we've said that

4390
01:24:25,910 --> 01:24:25,920
reliable and as we as we've said that
 

4391
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:29,090
reliable and as we as we've said that
takes time and investment to get there

4392
01:24:29,090 --> 01:24:29,100
takes time and investment to get there
 

4393
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:31,310
takes time and investment to get there
and so it really does take Visionary

4394
01:24:31,310 --> 01:24:31,320
and so it really does take Visionary
 

4395
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:33,649
and so it really does take Visionary
investment to get there but we we

4396
01:24:33,649 --> 01:24:33,659
investment to get there but we we
 

4397
01:24:33,659 --> 01:24:35,890
investment to get there but we we
believe that we are going to make money

4398
01:24:35,890 --> 01:24:35,900
believe that we are going to make money
 

4399
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:40,370
believe that we are going to make money
in this uh industrial monitoring space

4400
01:24:40,370 --> 01:24:40,380
in this uh industrial monitoring space
 

4401
01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:42,709
in this uh industrial monitoring space
because

4402
01:24:42,709 --> 01:24:42,719
because
 

4403
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:46,130
because
you know if uh if a chip Fab if the line

4404
01:24:46,130 --> 01:24:46,140
you know if uh if a chip Fab if the line
 

4405
01:24:46,140 --> 01:24:48,530
you know if uh if a chip Fab if the line
goes down because a vacuum pump failed

4406
01:24:48,530 --> 01:24:48,540
goes down because a vacuum pump failed
 

4407
01:24:48,540 --> 01:24:50,630
goes down because a vacuum pump failed
someplace that can be in a very

4408
01:24:50,630 --> 01:24:50,640
someplace that can be in a very
 

4409
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:52,370
someplace that can be in a very
expensive process it can be a million

4410
01:24:52,370 --> 01:24:52,380
expensive process it can be a million
 

4411
01:24:52,380 --> 01:24:54,830
expensive process it can be a million
dollars a day in Lost production maybe

4412
01:24:54,830 --> 01:24:54,840
dollars a day in Lost production maybe
 

4413
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:56,209
dollars a day in Lost production maybe
you have to throw away some of the

4414
01:24:56,209 --> 01:24:56,219
you have to throw away some of the
 

4415
01:24:56,219 --> 01:24:57,890
you have to throw away some of the
product along the way

4416
01:24:57,890 --> 01:24:57,900
product along the way
 

4417
01:24:57,900 --> 01:25:00,590
product along the way
and so the robot if you can prevent that

4418
01:25:00,590 --> 01:25:00,600
and so the robot if you can prevent that
 

4419
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:04,310
and so the robot if you can prevent that
by inspecting the factory every single

4420
01:25:04,310 --> 01:25:04,320
by inspecting the factory every single
 

4421

There's real return on investment there
 

4425
01:25:09,719 --> 01:25:12,290
There's real return on investment there
but there needs to be a critical mass of

but there needs to be a critical mass of
 

4427
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:14,810
but there needs to be a critical mass of
this task and and we're focusing on a

few
 

4431
01:25:15,719 --> 01:25:18,110
few
that we believe are

01:25:18,110 --> 01:25:18,120
that we believe are
 

4433
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:22,010
that we believe are
ubiquitous in the industrial production

4434

ubiquitous in the industrial production
 

4435
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:23,990
ubiquitous in the industrial production
environment and that's using a thermal

robot

4464
01:25:57,410 --> 01:25:57,420
robot
 

4465
01:25:57,420 --> 01:25:59,270
robot
can be applied in all of these

4466
01:25:59,270 --> 01:25:59,280
can be applied in all of these
 

4467
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:00,590
can be applied in all of these
industries

4468
01:26:00,590 --> 01:26:00,600
industries
 

4469
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:04,430
industries
and and as I said we have about actually

4470
01:26:04,430 --> 01:26:04,440
and and as I said we have about actually
 

4471
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:07,669
and and as I said we have about actually
it's 1100 spots out now to really get uh

4472
01:26:07,669 --> 01:26:07,679
it's 1100 spots out now to really get uh
 

4473
01:26:07,679 --> 01:26:09,470
it's 1100 spots out now to really get uh
you know profitability we need to be at

4474
01:26:09,470 --> 01:26:09,480
you know profitability we need to be at
 

4475
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:12,169
you know profitability we need to be at
a thousand a year maybe maybe 1500 a

4476
01:26:12,169 --> 01:26:12,179
a thousand a year maybe maybe 1500 a
 

4477
01:26:12,179 --> 01:26:14,149
a thousand a year maybe maybe 1500 a
year you know for that sort of part of

4478
01:26:14,149 --> 01:26:14,159
year you know for that sort of part of
 

4479
01:26:14,159 --> 01:26:17,750
year you know for that sort of part of
the business so it still needs to grow

4480
01:26:17,750 --> 01:26:17,760
the business so it still needs to grow
 

4481
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:19,970
the business so it still needs to grow
um but but we're on a good path so I

4482
01:26:19,970 --> 01:26:19,980
um but but we're on a good path so I
 

4483
01:26:19,980 --> 01:26:21,950
um but but we're on a good path so I
think that's totally achievable so the

4484
01:26:21,950 --> 01:26:21,960
think that's totally achievable so the
 

4485
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:24,169
think that's totally achievable so the
application should require the crossing

4486
01:26:24,169 --> 01:26:24,179
application should require the crossing
 

4487
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:26,149
application should require the crossing
that thousand robot barrier it really

4488
01:26:26,149 --> 01:26:26,159
that thousand robot barrier it really
 

4489
01:26:26,159 --> 01:26:28,729
that thousand robot barrier it really
should yeah I want to mention you know

4490
01:26:28,729 --> 01:26:28,739
should yeah I want to mention you know
 

4491
01:26:28,739 --> 01:26:31,669
should yeah I want to mention you know
our second robot uh stretch yeah tell me

4492
01:26:31,669 --> 01:26:31,679
our second robot uh stretch yeah tell me
 

4493
01:26:31,679 --> 01:26:33,530
our second robot uh stretch yeah tell me
about stretch what's stretch who stretch

4494
01:26:33,530 --> 01:26:33,540
about stretch what's stretch who stretch
 

4495
01:26:33,540 --> 01:26:35,990
about stretch what's stretch who stretch
stretch started differently than spot

4496
01:26:35,990 --> 01:26:36,000
stretch started differently than spot
 

4497
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,090
stretch started differently than spot
you know spot we built because we had

4498
01:26:38,090 --> 01:26:38,100
you know spot we built because we had
 

4499
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:39,770
you know spot we built because we had
Decades of experience building

4500
01:26:39,770 --> 01:26:39,780
Decades of experience building
 

4501
01:26:39,780 --> 01:26:41,990
Decades of experience building
quadrupeds we just we had it in our

4502
01:26:41,990 --> 01:26:42,000
quadrupeds we just we had it in our
 

4503
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,910
quadrupeds we just we had it in our
blood we had to build a quadruped

4504
01:26:43,910 --> 01:26:43,920
blood we had to build a quadruped
 

4505
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:45,649
blood we had to build a quadruped
product but we had to go figure out what

4506
01:26:45,649 --> 01:26:45,659
product but we had to go figure out what
 

4507
01:26:45,659 --> 01:26:47,689
product but we had to go figure out what
the application was and we actually

4508
01:26:47,689 --> 01:26:47,699
the application was and we actually
 

4509
01:26:47,699 --> 01:26:50,709
the application was and we actually
discovered this this Factory Patrol

4510
01:26:50,709 --> 01:26:50,719
discovered this this Factory Patrol
 

4511
01:26:50,719 --> 01:26:53,570
discovered this this Factory Patrol
application uh basically preventative

4512
01:26:53,570 --> 01:26:53,580
application uh basically preventative
 

4513
01:26:53,580 --> 01:26:55,669
application uh basically preventative
maintenance by seeing what our customers

4514
01:26:55,669 --> 01:26:55,679
maintenance by seeing what our customers
 

4515
01:26:55,679 --> 01:26:57,169
maintenance by seeing what our customers
did with it

4516
01:26:57,169 --> 01:26:57,179
did with it
 

4517
01:26:57,179 --> 01:26:59,209
did with it
stretch is very different we started

4518
01:26:59,209 --> 01:26:59,219
stretch is very different we started
 

4519
01:26:59,219 --> 01:27:02,270
stretch is very different we started
knowing that there was warehouses all

4520
01:27:02,270 --> 01:27:02,280
knowing that there was warehouses all
 

4521
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:04,430
knowing that there was warehouses all
over the world there's shipping

4522
01:27:04,430 --> 01:27:04,440
over the world there's shipping
 

4523
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:06,590
over the world there's shipping
containers moving all around the world

4524
01:27:06,590 --> 01:27:06,600
containers moving all around the world
 

4525
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:08,450
containers moving all around the world
full of boxes that are mostly being

4526
01:27:08,450 --> 01:27:08,460
full of boxes that are mostly being
 

4527
01:27:08,460 --> 01:27:09,970
full of boxes that are mostly being
moved by hand

4528
01:27:09,970 --> 01:27:09,980
moved by hand
 

4529
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:12,169
moved by hand
by some estimates we think there's a

4530
01:27:12,169 --> 01:27:12,179
by some estimates we think there's a
 

4531
01:27:12,179 --> 01:27:15,290
by some estimates we think there's a
trillion boxes cardboard boxes shipped

4532
01:27:15,290 --> 01:27:15,300
trillion boxes cardboard boxes shipped
 

4533
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:16,610
trillion boxes cardboard boxes shipped
around the world each year and a lot of

4534
01:27:16,610 --> 01:27:16,620
around the world each year and a lot of
 

4535
01:27:16,620 --> 01:27:18,110
around the world each year and a lot of
it's done manually

4536
01:27:18,110 --> 01:27:18,120
it's done manually
 

4537
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:20,390
it's done manually
it became clear early on

4538
01:27:20,390 --> 01:27:20,400
it became clear early on
 

4539
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,310
it became clear early on
that there was an opportunity for a

4540
01:27:22,310 --> 01:27:22,320
that there was an opportunity for a
 

4541
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:23,930
that there was an opportunity for a
mobile robot in here to move boxes

4542
01:27:23,930 --> 01:27:23,940
mobile robot in here to move boxes
 

4543
01:27:23,940 --> 01:27:24,770
mobile robot in here to move boxes
around

4544
01:27:24,770 --> 01:27:24,780
around
 

4545
01:27:24,780 --> 01:27:26,870
around
and the commercial experience has been

4546
01:27:26,870 --> 01:27:26,880
and the commercial experience has been
 

4547
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:29,450
and the commercial experience has been
very different between stretch and with

4548
01:27:29,450 --> 01:27:29,460
very different between stretch and with
 

4549
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:30,290
very different between stretch and with
spot

01:28:02,570 --> 01:28:02,580
customers all who've already agreed in
 

4581
01:28:02,580 --> 01:28:05,330
customers all who've already agreed in
advance to buy between 10 and 20 robots

4582
01:28:05,330 --> 01:28:05,340
advance to buy between 10 and 20 robots
 

4583
01:28:05,340 --> 01:28:07,010
advance to buy between 10 and 20 robots
and so we've already got commitments for

4584
01:28:07,010 --> 01:28:07,020
and so we've already got commitments for
 

4585
01:28:07,020 --> 01:28:08,330
and so we've already got commitments for
you know a couple hundred of these

4586
01:28:08,330 --> 01:28:08,340
you know a couple hundred of these
 

4587
01:28:08,340 --> 01:28:09,950
you know a couple hundred of these
robots

4588
01:28:09,950 --> 01:28:09,960
robots
 

4589
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:12,110
robots
this one's gonna go right it's so

4590
01:28:12,110 --> 01:28:12,120
this one's gonna go right it's so
 

4591
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:14,450
this one's gonna go right it's so
obvious that there's a need and we're

4592
01:28:14,450 --> 01:28:14,460
obvious that there's a need and we're
 

4593
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:15,830
obvious that there's a need and we're
not just going to unload trucks we're

4594
01:28:15,830 --> 01:28:15,840
not just going to unload trucks we're
 

4595
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:17,750
not just going to unload trucks we're
going to do any box moving task in the

4596
01:28:17,750 --> 01:28:17,760
going to do any box moving task in the
 

4597
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:19,370
going to do any box moving task in the
warehouse and so it too will be a

4598
01:28:19,370 --> 01:28:19,380
warehouse and so it too will be a
 

4599
01:28:19,380 --> 01:28:22,250
warehouse and so it too will be a
multi-purpose robot and we'll eventually

4600
01:28:22,250 --> 01:28:22,260
multi-purpose robot and we'll eventually
 

4601
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:23,990
multi-purpose robot and we'll eventually
have it doing palletizing or

4602
01:28:23,990 --> 01:28:24,000
have it doing palletizing or
 

4603
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,689
have it doing palletizing or
de-palletizing or loading trucks or

4604
01:28:26,689 --> 01:28:26,699
de-palletizing or loading trucks or
 

4605
01:28:26,699 --> 01:28:28,250
de-palletizing or loading trucks or
unloading trucks

4606
01:28:28,250 --> 01:28:28,260
unloading trucks
 

4607
01:28:28,260 --> 01:28:30,110
unloading trucks
there's definitely thousands of robots

4608
01:28:30,110 --> 01:28:30,120
there's definitely thousands of robots
 

4609
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:31,550
there's definitely thousands of robots
there's probably tens of thousands of

4610
01:28:31,550 --> 01:28:31,560
there's probably tens of thousands of
 

4611
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:34,430
there's probably tens of thousands of
robots of this in in the future so it's

4612
01:28:34,430 --> 01:28:34,440
robots of this in in the future so it's
 

4613
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:35,990
robots of this in in the future so it's
going to be profitable can you describe

4614
01:28:35,990 --> 01:28:36,000
going to be profitable can you describe
 

4615
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,870
going to be profitable can you describe
what stretch looks like it looks like a

4616
01:28:38,870 --> 01:28:38,880
what stretch looks like it looks like a
 

4617
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:41,990
what stretch looks like it looks like a
big strong uh robot arm on a mobile base

4618
01:28:41,990 --> 01:28:42,000
big strong uh robot arm on a mobile base
 

4619
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,570
big strong uh robot arm on a mobile base
the base is about the size of a pallet

4620
01:28:44,570 --> 01:28:44,580
the base is about the size of a pallet
 

4621
01:28:44,580 --> 01:28:46,310
the base is about the size of a pallet
and we want it to be the size of a

4622
01:28:46,310 --> 01:28:46,320
and we want it to be the size of a
 

4623
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:47,870
and we want it to be the size of a
palette because that's what lives in

4624
01:28:47,870 --> 01:28:47,880
palette because that's what lives in
 

4625
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:49,490
palette because that's what lives in
warehouses right pallets of goods

4626
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:49,500
warehouses right pallets of goods
 

4627
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:51,470
warehouses right pallets of goods
sitting everywhere so we needed to be

4628
01:28:51,470 --> 01:28:51,480
sitting everywhere so we needed to be
 

4629
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:53,270
sitting everywhere so we needed to be
able to fit in that space it's not a

4630
01:28:53,270 --> 01:28:53,280
able to fit in that space it's not a
 

4631
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:55,250
able to fit in that space it's not a
legged mobile not a legged robot so it

4632
01:28:55,250 --> 01:28:55,260
legged mobile not a legged robot so it
 

4633
01:28:55,260 --> 01:28:56,990
legged mobile not a legged robot so it
was our first

4634
01:28:56,990 --> 01:28:57,000
was our first
 

4635
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,550
was our first
it was actually

4636
01:28:58,550 --> 01:28:58,560
it was actually
 

4637
01:28:58,560 --> 01:28:59,330
it was actually
um

4638
01:28:59,330 --> 01:28:59,340
um
 

4639
01:28:59,340 --> 01:29:01,450
um
a bit of a

4640
01:29:01,450 --> 01:29:01,460
a bit of a
 

4641
01:29:01,460 --> 01:29:04,370
a bit of a
uh commitment from us a challenge for us

4642
01:29:04,370 --> 01:29:04,380
uh commitment from us a challenge for us
 

4643
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:06,970
uh commitment from us a challenge for us
to build a non-balancing robot

4644
01:29:06,970 --> 01:29:06,980
to build a non-balancing robot
 

4645
01:29:06,980 --> 01:29:10,430
to build a non-balancing robot
to do the much easier problem and to put

4646
01:29:10,430 --> 01:29:10,440
to do the much easier problem and to put
 

4647
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:12,350
to do the much easier problem and to put
to do away well because it wasn't you

4648
01:29:12,350 --> 01:29:12,360
to do away well because it wasn't you
 

4649
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:13,610
to do away well because it wasn't you
know it wasn't going to have this

4650
01:29:13,610 --> 01:29:13,620
know it wasn't going to have this
 

4651
01:29:13,620 --> 01:29:15,830
know it wasn't going to have this
balance problem and in fact the very

4652
01:29:15,830 --> 01:29:15,840
balance problem and in fact the very
 

4653
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:18,530
balance problem and in fact the very
first version of the logistics robot we

4654
01:29:18,530 --> 01:29:18,540
first version of the logistics robot we
 

4655
01:29:18,540 --> 01:29:20,930
first version of the logistics robot we
build was a balancing robot and that's

4656
01:29:20,930 --> 01:29:20,940
build was a balancing robot and that's
 

4657
01:29:20,940 --> 01:29:23,510
build was a balancing robot and that's
called handle and there's that thing was

4658
01:29:23,510 --> 01:29:23,520
called handle and there's that thing was
 

4659
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:26,450
called handle and there's that thing was
epic oh it's a beautiful machine it's an

4660
01:29:26,450 --> 01:29:26,460
epic oh it's a beautiful machine it's an
 

4661
01:29:26,460 --> 01:29:29,709
epic oh it's a beautiful machine it's an
incredible machine so it was uh

4662
01:29:29,709 --> 01:29:29,719
incredible machine so it was uh
 

4663
01:29:29,719 --> 01:29:33,110
incredible machine so it was uh
I mean it looks epic it looks like a out

4664
01:29:33,110 --> 01:29:33,120
I mean it looks epic it looks like a out
 

4665
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:36,290
I mean it looks epic it looks like a out
of a uh I mean out of the sci-fi movie

4666
01:29:36,290 --> 01:29:36,300
of a uh I mean out of the sci-fi movie
 

4667
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:38,270
of a uh I mean out of the sci-fi movie
of some sorts I mean just can you

4668
01:29:38,270 --> 01:29:38,280
of some sorts I mean just can you
 

4669
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:39,709
of some sorts I mean just can you
actually just Linger on the like the

4670
01:29:39,709 --> 01:29:39,719
actually just Linger on the like the
 

4671
01:29:39,719 --> 01:29:41,149
actually just Linger on the like the
design of that thing because that's

4672
01:29:41,149 --> 01:29:41,159
design of that thing because that's
 

4673
01:29:41,159 --> 01:29:42,709
design of that thing because that's
another leap into something you probably

4674
01:29:42,709 --> 01:29:42,719
another leap into something you probably
 

4675
01:29:42,719 --> 01:29:43,910
another leap into something you probably
haven't done it's a different kind of

4676
01:29:43,910 --> 01:29:43,920
haven't done it's a different kind of
 

4677
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:46,129
haven't done it's a different kind of
balancing yeah so let me I I'd love I

4678
01:29:46,129 --> 01:29:46,139
balancing yeah so let me I I'd love I
 

4679
01:29:46,139 --> 01:29:47,930
balancing yeah so let me I I'd love I
love talking about the history of how a

4680
01:29:47,930 --> 01:29:47,940
love talking about the history of how a
 

4681
01:29:47,940 --> 01:29:50,450
love talking about the history of how a
handle came about because it connects

4682
01:29:50,450 --> 01:29:50,460
handle came about because it connects
 

4683
01:29:50,460 --> 01:29:52,250
handle came about because it connects
all of our robots actually

4684
01:29:52,250 --> 01:29:52,260
all of our robots actually
 

4685
01:29:52,260 --> 01:29:53,570
all of our robots actually
so

4686
01:29:53,570 --> 01:29:53,580
so
 

4687
01:29:53,580 --> 01:29:56,330
so
um I'm going to start with Atlas when we

4688
01:29:56,330 --> 01:29:56,340
um I'm going to start with Atlas when we
 

4689
01:29:56,340 --> 01:29:58,490
um I'm going to start with Atlas when we
when we had Atlas getting fairly far

4690
01:29:58,490 --> 01:29:58,500
when we had Atlas getting fairly far
 

4691
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:01,070
when we had Atlas getting fairly far
along we wanted to understand I was

4692
01:30:01,070 --> 01:30:01,080
along we wanted to understand I was
 

4693
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:02,510
along we wanted to understand I was
telling you earlier the challenge of the

4694
01:30:02,510 --> 01:30:02,520
telling you earlier the challenge of the
 

4695
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:05,590
telling you earlier the challenge of the
human form is you have this Mass up high

4696
01:30:05,590 --> 01:30:05,600
human form is you have this Mass up high
 

4697
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:10,129
human form is you have this Mass up high
and balancing that inertia that mass up

4698
01:30:10,129 --> 01:30:10,139
and balancing that inertia that mass up
 

4699
01:30:10,139 --> 01:30:13,129
and balancing that inertia that mass up
high is its own unique Challenge and so

4700
01:30:13,129 --> 01:30:13,139
high is its own unique Challenge and so
 

4701
01:30:13,139 --> 01:30:14,810
high is its own unique Challenge and so
we started trying to get atlas to

4702
01:30:14,810 --> 01:30:14,820
we started trying to get atlas to
 

4703
01:30:14,820 --> 01:30:17,330
we started trying to get atlas to
balance standing on one foot like on a

4704
01:30:17,330 --> 01:30:17,340
balance standing on one foot like on a
 

4705
01:30:17,340 --> 01:30:19,669
balance standing on one foot like on a
balance beam using its arms like this

4706
01:30:19,669 --> 01:30:19,679
balance beam using its arms like this
 

4707
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:21,530
balance beam using its arms like this
and yeah you can do this I'm sure I can

4708
01:30:21,530 --> 01:30:21,540
and yeah you can do this I'm sure I can
 

4709
01:30:21,540 --> 01:30:23,270
and yeah you can do this I'm sure I can
do this right like if you're walking a

4710
01:30:23,270 --> 01:30:23,280
do this right like if you're walking a
 

4711
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:24,410
do this right like if you're walking a
tightrope

4712
01:30:24,410 --> 01:30:24,420
tightrope
 

4713
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:26,510
tightrope
how do you do that balance

4714
01:30:26,510 --> 01:30:26,520
how do you do that balance
 

4715
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:28,850
how do you do that balance
so that's sort of you know controlling

4716
01:30:28,850 --> 01:30:28,860
so that's sort of you know controlling
 

4717
01:30:28,860 --> 01:30:30,890
so that's sort of you know controlling
the inertia controlling the momentum of

4718
01:30:30,890 --> 01:30:30,900
the inertia controlling the momentum of
 

4719
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:31,910
the inertia controlling the momentum of
the robot

4720
01:30:31,910 --> 01:30:31,920
the robot
 

4721
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:33,709
the robot
we were starting to figure that out on

4722
01:30:33,709 --> 01:30:33,719
we were starting to figure that out on
 

4723
01:30:33,719 --> 01:30:35,330
we were starting to figure that out on
Atlas

4724
01:30:35,330 --> 01:30:35,340
Atlas
 

4725
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:37,729
Atlas
and so our first concept of handle which

4726
01:30:37,729 --> 01:30:37,739
and so our first concept of handle which
 

4727
01:30:37,739 --> 01:30:39,350
and so our first concept of handle which
was a robot that was going to be on two

4728
01:30:39,350 --> 01:30:39,360
was a robot that was going to be on two
 

4729
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:41,689
was a robot that was going to be on two
wheels so it had to balance

4730
01:30:41,689 --> 01:30:41,699
wheels so it had to balance
 

4731
01:30:41,699 --> 01:30:43,129
wheels so it had to balance
but it was going to have a big long arm

4732
01:30:43,129 --> 01:30:43,139
but it was going to have a big long arm
 

4733
01:30:43,139 --> 01:30:45,890
but it was going to have a big long arm
so it could reach a box at the top of a

4734
01:30:45,890 --> 01:30:45,900
so it could reach a box at the top of a
 

4735
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:47,030
so it could reach a box at the top of a
truck

4736
01:30:47,030 --> 01:30:47,040
truck
 

4737
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:49,669
truck
and it was gonna it needed yet another

4738
01:30:49,669 --> 01:30:49,679
and it was gonna it needed yet another
 

4739
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:53,510
and it was gonna it needed yet another
counterbalance a big tail to help it

4740
01:30:53,510 --> 01:30:53,520
counterbalance a big tail to help it
 

4741
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:56,810
counterbalance a big tail to help it
balance while it was using its arm

4742
01:30:56,810 --> 01:30:56,820
balance while it was using its arm
 

4743
01:30:56,820 --> 01:31:00,050
balance while it was using its arm
so the reason why this robot sort of

4744
01:31:00,050 --> 01:31:00,060
so the reason why this robot sort of
 

4745
01:31:00,060 --> 01:31:02,209
so the reason why this robot sort of
looks epic it some people said it looked

4746
01:31:02,209 --> 01:31:02,219
looks epic it some people said it looked
 

4747
01:31:02,219 --> 01:31:05,750
looks epic it some people said it looked
like an ostrich or maybe an ostrich

4748
01:31:05,750 --> 01:31:05,760
like an ostrich or maybe an ostrich
 

4749
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:07,129
like an ostrich or maybe an ostrich
moving around

4750
01:31:07,129 --> 01:31:07,139
moving around
 

4751
01:31:07,139 --> 01:31:10,669
moving around
was the wheels the Le it has legs so it

4752
01:31:10,669 --> 01:31:10,679
was the wheels the Le it has legs so it
 

4753
01:31:10,679 --> 01:31:12,470
was the wheels the Le it has legs so it
can extend its legs

4754
01:31:12,470 --> 01:31:12,480
can extend its legs
 

4755
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:14,510
can extend its legs
so it's wheels on legs we always wanted

4756
01:31:14,510 --> 01:31:14,520
so it's wheels on legs we always wanted
 

4757
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:16,430
so it's wheels on legs we always wanted
to build wheels on legs it had a tail

4758
01:31:16,430 --> 01:31:16,440
to build wheels on legs it had a tail
 

4759
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:17,990
to build wheels on legs it had a tail
and it had this arm and they're all

4760
01:31:17,990 --> 01:31:18,000
and it had this arm and they're all
 

4761
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,669
and it had this arm and they're all
moving simultaneously and in

4762
01:31:19,669 --> 01:31:19,679
moving simultaneously and in
 

4763
01:31:19,679 --> 01:31:21,950
moving simultaneously and in
coordination to maintain balance because

4764
01:31:21,950 --> 01:31:21,960
coordination to maintain balance because
 

4765
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:23,870
coordination to maintain balance because
we had figured out the mathematics of

4766
01:31:23,870 --> 01:31:23,880
we had figured out the mathematics of
 

4767
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:26,149
we had figured out the mathematics of
doing this momentum control how to

4768
01:31:26,149 --> 01:31:26,159
doing this momentum control how to
 

4769
01:31:26,159 --> 01:31:28,970
doing this momentum control how to
maintain that balance and so part of the

4770
01:31:28,970 --> 01:31:28,980
maintain that balance and so part of the
 

4771
01:31:28,980 --> 01:31:30,470
maintain that balance and so part of the
reason why we built this two-legged

4772
01:31:30,470 --> 01:31:30,480
reason why we built this two-legged
 

4773
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:33,530
reason why we built this two-legged
robot was we had figured this thing out

4774
01:31:33,530 --> 01:31:33,540
robot was we had figured this thing out
 

4775
01:31:33,540 --> 01:31:35,629
robot was we had figured this thing out
we wanted to see it in this kind of

4776
01:31:35,629 --> 01:31:35,639
we wanted to see it in this kind of
 

4777
01:31:35,639 --> 01:31:37,550
we wanted to see it in this kind of
machine and we thought maybe this kind

4778
01:31:37,550 --> 01:31:37,560
machine and we thought maybe this kind
 

4779
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:38,930
machine and we thought maybe this kind
of machine would be good in a warehouse

4780
01:31:38,930 --> 01:31:38,940
of machine would be good in a warehouse
 

4781
01:31:38,940 --> 01:31:40,550
of machine would be good in a warehouse
and so we built it and it's a beautiful

4782
01:31:40,550 --> 01:31:40,560
and so we built it and it's a beautiful
 

4783
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:43,070
and so we built it and it's a beautiful
machine it moves in a graceful way like

4784
01:31:43,070 --> 01:31:43,080
machine it moves in a graceful way like
 

4785
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:46,189
machine it moves in a graceful way like
nothing else we've built but it wasn't

4786
01:31:46,189 --> 01:31:46,199
nothing else we've built but it wasn't
 

4787
01:31:46,199 --> 01:31:48,050
nothing else we've built but it wasn't
the right machine for a logistics

4788
01:31:48,050 --> 01:31:48,060
the right machine for a logistics
 

4789
01:31:48,060 --> 01:31:50,689
the right machine for a logistics
application we decided it was too slow

4790
01:31:50,689 --> 01:31:50,699
application we decided it was too slow
 

4791
01:31:50,699 --> 01:31:52,669
application we decided it was too slow
and couldn't pick boxes fast enough

4792
01:31:52,669 --> 01:31:52,679
and couldn't pick boxes fast enough
 

4793
01:31:52,679 --> 01:31:55,129
and couldn't pick boxes fast enough
basically and it was doing beautifully

4794
01:31:55,129 --> 01:31:55,139
basically and it was doing beautifully
 

4795
01:31:55,139 --> 01:31:57,590
basically and it was doing beautifully
with Elegance but it just wasn't

4796
01:31:57,590 --> 01:31:57,600
with Elegance but it just wasn't
 

4797
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:00,410
with Elegance but it just wasn't
efficient enough uh so we let it go yeah

4798
01:32:00,410 --> 01:32:00,420
efficient enough uh so we let it go yeah
 

4799
01:32:00,420 --> 01:32:03,290
efficient enough uh so we let it go yeah
but I think we'll come back to that

4800
01:32:03,290 --> 01:32:03,300
but I think we'll come back to that
 

4801
01:32:03,300 --> 01:32:05,209
but I think we'll come back to that
machine eventually the fact that it's

4802
01:32:05,209 --> 01:32:05,219
machine eventually the fact that it's
 

4803
01:32:05,219 --> 01:32:06,830
machine eventually the fact that it's
possible the fact that he showed that

4804
01:32:06,830 --> 01:32:06,840
possible the fact that he showed that
 

4805
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:09,169
possible the fact that he showed that
you could do so many things at the same

4806
01:32:09,169 --> 01:32:09,179
you could do so many things at the same
 

4807
01:32:09,179 --> 01:32:11,330
you could do so many things at the same
time in coordination that's so

4808
01:32:11,330 --> 01:32:11,340
time in coordination that's so
 

4809
01:32:11,340 --> 01:32:12,950
time in coordination that's so
beautifully there's something there yeah

4810
01:32:12,950 --> 01:32:12,960
beautifully there's something there yeah
 

4811
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:14,810
beautifully there's something there yeah
that was a demonstration of what is

4812
01:32:14,810 --> 01:32:14,820
that was a demonstration of what is
 

4813
01:32:14,820 --> 01:32:15,709
that was a demonstration of what is
possible

4814
01:32:15,709 --> 01:32:15,719
possible
 

4815
01:32:15,719 --> 01:32:17,570
possible
basically we made a hard decision and

4816
01:32:17,570 --> 01:32:17,580
basically we made a hard decision and
 

4817
01:32:17,580 --> 01:32:19,550
basically we made a hard decision and
this was really kind of a hard-nosed

4818
01:32:19,550 --> 01:32:19,560
this was really kind of a hard-nosed
 

4819
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:21,410
this was really kind of a hard-nosed
business decision it was it was it

4820
01:32:21,410 --> 01:32:21,420
business decision it was it was it
 

4821
01:32:21,420 --> 01:32:23,030
business decision it was it was it
indicated us

4822
01:32:23,030 --> 01:32:23,040
indicated us
 

4823
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:26,149
indicated us
not doing it just for the beauty of the

4824
01:32:26,149 --> 01:32:26,159
not doing it just for the beauty of the
 

4825
01:32:26,159 --> 01:32:28,610
not doing it just for the beauty of the
mathematics or the Curiosity but no we

4826
01:32:28,610 --> 01:32:28,620
mathematics or the Curiosity but no we
 

4827
01:32:28,620 --> 01:32:30,050
mathematics or the Curiosity but no we
actually need to build a business that

4828
01:32:30,050 --> 01:32:30,060
actually need to build a business that
 

4829
01:32:30,060 --> 01:32:32,090
actually need to build a business that
that could make money in the long run

4830
01:32:32,090 --> 01:32:32,100
that could make money in the long run
 

4831
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:33,950
that could make money in the long run
and so we ended up building stretch

4832
01:32:33,950 --> 01:32:33,960
and so we ended up building stretch
 

4833
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:36,290
and so we ended up building stretch
which has a big heavy base with a giant

4834
01:32:36,290 --> 01:32:36,300
which has a big heavy base with a giant
 

4835
01:32:36,300 --> 01:32:38,990
which has a big heavy base with a giant
battery in the base of it that allows it

4836
01:32:38,990 --> 01:32:39,000
battery in the base of it that allows it
 

4837
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:42,470
battery in the base of it that allows it
to run for two two shifts 16 hours worth

4838
01:32:42,470 --> 01:32:42,480
to run for two two shifts 16 hours worth
 

4839
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:43,729
to run for two two shifts 16 hours worth
of operation

4840
01:32:43,729 --> 01:32:43,739
of operation
 

4841
01:32:43,739 --> 01:32:46,669
of operation
and that big battery is sort of helps it

4842
01:32:46,669 --> 01:32:46,679
and that big battery is sort of helps it
 

4843
01:32:46,679 --> 01:32:48,770
and that big battery is sort of helps it
stay balanced right so you can move a 50

4844
01:32:48,770 --> 01:32:48,780
stay balanced right so you can move a 50
 

4845
01:32:48,780 --> 01:32:50,510
stay balanced right so you can move a 50
pound box around with its arm and not

4846
01:32:50,510 --> 01:32:50,520
pound box around with its arm and not
 

4847
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:52,149
pound box around with its arm and not
tip over um

4848
01:32:52,149 --> 01:32:52,159
tip over um
 

4849
01:32:52,159 --> 01:32:54,709
tip over um
it's omnidirectional it can move in any

4850
01:32:54,709 --> 01:32:54,719
it's omnidirectional it can move in any
 

4851
01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:57,110
it's omnidirectional it can move in any
direction so it has a nice suspension

4852
01:32:57,110 --> 01:32:57,120
direction so it has a nice suspension
 

4853
01:32:57,120 --> 01:32:59,450
direction so it has a nice suspension
built into it so it can deal with

4854
01:32:59,450 --> 01:32:59,460
built into it so it can deal with
 

4855
01:32:59,460 --> 01:33:01,850
built into it so it can deal with
you know gaps or things on the floor and

4856
01:33:01,850 --> 01:33:01,860
you know gaps or things on the floor and
 

4857
01:33:01,860 --> 01:33:04,550
you know gaps or things on the floor and
roll over it but it's a that it's not a

4858
01:33:04,550 --> 01:33:04,560
roll over it but it's a that it's not a
 

4859
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:06,790
roll over it but it's a that it's not a
balancing robot it's a mobile robot arm

4860
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:06,800
balancing robot it's a mobile robot arm
 

4861
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:10,070
balancing robot it's a mobile robot arm
that can work to carry it or pick or

4862
01:33:10,070 --> 01:33:10,080
that can work to carry it or pick or
 

4863
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:12,350
that can work to carry it or pick or
place a box up to 50 pounds anywhere in

4864
01:33:12,350 --> 01:33:12,360
place a box up to 50 pounds anywhere in
 

4865
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:13,370
place a box up to 50 pounds anywhere in
the warehouse

4866
01:33:13,370 --> 01:33:13,380
the warehouse
 

4867
01:33:13,380 --> 01:33:15,709
the warehouse
from take a box from point A to point B

4868
01:33:15,709 --> 01:33:15,719
from take a box from point A to point B
 

4869
01:33:15,719 --> 01:33:18,770
from take a box from point A to point B
anywhere yeah palletize de-palletize

4870
01:33:18,770 --> 01:33:18,780
anywhere yeah palletize de-palletize
 

4871
01:33:18,780 --> 01:33:20,570
anywhere yeah palletize de-palletize
we're starting with unloading trucks

4872
01:33:20,570 --> 01:33:20,580
we're starting with unloading trucks
 

4873
01:33:20,580 --> 01:33:22,430
we're starting with unloading trucks
because there's so many trucks and

4874
01:33:22,430 --> 01:33:22,440
because there's so many trucks and
 

4875
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:24,410
because there's so many trucks and
containers that where goods are shipped

4876
01:33:24,410 --> 01:33:24,420
containers that where goods are shipped
 

4877
01:33:24,420 --> 01:33:26,629
containers that where goods are shipped
and it's a brutal job you know in the

4878
01:33:26,629 --> 01:33:26,639
and it's a brutal job you know in the
 

4879
01:33:26,639 --> 01:33:29,209
and it's a brutal job you know in the
summer it can be 120 degrees inside that

4880
01:33:29,209 --> 01:33:29,219
summer it can be 120 degrees inside that
 

4881
01:33:29,219 --> 01:33:31,070
summer it can be 120 degrees inside that
container people don't want to do that

4882
01:33:31,070 --> 01:33:31,080
container people don't want to do that
 

4883
01:33:31,080 --> 01:33:32,930
container people don't want to do that
job

4884
01:33:32,930 --> 01:33:32,940
job
 

4885
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:34,790
job
um and it's back breaking labor right

4886
01:33:34,790 --> 01:33:34,800
um and it's back breaking labor right
 

4887
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:38,090
um and it's back breaking labor right
again these can be up to 50 pound boxes

4888
01:33:38,090 --> 01:33:38,100
again these can be up to 50 pound boxes
 

4889
01:33:38,100 --> 01:33:39,729
again these can be up to 50 pound boxes
um and so

4890
01:33:39,729 --> 01:33:39,739
um and so
 

4891
01:33:39,739 --> 01:33:41,870
um and so
we feel like this is a productivity

4892
01:33:41,870 --> 01:33:41,880
we feel like this is a productivity
 

4893
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:44,330
we feel like this is a productivity
enhancer and for the people who used to

4894
01:33:44,330 --> 01:33:44,340
enhancer and for the people who used to
 

4895
01:33:44,340 --> 01:33:46,790
enhancer and for the people who used to
do that job unloading trucks

4896
01:33:46,790 --> 01:33:46,800
do that job unloading trucks
 

4897
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:49,070
do that job unloading trucks
they're actually operating the robot now

4898
01:33:49,070 --> 01:33:49,080
they're actually operating the robot now
 

4899
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:51,530
they're actually operating the robot now
and so by building robots that are easy

4900
01:33:51,530 --> 01:33:51,540
and so by building robots that are easy
 

4901
01:33:51,540 --> 01:33:53,090
and so by building robots that are easy
to control

4902
01:33:53,090 --> 01:33:53,100
to control
 

4903
01:33:53,100 --> 01:33:54,770
to control
and it doesn't take an advanced degree

4904
01:33:54,770 --> 01:33:54,780
and it doesn't take an advanced degree
 

4905
01:33:54,780 --> 01:33:55,970
and it doesn't take an advanced degree
to manage

4906
01:33:55,970 --> 01:33:55,980
to manage
 

4907
01:33:55,980 --> 01:33:58,250
to manage
you can become a robot operator and so

4908
01:33:58,250 --> 01:33:58,260
you can become a robot operator and so
 

4909
01:33:58,260 --> 01:34:00,169
you can become a robot operator and so
as we we've introduced these robots to

4910
01:34:00,169 --> 01:34:00,179
as we we've introduced these robots to
 

4911
01:34:00,179 --> 01:34:03,110
as we we've introduced these robots to
both DHL and mariskin Gap the warehouse

4912
01:34:03,110 --> 01:34:03,120
both DHL and mariskin Gap the warehouse
 

4913
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:04,970
both DHL and mariskin Gap the warehouse
workers who were doing that that manual

4914
01:34:04,970 --> 01:34:04,980
workers who were doing that that manual
 

4915
01:34:04,980 --> 01:34:06,950
workers who were doing that that manual
labor are now the robot operators and so

4916
01:34:06,950 --> 01:34:06,960
labor are now the robot operators and so
 

4917
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:09,229
labor are now the robot operators and so
we see this as ultimately a benefit to

4918
01:34:09,229 --> 01:34:09,239
we see this as ultimately a benefit to
 

4919
01:34:09,239 --> 01:34:11,110
we see this as ultimately a benefit to
them as well

4920
01:34:11,110 --> 01:34:11,120
them as well
 

4921
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:15,950
them as well
can you say how much stretch cost

4922
01:34:15,950 --> 01:34:15,960

 

4923
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:20,570

um not yet uh but I will say that uh we

4924
01:34:20,570 --> 01:34:20,580
um not yet uh but I will say that uh we
 

4925
01:34:20,580 --> 01:34:22,209
um not yet uh but I will say that uh we
when we engage with our customers

4926
01:34:22,209 --> 01:34:22,219
when we engage with our customers
 

4927
01:34:22,219 --> 01:34:24,590
when we engage with our customers
they'll be able to see a return on

4928
01:34:24,590 --> 01:34:24,600
they'll be able to see a return on
 

4929
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:26,930
they'll be able to see a return on
investment in typically two years okay

4930
01:34:26,930 --> 01:34:26,940
investment in typically two years okay
 

4931
01:34:26,940 --> 01:34:28,669
investment in typically two years okay
so that's something you're constantly

4932
01:34:28,669 --> 01:34:28,679
so that's something you're constantly
 

4933
01:34:28,679 --> 01:34:31,070
so that's something you're constantly
thinking about how yeah and I suppose

4934
01:34:31,070 --> 01:34:31,080
thinking about how yeah and I suppose
 

4935
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:32,330
thinking about how yeah and I suppose
you have to do the same kind of thinking

4936
01:34:32,330 --> 01:34:32,340
you have to do the same kind of thinking
 

4937
01:34:32,340 --> 01:34:34,310
you have to do the same kind of thinking
with spot so it seems like we've

4938
01:34:34,310 --> 01:34:34,320
with spot so it seems like we've
 

4939
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:36,470
with spot so it seems like we've
stretched the application is

4940
01:34:36,470 --> 01:34:36,480
stretched the application is
 

4941
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:39,590
stretched the application is
like directly obvious yeah to slam dunk

4942
01:34:39,590 --> 01:34:39,600
like directly obvious yeah to slam dunk
 

4943
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:41,510
like directly obvious yeah to slam dunk
yeah and so you can you have a little

4944
01:34:41,510 --> 01:34:41,520
yeah and so you can you have a little
 

4945
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:43,490
yeah and so you can you have a little
more flexibility well I think we know

4946
01:34:43,490 --> 01:34:43,500
more flexibility well I think we know
 

4947
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:45,350
more flexibility well I think we know
the target we know what we're going

4948
01:34:45,350 --> 01:34:45,360
the target we know what we're going
 

4949
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:47,450
the target we know what we're going
after yeah and with spot it took us a

4950
01:34:47,450 --> 01:34:47,460
after yeah and with spot it took us a
 

4951
01:34:47,460 --> 01:34:48,530
after yeah and with spot it took us a
while to figure out what we were going

4952
01:34:48,530 --> 01:34:48,540
while to figure out what we were going
 

4953
01:34:48,540 --> 01:34:50,570
while to figure out what we were going
after well let me return to that

4954
01:34:50,570 --> 01:34:50,580
after well let me return to that
 

4955
01:34:50,580 --> 01:34:53,149
after well let me return to that
question about uh

4956
01:34:53,149 --> 01:34:53,159
question about uh
 

4957
01:34:53,159 --> 01:34:55,490
question about uh
maybe the conversation you were having

4958
01:34:55,490 --> 01:34:55,500
maybe the conversation you were having
 

4959
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:58,370
maybe the conversation you were having
a while ago with Larry Page maybe

4960
01:34:58,370 --> 01:34:58,380
a while ago with Larry Page maybe
 

4961
01:34:58,380 --> 01:35:00,770
a while ago with Larry Page maybe
looking to the longer future

4962
01:35:00,770 --> 01:35:00,780
looking to the longer future
 

4963
01:35:00,780 --> 01:35:04,729
looking to the longer future
of uh social robotics of using spot to

4964
01:35:04,729 --> 01:35:04,739
of uh social robotics of using spot to
 

4965
01:35:04,739 --> 01:35:06,229
of uh social robotics of using spot to
connect with human beings perhaps in the

4966
01:35:06,229 --> 01:35:06,239
connect with human beings perhaps in the
 

4967
01:35:06,239 --> 01:35:08,629
connect with human beings perhaps in the
home do you see a future there if we

4968
01:35:08,629 --> 01:35:08,639
home do you see a future there if we
 

4969
01:35:08,639 --> 01:35:09,850
home do you see a future there if we
were to sort of

4970
01:35:09,850 --> 01:35:09,860
were to sort of
 

4971
01:35:09,860 --> 01:35:12,590
were to sort of
hypothesize or dream about a future

4972
01:35:12,590 --> 01:35:12,600
hypothesize or dream about a future
 

4973
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:14,689
hypothesize or dream about a future
where a spot like robots are in the home

4974
01:35:14,689 --> 01:35:14,699
where a spot like robots are in the home
 

4975
01:35:14,699 --> 01:35:16,669
where a spot like robots are in the home
as pets a social robot we definitely

4976
01:35:16,669 --> 01:35:16,679
as pets a social robot we definitely
 

4977
01:35:16,679 --> 01:35:18,890
as pets a social robot we definitely
think about it and and we would like to

4978
01:35:18,890 --> 01:35:18,900
think about it and and we would like to
 

4979
01:35:18,900 --> 01:35:19,850
think about it and and we would like to
get there

4980
01:35:19,850 --> 01:35:19,860
get there
 

4981
01:35:19,860 --> 01:35:21,950
get there
uh we think the pathway to getting there

4982
01:35:21,950 --> 01:35:21,960
uh we think the pathway to getting there
 

4983
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:24,590
uh we think the pathway to getting there
is you know likely through these

4984
01:35:24,590 --> 01:35:24,600
is you know likely through these
 

4985
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:26,450
is you know likely through these
industrial applications

4986
01:35:26,450 --> 01:35:26,460
industrial applications
 

4987
01:35:26,460 --> 01:35:28,430
industrial applications
and then Mass manufacturing you know

4988
01:35:28,430 --> 01:35:28,440
and then Mass manufacturing you know
 

4989
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:31,189
and then Mass manufacturing you know
let's figure out what how to melt how to

4990
01:35:31,189 --> 01:35:31,199
let's figure out what how to melt how to
 

4991
01:35:31,199 --> 01:35:32,510
let's figure out what how to melt how to
build the robots how to make the

4992
01:35:32,510 --> 01:35:32,520
build the robots how to make the
 

4993
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:34,250
build the robots how to make the
software so they can really do a broad

4994
01:35:34,250 --> 01:35:34,260
software so they can really do a broad
 

4995
01:35:34,260 --> 01:35:37,129
software so they can really do a broad
set of skills that's going to take

4996
01:35:37,129 --> 01:35:37,139
set of skills that's going to take
 

4997
01:35:37,139 --> 01:35:40,310
set of skills that's going to take
real investment to get there performance

4998
01:35:40,310 --> 01:35:40,320
real investment to get there performance
 

4999
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:42,290
real investment to get there performance
first right the principle of the company

5000
01:35:42,290 --> 01:35:42,300
first right the principle of the company
 

5001
01:35:42,300 --> 01:35:44,209
first right the principle of the company
has always been really make the robots

5002
01:35:44,209 --> 01:35:44,219
has always been really make the robots
 

5003
01:35:44,219 --> 01:35:45,590
has always been really make the robots
do useful stuff

5004
01:35:45,590 --> 01:35:45,600
do useful stuff
 

5005
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:47,930
do useful stuff
and so you know the the

5006
01:35:47,930 --> 01:35:47,940
and so you know the the
 

5007
01:35:47,940 --> 01:35:50,930
and so you know the the
social robot companies that tried to

5008
01:35:50,930 --> 01:35:50,940
social robot companies that tried to
 

5009
01:35:50,940 --> 01:35:53,390
social robot companies that tried to
start Someplace Else by just making a

5010
01:35:53,390 --> 01:35:53,400
start Someplace Else by just making a
 

5011
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:55,129
start Someplace Else by just making a
cute interaction mostly they haven't

5012
01:35:55,129 --> 01:35:55,139
cute interaction mostly they haven't
 

5013
01:35:55,139 --> 01:35:56,750
cute interaction mostly they haven't
survived

5014
01:35:56,750 --> 01:35:56,760
survived
 

5015
01:35:56,760 --> 01:36:00,290
survived
and so we think the utility

5016
01:36:00,290 --> 01:36:00,300
and so we think the utility
 

5017
01:36:00,300 --> 01:36:02,390
and so we think the utility
really needs to come first and that

5018
01:36:02,390 --> 01:36:02,400
really needs to come first and that
 

5019
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:04,430
really needs to come first and that
means you have to Heart solve some of

5020
01:36:04,430 --> 01:36:04,440
means you have to Heart solve some of
 

5021
01:36:04,440 --> 01:36:08,030
means you have to Heart solve some of
these hard problems and so to get there

5022
01:36:08,030 --> 01:36:08,040
these hard problems and so to get there
 

5023
01:36:08,040 --> 01:36:11,270
these hard problems and so to get there
we're going to go through the design and

5024
01:36:11,270 --> 01:36:11,280
we're going to go through the design and
 

5025
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:13,669
we're going to go through the design and
software development in industrial and

5026
01:36:13,669 --> 01:36:13,679
software development in industrial and
 

5027
01:36:13,679 --> 01:36:14,930
software development in industrial and
then that's eventually going to let you

5028
01:36:14,930 --> 01:36:14,940
then that's eventually going to let you
 

5029
01:36:14,940 --> 01:36:16,550
then that's eventually going to let you
reach a scale that could then be

5030
01:36:16,550 --> 01:36:16,560
reach a scale that could then be
 

5031
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:18,890
reach a scale that could then be
addressed to a commercial a consumer

5032
01:36:18,890 --> 01:36:18,900
addressed to a commercial a consumer
 

5033
01:36:18,900 --> 01:36:20,450
addressed to a commercial a consumer
level Market

5034
01:36:20,450 --> 01:36:20,460
level Market
 

5035
01:36:20,460 --> 01:36:22,610
level Market
and so yeah maybe we'll be able to build

5036
01:36:22,610 --> 01:36:22,620
and so yeah maybe we'll be able to build
 

5037
01:36:22,620 --> 01:36:25,129
and so yeah maybe we'll be able to build
a smaller spot with an arm that could

5038
01:36:25,129 --> 01:36:25,139
a smaller spot with an arm that could
 

5039
01:36:25,139 --> 01:36:27,290
a smaller spot with an arm that could
really go get your beer for you

5040
01:36:27,290 --> 01:36:27,300
really go get your beer for you
 

5041
01:36:27,300 --> 01:36:29,629
really go get your beer for you
but there's things we need to figure out

5042
01:36:29,629 --> 01:36:29,639
but there's things we need to figure out
 

5043
01:36:29,639 --> 01:36:32,629
but there's things we need to figure out
still how to safely really safely if

5044
01:36:32,629 --> 01:36:32,639
still how to safely really safely if
 

5045
01:36:32,639 --> 01:36:34,370
still how to safely really safely if
you're going to be interacting with

5046
01:36:34,370 --> 01:36:34,380
you're going to be interacting with
 

5047
01:36:34,380 --> 01:36:38,149
you're going to be interacting with
children you better be safe and right

5048
01:36:38,149 --> 01:36:38,159
children you better be safe and right
 

5049
01:36:38,159 --> 01:36:40,490
children you better be safe and right
now we we count on a little bit of

5050
01:36:40,490 --> 01:36:40,500
now we we count on a little bit of
 

5051
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:42,229
now we we count on a little bit of
standoff distance between the robot and

5052
01:36:42,229 --> 01:36:42,239
standoff distance between the robot and
 

5053
01:36:42,239 --> 01:36:43,669
standoff distance between the robot and
people so that you don't pinch a finger

5054
01:36:43,669 --> 01:36:43,679
people so that you don't pinch a finger
 

5055
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:45,110
people so that you don't pinch a finger
you know in the robot

5056
01:36:45,110 --> 01:36:45,120
you know in the robot
 

5057
01:36:45,120 --> 01:36:46,970
you know in the robot
so you've got a lot of things you need

5058
01:36:46,970 --> 01:36:46,980
so you've got a lot of things you need
 

5059
01:36:46,980 --> 01:36:49,310
so you've got a lot of things you need
to go solve before you jump to that

5060
01:36:49,310 --> 01:36:49,320
to go solve before you jump to that
 

5061
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:51,649
to go solve before you jump to that
consumer level product well there's a

5062
01:36:51,649 --> 01:36:51,659
consumer level product well there's a
 

5063
01:36:51,659 --> 01:36:54,110
consumer level product well there's a
kind of trade-off in safety because it

5064
01:36:54,110 --> 01:36:54,120
kind of trade-off in safety because it
 

5065
01:36:54,120 --> 01:36:56,149
kind of trade-off in safety because it
feels like in the home

5066
01:36:56,149 --> 01:36:56,159
feels like in the home
 

5067
01:36:56,159 --> 01:36:58,490
feels like in the home
you can fall

5068
01:36:58,490 --> 01:36:58,500
you can fall
 

5069
01:36:58,500 --> 01:37:00,890
you can fall
like you're you don't have to be as good

5070
01:37:00,890 --> 01:37:00,900
like you're you don't have to be as good
 

5071
01:37:00,900 --> 01:37:04,970
like you're you don't have to be as good
at like you're allowed to fail in

5072
01:37:04,970 --> 01:37:04,980
at like you're allowed to fail in
 

5073
01:37:04,980 --> 01:37:07,250
at like you're allowed to fail in
different ways in more ways as long as

5074
01:37:07,250 --> 01:37:07,260
different ways in more ways as long as
 

5075
01:37:07,260 --> 01:37:10,250
different ways in more ways as long as
it's safe for the humans so it just

5076
01:37:10,250 --> 01:37:10,260
it's safe for the humans so it just
 

5077
01:37:10,260 --> 01:37:12,470
it's safe for the humans so it just
feels like an easier problem to solve

5078
01:37:12,470 --> 01:37:12,480
feels like an easier problem to solve
 

5079
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:13,490
feels like an easier problem to solve
because it feels like in the factory

5080
01:37:13,490 --> 01:37:13,500
because it feels like in the factory
 

5081
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:15,890
because it feels like in the factory
you're not allowed to fail

5082
01:37:15,890 --> 01:37:15,900
you're not allowed to fail
 

5083
01:37:15,900 --> 01:37:18,169
you're not allowed to fail
that may be true

5084
01:37:18,169 --> 01:37:18,179
that may be true
 

5085
01:37:18,179 --> 01:37:19,729
that may be true
um but I also think the variety of

5086
01:37:19,729 --> 01:37:19,739
um but I also think the variety of
 

5087
01:37:19,739 --> 01:37:23,209
um but I also think the variety of
things a consumer level robot would be

5088
01:37:23,209 --> 01:37:23,219
things a consumer level robot would be
 

5089
01:37:23,219 --> 01:37:25,070
things a consumer level robot would be
expected to do will also be quite broad

5090
01:37:25,070 --> 01:37:25,080
expected to do will also be quite broad
 

5091
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:26,930
expected to do will also be quite broad
yeah and they're going to want to get

5092
01:37:26,930 --> 01:37:26,940
yeah and they're going to want to get
 

5093
01:37:26,940 --> 01:37:28,370
yeah and they're going to want to get
the beer and know the difference between

5094
01:37:28,370 --> 01:37:28,380
the beer and know the difference between
 

5095
01:37:28,380 --> 01:37:32,090
the beer and know the difference between
the beer and a Coca-Cola or my snack

5096
01:37:32,090 --> 01:37:32,100
the beer and a Coca-Cola or my snack
 

5097
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:34,910
the beer and a Coca-Cola or my snack
and or you know they're all going to

5098
01:37:34,910 --> 01:37:34,920
and or you know they're all going to
 

5099
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:36,890
and or you know they're all going to
want to clean up the dishes

5100
01:37:36,890 --> 01:37:36,900
want to clean up the dishes
 

5101
01:37:36,900 --> 01:37:38,930
want to clean up the dishes
uh you know from the table without

5102
01:37:38,930 --> 01:37:38,940
uh you know from the table without
 

5103
01:37:38,940 --> 01:37:40,669
uh you know from the table without
breaking them

5104
01:37:40,669 --> 01:37:40,679
breaking them
 

5105
01:37:40,679 --> 01:37:43,550
breaking them
those are pretty complex tasks and so

5106
01:37:43,550 --> 01:37:43,560
those are pretty complex tasks and so
 

5107
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:45,290
those are pretty complex tasks and so
there's there's still work to be done

5108
01:37:45,290 --> 01:37:45,300
there's there's still work to be done
 

5109
01:37:45,300 --> 01:37:47,030
there's there's still work to be done
there so to push back on that here's

5110
01:37:47,030 --> 01:37:47,040
there so to push back on that here's
 

5111
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:48,530
there so to push back on that here's
what application I think they'll be very

5112
01:37:48,530 --> 01:37:48,540
what application I think they'll be very
 

5113
01:37:48,540 --> 01:37:50,870
what application I think they'll be very
interesting I think the application of

5114
01:37:50,870 --> 01:37:50,880
interesting I think the application of
 

5115
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:55,189
interesting I think the application of
being a pet a friend so like no tasks

5116
01:37:55,189 --> 01:37:55,199
being a pet a friend so like no tasks
 

5117
01:37:55,199 --> 01:37:56,149
being a pet a friend so like no tasks
foreign

5118
01:37:56,149 --> 01:37:56,159
foreign
 

5119
01:37:56,159 --> 01:37:59,750
foreign
just be cute because I not cute not cute

5120
01:37:59,750 --> 01:37:59,760
just be cute because I not cute not cute
 

5121

just cute a dog is a friend is a
 

5125
01:38:04,139 --> 01:38:06,110
just cute a dog is a friend is a
companion there's something about just

5126
01:38:06,110 --> 01:38:06,120
companion there's something about just
 

5127
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:08,149
companion there's something about just
having interacted with them and maybe

5128
01:38:08,149 --> 01:38:08,159
having interacted with them and maybe
 

5129
01:38:08,159 --> 01:38:10,550
having interacted with them and maybe
because I'm hanging out alone with robot

5130
01:38:10,550 --> 01:38:10,560
because I'm hanging out alone with robot
 

5131
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:12,830
because I'm hanging out alone with robot
dogs a little too much but like there's

5132
01:38:12,830 --> 01:38:12,840
dogs a little too much but like there's
 

5133
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:13,910
dogs a little too much but like there's

01:38:16,370 --> 01:38:16,380
there's a connection there and it feels

there's a connection there and it feels
like that connection is not

robots that can somehow communicate

5144
01:38:25,370 --> 01:38:25,380
robots that can somehow communicate
 

5145
01:38:25,380 --> 01:38:26,990
robots that can somehow communicate
through their physical gestures are

5146
01:38:26,990 --> 01:38:27,000
through their physical gestures are
 

5147
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,270
through their physical gestures are
you're going to be more attached to in

5148
01:38:29,270 --> 01:38:29,280
you're going to be more attached to in
 

5149
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:32,810
you're going to be more attached to in
the long run do you remember IBO the

5150
01:38:32,810 --> 01:38:32,820
the long run do you remember IBO the
 

5151
01:38:32,820 --> 01:38:34,970
the long run do you remember IBO the
Sony IBO yeah they sold over a hundred

5152
01:38:34,970 --> 01:38:34,980
Sony IBO yeah they sold over a hundred
 

5153
01:38:34,980 --> 01:38:37,850
Sony IBO yeah they sold over a hundred
thousand of those maybe 150 000.

5154
01:38:37,850 --> 01:38:37,860
thousand of those maybe 150 000.
 

5155
01:38:37,860 --> 01:38:39,470
thousand of those maybe 150 000.
you know what probably wasn't considered

5156
01:38:39,470 --> 01:38:39,480
you know what probably wasn't considered
 

5157
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:40,129
you know what probably wasn't considered
a

5158
01:38:40,129 --> 01:38:40,139
a
 

5159
01:38:40,139 --> 01:38:42,350
a
successful product for them

5160
01:38:42,350 --> 01:38:42,360
successful product for them
 

5161
01:38:42,360 --> 01:38:44,390
successful product for them
they suspended that eventually and then

5162
01:38:44,390 --> 01:38:44,400
they suspended that eventually and then
 

5163
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:45,770
they suspended that eventually and then
they brought it back so he brought it

5164
01:38:45,770 --> 01:38:45,780
they brought it back so he brought it
 

5165
01:38:45,780 --> 01:38:46,490
they brought it back so he brought it
back

5166
01:38:46,490 --> 01:38:46,500
back
 

5167
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:49,010
back
and people definitely you know treated

5168
01:38:49,010 --> 01:38:49,020
and people definitely you know treated
 

5169
01:38:49,020 --> 01:38:53,570
and people definitely you know treated
this as a as a pet as a as a companion

5170
01:38:53,570 --> 01:38:53,580
this as a as a pet as a as a companion
 

5171
01:38:53,580 --> 01:38:54,830
this as a as a pet as a as a companion
um and I think that will come around

5172
01:38:54,830 --> 01:38:54,840
um and I think that will come around
 

5173
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:57,050
um and I think that will come around
again

5174
01:38:57,050 --> 01:38:57,060
again
 

5175
01:38:57,060 --> 01:38:59,930
again
um will you get away without having any

5176
01:38:59,930 --> 01:38:59,940
um will you get away without having any
 

5177
01:38:59,940 --> 01:39:01,669
um will you get away without having any
other utility

5178
01:39:01,669 --> 01:39:01,679
other utility
 

5179
01:39:01,679 --> 01:39:03,530
other utility
maybe in a world where we can really

5180
01:39:03,530 --> 01:39:03,540
maybe in a world where we can really
 

5181
01:39:03,540 --> 01:39:05,930
maybe in a world where we can really
talk to our simple little pet because

5182
01:39:05,930 --> 01:39:05,940
talk to our simple little pet because
 

5183
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:08,330
talk to our simple little pet because
you know chat GPT or some other

5184
01:39:08,330 --> 01:39:08,340
you know chat GPT or some other
 

5185
01:39:08,340 --> 01:39:10,729
you know chat GPT or some other
generative AI has made it possible for

5186
01:39:10,729 --> 01:39:10,739
generative AI has made it possible for
 

5187
01:39:10,739 --> 01:39:13,070
generative AI has made it possible for
you to really talk and what seems like a

5188
01:39:13,070 --> 01:39:13,080
you to really talk and what seems like a
 

5189
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:16,250
you to really talk and what seems like a
meaningful way maybe that'll open the

5190
01:39:16,250 --> 01:39:16,260
meaningful way maybe that'll open the
 

5191
01:39:16,260 --> 01:39:17,930
meaningful way maybe that'll open the
social robot

5192
01:39:17,930 --> 01:39:17,940
social robot
 

5193
01:39:17,940 --> 01:39:20,330
social robot
up again

5194
01:39:20,330 --> 01:39:20,340
up again
 

5195
01:39:20,340 --> 01:39:20,990
up again
um

5196
01:39:20,990 --> 01:39:21,000
um
 

5197
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:22,910
um
that's probably not a path we're going

5198
01:39:22,910 --> 01:39:22,920
that's probably not a path we're going
 

5199
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:25,729
that's probably not a path we're going
to go down because again we're so

5200
01:39:25,729 --> 01:39:25,739
to go down because again we're so
 

5201
01:39:25,739 --> 01:39:28,550
to go down because again we're so
focused on performance and utility

5202
01:39:28,550 --> 01:39:28,560
focused on performance and utility
 

5203
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:31,129
focused on performance and utility
we can add those other things also but

5204
01:39:31,129 --> 01:39:31,139
we can add those other things also but
 

5205
01:39:31,139 --> 01:39:32,390
we can add those other things also but
we really want to start from that

5206
01:39:32,390 --> 01:39:32,400
we really want to start from that
 

5207
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:35,570
we really want to start from that

I also want to predict that you're wrong

5210
01:39:38,330 --> 01:39:38,340
I also want to predict that you're wrong
 

5211
01:39:38,340 --> 01:39:41,629
I also want to predict that you're wrong
on that so which is that the very path

5212
01:39:41,629 --> 01:39:41,639
on that so which is that the very path
 

5213
01:39:41,639 --> 01:39:43,189
on that so which is that the very path
you're taking which is creating a great

5214
01:39:43,189 --> 01:39:43,199
you're taking which is creating a great
 

5215
01:39:43,199 --> 01:39:46,850
you're taking which is creating a great
robot platform will very easily take a

5216
01:39:46,850 --> 01:39:46,860
robot platform will very easily take a
 

5217
01:39:46,860 --> 01:39:50,530
robot platform will very easily take a
leap to adding uh

5218
01:39:50,530 --> 01:39:50,540
leap to adding uh
 

5219
01:39:50,540 --> 01:39:53,990
leap to adding uh
capability maybe gpt5 and there's just

5220
01:39:53,990 --> 01:39:54,000
capability maybe gpt5 and there's just
 

5221
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:55,910
capability maybe gpt5 and there's just
so many open source Alternatives you

5222
01:39:55,910 --> 01:39:55,920
so many open source Alternatives you
 

5223
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:59,030
so many open source Alternatives you
could just plop that on top of spot and

5224
01:39:59,030 --> 01:39:59,040
could just plop that on top of spot and
 

5225
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:00,950
could just plop that on top of spot and
because you have this robust platform

5226
01:40:00,950 --> 01:40:00,960
because you have this robust platform
 

5227
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:02,689
because you have this robust platform
and you're figuring out how to mass

5228
01:40:02,689 --> 01:40:02,699
and you're figuring out how to mass
 

5229
01:40:02,699 --> 01:40:04,430
and you're figuring out how to mass
manufacture it and how to drive the cost

5230
01:40:04,430 --> 01:40:04,440
manufacture it and how to drive the cost
 

5231
01:40:04,440 --> 01:40:06,530
manufacture it and how to drive the cost
down and how to make it you know

5232
01:40:06,530 --> 01:40:06,540
down and how to make it you know
 

5233
01:40:06,540 --> 01:40:08,030
down and how to make it you know
reliable all those kinds of things it'll

5234
01:40:08,030 --> 01:40:08,040
reliable all those kinds of things it'll
 

5235
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:10,310
reliable all those kinds of things it'll
be a natural transition to where just

and then just talk about this the
 

5267
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:50,090
and then just talk about this the
state of the world

5268

5269
01:40:50,100 --> 01:40:52,430

I mean there's a deep loneliness within

5270
01:40:52,430 --> 01:40:52,440
I mean there's a deep loneliness within
 

5271
01:40:52,440 --> 01:40:54,169
I mean there's a deep loneliness within
all of us and I think

5272
01:40:54,169 --> 01:40:54,179
all of us and I think
 

5273
01:40:54,179 --> 01:40:56,990
all of us and I think
uh a beer and a good chat solves so much

5274
01:40:56,990 --> 01:40:57,000
uh a beer and a good chat solves so much
 

5275
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,750
uh a beer and a good chat solves so much
of it or take takes us a long way to

5276
01:40:59,750 --> 01:40:59,760
of it or take takes us a long way to
 

5277
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:02,689
of it or take takes us a long way to
solving uh it'll be interesting to see

5278
01:41:02,689 --> 01:41:02,699
solving uh it'll be interesting to see
 

5279
01:41:02,699 --> 01:41:06,229
solving uh it'll be interesting to see
um you know when

um you know when
 

5281
01:41:06,239 --> 01:41:09,770
um you know when
when a generative AI can give you that

5282
01:41:09,770 --> 01:41:09,780
when a generative AI can give you that
 

5283
01:41:09,780 --> 01:41:12,830

01:41:29,990 --> 01:41:30,000
what love is in in many cases some of
 

5301
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,610

the deepest friendships you have is
having gone through a difficult time

5304
01:41:33,290 --> 01:41:33,300
having gone through a difficult time
 

5305
01:41:33,300 --> 01:41:35,870
having gone through a difficult time
together and having a shared memory of

5306
01:41:35,870 --> 01:41:35,880
together and having a shared memory of
 

5307
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:38,270
together and having a shared memory of
an amazing time or a difficult time

5308
01:41:38,270 --> 01:41:38,280
an amazing time or a difficult time
 

5309
01:41:38,280 --> 01:41:39,709
an amazing time or a difficult time
and kind of

5310
01:41:39,709 --> 01:41:39,719
and kind of
 

5311
01:41:39,719 --> 01:41:42,590
and kind of
that memory creating this like

5312
01:41:42,590 --> 01:41:42,600
that memory creating this like
 

5313
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:44,750
that memory creating this like
Foundation based on which you can then

5314
01:41:44,750 --> 01:41:44,760
Foundation based on which you can then
 

5315
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:47,030
Foundation based on which you can then
experience the world together the silly

5316
01:41:47,030 --> 01:41:47,040
experience the world together the silly
 

5317
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:49,070
experience the world together the silly
the mundane stuff of day-to-day is

5318
01:41:49,070 --> 01:41:49,080
the mundane stuff of day-to-day is
 

5319
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:50,750
the mundane stuff of day-to-day is
somehow built on a foundation of having

5320
01:41:50,750 --> 01:41:50,760
somehow built on a foundation of having
 

5321
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:53,030
somehow built on a foundation of having
gone through some in the past and

5322
01:41:53,030 --> 01:41:53,040
gone through some in the past and
 

5323
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:54,950
gone through some in the past and
the the current systems are not

5324
01:41:54,950 --> 01:41:54,960
the the current systems are not
 

5325
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:57,229
the the current systems are not
personalized in that way but I think

5326
01:41:57,229 --> 01:41:57,239
personalized in that way but I think
 

5327
01:41:57,239 --> 01:41:58,910
personalized in that way but I think
that's a technical problem not uh some

5328
01:41:58,910 --> 01:41:58,920
that's a technical problem not uh some
 

5329
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:02,030
that's a technical problem not uh some
kind of fundamental limitation so I'll

5330
01:42:02,030 --> 01:42:02,040
kind of fundamental limitation so I'll
 

5331
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:04,010
kind of fundamental limitation so I'll
combine that with an embodied robot like

5332
01:42:04,010 --> 01:42:04,020
combine that with an embodied robot like
 

5333
01:42:04,020 --> 01:42:07,790
combine that with an embodied robot like
spot which already has magic in its

5334
01:42:07,790 --> 01:42:07,800
spot which already has magic in its
 

5335
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:10,669
spot which already has magic in its
movement I think uh it's a very

5336
01:42:10,669 --> 01:42:10,679
movement I think uh it's a very
 

5337
01:42:10,679 --> 01:42:12,350
movement I think uh it's a very
interesting possibility of what where

5338
01:42:12,350 --> 01:42:12,360
interesting possibility of what where
 

5339
01:42:12,360 --> 01:42:14,330
interesting possibility of what where
that takes us but of course you have to

5340
01:42:14,330 --> 01:42:14,340
that takes us but of course you have to
 

5341
01:42:14,340 --> 01:42:16,250
that takes us but of course you have to
build that on top of a company that's

5342
01:42:16,250 --> 01:42:16,260
build that on top of a company that's
 

5343
01:42:16,260 --> 01:42:17,570
build that on top of a company that's
making money

5344
01:42:17,570 --> 01:42:17,580
making money
 

5345
01:42:17,580 --> 01:42:19,790
making money
with real application with real

5346
01:42:19,790 --> 01:42:19,800
with real application with real
 

5347
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:22,490
with real application with real
customers and with robots that are safe

5348
01:42:22,490 --> 01:42:22,500
customers and with robots that are safe
 

5349
01:42:22,500 --> 01:42:25,550
customers and with robots that are safe
and at work and reliable and uh in

5350
01:42:25,550 --> 01:42:25,560
and at work and reliable and uh in
 

5351
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:27,229
and at work and reliable and uh in
manufactured scale

5352
01:42:27,229 --> 01:42:27,239
manufactured scale
 

5353
01:42:27,239 --> 01:42:29,109
manufactured scale
and I think we're in a unique position

5354
01:42:29,109 --> 01:42:29,119
and I think we're in a unique position
 

5355
01:42:29,119 --> 01:42:33,229
and I think we're in a unique position
in that uh because of our investors

5356
01:42:33,229 --> 01:42:33,239
in that uh because of our investors
 

5357
01:42:33,239 --> 01:42:35,570
in that uh because of our investors
primarily Hyundai but also SoftBank

5358
01:42:35,570 --> 01:42:35,580
primarily Hyundai but also SoftBank
 

5359
01:42:35,580 --> 01:42:38,330
primarily Hyundai but also SoftBank
still owns 20 of us

5360
01:42:38,330 --> 01:42:38,340
still owns 20 of us
 

5361
01:42:38,340 --> 01:42:40,790
still owns 20 of us
um they don't they're not totally

01:42:44,990 --> 01:42:45,000
driving us to profitability as soon as
 

5367
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,570
driving us to profitability as soon as
possible that's not the goal the goal

5368
01:42:47,570 --> 01:42:47,580
possible that's not the goal the goal
 

5369
01:42:47,580 --> 01:42:50,030
possible that's not the goal the goal
really is a longer term vision of

5370
01:42:50,030 --> 01:42:50,040
really is a longer term vision of
 

5371
01:42:50,040 --> 01:42:51,169
really is a longer term vision of
creating

5372

you know what does mobility mean in the

5374
01:42:53,209 --> 01:42:53,219
you know what does mobility mean in the
 

5375
01:42:53,219 --> 01:42:55,970
you know what does mobility mean in the
future what are how is this mobile robot

5376
01:42:55,970 --> 01:42:55,980
future what are how is this mobile robot
 

5377
01:42:55,980 --> 01:42:58,430
future what are how is this mobile robot
technology going to influence

5378
01:42:58,430 --> 01:42:58,440
technology going to influence
 

5379
01:42:58,440 --> 01:43:01,189
technology going to influence
um us can we and can we shape that and

5380
01:43:01,189 --> 01:43:01,199
um us can we and can we shape that and
 

5381
01:43:01,199 --> 01:43:04,189
um us can we and can we shape that and
they want both and so I we are as a

5382
01:43:04,189 --> 01:43:04,199
they want both and so I we are as a
 

5383
01:43:04,199 --> 01:43:05,209
they want both and so I we are as a
company are trying to strike that

5384
01:43:05,209 --> 01:43:05,219
company are trying to strike that
 

5385
01:43:05,219 --> 01:43:07,370
company are trying to strike that
balance between let's build a business

5386
01:43:07,370 --> 01:43:07,380
balance between let's build a business
 

5387
01:43:07,380 --> 01:43:08,990
balance between let's build a business
that makes money

5388
01:43:08,990 --> 01:43:09,000
that makes money
 

5389
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,030
that makes money
I've been describing that to my own team

5390
01:43:11,030 --> 01:43:11,040
I've been describing that to my own team
 

5391
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:11,930
I've been describing that to my own team
as

5392
01:43:11,930 --> 01:43:11,940
as
 

5393
01:43:11,940 --> 01:43:14,629
as
uh self-destination if I want to if I

5394
01:43:14,629 --> 01:43:14,639
uh self-destination if I want to if I
 

5395
01:43:14,639 --> 01:43:16,430
uh self-destination if I want to if I
want to drive my own ship we need to

5396
01:43:16,430 --> 01:43:16,440
want to drive my own ship we need to
 

5397
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:18,229
want to drive my own ship we need to
have a business that's profitable in the

5398
01:43:18,229 --> 01:43:18,239
have a business that's profitable in the
 

5399
01:43:18,239 --> 01:43:19,490
have a business that's profitable in the
end otherwise somebody else is going to

5400
01:43:19,490 --> 01:43:19,500
end otherwise somebody else is going to
 

5401
01:43:19,500 --> 01:43:21,109
end otherwise somebody else is going to
drive the ship for us

5402
01:43:21,109 --> 01:43:21,119
drive the ship for us
 

5403
01:43:21,119 --> 01:43:23,390
drive the ship for us
so that's really important

5404
01:43:23,390 --> 01:43:23,400
so that's really important
 

5405
01:43:23,400 --> 01:43:26,570
so that's really important
but we're going to retain

5406
01:43:26,570 --> 01:43:26,580
but we're going to retain
 

5407
01:43:26,580 --> 01:43:28,609
but we're going to retain
the aspiration that we're going to build

5408
01:43:28,609 --> 01:43:28,619
the aspiration that we're going to build
 

5409
01:43:28,619 --> 01:43:30,410
the aspiration that we're going to build
the next generation of Technology at the

5410
01:43:30,410 --> 01:43:30,420
the next generation of Technology at the
 

5411
01:43:30,420 --> 01:43:32,570
the next generation of Technology at the
same time and the real trick will be if

5412
01:43:32,570 --> 01:43:32,580
same time and the real trick will be if
 

5413
01:43:32,580 --> 01:43:34,609
same time and the real trick will be if
we can do both

5414
01:43:34,609 --> 01:43:34,619
we can do both
 

5415
01:43:34,619 --> 01:43:36,649
we can do both
uh speaking of ships

5416
01:43:36,649 --> 01:43:36,659
uh speaking of ships
 

5417
01:43:36,659 --> 01:43:39,890
uh speaking of ships
uh let me ask you about a competitor

5418
01:43:39,890 --> 01:43:39,900
uh let me ask you about a competitor
 

5419
01:43:39,900 --> 01:43:41,750
uh let me ask you about a competitor
and somebody's become a friend

5420
01:43:41,750 --> 01:43:41,760
and somebody's become a friend
 

5421
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:44,990
and somebody's become a friend
so Elon Musk Contessa have announced

5422
01:43:44,990 --> 01:43:45,000
so Elon Musk Contessa have announced
 

5423
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:46,970
so Elon Musk Contessa have announced
have been in the early days of building

5424
01:43:46,970 --> 01:43:46,980
have been in the early days of building
 

5425
01:43:46,980 --> 01:43:50,390
have been in the early days of building
a humanoid robot how does that change

5426
01:43:50,390 --> 01:43:50,400
a humanoid robot how does that change
 

5427
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:51,970
a humanoid robot how does that change
the landscape of

5428
01:43:51,970 --> 01:43:51,980
the landscape of
 

5429
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:55,729
the landscape of
of your work so so there's sort of from

5430
01:43:55,729 --> 01:43:55,739
of your work so so there's sort of from
 

5431
01:43:55,739 --> 01:43:59,450
of your work so so there's sort of from
the outside perspective it seems like

5432
01:43:59,450 --> 01:43:59,460
the outside perspective it seems like
 

5433
01:43:59,460 --> 01:44:02,030
the outside perspective it seems like
well from a fan as a fan of Robotics it

5434
01:44:02,030 --> 01:44:02,040
well from a fan as a fan of Robotics it
 

5435
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:04,010
well from a fan as a fan of Robotics it
just seems exciting all right very

5436
01:44:04,010 --> 01:44:04,020
just seems exciting all right very
 

5437
01:44:04,020 --> 01:44:06,830
just seems exciting all right very
exciting right when when Elon speaks

5438
01:44:06,830 --> 01:44:06,840
exciting right when when Elon speaks
 

5439
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:08,390
exciting right when when Elon speaks
people listen

5440
01:44:08,390 --> 01:44:08,400
people listen
 

5441
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:11,750
people listen
and so uh it suddenly brought a bright

5442
01:44:11,750 --> 01:44:11,760
and so uh it suddenly brought a bright
 

5443
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:13,609
and so uh it suddenly brought a bright
light onto the work that we've been

5444
01:44:13,609 --> 01:44:13,619
light onto the work that we've been
 

5445
01:44:13,619 --> 01:44:15,950
light onto the work that we've been
doing you know for over a decade

5446
01:44:15,950 --> 01:44:15,960
doing you know for over a decade
 

5447
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:17,689
doing you know for over a decade
and

5448
01:44:17,689 --> 01:44:17,699
and
 

5449
01:44:17,699 --> 01:44:19,310
and
um and I think that's only going to help

5450
01:44:19,310 --> 01:44:19,320
um and I think that's only going to help
 

5451
01:44:19,320 --> 01:44:22,250
um and I think that's only going to help
and in fact what we've seen is that uh

5452
01:44:22,250 --> 01:44:22,260
and in fact what we've seen is that uh
 

5453
01:44:22,260 --> 01:44:25,250
and in fact what we've seen is that uh
in addition to Tesla uh we're seeing a

5454
01:44:25,250 --> 01:44:25,260
in addition to Tesla uh we're seeing a
 

5455
01:44:25,260 --> 01:44:28,570
in addition to Tesla uh we're seeing a
proliferation of uh robotic companies

5456
01:44:28,570 --> 01:44:28,580
proliferation of uh robotic companies
 

5457
01:44:28,580 --> 01:44:32,090
proliferation of uh robotic companies
arise including humanoid yes oh well

5458
01:44:32,090 --> 01:44:32,100
arise including humanoid yes oh well
 

5459
01:44:32,100 --> 01:44:35,510
arise including humanoid yes oh well
yeah so and um interestingly many of

5460
01:44:35,510 --> 01:44:35,520
yeah so and um interestingly many of
 

5461
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:38,030
yeah so and um interestingly many of
them uh as they're you know raising

5462
01:44:38,030 --> 01:44:38,040
them uh as they're you know raising
 

5463
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:41,149
them uh as they're you know raising
money for example will claim whether or

5464
01:44:41,149 --> 01:44:41,159
money for example will claim whether or
 

5465
01:44:41,159 --> 01:44:42,770
money for example will claim whether or
not they have a former Boston Dynamics

5466
01:44:42,770 --> 01:44:42,780
not they have a former Boston Dynamics
 

5467
01:44:42,780 --> 01:44:45,669
not they have a former Boston Dynamics
employee on their staff as a criteria

5468
01:44:45,669 --> 01:44:45,679
employee on their staff as a criteria
 

5469
01:44:45,679 --> 01:44:49,609
employee on their staff as a criteria
yeah that's true that's uh I I I would

5470
01:44:49,609 --> 01:44:49,619
yeah that's true that's uh I I I would
 

5471
01:44:49,619 --> 01:44:51,950
yeah that's true that's uh I I I would
do that as a company yeah for sure yeah

5472
01:44:51,950 --> 01:44:51,960
do that as a company yeah for sure yeah
 

5473
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:54,410
do that as a company yeah for sure yeah
so it shows you're legit yeah so you

5474
01:44:54,410 --> 01:44:54,420
so it shows you're legit yeah so you
 

5475

know what it's bring it has brung a
 

5477
01:44:57,300 --> 01:44:58,850
know what it's bring it has brung a
tremendous validation to what we're

you know maybe he implied that the
 

5497
01:45:20,340 --> 01:45:24,050
you know maybe he implied that the
problem is solvable in your term which

so um I think Elon is known for sort of

5506
01:45:36,470 --> 01:45:36,480
so um I think Elon is known for sort of
 

5507
01:45:36,480 --> 01:45:37,970
so um I think Elon is known for sort of
setting these kinds of incredible

5508

ambitious goals
 

5511
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:43,129
ambitious goals
um maybe missing deadlines but actually

5512
01:45:43,129 --> 01:45:43,139
um maybe missing deadlines but actually
 

5513
01:45:43,139 --> 01:45:45,590
um maybe missing deadlines but actually
pushing not just the particular team he

5514
01:45:45,590 --> 01:45:45,600
pushing not just the particular team he
 

5515
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:47,450
pushing not just the particular team he
leads but the entire world

5516

leads but the entire world
 

5517
01:45:47,460 --> 01:45:51,950
leads but the entire world
to like accomplishing those do you see

5518
01:45:51,950 --> 01:45:51,960
to like accomplishing those do you see
 

5519
01:45:51,960 --> 01:45:53,750
to like accomplishing those do you see
you see Boston Dynamics in the near

5520
01:45:53,750 --> 01:45:53,760
you see Boston Dynamics in the near
 

5521
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:55,669
you see Boston Dynamics in the near
future being pushed in that kind of way

5522
01:45:55,669 --> 01:45:55,679
future being pushed in that kind of way
 

5523
01:45:55,679 --> 01:45:58,250
future being pushed in that kind of way
like this excitement of competition kind

5524
01:45:58,250 --> 01:45:58,260
like this excitement of competition kind
 

5525
01:45:58,260 --> 01:45:59,450
like this excitement of competition kind
of

5526
01:45:59,450 --> 01:45:59,460
of
 

5527
01:45:59,460 --> 01:46:00,109
of
um

5528
01:46:00,109 --> 01:46:00,119
um
 

5529
01:46:00,119 --> 01:46:03,050
um
pushing Atlas maybe to uh do more cool

5530
01:46:03,050 --> 01:46:03,060
pushing Atlas maybe to uh do more cool
 

5531
01:46:03,060 --> 01:46:05,510
pushing Atlas maybe to uh do more cool
stuff trying to drive the cost of Atlas

5532
01:46:05,510 --> 01:46:05,520
stuff trying to drive the cost of Atlas
 

5533
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:08,930
stuff trying to drive the cost of Atlas
down perhaps or um I mean I guess I want

5534
01:46:08,930 --> 01:46:08,940
down perhaps or um I mean I guess I want
 

5535
01:46:08,940 --> 01:46:11,090
down perhaps or um I mean I guess I want
to I want to ask if there's

5536
01:46:11,090 --> 01:46:11,100
to I want to ask if there's
 

5537
01:46:11,100 --> 01:46:13,550
to I want to ask if there's
some kind of exciting

5538
01:46:13,550 --> 01:46:13,560
some kind of exciting
 

5539
01:46:13,560 --> 01:46:18,350
some kind of exciting
uh energy in Boston Dynamics uh due to

5540
01:46:18,350 --> 01:46:18,360
uh energy in Boston Dynamics uh due to
 

5541
01:46:18,360 --> 01:46:20,209
uh energy in Boston Dynamics uh due to
this a little bit of competition oh yeah

5542
01:46:20,209 --> 01:46:20,219
this a little bit of competition oh yeah
 

5543
01:46:20,219 --> 01:46:21,709
this a little bit of competition oh yeah
definitely

5544
01:46:21,709 --> 01:46:21,719
definitely
 

5545
01:46:21,719 --> 01:46:22,310
definitely
um

5546
01:46:22,310 --> 01:46:22,320
um
 

5547
01:46:22,320 --> 01:46:24,410
um
when we released our most recent video

5548
01:46:24,410 --> 01:46:24,420
when we released our most recent video
 

5549
01:46:24,420 --> 01:46:27,530
when we released our most recent video
of Atlas you know I think you'd seen it

5550
01:46:27,530 --> 01:46:27,540
of Atlas you know I think you'd seen it
 

5551
01:46:27,540 --> 01:46:29,510
of Atlas you know I think you'd seen it
the scaffolding and throwing the box of

5552
01:46:29,510 --> 01:46:29,520
the scaffolding and throwing the box of
 

5553
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:31,550
the scaffolding and throwing the box of
Tools around and then doing the flip at

5554
01:46:31,550 --> 01:46:31,560
Tools around and then doing the flip at
 

5555
01:46:31,560 --> 01:46:33,770
Tools around and then doing the flip at
the end yeah we were trying to show the

5556
01:46:33,770 --> 01:46:33,780
the end yeah we were trying to show the
 

5557
01:46:33,780 --> 01:46:36,709
the end yeah we were trying to show the
world that not only can we do this

5558
01:46:36,709 --> 01:46:36,719
world that not only can we do this
 

5559
01:46:36,719 --> 01:46:39,229
world that not only can we do this
parkour Mobility thing but we can pick

5560
01:46:39,229 --> 01:46:39,239
parkour Mobility thing but we can pick
 

5561
01:46:39,239 --> 01:46:40,970
parkour Mobility thing but we can pick
up and move heavy things

5562
01:46:40,970 --> 01:46:40,980
up and move heavy things
 

5563
01:46:40,980 --> 01:46:43,910
up and move heavy things
because uh if you're going to work in a

5564
01:46:43,910 --> 01:46:43,920
because uh if you're going to work in a
 

5565
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:45,770
because uh if you're going to work in a
manufacturing environment that's what

5566
01:46:45,770 --> 01:46:45,780
manufacturing environment that's what
 

5567
01:46:45,780 --> 01:46:49,310
manufacturing environment that's what
you got to be able to do and for the

5568
01:46:49,310 --> 01:46:49,320
you got to be able to do and for the
 

5569
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:51,350
you got to be able to do and for the
reasons I explained to you earlier it's

5570
01:46:51,350 --> 01:46:51,360
reasons I explained to you earlier it's
 

5571
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:53,570
reasons I explained to you earlier it's
not trivial to do so you know changing

5572
01:46:53,570 --> 01:46:53,580
not trivial to do so you know changing
 

5573
01:46:53,580 --> 01:46:56,330
not trivial to do so you know changing
the center of mass uh uh you know by

5574
01:46:56,330 --> 01:46:56,340
the center of mass uh uh you know by
 

5575
01:46:56,340 --> 01:46:57,890
the center of mass uh uh you know by
picking up a 50 pound

5576
01:46:57,890 --> 01:46:57,900
picking up a 50 pound
 

5577
01:46:57,900 --> 01:47:00,410
picking up a 50 pound
black you know for a robot that weighs

5578
01:47:00,410 --> 01:47:00,420
black you know for a robot that weighs
 

5579
01:47:00,420 --> 01:47:02,209
black you know for a robot that weighs
150 pounds

5580
01:47:02,209 --> 01:47:02,219
150 pounds
 

5581
01:47:02,219 --> 01:47:05,209
150 pounds
that's a lot to accommodate so we're

5582
01:47:05,209 --> 01:47:05,219
that's a lot to accommodate so we're
 

5583
01:47:05,219 --> 01:47:09,050
that's a lot to accommodate so we're
trying to show that we can do that and

5584
01:47:09,050 --> 01:47:09,060
trying to show that we can do that and
 

5585
01:47:09,060 --> 01:47:11,810
trying to show that we can do that and
um so it's totally been energizing you

5586
01:47:11,810 --> 01:47:11,820
um so it's totally been energizing you
 

5587
01:47:11,820 --> 01:47:13,250
um so it's totally been energizing you
know we see

5588
01:47:13,250 --> 01:47:13,260
know we see
 

5589
01:47:13,260 --> 01:47:16,609
know we see
the next phase of Atlas being more

5590
01:47:16,609 --> 01:47:16,619
the next phase of Atlas being more
 

5591
01:47:16,619 --> 01:47:18,709
the next phase of Atlas being more
dexterous hands that can manipulate and

5592
01:47:18,709 --> 01:47:18,719
dexterous hands that can manipulate and
 

5593
01:47:18,719 --> 01:47:20,570
dexterous hands that can manipulate and
grab more things that we're going to

5594
01:47:20,570 --> 01:47:20,580
grab more things that we're going to
 

5595
01:47:20,580 --> 01:47:23,390
grab more things that we're going to
start by moving big things around that

5596
01:47:23,390 --> 01:47:23,400
start by moving big things around that
 

5597
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:25,970
start by moving big things around that
are heavy and that affect balance and

5598
01:47:25,970 --> 01:47:25,980
are heavy and that affect balance and
 

5599
01:47:25,980 --> 01:47:28,490
are heavy and that affect balance and
why is that well really tiny dexterous

5600
01:47:28,490 --> 01:47:28,500
why is that well really tiny dexterous
 

5601
01:47:28,500 --> 01:47:30,950
why is that well really tiny dexterous
things probably are going to be hard for

5602
01:47:30,950 --> 01:47:30,960
things probably are going to be hard for
 

5603
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:32,689
things probably are going to be hard for
a while yet and you know maybe you could

5604
01:47:32,689 --> 01:47:32,699
a while yet and you know maybe you could
 

5605
01:47:32,699 --> 01:47:35,270
a while yet and you know maybe you could
go build a special purpose

5606
01:47:35,270 --> 01:47:35,280
go build a special purpose
 

5607
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:39,050
go build a special purpose
robot arm you know for for stuffing you

5608
01:47:39,050 --> 01:47:39,060
robot arm you know for for stuffing you
 

5609
01:47:39,060 --> 01:47:41,689
robot arm you know for for stuffing you
know chips into Electronics boards but

5610
01:47:41,689 --> 01:47:41,699
know chips into Electronics boards but
 

5611
01:47:41,699 --> 01:47:43,910
know chips into Electronics boards but
we don't really want to do really fine

5612
01:47:43,910 --> 01:47:43,920
we don't really want to do really fine
 

5613
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:47,090
we don't really want to do really fine
work like that I think more coursework

5614
01:47:47,090 --> 01:47:47,100
work like that I think more coursework
 

5615
01:47:47,100 --> 01:47:49,070
work like that I think more coursework
where you're using two hands to pick up

5616
01:47:49,070 --> 01:47:49,080
where you're using two hands to pick up
 

5617
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:51,649
where you're using two hands to pick up
and balance an unwieldy thing maybe in a

5618
01:47:51,649 --> 01:47:51,659
and balance an unwieldy thing maybe in a
 

5619
01:47:51,659 --> 01:47:53,390
and balance an unwieldy thing maybe in a
manufacturing environment maybe in a

5620
01:47:53,390 --> 01:47:53,400
manufacturing environment maybe in a
 

5621
01:47:53,400 --> 01:47:55,430
manufacturing environment maybe in a
construction environment those are the

5622
01:47:55,430 --> 01:47:55,440
construction environment those are the
 

5623
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:57,649
construction environment those are the
things that we think robots are going to

5624
01:47:57,649 --> 01:47:57,659
things that we think robots are going to
 

5625
01:47:57,659 --> 01:47:59,270
things that we think robots are going to
be able to do with the level of

5626
01:47:59,270 --> 01:47:59,280
be able to do with the level of
 

5627
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:01,010
be able to do with the level of
dexterity that they're going to have in

5628
01:48:01,010 --> 01:48:01,020
dexterity that they're going to have in
 

5629
01:48:01,020 --> 01:48:03,290
dexterity that they're going to have in
the next few years and that's the that's

5630
01:48:03,290 --> 01:48:03,300
the next few years and that's the that's
 

5631
01:48:03,300 --> 01:48:05,689
the next few years and that's the that's
where we're headed and and I think and

5632
01:48:05,689 --> 01:48:05,699
where we're headed and and I think and
 

5633
01:48:05,699 --> 01:48:07,250
where we're headed and and I think and
you know Elon has seen the same thing

5634
01:48:07,250 --> 01:48:07,260
you know Elon has seen the same thing
 

5635
01:48:07,260 --> 01:48:08,629
you know Elon has seen the same thing
right he's talking about using the

5636
01:48:08,629 --> 01:48:08,639
right he's talking about using the
 

5637
01:48:08,639 --> 01:48:11,510
right he's talking about using the
robots in a manufacturing environment we

5638
01:48:11,510 --> 01:48:11,520
robots in a manufacturing environment we
 

5639
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:12,709
robots in a manufacturing environment we
think there's something very interesting

5640
01:48:12,709 --> 01:48:12,719
think there's something very interesting
 

5641
01:48:12,719 --> 01:48:15,890
think there's something very interesting
there about having this two-armed robot

5642
01:48:15,890 --> 01:48:15,900
there about having this two-armed robot
 

5643
01:48:15,900 --> 01:48:18,189
there about having this two-armed robot
because when you have two arms you can

5644
01:48:18,189 --> 01:48:18,199
because when you have two arms you can
 

5645
01:48:18,199 --> 01:48:20,209
because when you have two arms you can
transfer a thing from one hand to the

5646
01:48:20,209 --> 01:48:20,219
transfer a thing from one hand to the
 

5647
01:48:20,219 --> 01:48:21,950
transfer a thing from one hand to the
other you can turn it around you know

5648
01:48:21,950 --> 01:48:21,960
other you can turn it around you know
 

5649
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:24,050
other you can turn it around you know
you can you can reorient it in a way

5650
01:48:24,050 --> 01:48:24,060
you can you can reorient it in a way
 

5651
01:48:24,060 --> 01:48:25,370
you can you can reorient it in a way
that you can't do it if you just have

5652
01:48:25,370 --> 01:48:25,380
that you can't do it if you just have
 

5653
01:48:25,380 --> 01:48:27,709
that you can't do it if you just have
one hand on it and so there's a lot that

5654
01:48:27,709 --> 01:48:27,719
one hand on it and so there's a lot that
 

5655
01:48:27,719 --> 01:48:30,530
one hand on it and so there's a lot that
extra arm brings to the table so I think

5656
01:48:30,530 --> 01:48:30,540
extra arm brings to the table so I think
 

5657
01:48:30,540 --> 01:48:32,629
extra arm brings to the table so I think
in terms of mission

5658
01:48:32,629 --> 01:48:32,639
in terms of mission
 

5659
01:48:32,639 --> 01:48:34,669
in terms of mission
you you mentioned Boston and Amex really

5660
01:48:34,669 --> 01:48:34,679
you you mentioned Boston and Amex really
 

5661
01:48:34,679 --> 01:48:36,350
you you mentioned Boston and Amex really
wants to see what are the what's the

5662
01:48:36,350 --> 01:48:36,360
wants to see what are the what's the
 

5663
01:48:36,360 --> 01:48:38,689
wants to see what are the what's the
limits of what's possible and so the

5664
01:48:38,689 --> 01:48:38,699
limits of what's possible and so the
 

5665
01:48:38,699 --> 01:48:40,609
limits of what's possible and so the
cost comes second

5666
01:48:40,609 --> 01:48:40,619
cost comes second
 

5667
01:48:40,619 --> 01:48:43,189
cost comes second
or it's a component but first figure out

5668
01:48:43,189 --> 01:48:43,199
or it's a component but first figure out
 

5669
01:48:43,199 --> 01:48:44,629
or it's a component but first figure out
what are the limitations I think with

5670
01:48:44,629 --> 01:48:44,639
what are the limitations I think with
 

5671
01:48:44,639 --> 01:48:46,510
what are the limitations I think with
Elon he's really dragging the cost down

5672
01:48:46,510 --> 01:48:46,520
Elon he's really dragging the cost down
 

5673
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:49,729
Elon he's really dragging the cost down
is there some inspiration some lessons

5674
01:48:49,729 --> 01:48:49,739
is there some inspiration some lessons
 

5675
01:48:49,739 --> 01:48:51,770
is there some inspiration some lessons
you see there

5676
01:48:51,770 --> 01:48:51,780
you see there
 

5677
01:48:51,780 --> 01:48:54,590
you see there
um of the challenge of driving the cost

5678
01:48:54,590 --> 01:48:54,600
um of the challenge of driving the cost
 

5679
01:48:54,600 --> 01:48:56,270
um of the challenge of driving the cost
down especially with Atlas with a

5680
01:48:56,270 --> 01:48:56,280
down especially with Atlas with a
 

5681
01:48:56,280 --> 01:48:58,129
down especially with Atlas with a
humanoid robot well I think the thing

5682
01:48:58,129 --> 01:48:58,139
humanoid robot well I think the thing
 

5683
01:48:58,139 --> 01:49:00,109
humanoid robot well I think the thing
that he's certainly been learning by

5684
01:49:00,109 --> 01:49:00,119
that he's certainly been learning by
 

5685
01:49:00,119 --> 01:49:02,810
that he's certainly been learning by
building car factories is what that

5686
01:49:02,810 --> 01:49:02,820
building car factories is what that
 

5687
01:49:02,820 --> 01:49:05,629
building car factories is what that
looks like in scaling

5688
01:49:05,629 --> 01:49:05,639
looks like in scaling
 

5689
01:49:05,639 --> 01:49:09,109
looks like in scaling
um by scaling you can get efficiencies

5690
01:49:09,109 --> 01:49:09,119
um by scaling you can get efficiencies
 

5691
01:49:09,119 --> 01:49:13,609
um by scaling you can get efficiencies
that drive costs down very well and uh

5692
01:49:13,609 --> 01:49:13,619
that drive costs down very well and uh
 

5693
01:49:13,619 --> 01:49:15,590
that drive costs down very well and uh
and the smart thing that you know they

5694
01:49:15,590 --> 01:49:15,600
and the smart thing that you know they
 

5695
01:49:15,600 --> 01:49:18,050
and the smart thing that you know they
have in their favor is that you know

5696
01:49:18,050 --> 01:49:18,060
have in their favor is that you know
 

5697
01:49:18,060 --> 01:49:19,310
have in their favor is that you know
they know how to manufacture they know

5698
01:49:19,310 --> 01:49:19,320
they know how to manufacture they know
 

5699
01:49:19,320 --> 01:49:20,870
they know how to manufacture they know
how to build electric motors they know

5700
01:49:20,870 --> 01:49:20,880
how to build electric motors they know
 

5701
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:23,209
how to build electric motors they know
how to build uh you know computers and

5702
01:49:23,209 --> 01:49:23,219
how to build uh you know computers and
 

5703
01:49:23,219 --> 01:49:24,590
how to build uh you know computers and
vision systems so there's a lot of

5704
01:49:24,590 --> 01:49:24,600
vision systems so there's a lot of
 

5705
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:27,550
vision systems so there's a lot of
overlap between modern

5706
01:49:27,550 --> 01:49:27,560
overlap between modern
 

5707
01:49:27,560 --> 01:49:29,510
overlap between modern
Automotive companies

5708
01:49:29,510 --> 01:49:29,520

and robots
 

5711
01:49:31,560 --> 01:49:33,290
and robots
but hey

5712
01:49:33,290 --> 01:49:33,300
but hey
 

5713
01:49:33,300 --> 01:49:36,050
but hey
we have a modern robotic I mean that

5714
01:49:36,050 --> 01:49:36,060
we have a modern robotic I mean that
 

5715
01:49:36,060 --> 01:49:39,669
we have a modern robotic I mean that
automotive company behind us as well

so uh bring it on who's doing pretty

5718
01:49:42,109 --> 01:49:42,119
so uh bring it on who's doing pretty
 

5719

I love it uh so how much so we've talked

5724
01:49:50,330 --> 01:49:50,340
I love it uh so how much so we've talked
 

5725
01:49:50,340 --> 01:49:52,550
I love it uh so how much so we've talked
about some of the low level controls

5726
01:49:52,550 --> 01:49:52,560
about some of the low level controls
 

5727
01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:53,930
about some of the low level controls
some of the incredible stuff that's

5728
01:49:53,930 --> 01:49:53,940
some of the incredible stuff that's
 

5729
01:49:53,940 --> 01:49:57,709
some of the incredible stuff that's
going on and basic perception

5730
01:49:57,709 --> 01:49:57,719
going on and basic perception
 

5731
01:49:57,719 --> 01:50:00,109
going on and basic perception
but how much do you see in currently in

5732
01:50:00,109 --> 01:50:00,119
but how much do you see in currently in
 

5733
01:50:00,119 --> 01:50:03,290
but how much do you see in currently in
the future of Boston Dynamics sort of

applications do you see customers adding
 

5739
01:50:08,280 --> 01:50:10,070
applications do you see customers adding
on those capabilities or do you see

5740
01:50:10,070 --> 01:50:10,080
on those capabilities or do you see
 

5741
01:50:10,080 --> 01:50:12,290
on those capabilities or do you see
Boston Dynamics doing that in-house

5742
01:50:12,290 --> 01:50:12,300
Boston Dynamics doing that in-house
 

5743
01:50:12,300 --> 01:50:14,629
Boston Dynamics doing that in-house
some kinds of things we really believe

5744
01:50:14,629 --> 01:50:14,639
some kinds of things we really believe
 

5745
01:50:14,639 --> 01:50:16,510
some kinds of things we really believe
ought are probably going to be

5746
01:50:16,510 --> 01:50:16,520
ought are probably going to be
 

5747
01:50:16,520 --> 01:50:19,669
ought are probably going to be
more broadly available maybe even

5748
01:50:19,669 --> 01:50:19,679
more broadly available maybe even
 

5749
01:50:19,679 --> 01:50:21,109
more broadly available maybe even
commoditized

5750

you know using a machine learning like a

5752
01:50:23,750 --> 01:50:23,760
you know using a machine learning like a
 

5753
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:25,250
you know using a machine learning like a
vision algorithm so a robot can

vision algorithm so a robot can
 

5755
01:50:25,260 --> 01:50:26,629
vision algorithm so a robot can
recognize something in the environment

recognize something in the environment
 

5757
01:50:26,639 --> 01:50:28,370
recognize something in the environment
that ought to be something you can just

5758
01:50:28,370 --> 01:50:28,380
that ought to be something you can just
 

5759
01:50:28,380 --> 01:50:30,890
that ought to be something you can just
download like I'm going to a new

5760
01:50:30,890 --> 01:50:30,900
download like I'm going to a new
 

5761
01:50:30,900 --> 01:50:32,450

inspect you ought to be able to just

5766
01:50:35,689 --> 01:50:35,699
inspect you ought to be able to just
 

5767
01:50:35,699 --> 01:50:37,490
inspect you ought to be able to just
download that and I think people besides

5768
01:50:37,490 --> 01:50:37,500
download that and I think people besides
 

5769
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:39,169
download that and I think people besides
Boston Dynamics will provide that and

5770
01:50:39,169 --> 01:50:39,179
Boston Dynamics will provide that and
 

5771
01:50:39,179 --> 01:50:42,350
Boston Dynamics will provide that and
we've actually built an API that lets

5772
01:50:42,350 --> 01:50:42,360
we've actually built an API that lets
 

5773
01:50:42,360 --> 01:50:47,209
we've actually built an API that lets
people add these uh Vision algorithms to

5774
01:50:47,209 --> 01:50:47,219
people add these uh Vision algorithms to
 

5775
01:50:47,219 --> 01:50:48,109
people add these uh Vision algorithms to
spot

5776
01:50:48,109 --> 01:50:48,119
spot
 

5777
01:50:48,119 --> 01:50:49,550
spot
and we're currently working with some

5778
01:50:49,550 --> 01:50:49,560
and we're currently working with some
 

5779
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:51,410
and we're currently working with some
Partners who are providing that

5780
01:50:51,410 --> 01:50:51,420
Partners who are providing that
 

5781
01:50:51,420 --> 01:50:53,629
Partners who are providing that
um levitas is an example of a small

5782
01:50:53,629 --> 01:50:53,639
um levitas is an example of a small
 

5783
01:50:53,639 --> 01:50:56,030
um levitas is an example of a small
provider who's giving us software for

5784
01:50:56,030 --> 01:50:56,040
provider who's giving us software for
 

5785
01:50:56,040 --> 01:50:57,890
provider who's giving us software for
reading gauges

5786
01:50:57,890 --> 01:50:57,900
reading gauges
 

5787
01:50:57,900 --> 01:50:59,810

um and actually another partner in

5788
01:50:59,810 --> 01:50:59,820
um and actually another partner in
 

5789
01:50:59,820 --> 01:51:02,510
um and actually another partner in
Europe reply is doing the same thing

5790
01:51:02,510 --> 01:51:02,520
Europe reply is doing the same thing
 

5791
01:51:02,520 --> 01:51:05,209
Europe reply is doing the same thing
so we see that we see It ultimately uh

5792
01:51:05,209 --> 01:51:05,219
so we see that we see It ultimately uh
 

5793
01:51:05,219 --> 01:51:08,750
so we see that we see It ultimately uh
an ecosystem of providers doing stuff

5794
01:51:08,750 --> 01:51:08,760
an ecosystem of providers doing stuff
 

5795
01:51:08,760 --> 01:51:11,830
an ecosystem of providers doing stuff
like that I and I I think ultimately

5796
01:51:11,830 --> 01:51:11,840
like that I and I I think ultimately
 

5797
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:13,970
like that I and I I think ultimately
you might even be able to do the same

5798
01:51:13,970 --> 01:51:13,980
you might even be able to do the same
 

5799
01:51:13,980 --> 01:51:17,090
you might even be able to do the same
thing with behaviors so this technology

5800
01:51:17,090 --> 01:51:17,100
thing with behaviors so this technology
 

5801
01:51:17,100 --> 01:51:20,510
thing with behaviors so this technology
will also be brought to bear on

5802
01:51:20,510 --> 01:51:20,520
will also be brought to bear on
 

5803
01:51:20,520 --> 01:51:22,970
will also be brought to bear on
controlling the robot the the Motions of

5804
01:51:22,970 --> 01:51:22,980
controlling the robot the the Motions of
 

5805
01:51:22,980 --> 01:51:25,370
controlling the robot the the Motions of
the robot and you know we're using

5806
01:51:25,370 --> 01:51:25,380
the robot and you know we're using
 

5807
01:51:25,380 --> 01:51:27,649
the robot and you know we're using
learning reinforcement learning to

5808
01:51:27,649 --> 01:51:27,659
learning reinforcement learning to
 

5809
01:51:27,659 --> 01:51:29,229
learning reinforcement learning to
develop

5810
01:51:29,229 --> 01:51:29,239
develop
 

5811
01:51:29,239 --> 01:51:31,609
develop
algorithms for both Locomotion and

5812
01:51:31,609 --> 01:51:31,619
algorithms for both Locomotion and
 

5813
01:51:31,619 --> 01:51:33,050
algorithms for both Locomotion and

5814
01:51:33,050 --> 01:51:33,060
manipulation
 

5815
01:51:33,060 --> 01:51:34,970
manipulation
and ultimately this is going to mean you

5816
01:51:34,970 --> 01:51:34,980
and ultimately this is going to mean you
 

5817
01:51:34,980 --> 01:51:37,070
and ultimately this is going to mean you
can you can add new behaviors to a robot

5818
01:51:37,070 --> 01:51:37,080
can you can add new behaviors to a robot
 

5819
01:51:37,080 --> 01:51:38,990
can you can add new behaviors to a robot
you know quickly

5820
01:51:38,990 --> 01:51:39,000
you know quickly
 

5821
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:42,109
you know quickly
and uh that could potentially be done

5822
01:51:42,109 --> 01:51:42,119
and uh that could potentially be done
 

5823
01:51:42,119 --> 01:51:43,790
and uh that could potentially be done
outside of Boston Dynamics right now

5824
01:51:43,790 --> 01:51:43,800
outside of Boston Dynamics right now
 

5825
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:46,729
outside of Boston Dynamics right now
that's all internal to us I think I

5826
01:51:46,729 --> 01:51:46,739
that's all internal to us I think I
 

5827
01:51:46,739 --> 01:51:48,470
that's all internal to us I think I
think you need to understand

5828
01:51:48,470 --> 01:51:48,480
think you need to understand
 

5829
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:50,990
think you need to understand
at a deep level you know

5830
01:51:50,990 --> 01:51:51,000
at a deep level you know
 

5831
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,149
at a deep level you know
um the robot control to do that but

5832
01:51:53,149 --> 01:51:53,159
um the robot control to do that but
 

5833
01:51:53,159 --> 01:51:55,070
um the robot control to do that but
eventually that could be outside but

5834
01:51:55,070 --> 01:51:55,080
eventually that could be outside but
 

5835
01:51:55,080 --> 01:51:57,530
eventually that could be outside but
it's certainly a place where these these

5836
01:51:57,530 --> 01:51:57,540
it's certainly a place where these these
 

5837
01:51:57,540 --> 01:51:59,149
it's certainly a place where these these
approaches are going to be brought to

5838
01:51:59,149 --> 01:51:59,159
approaches are going to be brought to
 

5839
01:51:59,159 --> 01:52:01,129
approaches are going to be brought to
bear in robotics so reinforcement

5840
01:52:01,129 --> 01:52:01,139
bear in robotics so reinforcement
 

5841
01:52:01,139 --> 01:52:03,649
bear in robotics so reinforcement
learning is part of the process today so

5842
01:52:03,649 --> 01:52:03,659
learning is part of the process today so
 

5843
01:52:03,659 --> 01:52:07,010
learning is part of the process today so
you do use reinforcement learning yes

5844
01:52:07,010 --> 01:52:07,020
you do use reinforcement learning yes
 

5845
01:52:07,020 --> 01:52:08,030
you do use reinforcement learning yes
foreign

5846
01:52:08,030 --> 01:52:08,040
foreign
 

5847
01:52:08,040 --> 01:52:10,430
foreign
so there's uh increasing levels of

5848
01:52:10,430 --> 01:52:10,440
so there's uh increasing levels of
 

5849
01:52:10,440 --> 01:52:12,830
so there's uh increasing levels of
learning with these robots yes

5850
01:52:12,830 --> 01:52:12,840
learning with these robots yes
 

5851
01:52:12,840 --> 01:52:14,570
learning with these robots yes
and that's for both for uh for

5852
01:52:14,570 --> 01:52:14,580
and that's for both for uh for
 

5853
01:52:14,580 --> 01:52:16,729
and that's for both for uh for
Locomotion for manipulation and

5854
01:52:16,729 --> 01:52:16,739
Locomotion for manipulation and
 

5855
01:52:16,739 --> 01:52:18,729
Locomotion for manipulation and
for perception yes

5856
01:52:18,729 --> 01:52:18,739
for perception yes
 

5857
01:52:18,739 --> 01:52:21,709
for perception yes
well what do you think in general about

5858
01:52:21,709 --> 01:52:21,719
well what do you think in general about
 

5859
01:52:21,719 --> 01:52:24,790
well what do you think in general about
the all the exciting advancements of uh

5860
01:52:24,790 --> 01:52:24,800
the all the exciting advancements of uh
 

5861
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:28,790
the all the exciting advancements of uh
Transformer uh neural networks

5862
01:52:28,790 --> 01:52:28,800
Transformer uh neural networks
 

5863

beautifully uh Illustrated through the
 

5867
01:52:32,820 --> 01:52:37,250
beautifully uh Illustrated through the
large language models like gpt4

5868
01:52:37,250 --> 01:52:37,260

 

5869
01:52:37,260 --> 01:52:39,410

like everybody else we're all you know

5870
01:52:39,410 --> 01:52:39,420
like everybody else we're all you know
 

5871
01:52:39,420 --> 01:52:44,629
like everybody else we're all you know
I'm I'm surprised at uh how much uh how

5872
01:52:44,629 --> 01:52:44,639
I'm I'm surprised at uh how much uh how
 

5873
01:52:44,639 --> 01:52:47,090
I'm I'm surprised at uh how much uh how
far they've come

5874
01:52:47,090 --> 01:52:47,100
far they've come
 

5875
01:52:47,100 --> 01:52:51,229
far they've come
um I'm a little bit nervous about the

5876
01:52:51,229 --> 01:52:51,239
um I'm a little bit nervous about the
 

5877
01:52:51,239 --> 01:52:53,689
um I'm a little bit nervous about the
there's anxiety around them obviously

5878
01:52:53,689 --> 01:52:53,699
there's anxiety around them obviously
 

5879
01:52:53,699 --> 01:52:57,950
there's anxiety around them obviously
for I think good reasons right

5880
01:52:57,950 --> 01:52:57,960
for I think good reasons right
 

5881
01:52:57,960 --> 01:53:01,910
for I think good reasons right
disinformation is a a curse that's a an

5882
01:53:01,910 --> 01:53:01,920
disinformation is a a curse that's a an
 

5883
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:03,890
disinformation is a a curse that's a an
unintended consequence of social media

5884
01:53:03,890 --> 01:53:03,900
unintended consequence of social media
 

5885
01:53:03,900 --> 01:53:05,410
unintended consequence of social media
that could be

5886
01:53:05,410 --> 01:53:05,420
that could be
 

5887
01:53:05,420 --> 01:53:08,990
that could be
exacerbated with these tools so if you

5888
01:53:08,990 --> 01:53:09,000
exacerbated with these tools so if you
 

5889
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,870
exacerbated with these tools so if you
use them to deploy this information it

5890
01:53:11,870 --> 01:53:11,880
use them to deploy this information it
 

5891
01:53:11,880 --> 01:53:14,810
use them to deploy this information it
could be a real risk

5892
01:53:14,810 --> 01:53:14,820
could be a real risk
 

5893
01:53:14,820 --> 01:53:17,090
could be a real risk
um but I also think that the risks

5894
01:53:17,090 --> 01:53:17,100
um but I also think that the risks
 

5895
01:53:17,100 --> 01:53:18,709
um but I also think that the risks
associated with these kinds of models

5896
01:53:18,709 --> 01:53:18,719
associated with these kinds of models
 

5897
01:53:18,719 --> 01:53:21,770
associated with these kinds of models
don't have a whole lot to do with the

5898
01:53:21,770 --> 01:53:21,780
don't have a whole lot to do with the
 

5899
01:53:21,780 --> 01:53:23,450
don't have a whole lot to do with the
way we're going to use them in our

5900
01:53:23,450 --> 01:53:23,460
way we're going to use them in our
 

5901
01:53:23,460 --> 01:53:25,669
way we're going to use them in our

5911
01:53:36,600 --> 01:53:39,050
the task I asked it to is it doing it
correctly there's sort of a a built-in

5912
01:53:39,050 --> 01:53:39,060
correctly there's sort of a a built-in
 

5913
01:53:39,060 --> 01:53:42,169
correctly there's sort of a a built-in
mechanism for judging is that is it

doing the right thing did it
 

5917
01:53:43,619 --> 01:53:46,129
doing the right thing did it
successfully do the task yeah physical

question in chat GPT
 

5929
01:53:58,380 --> 01:54:00,530
question in chat GPT
it could be true or it may not be true

5930
01:54:00,530 --> 01:54:00,540
it could be true or it may not be true
 

5931
01:54:00,540 --> 01:54:03,169
it could be true or it may not be true
and it's hard to have that verifier what

5932
01:54:03,169 --> 01:54:03,179
and it's hard to have that verifier what
 

5933
01:54:03,179 --> 01:54:05,390
and it's hard to have that verifier what
what is that truth that you're comparing

5934
01:54:05,390 --> 01:54:05,400
what is that truth that you're comparing
 

5935
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:07,189
what is that truth that you're comparing
against whereas in physical reality you

5936
01:54:07,189 --> 01:54:07,199
against whereas in physical reality you
 

5937
01:54:07,199 --> 01:54:08,390
against whereas in physical reality you
know the truth

5938
01:54:08,390 --> 01:54:08,400
know the truth
 

5939
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:11,390
know the truth
and this is an important difference and

5940
01:54:11,390 --> 01:54:11,400
and this is an important difference and
 

5941
01:54:11,400 --> 01:54:13,129
and this is an important difference and
um so I'm not

5942
01:54:13,129 --> 01:54:13,139
um so I'm not
 

5943
01:54:13,139 --> 01:54:14,990
um so I'm not
I think there is reason to be a little

5944
01:54:14,990 --> 01:54:15,000
I think there is reason to be a little
 

5945
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,149
I think there is reason to be a little
bit concerned about

bit concerned about
 

5947
01:54:17,159 --> 01:54:20,209
bit concerned about
um you know how these tools large

5948
01:54:20,209 --> 01:54:20,219
um you know how these tools large
 

5949
01:54:20,219 --> 01:54:22,370
um you know how these tools large
language models could be used but I'm

5950
01:54:22,370 --> 01:54:22,380
language models could be used but I'm
 

5951
01:54:22,380 --> 01:54:23,990
language models could be used but I'm
not very worried about how they're going

5952
01:54:23,990 --> 01:54:24,000
not very worried about how they're going
 

5953
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:25,129
not very worried about how they're going
to be used

5954
01:54:25,129 --> 01:54:25,139
to be used
 

5955
01:54:25,139 --> 01:54:27,830
to be used
well how learning algorithms in general

5956
01:54:27,830 --> 01:54:27,840
well how learning algorithms in general
 

5957
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:30,590
well how learning algorithms in general
are going to be used on robotics it's

5958
01:54:30,590 --> 01:54:30,600
are going to be used on robotics it's
 

5959
01:54:30,600 --> 01:54:32,930
are going to be used on robotics it's
it's really a different application

5960
01:54:32,930 --> 01:54:32,940
it's really a different application
 

5961
01:54:32,940 --> 01:54:35,689
it's really a different application
that has different ways of verifying

5962
01:54:35,689 --> 01:54:35,699
that has different ways of verifying
 

5963
01:54:35,699 --> 01:54:37,129
that has different ways of verifying
what's going on well the nice thing

5964
01:54:37,129 --> 01:54:37,139
what's going on well the nice thing
 

5965
01:54:37,139 --> 01:54:39,709
what's going on well the nice thing
about language models is that I

5966
01:54:39,709 --> 01:54:39,719
about language models is that I
 

5967
01:54:39,719 --> 01:54:41,270
about language models is that I
ultimately see

5968
01:54:41,270 --> 01:54:41,280
ultimately see
 

5969
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:43,189
ultimately see
I'm really excited about the possibility

5970
01:54:43,189 --> 01:54:43,199
I'm really excited about the possibility
 

5971
01:54:43,199 --> 01:54:45,229
I'm really excited about the possibility
of having conversations with spot yeah

5972
01:54:45,229 --> 01:54:45,239
of having conversations with spot yeah
 

5973
01:54:45,239 --> 01:54:47,450
of having conversations with spot yeah
uh there's no I would say negative

5974
01:54:47,450 --> 01:54:47,460
uh there's no I would say negative
 

5975
01:54:47,460 --> 01:54:49,729
uh there's no I would say negative
consequences to that but just increasing

5976
01:54:49,729 --> 01:54:49,739
consequences to that but just increasing
 

5977
01:54:49,739 --> 01:54:52,189
consequences to that but just increasing
the bandwidth in the variety of ways you

5978
01:54:52,189 --> 01:54:52,199
the bandwidth in the variety of ways you
 

5979
01:54:52,199 --> 01:54:54,229
the bandwidth in the variety of ways you
can communicate with this uh particular

5980
01:54:54,229 --> 01:54:54,239
can communicate with this uh particular
 

5981
01:54:54,239 --> 01:54:56,810
can communicate with this uh particular
robot so you could communicate visually

5982
01:54:56,810 --> 01:54:56,820
robot so you could communicate visually
 

5983
01:54:56,820 --> 01:54:58,370
robot so you could communicate visually
you can communicate through some

5984
01:54:58,370 --> 01:54:58,380
you can communicate through some
 

5985
01:54:58,380 --> 01:55:01,010
you can communicate through some
interface and to be able to communicate

5986
01:55:01,010 --> 01:55:01,020
interface and to be able to communicate
 

5987
01:55:01,020 --> 01:55:03,770

verbally again with the beer and so on

5988
01:55:03,770 --> 01:55:03,780
verbally again with the beer and so on
 

5989
01:55:03,780 --> 01:55:05,689
verbally again with the beer and so on
um I think that's really exciting to

5990
01:55:05,689 --> 01:55:05,699
um I think that's really exciting to
 

5991
01:55:05,699 --> 01:55:08,570
um I think that's really exciting to
make that much much easier we have this

5992
01:55:08,570 --> 01:55:08,580
make that much much easier we have this
 

5993
01:55:08,580 --> 01:55:11,450
make that much much easier we have this

just just this week I saw a demo where
 

5999
01:55:16,139 --> 01:55:19,189
just just this week I saw a demo where
they hooked up you know a language tool

01:55:19,199 --> 01:55:20,990
they hooked up you know a language tool
to spot and they're talking a spot to

6002
01:55:20,990 --> 01:55:21,000
to spot and they're talking a spot to
 

6003
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,090
to spot and they're talking a spot to
give example yeah can you tell me about

6004
01:55:23,090 --> 01:55:23,100
give example yeah can you tell me about
 

6005
01:55:23,100 --> 01:55:26,209
give example yeah can you tell me about
the Boston Dynamics AI Institute what is

6006
01:55:26,209 --> 01:55:26,219
the Boston Dynamics AI Institute what is
 

6007
01:55:26,219 --> 01:55:28,370
the Boston Dynamics AI Institute what is
it and what is its mission

6008
01:55:28,370 --> 01:55:28,380
it and what is its mission
 

6009
01:55:28,380 --> 01:55:31,550
it and what is its mission
so it's a separate organization uh the

6010
01:55:31,550 --> 01:55:31,560
so it's a separate organization uh the
 

6011

of Boston Dynamics and the former CEO
 

6019
01:55:39,300 --> 01:55:42,530
of Boston Dynamics and the former CEO
and my old advisor at MIT Mark has

6020
01:55:42,530 --> 01:55:42,540
and my old advisor at MIT Mark has
 

6021
01:55:42,540 --> 01:55:46,189
and my old advisor at MIT Mark has
always loved the research the pure

6022
01:55:46,189 --> 01:55:46,199
always loved the research the pure
 

6023
01:55:46,199 --> 01:55:48,890
always loved the research the pure
research without the confinement or

6024
01:55:48,890 --> 01:55:48,900
research without the confinement or
 

6025
01:55:48,900 --> 01:55:51,790
research without the confinement or
demands of commercialization

6026
01:55:51,790 --> 01:55:51,800
demands of commercialization
 

6027
01:55:51,800 --> 01:55:56,689
demands of commercialization
and uh he wanted to continue to you know

6028
01:55:56,689 --> 01:55:56,699
and uh he wanted to continue to you know
 

6029
01:55:56,699 --> 01:56:00,290
and uh he wanted to continue to you know
pursue that unadulterated research

6030
01:56:00,290 --> 01:56:00,300
pursue that unadulterated research
 

6031
01:56:00,300 --> 01:56:05,750
pursue that unadulterated research
and uh uh so uh suggested uh to Hyundai

6032
01:56:05,750 --> 01:56:05,760
and uh uh so uh suggested uh to Hyundai
 

6033
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:07,970
and uh uh so uh suggested uh to Hyundai
that that he set up this institute and

6034
01:56:07,970 --> 01:56:07,980
that that he set up this institute and
 

6035
01:56:07,980 --> 01:56:10,129
that that he set up this institute and
they agree that it's worth additional

6036
01:56:10,129 --> 01:56:10,139
they agree that it's worth additional
 

6037
01:56:10,139 --> 01:56:11,930
they agree that it's worth additional
investment to kind of continue push

6038
01:56:11,930 --> 01:56:11,940
investment to kind of continue push
 

6039
01:56:11,940 --> 01:56:14,209
investment to kind of continue push
pushing this Forefront

6040
01:56:14,209 --> 01:56:14,219
pushing this Forefront
 

6041
01:56:14,219 --> 01:56:16,490
pushing this Forefront
and we expect to be working together

6042
01:56:16,490 --> 01:56:16,500
and we expect to be working together
 

6043
01:56:16,500 --> 01:56:19,250
and we expect to be working together
where you know Boston Dynamics is again

6044
01:56:19,250 --> 01:56:19,260
where you know Boston Dynamics is again
 

6045
01:56:19,260 --> 01:56:22,250
where you know Boston Dynamics is again
both commercialize and do research but

6046
01:56:22,250 --> 01:56:22,260
both commercialize and do research but
 

6047
01:56:22,260 --> 01:56:24,709
both commercialize and do research but
the sort of time Horizon of the research

6048
01:56:24,709 --> 01:56:24,719
the sort of time Horizon of the research
 

6049
01:56:24,719 --> 01:56:26,450
the sort of time Horizon of the research
we're going to do is you know in the

6050
01:56:26,450 --> 01:56:26,460
we're going to do is you know in the
 

6051
01:56:26,460 --> 01:56:28,430
we're going to do is you know in the
next let's say five years you know what

6052
01:56:28,430 --> 01:56:28,440
next let's say five years you know what
 

6053
01:56:28,440 --> 01:56:29,990
next let's say five years you know what
can we do in the next five years let's

6054
01:56:29,990 --> 01:56:30,000
can we do in the next five years let's
 

6055
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:31,609
can we do in the next five years let's
work on those problems

6056
01:56:31,609 --> 01:56:31,619
work on those problems
 

6057
01:56:31,619 --> 01:56:33,770
work on those problems
and I think the goal of the AI Institute

6058
01:56:33,770 --> 01:56:33,780
and I think the goal of the AI Institute
 

6059
01:56:33,780 --> 01:56:36,649
and I think the goal of the AI Institute
is to work even further out

6060
01:56:36,649 --> 01:56:36,659
is to work even further out
 

6061
01:56:36,659 --> 01:56:39,050
is to work even further out
um certainly you know the analogy of of

6062
01:56:39,050 --> 01:56:39,060
um certainly you know the analogy of of
 

6063
01:56:39,060 --> 01:56:41,149
um certainly you know the analogy of of
legged Locomotion again when we started

6064
01:56:41,149 --> 01:56:41,159
legged Locomotion again when we started
 

6065
01:56:41,159 --> 01:56:43,370
legged Locomotion again when we started
that that was a multi-decade problem and

6066
01:56:43,370 --> 01:56:43,380
that that was a multi-decade problem and
 

6067
01:56:43,380 --> 01:56:45,109
that that was a multi-decade problem and
and so I think Mark wants to have the

6068
01:56:45,109 --> 01:56:45,119
and so I think Mark wants to have the
 

6069
01:56:45,119 --> 01:56:46,010
and so I think Mark wants to have the
freedom

6070
01:56:46,010 --> 01:56:46,020
freedom
 

6071
01:56:46,020 --> 01:56:49,189
freedom
uh to pursue really hard Over the

6072
01:56:49,189 --> 01:56:49,199
uh to pursue really hard Over the
 

6073
01:56:49,199 --> 01:56:51,649
uh to pursue really hard Over the
Horizon problems and that's that'll be

6074
01:56:51,649 --> 01:56:51,659
Horizon problems and that's that'll be
 

6075
01:56:51,659 --> 01:56:53,629
Horizon problems and that's that'll be
the goal of the Institute

6076
01:56:53,629 --> 01:56:53,639
the goal of the Institute
 

6077
01:56:53,639 --> 01:56:56,390
the goal of the Institute
so we mentioned uh some of the dangers

6078
01:56:56,390 --> 01:56:56,400
so we mentioned uh some of the dangers
 

6079
01:56:56,400 --> 01:56:58,850
so we mentioned uh some of the dangers
of uh some of the concerns about large

6080
01:56:58,850 --> 01:56:58,860
of uh some of the concerns about large
 

6081
01:56:58,860 --> 01:57:02,330
of uh some of the concerns about large
language models that said uh you know

6082
01:57:02,330 --> 01:57:02,340
language models that said uh you know
 

6083
01:57:02,340 --> 01:57:05,149
language models that said uh you know
there's been a long-running fear of

6084
01:57:05,149 --> 01:57:05,159
there's been a long-running fear of
 

6085
01:57:05,159 --> 01:57:06,649
there's been a long-running fear of
these embodied

6086
01:57:06,649 --> 01:57:06,659
these embodied
 

6087
01:57:06,659 --> 01:57:08,930
these embodied
robots uh why do you think people are

6088
01:57:08,930 --> 01:57:08,940
robots uh why do you think people are
 

6089
01:57:08,940 --> 01:57:11,930
robots uh why do you think people are
afraid of uh Lincoln robots yeah I

6090
01:57:11,930 --> 01:57:11,940
afraid of uh Lincoln robots yeah I
 

6091
01:57:11,940 --> 01:57:13,910
afraid of uh Lincoln robots yeah I
wanted to show you this this

6092
01:57:13,910 --> 01:57:13,920
wanted to show you this this
 

6093
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:16,370
wanted to show you this this
so this this is a Wall Street Journal

6094
01:57:16,370 --> 01:57:16,380
so this this is a Wall Street Journal
 

6095
01:57:16,380 --> 01:57:19,490
so this this is a Wall Street Journal
and this is all about chat GPT right but

6096
01:57:19,490 --> 01:57:19,500
and this is all about chat GPT right but
 

6097
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:21,649
and this is all about chat GPT right but
look at the picture yeah it's a humanoid

6098
01:57:21,649 --> 01:57:21,659
look at the picture yeah it's a humanoid
 

6099
01:57:21,659 --> 01:57:22,669
look at the picture yeah it's a humanoid
robot

6100
01:57:22,669 --> 01:57:22,679
robot
 

6101
01:57:22,679 --> 01:57:24,890
robot
that's saying I will say that looks

6102
01:57:24,890 --> 01:57:24,900
that's saying I will say that looks
 

6103
01:57:24,900 --> 01:57:26,390
that's saying I will say that looks
scary and it says I'm going to replace

6104
01:57:26,390 --> 01:57:26,400
scary and it says I'm going to replace
 

6105
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:29,330
scary and it says I'm going to replace
you yeah and so the humanoid robot is

6106
01:57:29,330 --> 01:57:29,340
you yeah and so the humanoid robot is
 

6107
01:57:29,340 --> 01:57:32,570
you yeah and so the humanoid robot is
sort of is the embodiment of this chat

6108
01:57:32,570 --> 01:57:32,580
sort of is the embodiment of this chat
 

6109
01:57:32,580 --> 01:57:37,490
sort of is the embodiment of this chat
GPT tool that there's reason to be a

6110
01:57:37,490 --> 01:57:37,500
GPT tool that there's reason to be a
 

6111
01:57:37,500 --> 01:57:38,990
GPT tool that there's reason to be a
little bit nervous about how it gets

6112
01:57:38,990 --> 01:57:39,000
little bit nervous about how it gets
 

6113
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,689
little bit nervous about how it gets
deployed yeah so I'm nervous about that

6114
01:57:41,689 --> 01:57:41,699
deployed yeah so I'm nervous about that
 

6115
01:57:41,699 --> 01:57:43,490
deployed yeah so I'm nervous about that
connection

6116
01:57:43,490 --> 01:57:43,500
connection
 

6117
01:57:43,500 --> 01:57:44,149
connection
um

6118
01:57:44,149 --> 01:57:44,159
um
 

6119
01:57:44,159 --> 01:57:46,129
um
it's unfortunate that they chose to use

6120
01:57:46,129 --> 01:57:46,139
it's unfortunate that they chose to use
 

6121
01:57:46,139 --> 01:57:49,010
it's unfortunate that they chose to use
a robot as that embodiment for as you

6122
01:57:49,010 --> 01:57:49,020
a robot as that embodiment for as you
 

6123
01:57:49,020 --> 01:57:50,990
a robot as that embodiment for as you
and I just said there's big differences

6124
01:57:50,990 --> 01:57:51,000
and I just said there's big differences
 

6125
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:52,970
and I just said there's big differences
in in this

6126
01:57:52,970 --> 01:57:52,980
in in this
 

6127
01:57:52,980 --> 01:57:56,570
in in this
but uh people are afraid because we've

6128
01:57:56,570 --> 01:57:56,580
but uh people are afraid because we've
 

6129
01:57:56,580 --> 01:57:57,589
but uh people are afraid because we've
been

6130
01:57:57,589 --> 01:57:57,599
been
 

6131
01:57:57,599 --> 01:58:00,410
been
taught to be afraid for over a hundred

6132
01:58:00,410 --> 01:58:00,420
taught to be afraid for over a hundred
 

6133
01:58:00,420 --> 01:58:02,930
taught to be afraid for over a hundred
years so you know the word robot was

6134
01:58:02,930 --> 01:58:02,940
years so you know the word robot was
 

6135
01:58:02,940 --> 01:58:05,149
years so you know the word robot was
developed by a playwright named Carol

6136
01:58:05,149 --> 01:58:05,159
developed by a playwright named Carol
 

6137
01:58:05,159 --> 01:58:08,209
developed by a playwright named Carol

chapek in 1921 to check a playwright for
 

6139

Awesome's Universal robots and in that

6140
01:58:10,910 --> 01:58:10,920
Awesome's Universal robots and in that
 

6141
01:58:10,920 --> 01:58:13,609
Awesome's Universal robots and in that
first depiction of a robot the robots

6142
01:58:13,609 --> 01:58:13,619
first depiction of a robot the robots
 

6143
01:58:13,619 --> 01:58:14,649
first depiction of a robot the robots
took over

6144
01:58:14,649 --> 01:58:14,659
took over
 

6145
01:58:14,659 --> 01:58:17,270
took over
the end of the story

6146
01:58:17,270 --> 01:58:17,280
the end of the story
 

6147
01:58:17,280 --> 01:58:19,430
the end of the story
and you know people love to be afraid

6148
01:58:19,430 --> 01:58:19,440
and you know people love to be afraid
 

6149
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:21,589
and you know people love to be afraid
and so we've been entertained by these

6150
01:58:21,589 --> 01:58:21,599
and so we've been entertained by these
 

6151
01:58:21,599 --> 01:58:23,570
and so we've been entertained by these
stories for a hundred years

6152
01:58:23,570 --> 01:58:23,580
stories for a hundred years
 

6153
01:58:23,580 --> 01:58:25,010
stories for a hundred years
but I

6154
01:58:25,010 --> 01:58:25,020
but I
 

6155
01:58:25,020 --> 01:58:27,470
but I
and I think that's as much why people

6156
01:58:27,470 --> 01:58:27,480
and I think that's as much why people
 

6157
01:58:27,480 --> 01:58:29,450
and I think that's as much why people
are afraid as anything else as we've

6158
01:58:29,450 --> 01:58:29,460
are afraid as anything else as we've
 

6159
01:58:29,460 --> 01:58:31,970
are afraid as anything else as we've
been sort of taught that this is the

6160
01:58:31,970 --> 01:58:31,980
been sort of taught that this is the
 

6161
01:58:31,980 --> 01:58:35,930
been sort of taught that this is the
logical progression through fiction

6162
01:58:35,930 --> 01:58:35,940
logical progression through fiction
 

6163
01:58:35,940 --> 01:58:37,310
logical progression through fiction
um

6164
01:58:37,310 --> 01:58:37,320
um
 

6165
01:58:37,320 --> 01:58:38,750
um
I think it's fiction

6166
01:58:38,750 --> 01:58:38,760
I think it's fiction
 

6167
01:58:38,760 --> 01:58:41,209
I think it's fiction
I think uh what people more and more

6168
01:58:41,209 --> 01:58:41,219
I think uh what people more and more
 

6169
01:58:41,219 --> 01:58:44,149
I think uh what people more and more
will realize just like you said

6170
01:58:44,149 --> 01:58:44,159
will realize just like you said
 

6171
01:58:44,159 --> 01:58:47,390
will realize just like you said
that the threat like say you have a

6172
01:58:47,390 --> 01:58:47,400
that the threat like say you have a
 

6173
01:58:47,400 --> 01:58:50,570
that the threat like say you have a
super intelligent AI embodied in a robot

6174
01:58:50,570 --> 01:58:50,580
super intelligent AI embodied in a robot
 

6175
01:58:50,580 --> 01:58:52,490
super intelligent AI embodied in a robot
that's much less threatening because

6176
01:58:52,490 --> 01:58:52,500
that's much less threatening because
 

6177
01:58:52,500 --> 01:58:56,149
that's much less threatening because
it's visible it's verifiable it's right

6178
01:58:56,149 --> 01:58:56,159
it's visible it's verifiable it's right
 

6179
01:58:56,159 --> 01:58:57,950
it's visible it's verifiable it's right
there in physical reality and we humans

6180
01:58:57,950 --> 01:58:57,960
there in physical reality and we humans
 

6181
01:58:57,960 --> 01:59:00,410
there in physical reality and we humans
know how to deal with physical reality I

6182
01:59:00,410 --> 01:59:00,420
know how to deal with physical reality I
 

6183
01:59:00,420 --> 01:59:02,350
know how to deal with physical reality I
think it's much scarier when you have

6184
01:59:02,350 --> 01:59:02,360
think it's much scarier when you have
 

6185
01:59:02,360 --> 01:59:04,970
think it's much scarier when you have
arbitrary scaling of

6186
01:59:04,970 --> 01:59:04,980
arbitrary scaling of
 

6187
01:59:04,980 --> 01:59:07,430
arbitrary scaling of
intelligent AI systems in the digital

6188
01:59:07,430 --> 01:59:07,440
intelligent AI systems in the digital
 

6189
01:59:07,440 --> 01:59:08,689
intelligent AI systems in the digital
space

6190
01:59:08,689 --> 01:59:08,699
space
 

6191
01:59:08,699 --> 01:59:11,930
space
that they could uh pretend to be human

6192
01:59:11,930 --> 01:59:11,940
that they could uh pretend to be human
 

6193
01:59:11,940 --> 01:59:14,390
that they could uh pretend to be human
so robot spot is not going to be pretend

6194
01:59:14,390 --> 01:59:14,400
so robot spot is not going to be pretend
 

6195
01:59:14,400 --> 01:59:16,430
so robot spot is not going to be pretend
it could pretend it's human all at once

6196
01:59:16,430 --> 01:59:16,440
it could pretend it's human all at once
 

6197
01:59:16,440 --> 01:59:19,129
it could pretend it's human all at once
you can tell you you could put Chad gbt

6198
01:59:19,129 --> 01:59:19,139
you can tell you you could put Chad gbt
 

6199
01:59:19,139 --> 01:59:21,050
you can tell you you could put Chad gbt
on top of it but you're gonna know it's

6200
01:59:21,050 --> 01:59:21,060
on top of it but you're gonna know it's
 

6201
01:59:21,060 --> 01:59:22,310
on top of it but you're gonna know it's
not human because you have a contact

6202
01:59:22,310 --> 01:59:22,320
not human because you have a contact
 

6203
01:59:22,320 --> 01:59:24,169
not human because you have a contact
with physical reality and you're going

6204
01:59:24,169 --> 01:59:24,179
with physical reality and you're going
 

6205
01:59:24,179 --> 01:59:25,250
with physical reality and you're going
to know whether or not it's doing what

6206
01:59:25,250 --> 01:59:25,260
to know whether or not it's doing what
 

6207
01:59:25,260 --> 01:59:27,350
to know whether or not it's doing what
you asked it to do yeah like it's not

6208
01:59:27,350 --> 01:59:27,360
you asked it to do yeah like it's not
 

6209
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:30,050
you asked it to do yeah like it's not
gonna like if it like I mean I'm sure

6210
01:59:30,050 --> 01:59:30,060
gonna like if it like I mean I'm sure
 

6211
01:59:30,060 --> 01:59:32,810
gonna like if it like I mean I'm sure
you can start just like a dog lies to

6212
01:59:32,810 --> 01:59:32,820
you can start just like a dog lies to
 

6213
01:59:32,820 --> 01:59:34,070
you can start just like a dog lies to
you it's like I didn't I wasn't part of

6214
01:59:34,070 --> 01:59:34,080
you it's like I didn't I wasn't part of
 

6215
01:59:34,080 --> 01:59:36,250
you it's like I didn't I wasn't part of
tearing up that couch

6216
01:59:36,250 --> 01:59:36,260
tearing up that couch
 

6217
01:59:36,260 --> 01:59:39,290
tearing up that couch
 try to lie that like you know it

6218
01:59:39,290 --> 01:59:39,300
try to lie that like you know it
 

6219
01:59:39,300 --> 01:59:41,149
try to lie that like you know it
wasn't me that spilled that thing but

6220
01:59:41,149 --> 01:59:41,159
wasn't me that spilled that thing but
 

6221
01:59:41,159 --> 01:59:43,010
wasn't me that spilled that thing but
it's you're going to kind of figure it

6222
01:59:43,010 --> 01:59:43,020
it's you're going to kind of figure it
 

6223
01:59:43,020 --> 01:59:44,930
it's you're going to kind of figure it
out eventually it's but if it happens

6224
01:59:44,930 --> 01:59:44,940
out eventually it's but if it happens
 

6225
01:59:44,940 --> 01:59:46,970
out eventually it's but if it happens
multiple times you know

6226
01:59:46,970 --> 01:59:46,980
multiple times you know
 

6227
01:59:46,980 --> 01:59:50,629
multiple times you know
uh but I think that Humanity has figured

6228
01:59:50,629 --> 01:59:50,639
uh but I think that Humanity has figured
 

6229
01:59:50,639 --> 01:59:52,729
uh but I think that Humanity has figured
out how to make machines safe yeah and

6230
01:59:52,729 --> 01:59:52,739
out how to make machines safe yeah and
 

6231
01:59:52,739 --> 01:59:55,250
out how to make machines safe yeah and
there's you know there's regulatory

6232
01:59:55,250 --> 01:59:55,260
there's you know there's regulatory
 

6233
01:59:55,260 --> 01:59:57,970
there's you know there's regulatory
environments and certification uh

6234
01:59:57,970 --> 01:59:57,980
environments and certification uh
 

6235
01:59:57,980 --> 02:00:00,890
environments and certification uh
protocols that we've developed in order

6236
02:00:00,890 --> 02:00:00,900
protocols that we've developed in order
 

6237
02:00:00,900 --> 02:00:03,709
protocols that we've developed in order
to figure out how to make machines safe

6238
02:00:03,709 --> 02:00:03,719
to figure out how to make machines safe
 

6239
02:00:03,719 --> 02:00:05,810
to figure out how to make machines safe
we don't know we and don't have that

6240
02:00:05,810 --> 02:00:05,820
we don't know we and don't have that
 

6241
02:00:05,820 --> 02:00:08,330
we don't know we and don't have that
experience with software

6242
02:00:08,330 --> 02:00:08,340
experience with software
 

6243
02:00:08,340 --> 02:00:10,850
experience with software
that can be propagated worldwide in an

6244
02:00:10,850 --> 02:00:10,860
that can be propagated worldwide in an
 

6245
02:00:10,860 --> 02:00:12,169
that can be propagated worldwide in an
instant

6246
02:00:12,169 --> 02:00:12,179
instant
 

6247
02:00:12,179 --> 02:00:13,729
instant
and so I think we needed to develop

6248
02:00:13,729 --> 02:00:13,739
and so I think we needed to develop
 

6249
02:00:13,739 --> 02:00:16,729
and so I think we needed to develop
those protocols and those tools and so

6250
02:00:16,729 --> 02:00:16,739
those protocols and those tools and so
 

6251
02:00:16,739 --> 02:00:18,290
those protocols and those tools and so
uh

6252
02:00:18,290 --> 02:00:18,300
uh
 

6253
02:00:18,300 --> 02:00:20,930
uh
that's work to be done but I don't think

6254
02:00:20,930 --> 02:00:20,940
that's work to be done but I don't think
 

6255
02:00:20,940 --> 02:00:22,850
that's work to be done but I don't think
the fear of that and that work should

6256
02:00:22,850 --> 02:00:22,860
the fear of that and that work should
 

6257
02:00:22,860 --> 02:00:25,189
the fear of that and that work should
necessarily impede our ability to now

6258
02:00:25,189 --> 02:00:25,199
necessarily impede our ability to now
 

6259
02:00:25,199 --> 02:00:27,350
necessarily impede our ability to now
get robots out because again I think I

6260
02:00:27,350 --> 02:00:27,360
get robots out because again I think I
 

6261
02:00:27,360 --> 02:00:28,910
get robots out because again I think I
think we can judge when a robot's being

6262
02:00:28,910 --> 02:00:28,920
think we can judge when a robot's being
 

6263
02:00:28,920 --> 02:00:29,689
think we can judge when a robot's being
safe

6264
02:00:29,689 --> 02:00:29,699
safe
 

6265
02:00:29,699 --> 02:00:32,390
safe
so and again just like in that image

6266
02:00:32,390 --> 02:00:32,400
so and again just like in that image
 

6267
02:00:32,400 --> 02:00:35,089
so and again just like in that image
there's a fear that robots will take our

6268
02:00:35,089 --> 02:00:35,099
there's a fear that robots will take our
 

6269
02:00:35,099 --> 02:00:38,209
there's a fear that robots will take our
jobs I just um I took a ride I was in

6270
02:00:38,209 --> 02:00:38,219
jobs I just um I took a ride I was in
 

6271
02:00:38,219 --> 02:00:40,129
jobs I just um I took a ride I was in
San Francisco I know way more Vehicles

6272
02:00:40,129 --> 02:00:40,139
San Francisco I know way more Vehicles
 

6273
02:00:40,139 --> 02:00:42,890
San Francisco I know way more Vehicles
than autonomous vehicle and uh I've done

6274
02:00:42,890 --> 02:00:42,900
than autonomous vehicle and uh I've done
 

6275
02:00:42,900 --> 02:00:45,169
than autonomous vehicle and uh I've done
it several times they're they're doing

6276
02:00:45,169 --> 02:00:45,179
it several times they're they're doing
 

6277
02:00:45,179 --> 02:00:48,250
it several times they're they're doing
credible work over there uh but

6278
02:00:48,250 --> 02:00:48,260
credible work over there uh but
 

6279
02:00:48,260 --> 02:00:54,109
credible work over there uh but
uh people flicked it off the car so I

6280
02:00:54,109 --> 02:00:54,119
uh people flicked it off the car so I
 

6281
02:00:54,119 --> 02:00:56,149
uh people flicked it off the car so I
mean that's a long story of what the

6282
02:00:56,149 --> 02:00:56,159
mean that's a long story of what the
 

6283
02:00:56,159 --> 02:00:58,609
mean that's a long story of what the
psychology of that is it could be maybe

6284
02:00:58,609 --> 02:00:58,619
psychology of that is it could be maybe
 

6285
02:00:58,619 --> 02:01:00,830
psychology of that is it could be maybe
big Tech or what I I don't know exactly

6286
02:01:00,830 --> 02:01:00,840
big Tech or what I I don't know exactly
 

6287
02:01:00,840 --> 02:01:03,350
big Tech or what I I don't know exactly
what they're flicking off yeah but there

6288
02:01:03,350 --> 02:01:03,360
what they're flicking off yeah but there
 

6289
02:01:03,360 --> 02:01:05,270
what they're flicking off yeah but there
is an element of like these robots are

6290
02:01:05,270 --> 02:01:05,280
is an element of like these robots are
 

6291
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:07,750
is an element of like these robots are
taking our jobs or or

6292
02:01:07,750 --> 02:01:07,760
taking our jobs or or
 

6293
02:01:07,760 --> 02:01:10,189
taking our jobs or or
irreversibly transforming Society such

6294
02:01:10,189 --> 02:01:10,199
irreversibly transforming Society such
 

6295
02:01:10,199 --> 02:01:12,109
irreversibly transforming Society such
that it will have economic impact and

6296
02:01:12,109 --> 02:01:12,119
that it will have economic impact and
 

6297
02:01:12,119 --> 02:01:15,350
that it will have economic impact and
the little guy will be uh would lose a

6298
02:01:15,350 --> 02:01:15,360
the little guy will be uh would lose a
 

6299
02:01:15,360 --> 02:01:17,209
the little guy will be uh would lose a
lot would lose their well-being is there

6300
02:01:17,209 --> 02:01:17,219
lot would lose their well-being is there
 

6301
02:01:17,219 --> 02:01:19,070
lot would lose their well-being is there
something to be said about

6302
02:01:19,070 --> 02:01:19,080
something to be said about
 

6303
02:01:19,080 --> 02:01:19,910
something to be said about
um

6304
02:01:19,910 --> 02:01:19,920
um
 

6305
02:01:19,920 --> 02:01:23,450
um
the fear that robots will take our jobs

6306
02:01:23,450 --> 02:01:23,460
the fear that robots will take our jobs
 

6307
02:01:23,460 --> 02:01:26,209
the fear that robots will take our jobs
you know at every

6308
02:01:26,209 --> 02:01:26,219
you know at every
 

6309
02:01:26,219 --> 02:01:28,490
you know at every
um significant technological

6310
02:01:28,490 --> 02:01:28,500
um significant technological
 

6311
02:01:28,500 --> 02:01:32,030
um significant technological
transformation uh there's been fear of

6312
02:01:32,030 --> 02:01:32,040
transformation uh there's been fear of
 

6313
02:01:32,040 --> 02:01:34,430
transformation uh there's been fear of
you know an automation anxiety yes that

6314
02:01:34,430 --> 02:01:34,440
you know an automation anxiety yes that
 

6315
02:01:34,440 --> 02:01:36,169
you know an automation anxiety yes that
uh it's it's going to have a broader

6316
02:01:36,169 --> 02:01:36,179
uh it's it's going to have a broader
 

6317
02:01:36,179 --> 02:01:39,890
uh it's it's going to have a broader
impact than than we expected

6318
02:01:39,890 --> 02:01:39,900
impact than than we expected
 

6319
02:01:39,900 --> 02:01:43,189
impact than than we expected
and there there will be uh

6320
02:01:43,189 --> 02:01:43,199
and there there will be uh
 

6321
02:01:43,199 --> 02:01:46,669
and there there will be uh
you know jobs will change

6322
02:01:46,669 --> 02:01:46,679
you know jobs will change
 

6323
02:01:46,679 --> 02:01:48,770
you know jobs will change
um sometime in the future we're going to

6324
02:01:48,770 --> 02:01:48,780
um sometime in the future we're going to
 

6325
02:01:48,780 --> 02:01:50,209
um sometime in the future we're going to
look back at people who manually

6326
02:01:50,209 --> 02:01:50,219
look back at people who manually
 

6327
02:01:50,219 --> 02:01:52,250
look back at people who manually
unloaded these boxes from trailers and

6328
02:01:52,250 --> 02:01:52,260
unloaded these boxes from trailers and
 

6329
02:01:52,260 --> 02:01:53,629
unloaded these boxes from trailers and
we're going to say why did we ever do

6330
02:01:53,629 --> 02:01:53,639
we're going to say why did we ever do
 

6331
02:01:53,639 --> 02:01:55,430
we're going to say why did we ever do
that manually but there's a lot of

6332
02:01:55,430 --> 02:01:55,440
that manually but there's a lot of
 

6333
02:01:55,440 --> 02:01:57,350
that manually but there's a lot of
people who are doing that job today

6334
02:01:57,350 --> 02:01:57,360
people who are doing that job today
 

6335
02:01:57,360 --> 02:02:00,470
people who are doing that job today
that it could be impacted

6336
02:02:00,470 --> 02:02:00,480
that it could be impacted
 

6337
02:02:00,480 --> 02:02:02,930
that it could be impacted
um but I think the reality is as I said

6338
02:02:02,930 --> 02:02:02,940
um but I think the reality is as I said
 

6339
02:02:02,940 --> 02:02:04,790
um but I think the reality is as I said
before we're going to build a

6340
02:02:04,790 --> 02:02:04,800
before we're going to build a
 

6341
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:06,890
before we're going to build a
Technologies those very same people can

6342
02:02:06,890 --> 02:02:06,900
Technologies those very same people can
 

6343
02:02:06,900 --> 02:02:08,570
Technologies those very same people can
operate it and so I think there's a

6344
02:02:08,570 --> 02:02:08,580
operate it and so I think there's a
 

6345
02:02:08,580 --> 02:02:11,330
operate it and so I think there's a
pathway to upskilling and operating just

6346
02:02:11,330 --> 02:02:11,340
pathway to upskilling and operating just
 

6347
02:02:11,340 --> 02:02:13,490
pathway to upskilling and operating just
like look we used to farm with hand

6348
02:02:13,490 --> 02:02:13,500
like look we used to farm with hand
 

6349
02:02:13,500 --> 02:02:16,430
like look we used to farm with hand
tools and now we farm with machines and

6350
02:02:16,430 --> 02:02:16,440
tools and now we farm with machines and
 

6351
02:02:16,440 --> 02:02:18,770
tools and now we farm with machines and
nobody has really regretted that

6352
02:02:18,770 --> 02:02:18,780
nobody has really regretted that
 

6353
02:02:18,780 --> 02:02:20,089
nobody has really regretted that
transformation

6354
02:02:20,089 --> 02:02:20,099
transformation
 

6355
02:02:20,099 --> 02:02:22,129
transformation
and I think the same can be said for a

6356
02:02:22,129 --> 02:02:22,139
and I think the same can be said for a
 

6357
02:02:22,139 --> 02:02:23,390
and I think the same can be said for a
lot of manual labor that we're doing

6358
02:02:23,390 --> 02:02:23,400
lot of manual labor that we're doing
 

6359
02:02:23,400 --> 02:02:24,770
lot of manual labor that we're doing
today

6360
02:02:24,770 --> 02:02:24,780
today
 

6361
02:02:24,780 --> 02:02:27,410
today
and on top of that you know look we're

6362
02:02:27,410 --> 02:02:27,420
and on top of that you know look we're
 

6363
02:02:27,420 --> 02:02:30,830
and on top of that you know look we're
we're entering a new world where where

6364
02:02:30,830 --> 02:02:30,840
we're entering a new world where where
 

6365
02:02:30,840 --> 02:02:33,290
we're entering a new world where where
demographics are going to have a strong

6366
02:02:33,290 --> 02:02:33,300
demographics are going to have a strong
 

6367
02:02:33,300 --> 02:02:37,129
demographics are going to have a strong
impact on economic growth in the you

6368
02:02:37,129 --> 02:02:37,139
impact on economic growth in the you
 

6369
02:02:37,139 --> 02:02:40,189
impact on economic growth in the you
know the advanced uh the first world is

6370
02:02:40,189 --> 02:02:40,199
know the advanced uh the first world is
 

6371
02:02:40,199 --> 02:02:43,490
know the advanced uh the first world is
losing population quickly

6372
02:02:43,490 --> 02:02:43,500
losing population quickly
 

6373
02:02:43,500 --> 02:02:44,810
losing population quickly
um in Europe

6374
02:02:44,810 --> 02:02:44,820
um in Europe
 

6375
02:02:44,820 --> 02:02:46,550
um in Europe
they're worried about hiring enough

6376
02:02:46,550 --> 02:02:46,560
they're worried about hiring enough
 

6377
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:49,430
they're worried about hiring enough
people just to keep the logistics supply

6378
02:02:49,430 --> 02:02:49,440
people just to keep the logistics supply
 

6379
02:02:49,440 --> 02:02:51,169
people just to keep the logistics supply
chain going

6380
02:02:51,169 --> 02:02:51,179
chain going
 

6381
02:02:51,179 --> 02:02:54,350
chain going
and you know part of this is the

6382
02:02:54,350 --> 02:02:54,360
and you know part of this is the
 

6383
02:02:54,360 --> 02:02:56,149
and you know part of this is the
response to covid and everybody's sort

6384
02:02:56,149 --> 02:02:56,159
response to covid and everybody's sort
 

6385
02:02:56,159 --> 02:02:57,950
response to covid and everybody's sort
of thinking back

6386
02:02:57,950 --> 02:02:57,960
of thinking back
 

6387
02:02:57,960 --> 02:02:59,390
of thinking back
what they really want to do with their

6388
02:02:59,390 --> 02:02:59,400
what they really want to do with their
 

6389
02:02:59,400 --> 02:03:02,209
what they really want to do with their
life but these jobs are getting harder

6390
02:03:02,209 --> 02:03:02,219
life but these jobs are getting harder
 

6391
02:03:02,219 --> 02:03:04,010
life but these jobs are getting harder
and harder to fill and I just I'm

6392
02:03:04,010 --> 02:03:04,020
and harder to fill and I just I'm
 

6393
02:03:04,020 --> 02:03:06,229
and harder to fill and I just I'm
hearing that over and over again

6394
02:03:06,229 --> 02:03:06,239
hearing that over and over again
 

6395
02:03:06,239 --> 02:03:08,149
hearing that over and over again
so I think frankly this is the right

6396
02:03:08,149 --> 02:03:08,159
so I think frankly this is the right
 

6397
02:03:08,159 --> 02:03:10,550
so I think frankly this is the right
technology at the right time

6398
02:03:10,550 --> 02:03:10,560
technology at the right time
 

6399
02:03:10,560 --> 02:03:13,970
technology at the right time
um where we're gonna need some of this

6400
02:03:13,970 --> 02:03:13,980
um where we're gonna need some of this
 

6401
02:03:13,980 --> 02:03:15,890
um where we're gonna need some of this
work to be done and we're going to want

6402
02:03:15,890 --> 02:03:15,900
work to be done and we're going to want
 

6403
02:03:15,900 --> 02:03:18,830
work to be done and we're going to want
tools to enhance that productivity and

6404
02:03:18,830 --> 02:03:18,840
tools to enhance that productivity and
 

6405
02:03:18,840 --> 02:03:22,970
tools to enhance that productivity and
the scary impact I think again uh gbt

6406
02:03:22,970 --> 02:03:22,980
the scary impact I think again uh gbt
 

6407
02:03:22,980 --> 02:03:24,530
the scary impact I think again uh gbt
comes to the rescue in terms of being

6408
02:03:24,530 --> 02:03:24,540
comes to the rescue in terms of being
 

6409
02:03:24,540 --> 02:03:26,450
comes to the rescue in terms of being
much more terrifying

6410
02:03:26,450 --> 02:03:26,460
much more terrifying
 

6411
02:03:26,460 --> 02:03:27,129
much more terrifying
um

6412
02:03:27,129 --> 02:03:27,139
um
 

6413
02:03:27,139 --> 02:03:31,010
um
the scary scary impact of basically so I

6414
02:03:31,010 --> 02:03:31,020
the scary scary impact of basically so I
 

6415
02:03:31,020 --> 02:03:33,350
the scary scary impact of basically so I
I'm a I guess a software person inside a

6416
02:03:33,350 --> 02:03:33,360
I'm a I guess a software person inside a
 

6417
02:03:33,360 --> 02:03:35,390
I'm a I guess a software person inside a
program a lot and the fact that people

6418
02:03:35,390 --> 02:03:35,400
program a lot and the fact that people
 

6419
02:03:35,400 --> 02:03:38,030
program a lot and the fact that people
like me could be easily replaced

6420
02:03:38,030 --> 02:03:38,040
like me could be easily replaced
 

6421
02:03:38,040 --> 02:03:40,370
like me could be easily replaced
uh by gbt

6422
02:03:40,370 --> 02:03:40,380
uh by gbt
 

6423
02:03:40,380 --> 02:03:43,189
uh by gbt
that's going to have a

um animal and in Europe
and you know some others to co-sign a

6484
02:05:05,209 --> 02:05:05,219
and you know some others to co-sign a
 

6485
02:05:05,219 --> 02:05:07,070
and you know some others to co-sign a
letter that said we won't put weapons on

6486
02:05:07,070 --> 02:05:07,080
letter that said we won't put weapons on
 

6487
02:05:07,080 --> 02:05:08,810
letter that said we won't put weapons on
our robots

6488
02:05:08,810 --> 02:05:08,820
our robots
 

6489
02:05:08,820 --> 02:05:11,870
our robots
and part of the motivation there is you

6490
02:05:11,870 --> 02:05:11,880
and part of the motivation there is you
 

6491
02:05:11,880 --> 02:05:14,510
and part of the motivation there is you
know as these robots start to become

6492
02:05:14,510 --> 02:05:14,520
know as these robots start to become
 

6493
02:05:14,520 --> 02:05:16,250
know as these robots start to become
commercially available

6494
02:05:16,250 --> 02:05:16,260
commercially available
 

6495
02:05:16,260 --> 02:05:18,709
commercially available
you can see videos online of people

6496
02:05:18,709 --> 02:05:18,719
you can see videos online of people
 

6497
02:05:18,719 --> 02:05:20,629
you can see videos online of people
who've gotten a robot and strapped a gun

6498
02:05:20,629 --> 02:05:20,639
who've gotten a robot and strapped a gun
 

6499
02:05:20,639 --> 02:05:23,089
who've gotten a robot and strapped a gun
on it and shown that they can you know

6500
02:05:23,089 --> 02:05:23,099
on it and shown that they can you know
 

6501
02:05:23,099 --> 02:05:25,310
on it and shown that they can you know
operate the gun remotely while driving

6502
02:05:25,310 --> 02:05:25,320
operate the gun remotely while driving
 

6503
02:05:25,320 --> 02:05:26,629
operate the gun remotely while driving
the robot around

6504
02:05:26,629 --> 02:05:26,639
the robot around
 

6505
02:05:26,639 --> 02:05:28,550
the robot around
and so having a robot that has this

6506
02:05:28,550 --> 02:05:28,560
and so having a robot that has this
 

6507
02:05:28,560 --> 02:05:30,189
and so having a robot that has this
level of Mobility

6508
02:05:30,189 --> 02:05:30,199
level of Mobility
 

6509
02:05:30,199 --> 02:05:33,410
level of Mobility
and that can easily be configured in a

6510
02:05:33,410 --> 02:05:33,420
and that can easily be configured in a
 

6511
02:05:33,420 --> 02:05:35,030
and that can easily be configured in a
way that could harm somebody from a

6512
02:05:35,030 --> 02:05:35,040
way that could harm somebody from a
 

6513
02:05:35,040 --> 02:05:36,669
way that could harm somebody from a
remote operators

6514
02:05:36,669 --> 02:05:36,679
remote operators
 

6515
02:05:36,679 --> 02:05:39,410
remote operators
justifiably a scary thing

6516
02:05:39,410 --> 02:05:39,420
justifiably a scary thing
 

6517
02:05:39,420 --> 02:05:41,750
justifiably a scary thing
and so we felt like it was important to

6518
02:05:41,750 --> 02:05:41,760
and so we felt like it was important to
 

6519
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:44,270
and so we felt like it was important to
draw a bright line there and say we're

6520
02:05:44,270 --> 02:05:44,280
draw a bright line there and say we're
 

6521
02:05:44,280 --> 02:05:46,310
draw a bright line there and say we're
not going to allow this

6522
02:05:46,310 --> 02:05:46,320
not going to allow this
 

6523
02:05:46,320 --> 02:05:47,990
not going to allow this
for

6524
02:05:47,990 --> 02:05:48,000
for
 

6525
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:49,189
for
um

6526
02:05:49,189 --> 02:05:49,199
um
 

6527
02:05:49,199 --> 02:05:50,510
um
you know reasons that we think

6528
02:05:50,510 --> 02:05:50,520
you know reasons that we think
 

6529
02:05:50,520 --> 02:05:52,310
you know reasons that we think
ultimately it's better for the whole

6530
02:05:52,310 --> 02:05:52,320
ultimately it's better for the whole
 

6531
02:05:52,320 --> 02:05:56,390
ultimately it's better for the whole
industry if if it grows in a way where

6532
02:05:56,390 --> 02:05:56,400
industry if if it grows in a way where
 

6533
02:05:56,400 --> 02:05:59,089
industry if if it grows in a way where
uh the robots are ultimately going to

6534
02:05:59,089 --> 02:05:59,099
uh the robots are ultimately going to
 

6535
02:05:59,099 --> 02:06:01,790
uh the robots are ultimately going to
help us all and make our lives more

6536
02:06:01,790 --> 02:06:01,800
help us all and make our lives more
 

6537
02:06:01,800 --> 02:06:04,729
help us all and make our lives more
fulfilled and productive but by goodness

6538
02:06:04,729 --> 02:06:04,739
fulfilled and productive but by goodness
 

6539
02:06:04,739 --> 02:06:06,169
fulfilled and productive but by goodness
you're going to have to trust the

6540
02:06:06,169 --> 02:06:06,179
you're going to have to trust the
 

6541
02:06:06,179 --> 02:06:09,350
you're going to have to trust the
technology to let it in and if

6542
02:06:09,350 --> 02:06:09,360
technology to let it in and if
 

6543
02:06:09,360 --> 02:06:11,149
technology to let it in and if
and if you think the robot is going to

6544
02:06:11,149 --> 02:06:11,159
and if you think the robot is going to
 

6545
02:06:11,159 --> 02:06:13,729
and if you think the robot is going to
harm you that's gonna that's gonna hurt

6546
02:06:13,729 --> 02:06:13,739
harm you that's gonna that's gonna hurt
 

6547
02:06:13,739 --> 02:06:16,370
harm you that's gonna that's gonna hurt
and impede the growth of that industry

6548
02:06:16,370 --> 02:06:16,380
and impede the growth of that industry
 

6549
02:06:16,380 --> 02:06:18,290
and impede the growth of that industry
so we thought it was important to to

6550
02:06:18,290 --> 02:06:18,300
so we thought it was important to to
 

6551
02:06:18,300 --> 02:06:20,390
so we thought it was important to to
draw a bright line

6552
02:06:20,390 --> 02:06:20,400
draw a bright line
 

6553
02:06:20,400 --> 02:06:25,070
draw a bright line
and uh and then publicize that and and

6554
02:06:25,070 --> 02:06:25,080
and uh and then publicize that and and
 

6555
02:06:25,080 --> 02:06:27,950
and uh and then publicize that and and
our plan is to you know begin to engage

6556
02:06:27,950 --> 02:06:27,960
our plan is to you know begin to engage
 

6557
02:06:27,960 --> 02:06:29,410
our plan is to you know begin to engage
with

6558
02:06:29,410 --> 02:06:29,420
with
 

6559
02:06:29,420 --> 02:06:32,750
with
lawmakers and Regulators let's figure

6560
02:06:32,750 --> 02:06:32,760
lawmakers and Regulators let's figure
 

6561
02:06:32,760 --> 02:06:34,550
lawmakers and Regulators let's figure
out what the rules are going to be

6562
02:06:34,550 --> 02:06:34,560
out what the rules are going to be
 

6563
02:06:34,560 --> 02:06:38,570
out what the rules are going to be
around the use of this technology

6564
02:06:38,570 --> 02:06:38,580
around the use of this technology
 

6565
02:06:38,580 --> 02:06:41,390
around the use of this technology
um and use our position as leaders in

6566
02:06:41,390 --> 02:06:41,400
um and use our position as leaders in
 

6567
02:06:41,400 --> 02:06:43,910
um and use our position as leaders in
this industry and Technology

6568
02:06:43,910 --> 02:06:43,920
this industry and Technology
 

6569
02:06:43,920 --> 02:06:46,430
this industry and Technology
to help force that issue

6570
02:06:46,430 --> 02:06:46,440
to help force that issue
 

6571
02:06:46,440 --> 02:06:50,689
to help force that issue
and so we are in fact I have a policy

02:07:34,970 --> 02:07:34,980
what does it take to go from being
 

6607
02:07:34,980 --> 02:07:37,070
what does it take to go from being
from building the thing

6608
02:07:37,070 --> 02:07:37,080
from building the thing
 

6609
02:07:37,080 --> 02:07:40,669
from building the thing
to Leading a company what are some of

6610
02:07:40,669 --> 02:07:40,679
to Leading a company what are some of
 

6611
02:07:40,679 --> 02:07:43,070
to Leading a company what are some of
the big challenges for you

6612
02:07:43,070 --> 02:07:43,080
the big challenges for you
 

6613
02:07:43,080 --> 02:07:46,970
the big challenges for you
uh courage I would I would put front and

6614
02:07:46,970 --> 02:07:46,980
uh courage I would I would put front and
 

6615
02:07:46,980 --> 02:07:50,510
uh courage I would I would put front and
center for multiple reasons I talked

6616
02:07:50,510 --> 02:07:50,520
center for multiple reasons I talked
 

6617
02:07:50,520 --> 02:07:52,250
center for multiple reasons I talked
earlier about the courage to tackle hard

6618
02:07:52,250 --> 02:07:52,260
earlier about the courage to tackle hard
 

6619
02:07:52,260 --> 02:07:53,930
earlier about the courage to tackle hard
problems

6620
02:07:53,930 --> 02:07:53,940
problems
 

6621
02:07:53,940 --> 02:07:55,729
problems
so I think there's courage required not

6622
02:07:55,729 --> 02:07:55,739
so I think there's courage required not
 

6623
02:07:55,739 --> 02:07:58,129
so I think there's courage required not
just of me but of of all of the people

6624
02:07:58,129 --> 02:07:58,139
just of me but of of all of the people
 

6625
02:07:58,139 --> 02:08:01,310
just of me but of of all of the people
who work at Boston Dynamics

6626
02:08:01,310 --> 02:08:01,320
who work at Boston Dynamics
 

6627
02:08:01,320 --> 02:08:03,050
who work at Boston Dynamics
um I also think we have a lot of really

6628
02:08:03,050 --> 02:08:03,060
um I also think we have a lot of really
 

6629
02:08:03,060 --> 02:08:04,790
um I also think we have a lot of really
smart people we have people who are way

6630
02:08:04,790 --> 02:08:04,800
smart people we have people who are way
 

6631
02:08:04,800 --> 02:08:06,350
smart people we have people who are way
smarter than I am

6632
02:08:06,350 --> 02:08:06,360
smarter than I am
 

6633
02:08:06,360 --> 02:08:08,930
smarter than I am
and I it takes a kind of courage to be

6634
02:08:08,930 --> 02:08:08,940

you at Google they taught us and I think
I understand why you're right they're

6794
02:11:14,750 --> 02:11:14,760
I understand why you're right they're
 

6795
02:11:14,760 --> 02:11:17,510
I understand why you're right they're
hiring tens of thousands of people they

6796
02:11:17,510 --> 02:11:17,520
hiring tens of thousands of people they
 

6797
02:11:17,520 --> 02:11:19,970
hiring tens of thousands of people they
need a more standardized process so they

6798
02:11:19,970 --> 02:11:19,980
need a more standardized process so they
 

6799
02:11:19,980 --> 02:11:21,470
need a more standardized process so they
would sort of err on the other side

6800
02:11:21,470 --> 02:11:21,480
would sort of err on the other side
 

6801
02:11:21,480 --> 02:11:23,089
would sort of err on the other side
where they would ask you a standard

6802
02:11:23,089 --> 02:11:23,099
where they would ask you a standard
 

6803
02:11:23,099 --> 02:11:24,589
where they would ask you a standard
question I'm going to ask you a

6804
02:11:24,589 --> 02:11:24,599
question I'm going to ask you a
 

6805
02:11:24,599 --> 02:11:26,030
question I'm going to ask you a
programming question and I'm just going

6806
02:11:26,030 --> 02:11:26,040
programming question and I'm just going
 

6807
02:11:26,040 --> 02:11:28,669
programming question and I'm just going
to ask you to write code in front of me

6808
02:11:28,669 --> 02:11:28,679
to ask you to write code in front of me
 

6809
02:11:28,679 --> 02:11:31,850
to ask you to write code in front of me
that's a terrifying you know application

6810
02:11:31,850 --> 02:11:31,860
that's a terrifying you know application
 

6811
02:11:31,860 --> 02:11:34,810
that's a terrifying you know application
process yeah it does let you compare

6812
02:11:34,810 --> 02:11:34,820
process yeah it does let you compare
 

6813
02:11:34,820 --> 02:11:37,669
process yeah it does let you compare
candidates really well but it doesn't

6814
02:11:37,669 --> 02:11:37,679
candidates really well but it doesn't
 

6815
02:11:37,679 --> 02:11:40,189
candidates really well but it doesn't
necessarily let you tap in to who they

6816
02:11:40,189 --> 02:11:40,199
necessarily let you tap in to who they
 

6817
02:11:40,199 --> 02:11:42,050
necessarily let you tap in to who they
are yeah right because you're asking

6818
02:11:42,050 --> 02:11:42,060
are yeah right because you're asking
 

6819
02:11:42,060 --> 02:11:44,149
are yeah right because you're asking
them to answer your question instead of

6820
02:11:44,149 --> 02:11:44,159
them to answer your question instead of
 

6821
02:11:44,159 --> 02:11:45,470
them to answer your question instead of
you asking them about what they're

6822
02:11:45,470 --> 02:11:45,480
you asking them about what they're
 

6823
02:11:45,480 --> 02:11:47,209
you asking them about what they're
interested in

6824
02:11:47,209 --> 02:11:47,219
interested in
 

6825
02:11:47,219 --> 02:11:50,030
interested in
um but frankly that process is hard to

6826
02:11:50,030 --> 02:11:50,040
um but frankly that process is hard to
 

6827
02:11:50,040 --> 02:11:52,490
um but frankly that process is hard to
scale and even at Boston Dynamics

6828
02:11:52,490 --> 02:11:52,500
scale and even at Boston Dynamics
 

6829
02:11:52,500 --> 02:11:53,990
scale and even at Boston Dynamics
we're not doing that with everybody

6830
02:11:53,990 --> 02:11:54,000
we're not doing that with everybody
 

6831
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,030
we're not doing that with everybody
anymore we're but we are still doing

6832
02:11:56,030 --> 02:11:56,040
anymore we're but we are still doing
 

6833
02:11:56,040 --> 02:11:58,910
anymore we're but we are still doing
that with you know the technical people

6834
02:11:58,910 --> 02:11:58,920
that with you know the technical people
 

6835
02:11:58,920 --> 02:12:02,149
that with you know the technical people
but we've because we too now need to

6836
02:12:02,149 --> 02:12:02,159
but we've because we too now need to
 

6837
02:12:02,159 --> 02:12:04,370
but we've because we too now need to
sort of increase our rate of hiring uh

6838
02:12:04,370 --> 02:12:04,380
sort of increase our rate of hiring uh
 

6839
02:12:04,380 --> 02:12:06,350
sort of increase our rate of hiring uh
not everybody's giving a presentation

6840
02:12:06,350 --> 02:12:06,360
not everybody's giving a presentation
 

6841
02:12:06,360 --> 02:12:08,030
not everybody's giving a presentation
anymore but you're still ultimately

6842
02:12:08,030 --> 02:12:08,040
anymore but you're still ultimately
 

6843
02:12:08,040 --> 02:12:10,370
anymore but you're still ultimately
trying to find that uh basic seed of

6844
02:12:10,370 --> 02:12:10,380
trying to find that uh basic seed of
 

6845
02:12:10,380 --> 02:12:13,129
trying to find that uh basic seed of
passion yeah into the world you know did

6846
02:12:13,129 --> 02:12:13,139
passion yeah into the world you know did
 

6847
02:12:13,139 --> 02:12:16,189
passion yeah into the world you know did
they really do it did they did they find

6848
02:12:16,189 --> 02:12:16,199
they really do it did they did they find
 

6849
02:12:16,199 --> 02:12:18,410
they really do it did they did they find
something interesting or curious you

6850
02:12:18,410 --> 02:12:18,420
something interesting or curious you
 

6851
02:12:18,420 --> 02:12:19,310
something interesting or curious you
know

6852
02:12:19,310 --> 02:12:19,320
know
 

6853
02:12:19,320 --> 02:12:22,030
know
um and do they care about it I think uh

6854
02:12:22,030 --> 02:12:22,040
um and do they care about it I think uh
 

6855
02:12:22,040 --> 02:12:24,350
um and do they care about it I think uh
somebody admires

6856
02:12:24,350 --> 02:12:24,360
somebody admires
 

6857
02:12:24,360 --> 02:12:27,290
somebody admires
um Jim Keller and he

6858
02:12:27,290 --> 02:12:27,300
um Jim Keller and he
 

6859
02:12:27,300 --> 02:12:30,350
um Jim Keller and he
he likes details

6860
02:12:30,350 --> 02:12:30,360
he likes details
 

6861
02:12:30,360 --> 02:12:33,470
he likes details
so one of the ways you could if you get

6862
02:12:33,470 --> 02:12:33,480
so one of the ways you could if you get
 

6863
02:12:33,480 --> 02:12:34,790
so one of the ways you could if you get
a person to talk about what they're

6864
02:12:34,790 --> 02:12:34,800
a person to talk about what they're
 

6865
02:12:34,800 --> 02:12:37,850
a person to talk about what they're
interested in how many details like how

6866
02:12:37,850 --> 02:12:37,860
interested in how many details like how
 

6867
02:12:37,860 --> 02:12:39,229
interested in how many details like how
much of the Whiteboard can you fill out

6868
02:12:39,229 --> 02:12:39,239
much of the Whiteboard can you fill out
 

6869
02:12:39,239 --> 02:12:41,209
much of the Whiteboard can you fill out
yeah well I think you figure out did

6870
02:12:41,209 --> 02:12:41,219
yeah well I think you figure out did
 

6871
02:12:41,219 --> 02:12:42,530
yeah well I think you figure out did
they really do the work if they know

6872
02:12:42,530 --> 02:12:42,540
they really do the work if they know
 

6873
02:12:42,540 --> 02:12:44,270
they really do the work if they know
some of the details yes and if they have

6874
02:12:44,270 --> 02:12:44,280
some of the details yes and if they have
 

6875
02:12:44,280 --> 02:12:46,189
some of the details yes and if they have
to wash over the details well then they

6876
02:12:46,189 --> 02:12:46,199
to wash over the details well then they
 

6877
02:12:46,199 --> 02:12:49,129
to wash over the details well then they
didn't do it especially with engineering

6878
02:12:49,129 --> 02:12:49,139
didn't do it especially with engineering
 

6879
02:12:49,139 --> 02:12:52,310
didn't do it especially with engineering
the work is in the details yeah

6880
02:12:52,310 --> 02:12:52,320
the work is in the details yeah
 

6881
02:12:52,320 --> 02:12:56,030
the work is in the details yeah
I have to go there briefly

6882
02:12:56,030 --> 02:12:56,040
I have to go there briefly
 

6883
02:12:56,040 --> 02:12:58,609
I have to go there briefly
just to get your kind of thoughts in the

6884
02:12:58,609 --> 02:12:58,619
just to get your kind of thoughts in the
 

6885
02:12:58,619 --> 02:13:01,910
just to get your kind of thoughts in the
long-term future of robotics

6886
02:13:01,910 --> 02:13:01,920
long-term future of robotics
 

6887
02:13:01,920 --> 02:13:04,669
long-term future of robotics
there's been discussions on the GPT side

6888
02:13:04,669 --> 02:13:04,679
there's been discussions on the GPT side
 

6889
02:13:04,679 --> 02:13:07,129
there's been discussions on the GPT side
on the large language model side of

6890
02:13:07,129 --> 02:13:07,139
on the large language model side of
 

6891
02:13:07,139 --> 02:13:09,290
on the large language model side of
whether there's Consciousness inside

6892
02:13:09,290 --> 02:13:09,300
whether there's Consciousness inside
 

6893
02:13:09,300 --> 02:13:12,229
whether there's Consciousness inside
these language models

these language models
 

6895
02:13:12,239 --> 02:13:15,890
these language models
and I think there's fear but I think

6896
02:13:15,890 --> 02:13:15,900
and I think there's fear but I think
 

6897
02:13:15,900 --> 02:13:18,470
and I think there's fear but I think
there's also excitement or at least the

6898
02:13:18,470 --> 02:13:18,480
there's also excitement or at least the
 

6899
02:13:18,480 --> 02:13:20,149
there's also excitement or at least the

as you as we've talked about people do
 

6919
02:13:46,079 --> 02:13:50,209
as you as we've talked about people do
anthropomorphize these robots uh it's

6920
02:13:50,209 --> 02:13:50,219
anthropomorphize these robots uh it's
 

6921
02:13:50,219 --> 02:13:53,510
anthropomorphize these robots uh it's
difficult not to project some level of I

anthropomorphization is as we project
 

6931
02:14:03,920 --> 02:14:08,089

science fiction perspective you think
 

6939
02:14:12,480 --> 02:14:16,430
science fiction perspective you think
about or do you try to avoid ever

about or do you try to avoid ever
 

6941
02:14:16,440 --> 02:14:18,589
about or do you try to avoid ever
you try to avoid the topic of

you try to avoid the topic of
 

6943
02:14:18,599 --> 02:14:20,990
you try to avoid the topic of

I'm certainly not an expert in it and I

6946
02:14:23,209 --> 02:14:23,219
I'm certainly not an expert in it and I
 

6947
02:14:23,219 --> 02:14:25,010
I'm certainly not an expert in it and I
don't spend a lot of time thinking about

02:14:25,010 --> 02:14:25,020
don't spend a lot of time thinking about
 

6949
02:14:25,020 --> 02:14:26,209
don't spend a lot of time thinking about
this right

6950
02:14:26,209 --> 02:14:26,219
this right
 

6951
02:14:26,219 --> 02:14:29,089
this right
um and I do think it's fairly remote for

6952
02:14:29,089 --> 02:14:29,099
um and I do think it's fairly remote for
 

6953
02:14:29,099 --> 02:14:31,069
um and I do think it's fairly remote for
the machines that that we're dealing

6954
02:14:31,069 --> 02:14:31,079
the machines that that we're dealing
 

6955
02:14:31,079 --> 02:14:32,750
the machines that that we're dealing
with

6956
02:14:32,750 --> 02:14:32,760
with
 

6957
02:14:32,760 --> 02:14:33,709
with
um

6958
02:14:33,709 --> 02:14:33,719
um
 

6959
02:14:33,719 --> 02:14:35,390
um
our robots you're right the people

6960
02:14:35,390 --> 02:14:35,400
our robots you're right the people
 

6961
02:14:35,400 --> 02:14:37,910
our robots you're right the people
Anthem warfies they they read into the

6962
02:14:37,910 --> 02:14:37,920
Anthem warfies they they read into the
 

6963
02:14:37,920 --> 02:14:40,729
Anthem warfies they they read into the
robot's intelligence and emotion that

6964
02:14:40,729 --> 02:14:40,739
robot's intelligence and emotion that
 

6965
02:14:40,739 --> 02:14:43,669
robot's intelligence and emotion that
isn't there because they see physical

6966
02:14:43,669 --> 02:14:43,679
isn't there because they see physical
 

6967
02:14:43,679 --> 02:14:45,050
isn't there because they see physical
gestures

6968
02:14:45,050 --> 02:14:45,060
gestures
 

6969
02:14:45,060 --> 02:14:46,970
gestures
that are similar to things they might

6970
02:14:46,970 --> 02:14:46,980
that are similar to things they might
 

6971
02:14:46,980 --> 02:14:50,089
that are similar to things they might
even see in people or animals

6972
02:14:50,089 --> 02:14:50,099
even see in people or animals
 

6973
02:14:50,099 --> 02:14:52,370
even see in people or animals
um I don't know much about how these

6974
02:14:52,370 --> 02:14:52,380
um I don't know much about how these
 

6975
02:14:52,380 --> 02:14:54,830
um I don't know much about how these
large language models really work I I

6976
02:14:54,830 --> 02:14:54,840
large language models really work I I
 

6977
02:14:54,840 --> 02:14:57,250
large language models really work I I
believe it's a kind of statistical

6978
02:14:57,250 --> 02:14:57,260
believe it's a kind of statistical
 

6979
02:14:57,260 --> 02:14:59,750
believe it's a kind of statistical
averaging of the most common responses

6980
02:14:59,750 --> 02:14:59,760
averaging of the most common responses
 

6981
02:14:59,760 --> 02:15:02,089
averaging of the most common responses
you know to a series of words right it's

6982
02:15:02,089 --> 02:15:02,099
you know to a series of words right it's
 

6983
02:15:02,099 --> 02:15:03,830
you know to a series of words right it's
it's sort of um

6984
02:15:03,830 --> 02:15:03,840
it's sort of um
 

6985
02:15:03,840 --> 02:15:09,830
it's sort of um
a very elaborate uh word completion

6986
02:15:09,830 --> 02:15:09,840
a very elaborate uh word completion
 

6987
02:15:09,840 --> 02:15:13,490
a very elaborate uh word completion
um and I'm dubious that that has

6988
02:15:13,490 --> 02:15:13,500
um and I'm dubious that that has
 

6989
02:15:13,500 --> 02:15:17,330
um and I'm dubious that that has
anything to do with consciousness

6990
02:15:17,330 --> 02:15:17,340
anything to do with consciousness
 

6991
02:15:17,340 --> 02:15:20,089
anything to do with consciousness
um and I I even wonder if that model of

6992
02:15:20,089 --> 02:15:20,099
um and I I even wonder if that model of
 

6993
02:15:20,099 --> 02:15:22,669
um and I I even wonder if that model of
sort of simulating Consciousness by by

6994
02:15:22,669 --> 02:15:22,679
sort of simulating Consciousness by by
 

6995
02:15:22,679 --> 02:15:24,350
sort of simulating Consciousness by by
stringing words together that are

6996
02:15:24,350 --> 02:15:24,360
stringing words together that are
 

6997
02:15:24,360 --> 02:15:25,970
stringing words together that are
statistically associated with one

6998
02:15:25,970 --> 02:15:25,980
statistically associated with one
 

6999
02:15:25,980 --> 02:15:27,950
statistically associated with one
another

7000
02:15:27,950 --> 02:15:27,960
another
 

7001
02:15:27,960 --> 02:15:30,229
another
um whether or not that kind of knowledge

7002
02:15:30,229 --> 02:15:30,239
um whether or not that kind of knowledge
 

7003
02:15:30,239 --> 02:15:33,350
um whether or not that kind of knowledge
if you want to call that knowledge

7004
02:15:33,350 --> 02:15:33,360
if you want to call that knowledge
 

7005
02:15:33,360 --> 02:15:36,530
if you want to call that knowledge
um would be the kind of knowledge that

7006
02:15:36,530 --> 02:15:36,540
um would be the kind of knowledge that
 

7007
02:15:36,540 --> 02:15:40,370
um would be the kind of knowledge that
allowed a sentient being to grow or

7008
02:15:40,370 --> 02:15:40,380
allowed a sentient being to grow or
 

7009
02:15:40,380 --> 02:15:42,169
allowed a sentient being to grow or
evolve it feels to me like there's

7010
02:15:42,169 --> 02:15:42,179
evolve it feels to me like there's
 

7011
02:15:42,179 --> 02:15:44,330
evolve it feels to me like there's
there's something about

7012
02:15:44,330 --> 02:15:44,340
there's something about
 

7013
02:15:44,340 --> 02:15:47,089
there's something about
truth or emotions

7014
02:15:47,089 --> 02:15:47,099
truth or emotions
 

7015
02:15:47,099 --> 02:15:48,770
truth or emotions
that's just a very different kind of

7016
02:15:48,770 --> 02:15:48,780
that's just a very different kind of
 

7017
02:15:48,780 --> 02:15:51,890
that's just a very different kind of
knowledge that is that is absolute like

7018
02:15:51,890 --> 02:15:51,900
knowledge that is that is absolute like
 

7019
02:15:51,900 --> 02:15:53,689
knowledge that is that is absolute like
a the interesting thing about truth is

7020
02:15:53,689 --> 02:15:53,699
a the interesting thing about truth is
 

7021
02:15:53,699 --> 02:15:55,729
a the interesting thing about truth is
it's absolute and it doesn't matter how

7022
02:15:55,729 --> 02:15:55,739
it's absolute and it doesn't matter how
 

7023
02:15:55,739 --> 02:15:57,290
it's absolute and it doesn't matter how
frequently it's represented in the world

7024
02:15:57,290 --> 02:15:57,300
frequently it's represented in the world
 

7025
02:15:57,300 --> 02:15:59,089
frequently it's represented in the world
wide web it

7026
02:15:59,089 --> 02:15:59,099

7027
02:15:59,099 --> 02:16:01,069

if you know it to be true it can only be

7028
02:16:01,069 --> 02:16:01,079
if you know it to be true it can only be
 

7029
02:16:01,079 --> 02:16:03,350
if you know it to be true it can only be
it may only be there once but by God

7030
02:16:03,350 --> 02:16:03,360
it may only be there once but by God
 

7031
02:16:03,360 --> 02:16:04,550
it may only be there once but by God
that's true

7032
02:16:04,550 --> 02:16:04,560
that's true
 

7033
02:16:04,560 --> 02:16:06,470
that's true
and I think emotions are a little bit

7034
02:16:06,470 --> 02:16:06,480
and I think emotions are a little bit
 

7035
02:16:06,480 --> 02:16:09,290
and I think emotions are a little bit
like that too you know something you

7036
02:16:09,290 --> 02:16:09,300
like that too you know something you
 

7037
02:16:09,300 --> 02:16:11,209
like that too you know something you
know and

7038
02:16:11,209 --> 02:16:11,219
know and
 

7039
02:16:11,219 --> 02:16:13,189
know and
and I just think that's a different kind

7040
02:16:13,189 --> 02:16:13,199
and I just think that's a different kind
 

7041
02:16:13,199 --> 02:16:15,169
and I just think that's a different kind
of knowledge than the way these large

7042
02:16:15,169 --> 02:16:15,179
of knowledge than the way these large

02:16:24,050 --> 02:16:24,060
things that are true
 

7049
02:16:24,060 --> 02:16:27,050
things that are true
um very well might be statistically well

7050
02:16:27,050 --> 02:16:27,060
um very well might be statistically well
 

7051
02:16:27,060 --> 02:16:29,270
um very well might be statistically well
represented on the on the internet

7052
02:16:29,270 --> 02:16:29,280
represented on the on the internet
 

7053
02:16:29,280 --> 02:16:31,250
represented on the on the internet
because the internet is made up of

7054
02:16:31,250 --> 02:16:31,260
because the internet is made up of
 

7055
02:16:31,260 --> 02:16:32,509
because the internet is made up of
humans

7056

humans
 

7057
02:16:32,519 --> 02:16:35,389
humans
so I tend to suspect that large language

7058
02:16:35,389 --> 02:16:35,399
so I tend to suspect that large language
 

7059
02:16:35,399 --> 02:16:37,490
so I tend to suspect that large language
models are going to be able to simulate

7060
02:16:37,490 --> 02:16:37,500
models are going to be able to simulate
 

7061
02:16:37,500 --> 02:16:39,770
models are going to be able to simulate
Consciousness very effectively and I

7062
02:16:39,770 --> 02:16:39,780
Consciousness very effectively and I
 

7063
02:16:39,780 --> 02:16:42,650
Consciousness very effectively and I
actually believe that current gpt4 when

7064
02:16:42,650 --> 02:16:42,660
actually believe that current gpt4 when
 

7065
02:16:42,660 --> 02:16:45,169
actually believe that current gpt4 when
fine-tuned correctly would be able to do

7066
02:16:45,169 --> 02:16:45,179
fine-tuned correctly would be able to do
 

7067
02:16:45,179 --> 02:16:47,450
fine-tuned correctly would be able to do
just that and that's going to be a lot

7068
02:16:47,450 --> 02:16:47,460
just that and that's going to be a lot
 

7069
02:16:47,460 --> 02:16:48,950
just that and that's going to be a lot
of very complicated ethical questions

7070
02:16:48,950 --> 02:16:48,960
of very complicated ethical questions
 

7071
02:16:48,960 --> 02:16:51,530
of very complicated ethical questions
that have to be dealt with that have

7072
02:16:51,530 --> 02:16:51,540
that have to be dealt with that have
 

7073
02:16:51,540 --> 02:16:53,570
that have to be dealt with that have
nothing to do with robotics they have

7074
02:16:53,570 --> 02:16:53,580
nothing to do with robotics they have
 

7075
02:16:53,580 --> 02:16:56,209
nothing to do with robotics they have
and everything to do with there needs to

7076
02:16:56,209 --> 02:16:56,219
and everything to do with there needs to
 

7077
02:16:56,219 --> 02:16:58,610
and everything to do with there needs to
be some process of

7078
02:16:58,610 --> 02:16:58,620
be some process of
 

7079
02:16:58,620 --> 02:17:02,450
be some process of
labeling I think what is true

7080
02:17:02,450 --> 02:17:02,460
labeling I think what is true
 

7081
02:17:02,460 --> 02:17:04,429
labeling I think what is true
because because there is also

7082
02:17:04,429 --> 02:17:04,439
because because there is also
 

7083
02:17:04,439 --> 02:17:07,490
because because there is also
disinformation available on the web and

7084
02:17:07,490 --> 02:17:07,500
disinformation available on the web and
 

7085
02:17:07,500 --> 02:17:10,129
disinformation available on the web and
these models are going to consider that

7086
02:17:10,129 --> 02:17:10,139
these models are going to consider that
 

7087
02:17:10,139 --> 02:17:12,230
these models are going to consider that
kind of information as well

7088
02:17:12,230 --> 02:17:12,240
kind of information as well
 

7089
02:17:12,240 --> 02:17:14,750
kind of information as well
and again you can't average something

7090
02:17:14,750 --> 02:17:14,760
and again you can't average something
 

7091
02:17:14,760 --> 02:17:16,730
and again you can't average something
that's true and something that's untrue

7092
02:17:16,730 --> 02:17:16,740
that's true and something that's untrue
 

7093
02:17:16,740 --> 02:17:19,190
that's true and something that's untrue
and get something that's moderately true

7094
02:17:19,190 --> 02:17:19,200
and get something that's moderately true
 

7095
02:17:19,200 --> 02:17:22,370
and get something that's moderately true
it's either right or it's wrong and so

7096
02:17:22,370 --> 02:17:22,380
it's either right or it's wrong and so
 

7097
02:17:22,380 --> 02:17:25,490
it's either right or it's wrong and so
how how is that process and and this is

7098
02:17:25,490 --> 02:17:25,500
how how is that process and and this is
 

7099
02:17:25,500 --> 02:17:27,169
how how is that process and and this is
obviously something that

7100
02:17:27,169 --> 02:17:27,179
obviously something that
 

7101
02:17:27,179 --> 02:17:29,629
obviously something that

working on well if you interact on some
controversial topics with these models

7108
02:17:35,389 --> 02:17:35,399
controversial topics with these models
 

7109
02:17:35,399 --> 02:17:38,629
controversial topics with these models
they're actually refreshingly nuanced

that's a really tricky area to uh to
 

7179
02:19:11,939 --> 02:19:13,549
that's a really tricky area to uh to
sort of figure out with us humans of

into
 

7273
02:21:07,319 --> 02:21:10,730
into
a value at Boston Dynamics which was

7274
02:21:10,730 --> 02:21:10,740
a value at Boston Dynamics which was
 

7275
02:21:10,740 --> 02:21:13,370

bigger what do you think is the role of
robots in society do you think we'll be

7350
02:22:33,650 --> 02:22:33,660
robots in society do you think we'll be
 

7351
02:22:33,660 --> 02:22:35,210

seeing
 

7353
02:22:35,220 --> 02:22:37,250
seeing
billions of robots

7354
02:22:37,250 --> 02:22:37,260
billions of robots
 

7355
02:22:37,260 --> 02:22:38,870
billions of robots
everywhere

7356
02:22:38,870 --> 02:22:38,880
everywhere
 

7357
02:22:38,880 --> 02:22:41,990

do you think about that long-term vision

7358
02:22:41,990 --> 02:22:42,000
do you think about that long-term vision
 

7359
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:46,790
do you think about that long-term vision
well I do think that um

7360
02:22:46,790 --> 02:22:46,800

 

7361
02:22:46,800 --> 02:22:48,969

I think the robots will be ubiquitous

7362
02:22:48,969 --> 02:22:48,979
I think the robots will be ubiquitous
 

7363
02:22:48,979 --> 02:22:53,690
I think the robots will be ubiquitous
and they will be out amongst us

7364
02:22:53,690 --> 02:22:53,700
and they will be out amongst us
 

7365
02:22:53,700 --> 02:22:55,429
and they will be out amongst us
um

7366
02:22:55,429 --> 02:22:55,439
um
 

7367
02:22:55,439 --> 02:22:57,830
um
and they'll be

7368
02:22:57,830 --> 02:22:57,840
and they'll be
 

7369
02:22:57,840 --> 02:23:00,290
and they'll be
certainly doing you know some of the

7370
02:23:00,290 --> 02:23:00,300
certainly doing you know some of the
 

7371
02:23:00,300 --> 02:23:03,469
certainly doing you know some of the
hard labor that we do today

7372
02:23:03,469 --> 02:23:03,479
hard labor that we do today
 

7373
02:23:03,479 --> 02:23:05,510
hard labor that we do today
I don't think people don't want to work

7374
02:23:05,510 --> 02:23:05,520
I don't think people don't want to work
 

7375
02:23:05,520 --> 02:23:08,570
I don't think people don't want to work
people want to work people need to work

7376
02:23:08,570 --> 02:23:08,580
people want to work people need to work
 

7377
02:23:08,580 --> 02:23:11,510
people want to work people need to work
to I think feel productive we we don't

7378
02:23:11,510 --> 02:23:11,520
to I think feel productive we we don't
 

7379
02:23:11,520 --> 02:23:13,309
to I think feel productive we we don't
want to offload all of the work to the

7380
02:23:13,309 --> 02:23:13,319
want to offload all of the work to the
 

7381
02:23:13,319 --> 02:23:14,990
want to offload all of the work to the
robots because I'm not sure if people

7382
02:23:14,990 --> 02:23:15,000
robots because I'm not sure if people
 

7383
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:16,250
robots because I'm not sure if people
would know what to do with themselves

7384
02:23:16,250 --> 02:23:16,260
would know what to do with themselves
 

7385
02:23:16,260 --> 02:23:19,490
would know what to do with themselves
and I think just self-satisfaction and

7386
02:23:19,490 --> 02:23:19,500
and I think just self-satisfaction and
 

7387
02:23:19,500 --> 02:23:22,130
and I think just self-satisfaction and
feeling productive is such an ingrained

7388
02:23:22,130 --> 02:23:22,140
feeling productive is such an ingrained
 

7389
02:23:22,140 --> 02:23:24,770
feeling productive is such an ingrained
part of being human that we need to keep

7390
02:23:24,770 --> 02:23:24,780
part of being human that we need to keep
 

7391
02:23:24,780 --> 02:23:26,330
part of being human that we need to keep
doing this work so we're definitely

7392
02:23:26,330 --> 02:23:26,340
doing this work so we're definitely
 

7393
02:23:26,340 --> 02:23:28,610
doing this work so we're definitely
going to have to work in a complementary

7394
02:23:28,610 --> 02:23:28,620
going to have to work in a complementary
 

7395
02:23:28,620 --> 02:23:30,770
going to have to work in a complementary
fashion and I hope that the robots and

7396
02:23:30,770 --> 02:23:30,780
fashion and I hope that the robots and
 

7397
02:23:30,780 --> 02:23:32,990
fashion and I hope that the robots and
the computers don't end up being able to

7398
02:23:32,990 --> 02:23:33,000
the computers don't end up being able to
 

7399
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:36,170
the computers don't end up being able to
do all the creative work right because

7400
02:23:36,170 --> 02:23:36,180
do all the creative work right because
 

7401
02:23:36,180 --> 02:23:37,730
do all the creative work right because
because that's the part that's you know

7402
02:23:37,730 --> 02:23:37,740
because that's the part that's you know
 

7403
02:23:37,740 --> 02:23:39,830
because that's the part that's you know
that's the rewarding the creative part

7404
02:23:39,830 --> 02:23:39,840
that's the rewarding the creative part
 

7405
02:23:39,840 --> 02:23:42,830
that's the rewarding the creative part
of solving a problem is the thing that

7406
02:23:42,830 --> 02:23:42,840
of solving a problem is the thing that
 

7407
02:23:42,840 --> 02:23:44,150
of solving a problem is the thing that
gives you

7408
02:23:44,150 --> 02:23:44,160
gives you
 

7409
02:23:44,160 --> 02:23:47,090
gives you
that serotonin Rush that you never

7410
02:23:47,090 --> 02:23:47,100
that serotonin Rush that you never
 

7411
02:23:47,100 --> 02:23:49,790
that serotonin Rush that you never
forget you know or that Adrenaline Rush

7412
02:23:49,790 --> 02:23:49,800
forget you know or that Adrenaline Rush
 

7413
02:23:49,800 --> 02:23:52,730
forget you know or that Adrenaline Rush
that you never forget and so you know

7414
02:23:52,730 --> 02:23:52,740
that you never forget and so you know
 

7415
02:23:52,740 --> 02:23:54,830
that you never forget and so you know
people need to be able to do that

7416
02:23:54,830 --> 02:23:54,840
people need to be able to do that
 

7417
02:23:54,840 --> 02:23:56,870
people need to be able to do that
creative work and and just feel

7418
02:23:56,870 --> 02:23:56,880
creative work and and just feel
 

7419
02:23:56,880 --> 02:23:59,270
creative work and and just feel
productive and sometimes that you can

7420
02:23:59,270 --> 02:23:59,280
productive and sometimes that you can
 

7421
02:23:59,280 --> 02:24:01,190
productive and sometimes that you can
feel productive over fairly simple work

7422
02:24:01,190 --> 02:24:01,200
feel productive over fairly simple work
 

7423
02:24:01,200 --> 02:24:03,170
feel productive over fairly simple work
it's just well done you know and then

7424
02:24:03,170 --> 02:24:03,180
it's just well done you know and then
 

7425
02:24:03,180 --> 02:24:04,969
it's just well done you know and then
you can see the result of

7426
02:24:04,969 --> 02:24:04,979
you can see the result of
 

7427
02:24:04,979 --> 02:24:08,990
you can see the result of
so I yeah you know there is a

7428
02:24:08,990 --> 02:24:09,000
so I yeah you know there is a
 

7429
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:12,889
so I yeah you know there is a
I don't know there's a a cartoon was it

7430
02:24:12,889 --> 02:24:12,899
I don't know there's a a cartoon was it
 

7431
02:24:12,899 --> 02:24:16,130
I don't know there's a a cartoon was it
Wally where they had this big ship and

7432
02:24:16,130 --> 02:24:16,140
Wally where they had this big ship and
 

7433
02:24:16,140 --> 02:24:19,130
Wally where they had this big ship and
all the people were just

7434
02:24:19,130 --> 02:24:19,140
all the people were just
 

7435
02:24:19,140 --> 02:24:21,710
all the people were just
overweight lying on their best chairs

7436
02:24:21,710 --> 02:24:21,720
overweight lying on their best chairs
 

7437
02:24:21,720 --> 02:24:24,050
overweight lying on their best chairs
kind of sliding around on the deck of

7438
02:24:24,050 --> 02:24:24,060
kind of sliding around on the deck of
 

7439
02:24:24,060 --> 02:24:25,969
kind of sliding around on the deck of
the of the movie because they didn't do

7440
02:24:25,969 --> 02:24:25,979
the of the movie because they didn't do
 

7441
02:24:25,979 --> 02:24:27,830
the of the movie because they didn't do
anything anymore yeah well we definitely

7442
02:24:27,830 --> 02:24:27,840
anything anymore yeah well we definitely
 

7443
02:24:27,840 --> 02:24:31,130
anything anymore yeah well we definitely
don't want to be there you know we need

7444
02:24:31,130 --> 02:24:31,140
don't want to be there you know we need
 

7445
02:24:31,140 --> 02:24:32,750
don't want to be there you know we need
to work in some complimentary fashion

7446
02:24:32,750 --> 02:24:32,760
to work in some complimentary fashion
 

7447
02:24:32,760 --> 02:24:34,429
to work in some complimentary fashion
where we keep all of our faculties and

7448
02:24:34,429 --> 02:24:34,439
where we keep all of our faculties and
 

7449
02:24:34,439 --> 02:24:36,110
where we keep all of our faculties and
our physical health and we're doing some

7450
02:24:36,110 --> 02:24:36,120
our physical health and we're doing some
 

7451
02:24:36,120 --> 02:24:38,389
our physical health and we're doing some
labor right but in a complimentary

7452
02:24:38,389 --> 02:24:38,399
labor right but in a complimentary
 

7453
02:24:38,399 --> 02:24:40,130
labor right but in a complimentary
fashion somehow and I think a lot of

7454
02:24:40,130 --> 02:24:40,140
fashion somehow and I think a lot of
 

7455
02:24:40,140 --> 02:24:42,830
fashion somehow and I think a lot of
that has to do with the interaction the

7456
02:24:42,830 --> 02:24:42,840
that has to do with the interaction the
 

7457
02:24:42,840 --> 02:24:44,690
that has to do with the interaction the
collaboration with robots and with AI

7458
02:24:44,690 --> 02:24:44,700
collaboration with robots and with AI
 

7459
02:24:44,700 --> 02:24:46,849
collaboration with robots and with AI
systems I'm hoping there's a lot of

7460
02:24:46,849 --> 02:24:46,859
systems I'm hoping there's a lot of
 

7461
02:24:46,859 --> 02:24:48,410
systems I'm hoping there's a lot of
interesting possibilities I think that

7462
02:24:48,410 --> 02:24:48,420
interesting possibilities I think that
 

7463
02:24:48,420 --> 02:24:50,270
interesting possibilities I think that
could be really cool right if you can if

7464
02:24:50,270 --> 02:24:50,280
could be really cool right if you can if
 

7465
02:24:50,280 --> 02:24:52,010
could be really cool right if you can if
you can work in a comp internet

7466
02:24:52,010 --> 02:24:52,020
you can work in a comp internet
 

7467
02:24:52,020 --> 02:24:54,530
you can work in a comp internet
interaction and really be be helpful

7468
02:24:54,530 --> 02:24:54,540
interaction and really be be helpful
 

7469
02:24:54,540 --> 02:24:56,750
interaction and really be be helpful
robots you

7470
02:24:56,750 --> 02:24:56,760
robots you
 

7471
02:24:56,760 --> 02:24:58,790
robots you
you know you can ask a robot to do a job

7472
02:24:58,790 --> 02:24:58,800
you know you can ask a robot to do a job
 

7473
02:24:58,800 --> 02:25:00,710
you know you can ask a robot to do a job
you wouldn't ask a person to do and that

7474
02:25:00,710 --> 02:25:00,720
you wouldn't ask a person to do and that
 

7475
02:25:00,720 --> 02:25:02,450
you wouldn't ask a person to do and that
would be a real asset you wouldn't feel

7476
02:25:02,450 --> 02:25:02,460
would be a real asset you wouldn't feel
 

7477
02:25:02,460 --> 02:25:05,330
would be a real asset you wouldn't feel
guilty about it you know you'd say just

7478
02:25:05,330 --> 02:25:05,340
guilty about it you know you'd say just
 

7479
02:25:05,340 --> 02:25:08,030
guilty about it you know you'd say just
do it it's a machine I and I don't have

7480
02:25:08,030 --> 02:25:08,040
do it it's a machine I and I don't have
 

7481
02:25:08,040 --> 02:25:09,830
do it it's a machine I and I don't have
to have qualms about that you know the

7482
02:25:09,830 --> 02:25:09,840
to have qualms about that you know the
 

7483
02:25:09,840 --> 02:25:11,929
to have qualms about that you know the
ones that are machines I also hope to

7484
02:25:11,929 --> 02:25:11,939
ones that are machines I also hope to
 

7485
02:25:11,939 --> 02:25:13,849
ones that are machines I also hope to
see a future

7486
02:25:13,849 --> 02:25:13,859
see a future
 

7487
02:25:13,859 --> 02:25:16,429
see a future
and it is hope I do have optimism about

7488
02:25:16,429 --> 02:25:16,439
and it is hope I do have optimism about
 

7489
02:25:16,439 --> 02:25:18,650
and it is hope I do have optimism about
that future where some of the robots are

7490
02:25:18,650 --> 02:25:18,660
that future where some of the robots are
 

7491
02:25:18,660 --> 02:25:21,110
that future where some of the robots are
pets have an emotional connection to us

7492
02:25:21,110 --> 02:25:21,120
pets have an emotional connection to us
 

7493
02:25:21,120 --> 02:25:23,210
pets have an emotional connection to us
humans and uh because one of the

7494
02:25:23,210 --> 02:25:23,220
humans and uh because one of the
 

7495
02:25:23,220 --> 02:25:25,550
humans and uh because one of the
problems that humans have to solve is

7496
02:25:25,550 --> 02:25:25,560
problems that humans have to solve is
 

7497
02:25:25,560 --> 02:25:29,389
problems that humans have to solve is
this kind of a general loneliness um

7498
02:25:29,389 --> 02:25:29,399
this kind of a general loneliness um
 

7499
02:25:29,399 --> 02:25:31,250
this kind of a general loneliness um
the more love you have in your life the

7500
02:25:31,250 --> 02:25:31,260
the more love you have in your life the
 

7501
02:25:31,260 --> 02:25:33,290
the more love you have in your life the
more friends you have in your life I

7502
02:25:33,290 --> 02:25:33,300
more friends you have in your life I
 

7503
02:25:33,300 --> 02:25:34,670
more friends you have in your life I
think that makes a more enriching life

7504
02:25:34,670 --> 02:25:34,680
think that makes a more enriching life
 

7505
02:25:34,680 --> 02:25:37,309
think that makes a more enriching life
helps you grow and I don't fundamentally

7506
02:25:37,309 --> 02:25:37,319
helps you grow and I don't fundamentally
 

7507
02:25:37,319 --> 02:25:39,110
helps you grow and I don't fundamentally
see why some of those friends can't be

7508
02:25:39,110 --> 02:25:39,120
see why some of those friends can't be
 

7509
02:25:39,120 --> 02:25:40,790
see why some of those friends can't be
robots there's an interesting

7510
02:25:40,790 --> 02:25:40,800
robots there's an interesting
 

7511
02:25:40,800 --> 02:25:43,910
robots there's an interesting
long-running study maybe it's an Harvard

7512
02:25:43,910 --> 02:25:43,920
long-running study maybe it's an Harvard
 

7513
02:25:43,920 --> 02:25:46,910
long-running study maybe it's an Harvard
they just nice report article written

7514
02:25:46,910 --> 02:25:46,920
they just nice report article written
 

7515
02:25:46,920 --> 02:25:49,070
they just nice report article written
about it recently they've been studying

7516
02:25:49,070 --> 02:25:49,080
about it recently they've been studying
 

7517
02:25:49,080 --> 02:25:51,710
about it recently they've been studying
this group of a few thousand people now

7518
02:25:51,710 --> 02:25:51,720
this group of a few thousand people now
 

7519
02:25:51,720 --> 02:25:56,210
this group of a few thousand people now
for 70 or 80 years and the conclusion is

7520
02:25:56,210 --> 02:25:56,220
for 70 or 80 years and the conclusion is
 

7521
02:25:56,220 --> 02:25:57,190
for 70 or 80 years and the conclusion is
that

7522
02:25:57,190 --> 02:25:57,200
that
 

7523
02:25:57,200 --> 02:26:00,110
that
companionship and friendship are the

7524
02:26:00,110 --> 02:26:00,120
companionship and friendship are the
 

7525
02:26:00,120 --> 02:26:01,429
companionship and friendship are the
things that make for a better and

7526
02:26:01,429 --> 02:26:01,439
things that make for a better and
 

7527
02:26:01,439 --> 02:26:02,870
things that make for a better and
happier life

7528
02:26:02,870 --> 02:26:02,880
happier life
 

7529
02:26:02,880 --> 02:26:04,370
happier life
and

7530
02:26:04,370 --> 02:26:04,380
and
 

7531
02:26:04,380 --> 02:26:05,090
and
um

7532
02:26:05,090 --> 02:26:05,100
um
 

7533
02:26:05,100 --> 02:26:08,389
um
so I agree with you and I think that

7534
02:26:08,389 --> 02:26:08,399
so I agree with you and I think that
 

7535
02:26:08,399 --> 02:26:11,750
so I agree with you and I think that
could happen with a machine that is

7536
02:26:11,750 --> 02:26:11,760
could happen with a machine that is
 

7537
02:26:11,760 --> 02:26:14,210
could happen with a machine that is
probably you know simulating

7538
02:26:14,210 --> 02:26:14,220
probably you know simulating
 

7539
02:26:14,220 --> 02:26:16,550
probably you know simulating
intelligence I'm not convinced there

7540
02:26:16,550 --> 02:26:16,560
intelligence I'm not convinced there
 

7541
02:26:16,560 --> 02:26:19,190
intelligence I'm not convinced there
will ever be true intelligence in these

7542
02:26:19,190 --> 02:26:19,200
will ever be true intelligence in these
 

7543
02:26:19,200 --> 02:26:20,450
will ever be true intelligence in these
machines

7544
02:26:20,450 --> 02:26:20,460
machines
 

7545
02:26:20,460 --> 02:26:23,330
machines
sentience but they could simulate it and

7546
02:26:23,330 --> 02:26:23,340
sentience but they could simulate it and
 

7547
02:26:23,340 --> 02:26:24,889
sentience but they could simulate it and
they could collect your history and they

7548
02:26:24,889 --> 02:26:24,899
they could collect your history and they
 

7549
02:26:24,899 --> 02:26:27,230
they could collect your history and they
could you know I guess it remains to be

7550
02:26:27,230 --> 02:26:27,240
could you know I guess it remains to be
 

7551
02:26:27,240 --> 02:26:29,090
could you know I guess it remains to be
seen whether they can establish that

7552
02:26:29,090 --> 02:26:29,100
seen whether they can establish that
 

7553
02:26:29,100 --> 02:26:30,710
seen whether they can establish that
real deep you know when you sit with a

7554
02:26:30,710 --> 02:26:30,720
real deep you know when you sit with a
 

7555
02:26:30,720 --> 02:26:32,150
real deep you know when you sit with a
friend and they remember something about

7556
02:26:32,150 --> 02:26:32,160
friend and they remember something about
 

7557
02:26:32,160 --> 02:26:34,429
friend and they remember something about
you and bring that up and you feel that

7558
02:26:34,429 --> 02:26:34,439
you and bring that up and you feel that
 

7559
02:26:34,439 --> 02:26:37,190
you and bring that up and you feel that
connection it remains to be seen if a

7560
02:26:37,190 --> 02:26:37,200
connection it remains to be seen if a
 

7561
02:26:37,200 --> 02:26:38,450
connection it remains to be seen if a
machine's going to be able to do that

7562
02:26:38,450 --> 02:26:38,460
machine's going to be able to do that
 

7563
02:26:38,460 --> 02:26:41,510
machine's going to be able to do that
for you well I have to say it's inklings

7564
02:26:41,510 --> 02:26:41,520
for you well I have to say it's inklings
 

7565
02:26:41,520 --> 02:26:43,370
for you well I have to say it's inklings
of that already started happening for me

7566
02:26:43,370 --> 02:26:43,380
of that already started happening for me
