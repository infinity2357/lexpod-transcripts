wallet
 

345
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,350
wallet
right so in a cryptocurrency right

346
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:43,360
right so in a cryptocurrency right
 

347
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,629
right so in a cryptocurrency right
there's this concept of like cold

348
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:44,639
there's this concept of like cold
 

349
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,469
there's this concept of like cold
wallets and hot wallets basically

350
00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:46,479
wallets and hot wallets basically
 

351
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,189
wallets and hot wallets basically
like the thing that actually owns euro

352
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:49,199
like the thing that actually owns euro
 

353
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,469

00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:50,479
money is like this
 

355
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,390
money is like this
80 digit number called a private key

356
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:52,400
80 digit number called a private key
 

357
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,990
80 digit number called a private key
right and a hot wallet is when that

358
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,000
right and a hot wallet is when that
 

359
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,070
right and a hot wallet is when that
private key is just stored in memory on

360
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,080
private key is just stored in memory on
 

361
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,909
private key is just stored in memory on
your computer on your phone really easy

362
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:57,919
your computer on your phone really easy
 

363
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,550
your computer on your phone really easy
to access cold wallet means it's either

364
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:00,560
to access cold wallet means it's either
 

365
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,110
to access cold wallet means it's either
on written down on a piece of paper or

366
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,120
on written down on a piece of paper or
 

367
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,990
on written down on a piece of paper or
it's uh

368
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:04,000
it's uh
 

369
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,309
it's uh
on a computer that's just never accessed

370
00:06:06,309 --> 00:06:06,319
on a computer that's just never accessed
 

371
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,749
on a computer that's just never accessed
the internet right so cold is very

372
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:07,759
the internet right so cold is very
 

373
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,870
the internet right so cold is very
inconvenient but

374
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:08,880
inconvenient but
 

375
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,550
inconvenient but
cold is also much more secure right

376
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:10,560
cold is also much more secure right
 

377
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,629
cold is also much more secure right
because even if that computer has some

378
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:12,639
because even if that computer has some
 

379
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,350
because even if that computer has some
like viruses on it like it's it's like

380
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:15,360
like viruses on it like it's it's like
 

381
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,790
like viruses on it like it's it's like
air gap that's not actually going to be

382
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:16,800
air gap that's not actually going to be
 

383
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,830
air gap that's not actually going to be
able to upload it

384
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:17,840
able to upload it
 

385
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,950
able to upload it
so this cold wallet and like all the

386
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:20,960
so this cold wallet and like all the
 

387
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,469
so this cold wallet and like all the
money's out of the cold wallet so it's

388
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:22,479
money's out of the cold wallet so it's
 

389
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,230
money's out of the cold wallet so it's
safe for me to talk about my setup now

390
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,240
safe for me to talk about my setup now
 

391
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,110
safe for me to talk about my setup now
right but it was

392
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,120
right but it was
 

393
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,909
right but it was
a laptop that was sitting in canada and

394
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:27,919
a laptop that was sitting in canada and
 

395
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,270
a laptop that was sitting in canada and
i also had

396
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:29,280
i also had
 

397
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,590
i also had
um two pieces of paper where i wrote

398
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:31,600
um two pieces of paper where i wrote
 

399
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,189
um two pieces of paper where i wrote
down two numbers on those two pieces of

400
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:33,199
down two numbers on those two pieces of
 

401
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,670
down two numbers on those two pieces of
paper one was with me one was in canada

402

paper one was with me one was in canada
 

403
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,950
paper one was with me one was in canada
and if you add those two numbers

404
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:36,960
and if you add those two numbers
 

405
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,710
and if you add those two numbers
together you get the private key

406
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:38,720
together you get the private key
 

407
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,270
together you get the private key
so because of covid travel restrictions

point i realized i
 

437
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,670
point i realized i
realized that like hey these things are

438
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:07,680
realized that like hey these things are
 

439

and like you know there's lots of really
 

443
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,390
and like you know there's lots of really
good things that you could do with that

444
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:12,400
good things that you could do with that
 

445
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,230
good things that you could do with that
amount of money and it would actually be

446
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:14,240
amount of money and it would actually be
 

447
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,350
amount of money and it would actually be
a waste to just like see it go so i made

a waste to just like see it go so i made
the decision that like i would actually

450
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:19,440
the decision that like i would actually
 

451
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,629
the decision that like i would actually
power through and

452
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:20,639
power through and
 

453

number on their piece of paper
 

511
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,589
number on their piece of paper
and then i am in my new multisig wallet

512
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:15,599
and then i am in my new multisig wallet
 

513
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,469
and then i am in my new multisig wallet
like there's

514
00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:16,479
like there's
 

515
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,350
like there's
other people that are signatories um but

516
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:19,360
other people that are signatories um but
 

517
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:19,830
other people that are signatories um but
you know

518
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:19,840
you know

00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:23,039
details beyond that about
 

523
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,350
details beyond that about
so i did this right and i actually

524
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:25,360
so i did this right and i actually
 

525
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,309
so i did this right and i actually
managed to

526
00:08:26,309 --> 00:08:26,319
managed to
 

527
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,790
managed to
make get the private key make the first

528
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:28,800
make get the private key make the first
 

529
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,390
make get the private key make the first
transaction that would just move all my

530
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:30,400
transaction that would just move all my
 

531
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,070
transaction that would just move all my
ether to the multisig wallet so it's

532
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:32,080
ether to the multisig wallet so it's
 

533
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,630
ether to the multisig wallet so it's
safe

534
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:32,640
safe
 

535
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,190
safe
and then second transact put the private

536
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:35,200
and then second transact put the private
 

537
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,190
and then second transact put the private
key on my main computer then started

538
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:37,200
key on my main computer then started
 

539
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,190

billion dollars but like in reality it's
 

559
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,310

00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:58,480
are you going to crash it by yeah and
 

563
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,230
are you going to crash it by yeah and
after you sell 1 million worth you're

564
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:00,240
after you sell 1 million worth you're
 

565
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,829
after you sell 1 million worth you're
going to crash it after 10 million

566
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:01,839
going to crash it after 10 million
 

567
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,230

suggested this idea that you know you
 

867
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,790
suggested this idea that you know you
would have coins that represent causes

and like people would just like

870
00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:02,079
and like people would just like
 

871
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,069
and like people would just like
buy and accept those coins because they

872
00:14:04,069 --> 00:14:04,079
buy and accept those coins because they
 

873
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,350
buy and accept those coins because they
support those causes

00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:56,480
like perfectly unders uh understands and
 

985
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,910
like perfectly unders uh understands and
can impose their idea of what is the

986
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:57,920
can impose their idea of what is the
 

987
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,629
can impose their idea of what is the
good

988
00:15:58,629 --> 00:15:58,639
good
 

989
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,189
good
right like it's when people talk about

990
00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:01,199
right like it's when people talk about
 

991
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,230
right like it's when people talk about
public goods

992
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:02,240
public goods
 

993
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,550
public goods
it just often comes with this baggage of

994
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:04,560
it just often comes with this baggage of
 

995
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,310
it just often comes with this baggage of
uh you know either centralization or

996
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:06,320
uh you know either centralization or
 

997
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,350
uh you know either centralization or
conformism

998
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:07,360
conformism
 

999
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,189
conformism
and i think like it doesn't have to

1000
00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:09,199
and i think like it doesn't have to
 

1001
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,710
and i think like it doesn't have to
right like uh often

1002
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:10,720
right like uh often
 

1003
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,790
right like uh often
the most important public goods are the

1004
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:12,800
the most important public goods are the
 

1005
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,069
the most important public goods are the
ones that are created by

1006
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:14,079
ones that are created by
 

1007
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,509
ones that are created by
you know the crazy individual that's

1008
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:15,519
you know the crazy individual that's
 

1009
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,509
you know the crazy individual that's
that disagree with everyone else

1010
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:17,519
that disagree with everyone else
 

1011
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,550
that disagree with everyone else
so trying to make this kind of

1012
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:20,560
so trying to make this kind of
 

1013
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,509
so trying to make this kind of
synthesis where you combine the values

1014
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:23,519
synthesis where you combine the values
 

1015
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,269
synthesis where you combine the values
of decentralization and the values of

1016
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:25,279
of decentralization and the values of
 

1017
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,470
of decentralization and the values of
open source

1018
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:26,480
open source
 

1019
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,350
open source
but you're not naive about it and like

1020
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:29,360
but you're not naive about it and like
 

1021
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,470
but you're not naive about it and like
you know you realize

1022
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:30,480
you know you realize
 

1023
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,590
you know you realize
um that for these things to be produced

1024
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:33,600
um that for these things to be produced
 

1025
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,350
um that for these things to be produced
there needs to be a way for it to be

1026
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:35,360
there needs to be a way for it to be
 

1027
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,030
there needs to be a way for it to be
sustainable there needs to be

1028
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,040
sustainable there needs to be
 

1029
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,470
sustainable there needs to be
some way of supporting people who are

1030
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:38,480
some way of supporting people who are
 

1031
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,550
some way of supporting people who are
working these projects but at the same

1032
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:40,560
working these projects but at the same
 

1033
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,990
working these projects but at the same
time you want to

1034
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:42,000
time you want to
 

1035
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,790
time you want to
avoid that turning into a vector of

1036
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:44,800
avoid that turning into a vector of
 

1037
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,749
avoid that turning into a vector of
centralization

1038
00:16:45,749 --> 00:16:45,759
centralization
 

1039
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,430
centralization
like trying to sort of get all of the

1040
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:49,440
like trying to sort of get all of the
 

1041
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,870
like trying to sort of get all of the
good things without the bad things

1042
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:50,880
good things without the bad things
 

1043
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,030
good things without the bad things
to me that's a yeah a big part of

1044
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:55,040
to me that's a yeah a big part of
 

1045
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,629
to me that's a yeah a big part of
sort of what my grand experiment in

1046
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:56,639
sort of what my grand experiment in
 

1047
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,710
sort of what my grand experiment in
crypto is about and and

1048
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:58,720
crypto is about and and
 

1049
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,350
crypto is about and and
like we are doing things in different

1050
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:01,360
like we are doing things in different
 

1051
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,710
like we are doing things in different
kinds of things for this right like

1052
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:02,720
kinds of things for this right like
 

1053
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,430
kinds of things for this right like
there's

1054
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:03,440
there's
 

1055
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,189
there's
the the git coin grants quadratic

1056
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:05,199
the the git coin grants quadratic
 

1057
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,949
the the git coin grants quadratic
funding in the ethereum ecosystem

1058
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:06,959
funding in the ethereum ecosystem
 

1059
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,909
funding in the ethereum ecosystem
um there's i mean obviously these uh dog

1060
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:09,919
um there's i mean obviously these uh dog
 

1061
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,189
um there's i mean obviously these uh dog
coins that just happens

1062
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:11,199
coins that just happens
 

1063
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,309
coins that just happens
like i guess accidentally um there's

1064
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:14,319
like i guess accidentally um there's
 

1065
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,510
like i guess accidentally um there's
other projects

1066
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:15,520
other projects
 

1067
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,829
other projects
um that like for example you know

1068
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:17,839
um that like for example you know
 

1069
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,510
um that like for example you know
uniswap has um

1070
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:19,520
uniswap has um
 

1071
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,669
uniswap has um
their uniswap dao that just has a huge

1072
00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:21,679
their uniswap dao that just has a huge
 

1073
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:22,549
their uniswap dao that just has a huge
amount of funding

1074
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:22,559
amount of funding
 

1075
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,710
amount of funding
and like we haven't seen yet how that's

1076
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:24,720
and like we haven't seen yet how that's
 

1077
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,829
and like we haven't seen yet how that's
going to be deployed but

1078
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:25,839
going to be deployed but
 

1079
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,069
going to be deployed but
you know it could be potentially

1080
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:28,079
you know it could be potentially
 

1081
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,750
you know it could be potentially
deployed to do lots of really good and

1082
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:29,760
deployed to do lots of really good and
 

1083
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,590
deployed to do lots of really good and
amazing things

1084
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:31,600
amazing things
 

1085
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,150
amazing things
do you see ethereum as essentially a

1086
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:34,160
do you see ethereum as essentially a
 

1087
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,990
do you see ethereum as essentially a
mechanism

1088
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:36,000
mechanism
 

1089
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,230
mechanism
to uh fight for social causes

1090
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:40,240
to uh fight for social causes
 

1091
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,110
to uh fight for social causes
um i definitely see ethereum as

1092
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:45,120
um i definitely see ethereum as
 

1093
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,310
um i definitely see ethereum as
being a mechanism to

1094
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:48,320
being a mechanism to
 

1095
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,750
being a mechanism to
fight for definitely some some specific

1096
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:51,760
fight for definitely some some specific
 

1097
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,549
fight for definitely some some specific
things that are

1098
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:52,559
things that are
 

1099
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,150
things that are
um that are social causes um like

1100
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:56,160
um that are social causes um like
 

1101
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,230
um that are social causes um like
just you know the fact of creating an

1102
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:58,240
just you know the fact of creating an
 

1103
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,070
just you know the fact of creating an
open financial system that anyone can

1104
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,080
open financial system that anyone can
 

1105
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,669
open financial system that anyone can
participate in no matter where they are

1106
00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:01,679
participate in no matter where they are
 

1107
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,270
participate in no matter where they are
in the world that's a social cause

1108
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:03,280
in the world that's a social cause
 

1109
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,270
in the world that's a social cause
i'm just you know giving people the

1110
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:05,280
i'm just you know giving people the
 

1111
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,549
i'm just you know giving people the
ability to

1112
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:06,559
ability to
 

1113
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,470
ability to
organize and create projects even if

1114
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:08,480
organize and create projects even if
 

1115
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,909
organize and create projects even if
it's five people in five different

1116
00:18:09,909 --> 00:18:09,919
it's five people in five different
 

1117
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:10,950
it's five people in five different
countries i think

1118
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:10,960
countries i think
 

1119
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,549
countries i think
that kind of inclusiveness i think

1120
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:12,559
that kind of inclusiveness i think
 

1121
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,070
that kind of inclusiveness i think
that's a social cause

1122
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:14,080
that's a social cause
 

1123
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,350
that's a social cause
and it's a core a core crypto value

1124
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:17,360
and it's a core a core crypto value
 

1125
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,470
and it's a core a core crypto value
um but then at the same time like the

1126
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:20,480
um but then at the same time like the
 

1127
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:20,870
um but then at the same time like the
other

1128
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:20,880
other
 

1129
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,110
other
important kind of part of the magic of

1130
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:23,120
important kind of part of the magic of
 

1131
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,630
important kind of part of the magic of
ethereum that you have to balance that

1132
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:24,640
ethereum that you have to balance that
 

1133
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,710
ethereum that you have to balance that
against is that it is also this

1134
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:26,720
against is that it is also this
 

1135
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,110
against is that it is also this
open platform where ultimately you know

1136
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:29,120
open platform where ultimately you know
 

1137
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:29,990
open platform where ultimately you know
the thing that go

1138
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:30,000
the thing that go
 

1139
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,310
the thing that go
the things that are on ethereum is just

1140
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:32,320
the things that are on ethereum is just
 

1141
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,750
the things that are on ethereum is just
the things that the community makes of

1142
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:33,760
the things that the community makes of
 

1143
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,510
the things that the community makes of
it

1144
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:35,520
it
 

1145
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,590
it
well you kind of briefly open the door

1146
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:37,600
well you kind of briefly open the door
 

1147

of the amazing use cases that people
 

1187
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,710
of the amazing use cases that people
have been talking about instead of today

a lot of the great stuff gets priced out
 

1193
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,710
a lot of the great stuff gets priced out
because you know transaction fees are at

people can just easily see
then you know that would be a good

1298
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:08,400
then you know that would be a good
 

1299
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,230
then you know that would be a good
scenario right and we'll just

1300
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:10,240
scenario right and we'll just
 

1301
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,390
scenario right and we'll just
like become incorpor kind of

1302
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:12,400
like become incorpor kind of
 

1303
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,830
like become incorpor kind of
incorporated and accepted the same way

as happened uh with the internet um

1306
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:16,480
as happened uh with the internet um
 

1307
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,870
as happened uh with the internet um
but the work in the worst case scenario

1308
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:18,880
but the work in the worst case scenario
 

1309
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,990
but the work in the worst case scenario
would of course be

1310
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:20,000
would of course be

blockchains from existing but they

1332
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:39,520
blockchains from existing but they
 

1333
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,950
blockchains from existing but they
definitely have the ability to really

marginalize it right
 

1337
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,510

crypto
 

1343
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,310
crypto
and you know you ban all kind of

1344
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:50,320
and you know you ban all kind of
 

1345
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,870

then like you could

1350
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:56,320
then like you could
 

1351
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,950
then like you could
you can successfully like turn it into a

1352
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:00,960
you can successfully like turn it into a
 

1353
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,789
you can successfully like turn it into a
like you know a fairly kind of niche

1354
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:02,799
like you know a fairly kind of niche
 

1355
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,950

counterculture thing that

1356
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:04,960
counterculture thing that
 

1357
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,630
counterculture thing that
has much less impact than otherwise

1358
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:06,640
has much less impact than otherwise
 

1359
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,470
has much less impact than otherwise
would so it's

1360
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:08,480
would so it's
 

1361
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,750
would so it's
somewhere between the good scenario in

1362
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:09,760
somewhere between the good scenario in
 

1363
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,350
somewhere between the good scenario in
the bad scenario i'm obviously hoping

1364
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:11,360
the bad scenario i'm obviously hoping
 

1365
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,230
the bad scenario i'm obviously hoping
for the good

1366
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:12,240
for the good
 

1367
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,909
for the good
well that's interesting also the tension

1368
00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:13,919
well that's interesting also the tension
 

1369
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,909
well that's interesting also the tension
between governments and

1370
00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:15,919
between governments and
 

1371
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,470
between governments and
uh companies like if you have a bunch of

1372
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:18,480
uh companies like if you have a bunch of
 

1373
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,070
uh companies like if you have a bunch of
billionaires or a bunch of companies

1374
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:20,080
billionaires or a bunch of companies
 

1375
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,070
billionaires or a bunch of companies
like tesla investing in bitcoin

1376
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:22,080
like tesla investing in bitcoin
 

1377
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,710
like tesla investing in bitcoin
and then governments resisting that it's

1378
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:24,720
and then governments resisting that it's
 

1379
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,310
and then governments resisting that it's
interesting who wins out in that worst

1380
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:26,320
interesting who wins out in that worst
 

1381
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,590
interesting who wins out in that worst
case scenario

1382
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:27,600
case scenario
 

1383
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,270
case scenario
and almost when companies

1384
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:31,280
and almost when companies

so on even the dot coins uh it's

1394
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:42,080
so on even the dot coins uh it's
 

1395
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,990
so on even the dot coins uh it's
almost sends a signal to everybody else

1396
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:44,000
almost sends a signal to everybody else
 

1397
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,830
almost sends a signal to everybody else
that this is

1398
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:45,840
that this is

this is a revolution that's here to stay
 

1401
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,630
this is a revolution that's here to stay
on this one little tangent that you

1402
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:50,640
on this one little tangent that you
 

1403
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,310
on this one little tangent that you
brought up

1404
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:52,320
brought up
 

1405
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,029
brought up
this is almost an outdated idea but it's

1406
00:22:55,029 --> 00:22:55,039
this is almost an outdated idea but it's
 

1407
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,950
this is almost an outdated idea but it's
still with us which is

1408
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:56,960
still with us which is
 

1409
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,870
still with us which is
cryptocurrencies are used for illegal

1410

activity for drugs for crime
and so on is there some sense

1414
00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:04,799
and so on is there some sense
 

1415
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,070
and so on is there some sense
that worries you that if

1416
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:08,080
that worries you that if
 

1417
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,549
that worries you that if
uh if cryptocurrency if ethereum runs

1418
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:10,559
uh if cryptocurrency if ethereum runs
 

1419
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:11,830
uh if cryptocurrency if ethereum runs
the world

1420
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:11,840
the world
 

1421
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,350
the world
then crime making money from crime will

1422
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:15,360
then crime making money from crime will
 

1423
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,110
then crime making money from crime will
be easier

1424
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:17,120
be easier
 

1425
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,430
be easier
there's always that possibility like at

1426
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:19,440
there's always that possibility like at
 

1427
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,350
there's always that possibility like at
the same time i think if you look at you

1428
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:21,360
the same time i think if you look at you
 

1429
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:21,750
the same time i think if you look at you
know

1430
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:21,760

is needed but
 

1557
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,909
is needed but
at the same time i uh

1558
00:25:21,909 --> 00:25:21,919
at the same time i uh
 

1559
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,350
at the same time i uh
do and think um i guess

1560
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:25,360
do and think um i guess
 

1561
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,630
do and think um i guess
i i definitely like worry more

1562
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:28,640
i i definitely like worry more
 

1563
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,549
i i definitely like worry more
about the messiah the possibility that

uh kind of acting outside of
 

1569
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,710
uh kind of acting outside of
institutions becomes too impossible

1570
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:40,720
institutions becomes too impossible
 

1571
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,830
institutions becomes too impossible
and i don't even necessarily mean

1572
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:41,840
and i don't even necessarily mean
 

1573
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,029
and i don't even necessarily mean
outside of governments even just you

know outside of corporations like
becomes too impossible and there's just

1578
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:45,760
becomes too impossible and there's just
 

1579
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,950
becomes too impossible and there's just
like terrible things that come as a

1580
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:46,960
like terrible things that come as a
 

1581
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,830
like terrible things that come as a
result

1582
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:47,840
result
 

1583
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,590
result
um and if things going in the other

1584
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:49,600
um and if things going in the other
 

1585
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,950
um and if things going in the other
direction like

1586
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:50,960
direction like
 

1587
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,070
direction like
it obviously is a a risk but

1588
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:54,080
it obviously is a a risk but
 

1589
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,070
it obviously is a a risk but
you know at the same time i think in the

1590
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:56,080
you know at the same time i think in the
 

1591
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,390
you know at the same time i think in the
long term like a crypto can

1592
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:58,400
long term like a crypto can
 

1593
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,669
long term like a crypto can
potentially even like offer defenses as

1594
00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:01,679
potentially even like offer defenses as
 

1595
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,110
potentially even like offer defenses as
much as attacks against that sort of

1596
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,120
much as attacks against that sort of
 

1597
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:03,430
much as attacks against that sort of
thing

1598
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:03,440
thing
 

1599
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,830
thing
yeah many throughout history many of the

most destructive things came from
 

1603
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,590
most destructive things came from
centralized institutions versus

00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:09,600
centralized institutions versus
 

1605
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,149
centralized institutions versus
sort of from the people operating in the

1606
00:26:12,149 --> 00:26:12,159
sort of from the people operating in the
 

1607
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:13,029
sort of from the people operating in the
shadows

1608
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:13,039
shadows
 

1609
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,110

00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:31,440
it could actually accelerate the
 

1627
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,870
it could actually accelerate the
adoption of particular things like

1628
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:34,880

00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:41,360
accelerates the policy
 

1635
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,510
accelerates the policy
it forces the policy to catch up to

1636
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:43,520
it forces the policy to catch up to

where the people stand
 

1639
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,789
where the people stand
right so there's a positive way of doing

1640
00:26:46,789 --> 00:26:46,799
right so there's a positive way of doing
 

1641
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,390
right so there's a positive way of doing
things that are in the gray area of

1642
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:48,400
things that are in the gray area of
 

1643
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,350
things that are in the gray area of
legality

1644
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:49,360
legality
 

1645

in a safe way be able to participate in

1650

in a safe way be able to participate in
 

1651
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,549
in a safe way be able to participate in
this gray area

1652
00:26:56,549 --> 00:26:56,559
this gray area
 

1653
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:57,909
this gray area
yeah i mean the other thing to keep in

1654
00:26:57,909 --> 00:26:57,919
yeah i mean the other thing to keep in
 

1655
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,669
yeah i mean the other thing to keep in
mind of course is that the

1656
00:26:59,669 --> 00:26:59,679
mind of course is that the
 

1657
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,750
mind of course is that the
the set of like the kinds of things that

1658
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:01,760
the set of like the kinds of things that
 

1659
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,350
the set of like the kinds of things that
just like payment processors as

00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:03,360
just like payment processors as
 

1661

kids conservative because they're scared
of what what the layer below them will

1678
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:17,279
of what what the layer below them will
 

1679

this like

1704
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:39,440
this like

it and
no no that makes it just hard to

1712
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:46,880
no no that makes it just hard to
 

1713
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,389
no no that makes it just hard to
participate in this stuff so i think

1714
00:27:48,389 --> 00:27:48,399
participate in this stuff so i think
 

1715
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:49,510
participate in this stuff so i think
like reducing the number of

1716
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:49,520
like reducing the number of
 

1717
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,789
like reducing the number of
intermediaries is definitely

1718
00:27:52,789 --> 00:27:52,799
intermediaries is definitely
 

1719
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,269
intermediaries is definitely
normally a good thing all right let's

can you briefly summarize your vision

1740
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:17,520
can you briefly summarize your vision
 

1741
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,070
can you briefly summarize your vision
how ethereum 2.0 will make ethereum more

1742
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:20,080
how ethereum 2.0 will make ethereum more
 

1743
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,029
how ethereum 2.0 will make ethereum more
scalable

1744
00:28:21,029 --> 00:28:21,039
scalable
 

1745
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,230

secure and sustainable sure

1746
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:24,240
secure and sustainable sure
 

1747
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,029
secure and sustainable sure
so i think recently we've actually been

1748
00:28:27,029 --> 00:28:27,039
so i think recently we've actually been
 

1749
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,630
so i think recently we've actually been
kind of de-emphasizing the

1750
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:28,640
kind of de-emphasizing the
 

1751
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,190
kind of de-emphasizing the
eth 2.0 branding i guess so the reason

1752
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:31,200
eth 2.0 branding i guess so the reason
 

1753
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,870
eth 2.0 branding i guess so the reason
behind that was that

1754
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:32,880
behind that was that
 

1755
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,789
behind that was that
originally we envisioned something more

1756
00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:34,799
originally we envisioned something more
 

1757
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,029
originally we envisioned something more
like a big grand event

1758
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:37,039
like a big grand event
 

1759
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,789
like a big grand event
where you know all the good things would

1760
00:28:38,789 --> 00:28:38,799
where you know all the good things would
 

1761
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,070
where you know all the good things would
happen at the same time and it would be

1762
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:40,080
happen at the same time and it would be
 

1763
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,669
happen at the same time and it would be
a new blockchain

1764
00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:41,679
a new blockchain
 

1765
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,190
a new blockchain
and it would be a new protocol and

1766
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:43,200
and it would be a new protocol and
 

1767
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,870
and it would be a new protocol and
people would have to take a lot of

1768
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:44,880
people would have to take a lot of
 

1769
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,389
people would have to take a lot of
effort to migrate over

1770
00:28:46,389 --> 00:28:46,399
effort to migrate over
 

1771
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:49,750
effort to migrate over
but later we've slowly changed the

1772
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:49,760
but later we've slowly changed the
 

1773
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,430
but later we've slowly changed the
roadmap over to something that's much

1774
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:51,440
roadmap over to something that's much
 

1775
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,870
roadmap over to something that's much
more incremental

1776
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:52,880
more incremental
 

1777
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,950
more incremental
right so you know proof of stake happens

1778
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:54,960
right so you know proof of stake happens
 

1779
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,710
right so you know proof of stake happens
kind of over time and then sharding gets

1780
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:56,720
kind of over time and then sharding gets
 

1781
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,149
kind of over time and then sharding gets
added over time and all these features

1782
00:28:58,149 --> 00:28:58,159
added over time and all these features
 

1783
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,350
added over time and all these features
get added over time

1784
00:28:59,350 --> 00:28:59,360
get added over time
 

1785
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,750
get added over time
and so the experience for just a regular

1786
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:01,760
and so the experience for just a regular
 

1787
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,630
and so the experience for just a regular
ethereum user

1788
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:02,640
ethereum user
 

1789
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,630
ethereum user
still feels very seamless right it's

1790
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:04,640
still feels very seamless right it's
 

1791
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,549
still feels very seamless right it's
like maybe a little bit more complex

1792
00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:06,559
like maybe a little bit more complex
 

1793
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,310
like maybe a little bit more complex
than the hard forks that we've already

1794
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:08,320
than the hard forks that we've already
 

1795
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,870
than the hard forks that we've already
done but from a user's point of view but

1796
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:10,880
done but from a user's point of view but
 

1797
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,350
done but from a user's point of view but
like

1798
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:11,360
like
 

1799
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,630
like
not by that much right uh so like

1800
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:14,640
not by that much right uh so like
 

1801
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,510
not by that much right uh so like
the big two things that are happening

1802
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:17,520
the big two things that are happening
 

1803
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,630
the big two things that are happening
right these are

1804
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:18,640
right these are
 

1805
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,070
right these are
what used to be considered the two

1806
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,080
what used to be considered the two
 

1807
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,990
what used to be considered the two
flagship features of use 2.0 and now

1808
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:22,000
flagship features of use 2.0 and now
 

1809
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,789
flagship features of use 2.0 and now
they're just you know

1810
00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:22,799
they're just you know
 

1811
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,110
they're just you know
the flagship features of the you know

1812
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:25,120
the flagship features of the you know
 

1813
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,990
the flagship features of the you know
the next uh

1814
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:26,000
the next uh
 

1815
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,789
the next uh
evolution of ethereum yeah as uh proof

1816
00:29:28,789 --> 00:29:28,799
evolution of ethereum yeah as uh proof
 

1817
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:29,510
evolution of ethereum yeah as uh proof
of stake

1818
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:29,520
of stake
 

1819
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,630
of stake
and sharding right so proof of stake is

1820
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:32,640
and sharding right so proof of stake is
 

1821
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,149
and sharding right so proof of stake is
a consensus algorithm

1822
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:34,159
a consensus algorithm
 

1823
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,789
a consensus algorithm
it's the or it's not just mechanism i

1824
00:29:36,789 --> 00:29:36,799
it's the or it's not just mechanism i
 

1825
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,149
it's the or it's not just mechanism i
should say um it's

1826
00:29:38,149 --> 00:29:38,159
should say um it's
 

1827
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,310
should say um it's
the difference is that like an algorithm

1828
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:40,320
the difference is that like an algorithm
 

1829
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,750
the difference is that like an algorithm
is something that you run by yourself a

1830
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:41,760
is something that you run by yourself a
 

1831
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,470
is something that you run by yourself a
mechanism

1832
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:42,480
mechanism
 

1833
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,950
mechanism
is like it involves interactions between

1834
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:44,960
is like it involves interactions between
 

1835
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,230
is like it involves interactions between
people and it could even include

1836
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:46,240
people and it could even include
 

1837
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,669
people and it could even include
incentives and all of that

1838
00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:47,679
incentives and all of that
 

1839
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,110
incentives and all of that
uh so the consensus mechanism

1840
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:51,120
uh so the consensus mechanism
 

1841
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,310
uh so the consensus mechanism
uh so by which nodes in

1842
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:54,320
uh so by which nodes in
 

1843
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,630
uh so by which nodes in
the network agree on you know which

1844
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:56,640
the network agree on you know which
 

1845
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,310
the network agree on you know which
blocks came in which transactions came

1846
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:58,320
blocks came in which transactions came
 

1847
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,350
blocks came in which transactions came
in in what order

1848
00:29:59,350 --> 00:29:59,360
in in what order
 

1849
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,430
in in what order
uh make sure that once a block gets

1850
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:01,440
uh make sure that once a block gets
 

1851
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,029
uh make sure that once a block gets
accepted it can't get reverted and all

1852
00:30:03,029 --> 00:30:03,039
accepted it can't get reverted and all
 

1853
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:03,909
accepted it can't get reverted and all
of these

1854
00:30:03,909 --> 00:30:03,919
of these
 

1855
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,750
of these
things that we expect from a blockchain

1856
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:05,760
things that we expect from a blockchain
 

1857
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,070
things that we expect from a blockchain
um so existing blockchains you know

1858
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:08,080
um so existing blockchains you know
 

1859
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,830
um so existing blockchains you know
including bitcoin including the ethereum

1860
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:09,840
including bitcoin including the ethereum
 

1861
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,950
including bitcoin including the ethereum
of today and including

1862
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:10,960
of today and including
 

1863
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,389
of today and including
a lot of them they use proof of work

1864
00:30:12,389 --> 00:30:12,399
a lot of them they use proof of work
 

1865
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,710
a lot of them they use proof of work
right uh so

1866
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:14,720
right uh so
 

1867
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,830
right uh so
the reason why we need proof of anything

1868
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:17,840
the reason why we need proof of anything
 

1869
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,510
the reason why we need proof of anything
is be it is because like they serve this

1870
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:21,520
is be it is because like they serve this
 

1871
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,909
is be it is because like they serve this
function that i call kind of economic

1872
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:23,919
function that i call kind of economic
 

1873
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:25,350
function that i call kind of economic
civil resistance

1874
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:25,360
civil resistance
 

1875
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,110
civil resistance
so that's obviously you know a big word

1876
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:27,120
so that's obviously you know a big word
 

1877
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,870
so that's obviously you know a big word
for

1878
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:28,880
for
 

1879
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,070
for
especially if you've never heard of

1880
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:30,080
especially if you've never heard of
 

1881
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,070
especially if you've never heard of
sybil's before but like the basic idea

1882
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:32,080
sybil's before but like the basic idea
 

1883
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,430
sybil's before but like the basic idea
is right that you have a network and you

1884
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:33,440
is right that you have a network and you
 

1885
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,870
is right that you have a network and you
have lots of computers that

1886
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:34,880
have lots of computers that
 

1887
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,950
have lots of computers that
agree on like which block to accept and

1888
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:36,960
agree on like which block to accept and
 

1889
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,549
agree on like which block to accept and
sometimes you get you know two blocks

1890
00:30:38,549 --> 00:30:38,559
sometimes you get you know two blocks
 

1891
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:39,990
sometimes you get you know two blocks
that get published at the same time and

1892
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:40,000
that get published at the same time and
 

1893
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,510
that get published at the same time and
you just have to agree on an order so

1894
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:41,520
you just have to agree on an order so
 

1895
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,750
you just have to agree on an order so
there has to be some kind of voting game

1896
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:43,760
there has to be some kind of voting game
 

1897
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,350
there has to be some kind of voting game
yeah but then the question is well in

1898
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:45,360
yeah but then the question is well in
 

1899
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,269
yeah but then the question is well in
this voting game you know who get who

1900
00:30:47,269 --> 00:30:47,279
this voting game you know who get who
 

1901
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,269
this voting game you know who get who
gets a vote who gets to participate

1902
00:30:49,269 --> 00:30:49,279
gets a vote who gets to participate
 

1903
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,510
gets a vote who gets to participate
now the pro you can't say one person one

1904
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:51,520
now the pro you can't say one person one
 

1905
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,029
now the pro you can't say one person one
vote right the reason why you cannot say

1906
00:30:53,029 --> 00:30:53,039
vote right the reason why you cannot say
 

1907
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,870
vote right the reason why you cannot say
one person one vote is because

1908
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:54,880
one person one vote is because
 

1909
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,950
one person one vote is because
you need some kind of like authority or

1910
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:56,960
you need some kind of like authority or
 

1911
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,630
you need some kind of like authority or
some kind of mechanism to say you know

1912
00:30:58,630 --> 00:30:58,640
some kind of mechanism to say you know
 

1913
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,269
some kind of mechanism to say you know
who the

1914
00:30:59,269 --> 00:30:59,279
who the
 

1915
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,310
who the
the humans are like and if you don't

1916
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:02,320
the humans are like and if you don't
 

1917
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,190
the humans are like and if you don't
have that then

1918
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:03,200
have that then
 

1919
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,789
have that then
a bad guy could just come in with a

1920
00:31:04,789 --> 00:31:04,799
a bad guy could just come in with a
 

1921
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,789
a bad guy could just come in with a
virtual machine or with a computer that

1922
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:06,799
virtual machine or with a computer that
 

1923
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:07,110
virtual machine or with a computer that
has

1924
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:07,120
has
 

1925
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,950
has
on it 10 billion virtual machines that

1926
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:08,960
on it 10 billion virtual machines that
 

1927
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,110
on it 10 billion virtual machines that
have 10 billion you know virtual nodes

1928
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:11,120
have 10 billion you know virtual nodes
 

1929
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,269
have 10 billion you know virtual nodes
and then just like say look i'm 99 of

1930
00:31:13,269 --> 00:31:13,279
and then just like say look i'm 99 of
 

1931
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,269
and then just like say look i'm 99 of
the network i should control everything

1932
00:31:15,269 --> 00:31:15,279
the network i should control everything
 

1933
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:18,710
the network i should control everything
uh so to prevent this what proof of work

1934
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:18,720
uh so to prevent this what proof of work
 

1935
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,070
uh so to prevent this what proof of work
and proof of stake both do

1936
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:20,080
and proof of stake both do
 

1937
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,630
and proof of stake both do
is they basically say well the weight of

1938
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:22,640
is they basically say well the weight of
 

1939
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,149
is they basically say well the weight of
your vote like how much influence

1940
00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:24,159
your vote like how much influence
 

1941
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,430
your vote like how much influence
your votes have in the consensus

1942
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:27,440
your votes have in the consensus
 

1943
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,909
your votes have in the consensus
is proportional to like what quantity of

1944
00:31:29,909 --> 00:31:29,919
is proportional to like what quantity of
 

1945
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,669
is proportional to like what quantity of
economic resources you bring in

1946
00:31:31,669 --> 00:31:31,679
economic resources you bring in
 

1947
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,509
economic resources you bring in
so in the case of proof of work you

1948
00:31:33,509 --> 00:31:33,519
so in the case of proof of work you
 

1949
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,190
so in the case of proof of work you
prove what economic resources you have

1950
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:35,200
prove what economic resources you have
 

1951
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,710
prove what economic resources you have
because your economic resources are

1952
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:36,720
because your economic resources are
 

1953
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,430
because your economic resources are
computers

1954
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:37,440
computers
 

1955
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,950
computers
and you prove that you have them by just

1956
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:38,960
and you prove that you have them by just
 

1957
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,789
and you prove that you have them by just
running them 24 7 using

1958
00:31:40,789 --> 00:31:40,799
running them 24 7 using
 

1959
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,909
running them 24 7 using
these hash algorithms right so this does

1960
00:31:43,909 --> 00:31:43,919
these hash algorithms right so this does
 

1961
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,750
these hash algorithms right so this does
solve the problem right because in order

1962
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:45,760
solve the problem right because in order
 

1963
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:45,990
solve the problem right because in order
to

1964
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:46,000
to
 

1965
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,029
to
attack the network you have to come in

1966
00:31:49,029 --> 00:31:49,039
attack the network you have to come in
 

1967
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,230
attack the network you have to come in
with more computers

1968
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:50,240
with more computers
 

1969
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,149
with more computers
and more money invested into computers

1970
00:31:52,149 --> 00:31:52,159
and more money invested into computers
 

1971
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:53,430
and more money invested into computers
and electricity

1972
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:53,440
and electricity
 

1973
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,110
and electricity
than the rest of the network puts

1974
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:55,120
than the rest of the network puts
 

1975
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,430
than the rest of the network puts
together and that's extremely expensive

1976
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:57,440
together and that's extremely expensive
 

1977
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,149
together and that's extremely expensive
in proof-of-stake instead of relying on

1978
00:32:00,149 --> 00:32:00,159
in proof-of-stake instead of relying on
 

1979
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:01,669
in proof-of-stake instead of relying on
people with computers that are

1980
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:01,679
people with computers that are
 

1981
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,630
people with computers that are
just constantly cranking out hashes 24 7

1982
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:04,640
just constantly cranking out hashes 24 7
 

1983
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,830
just constantly cranking out hashes 24 7
you

1984
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:05,840
you
 

1985
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,230
you
as you're like a unit of economic

1986
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:08,240
as you're like a unit of economic
 

1987
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,509
as you're like a unit of economic
resources you just use

1988
00:32:09,509 --> 00:32:09,519
resources you just use
 

1989
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,509
resources you just use
like holdings of coins inside the system

1990
00:32:11,509 --> 00:32:11,519
like holdings of coins inside the system
 

1991
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:12,950
like holdings of coins inside the system
right so all of these blockchains they

1992
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:12,960
right so all of these blockchains they
 

1993
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,470
right so all of these blockchains they
have some kind of coin in them

1994
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:14,480
have some kind of coin in them
 

1995
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,950
have some kind of coin in them
bitcoin has bitcoin ethereum has ether

1996
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:16,960
bitcoin has bitcoin ethereum has ether
 

1997
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,310
bitcoin has bitcoin ethereum has ether
um you know they all have a coin

1998
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:18,320
um you know they all have a coin
 

1999
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,669
um you know they all have a coin
so why not just use that as the economic

2000
00:32:21,669 --> 00:32:21,679
so why not just use that as the economic
 

2001
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:23,590
so why not just use that as the economic
the economic resource that you're using

2002
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:23,600
the economic resource that you're using
 

2003
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,509
the economic resource that you're using
to like measure participation

2004
00:32:25,509 --> 00:32:25,519
to like measure participation
 

2005
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:28,710
to like measure participation
um so that's like the quarry

2006
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:28,720
um so that's like the quarry
 

2007
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,389
um so that's like the quarry
distinction between proof of work and

2008
00:32:30,389 --> 00:32:30,399
distinction between proof of work and
 

2009
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:31,909
distinction between proof of work and
proof of stake um

2010
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:31,919
proof of stake um
 

2011
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,669
proof of stake um
i like proof of stake and i've liked

2012
00:32:33,669 --> 00:32:33,679
i like proof of stake and i've liked
 

2013
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,509
i like proof of stake and i've liked
proof of stake for many years

2014
00:32:35,509 --> 00:32:35,519
proof of stake for many years
 

2015
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,389
proof of stake for many years
basically because like it just requires

2016
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:38,399
basically because like it just requires
 

2017
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:38,789
basically because like it just requires
much

2018
00:32:38,789 --> 00:32:38,799
much
 

2019
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:41,269
much
less ongoing resource consumption right

2020
00:32:41,269 --> 00:32:41,279
less ongoing resource consumption right
 

2021
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,470
less ongoing resource consumption right
like with proof-of-work

2022
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:42,480
like with proof-of-work
 

2023
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,909
like with proof-of-work
um you know you have to like actually go

2024
00:32:43,909 --> 00:32:43,919
um you know you have to like actually go
 

2025
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,750
um you know you have to like actually go
and buy these physical computers

2026
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:45,760
and buy these physical computers
 

2027
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,070
and buy these physical computers
and these days um you know yeah they

2028
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:48,080
and these days um you know yeah they
 

2029
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,909
and these days um you know yeah they
have specialized hardware asics um

2030
00:32:49,909 --> 00:32:49,919
have specialized hardware asics um
 

2031
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,990
have specialized hardware asics um
application specific integrated circuits

2032
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:52,000
application specific integrated circuits
 

2033
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,509
application specific integrated circuits
you have to go produce them you have to

2034
00:32:53,509 --> 00:32:53,519
you have to go produce them you have to
 

2035
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:55,909
you have to go produce them you have to
go buy them and unless you have millions

2036
00:32:55,909 --> 00:32:55,919
go buy them and unless you have millions
 

2037
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:57,509
go buy them and unless you have millions
of dollars you know you have to buy them

2038
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:57,519
of dollars you know you have to buy them
 

2039
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,710
of dollars you know you have to buy them
from one of these other people who

2040
00:32:58,710 --> 00:32:58,720
from one of these other people who
 

2041
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,590
from one of these other people who
creates them

2042
00:32:59,590 --> 00:32:59,600
creates them
 

2043
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,350
creates them
and those other people often end up

2044
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:01,360
and those other people often end up
 

2045
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,789
and those other people often end up
taking a huge cut of the profits

2046
00:33:02,789 --> 00:33:02,799
taking a huge cut of the profits
 

2047
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:03,750
taking a huge cut of the profits
themselves

2048
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:03,760
themselves
 

2049
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,549
themselves
uh and then you know you have to plug

2050
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:06,559
uh and then you know you have to plug
 

2051
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,389
uh and then you know you have to plug
them in you have to just

2052
00:33:08,389 --> 00:33:08,399
them in you have to just
 

2053
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,389
them in you have to just
burn all of this electricity that's just

2054
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:10,399
burn all of this electricity that's just
 

2055
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,470
burn all of this electricity that's just
um running 24 7. so

2056
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:12,480
um running 24 7. so
 

2057
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,149
um running 24 7. so
it consumes a huge amount of energy

2058
00:33:14,149 --> 00:33:14,159
it consumes a huge amount of energy
 

2059
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,149
it consumes a huge amount of energy
right and it gets not just energy it

2060
00:33:16,149 --> 00:33:16,159
right and it gets not just energy it
 

2061
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:16,870
right and it gets not just energy it
also

2062
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:16,880
also
 

2063
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,870
also
you know just to create the hardware

2064
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:18,880
you know just to create the hardware
 

2065
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,630
you know just to create the hardware
right like people focus a lot on energy

2066
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:20,640
right like people focus a lot on energy
 

2067
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,830
right like people focus a lot on energy
but like actually

2068
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:21,840
but like actually
 

2069
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,590
but like actually
about half the cost of proof of work

2070
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:23,600
about half the cost of proof of work
 

2071
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,190
about half the cost of proof of work
mining is the cost of the hardware

2072
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:25,200
mining is the cost of the hardware
 

2073
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,389
mining is the cost of the hardware
um so hardware is a very big deal too um

2074
00:33:28,389 --> 00:33:28,399
um so hardware is a very big deal too um
 

2075
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:29,350
um so hardware is a very big deal too um
and you know you need

2076
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:29,360
and you know you need
 

2077
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,430
and you know you need
this like these this really big and

2078
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:31,440
this like these this really big and
 

2079
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,269
this like these this really big and
powerful with very specialized hardware

2080
00:33:33,269 --> 00:33:33,279
powerful with very specialized hardware
 

2081
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:34,630
powerful with very specialized hardware
another kind that fills up these big

2082
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:34,640
another kind that fills up these big
 

2083
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,669
another kind that fills up these big
warehouses

2084
00:33:35,669 --> 00:33:35,679
warehouses
 

2085
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:37,590
warehouses
so proof of stake you don't you don't

2086
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:37,600
so proof of stake you don't you don't
 

2087
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,190
so proof of stake you don't you don't
really need that much electricity you

2088
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:39,200
really need that much electricity you
 

2089
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,190
really need that much electricity you
just need just a little bit to run right

2090
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:41,200
just need just a little bit to run right
 

2091
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,710
just need just a little bit to run right
to run a regular computer

2092
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:42,720
to run a regular computer
 

2093
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,870
to run a regular computer
um you can run proof-of-stake validators

2094
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:44,880
um you can run proof-of-stake validators
 

2095
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,870
um you can run proof-of-stake validators
on computers that you already have

2096
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:46,880
on computers that you already have
 

2097
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,070
on computers that you already have
um so it's just much

2098
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:50,080
um so it's just much
 

2099
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,870
um so it's just much
less resource intensive and like this is

2100
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:52,880
less resource intensive and like this is
 

2101
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,789
less resource intensive and like this is
good for a few reasons right like one is

2102
00:33:54,789 --> 00:33:54,799
good for a few reasons right like one is
 

2103
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,230
good for a few reasons right like one is
you know the kind of environmental

2104
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:56,240
you know the kind of environmental
 

2105
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,190
you know the kind of environmental
rationale that

2106
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:57,200
rationale that
 

2107
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,310
rationale that
you know you're not breaking the

2108
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:58,320
you know you're not breaking the
 

2109
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,389
you know you're not breaking the
environment um the second

2110
00:34:00,389 --> 00:34:00,399
environment um the second
 

2111
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:02,789
environment um the second
is that you're not taking away

2112
00:34:02,789 --> 00:34:02,799
is that you're not taking away
 

2113
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:03,990
is that you're not taking away
electricity

2114
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:04,000
electricity
 

2115
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,509
electricity
and like other resources from other

2116
00:34:05,509 --> 00:34:05,519
and like other resources from other
 

2117
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,909
and like other resources from other
people i mean like right now there's

2118
00:34:07,909 --> 00:34:07,919
people i mean like right now there's
 

2119
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:09,909
people i mean like right now there's
i think just today i saw a story about

2120
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:09,919
i think just today i saw a story about
 

2121
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:11,909
i think just today i saw a story about
like iran wanting to shut down some

2122
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:11,919
like iran wanting to shut down some
 

2123
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:13,270
like iran wanting to shut down some
bitcoin mining because

2124
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:13,280
bitcoin mining because
 

2125
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,550
bitcoin mining because
it was just grabbing up so much

2126
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:14,560
it was just grabbing up so much
 

2127
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,990
it was just grabbing up so much
electricity that it was you know

2128
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:16,000
electricity that it was you know
 

2129
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,669
electricity that it was you know
outbidding the nearby towns and they

2130
00:34:17,669 --> 00:34:17,679
outbidding the nearby towns and they
 

2131
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,069
outbidding the nearby towns and they
just

2132
00:34:18,069 --> 00:34:18,079
just
 

2133
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,430
just
didn't have enough um and then there was

2134
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:21,440
didn't have enough um and then there was
 

2135
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,109
didn't have enough um and then there was
like chia that was the one that's doing

2136
00:34:23,109 --> 00:34:23,119
like chia that was the one that's doing
 

2137
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,270
like chia that was the one that's doing
proof of like hard disk mining basically

2138
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:25,280
proof of like hard disk mining basically
 

2139
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,790
proof of like hard disk mining basically
it's just like grabbing up so many hard

2140
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:26,800
it's just like grabbing up so many hard
 

2141
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,190
it's just like grabbing up so many hard
disks

2142
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:27,200
disks
 

2143
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,109
disks
there's a there's a shortage right so

2144
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:29,119
there's a there's a shortage right so
 

2145
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:30,790
there's a there's a shortage right so
that's the second reason and then

2146
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:30,800
that's the second reason and then
 

2147
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,629
that's the second reason and then
the third more selfish reason is that

2148
00:34:32,629 --> 00:34:32,639
the third more selfish reason is that
 

2149
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,790
the third more selfish reason is that
because participating in consensus

2150
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:34,800
because participating in consensus
 

2151
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,950
because participating in consensus
does not require so much energy

2152
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:36,960
does not require so much energy
 

2153
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,030
does not require so much energy
expenditure you don't need to pay people

2154
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:39,040
expenditure you don't need to pay people
 

2155
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,230
expenditure you don't need to pay people
as much to participate

2156
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:40,240
as much to participate
 

2157
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,389
as much to participate
right so like bitcoin and ethereum they

2158
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:42,399
right so like bitcoin and ethereum they
 

2159
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:43,750
right so like bitcoin and ethereum they
both issue

2160
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:43,760
both issue
 

2161
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,669
both issue
somewhere around four percent of the

2162
00:34:45,669 --> 00:34:45,679
somewhere around four percent of the
 

2163
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,510
somewhere around four percent of the
total supply every year right now

2164
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:47,520
total supply every year right now
 

2165
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,069
total supply every year right now
to miners so ethereum is about 4.7

2166
00:34:50,069 --> 00:34:50,079
to miners so ethereum is about 4.7
 

2167
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:50,869
to miners so ethereum is about 4.7
million ether

2168
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:50,879
million ether
 

2169
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,790
million ether
and the current supply is about 115

2170
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:52,800
and the current supply is about 115
 

2171
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,950
and the current supply is about 115
million but with proof of stake like we

2172
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:54,960
million but with proof of stake like we
 

2173
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,869
million but with proof of stake like we
expect it'll be somewhere between

2174
00:34:56,869 --> 00:34:56,879
expect it'll be somewhere between
 

2175
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:59,990
expect it'll be somewhere between
500 000 and one and one million per year

2176
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:00,000
500 000 and one and one million per year
 

2177
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,030
500 000 and one and one million per year
um so so that means you know this

2178
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:03,040
um so so that means you know this
 

2179
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,349
um so so that means you know this
the supply doesn't have to you know

2180
00:35:05,349 --> 00:35:05,359
the supply doesn't have to you know
 

2181
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:06,630
the supply doesn't have to you know
increase so quickly

2182
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:06,640
increase so quickly
 

2183
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,230
increase so quickly
um so one of the pros that uh

2184
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:10,240
um so one of the pros that uh
 

2185
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,230
um so one of the pros that uh
that people sort of argue for the proof

2186
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:12,240
that people sort of argue for the proof
 

2187
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,950
that people sort of argue for the proof
of work is that uh it is secure because

2188
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:14,960
of work is that uh it is secure because
 

2189
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,069
of work is that uh it is secure because
it's much more difficult

2190
00:35:16,069 --> 00:35:16,079
it's much more difficult
 

2191
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,710
it's much more difficult
to sort of as you've highlighted is

2192
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:18,720
to sort of as you've highlighted is
 

2193
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,829
to sort of as you've highlighted is
difficult to participate

2194
00:35:19,829 --> 00:35:19,839
difficult to participate
 

2195
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:23,430
difficult to participate
is there um is what are your thoughts

2196
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:23,440
is there um is what are your thoughts
 

2197
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,109
is there um is what are your thoughts
about the security

2198
00:35:25,109 --> 00:35:25,119
about the security
 

2199
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,630
about the security
of the proof-of-stake mechanism

2200
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:28,640
of the proof-of-stake mechanism
 

2201
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,870
of the proof-of-stake mechanism
is is there ways to make it secure so i

2202
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:30,880
is is there ways to make it secure so i
 

2203
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,550
is is there ways to make it secure so i
think proof of stake is very secure uh

2204
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:32,560
think proof of stake is very secure uh
 

2205
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,510
think proof of stake is very secure uh
because

2206
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:33,520
because
 

2207
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,390
because
in order to be able to attack the system

2208
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:36,400
in order to be able to attack the system
 

2209
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,829
in order to be able to attack the system
you need to have like

2210
00:35:37,829 --> 00:35:37,839
you need to have like
 

2211
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,910
you need to have like
basically as much stake as the rest of

2212
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:39,920
basically as much stake as the rest of
 

2213
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,109
basically as much stake as the rest of
the network right

2214
00:35:41,109 --> 00:35:41,119
the network right
 

2215
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,030
the network right
so that means like right now for example

2216
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:43,040
so that means like right now for example
 

2217
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,870
so that means like right now for example
we have five million each staking so you

2218
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:44,880
we have five million each staking so you
 

2219
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,150
we have five million each staking so you
have to come up with five million each

2220
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:46,160
have to come up with five million each
 

2221
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,589
have to come up with five million each
and then join the network

2222
00:35:47,589 --> 00:35:47,599
and then join the network
 

2223
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,950
and then join the network
and then the the other so five million

2224
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:50,960
and then the the other so five million
 

2225
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,870
and then the the other so five million
ethers a lot right it's like um

2226
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:52,880
ethers a lot right it's like um
 

2227
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,550
ethers a lot right it's like um
how much is it now like 15 billion

2228
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:54,560
how much is it now like 15 billion
 

2229
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,550
how much is it now like 15 billion
dollars so that's actually more than

2230
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:56,560
dollars so that's actually more than
 

2231
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,190
dollars so that's actually more than
i i believe the cost of attacking the

2232
00:35:59,190 --> 00:35:59,200
i i believe the cost of attacking the
 

2233
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,390
i i believe the cost of attacking the
bitcoin network

2234
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:00,400
bitcoin network
 

2235
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,310
bitcoin network
and then the second thing is that

2236
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:02,320
and then the second thing is that
 

2237
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,310
and then the second thing is that
recovering from attacks is much easier

2238
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:04,320
recovering from attacks is much easier
 

2239
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,670
recovering from attacks is much easier
in proof-of-stake than proof-of-work

2240
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:05,680
in proof-of-stake than proof-of-work
 

2241
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,550
in proof-of-stake than proof-of-work
right because

2242
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:06,560
right because
 

2243
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,710
right because
in proof-of-stake you have like first of

2244
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:08,720
in proof-of-stake you have like first of
 

2245
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,550
in proof-of-stake you have like first of
all we have for many kinds of attacks

2246
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:10,560
all we have for many kinds of attacks
 

2247
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,990
all we have for many kinds of attacks
that you do against this network

2248
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:12,000
that you do against this network
 

2249
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,670
that you do against this network
we have this concept of like automatic

2250
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:13,680
we have this concept of like automatic
 

2251
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,510
we have this concept of like automatic
slashing right which basically means

2252
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:15,520
slashing right which basically means
 

2253
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:15,990
slashing right which basically means
that

2254
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:16,000
that
 

2255
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,950
that
in order to like revert a finalized

2256
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:18,960
in order to like revert a finalized
 

2257
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,470
in order to like revert a finalized
block so if there's one block that's

2258
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:20,480
block so if there's one block that's
 

2259
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:20,790
block so if there's one block that's
like

2260
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:20,800
like
 

2261
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,030
like
accepted by the network and you try to

2262
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:23,040
accepted by the network and you try to
 

2263
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,390
accepted by the network and you try to
convince the network to

2264
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:24,400
convince the network to
 

2265
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,829
convince the network to
kind of revert that block and accept a

2266
00:36:25,829 --> 00:36:25,839
kind of revert that block and accept a
 

2267
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:27,670
kind of revert that block and accept a
different block in order to make that

2268
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:27,680
different block in order to make that
 

2269
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,790
different block in order to make that
kind of attack

2270
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:28,800
kind of attack
 

2271
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,109
kind of attack
you basically have to have your

2272
00:36:31,109 --> 00:36:31,119
you basically have to have your
 

2273
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:31,829
you basically have to have your
validator

2274
00:36:31,829 --> 00:36:31,839
validator
 

2275
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,589
validator
like a big portion of your validators

2276
00:36:33,589 --> 00:36:33,599
like a big portion of your validators
 

2277
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,829
like a big portion of your validators
signed to conflicting messages

2278
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:35,839
signed to conflicting messages
 

2279
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,589
signed to conflicting messages
and this is something that like once

2280
00:36:37,589 --> 00:36:37,599
and this is something that like once
 

2281
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,109
and this is something that like once
these messages are on the network you

2282
00:36:39,109 --> 00:36:39,119
these messages are on the network you
 

2283
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:39,990
these messages are on the network you
can go and prove like

2284
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:40,000
can go and prove like
 

2285
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,990
can go and prove like
look these people did it and so we have

2286
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:42,000
look these people did it and so we have
 

2287
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,109
look these people did it and so we have
this feature in the protocol

2288
00:36:43,109 --> 00:36:43,119
this feature in the protocol
 

2289
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,109
this feature in the protocol
called slashing where you basically take

2290
00:36:45,109 --> 00:36:45,119
called slashing where you basically take
 

2291
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,030
called slashing where you basically take
all these people who provably misbehaved

2292
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:47,040
all these people who provably misbehaved
 

2293
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,150
all these people who provably misbehaved
and you burn their coins

2294
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:48,160
and you burn their coins
 

2295
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,910
and you burn their coins
right and you don't burn anyone else's

2296
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:49,920
right and you don't burn anyone else's
 

2297
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,630
right and you don't burn anyone else's
coins now there are other cases like for

2298
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:52,640
coins now there are other cases like for
 

2299
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,589
coins now there are other cases like for
example

2300
00:36:53,589 --> 00:36:53,599
example
 

2301
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,510
example
if instead of reverting blocks the

2302
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:55,520
if instead of reverting blocks the
 

2303
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,349
if instead of reverting blocks the
attack just tries to censor everyone

2304
00:36:57,349 --> 00:36:57,359
attack just tries to censor everyone
 

2305
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:59,910
attack just tries to censor everyone
right then what you do everyone who got

2306
00:36:59,910 --> 00:36:59,920
right then what you do everyone who got
 

2307
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,349
right then what you do everyone who got
censored would just like basically

2308
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:01,359
censored would just like basically
 

2309
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:02,870
censored would just like basically
create the minority chain

2310
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:02,880
create the minority chain
 

2311
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,870
create the minority chain
um and then the community would

2312
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:04,880
um and then the community would
 

2313
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,310
um and then the community would
basically have to do a soft fork right

2314
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:06,320
basically have to do a soft fork right
 

2315
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,589
basically have to do a soft fork right
they would just have to say like look

2316
00:37:07,589 --> 00:37:07,599
they would just have to say like look
 

2317
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:07,990
they would just have to say like look
this chain

2318
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:08,000
this chain
 

2319
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,430
this chain
is clearly attacking us this chain is

2320
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:09,440
is clearly attacking us this chain is
 

2321
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,109
is clearly attacking us this chain is
the one not attacking us and so we're

2322
00:37:11,109 --> 00:37:11,119
the one not attacking us and so we're
 

2323
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:12,310
the one not attacking us and so we're
going to join this chain

2324
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:12,320
going to join this chain
 

2325
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,230
going to join this chain
and then what happens is that on that

2326
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:14,240
and then what happens is that on that
 

2327
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,390
and then what happens is that on that
new chain the attackers also lose a lot

2328
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:16,400
new chain the attackers also lose a lot
 

2329
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,109
new chain the attackers also lose a lot
of coins

2330
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:17,119
of coins
 

2331
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,030
of coins
right yeah so the difference between

2332
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:19,040
right yeah so the difference between
 

2333
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,630
right yeah so the difference between
proof of stake and proof of work

2334
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:20,640
proof of stake and proof of work
 

2335
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,310
proof of stake and proof of work
is that in a proof-of-stake system like

2336
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:22,320
is that in a proof-of-stake system like
 

2337
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,550
is that in a proof-of-stake system like
you can identify specific participants

2338
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:24,560
you can identify specific participants
 

2339
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,750
you can identify specific participants
and you can say you know

2340
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:25,760
and you can say you know
 

2341
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,829
and you can say you know
these and like this isn't like you know

2342
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:27,839
these and like this isn't like you know
 

2343
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:29,430
these and like this isn't like you know
a human going in and saying i don't like

2344
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:29,440
a human going in and saying i don't like
 

2345
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,470
a human going in and saying i don't like
you i don't like you i don't like you

2346
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:30,480
you i don't like you i don't like you
 

2347
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,150
you i don't like you i don't like you
this is like automated right

2348
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:32,160
this is like automated right
 

2349
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,750
this is like automated right
you can so the slashing process is

2350
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:33,760
you can so the slashing process is
 

2351
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,510
you can so the slashing process is
automated yes

2352
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:35,520
automated yes
 

2353
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,670
automated yes
is there ways it can go wrong so that's

2354
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:37,680
is there ways it can go wrong so that's
 

2355
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,349
is there ways it can go wrong so that's
a painful process where the coins are

2356
00:37:39,349 --> 00:37:39,359
a painful process where the coins are
 

2357
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:40,710
a painful process where the coins are
burned

2358
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:40,720
burned
 

2359
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,910
burned
um it is painful yes i think uh

2360
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:43,920
um it is painful yes i think uh
 

2361
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,069
um it is painful yes i think uh
i mean the one big unknown of course is

2362
00:37:46,069 --> 00:37:46,079
i mean the one big unknown of course is
 

2363
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,030
i mean the one big unknown of course is
like if

2364
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:47,040
like if
 

2365
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,109
like if
an attack actually happens and like if

2366
00:37:49,109 --> 00:37:49,119
an attack actually happens and like if
 

2367
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,790
an attack actually happens and like if
an attack happens that requires the

2368
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:50,800
an attack happens that requires the
 

2369
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,310
an attack happens that requires the
community to actually choose one of

2370
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:52,320
community to actually choose one of
 

2371
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,829
community to actually choose one of
these minority forks

2372
00:37:53,829 --> 00:37:53,839
these minority forks
 

2373
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:57,109
these minority forks
then like what would the the community

2374
00:37:57,109 --> 00:37:57,119
then like what would the the community
 

2375
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,870
then like what would the the community
actually successfully coordinating on

2376
00:37:58,870 --> 00:37:58,880
actually successfully coordinating on
 

2377
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,310
actually successfully coordinating on
this look like right like

2378
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:00,320
this look like right like
 

2379
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,109
this look like right like
it's like you know we can talk about it

2380
00:38:03,109 --> 00:38:03,119
it's like you know we can talk about it
 

2381
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:04,630
it's like you know we can talk about it
and we can you know write

2382
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:04,640
and we can you know write
 

2383
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,390
and we can you know write
like science fiction novels about it but

2384
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:06,400
like science fiction novels about it but
 

2385
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,990
like science fiction novels about it but
like until it's happened you don't

2386
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:08,000
like until it's happened you don't
 

2387
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,430
like until it's happened you don't
really know the details of like what it

2388
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:09,440
really know the details of like what it
 

2389
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,870
really know the details of like what it
looks like and how difficult it is

2390
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:10,880
looks like and how difficult it is
 

2391
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,310
looks like and how difficult it is
what are the channels of communication

2392
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:12,320
what are the channels of communication
 

2393
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,230
what are the channels of communication
for the community if you can

everything

everything
right but i think like the thing to

right but i think like the thing to
 

2457
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,510
right but i think like the thing to
emphasize around like

2458
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:17,520
emphasize around like
 

2459
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,349
emphasize around like
can you actually come to consensus on

00:39:19,349 --> 00:39:19,359
can you actually come to consensus on
 

2461
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:20,630
can you actually come to consensus on
you know whether or not to

you know whether or not to
 

2463
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,230
you know whether or not to
fork the chain because the attacker is

censoring some everyone just for example

2466
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:24,240
censoring some everyone just for example
 

2467
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,430
censoring some everyone just for example
is like

2468
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:25,440
is like
 

2469
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,990
is like
you everyone who's running a node is

2470
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:28,000
you everyone who's running a node is
 

2471
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,950
you everyone who's running a node is
going to see

2472
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:28,960
going to see
 

2473
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,790
going to see
almost the same thing right like they're

2474
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:30,800
almost the same thing right like they're
 

2475
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,390
almost the same thing right like they're
going to be off by a few seconds and

2476
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:32,400
going to be off by a few seconds and
 

2477
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,990
going to be off by a few seconds and
like maybe they'll be off by a few

2478
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:34,000
like maybe they'll be off by a few
 

2479
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,430
like maybe they'll be off by a few
they'll disagree by a few minutes but

2480
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:35,440
they'll disagree by a few minutes but
 

2481
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,589
they'll disagree by a few minutes but
like if it's a serious attack you know

2482
00:39:37,589 --> 00:39:37,599
like if it's a serious attack you know
 

2483
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,109
like if it's a serious attack you know
people are gonna know right it's not

2484
00:39:39,109 --> 00:39:39,119
people are gonna know right it's not
 

2485
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,790
people are gonna know right it's not
like one of those things where you know

2486
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:40,800
like one of those things where you know
 

2487
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,109
like one of those things where you know
oh

2488

oh
 

2489
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:43,349
oh
it we're trying to agree on like i don't

2490
00:39:43,349 --> 00:39:43,359
it we're trying to agree on like i don't
 

2491
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,510
it we're trying to agree on like i don't
know did epstein kill himself or like

2492
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:45,520
know did epstein kill himself or like
 

2493
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,710
know did epstein kill himself or like
some you know

2494
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:46,720
some you know
 

2495
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,390
some you know
read the political facts for like in

00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:48,400
read the political facts for like in
 

2497
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,910
read the political facts for like in
reality no one knows a single thing

2498
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:49,920
reality no one knows a single thing
 

2499
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,349
reality no one knows a single thing
about what's actually going on and

2500
00:39:51,349 --> 00:39:51,359
about what's actually going on and
 

2501
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:52,470
about what's actually going on and
they're all speculating

2502
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:52,480
they're all speculating
 

2503
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,870
they're all speculating
like it is much more visible right so we

2504
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:54,880
like it is much more visible right so we
 

2505
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,750
like it is much more visible right so we
do have that

2506
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:55,760
do have that
 

2507
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,510
do have that
but you know at the same time i'm happy

2508
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:57,520
but you know at the same time i'm happy
 

2509
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,190
but you know at the same time i'm happy
to admit that like

2510
00:39:59,190 --> 00:39:59,200
to admit that like
 

2511
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,230
to admit that like
these are fairly untested mechanisms but

2512
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:02,240
these are fairly untested mechanisms but
 

2513
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,589
these are fairly untested mechanisms but
like at the same time they're also

2514
00:40:03,589 --> 00:40:03,599
like at the same time they're also
 

2515
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,190
like at the same time they're also
untested mechanisms and proof of work

2516
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:05,200
untested mechanisms and proof of work
 

2517
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:05,670
untested mechanisms and proof of work
right

2518
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:05,680
right
 

2519
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,030
right
and like in proof of work it's even

2520
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:07,040
and like in proof of work it's even
 

2521
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,870
and like in proof of work it's even
harder because in proof of work you

2522
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:08,880
harder because in proof of work you
 

2523
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,710
harder because in proof of work you
don't have the ability to like identify

2524
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:10,720
don't have the ability to like identify
 

2525
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,430
don't have the ability to like identify
and say

2526
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:11,440
and say
 

2527
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,829
and say
like you know i'm going to these miners

2528
00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:13,839
like you know i'm going to these miners
 

2529
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:15,270
like you know i'm going to these miners
attacked and so we're not going to let

2530
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:15,280
attacked and so we're not going to let
 

2531
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,309
attacked and so we're not going to let
these my um

2532
00:40:16,309 --> 00:40:16,319
these my um
 

2533
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:17,910
these my um
these miners in these miners do not

2534
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:17,920
these miners in these miners do not
 

2535
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,069
these miners in these miners do not
attack so we're going to keep them in

2536
00:40:20,069 --> 00:40:20,079
attack so we're going to keep them in
 

2537
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:21,430
attack so we're going to keep them in
like you have to pretty much you know

2538
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:21,440
like you have to pretty much you know
 

2539
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,150
like you have to pretty much you know
either take out none of the miners or

2540
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:24,160
either take out none of the miners or
 

2541
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,670
either take out none of the miners or
you do a fork that changes the proof of

2542
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:25,680
you do a fork that changes the proof of
 

2543
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,109
you do a fork that changes the proof of
work algorithm which takes out all of

2544
00:40:27,109 --> 00:40:27,119
work algorithm which takes out all of
 

2545
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:28,710
work algorithm which takes out all of
the miners right so

2546
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:28,720
the miners right so
 

2547
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,430
the miners right so
the the economics of like recovering

2548
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:31,440
the the economics of like recovering
 

2549
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,030
the the economics of like recovering
from attacks and proof of work at least

2550
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:33,040
from attacks and proof of work at least
 

2551
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:33,510
from attacks and proof of work at least
to me

2552
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:33,520
to me
 

2553
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,870
to me
actually do seem more unfavorable

2554
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:36,880
actually do seem more unfavorable
 

2555
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,870
actually do seem more unfavorable
but you know i'm sure the proof of work

2556
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:38,880
but you know i'm sure the proof of work
 

2557
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,470
but you know i'm sure the proof of work
people you talk to will give a very

2558
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:40,480
people you talk to will give a very
 

2559
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,470
people you talk to will give a very
different and contradictory opinions and

2560
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:42,480
different and contradictory opinions and
 

2561
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,030
different and contradictory opinions and
that's

2562
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:43,040
that's
 

2563
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,190
that's
totally fine and amazing some people

2564
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:45,200
totally fine and amazing some people
 

2565

sure how about after this one we'll also

2578
00:40:59,030 --> 00:40:59,040
sure how about after this one we'll also
 

2579
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,390
sure how about after this one we'll also
talk about sharding because that's

2580
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:00,400
talk about sharding because that's
 

2581
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,309
talk about sharding because that's
amazing and it's part of the return back

2582
00:41:02,309 --> 00:41:02,319
amazing and it's part of the return back
 

2583
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:03,670
amazing and it's part of the return back
to sharding and

to sharding and
 

2585
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,910
to sharding and
which is no no return to the big picture

2586
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:05,920
which is no no return to the big picture
 

2587
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,829
which is no no return to the big picture
of the scaling problem as you mentioned

00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:21,750
stake right so like if you want to call
it

2602
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:21,760
it
 

2603
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,510
it
you know block proposal extractable

2604
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:23,520
you know block proposal extractable
 

2605
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,109
you know block proposal extractable
value like it sounds a lot sexy but you

2606
00:41:25,109 --> 00:41:25,119
value like it sounds a lot sexy but you
 

2607
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,870
value like it sounds a lot sexy but you
know we can call it bpef instead of math

2608
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:26,880
know we can call it bpef instead of math
 

2609
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,750
know we can call it bpef instead of math
who cares

2610
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:27,760
who cares
 

2611
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,550
who cares
um but so this is a problem in both

2612
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:30,560
um but so this is a problem in both
 

2613
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,990
um but so this is a problem in both
proof of work and proof of stake

2614
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:32,000
proof of work and proof of stake
 

2615
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,589
proof of work and proof of stake
yes so the basic idea is

2616
00:41:35,589 --> 00:41:35,599
yes so the basic idea is
 

2617
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:39,190
yes so the basic idea is
that if you have the ability to choose

2618
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:39,200
that if you have the ability to choose
 

2619
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,349
that if you have the ability to choose
which transactions go into a block and

2620
00:41:41,349 --> 00:41:41,359
which transactions go into a block and
 

2621
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:42,470
which transactions go into a block and
in what order

2622
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:42,480
in what order
 

2623
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,550
in what order
then you have the ability to like take

2624
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:44,560
then you have the ability to like take
 

2625
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,309
then you have the ability to like take
advantage of that position for economic

2626
00:41:46,309 --> 00:41:46,319
advantage of that position for economic
 

2627
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:46,790
advantage of that position for economic
gain

2628
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:46,800
gain
 

2629
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,630
gain
in a lot more ways than just collecting

2630
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:48,640
in a lot more ways than just collecting
 

2631
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,990
in a lot more ways than just collecting
transaction fees right

2632
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:50,000
transaction fees right
 

2633
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,990
transaction fees right
like for example there's decentralized

2634
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:52,000
like for example there's decentralized
 

2635
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,910
like for example there's decentralized
exchanges on chain like uniswap

2636
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:53,920
exchanges on chain like uniswap
 

2637
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,430
exchanges on chain like uniswap
and like let's say the price of eth

2638
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:57,440
and like let's say the price of eth
 

2639
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,790
and like let's say the price of eth
versus usdc was 2700

2640
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:00,800
versus usdc was 2700
 

2641
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,470
versus usdc was 2700
the previous block but then there was a

2642
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:02,480
the previous block but then there was a
 

2643
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,710
the previous block but then there was a
bit of a market drop and now it's 26.80

2644
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:04,720
bit of a market drop and now it's 26.80
 

2645
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,069
bit of a market drop and now it's 26.80
where you can go on unit swap and you

2646
00:42:06,069 --> 00:42:06,079
where you can go on unit swap and you
 

2647
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:07,910
where you can go on unit swap and you
can just like gobble up the entire part

2648
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:07,920
can just like gobble up the entire part
 

2649
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,470
can just like gobble up the entire part
of

2650
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:08,480
of
 

2651
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,790
of
um you know the automated order book

2652
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:10,800
um you know the automated order book
 

2653
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,510
um you know the automated order book
that's like between 2700 and 26.80 right

2654
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:13,520
that's like between 2700 and 26.80 right
 

2655
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,309
that's like between 2700 and 26.80 right
and that's

2656
00:42:14,309 --> 00:42:14,319
and that's
 

2657
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:16,150
and that's
and then at the same time you like run a

2658
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:16,160
and then at the same time you like run a
 

2659
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,510
and then at the same time you like run a
bot and uh

2660
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:17,520
bot and uh
 

2661
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,710
bot and uh
you know you buy some yeast back at

2662
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:18,720
you know you buy some yeast back at
 

2663
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,470
you know you buy some yeast back at
26.80 and you've just like made about 10

2664
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:20,480
26.80 and you've just like made about 10
 

2665
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,550
26.80 and you've just like made about 10
dollars of profit right so

2666
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:22,560
dollars of profit right so
 

2667
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,990
dollars of profit right so
or well 10 dollars times you know

2668
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:24,000
or well 10 dollars times you know
 

2669
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,750
or well 10 dollars times you know
whatever the depth is right so and

2670
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:25,760
whatever the depth is right so and
 

2671
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,750
whatever the depth is right so and
so there's lots of um little things like

2672
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:27,760
so there's lots of um little things like
 

2673
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,630
so there's lots of um little things like
that there's also things um that involve

2674
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:30,640
that there's also things um that involve
 

2675
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,150
that there's also things um that involve
like front running other people's

2676
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:32,160
like front running other people's
 

2677
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,630
like front running other people's
transactions so one example of this

2678
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:34,640
transactions so one example of this
 

2679
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,190
transactions so one example of this
would be

2680
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:35,200
would be
 

2681
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,990
would be
that if someone sends a transaction that

2682
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:38,000
that if someone sends a transaction that
 

2683
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,910
that if someone sends a transaction that
says

2684
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:39,920
says
 

2685
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,589
says
buy me five eth for um

2686
00:42:43,589 --> 00:42:43,599
buy me five eth for um
 

2687
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:46,390
buy me five eth for um
whatever price that you can get um then

2688
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:46,400
whatever price that you can get um then
 

2689
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,829
whatever price that you can get um then
but with a maximum of

2690
00:42:47,829 --> 00:42:47,839
but with a maximum of
 

2691
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:51,670
but with a maximum of
let's say yeah uh 15 000 then you can go

2692
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:51,680
let's say yeah uh 15 000 then you can go
 

2693
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,150
let's say yeah uh 15 000 then you can go
and like

2694
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:52,160
and like
 

2695
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,309
and like
you can send each put a transaction

2696
00:42:54,309 --> 00:42:54,319
you can send each put a transaction
 

2697
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:55,750
you can send each put a transaction
right in front of that transaction

2698
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:55,760
right in front of that transaction
 

2699
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,510
right in front of that transaction
and you can like buy up that east first

2700
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:57,520
and you can like buy up that east first
 

2701
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,950
and you can like buy up that east first
and then you resell it to him at you

2702
00:42:58,950 --> 00:42:58,960
and then you resell it to him at you
 

2703
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,550
and then you resell it to him at you
know fifteen thousand dollars minus one

2704
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:00,560
know fifteen thousand dollars minus one
 

2705
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,030
know fifteen thousand dollars minus one
yeah so there's then you get to make a

2706
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:03,040
yeah so there's then you get to make a
 

2707
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,390
yeah so there's then you get to make a
little bit of money though exactly so

2708
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:04,400
little bit of money though exactly so
 

2709
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,670
little bit of money though exactly so
there's a lot of these different like

2710
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:05,680
there's a lot of these different like
 

2711
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,270
there's a lot of these different like
arbitrage front running back running

2712
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:07,280
arbitrage front running back running
 

2713
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,470
arbitrage front running back running
these different tricks

2714
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:08,480
these different tricks
 

2715
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,270
these different tricks
that allow block proposers to to get

2716
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:11,280
that allow block proposers to to get
 

2717
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,150
that allow block proposers to to get
some percentage

2718
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:12,160
some percentage
 

2719
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,790
some percentage
on top like overhead exactly and the

2720
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:14,800
on top like overhead exactly and the
 

2721
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,550
on top like overhead exactly and the
reason why this is um

2722
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:16,560
reason why this is um
 

2723
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,990
reason why this is um
a challenge is because um

2724
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:20,000
a challenge is because um
 

2725
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,150
a challenge is because um
it's like first of all it's some it

2726
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:22,160
it's like first of all it's some it
 

2727
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,349
it's like first of all it's some it
sometimes degrades

2728
00:43:23,349 --> 00:43:23,359
sometimes degrades
 

2729
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:25,109
sometimes degrades
user experience because users get you

2730
00:43:25,109 --> 00:43:25,119
user experience because users get you
 

2731
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:26,550
user experience because users get you
know less favorable uh

2732
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:26,560
know less favorable uh
 

2733
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,510
know less favorable uh
trades but there are sometimes ways to

2734
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:29,520
trades but there are sometimes ways to
 

2735
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,190
trades but there are sometimes ways to
like mitigate that for applications

2736
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:31,200
like mitigate that for applications
 

2737
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,870
like mitigate that for applications
sometimes it's not that bad

2738
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:32,880
sometimes it's not that bad
 

2739
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,790
sometimes it's not that bad
but like the bigger risk that i think

2740
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:34,800
but like the bigger risk that i think
 

2741
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,630
but like the bigger risk that i think
some people consider more existential

2742
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:36,640
some people consider more existential
 

2743
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,430
some people consider more existential
is that there's just much more economies

2744
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:39,440
is that there's just much more economies
 

2745
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,150
is that there's just much more economies
of scale

2746
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:40,160
of scale
 

2747
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,990
of scale
in figuring out how to extract all this

2748
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:42,000
in figuring out how to extract all this
 

2749
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,510
in figuring out how to extract all this
revenue i mean because if you're just

2750
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:43,520
revenue i mean because if you're just
 

2751
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,109
revenue i mean because if you're just
collecting transaction fees

2752
00:43:45,109 --> 00:43:45,119
collecting transaction fees
 

2753
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:47,270
collecting transaction fees
there aren't really economies of scale

2754
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:47,280
there aren't really economies of scale
 

2755
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,309
there aren't really economies of scale
there aren't really benefits to

2756
00:43:48,309 --> 00:43:48,319
there aren't really benefits to
 

2757
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:49,829
there aren't really benefits to
centralizing right because it's a very

2758
00:43:49,829 --> 00:43:49,839
centralizing right because it's a very
 

2759
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:51,430
centralizing right because it's a very
simple formula you just like grab up the

2760
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:51,440
simple formula you just like grab up the
 

2761
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,270
simple formula you just like grab up the
transactions that pay you the most

2762
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:53,280
transactions that pay you the most
 

2763
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,750
transactions that pay you the most
but with mev you know you ha there's all

2764
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:55,760
but with mev you know you ha there's all
 

2765
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,750
but with mev you know you ha there's all
these sophisticated algorithms

2766
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:57,760
these sophisticated algorithms
 

2767
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,069
these sophisticated algorithms
and if you have lots of money then you

2768
00:44:00,069 --> 00:44:00,079
and if you have lots of money then you
 

2769
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:01,510
and if you have lots of money then you
can hire really smart people to make

2770
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:01,520
can hire really smart people to make
 

2771
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,030
can hire really smart people to make
amazing algorithms and then you can use

2772
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:03,040
amazing algorithms and then you can use
 

2773
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,470
amazing algorithms and then you can use
the other half of your money

2774
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:04,480
the other half of your money
 

2775
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,309
the other half of your money
to get a lot of mining power a lot of

2776
00:44:06,309 --> 00:44:06,319
to get a lot of mining power a lot of
 

2777
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:08,069
to get a lot of mining power a lot of
stake and you get a lot of opportunities

2778
00:44:08,069 --> 00:44:08,079
stake and you get a lot of opportunities
 

2779
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:09,910
stake and you get a lot of opportunities
to use your even better algorithms

2780
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:09,920
to use your even better algorithms
 

2781
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,109
to use your even better algorithms
so there's this risk that like as a

2782
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:13,119
so there's this risk that like as a
 

2783
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:14,470
so there's this risk that like as a
result of this

2784
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:14,480
result of this
 

2785
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,510
result of this
mining is basically or or even

2786
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:17,520
mining is basically or or even
 

2787
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,870
mining is basically or or even
validating proof of stake is going to

2788
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:18,880
validating proof of stake is going to
 

2789
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:19,990
validating proof of stake is going to
centralize

2790
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:20,000
centralize
 

2791
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,750
centralize
um so i think the ecosystems best reply

2792
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:23,760
um so i think the ecosystems best reply
 

2793
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:24,790
um so i think the ecosystems best reply
to this sort of risk

2794
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:24,800
to this sort of risk
 

2795
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,950
to this sort of risk
and it's the direction where projects

2796
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:26,960
and it's the direction where projects
 

2797
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,870
and it's the direction where projects
like flashbots are going already

2798
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:28,880
like flashbots are going already
 

2799
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,230
like flashbots are going already
is if you can't eliminate the

2800
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:32,240
is if you can't eliminate the
 

2801
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,630
is if you can't eliminate the
centralization then you try to firewall

2802
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:34,640
centralization then you try to firewall
 

2803
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,309
centralization then you try to firewall
it right and the way that you

2804
00:44:36,309 --> 00:44:36,319
it right and the way that you
 

2805
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:39,270
it right and the way that you
fire wallet is you basically say we're

2806
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:39,280
fire wallet is you basically say we're
 

2807
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,190
fire wallet is you basically say we're
going to try to deliberately create a

2808
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:41,200
going to try to deliberately create a
 

2809
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,550
going to try to deliberately create a
marketplace where

2810
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:42,560
marketplace where
 

2811
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,270
marketplace where
people can just do the complicated work

2812
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:45,280
people can just do the complicated work
 

2813
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:45,990
people can just do the complicated work
of creating

2814
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:46,000
of creating
 

2815
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,910
of creating
what are called bundles like bundles of

2816
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:47,920
what are called bundles like bundles of
 

2817
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,510
what are called bundles like bundles of
transactions that

2818
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:49,520
transactions that
 

2819
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,870
transactions that
like are very profitable right and then

2820
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:52,880
like are very profitable right and then
 

2821
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,470
like are very profitable right and then
at the other side of the market you just

2822
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:54,480
at the other side of the market you just
 

2823
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,630
at the other side of the market you just
have like block proposes reminders that

2824
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:56,640
have like block proposes reminders that
 

2825
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,670
have like block proposes reminders that
are just dumb nodes

2826
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:57,680
are just dumb nodes
 

2827
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,230
are just dumb nodes
and they go and ask the what are called

2828
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:00,240
and they go and ask the what are called
 

2829
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,829
and they go and ask the what are called
searchers the bundle creators

2830
00:45:01,829 --> 00:45:01,839
searchers the bundle creators
 

2831
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:03,750
searchers the bundle creators
and they just ask like hey like how much

2832
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:03,760
and they just ask like hey like how much
 

2833
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,430
and they just ask like hey like how much
can you give me if i put in your bundle

2834
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:05,440
can you give me if i put in your bundle
 

2835
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,550
can you give me if i put in your bundle
and then they just take the highest

2836
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:06,560
and then they just take the highest
 

2837
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,109
and then they just take the highest
offer

2838
00:45:07,109 --> 00:45:07,119
offer
 

2839
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:08,870
offer
right so you sort of separate out the

2840
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:08,880
right so you sort of separate out the
 

2841
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,470
right so you sort of separate out the
task and you know you have

2842
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:10,480
task and you know you have
 

2843
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,069
task and you know you have
the easy part and then you have the hard

2844
00:45:12,069 --> 00:45:12,079
the easy part and then you have the hard
 

2845
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:13,750
the easy part and then you have the hard
part and you have like this special

2846
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:13,760
part and you have like this special
 

2847
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,190
part and you have like this special
class of actor called a searcher that

2848
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:15,200
class of actor called a searcher that
 

2849
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,069
class of actor called a searcher that
does the hard part

2850
00:45:16,069 --> 00:45:16,079
does the hard part
 

2851
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:18,790
does the hard part
and then the easy part the people doing

2852
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:18,800
and then the easy part the people doing
 

2853
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,150
and then the easy part the people doing
the easy part which is just miners and

2854
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:20,160
the easy part which is just miners and
 

2855
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,990
the easy part which is just miners and
validators they kind of

2856
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:22,000
validators they kind of
 

2857
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,470
validators they kind of
just talk to all the different people

2858
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:24,480
just talk to all the different people
 

2859
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,910
just talk to all the different people
doing the searching and they just you

2860
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:25,920
doing the searching and they just you
 

2861
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,750
doing the searching and they just you
know accept the highest bidder right

2862
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:27,760
know accept the highest bidder right
 

2863
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,870
know accept the highest bidder right
so and this is also just like

2864
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:30,880
so and this is also just like
 

2865
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,190
so and this is also just like
interesting uh an interesting example of

2866
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:33,200
interesting uh an interesting example of
 

2867
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,950
interesting uh an interesting example of
like economic design philosophy

2868
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:34,960
like economic design philosophy
 

2869
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,270
like economic design philosophy
right like sometimes you can't just like

2870
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:37,280
right like sometimes you can't just like
 

2871
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,030
right like sometimes you can't just like
make centralization go away sometimes

2872
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:39,040
make centralization go away sometimes
 

2873
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,309
make centralization go away sometimes
it's inevitable but

2874
00:45:40,309 --> 00:45:40,319
it's inevitable but
 

2875
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:42,550
it's inevitable but
you know at least you can try to kind of

2876
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:42,560
you know at least you can try to kind of
 

2877
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,150
you know at least you can try to kind of
contain it you can direct it

2878
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:44,160
contain it you can direct it
 

2879
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,390
contain it you can direct it
or you know you can even sort of

2880
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:46,400
or you know you can even sort of
 

2881
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,670
or you know you can even sort of
firewall it away from

2882
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:47,680
firewall it away from
 

2883
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,670
firewall it away from
you know core consensus the parts that

2884
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:49,680
you know core consensus the parts that
 

2885
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,510
you know core consensus the parts that
really do need to be decentralized

2886
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:51,520
really do need to be decentralized
 

2887
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,790
really do need to be decentralized
so but you don't see it as an

2888
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:52,800
so but you don't see it as an
 

2889
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,710
so but you don't see it as an
existential risk it's just incredible

2890
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:54,720
existential risk it's just incredible
 

2891
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,550
existential risk it's just incredible
it's a bit of a problem that it has to

2892
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:56,560
it's a bit of a problem that it has to
 

2893
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,829
it's a bit of a problem that it has to
be constantly dealt with

2894
00:45:57,829 --> 00:45:57,839
be constantly dealt with
 

2895
00:45:57,839 --> 00:45:59,670
be constantly dealt with
it's a i mean it's a risk like there's

2896
00:45:59,670 --> 00:45:59,680
it's a i mean it's a risk like there's
 

2897
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,309
it's a i mean it's a risk like there's
obviously a risk that you know there it

2898
00:46:02,309 --> 00:46:02,319
obviously a risk that you know there it
 

2899
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:04,870
obviously a risk that you know there it
it's a very severe problem and that even

2900
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:04,880
it's a very severe problem and that even
 

2901
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,630
it's a very severe problem and that even
this flashbots approach has some fatal

2902
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:06,640
this flashbots approach has some fatal
 

2903
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,670
this flashbots approach has some fatal
flaw or whatever

2904
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:07,680
flaw or whatever
 

2905
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,870
flaw or whatever
um but i'm definitely like

2906
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:10,880
um but i'm definitely like
 

2907
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,230
um but i'm definitely like
we're definitely approaching it with the

2908
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:12,240
we're definitely approaching it with the
 

2909
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,230
we're definitely approaching it with the
mindset of you know this is a problem

2910
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:14,240
mindset of you know this is a problem
 

2911
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,750
mindset of you know this is a problem
and like yes we do have to do some work

2912
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:15,760
and like yes we do have to do some work
 

2913
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,069
and like yes we do have to do some work
to solve it but we're doing it and uh

2914
00:46:18,069 --> 00:46:18,079
to solve it but we're doing it and uh
 

2915
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:20,710
to solve it but we're doing it and uh
so far it's being solved okay let's talk

2916
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:20,720
so far it's being solved okay let's talk
 

2917
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:21,829
so far it's being solved okay let's talk

the future of ethereum let's not call it
ethereum 2.0

00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:33,040
require a hard fork i don't know you can
 

2929
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,790
require a hard fork i don't know you can
correct me on this

2930
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:34,800
correct me on this
 

2931
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,829
correct me on this
is well broadly

2932
00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:37,839
is well broadly
 

2933
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:40,829
is well broadly
ideas for scaling yes and more

2934
00:46:40,829 --> 00:46:40,839
ideas for scaling yes and more
 

2935
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:41,990
ideas for scaling yes and more
specifically

2936
00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:42,000
specifically
 

2937
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,670
specifically
sort of uh layer two or uh

2938
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:45,680
sort of uh layer two or uh
 

2939
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,470
sort of uh layer two or uh
layer one and two intersection ideas of

2940
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:48,480
layer one and two intersection ideas of
 

2941
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,990
layer one and two intersection ideas of
how to achieve scaling

2942
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:50,000
how to achieve scaling
 

2943
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,230
how to achieve scaling
and at the core of that is the idea of

2944
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:52,240
and at the core of that is the idea of
 

2945
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,030
and at the core of that is the idea of
sharding so

2946
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:53,040
sharding so
 

2947
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,230
sharding so
first what is sharding okay

2948
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:56,240
first what is sharding okay
 

2949
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,829
first what is sharding okay
uh so there's two major paradigms for

2950
00:46:59,829 --> 00:46:59,839
uh so there's two major paradigms for
 

2951
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,190
uh so there's two major paradigms for
scaling blockchains right as

2952
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:01,200
scaling blockchains right as
 

2953
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,190
scaling blockchains right as
you said layer one and layer two and

2954
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:03,200
you said layer one and layer two and
 

2955
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,109
you said layer one and layer two and
layer one basically means

2956
00:47:05,109 --> 00:47:05,119
layer one basically means
 

2957
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:07,829
layer one basically means
make the blockchain itself like capable

2958
00:47:07,829 --> 00:47:07,839
make the blockchain itself like capable
 

2959
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:10,150
make the blockchain itself like capable
of processing more transactions by

2960
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:10,160
of processing more transactions by
 

2961
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,670
of processing more transactions by
having you know some

2962
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:11,680
having you know some
 

2963
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,510
having you know some
mechanism by which you can do that

2964
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:13,520
mechanism by which you can do that
 

2965
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,589
mechanism by which you can do that
despite the fact that there's a limit to

2966
00:47:15,589 --> 00:47:15,599
despite the fact that there's a limit to
 

2967
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,109
despite the fact that there's a limit to
the capacity of each participant in the

2968
00:47:17,109 --> 00:47:17,119
the capacity of each participant in the
 

2969
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:17,910
the capacity of each participant in the
blockchain

2970
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:17,920
blockchain
 

2971
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,349
blockchain
and then layer two says well we're gonna

2972
00:47:19,349 --> 00:47:19,359
and then layer two says well we're gonna
 

2973
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:21,190
and then layer two says well we're gonna
keep the blockchain as is

2974
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:21,200
keep the blockchain as is
 

2975
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,670
keep the blockchain as is
but we're gonna create clever protocols

2976
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:23,680
but we're gonna create clever protocols
 

2977
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,349
but we're gonna create clever protocols
that sit on top of the blockchain

2978
00:47:25,349 --> 00:47:25,359
that sit on top of the blockchain
 

2979
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:27,109
that sit on top of the blockchain
that still use the blockchain and then

2980
00:47:27,109 --> 00:47:27,119
that still use the blockchain and then
 

2981
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:28,870
that still use the blockchain and then
still kind of inherit things like the

2982
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:28,880
still kind of inherit things like the
 

2983
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,950
still kind of inherit things like the
security guarantees of a blockchain

2984
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:30,960
security guarantees of a blockchain
 

2985
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,030
security guarantees of a blockchain
but at the same time a lot of things are

2986
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:33,040
but at the same time a lot of things are
 

2987
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,390
but at the same time a lot of things are
done off-chain and so

2988
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:34,400
done off-chain and so
 

2989
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,430
done off-chain and so
you get more scalability that way um so

2990
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:37,440
you get more scalability that way um so
 

2991
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,589
you get more scalability that way um so

size debate sure so the way that i think

3032
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:19,200
size debate sure so the way that i think
 

3033
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,790
size debate sure so the way that i think
about the trade-off is i think about it

3034
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:20,800
about the trade-off is i think about it
 

3035
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,150
about the trade-off is i think about it
as a trade-off between

3036
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:22,160
as a trade-off between
 

3037
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,589
as a trade-off between
making it easy to write to the

3038
00:48:23,589 --> 00:48:23,599
making it easy to write to the
 

3039
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:25,270
making it easy to write to the
blockchain and making it easy to read

3040
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:25,280
blockchain and making it easy to read
 

3041
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,069
blockchain and making it easy to read
the blockchain

3042
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:26,079
the blockchain
 

3043
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:28,230
the blockchain
right so when i say read i just mean you

3044
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:28,240
right so when i say read i just mean you
 

3045
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,069
right so when i say read i just mean you
know have a node and actually verify it

3046
00:48:30,069 --> 00:48:30,079
know have a node and actually verify it
 

3047
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:31,510
know have a node and actually verify it
and make sure that it's correct and all

3048
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:31,520
and make sure that it's correct and all
 

3049
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,309
and make sure that it's correct and all
of those things

3050
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:32,319
of those things
 

3051
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:33,510
of those things
and then by right i mean send

3052
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:33,520
and then by right i mean send
 

3053
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,670
and then by right i mean send
transactions so like

3054
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:35,680
transactions so like
 

3055
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,750
transactions so like
i think for decentralization it's

3056
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:37,760
i think for decentralization it's
 

3057
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,349
i think for decentralization it's
important for both of these tasks to be

3058
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:39,359
important for both of these tasks to be
 

3059
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:40,150
important for both of these tasks to be
accessible

3060
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:40,160
accessible
 

3061
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,589
accessible
and i think that they're like about

3062
00:48:41,589 --> 00:48:41,599
and i think that they're like about
 

3063
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:43,510
and i think that they're like about
equally important right if you have a

3064
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:43,520
equally important right if you have a
 

3065
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,190
equally important right if you have a
chain that's too expensive to read then

3066
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:45,200
chain that's too expensive to read then
 

3067
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,270
chain that's too expensive to read then
everyone will just trust a few people to

3068
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:47,280
everyone will just trust a few people to
 

3069
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,030
everyone will just trust a few people to
like read for them and then those people

3070
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:49,040
like read for them and then those people
 

3071
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,390
like read for them and then those people
can change the rules without anyone

3072
00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:50,400
can change the rules without anyone
 

3073
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,670
can change the rules without anyone
else's permission

3074
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:51,680
else's permission
 

3075
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,670
else's permission
but if on the other hand it becomes

3076
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:53,680
but if on the other hand it becomes
 

3077
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,190
but if on the other hand it becomes
really expensive to write

3078
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:55,200
really expensive to write
 

3079
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,630
really expensive to write
then everyone will move on to basically

3080
00:48:58,630 --> 00:48:58,640
then everyone will move on to basically
 

3081
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,710
then everyone will move on to basically
second layer systems that are incredibly

3082
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:00,720
second layer systems that are incredibly
 

3083
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,030
second layer systems that are incredibly
centralized and like that takes away

3084
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:03,040
centralized and like that takes away
 

3085
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:03,430
centralized and like that takes away
from

3086
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:03,440
from
 

3087
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,630
from
you know decentralization and

3088
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:04,640
you know decentralization and
 

3089
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,950
you know decentralization and
self-sovereignty as well so

3090
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:06,960
self-sovereignty as well so
 

3091
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,390
self-sovereignty as well so
this has been my viewpoints like pretty

3092
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:08,400
this has been my viewpoints like pretty
 

3093
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,829
this has been my viewpoints like pretty
much the whole time right it's that like

3094
00:49:09,829 --> 00:49:09,839
much the whole time right it's that like
 

3095
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:11,190
much the whole time right it's that like
you know you need this balance and going

3096
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:11,200
you know you need this balance and going
 

3097
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,710
you know you need this balance and going
in one direction or the other direction

3098
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:12,720
in one direction or the other direction
 

3099
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,230
in one direction or the other direction
is very unhealthy

3100
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:14,240
is very unhealthy
 

3101
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,230
is very unhealthy
in the bitcoin case um basically what

3102
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:16,240
in the bitcoin case um basically what
 

3103
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,670
in the bitcoin case um basically what
happens was that

3104
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:17,680
happens was that
 

3105
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,150
happens was that
bitcoin originally like at the very

3106
00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:20,160
bitcoin originally like at the very
 

3107
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,670
bitcoin originally like at the very
beginning it didn't really have a block

3108
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:21,680
beginning it didn't really have a block
 

3109
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:22,710
beginning it didn't really have a block
size it just had

3110
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:22,720
size it just had
 

3111
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,430
size it just had
an accidental block size of 32 meg or a

3112
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:25,440
an accidental block size of 32 meg or a
 

3113
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,829
an accidental block size of 32 meg or a
block size limit of 32 megabytes because

3114
00:49:27,829 --> 00:49:27,839
block size limit of 32 megabytes because
 

3115
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,750
block size limit of 32 megabytes because
that just happens to be the limit of the

3116
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:29,760
that just happens to be the limit of the
 

3117
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,030
that just happens to be the limit of the
peer-to-peer messages

3118
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:31,040
peer-to-peer messages
 

3119
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,549
peer-to-peer messages
um but that's interesting i didn't even

3120
00:49:32,549 --> 00:49:32,559
um but that's interesting i didn't even
 

3121
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:34,710
um but that's interesting i didn't even
know that part yeah but then

3122
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:34,720
know that part yeah but then
 

3123
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,430
know that part yeah but then
um satoshi back in 2010 was worried that

3124
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:37,440
um satoshi back in 2010 was worried that
 

3125
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,030
um satoshi back in 2010 was worried that
even 32 megabyte blocks would be too

3126
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:39,040
even 32 megabyte blocks would be too
 

3127
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,470
even 32 megabyte blocks would be too
hard to process so he

3128
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:40,480
hard to process so he
 

3129
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,549
hard to process so he
uh put the limit down to one megabyte

3130
00:49:42,549 --> 00:49:42,559
uh put the limit down to one megabyte
 

3131
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:44,230
uh put the limit down to one megabyte
and you know i think

3132
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:44,240
and you know i think
 

3133
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:47,430
and you know i think
the i put you mean sneaked in there yeah

3134
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:47,440
the i put you mean sneaked in there yeah
 

3135
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,349
the i put you mean sneaked in there yeah
just like made an update to the bitcoin

3136
00:49:49,349 --> 00:49:49,359
just like made an update to the bitcoin
 

3137
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:51,109
just like made an update to the bitcoin
software that made blocks bigger than

3138
00:49:51,109 --> 00:49:51,119
software that made blocks bigger than
 

3139
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:51,990
software that made blocks bigger than
one i think it's

3140
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:52,000
one i think it's
 

3141
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,190
one i think it's
a million bytes um invalid and

3142
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:55,200
a million bytes um invalid and
 

3143
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,510
a million bytes um invalid and
i think the impression that most people

3144
00:49:57,510 --> 00:49:57,520
i think the impression that most people
 

3145
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,109
i think the impression that most people
had at the time is that you know this is

3146
00:49:59,109 --> 00:49:59,119
had at the time is that you know this is
 

3147
00:49:59,119 --> 00:49:59,589
had at the time is that you know this is
just

3148
00:49:59,589 --> 00:49:59,599
just
 

3149
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:02,630
just
a temporary safety measure and over time

3150
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:02,640
a temporary safety measure and over time
 

3151
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,549
a temporary safety measure and over time
you know though as we become more

3152
00:50:04,549 --> 00:50:04,559
you know though as we become more
 

3153
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:06,309
you know though as we become more
confident in the software that limit

3154
00:50:06,309 --> 00:50:06,319
confident in the software that limit
 

3155
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:06,790
confident in the software that limit
would be

3156
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:06,800
would be
 

3157
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,230
would be
and like raised some uh somewhat

3158
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:10,240
and like raised some uh somewhat
 

3159
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,349
and like raised some uh somewhat
um but ba then

3160
00:50:13,349 --> 00:50:13,359
um but ba then
 

3161
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:15,670
um but ba then
of when the actual usage of the

3162
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:15,680
of when the actual usage of the
 

3163
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,270
of when the actual usage of the
blockchain started going up

3164
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:17,280
blockchain started going up
 

3165
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,190
blockchain started going up
and then it started going up first to

3166
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:19,200
and then it started going up first to
 

3167
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,470
and then it started going up first to
100 kilobytes

3168
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:20,480
100 kilobytes
 

3169
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,230
100 kilobytes
per block then to 250 kilobytes per

3170
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:22,240
per block then to 250 kilobytes per
 

3171
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,470
per block then to 250 kilobytes per
block then to 500 kilobytes per block

3172
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:24,480
block then to 500 kilobytes per block
 

3173
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,309
block then to 500 kilobytes per block
um you know they're started kind of

3174
00:50:26,309 --> 00:50:26,319
um you know they're started kind of
 

3175
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:28,309
um you know they're started kind of
coming out of the woodworks this opinion

3176
00:50:28,309 --> 00:50:28,319
coming out of the woodworks this opinion
 

3177
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:29,910
coming out of the woodworks this opinion
that like no that limit should just not

3178
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:29,920
that like no that limit should just not
 

3179
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:30,950
that like no that limit should just not
be increased

3180
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:30,960
be increased
 

3181
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,390
be increased
and and you know then there are all of

3182
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:34,400
and and you know then there are all of
 

3183
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,470
and and you know then there are all of
these attempts at compromising right

3184
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:36,480
these attempts at compromising right
 

3185
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,109
these attempts at compromising right
um you know first there's like a

3186
00:50:39,109 --> 00:50:39,119
um you know first there's like a
 

3187
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,030
um you know first there's like a
proposal for 20 megabyte blocks then

3188
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:41,040
proposal for 20 megabyte blocks then
 

3189
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,030
proposal for 20 megabyte blocks then
there was the 248 proposal

3190
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:43,040
there was the 248 proposal
 

3191
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,670
there was the 248 proposal
which is um a bit ironic because the 248

3192
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:45,680
which is um a bit ironic because the 248
 

3193
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,270
which is um a bit ironic because the 248
proposal started off being

3194
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:47,280
proposal started off being
 

3195
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,349
proposal started off being
like a small block negotiating position

3196
00:50:49,349 --> 00:50:49,359
like a small block negotiating position
 

3197
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:51,349
like a small block negotiating position
but then when the big black people came

3198
00:50:51,349 --> 00:50:51,359
but then when the big black people came
 

3199
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:52,950
but then when the big black people came
back and said like hey where are we are

3200
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:52,960
back and said like hey where are we are
 

3201
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,309
back and said like hey where are we are
we gonna do this they're like oh no no

3202
00:50:54,309 --> 00:50:54,319
we gonna do this they're like oh no no
 

3203
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:55,430
we gonna do this they're like oh no no
no we don't want them we don't want the

3204
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:55,440
no we don't want them we don't want the
 

3205
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,270
no we don't want them we don't want the
block size increases anymore

3206
00:50:57,270 --> 00:50:57,280
block size increases anymore
 

3207
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,549
block size increases anymore
uh so you know there were these two

3208
00:51:00,549 --> 00:51:00,559
uh so you know there were these two
 

3209
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:01,829
uh so you know there were these two
different positions right the small

3210
00:51:01,829 --> 00:51:01,839
different positions right the small
 

3211
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:02,549
different positions right the small
blockers

3212
00:51:02,549 --> 00:51:02,559
blockers
 

3213
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:05,190
blockers
i think they valued one megabyte blocks

3214
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:05,200
i think they valued one megabyte blocks
 

3215
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,069
i think they valued one megabyte blocks
for two reasons

3216
00:51:06,069 --> 00:51:06,079
for two reasons
 

3217
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:07,829
for two reasons
one is that they just like really really

3218
00:51:07,829 --> 00:51:07,839
one is that they just like really really
 

3219
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:09,430
one is that they just like really really
believe in the importance of

3220
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:09,440
believe in the importance of
 

3221
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,910
believe in the importance of
being able to read the chain but two is

3222
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:11,920
being able to read the chain but two is
 

3223
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,190
being able to read the chain but two is
that a lot of them

3224
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:13,200
that a lot of them
 

3225
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,150
that a lot of them
really believe in in maintaining this

3226
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:16,160
really believe in in maintaining this
 

3227
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,750
really believe in in maintaining this
norm of never hard forking

3228
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:17,760
norm of never hard forking
 

3229
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,990
norm of never hard forking
right right so the difference between a

3230
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:20,000
right right so the difference between a
 

3231
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,750
right right so the difference between a
hard fork and a soft fork is basically

3232
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:21,760
hard fork and a soft fork is basically
 

3233
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,390
hard fork and a soft fork is basically
that

3234
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:22,400
that
 

3235
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,230
that
in a soft fork um blocks that were

3236
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:26,240
in a soft fork um blocks that were
 

3237
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,829
in a soft fork um blocks that were
any block that's valid under the new

3238
00:51:27,829 --> 00:51:27,839
any block that's valid under the new
 

3239
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:29,349
any block that's valid under the new
rules was still valid under the old

3240
00:51:29,349 --> 00:51:29,359
rules was still valid under the old
 

3241
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:29,910
rules was still valid under the old
rules

3242
00:51:29,910 --> 00:51:29,920
rules
 

3243
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,589
rules
so if you have a client that verifies

3244
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:31,599
so if you have a client that verifies
 

3245
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:33,190
so if you have a client that verifies
according to the old rules then you'll

3246
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:33,200
according to the old rules then you'll
 

3247
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,430
according to the old rules then you'll
still be able to accept the chain

3248
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:35,440
still be able to accept the chain
 

3249
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,670
still be able to accept the chain
that follows the new rules whereas with

3250
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:37,680
that follows the new rules whereas with
 

3251
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,750
that follows the new rules whereas with
a hard fork like you have to

3252
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:39,760
a hard fork like you have to
 

3253
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,589
a hard fork like you have to
update your code in order to stay on the

3254
00:51:41,589 --> 00:51:41,599
update your code in order to stay on the
 

3255
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,030
update your code in order to stay on the
chain

3256
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:43,040
chain
 

3257
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:46,870
chain
and look they have this belief that

3258
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:46,880
and look they have this belief that
 

3259
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,349
and look they have this belief that
you know soft forks are kind of either

3260
00:51:49,349 --> 00:51:49,359
you know soft forks are kind of either
 

3261
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:51,190
you know soft forks are kind of either
less coercive than hard forks which by

3262
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:51,200
less coercive than hard forks which by
 

3263
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,630
less coercive than hard forks which by
the way i completely disagree with

3264
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:52,640
the way i completely disagree with
 

3265
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,630
the way i completely disagree with
um i actually think soft forks are more

3266
00:51:54,630 --> 00:51:54,640
um i actually think soft forks are more
 

3267
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,309
um i actually think soft forks are more
coercive because like basically they

3268
00:51:56,309 --> 00:51:56,319
coercive because like basically they
 

3269
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:57,910
coercive because like basically they
force everyone who disagrees to sort of

3270
00:51:57,910 --> 00:51:57,920
force everyone who disagrees to sort of
 

3271
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,430
force everyone who disagrees to sort of
go along by default

3272
00:51:59,430 --> 00:51:59,440
go along by default
 

3273
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:03,030
go along by default
um but or they have this um

3274
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:03,040
um but or they have this um
 

3275
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:06,710
um but or they have this um
opinion that um there's like

3276
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:06,720
opinion that um there's like
 

3277
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,589
opinion that um there's like
it's more difficult to abuse soft forks

3278
00:52:09,589 --> 00:52:09,599
it's more difficult to abuse soft forks
 

3279
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,270
it's more difficult to abuse soft forks
to do really mean things like or

3280
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:11,280
to do really mean things like or
 

3281
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,790
to do really mean things like or
that like completely violate people's

3282
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:12,800
that like completely violate people's
 

3283
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,790
that like completely violate people's
expectations like increasing the supply

3284
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:14,800
expectations like increasing the supply
 

3285
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,630
expectations like increasing the supply
which is again there i think there is

3286
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:16,640
which is again there i think there is
 

3287
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,790
which is again there i think there is
some truth to that um

3288
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:18,800
some truth to that um
 

3289
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,470
some truth to that um
so because of you know these reasons

3290
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:20,480
so because of you know these reasons
 

3291
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:21,829
so because of you know these reasons
they just say we're only going to do

3292
00:52:21,829 --> 00:52:21,839
they just say we're only going to do
 

3293
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:22,950
they just say we're only going to do
soft forks and we

3294
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:22,960
soft forks and we
 

3295
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,549
soft forks and we
don't we wants to just not do any hard

3296
00:52:24,549 --> 00:52:24,559
don't we wants to just not do any hard
 

3297
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:26,069
don't we wants to just not do any hard
forks and

3298
00:52:26,069 --> 00:52:26,079
forks and
 

3299
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:27,750
forks and
they eventually discovered this idea

3300
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:27,760
they eventually discovered this idea
 

3301
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,349
they eventually discovered this idea
called segregated witness that allows

3302
00:52:29,349 --> 00:52:29,359
called segregated witness that allows
 

3303
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:30,710
called segregated witness that allows
for like a very tiny

3304
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:30,720
for like a very tiny
 

3305
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,309
for like a very tiny
block size increase to like the

3306
00:52:32,309 --> 00:52:32,319
block size increase to like the
 

3307
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:34,230
block size increase to like the
equivalent of about two megabytes

3308
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:34,240
equivalent of about two megabytes
 

3309
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,430
equivalent of about two megabytes
um with a soft fork it's it's just a

3310
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:37,440
um with a soft fork it's it's just a
 

3311
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,150
um with a soft fork it's it's just a
really

3312
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:38,160
really
 

3313
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:41,990
really
like weird and devious trick like

3314
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:42,000
like weird and devious trick like
 

3315
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,670
like weird and devious trick like
basically what they do is

3316
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:43,680
basically what they do is
 

3317
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:46,150
basically what they do is
they take the signatures of transactions

3318
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:46,160
they take the signatures of transactions
 

3319
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,589
they take the signatures of transactions
and then they put them outside of the

3320
00:52:47,589 --> 00:52:47,599
and then they put them outside of the
 

3321
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:48,150
and then they put them outside of the
block

3322
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:48,160
block
 

3323
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,910
block
and then they add an extra rule that

3324
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:49,920
and then they add an extra rule that
 

3325
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,910
and then they add an extra rule that
says that like every for a block to be

3326
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:51,920
says that like every for a block to be
 

3327
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,589
says that like every for a block to be
valid the blog has to come with

3328
00:52:53,589 --> 00:52:53,599
valid the blog has to come with
 

3329
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:55,349
valid the blog has to come with
a separate like basically extension

3330
00:52:55,349 --> 00:52:55,359
a separate like basically extension
 

3331
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:56,870
a separate like basically extension
block that contains all of the

3332
00:52:56,870 --> 00:52:56,880
block that contains all of the
 

3333
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,230
block that contains all of the
transaction signatures

3334
00:52:58,230 --> 00:52:58,240
transaction signatures
 

3335
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,990
transaction signatures
right so you know when you measure it

3336
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:00,000
right so you know when you measure it
 

3337
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,430
right so you know when you measure it
according to the old rules like you know

3338
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:01,440
according to the old rules like you know
 

3339
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,710
according to the old rules like you know
hey it adds up to less than a million

3340
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:02,720
hey it adds up to less than a million
 

3341
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,069
hey it adds up to less than a million
but actually there's this extension

3342
00:53:04,069 --> 00:53:04,079
but actually there's this extension
 

3343
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:04,870
but actually there's this extension
block that

3344
00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:04,880
block that
 

3345
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,950
block that
the old protocol doesn't even know about

3346
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:06,960
the old protocol doesn't even know about
 

3347
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,190
the old protocol doesn't even know about
so it's a hack that that seemed to work

3348
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:09,200
so it's a hack that that seemed to work
 

3349
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:09,829
so it's a hack that that seemed to work
to do

3350
00:53:09,829 --> 00:53:09,839
to do
 

3351
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:12,870
to do
in a small way extend exactly but so

3352
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:12,880
in a small way extend exactly but so
 

3353
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,470
in a small way extend exactly but so
you know small block side was like happy

3354
00:53:14,470 --> 00:53:14,480
you know small block side was like happy
 

3355
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,990
you know small block side was like happy
with these very low levels of block size

3356
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:16,000
with these very low levels of block size
 

3357
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,990
with these very low levels of block size
and the big block side wanted to

3358
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:18,000
and the big block side wanted to
 

3359
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,150
and the big block side wanted to
expand to you know at the very least go

3360
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:20,160
expand to you know at the very least go
 

3361
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,910
expand to you know at the very least go
to four megabytes then you know maybe go

3362
00:53:21,910 --> 00:53:21,920
to four megabytes then you know maybe go
 

3363
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,750
to four megabytes then you know maybe go
maybe eight twenty there are there's

3364
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:23,760
maybe eight twenty there are there's
 

3365
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,750
maybe eight twenty there are there's
disagreements within there as well

3366
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:25,760
disagreements within there as well
 

3367
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,950
disagreements within there as well
um i definitely was uh favoring the big

3368
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:28,960
um i definitely was uh favoring the big
 

3369
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:29,910
um i definitely was uh favoring the big
side um

3370
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:29,920
side um
 

3371
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,990
side um
the whole way through as you can

3372
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:32,000
the whole way through as you can
 

3373
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:32,950
the whole way through as you can
probably tell

3374
00:53:32,950 --> 00:53:32,960
probably tell
 

3375
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,270
probably tell
um but even though so the argument

3376
00:53:35,270 --> 00:53:35,280
um but even though so the argument
 

3377
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,950
um but even though so the argument
against the big

3378
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:36,960
against the big
 

3379
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,150
against the big
is that uh it uh makes things more

3380
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:40,160
is that uh it uh makes things more
 

3381
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:40,870
is that uh it uh makes things more
centralized

3382
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:40,880
centralized
 

3383
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,790
centralized
yes because fewer people can run and

3384
00:53:42,790 --> 00:53:42,800
yes because fewer people can run and
 

3385
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,150
yes because fewer people can run and
know that verifies the chain

3386
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:44,160
know that verifies the chain
 

3387
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,069
know that verifies the chain
and also because any of these things

3388
00:53:46,069 --> 00:53:46,079
and also because any of these things
 

3389
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:47,670
and also because any of these things
would require a hard fork and

3390
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:47,680
would require a hard fork and
 

3391
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,190
would require a hard fork and
you know hard forks or inherently risky

3392
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:49,200
you know hard forks or inherently risky
 

3393
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,950
you know hard forks or inherently risky
do you think there's truth to that

3394
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:50,960
do you think there's truth to that
 

3395
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,670
do you think there's truth to that
um i'm pro hard fork i think hard forks

3396
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:53,680
um i'm pro hard fork i think hard forks
 

3397
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:54,630
um i'm pro hard fork i think hard forks
are actually like

3398
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:54,640
are actually like
 

3399

in a yeah you know political economic
sense they're better than soft forks

3402
00:53:59,190 --> 00:53:59,200
sense they're better than soft forks
 

3403
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,349
sense they're better than soft forks
well let's okay okay i think it's a

00:54:01,349 --> 00:54:01,359
well let's okay okay i think it's a

well let's okay okay i think it's a
beautiful

forks may be more coarse coercive than
 

3411
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,630
forks may be more coarse coercive than
hard forks

3412
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:10,640
hard forks
 

3413
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,150
hard forks
this this is not just about

3414
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:12,160
this this is not just about
 

3415
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,309
this this is not just about
cryptocurrency this is about

politics and life that's fascinating so
 

3419
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,950
politics and life that's fascinating so
you're okay with hard forks in fact you

3420
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:20,960
you're okay with hard forks in fact you
 

3421
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,470
you're okay with hard forks in fact you
think hard forks

3422
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:22,480
think hard forks
 

3423
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,790
think hard forks
is the right way to make changes because

3424
00:54:24,790 --> 00:54:24,800
is the right way to make changes because
 

3425
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,630
is the right way to make changes because
then everybody's forced to make a

3426
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:26,640
then everybody's forced to make a
 

3427
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:27,430
then everybody's forced to make a
decision

3428
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:27,440
decision
 

3429
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:28,950
decision
right do you accept this change or not

3430
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:28,960
right do you accept this change or not
 

3431
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,510
right do you accept this change or not
as opposed to ideas being sneaked

3432
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:31,520
as opposed to ideas being sneaked
 

3433
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,430
as opposed to ideas being sneaked
in behind the door and you're and the

3434
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:33,440
in behind the door and you're and the
 

3435
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,790
in behind the door and you're and the
decisions forced on you

3436
00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:34,800
decisions forced on you
 

3437
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:38,230
decisions forced on you
exactly yeah okay so but you know

3438
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:38,240
exactly yeah okay so but you know
 

3439
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,069
exactly yeah okay so but you know
hard fork some people say this is when

3440
00:54:40,069 --> 00:54:40,079
hard fork some people say this is when
 

3441
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:42,150
hard fork some people say this is when
they talk about sort of ethereum

3442
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:42,160
they talk about sort of ethereum
 

3443
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,069
they talk about sort of ethereum
is there's some aspect to a hard fork

3444
00:54:44,069 --> 00:54:44,079
is there's some aspect to a hard fork
 

3445
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:45,829
is there's some aspect to a hard fork
where you're trying to

3446
00:54:45,829 --> 00:54:45,839
where you're trying to
 

3447
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:48,150
where you're trying to
upgrade a what is it airplane while it's

3448
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:48,160
upgrade a what is it airplane while it's
 

3449
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,430
upgrade a what is it airplane while it's
flying

3450
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:49,440
flying
 

3451
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,910
flying
and uh i think softworks are also

3452
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:51,920
and uh i think softworks are also
 

3453
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,430
and uh i think softworks are also
upgrading an airplane while it's flying

3454
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:53,440
upgrading an airplane while it's flying
 

3455
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,069
upgrading an airplane while it's flying
but it's just smaller upgrades

3456
00:54:56,069 --> 00:54:56,079
but it's just smaller upgrades
 

3457
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:58,549
but it's just smaller upgrades
that's like there's some truth to that

3458
00:54:58,549 --> 00:54:58,559
that's like there's some truth to that
 

3459
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,109
that's like there's some truth to that
like

3460
00:54:59,109 --> 00:54:59,119
like
 

3461
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:01,589
like
there's definitely um there's definitely

3462
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:01,599
there's definitely um there's definitely
 

3463
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:04,069
there's definitely um there's definitely
a bit more risk of like a split as a

3464
00:55:04,069 --> 00:55:04,079
a bit more risk of like a split as a
 

3465
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:05,589
a bit more risk of like a split as a
result of a hard fork then as a result

3466
00:55:05,589 --> 00:55:05,599
result of a hard fork then as a result
 

3467
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:05,990
result of a hard fork then as a result
of a soft

3468
00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:06,000
of a soft
 

3469
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,109
of a soft
fork um and this split is highly

3470
00:55:09,109 --> 00:55:09,119
fork um and this split is highly
 

3471
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:10,470
fork um and this split is highly
undesirable right

3472
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:10,480
undesirable right
 

3473
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,309
undesirable right
well it depends like if it's a split

3474
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:12,319
well it depends like if it's a split
 

3475
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:14,069
well it depends like if it's a split
because of a bug then that's horrible

3476
00:55:14,069 --> 00:55:14,079
because of a bug then that's horrible
 

3477
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:15,990
because of a bug then that's horrible
if it's a split as a result of political

3478
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:16,000
if it's a split as a result of political
 

3479
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,670
if it's a split as a result of political
differences then i think like

3480
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:17,680
differences then i think like
 

3481
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:20,390
differences then i think like
a split is better than you know one side

3482
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:20,400
a split is better than you know one side
 

3483
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,470
a split is better than you know one side
being forced to basically just like suck

3484
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:22,480
being forced to basically just like suck
 

3485
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:23,349
being forced to basically just like suck
it up and

3486
00:55:23,349 --> 00:55:23,359
it up and
 

3487
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:24,950
it up and
accept the majority position even if it

3488
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:24,960
accept the majority position even if it
 

3489
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,109
accept the majority position even if it
really hates it

3490
00:55:27,109 --> 00:55:27,119
really hates it
 

3491
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:28,710
really hates it
well there's also political connections

3492
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:28,720
well there's also political connections
 

3493
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:29,990
well there's also political connections
throughout the history of the united

3494
00:55:29,990 --> 00:55:30,000
throughout the history of the united
 

3495
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,309
throughout the history of the united
states it's like sometimes

3496
00:55:32,309 --> 00:55:32,319
states it's like sometimes
 

3497
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:34,390
states it's like sometimes
groups of people that strongly disagree

3498
00:55:34,390 --> 00:55:34,400
groups of people that strongly disagree
 

3499
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,670
groups of people that strongly disagree
with each other

3500
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:35,680
with each other
 

3501
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:38,710
with each other
should be forced to work it out

3502
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:38,720
should be forced to work it out
 

3503
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,710
should be forced to work it out
even if they even when a split seems

3504
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:40,720
even if they even when a split seems
 

3505
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,630
even if they even when a split seems
like an easy thing in the short term

3506
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:42,640
like an easy thing in the short term
 

3507
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,710
like an easy thing in the short term
it depends and i think like well for

3508
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:44,720
it depends and i think like well for
 

3509
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:47,670
it depends and i think like well for
blockchains in particular the costs of

3510
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:47,680
blockchains in particular the costs of
 

3511
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,430
blockchains in particular the costs of
people being able to like peacefully do

3512
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:49,440
people being able to like peacefully do
 

3513
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,349
people being able to like peacefully do
their go off and do their own thing or

3514
00:55:51,349 --> 00:55:51,359
their go off and do their own thing or
 

3515
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:52,710
their go off and do their own thing or
much lower right like

3516
00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:52,720
much lower right like
 

3517
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,230
much lower right like
you know okay if you have a country and

3518
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:54,240
you know okay if you have a country and
 

3519
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,870
you know okay if you have a country and
you have two groups then

3520
00:55:56,870 --> 00:55:56,880
you have two groups then
 

3521
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,589
you have two groups then
like often enough like fighting out the

3522
00:55:59,589 --> 00:55:59,599
like often enough like fighting out the
 

3523
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:00,789
like often enough like fighting out the
new rules requires

3524
00:56:00,789 --> 00:56:00,799
new rules requires
 

3525
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:01,990
new rules requires
you know a civil war it requires

3526
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:02,000
you know a civil war it requires
 

3527
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,510
you know a civil war it requires
everyone to move and so forth but no no

3528
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:03,520
everyone to move and so forth but no no
 

3529
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:04,950
everyone to move and so forth but no no
on a blockchain like you know

3530
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:04,960
on a blockchain like you know
 

3531
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,910
on a blockchain like you know
the costs are lower and so so if you

3532
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:07,920
the costs are lower and so so if you
 

3533
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,589
the costs are lower and so so if you
were to look at the way things worked

3534
00:56:09,589 --> 00:56:09,599
were to look at the way things worked
 

3535
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,589
were to look at the way things worked
out with the block size wars

3536
00:56:11,589 --> 00:56:11,599
out with the block size wars
 

3537
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:14,150
out with the block size wars
and there was a split what is the

3538
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:14,160
and there was a split what is the
 

3539
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,150
and there was a split what is the
bitcoin cash and bitcoin

3540
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:16,160
bitcoin cash and bitcoin
 

3541
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:19,349
bitcoin cash and bitcoin
yeah um would you like you

3542
00:56:19,349 --> 00:56:19,359
yeah um would you like you
 

3543
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:21,510
yeah um would you like you
looking putting on your historian hat

3544
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:21,520
looking putting on your historian hat
 

3545
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:22,950
looking putting on your historian hat
you mentioned offline you like dan

3546
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:22,960
you mentioned offline you like dan
 

3547
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:23,910
you mentioned offline you like dan
carlin

3548
00:56:23,910 --> 00:56:23,920
carlin
 

3549
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,390
carlin
so if dan carlin went to do an episode

3550
00:56:26,390 --> 00:56:26,400
so if dan carlin went to do an episode
 

3551
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,910
so if dan carlin went to do an episode
on the

3552
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:27,920
on the
 

3553
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,270
on the
on the block size wars uh do you think

3554
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:31,280
on the block size wars uh do you think
 

3555
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,109
on the block size wars uh do you think
uh it could have turned out better or do

3556
00:56:33,109 --> 00:56:33,119
uh it could have turned out better or do
 

3557
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:33,430
uh it could have turned out better or do
you

3558
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:33,440
you
 

3559

that
 

3805
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:26,549
that
but that extra part about where he

3806
01:00:26,549 --> 01:00:26,559
but that extra part about where he
 

3807

3809
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:32,309

i think that's um he could have done it

3810
01:00:32,309 --> 01:00:32,319
i think that's um he could have done it
 

3811
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:34,069
i think that's um he could have done it
without that but that

3812
01:00:34,069 --> 01:00:34,079
without that but that
 

3813
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:36,150
without that but that
i mean that just it's a marketing

3814
01:00:36,150 --> 01:00:36,160
i mean that just it's a marketing
 

3815

3817
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:38,789
strategy like it sort of gives him more
salience like

3818
01:00:38,789 --> 01:00:38,799
salience like
 

3819
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:40,470

there's other big block personalities
 

3821
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:41,990
there's other big block personalities
right but what's the difference between

3822
01:00:41,990 --> 01:00:42,000
right but what's the difference between
 

3823
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,630
right but what's the difference between
with greg wright he's not just a big a

with greg wright he's not just a big a
 

3825
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,870
with greg wright he's not just a big a
big block personality he's

3829
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,230
potentially satoshi um and he did say
all the big block things right like he

3830
01:00:52,230 --> 01:00:52,240
all the big block things right like he
 

3831
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,710
all the big block things right like he
talked about how oh the concept of a fee

3832
01:00:54,710 --> 01:00:54,720
talked about how oh the concept of a fee
 

3833
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:55,990
talked about how oh the concept of a fee
market is fundamentally

3834
01:00:55,990 --> 01:00:56,000

like economically wrong and it should be

3836
01:00:58,789 --> 01:00:58,799
like economically wrong and it should be
 

3837
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:00,230
like economically wrong and it should be
it should be a free market and you

3838
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:00,240
it should be a free market and you
 

3839
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,589
it should be a free market and you
should be able to have walks as big as

3840
01:01:01,589 --> 01:01:01,599
should be able to have walks as big as
 

3841
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:02,789
should be able to have walks as big as
you want like he repeated all the

3842
01:01:02,789 --> 01:01:02,799
you want like he repeated all the
 

3843
01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:04,390
you want like he repeated all the
talking points and so

3844
01:01:04,390 --> 01:01:04,400
talking points and so
 

3845
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,470
talking points and so
a lot of people were kind of sucked into

3846
01:01:06,470 --> 01:01:06,480
a lot of people were kind of sucked into
 

3847
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:07,589
a lot of people were kind of sucked into
that right

3848
01:01:07,589 --> 01:01:07,599
that right
 

3849
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:10,950
that right
and so he unfortunately was able to

3850
01:01:10,950 --> 01:01:10,960
and so he unfortunately was able to
 

3851
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:12,230
and so he unfortunately was able to
basically dominate

3852
01:01:12,230 --> 01:01:12,240
basically dominate
 

3853
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,990
basically dominate
a big part of the bitcoin cash community

3854
01:01:13,990 --> 01:01:14,000
a big part of the bitcoin cash community
 

3855
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,390
a big part of the bitcoin cash community
for a long time and then

3856
01:01:16,390 --> 01:01:16,400
for a long time and then
 

3857
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,630
for a long time and then
eventually if of course um you know more

3858
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:18,640
eventually if of course um you know more
 

3859
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:20,630
eventually if of course um you know more
and more people started to catch on

3860
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:20,640
and more people started to catch on
 

3861
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,470
and more people started to catch on
um he would just say technical things

3862
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:22,480
um he would just say technical things
 

3863
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,069
um he would just say technical things
that are completely wrong right

3864
01:01:24,069 --> 01:01:24,079
that are completely wrong right
 

3865
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:27,109
that are completely wrong right
like one example of this that i

3866
01:01:27,109 --> 01:01:27,119
like one example of this that i
 

3867
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:30,309
like one example of this that i
remember is that he mixed up

3868
01:01:30,309 --> 01:01:30,319
remember is that he mixed up
 

3869
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:33,589
remember is that he mixed up
the concept of 256 bits and 2 to the

3870
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:33,599
the concept of 256 bits and 2 to the
 

3871
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:35,670
the concept of 256 bits and 2 to the
power of 256 bits

3872
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:35,680
power of 256 bits
 

3873
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,829
power of 256 bits
right um so you know the difference is

3874
01:01:37,829 --> 01:01:37,839
right um so you know the difference is
 

3875
01:01:37,839 --> 01:01:39,109
right um so you know the difference is
it's like the difference between you

3876
01:01:39,109 --> 01:01:39,119
it's like the difference between you
 

3877
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:41,109
it's like the difference between you
know 80 and the concept of 80 digit

3878
01:01:41,109 --> 01:01:41,119
know 80 and the concept of 80 digit
 

3879

know 80 and the concept of 80 digit
numbers

3880
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:41,680
numbers
 

3881
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:44,710
numbers
right um and because of this like he

3882
01:01:44,710 --> 01:01:44,720
right um and because of this like he
 

3883
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:47,430
right um and because of this like he
made this made this argument that said

3884
01:01:47,430 --> 01:01:47,440
made this made this argument that said
 

3885
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,150
made this made this argument that said
that

3886
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:48,160
that
 

3887
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:50,630
that
bitcoin that bitcoin's elliptic curve is

you don't have to

3892
01:01:53,349 --> 01:01:53,359
you don't have to
 

3893

um but basically he made this like
 

3901
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,630
um but basically he made this like
technical argument that really hedged on

3902
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:02,640
technical argument that really hedged on
 

3903
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:03,990
technical argument that really hedged on
this point and then when people when

3904
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:04,000
this point and then when people when
 

3905
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,670
this point and then when people when
people pressed him on it's like

4045
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:22,150

okay so that's the level

4046
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:22,160
okay so that's the level
 

4047
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:25,589
okay so that's the level
that's the layer one uh approach

4048
01:04:25,589 --> 01:04:25,599
that's the layer one uh approach
 

4049
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:27,990
that's the layer one uh approach
the other layer one within the ethereum

4050
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:28,000
the other layer one within the ethereum
 

4051
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,829
the other layer one within the ethereum
is the idea of sharding yes

4052
01:04:29,829 --> 01:04:29,839
is the idea of sharding yes
 

4053
01:04:29,839 --> 01:04:32,390
is the idea of sharding yes
what the heck is sharding okay what does

4054
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:32,400
what the heck is sharding okay what does
 

4055
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,069
what the heck is sharding okay what does
the future of shining look like right so

4056
01:04:34,069 --> 01:04:34,079
the future of shining look like right so
 

4057
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:35,430
the future of shining look like right so
to summarize that big

4058
01:04:35,430 --> 01:04:35,440
to summarize that big

to summarize that big
long tangent that we just uh once it's a

4060
01:04:37,349 --> 01:04:37,359
long tangent that we just uh once it's a
 

4061
01:04:37,359 --> 01:04:38,870
long tangent that we just uh once it's a
beautiful tangent button

4062
01:04:38,870 --> 01:04:38,880
beautiful tangent button
 

4063
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:41,510
beautiful tangent button
it's tangent and i think like crypto is

4064
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:41,520
it's tangent and i think like crypto is
 

4065
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:42,069
it's tangent and i think like crypto is
just

4066
01:04:42,069 --> 01:04:42,079
just
 

4067
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:44,150
just
uh one of the most underrated aspects of

4068
01:04:44,150 --> 01:04:44,160
uh one of the most underrated aspects of
 

4069
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,069
uh one of the most underrated aspects of
crypto is i think how you can

4070
01:04:46,069 --> 01:04:46,079
crypto is i think how you can
 

4071
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:48,150
crypto is i think how you can
like analyze the you know the sociology

4072
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:48,160
like analyze the you know the sociology
 

4073
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,910
like analyze the you know the sociology
and the politics and the anthropology

4074
01:04:49,910 --> 01:04:49,920
and the politics and the anthropology
 

4075
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:50,150
and the politics and the anthropology
and

4076
01:04:50,150 --> 01:04:50,160
and
 

4077
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,150
and
yeah and i'm sure dan carl would have

4078
01:04:52,150 --> 01:04:52,160
yeah and i'm sure dan carl would have
 

4079
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:53,990
yeah and i'm sure dan carl would have
fun exploring the space at some point

4080
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:54,000
fun exploring the space at some point
 

4081
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,150
fun exploring the space at some point
but like the core trade-off right is

4082
01:04:56,150 --> 01:04:56,160
but like the core trade-off right is
 

4083
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:57,910
but like the core trade-off right is
that if you scale blockchains the dumb

4084
01:04:57,910 --> 01:04:57,920
that if you scale blockchains the dumb
 

4085
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:59,829
that if you scale blockchains the dumb
way just by increasing the parameters

4086
01:04:59,829 --> 01:04:59,839
way just by increasing the parameters
 

4087
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:01,349
way just by increasing the parameters
then eventually you just make it harder

4088
01:05:01,349 --> 01:05:01,359
then eventually you just make it harder
 

4089
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:03,109
then eventually you just make it harder
and harder to participate as a node and

4090
01:05:03,109 --> 01:05:03,119
and harder to participate as a node and
 

4091
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:03,910
and harder to participate as a node and
you

4092
01:05:03,910 --> 01:05:03,920
you
 

4093
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,670
you
end up with a system where there's like

4094
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:05,680
end up with a system where there's like
 

4095
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:07,829
end up with a system where there's like
20 computers running the whole thing

4096
01:05:07,829 --> 01:05:07,839
20 computers running the whole thing
 

4097
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:09,750
20 computers running the whole thing
and it's just very centralized um so

4098
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:09,760
and it's just very centralized um so
 

4099
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:11,670
and it's just very centralized um so
shorting basically says well

4100
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:11,680
shorting basically says well
 

4101
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:13,029
shorting basically says well
instead of just increasing the

4102
01:05:13,029 --> 01:05:13,039
instead of just increasing the
 

4103
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:14,470
instead of just increasing the
parameters what we're going to do is

4104
01:05:14,470 --> 01:05:14,480
parameters what we're going to do is
 

4105
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,230
parameters what we're going to do is
we're going to change the blockchain

4106
01:05:16,230 --> 01:05:16,240
we're going to change the blockchain
 

4107
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:17,349
we're going to change the blockchain
architecture

4108
01:05:17,349 --> 01:05:17,359
architecture
 

4109
01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:20,630
architecture
in such a way that each

4110
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:20,640
in such a way that each
 

4111
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:22,950
in such a way that each
individual node in the blockchain only

4112
01:05:22,950 --> 01:05:22,960
individual node in the blockchain only
 

4113
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:23,910
individual node in the blockchain only
needs to store

4114
01:05:23,910 --> 01:05:23,920
needs to store
 

4115
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,829
needs to store
a small portion of the data and only

4116
01:05:25,829 --> 01:05:25,839
a small portion of the data and only
 

4117
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:27,430
a small portion of the data and only
needs to process a small portion of the

4118
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:27,440
needs to process a small portion of the
 

4119
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:28,710
needs to process a small portion of the
transactions

4120
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:28,720
transactions
 

4121
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:30,150
transactions
so you can think about it as being like

4122
01:05:30,150 --> 01:05:30,160
so you can think about it as being like
 

4123
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:31,670
so you can think about it as being like
inspired by bitsword right like on

4124
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:31,680
inspired by bitsword right like on
 

4125
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,430
inspired by bitsword right like on
bittorrent there's no such thing as a

4126
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:33,440
bittorrent there's no such thing as a
 

4127
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:34,950
bittorrent there's no such thing as a
bittorrent full node that has every

4128
01:05:34,950 --> 01:05:34,960
bittorrent full node that has every
 

4129
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:35,430
bittorrent full node that has every
movie

4130
01:05:35,430 --> 01:05:35,440
movie
 

4131
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:37,510
movie
right you know the work is like split up

4132
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:37,520
right you know the work is like split up
 

4133
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:39,589
right you know the work is like split up
among a huge number of computers and

4134
01:05:39,589 --> 01:05:39,599
among a huge number of computers and
 

4135
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:41,430
among a huge number of computers and
like that makes sense that's uh you know

4136
01:05:41,430 --> 01:05:41,440
like that makes sense that's uh you know
 

4137
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,270
like that makes sense that's uh you know
the only sane way to scale a system like

4138
01:05:43,270 --> 01:05:43,280
the only sane way to scale a system like
 

4139
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:43,990
the only sane way to scale a system like
that

4140
01:05:43,990 --> 01:05:44,000
that
 

4141
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,789
that
um and if they actually tried making a

4142
01:05:46,789 --> 01:05:46,799
um and if they actually tried making a
 

4143
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:48,390
um and if they actually tried making a
version bit of bits or that required

4144
01:05:48,390 --> 01:05:48,400
version bit of bits or that required
 

4145
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:49,109
version bit of bits or that required
full nodes

4146
01:05:49,109 --> 01:05:49,119
full nodes
 

4147
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:51,270
full nodes
that store every movie then you know it

4148
01:05:51,270 --> 01:05:51,280
that store every movie then you know it
 

4149
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,630
that store every movie then you know it
would have like zero censorship

4150
01:05:52,630 --> 01:05:52,640
would have like zero censorship
 

4151
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:54,150
would have like zero censorship
resistance and it would just like

4152
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:54,160
resistance and it would just like
 

4153
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:57,430
resistance and it would just like
you know be dead in an instant uh so

4154
01:05:57,430 --> 01:05:57,440
you know be dead in an instant uh so
 

4155
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:59,510
you know be dead in an instant uh so
the challenge with taking that model and

4156
01:05:59,510 --> 01:05:59,520
the challenge with taking that model and
 

4157
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,670
the challenge with taking that model and
applying it to blockchains right is that

4158
01:06:01,670 --> 01:06:01,680
applying it to blockchains right is that
 

4159
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,349
applying it to blockchains right is that
blockchains aren't just about like

4160
01:06:03,349 --> 01:06:03,359
blockchains aren't just about like
 

4161
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:05,829
blockchains aren't just about like
spreading data around they're about

4162
01:06:05,829 --> 01:06:05,839
spreading data around they're about
 

4163
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:08,150
spreading data around they're about
agreeing on exactly what data was spread

4164
01:06:08,150 --> 01:06:08,160
agreeing on exactly what data was spread
 

4165
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:09,910
agreeing on exactly what data was spread
around and ensuring that

4166
01:06:09,910 --> 01:06:09,920
around and ensuring that
 

4167
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:11,670
around and ensuring that
everything that you agree on actually is

4168
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:11,680
everything that you agree on actually is
 

4169
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,750
everything that you agree on actually is
correct and so you have this paradox

4170
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:13,760
correct and so you have this paradox
 

4171
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:14,309
correct and so you have this paradox
where

4172
01:06:14,309 --> 01:06:14,319
where
 

4173
01:06:14,319 --> 01:06:16,069
where
let's say you want to have a system that

4174
01:06:16,069 --> 01:06:16,079
let's say you want to have a system that
 

4175
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:17,430
let's say you want to have a system that
supports

4176
01:06:17,430 --> 01:06:17,440
supports
 

4177
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,589
supports
10 000 transactions a second but each

4178
01:06:19,589 --> 01:06:19,599
10 000 transactions a second but each
 

4179
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:21,109
10 000 transactions a second but each
computer in the network can only

4180
01:06:21,109 --> 01:06:21,119
computer in the network can only
 

4181
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:23,190
computer in the network can only
personally verify

4182
01:06:23,190 --> 01:06:23,200
personally verify
 

4183
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,910
personally verify
100 transactions a second so how can

4184
01:06:25,910 --> 01:06:25,920
100 transactions a second so how can
 

4185
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:27,670
100 transactions a second so how can
each computer

4186
01:06:27,670 --> 01:06:27,680
each computer
 

4187
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:30,630
each computer
get a guarantee about the other 900

4188
01:06:30,630 --> 01:06:30,640
get a guarantee about the other 900
 

4189
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:32,230
get a guarantee about the other 900
without actually going and verifying

4190
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:32,240
without actually going and verifying
 

4191
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:33,670
without actually going and verifying
them themselves yep

4192
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:33,680
them themselves yep
 

4193
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:37,270
them themselves yep
and it turns out that there are some um

4194
01:06:37,270 --> 01:06:37,280
and it turns out that there are some um
 

4195
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:39,029
and it turns out that there are some um
like a bundle of different tricks that

4196
01:06:39,029 --> 01:06:39,039
like a bundle of different tricks that
 

4197
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:41,510
like a bundle of different tricks that
can do that right so like one of them is

4198
01:06:41,510 --> 01:06:41,520
can do that right so like one of them is
 

4199
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,589
can do that right so like one of them is
uh just random sampling

4200
01:06:43,589 --> 01:06:43,599
uh just random sampling
 

4201
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:45,829
uh just random sampling
so the idea behind random sampling is

4202
01:06:45,829 --> 01:06:45,839
so the idea behind random sampling is
 

4203
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:46,789
so the idea behind random sampling is
like let's

4204
01:06:46,789 --> 01:06:46,799
like let's
 

4205
01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:48,549
like let's
say for simplicity this is a proof of

4206
01:06:48,549 --> 01:06:48,559
say for simplicity this is a proof of
 

4207
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:49,990
say for simplicity this is a proof of
stake chain and

4208
01:06:49,990 --> 01:06:50,000
stake chain and
 

4209
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,789
stake chain and
you have 10 000 validators validators

4210
01:06:52,789 --> 01:06:52,799
you have 10 000 validators validators
 

4211
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:53,190
you have 10 000 validators validators
like

4212
01:06:53,190 --> 01:06:53,200
like
 

4213
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,349
like
you know the stakers and like for

4214
01:06:55,349 --> 01:06:55,359
you know the stakers and like for
 

4215
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:56,710
you know the stakers and like for
simplicity we'll assume they all have

4216
01:06:56,710 --> 01:06:56,720
simplicity we'll assume they all have
 

4217
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:57,829
simplicity we'll assume they all have
the same number of coins right if

4218
01:06:57,829 --> 01:06:57,839
the same number of coins right if
 

4219
01:06:57,839 --> 01:06:59,190
the same number of coins right if
someone has more coins we'll just kind

4220
01:06:59,190 --> 01:06:59,200
someone has more coins we'll just kind
 

4221
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,390
someone has more coins we'll just kind
of split them up and pretends they're

4222
01:07:00,390 --> 01:07:00,400
of split them up and pretends they're
 

4223
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:01,589
of split them up and pretends they're
tense takers

4224
01:07:01,589 --> 01:07:01,599
tense takers
 

4225
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:05,190
tense takers
then you you you do like some random

4226
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:05,200
then you you you do like some random
 

4227
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,710
then you you you do like some random
shuffling and you basically say

4228
01:07:06,710 --> 01:07:06,720
shuffling and you basically say
 

4229
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,309
shuffling and you basically say
these random hundred validators are

4230
01:07:08,309 --> 01:07:08,319
these random hundred validators are
 

4231
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:09,910
these random hundred validators are
assigned to validate this

4232
01:07:09,910 --> 01:07:09,920
assigned to validate this
 

4233
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,829
assigned to validate this
block these random hundred validators

4234
01:07:11,829 --> 01:07:11,839
block these random hundred validators
 

4235
01:07:11,839 --> 01:07:12,950
block these random hundred validators
are assigned to validate this block

4236
01:07:12,950 --> 01:07:12,960
are assigned to validate this block
 

4237
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:14,309
are assigned to validate this block
these random hundred validators are

4238
01:07:14,309 --> 01:07:14,319
these random hundred validators are
 

4239
01:07:14,319 --> 01:07:15,990
these random hundred validators are
assigned to validate this block

4240
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:16,000
assigned to validate this block
 

4241
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,789
assigned to validate this block
and so each individual computer only

4242
01:07:18,789 --> 01:07:18,799
and so each individual computer only
 

4243
01:07:18,799 --> 01:07:20,630
and so each individual computer only
gets assigned to validate like a small

4244
01:07:20,630 --> 01:07:20,640
gets assigned to validate like a small
 

4245
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:21,270
gets assigned to validate like a small
piece

4246
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:21,280
piece
 

4247
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:23,430
piece
but then the way that the information

4248
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:23,440
but then the way that the information
 

4249
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:24,870
but then the way that the information
about like what's evaluated gets passed

4250
01:07:24,870 --> 01:07:24,880
about like what's evaluated gets passed
 

4251
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,710
about like what's evaluated gets passed
around right is that when

4252
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:26,720
around right is that when
 

4253
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:29,670
around right is that when
these hundred participants validate a

4254
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:29,680
these hundred participants validate a
 

4255
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:30,470
these hundred participants validate a
block

4256
01:07:30,470 --> 01:07:30,480
block
 

4257
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,789
block
they all sign a message basically saying

4258
01:07:32,789 --> 01:07:32,799
they all sign a message basically saying
 

4259
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:33,510
they all sign a message basically saying
like yes

4260
01:07:33,510 --> 01:07:33,520
like yes
 

4261
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,270
like yes
we agree that this block is valid and

4262
01:07:35,270 --> 01:07:35,280
we agree that this block is valid and
 

4263
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:36,789
we agree that this block is valid and
then like they combine that signature

4264
01:07:36,789 --> 01:07:36,799
then like they combine that signature
 

4265
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:37,589
then like they combine that signature
into one

4266
01:07:37,589 --> 01:07:37,599
into one
 

4267
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:39,430
into one
and then they broadcast that signature

4268
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:39,440
and then they broadcast that signature
 

4269
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:40,630
and then they broadcast that signature
and then everyone else

4270
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:40,640
and then everyone else
 

4271
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,309
and then everyone else
instead of verifying the blocks directly

4272
01:07:42,309 --> 01:07:42,319
instead of verifying the blocks directly
 

4273
01:07:42,319 --> 01:07:43,910
instead of verifying the blocks directly
just verifies that signature

4274
01:07:43,910 --> 01:07:43,920
just verifies that signature
 

4275
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:46,309
just verifies that signature
right and so if i see the signature i'm

4276
01:07:46,309 --> 01:07:46,319
right and so if i see the signature i'm
 

4277
01:07:46,319 --> 01:07:48,390
right and so if i see the signature i'm
not directly convinced that that block

4278
01:07:48,390 --> 01:07:48,400
not directly convinced that that block
 

4279
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,390
not directly convinced that that block
is valid but what i am convinced of is

4280
01:07:50,390 --> 01:07:50,400
is valid but what i am convinced of is
 

4281
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,190
is valid but what i am convinced of is
that

4282
01:07:51,190 --> 01:07:51,200
that
 

4283
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,589
that
out of this committee of or this

4284
01:07:53,589 --> 01:07:53,599
out of this committee of or this
 

4285
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:54,950
out of this committee of or this
randomly selected group of 100

4286
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:54,960
randomly selected group of 100
 

4287
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:56,470
randomly selected group of 100
validators let's say

4288
01:07:56,470 --> 01:07:56,480
validators let's say
 

4289
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:58,470
validators let's say
at least 70 of them agree that this

4290
01:07:58,470 --> 01:07:58,480
at least 70 of them agree that this
 

4291
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:01,109
at least 70 of them agree that this
block is valid and so if i trust that

4292
01:08:01,109 --> 01:08:01,119
block is valid and so if i trust that
 

4293
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:02,630
block is valid and so if i trust that
you know the majority of these

4294
01:08:02,630 --> 01:08:02,640
you know the majority of these
 

4295
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,150
you know the majority of these
participants are all honest

4296
01:08:04,150 --> 01:08:04,160
participants are all honest
 

4297
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:06,069
participants are all honest
then because it's all randomly selected

4298
01:08:06,069 --> 01:08:06,079
then because it's all randomly selected
 

4299
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:07,510
then because it's all randomly selected
you know the attacker can't just like

4300
01:08:07,510 --> 01:08:07,520
you know the attacker can't just like
 

4301
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:09,190
you know the attacker can't just like
force themselves into one committee

4302
01:08:09,190 --> 01:08:09,200
force themselves into one committee
 

4303
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,270
force themselves into one committee
and and so you know the attacker is

4304
01:08:11,270 --> 01:08:11,280
and and so you know the attacker is
 

4305
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:12,549
and and so you know the attacker is
going to be even at least

4306
01:08:12,549 --> 01:08:12,559
going to be even at least
 

4307
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:15,670
going to be even at least
evenly spread out too and so if you know

4308
01:08:15,670 --> 01:08:15,680
evenly spread out too and so if you know
 

4309
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:17,349
evenly spread out too and so if you know
the entire set of validators is mostly

4310
01:08:17,349 --> 01:08:17,359
the entire set of validators is mostly
 

4311
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:18,550
the entire set of validators is mostly
honest every committee is going to be

4312
01:08:18,550 --> 01:08:18,560
honest every committee is going to be
 

4313
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:19,990
honest every committee is going to be
mostly honest and so

4314
01:08:19,990 --> 01:08:20,000
mostly honest and so
 

4315
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,349
mostly honest and so
like bad blocks are not going to go

4316
01:08:21,349 --> 01:08:21,359
like bad blocks are not going to go
 

4317
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:23,110
like bad blocks are not going to go
through right so that's like

4318
01:08:23,110 --> 01:08:23,120
through right so that's like
 

4319
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:25,269
through right so that's like
one simple form of sharding there's also

4320
01:08:25,269 --> 01:08:25,279
one simple form of sharding there's also
 

4321
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:26,870
one simple form of sharding there's also
other more clever things that you can do

4322
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:26,880
other more clever things that you can do
 

4323
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:28,789
other more clever things that you can do
so for example there's this concept of

4324
01:08:28,789 --> 01:08:28,799
so for example there's this concept of
 

4325
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:30,550
so for example there's this concept of
zk snarks right now called as your

4326
01:08:30,550 --> 01:08:30,560
zk snarks right now called as your
 

4327
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:32,470
zk snarks right now called as your
knowledge proofs so this is the idea

4328
01:08:32,470 --> 01:08:32,480
knowledge proofs so this is the idea
 

4329
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:34,390
knowledge proofs so this is the idea
that you can make a cryptographic proof

4330
01:08:34,390 --> 01:08:34,400
that you can make a cryptographic proof
 

4331
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:35,510
that you can make a cryptographic proof
that says

4332
01:08:35,510 --> 01:08:35,520
that says
 

4333
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:39,269
that says
i verified or i ran

4334
01:08:39,269 --> 01:08:39,279
i verified or i ran
 

4335
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:41,349
i verified or i ran
some complex computation on this piece

4336
01:08:41,349 --> 01:08:41,359
some complex computation on this piece
 

4337
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:43,269
some complex computation on this piece
of data and i got this answer

4338
01:08:43,269 --> 01:08:43,279
of data and i got this answer
 

4339
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:45,669
of data and i got this answer
and so if you make these kinds of proofs

4340
01:08:45,669 --> 01:08:45,679
and so if you make these kinds of proofs
 

4341
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:47,669
and so if you make these kinds of proofs
then like if you see a zika snark that

4342
01:08:47,669 --> 01:08:47,679
then like if you see a zika snark that
 

4343
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:49,030
then like if you see a zika snark that
says some block is valid

4344
01:08:49,030 --> 01:08:49,040
says some block is valid
 

4345
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:50,789
says some block is valid
then you're convinced that that block is

4346
01:08:50,789 --> 01:08:50,799
then you're convinced that that block is
 

4347
01:08:50,799 --> 01:08:52,630
then you're convinced that that block is
valid and

4348
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:52,640
valid and
 

4349
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,309
valid and
even if you know everyone in that

4350
01:08:54,309 --> 01:08:54,319
even if you know everyone in that
 

4351
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:56,390
even if you know everyone in that
committee is evil like they have no way

4352
01:08:56,390 --> 01:08:56,400
committee is evil like they have no way
 

4353
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,630
committee is evil like they have no way
of making a a valid proof for a bad

4354
01:08:58,630 --> 01:08:58,640
of making a a valid proof for a bad
 

4355
01:08:58,640 --> 01:08:59,189
of making a a valid proof for a bad
block

4356
01:08:59,189 --> 01:08:59,199
block
 

4357
01:08:59,199 --> 01:09:01,110
block
right like because the proof itself like

4358
01:09:01,110 --> 01:09:01,120
right like because the proof itself like
 

4359
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:02,550
right like because the proof itself like
it is a proof that you did the

4360
01:09:02,550 --> 01:09:02,560
it is a proof that you did the
 

4361
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:03,510
it is a proof that you did the
computation

4362
01:09:03,510 --> 01:09:03,520
computation
 

4363
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:05,030

where that proof is much easier to

4364
01:09:05,030 --> 01:09:05,040
where that proof is much easier to
 

4365
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,550
where that proof is much easier to
verify than

4366
01:09:06,550 --> 01:09:06,560
verify than
 

4367
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:08,789
verify than
just running the computation yourself

4368
01:09:08,789 --> 01:09:08,799
just running the computation yourself
 

4369
01:09:08,799 --> 01:09:09,829
just running the computation yourself
and you know

4370
01:09:09,829 --> 01:09:09,839
and you know
 

4371
01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:12,229
and you know
the there's once again you know super

4372
01:09:12,229 --> 01:09:12,239
the there's once again you know super
 

4373
01:09:12,239 --> 01:09:13,590
the there's once again you know super
awesome

4374
01:09:13,590 --> 01:09:13,600
awesome
 

4375
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,749

mathematical cryptographic magic behind
 

4377
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:17,349
mathematical cryptographic magic behind
making zk snarks work

4378
01:09:17,349 --> 01:09:17,359
making zk snarks work
 

4379
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:19,829
making zk snarks work
um so it gives you a little bit of a leg

4380
01:09:19,829 --> 01:09:19,839
um so it gives you a little bit of a leg
 

4381
01:09:19,839 --> 01:09:21,669
um so it gives you a little bit of a leg
up over the 51

4382
01:09:21,669 --> 01:09:21,679
up over the 51
 

4383
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:23,910
up over the 51
honest exact assumption so it's a little

4384
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:23,920
honest exact assumption so it's a little
 

4385
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:25,510
honest exact assumption so it's a little
hack that improves upon the random

4386
01:09:25,510 --> 01:09:25,520
hack that improves upon the random
 

4387
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:26,390
hack that improves upon the random
sampling thing

4388
01:09:26,390 --> 01:09:26,400
sampling thing
 

4389
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,070
sampling thing
exactly and like there's other hacks

4390
01:09:28,070 --> 01:09:28,080
exactly and like there's other hacks
 

4391
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,910
exactly and like there's other hacks
right like there is another hack called

4392
01:09:29,910 --> 01:09:29,920
right like there is another hack called
 

4393
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,669
right like there is another hack called
data availability sampling that allows

4394
01:09:31,669 --> 01:09:31,679
data availability sampling that allows
 

4395
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:32,950
data availability sampling that allows
you to make sure that the data in the

4396
01:09:32,950 --> 01:09:32,960
you to make sure that the data in the
 

4397
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:35,030
you to make sure that the data in the
blocks was actually published

4398
01:09:35,030 --> 01:09:35,040
blocks was actually published
 

4399
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:37,590
blocks was actually published
but like basically like if you stack a

4400
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:37,600
but like basically like if you stack a
 

4401
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,030
but like basically like if you stack a
couple of these tricks on top of each

4402
01:09:39,030 --> 01:09:39,040
couple of these tricks on top of each
 

4403
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:39,510
couple of these tricks on top of each
other

4404
01:09:39,510 --> 01:09:39,520
other
 

4405
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,590

you can create a system where like i as

4406
01:09:41,590 --> 01:09:41,600
you can create a system where like i as
 

4407
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:43,110
you can create a system where like i as
an individual participant

4408
01:09:43,110 --> 01:09:43,120
an individual participant
 

4409
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:45,269
an individual participant
can be convinced that everything that's

4410
01:09:45,269 --> 01:09:45,279
can be convinced that everything that's
 

4411
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:47,030
can be convinced that everything that's
going on in this distributed blockchain

4412
01:09:47,030 --> 01:09:47,040
going on in this distributed blockchain
 

4413
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:48,789
going on in this distributed blockchain
thing is correct without actually

4414
01:09:48,789 --> 01:09:48,799
thing is correct without actually
 

4415
01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:50,229
thing is correct without actually
personally checking more than like a

4416
01:09:50,229 --> 01:09:50,239
personally checking more than like a
 

4417
01:09:50,239 --> 01:09:50,950
personally checking more than like a
percent of it

4418
01:09:50,950 --> 01:09:50,960
percent of it
 

4419
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:52,870
percent of it
so that's charting that's starting but

4420
01:09:52,870 --> 01:09:52,880
so that's charting that's starting but
 

4421
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:54,310
so that's charting that's starting but
but the

4422
01:09:54,310 --> 01:09:54,320
but the
 

4423
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:58,070
but the
as i understand maybe correct me on this

4424
01:09:58,070 --> 01:09:58,080
as i understand maybe correct me on this
 

4425
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:01,590
as i understand maybe correct me on this
is uh in the space of ethereum

4426
01:10:01,590 --> 01:10:01,600
is uh in the space of ethereum
 

4427
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:04,070

the the sharding happens on some fixed

4428
01:10:04,070 --> 01:10:04,080
the the sharding happens on some fixed
 

4429
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:05,350
the the sharding happens on some fixed
number

4430
01:10:05,350 --> 01:10:05,360
number
 

4431
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:07,510
number
like th the split is on some fixed

4432
01:10:07,510 --> 01:10:07,520
like th the split is on some fixed
 

4433
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:09,189
like th the split is on some fixed
number i think it's 64.

4434
01:10:09,189 --> 01:10:09,199
number i think it's 64.
 

4435
01:10:09,199 --> 01:10:11,430
number i think it's 64.
is the currently sort of proposed number

4436
01:10:11,430 --> 01:10:11,440
is the currently sort of proposed number
 

4437
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:12,470
is the currently sort of proposed number
so

4438
01:10:12,470 --> 01:10:12,480
so
 

4439
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:16,149
so
um how does that help scaling is it just

4440
01:10:16,149 --> 01:10:16,159
um how does that help scaling is it just
 

4441
01:10:16,159 --> 01:10:16,790
um how does that help scaling is it just
to fix

4442
01:10:16,790 --> 01:10:16,800
to fix
 

4443
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:19,669
to fix
constant scaling by 64 and is that a way

4444
01:10:19,669 --> 01:10:19,679
constant scaling by 64 and is that a way
 

4445
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:20,709
constant scaling by 64 and is that a way
to achieve those

4446
01:10:20,709 --> 01:10:20,719
to achieve those
 

4447
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:23,189
to achieve those
crazy the crazy amount of scaling that

4448
01:10:23,189 --> 01:10:23,199
crazy the crazy amount of scaling that
 

4449
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:25,110
crazy the crazy amount of scaling that
seems to be required

4450
01:10:25,110 --> 01:10:25,120
seems to be required
 

4451
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:27,669
seems to be required
to use cryptocurrency for uh for

4452
01:10:27,669 --> 01:10:27,679
to use cryptocurrency for uh for
 

4453
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:29,510
to use cryptocurrency for uh for
purchasing so doing like competing with

4454
01:10:29,510 --> 01:10:29,520
purchasing so doing like competing with
 

4455
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:30,390
purchasing so doing like competing with
credit cards

4456
01:10:30,390 --> 01:10:30,400
credit cards
 

4457
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:32,390
credit cards
and visa and so on right so first i

4458
01:10:32,390 --> 01:10:32,400
and visa and so on right so first i
 

4459
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,630
and visa and so on right so first i
think like the 64 can be hard forked up

4460
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:34,640
think like the 64 can be hard forked up
 

4461
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:35,430
think like the 64 can be hard forked up
over time

4462
01:10:35,430 --> 01:10:35,440
over time
 

4463
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:38,070
over time
um so we have uh set it so that like

4464
01:10:38,070 --> 01:10:38,080
um so we have uh set it so that like
 

4465
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:39,270
um so we have uh set it so that like
there's theoretically

4466
01:10:39,270 --> 01:10:39,280
there's theoretically
 

4467
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,750
there's theoretically
space in the data structure for 1024

4468
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:41,760
space in the data structure for 1024
 

4469
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:43,430
space in the data structure for 1024
shards it's just that 64 of them are

4470
01:10:43,430 --> 01:10:43,440
shards it's just that 64 of them are
 

4471
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:44,310
shards it's just that 64 of them are
turned on

4472
01:10:44,310 --> 01:10:44,320
turned on
 

4473
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:46,550
turned on
um like there are challenges with having

4474
01:10:46,550 --> 01:10:46,560
um like there are challenges with having
 

4475
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:47,990
um like there are challenges with having
more shards because like you have to

4476
01:10:47,990 --> 01:10:48,000
more shards because like you have to
 

4477
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,510
more shards because like you have to
have logic that just like checks and

4478
01:10:49,510 --> 01:10:49,520
have logic that just like checks and
 

4479
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:50,390
have logic that just like checks and
manages all

4480
01:10:50,390 --> 01:10:50,400
manages all
 

4481
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:52,229
manages all
of those shards and if there's too many

4482
01:10:52,229 --> 01:10:52,239
of those shards and if there's too many
 

4483
01:10:52,239 --> 01:10:54,229
of those shards and if there's too many
of them then that becomes too expensive

4484
01:10:54,229 --> 01:10:54,239
of them then that becomes too expensive
 

4485
01:10:54,239 --> 01:10:56,310
of them then that becomes too expensive
um but you know even still you can

4486
01:10:56,310 --> 01:10:56,320
um but you know even still you can
 

4487
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:57,510
um but you know even still you can
improve quite a bit

4488
01:10:57,510 --> 01:10:57,520
improve quite a bit
 

4489
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,030
improve quite a bit
and then the other thing that we're

4490
01:10:59,030 --> 01:10:59,040
and then the other thing that we're
 

4491
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:00,630
and then the other thing that we're
doing is if

4492
01:11:00,630 --> 01:11:00,640
doing is if
 

4493
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:02,870
doing is if
what we're getting maximum scalability

4494
01:11:02,870 --> 01:11:02,880
what we're getting maximum scalability
 

4495
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:03,750
what we're getting maximum scalability
by combining

4496
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:03,760
by combining
 

4497
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,990
by combining
roll-ups and sharding right so this

4498
01:11:05,990 --> 01:11:06,000
roll-ups and sharding right so this
 

4499
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,189
roll-ups and sharding right so this
might be a good time to talk about

4500
01:11:07,189 --> 01:11:07,199
might be a good time to talk about
 

4501
01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:07,750
might be a good time to talk about
roll-ups

4502
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:07,760
roll-ups
 

4503
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:09,669
roll-ups
what are roll-ups okay and now we're

4504
01:11:09,669 --> 01:11:09,679
what are roll-ups okay and now we're
 

4505
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:12,390
what are roll-ups okay and now we're
moving into layer two ideas yes

4506
01:11:12,390 --> 01:11:12,400
moving into layer two ideas yes
 

4507
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:16,070
moving into layer two ideas yes
so the idea behind a roll-up

4508
01:11:16,070 --> 01:11:16,080
so the idea behind a roll-up
 

4509
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:19,430
so the idea behind a roll-up
is basically that so

4510
01:11:19,430 --> 01:11:19,440
is basically that so
 

4511
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:23,110
is basically that so
instead of um just publishing

4512
01:11:23,110 --> 01:11:23,120
instead of um just publishing
 

4513
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:25,189
instead of um just publishing
transactions directly on chain

4514
01:11:25,189 --> 01:11:25,199
transactions directly on chain
 

4515
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:27,830
transactions directly on chain
and having everyone you know do all of

4516
01:11:27,830 --> 01:11:27,840
and having everyone you know do all of
 

4517
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,590
and having everyone you know do all of
the checking of those transactions

4518
01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:29,600
the checking of those transactions
 

4519
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:31,910
the checking of those transactions
and what you do is you create a system

4520
01:11:31,910 --> 01:11:31,920
and what you do is you create a system
 

4521
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:33,189
and what you do is you create a system
where

4522
01:11:33,189 --> 01:11:33,199
where
 

4523
01:11:33,199 --> 01:11:36,229
where
users send their transactions to some

4524
01:11:36,229 --> 01:11:36,239
users send their transactions to some
 

4525
01:11:36,239 --> 01:11:36,790
users send their transactions to some
part like

4526
01:11:36,790 --> 01:11:36,800
part like
 

4527
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,790
part like
central party called an aggregator and

4528
01:11:38,790 --> 01:11:38,800
central party called an aggregator and
 

4529
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,550
central party called an aggregator and
like well theoretically you can have a

4530
01:11:40,550 --> 01:11:40,560
like well theoretically you can have a
 

4531
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:41,669
like well theoretically you can have a
system where like the aggregator

4532
01:11:41,669 --> 01:11:41,679
system where like the aggregator
 

4533
01:11:41,679 --> 01:11:43,430
system where like the aggregator
switches around or anyone can be an

4534
01:11:43,430 --> 01:11:43,440
switches around or anyone can be an
 

4535
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:44,390
switches around or anyone can be an
aggregator so

4536
01:11:44,390 --> 01:11:44,400
aggregator so
 

4537
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,070
aggregator so
you know it's still like permissionless

4538
01:11:46,070 --> 01:11:46,080
you know it's still like permissionless
 

4539
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:47,510
you know it's still like permissionless
to send things um

4540
01:11:47,510 --> 01:11:47,520
to send things um
 

4541
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:50,310
to send things um
then what the aggregator does is they

4542
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:50,320
then what the aggregator does is they
 

4543
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:52,790
then what the aggregator does is they
strip out all of the transaction data

4544
01:11:52,790 --> 01:11:52,800
strip out all of the transaction data
 

4545
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:56,149
strip out all of the transaction data
that like is not relevant to helping

4546
01:11:56,149 --> 01:11:56,159
that like is not relevant to helping
 

4547
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:56,630
that like is not relevant to helping
people

4548
01:11:56,630 --> 01:11:56,640
people
 

4549
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:58,550
people
update the state so when i say the state

4550
01:11:58,550 --> 01:11:58,560
update the state so when i say the state
 

4551
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,070
update the state so when i say the state
this is like this is a very important

4552
01:12:00,070 --> 01:12:00,080
this is like this is a very important
 

4553
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:01,669
this is like this is a very important
kind of technical term for blockchains i

4554
01:12:01,669 --> 01:12:01,679
kind of technical term for blockchains i
 

4555
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:02,390
kind of technical term for blockchains i
mean like

4556
01:12:02,390 --> 01:12:02,400
mean like
 

4557
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:06,149
mean like
account balances code um

4558
01:12:06,149 --> 01:12:06,159
account balances code um
 

4559
01:12:06,159 --> 01:12:08,630
account balances code um
like things that are like memory

4560
01:12:08,630 --> 01:12:08,640
like things that are like memory
 

4561
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,470
like things that are like memory
internal memory of smart contracts like

4562
01:12:10,470 --> 01:12:10,480
internal memory of smart contracts like
 

4563
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:11,990
internal memory of smart contracts like
basically everything the blockchain

4564
01:12:11,990 --> 01:12:12,000
basically everything the blockchain
 

4565
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,189
basically everything the blockchain
actually has to keep track of and

4566
01:12:13,189 --> 01:12:13,199
actually has to keep track of and
 

4567
01:12:13,199 --> 01:12:15,830
actually has to keep track of and
remember right so

4568
01:12:15,830 --> 01:12:15,840
remember right so
 

4569
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,870
remember right so
you just put in

4570
01:12:18,870 --> 01:12:18,880
you just put in
 

4571
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:20,470
you just put in
you take all these transactions strip

4572
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:20,480
you take all these transactions strip
 

4573
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:23,110
you take all these transactions strip
out all the data that's not relevant to

4574
01:12:23,110 --> 01:12:23,120
out all the data that's not relevant to
 

4575
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:24,790
out all the data that's not relevant to
telling people how to update the state

4576
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:24,800
telling people how to update the state
 

4577
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,550
telling people how to update the state
and then you take the data that's needed

4578
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:26,560
and then you take the data that's needed
 

4579
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:27,830
and then you take the data that's needed
to update the state and then you like

4580
01:12:27,830 --> 01:12:27,840
to update the state and then you like
 

4581
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:29,350
to update the state and then you like
really compress it right so like for

4582
01:12:29,350 --> 01:12:29,360
really compress it right so like for
 

4583
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:30,470
really compress it right so like for
example

4584
01:12:30,470 --> 01:12:30,480
example
 

4585
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:33,110
example
if we say you know i vitalik have an

4586
01:12:33,110 --> 01:12:33,120
if we say you know i vitalik have an
 

4587
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:33,590
if we say you know i vitalik have an
account

4588
01:12:33,590 --> 01:12:33,600
account
 

4589
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:36,470
account
that's 0x eight blah blah blah blah and

4590
01:12:36,470 --> 01:12:36,480
that's 0x eight blah blah blah blah and
 

4591
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:37,590
that's 0x eight blah blah blah blah and
it's 20 bytes

4592
01:12:37,590 --> 01:12:37,600
it's 20 bytes
 

4593
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:39,430
it's 20 bytes
well instead we can say well i have an

4594
01:12:39,430 --> 01:12:39,440
well instead we can say well i have an
 

4595
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:40,870
well instead we can say well i have an
account that is

4596
01:12:40,870 --> 01:12:40,880
account that is
 

4597
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:43,350
account that is
number one eight seven four two two four

4598
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:43,360
number one eight seven four two two four
 

4599
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:44,149
number one eight seven four two two four
in the tree

4600
01:12:44,149 --> 01:12:44,159
in the tree
 

4601
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:46,229
in the tree
right and that goes down from 20 bytes

4602
01:12:46,229 --> 01:12:46,239
right and that goes down from 20 bytes
 

4603
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:47,910
right and that goes down from 20 bytes
to just like an index and a position

4604
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:47,920
to just like an index and a position
 

4605
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:49,510
to just like an index and a position
which is three bytes right so you use

4606
01:12:49,510 --> 01:12:49,520
which is three bytes right so you use
 

4607
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:51,030
which is three bytes right so you use
all sorts of these fancy compression

4608
01:12:51,030 --> 01:12:51,040
all sorts of these fancy compression
 

4609
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:53,110
all sorts of these fancy compression
tracks then you basically just

4610
01:12:53,110 --> 01:12:53,120
tracks then you basically just
 

4611
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,630
tracks then you basically just
instead of publishing all these

4612
01:12:54,630 --> 01:12:54,640
instead of publishing all these
 

4613
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:56,790
instead of publishing all these
transactions you publish this like tiny

4614
01:12:56,790 --> 01:12:56,800
transactions you publish this like tiny
 

4615
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:57,990
transactions you publish this like tiny
compressed blob

4616
01:12:57,990 --> 01:12:58,000
compressed blob
 

4617
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,910
compressed blob
right so the amount of data that goes on

4618
01:12:59,910 --> 01:12:59,920
right so the amount of data that goes on
 

4619
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:01,590
right so the amount of data that goes on
chain goes down by maybe about a factor

4620
01:13:01,590 --> 01:13:01,600
chain goes down by maybe about a factor
 

4621
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:02,390
chain goes down by maybe about a factor
of ten

4622
01:13:02,390 --> 01:13:02,400
of ten
 

4623
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:04,070
of ten
right and then the second thing is that

4624
01:13:04,070 --> 01:13:04,080
right and then the second thing is that
 

4625
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:06,070
right and then the second thing is that
you don't do the computation on chin

4626
01:13:06,070 --> 01:13:06,080
you don't do the computation on chin
 

4627
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:08,470
you don't do the computation on chin
instead you do the computation off-chain

4628
01:13:08,470 --> 01:13:08,480
instead you do the computation off-chain
 

4629
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:09,350
instead you do the computation off-chain
and

4630
01:13:09,350 --> 01:13:09,360
and
 

4631
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:11,110
and
there's one of two ways to do this right

4632
01:13:11,110 --> 01:13:11,120
there's one of two ways to do this right
 

4633
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:13,189
there's one of two ways to do this right
one is called a zk roll up which is

4634
01:13:13,189 --> 01:13:13,199
one is called a zk roll up which is
 

4635
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:15,030
one is called a zk roll up which is
you just provide a zika snark that

4636
01:13:15,030 --> 01:13:15,040
you just provide a zika snark that
 

4637
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:16,390
you just provide a zika snark that
basically says hey look

4638
01:13:16,390 --> 01:13:16,400
basically says hey look
 

4639
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:19,189
basically says hey look
i did this computation and uh and i have

4640
01:13:19,189 --> 01:13:19,199
i did this computation and uh and i have
 

4641
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:20,390
i did this computation and uh and i have
this proof that here's the

4642
01:13:20,390 --> 01:13:20,400
this proof that here's the
 

4643
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,830
this proof that here's the
here's the you know some hash of the

4644
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:21,840
here's the you know some hash of the
 

4645
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,750
here's the you know some hash of the
result and it's correct and then you

4646
01:13:23,750 --> 01:13:23,760
result and it's correct and then you
 

4647
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:24,709
result and it's correct and then you
stick it on chain

4648
01:13:24,709 --> 01:13:24,719
stick it on chain
 

4649
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:26,630
stick it on chain
and everyone verifies this one proof

4650
01:13:26,630 --> 01:13:26,640
and everyone verifies this one proof
 

4651
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:27,830
and everyone verifies this one proof
instead of verifying all these

4652
01:13:27,830 --> 01:13:27,840
instead of verifying all these
 

4653
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,030
instead of verifying all these
transactions

4654
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:29,040
transactions
 

4655
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:30,630
transactions
and then the other approach is called an

4656
01:13:30,630 --> 01:13:30,640
and then the other approach is called an
 

4657
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,390
and then the other approach is called an
optimistic roll-up which is basically

4658
01:13:32,390 --> 01:13:32,400
optimistic roll-up which is basically
 

4659
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:35,270
optimistic roll-up which is basically
made of the scheme where like first

4660
01:13:35,270 --> 01:13:35,280
made of the scheme where like first
 

4661
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:36,790
made of the scheme where like first
someone says like hey

4662
01:13:36,790 --> 01:13:36,800
someone says like hey
 

4663
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,390
someone says like hey
this is what i think the result of the

4664
01:13:38,390 --> 01:13:38,400
this is what i think the result of the
 

4665
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,709
this is what i think the result of the
of applying these transactions is and

4666
01:13:40,709 --> 01:13:40,719
of applying these transactions is and
 

4667
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:42,470
of applying these transactions is and
then someone else can say i disagree the

4668
01:13:42,470 --> 01:13:42,480
then someone else can say i disagree the
 

4669
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:43,590
then someone else can say i disagree the
result is different

4670
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:43,600
result is different
 

4671
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:45,910
result is different
and only if two people disagree do you

4672
01:13:45,910 --> 01:13:45,920
and only if two people disagree do you
 

4673
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:47,110
and only if two people disagree do you
actually do it on like

4674
01:13:47,110 --> 01:13:47,120
actually do it on like
 

4675
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:49,430
actually do it on like
do you actually just like publish all of

4676
01:13:49,430 --> 01:13:49,440
do you actually just like publish all of
 

4677
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:50,790
do you actually just like publish all of
the data and run the whole

4678
01:13:50,790 --> 01:13:50,800
the data and run the whole
 

4679
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,870
the data and run the whole
that whole blog on chain so if there's

4680
01:13:52,870 --> 01:13:52,880
that whole blog on chain so if there's
 

4681
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,229
that whole blog on chain so if there's
disagreements then you just

4682
01:13:54,229 --> 01:13:54,239
disagreements then you just
 

4683
01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:56,550
disagreements then you just
like run everything on chain and whoever

4684
01:13:56,550 --> 01:13:56,560
like run everything on chain and whoever
 

4685
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:58,390
like run everything on chain and whoever
was wrong like loses a lot of money

4686
01:13:58,390 --> 01:13:58,400
was wrong like loses a lot of money
 

4687
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,310
was wrong like loses a lot of money
right so disagreements are very rare and

4688
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:00,320
right so disagreements are very rare and
 

4689
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:01,510
right so disagreements are very rare and
they're very expensive

4690
01:14:01,510 --> 01:14:01,520
they're very expensive
 

4691
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,430
they're very expensive
and in a ck roll up you don't even rely

4692
01:14:03,430 --> 01:14:03,440
and in a ck roll up you don't even rely
 

4693
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:04,550
and in a ck roll up you don't even rely
on this like challenging

4694
01:14:04,550 --> 01:14:04,560
on this like challenging
 

4695
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:07,110
on this like challenging
game at all you just rely on a proof so

4696
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:07,120
game at all you just rely on a proof so
 

4697
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:09,189
game at all you just rely on a proof so
you know the core principle is basically

4698
01:14:09,189 --> 01:14:09,199
you know the core principle is basically
 

4699
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:09,669
you know the core principle is basically
that

4700
01:14:09,669 --> 01:14:09,679
that
 

4701
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:12,310
that
instead of lots of transactions and all

4702
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:12,320
instead of lots of transactions and all
 

4703
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:13,750
instead of lots of transactions and all
the trends that everyone verifies every

4704
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:13,760
the trends that everyone verifies every
 

4705
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:14,630
the trends that everyone verifies every
transaction

4706
01:14:14,630 --> 01:14:14,640
transaction
 

4707
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:16,870
transaction
it is you take the transactions you

4708
01:14:16,870 --> 01:14:16,880
it is you take the transactions you
 

4709
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:18,950
it is you take the transactions you
strip strip them down and compress them

4710
01:14:18,950 --> 01:14:18,960
strip strip them down and compress them
 

4711
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:20,229
strip strip them down and compress them
as much as possible

4712
01:14:20,229 --> 01:14:20,239
as much as possible
 

4713
01:14:20,239 --> 01:14:22,630
as much as possible
then stick that on the blockchain you do

4714
01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:22,640
then stick that on the blockchain you do
 

4715
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:23,830
then stick that on the blockchain you do
need to stick something on the

4716
01:14:23,830 --> 01:14:23,840
need to stick something on the
 

4717
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:25,590
need to stick something on the
blockchain just so that everyone

4718
01:14:25,590 --> 01:14:25,600
blockchain just so that everyone
 

4719
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:27,189
blockchain just so that everyone
everyone else can like keep keep up to

4720
01:14:27,189 --> 01:14:27,199
everyone else can like keep keep up to
 

4721
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:28,630
everyone else can like keep keep up to
date with the states so they know

4722
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:28,640
date with the states so they know
 

4723
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,070
date with the states so they know
you know what all the contracts are what

4724
01:14:30,070 --> 01:14:30,080
you know what all the contracts are what
 

4725
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:31,669
you know what all the contracts are what
all the balances are and all of this but

4726
01:14:31,669 --> 01:14:31,679
all the balances are and all of this but
 

4727
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:33,590
all the balances are and all of this but
it's a very small amount of data and

4728
01:14:33,590 --> 01:14:33,600
it's a very small amount of data and
 

4729
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,350
it's a very small amount of data and
then you use some one of these other

4730
01:14:35,350 --> 01:14:35,360
then you use some one of these other
 

4731
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:37,510
then you use some one of these other
off-chain games you know could be this

4732
01:14:37,510 --> 01:14:37,520
off-chain games you know could be this
 

4733
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:39,830
off-chain games you know could be this
optimistic game could be a zk-snark to

4734
01:14:39,830 --> 01:14:39,840
optimistic game could be a zk-snark to
 

4735
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,189
optimistic game could be a zk-snark to
just prove that

4736
01:14:41,189 --> 01:14:41,199
just prove that
 

4737
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:42,950
just prove that
somebody out there did the compensation

4738
01:14:42,950 --> 01:14:42,960
somebody out there did the compensation
 

4739
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:44,229
somebody out there did the compensation
and the result is correct

4740
01:14:44,229 --> 01:14:44,239
and the result is correct
 

4741
01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:46,870
and the result is correct
right so you're pushing like 90 of the

4742
01:14:46,870 --> 01:14:46,880
right so you're pushing like 90 of the
 

4743
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:48,229
right so you're pushing like 90 of the
work off chain and then

4744
01:14:48,229 --> 01:14:48,239
work off chain and then
 

4745
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:51,270
work off chain and then
you know well 90 of the data ends 99 of

4746
01:14:51,270 --> 01:14:51,280
you know well 90 of the data ends 99 of
 

4747
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:52,630
you know well 90 of the data ends 99 of
the computation option

4748
01:14:52,630 --> 01:14:52,640
the computation option
 

4749
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:54,229
the computation option
and then you still have 10 of the data

4750
01:14:54,229 --> 01:14:54,239
and then you still have 10 of the data
 

4751
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:56,149
and then you still have 10 of the data
and 1 of the computation on chin

4752
01:14:56,149 --> 01:14:56,159
and 1 of the computation on chin
 

4753
01:14:56,159 --> 01:14:57,830
and 1 of the computation on chin
and so you know your scalability goes up

4754
01:14:57,830 --> 01:14:57,840
and so you know your scalability goes up
 

4755
01:14:57,840 --> 01:14:59,910
and so you know your scalability goes up
by a factor of about a hundred

4756
01:14:59,910 --> 01:14:59,920
by a factor of about a hundred
 

4757
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:03,669
by a factor of about a hundred
so these systems are already alive for

4758
01:15:03,669 --> 01:15:03,679
so these systems are already alive for
 

4759
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:06,149
so these systems are already alive for
for some applications right so there's

4760
01:15:06,149 --> 01:15:06,159
for some applications right so there's
 

4761
01:15:06,159 --> 01:15:07,830
for some applications right so there's
something called loopering which is just

4762
01:15:07,830 --> 01:15:07,840
something called loopering which is just
 

4763
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:08,470
something called loopering which is just
a

4764
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:08,480
a
 

4765
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:11,270
a
zk roll up for payments right so you can

4766
01:15:11,270 --> 01:15:11,280
zk roll up for payments right so you can
 

4767
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:11,910
zk roll up for payments right so you can
have

4768
01:15:11,910 --> 01:15:11,920
have
 

4769
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:13,910
have
you know assets inside of us inside of

4770
01:15:13,910 --> 01:15:13,920
you know assets inside of us inside of
 

4771
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:15,189
you know assets inside of us inside of
the loopering system

4772
01:15:15,189 --> 01:15:15,199
the loopering system
 

4773
01:15:15,199 --> 01:15:17,350
the loopering system
and you can go around and transfer them

4774
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:17,360
and you can go around and transfer them
 

4775
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:18,709
and you can go around and transfer them
but

4776
01:15:18,709 --> 01:15:18,719
but
 

4777
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:21,750
but
uh what you um and

4778
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:21,760
uh what you um and
 

4779
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:24,229
uh what you um and
you get like much lower transaction fees

4780
01:15:24,229 --> 01:15:24,239
you get like much lower transaction fees
 

4781
01:15:24,239 --> 01:15:25,750
you get like much lower transaction fees
right like instead of five dollars you'd

4782
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:25,760
right like instead of five dollars you'd
 

4783
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:27,669
right like instead of five dollars you'd
have to pay like less than five cents

4784
01:15:27,669 --> 01:15:27,679
have to pay like less than five cents
 

4785
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:30,709
have to pay like less than five cents
um but the only problem is that this

4786
01:15:30,709 --> 01:15:30,719
um but the only problem is that this
 

4787
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:32,470
um but the only problem is that this
only supports a couple of applications

4788
01:15:32,470 --> 01:15:32,480
only supports a couple of applications
 

4789
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:34,470
only supports a couple of applications
right now like making one that

4790
01:15:34,470 --> 01:15:34,480
right now like making one that
 

4791
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:35,990
right now like making one that
supports anything that you can do on

4792
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:36,000
supports anything that you can do on
 

4793
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,630
supports anything that you can do on
ethereum just takes a bit more work but

4794
01:15:38,630 --> 01:15:38,640
ethereum just takes a bit more work but
 

4795
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:40,229
ethereum just takes a bit more work but
that's being done as well right so like

4796
01:15:40,229 --> 01:15:40,239
that's being done as well right so like
 

4797
01:15:40,239 --> 01:15:41,990
that's being done as well right so like
within a few months i'm expecting

4798
01:15:41,990 --> 01:15:42,000
within a few months i'm expecting
 

4799
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,110

you know fully ethereum um capable

4800
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:45,120
you know fully ethereum um capable

um roll ups to um be available as well

4802
01:15:48,630 --> 01:15:48,640
um roll ups to um be available as well
 

4803
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:51,510

so then so roll ups just summarizing you

4804
01:15:51,510 --> 01:15:51,520
so then so roll ups just summarizing you
 

4805
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:53,189
so then so roll ups just summarizing you
know do most of the work off chain put

know do most of the work off chain put
 

4807
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:54,390

do a large number of transactions very
 

4825
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,590
do a large number of transactions very
quickly and uh the cost of doing those

quickly and uh the cost of doing those
 

4827
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,430

are likely to win out of general purpose
 

4845
01:16:27,679 --> 01:16:29,350
are likely to win out of general purpose
evm computation and

4846

01:16:32,390 --> 01:16:32,400
zk roll ups are likely to win
 

4849
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:35,669
zk roll ups are likely to win
out for simple payments uh exchange in

4850
01:16:35,669 --> 01:16:35,679
out for simple payments uh exchange in
 

4851
01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:37,669
out for simple payments uh exchange in
other application specific use cases

4852
01:16:37,669 --> 01:16:37,679
other application specific use cases
 

4853
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:39,590
other application specific use cases
just as you were saying but in the

4854
01:16:39,590 --> 01:16:39,600
just as you were saying but in the
 

4855
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:42,310
just as you were saying but in the
medium to long term zk roll ups will win

4856
01:16:42,310 --> 01:16:42,320
medium to long term zk roll ups will win
 

4857
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:45,750
medium to long term zk roll ups will win
out in all use cases as

4858
01:16:45,750 --> 01:16:45,760
out in all use cases as
 

4859
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:49,030
out in all use cases as
zk snark technology improves

4860
01:16:49,030 --> 01:16:49,040
zk snark technology improves
 

4861
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:51,830
zk snark technology improves
why do you think uh zk roll ups are

4862
01:16:51,830 --> 01:16:51,840
why do you think uh zk roll ups are
 

4863
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,030
why do you think uh zk roll ups are
going to win

4864
01:16:53,030 --> 01:16:53,040
going to win
 

4865
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:55,030
going to win
the big picture battle over layer 2

4866
01:16:55,030 --> 01:16:55,040
the big picture battle over layer 2
 

4867
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:56,790
the big picture battle over layer 2
technologies

4868
01:16:56,790 --> 01:16:56,800
technologies
 

4869
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:59,750
technologies
so i think zk roll ups like once you

4870
01:16:59,750 --> 01:16:59,760
so i think zk roll ups like once you
 

4871
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:02,149
so i think zk roll ups like once you
accept that the technology works are

4872
01:17:02,149 --> 01:17:02,159
accept that the technology works are
 

4873
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:04,070
accept that the technology works are
just like conceptually simpler and they

4874
01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:04,080
just like conceptually simpler and they
 

4875
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,430
just like conceptually simpler and they
have nicer properties

4876
01:17:05,430 --> 01:17:05,440
have nicer properties
 

4877
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:07,510
have nicer properties
the reason is that they do not have this

4878
01:17:07,510 --> 01:17:07,520
the reason is that they do not have this
 

4879
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:09,110
the reason is that they do not have this
concept of a challenge game right like

4880
01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:09,120
concept of a challenge game right like
 

4881
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:09,830
concept of a challenge game right like
as i mentioned

4882
01:17:09,830 --> 01:17:09,840
as i mentioned
 

4883
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:11,750
as i mentioned
in an optimistic roll-up the way that

4884
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:11,760
in an optimistic roll-up the way that
 

4885
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:13,030
in an optimistic roll-up the way that
you ensure that

4886
01:17:13,030 --> 01:17:13,040
you ensure that
 

4887
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:14,950
you ensure that
the results are correct is that you let

4888
01:17:14,950 --> 01:17:14,960
the results are correct is that you let
 

4889
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:16,550
the results are correct is that you let
one person submit and like they just

4890
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:16,560
one person submit and like they just
 

4891
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:17,910
one person submit and like they just
submit with no proof they just say

4892
01:17:17,910 --> 01:17:17,920
submit with no proof they just say
 

4893
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:19,669
submit with no proof they just say
here's what i think the result is

4894
01:17:19,669 --> 01:17:19,679
here's what i think the result is
 

4895
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:21,830
here's what i think the result is
and then if someone else disagrees they

4896
01:17:21,830 --> 01:17:21,840
and then if someone else disagrees they
 

4897
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:23,270
and then if someone else disagrees they
make their own submission and then if

4898
01:17:23,270 --> 01:17:23,280
make their own submission and then if
 

4899
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:24,630
make their own submission and then if
you have two disagreeing submissions

4900
01:17:24,630 --> 01:17:24,640
you have two disagreeing submissions
 

4901
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:25,990
you have two disagreeing submissions
then you actually publish it on chain

4902
01:17:25,990 --> 01:17:26,000
then you actually publish it on chain
 

4903
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,430
then you actually publish it on chain
and you see who's right

4904
01:17:27,430 --> 01:17:27,440
and you see who's right
 

4905
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:29,830
and you see who's right
but for this to work like you need to

4906
01:17:29,830 --> 01:17:29,840
but for this to work like you need to
 

4907
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:31,830
but for this to work like you need to
actually wait for someone to disagree

4908
01:17:31,830 --> 01:17:31,840
actually wait for someone to disagree
 

4909
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:33,669
actually wait for someone to disagree
right so like for example if i have an

4910
01:17:33,669 --> 01:17:33,679
right so like for example if i have an
 

4911
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:35,510
right so like for example if i have an
asset inside of an optimistic roll-up

4912
01:17:35,510 --> 01:17:35,520
asset inside of an optimistic roll-up
 

4913
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:37,189
asset inside of an optimistic roll-up
and i wants to withdraw it then i

4914
01:17:37,189 --> 01:17:37,199
and i wants to withdraw it then i
 

4915
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:38,790
and i wants to withdraw it then i
actually have to wait a week to withdraw

4916
01:17:38,790 --> 01:17:38,800
actually have to wait a week to withdraw
 

4917
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:39,590
actually have to wait a week to withdraw
it because

4918
01:17:39,590 --> 01:17:39,600
it because
 

4919
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:42,709
it because
like if the uh a block that contains my

4920
01:17:42,709 --> 01:17:42,719
like if the uh a block that contains my
 

4921
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:44,550
like if the uh a block that contains my
withdrawal turns out to be invalid then

4922
01:17:44,550 --> 01:17:44,560
withdrawal turns out to be invalid then
 

4923
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:45,990
withdrawal turns out to be invalid then
there needs to be space for someone to

4924
01:17:45,990 --> 01:17:46,000
there needs to be space for someone to
 

4925
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:46,870
there needs to be space for someone to
disagree with it

4926
01:17:46,870 --> 01:17:46,880
disagree with it
 

4927
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:48,790
disagree with it
right whereas with a ck roll up like you

4928
01:17:48,790 --> 01:17:48,800
right whereas with a ck roll up like you
 

4929
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,229
right whereas with a ck roll up like you
don't need time for disagreement because

4930
01:17:50,229 --> 01:17:50,239
don't need time for disagreement because
 

4931
01:17:50,239 --> 01:17:51,669
don't need time for disagreement because
you just have a proof right as soon as

4932
01:17:51,669 --> 01:17:51,679
you just have a proof right as soon as
 

4933
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:53,510
you just have a proof right as soon as
the block is submitted there's a proof

4934
01:17:53,510 --> 01:17:53,520
the block is submitted there's a proof
 

4935
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:55,990
the block is submitted there's a proof
and you know it's correct so

4936
01:17:55,990 --> 01:17:56,000
and you know it's correct so
 

4937
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:56,870
and you know it's correct so
disagreements

4938
01:17:56,870 --> 01:17:56,880
disagreements
 

4939
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:59,270
disagreements
especially in the long term or sparse uh

4940
01:17:59,270 --> 01:17:59,280
especially in the long term or sparse uh
 

4941
01:17:59,280 --> 01:17:59,990
especially in the long term or sparse uh
then uh

4942
01:17:59,990 --> 01:18:00,000
then uh
 

4943
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,310
then uh
then then you don't want to do the

4944
01:18:02,310 --> 01:18:02,320
then then you don't want to do the
 

4945
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:03,030
then then you don't want to do the
optimistic

4946
01:18:03,030 --> 01:18:03,040
optimistic
 

4947
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:04,550
optimistic
the the game theoretic thing you know

4948
01:18:04,550 --> 01:18:04,560
the the game theoretic thing you know
 

4949
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,310
the the game theoretic thing you know
you want to do the zk stock right the z

4950
01:18:06,310 --> 01:18:06,320
you want to do the zk stock right the z
 

4951
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:06,709
you want to do the zk stock right the z
case

4952
01:18:06,709 --> 01:18:06,719
case
 

4953
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:09,510
case
stuff is just like you can in a ck roll

4954
01:18:09,510 --> 01:18:09,520
stuff is just like you can in a ck roll
 

4955
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:11,189
stuff is just like you can in a ck roll
up you can withdraw immediately

4956
01:18:11,189 --> 01:18:11,199
up you can withdraw immediately
 

4957
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:13,669
up you can withdraw immediately
um you don't have to like worry about

4958
01:18:13,669 --> 01:18:13,679
um you don't have to like worry about
 

4959
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:15,830
um you don't have to like worry about
the economics of proving as much

4960
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:15,840
the economics of proving as much
 

4961
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:18,390
the economics of proving as much
there's just like fewer issues um the

4962
01:18:18,390 --> 01:18:18,400
there's just like fewer issues um the
 

4963
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:20,550
there's just like fewer issues um the
reason why ck roll-ups are not winning

4964
01:18:20,550 --> 01:18:20,560
reason why ck roll-ups are not winning
 

4965
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:22,550
reason why ck roll-ups are not winning
everywhere today is because you know

4966
01:18:22,550 --> 01:18:22,560
everywhere today is because you know
 

4967
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:24,149
everywhere today is because you know
zeke's darks is still a crazy new

4968
01:18:24,149 --> 01:18:24,159
zeke's darks is still a crazy new
 

4969
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:25,830
zeke's darks is still a crazy new
technology right like this is something

4970
01:18:25,830 --> 01:18:25,840
technology right like this is something
 

4971
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:26,390
technology right like this is something
that

4972
01:18:26,390 --> 01:18:26,400
that
 

4973
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,790
that
10 years ago you know it existed only in

4974
01:18:28,790 --> 01:18:28,800
10 years ago you know it existed only in
 

4975
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,709
10 years ago you know it existed only in
theory and there was none in practice

4976
01:18:30,709 --> 01:18:30,719
theory and there was none in practice
 

4977
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:33,030
theory and there was none in practice
um then you know eight years ago people

4978
01:18:33,030 --> 01:18:33,040
um then you know eight years ago people
 

4979
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:34,470
um then you know eight years ago people
were just getting excited about it in

4980
01:18:34,470 --> 01:18:34,480
were just getting excited about it in
 

4981
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:36,630
were just getting excited about it in
bitcoin conferences for the first time

4982
01:18:36,630 --> 01:18:36,640
bitcoin conferences for the first time
 

4983
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:40,149
bitcoin conferences for the first time
um like four years starting four years

4984
01:18:40,149 --> 01:18:40,159
um like four years starting four years
 

4985
01:18:40,159 --> 01:18:40,630
um like four years starting four years
ago

4986
01:18:40,630 --> 01:18:40,640
ago
 

4987
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:42,390
ago
or three and a half years ago even that

4988
01:18:42,390 --> 01:18:42,400
or three and a half years ago even that
 

4989
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:43,830
or three and a half years ago even that
was the first time you were able to make

4990
01:18:43,830 --> 01:18:43,840
was the first time you were able to make
 

4991
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:45,990
was the first time you were able to make
any zika snark based anything on

4992
01:18:45,990 --> 01:18:46,000
any zika snark based anything on
 

4993
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:46,709
any zika snark based anything on
ethereum

4994
01:18:46,709 --> 01:18:46,719
ethereum
 

4995
01:18:46,719 --> 01:18:49,189
ethereum
and then people started making them and

4996
01:18:49,189 --> 01:18:49,199
and then people started making them and
 

4997
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:51,189
and then people started making them and
zk technology has only really become

4998
01:18:51,189 --> 01:18:51,199
zk technology has only really become
 

4999
01:18:51,199 --> 01:18:52,870
zk technology has only really become
efficient enough to do a lot of things

5000
01:18:52,870 --> 01:18:52,880
efficient enough to do a lot of things
 

5001
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:53,990
efficient enough to do a lot of things
within the past maybe

5002
01:18:53,990 --> 01:18:54,000
within the past maybe
 

5003
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,910
within the past maybe

yeah it's brilliant summary of the work

5030
01:19:22,550 --> 01:19:22,560
yeah it's brilliant summary of the work
 

5031
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:24,550
yeah it's brilliant summary of the work
actually uh ethereum documentation

5032
01:19:24,550 --> 01:19:24,560
actually uh ethereum documentation
 

5033
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:26,229
actually uh ethereum documentation
period is really good i think that's

5034
01:19:26,229 --> 01:19:26,239
period is really good i think that's
 

5035
01:19:26,239 --> 01:19:29,110
period is really good i think that's
somewhat crowdsourced that documentation

5036
01:19:29,110 --> 01:19:29,120
somewhat crowdsourced that documentation
 

5037
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:30,390
somewhat crowdsourced that documentation
is really really accessible and

5038
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:30,400
is really really accessible and
 

5039
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:31,590
is really really accessible and
brilliant

5040
01:19:31,590 --> 01:19:31,600
brilliant
 

5041
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:35,189
brilliant
uh but let me ask about sort of

5042
01:19:35,189 --> 01:19:35,199
uh but let me ask about sort of
 

5043
01:19:35,199 --> 01:19:38,229
uh but let me ask about sort of
other approaches to layer two

5044
01:19:38,229 --> 01:19:38,239
other approaches to layer two
 

5045
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:40,550
other approaches to layer two
like side chains so the one popular one

5046
01:19:40,550 --> 01:19:40,560
like side chains so the one popular one
 

5047
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:42,310
like side chains so the one popular one
is polygon

5048
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:42,320
is polygon
 

5049
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:43,830
is polygon
what are your thoughts about polygon

5050
01:19:43,830 --> 01:19:43,840
what are your thoughts about polygon
 

5051
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:46,870
what are your thoughts about polygon
which is a layer two

5052
01:19:46,870 --> 01:19:46,880
which is a layer two
 

5053
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:50,310
which is a layer two
network is it positive is it negative

5054
01:19:50,310 --> 01:19:50,320
network is it positive is it negative
 

5055
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:52,390
network is it positive is it negative
for ethereum is it both does it have a

5056
01:19:52,390 --> 01:19:52,400
for ethereum is it both does it have a
 

5057
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:53,189
for ethereum is it both does it have a
future

5058
01:19:53,189 --> 01:19:53,199
future
 

5059
01:19:53,199 --> 01:19:57,350
future
which is its own chain but it's using

5060
01:19:57,350 --> 01:19:57,360
which is its own chain but it's using
 

5061
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:59,910
which is its own chain but it's using
a theory it's like based on ethereum

5062
01:19:59,910 --> 01:19:59,920
a theory it's like based on ethereum
 

5063
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:00,790
a theory it's like based on ethereum
essentially

5064
01:20:00,790 --> 01:20:00,800
essentially
 

5065
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,790
essentially
or maybe you can describe what it is um

5066
01:20:02,790 --> 01:20:02,800
or maybe you can describe what it is um
 

5067
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:05,270
or maybe you can describe what it is um
so i think there is a really big and

5068
01:20:05,270 --> 01:20:05,280
so i think there is a really big and
 

5069
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:07,110
so i think there is a really big and
important difference in security models

5070
01:20:07,110 --> 01:20:07,120
important difference in security models
 

5071
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:08,870
important difference in security models
between roll-ups and side-chains

5072
01:20:08,870 --> 01:20:08,880
between roll-ups and side-chains
 

5073
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:11,510
between roll-ups and side-chains
which is basically that roll-ups inherit

5074
01:20:11,510 --> 01:20:11,520
which is basically that roll-ups inherit
 

5075
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:13,350
which is basically that roll-ups inherit
from the security of ethereum right so

5076
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:13,360
from the security of ethereum right so
 

5077
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:14,310
from the security of ethereum right so
like if

5078
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:14,320
like if
 

5079
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:16,550
like if
i have coins inside of bloopering or

5080
01:20:16,550 --> 01:20:16,560
i have coins inside of bloopering or
 

5081
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:19,350
i have coins inside of bloopering or
optimism or arbitrarium um or zk sync

5082
01:20:19,350 --> 01:20:19,360
optimism or arbitrarium um or zk sync
 

5083
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:22,390
optimism or arbitrarium um or zk sync
um then even if everyone else in the

5084
01:20:22,390 --> 01:20:22,400
um then even if everyone else in the
 

5085
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:23,910
um then even if everyone else in the
world who is participating in these

5086
01:20:23,910 --> 01:20:23,920
world who is participating in these
 

5087
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,910
world who is participating in these
ecosystems so like hates me and though

5088
01:20:25,910 --> 01:20:25,920
ecosystems so like hates me and though
 

5089
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:28,229
ecosystems so like hates me and though
and wants to steal my money i can still

5090
01:20:28,229 --> 01:20:28,239
and wants to steal my money i can still
 

5091
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:29,430
and wants to steal my money i can still
personally

5092
01:20:29,430 --> 01:20:29,440
personally
 

5093
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:31,110
personally
make sure that you know no matter what

5094
01:20:31,110 --> 01:20:31,120
make sure that you know no matter what
 

5095
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:33,430
make sure that you know no matter what
happens i get them i get my money out

5096
01:20:33,430 --> 01:20:33,440
happens i get them i get my money out
 

5097
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:34,709
happens i get them i get my money out
it might be a bit expensive for me to

5098
01:20:34,709 --> 01:20:34,719
it might be a bit expensive for me to
 

5099
01:20:34,719 --> 01:20:36,070
it might be a bit expensive for me to
get my money out and i have to do

5100
01:20:36,070 --> 01:20:36,080
get my money out and i have to do
 

5101
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:38,149
get my money out and i have to do
transactions like on the main chain but

5102
01:20:38,149 --> 01:20:38,159
transactions like on the main chain but
 

5103
01:20:38,159 --> 01:20:41,270
transactions like on the main chain but
i'll be able to do it whereas in polygon

5104
01:20:41,270 --> 01:20:41,280
i'll be able to do it whereas in polygon
 

5105
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:42,950
i'll be able to do it whereas in polygon
which is a side chain and so instead of

5106
01:20:42,950 --> 01:20:42,960
which is a side chain and so instead of
 

5107
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:44,149
which is a side chain and so instead of
being secured by

5108
01:20:44,149 --> 01:20:44,159
being secured by
 

5109
01:20:44,159 --> 01:20:46,790
being secured by
ethereum it's also in part secured by

5110
01:20:46,790 --> 01:20:46,800
ethereum it's also in part secured by
 

5111
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:47,590
ethereum it's also in part secured by
its own

5112
01:20:47,590 --> 01:20:47,600
its own
 

5113
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:49,350
its own
um a proof of state consensus with its

5114
01:20:49,350 --> 01:20:49,360
um a proof of state consensus with its
 

5115
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:50,629
um a proof of state consensus with its
own token so

5116
01:20:50,629 --> 01:20:50,639
own token so
 

5117
01:20:50,639 --> 01:20:54,550
own token so
if 70 of the whole or even 51

5118
01:20:54,550 --> 01:20:54,560
if 70 of the whole or even 51
 

5119
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:56,790
if 70 of the whole or even 51
of the holders of polygon tokens wanted

5120
01:20:56,790 --> 01:20:56,800
of the holders of polygon tokens wanted
 

5121
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:58,709
of the holders of polygon tokens wanted
to take my money in polygon they can

5122
01:20:58,709 --> 01:20:58,719
to take my money in polygon they can
 

5123
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:01,990
to take my money in polygon they can
right so that's the pro

5124
01:21:01,990 --> 01:21:02,000
right so that's the pro
 

5125
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,990
right so that's the pro
and like to be fair like there aren't

5126
01:21:03,990 --> 01:21:04,000
and like to be fair like there aren't
 

5127
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,669
and like to be fair like there aren't
even like the

5128
01:21:05,669 --> 01:21:05,679
even like the
 

5129
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:07,350
even like the
the supply i don't think is even that

5130
01:21:07,350 --> 01:21:07,360
the supply i don't think is even that
 

5131
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:08,870
the supply i don't think is even that
widely distributed right so like

5132
01:21:08,870 --> 01:21:08,880
widely distributed right so like
 

5133
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:09,830
widely distributed right so like
potentially

5134
01:21:09,830 --> 01:21:09,840
potentially
 

5135
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:13,030
potentially
you could you could this idea 51

5136
01:21:13,030 --> 01:21:13,040
you could you could this idea 51
 

5137
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:15,189
you could you could this idea 51
of the token holders coming together and

5138
01:21:15,189 --> 01:21:15,199
of the token holders coming together and
 

5139
01:21:15,199 --> 01:21:17,510
of the token holders coming together and
stealing everything like it's

5140
01:21:17,510 --> 01:21:17,520
stealing everything like it's
 

5141
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:19,669
stealing everything like it's
it's not impossible right uh where does

5142
01:21:19,669 --> 01:21:19,679
it's not impossible right uh where does
 

5143
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:21,750
it's not impossible right uh where does
the scaling of polygon come from like

5144
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:21,760
the scaling of polygon come from like
 

5145
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:23,430
the scaling of polygon come from like
why is it

5146
01:21:23,430 --> 01:21:23,440
why is it
 

5147
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:26,149
why is it
able to process much more transactions

5148
01:21:26,149 --> 01:21:26,159
able to process much more transactions
 

5149
01:21:26,159 --> 01:21:26,550
able to process much more transactions
than

5150
01:21:26,550 --> 01:21:26,560
than
 

5151
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:28,870
than
the ethereum main chain what's the idea

5152
01:21:28,870 --> 01:21:28,880
the ethereum main chain what's the idea
 

5153
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:29,990
the ethereum main chain what's the idea
there i think

5154
01:21:29,990 --> 01:21:30,000
there i think
 

5155
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,790
there i think
in part like i imagine i'm not sure

5156
01:21:32,790 --> 01:21:32,800
in part like i imagine i'm not sure
 

5157
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:34,550
in part like i imagine i'm not sure
exactly what its capacity level is but

5158
01:21:34,550 --> 01:21:34,560
exactly what its capacity level is but
 

5159
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,629
exactly what its capacity level is but
like i imagine it has a higher capacity

5160
01:21:36,629 --> 01:21:36,639
like i imagine it has a higher capacity
 

5161
01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:37,430
like i imagine it has a higher capacity
because

5162
01:21:37,430 --> 01:21:37,440
because
 

5163
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:38,870
because
it's a bit more willing to take

5164
01:21:38,870 --> 01:21:38,880
it's a bit more willing to take
 

5165
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:40,550
it's a bit more willing to take
centralization trade-offs

5166
01:21:40,550 --> 01:21:40,560
centralization trade-offs
 

5167
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:43,270
centralization trade-offs
and then another thing is that like if

5168
01:21:43,270 --> 01:21:43,280
and then another thing is that like if
 

5169
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:44,790
and then another thing is that like if
the ethereum ecosystem

5170
01:21:44,790 --> 01:21:44,800
the ethereum ecosystem
 

5171
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,550
the ethereum ecosystem
like even if it did not do that right if

5172
01:21:46,550 --> 01:21:46,560
like even if it did not do that right if
 

5173
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:47,990
like even if it did not do that right if
you think about an ethereum ecosystem

5174
01:21:47,990 --> 01:21:48,000
you think about an ethereum ecosystem
 

5175
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,830
you think about an ethereum ecosystem
hypothetically scaling with side chains

5176
01:21:49,830 --> 01:21:49,840
hypothetically scaling with side chains
 

5177
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:50,229
hypothetically scaling with side chains
then

5178
01:21:50,229 --> 01:21:50,239
then
 

5179
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:51,590
then
you know you would have 100 copies of

5180
01:21:51,590 --> 01:21:51,600
you know you would have 100 copies of
 

5181
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:53,350
you know you would have 100 copies of
polygon and you know they would each

5182
01:21:53,350 --> 01:21:53,360
polygon and you know they would each
 

5183
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:54,470
polygon and you know they would each
have their own tokens they would each

5184
01:21:54,470 --> 01:21:54,480
have their own tokens they would each
 

5185
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:55,510
have their own tokens they would each
have their own chins

5186
01:21:55,510 --> 01:21:55,520
have their own chins
 

5187
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:57,510
have their own chins
and so even if each one of those chains

5188
01:21:57,510 --> 01:21:57,520
and so even if each one of those chains
 

5189
01:21:57,520 --> 01:21:59,590
and so even if each one of those chains
was only as scalable as ethereum

5190
01:21:59,590 --> 01:21:59,600
was only as scalable as ethereum
 

5191
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:01,910
was only as scalable as ethereum
you know you know you could still like

5192
01:22:01,910 --> 01:22:01,920
you know you know you could still like
 

5193
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:03,669
you know you know you could still like
the total sum of them would still be 100

5194
01:22:03,669 --> 01:22:03,679
the total sum of them would still be 100
 

5195
01:22:03,679 --> 01:22:05,030
the total sum of them would still be 100
times more than ethereum

5196
01:22:05,030 --> 01:22:05,040
times more than ethereum
 

5197
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:08,310
times more than ethereum
okay um the now the thing that i want to

5198
01:22:08,310 --> 01:22:08,320
okay um the now the thing that i want to
 

5199
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:10,790
okay um the now the thing that i want to
say in polygons favor just to be very

5200
01:22:10,790 --> 01:22:10,800
say in polygons favor just to be very
 

5201
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:13,910
say in polygons favor just to be very
fair to them like i i i really you know

5202
01:22:13,910 --> 01:22:13,920
fair to them like i i i really you know
 

5203
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:15,910
fair to them like i i i really you know
i i definitely really you know respect

5204
01:22:15,910 --> 01:22:15,920
i i definitely really you know respect
 

5205
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:17,350
i i definitely really you know respect
the work that they're doing so you know

5206
01:22:17,350 --> 01:22:17,360
the work that they're doing so you know
 

5207
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:19,110
the work that they're doing so you know
start with the um

5208
01:22:19,110 --> 01:22:19,120
start with the um
 

5209
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:22,870
start with the um
a bit with that word of uh not criticism

5210
01:22:22,870 --> 01:22:22,880
a bit with that word of uh not criticism
 

5211
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:24,149
a bit with that word of uh not criticism
caution right like it's

5212
01:22:24,149 --> 01:22:24,159
caution right like it's
 

5213
01:22:24,159 --> 01:22:27,430
caution right like it's
um that they made this

5214
01:22:27,430 --> 01:22:27,440
um that they made this
 

5215
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:29,430
um that they made this
kind of deliberate trade-off for very

5216
01:22:29,430 --> 01:22:29,440
kind of deliberate trade-off for very
 

5217
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:31,110
kind of deliberate trade-off for very
pragmatic reasons which is that

5218
01:22:31,110 --> 01:22:31,120
pragmatic reasons which is that
 

5219
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:32,709
pragmatic reasons which is that
the ethereum ecosystem needs to scale

5220
01:22:32,709 --> 01:22:32,719
the ethereum ecosystem needs to scale
 

5221
01:22:32,719 --> 01:22:34,390
the ethereum ecosystem needs to scale
now and there are applications that want

5222
01:22:34,390 --> 01:22:34,400
now and there are applications that want
 

5223
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:35,830
now and there are applications that want
to do something now

5224
01:22:35,830 --> 01:22:35,840
to do something now
 

5225
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:38,149
to do something now
and you know if there aren't ethereum

5226
01:22:38,149 --> 01:22:38,159
and you know if there aren't ethereum
 

5227
01:22:38,159 --> 01:22:39,669
and you know if there aren't ethereum
friendly options for them then

5228
01:22:39,669 --> 01:22:39,679
friendly options for them then
 

5229
01:22:39,679 --> 01:22:40,790
friendly options for them then
like they're not going to just wait

5230
01:22:40,790 --> 01:22:40,800
like they're not going to just wait
 

5231
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:42,550
like they're not going to just wait
peacefully and do nothing for 12 months

5232
01:22:42,550 --> 01:22:42,560
peacefully and do nothing for 12 months
 

5233
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,149
peacefully and do nothing for 12 months
you know they're going to go to

5234
01:22:44,149 --> 01:22:44,159
you know they're going to go to
 

5235
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:46,950
you know they're going to go to
you know either binance smart chain or

5236
01:22:46,950 --> 01:22:46,960
you know either binance smart chain or
 

5237
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:47,430
you know either binance smart chain or
you know

5238
01:22:47,430 --> 01:22:47,440
you know
 

5239
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:50,629
you know
one of some other system or potentially

5240
01:22:50,629 --> 01:22:50,639
one of some other system or potentially
 

5241
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:51,669
one of some other system or potentially
something that just has

5242
01:22:51,669 --> 01:22:51,679
something that just has
 

5243
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:53,350
something that just has
totally no alignment with ethereum

5244
01:22:53,350 --> 01:22:53,360
totally no alignment with ethereum
 

5245
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:54,709
totally no alignment with ethereum
values whatsoever

5246
01:22:54,709 --> 01:22:54,719
values whatsoever
 

5247
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:57,430
values whatsoever
um but whereas you know with paul with

5248
01:22:57,430 --> 01:22:57,440
um but whereas you know with paul with
 

5249
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:58,390
um but whereas you know with paul with
polygon like

5250
01:22:58,390 --> 01:22:58,400
polygon like
 

5251
01:22:58,400 --> 01:22:59,669
polygon like
the best thing that you can say in

5252
01:22:59,669 --> 01:22:59,679
the best thing that you can say in
 

5253
01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:02,149
the best thing that you can say in
polygons favor and against optimism is

5254
01:23:02,149 --> 01:23:02,159
polygons favor and against optimism is
 

5255
01:23:02,159 --> 01:23:03,750
polygons favor and against optimism is
that you know optimism is not live and

5256
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:03,760
that you know optimism is not live and
 

5257
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:04,870
that you know optimism is not live and
polygonal is life

5258
01:23:04,870 --> 01:23:04,880
polygonal is life
 

5259
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:07,510
polygonal is life
right like it just takes more work to

5260
01:23:07,510 --> 01:23:07,520
right like it just takes more work to
 

5261
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:09,110
right like it just takes more work to
create a system that has

5262
01:23:09,110 --> 01:23:09,120
create a system that has
 

5263
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:11,430
create a system that has
these extra roll-ups uh security

5264
01:23:11,430 --> 01:23:11,440
these extra roll-ups uh security
 

5265
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:12,229
these extra roll-ups uh security
features

5266
01:23:12,229 --> 01:23:12,239
features
 

5267
01:23:12,239 --> 01:23:14,310
features
and so polygon just said we're gonna be

5268
01:23:14,310 --> 01:23:14,320
and so polygon just said we're gonna be
 

5269
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:15,750
and so polygon just said we're gonna be
the system that makes the pragmatic

5270
01:23:15,750 --> 01:23:15,760
the system that makes the pragmatic
 

5271
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:17,990
the system that makes the pragmatic
tradeoff we're gonna go

5272
01:23:17,990 --> 01:23:18,000
tradeoff we're gonna go
 

5273
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,310
tradeoff we're gonna go
you know functionality first and then

5274
01:23:20,310 --> 01:23:20,320
you know functionality first and then
 

5275
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:21,669
you know functionality first and then
you know we can talk about adding back

5276
01:23:21,669 --> 01:23:21,679
you know we can talk about adding back
 

5277
01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:22,870
you know we can talk about adding back
the security later

5278
01:23:22,870 --> 01:23:22,880
the security later
 

5279
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:24,470
the security later
so i've talked to them and like in

5280
01:23:24,470 --> 01:23:24,480
so i've talked to them and like in
 

5281
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:25,910
so i've talked to them and like in
principle i think

5282
01:23:25,910 --> 01:23:25,920
principle i think
 

5283
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:28,709
principle i think
they're very you know open to the idea

5284
01:23:28,709 --> 01:23:28,719
they're very you know open to the idea
 

5285
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:29,910
they're very you know open to the idea
of like adding more

5286
01:23:29,910 --> 01:23:29,920
of like adding more
 

5287
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:32,870
of like adding more
more security and at least becoming more

5288
01:23:32,870 --> 01:23:32,880
more security and at least becoming more
 

5289
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:33,350
more security and at least becoming more
uh

5290
01:23:33,350 --> 01:23:33,360
uh
 

5291
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:35,990
uh
becoming a roll up or at least you know

5292
01:23:35,990 --> 01:23:36,000
becoming a roll up or at least you know
 

5293
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:36,470
becoming a roll up or at least you know
adding

5294
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:36,480
adding
 

5295
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:38,470
adding
a polygon chain let's say roll up at

5296
01:23:38,470 --> 01:23:38,480
a polygon chain let's say roll up at
 

5297
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:39,669
a polygon chain let's say roll up at
some point in the future

5298
01:23:39,669 --> 01:23:39,679
some point in the future
 

5299
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:41,189
some point in the future
which is definitely something i think

5300
01:23:41,189 --> 01:23:41,199
which is definitely something i think
 

5301
01:23:41,199 --> 01:23:42,870
which is definitely something i think
they yeah you know absolutely should

5302
01:23:42,870 --> 01:23:42,880
they yeah you know absolutely should
 

5303
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:43,990
they yeah you know absolutely should
follow through one

5304
01:23:43,990 --> 01:23:44,000
follow through one
 

5305
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,350
follow through one
but like the fact that like they exist

5306
01:23:47,350 --> 01:23:47,360
but like the fact that like they exist
 

5307
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:49,510
but like the fact that like they exist
now and so you know applications can

5308
01:23:49,510 --> 01:23:49,520
now and so you know applications can
 

5309
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:50,870
now and so you know applications can
kind of bootstrap now

5310
01:23:50,870 --> 01:23:50,880
kind of bootstrap now
 

5311
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:52,470
kind of bootstrap now
on a chain that you know even though

5312
01:23:52,470 --> 01:23:52,480
on a chain that you know even though
 

5313
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:53,990
on a chain that you know even though
it's security isn't perfect at least it

5314
01:23:53,990 --> 01:23:54,000
it's security isn't perfect at least it
 

5315
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,750
it's security isn't perfect at least it
exists and people can go use it um and

5316
01:23:55,750 --> 01:23:55,760
exists and people can go use it um and
 

5317
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:56,550
exists and people can go use it um and
then

5318
01:23:56,550 --> 01:23:56,560
then
 

5319
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:58,790
then
over time you know the chain matures as

5320
01:23:58,790 --> 01:23:58,800
over time you know the chain matures as
 

5321
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,870
over time you know the chain matures as
the applications mature like units

5322
01:24:00,870 --> 01:24:00,880
the applications mature like units
 

5323
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:03,189
the applications mature like units
i think of a very reasonable strategy

5324
01:24:03,189 --> 01:24:03,199
i think of a very reasonable strategy
 

5325
01:24:03,199 --> 01:24:04,310
i think of a very reasonable strategy
and i'm definitely

5326
01:24:04,310 --> 01:24:04,320
and i'm definitely
 

5327
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:05,270
and i'm definitely
really happy that they're part of the

5328
01:24:05,270 --> 01:24:05,280
really happy that they're part of the
 

5329
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:07,910
really happy that they're part of the
ecosystem

5330
01:24:07,910 --> 01:24:07,920
ecosystem
 

5331
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:09,830
ecosystem
yeah it's kind of interesting the

5332
01:24:09,830 --> 01:24:09,840
yeah it's kind of interesting the
 

5333
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:11,430
yeah it's kind of interesting the
history of cryptocurrency

5334
01:24:11,430 --> 01:24:11,440
history of cryptocurrency
 

5335
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:15,430
history of cryptocurrency
has this um tension of really good ideas

5336
01:24:15,430 --> 01:24:15,440
has this um tension of really good ideas
 

5337
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:17,669
has this um tension of really good ideas
that are hard to implement so they take

5338
01:24:17,669 --> 01:24:17,679
that are hard to implement so they take
 

5339
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:19,350
that are hard to implement so they take
longer to implement

5340
01:24:19,350 --> 01:24:19,360
longer to implement
 

5341
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:22,470
longer to implement
and ideas that are not as good but are

5342
01:24:22,470 --> 01:24:22,480
and ideas that are not as good but are
 

5343
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:23,990
and ideas that are not as good but are
faster to implement this is like the

5344
01:24:23,990 --> 01:24:24,000
faster to implement this is like the
 

5345
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,270
faster to implement this is like the
story of like

5346
01:24:25,270 --> 01:24:25,280
story of like
 

5347
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:26,950
story of like
you have like javascript that basically

5348
01:24:26,950 --> 01:24:26,960
you have like javascript that basically
 

5349
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:28,310
you have like javascript that basically
took over the world

5350
01:24:28,310 --> 01:24:28,320
took over the world
 

5351
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:30,149
took over the world
because it was quick to implement within

5352
01:24:30,149 --> 01:24:30,159
because it was quick to implement within
 

5353
01:24:30,159 --> 01:24:31,510
because it was quick to implement within
10 days

5354
01:24:31,510 --> 01:24:31,520
10 days
 

5355
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:34,950
10 days
and then like later kept fixing itself

5356
01:24:34,950 --> 01:24:34,960
and then like later kept fixing itself
 

5357
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:37,990
and then like later kept fixing itself
i i don't know what to make of that sort

5358
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:38,000
i i don't know what to make of that sort
 

5359
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,149
i i don't know what to make of that sort
of from an engineering perspective

5360
01:24:40,149 --> 01:24:40,159
of from an engineering perspective
 

5361
01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:42,310
of from an engineering perspective
i'm more and more becoming comfortable

5362
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:42,320
i'm more and more becoming comfortable
 

5363
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:43,990
i'm more and more becoming comfortable
and accepting the fact that our whole

5364
01:24:43,990 --> 01:24:44,000
and accepting the fact that our whole
 

5365
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,629
and accepting the fact that our whole
world will run a technology that's not

5366
01:24:46,629 --> 01:24:46,639
world will run a technology that's not
 

5367
01:24:46,639 --> 01:24:48,709
world will run a technology that's not
as good as it could have been

5368
01:24:48,709 --> 01:24:48,719
as good as it could have been
 

5369
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:51,030
as good as it could have been
just because the crappy solution is

5370
01:24:51,030 --> 01:24:51,040
just because the crappy solution is
 

5371
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:53,030
just because the crappy solution is
faster to implement and it sticks

5372
01:24:53,030 --> 01:24:53,040
faster to implement and it sticks
 

5373
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:55,590
faster to implement and it sticks
what do you make of that tension i think

5374
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:55,600
what do you make of that tension i think
 

5375
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:56,149
what do you make of that tension i think
the

5376
01:24:56,149 --> 01:24:56,159
the
 

5377
01:24:56,159 --> 01:24:58,070
the
compromise that we've been taking within

5378
01:24:58,070 --> 01:24:58,080
compromise that we've been taking within
 

5379
01:24:58,080 --> 01:24:59,350
compromise that we've been taking within
ethereum is

5380
01:24:59,350 --> 01:24:59,360
ethereum is
 

5381
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:01,030
ethereum is
like when we have to take the crappy

5382
01:25:01,030 --> 01:25:01,040
like when we have to take the crappy
 

5383
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:03,430
like when we have to take the crappy
solution we look for crappy solutions

5384
01:25:03,430 --> 01:25:03,440
solution we look for crappy solutions
 

5385
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:05,030
solution we look for crappy solutions
that are forward compatible with

5386
01:25:05,030 --> 01:25:05,040
that are forward compatible with
 

5387
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:06,709
that are forward compatible with
becoming good over time

5388
01:25:06,709 --> 01:25:06,719
becoming good over time
 

5389
01:25:06,719 --> 01:25:09,030
becoming good over time
right like when you build the the quick

5390
01:25:09,030 --> 01:25:09,040
right like when you build the the quick
 

5391
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:10,390
right like when you build the the quick
and dirty thing like you

5392
01:25:10,390 --> 01:25:10,400
and dirty thing like you
 

5393
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:12,550
and dirty thing like you
you would still already have ideas in

5394
01:25:12,550 --> 01:25:12,560
you would still already have ideas in
 

5395
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:13,430
you would still already have ideas in
your head about

5396
01:25:13,430 --> 01:25:13,440
your head about
 

5397
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:15,270
your head about
you know what the the more complete

5398
01:25:15,270 --> 01:25:15,280
you know what the the more complete
 

5399
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:16,790
you know what the the more complete
thing with all the security features

5400
01:25:16,790 --> 01:25:16,800
thing with all the security features
 

5401
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:18,470
thing with all the security features
added on would look like right even if

5402
01:25:18,470 --> 01:25:18,480
added on would look like right even if
 

5403
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,149
added on would look like right even if
it requires a hard fork

5404
01:25:20,149 --> 01:25:20,159
it requires a hard fork
 

5405
01:25:20,159 --> 01:25:23,189
it requires a hard fork
um yes like even so you know like for

5406
01:25:23,189 --> 01:25:23,199
um yes like even so you know like for
 

5407
01:25:23,199 --> 01:25:24,790
um yes like even so you know like for
example we're sharding right like well

5408
01:25:24,790 --> 01:25:24,800
example we're sharding right like well
 

5409
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:25,669
example we're sharding right like well
yeah i think

5410
01:25:25,669 --> 01:25:25,679
yeah i think
 

5411
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:27,750
yeah i think
it's likely that the first version of

5412
01:25:27,750 --> 01:25:27,760
it's likely that the first version of
 

5413
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:29,189
it's likely that the first version of
chardonnay that comes out like is not

5414
01:25:29,189 --> 01:25:29,199
chardonnay that comes out like is not
 

5415
01:25:29,199 --> 01:25:30,709
chardonnay that comes out like is not
going to have you know zk snarks and

5416
01:25:30,709 --> 01:25:30,719
going to have you know zk snarks and
 

5417
01:25:30,719 --> 01:25:32,709
going to have you know zk snarks and
data availability sampling for example

5418
01:25:32,709 --> 01:25:32,719
data availability sampling for example
 

5419
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:34,790
data availability sampling for example
but we know what these technologies are

5420
01:25:34,790 --> 01:25:34,800
but we know what these technologies are
 

5421
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:36,229
but we know what these technologies are
we feel like we

5422
01:25:36,229 --> 01:25:36,239
we feel like we
 

5423
01:25:36,239 --> 01:25:37,510
we feel like we
you know have wrapped our heads around

5424
01:25:37,510 --> 01:25:37,520
you know have wrapped our heads around
 

5425
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:39,830
you know have wrapped our heads around
them and so we know how to build a

5426
01:25:39,830 --> 01:25:39,840
them and so we know how to build a
 

5427
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:40,629
them and so we know how to build a
system

5428
01:25:40,629 --> 01:25:40,639
system
 

5429
01:25:40,639 --> 01:25:42,470
system
where we can put all the pieces in place

5430
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:42,480
where we can put all the pieces in place
 

5431
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:44,229
where we can put all the pieces in place
so that it becomes very easy to bolt

5432
01:25:44,229 --> 01:25:44,239
so that it becomes very easy to bolt
 

5433
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:46,149
so that it becomes very easy to bolt
those components on in the future

5434
01:25:46,149 --> 01:25:46,159
those components on in the future
 

5435
01:25:46,159 --> 01:25:48,629
those components on in the future
uh so like if you do things that way

5436
01:25:48,629 --> 01:25:48,639
uh so like if you do things that way
 

5437
01:25:48,639 --> 01:25:49,350
uh so like if you do things that way
right then

5438
01:25:49,350 --> 01:25:49,360
right then
 

5439
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:51,189
right then
at the beginning you can have your

5440
01:25:51,189 --> 01:25:51,199
at the beginning you can have your
 

5441
01:25:51,199 --> 01:25:53,189
at the beginning you can have your
system that has the functionality but

5442
01:25:53,189 --> 01:25:53,199
system that has the functionality but
 

5443
01:25:53,199 --> 01:25:55,750
system that has the functionality but
say has less security or like less

5444
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:55,760
say has less security or like less
 

5445
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:58,070
say has less security or like less
sustainability or less of something else

5446
01:25:58,070 --> 01:25:58,080
sustainability or less of something else
 

5447
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:01,669
sustainability or less of something else
but then over time like it's designed in

5448
01:26:01,669 --> 01:26:01,679
but then over time like it's designed in
 

5449
01:26:01,679 --> 01:26:03,510
but then over time like it's designed in
such a way that it has this easy on

5450
01:26:03,510 --> 01:26:03,520
such a way that it has this easy on
 

5451
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,189
such a way that it has this easy on
on-ramp to adding those things

5452
01:26:05,189 --> 01:26:05,199
on-ramp to adding those things
 

5453
01:26:05,199 --> 01:26:06,950
on-ramp to adding those things
right and if you don't think explicitly

5454
01:26:06,950 --> 01:26:06,960
right and if you don't think explicitly
 

5455
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:09,030
right and if you don't think explicitly
about like being future compatible then

5456
01:26:09,030 --> 01:26:09,040
about like being future compatible then
 

5457
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:11,750
about like being future compatible then
you do often end up with a a quick and

5458
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:11,760
you do often end up with a a quick and
 

5459
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:13,270
you do often end up with a a quick and
dirty solution that backs you into a

5460
01:26:13,270 --> 01:26:13,280
dirty solution that backs you into a
 

5461
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:13,910
dirty solution that backs you into a
corner

5462
01:26:13,910 --> 01:26:13,920
corner
 

5463
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:15,830
corner
and then there are definitely cases

5464
01:26:15,830 --> 01:26:15,840
and then there are definitely cases
 

5465
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:16,950
and then there are definitely cases
where like i think the ethereum

5466
01:26:16,950 --> 01:26:16,960
where like i think the ethereum
 

5467
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:18,470
where like i think the ethereum
ecosystem has suffered from that and we

5468
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:18,480
ecosystem has suffered from that and we
 

5469
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:19,350
ecosystem has suffered from that and we
have had to

5470
01:26:19,350 --> 01:26:19,360
have had to
 

5471
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:22,870
have had to
like expand pretty significant effort

5472
01:26:22,870 --> 01:26:22,880
like expand pretty significant effort
 

5473
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:25,750
like expand pretty significant effort
on for example removing features that we

5474
01:26:25,750 --> 01:26:25,760
on for example removing features that we
 

5475
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:26,790
on for example removing features that we
didn't realize

5476
01:26:26,790 --> 01:26:26,800
didn't realize
 

5477
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:29,990
didn't realize
that we actually can't sustain like one

5478
01:26:29,990 --> 01:26:30,000
that we actually can't sustain like one
 

5479
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,070
that we actually can't sustain like one
big example is just increasing the yeah

5480
01:26:32,070 --> 01:26:32,080
big example is just increasing the yeah
 

5481
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:34,070
big example is just increasing the yeah
the gas costs so like making some

5482
01:26:34,070 --> 01:26:34,080
the gas costs so like making some
 

5483
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:36,470
the gas costs so like making some
operations more expensive when they uh

5484
01:26:36,470 --> 01:26:36,480
operations more expensive when they uh
 

5485
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:37,750
operations more expensive when they uh
because they should be expensive because

5486
01:26:37,750 --> 01:26:37,760
because they should be expensive because
 

5487
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:39,030
because they should be expensive because
they actually take a lot of time in the

5488
01:26:39,030 --> 01:26:39,040
they actually take a lot of time in the
 

5489
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:39,750
they actually take a lot of time in the
process

5490
01:26:39,750 --> 01:26:39,760
process
 

5491
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:42,870
process
and um so that's you know making a thing

5492
01:26:42,870 --> 01:26:42,880
and um so that's you know making a thing
 

5493
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:44,470
and um so that's you know making a thing
some things more expensive kind of like

5494
01:26:44,470 --> 01:26:44,480
some things more expensive kind of like
 

5495
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:46,310
some things more expensive kind of like
taking some functionality away

5496
01:26:46,310 --> 01:26:46,320
taking some functionality away
 

5497
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:49,910
taking some functionality away
um so if you can like be cognizant of

5498
01:26:49,910 --> 01:26:49,920
um so if you can like be cognizant of
 

5499
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:50,470
um so if you can like be cognizant of
where

5500
01:26:50,470 --> 01:26:50,480
where
 

5501
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:52,149
where
you're likely going into the future and

5502
01:26:52,149 --> 01:26:52,159
you're likely going into the future and
 

5503
01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:53,910
you're likely going into the future and
if you don't know like even be cognizant

5504
01:26:53,910 --> 01:26:53,920
if you don't know like even be cognizant
 

5505
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:55,350
if you don't know like even be cognizant
of both the most likely paths that

5506
01:26:55,350 --> 01:26:55,360
of both the most likely paths that
 

5507
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:56,629
of both the most likely paths that
you'll take in the future

5508
01:26:56,629 --> 01:26:56,639
you'll take in the future
 

5509
01:26:56,639 --> 01:26:58,950
you'll take in the future
and coming like thinking about your road

5510
01:26:58,950 --> 01:26:58,960
and coming like thinking about your road
 

5511
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:00,870
and coming like thinking about your road
map and coming up with a road map where

5512
01:27:00,870 --> 01:27:00,880
map and coming up with a road map where
 

5513
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:03,430
map and coming up with a road map where
you know that like if you wants to do

5514
01:27:03,430 --> 01:27:03,440
you know that like if you wants to do
 

5515
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:04,790
you know that like if you wants to do
either of those things then you have a

5516
01:27:04,790 --> 01:27:04,800
either of those things then you have a
 

5517
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:06,470
either of those things then you have a
clean path toward it

5518
01:27:06,470 --> 01:27:06,480
clean path toward it
 

5519
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:08,310
clean path toward it
that's probably the best kind of

5520
01:27:08,310 --> 01:27:08,320
that's probably the best kind of
 

5521
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:09,910
that's probably the best kind of
practical way to get the best of both

5522
01:27:09,910 --> 01:27:09,920
practical way to get the best of both
 

5523
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:11,910
practical way to get the best of both
worlds that we have

5524
01:27:11,910 --> 01:27:11,920
worlds that we have
 

5525
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:14,870
worlds that we have
okay let's talk about this uh wonderful

5526
01:27:14,870 --> 01:27:14,880
okay let's talk about this uh wonderful
 

5527
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:16,830
okay let's talk about this uh wonderful
process of

5528
01:27:16,830 --> 01:27:16,840
process of
 

5529
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:19,030
process of
merging

5530
01:27:19,030 --> 01:27:19,040
merging
 

5531
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:22,149
merging
okay so there's the main net

5532
01:27:22,149 --> 01:27:22,159
okay so there's the main net
 

5533
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:25,350
okay so there's the main net
which is the ethereum 1.0 chain or the

5534
01:27:25,350 --> 01:27:25,360
which is the ethereum 1.0 chain or the
 

5535
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:26,629
which is the ethereum 1.0 chain or the
ch

5536
01:27:26,629 --> 01:27:26,639
ch
 

5537
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:28,310
ch
what should we say the chain that uses

5538
01:27:28,310 --> 01:27:28,320
what should we say the chain that uses
 

5539
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:30,870
what should we say the chain that uses
proof of work as a consensus mechanism

5540
01:27:30,870 --> 01:27:30,880
proof of work as a consensus mechanism
 

5541
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:33,430
proof of work as a consensus mechanism
and then there is uh what is it called

5542
01:27:33,430 --> 01:27:33,440
and then there is uh what is it called
 

5543
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:35,430
and then there is uh what is it called
the the beacon chain

5544
01:27:35,430 --> 01:27:35,440
the the beacon chain
 

5545
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:38,470
the the beacon chain
that uses the uh the

5546
01:27:38,470 --> 01:27:38,480
that uses the uh the
 

5547
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:41,750
that uses the uh the
proof of stake mechanism and i believe

5548
01:27:41,750 --> 01:27:41,760
proof of stake mechanism and i believe
 

5549
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:43,189
proof of stake mechanism and i believe
the

5550
01:27:43,189 --> 01:27:43,199
the
 

5551
01:27:43,199 --> 01:27:45,590
the
beacon has been deployed successfully is

5552
01:27:45,590 --> 01:27:45,600
beacon has been deployed successfully is
 

5553
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:46,550
beacon has been deployed successfully is
is working

5554
01:27:46,550 --> 01:27:46,560
is working
 

5555
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:49,189
is working
so that was in december 2020 there's a

5556
01:27:49,189 --> 01:27:49,199
so that was in december 2020 there's a
 

5557
01:27:49,199 --> 01:27:50,550
so that was in december 2020 there's a
bunch of questions around that that's

5558
01:27:50,550 --> 01:27:50,560
bunch of questions around that that's
 

5559
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:52,149
bunch of questions around that that's
fascinating as well but

5560
01:27:52,149 --> 01:27:52,159
fascinating as well but
 

5561
01:27:52,159 --> 01:27:54,550
fascinating as well but
i think the most fascinating question is

5562
01:27:54,550 --> 01:27:54,560
i think the most fascinating question is
 

5563
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:55,830
i think the most fascinating question is
um

5564
01:27:55,830 --> 01:27:55,840
um
 

5565
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:59,510
um
it's about merging those two when do

5566
01:27:59,510 --> 01:27:59,520
it's about merging those two when do
 

5567
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:03,270
it's about merging those two when do
the two chains one that's proof of work

5568
01:28:03,270 --> 01:28:03,280
the two chains one that's proof of work
 

5569
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:04,790
the two chains one that's proof of work
one that's proof of stake

5570
01:28:04,790 --> 01:28:04,800
one that's proof of stake
 

5571
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:07,990
one that's proof of stake
merge and what are the most difficult

5572
01:28:07,990 --> 01:28:08,000
merge and what are the most difficult
 

5573
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:11,350
merge and what are the most difficult
parts of this process right so i guess

5574
01:28:11,350 --> 01:28:11,360
parts of this process right so i guess
 

5575
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:13,590
parts of this process right so i guess
you've said right the way that we if i

5576
01:28:13,590 --> 01:28:13,600
you've said right the way that we if i
 

5577
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:15,830
you've said right the way that we if i
set up this proof of stake transition is

5578
01:28:15,830 --> 01:28:15,840
set up this proof of stake transition is
 

5579
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:17,110
set up this proof of stake transition is
that at first

5580
01:28:17,110 --> 01:28:17,120
that at first
 

5581
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:18,790
that at first
the proof of stake chain just launches

5582
01:28:18,790 --> 01:28:18,800
the proof of stake chain just launches
 

5583
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:20,229
the proof of stake chain just launches
on its own right and this is the thing

5584
01:28:20,229 --> 01:28:20,239
on its own right and this is the thing
 

5585
01:28:20,239 --> 01:28:20,950
on its own right and this is the thing
that happened

5586
01:28:20,950 --> 01:28:20,960
that happened
 

5587
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:23,669
that happened
in december and the proof of stake chain

5588
01:28:23,669 --> 01:28:23,679
in december and the proof of stake chain
 

5589
01:28:23,679 --> 01:28:24,550
in december and the proof of stake chain
has been

5590
01:28:24,550 --> 01:28:24,560
has been
 

5591
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:27,669
has been
running for close to six months uh

5592
01:28:27,669 --> 01:28:27,679
running for close to six months uh
 

5593
01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:29,990
running for close to six months uh
now um i mean by the time people watch

5594
01:28:29,990 --> 01:28:30,000
now um i mean by the time people watch
 

5595
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,910
now um i mean by the time people watch
this it might actually be six months

5596
01:28:31,910 --> 01:28:31,920
this it might actually be six months
 

5597
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:34,790
this it might actually be six months
um and but it isn't actually coming to

5598
01:28:34,790 --> 01:28:34,800
um and but it isn't actually coming to
 

5599
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:36,790
um and but it isn't actually coming to
consensus on anything except for itself

5600
01:28:36,790 --> 01:28:36,800
consensus on anything except for itself
 

5601
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:37,430
consensus on anything except for itself
right

5602
01:28:37,430 --> 01:28:37,440
right
 

5603
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:40,310
right
so the idea behind that is to just give

5604
01:28:40,310 --> 01:28:40,320
so the idea behind that is to just give
 

5605
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:42,390
so the idea behind that is to just give
the proof of stake chain time

5606
01:28:42,390 --> 01:28:42,400
the proof of stake chain time
 

5607
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:44,390
the proof of stake chain time
to mature time for people to build the

5608
01:28:44,390 --> 01:28:44,400
to mature time for people to build the
 

5609
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:45,990
to mature time for people to build the
ecosystem around it time to make sure

5610
01:28:45,990 --> 01:28:46,000
ecosystem around it time to make sure
 

5611
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,510
ecosystem around it time to make sure
that there aren't any bugs

5612
01:28:47,510 --> 01:28:47,520
that there aren't any bugs
 

5613
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:49,510
that there aren't any bugs
um and just like prove to the community

5614
01:28:49,510 --> 01:28:49,520
um and just like prove to the community
 

5615
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:51,110
um and just like prove to the community
that you know proof of stake actually is

5616
01:28:51,110 --> 01:28:51,120
that you know proof of stake actually is
 

5617
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:52,550
that you know proof of stake actually is
real and it's

5618
01:28:52,550 --> 01:28:52,560
real and it's
 

5619
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:55,510
real and it's
and a full transition is realistic

5620
01:28:55,510 --> 01:28:55,520
and a full transition is realistic
 

5621
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:56,550
and a full transition is realistic
because you know the thing that you're

5622
01:28:56,550 --> 01:28:56,560
because you know the thing that you're
 

5623
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:57,510
because you know the thing that you're
transitioning to

5624
01:28:57,510 --> 01:28:57,520
transitioning to
 

5625
01:28:57,520 --> 01:28:59,430
transitioning to
already exists and already works and

5626
01:28:59,430 --> 01:28:59,440
already exists and already works and
 

5627
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:01,030
already exists and already works and
then at some point in the future

5628
01:29:01,030 --> 01:29:01,040
then at some point in the future
 

5629
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:02,950
then at some point in the future
you have this event called the merge

5630
01:29:02,950 --> 01:29:02,960
you have this event called the merge
 

5631
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:04,790
you have this event called the merge
where you basically

5632
01:29:04,790 --> 01:29:04,800
where you basically
 

5633
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:06,550
where you basically
take the activity that's being done

5634
01:29:06,550 --> 01:29:06,560
take the activity that's being done
 

5635
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:07,910
take the activity that's being done
inside of the proof of work chain

5636
01:29:07,910 --> 01:29:07,920
inside of the proof of work chain
 

5637
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:09,430
inside of the proof of work chain
and you actually move it over into the

5638
01:29:09,430 --> 01:29:09,440
and you actually move it over into the
 

5639
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:10,950
and you actually move it over into the
proof of stake chain so you get rid of

5640
01:29:10,950 --> 01:29:10,960
proof of stake chain so you get rid of
 

5641
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:12,950
proof of stake chain so you get rid of
the proof of work side completely

5642
01:29:12,950 --> 01:29:12,960
the proof of work side completely
 

5643
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:16,709
the proof of work side completely
uh so the way that the merge

5644
01:29:16,709 --> 01:29:16,719
uh so the way that the merge
 

5645
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:20,310
uh so the way that the merge
will work is um and it's definitely gone

5646
01:29:20,310 --> 01:29:20,320
will work is um and it's definitely gone
 

5647
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:22,470
will work is um and it's definitely gone
through a few different iterations like

5648
01:29:22,470 --> 01:29:22,480
through a few different iterations like
 

5649
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:24,790
through a few different iterations like
the the earlier versions of this

5650
01:29:24,790 --> 01:29:24,800
the the earlier versions of this
 

5651
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:26,629
the the earlier versions of this
actually required more work for users

5652
01:29:26,629 --> 01:29:26,639
actually required more work for users
 

5653
01:29:26,639 --> 01:29:28,229
actually required more work for users
and more work for clients it was much

5654
01:29:28,229 --> 01:29:28,239
and more work for clients it was much
 

5655
01:29:28,239 --> 01:29:29,030
and more work for clients it was much
more like

5656
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:29,040
more like
 

5657
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:30,390
more like
oh there's this new chain there's this

5658
01:29:30,390 --> 01:29:30,400
oh there's this new chain there's this
 

5659
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:32,070
oh there's this new chain there's this
old chain and then

5660
01:29:32,070 --> 01:29:32,080
old chain and then
 

5661
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:33,750
old chain and then
everyone has to like migrate from the

5662
01:29:33,750 --> 01:29:33,760
everyone has to like migrate from the
 

5663
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:35,270
everyone has to like migrate from the
old chain to the new chain and then at

5664
01:29:35,270 --> 01:29:35,280
old chain to the new chain and then at
 

5665
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:36,629
old chain to the new chain and then at
some point we'll forget about the old

5666
01:29:36,629 --> 01:29:36,639
some point we'll forget about the old
 

5667
01:29:36,639 --> 01:29:37,270
some point we'll forget about the old
chin

5668
01:29:37,270 --> 01:29:37,280
chin
 

5669
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:40,470
chin
the new version is designed to be

5670
01:29:40,470 --> 01:29:40,480
the new version is designed to be
 

5671
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:43,590
the new version is designed to be
much more seamless for users right so

5672
01:29:43,590 --> 01:29:43,600
much more seamless for users right so
 

5673
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:45,110
much more seamless for users right so
basically what actually happens

5674
01:29:45,110 --> 01:29:45,120
basically what actually happens
 

5675
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:48,629
basically what actually happens
is that the old chain basically becomes

5676
01:29:48,629 --> 01:29:48,639
is that the old chain basically becomes
 

5677
01:29:48,639 --> 01:29:49,270
is that the old chain basically becomes
embedded

5678
01:29:49,270 --> 01:29:49,280
embedded
 

5679
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:51,750
embedded
inside the new chain right so at

5680
01:29:51,750 --> 01:29:51,760
inside the new chain right so at
 

5681
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:54,550
inside the new chain right so at
starting from the merge transition block

5682
01:29:54,550 --> 01:29:54,560
starting from the merge transition block
 

5683
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:56,950
starting from the merge transition block
every proof of stake chain block is

5684
01:29:56,950 --> 01:29:56,960
every proof of stake chain block is
 

5685
01:29:56,960 --> 01:29:59,189
every proof of stake chain block is
going to contain a block of

5686
01:29:59,189 --> 01:29:59,199
going to contain a block of
 

5687
01:29:59,199 --> 01:30:01,669
going to contain a block of
the what what we consider now to what we

5688
01:30:01,669 --> 01:30:01,679
the what what we consider now to what we
 

5689
01:30:01,679 --> 01:30:03,510
the what what we consider now to what we
consider to be the ethereum chain today

5690
01:30:03,510 --> 01:30:03,520
consider to be the ethereum chain today
 

5691
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:05,590
consider to be the ethereum chain today
but we'll call it the execution chain

5692
01:30:05,590 --> 01:30:05,600
but we'll call it the execution chain
 

5693
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:07,110
but we'll call it the execution chain
and then at the same time

5694
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:07,120
and then at the same time
 

5695
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:08,629
and then at the same time
to create one of these blocks you're not

5696
01:30:08,629 --> 01:30:08,639
to create one of these blocks you're not
 

5697
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:10,229
to create one of these blocks you're not
going to need proof of work anymore

5698
01:30:10,229 --> 01:30:10,239
going to need proof of work anymore
 

5699
01:30:10,239 --> 01:30:12,310
going to need proof of work anymore
right so basically at the same time you

5700
01:30:12,310 --> 01:30:12,320
right so basically at the same time you
 

5701
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:14,310
right so basically at the same time you
would both get rid of the proof of work

5702
01:30:14,310 --> 01:30:14,320
would both get rid of the proof of work
 

5703
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:15,669
would both get rid of the proof of work
requirements for one of these blocks to

5704
01:30:15,669 --> 01:30:15,679
requirements for one of these blocks to
 

5705
01:30:15,679 --> 01:30:16,390
requirements for one of these blocks to
be valid

5706
01:30:16,390 --> 01:30:16,400
be valid
 

5707
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:18,870
be valid
but instead you require these blocks to

5708
01:30:18,870 --> 01:30:18,880
but instead you require these blocks to
 

5709
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:20,070
but instead you require these blocks to
be embedded inside

5710
01:30:20,070 --> 01:30:20,080
be embedded inside
 

5711
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:21,510
be embedded inside
of the proof of stake blocks right so

5712
01:30:21,510 --> 01:30:21,520
of the proof of stake blocks right so
 

5713
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:23,110
of the proof of stake blocks right so
you basically have like a chain inside a

5714
01:30:23,110 --> 01:30:23,120
you basically have like a chain inside a
 

5715
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:23,910
you basically have like a chain inside a
chain

5716
01:30:23,910 --> 01:30:23,920
chain
 

5717
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:26,070
chain
and this is you know from an

5718
01:30:26,070 --> 01:30:26,080
and this is you know from an
 

5719
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:28,070
and this is you know from an
architecture perspective it's you know

5720
01:30:28,070 --> 01:30:28,080
architecture perspective it's you know
 

5721
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:29,189
architecture perspective it's you know
you might think it's a little bit

5722
01:30:29,189 --> 01:30:29,199
you might think it's a little bit
 

5723
01:30:29,199 --> 01:30:31,350
you might think it's a little bit
sub-optimal but it actually has some

5724
01:30:31,350 --> 01:30:31,360
sub-optimal but it actually has some
 

5725
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:32,870
sub-optimal but it actually has some
nice properties and makes it

5726
01:30:32,870 --> 01:30:32,880
nice properties and makes it
 

5727
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:34,310
nice properties and makes it
easier to kind of think about the

5728
01:30:34,310 --> 01:30:34,320
easier to kind of think about the
 

5729
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:36,229
easier to kind of think about the
consensus and think about

5730
01:30:36,229 --> 01:30:36,239
consensus and think about
 

5731
01:30:36,239 --> 01:30:37,910
consensus and think about
the what we call the execution layer

5732
01:30:37,910 --> 01:30:37,920
the what we call the execution layer
 

5733
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:39,910
the what we call the execution layer
like transactions and contracts kind of

5734
01:30:39,910 --> 01:30:39,920
like transactions and contracts kind of
 

5735
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:40,629
like transactions and contracts kind of
separately

5736
01:30:40,629 --> 01:30:40,639
separately
 

5737
01:30:40,639 --> 01:30:43,750
separately
and upgrade them separately um and

5738
01:30:43,750 --> 01:30:43,760
and upgrade them separately um and
 

5739
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:45,990
and upgrade them separately um and
it also just means that the upgrade

5740
01:30:45,990 --> 01:30:46,000
it also just means that the upgrade
 

5741
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,590
it also just means that the upgrade
process is extremely seamless right

5742
01:30:47,590 --> 01:30:47,600
process is extremely seamless right
 

5743
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:48,310
process is extremely seamless right
because

5744
01:30:48,310 --> 01:30:48,320
because
 

5745
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:49,669
because
from the point of view of a client

5746
01:30:49,669 --> 01:30:49,679
from the point of view of a client
 

5747
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:51,270
from the point of view of a client
that's following the chain you basically

5748
01:30:51,270 --> 01:30:51,280
that's following the chain you basically
 

5749
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:51,669
that's following the chain you basically
have to

5750
01:30:51,669 --> 01:30:51,679
have to
 

5751
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:54,070
have to
up update nothing right you're still

5752
01:30:54,070 --> 01:30:54,080
up update nothing right you're still
 

5753
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:54,870
up update nothing right you're still
following

5754
01:30:54,870 --> 01:30:54,880
following
 

5755
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:56,310
following
the same chain and follows the same

5756
01:30:56,310 --> 01:30:56,320
the same chain and follows the same
 

5757
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:58,310
the same chain and follows the same
rules except instead of checking proof

5758
01:30:58,310 --> 01:30:58,320
rules except instead of checking proof
 

5759
01:30:58,320 --> 01:30:59,830
rules except instead of checking proof
of work you'll switch to

5760
01:30:59,830 --> 01:30:59,840
of work you'll switch to
 

5761
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:01,510
of work you'll switch to
checking that these blocks are embedded

5762
01:31:01,510 --> 01:31:01,520
checking that these blocks are embedded
 

5763
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:03,270
checking that these blocks are embedded
inside of blocks of the proof statute

5764
01:31:03,270 --> 01:31:03,280
inside of blocks of the proof statute
 

5765
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:05,990
inside of blocks of the proof statute
so there'll be this merge block that

5766
01:31:05,990 --> 01:31:06,000
so there'll be this merge block that
 

5767
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,070
so there'll be this merge block that
will mark this transition

5768
01:31:08,070 --> 01:31:08,080
will mark this transition
 

5769
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:11,030
will mark this transition
and over time i guess the the new chain

5770
01:31:11,030 --> 01:31:11,040
and over time i guess the the new chain
 

5771
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:12,310
and over time i guess the the new chain
will contain the full

5772
01:31:12,310 --> 01:31:12,320
will contain the full
 

5773
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:14,629
will contain the full
record of all the transactions that's

5774
01:31:14,629 --> 01:31:14,639
record of all the transactions that's
 

5775
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:16,390
record of all the transactions that's
ever happened on the previous chain

5776
01:31:16,390 --> 01:31:16,400
ever happened on the previous chain
 

5777
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:19,590
ever happened on the previous chain
on the old chain so like maybe i'm

5778
01:31:19,590 --> 01:31:19,600
on the old chain so like maybe i'm
 

5779
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:21,750
on the old chain so like maybe i'm
asking a dumb question here but

5780
01:31:21,750 --> 01:31:21,760
asking a dumb question here but
 

5781
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:24,390
asking a dumb question here but
in in this process is the new chain

5782
01:31:24,390 --> 01:31:24,400
in in this process is the new chain
 

5783
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:25,510
in in this process is the new chain
going to have

5784
01:31:25,510 --> 01:31:25,520
going to have
 

5785
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:27,910
going to have
all the information of the past

5786
01:31:27,910 --> 01:31:27,920
all the information of the past
 

5787
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:29,030
all the information of the past
transactions

5788
01:31:29,030 --> 01:31:29,040
transactions
 

5789
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:32,470
transactions
the new chain is not going to hold

5790
01:31:32,470 --> 01:31:32,480
the new chain is not going to hold
 

5791
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:34,790
the new chain is not going to hold
information from what happened in the

5792
01:31:34,790 --> 01:31:34,800
information from what happened in the
 

5793
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:36,550
information from what happened in the
ethereum chain before the merge

5794
01:31:36,550 --> 01:31:36,560
ethereum chain before the merge
 

5795
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:40,229
ethereum chain before the merge
right so like ethereum clients of the um

5796
01:31:40,229 --> 01:31:40,239
right so like ethereum clients of the um
 

5797
01:31:40,239 --> 01:31:43,430
right so like ethereum clients of the um
that um people are going to use like

5798
01:31:43,430 --> 01:31:43,440
that um people are going to use like
 

5799
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:44,870
that um people are going to use like
around the time of the merchants soon

5800
01:31:44,870 --> 01:31:44,880
around the time of the merchants soon
 

5801
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:45,750
around the time of the merchants soon
after the merge

5802
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:45,760
after the merge
 

5803
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:47,430
after the merge
they're probably just going to sync you

5804
01:31:47,430 --> 01:31:47,440
they're probably just going to sync you
 

5805
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:49,189
they're probably just going to sync you
know like and check the proof of work

5806
01:31:49,189 --> 01:31:49,199
know like and check the proof of work
 

5807
01:31:49,199 --> 01:31:49,750
know like and check the proof of work
chain

5808
01:31:49,750 --> 01:31:49,760
chain
 

5809
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:50,870
chain
up to the merge and then they're going

5810
01:31:50,870 --> 01:31:50,880
up to the merge and then they're going
 

5811
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:52,550
up to the merge and then they're going
to check the proof of stake chain but at

5812
01:31:52,550 --> 01:31:52,560
to check the proof of stake chain but at
 

5813
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:53,990
to check the proof of stake chain but at
some point in the future i think people

5814
01:31:53,990 --> 01:31:54,000
some point in the future i think people
 

5815
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,430
some point in the future i think people
will just stop bothering checking the

5816
01:31:55,430 --> 01:31:55,440
will just stop bothering checking the
 

5817
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:57,110
will just stop bothering checking the
proof of work before the merge

5818
01:31:57,110 --> 01:31:57,120
proof of work before the merge
 

5819
01:31:57,120 --> 01:31:59,350
proof of work before the merge
got it so that old history information

5820
01:31:59,350 --> 01:31:59,360
got it so that old history information
 

5821
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,189
got it so that old history information
is not important

5822
01:32:01,189 --> 01:32:01,199
is not important
 

5823
01:32:01,199 --> 01:32:02,790
is not important
for the future or like if you're

5824
01:32:02,790 --> 01:32:02,800
for the future or like if you're
 

5825
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:04,950
for the future or like if you're
operating actively on the

important to you
it's not impo let's see so it's not

01:32:11,430 --> 01:32:11,440
it's not impo let's see so it's not
 

5833
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:12,870
it's not impo let's see so it's not
strictly important for

01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:22,070
applications that run on the blockchain
it can be important to users and it can

01:32:22,070 --> 01:32:22,080
it can be important to users and it can
 

5843
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:23,990
it can be important to users and it can
be important for some applications

be important for some applications
 

5845
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,390
be important for some applications
but we're basically saying that like

5846
01:32:26,390 --> 01:32:26,400
but we're basically saying that like
 

5847
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:28,149
but we're basically saying that like
maintaining and serving that

5848
01:32:28,149 --> 01:32:28,159
maintaining and serving that
 

5849
01:32:28,159 --> 01:32:30,149
maintaining and serving that
is not going to be simultaneously the

5850
01:32:30,149 --> 01:32:30,159
is not going to be simultaneously the
 

5851
01:32:30,159 --> 01:32:32,149
is not going to be simultaneously the

if you want that information there can

5854
01:32:33,990 --> 01:32:34,000
if you want that information there can
 

5855
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,149
if you want that information there can
be separate protocols for backing it up

5856
01:32:36,149 --> 01:32:36,159
be separate protocols for backing it up
 

5857
01:32:36,159 --> 01:32:37,750
be separate protocols for backing it up
and like these other protocols actually

5858
01:32:37,750 --> 01:32:37,760
and like these other protocols actually
 

5859
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:39,350
and like these other protocols actually
exist right like there's something

5860
01:32:39,350 --> 01:32:39,360
exist right like there's something
 

5861
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:40,070
exist right like there's something
called the graph

5862
01:32:40,070 --> 01:32:40,080
called the graph
 

5863
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:41,990
called the graph
which is doing some history retrieval

5864
01:32:41,990 --> 01:32:42,000
which is doing some history retrieval
 

5865
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,270
which is doing some history retrieval
potentially you can just take that

5866
01:32:43,270 --> 01:32:43,280
potentially you can just take that
 

5867
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:45,030
potentially you can just take that
entire chain and stick it on bit torrent

5868
01:32:45,030 --> 01:32:45,040
entire chain and stick it on bit torrent
 

5869
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:45,430
entire chain and stick it on bit torrent
like

5870
01:32:45,430 --> 01:32:45,440
like
 

5871
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:48,550
like
there's lots of ways to like archive it

5872
01:32:48,550 --> 01:32:48,560
there's lots of ways to like archive it
 

5873
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:49,830
there's lots of ways to like archive it
and create kind of customized search

5874
01:32:49,830 --> 01:32:49,840
and create kind of customized search
 

5875
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:51,030
and create kind of customized search
protocols for it

5876
01:32:51,030 --> 01:32:51,040
protocols for it
 

5877
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:53,830
protocols for it
so what's your sense why so there's a

5878
01:32:53,830 --> 01:32:53,840
so what's your sense why so there's a
 

5879
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:56,550
so what's your sense why so there's a
python 2 in python 3 and it took 4

5880
01:32:56,550 --> 01:32:56,560
python 2 in python 3 and it took 4
 

5881
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:59,189
python 2 in python 3 and it took 4
ever for people to switch what's your

01:32:59,189 --> 01:32:59,199
ever for people to switch what's your
 

5883
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:00,070
ever for people to switch what's your
sense why this

5884
01:33:00,070 --> 01:33:00,080
sense why this
 

5885
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:02,950
sense why this
merge has been taking longer than

5886
01:33:02,950 --> 01:33:02,960
merge has been taking longer than
 

5887
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:05,270
merge has been taking longer than
perhaps was expected

5888
01:33:05,270 --> 01:33:05,280
perhaps was expected
 

5889
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:07,750
perhaps was expected
i think the biggest reason is just you

5890
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:07,760
i think the biggest reason is just you
 

5891
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:08,709
i think the biggest reason is just you
know we've been

5892
01:33:08,709 --> 01:33:08,719
know we've been
 

5893
01:33:08,719 --> 01:33:10,870
know we've been
underestimating the technical complexity

5894
01:33:10,870 --> 01:33:10,880
underestimating the technical complexity
 

5895
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:12,470
underestimating the technical complexity
there's a lot of technical complexity in

5896
01:33:12,470 --> 01:33:12,480
there's a lot of technical complexity in
 

5897
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:14,390
there's a lot of technical complexity in
making a successful proof of stake chain

5898
01:33:14,390 --> 01:33:14,400
making a successful proof of stake chain
 

5899
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:17,510
making a successful proof of stake chain
there's a lot of technical complexity in

5900
01:33:17,510 --> 01:33:17,520
there's a lot of technical complexity in
 

5901
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:19,750
there's a lot of technical complexity in
actually figuring out the transition

5902
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:19,760
actually figuring out the transition
 

5903
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:20,870
actually figuring out the transition
process

5904
01:33:20,870 --> 01:33:20,880
process
 

5905
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:23,990
process
there's so that's bigger than social

5906
01:33:23,990 --> 01:33:24,000
there's so that's bigger than social
 

5907
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,070
there's so that's bigger than social
complexity so it's uh the technical

5908
01:33:26,070 --> 01:33:26,080
complexity so it's uh the technical
 

5909
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:27,750
complexity so it's uh the technical
complexity you would say is the bigger

5910
01:33:27,750 --> 01:33:27,760
complexity you would say is the bigger
 

5911
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:28,870
complexity you would say is the bigger
reason for the

5912
01:33:28,870 --> 01:33:28,880
reason for the
 

5913
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:31,350
reason for the
any delays than the social complexity i

5914
01:33:31,350 --> 01:33:31,360
any delays than the social complexity i
 

5915
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:32,870
any delays than the social complexity i
i actually think so i and i

5916
01:33:32,870 --> 01:33:32,880
i actually think so i and i
 

5917
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:35,270
i actually think so i and i
i think we've been very fortunate to not

5918
01:33:35,270 --> 01:33:35,280
i think we've been very fortunate to not
 

5919
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:36,950
i think we've been very fortunate to not
have too much social complexity around

5920
01:33:36,950 --> 01:33:36,960
have too much social complexity around
 

5921
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:37,590
have too much social complexity around
the merge

5922
01:33:37,590 --> 01:33:37,600
the merge
 

5923
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:41,189
the merge
so not much drama no um i think the

5924
01:33:41,189 --> 01:33:41,199
so not much drama no um i think the
 

5925
01:33:41,199 --> 01:33:42,870
so not much drama no um i think the
the biggest part of the reason is just

5926
01:33:42,870 --> 01:33:42,880
the biggest part of the reason is just
 

5927
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:45,189
the biggest part of the reason is just
because we have been talking about proof

5928
01:33:45,189 --> 01:33:45,199
because we have been talking about proof
 

5929
01:33:45,199 --> 01:33:46,550
because we have been talking about proof
of stake in charting as being part of

5930
01:33:46,550 --> 01:33:46,560
of stake in charting as being part of
 

5931
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:48,070
of stake in charting as being part of
the road map since um

5932
01:33:48,070 --> 01:33:48,080
the road map since um
 

5933
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:49,669
the road map since um
almost the very beginning of the project

5934
01:33:49,669 --> 01:33:49,679
almost the very beginning of the project
 

5935
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:51,669
almost the very beginning of the project
right like the very first proof-of-stake

5936
01:33:51,669 --> 01:33:51,679
right like the very first proof-of-stake
 

5937
01:33:51,679 --> 01:33:52,629
right like the very first proof-of-stake
blog post does

5938
01:33:52,629 --> 01:33:52,639
blog post does
 

5939
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:55,830
blog post does
from january 2014 which was you know um

5940
01:33:55,830 --> 01:33:55,840
from january 2014 which was you know um
 

5941
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:57,750
from january 2014 which was you know um
two months after the project started and

5942
01:33:57,750 --> 01:33:57,760
two months after the project started and
 

5943
01:33:57,760 --> 01:34:00,070
two months after the project started and
like maybe even a day after the

5944
01:34:00,070 --> 01:34:00,080
like maybe even a day after the
 

5945
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:01,189
like maybe even a day after the
announcement

5946
01:34:01,189 --> 01:34:01,199
announcement
 

5947
01:34:01,199 --> 01:34:05,189
announcement
um so you know it was proof of stake was

5948
01:34:05,189 --> 01:34:05,199
um so you know it was proof of stake was
 

5949
01:34:05,199 --> 01:34:07,350
um so you know it was proof of stake was
not something that we uh kind of put on

5950
01:34:07,350 --> 01:34:07,360
not something that we uh kind of put on
 

5951
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:09,110
not something that we uh kind of put on
any on anybody by surprise

5952
01:34:09,110 --> 01:34:09,120
any on anybody by surprise
 

5953
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:11,270
any on anybody by surprise
and then when the dow fork happened and

5954
01:34:11,270 --> 01:34:11,280
and then when the dow fork happened and
 

5955
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:12,950
and then when the dow fork happened and
you know the people on the edc side

5956
01:34:12,950 --> 01:34:12,960
you know the people on the edc side
 

5957
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:13,669
you know the people on the edc side
split off

5958
01:34:13,669 --> 01:34:13,679
split off
 

5959
01:34:13,679 --> 01:34:15,990
split off
i think it also just happens that a lot

5960
01:34:15,990 --> 01:34:16,000
i think it also just happens that a lot
 

5961
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,750
i think it also just happens that a lot
of the people that were not willing to

5962
01:34:17,750 --> 01:34:17,760
of the people that were not willing to
 

5963
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:19,270
of the people that were not willing to
stomach the dow fork and then join the

5964
01:34:19,270 --> 01:34:19,280
stomach the dow fork and then join the
 

5965
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:20,310
stomach the dow fork and then join the
etc side

5966
01:34:20,310 --> 01:34:20,320
etc side
 

5967
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:23,030
etc side
they were the more bitcoiny types and

5968
01:34:23,030 --> 01:34:23,040
they were the more bitcoiny types and
 

5969
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:25,189
they were the more bitcoiny types and
the more bitcoiny types do also tends to

5970
01:34:25,189 --> 01:34:25,199
the more bitcoiny types do also tends to
 

5971
01:34:25,199 --> 01:34:26,709
the more bitcoiny types do also tends to
like like proof of work more

5972
01:34:26,709 --> 01:34:26,719
like like proof of work more
 

5973
01:34:26,719 --> 01:34:28,709
like like proof of work more
and so like that also sort of ended up

5974
01:34:28,709 --> 01:34:28,719
and so like that also sort of ended up
 

5975
01:34:28,719 --> 01:34:29,750
and so like that also sort of ended up
you know sort of

5976
01:34:29,750 --> 01:34:29,760
you know sort of
 

5977
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:32,149
you know sort of
like purifying the communities on both

5978
01:34:32,149 --> 01:34:32,159
like purifying the communities on both
 

5979
01:34:32,159 --> 01:34:33,110
like purifying the communities on both
sides i guess

5980
01:34:33,110 --> 01:34:33,120
sides i guess
 

5981
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:35,030
sides i guess
so ethereum classic is not switching to

5982
01:34:35,030 --> 01:34:35,040
so ethereum classic is not switching to
 

5983
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:36,149
so ethereum classic is not switching to
proof of stake and

5984
01:34:36,149 --> 01:34:36,159
proof of stake and
 

5985
01:34:36,159 --> 01:34:38,470
proof of stake and
you know they're happy with their setup

5986
01:34:38,470 --> 01:34:38,480
you know they're happy with their setup
 

5987
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:39,669
you know they're happy with their setup
and

5988
01:34:39,669 --> 01:34:39,679
and
 

5989
01:34:39,679 --> 01:34:43,510
and
by the time that uh you know it came

5990
01:34:43,510 --> 01:34:43,520
by the time that uh you know it came
 

5991
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:45,270
by the time that uh you know it came
through the beacon chain launching ends

5992
01:34:45,270 --> 01:34:45,280
through the beacon chain launching ends
 

5993
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:46,790
through the beacon chain launching ends
and now i think the community is

5994
01:34:46,790 --> 01:34:46,800
and now i think the community is
 

5995
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:48,470
and now i think the community is
there's very strongly in favor of the

5996
01:34:48,470 --> 01:34:48,480
there's very strongly in favor of the
 

5997
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:50,709
there's very strongly in favor of the
proof of stake switch

5998
01:34:50,709 --> 01:34:50,719
proof of stake switch
 

5999
01:34:50,719 --> 01:34:53,750
proof of stake switch
but let me ask the question that no

6000
01:34:53,750 --> 01:34:53,760
but let me ask the question that no
 

6001
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:56,470
but let me ask the question that no
engineer wants to hear which is uh the

6002
01:34:56,470 --> 01:34:56,480
engineer wants to hear which is uh the
 

6003
01:34:56,480 --> 01:35:00,629
engineer wants to hear which is uh the
question of timeline when do you think

6004
01:35:00,629 --> 01:35:00,639
question of timeline when do you think
 

6005
01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:02,229
question of timeline when do you think
the merge

6006
01:35:02,229 --> 01:35:02,239
the merge
 

6007
01:35:02,239 --> 01:35:04,870
the merge
will happen do you have a sense it might

6008
01:35:04,870 --> 01:35:04,880
will happen do you have a sense it might
 

6009
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:06,149
will happen do you have a sense it might
happen this year

6010
01:35:06,149 --> 01:35:06,159
happen this year
 

6011
01:35:06,159 --> 01:35:07,990
happen this year
dear sense it might be pushed towards

6012
01:35:07,990 --> 01:35:08,000
dear sense it might be pushed towards
 

6013
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,229
dear sense it might be pushed towards
next year 2022

6014
01:35:10,229 --> 01:35:10,239
next year 2022
 

6015
01:35:10,239 --> 01:35:14,229
next year 2022
um or uh or even beyond

6016
01:35:14,229 --> 01:35:14,239
um or uh or even beyond
 

6017
01:35:14,239 --> 01:35:17,350
um or uh or even beyond
um i think early 2022 was like the most

6018
01:35:17,350 --> 01:35:17,360
um i think early 2022 was like the most
 

6019
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:18,709
um i think early 2022 was like the most
realistic

6020
01:35:18,709 --> 01:35:18,719
realistic
 

6021
01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:21,590
realistic
there's i think there's definitely still

6022
01:35:21,590 --> 01:35:21,600
there's i think there's definitely still
 

6023
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:23,350
there's i think there's definitely still
like an optimistic case of it happening

6024
01:35:23,350 --> 01:35:23,360
like an optimistic case of it happening
 

6025
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:25,350
like an optimistic case of it happening
this year but like

6026
01:35:25,350 --> 01:35:25,360
this year but like
 

6027
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:27,030
this year but like
the realistic thing to count on is

6028
01:35:27,030 --> 01:35:27,040
the realistic thing to count on is
 

6029
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:29,990
the realistic thing to count on is
definitely the early part of

6030
01:35:29,990 --> 01:35:30,000
definitely the early part of
 

6031
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,669
definitely the early part of
very early part of next year is there

6032
01:35:31,669 --> 01:35:31,679
very early part of next year is there
 

6033
01:35:31,679 --> 01:35:33,350
very early part of next year is there
specific things that stand out to you

6034
01:35:33,350 --> 01:35:33,360
specific things that stand out to you
 

6035
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:33,990
specific things that stand out to you
that are

6036
01:35:33,990 --> 01:35:34,000
that are
 

6037
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:37,109
that are
like do they'll make you feel good about

6038
01:35:37,109 --> 01:35:37,119
like do they'll make you feel good about
 

6039
01:35:37,119 --> 01:35:37,830
like do they'll make you feel good about
progress

6040
01:35:37,830 --> 01:35:37,840
progress
 

6041
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:40,950
progress
if you see it happening um so the thing

6042
01:35:40,950 --> 01:35:40,960
if you see it happening um so the thing
 

6043
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:41,430
if you see it happening um so the thing
that we

6044
01:35:41,430 --> 01:35:41,440
that we
 

6045
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:44,870
that we
had last month is that we had this

6046
01:35:44,870 --> 01:35:44,880
had last month is that we had this
 

6047
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:46,950
had last month is that we had this
online hackathon called rayonism where

6048
01:35:46,950 --> 01:35:46,960
online hackathon called rayonism where
 

6049
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:48,550
online hackathon called rayonism where
basically a bunch of uh

6050
01:35:48,550 --> 01:35:48,560
basically a bunch of uh
 

6051
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:50,550
basically a bunch of uh
the different uh client developers that

6052
01:35:50,550 --> 01:35:50,560
the different uh client developers that
 

6053
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:52,390
the different uh client developers that
are going to be part of the transition

6054
01:35:52,390 --> 01:35:52,400
are going to be part of the transition
 

6055
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:55,189
are going to be part of the transition
like hacks together some test nets of

6056
01:35:55,189 --> 01:35:55,199
like hacks together some test nets of
 

6057
01:35:55,199 --> 01:35:57,430
like hacks together some test nets of
the post-merge ethereum chain

6058
01:35:57,430 --> 01:35:57,440
the post-merge ethereum chain
 

6059
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:59,910
the post-merge ethereum chain
so these were only test nets of what

6060
01:35:59,910 --> 01:35:59,920
so these were only test nets of what
 

6061
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:01,189
so these were only test nets of what
would happen after the merge they were

6062
01:36:01,189 --> 01:36:01,199
would happen after the merge they were
 

6063
01:36:01,199 --> 01:36:03,270
would happen after the merge they were
not test nets of the transition itself

6064
01:36:03,270 --> 01:36:03,280
not test nets of the transition itself
 

6065
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:05,910
not test nets of the transition itself
so the thing that people are working on

6066
01:36:05,910 --> 01:36:05,920
so the thing that people are working on
 

6067
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:07,669
so the thing that people are working on
now actually is the transition

6068
01:36:07,669 --> 01:36:07,679
now actually is the transition
 

6069
01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:10,870
now actually is the transition
um so having a

6070
01:36:10,870 --> 01:36:10,880
um so having a
 

6071
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:12,870
um so having a
full specification of both the

6072
01:36:12,870 --> 01:36:12,880
full specification of both the
 

6073
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:14,310
full specification of both the
transition and post transition

6074
01:36:14,310 --> 01:36:14,320
transition and post transition
 

6075
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:16,390
transition and post transition
i mean we have specifications now but

6076
01:36:16,390 --> 01:36:16,400
i mean we have specifications now but
 

6077
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:18,629
i mean we have specifications now but
like in a realistic way

6078
01:36:18,629 --> 01:36:18,639
like in a realistic way
 

6079
01:36:18,639 --> 01:36:19,990
like in a realistic way
though probably needs to have a couple

6080
01:36:19,990 --> 01:36:20,000
though probably needs to have a couple
 

6081
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,910
though probably needs to have a couple
of changes and have things that continue

6082
01:36:21,910 --> 01:36:21,920
of changes and have things that continue
 

6083
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:23,189
of changes and have things that continue
to be ironed out

6084
01:36:23,189 --> 01:36:23,199
to be ironed out
 

6085
01:36:23,199 --> 01:36:25,990
to be ironed out
and then have a yet test net that does

6086
01:36:25,990 --> 01:36:26,000
and then have a yet test net that does
 

6087
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:26,950
and then have a yet test net that does
both the transition

6088
01:36:26,950 --> 01:36:26,960
both the transition
 

6089
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:28,709
both the transition
and the post transition and then like

6090
01:36:28,709 --> 01:36:28,719
and the post transition and then like
 

6091
01:36:28,719 --> 01:36:30,390
and the post transition and then like
once you have a test network then

6092
01:36:30,390 --> 01:36:30,400
once you have a test network then
 

6093
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:32,229
once you have a test network then
you just have to do a lot of testing and

6094
01:36:32,229 --> 01:36:32,239
you just have to do a lot of testing and
 

6095
01:36:32,239 --> 01:36:33,990
you just have to do a lot of testing and
audit it um and then

6096
01:36:33,990 --> 01:36:34,000
audit it um and then
 

6097
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:37,030
audit it um and then
you know do some runs on not just a

6098
01:36:37,030 --> 01:36:37,040
you know do some runs on not just a
 

6099
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:38,790
you know do some runs on not just a
specialized test network but on say an

6100
01:36:38,790 --> 01:36:38,800
specialized test network but on say an
 

6101
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:40,709
specialized test network but on say an
existing test network like a rob center

6102
01:36:40,709 --> 01:36:40,719
existing test network like a rob center
 

6103
01:36:40,719 --> 01:36:41,990
existing test network like a rob center
rinkeby that

6104
01:36:41,990 --> 01:36:42,000
rinkeby that
 

6105
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:45,109
rinkeby that
ethereum people already significantly

6106
01:36:45,109 --> 01:36:45,119
ethereum people already significantly
 

6107
01:36:45,119 --> 01:36:46,709
ethereum people already significantly
use and if it works then

6108
01:36:46,709 --> 01:36:46,719
use and if it works then
 

6109
01:36:46,719 --> 01:36:49,430
use and if it works then
you can deploy the transition on mainnet

6110
01:36:49,430 --> 01:36:49,440
you can deploy the transition on mainnet
 

6111
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:50,709
you can deploy the transition on mainnet
just as a quick comment

6112
01:36:50,709 --> 01:36:50,719
just as a quick comment
 

6113
01:36:50,719 --> 01:36:53,109
just as a quick comment
because this is fascinating in august of

6114
01:36:53,109 --> 01:36:53,119
because this is fascinating in august of
 

6115
01:36:53,119 --> 01:36:54,229
because this is fascinating in august of
last year

6116
01:36:54,229 --> 01:36:54,239
last year
 

6117
01:36:54,239 --> 01:36:57,590
last year
there was this uh medalla

6118
01:36:57,590 --> 01:36:57,600
there was this uh medalla
 

6119
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:00,149
there was this uh medalla
i believe it's pronounced madasha it's a

6120
01:37:00,149 --> 01:37:00,159
i believe it's pronounced madasha it's a
 

6121
01:37:00,159 --> 01:37:01,109
i believe it's pronounced madasha it's a
south american

subway station i forget where but spell

6124
01:37:03,430 --> 01:37:03,440
subway station i forget where but spell
 

6125

subway station i forget where but spell
with two l's

6126
01:37:04,790 --> 01:37:04,800
with two l's
 

6127

yeah yeah because that's you know that's
 

6129
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,590
yeah yeah because that's you know that's
how spanish works right like the two

6130
01:37:07,590 --> 01:37:07,600
how spanish works right like the two
 

6131
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:09,510
how spanish works right like the two
else have uh

6132
01:37:09,510 --> 01:37:09,520
else have uh
 

6133
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:11,990
else have uh
dasha yeah okay cool anyway but i read

6134
01:37:11,990 --> 01:37:12,000
dasha yeah okay cool anyway but i read
 

6135
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:12,870
dasha yeah okay cool anyway but i read
about it

6136
01:37:12,870 --> 01:37:12,880
about it
 

6137
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:15,590
about it
in uh middle of august august 14th there

6138
01:37:15,590 --> 01:37:15,600
in uh middle of august august 14th there
 

6139
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:16,629
in uh middle of august august 14th there
was an incident

6140
01:37:16,629 --> 01:37:16,639
was an incident
 

6141
01:37:16,639 --> 01:37:20,550
was an incident
on that test net um what how does this

6142
01:37:20,550 --> 01:37:20,560
on that test net um what how does this
 

6143
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:22,790
on that test net um what how does this
process work like what do you learn from

6144
01:37:22,790 --> 01:37:22,800
process work like what do you learn from
 

6145
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:24,470
process work like what do you learn from
those kinds of incidents when stuff goes

6146
01:37:24,470 --> 01:37:24,480
those kinds of incidents when stuff goes
 

6147
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:25,109
those kinds of incidents when stuff goes
wrong

6148
01:37:25,109 --> 01:37:25,119
wrong
 

6149
01:37:25,119 --> 01:37:28,629
wrong
in the test process um i think uh that

6150
01:37:28,629 --> 01:37:28,639
in the test process um i think uh that
 

6151
01:37:28,639 --> 01:37:30,229
in the test process um i think uh that
incidence was that

6152
01:37:30,229 --> 01:37:30,239
incidence was that
 

6153
01:37:30,239 --> 01:37:32,149
incidence was that
there was a consensus failure of some

6154
01:37:32,149 --> 01:37:32,159
there was a consensus failure of some
 

6155
01:37:32,159 --> 01:37:33,669
there was a consensus failure of some
kindness i remember um

6156
01:37:33,669 --> 01:37:33,679
kindness i remember um
 

6157
01:37:33,679 --> 01:37:35,510
kindness i remember um
basically just different clients

6158
01:37:35,510 --> 01:37:35,520
basically just different clients
 

6159
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:36,950
basically just different clients
interpreting things in different ways

6160
01:37:36,950 --> 01:37:36,960
interpreting things in different ways
 

6161
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:38,310
interpreting things in different ways
and then one of them getting kicked off

6162
01:37:38,310 --> 01:37:38,320
and then one of them getting kicked off
 

6163
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:39,350
and then one of them getting kicked off
the network

6164
01:37:39,350 --> 01:37:39,360
the network
 

6165
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:42,070
the network
and then it ended up taking a while to

6166
01:37:42,070 --> 01:37:42,080
and then it ended up taking a while to
 

6167
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:43,189
and then it ended up taking a while to
actually like

6168
01:37:43,189 --> 01:37:43,199
actually like
 

6169
01:37:43,199 --> 01:37:45,350
actually like
get everyone to get back online like a

6170
01:37:45,350 --> 01:37:45,360
get everyone to get back online like a
 

6171
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:46,870
get everyone to get back online like a
big part of the reason why it took weeks

6172
01:37:46,870 --> 01:37:46,880
big part of the reason why it took weeks
 

6173
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:49,270
big part of the reason why it took weeks
to resolve right is because

6174
01:37:49,270 --> 01:37:49,280
to resolve right is because
 

6175
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:51,430
to resolve right is because
it's on a test network like the coins

6176
01:37:51,430 --> 01:37:51,440
it's on a test network like the coins
 

6177
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:52,950
it's on a test network like the coins
are valueless and so there's

6178
01:37:52,950 --> 01:37:52,960
are valueless and so there's
 

6179
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:55,750
are valueless and so there's
not really this big push of any kind for

6180
01:37:55,750 --> 01:37:55,760
not really this big push of any kind for
 

6181
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:56,950
not really this big push of any kind for
people to actually

6182
01:37:56,950 --> 01:37:56,960
people to actually
 

6183
01:37:56,960 --> 01:37:58,550
people to actually
you know going down with a new client so

6184
01:37:58,550 --> 01:37:58,560
you know going down with a new client so
 

6185
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:00,390
you know going down with a new client so
they can start participating again

6186
01:38:00,390 --> 01:38:00,400
they can start participating again
 

6187
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:02,390
they can start participating again
and so you know it definitely took a

6188
01:38:02,390 --> 01:38:02,400
and so you know it definitely took a
 

6189
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:04,470
and so you know it definitely took a
while until the chain started finalizing

6190
01:38:04,470 --> 01:38:04,480
while until the chain started finalizing
 

6191
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:05,109
while until the chain started finalizing
again um

6192
01:38:05,109 --> 01:38:05,119
again um
 

6193
01:38:05,119 --> 01:38:08,390
again um
but and then also like there was i think

6194
01:38:08,390 --> 01:38:08,400
but and then also like there was i think
 

6195
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:09,350
but and then also like there was i think
another

6196
01:38:09,350 --> 01:38:09,360
another
 

6197
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:11,910
another
round of just not finalizing in october

6198
01:38:11,910 --> 01:38:11,920
round of just not finalizing in october
 

6199
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:12,870
round of just not finalizing in october
as i remember

6200
01:38:12,870 --> 01:38:12,880
as i remember
 

6201
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:16,310
as i remember
um that i mean there were definitely

6202
01:38:16,310 --> 01:38:16,320
um that i mean there were definitely
 

6203
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:17,910
um that i mean there were definitely
things that we learned like there were

6204
01:38:17,910 --> 01:38:17,920
things that we learned like there were
 

6205
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:20,229
things that we learned like there were
a lot of things especially that client

6206
01:38:20,229 --> 01:38:20,239
a lot of things especially that client
 

6207
01:38:20,239 --> 01:38:21,830
a lot of things especially that client
developers just learned about like

6208
01:38:21,830 --> 01:38:21,840
developers just learned about like
 

6209
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:22,790
developers just learned about like
optimization

6210
01:38:22,790 --> 01:38:22,800
optimization
 

6211
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:25,990
optimization
and how to build their clients in a way

6212
01:38:25,990 --> 01:38:26,000
and how to build their clients in a way
 

6213
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,270
and how to build their clients in a way
that they can process things

6214
01:38:27,270 --> 01:38:27,280
that they can process things
 

6215
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:29,910
that they can process things
efficiently um there's a lot that we

6216
01:38:29,910 --> 01:38:29,920
efficiently um there's a lot that we
 

6217
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:31,590
efficiently um there's a lot that we
learned from just like seeing the full

6218
01:38:31,590 --> 01:38:31,600
learned from just like seeing the full
 

6219
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:33,350
learned from just like seeing the full
life cycle of what happens when

6220
01:38:33,350 --> 01:38:33,360
life cycle of what happens when
 

6221
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:34,950
life cycle of what happens when
more than a third of the validators go

6222
01:38:34,950 --> 01:38:34,960
more than a third of the validators go
 

6223
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:37,030
more than a third of the validators go
offline and then finalization stops

6224
01:38:37,030 --> 01:38:37,040
offline and then finalization stops
 

6225
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:40,629
offline and then finalization stops
and then that kind of

6226
01:38:40,629 --> 01:38:40,639
and then that kind of
 

6227
01:38:40,639 --> 01:38:42,310
and then that kind of
weird unusual state of the chain

6228
01:38:42,310 --> 01:38:42,320
weird unusual state of the chain
 

6229
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:43,990
weird unusual state of the chain
continues for a while and then

6230
01:38:43,990 --> 01:38:44,000
continues for a while and then
 

6231
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,350
continues for a while and then
eventually everyone who is not

6232
01:38:45,350 --> 01:38:45,360
eventually everyone who is not
 

6233
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:47,030
eventually everyone who is not
participating just

6234
01:38:47,030 --> 01:38:47,040
participating just
 

6235
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:49,830
participating just
gets enough of their stake like we don't

6236
01:38:49,830 --> 01:38:49,840
gets enough of their stake like we don't
 

6237
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:51,430
gets enough of their stake like we don't
use the word swash we use the word weak

6238
01:38:51,430 --> 01:38:51,440
use the word swash we use the word weak
 

6239
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:53,270
use the word swash we use the word weak
for this but like basically also burned

6240
01:38:53,270 --> 01:38:53,280
for this but like basically also burned
 

6241
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:55,430
for this but like basically also burned
um until you know the people who are

6242
01:38:55,430 --> 01:38:55,440
um until you know the people who are
 

6243
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:56,950
um until you know the people who are
participating go back up to two thirds

6244
01:38:56,950 --> 01:38:56,960
participating go back up to two thirds
 

6245
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:58,470
participating go back up to two thirds
and then the chain goes back to

6246
01:38:58,470 --> 01:38:58,480
and then the chain goes back to
 

6247
01:38:58,480 --> 01:38:59,590
and then the chain goes back to
finalizing

6248
01:38:59,590 --> 01:38:59,600
finalizing
 

6249
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:02,310
finalizing
so just seeing all of those edge cases

6250
01:39:02,310 --> 01:39:02,320
so just seeing all of those edge cases
 

6251
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:04,070
so just seeing all of those edge cases
play out live i think actually helped a

6252
01:39:04,070 --> 01:39:04,080
play out live i think actually helped a
 

6253
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:05,270
play out live i think actually helped a
lot and probably helped to really

6254
01:39:05,270 --> 01:39:05,280
lot and probably helped to really
 

6255
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:06,870
lot and probably helped to really
contribute to

6256
01:39:06,870 --> 01:39:06,880
contribute to
 

6257
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:08,950
contribute to
making us feel better about midnight i

6258
01:39:08,950 --> 01:39:08,960
making us feel better about midnight i
 

6259
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:10,470
making us feel better about midnight i
mean there's also an incident

6260
01:39:10,470 --> 01:39:10,480
mean there's also an incident
 

6261
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:13,669
mean there's also an incident
just recently in april 24th

6262
01:39:13,669 --> 01:39:13,679
just recently in april 24th
 

6263
01:39:13,679 --> 01:39:16,870
just recently in april 24th
of 2021 where uh

6264
01:39:16,870 --> 01:39:16,880
of 2021 where uh
 

6265
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:20,070
of 2021 where uh
this was on beacon i guess there was a

6266
01:39:20,070 --> 01:39:20,080
this was on beacon i guess there was a
 

6267
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:21,910
this was on beacon i guess there was a
bug discovered in the software client

6268
01:39:21,910 --> 01:39:21,920
bug discovered in the software client
 

6269
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:22,550
bug discovered in the software client

from producing blocks i mean maybe you

6276
01:39:29,430 --> 01:39:29,440
from producing blocks i mean maybe you
 

6277
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:31,910
from producing blocks i mean maybe you
can comment on what happened but

6278
01:39:31,910 --> 01:39:31,920
can comment on what happened but
 

6279
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:34,629
can comment on what happened but
broadly like the big picture what kind

6280
01:39:34,629 --> 01:39:34,639
broadly like the big picture what kind
 

6281
01:39:34,639 --> 01:39:35,189
broadly like the big picture what kind
of stuff

6282
01:39:35,189 --> 01:39:35,199
of stuff
 

6283
01:39:35,199 --> 01:39:37,990
of stuff
are you worried about in terms of

are you worried about in terms of

are you worried about in terms of

problems that might arise
 

6287
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:41,430

we're talking about small bugs i were

6288
01:39:41,430 --> 01:39:41,440
we're talking about small bugs i were
 

6289
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:42,390
we're talking about small bugs i were
talking about

6290
01:39:42,390 --> 01:39:42,400
talking about
 

6291
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:46,229
talking about
like emergent social unexpected

01:39:46,229 --> 01:39:46,239
like emergent social unexpected
 

6293
01:39:46,239 --> 01:39:48,709
like emergent social unexpected
social bugs you know what are the things

6294
01:39:48,709 --> 01:39:48,719
social bugs you know what are the things
 

6295
01:39:48,719 --> 01:39:50,550
social bugs you know what are the things
that worry about the future of ethereum

6296
01:39:50,550 --> 01:39:50,560
that worry about the future of ethereum
 

6297
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:51,270
that worry about the future of ethereum
that

6298
01:39:51,270 --> 01:39:51,280
that
 

6299
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:52,709
that
you want to make sure you construct

6300
01:39:52,709 --> 01:39:52,719
you want to make sure you construct
 

6301
01:39:52,719 --> 01:39:54,149
you want to make sure you construct
mechanisms that prevent those things

6302
01:39:54,149 --> 01:39:54,159
mechanisms that prevent those things
 

6303
01:39:54,159 --> 01:39:55,350
mechanisms that prevent those things
from happening

6304
01:39:55,350 --> 01:39:55,360
from happening
 

6305
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:57,510
from happening
so one of the lucky things there was

6306
01:39:57,510 --> 01:39:57,520
so one of the lucky things there was
 

6307
01:39:57,520 --> 01:40:00,070
so one of the lucky things there was
that this particular bug only prevented

6308
01:40:00,070 --> 01:40:00,080
that this particular bug only prevented
 

6309
01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:02,149
that this particular bug only prevented
proposals of blocks it did not prevent

6310
01:40:02,149 --> 01:40:02,159
proposals of blocks it did not prevent
 

6311
01:40:02,159 --> 01:40:03,030
proposals of blocks it did not prevent
attestations

6312
01:40:03,030 --> 01:40:03,040
attestations
 

6313
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:04,390
attestations
right so at the stations is just a

6314
01:40:04,390 --> 01:40:04,400
right so at the stations is just a
 

6315
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:06,229
right so at the stations is just a
mechanism for voting on blocks

6316
01:40:06,229 --> 01:40:06,239
mechanism for voting on blocks
 

6317
01:40:06,239 --> 01:40:07,750
mechanism for voting on blocks
and it's the attestations that are

6318
01:40:07,750 --> 01:40:07,760
and it's the attestations that are
 

6319
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:09,109
and it's the attestations that are
actually responsible for the chain

6320
01:40:09,109 --> 01:40:09,119
actually responsible for the chain
 

6321
01:40:09,119 --> 01:40:10,950
actually responsible for the chain
finalizing so like coming to this

6322
01:40:10,950 --> 01:40:10,960
finalizing so like coming to this
 

6323
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:12,870
finalizing so like coming to this
more permanent agreement on blocks right

6324
01:40:12,870 --> 01:40:12,880
more permanent agreement on blocks right
 

6325
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:15,270
more permanent agreement on blocks right
so the chain was actually quite stable

6326
01:40:15,270 --> 01:40:15,280
so the chain was actually quite stable
 

6327
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:16,470
so the chain was actually quite stable
all the way through

6328
01:40:16,470 --> 01:40:16,480
all the way through
 

6329
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:20,070
all the way through
um the i think the thing that we

6330
01:40:20,070 --> 01:40:20,080
um the i think the thing that we
 

6331
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:20,709
um the i think the thing that we
generally

6332
01:40:20,709 --> 01:40:20,719
generally
 

6333
01:40:20,719 --> 01:40:22,950
generally
learned from these experience

6334
01:40:22,950 --> 01:40:22,960
learned from these experience
 

6335
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:23,830
learned from these experience
experiences

6336
01:40:23,830 --> 01:40:23,840
experiences
 

6337
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:26,629
experiences
is just how valuable it is to have the

6338
01:40:26,629 --> 01:40:26,639
is just how valuable it is to have the
 

6339
01:40:26,639 --> 01:40:28,149
is just how valuable it is to have the
some multi-client network

6340
01:40:28,149 --> 01:40:28,159
some multi-client network
 

6341
01:40:28,159 --> 01:40:29,590
some multi-client network
right so this is one of these areas

6342
01:40:29,590 --> 01:40:29,600
right so this is one of these areas
 

6343
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:31,270
right so this is one of these areas
where i think ethereum distinguishes

6344
01:40:31,270 --> 01:40:31,280
where i think ethereum distinguishes
 

6345
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:33,350
where i think ethereum distinguishes
itself from like bitcoin for example

6346
01:40:33,350 --> 01:40:33,360
itself from like bitcoin for example
 

6347
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:36,950
itself from like bitcoin for example
right that in ethereum we don't have

6348
01:40:36,950 --> 01:40:36,960
right that in ethereum we don't have
 

6349
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:40,310
right that in ethereum we don't have
one single client that that everyone

6350
01:40:40,310 --> 01:40:40,320
one single client that that everyone
 

6351
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:42,390
one single client that that everyone
um just runs right there's multiple

6352
01:40:42,390 --> 01:40:42,400
um just runs right there's multiple
 

6353
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:43,590
um just runs right there's multiple
implementations of

6354
01:40:43,590 --> 01:40:43,600
implementations of
 

6355
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:45,030
implementations of
the protocol and these multiple

6356
01:40:45,030 --> 01:40:45,040
the protocol and these multiple
 

6357
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:47,109
the protocol and these multiple
implementations they're they all

6358
01:40:47,109 --> 01:40:47,119
implementations they're they all
 

6359
01:40:47,119 --> 01:40:49,990
implementations they're they all
process and verify the blocks that each

6360
01:40:49,990 --> 01:40:50,000
process and verify the blocks that each
 

6361
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:50,790
process and verify the blocks that each
other can

6362
01:40:50,790 --> 01:40:50,800
other can
 

6363
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:53,109
other can
you know verify right so they all speak

6364
01:40:53,109 --> 01:40:53,119
you know verify right so they all speak
 

6365
01:40:53,119 --> 01:40:54,149
you know verify right so they all speak
the same language

6366
01:40:54,149 --> 01:40:54,159
the same language
 

6367
01:40:54,159 --> 01:40:55,750
the same language
now sometimes when there's a bug they

6368
01:40:55,750 --> 01:40:55,760
now sometimes when there's a bug they
 

6369
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:57,189
now sometimes when there's a bug they
disagree right and

6370
01:40:57,189 --> 01:40:57,199
disagree right and
 

6371
01:40:57,199 --> 01:40:58,950
disagree right and
when two clients disagree because of a

6372
01:40:58,950 --> 01:40:58,960
when two clients disagree because of a
 

6373
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:01,030
when two clients disagree because of a
bug we call this a consensus failure

6374
01:41:01,030 --> 01:41:01,040
bug we call this a consensus failure
 

6375
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:02,470
bug we call this a consensus failure
and consensus failures are pretty

6376
01:41:02,470 --> 01:41:02,480
and consensus failures are pretty
 

6377
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:04,629
and consensus failures are pretty
serious right and when

6378
01:41:04,629 --> 01:41:04,639
serious right and when
 

6379
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:07,830
serious right and when
you have um clients monoculture like

6380
01:41:07,830 --> 01:41:07,840
you have um clients monoculture like
 

6381
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:08,790
you have um clients monoculture like
bitcoin does

6382
01:41:08,790 --> 01:41:08,800
bitcoin does
 

6383
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:11,350
bitcoin does
then like it's more rare to have

6384
01:41:11,350 --> 01:41:11,360
then like it's more rare to have
 

6385
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:13,189
then like it's more rare to have
consensus failures do you still have

6386
01:41:13,189 --> 01:41:13,199
consensus failures do you still have
 

6387
01:41:13,199 --> 01:41:14,790
consensus failures do you still have
them actually bitcoin had a consensus

6388
01:41:14,790 --> 01:41:14,800
them actually bitcoin had a consensus
 

6389
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:16,390
them actually bitcoin had a consensus
failure between two different versions

6390
01:41:16,390 --> 01:41:16,400
failure between two different versions
 

6391
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:18,950
failure between two different versions
of the same client back in 2013

6392
01:41:18,950 --> 01:41:18,960
of the same client back in 2013
 

6393
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:22,149
of the same client back in 2013
um but they're less likely to happen but

6394
01:41:22,149 --> 01:41:22,159
um but they're less likely to happen but
 

6395
01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:24,070
um but they're less likely to happen but
the interesting thing is that the

6396
01:41:24,070 --> 01:41:24,080
the interesting thing is that the
 

6397
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:26,629
the interesting thing is that the
multi-client architecture has actually

6398
01:41:26,629 --> 01:41:26,639
multi-client architecture has actually
 

6399
01:41:26,639 --> 01:41:29,109
multi-client architecture has actually
i think saved ethereum much more than

6400
01:41:29,109 --> 01:41:29,119
i think saved ethereum much more than
 

6401
01:41:29,119 --> 01:41:29,990
i think saved ethereum much more than
it's heard it

6402
01:41:29,990 --> 01:41:30,000
it's heard it
 

6403
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,750
it's heard it
so even in this most recent incidents

6404
01:41:31,750 --> 01:41:31,760
so even in this most recent incidents
 

6405
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:33,030
so even in this most recent incidents
right like prism was not producing

6406
01:41:33,030 --> 01:41:33,040
right like prism was not producing
 

6407
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:34,229
right like prism was not producing
blocks but all the other clients were

6408
01:41:34,229 --> 01:41:34,239
blocks but all the other clients were
 

6409
01:41:34,239 --> 01:41:35,830
blocks but all the other clients were
still producing blocks

6410
01:41:35,830 --> 01:41:35,840
still producing blocks
 

6411
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:38,709
still producing blocks
um there's four others right yes it's a

6412
01:41:38,709 --> 01:41:38,719
um there's four others right yes it's a
 

6413
01:41:38,719 --> 01:41:39,510
um there's four others right yes it's a
prism

6414
01:41:39,510 --> 01:41:39,520
prism
 

6415
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:43,270
prism
nimbus teku and the white house um

6416
01:41:43,270 --> 01:41:43,280
nimbus teku and the white house um
 

6417
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:46,229
nimbus teku and the white house um
and then also ethereum back in 2016 had

6418
01:41:46,229 --> 01:41:46,239
and then also ethereum back in 2016 had
 

6419
01:41:46,239 --> 01:41:46,870
and then also ethereum back in 2016 had
this fun

6420
01:41:46,870 --> 01:41:46,880
this fun
 

6421
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:48,470
this fun
event that we call the shanghai dos

6422
01:41:48,470 --> 01:41:48,480
event that we call the shanghai dos
 

6423
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:50,310
event that we call the shanghai dos
attacks uh they're called that because

6424
01:41:50,310 --> 01:41:50,320
attacks uh they're called that because
 

6425
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:50,790
attacks uh they're called that because
uh

6426
01:41:50,790 --> 01:41:50,800
uh
 

6427
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:53,750
uh
the attacks started like right on the

6428
01:41:53,750 --> 01:41:53,760
the attacks started like right on the
 

6429
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:54,950
the attacks started like right on the
first day of a

6430
01:41:54,950 --> 01:41:54,960
first day of a
 

6431
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:57,030
first day of a
of our annual conference at defcon that

6432
01:41:57,030 --> 01:41:57,040
of our annual conference at defcon that
 

6433
01:41:57,040 --> 01:41:59,350
of our annual conference at defcon that
happens to be in shanghai that year

6434
01:41:59,350 --> 01:41:59,360
happens to be in shanghai that year
 

6435
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:02,470
happens to be in shanghai that year
so what happened like basically was that

6436
01:42:02,470 --> 01:42:02,480
so what happened like basically was that
 

6437
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:04,950
so what happened like basically was that
someone came up with a way to create

6438
01:42:04,950 --> 01:42:04,960
someone came up with a way to create
 

6439
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:05,669
someone came up with a way to create
blocks

6440
01:42:05,669 --> 01:42:05,679
blocks
 

6441
01:42:05,679 --> 01:42:08,229
blocks
that were very slow for one clients to

6442
01:42:08,229 --> 01:42:08,239
that were very slow for one clients to
 

6443
01:42:08,239 --> 01:42:09,990
that were very slow for one clients to
process but not the other client

6444
01:42:09,990 --> 01:42:10,000
process but not the other client
 

6445
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,830
process but not the other client
so at that time there were basically two

6446
01:42:11,830 --> 01:42:11,840
so at that time there were basically two
 

6447
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:13,350
so at that time there were basically two
ethereum clients there were they were

6448
01:42:13,350 --> 01:42:13,360
ethereum clients there were they were
 

6449
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:14,709
ethereum clients there were they were
called geth and parity

6450
01:42:14,709 --> 01:42:14,719
called geth and parity
 

6451
01:42:14,719 --> 01:42:17,350
called geth and parity
um right now i think the top three ones

6452
01:42:17,350 --> 01:42:17,360
um right now i think the top three ones
 

6453
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:17,910
um right now i think the top three ones
are

6454
01:42:17,910 --> 01:42:17,920
are
 

6455
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:21,270
are
gath nethermind and baso um but

6456
01:42:21,270 --> 01:42:21,280
gath nethermind and baso um but
 

6457
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:22,870
gath nethermind and baso um but
what happened as a result of us having

6458
01:42:22,870 --> 01:42:22,880
what happened as a result of us having
 

6459
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:24,870
what happened as a result of us having
two clients is that the attacker was

6460
01:42:24,870 --> 01:42:24,880
two clients is that the attacker was
 

6461
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:25,189
two clients is that the attacker was
just

6462
01:42:25,189 --> 01:42:25,199
just
 

6463
01:42:25,199 --> 01:42:27,109
just
not able to come up with blocks that

6464
01:42:27,109 --> 01:42:27,119
not able to come up with blocks that
 

6465
01:42:27,119 --> 01:42:28,790
not able to come up with blocks that
both clients were

6466
01:42:28,790 --> 01:42:28,800
both clients were
 

6467
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:32,149
both clients were
like uh completely failing at processing

6468
01:42:32,149 --> 01:42:32,159
like uh completely failing at processing
 

6469
01:42:32,159 --> 01:42:33,830
like uh completely failing at processing
and so like a lot of the miners and a

6470
01:42:33,830 --> 01:42:33,840
and so like a lot of the miners and a
 

6471
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:35,270
and so like a lot of the miners and a
lot of network participants they just

6472
01:42:35,270 --> 01:42:35,280
lot of network participants they just
 

6473
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:36,550
lot of network participants they just
kept on switching between the two

6474
01:42:36,550 --> 01:42:36,560
kept on switching between the two
 

6475
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:37,669
kept on switching between the two
implementations

6476
01:42:37,669 --> 01:42:37,679
implementations
 

6477
01:42:37,679 --> 01:42:39,270
implementations
depending on which one worked and that

6478
01:42:39,270 --> 01:42:39,280
depending on which one worked and that
 

6479
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:42,709
depending on which one worked and that
actually really helped the

6480
01:42:42,709 --> 01:42:42,719

 

6481
01:42:42,719 --> 01:42:45,109

the chain i kind of survived through

6482
01:42:45,109 --> 01:42:45,119
the chain i kind of survived through
 

6483
01:42:45,119 --> 01:42:46,709
the chain i kind of survived through
that month of attacks as the attacker

6484
01:42:46,709 --> 01:42:46,719
that month of attacks as the attacker
 

6485
01:42:46,719 --> 01:42:47,750
that month of attacks as the attacker
just like kept on

6486
01:42:47,750 --> 01:42:47,760
just like kept on
 

6487
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:49,750
just like kept on
hammering at our system and identifying

6488
01:42:49,750 --> 01:42:49,760
hammering at our system and identifying
 

6489
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:51,109
hammering at our system and identifying
all of the weaknesses

6490
01:42:51,109 --> 01:42:51,119
all of the weaknesses
 

6491
01:42:51,119 --> 01:42:53,270
all of the weaknesses
and just like forcing our clients to do

6492
01:42:53,270 --> 01:42:53,280
and just like forcing our clients to do
 

6493
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:54,149
and just like forcing our clients to do
this you know

6494
01:42:54,149 --> 01:42:54,159
this you know
 

6495
01:42:54,159 --> 01:42:56,149
this you know
rapid sprint of just like optimizing the

6496
01:42:56,149 --> 01:42:56,159
rapid sprint of just like optimizing the
 

6497
01:42:56,159 --> 01:42:57,830
rapid sprint of just like optimizing the
hell out of everything and make sure

6498
01:42:57,830 --> 01:42:57,840
hell out of everything and make sure
 

6499
01:42:57,840 --> 01:42:59,990
hell out of everything and make sure
there aren't any of those uh dust blocks

6500
01:42:59,990 --> 01:43:00,000
there aren't any of those uh dust blocks
 

6501
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:00,950
there aren't any of those uh dust blocks
or uh

6502
01:43:00,950 --> 01:43:00,960
or uh
 

6503
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:03,590
or uh
and dust bugs remaining um so that was

6504
01:43:03,590 --> 01:43:03,600
and dust bugs remaining um so that was
 

6505
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:04,629
and dust bugs remaining um so that was
another example

6506
01:43:04,629 --> 01:43:04,639
another example
 

6507
01:43:04,639 --> 01:43:06,470
another example
and then like as a counterpoint as a

6508
01:43:06,470 --> 01:43:06,480
and then like as a counterpoint as a
 

6509
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:07,750
and then like as a counterpoint as a
counter example so

6510
01:43:07,750 --> 01:43:07,760
counter example so
 

6511
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:09,830
counter example so
like something that also shows the point

6512
01:43:09,830 --> 01:43:09,840
like something that also shows the point
 

6513
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:10,790
like something that also shows the point
from the other side

6514
01:43:10,790 --> 01:43:10,800
from the other side
 

6515
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:13,510
from the other side
um bitcoin had this bug in 2010 right

6516
01:43:13,510 --> 01:43:13,520
um bitcoin had this bug in 2010 right
 

6517
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:13,990
um bitcoin had this bug in 2010 right
the

6518
01:43:13,990 --> 01:43:14,000
the
 

6519
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:17,750
the
balance overflow bug basically someone

6520
01:43:17,750 --> 01:43:17,760
balance overflow bug basically someone
 

6521
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:19,430
balance overflow bug basically someone
created a transaction that had two

6522
01:43:19,430 --> 01:43:19,440
created a transaction that had two
 

6523
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:20,950
created a transaction that had two
outputs and those

6524
01:43:20,950 --> 01:43:20,960
outputs and those
 

6525
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:23,990
outputs and those
outputs had were both of a few billion

6526
01:43:23,990 --> 01:43:24,000
outputs had were both of a few billion
 

6527
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:25,990
outputs had were both of a few billion
bitcoin so like about two to the power

6528
01:43:25,990 --> 01:43:26,000
bitcoin so like about two to the power
 

6529
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:27,830
bitcoin so like about two to the power
of 63 satoshis

6530
01:43:27,830 --> 01:43:27,840
of 63 satoshis
 

6531
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:28,950
of 63 satoshis
and then if you add those numbers

6532
01:43:28,950 --> 01:43:28,960
and then if you add those numbers
 

6533
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:30,709
and then if you add those numbers
together you you go above to the power

6534
01:43:30,709 --> 01:43:30,719
together you you go above to the power
 

6535
01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:31,669
together you you go above to the power
of 64.

6536
01:43:31,669 --> 01:43:31,679
of 64.
 

6537
01:43:31,679 --> 01:43:33,830
of 64.
and of course you know computers like

6538
01:43:33,830 --> 01:43:33,840
and of course you know computers like
 

6539
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:36,070
and of course you know computers like
once you go above to the power of 64 you

6540
01:43:36,070 --> 01:43:36,080
once you go above to the power of 64 you
 

6541
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:36,870
once you go above to the power of 64 you
wrap around

6542
01:43:36,870 --> 01:43:36,880
wrap around
 

6543
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:39,830
wrap around
and so the bitcoin nodes thought that

6544
01:43:39,830 --> 01:43:39,840
and so the bitcoin nodes thought that
 

6545
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:41,030
and so the bitcoin nodes thought that
there was enough money to pay for the

6546
01:43:41,030 --> 01:43:41,040
there was enough money to pay for the
 

6547
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:42,550
there was enough money to pay for the
transaction because it was asking for

6548
01:43:42,550 --> 01:43:42,560
transaction because it was asking for
 

6549
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:43,990
transaction because it was asking for
let's say like a billion satoshis or

6550
01:43:43,990 --> 01:43:44,000
let's say like a billion satoshis or
 

6551
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,830
let's say like a billion satoshis or
something but actually it was asking for

6552
01:43:45,830 --> 01:43:45,840
something but actually it was asking for
 

6553
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:48,629
something but actually it was asking for
to the power of 64 plus a billion and so

6554
01:43:48,629 --> 01:43:48,639
to the power of 64 plus a billion and so
 

6555
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:49,990
to the power of 64 plus a billion and so
you know the attacker just managed to

6556
01:43:49,990 --> 01:43:50,000
you know the attacker just managed to
 

6557
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:50,790
you know the attacker just managed to
create like

6558
01:43:50,790 --> 01:43:50,800
create like
 

6559
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:53,830
create like
billions of bitcoin out of thin air and

6560
01:43:53,830 --> 01:43:53,840
billions of bitcoin out of thin air and
 

6561
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:57,270
billions of bitcoin out of thin air and
this was not only discovered and fixed

6562
01:43:57,270 --> 01:43:57,280
this was not only discovered and fixed
 

6563
01:43:57,280 --> 01:43:59,350
this was not only discovered and fixed
after something like 12 hours

6564
01:43:59,350 --> 01:43:59,360
after something like 12 hours
 

6565
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:02,229
after something like 12 hours
um but you know if there had been like

6566
01:44:02,229 --> 01:44:02,239
um but you know if there had been like
 

6567
01:44:02,239 --> 01:44:03,590
um but you know if there had been like
if bitcoin had been a multiple

6568
01:44:03,590 --> 01:44:03,600
if bitcoin had been a multiple
 

6569
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:05,030
if bitcoin had been a multiple
implementation system

6570
01:44:05,030 --> 01:44:05,040
implementation system
 

6571
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:07,590
implementation system
then what would have almost certainly

6572
01:44:07,590 --> 01:44:07,600
then what would have almost certainly
 

6573
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:08,149
then what would have almost certainly
happened

6574
01:44:08,149 --> 01:44:08,159
happened
 

6575
01:44:08,159 --> 01:44:10,070
happened
is like one of the clients would have

6576
01:44:10,070 --> 01:44:10,080
is like one of the clients would have
 

6577
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:11,669
is like one of the clients would have
bugged out but the other clients would

6578
01:44:11,669 --> 01:44:11,679
bugged out but the other clients would
 

6579
01:44:11,679 --> 01:44:12,149
bugged out but the other clients would
have

6580
01:44:12,149 --> 01:44:12,159
have
 

6581
01:44:12,159 --> 01:44:14,070
have
probably you know actually had a check

6582
01:44:14,070 --> 01:44:14,080
probably you know actually had a check
 

6583
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:15,830
probably you know actually had a check
for that right and so

6584
01:44:15,830 --> 01:44:15,840
for that right and so
 

6585
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:16,950
for that right and so
there would have been a consensus

6586
01:44:16,950 --> 01:44:16,960
there would have been a consensus
 

6587
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:19,510
there would have been a consensus
failure but at least that would have

6588
01:44:19,510 --> 01:44:19,520
failure but at least that would have
 

6589
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:21,830
failure but at least that would have
um like alerted everyone that there is a

6590
01:44:21,830 --> 01:44:21,840
um like alerted everyone that there is a
 

6591
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:23,270
um like alerted everyone that there is a
problem very

6592
01:44:23,270 --> 01:44:23,280
problem very
 

6593
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:25,189
problem very
quickly and it also would have given

6594
01:44:25,189 --> 01:44:25,199
quickly and it also would have given
 

6595
01:44:25,199 --> 01:44:26,790
quickly and it also would have given
everyone just like obvious social

6596
01:44:26,790 --> 01:44:26,800
everyone just like obvious social
 

6597
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:27,830
everyone just like obvious social
permission to go and

6598
01:44:27,830 --> 01:44:27,840
permission to go and
 

6599
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:29,590
permission to go and
you know pick which whichever one of the

6600
01:44:29,590 --> 01:44:29,600
you know pick which whichever one of the
 

6601
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:31,510
you know pick which whichever one of the
chains is correct and solve the problem

6602
01:44:31,510 --> 01:44:31,520
chains is correct and solve the problem
 

6603
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:34,709
chains is correct and solve the problem
um so like that's

6604
01:44:34,709 --> 01:44:34,719
um so like that's
 

6605
01:44:34,719 --> 01:44:36,870
um so like that's
i think a big learning that we've had

6606
01:44:36,870 --> 01:44:36,880
i think a big learning that we've had
 

6607
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:37,910
i think a big learning that we've had
from multiple

6608
01:44:37,910 --> 01:44:37,920
from multiple
 

6609
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:39,590
from multiple
of our experiences in the ethereum

6610
01:44:39,590 --> 01:44:39,600
of our experiences in the ethereum
 

6611
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:40,950
of our experiences in the ethereum
ecosystem just like

6612
01:44:40,950 --> 01:44:40,960
ecosystem just like
 

6613
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:43,189
ecosystem just like
validating this multi-client model you

6614
01:44:43,189 --> 01:44:43,199
validating this multi-client model you
 

6615
01:44:43,199 --> 01:44:44,709
validating this multi-client model you
know to be fair it's a model that we get

6616
01:44:44,709 --> 01:44:44,719
know to be fair it's a model that we get
 

6617
01:44:44,719 --> 01:44:46,790
know to be fair it's a model that we get
criticized for a lot right like

6618
01:44:46,790 --> 01:44:46,800
criticized for a lot right like
 

6619
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:48,310
criticized for a lot right like
bitcoin people talk about you know the

6620
01:44:48,310 --> 01:44:48,320
bitcoin people talk about you know the
 

6621
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:49,990
bitcoin people talk about you know the
risk of consensus failures that this

6622
01:44:49,990 --> 01:44:50,000
risk of consensus failures that this
 

6623
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:50,709
risk of consensus failures that this
creates

6624
01:44:50,709 --> 01:44:50,719
creates
 

6625
01:44:50,719 --> 01:44:53,350
creates
um vc types are like well you know isn't

6626
01:44:53,350 --> 01:44:53,360
um vc types are like well you know isn't
 

6627
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:55,109
um vc types are like well you know isn't
it expensive and wasteful to funds three

6628
01:44:55,109 --> 01:44:55,119
it expensive and wasteful to funds three
 

6629
01:44:55,119 --> 01:44:56,390
it expensive and wasteful to funds three
software teams where you could just be

6630
01:44:56,390 --> 01:44:56,400
software teams where you could just be
 

6631
01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:57,669
software teams where you could just be
making you know one

6632
01:44:57,669 --> 01:44:57,679
making you know one
 

6633
01:44:57,679 --> 01:44:59,750
making you know one
quote focused effort you know they love

6634
01:44:59,750 --> 01:44:59,760
quote focused effort you know they love
 

6635
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:01,350
quote focused effort you know they love
the word focused and like you know

6636
01:45:01,350 --> 01:45:01,360
the word focused and like you know
 

6637
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:03,030
the word focused and like you know
ethereum is not that but it's amazing

6638
01:45:03,030 --> 01:45:03,040
ethereum is not that but it's amazing
 

6639
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:04,470
ethereum is not that but it's amazing
despite not being that

6640
01:45:04,470 --> 01:45:04,480
despite not being that
 

6641
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:08,550
despite not being that
yeah um the

6642
01:45:08,550 --> 01:45:08,560

 

6643
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:12,070

basically yes so that was interesting

6644
01:45:12,070 --> 01:45:12,080
basically yes so that was interesting
 

6645
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:13,669
basically yes so that was interesting
and and then you know there have

6646
01:45:13,669 --> 01:45:13,679
and and then you know there have
 

6647
01:45:13,679 --> 01:45:15,750
and and then you know there have
definitely been other

6648
01:45:15,750 --> 01:45:15,760
definitely been other
 

6649
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:17,590
definitely been other
learnings as well just from like seeing

6650
01:45:17,590 --> 01:45:17,600
learnings as well just from like seeing
 

6651
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:18,870
learnings as well just from like seeing
the chain live and

6652
01:45:18,870 --> 01:45:18,880
the chain live and
 

6653
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:21,669
the chain live and
you know seeing what actually is the

6654
01:45:21,669 --> 01:45:21,679
you know seeing what actually is the
 

6655
01:45:21,679 --> 01:45:22,790
you know seeing what actually is the
staking experience

6656
01:45:22,790 --> 01:45:22,800
staking experience
 

6657
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:24,950
staking experience
like what are the actual incentives for

6658
01:45:24,950 --> 01:45:24,960
like what are the actual incentives for
 

6659
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:26,470
like what are the actual incentives for
all the different participants um

6660
01:45:26,470 --> 01:45:26,480
all the different participants um
 

6661
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:28,550
all the different participants um
so i definitely feel like we're gaining

6662
01:45:28,550 --> 01:45:28,560
so i definitely feel like we're gaining
 

6663
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:30,790
so i definitely feel like we're gaining
a lot from this sort of one year of uh

6664
01:45:30,790 --> 01:45:30,800
a lot from this sort of one year of uh
 

6665
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:32,310
a lot from this sort of one year of uh
trial running the chain before we

6666
01:45:32,310 --> 01:45:32,320
trial running the chain before we
 

6667
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:34,070
trial running the chain before we
actually make all of ethereum depend on

6668
01:45:34,070 --> 01:45:34,080
actually make all of ethereum depend on
 

6669
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:35,510
actually make all of ethereum depend on
it

6670
01:45:35,510 --> 01:45:35,520
it
 

6671
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:37,510
it
let me ask uh perhaps a strange question

6672
01:45:37,510 --> 01:45:37,520
let me ask uh perhaps a strange question
 

6673
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:39,750
let me ask uh perhaps a strange question
but uh you know proponents of bitcoin

6674
01:45:39,750 --> 01:45:39,760
but uh you know proponents of bitcoin
 

6675
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:40,470
but uh you know proponents of bitcoin
will say

6676
01:45:40,470 --> 01:45:40,480
will say
 

6677
01:45:40,480 --> 01:45:44,070
will say
uh things like bitcoin fixes everything

6678
01:45:44,070 --> 01:45:44,080
uh things like bitcoin fixes everything
 

6679
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:47,430
uh things like bitcoin fixes everything
so why do we need ethereum

6680
01:45:47,430 --> 01:45:47,440
so why do we need ethereum
 

6681
01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:51,270
so why do we need ethereum
uh versus like bitcoin

6682
01:45:51,270 --> 01:45:51,280
uh versus like bitcoin
 

6683
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:54,070
uh versus like bitcoin
plus lightning network for scalability

6684
01:45:54,070 --> 01:45:54,080
plus lightning network for scalability
 

6685
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:56,149
plus lightning network for scalability
uh and then using bitcoin for

6686
01:45:56,149 --> 01:45:56,159
uh and then using bitcoin for
 

6687
01:45:56,159 --> 01:45:58,870
uh and then using bitcoin for
with this proof of work for security so

6688
01:45:58,870 --> 01:45:58,880
with this proof of work for security so
 

6689
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:00,870
with this proof of work for security so
in this kind of um

6690
01:46:00,870 --> 01:46:00,880
in this kind of um
 

6691
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:02,629
in this kind of um
it is perhaps sort of a strange question

6692
01:46:02,629 --> 01:46:02,639
it is perhaps sort of a strange question
 

6693
01:46:02,639 --> 01:46:04,070
it is perhaps sort of a strange question
but it's a high-level question

6694
01:46:04,070 --> 01:46:04,080
but it's a high-level question
 

6695
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:07,189
but it's a high-level question
why do we need another technology

6696
01:46:07,189 --> 01:46:07,199
why do we need another technology
 

6697
01:46:07,199 --> 01:46:09,669
why do we need another technology
yes there's a bunch of nice features but

6698
01:46:09,669 --> 01:46:09,679
yes there's a bunch of nice features but
 

6699
01:46:09,679 --> 01:46:10,310
yes there's a bunch of nice features but
like

6700
01:46:10,310 --> 01:46:10,320
like
 

6701
01:46:10,320 --> 01:46:13,109
like
doesn't bitcoin fix everything already

6702
01:46:13,109 --> 01:46:13,119
doesn't bitcoin fix everything already
 

6703
01:46:13,119 --> 01:46:13,510
doesn't bitcoin fix everything already
so

6704
01:46:13,510 --> 01:46:13,520
so
 

6705
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:16,070
so
and the thing that always attracted me

6706
01:46:16,070 --> 01:46:16,080
and the thing that always attracted me
 

6707
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:16,629
and the thing that always attracted me
about

6708
01:46:16,629 --> 01:46:16,639
about
 

6709
01:46:16,639 --> 01:46:19,270
about
bitcoin is you know these values of you

6710
01:46:19,270 --> 01:46:19,280
bitcoin is you know these values of you
 

6711
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:21,430
bitcoin is you know these values of you
know decentralization creating these

6712
01:46:21,430 --> 01:46:21,440
know decentralization creating these
 

6713
01:46:21,440 --> 01:46:23,510
know decentralization creating these
open provisional systems that anyone can

6714
01:46:23,510 --> 01:46:23,520
open provisional systems that anyone can
 

6715
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:24,629
open provisional systems that anyone can
participate in

6716
01:46:24,629 --> 01:46:24,639
participate in
 

6717
01:46:24,639 --> 01:46:26,709
participate in
and that aren't just going to flop over

6718
01:46:26,709 --> 01:46:26,719
and that aren't just going to flop over
 

6719
01:46:26,719 --> 01:46:28,310
and that aren't just going to flop over
and die if whoever created them gets

6720
01:46:28,310 --> 01:46:28,320
and die if whoever created them gets
 

6721
01:46:28,320 --> 01:46:29,910
and die if whoever created them gets
bored and like no

6722
01:46:29,910 --> 01:46:29,920
bored and like no
 

6723
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:33,350
bored and like no
that are resistance to like whoever runs

6724
01:46:33,350 --> 01:46:33,360
that are resistance to like whoever runs
 

6725
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:34,709
that are resistance to like whoever runs
them breaking the rules and all of these

6726
01:46:34,709 --> 01:46:34,719
them breaking the rules and all of these
 

6727
01:46:34,719 --> 01:46:35,830
them breaking the rules and all of these
things right and

6728
01:46:35,830 --> 01:46:35,840
things right and
 

6729
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:37,990
things right and
i think that pretty strongly that these

6730
01:46:37,990 --> 01:46:38,000
i think that pretty strongly that these
 

6731
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:39,109
i think that pretty strongly that these
principles are

6732
01:46:39,109 --> 01:46:39,119
principles are
 

6733
01:46:39,119 --> 01:46:41,030
principles are
like really valid in importance to much

6734
01:46:41,030 --> 01:46:41,040
like really valid in importance to much
 

6735
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:42,550
like really valid in importance to much
more things than just money right like

6736
01:46:42,550 --> 01:46:42,560
more things than just money right like
 

6737
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:43,270
more things than just money right like
bitcoin is

6738
01:46:43,270 --> 01:46:43,280
bitcoin is
 

6739
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:45,590
bitcoin is
uh the blockchain for money and ethereum

6740
01:46:45,590 --> 01:46:45,600
uh the blockchain for money and ethereum
 

6741
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:46,310
uh the blockchain for money and ethereum
is uh

6742
01:46:46,310 --> 01:46:46,320
is uh
 

6743
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:47,830
is uh
built from the start as a general

6744
01:46:47,830 --> 01:46:47,840
built from the start as a general
 

6745
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:49,669
built from the start as a general
purpose blockchain right it's you know

6746
01:46:49,669 --> 01:46:49,679
purpose blockchain right it's you know
 

6747
01:46:49,679 --> 01:46:51,669
purpose blockchain right it's you know
there is ether the asset on ethereum but

6748
01:46:51,669 --> 01:46:51,679
there is ether the asset on ethereum but
 

6749
01:46:51,679 --> 01:46:53,350
there is ether the asset on ethereum but
then you can also make

6750
01:46:53,350 --> 01:46:53,360
then you can also make
 

6751
01:46:53,360 --> 01:46:56,229
then you can also make
you know decentralized financial things

6752
01:46:56,229 --> 01:46:56,239
you know decentralized financial things
 

6753
01:46:56,239 --> 01:46:57,830
you know decentralized financial things
what we call d5 today

6754
01:46:57,830 --> 01:46:57,840
what we call d5 today
 

6755
01:46:57,840 --> 01:46:59,510
what we call d5 today
um you know you can make like ens the

6756
01:46:59,510 --> 01:46:59,520
um you know you can make like ens the
 

6757
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:01,750
um you know you can make like ens the
decentralized domain name system

6758
01:47:01,750 --> 01:47:01,760
decentralized domain name system
 

6759
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:04,550
decentralized domain name system
um you can put make prediction markets

6760
01:47:04,550 --> 01:47:04,560
um you can put make prediction markets
 

6761
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:05,030
um you can put make prediction markets
on it

6762
01:47:05,030 --> 01:47:05,040
on it
 

6763
01:47:05,040 --> 01:47:08,629
on it
you can make totally non-financial

6764
01:47:08,629 --> 01:47:08,639
you can make totally non-financial
 

6765
01:47:08,639 --> 01:47:10,709
you can make totally non-financial
systems that just like keep track of

6766
01:47:10,709 --> 01:47:10,719
systems that just like keep track of
 

6767
01:47:10,719 --> 01:47:11,910
systems that just like keep track of
whether or not

6768
01:47:11,910 --> 01:47:11,920
whether or not
 

6769
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:13,669
whether or not
some certificate was signed or whether

6770
01:47:13,669 --> 01:47:13,679
some certificate was signed or whether
 

6771
01:47:13,679 --> 01:47:15,830
some certificate was signed or whether
or not some like cryptographic key got

6772
01:47:15,830 --> 01:47:15,840
or not some like cryptographic key got
 

6773
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:16,709
or not some like cryptographic key got
revoked

6774
01:47:16,709 --> 01:47:16,719
revoked
 

6775
01:47:16,719 --> 01:47:20,390
revoked
there's this big long list of like just

6776
01:47:20,390 --> 01:47:20,400
there's this big long list of like just
 

6777
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:21,750
there's this big long list of like just
interesting things that you could use

6778
01:47:21,750 --> 01:47:21,760
interesting things that you could use
 

6779
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:23,109
interesting things that you could use
about blockchains to do

6780
01:47:23,109 --> 01:47:23,119
about blockchains to do
 

6781
01:47:23,119 --> 01:47:25,510
about blockchains to do
right like basically they are sort of

6782
01:47:25,510 --> 01:47:25,520
right like basically they are sort of
 

6783
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:26,470
right like basically they are sort of
the missing piece

6784
01:47:26,470 --> 01:47:26,480
the missing piece
 

6785
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:29,830
the missing piece
that um where without them the kinds of

6786
01:47:29,830 --> 01:47:29,840
that um where without them the kinds of
 

6787
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:31,189
that um where without them the kinds of
things that a decentralized computer

6788
01:47:31,189 --> 01:47:31,199
things that a decentralized computer
 

6789
01:47:31,199 --> 01:47:32,709
things that a decentralized computer
network can do is very limited

6790
01:47:32,709 --> 01:47:32,719
network can do is very limited
 

6791
01:47:32,719 --> 01:47:34,070
network can do is very limited
and once you have them you know a lot of

6792
01:47:34,070 --> 01:47:34,080
and once you have them you know a lot of
 

6793
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:35,990
and once you have them you know a lot of
those limitations end up going away

6794
01:47:35,990 --> 01:47:36,000
those limitations end up going away
 

6795
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:39,830
those limitations end up going away
uh and so

6796
01:47:39,830 --> 01:47:39,840
uh and so
 

6797
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:41,510
uh and so
ethereum was like always from the

6798
01:47:41,510 --> 01:47:41,520
ethereum was like always from the
 

6799
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:43,430
ethereum was like always from the
beginning about that right it's about

6800
01:47:43,430 --> 01:47:43,440
beginning about that right it's about
 

6801
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:44,070
beginning about that right it's about
like hey

6802
01:47:44,070 --> 01:47:44,080
like hey
 

6803
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:46,390
like hey
this isn't just money this is there's so

6804
01:47:46,390 --> 01:47:46,400
this isn't just money this is there's so
 

6805
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:48,070
this isn't just money this is there's so
much more that you could do

6806
01:47:48,070 --> 01:47:48,080
much more that you could do
 

6807
01:47:48,080 --> 01:47:50,390
much more that you could do
if you could just go ahead and make any

6808
01:47:50,390 --> 01:47:50,400
if you could just go ahead and make any
 

6809
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:51,430
if you could just go ahead and make any
infrastructure

6810
01:47:51,430 --> 01:47:51,440

6822
01:48:04,070 --> 01:48:04,080
see what's going on or you know if you
 

6823
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:05,510
see what's going on or you know if you
like your zero knowledge proofs at least

6824
01:48:05,510 --> 01:48:05,520
like your zero knowledge proofs at least
 

6825
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:07,109
like your zero knowledge proofs at least
everyone can see proofs that prove to

you that
 

6829
01:48:07,679 --> 01:48:10,229
you that
what's going on follows the rules um and

6830
01:48:10,229 --> 01:48:10,239
what's going on follows the rules um and
 

6831
01:48:10,239 --> 01:48:11,270
what's going on follows the rules um and
you don't need to

6832
01:48:11,270 --> 01:48:11,280
you don't need to
 

6833
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:13,590
you don't need to
like just constantly keep trusting

6834
01:48:13,590 --> 01:48:13,600
like just constantly keep trusting
 

6835
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:14,870
like just constantly keep trusting

with the world than
 

6857
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:38,070
with the world than
just money right like i'm not one of

6858

these people who thinks that
 

6861
01:48:39,679 --> 01:48:41,990
these people who thinks that
you know if you get rid of fiat currency

6862
01:48:41,990 --> 01:48:42,000
you know if you get rid of fiat currency
 

6863
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,430
you know if you get rid of fiat currency
and you replace it with cryptocurrency

6864
01:48:43,430 --> 01:48:43,440
and you replace it with cryptocurrency
 

6865
01:48:43,440 --> 01:48:45,109
and you replace it with cryptocurrency
then suddenly wars are going to go away

6866
01:48:45,109 --> 01:48:45,119
then suddenly wars are going to go away
 

6867
01:48:45,119 --> 01:48:46,149

the things i don't even get about their
philosophy like

6886
01:49:01,350 --> 01:49:01,360
philosophy like
 

6887
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:02,870

that these governments are terrible
 

6895
01:49:08,639 --> 01:49:10,870
that these governments are terrible
right like we we know today that

6896
01:49:10,870 --> 01:49:10,880
right like we we know today that
 

6897
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:13,510
right like we we know today that
governments find a combination of

6898
01:49:13,510 --> 01:49:13,520
governments find a combination of
 

6899
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:16,070
governments find a combination of
you know things like welfare and things

6900
01:49:16,070 --> 01:49:16,080
you know things like welfare and things
 

6901
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:18,310
you know things like welfare and things
like you know the military that

6902
01:49:18,310 --> 01:49:18,320
like you know the military that
 

6903
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:19,910
like you know the military that
you know goes and like bombs people in

you know goes and like bombs people in
 

6905
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:21,669
you know goes and like bombs people in
afghanistan right and

6906

afghanistan right and
 

6907
01:49:21,679 --> 01:49:23,350
afghanistan right and
the so the question you have to ask is

6908
01:49:23,350 --> 01:49:23,360
the so the question you have to ask is
 

6909
01:49:23,360 --> 01:49:24,709
the so the question you have to ask is
like okay you

6910
01:49:24,709 --> 01:49:24,719
like okay you
 

6911
01:49:24,719 --> 01:49:28,470
like okay you
um with your new um you know

6912
01:49:28,470 --> 01:49:28,480
um with your new um you know
 

6913
01:49:28,480 --> 01:49:30,550
um with your new um you know
magic newfangled cyber currency that

6914
01:49:30,550 --> 01:49:30,560
magic newfangled cyber currency that
 

6915
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:32,070
magic newfangled cyber currency that
takes over the world

6916
01:49:32,070 --> 01:49:32,080
takes over the world
 

6917
01:49:32,080 --> 01:49:33,750
takes over the world
take away the government's ability to

6918
01:49:33,750 --> 01:49:33,760
take away the government's ability to
 

6919
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:35,430
take away the government's ability to
have seniors revenue and so you reduce

6920
01:49:35,430 --> 01:49:35,440
have seniors revenue and so you reduce
 

6921
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:37,589
have seniors revenue and so you reduce
the government's revenue by 10

6922
01:49:37,589 --> 01:49:37,599
the government's revenue by 10
 

6923
01:49:37,599 --> 01:49:39,750
the government's revenue by 10
if the government is that evil which

6924
01:49:39,750 --> 01:49:39,760
if the government is that evil which
 

6925
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:41,030
if the government is that evil which
portion of its um

6926
01:49:41,030 --> 01:49:41,040
portion of its um
 

6927
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:43,030
portion of its um
expenses is it going to take that 10

6928
01:49:43,030 --> 01:49:43,040
expenses is it going to take that 10
 

6929
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:44,950
expenses is it going to take that 10
from is it gonna stop the bombing people

6930
01:49:44,950 --> 01:49:44,960
from is it gonna stop the bombing people
 

6931
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:46,390
from is it gonna stop the bombing people
in afghanistan or is it going to cut

6932
01:49:46,390 --> 01:49:46,400
in afghanistan or is it going to cut
 

6933
01:49:46,400 --> 01:49:47,510
in afghanistan or is it going to cut
welfare

6934
01:49:47,510 --> 01:49:47,520
welfare
 

6935
01:49:47,520 --> 01:49:48,790
welfare
if you think it's the first you have a

6936
01:49:48,790 --> 01:49:48,800
if you think it's the first you have a
 

6937
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:50,790
if you think it's the first you have a
very optimistic view of the government

6938
01:49:50,790 --> 01:49:50,800
very optimistic view of the government
 

6939
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:54,070
very optimistic view of the government
right so that's

6940
01:49:54,070 --> 01:49:54,080
right so that's
 

6941
01:49:54,080 --> 01:49:57,350
right so that's
i guess my perspective on like why the

6942
01:49:57,350 --> 01:49:57,360
i guess my perspective on like why the
 

6943
01:49:57,360 --> 01:49:58,390
i guess my perspective on like why the

really make much sense for me

6956
01:50:09,350 --> 01:50:09,360
really make much sense for me
 

6957
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:11,109
really make much sense for me
and i do think that there is real value

6958
01:50:11,109 --> 01:50:11,119
and i do think that there is real value
 

6959
01:50:11,119 --> 01:50:12,950
and i do think that there is real value
that comes from a

6960
01:50:12,950 --> 01:50:12,960
that comes from a
 

6961
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:15,109
that comes from a
decentralized and open currency like

6962
01:50:15,109 --> 01:50:15,119
decentralized and open currency like
 

6963
01:50:15,119 --> 01:50:17,589
decentralized and open currency like
just the fact that there is a financial

6964
01:50:17,589 --> 01:50:17,599
just the fact that there is a financial
 

6965
01:50:17,599 --> 01:50:19,430
just the fact that there is a financial
infrastructure that anyone in the world

6966
01:50:19,430 --> 01:50:19,440
infrastructure that anyone in the world
 

6967
01:50:19,440 --> 01:50:19,910
infrastructure that anyone in the world
can

6968
01:50:19,910 --> 01:50:19,920
can
 

6969
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:21,589
can
you know go ahead and use right like

6970
01:50:21,589 --> 01:50:21,599
you know go ahead and use right like
 

6971
01:50:21,599 --> 01:50:23,109
you know go ahead and use right like
it's

6972
01:50:23,109 --> 01:50:23,119
it's
 

6973
01:50:23,119 --> 01:50:24,550
it's
and that's something that can easily be

6974
01:50:24,550 --> 01:50:24,560
and that's something that can easily be
 

6975
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:25,990
and that's something that can easily be
a big boon for people right there's a

6976
01:50:25,990 --> 01:50:26,000
a big boon for people right there's a
 

6977
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:27,270
a big boon for people right there's a
lot of places

6978
01:50:27,270 --> 01:50:27,280
lot of places
 

6979
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:30,629
lot of places
where the uh currency and

6980
01:50:30,629 --> 01:50:30,639
where the uh currency and
 

6981
01:50:30,639 --> 01:50:34,149
where the uh currency and
is much less stable than the dollar and

6982
01:50:34,149 --> 01:50:34,159
is much less stable than the dollar and
 

6983
01:50:34,159 --> 01:50:35,430
is much less stable than the dollar and
you know these people like they don't

6984
01:50:35,430 --> 01:50:35,440
you know these people like they don't
 

6985

their only option is to get big ones
right which you know are also pretty

6990
01:50:40,390 --> 01:50:40,400
right which you know are also pretty
 

6991
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:41,189
right which you know are also pretty
volatile

um if they use ethereum then you know

6994
01:50:43,430 --> 01:50:43,440
um if they use ethereum then you know
 

6995
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:44,629
um if they use ethereum then you know
they can get ether but then they can

6996
01:50:44,629 --> 01:50:44,639
they can get ether but then they can
 

6997
01:50:44,639 --> 01:50:45,990
they can get ether but then they can
also get stable coins right

6998
01:50:45,990 --> 01:50:46,000
also get stable coins right
 

6999
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:47,990
also get stable coins right
and you might think that you know oh

7000
01:50:47,990 --> 01:50:48,000
and you might think that you know oh
 

7001
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:49,750
and you might think that you know oh
you're not being ideologically pure

7002
01:50:49,750 --> 01:50:49,760
you're not being ideologically pure
 

7003
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:51,030
you're not being ideologically pure
now you're giving them stable coins

7004
01:50:51,030 --> 01:50:51,040
now you're giving them stable coins
 

7005
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:52,310
now you're giving them stable coins
which are mirroring dollars and

7006
01:50:52,310 --> 01:50:52,320
which are mirroring dollars and
 

7007
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:53,669
which are mirroring dollars and
obviously dollars are going to collapse

7008
01:50:53,669 --> 01:50:53,679
obviously dollars are going to collapse
 

7009
01:50:53,679 --> 01:50:54,149
obviously dollars are going to collapse
too

7010
01:50:54,149 --> 01:50:54,159
too
 

7011
01:50:54,159 --> 01:50:55,750
too
but the reality is that delvers are

7012
01:50:55,750 --> 01:50:55,760
but the reality is that delvers are
 

7013
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:57,350
but the reality is that delvers are
vastly more stable than the venezuelan

7014
01:50:57,350 --> 01:50:57,360
vastly more stable than the venezuelan
 

7015
01:50:57,360 --> 01:50:58,390
vastly more stable than the venezuelan
bolivar

so like there are

7018
01:51:01,430 --> 01:51:01,440
so like there are
 

7019
01:51:01,440 --> 01:51:04,149
so like there are
really like meaningful and beneficial

7020
01:51:04,149 --> 01:51:04,159
really like meaningful and beneficial
 

7021
01:51:04,159 --> 01:51:05,189
really like meaningful and beneficial
things that you can

7022
01:51:05,189 --> 01:51:05,199
things that you can
 

7023
01:51:05,199 --> 01:51:07,669
things that you can
give to people by create having a global

7024
01:51:07,669 --> 01:51:07,679
give to people by create having a global
 

7025
01:51:07,679 --> 01:51:09,030
give to people by create having a global
and open financial system

7026
01:51:09,030 --> 01:51:09,040
and open financial system
 

7027
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:11,350
and open financial system
but i think if you want to actually do

7028
01:51:11,350 --> 01:51:11,360
but i think if you want to actually do
 

7029
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:12,709
but i think if you want to actually do
that like you have to have much more

7030
01:51:12,709 --> 01:51:12,719
that like you have to have much more
 

7031
01:51:12,719 --> 01:51:14,149
that like you have to have much more
than just a currency right

7032
01:51:14,149 --> 01:51:14,159
than just a currency right
 

7033
01:51:14,159 --> 01:51:15,350
than just a currency right
and then if you want to go beyond

7034
01:51:15,350 --> 01:51:15,360
and then if you want to go beyond
 

7035
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:17,189
and then if you want to go beyond
financial things then you know you have

7036
01:51:17,189 --> 01:51:17,199
financial things then you know you have
 

7037
01:51:17,199 --> 01:51:17,750
financial things then you know you have
to

7038
01:51:17,750 --> 01:51:17,760
to
 

7039
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:20,790
to
obviously have much more than a currency

7040
01:51:20,790 --> 01:51:20,800
obviously have much more than a currency
 

7041
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:21,350
obviously have much more than a currency
and then

7042
01:51:21,350 --> 01:51:21,360
and then
 

7043
01:51:21,360 --> 01:51:23,030
and then
you know you also have to actually

7044
01:51:23,030 --> 01:51:23,040
you know you also have to actually
 

7045
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:24,870
you know you also have to actually
actually take scalability seriously

7046
01:51:24,870 --> 01:51:24,880
actually take scalability seriously
 

7047
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:26,470
actually take scalability seriously
because the non-financial applications

7048
01:51:26,470 --> 01:51:26,480
because the non-financial applications
 

7049
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:27,990
because the non-financial applications
like nobody's going to pay five dollars

7050

um so and i definitely you know don't
 

7137
01:53:08,480 --> 01:53:10,310
um so and i definitely you know don't
think ethereum is opposed to dot coins i

7138
01:53:10,310 --> 01:53:10,320
think ethereum is opposed to dot coins i
 

7139
01:53:10,320 --> 01:53:10,709
think ethereum is opposed to dot coins i
mean

7140
01:53:10,709 --> 01:53:10,719
mean
 

7141
01:53:10,719 --> 01:53:13,109

like i kind of wants to feel like you
 

7143
01:53:13,119 --> 01:53:14,550
like i kind of wants to feel like you
know ethereum is at least a little bit

7144
01:53:14,550 --> 01:53:14,560
know ethereum is at least a little bit
 

7145
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:16,390
know ethereum is at least a little bit
in spirit itself a dog coin and then you

7146
01:53:16,390 --> 01:53:16,400
in spirit itself a dog coin and then you
 

7147
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:18,310
in spirit itself a dog coin and then you
know as i'm as i mentioned you know i

7148
01:53:18,310 --> 01:53:18,320
know as i'm as i mentioned you know i
 

7149
01:53:18,320 --> 01:53:19,750
know as i'm as i mentioned you know i
love doge i bought

7150
01:53:19,750 --> 01:53:19,760
love doge i bought
 

7151
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:21,270
love doge i bought
i bought a bunch of doughs i still hold

7152
01:53:21,270 --> 01:53:21,280
i bought a bunch of doughs i still hold
 

7153
01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:22,790
i bought a bunch of doughs i still hold
some a bunch of dosh

7154
01:53:22,790 --> 01:53:22,800
some a bunch of dosh
 

7155
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:25,750
some a bunch of dosh
the on the scalability question like the

7156
01:53:25,750 --> 01:53:25,760
the on the scalability question like the
 

7157
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:27,510
the on the scalability question like the
challenge basically is like

7158
01:53:27,510 --> 01:53:27,520
challenge basically is like
 

7159
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:30,070
challenge basically is like
the limits uh scalability as a and the

7160
01:53:30,070 --> 01:53:30,080
the limits uh scalability as a and the
 

7161
01:53:30,080 --> 01:53:31,669
the limits uh scalability as a and the
trade-offs with centralization right

7162
01:53:31,669 --> 01:53:31,679
trade-offs with centralization right
 

7163
01:53:31,679 --> 01:53:32,950
trade-offs with centralization right
like if you just

7164
01:53:32,950 --> 01:53:32,960
like if you just
 

7165
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:34,390
like if you just
increase the parameters without doing

7166
01:53:34,390 --> 01:53:34,400
increase the parameters without doing
 

7167
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:36,229
increase the parameters without doing
anything else then it just becomes

7168
01:53:36,229 --> 01:53:36,239
anything else then it just becomes
 

7169
01:53:36,239 --> 01:53:37,750
anything else then it just becomes
more and more difficult for people to

7170
01:53:37,750 --> 01:53:37,760
more and more difficult for people to
 

7171
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:39,270
more and more difficult for people to
validate the chain and uh

7172
01:53:39,270 --> 01:53:39,280
validate the chain and uh
 

7173
01:53:39,280 --> 01:53:41,910
validate the chain and uh
just becomes more likely that the chain

7174
01:53:41,910 --> 01:53:41,920
just becomes more likely that the chain
 

7175
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:43,350
just becomes more likely that the chain
becomes centralized and

7176
01:53:43,350 --> 01:53:43,360
becomes centralized and
 

7177
01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:44,790
becomes centralized and
becomes vulnerable to all kinds of

7178
01:53:44,790 --> 01:53:44,800
becomes vulnerable to all kinds of
 

7179
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:47,270
becomes vulnerable to all kinds of
capture so does it need like

7180
01:53:47,270 --> 01:53:47,280
capture so does it need like
 

7181
01:53:47,280 --> 01:53:48,790
capture so does it need like
some of the layer two technologies that

7182
01:53:48,790 --> 01:53:48,800
some of the layer two technologies that
 

7183
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:50,310
some of the layer two technologies that
we've been talking about

7184
01:53:50,310 --> 01:53:50,320
we've been talking about
 

7185
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:52,229
we've been talking about
um i mean i personally think that you

7186
01:53:52,229 --> 01:53:52,239
um i mean i personally think that you
 

7187
01:53:52,239 --> 01:53:54,229
um i mean i personally think that you
know if doge wants to

7188
01:53:54,229 --> 01:53:54,239
know if doge wants to
 

7189
01:53:54,239 --> 01:53:55,830
know if doge wants to
somehow bridge to ethereum and then

7190
01:53:55,830 --> 01:53:55,840
somehow bridge to ethereum and then
 

7191
01:53:55,840 --> 01:53:58,149
somehow bridge to ethereum and then
people can trade doge thousands of times

7192
01:53:58,149 --> 01:53:58,159
people can trade doge thousands of times
 

7193
01:53:58,159 --> 01:53:59,189
people can trade doge thousands of times
a second inside of

7194
01:53:59,189 --> 01:53:59,199
a second inside of
 

7195
01:53:59,199 --> 01:54:00,390
a second inside of
loopering then you know that would be

7196
01:54:00,390 --> 01:54:00,400
loopering then you know that would be
 

7197
01:54:00,400 --> 01:54:02,950
loopering then you know that would be
amazing i mean if they want to just like

7198
01:54:02,950 --> 01:54:02,960
amazing i mean if they want to just like
 

7199
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:05,350
amazing i mean if they want to just like
take zika roll up style technology and

7200
01:54:05,350 --> 01:54:05,360
take zika roll up style technology and
 

7201
01:54:05,360 --> 01:54:07,109
take zika roll up style technology and
just have thousands of transactions a

7202
01:54:07,109 --> 01:54:07,119
just have thousands of transactions a
 

7203
01:54:07,119 --> 01:54:09,270
just have thousands of transactions a
second on their own chain then that's um

7204
01:54:09,270 --> 01:54:09,280
second on their own chain then that's um
 

7205
01:54:09,280 --> 01:54:10,709
second on their own chain then that's um
you know that would be a great outcome

7206
01:54:10,709 --> 01:54:10,719
you know that would be a great outcome
 

7207
01:54:10,719 --> 01:54:12,870
you know that would be a great outcome
as well so what is there ways for

7208
01:54:12,870 --> 01:54:12,880
as well so what is there ways for
 

7209
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:13,669
as well so what is there ways for
ethereum

7210
01:54:13,669 --> 01:54:13,679
ethereum
 

7211
01:54:13,679 --> 01:54:16,709
ethereum
and uh dogecoin to work together so

7212
01:54:16,709 --> 01:54:16,719
and uh dogecoin to work together so
 

7213
01:54:16,719 --> 01:54:20,310
and uh dogecoin to work together so
okay so there's a power behind a person

7214
01:54:20,310 --> 01:54:20,320
okay so there's a power behind a person
 

7215
01:54:20,320 --> 01:54:22,870
okay so there's a power behind a person
like elon musk pushing the development

7216
01:54:22,870 --> 01:54:22,880
like elon musk pushing the development
 

7217
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:25,510
like elon musk pushing the development
of a cryptocurrency

7218
01:54:25,510 --> 01:54:25,520
of a cryptocurrency
 

7219
01:54:25,520 --> 01:54:28,550
of a cryptocurrency
is there ways to leverage that power and

7220
01:54:28,550 --> 01:54:28,560
is there ways to leverage that power and
 

7221
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:29,910
is there ways to leverage that power and
that momentum

7222
01:54:29,910 --> 01:54:29,920
that momentum
 

7223
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:32,070
that momentum
to improve ethereum to improve some of

7224
01:54:32,070 --> 01:54:32,080
to improve ethereum to improve some of
 

7225
01:54:32,080 --> 01:54:32,950
to improve ethereum to improve some of
the

7226
01:54:32,950 --> 01:54:32,960
the
 

7227
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:36,149
the
sort of uh cryptocurrencies that are

7228
01:54:36,149 --> 01:54:36,159
sort of uh cryptocurrencies that are
 

7229
01:54:36,159 --> 01:54:38,070
sort of uh cryptocurrencies that are
already technologically advanced and

7230
01:54:38,070 --> 01:54:38,080
already technologically advanced and
 

7231
01:54:38,080 --> 01:54:41,270
already technologically advanced and
pushing forward that kind of technology

7232
01:54:41,270 --> 01:54:41,280
pushing forward that kind of technology
 

7233
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:44,310
pushing forward that kind of technology
i i definitely think there is room

7234
01:54:44,310 --> 01:54:44,320
i i definitely think there is room
 

7235
01:54:44,320 --> 01:54:46,870
i i definitely think there is room
for you know that uh there's that meme

7236
01:54:46,870 --> 01:54:46,880
for you know that uh there's that meme
 

7237
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:47,990
for you know that uh there's that meme
of doge like

7238
01:54:47,990 --> 01:54:48,000
of doge like
 

7239
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,390
of doge like
taking over that's the door i've seen it

7240
01:54:50,390 --> 01:54:50,400
taking over that's the door i've seen it
 

7241
01:54:50,400 --> 01:54:51,990
taking over that's the door i've seen it
is there a way to ride that

7242
01:54:51,990 --> 01:54:52,000
is there a way to ride that
 

7243
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:55,910
is there a way to ride that
uh that storm that wave of the doge

7244
01:54:55,910 --> 01:54:55,920
uh that storm that wave of the doge
 

7245
01:54:55,920 --> 01:54:58,070
uh that storm that wave of the doge
has taken over i think if we could have

7246
01:54:58,070 --> 01:54:58,080
has taken over i think if we could have
 

7247
01:54:58,080 --> 01:55:00,870
has taken over i think if we could have
a secure doshu ethereum bridge then

7248
01:55:00,870 --> 01:55:00,880
a secure doshu ethereum bridge then
 

7249
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:02,070
a secure doshu ethereum bridge then
you know that would be amazing and then

7250
01:55:02,070 --> 01:55:02,080
you know that would be amazing and then
 

7251
01:55:02,080 --> 01:55:04,310
you know that would be amazing and then
when ethereum gets its scalability

7252
01:55:04,310 --> 01:55:04,320
when ethereum gets its scalability
 

7253
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:06,629
when ethereum gets its scalability
any scalability thing that works for

7254
01:55:06,629 --> 01:55:06,639
any scalability thing that works for
 

7255
01:55:06,639 --> 01:55:08,149
any scalability thing that works for
ethereum assets you would be able to

7256
01:55:08,149 --> 01:55:08,159
ethereum assets you would be able to
 

7257
01:55:08,159 --> 01:55:08,870
ethereum assets you would be able to
also like

7258
01:55:08,870 --> 01:55:08,880
also like
 

7259
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:11,109
also like
trade wrapped doors with extremely low

7260
01:55:11,109 --> 01:55:11,119
trade wrapped doors with extremely low
 

7261
01:55:11,119 --> 01:55:12,709
trade wrapped doors with extremely low
transaction fees and very high speed as

7262
01:55:12,709 --> 01:55:12,719
transaction fees and very high speed as
 

7263
01:55:12,719 --> 01:55:13,189
transaction fees and very high speed as
well

7264
01:55:13,189 --> 01:55:13,199
well
 

7265
01:55:13,199 --> 01:55:15,189
well
is there uh is there precedence for

7266
01:55:15,189 --> 01:55:15,199
is there uh is there precedence for
 

7267
01:55:15,199 --> 01:55:16,870
is there uh is there precedence for
building secure bridges between

7268
01:55:16,870 --> 01:55:16,880
building secure bridges between
 

7269
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:18,390
building secure bridges between
cryptocurrencies

7270
01:55:18,390 --> 01:55:18,400
cryptocurrencies
 

7271
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:19,990
cryptocurrencies
is that i mean how difficult is this

7272
01:55:19,990 --> 01:55:20,000
is that i mean how difficult is this
 

7273
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:21,750
is that i mean how difficult is this
kind of task that's it's definitely

7274
01:55:21,750 --> 01:55:21,760
kind of task that's it's definitely
 

7275
01:55:21,760 --> 01:55:23,910
kind of task that's it's definitely
something that's in its infancy infancy

7276
01:55:23,910 --> 01:55:23,920
something that's in its infancy infancy
 

7277
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:25,270
something that's in its infancy infancy
there definitely have been some

7278
01:55:25,270 --> 01:55:25,280
there definitely have been some
 

7279
01:55:25,280 --> 01:55:26,870
there definitely have been some
cross-chain interaction things that have

7280
01:55:26,870 --> 01:55:26,880
cross-chain interaction things that have
 

7281
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:27,910
cross-chain interaction things that have
been done before

7282
01:55:27,910 --> 01:55:27,920
been done before
 

7283
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:29,750
been done before
um so one the earliest is probably the

7284
01:55:29,750 --> 01:55:29,760
um so one the earliest is probably the
 

7285
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:31,589
um so one the earliest is probably the
concept of merge mining right when

7286
01:55:31,589 --> 01:55:31,599
concept of merge mining right when
 

7287
01:55:31,599 --> 01:55:34,070
concept of merge mining right when
a chain just makes its entire

7288
01:55:34,070 --> 01:55:34,080
a chain just makes its entire
 

7289
01:55:34,080 --> 01:55:36,310
a chain just makes its entire
proof-of-work algorithm dependent on

7290
01:55:36,310 --> 01:55:36,320
proof-of-work algorithm dependent on
 

7291
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:37,910
proof-of-work algorithm dependent on
the proof-of-work algorithm of another

7292
01:55:37,910 --> 01:55:37,920
the proof-of-work algorithm of another
 

7293
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:39,589
the proof-of-work algorithm of another
chain and so i think

7294
01:55:39,589 --> 01:55:39,599
chain and so i think
 

7295
01:55:39,599 --> 01:55:41,750
chain and so i think
famous doshcoin actually merged mines

7296
01:55:41,750 --> 01:55:41,760
famous doshcoin actually merged mines
 

7297
01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:43,030
famous doshcoin actually merged mines
the litecoin which is

7298
01:55:43,030 --> 01:55:43,040
the litecoin which is
 

7299
01:55:43,040 --> 01:55:44,470
the litecoin which is
i think in retrospect it's not looking

7300
01:55:44,470 --> 01:55:44,480
i think in retrospect it's not looking
 

7301
01:55:44,480 --> 01:55:46,070
i think in retrospect it's not looking
like a very good choice because now

7302
01:55:46,070 --> 01:55:46,080
like a very good choice because now
 

7303
01:55:46,080 --> 01:55:48,950
like a very good choice because now
deutsche coin is bigger than litecoin um

7304
01:55:48,950 --> 01:55:48,960
deutsche coin is bigger than litecoin um
 

7305
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:49,750
deutsche coin is bigger than litecoin um
but

7306
01:55:49,750 --> 01:55:49,760
but
 

7307
01:55:49,760 --> 01:55:53,109
but
um you know if there's potentially some

7308
01:55:53,109 --> 01:55:53,119
um you know if there's potentially some
 

7309
01:55:53,119 --> 01:55:53,750
um you know if there's potentially some
way for

7310
01:55:53,750 --> 01:55:53,760
way for
 

7311
01:55:53,760 --> 01:55:57,350
way for
dogecoin to merge mine within ethereum

proof of stake ins of some kinds then

7314
01:55:59,350 --> 01:55:59,360
proof of stake ins of some kinds then
 

7315
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:00,629
proof of stake ins of some kinds then
like that could be an interesting

7316
01:56:00,629 --> 01:56:00,639
like that could be an interesting
 

7317
01:56:00,639 --> 01:56:02,790
like that could be an interesting
alternative um

7318
01:56:02,790 --> 01:56:02,800
alternative um
 

7319
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:05,669
alternative um
if so that's one type of like chain

7320
01:56:05,669 --> 01:56:05,679
if so that's one type of like chain
 

7321
01:56:05,679 --> 01:56:06,470
if so that's one type of like chain
interaction

7322
01:56:06,470 --> 01:56:06,480
interaction
 

7323
01:56:06,480 --> 01:56:08,229
interaction
as far as like bridges like one chain

7324
01:56:08,229 --> 01:56:08,239
as far as like bridges like one chain
 

7325
01:56:08,239 --> 01:56:09,510
as far as like bridges like one chain
reading another chain

7326
01:56:09,510 --> 01:56:09,520
reading another chain
 

7327
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:11,030
reading another chain
early in ethereum's history there was

7328
01:56:11,030 --> 01:56:11,040
early in ethereum's history there was
 

7329
01:56:11,040 --> 01:56:12,870
early in ethereum's history there was
this project called btc relay

7330
01:56:12,870 --> 01:56:12,880
this project called btc relay
 

7331
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:14,629
this project called btc relay
it's a smart contract on ethereum that

7332
01:56:14,629 --> 01:56:14,639
it's a smart contract on ethereum that
 

7333
01:56:14,639 --> 01:56:16,950
it's a smart contract on ethereum that
just verifies bitcoin blocks

7334
01:56:16,950 --> 01:56:16,960
just verifies bitcoin blocks
 

7335
01:56:16,960 --> 01:56:19,750
just verifies bitcoin blocks
i think people stopped really caring

7336
01:56:19,750 --> 01:56:19,760
i think people stopped really caring
 

7337
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:21,109
i think people stopped really caring
about and maintaining it because there

7338
01:56:21,109 --> 01:56:21,119
about and maintaining it because there
 

7339
01:56:21,119 --> 01:56:22,310
about and maintaining it because there
just weren't enough

7340
01:56:22,310 --> 01:56:22,320
just weren't enough
 

7341
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:24,229
just weren't enough
applications that were actually

7342
01:56:24,229 --> 01:56:24,239
applications that were actually
 

7343
01:56:24,239 --> 01:56:25,669
applications that were actually
interested in using it at the time and

7344
01:56:25,669 --> 01:56:25,679
interested in using it at the time and
 

7345
01:56:25,679 --> 01:56:27,589
interested in using it at the time and
the transaction fees got too high to

7346
01:56:27,589 --> 01:56:27,599
the transaction fees got too high to
 

7347
01:56:27,599 --> 01:56:29,030
the transaction fees got too high to
actually maintain it

7348
01:56:29,030 --> 01:56:29,040
actually maintain it
 

7349
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:32,070
actually maintain it
so i i think if we want to make a btc

7350
01:56:32,070 --> 01:56:32,080
so i i think if we want to make a btc
 

7351
01:56:32,080 --> 01:56:33,270
so i i think if we want to make a btc
relay 2.0

7352
01:56:33,270 --> 01:56:33,280
relay 2.0
 

7353
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:35,270
relay 2.0
and that becomes cheaper because you

7354
01:56:35,270 --> 01:56:35,280
and that becomes cheaper because you
 

7355
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:36,790
and that becomes cheaper because you
know it uses snarks or something like

7356
01:56:36,790 --> 01:56:36,800
know it uses snarks or something like
 

7357
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:38,229
know it uses snarks or something like
that then you probably could

7358
01:56:38,229 --> 01:56:38,239
that then you probably could
 

7359
01:56:38,239 --> 01:56:40,870
that then you probably could
but and maybe now is the time when you

7360
01:56:40,870 --> 01:56:40,880
but and maybe now is the time when you
 

7361
01:56:40,880 --> 01:56:41,510
but and maybe now is the time when you
actually

7362
01:56:41,510 --> 01:56:41,520
actually
 

7363
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:43,109
actually
like can do that sort of one-way

7364
01:56:43,109 --> 01:56:43,119
like can do that sort of one-way
 

7365
01:56:43,119 --> 01:56:45,270
like can do that sort of one-way
verification but the one challenge

7366
01:56:45,270 --> 01:56:45,280
verification but the one challenge
 

7367
01:56:45,280 --> 01:56:46,070
verification but the one challenge
though is that

7368
01:56:46,070 --> 01:56:46,080
though is that
 

7369
01:56:46,080 --> 01:56:48,149
though is that
if he wants to have a bridge that allows

7370
01:56:48,149 --> 01:56:48,159
if he wants to have a bridge that allows
 

7371
01:56:48,159 --> 01:56:49,830
if he wants to have a bridge that allows
you to move assets between chins

7372
01:56:49,830 --> 01:56:49,840
you to move assets between chins
 

7373
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:51,350
you to move assets between chins
then you don't just need one-way

7374
01:56:51,350 --> 01:56:51,360
then you don't just need one-way
 

7375
01:56:51,360 --> 01:56:52,550
then you don't just need one-way
verification you need two-way

7376
01:56:52,550 --> 01:56:52,560
verification you need two-way
 

7377
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:53,669
verification you need two-way
verification

7378
01:56:53,669 --> 01:56:53,679
verification
 

7379
01:56:53,679 --> 01:56:55,430
verification
right and ethereum can verify anything

7380
01:56:55,430 --> 01:56:55,440
right and ethereum can verify anything
 

7381
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:57,109
right and ethereum can verify anything
because ethereum smart contracts can

7382
01:56:57,109 --> 01:56:57,119
because ethereum smart contracts can
 

7383
01:56:57,119 --> 01:56:58,790
because ethereum smart contracts can
just run arbitrary code

7384
01:56:58,790 --> 01:56:58,800
just run arbitrary code
 

7385
01:56:58,800 --> 01:57:01,669
just run arbitrary code
but if you want bitcoin to be able to do

7386
01:57:01,669 --> 01:57:01,679
but if you want bitcoin to be able to do
 

7387
01:57:01,679 --> 01:57:03,510
but if you want bitcoin to be able to do
things based on what happens in ethereum

7388
01:57:03,510 --> 01:57:03,520
things based on what happens in ethereum
 

7389
01:57:03,520 --> 01:57:05,109
things based on what happens in ethereum
lands then like bitcoin would have to

7390
01:57:05,109 --> 01:57:05,119
lands then like bitcoin would have to
 

7391
01:57:05,119 --> 01:57:06,149
lands then like bitcoin would have to
basically

7392
01:57:06,149 --> 01:57:06,159
basically
 

7393
01:57:06,159 --> 01:57:07,430
basically
well they can do everything with soft

7394
01:57:07,430 --> 01:57:07,440
well they can do everything with soft
 

7395
01:57:07,440 --> 01:57:09,350
well they can do everything with soft
forks because like you know that that's

7396
01:57:09,350 --> 01:57:09,360
forks because like you know that that's
 

7397
01:57:09,360 --> 01:57:09,990
forks because like you know that that's
their religion

7398
01:57:09,990 --> 01:57:10,000
their religion
 

7399
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,470
their religion
but no they'll they'll do it that way

7400
01:57:12,470 --> 01:57:12,480
but no they'll they'll do it that way
 

7401
01:57:12,480 --> 01:57:14,390
but no they'll they'll do it that way
and if doge wants to

7402
01:57:14,390 --> 01:57:14,400
and if doge wants to
 

7403
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:17,270
and if doge wants to
make a fork where that allow allows for

7404
01:57:17,270 --> 01:57:17,280
make a fork where that allow allows for
 

7405
01:57:17,280 --> 01:57:17,830
make a fork where that allow allows for
like

7406
01:57:17,830 --> 01:57:17,840
like
 

7407
01:57:17,840 --> 01:57:20,310
like
two-way transferability with the

7408
01:57:20,310 --> 01:57:20,320
two-way transferability with the
 

7409
01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:21,510
two-way transferability with the
ethereum then you know

7410
01:57:21,510 --> 01:57:21,520
ethereum then you know
 

7411
01:57:21,520 --> 01:57:22,950
ethereum then you know
they could i mean i i think that would

7412
01:57:22,950 --> 01:57:22,960
they could i mean i i think that would
 

7413
01:57:22,960 --> 01:57:25,830
they could i mean i i think that would
be a lovely collaboration to make if

7414
01:57:25,830 --> 01:57:25,840
be a lovely collaboration to make if
 

7415
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:27,830
be a lovely collaboration to make if
there's interest i think there might

7416
01:57:27,830 --> 01:57:27,840
there's interest i think there might
 

7417
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:29,109
there's interest i think there might
actually even be

7418
01:57:29,109 --> 01:57:29,119
actually even be
 

7419
01:57:29,119 --> 01:57:32,390
actually even be
some multi-sig funds that have some um

7420
01:57:32,390 --> 01:57:32,400
some multi-sig funds that have some um
 

7421
01:57:32,400 --> 01:57:35,270
some multi-sig funds that have some um
some funding it's just a bounty for

7422
01:57:35,270 --> 01:57:35,280
some funding it's just a bounty for
 

7423
01:57:35,280 --> 01:57:37,270
some funding it's just a bounty for
someone to make a bridge between the two

7424
01:57:37,270 --> 01:57:37,280
someone to make a bridge between the two
 

7425
01:57:37,280 --> 01:57:39,669
someone to make a bridge between the two
yeah could you maybe try to

7426
01:57:39,669 --> 01:57:39,679
yeah could you maybe try to
 

7427
01:57:39,679 --> 01:57:41,510
yeah could you maybe try to
psychoanalyze elon musk for a brief

7428
01:57:41,510 --> 01:57:41,520
psychoanalyze elon musk for a brief
 

7429
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:42,629
psychoanalyze elon musk for a brief

so first with bitcoin and then with

7438
01:57:51,910 --> 01:57:51,920
so first with bitcoin and then with
 

7439
01:57:51,920 --> 01:57:53,109
so first with bitcoin and then with
doshcoin

so acquiring a large acquiring holding a

7442
01:57:55,830 --> 01:57:55,840
so acquiring a large acquiring holding a
 

7443
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:57,350
so acquiring a large acquiring holding a
large amount of bitcoin

7444

large amount of bitcoin
 

7445
01:57:57,360 --> 01:58:00,709
large amount of bitcoin
and i believe at least considering the

7446
01:58:00,709 --> 01:58:00,719
and i believe at least considering the
 

7447
01:58:00,719 --> 01:58:02,709
and i believe at least considering the
acquiring and holding a large amount of

7448
01:58:02,709 --> 01:58:02,719
acquiring and holding a large amount of
 

7449
01:58:02,719 --> 01:58:04,550
acquiring and holding a large amount of
doshcoin positives

7450
01:58:04,550 --> 01:58:04,560
doshcoin positives
 

7451
01:58:04,560 --> 01:58:06,470
doshcoin positives
negatives what do you think the future

7452
01:58:06,470 --> 01:58:06,480
negatives what do you think the future
 

7453
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:08,149
negatives what do you think the future
for tesla and spacex

7454

for tesla and spacex
 

7455
01:58:08,159 --> 01:58:09,990
for tesla and spacex
in the cryptocurrency space looks like

7456
01:58:09,990 --> 01:58:10,000
in the cryptocurrency space looks like
 

7457
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:11,910
in the cryptocurrency space looks like
do you think they'll consider ethereum

7458
01:58:11,910 --> 01:58:11,920
do you think they'll consider ethereum
 

7459
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:14,950
do you think they'll consider ethereum
um i'm i'm sure that if you know that

they stay in
 

7463
01:58:15,760 --> 01:58:17,910
they stay in
the the cryptocurrency ecosystem at all

7464
01:58:17,910 --> 01:58:17,920
the the cryptocurrency ecosystem at all
 

7465
01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:21,910
the the cryptocurrency ecosystem at all
then they have to at some point

7466
01:58:21,910 --> 01:58:21,920

 

7467
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:25,109

yeah you know bitcoin number one

7468
01:58:25,109 --> 01:58:25,119
yeah you know bitcoin number one
 

7469
01:58:25,119 --> 01:58:28,070
yeah you know bitcoin number one
dogecoin number i mean you know come on

7470
01:58:28,070 --> 01:58:28,080
dogecoin number i mean you know come on
 

7471
01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:29,350
dogecoin number i mean you know come on
it deserves to be number three

7472
01:58:29,350 --> 01:58:29,360
it deserves to be number three
 

7473
01:58:29,360 --> 01:58:31,830
it deserves to be number three
and then or number two and then ethereum

7474
01:58:31,830 --> 01:58:31,840
and then or number two and then ethereum
 

7475
01:58:31,840 --> 01:58:33,109
and then or number two and then ethereum
can be whatever that uh

7476
01:58:33,109 --> 01:58:33,119
can be whatever that uh
 

7477
01:58:33,119 --> 01:58:37,510
can be whatever that uh
whatever that other number is um but um

7478
01:58:37,510 --> 01:58:37,520
whatever that other number is um but um
 

7479
01:58:37,520 --> 01:58:41,669
whatever that other number is um but um
the if ethereum only becomes a dot

7480
01:58:41,669 --> 01:58:41,679
the if ethereum only becomes a dot
 

7481
01:58:41,679 --> 01:58:44,149
the if ethereum only becomes a dot
coin somehow maybe change the logo to

uh sneaking behind oh that would be that
 

7491
01:58:51,199 --> 01:58:52,709
uh sneaking behind oh that would be that
would be fascinating before the emerge

any intel like deep intentionality to
the whole process

7508
01:59:07,189 --> 01:59:07,199
the whole process
 

7509
01:59:07,199 --> 01:59:09,350
the whole process
i think like he's just a human being and

7510
01:59:09,350 --> 01:59:09,360
i think like he's just a human being and
 

7511

he likes dogs just like i like dogs yeah
right

7514
01:59:11,669 --> 01:59:11,679
right
 

7515
01:59:11,679 --> 01:59:13,589
right
that is i think that is literally the

7516
01:59:13,589 --> 01:59:13,599
that is i think that is literally the
 

7517
01:59:13,599 --> 01:59:15,350
that is i think that is literally the
reasoning behind the whole dose dogecoin

right like you could you could ask like

7528
01:59:25,750 --> 01:59:25,760
right like you could you could ask like
 

7529
01:59:25,760 --> 01:59:27,430
right like you could you could ask like
what is the purpose of that

7530
01:59:27,430 --> 01:59:27,440
what is the purpose of that
 

7531
01:59:27,440 --> 01:59:30,790
what is the purpose of that
i think the purpose of that is uh fun

7532
01:59:30,790 --> 01:59:30,800
i think the purpose of that is uh fun
 

7533
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:33,270
i think the purpose of that is uh fun
there i think he truly is more and more

7534
01:59:33,270 --> 01:59:33,280
there i think he truly is more and more
 

7535
01:59:33,280 --> 01:59:34,229
there i think he truly is more and more
especially

7536
01:59:34,229 --> 01:59:34,239
especially
 

7537
01:59:34,239 --> 01:59:36,790
especially
lately embodying the whole idea that the

7538
01:59:36,790 --> 01:59:36,800
lately embodying the whole idea that the
 

7539
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:37,990
lately embodying the whole idea that the
most

7540
01:59:37,990 --> 01:59:38,000
most
 

7541
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:39,910
most
the most entertaining outcome is the

7542
01:59:39,910 --> 01:59:39,920
the most entertaining outcome is the
 

7543

most entertaining outcome
 

7547
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,149
most entertaining outcome
and in many ways dogecoin is the most

7548
01:59:46,149 --> 01:59:46,159
and in many ways dogecoin is the most
 

7549
01:59:46,159 --> 01:59:48,149
and in many ways dogecoin is the most
entertaining cryptocurrency

7550
01:59:48,149 --> 01:59:48,159
entertaining cryptocurrency
 

7551
01:59:48,159 --> 01:59:50,229
entertaining cryptocurrency
as cryptocurrency becomes more and more

7552
01:59:50,229 --> 01:59:50,239
as cryptocurrency becomes more and more
 

7553
01:59:50,239 --> 01:59:51,830
as cryptocurrency becomes more and more
impactful in the world

7554

people are getting more and more serious

7556
01:59:53,350 --> 01:59:53,360
people are getting more and more serious
 

7557
01:59:53,360 --> 01:59:55,030
people are getting more and more serious
about it and so he's selecting the

7558
01:59:55,030 --> 01:59:55,040
about it and so he's selecting the
 

7559
01:59:55,040 --> 01:59:56,950
about it and so he's selecting the
cryptocurrency that is the most the

7560
01:59:56,950 --> 01:59:56,960
cryptocurrency that is the most the
 

7561
01:59:56,960 --> 01:59:59,189
cryptocurrency that is the most the
least serious and the most fun

7562
01:59:59,189 --> 01:59:59,199
least serious and the most fun
 

7563
01:59:59,199 --> 02:00:01,669
least serious and the most fun
and there's something to that uh like

7564
02:00:01,669 --> 02:00:01,679
and there's something to that uh like
 

7565
02:00:01,679 --> 02:00:02,390
and there's something to that uh like
coupling

7566
02:00:02,390 --> 02:00:02,400
coupling
 

7567
02:00:02,400 --> 02:00:06,070
coupling
fun with uh technological sophistication

7568
02:00:06,070 --> 02:00:06,080
fun with uh technological sophistication
 

7569
02:00:06,080 --> 02:00:08,310
fun with uh technological sophistication
um and somehow figuring out a way to do

7570
02:00:08,310 --> 02:00:08,320
um and somehow figuring out a way to do
 

7571
02:00:08,320 --> 02:00:10,310
um and somehow figuring out a way to do
that absolutely you do that well you

7572
02:00:10,310 --> 02:00:10,320
that absolutely you do that well you
 

7573
02:00:10,320 --> 02:00:10,629
that absolutely you do that well you
know i

7574
02:00:10,629 --> 02:00:10,639
know i
 

7575
02:00:10,639 --> 02:00:12,629

i i want the world to be fun i think the
 

7577
02:00:12,639 --> 02:00:15,830
i i want the world to be fun i think the
world being fun is great

7578
02:00:15,830 --> 02:00:15,840

 

7579
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:18,070

okay let me ask about a couple other

7580
02:00:18,070 --> 02:00:18,080
okay let me ask about a couple other
 

7581
02:00:18,080 --> 02:00:19,669
okay let me ask about a couple other
technologies if it's okay

7582
02:00:19,669 --> 02:00:19,679
technologies if it's okay
 

7583
02:00:19,679 --> 02:00:21,910
technologies if it's okay
sure what are your thoughts about chain

7584
02:00:21,910 --> 02:00:21,920
sure what are your thoughts about chain
 

7585
02:00:21,920 --> 02:00:24,229
sure what are your thoughts about chain
link and hybrid smart contracts that

7586
02:00:24,229 --> 02:00:24,239
link and hybrid smart contracts that
 

7587
02:00:24,239 --> 02:00:28,470
link and hybrid smart contracts that
utilize off-chain external data sources

7588
02:00:28,470 --> 02:00:28,480
utilize off-chain external data sources
 

7589
02:00:28,480 --> 02:00:31,350
utilize off-chain external data sources
and i think it's definitely necessary

7590
02:00:31,350 --> 02:00:31,360
and i think it's definitely necessary
 

7591
02:00:31,360 --> 02:00:33,189
and i think it's definitely necessary
for smart contracts so that

7592
02:00:33,189 --> 02:00:33,199
for smart contracts so that
 

7593
02:00:33,199 --> 02:00:35,510
for smart contracts so that
you do a lot of things to use off chain

7594
02:00:35,510 --> 02:00:35,520
you do a lot of things to use off chain
 

7595
02:00:35,520 --> 02:00:37,109
you do a lot of things to use off chain
data of some kind right like

7596
02:00:37,109 --> 02:00:37,119
data of some kind right like
 

7597
02:00:37,119 --> 02:00:38,550
data of some kind right like
if you want to have a stable coin you

7598
02:00:38,550 --> 02:00:38,560
if you want to have a stable coin you
 

7599
02:00:38,560 --> 02:00:39,910
if you want to have a stable coin you
need a price oracle so you know what

7600
02:00:39,910 --> 02:00:39,920
need a price oracle so you know what
 

7601
02:00:39,920 --> 02:00:41,109
need a price oracle so you know what
price you're targeting

7602
02:00:41,109 --> 02:00:41,119
price you're targeting
 

7603
02:00:41,119 --> 02:00:43,750
price you're targeting
um if he wants to have some fancy you

7604
02:00:43,750 --> 02:00:43,760
um if he wants to have some fancy you
 

7605
02:00:43,760 --> 02:00:46,149
um if he wants to have some fancy you
know crop insurance gadget like i always

7606
02:00:46,149 --> 02:00:46,159
know crop insurance gadget like i always
 

7607
02:00:46,159 --> 02:00:46,550
know crop insurance gadget like i always
you know

7608
02:00:46,550 --> 02:00:46,560
you know
 

7609
02:00:46,560 --> 02:00:48,070
you know
i think ether risk has been doing a lot

7610
02:00:48,070 --> 02:00:48,080
i think ether risk has been doing a lot
 

7611
02:00:48,080 --> 02:00:50,149
i think ether risk has been doing a lot
of uh good work with that in

7612
02:00:50,149 --> 02:00:50,159
of uh good work with that in
 

7613
02:00:50,159 --> 02:00:52,709
of uh good work with that in
i think it was either kenya or sri lanka

7614
02:00:52,709 --> 02:00:52,719
i think it was either kenya or sri lanka
 

7615
02:00:52,719 --> 02:00:54,390
i think it was either kenya or sri lanka
or both like they're they're making a

7616
02:00:54,390 --> 02:00:54,400
or both like they're they're making a
 

7617
02:00:54,400 --> 02:00:55,990
or both like they're they're making a
lot of

7618
02:00:55,990 --> 02:00:56,000
lot of
 

7619
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,149
lot of
good progress and some in some of those

7620
02:00:58,149 --> 02:00:58,159
good progress and some in some of those
 

7621
02:00:58,159 --> 02:00:59,109
good progress and some in some of those
places

7622
02:00:59,109 --> 02:00:59,119
places
 

7623
02:00:59,119 --> 02:01:00,790
places
like you need some kind of oracle to

7624
02:01:00,790 --> 02:01:00,800
like you need some kind of oracle to
 

7625
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:02,790
like you need some kind of oracle to
tell you you know did it actually rain

7626
02:01:02,790 --> 02:01:02,800
tell you you know did it actually rain
 

7627
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:04,229
tell you you know did it actually rain
in this particular area

7628
02:01:04,229 --> 02:01:04,239
in this particular area
 

7629
02:01:04,239 --> 02:01:06,790
in this particular area
um if he wants to have like assets that

7630
02:01:06,790 --> 02:01:06,800
um if he wants to have like assets that
 

7631
02:01:06,800 --> 02:01:08,470
um if he wants to have like assets that
mirror other financial assets you need

7632
02:01:08,470 --> 02:01:08,480
mirror other financial assets you need
 

7633
02:01:08,480 --> 02:01:09,189
mirror other financial assets you need
an oracle

7634
02:01:09,189 --> 02:01:09,199
an oracle
 

7635
02:01:09,199 --> 02:01:10,470
an oracle
if you want to have a prediction market

7636
02:01:10,470 --> 02:01:10,480
if you want to have a prediction market
 

7637
02:01:10,480 --> 02:01:12,709
if you want to have a prediction market
you need an oracle and

7638
02:01:12,709 --> 02:01:12,719
you need an oracle and
 

7639
02:01:12,719 --> 02:01:15,750
you need an oracle and
so projects that provide oracles are

7640
02:01:15,750 --> 02:01:15,760
so projects that provide oracles are
 

7641
02:01:15,760 --> 02:01:18,310
so projects that provide oracles are
definitely really important and there

7642
02:01:18,310 --> 02:01:18,320
definitely really important and there
 

7643
02:01:18,320 --> 02:01:19,830
definitely really important and there
are definitely different kinds of use

7644
02:01:19,830 --> 02:01:19,840
are definitely different kinds of use
 

7645
02:01:19,840 --> 02:01:21,750
are definitely different kinds of use
cases like augur is more about you know

7646
02:01:21,750 --> 02:01:21,760
cases like augur is more about you know
 

7647
02:01:21,760 --> 02:01:22,310
cases like augur is more about you know
events

7648
02:01:22,310 --> 02:01:22,320
events
 

7649
02:01:22,320 --> 02:01:24,550
events
and the auger oracle is designed like i

7650
02:01:24,550 --> 02:01:24,560
and the auger oracle is designed like i
 

7651
02:01:24,560 --> 02:01:25,990
and the auger oracle is designed like i
think differently from chain link right

7652
02:01:25,990 --> 02:01:26,000
think differently from chain link right
 

7653
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:27,109
think differently from chain link right
like chain link

7654
02:01:27,109 --> 02:01:27,119
like chain link
 

7655
02:01:27,119 --> 02:01:29,189
like chain link
emphasizes the whole you know like we

7656
02:01:29,189 --> 02:01:29,199
emphasizes the whole you know like we
 

7657
02:01:29,199 --> 02:01:31,189
emphasizes the whole you know like we
have a fast automated

7658
02:01:31,189 --> 02:01:31,199
have a fast automated
 

7659
02:01:31,199 --> 02:01:32,550
have a fast automated
thing that just like gives you data

7660
02:01:32,550 --> 02:01:32,560
thing that just like gives you data
 

7661
02:01:32,560 --> 02:01:34,870
thing that just like gives you data
quickly um whereas auger

7662
02:01:34,870 --> 02:01:34,880
quickly um whereas auger
 

7663
02:01:34,880 --> 02:01:36,310
quickly um whereas auger
is more you know we don't give a crap

7664
02:01:36,310 --> 02:01:36,320
is more you know we don't give a crap
 

7665
02:01:36,320 --> 02:01:37,990
is more you know we don't give a crap
about speed um

7666
02:01:37,990 --> 02:01:38,000
about speed um
 

7667
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:39,350
about speed um
and look we don't need to give a crap

7668
02:01:39,350 --> 02:01:39,360
and look we don't need to give a crap
 

7669
02:01:39,360 --> 02:01:40,629
and look we don't need to give a crap
about speed because if you want to get

7670
02:01:40,629 --> 02:01:40,639
about speed because if you want to get
 

7671
02:01:40,639 --> 02:01:42,229
about speed because if you want to get
your money out on a prediction market

7672
02:01:42,229 --> 02:01:42,239
your money out on a prediction market
 

7673
02:01:42,239 --> 02:01:42,950
your money out on a prediction market
that where

7674
02:01:42,950 --> 02:01:42,960
that where
 

7675
02:01:42,960 --> 02:01:44,390
that where
in reality it's resolved you can

7676
02:01:44,390 --> 02:01:44,400
in reality it's resolved you can
 

7677
02:01:44,400 --> 02:01:46,070
in reality it's resolved you can
probably just sell your coins for 99

7678
02:01:46,070 --> 02:01:46,080
probably just sell your coins for 99
 

7679
02:01:46,080 --> 02:01:47,189
probably just sell your coins for 99
cents anyway

7680
02:01:47,189 --> 02:01:47,199
cents anyway
 

7681
02:01:47,199 --> 02:01:50,629
cents anyway
um so i mean i i think i mean the chain

7682
02:01:50,629 --> 02:01:50,639
um so i mean i i think i mean the chain
 

7683
02:01:50,639 --> 02:01:52,310
um so i mean i i think i mean the chain
link is definitely like

7684
02:01:52,310 --> 02:01:52,320
link is definitely like
 

7685
02:01:52,320 --> 02:01:55,910
link is definitely like
taking a yeah good and the important

7686
02:01:55,910 --> 02:01:55,920
taking a yeah good and the important
 

7687
02:01:55,920 --> 02:01:58,790
taking a yeah good and the important
part of the oracle design space and i'm

7688
02:01:58,790 --> 02:01:58,800
part of the oracle design space and i'm
 

7689
02:01:58,800 --> 02:02:00,790
part of the oracle design space and i'm
definitely happy that there is like

7690
02:02:00,790 --> 02:02:00,800
definitely happy that there is like
 

7691
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:02,950
definitely happy that there is like
that project taking the task on and at

7692
02:02:02,950 --> 02:02:02,960
that project taking the task on and at
 

7693
02:02:02,960 --> 02:02:03,990
that project taking the task on and at
the same time i do think

7694
02:02:03,990 --> 02:02:04,000
the same time i do think
 

7695
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:05,589
the same time i do think
that you know their their frog army on

7696
02:02:05,589 --> 02:02:05,599
that you know their their frog army on
 

7697
02:02:05,599 --> 02:02:07,030
that you know their their frog army on
twitter can get a bit intense sometimes

7698
02:02:07,030 --> 02:02:07,040
twitter can get a bit intense sometimes
 

7699
02:02:07,040 --> 02:02:07,830
twitter can get a bit intense sometimes
but like frog

7700
02:02:07,830 --> 02:02:07,840
but like frog
 

7701
02:02:07,840 --> 02:02:09,990
but like frog
army is there is there a way to

7702
02:02:09,990 --> 02:02:10,000
army is there is there a way to
 

7703
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:11,669
army is there is there a way to
incorporate sort of oracle network type

7704
02:02:11,669 --> 02:02:11,679
incorporate sort of oracle network type
 

7705
02:02:11,679 --> 02:02:12,229
incorporate sort of oracle network type
of

7706
02:02:12,229 --> 02:02:12,239
of
 

7707
02:02:12,239 --> 02:02:15,910
of
ideas into ethereum i personally

7708
02:02:15,910 --> 02:02:15,920
ideas into ethereum i personally
 

7709
02:02:15,920 --> 02:02:17,830
ideas into ethereum i personally
would prefer the ethereum base layer

7710
02:02:17,830 --> 02:02:17,840
would prefer the ethereum base layer
 

7711
02:02:17,840 --> 02:02:19,270
would prefer the ethereum base layer
like

7712
02:02:19,270 --> 02:02:19,280
like
 

7713
02:02:19,280 --> 02:02:20,950
like
stay away from trying to provide too

7714
02:02:20,950 --> 02:02:20,960
stay away from trying to provide too
 

7715
02:02:20,960 --> 02:02:22,550
stay away from trying to provide too
much functionality because

7716
02:02:22,550 --> 02:02:22,560
much functionality because
 

7717
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:25,350
much functionality because
i think once you have the ethereum base

7718
02:02:25,350 --> 02:02:25,360
i think once you have the ethereum base
 

7719
02:02:25,360 --> 02:02:25,910
i think once you have the ethereum base
layer

7720
02:02:25,910 --> 02:02:25,920
layer
 

7721
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:29,109
layer
making a claim about like say the us

7722
02:02:29,109 --> 02:02:29,119
making a claim about like say the us
 

7723
02:02:29,119 --> 02:02:32,470
making a claim about like say the us
dollar to ethereum price like and

7724
02:02:32,470 --> 02:02:32,480
dollar to ethereum price like and
 

7725
02:02:32,480 --> 02:02:33,990
dollar to ethereum price like and
at some sense you're basically saying

7726
02:02:33,990 --> 02:02:34,000
at some sense you're basically saying
 

7727
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:35,589
at some sense you're basically saying
that like ethereum as a

7728
02:02:35,589 --> 02:02:35,599
that like ethereum as a
 

7729
02:02:35,599 --> 02:02:38,629
that like ethereum as a
base platform starts making what could

7730
02:02:38,629 --> 02:02:38,639
base platform starts making what could
 

7731
02:02:38,639 --> 02:02:39,990
base platform starts making what could
be geopolitical statements

7732
02:02:39,990 --> 02:02:40,000
be geopolitical statements
 

7733
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:41,750
be geopolitical statements
right right like for example you know

7734
02:02:41,750 --> 02:02:41,760
right right like for example you know
 

7735
02:02:41,760 --> 02:02:43,270
right right like for example you know
imagine if there was some

7736
02:02:43,270 --> 02:02:43,280
imagine if there was some
 

7737
02:02:43,280 --> 02:02:45,270
imagine if there was some
you know civil war in the us split up

7738
02:02:45,270 --> 02:02:45,280
you know civil war in the us split up
 

7739
02:02:45,280 --> 02:02:46,629
you know civil war in the us split up
and you had two currencies that both

7740
02:02:46,629 --> 02:02:46,639
and you had two currencies that both
 

7741
02:02:46,639 --> 02:02:48,149
and you had two currencies that both
claims to be the us dollar well

7742
02:02:48,149 --> 02:02:48,159
claims to be the us dollar well
 

7743
02:02:48,159 --> 02:02:50,229
claims to be the us dollar well
you know ethereum would would have to

7744
02:02:50,229 --> 02:02:50,239
you know ethereum would would have to
 

7745
02:02:50,239 --> 02:02:51,910
you know ethereum would would have to
pick one for the sake of everyone who's

7746
02:02:51,910 --> 02:02:51,920
pick one for the sake of everyone who's
 

7747
02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:53,589
pick one for the sake of everyone who's
already using that oracle so you know

7748
02:02:53,589 --> 02:02:53,599
already using that oracle so you know
 

7749
02:02:53,599 --> 02:02:55,030
already using that oracle so you know
does that mean that the blockchain would

7750
02:02:55,030 --> 02:02:55,040
does that mean that the blockchain would
 

7751
02:02:55,040 --> 02:02:55,589
does that mean that the blockchain would
be

7752

kind of interested
how the 2030 and 2040 vitalik and

7840
02:04:32,390 --> 02:04:32,400
how the 2030 and 2040 vitalik and
 

7841
02:04:32,400 --> 02:04:33,830
how the 2030 and 2040 vitalik and
charles look like as well

charles look like as well
 

7843
02:04:33,840 --> 02:04:36,229
charles look like as well
oh interesting like the progression of

02:04:36,229 --> 02:04:36,239
oh interesting like the progression of
 

7845
02:04:36,239 --> 02:04:37,270
oh interesting like the progression of
the humans

7846
02:04:37,270 --> 02:04:37,280
the humans
 

7847
02:04:37,280 --> 02:04:39,030
the humans
is this going to be one of those things

7848

where like everyone comes full circle
 

7851
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:42,390
where like everyone comes full circle
and then 2030 vitalik and charles are

7852
02:04:42,390 --> 02:04:42,400
and then 2030 vitalik and charles are
 

7853
02:04:42,400 --> 02:04:43,109
and then 2030 vitalik and charles are
best friends

7854
02:04:43,109 --> 02:04:43,119
best friends
 

7855
02:04:43,119 --> 02:04:45,510
best friends
yeah i mean not necessarily best friends

7856
02:04:45,510 --> 02:04:45,520
yeah i mean not necessarily best friends
 

7857
02:04:45,520 --> 02:04:46,790
yeah i mean not necessarily best friends
but some kind of

7858
02:04:46,790 --> 02:04:46,800
but some kind of
 

7859
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:51,189
but some kind of
uh um are able to reminisce in ways that

7860
02:04:51,189 --> 02:04:51,199
uh um are able to reminisce in ways that
 

7861
02:04:51,199 --> 02:04:52,629
uh um are able to reminisce in ways that
is um

7862
02:04:52,629 --> 02:04:52,639
is um
 

7863
02:04:52,639 --> 02:04:54,310
is um
that puts some of the tension of the

7864
02:04:54,310 --> 02:04:54,320
that puts some of the tension of the
 

7865
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:55,990
that puts some of the tension of the
past behind i think

7866
02:04:55,990 --> 02:04:56,000
past behind i think
 

7867
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:59,270
past behind i think
such things are possible um i think

7868
02:04:59,270 --> 02:04:59,280
such things are possible um i think
 

7869
02:04:59,280 --> 02:05:01,830
such things are possible um i think
you know people definitely absolutely

7870

02:05:51,669 --> 02:05:51,679
ethereum tends to be more okay with
 

7921
02:05:51,679 --> 02:05:53,589
ethereum tends to be more okay with
heuristic arguments and in part because

7922
02:05:53,589 --> 02:05:53,599
heuristic arguments and in part because
 

7923
02:05:53,599 --> 02:05:55,510
heuristic arguments and in part because
it's just trying to do more faster

7924
02:05:55,510 --> 02:05:55,520
it's just trying to do more faster
 

7925
02:05:55,520 --> 02:05:58,790
it's just trying to do more faster
um but you know there's definitely very

um but you know there's definitely very
 

7927
02:05:58,800 --> 02:06:00,550
um but you know there's definitely very
interesting things that come out of

and like deep academic rigor is there

7940
02:06:15,109 --> 02:06:15,119
and like deep academic rigor is there
 

7941
02:06:15,119 --> 02:06:16,149
and like deep academic rigor is there
what's the role

7942
02:06:16,149 --> 02:06:16,159
what's the role
 

7943
02:06:16,159 --> 02:06:19,270
what's the role
of deep research rigor in the world of

7944
02:06:19,270 --> 02:06:19,280
of deep research rigor in the world of
 

7945
02:06:19,280 --> 02:06:20,470
of deep research rigor in the world of
cryptocurrency

person who thinks deep rigor is

7950
02:06:23,030 --> 02:06:23,040
person who thinks deep rigor is
 

7951
02:06:23,040 --> 02:06:24,629
person who thinks deep rigor is
overrated

7952
02:06:24,629 --> 02:06:24,639
overrated
 

7953
02:06:24,639 --> 02:06:26,629
overrated
um the reason why i think deep rigor is

7954
02:06:26,629 --> 02:06:26,639
um the reason why i think deep rigor is
 

7955
02:06:26,639 --> 02:06:28,950
um the reason why i think deep rigor is
overrated is because i think like

7956
02:06:28,950 --> 02:06:28,960
overrated is because i think like
 

7957
02:06:28,960 --> 02:06:32,229
overrated is because i think like
the the in terms of like why protocols

7958
02:06:32,229 --> 02:06:32,239
the the in terms of like why protocols
 

7959
02:06:32,239 --> 02:06:32,709
the the in terms of like why protocols
fail

7960
02:06:32,709 --> 02:06:32,719
fail
 

7961
02:06:32,719 --> 02:06:35,750
fail
i think the number of failures or that

7962
02:06:35,750 --> 02:06:35,760
i think the number of failures or that
 

7963
02:06:35,760 --> 02:06:37,430
i think the number of failures or that
are outside the model is even more

7964
02:06:37,430 --> 02:06:37,440
are outside the model is even more
 

7965
02:06:37,440 --> 02:06:37,910
are outside the model is even more
important

7966
02:06:37,910 --> 02:06:37,920
important
 

7967
02:06:37,920 --> 02:06:39,270
important
is like bigger and more important than

7968
02:06:39,270 --> 02:06:39,280
is like bigger and more important than
 

7969
02:06:39,280 --> 02:06:41,350
is like bigger and more important than
the failures that are inside the model

7970
02:06:41,350 --> 02:06:41,360
the failures that are inside the model
 

7971
02:06:41,360 --> 02:06:43,109
the failures that are inside the model
right so if you take selfish mining for

7972
02:06:43,109 --> 02:06:43,119
right so if you take selfish mining for
 

7973
02:06:43,119 --> 02:06:44,390
right so if you take selfish mining for
example like the

7974
02:06:44,390 --> 02:06:44,400
example like the
 

7975
02:06:44,400 --> 02:06:47,350
example like the
the that original discovery from 2013

7976
02:06:47,350 --> 02:06:47,360
the that original discovery from 2013
 

7977
02:06:47,360 --> 02:06:49,669
the that original discovery from 2013
that showed how

7978
02:06:49,669 --> 02:06:49,679
that showed how
 

7979
02:06:49,679 --> 02:06:52,790
that showed how
um bitcoin does

7980
02:06:52,790 --> 02:06:52,800
um bitcoin does
 

7981
02:06:52,800 --> 02:06:55,510
um bitcoin does
like even if it has a 50 uh fault

7982
02:06:55,510 --> 02:06:55,520
like even if it has a 50 uh fault
 

7983
02:06:55,520 --> 02:06:57,270
like even if it has a 50 uh fault
tolerance assuming everyone's honest it

7984
02:06:57,270 --> 02:06:57,280
tolerance assuming everyone's honest it
 

7985
02:06:57,280 --> 02:06:57,990
tolerance assuming everyone's honest it
only has a

7986
02:06:57,990 --> 02:06:58,000
only has a
 

7987
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,629
only has a
yeah you know zero to 33 percent fault

7988
02:07:00,629 --> 02:07:00,639
yeah you know zero to 33 percent fault
 

7989
02:07:00,639 --> 02:07:02,069
yeah you know zero to 33 percent fault
tolerance depending on your network

7990
02:07:02,069 --> 02:07:02,079
tolerance depending on your network
 

7991
02:07:02,079 --> 02:07:02,709

model

7992
02:07:02,709 --> 02:07:02,719
model
 

7993
02:07:02,719 --> 02:07:05,910
model
if you assume uh rational actors and

7994
02:07:05,910 --> 02:07:05,920
if you assume uh rational actors and
 

7995
02:07:05,920 --> 02:07:07,910
if you assume uh rational actors and
like to me that wasn't that was a great

7996
02:07:07,910 --> 02:07:07,920
like to me that wasn't that was a great
 

7997
02:07:07,920 --> 02:07:09,510
like to me that wasn't that was a great
example of like an outside the model

7998
02:07:09,510 --> 02:07:09,520
example of like an outside the model
 

7999
02:07:09,520 --> 02:07:10,709
example of like an outside the model
failure right because

8000
02:07:10,709 --> 02:07:10,719
failure right because
 

8001
02:07:10,719 --> 02:07:13,030
failure right because
traditional consensus research just up

8002
02:07:13,030 --> 02:07:13,040
traditional consensus research just up
 

8003
02:07:13,040 --> 02:07:13,750
traditional consensus research just up
until

8004
02:07:13,750 --> 02:07:13,760
until
 

8005
02:07:13,760 --> 02:07:16,310
until
or before the blockchain days did not

8006
02:07:16,310 --> 02:07:16,320
or before the blockchain days did not
 

8007
02:07:16,320 --> 02:07:16,950
or before the blockchain days did not
think about

8008
02:07:16,950 --> 02:07:16,960
think about
 

8009
02:07:16,960 --> 02:07:19,270
think about
like incentivization much right like

8010
02:07:19,270 --> 02:07:19,280
like incentivization much right like
 

8011
02:07:19,280 --> 02:07:20,709
like incentivization much right like
there was a little bit of thought about

8012
02:07:20,709 --> 02:07:20,719
there was a little bit of thought about
 

8013
02:07:20,719 --> 02:07:22,390
there was a little bit of thought about
incentivization there's like

8014
02:07:22,390 --> 02:07:22,400
incentivization there's like
 

8015
02:07:22,400 --> 02:07:23,910
incentivization there's like
a couple of papers on the byzantine

8016
02:07:23,910 --> 02:07:23,920
a couple of papers on the byzantine
 

8017
02:07:23,920 --> 02:07:25,589
a couple of papers on the byzantine
altruist rational model but

8018
02:07:25,589 --> 02:07:25,599
altruist rational model but
 

8019
02:07:25,599 --> 02:07:27,430
altruist rational model but
it wasn't that deep it was mostly

8020
02:07:27,430 --> 02:07:27,440
it wasn't that deep it was mostly
 

8021
02:07:27,440 --> 02:07:29,350
it wasn't that deep it was mostly
operating under the assumption that

8022
02:07:29,350 --> 02:07:29,360
operating under the assumption that
 

8023
02:07:29,360 --> 02:07:30,709
operating under the assumption that
you know this we're going to make

8024
02:07:30,709 --> 02:07:30,719
you know this we're going to make
 

8025
02:07:30,719 --> 02:07:32,950
you know this we're going to make
consensus between 15 participants and

8026
02:07:32,950 --> 02:07:32,960
consensus between 15 participants and
 

8027
02:07:32,960 --> 02:07:34,550
consensus between 15 participants and
these are institutions

8028
02:07:34,550 --> 02:07:34,560
these are institutions
 

8029
02:07:34,560 --> 02:07:36,470
these are institutions
and if something goes wrong then you

8030
02:07:36,470 --> 02:07:36,480
and if something goes wrong then you
 

8031
02:07:36,480 --> 02:07:38,149
and if something goes wrong then you
know if it was we can figure out

8032
02:07:38,149 --> 02:07:38,159
know if it was we can figure out
 

8033
02:07:38,159 --> 02:07:39,830
know if it was we can figure out
whether or not it was deliberate offline

8034
02:07:39,830 --> 02:07:39,840
whether or not it was deliberate offline
 

8035
02:07:39,840 --> 02:07:41,030
whether or not it was deliberate offline
and if they did something evil we

8036
02:07:41,030 --> 02:07:41,040
and if they did something evil we
 

8037
02:07:41,040 --> 02:07:41,910
and if they did something evil we
consume them

8038
02:07:41,910 --> 02:07:41,920
consume them
 

8039
02:07:41,920 --> 02:07:43,669
consume them
whereas in the crypto world you can't do

8040
02:07:43,669 --> 02:07:43,679
whereas in the crypto world you can't do
 

8041
02:07:43,679 --> 02:07:45,350
whereas in the crypto world you can't do
that right and so

8042
02:07:45,350 --> 02:07:45,360
that right and so
 

8043
02:07:45,360 --> 02:07:47,270
that right and so
like that whole discovery basically

8044
02:07:47,270 --> 02:07:47,280
like that whole discovery basically
 

8045
02:07:47,280 --> 02:07:48,709
like that whole discovery basically
arose just because

8046
02:07:48,709 --> 02:07:48,719
arose just because
 

8047
02:07:48,719 --> 02:07:50,709
arose just because
like you know the model of uh

8048
02:07:50,709 --> 02:07:50,719
like you know the model of uh
 

8049
02:07:50,719 --> 02:07:52,950
like you know the model of uh
traditional uh consensus research just

8050
02:07:52,950 --> 02:07:52,960
traditional uh consensus research just
 

8051
02:07:52,960 --> 02:07:54,709
traditional uh consensus research just
like didn't cover those possibilities

8052
02:07:54,709 --> 02:07:54,719
like didn't cover those possibilities
 

8053
02:07:54,719 --> 02:07:55,270
like didn't cover those possibilities
and then

8054
02:07:55,270 --> 02:07:55,280
and then
 

8055
02:07:55,280 --> 02:07:57,030
and then
like once you go out of the model those

8056
02:07:57,030 --> 02:07:57,040
like once you go out of the model those
 

8057
02:07:57,040 --> 02:07:58,310
like once you go out of the model those
other issues do exist

8058
02:07:58,310 --> 02:07:58,320
other issues do exist
 

8059
02:07:58,320 --> 02:08:01,109
other issues do exist
right um so but then at the same time

8060
02:08:01,109 --> 02:08:01,119
right um so but then at the same time
 

8061
02:08:01,119 --> 02:08:01,430
right um so but then at the same time
like

8062
02:08:01,430 --> 02:08:01,440
like
 

8063
02:08:01,440 --> 02:08:03,910
like
there definitely are um protocols that

8064
02:08:03,910 --> 02:08:03,920
there definitely are um protocols that
 

8065
02:08:03,920 --> 02:08:05,030
there definitely are um protocols that
turn out to be

8066
02:08:05,030 --> 02:08:05,040
turn out to be
 

8067
02:08:05,040 --> 02:08:07,589
turn out to be
insecu that do have failures inside the

8068
02:08:07,589 --> 02:08:07,599
insecu that do have failures inside the
 

8069
02:08:07,599 --> 02:08:09,430
insecu that do have failures inside the
model like this reminds me of at the

8070
02:08:09,430 --> 02:08:09,440
model like this reminds me of at the
 

8071
02:08:09,440 --> 02:08:10,390
model like this reminds me of at the
time when

8072
02:08:10,390 --> 02:08:10,400
time when
 

8073
02:08:10,400 --> 02:08:14,550
time when
i think i found a bug in a proposed uh

8074
02:08:14,550 --> 02:08:14,560
i think i found a bug in a proposed uh
 

8075
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:16,790
i think i found a bug in a proposed uh
consensus implementation from either

8076
02:08:16,790 --> 02:08:16,800
consensus implementation from either
 

8077
02:08:16,800 --> 02:08:18,069
consensus implementation from either
bitshares or eos

8078
02:08:18,069 --> 02:08:18,079
bitshares or eos
 

8079
02:08:18,079 --> 02:08:21,109
bitshares or eos
this happened around the end of 2017. um

8080
02:08:21,109 --> 02:08:21,119
this happened around the end of 2017. um
 

8081
02:08:21,119 --> 02:08:23,350
this happened around the end of 2017. um
so that was definitely inside the model

8082
02:08:23,350 --> 02:08:23,360
so that was definitely inside the model
 

8083
02:08:23,360 --> 02:08:24,310
so that was definitely inside the model
because like they had

8084
02:08:24,310 --> 02:08:24,320
because like they had
 

8085
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:25,669
because like they had
a very clear idea of what they were

8086
02:08:25,669 --> 02:08:25,679
a very clear idea of what they were
 

8087
02:08:25,679 --> 02:08:27,030
a very clear idea of what they were
trying to achieve they had a very clear

8088
02:08:27,030 --> 02:08:27,040
trying to achieve they had a very clear
 

8089
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:27,830
trying to achieve they had a very clear

8091
02:08:27,840 --> 02:08:29,270

and like there's a very clear

8092
02:08:29,270 --> 02:08:29,280
and like there's a very clear
 

8093
02:08:29,280 --> 02:08:31,030
and like there's a very clear
mathematical um argument for why the

mathematical um argument for why the
 

8095
02:08:31,040 --> 02:08:32,229
mathematical um argument for why the
description doesn't lead to what they're

8096
02:08:32,229 --> 02:08:32,239
description doesn't lead to what they're
 

8097
02:08:32,239 --> 02:08:34,069
description doesn't lead to what they're
trying to achieve but ultimately

8098
02:08:34,069 --> 02:08:34,079
trying to achieve but ultimately
 

8099
02:08:34,079 --> 02:08:35,669
trying to achieve but ultimately
what you're trying to achieve can never

8100
02:08:35,669 --> 02:08:35,679
what you're trying to achieve can never
 

8101
02:08:35,679 --> 02:08:37,589
what you're trying to achieve can never
be fully like described in formal

8102
02:08:37,589 --> 02:08:37,599
be fully like described in formal
 

8103
02:08:37,599 --> 02:08:38,550
be fully like described in formal
language right like

8104
02:08:38,550 --> 02:08:38,560
language right like
 

8105
02:08:38,560 --> 02:08:41,189
language right like
i think this is the big discovery of you

8106
02:08:41,189 --> 02:08:41,199
i think this is the big discovery of you
 

8107
02:08:41,199 --> 02:08:43,109
i think this is the big discovery of you
know the ai safety people for example

8108
02:08:43,109 --> 02:08:43,119
know the ai safety people for example
 

8109
02:08:43,119 --> 02:08:43,910
know the ai safety people for example
right like

8110
02:08:43,910 --> 02:08:43,920
right like
 

8111
02:08:43,920 --> 02:08:47,350
right like
just having a a specification of what

8112
02:08:47,350 --> 02:08:47,360
just having a a specification of what
 

8113
02:08:47,360 --> 02:08:49,669
just having a a specification of what
you want is an insanely hard problem

8114
02:08:49,669 --> 02:08:49,679
you want is an insanely hard problem
 

8115
02:08:49,679 --> 02:08:52,629
you want is an insanely hard problem
and like the more powerful the optimizer

8116
02:08:52,629 --> 02:08:52,639
and like the more powerful the optimizer
 

8117
02:08:52,639 --> 02:08:54,069
and like the more powerful the optimizer
that you're giving the instructions to

8118
02:08:54,069 --> 02:08:54,079
that you're giving the instructions to
 

8119
02:08:54,079 --> 02:08:55,750
that you're giving the instructions to
the more you have to be careful

8120
02:08:55,750 --> 02:08:55,760
the more you have to be careful
 

8121
02:08:55,760 --> 02:08:59,270
the more you have to be careful
and and so you know i think

8122
02:08:59,270 --> 02:08:59,280
and and so you know i think
 

8123
02:08:59,280 --> 02:09:02,550
and and so you know i think
there are kind of these two sides

8124
02:09:02,550 --> 02:09:02,560
there are kind of these two sides
 

8125
02:09:02,560 --> 02:09:05,669
there are kind of these two sides
and then the other thing is that

8126
02:09:05,669 --> 02:09:05,679
and then the other thing is that
 

8127
02:09:05,679 --> 02:09:07,510
and then the other thing is that
a lot like a lot of the academic

8128
02:09:07,510 --> 02:09:07,520
a lot like a lot of the academic
 

8129
02:09:07,520 --> 02:09:08,790
a lot like a lot of the academic
approach ends up

8130
02:09:08,790 --> 02:09:08,800
approach ends up
 

8131
02:09:08,800 --> 02:09:10,709
approach ends up
like basically optimizing for other

8132
02:09:10,709 --> 02:09:10,719
like basically optimizing for other
 

8133
02:09:10,719 --> 02:09:12,950
like basically optimizing for other
people inside of the academic system

8134
02:09:12,950 --> 02:09:12,960
people inside of the academic system
 

8135
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:16,470
people inside of the academic system
and it doesn't really optimize for like

8136
02:09:16,470 --> 02:09:16,480
and it doesn't really optimize for like
 

8137
02:09:16,480 --> 02:09:18,310
and it doesn't really optimize for like
curious outsiders whereas like i

8138
02:09:18,310 --> 02:09:18,320
curious outsiders whereas like i
 

8139
02:09:18,320 --> 02:09:19,830
curious outsiders whereas like i
personally met like totally optimized

8140
02:09:19,830 --> 02:09:19,840
personally met like totally optimized
 

8141
02:09:19,840 --> 02:09:21,750
personally met like totally optimized
for curious outsiders or at least i feel

8142
02:09:21,750 --> 02:09:21,760
for curious outsiders or at least i feel
 

8143
02:09:21,760 --> 02:09:23,030
for curious outsiders or at least i feel
like i strive to

8144
02:09:23,030 --> 02:09:23,040
like i strive to
 

8145
02:09:23,040 --> 02:09:27,109
like i strive to
so i guess like that's my case for why

8146
02:09:27,109 --> 02:09:27,119
so i guess like that's my case for why
 

8147
02:09:27,119 --> 02:09:30,950
so i guess like that's my case for why
i like tends to behave in ways that you

8148
02:09:30,950 --> 02:09:30,960
i like tends to behave in ways that you
 

8149
02:09:30,960 --> 02:09:31,350
i like tends to behave in ways that you
know

8150
02:09:31,350 --> 02:09:31,360
know
 

8151
02:09:31,360 --> 02:09:33,270
know
occasionally traditional academic types

8152
02:09:33,270 --> 02:09:33,280
occasionally traditional academic types
 

8153
02:09:33,280 --> 02:09:35,109
occasionally traditional academic types
criticize as being reckless um

8154
02:09:35,109 --> 02:09:35,119
criticize as being reckless um
 

8155
02:09:35,119 --> 02:09:37,510
criticize as being reckless um
but i you know on the other hand you

8156
02:09:37,510 --> 02:09:37,520
but i you know on the other hand you
 

8157
02:09:37,520 --> 02:09:38,149
but i you know on the other hand you
know there's

8158
02:09:38,149 --> 02:09:38,159
know there's
 

8159
02:09:38,159 --> 02:09:40,470
know there's
i mean there's definitely real benefits

8160
02:09:40,470 --> 02:09:40,480
i mean there's definitely real benefits
 

8161
02:09:40,480 --> 02:09:41,589
i mean there's definitely real benefits
that come from

8162
02:09:41,589 --> 02:09:41,599
that come from
 

8163
02:09:41,599 --> 02:09:44,790
that come from
like just taking us

8164
02:09:44,790 --> 02:09:44,800
like just taking us
 

8165
02:09:44,800 --> 02:09:47,510
like just taking us
a rigorous approach especially when you

8166
02:09:47,510 --> 02:09:47,520
a rigorous approach especially when you
 

8167
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:48,950
a rigorous approach especially when you
know you know what the thing that

8168
02:09:48,950 --> 02:09:48,960
know you know what the thing that
 

8169
02:09:48,960 --> 02:09:50,950
know you know what the thing that
ex like you know what the specification

8170
02:09:50,950 --> 02:09:50,960
ex like you know what the specification
 

8171
02:09:50,960 --> 02:09:52,950
ex like you know what the specification
is of what you're trying to get

8172
02:09:52,950 --> 02:09:52,960
is of what you're trying to get
 

8173
02:09:52,960 --> 02:09:55,030
is of what you're trying to get
and like you're trying to kind of

8174
02:09:55,030 --> 02:09:55,040
and like you're trying to kind of
 

8175
02:09:55,040 --> 02:09:56,310
and like you're trying to kind of
improve your way

8176
02:09:56,310 --> 02:09:56,320
improve your way
 

8177
02:09:56,320 --> 02:09:57,990
improve your way
or provide protocols that actually

8178
02:09:57,990 --> 02:09:58,000
or provide protocols that actually
 

8179
02:09:58,000 --> 02:09:59,750
or provide protocols that actually
provide that like you know exactly what

8180
02:09:59,750 --> 02:09:59,760
provide that like you know exactly what
 

8181
02:09:59,760 --> 02:09:59,990
provide that like you know exactly what
you're

02:09:59,990 --> 02:10:00,000
you're
 

8183
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,870
you're
looking for i feel like realistically

8184
02:10:02,870 --> 02:10:02,880
looking for i feel like realistically
 

8185
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:04,870
looking for i feel like realistically
you probably wants to do both kinds of

8186
02:10:04,870 --> 02:10:04,880
you probably wants to do both kinds of
 

8187
02:10:04,880 --> 02:10:05,910
you probably wants to do both kinds of
analysis

8188
02:10:05,910 --> 02:10:05,920
analysis
 

8189
02:10:05,920 --> 02:10:07,350
analysis
and like sometimes even want to do both

8190
02:10:07,350 --> 02:10:07,360
and like sometimes even want to do both
 

8191
02:10:07,360 --> 02:10:09,109
and like sometimes even want to do both
kinds of analysis and stages right like

8192
02:10:09,109 --> 02:10:09,119
kinds of analysis and stages right like
 

8193
02:10:09,119 --> 02:10:09,750
kinds of analysis and stages right like
you have

8194
02:10:09,750 --> 02:10:09,760
you have
 

8195
02:10:09,760 --> 02:10:11,350
you have
you want to do more quick and dirty

8196
02:10:11,350 --> 02:10:11,360
you want to do more quick and dirty
 

8197
02:10:11,360 --> 02:10:13,109
you want to do more quick and dirty
things and even want public feedback on

8198
02:10:13,109 --> 02:10:13,119
things and even want public feedback on
 

8199
02:10:13,119 --> 02:10:14,069
things and even want public feedback on
the quick and dirty stuff

8200
02:10:14,069 --> 02:10:14,079
the quick and dirty stuff
 

8201
02:10:14,079 --> 02:10:16,069
the quick and dirty stuff
and then later on you formalize it more

8202
02:10:16,069 --> 02:10:16,079
and then later on you formalize it more
 

8203
02:10:16,079 --> 02:10:17,430
and then later on you formalize it more
and then you get more feedback

8204
02:10:17,430 --> 02:10:17,440
and then you get more feedback
 

8205
02:10:17,440 --> 02:10:20,709
and then you get more feedback
um like in general i guess i feel like

8206
02:10:20,709 --> 02:10:20,719
um like in general i guess i feel like
 

8207
02:10:20,719 --> 02:10:23,830
um like in general i guess i feel like
the norms of research in

8208
02:10:23,830 --> 02:10:23,840
the norms of research in
 

8209
02:10:23,840 --> 02:10:26,790
the norms of research in
the future like the internet has just

8210
02:10:26,790 --> 02:10:26,800
the future like the internet has just
 

8211
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:28,470
the future like the internet has just
changed so much there's no way that it's

8212
02:10:28,470 --> 02:10:28,480
changed so much there's no way that it's
 

8213
02:10:28,480 --> 02:10:29,109
changed so much there's no way that it's
not going

8214
02:10:29,109 --> 02:10:29,119
not going
 

8215
02:10:29,119 --> 02:10:31,189
not going
and you know it's it's even changed like

8216
02:10:31,189 --> 02:10:31,199
and you know it's it's even changed like
 

8217
02:10:31,199 --> 02:10:33,109
and you know it's it's even changed like
collaboration structures and like the

8218
02:10:33,109 --> 02:10:33,119
collaboration structures and like the
 

8219
02:10:33,119 --> 02:10:34,629
collaboration structures and like the
patterns in which we work with each

8220
02:10:34,629 --> 02:10:34,639
patterns in which we work with each
 

8221
02:10:34,639 --> 02:10:35,350
patterns in which we work with each
other

8222
02:10:35,350 --> 02:10:35,360
other
 

8223
02:10:35,360 --> 02:10:37,589
other
there's no way that the correct

8224
02:10:37,589 --> 02:10:37,599
there's no way that the correct
 

8225
02:10:37,599 --> 02:10:38,709
there's no way that the correct
structure for

8226
02:10:38,709 --> 02:10:38,719
structure for
 

8227
02:10:38,719 --> 02:10:40,550
structure for
club collaborative research is the same

8228
02:10:40,550 --> 02:10:40,560
club collaborative research is the same
 

8229
02:10:40,560 --> 02:10:41,990
club collaborative research is the same
as what it was 15 years ago

8230
02:10:41,990 --> 02:10:42,000
as what it was 15 years ago
 

8231
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:45,189
as what it was 15 years ago
but like what combination of these

8232
02:10:45,189 --> 02:10:45,199
but like what combination of these
 

8233
02:10:45,199 --> 02:10:47,510
but like what combination of these
existing components and of new ideas it

8234
02:10:47,510 --> 02:10:47,520
existing components and of new ideas it
 

8235
02:10:47,520 --> 02:10:49,430
existing components and of new ideas it
is like that's something that's you know

8236
02:10:49,430 --> 02:10:49,440
is like that's something that's you know
 

8237
02:10:49,440 --> 02:10:51,990
is like that's something that's you know
totally legitimate to kind of fight it

8238
02:10:51,990 --> 02:10:52,000
totally legitimate to kind of fight it
 

8239
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:52,950
totally legitimate to kind of fight it
out and i think it's

8240
02:10:52,950 --> 02:10:52,960
out and i think it's
 

8241
02:10:52,960 --> 02:10:54,629
out and i think it's
great that there's different ecosystems

8242
02:10:54,629 --> 02:10:54,639
great that there's different ecosystems
 

8243
02:10:54,639 --> 02:10:55,910
great that there's different ecosystems

that have different attitudes to things
like you know i think

8246
02:10:56,870 --> 02:10:56,880
like you know i think
 

8247
02:10:56,880 --> 02:10:58,870
like you know i think
you know there's a big possibility that

8248
02:10:58,870 --> 02:10:58,880
you know there's a big possibility that
 

8249
02:10:58,880 --> 02:11:01,030
you know there's a big possibility that
you know things that the ethereum

8250
02:11:01,030 --> 02:11:01,040
you know things that the ethereum
 

8251
02:11:01,040 --> 02:11:02,149
you know things that the ethereum
ways that the ethereum ecosystem

8252
02:11:02,149 --> 02:11:02,159
ways that the ethereum ecosystem
 

8253
02:11:02,159 --> 02:11:03,589
ways that the ethereum ecosystem
approaches some problems is totally

02:11:03,589 --> 02:11:03,599
approaches some problems is totally
 

8255
02:11:03,599 --> 02:11:05,350
approaches some problems is totally
wrong and if there's other ecosystems or

8256
02:11:05,350 --> 02:11:05,360
wrong and if there's other ecosystems or
 

8257
02:11:05,360 --> 02:11:07,030
wrong and if there's other ecosystems or
different principles and they can

different principles and they can
 

8259
02:11:07,040 --> 02:11:08,229
different principles and they can
do well that's something that we can

8260
02:11:08,229 --> 02:11:08,239
do well that's something that we can
 

8261
02:11:08,239 --> 02:11:10,629
do well that's something that we can

can you comment on ai safety and some

02:11:14,239 --> 02:11:15,430
can you comment on ai safety and some
people are really worried about the

people are really worried about the

is there something you could say that's

02:11:20,950 --> 02:11:20,960
is there something you could say that's
 

8275
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:21,589
is there something you could say that's
uh

8276
02:11:21,589 --> 02:11:21,599

02:11:27,589 --> 02:11:27,599
kind of line of uh reasoning about
 

8281
02:11:27,599 --> 02:11:29,669
kind of line of uh reasoning about
creating formal models versus kind of

02:11:31,350 --> 02:11:31,360
looking outside the model into
 

8285
02:11:31,360 --> 02:11:33,430
looking outside the model into
what the real world actually is like is

8286
02:11:33,430 --> 02:11:33,440
what the real world actually is like is
 

8287
02:11:33,440 --> 02:11:36,470
what the real world actually is like is
there some lessons from that we can take

8288
02:11:36,470 --> 02:11:36,480
there some lessons from that we can take
 

8289
02:11:36,480 --> 02:11:39,589
there some lessons from that we can take
and map onto the ai safety world where

8290
02:11:39,589 --> 02:11:39,599
and map onto the ai safety world where
 

8291
02:11:39,599 --> 02:11:41,750
and map onto the ai safety world where
the potentials of the technology whether

the potentials of the technology whether
it's in autonomous

02:11:43,270 --> 02:11:43,280
it's in autonomous
 

8295
02:11:43,280 --> 02:11:46,470
it's in autonomous
uh weapon systems or just the paperclip

8296
02:11:46,470 --> 02:11:46,480
uh weapon systems or just the paperclip
 

8297
02:11:46,480 --> 02:11:47,350
uh weapon systems or just the paperclip
problem

8298
02:11:47,350 --> 02:11:47,360
problem
 

8299
02:11:47,360 --> 02:11:50,069
problem
uh that we can avoid ai destroying the

8300
02:11:50,069 --> 02:11:50,079
uh that we can avoid ai destroying the
 

8301
02:11:50,079 --> 02:11:51,750
uh that we can avoid ai destroying the
world

8302
02:11:51,750 --> 02:11:51,760
world
 

8303
02:11:51,760 --> 02:11:54,310
world
so my impression is actually that like

8304
02:11:54,310 --> 02:11:54,320
so my impression is actually that like
 

8305
02:11:54,320 --> 02:11:54,790
so my impression is actually that like
this is

8306
02:11:54,790 --> 02:11:54,800
this is
 

8307
02:11:54,800 --> 02:11:56,870
this is
more of a kind of faraway impression and

8308
02:11:56,870 --> 02:11:56,880
more of a kind of faraway impression and
 

8309
02:11:56,880 --> 02:11:58,390
more of a kind of faraway impression and
it could be wrong that it might even be

8310
02:11:58,390 --> 02:11:58,400
it could be wrong that it might even be
 

8311
02:11:58,400 --> 02:11:59,990
it could be wrong that it might even be
that one of the challenges that ai is

8312
02:11:59,990 --> 02:12:00,000
that one of the challenges that ai is
 

8313
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:01,350
that one of the challenges that ai is
not formal enough

8314
02:12:01,350 --> 02:12:01,360
not formal enough
 

8315
02:12:01,360 --> 02:12:04,310
not formal enough
like because ai does is very like

8316
02:12:04,310 --> 02:12:04,320
like because ai does is very like
 

8317
02:12:04,320 --> 02:12:06,149
like because ai does is very like
practitioner oriented right like it's

8318
02:12:06,149 --> 02:12:06,159
practitioner oriented right like it's
 

8319
02:12:06,159 --> 02:12:07,270
practitioner oriented right like it's
all about like hey

8320
02:12:07,270 --> 02:12:07,280
all about like hey
 

8321
02:12:07,280 --> 02:12:09,109
all about like hey
i found a couple of hacks and look i ran

8322
02:12:09,109 --> 02:12:09,119
i found a couple of hacks and look i ran
 

8323
02:12:09,119 --> 02:12:10,550
i found a couple of hacks and look i ran
them and look you know they seem to

8324
02:12:10,550 --> 02:12:10,560
them and look you know they seem to
 

8325
02:12:10,560 --> 02:12:12,390
them and look you know they seem to
improve classification accuracy from you

8326
02:12:12,390 --> 02:12:12,400
improve classification accuracy from you
 

8327
02:12:12,400 --> 02:12:15,350
improve classification accuracy from you
know 0.684 to 0.773

8328
02:12:15,350 --> 02:12:15,360
know 0.684 to 0.773
 

8329
02:12:15,360 --> 02:12:18,069
know 0.684 to 0.773
uh so a lot of the time like there just

8330
02:12:18,069 --> 02:12:18,079
uh so a lot of the time like there just
 

8331
02:12:18,079 --> 02:12:18,629
uh so a lot of the time like there just
isn't

8332
02:12:18,629 --> 02:12:18,639
isn't
 

8333
02:12:18,639 --> 02:12:20,790
isn't
actual science behind like why this hack

8334
02:12:20,790 --> 02:12:20,800
actual science behind like why this hack
 

8335
02:12:20,800 --> 02:12:22,629
actual science behind like why this hack
works and why this uh

8336
02:12:22,629 --> 02:12:22,639
works and why this uh
 

8337
02:12:22,639 --> 02:12:24,069
works and why this uh
other hack doesn't work you just sort of

8338
02:12:24,069 --> 02:12:24,079
other hack doesn't work you just sort of
 

8339
02:12:24,079 --> 02:12:26,069
other hack doesn't work you just sort of
like trial and error your way into it

8340
02:12:26,069 --> 02:12:26,079
like trial and error your way into it
 

8341
02:12:26,079 --> 02:12:29,669
like trial and error your way into it
um but and i could see how that approach

8342
02:12:29,669 --> 02:12:29,679
um but and i could see how that approach
 

8343
02:12:29,679 --> 02:12:31,350
um but and i could see how that approach
works but at the same time like that

8344
02:12:31,350 --> 02:12:31,360
works but at the same time like that
 

8345
02:12:31,360 --> 02:12:32,229
works but at the same time like that
approach is

8346
02:12:32,229 --> 02:12:32,239
approach is
 

8347
02:12:32,239 --> 02:12:34,790
approach is
not good for legibility for example it's

8348
02:12:34,790 --> 02:12:34,800
not good for legibility for example it's
 

8349
02:12:34,800 --> 02:12:36,310
not good for legibility for example it's
not good for like understanding what the

8350
02:12:36,310 --> 02:12:36,320
not good for like understanding what the
 

8351
02:12:36,320 --> 02:12:37,750
not good for like understanding what the
heck is actually going on

8352
02:12:37,750 --> 02:12:37,760
heck is actually going on
 

8353
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:40,229
heck is actually going on
like how these kinds of systems

8354
02:12:40,229 --> 02:12:40,239
like how these kinds of systems
 

8355
02:12:40,239 --> 02:12:41,910
like how these kinds of systems
conceivably might fail

8356
02:12:41,910 --> 02:12:41,920
conceivably might fail
 

8357
02:12:41,920 --> 02:12:45,270
conceivably might fail
like there's even you know a debate on

8358
02:12:45,270 --> 02:12:45,280
like there's even you know a debate on
 

8359
02:12:45,280 --> 02:12:48,229
like there's even you know a debate on
like can you take gpt3 like things and

8360
02:12:48,229 --> 02:12:48,239
like can you take gpt3 like things and
 

8361
02:12:48,239 --> 02:12:49,270
like can you take gpt3 like things and
just scale them up and

8362
02:12:49,270 --> 02:12:49,280
just scale them up and
 

8363
02:12:49,280 --> 02:12:50,550
just scale them up and
their intelligence will continue to

8364
02:12:50,550 --> 02:12:50,560
their intelligence will continue to
 

8365
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:52,310
their intelligence will continue to
improve or is there just like

8366
02:12:52,310 --> 02:12:52,320
improve or is there just like
 

8367
02:12:52,320 --> 02:12:53,830
improve or is there just like
some types of reasoning that they're

8368
02:12:53,830 --> 02:12:53,840
some types of reasoning that they're
 

8369
02:12:53,840 --> 02:12:55,510
some types of reasoning that they're
fundamentally bad at and like

8370
02:12:55,510 --> 02:12:55,520
fundamentally bad at and like
 

8371
02:12:55,520 --> 02:12:57,430
fundamentally bad at and like
yeah they're not gonna get good at it no

8372
02:12:57,430 --> 02:12:57,440
yeah they're not gonna get good at it no
 

8373
02:12:57,440 --> 02:12:58,790
yeah they're not gonna get good at it no
matter how much you like scale this

8374
02:12:58,790 --> 02:12:58,800
matter how much you like scale this
 

8375
02:12:58,800 --> 02:12:59,990
matter how much you like scale this
exact same approach and add more

8376
02:12:59,990 --> 02:13:00,000
exact same approach and add more
 

8377
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:01,189
exact same approach and add more
hardware to it

8378
02:13:01,189 --> 02:13:01,199
hardware to it
 

8379
02:13:01,199 --> 02:13:04,790
hardware to it
so having like

8380
02:13:04,790 --> 02:13:04,800
so having like
 

8381
02:13:04,800 --> 02:13:06,550
so having like
thinking about what's going on more

8382
02:13:06,550 --> 02:13:06,560
thinking about what's going on more
 

8383
02:13:06,560 --> 02:13:08,149
thinking about what's going on more
explicitly i mean my understanding is

8384
02:13:08,149 --> 02:13:08,159
explicitly i mean my understanding is
 

8385
02:13:08,159 --> 02:13:09,109
explicitly i mean my understanding is
that a big part of

8386
02:13:09,109 --> 02:13:09,119
that a big part of
 

8387
02:13:09,119 --> 02:13:11,990
that a big part of
a ai safety research is trying to do

8388
02:13:11,990 --> 02:13:12,000
a ai safety research is trying to do
 

8389
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:12,870
a ai safety research is trying to do
that sort of stuff

8390
02:13:12,870 --> 02:13:12,880
that sort of stuff
 

8391
02:13:12,880 --> 02:13:15,990
that sort of stuff
right and formalize yeah formalize

8392
02:13:15,990 --> 02:13:16,000
right and formalize yeah formalize
 

8393
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:19,030
right and formalize yeah formalize
try to improve just ai legibility

8394
02:13:19,030 --> 02:13:19,040
try to improve just ai legibility
 

8395
02:13:19,040 --> 02:13:21,109
try to improve just ai legibility
like trying to understand you know if

8396
02:13:21,109 --> 02:13:21,119
like trying to understand you know if
 

8397
02:13:21,119 --> 02:13:23,109
like trying to understand you know if
the ai makes some classification so we

8398
02:13:23,109 --> 02:13:23,119
the ai makes some classification so we
 

8399
02:13:23,119 --> 02:13:24,390
the ai makes some classification so we
can actually see

8400
02:13:24,390 --> 02:13:24,400
can actually see
 

8401
02:13:24,400 --> 02:13:26,470
can actually see
like what happens and what's going on in

8402
02:13:26,470 --> 02:13:26,480
like what happens and what's going on in
 

8403
02:13:26,480 --> 02:13:27,589
like what happens and what's going on in
the middle right

8404
02:13:27,589 --> 02:13:27,599
the middle right

you know it's like very much not well

8410
02:13:33,510 --> 02:13:33,520
you know it's like very much not well
 

8411
02:13:33,520 --> 02:13:34,229
you know it's like very much not well
okay i mean

8412
02:13:34,229 --> 02:13:34,239
okay i mean
 

8413
02:13:34,239 --> 02:13:35,669
okay i mean
i shouldn't quite say that it's

8414
02:13:35,669 --> 02:13:35,679
i shouldn't quite say that it's
 

8415
02:13:35,679 --> 02:13:37,030
i shouldn't quite say that it's
traditional cryptography is this

8416
02:13:37,030 --> 02:13:37,040
traditional cryptography is this
 

8417
02:13:37,040 --> 02:13:39,030
traditional cryptography is this
interesting mix of being very formal and

8418
02:13:39,030 --> 02:13:39,040
interesting mix of being very formal and
 

8419
02:13:39,040 --> 02:13:40,149
interesting mix of being very formal and
being very informal

8420
02:13:40,149 --> 02:13:40,159
being very informal
 

8421
02:13:40,159 --> 02:13:43,350
being very informal
because it's very formal with given

8422
02:13:43,350 --> 02:13:43,360
because it's very formal with given
 

8423
02:13:43,360 --> 02:13:45,030
because it's very formal with given
these security assumptions prove that

these security assumptions prove that
the protocol works under these security

the places where it's very informal is
 

8431
02:13:49,119 --> 02:13:50,870
the places where it's very informal is
like well how do we even know that there

8432
02:13:50,870 --> 02:13:50,880
like well how do we even know that there
 

8433
02:13:50,880 --> 02:13:52,229
like well how do we even know that there
isn't an efficient algorithm for

02:13:52,239 --> 02:13:53,350
isn't an efficient algorithm for
factoring numbers

8436
02:13:53,350 --> 02:13:53,360
factoring numbers
 

8437
02:13:53,360 --> 02:13:55,830
factoring numbers
yeah we kind of tried it for 40 years

8438
02:13:55,830 --> 02:13:55,840
yeah we kind of tried it for 40 years
 

8439
02:13:55,840 --> 02:13:56,470
yeah we kind of tried it for 40 years
and then

8440
02:13:56,470 --> 02:13:56,480
and then
 

8441
02:13:56,480 --> 02:13:58,229
and then
you know so far no one's found anything

8442
02:13:58,229 --> 02:13:58,239
you know so far no one's found anything
 

8443
02:13:58,239 --> 02:14:00,229
you know so far no one's found anything
better than the gen general number field

8444
02:14:00,229 --> 02:14:00,239
better than the gen general number field
 

8445
02:14:00,239 --> 02:14:01,990
better than the gen general number field
sieve and like okay fine we'll just

8446
02:14:01,990 --> 02:14:02,000
sieve and like okay fine we'll just
 

8447
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:03,109
sieve and like okay fine we'll just
assume it's fine

8448
02:14:03,109 --> 02:14:03,119
assume it's fine
 

8449
02:14:03,119 --> 02:14:04,950
assume it's fine
you know how do we know you can't i'm

8450
02:14:04,950 --> 02:14:04,960
you know how do we know you can't i'm
 

8451
02:14:04,960 --> 02:14:06,950
you know how do we know you can't i'm
gonna find uh the the discrete log

8452
02:14:06,950 --> 02:14:06,960
gonna find uh the the discrete log
 

8453
02:14:06,960 --> 02:14:08,950
gonna find uh the the discrete log
between two elliptic curve points like

8454
02:14:08,950 --> 02:14:08,960
between two elliptic curve points like
 

8455
02:14:08,960 --> 02:14:11,270
between two elliptic curve points like
no did it a couple of decades no one's

8456
02:14:11,270 --> 02:14:11,280
no did it a couple of decades no one's
 

8457
02:14:11,280 --> 02:14:12,790
no did it a couple of decades no one's
found anything

8458
02:14:12,790 --> 02:14:12,800
found anything
 

8459
02:14:12,800 --> 02:14:14,709
found anything
faster than like baby step giant step

8460
02:14:14,709 --> 02:14:14,719
faster than like baby step giant step
 

8461
02:14:14,719 --> 02:14:17,270
faster than like baby step giant step
stuff uh so

8462
02:14:17,270 --> 02:14:17,280
stuff uh so
 

8463
02:14:17,280 --> 02:14:20,629
stuff uh so
that's and like

8464
02:14:20,629 --> 02:14:20,639
that's and like
 

8465
02:14:20,639 --> 02:14:23,669
that's and like
there's there's a there's definitely uh

8466
02:14:23,669 --> 02:14:23,679
there's there's a there's definitely uh
 

8467
02:14:23,679 --> 02:14:25,350
there's there's a there's definitely uh
ways in which that approach really makes

8468
02:14:25,350 --> 02:14:25,360
ways in which that approach really makes
 

8469
02:14:25,360 --> 02:14:27,270
ways in which that approach really makes
sense right because at least you can

8470
02:14:27,270 --> 02:14:27,280
sense right because at least you can
 

8471
02:14:27,280 --> 02:14:28,709
sense right because at least you can
concentrate your analysis

8472
02:14:28,709 --> 02:14:28,719
concentrate your analysis
 

8473
02:14:28,719 --> 02:14:31,030
concentrate your analysis
on a small number of building blocks and

8474
02:14:31,030 --> 02:14:31,040
on a small number of building blocks and
 

8475
02:14:31,040 --> 02:14:32,550
on a small number of building blocks and
like you know you do have some intuitive

8476
02:14:32,550 --> 02:14:32,560
like you know you do have some intuitive
 

8477
02:14:32,560 --> 02:14:33,830
like you know you do have some intuitive
reasoning about those building blocks

8478
02:14:33,830 --> 02:14:33,840
reasoning about those building blocks
 

8479
02:14:33,840 --> 02:14:34,629
reasoning about those building blocks
but like at least

8480
02:14:34,629 --> 02:14:34,639
but like at least
 

8481
02:14:34,639 --> 02:14:35,910
but like at least
there's a small number of building

8482
02:14:35,910 --> 02:14:35,920
there's a small number of building
 

8483
02:14:35,920 --> 02:14:37,350
there's a small number of building
blocks and lots of people are looking at

8484
02:14:37,350 --> 02:14:37,360
blocks and lots of people are looking at
 

8485
02:14:37,360 --> 02:14:37,910
blocks and lots of people are looking at
them

8486
02:14:37,910 --> 02:14:37,920
them
 

8487
02:14:37,920 --> 02:14:39,350
them
and then everything else just sort of

8488
02:14:39,350 --> 02:14:39,360
and then everything else just sort of
 

8489
02:14:39,360 --> 02:14:40,870
and then everything else just sort of
gets formally built on top and you

8490
02:14:40,870 --> 02:14:40,880
gets formally built on top and you
 

8491
02:14:40,880 --> 02:14:41,669
gets formally built on top and you
actually can

8492
02:14:41,669 --> 02:14:41,679
actually can
 

8493
02:14:41,679 --> 02:14:43,430
actually can
like mathematically reduce the security

8494
02:14:43,430 --> 02:14:43,440
like mathematically reduce the security
 

8495
02:14:43,440 --> 02:14:45,510
like mathematically reduce the security
of big thanks to building blocks right

8496
02:14:45,510 --> 02:14:45,520
of big thanks to building blocks right
 

8497
02:14:45,520 --> 02:14:47,750
of big thanks to building blocks right
like you can have mathematical proofs

8498
02:14:47,750 --> 02:14:47,760
like you can have mathematical proofs
 

8499
02:14:47,760 --> 02:14:48,550
like you can have mathematical proofs
that say

8500
02:14:48,550 --> 02:14:48,560
that say
 

8501
02:14:48,560 --> 02:14:51,910
that say
you know if you make a zk snark of a yes

8502
02:14:51,910 --> 02:14:51,920
you know if you make a zk snark of a yes
 

8503
02:14:51,920 --> 02:14:53,589
you know if you make a zk snark of a yes
statement when in reality that statement

8504
02:14:53,589 --> 02:14:53,599
statement when in reality that statement
 

8505
02:14:53,599 --> 02:14:54,470
statement when in reality that statement
is false

8506
02:14:54,470 --> 02:14:54,480
is false
 

8507
02:14:54,480 --> 02:14:57,750
is false
then you can use that to like

8508
02:14:57,750 --> 02:14:57,760
then you can use that to like
 

8509
02:14:57,760 --> 02:14:59,910
then you can use that to like
extract information out of elliptic

8510
02:14:59,910 --> 02:14:59,920
extract information out of elliptic
 

8511
02:14:59,920 --> 02:15:01,189
extract information out of elliptic
curves that you know it completely

8512
02:15:01,189 --> 02:15:01,199
curves that you know it completely
 

8513
02:15:01,199 --> 02:15:02,390
curves that you know it completely
breaks the problem or something like

8514
02:15:02,390 --> 02:15:02,400
breaks the problem or something like
 

8515
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:03,270
breaks the problem or something like
that

8516
02:15:03,270 --> 02:15:03,280
that
 

8517
02:15:03,280 --> 02:15:05,990
that
uh so so zika is an example where

8518
02:15:05,990 --> 02:15:06,000
uh so so zika is an example where
 

8519
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:06,950
uh so so zika is an example where
formalism is

8520
02:15:06,950 --> 02:15:06,960
formalism is
 

8521
02:15:06,960 --> 02:15:09,830
formalism is
is beneficial absolutely yeah and so

8522
02:15:09,830 --> 02:15:09,840
is beneficial absolutely yeah and so
 

8523
02:15:09,840 --> 02:15:10,950
is beneficial absolutely yeah and so
maybe you can have the same kind of

8524
02:15:10,950 --> 02:15:10,960
maybe you can have the same kind of
 

8525
02:15:10,960 --> 02:15:13,270
maybe you can have the same kind of
stuff in the ai safety within

8526
02:15:13,270 --> 02:15:13,280
stuff in the ai safety within
 

8527
02:15:13,280 --> 02:15:16,149
stuff in the ai safety within
within ai systems that you can get get a

8528
02:15:16,149 --> 02:15:16,159
within ai systems that you can get get a
 

8529
02:15:16,159 --> 02:15:18,229
within ai systems that you can get get a
hold of some kind of

8530
02:15:18,229 --> 02:15:18,239
hold of some kind of
 

8531
02:15:18,239 --> 02:15:19,669
hold of some kind of
aspect of the systems that you can

8532
02:15:19,669 --> 02:15:19,679
aspect of the systems that you can
 

8533
02:15:19,679 --> 02:15:21,270
aspect of the systems that you can
control right provably

8534
02:15:21,270 --> 02:15:21,280
control right provably
 

8535
02:15:21,280 --> 02:15:23,030
control right provably
and then in blockchains and

8536
02:15:23,030 --> 02:15:23,040
and then in blockchains and
 

8537
02:15:23,040 --> 02:15:24,310
and then in blockchains and
cryptocurrency i

8538
02:15:24,310 --> 02:15:24,320
cryptocurrency i
 

8539
02:15:24,320 --> 02:15:26,629
cryptocurrency i
think the one area where consensus like

8540
02:15:26,629 --> 02:15:26,639
think the one area where consensus like
 

8541
02:15:26,639 --> 02:15:28,390
think the one area where consensus like
mechanisms is still more an art than a

8544
02:15:28,950 --> 02:15:28,960
science
 

8545
02:15:28,960 --> 02:15:30,950
science
is that these aren't just like

02:15:32,390 --> 02:15:32,400
technological systems they're crypto
 

8549
02:15:32,400 --> 02:15:33,830
technological systems they're crypto
economic systems right and they make

8550
02:15:33,830 --> 02:15:33,840
economic systems right and they make
 

8551
02:15:33,840 --> 02:15:35,270
economic systems right and they make
assumptions about people

8552
02:15:35,270 --> 02:15:35,280
assumptions about people
 

8553
02:15:35,280 --> 02:15:37,189
assumptions about people
and which assumptions you can make about

8554
02:15:37,189 --> 02:15:37,199
and which assumptions you can make about
 

8555
02:15:37,199 --> 02:15:38,550
and which assumptions you can make about
people is not something that you can

8556
02:15:38,550 --> 02:15:38,560
people is not something that you can
 

8557
02:15:38,560 --> 02:15:39,510
people is not something that you can
prove with math

8558
02:15:39,510 --> 02:15:39,520
prove with math
 

8559
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:43,270
prove with math
right the even just the basic 51 percent

8560
02:15:43,270 --> 02:15:43,280
right the even just the basic 51 percent
 

8561
02:15:43,280 --> 02:15:45,830
right the even just the basic 51 percent
exact people are honest can you trust

8562
02:15:45,830 --> 02:15:45,840
exact people are honest can you trust
 

8563
02:15:45,840 --> 02:15:47,030
exact people are honest can you trust
the 51 percent

8564
02:15:47,030 --> 02:15:47,040
the 51 percent
 

8565
02:15:47,040 --> 02:15:49,510
the 51 percent
um if you can't trust the 51 can you

8566
02:15:49,510 --> 02:15:49,520
um if you can't trust the 51 can you
 

8567
02:15:49,520 --> 02:15:51,189
um if you can't trust the 51 can you

there's all of these assumptions
 

8581
02:16:01,920 --> 02:16:03,910
there's all of these assumptions
yeah but you know at the same time look

8582

yeah but you know at the same time look
 

8583
02:16:03,920 --> 02:16:05,510
yeah but you know at the same time look
if you can write down the assumptions

if you can write down the assumptions
 

8585
02:16:05,520 --> 02:16:06,950
if you can write down the assumptions
then you can like do

8586

then you can like do
 

8587
02:16:06,960 --> 02:16:09,189
then you can like do

and i thought
 

8647
02:17:09,200 --> 02:17:10,870
and i thought
and i said like hey i think nfts are

8648

of these pure

8912
02:21:22,950 --> 02:21:22,960

 

8913
02:21:22,960 --> 02:21:25,910

that was definitely really terrible and
i actually

8918
02:21:28,309 --> 02:21:28,319
i actually
 

8919
02:21:28,319 --> 02:21:29,990
i actually
i feel like we have less despite

8920
02:21:29,990 --> 02:21:30,000
i feel like we have less despite
 

8921
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:31,510
i feel like we have less despite
cryptocurrency as a whole being bigger

8922
02:21:31,510 --> 02:21:31,520
cryptocurrency as a whole being bigger
 

8923
02:21:31,520 --> 02:21:33,110
cryptocurrency as a whole being bigger
we actually have

8924
02:21:33,110 --> 02:21:33,120
we actually have
 

8925
02:21:33,120 --> 02:21:35,190
we actually have
quite a bit less of that now but then of

8926
02:21:35,190 --> 02:21:35,200
quite a bit less of that now but then of
 

8927
02:21:35,200 --> 02:21:36,710
quite a bit less of that now but then of
course you know there's this bit this

8928
02:21:36,710 --> 02:21:36,720
course you know there's this bit this
 

8929
02:21:36,720 --> 02:21:37,750
course you know there's this bit this
spectrum

8930
02:21:37,750 --> 02:21:37,760
spectrum
 

8931
02:21:37,760 --> 02:21:40,070
spectrum
of things that are not completely scams

8932
02:21:40,070 --> 02:21:40,080
of things that are not completely scams
 

8933
02:21:40,080 --> 02:21:41,670
of things that are not completely scams
um and then things that are

8934
02:21:41,670 --> 02:21:41,680
um and then things that are
 

8935
02:21:41,680 --> 02:21:43,110
um and then things that are
not scams and that are technically

8936
02:21:43,110 --> 02:21:43,120
not scams and that are technically
 

8937
02:21:43,120 --> 02:21:45,190
not scams and that are technically
totally fine projects but where

8938
02:21:45,190 --> 02:21:45,200
totally fine projects but where
 

8939
02:21:45,200 --> 02:21:47,510
totally fine projects but where
the their community is just incredibly

8940
02:21:47,510 --> 02:21:47,520
the their community is just incredibly
 

8941
02:21:47,520 --> 02:21:48,389
the their community is just incredibly
sketchy

8942
02:21:48,389 --> 02:21:48,399
sketchy
 

8943
02:21:48,399 --> 02:21:50,389
sketchy
and then all the way to you know things

8944
02:21:50,389 --> 02:21:50,399
and then all the way to you know things
 

8945
02:21:50,399 --> 02:21:52,469
and then all the way to you know things
that are where the community is nice but

8946
02:21:52,469 --> 02:21:52,479
that are where the community is nice but
 

8947
02:21:52,479 --> 02:21:53,349
that are where the community is nice but
maybe the

8948
02:21:53,349 --> 02:21:53,359
maybe the
 

8949
02:21:53,359 --> 02:21:55,190
maybe the
project is just fundamentally incapable

8950
02:21:55,190 --> 02:21:55,200
project is just fundamentally incapable
 

8951
02:21:55,200 --> 02:21:56,550
project is just fundamentally incapable
of achieving what it's trying to do or

8952
02:21:56,550 --> 02:21:56,560
of achieving what it's trying to do or
 

8953
02:21:56,560 --> 02:21:57,910
of achieving what it's trying to do or
in the community doesn't realize and

8954
02:21:57,910 --> 02:21:57,920
in the community doesn't realize and
 

8955
02:21:57,920 --> 02:21:58,389
in the community doesn't realize and
then

8956
02:21:58,389 --> 02:21:58,399
then
 

8957
02:21:58,399 --> 02:22:00,870
then
you know a really good project right so

8958
02:22:00,870 --> 02:22:00,880
you know a really good project right so
 

8959
02:22:00,880 --> 02:22:01,830
you know a really good project right so
like

8960
02:22:01,830 --> 02:22:01,840
like
 

8961
02:22:01,840 --> 02:22:04,950
like

one example this is a craig wright's
fork of bitcoin

8972
02:22:13,190 --> 02:22:13,200
fork of bitcoin
 

8973
02:22:13,200 --> 02:22:15,030
fork of bitcoin
like theoretically it's a blockchain

8974
02:22:15,030 --> 02:22:15,040
like theoretically it's a blockchain
 

8975
02:22:15,040 --> 02:22:16,870
like theoretically it's a blockchain
right it's a fork of bitcoin

8976
02:22:16,870 --> 02:22:16,880
right it's a fork of bitcoin
 

8977
02:22:16,880 --> 02:22:19,429
right it's a fork of bitcoin
it has some you know 500 12 megabyte

8978
02:22:19,429 --> 02:22:19,439
it has some you know 500 12 megabyte
 

8979
02:22:19,439 --> 02:22:20,070
it has some you know 500 12 megabyte
blocks

8980
02:22:20,070 --> 02:22:20,080
blocks
 

8981
02:22:20,080 --> 02:22:21,590
blocks
if you really wanted to you could use

8982
02:22:21,590 --> 02:22:21,600
if you really wanted to you could use
 

8983
02:22:21,600 --> 02:22:23,190
if you really wanted to you could use
the blockchain you know it's uh

8984
02:22:23,190 --> 02:22:23,200
the blockchain you know it's uh
 

8985
02:22:23,200 --> 02:22:24,790
the blockchain you know it's uh
it satisfies the property is that you

8986
02:22:24,790 --> 02:22:24,800
it satisfies the property is that you
 

8987
02:22:24,800 --> 02:22:26,389
it satisfies the property is that you
know you can send transactions

8988
02:22:26,389 --> 02:22:26,399
know you can send transactions
 

8989
02:22:26,399 --> 02:22:29,429
know you can send transactions
onto it you can probably um you know use

8990
02:22:29,429 --> 02:22:29,439
onto it you can probably um you know use
 

8991
02:22:29,439 --> 02:22:29,990
onto it you can probably um you know use
it as

as a backup to store your files if you
 

8995
02:22:31,680 --> 02:22:34,150
as a backup to store your files if you
really wanted to just because it has

8996
02:22:34,150 --> 02:22:34,160
really wanted to just because it has
 

8997
02:22:34,160 --> 02:22:36,070
really wanted to just because it has
it has so much space you know it might

8998
02:22:36,070 --> 02:22:36,080
it has so much space you know it might
 

8999
02:22:36,080 --> 02:22:38,070
it has so much space you know it might
fail but

02:26:10,800 --> 02:26:12,630
make like one be a litecoin as as best
as they can then like that's

9212
02:26:12,630 --> 02:26:12,640
as they can then like that's
 

9213
02:26:12,640 --> 02:26:14,150
as they can then like that's
to me that's enough for it to not be a

9214
02:26:14,150 --> 02:26:14,160
to me that's enough for it to not be a
 

9215
02:26:14,160 --> 02:26:15,910
to me that's enough for it to not be a
scam yeah um

9216
02:26:15,910 --> 02:26:15,920
scam yeah um
 

9217
02:26:15,920 --> 02:26:19,190
scam yeah um
that's and then so

9218
02:26:19,190 --> 02:26:19,200
that's and then so
 

9219
02:26:19,200 --> 02:26:21,270
that's and then so
yeah i think the the biggest gray area

9220
02:26:21,270 --> 02:26:21,280
yeah i think the the biggest gray area
 

9221
02:26:21,280 --> 02:26:23,190
yeah i think the the biggest gray area
is definitely between

9222
02:26:23,190 --> 02:26:23,200
is definitely between
 

9223
02:26:23,200 --> 02:26:26,469
is definitely between
like projects that

9224
02:26:26,469 --> 02:26:26,479
like projects that
 

9225
02:26:26,479 --> 02:26:28,790
like projects that
are earnest and but you know they have

9226
02:26:28,790 --> 02:26:28,800
are earnest and but you know they have
 

9227
02:26:28,800 --> 02:26:30,469
are earnest and but you know they have
just all sorts of these

9228
02:26:30,469 --> 02:26:30,479
just all sorts of these
 

9229
02:26:30,479 --> 02:26:32,389
just all sorts of these
like different combinations of flawed

9230
02:26:32,389 --> 02:26:32,399
like different combinations of flawed
 

9231
02:26:32,399 --> 02:26:34,230
like different combinations of flawed
qualities to them yeah yeah

9232
02:26:34,230 --> 02:26:34,240
qualities to them yeah yeah
 

9233
02:26:34,240 --> 02:26:36,230
qualities to them yeah yeah
i mean the the ones that legitimately is

9234
02:26:36,230 --> 02:26:36,240
i mean the the ones that legitimately is
 

9235
02:26:36,240 --> 02:26:37,510
i mean the the ones that legitimately is
a scam is when

9236
02:26:37,510 --> 02:26:37,520
a scam is when
 

9237
02:26:37,520 --> 02:26:39,190
a scam is when
the key people that are at the head of

9238
02:26:39,190 --> 02:26:39,200
the key people that are at the head of
 

9239
02:26:39,200 --> 02:26:42,389
the key people that are at the head of
the project are intentionally lying

9240
02:26:42,389 --> 02:26:42,399
the project are intentionally lying
 

9241
02:26:42,399 --> 02:26:45,830
the project are intentionally lying
and i think as long as their the intent

9242
02:26:45,830 --> 02:26:45,840
and i think as long as their the intent
 

9243
02:26:45,840 --> 02:26:48,389
and i think as long as their the intent
is to try to do good in the world even

9244
02:26:48,389 --> 02:26:48,399
is to try to do good in the world even
 

9245
02:26:48,399 --> 02:26:49,110
is to try to do good in the world even
if the

9246
02:26:49,110 --> 02:26:49,120
if the
 

9247
02:26:49,120 --> 02:26:50,790
if the
your actual implementation of that is

9248
02:26:50,790 --> 02:26:50,800
your actual implementation of that is
 

9249
02:26:50,800 --> 02:26:53,349
your actual implementation of that is
flawed i think that's not a scam

9250
02:26:53,349 --> 02:26:53,359
flawed i think that's not a scam
 

9251
02:26:53,359 --> 02:26:54,950
flawed i think that's not a scam
it could be flawed ideas it could be

9252
02:26:54,950 --> 02:26:54,960
it could be flawed ideas it could be

challenging space to navigate i mean you
know it's uh

9262
02:27:07,110 --> 02:27:07,120
know it's uh
 

9263

anti-aging and longevity research
i think i hope to see the concept of

9372
02:29:03,590 --> 02:29:03,600
i think i hope to see the concept of
 

9373
02:29:03,600 --> 02:29:05,429
i think i hope to see the concept of
what of us seeing your parents and

9374
02:29:05,429 --> 02:29:05,439
what of us seeing your parents and
 

9375
02:29:05,439 --> 02:29:07,670
what of us seeing your parents and
grandparents die just slowly disappear

9376

experience that happens
over the course of uh half a century the

over the course of uh half a century the
 

9383

over the course of uh half a century the
same way that getting lost in

same way that getting lost in
 

9385
02:29:14,319 --> 02:29:16,070
same way that getting lost in
a city slowly disappeared over the

a city slowly disappeared over the
 

9387

essay
uh pinned in your twitter is argues that

9396

uh pinned in your twitter is argues that
 

9397

uh pinned in your twitter is argues that
essentially that you know death is

9398

essentially that you know death is
 

9399
02:29:30,720 --> 02:29:33,670
essentially that you know death is
almost unethical like the fact that we

9400
02:29:33,670 --> 02:29:33,680
almost unethical like the fact that we
 

9401
02:29:33,680 --> 02:29:35,510
almost unethical like the fact that we
don't do something about this thing that

9402
02:29:35,510 --> 02:29:35,520
don't do something about this thing that
 

9403
02:29:35,520 --> 02:29:36,309
don't do something about this thing that
um

9404

um
 

9405
02:29:36,319 --> 02:29:39,030
um
this in the essays is a dragon that

02:29:39,030 --> 02:29:39,040
this in the essays is a dragon that
 

9407
02:29:39,040 --> 02:29:40,150
this in the essays is a dragon that
keeps

9408
02:29:40,150 --> 02:29:40,160
keeps
 

9409
02:29:40,160 --> 02:29:43,349

like murdering everybody around us

9410
02:29:43,349 --> 02:29:43,359
like murdering everybody around us
 

9411
02:29:43,359 --> 02:29:45,990
like murdering everybody around us
including our parents and grandparents

9412
02:29:45,990 --> 02:29:46,000
including our parents and grandparents
 

9413
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:46,630
including our parents and grandparents
is uh

9414
02:29:46,630 --> 02:29:46,640
is uh
 

9415
02:29:46,640 --> 02:29:48,150
is uh
like the fact that we don't try to do

9416
02:29:48,150 --> 02:29:48,160
like the fact that we don't try to do
 

9417
02:29:48,160 --> 02:29:51,110
like the fact that we don't try to do
something aggressively about that dragon

02:29:51,110 --> 02:29:51,120
something aggressively about that dragon
 

9419
02:29:51,120 --> 02:29:55,590
something aggressively about that dragon
is uh doesn't make any sense um

9420
02:29:55,590 --> 02:29:55,600
is uh doesn't make any sense um
 

9421
02:29:55,600 --> 02:29:57,830
is uh doesn't make any sense um
so you think this is a battle worth

9422
02:29:57,830 --> 02:29:57,840
so you think this is a battle worth
 

9423
02:29:57,840 --> 02:30:00,150
so you think this is a battle worth
fighting a battle for immortality or at

9424
02:30:00,150 --> 02:30:00,160
fighting a battle for immortality or at
 

9425
02:30:00,160 --> 02:30:01,670
fighting a battle for immortality or at
least longevity

9426
02:30:01,670 --> 02:30:01,680
least longevity
 

9427
02:30:01,680 --> 02:30:03,670
least longevity
i'd say absolutely and i'd say it's a

9428
02:30:03,670 --> 02:30:03,680
i'd say absolutely and i'd say it's a
 

9429
02:30:03,680 --> 02:30:04,790
i'd say absolutely and i'd say it's a
battle where

9430
02:30:04,790 --> 02:30:04,800
battle where
 

9431
02:30:04,800 --> 02:30:08,309
battle where
we're really have started over the last

9432
02:30:08,309 --> 02:30:08,319
we're really have started over the last
 

9433
02:30:08,319 --> 02:30:09,990
we're really have started over the last
five years in particular to see

9434
02:30:09,990 --> 02:30:10,000
five years in particular to see
 

9435
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:13,190
five years in particular to see
the first cracks of uh no humanities

9436
02:30:13,190 --> 02:30:13,200
the first cracks of uh no humanities
 

9437
02:30:13,200 --> 02:30:15,750
the first cracks of uh no humanities
and me starting to make things that look

9438
02:30:15,750 --> 02:30:15,760
and me starting to make things that look
 

9439
02:30:15,760 --> 02:30:18,630
and me starting to make things that look
like they'll turn into victories

9440
02:30:18,630 --> 02:30:18,640
like they'll turn into victories
 

9441
02:30:18,640 --> 02:30:20,790
like they'll turn into victories
do you uh do you think humans can

9442
02:30:20,790 --> 02:30:20,800
do you uh do you think humans can
 

9443
02:30:20,800 --> 02:30:22,630
do you uh do you think humans can
eventually live forever

9444
02:30:22,630 --> 02:30:22,640
eventually live forever
 

9445
02:30:22,640 --> 02:30:26,230
eventually live forever
and maybe as a side comment to that what

9446
02:30:26,230 --> 02:30:26,240
and maybe as a side comment to that what
 

9447
02:30:26,240 --> 02:30:27,910
and maybe as a side comment to that what
technology do you think will enable that

9448
02:30:27,910 --> 02:30:27,920
technology do you think will enable that
 

9449
02:30:27,920 --> 02:30:29,830
technology do you think will enable that
is a genetic modification

9450
02:30:29,830 --> 02:30:29,840
is a genetic modification
 

9451
02:30:29,840 --> 02:30:32,309
is a genetic modification
is it cloning is it uploading your mind

9452
02:30:32,309 --> 02:30:32,319
is it cloning is it uploading your mind
 

9453
02:30:32,319 --> 02:30:33,910
is it cloning is it uploading your mind
define forever like are we talking a

9454
02:30:33,910 --> 02:30:33,920
define forever like are we talking a
 

9455
02:30:33,920 --> 02:30:35,270
define forever like are we talking a
thousand years a million

9456
02:30:35,270 --> 02:30:35,280
thousand years a million
 

9457
02:30:35,280 --> 02:30:38,389
thousand years a million
10 to the 14 10 to the 45

9458
02:30:38,389 --> 02:30:38,399
10 to the 14 10 to the 45
 

9459
02:30:38,399 --> 02:30:40,469
10 to the 14 10 to the 45
well let's start as i tweeted today

9460
02:30:40,469 --> 02:30:40,479
well let's start as i tweeted today
 

9461
02:30:40,479 --> 02:30:41,429
well let's start as i tweeted today
eventually everything

9462
02:30:41,429 --> 02:30:41,439
eventually everything
 

9463
02:30:41,439 --> 02:30:43,030
eventually everything
uh the universe will be filled with

9464
02:30:43,030 --> 02:30:43,040
uh the universe will be filled with
 

9465
02:30:43,040 --> 02:30:44,630
uh the universe will be filled with
supermassive black holes

9466
02:30:44,630 --> 02:30:44,640
supermassive black holes
 

9467
02:30:44,640 --> 02:30:47,830
supermassive black holes
so that that forever maybe like

9468
02:30:47,830 --> 02:30:47,840
so that that forever maybe like
 

9469
02:30:47,840 --> 02:30:49,830
so that that forever maybe like
backtracking to work we'll have we'll

9470
02:30:49,830 --> 02:30:49,840
backtracking to work we'll have we'll
 

9471
02:30:49,840 --> 02:30:50,870
backtracking to work we'll have we'll
have 10 the

9472
02:30:50,870 --> 02:30:50,880
have 10 the
 

9473
02:30:50,880 --> 02:30:54,950
have 10 the
16 years to figure it out yes

9474
02:30:54,950 --> 02:30:54,960

 

9475
02:30:54,960 --> 02:30:58,469

uh yeah maybe travel between um

9476
02:30:58,469 --> 02:30:58,479
uh yeah maybe travel between um
 

9477
02:30:58,479 --> 02:31:00,309
uh yeah maybe travel between um
between the multiverse between the

9478
02:31:00,309 --> 02:31:00,319
between the multiverse between the
 

9479
02:31:00,319 --> 02:31:02,870
between the multiverse between the
different universes the multiverse

9480
02:31:02,870 --> 02:31:02,880
different universes the multiverse
 

9481
02:31:02,880 --> 02:31:06,630
different universes the multiverse
i mean but forever meaning like

9482
02:31:06,630 --> 02:31:06,640
i mean but forever meaning like
 

9483
02:31:06,640 --> 02:31:10,870
i mean but forever meaning like
you know uh millennia um um

9484
02:31:10,870 --> 02:31:10,880
you know uh millennia um um
 

9485
02:31:10,880 --> 02:31:12,950
you know uh millennia um um
i guess i definitely think that we can

9486
02:31:12,950 --> 02:31:12,960
i guess i definitely think that we can
 

9487
02:31:12,960 --> 02:31:15,030
i guess i definitely think that we can
get there i definitely think that it's

9488
02:31:15,030 --> 02:31:15,040
get there i definitely think that it's
 

9489
02:31:15,040 --> 02:31:16,630
get there i definitely think that it's
the sort of thing that's

9490
02:31:16,630 --> 02:31:16,640
the sort of thing that's
 

9491
02:31:16,640 --> 02:31:18,550
the sort of thing that's
going to take an insanely huge amount of

9492
02:31:18,550 --> 02:31:18,560
going to take an insanely huge amount of
 

9493
02:31:18,560 --> 02:31:20,550
going to take an insanely huge amount of
work and i definitely think it's the

9494
02:31:20,550 --> 02:31:20,560
work and i definitely think it's the
 

9495
02:31:20,560 --> 02:31:21,750
work and i definitely think it's the
sort of thing where

9496
02:31:21,750 --> 02:31:21,760
sort of thing where
 

9497
02:31:21,760 --> 02:31:23,270
sort of thing where
you know once we figure out the first

9498
02:31:23,270 --> 02:31:23,280
you know once we figure out the first
 

9499
02:31:23,280 --> 02:31:25,270
you know once we figure out the first
crop of problems and

9500
02:31:25,270 --> 02:31:25,280
crop of problems and
 

9501
02:31:25,280 --> 02:31:27,670
crop of problems and
like people start living to 150 we'll

9502
02:31:27,670 --> 02:31:27,680
like people start living to 150 we'll
 

9503
02:31:27,680 --> 02:31:29,190
like people start living to 150 we'll
just realize that there's like 10 other

9504
02:31:29,190 --> 02:31:29,200
just realize that there's like 10 other
 

9505
02:31:29,200 --> 02:31:30,710
just realize that there's like 10 other
problems that kill you half a slowly and

9506
02:31:30,710 --> 02:31:30,720
problems that kill you half a slowly and
 

9507
02:31:30,720 --> 02:31:31,990
problems that kill you half a slowly and
will have to do more work

9508
02:31:31,990 --> 02:31:32,000
will have to do more work
 

9509
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,550
will have to do more work
but you know the good news is that this

9510
02:31:34,550 --> 02:31:34,560
but you know the good news is that this
 

9511
02:31:34,560 --> 02:31:36,070
but you know the good news is that this
this is you know aubry's longevity

9512
02:31:36,070 --> 02:31:36,080
this is you know aubry's longevity
 

9513
02:31:36,080 --> 02:31:37,590
this is you know aubry's longevity
escape velocity argument that

9514
02:31:37,590 --> 02:31:37,600
escape velocity argument that
 

9515
02:31:37,600 --> 02:31:40,070
escape velocity argument that
if you get everyone to lift 250 now then

9516
02:31:40,070 --> 02:31:40,080
if you get everyone to lift 250 now then
 

9517
02:31:40,080 --> 02:31:41,750
if you get everyone to lift 250 now then
you know you have half a century to fix

9518
02:31:41,750 --> 02:31:41,760
you know you have half a century to fix
 

9519
02:31:41,760 --> 02:31:45,270
you know you have half a century to fix
all those other problems as well so yeah

9520
02:31:45,270 --> 02:31:45,280
all those other problems as well so yeah
 

9521
02:31:45,280 --> 02:31:47,750
all those other problems as well so yeah
i'm optimistic for that reason i think

9522
02:31:47,750 --> 02:31:47,760
i'm optimistic for that reason i think
 

9523
02:31:47,760 --> 02:31:48,389
i'm optimistic for that reason i think
um

9524
02:31:48,389 --> 02:31:48,399
um
 

9525
02:31:48,399 --> 02:31:50,710
um
it you definitely do not want to

9526
02:31:50,710 --> 02:31:50,720
it you definitely do not want to
 

9527
02:31:50,720 --> 02:31:51,750
it you definitely do not want to
underestimate

9528
02:31:51,750 --> 02:31:51,760
underestimate
 

9529
02:31:51,760 --> 02:31:53,590
underestimate
uh human ingenuity especially over the

9530
02:31:53,590 --> 02:31:53,600
uh human ingenuity especially over the
 

9531
02:31:53,600 --> 02:31:55,190
uh human ingenuity especially over the
long term but just to look at what

9532
02:31:55,190 --> 02:31:55,200
long term but just to look at what
 

9533
02:31:55,200 --> 02:31:57,030
long term but just to look at what
happens to computers between you know

9534
02:31:57,030 --> 02:31:57,040
happens to computers between you know
 

9535
02:31:57,040 --> 02:31:58,870
happens to computers between you know
the eniac in 1950 and where we are in

9536
02:31:58,870 --> 02:31:58,880
the eniac in 1950 and where we are in
 

9537
02:31:58,880 --> 02:32:00,870
the eniac in 1950 and where we are in
2020 right like that's

9538
02:32:00,870 --> 02:32:00,880
2020 right like that's
 

9539
02:32:00,880 --> 02:32:03,270
2020 right like that's
a span of 70 years um so like you know

9540
02:32:03,270 --> 02:32:03,280
a span of 70 years um so like you know
 

9541
02:32:03,280 --> 02:32:04,550
a span of 70 years um so like you know
both of us i think

9542
02:32:04,550 --> 02:32:04,560
both of us i think
 

9543
02:32:04,560 --> 02:32:07,030
both of us i think
with uh you know even just present-day

9544
02:32:07,030 --> 02:32:07,040
with uh you know even just present-day
 

9545
02:32:07,040 --> 02:32:07,830
with uh you know even just present-day
technology and

9546
02:32:07,830 --> 02:32:07,840
technology and
 

9547
02:32:07,840 --> 02:32:10,950
technology and
we have at least 70 more years to left

9548
02:32:10,950 --> 02:32:10,960
we have at least 70 more years to left
 

9549
02:32:10,960 --> 02:32:12,550
we have at least 70 more years to left
so just like imagine what kind of sea

9550
02:32:12,550 --> 02:32:12,560
so just like imagine what kind of sea
 

9551
02:32:12,560 --> 02:32:14,550
so just like imagine what kind of sea
change will happen in biomedicine

change will happen in biomedicine
 

9553
02:32:14,560 --> 02:32:16,630
change will happen in biomedicine
during that time and the other thing

9554
02:32:16,630 --> 02:32:16,640
during that time and the other thing
 

9555
02:32:16,640 --> 02:32:18,070
during that time and the other thing
that made me optimistic is that i

9556
02:32:18,070 --> 02:32:18,080
that made me optimistic is that i
 

9557
02:32:18,080 --> 02:32:18,550

02:33:09,840 --> 02:33:12,630
philosophical attitude here
this is going more depth first is that i

9606
02:33:12,630 --> 02:33:12,640
this is going more depth first is that i
 

9607

the way that i kind of interpret part of
 

9611
02:33:16,640 --> 02:33:18,550
the way that i kind of interpret part of
what i would call late 20th century

9612
02:33:18,550 --> 02:33:18,560
what i would call late 20th century
 

9613
02:33:18,560 --> 02:33:20,870
what i would call late 20th century
ideology is that there is this mentality

9614
02:33:20,870 --> 02:33:20,880
ideology is that there is this mentality
 

9615
02:33:20,880 --> 02:33:21,270
ideology is that there is this mentality
that

9616
02:33:21,270 --> 02:33:21,280
that
 

9617
02:33:21,280 --> 02:33:24,230
that
you know nature is good and disruptions

9618
02:33:24,230 --> 02:33:24,240
you know nature is good and disruptions
 

9619
02:33:24,240 --> 02:33:24,950
you know nature is good and disruptions
from nature

9620
02:33:24,950 --> 02:33:24,960
from nature
 

9621
02:33:24,960 --> 02:33:26,630
from nature
are bad and generally you want to

9622
02:33:26,630 --> 02:33:26,640
are bad and generally you want to
 

9623
02:33:26,640 --> 02:33:28,469
are bad and generally you want to
minimize disruptions from nature

9624
02:33:28,469 --> 02:33:28,479
minimize disruptions from nature
 

9625
02:33:28,479 --> 02:33:29,990
minimize disruptions from nature
and like this exists everywhere in the

9626
02:33:29,990 --> 02:33:30,000
and like this exists everywhere in the
 

9627
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:31,349
and like this exists everywhere in the
political spectrum right so there's

9628
02:33:31,349 --> 02:33:31,359
political spectrum right so there's
 

9629
02:33:31,359 --> 02:33:33,190
political spectrum right so there's
nature as in literal nature

9630
02:33:33,190 --> 02:33:33,200
nature as in literal nature
 

9631
02:33:33,200 --> 02:33:35,030
nature as in literal nature
and my view is that like the right wing

and my view is that like the right wing
 

9633
02:33:35,040 --> 02:33:36,790
and my view is that like the right wing
version of that is market sas nature

02:34:37,680 --> 02:34:38,870
which is like basically treating aging
as an engineering problem

9692
02:34:38,870 --> 02:34:38,880
as an engineering problem
 

9693
02:34:38,880 --> 02:34:42,309
as an engineering problem
right like the default is all 7.8

9694
02:34:42,309 --> 02:34:42,319
right like the default is all 7.8
 

9695
02:34:42,319 --> 02:34:43,670
right like the default is all 7.8
billion human beings that are currently

9696
02:34:43,670 --> 02:34:43,680
billion human beings that are currently
 

9697
02:34:43,680 --> 02:34:43,990
billion human beings that are currently
on this

9698
02:34:43,990 --> 02:34:44,000
on this
 

9699
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:45,110
on this
earth are going to die and they're going

9700
02:34:45,110 --> 02:34:45,120
earth are going to die and they're going
 

9701
02:34:45,120 --> 02:34:47,349
earth are going to die and they're going
to live their last decade of life in a

9702
02:34:47,349 --> 02:34:47,359
to live their last decade of life in a
 

9703
02:34:47,359 --> 02:34:48,710
to live their last decade of life in a
debilitating pain

9704
02:34:48,710 --> 02:34:48,720
debilitating pain
 

9705
02:34:48,720 --> 02:34:50,950
debilitating pain
and the only way to stop that is human

9706
02:34:50,950 --> 02:34:50,960
and the only way to stop that is human
 

9707
02:34:50,960 --> 02:34:51,830
and the only way to stop that is human
ingenuity

9708
02:34:51,830 --> 02:34:51,840
ingenuity
 

9709
02:34:51,840 --> 02:34:53,349
ingenuity
and you know we don't we don't have that

9710
02:34:53,349 --> 02:34:53,359
and you know we don't we don't have that
 

9711
02:34:53,359 --> 02:34:55,510
and you know we don't we don't have that
solution yet but you know if we work

9712
02:34:55,510 --> 02:34:55,520
solution yet but you know if we work
 

9713
02:34:55,520 --> 02:34:56,469
solution yet but you know if we work
hard we will

9714
02:34:56,469 --> 02:34:56,479
hard we will
 

9715
02:34:56,479 --> 02:34:58,309
hard we will
and more and more people on the biology

9716
02:34:58,309 --> 02:34:58,319
and more and more people on the biology
 

9717
02:34:58,319 --> 02:34:59,670
and more and more people on the biology
side computational biology

9718
02:34:59,670 --> 02:34:59,680
side computational biology
 

9719
02:34:59,680 --> 02:35:02,230
side computational biology
are basically converting the mess of the

9720
02:35:02,230 --> 02:35:02,240
are basically converting the mess of the
 

9721
02:35:02,240 --> 02:35:04,389
are basically converting the mess of the
the human biology into an engineering

9722
02:35:04,389 --> 02:35:04,399
the human biology into an engineering
 

9723
02:35:04,399 --> 02:35:05,190
the human biology into an engineering

problem
 

9725
02:35:05,200 --> 02:35:07,190
problem
and once that conversion is happening

9726
02:35:07,190 --> 02:35:07,200
and once that conversion is happening
 

9727
02:35:07,200 --> 02:35:08,389
and once that conversion is happening
looking at the

9728
02:35:08,389 --> 02:35:08,399
looking at the
 

9729
02:35:08,399 --> 02:35:09,990
looking at the
the genetical the proteins all those

9730
02:35:09,990 --> 02:35:10,000
the genetical the proteins all those
 

9731
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:11,429
the genetical the proteins all those
kinds of things once that conversion

9732
02:35:11,429 --> 02:35:11,439
kinds of things once that conversion
 

9733
02:35:11,439 --> 02:35:12,230
kinds of things once that conversion
happens

9734
02:35:12,230 --> 02:35:12,240
happens
 

9735
02:35:12,240 --> 02:35:15,190
happens
you can now apply the tools that we know

9736
02:35:15,190 --> 02:35:15,200
you can now apply the tools that we know
 

9737
02:35:15,200 --> 02:35:16,950
you can now apply the tools that we know
how to solve engineering problems

9738
02:35:16,950 --> 02:35:16,960
how to solve engineering problems
 

9739
02:35:16,960 --> 02:35:18,469
how to solve engineering problems
to solving it that way and then there's

9740
02:35:18,469 --> 02:35:18,479
to solving it that way and then there's
 

9741
02:35:18,479 --> 02:35:20,790
to solving it that way and then there's
also the other version which is

9742
02:35:20,790 --> 02:35:20,800
also the other version which is
 

9743
02:35:20,800 --> 02:35:23,670
also the other version which is
you know why do we romanticize this meat

9744
02:35:23,670 --> 02:35:23,680
you know why do we romanticize this meat
 

9745
02:35:23,680 --> 02:35:24,550
you know why do we romanticize this meat
vehicle

9746
02:35:24,550 --> 02:35:24,560
vehicle
 

9747
02:35:24,560 --> 02:35:27,510
vehicle
that ultimately is just the thing that

9748
02:35:27,510 --> 02:35:27,520
that ultimately is just the thing that
 

9749
02:35:27,520 --> 02:35:29,190
that ultimately is just the thing that
carries the brain maybe we can

9750
02:35:29,190 --> 02:35:29,200
carries the brain maybe we can
 

9751
02:35:29,200 --> 02:35:30,870
carries the brain maybe we can
more and more convert ourselves into the

9752
02:35:30,870 --> 02:35:30,880
more and more convert ourselves into the
 

9753
02:35:30,880 --> 02:35:32,309
more and more convert ourselves into the
digital realm

9754
02:35:32,309 --> 02:35:32,319
digital realm
 

9755
02:35:32,319 --> 02:35:34,150
digital realm
this is where like neural link yeah i

9756
02:35:34,150 --> 02:35:34,160
this is where like neural link yeah i
 

9757
02:35:34,160 --> 02:35:35,670
this is where like neural link yeah i
have the brain computer interfaces and

9758
02:35:35,670 --> 02:35:35,680
have the brain computer interfaces and
 

9759
02:35:35,680 --> 02:35:36,309
have the brain computer interfaces and
then achieve

9760
02:35:36,309 --> 02:35:36,319
then achieve
 

9761
02:35:36,319 --> 02:35:38,469
then achieve
immortality in the space of information

9762
02:35:38,469 --> 02:35:38,479
immortality in the space of information
 

9763
02:35:38,479 --> 02:35:39,990
immortality in the space of information
in the digital space versus the

9764
02:35:39,990 --> 02:35:40,000
in the digital space versus the
 

9765
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:41,670
in the digital space versus the
biology space that stuff's interesting

9766
02:35:41,670 --> 02:35:41,680
biology space that stuff's interesting
 

9767
02:35:41,680 --> 02:35:43,670
biology space that stuff's interesting
too i agree again i think

9768
02:35:43,670 --> 02:35:43,680
too i agree again i think
 

9769
02:35:43,680 --> 02:35:45,910
too i agree again i think
you know we we have enough resources and

9770
02:35:45,910 --> 02:35:45,920
you know we we have enough resources and
 

9771
02:35:45,920 --> 02:35:47,590
you know we we have enough resources and
we should just try all the parallel

9772
02:35:47,590 --> 02:35:47,600
we should just try all the parallel
 

9773
02:35:47,600 --> 02:35:49,750
we should just try all the parallel
tracks you know it's great that we have

9774
02:35:49,750 --> 02:35:49,760
tracks you know it's great that we have
 

9775
02:35:49,760 --> 02:35:51,110
tracks you know it's great that we have
people just trying to make our bodies

9776
02:35:51,110 --> 02:35:51,120
people just trying to make our bodies
 

9777
02:35:51,120 --> 02:35:52,469
people just trying to make our bodies
work it's great that we have people

9778
02:35:52,469 --> 02:35:52,479
work it's great that we have people
 

9779
02:35:52,479 --> 02:35:53,429
work it's great that we have people
trying to

9780
02:35:53,429 --> 02:35:53,439
trying to
 

9781
02:35:53,439 --> 02:35:56,389
trying to
upload like or improve brain scanning

9782
02:35:56,389 --> 02:35:56,399
upload like or improve brain scanning
 

9783
02:35:56,399 --> 02:35:57,670
upload like or improve brain scanning
it's also great that we have

9784
02:35:57,670 --> 02:35:57,680
it's also great that we have
 

9785
02:35:57,680 --> 02:35:59,510
it's also great that we have
just like people improving cryonics so

9786
02:35:59,510 --> 02:35:59,520
just like people improving cryonics so
 

9787
02:35:59,520 --> 02:36:00,790
just like people improving cryonics so
like we could just like

9788
02:36:00,790 --> 02:36:00,800
like we could just like
 

9789
02:36:00,800 --> 02:36:02,550
like we could just like
you know go to sleep in the freezer and

9790
02:36:02,550 --> 02:36:02,560
you know go to sleep in the freezer and
 

9791
02:36:02,560 --> 02:36:04,070
you know go to sleep in the freezer and
um eventually

9792
02:36:04,070 --> 02:36:04,080
um eventually
 

9793
02:36:04,080 --> 02:36:06,150
um eventually
hopefully sometime in the future you

9794
02:36:06,150 --> 02:36:06,160
hopefully sometime in the future you
 

9795
02:36:06,160 --> 02:36:07,990
hopefully sometime in the future you
know healthy is going to be able to wake

9796
02:36:07,990 --> 02:36:08,000
know healthy is going to be able to wake
 

9797
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,870
know healthy is going to be able to wake
up um all of this uh um you know you

9798
02:36:10,870 --> 02:36:10,880
up um all of this uh um you know you
 

9799
02:36:10,880 --> 02:36:12,309
up um all of this uh um you know you
know anyone who

9800
02:36:12,309 --> 02:36:12,319
know anyone who
 

9801
02:36:12,319 --> 02:36:14,389
know anyone who
gets chronically frozen today will be

9802
02:36:14,389 --> 02:36:14,399
gets chronically frozen today will be
 

9803
02:36:14,399 --> 02:36:15,830
gets chronically frozen today will be
able to wake up but you know

9804
02:36:15,830 --> 02:36:15,840
able to wake up but you know
 

9805
02:36:15,840 --> 02:36:17,429
able to wake up but you know
that's all that's a bad right that's the

9806
02:36:17,429 --> 02:36:17,439
that's all that's a bad right that's the
 

9807
02:36:17,439 --> 02:36:19,030
that's all that's a bad right that's the
last resort and then

9808
02:36:19,030 --> 02:36:19,040
last resort and then
 

9809
02:36:19,040 --> 02:36:21,910
last resort and then
the other interesting thing about um the

9810
02:36:21,910 --> 02:36:21,920
the other interesting thing about um the
 

9811
02:36:21,920 --> 02:36:22,230
the other interesting thing about um the
like

9812
02:36:22,230 --> 02:36:22,240
like
 

9813
02:36:22,240 --> 02:36:24,950
like
extreme uploading approach right is um

9814
02:36:24,950 --> 02:36:24,960
extreme uploading approach right is um
 

9815
02:36:24,960 --> 02:36:25,510
extreme uploading approach right is um
like

9816
02:36:25,510 --> 02:36:25,520
like
 

9817
02:36:25,520 --> 02:36:28,710
like
we're excited about space and one of the

9818
02:36:28,710 --> 02:36:28,720
we're excited about space and one of the
 

9819
02:36:28,720 --> 02:36:32,469
we're excited about space and one of the
points that uh a lot of science

9820
02:36:32,469 --> 02:36:32,479
points that uh a lot of science
 

9821
02:36:32,479 --> 02:36:34,309
points that uh a lot of science
or like hard science fiction types make

9822
02:36:34,309 --> 02:36:34,319
or like hard science fiction types make
 

9823
02:36:34,319 --> 02:36:35,510
or like hard science fiction types make
is that you know if you want to explore

9824
02:36:35,510 --> 02:36:35,520
is that you know if you want to explore
 

9825
02:36:35,520 --> 02:36:36,950
is that you know if you want to explore
space that's a lot easier if you're not

9826
02:36:36,950 --> 02:36:36,960
space that's a lot easier if you're not
 

9827
02:36:36,960 --> 02:36:37,510
space that's a lot easier if you're not
a human

9828
02:36:37,510 --> 02:36:37,520
a human
 

9829
02:36:37,520 --> 02:36:40,070
a human
right like one example of this is that

9830
02:36:40,070 --> 02:36:40,080
right like one example of this is that
 

9831
02:36:40,080 --> 02:36:40,710
right like one example of this is that
you know

9832
02:36:40,710 --> 02:36:40,720
you know
 

9833
02:36:40,720 --> 02:36:42,389
you know
in the context of humans we're talking

9834
02:36:42,389 --> 02:36:42,399
in the context of humans we're talking
 

9835
02:36:42,399 --> 02:36:43,510
in the context of humans we're talking
about like oh we're going to be able to

9836
02:36:43,510 --> 02:36:43,520
about like oh we're going to be able to
 

9837
02:36:43,520 --> 02:36:44,790
about like oh we're going to be able to
go to the moon oh we're going to be able

9838
02:36:44,790 --> 02:36:44,800
go to the moon oh we're going to be able
 

9839
02:36:44,800 --> 02:36:46,070
go to the moon oh we're going to be able
to go to mars

9840
02:36:46,070 --> 02:36:46,080
to go to mars
 

9841
02:36:46,080 --> 02:36:48,790
to go to mars
but there's this project called starshot

9842
02:36:48,790 --> 02:36:48,800
but there's this project called starshot
 

9843
02:36:48,800 --> 02:36:50,389
but there's this project called starshot
i believe right that's basically trying

9844
02:36:50,389 --> 02:36:50,399
i believe right that's basically trying
 

9845
02:36:50,399 --> 02:36:51,510
i believe right that's basically trying
to

9846
02:36:51,510 --> 02:36:51,520
to
 

9847
02:36:51,520 --> 02:36:54,070
to
send spacecraft to mini spacecrafts to

9848
02:36:54,070 --> 02:36:54,080
send spacecraft to mini spacecrafts to
 

9849
02:36:54,080 --> 02:36:55,110
send spacecraft to mini spacecrafts to
alpha centauri

9850
02:36:55,110 --> 02:36:55,120
alpha centauri
 

9851
02:36:55,120 --> 02:36:57,190
alpha centauri
and they literally believe that they're

9852
02:36:57,190 --> 02:36:57,200
and they literally believe that they're
 

9853
02:36:57,200 --> 02:36:59,190
and they literally believe that they're
going to be able to get spacecraft over

9854
02:36:59,190 --> 02:36:59,200
going to be able to get spacecraft over
 

9855
02:36:59,200 --> 02:37:00,630
going to be able to get spacecraft over
to alpha centauri like four light years

9856
02:37:00,630 --> 02:37:00,640
to alpha centauri like four light years
 

9857
02:37:00,640 --> 02:37:01,590
to alpha centauri like four light years
away by

9858
02:37:01,590 --> 02:37:01,600
away by
 

9859
02:37:01,600 --> 02:37:04,469
away by
like the 2060s no i mean by traveling

9860
02:37:04,469 --> 02:37:04,479
like the 2060s no i mean by traveling
 

9861
02:37:04,479 --> 02:37:05,830
like the 2060s no i mean by traveling
close to the speed of light yeah exactly

9862
02:37:05,830 --> 02:37:05,840
close to the speed of light yeah exactly
 

9863
02:37:05,840 --> 02:37:06,230
close to the speed of light yeah exactly
like

9864
02:37:06,230 --> 02:37:06,240
like
 

9865
02:37:06,240 --> 02:37:08,150
like
so based the way it works is you know

9866
02:37:08,150 --> 02:37:08,160
so based the way it works is you know
 

9867
02:37:08,160 --> 02:37:09,429
so based the way it works is you know
you have these light sails like you

9868
02:37:09,429 --> 02:37:09,439
you have these light sails like you
 

9869
02:37:09,439 --> 02:37:10,870
you have these light sails like you
basically take the as a spacecraft and

9870
02:37:10,870 --> 02:37:10,880
basically take the as a spacecraft and
 

9871
02:37:10,880 --> 02:37:12,150
basically take the as a spacecraft and
you shine a laser at it

9872
02:37:12,150 --> 02:37:12,160
you shine a laser at it
 

9873
02:37:12,160 --> 02:37:13,830
you shine a laser at it
and the laser is insanely strong and

9874
02:37:13,830 --> 02:37:13,840
and the laser is insanely strong and
 

9875
02:37:13,840 --> 02:37:15,270
and the laser is insanely strong and
quickly accelerated at

9876
02:37:15,270 --> 02:37:15,280
quickly accelerated at
 

9877
02:37:15,280 --> 02:37:18,630
quickly accelerated at
100 g's no i think it was 10 000 gs

9878
02:37:18,630 --> 02:37:18,640
100 g's no i think it was 10 000 gs
 

9879
02:37:18,640 --> 02:37:20,550
100 g's no i think it was 10 000 gs
um until it gets to 20 the speed of

9880
02:37:20,550 --> 02:37:20,560
um until it gets to 20 the speed of
 

9881
02:37:20,560 --> 02:37:21,830
um until it gets to 20 the speed of
light and then you know it goes on your

9882
02:37:21,830 --> 02:37:21,840
light and then you know it goes on your
 

9883
02:37:21,840 --> 02:37:22,550
light and then you know it goes on your
merry way

9884
02:37:22,550 --> 02:37:22,560
merry way
 

9885
02:37:22,560 --> 02:37:25,830
merry way
right so if you wants to be in

9886
02:37:25,830 --> 02:37:25,840
right so if you wants to be in
 

9887
02:37:25,840 --> 02:37:28,870
right so if you wants to be in
um like personally explore the alpha

9888
02:37:28,870 --> 02:37:28,880
um like personally explore the alpha
 

9889
02:37:28,880 --> 02:37:29,990
um like personally explore the alpha
centauri system

9890
02:37:29,990 --> 02:37:30,000
centauri system
 

9891
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,790
centauri system
within like two centuries or once or one

9892
02:37:32,790 --> 02:37:32,800
within like two centuries or once or one
 

9893
02:37:32,800 --> 02:37:33,510
within like two centuries or once or one
century

9894
02:37:33,510 --> 02:37:33,520
century
 

9895
02:37:33,520 --> 02:37:37,429
century
then you know being a robot is like

9896
02:37:37,429 --> 02:37:37,439
then you know being a robot is like
 

9897
02:37:37,439 --> 02:37:39,190
then you know being a robot is like
by far the most practical way to do it

9898
02:37:39,190 --> 02:37:39,200
by far the most practical way to do it
 

9899
02:37:39,200 --> 02:37:40,469
by far the most practical way to do it
because there's no way that a human

9900
02:37:40,469 --> 02:37:40,479
because there's no way that a human
 

9901
02:37:40,479 --> 02:37:42,389
because there's no way that a human
being can survive 10 000 years

9902
02:37:42,389 --> 02:37:42,399
being can survive 10 000 years
 

9903
02:37:42,399 --> 02:37:44,790
being can survive 10 000 years
so it's it's definitely interesting long

9904
02:37:44,790 --> 02:37:44,800
so it's it's definitely interesting long
 

9905
02:37:44,800 --> 02:37:46,469
so it's it's definitely interesting long
term but at the same time

9906
02:37:46,469 --> 02:37:46,479
term but at the same time
 

9907
02:37:46,479 --> 02:37:48,630
term but at the same time
like there's definitely a lot of like

9908
02:37:48,630 --> 02:37:48,640
like there's definitely a lot of like
 

9909
02:37:48,640 --> 02:37:51,030
like there's definitely a lot of like
psychological hang-ups and a lot of like

9910
02:37:51,030 --> 02:37:51,040
psychological hang-ups and a lot of like
 

9911
02:37:51,040 --> 02:37:53,429
psychological hang-ups and a lot of like
deep philosophy that we'll just have to

9912
02:37:53,429 --> 02:37:53,439
deep philosophy that we'll just have to
 

9913
02:37:53,439 --> 02:37:54,230
deep philosophy that we'll just have to
grapple with

9914
02:37:54,230 --> 02:37:54,240
grapple with
 

9915
02:37:54,240 --> 02:37:56,070
grapple with
well i think to get there i think what

9916
02:37:56,070 --> 02:37:56,080
well i think to get there i think what
 

9917
02:37:56,080 --> 02:37:57,429
well i think to get there i think what
it hangs on the

9918
02:37:57,429 --> 02:37:57,439
it hangs on the
 

9919
02:37:57,439 --> 02:37:58,950
it hangs on the
topic of whether we can convert

9920
02:37:58,950 --> 02:37:58,960
topic of whether we can convert
 

9921
02:37:58,960 --> 02:38:00,870
topic of whether we can convert
consciousness into an engineering

9922
02:38:00,870 --> 02:38:00,880
consciousness into an engineering
 

9923
02:38:00,880 --> 02:38:02,070
consciousness into an engineering
problem so like

9924
02:38:02,070 --> 02:38:02,080
problem so like
 

9925
02:38:02,080 --> 02:38:05,030
problem so like
is consciousness tied to our biology

9926
02:38:05,030 --> 02:38:05,040
is consciousness tied to our biology
 

9927
02:38:05,040 --> 02:38:06,309
is consciousness tied to our biology
because the moment we can

9928
02:38:06,309 --> 02:38:06,319
because the moment we can
 

9929
02:38:06,319 --> 02:38:08,550
because the moment we can
convert consciousness into a digital

9930
02:38:08,550 --> 02:38:08,560
convert consciousness into a digital
 

9931
02:38:08,560 --> 02:38:09,830
convert consciousness into a digital
form then we can

9932
02:38:09,830 --> 02:38:09,840
form then we can
 

9933
02:38:09,840 --> 02:38:12,230
form then we can
send it with that light sale to office

9934
02:38:12,230 --> 02:38:12,240
send it with that light sale to office
 

9935
02:38:12,240 --> 02:38:13,590
send it with that light sale to office
centauri until then

9936
02:38:13,590 --> 02:38:13,600
centauri until then
 

9937
02:38:13,600 --> 02:38:16,550
centauri until then
a robot is not carrying anything except

9957
02:38:32,240 --> 02:38:34,389
agree with that i'm definitely in the
camp that consciousness is

9958
02:38:34,389 --> 02:38:34,399
camp that consciousness is
 

9959
02:38:34,399 --> 02:38:36,150
camp that consciousness is
a property of the algorithm and not a

02:39:27,600 --> 02:39:28,469
the reason so many moments of experience
of

all those things are made delicious
 

10019
02:39:34,479 --> 02:39:35,270
all those things are made delicious
because they're

10020
02:39:35,270 --> 02:39:35,280
because they're
 

10021
02:39:35,280 --> 02:39:37,510
because they're
finite because they end and because we

10022
02:39:37,510 --> 02:39:37,520
finite because they end and because we
 

10023
02:39:37,520 --> 02:39:39,510
finite because they end and because we
don't have that many of them

10024
02:39:39,510 --> 02:39:39,520
don't have that many of them
 

10025
02:39:39,520 --> 02:39:41,830
don't have that many of them
and there's a kind of worry that if we

10026
02:39:41,830 --> 02:39:41,840
and there's a kind of worry that if we
 

10027
02:39:41,840 --> 02:39:43,670
and there's a kind of worry that if we
extend the human lifespan

10028
02:39:43,670 --> 02:39:43,680
extend the human lifespan
 

10029
02:39:43,680 --> 02:39:46,150
extend the human lifespan
if we achieve immortality or if we god

10030
02:39:46,150 --> 02:39:46,160
if we achieve immortality or if we god

self-improvement in general
 

10105
02:40:52,560 --> 02:40:54,550
self-improvement in general
and it turns out that you know you don't

10106
02:40:54,550 --> 02:40:54,560
and it turns out that you know you don't
 

10107
02:40:54,560 --> 02:40:56,230
and it turns out that you know you don't
actually need to have existential

10108
02:40:56,230 --> 02:40:56,240
actually need to have existential
 

10109
02:40:56,240 --> 02:40:57,830
actually need to have existential
conflicts in order to

10110
02:40:57,830 --> 02:40:57,840
conflicts in order to
 

10111
02:40:57,840 --> 02:40:59,349
conflicts in order to
in order to have that now maybe you need

10112
02:40:59,349 --> 02:40:59,359
in order to have that now maybe you need
 

10113
02:40:59,359 --> 02:41:00,630
in order to have that now maybe you need
conflict but we have other kinds of

10114
02:41:00,630 --> 02:41:00,640
conflict but we have other kinds of
 

10115
02:41:00,640 --> 02:41:02,150
conflict but we have other kinds of
conflicts right look we have you know

10116
02:41:02,150 --> 02:41:02,160
conflicts right look we have you know
 

10117
02:41:02,160 --> 02:41:03,590
conflicts right look we have you know
competition between businesses

10118
02:41:03,590 --> 02:41:03,600

10123
02:41:07,439 --> 02:41:10,389
competition between projects
and so you know these are like whatever

10124
02:41:10,389 --> 02:41:10,399
and so you know these are like whatever
 

10125
02:41:10,399 --> 02:41:10,710
and so you know these are like whatever
what

10126
02:41:10,710 --> 02:41:10,720
what
 

10127
02:41:10,720 --> 02:41:12,469
what
whatever the psychological needs are

10128

whatever the psychological needs are
 

10129
02:41:12,479 --> 02:41:14,550
whatever the psychological needs are
like they're just our substitutes for it

10130
02:41:14,550 --> 02:41:14,560
like they're just our substitutes for it
 

10131
02:41:14,560 --> 02:41:18,389
like they're just our substitutes for it
so i guess like yeah so if we uh

10132
02:41:18,389 --> 02:41:18,399
so i guess like yeah so if we uh
 

10133
02:41:18,399 --> 02:41:20,790
so i guess like yeah so if we uh
i'm trying to say i i feel like once we

10134
02:41:20,790 --> 02:41:20,800
i'm trying to say i i feel like once we
 

10135
02:41:20,800 --> 02:41:21,510
i'm trying to say i i feel like once we
start

10136
02:41:21,510 --> 02:41:21,520
start
 

10137
02:41:21,520 --> 02:41:25,110
start
living to to the age of uh 200 then

10138
02:41:25,110 --> 02:41:25,120
living to to the age of uh 200 then
 

10139
02:41:25,120 --> 02:41:27,190
living to to the age of uh 200 then
like i'm just intuitively expecting that

10140
02:41:27,190 --> 02:41:27,200
like i'm just intuitively expecting that
 

10141
02:41:27,200 --> 02:41:29,030
like i'm just intuitively expecting that
we'll see some like

10142
02:41:29,030 --> 02:41:29,040
we'll see some like
 

10143
02:41:29,040 --> 02:41:31,750
we'll see some like
substitutes emerge in the same way yeah

10144
02:41:31,750 --> 02:41:31,760
substitutes emerge in the same way yeah
 

10145
02:41:31,760 --> 02:41:32,230
substitutes emerge in the same way yeah
that

10146
02:41:32,230 --> 02:41:32,240
that
 

10147
02:41:32,240 --> 02:41:35,190
that
will will create conflicts of other

10148
02:41:35,190 --> 02:41:35,200
will will create conflicts of other
 

10149
02:41:35,200 --> 02:41:37,750
will will create conflicts of other
sorts that lead to less human suffering

10150
02:41:37,750 --> 02:41:37,760
sorts that lead to less human suffering
 

10151
02:41:37,760 --> 02:41:40,309

there's definitely benefits i think to
 

10355
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:37,269
there's definitely benefits i think to
be able to like

10380
02:46:04,150 --> 02:46:04,160

 

10381
02:46:04,160 --> 02:46:06,309

there's definitely like a richness that

10382
02:46:06,309 --> 02:46:06,319
there's definitely like a richness that
 

10383
02:46:06,319 --> 02:46:07,910
there's definitely like a richness that
you're missing if you're only

10384
02:46:07,910 --> 02:46:07,920
you're missing if you're only
 

10385
02:46:07,920 --> 02:46:10,550
you're missing if you're only
like in one of these language bubbles

10386
02:46:10,550 --> 02:46:10,560
like in one of these language bubbles
 

10387
02:46:10,560 --> 02:46:11,110
like in one of these language bubbles
but

10388
02:46:11,110 --> 02:46:11,120
but
 

10389
02:46:11,120 --> 02:46:13,510
but
you know i guess the arguments on the

10390
02:46:13,510 --> 02:46:13,520
you know i guess the arguments on the
 

10391
02:46:13,520 --> 02:46:15,030
you know i guess the arguments on the
other side would be that you know if

10392
02:46:15,030 --> 02:46:15,040
other side would be that you know if
 

10393
02:46:15,040 --> 02:46:16,710
other side would be that you know if
everyone spoke the same language then

10394
02:46:16,710 --> 02:46:16,720
everyone spoke the same language then
 

10395
02:46:16,720 --> 02:46:17,269
everyone spoke the same language then
like

10396
02:46:17,269 --> 02:46:17,279
like
 

10397
02:46:17,279 --> 02:46:19,190
like
there would just be one bubble right

10398
02:46:19,190 --> 02:46:19,200
there would just be one bubble right
 

10399
02:46:19,200 --> 02:46:22,389
there would just be one bubble right
this is the challenge i think like

10400
02:46:22,389 --> 02:46:22,399
this is the challenge i think like
 

10401
02:46:22,399 --> 02:46:24,710
this is the challenge i think like
there are actually benefits to having

10402
02:46:24,710 --> 02:46:24,720
there are actually benefits to having
 

10403
02:46:24,720 --> 02:46:26,230
there are actually benefits to having
cultural diversity and you definitely

10404
02:46:26,230 --> 02:46:26,240
cultural diversity and you definitely
 

10405
02:46:26,240 --> 02:46:27,910
cultural diversity and you definitely
don't want the entire world to be too

10406
02:46:27,910 --> 02:46:27,920
don't want the entire world to be too
 

10407
02:46:27,920 --> 02:46:28,790
don't want the entire world to be too
conformist

10408
02:46:28,790 --> 02:46:28,800
conformist
 

10409
02:46:28,800 --> 02:46:30,950
conformist
yeah and well one of the interesting

10410
02:46:30,950 --> 02:46:30,960
yeah and well one of the interesting
 

10411
02:46:30,960 --> 02:46:32,710
yeah and well one of the interesting
things about crypto is that it's just

10412
02:46:32,710 --> 02:46:32,720
things about crypto is that it's just
 

10413
02:46:32,720 --> 02:46:35,349
things about crypto is that it's just
a culture that actually like manages to

10414
02:46:35,349 --> 02:46:35,359
a culture that actually like manages to
 

10415
02:46:35,359 --> 02:46:36,150
a culture that actually like manages to
like

10416
02:46:36,150 --> 02:46:36,160
like
 

10417
02:46:36,160 --> 02:46:37,910
like
somehow you know have its uniqueness and

10418
02:46:37,910 --> 02:46:37,920
somehow you know have its uniqueness and
 

10419
02:46:37,920 --> 02:46:39,510
somehow you know have its uniqueness and
brazil and even preserve its

10420
02:46:39,510 --> 02:46:39,520
brazil and even preserve its
 

10421
02:46:39,520 --> 02:46:40,790
brazil and even preserve its
independence from

10422
02:46:40,790 --> 02:46:40,800
independence from
 

10423
02:46:40,800 --> 02:46:42,469
independence from
all of all of these surrounding

10424
02:46:42,469 --> 02:46:42,479
all of all of these surrounding
 

10425
02:46:42,479 --> 02:46:44,070
all of all of these surrounding
countries despite being embedded in all

10426
02:46:44,070 --> 02:46:44,080
countries despite being embedded in all
 

10427
02:46:44,080 --> 02:46:44,870
countries despite being embedded in all
of them

10428
02:46:44,870 --> 02:46:44,880
of them
 

10429
02:46:44,880 --> 02:46:47,750
of them
so it uh spans outside the geographical

10430
02:46:47,750 --> 02:46:47,760
so it uh spans outside the geographical
 

10431
02:46:47,760 --> 02:46:48,710
so it uh spans outside the geographical
boundaries

10432
02:46:48,710 --> 02:46:48,720
boundaries
 

10433
02:46:48,720 --> 02:46:50,950
boundaries
and language in some ways does as well

10434
02:46:50,950 --> 02:46:50,960
and language in some ways does as well
 

10435
02:46:50,960 --> 02:46:53,269
and language in some ways does as well
and then in the way these cultures

10436
02:46:53,269 --> 02:46:53,279
and then in the way these cultures
 

10437
02:46:53,279 --> 02:46:54,950
and then in the way these cultures
these bubbles are created i mean they

10438
02:46:54,950 --> 02:46:54,960
these bubbles are created i mean they
 

10439
02:46:54,960 --> 02:46:56,550
these bubbles are created i mean they
overlap in interesting ways it's almost

10440
02:46:56,550 --> 02:46:56,560
overlap in interesting ways it's almost
 

10441
02:46:56,560 --> 02:46:58,230
overlap in interesting ways it's almost
like a hierarchy and the same is the

10442
02:46:58,230 --> 02:46:58,240
like a hierarchy and the same is the
 

10443
02:46:58,240 --> 02:46:59,910
like a hierarchy and the same is the
case with the crypto world

10444
02:46:59,910 --> 02:46:59,920
case with the crypto world
 

10445
02:46:59,920 --> 02:47:01,830
case with the crypto world
there's uh you know there's communities

10446
02:47:01,830 --> 02:47:01,840
there's uh you know there's communities
 

10447
02:47:01,840 --> 02:47:03,349
there's uh you know there's communities
associated with these cryptocurrencies

10448
02:47:03,349 --> 02:47:03,359
associated with these cryptocurrencies
 

10449
02:47:03,359 --> 02:47:04,550
associated with these cryptocurrencies
there's communities within those

10450
02:47:04,550 --> 02:47:04,560
there's communities within those
 

10451
02:47:04,560 --> 02:47:05,750
there's communities within those
communities

10452
02:47:05,750 --> 02:47:05,760

derive meaning from the stuff i think
 

10595
02:49:26,080 --> 02:49:27,110
derive meaning from the stuff i think
that's uh

10596
02:49:27,110 --> 02:49:27,120
that's uh
 

10597
02:49:27,120 --> 02:49:29,750
that's uh
much more likely to be like a road to

10598
02:49:29,750 --> 02:49:29,760
much more likely to be like a road to
 

10599
02:49:29,760 --> 02:49:31,110
much more likely to be like a road to
like basically squandering that

10600
02:49:31,110 --> 02:49:31,120
like basically squandering that
 

10601
02:49:31,120 --> 02:49:32,230
like basically squandering that
opportunity

opportunity
 

10603
02:49:32,240 --> 02:49:34,870
opportunity
so yeah and i guess my philosophy is on

10604
02:49:34,870 --> 02:49:34,880
so yeah and i guess my philosophy is on
 

10605
02:49:34,880 --> 02:49:35,910
so yeah and i guess my philosophy is on
that is definitely

10606
02:49:35,910 --> 02:49:35,920
that is definitely
 

10607
02:49:35,920 --> 02:49:38,389
that is definitely
more subtractive than added over there

10608
02:49:38,389 --> 02:49:38,399
more subtractive than added over there
 

10609
02:49:38,399 --> 02:49:40,070
more subtractive than added over there
but once you have enough money that you

10932
02:54:58,950 --> 02:54:58,960
a lot of i guess the right kind of
 

10933
02:54:58,960 --> 02:55:00,950
a lot of i guess the right kind of
personal experience like especially if

10934
02:55:00,950 --> 02:55:00,960
personal experience like especially if
 

10935
02:55:00,960 --> 02:55:01,990
personal experience like especially if
your personal experience

10936
02:55:01,990 --> 02:55:02,000
your personal experience
 

10937
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:03,830
your personal experience
starts off being sheltered like it was

10938
02:55:03,830 --> 02:55:03,840
starts off being sheltered like it was
 

10939
02:55:03,840 --> 02:55:05,429
starts off being sheltered like it was
for me right like i you know this

10940
02:55:05,429 --> 02:55:05,439
for me right like i you know this
 

10941
02:55:05,439 --> 02:55:07,030
for me right like i you know this
i know the stereotype is that the nerds

10942
02:55:07,030 --> 02:55:07,040
i know the stereotype is that the nerds
 

10943
02:55:07,040 --> 02:55:08,710
i know the stereotype is that the nerds
get bullied in school but like actually

10944
02:55:08,710 --> 02:55:08,720
get bullied in school but like actually
 

10945
02:55:08,720 --> 02:55:09,349
get bullied in school but like actually
for me

10946
02:55:09,349 --> 02:55:09,359
for me
 

10947
02:55:09,359 --> 02:55:10,870
for me
in my school experience was just being

10948
02:55:10,870 --> 02:55:10,880
in my school experience was just being
 

10949
02:55:10,880 --> 02:55:12,790
in my school experience was just being
treated with kindness by everyone yeah

10950
02:55:12,790 --> 02:55:12,800
treated with kindness by everyone yeah
 

10951
02:55:12,800 --> 02:55:15,910
treated with kindness by everyone yeah
and so that definitely made it harder to

10952
02:55:15,910 --> 02:55:15,920
and so that definitely made it harder to
 

10953
02:55:15,920 --> 02:55:17,110
and so that definitely made it harder to
understand things

10954
02:55:17,110 --> 02:55:17,120
understand things
 

10955
02:55:17,120 --> 02:55:18,790
understand things
i remember actually being pretty

blindsided when i started ethereum and
 

10959
02:55:20,960 --> 02:55:21,349
blindsided when i started ethereum and
then

10960
02:55:21,349 --> 02:55:21,359
then
 

10961
02:55:21,359 --> 02:55:23,190
then
within six months there started being

10962
02:55:23,190 --> 02:55:23,200
within six months there started being
 

10963

shares if
 

10967
02:55:26,160 --> 02:55:27,750
shares if
ethereum turned out to be a company and

10968
02:55:27,750 --> 02:55:27,760
ethereum turned out to be a company and
 

10969
02:55:27,760 --> 02:55:29,590
ethereum turned out to be a company and
then i suggested we should just make it

10970
02:55:29,590 --> 02:55:29,600
then i suggested we should just make it
 

10971
02:55:29,600 --> 02:55:31,190
then i suggested we should just make it
be a non-profit and somehow that ended

10972
02:55:31,190 --> 02:55:31,200
be a non-profit and somehow that ended
 

10973
02:55:31,200 --> 02:55:32,469
be a non-profit and somehow that ended
up upsetting people

10974
02:55:32,469 --> 02:55:32,479
up upsetting people
 

10975
02:55:32,479 --> 02:55:36,630
up upsetting people

02:55:36,630 --> 02:55:36,640

 

10977
02:55:36,640 --> 02:55:38,469

so the fascinating thing for me is that

10978
02:55:38,469 --> 02:55:38,479
so the fascinating thing for me is that
 

10979
02:55:38,479 --> 02:55:39,910
so the fascinating thing for me is that
like i've been you know

10980

like i've been you know
obviously reading and listening to the

10982
02:55:41,590 --> 02:55:41,600
obviously reading and listening to the
 

10983
02:55:41,600 --> 02:55:43,190
obviously reading and listening to the
history and then at the same time just

10984
02:55:43,190 --> 02:55:43,200
history and then at the same time just
 

10985
02:55:43,200 --> 02:55:43,750
history and then at the same time just
like

10986
02:55:43,750 --> 02:55:43,760
like
 

10987
02:55:43,760 --> 02:55:45,910
like
observing things happening in the crypto

10988
02:55:45,910 --> 02:55:45,920
observing things happening in the crypto
 

10989
02:55:45,920 --> 02:55:46,870
observing things happening in the crypto
space

10990
02:55:46,870 --> 02:55:46,880
space
 

10991
02:55:46,880 --> 02:55:49,910
space
and so one of my interesting

10992
02:55:49,910 --> 02:55:49,920
and so one of my interesting
 

10993
02:55:49,920 --> 02:55:52,230
and so one of my interesting
um like mental intuitions that i've

10994
02:55:52,230 --> 02:55:52,240
um like mental intuitions that i've
 

10995
02:55:52,240 --> 02:55:54,230
um like mental intuitions that i've
gotten is that i think

10996
02:55:54,230 --> 02:55:54,240
gotten is that i think
 

10997
02:55:54,240 --> 02:55:56,790
gotten is that i think
like most evil doesn't come out of greed

10998
02:55:56,790 --> 02:55:56,800
like most evil doesn't come out of greed
 

10999
02:55:56,800 --> 02:55:58,710
like most evil doesn't come out of greed
it comes out of fear

11000
02:55:58,710 --> 02:55:58,720
it comes out of fear
 

11001
02:55:58,720 --> 02:56:01,910
it comes out of fear
and like one example

11002
02:56:01,910 --> 02:56:01,920
and like one example
 

11003
02:56:01,920 --> 02:56:05,429
and like one example
of this in ethereum lands right is um

11004
02:56:05,429 --> 02:56:05,439
of this in ethereum lands right is um
 

11005
02:56:05,439 --> 02:56:07,750
of this in ethereum lands right is um
like i think the part of ethereum

11006
02:56:07,750 --> 02:56:07,760
like i think the part of ethereum
 

11007
02:56:07,760 --> 02:56:08,950
like i think the part of ethereum
history where i thought that the

11008
02:56:08,950 --> 02:56:08,960
history where i thought that the
 

11009
02:56:08,960 --> 02:56:10,630
history where i thought that the
ethereum community was at its lowest and

11010
02:56:10,630 --> 02:56:10,640
ethereum community was at its lowest and
 

11011
02:56:10,640 --> 02:56:12,550
ethereum community was at its lowest and
even when i personally was at my lowest

11012
02:56:12,550 --> 02:56:12,560
even when i personally was at my lowest
 

11013
02:56:12,560 --> 02:56:15,269
even when i personally was at my lowest
and if you go back to the dow fork in

11014
02:56:15,269 --> 02:56:15,279
and if you go back to the dow fork in
 

11015
02:56:15,279 --> 02:56:16,389
and if you go back to the dow fork in
2016 right

11016
02:56:16,389 --> 02:56:16,399
2016 right
 

11017
02:56:16,399 --> 02:56:17,910
2016 right
so you know the dow hack happens and

11018
02:56:17,910 --> 02:56:17,920
so you know the dow hack happens and
 

11019
02:56:17,920 --> 02:56:19,429
so you know the dow hack happens and
then we made this controversial decision

11020
02:56:19,429 --> 02:56:19,439
then we made this controversial decision
 

11021
02:56:19,439 --> 02:56:21,429
then we made this controversial decision
to change the ethereum protocol

11022
02:56:21,429 --> 02:56:21,439
to change the ethereum protocol
 

11023
02:56:21,439 --> 02:56:25,510
to change the ethereum protocol
uh and we um

11024
02:56:25,510 --> 02:56:25,520
uh and we um
 

11025
02:56:25,520 --> 02:56:27,110
uh and we um
you know then there was that ethereum

11026
02:56:27,110 --> 02:56:27,120
you know then there was that ethereum
 

11027
02:56:27,120 --> 02:56:28,710
you know then there was that ethereum
classic split and

11028
02:56:28,710 --> 02:56:28,720
classic split and
 

11029
02:56:28,720 --> 02:56:31,269
classic split and
as soon as that ethereum classic split

11030
02:56:31,269 --> 02:56:31,279
as soon as that ethereum classic split
 

11031
02:56:31,279 --> 02:56:32,389
as soon as that ethereum classic split
um happened

11032
02:56:32,389 --> 02:56:32,399
um happened
 

11033
02:56:32,399 --> 02:56:34,309
um happened
you know there was like a lot of anger

11034
02:56:34,309 --> 02:56:34,319
you know there was like a lot of anger
 

11035
02:56:34,319 --> 02:56:35,510
you know there was like a lot of anger
everywhere and

11036
02:56:35,510 --> 02:56:35,520
everywhere and
 

11037
02:56:35,520 --> 02:56:37,590
everywhere and
there started there started especially

11038
02:56:37,590 --> 02:56:37,600
there started there started especially
 

11039
02:56:37,600 --> 02:56:38,790
there started there started especially
being anger when

11040
02:56:38,790 --> 02:56:38,800
being anger when
 

11041
02:56:38,800 --> 02:56:41,190
being anger when
the price of etc started like taking up

11042
02:56:41,190 --> 02:56:41,200
the price of etc started like taking up
 

11043
02:56:41,200 --> 02:56:43,269
the price of etc started like taking up
right so this was the time when

11044
02:56:43,269 --> 02:56:43,279
right so this was the time when
 

11045
02:56:43,279 --> 02:56:45,269
right so this was the time when
ether started off being 13 dollars and

11046
02:56:45,269 --> 02:56:45,279
ether started off being 13 dollars and
 

11047
02:56:45,279 --> 02:56:46,870
ether started off being 13 dollars and
then ethereum classic started at zero

11048
02:56:46,870 --> 02:56:46,880
then ethereum classic started at zero
 

11049
02:56:46,880 --> 02:56:47,510
then ethereum classic started at zero
but then

11050
02:56:47,510 --> 02:56:47,520
but then
 

11051
02:56:47,520 --> 02:56:49,030
but then
suddenly there was this one day when

11052
02:56:49,030 --> 02:56:49,040
suddenly there was this one day when
 

11053
02:56:49,040 --> 02:56:51,590
suddenly there was this one day when
like eath dropped to 12.5 etc went up to

11054
02:56:51,590 --> 02:56:51,600
like eath dropped to 12.5 etc went up to
 

11055
02:56:51,600 --> 02:56:53,269
like eath dropped to 12.5 etc went up to
0.5

11056
02:56:53,269 --> 02:56:53,279
0.5
 

11057
02:56:53,279 --> 02:56:55,590
0.5
and then they dropped more and people

11058
02:56:55,590 --> 02:56:55,600
and then they dropped more and people
 

11059
02:56:55,600 --> 02:56:57,110
and then they dropped more and people
were saying things like

11060
02:56:57,110 --> 02:56:57,120

classic is just as like a psyop by
 

11065
02:57:02,560 --> 02:57:04,150
classic is just as like a psyop by
you know the bitcoin community and just

11066
02:57:04,150 --> 02:57:04,160

the wealthy bitcoiners trying to destroy
ethereum

11070
02:57:06,870 --> 02:57:06,880
ethereum
 

11071
02:57:06,880 --> 02:57:09,269
ethereum
and like in the back of my mind i knew

11072
02:57:09,269 --> 02:57:09,279
and like in the back of my mind i knew
 

11073
02:57:09,279 --> 02:57:10,870
and like in the back of my mind i knew
that that wasn't entirely true

11074
02:57:10,870 --> 02:57:10,880
that that wasn't entirely true
 

11075
02:57:10,880 --> 02:57:11,910
that that wasn't entirely true
like there were definitely were

like there were definitely were
 

11077
02:57:11,920 --> 02:57:13,830
like there were definitely were
bitcoiners but at the same time like i

11078
02:57:13,830 --> 02:57:13,840
bitcoiners but at the same time like i
 

11079
02:57:13,840 --> 02:57:15,110
bitcoiners but at the same time like i
think

11080
02:57:15,110 --> 02:57:15,120

02:57:21,510 --> 02:57:21,520
interference right like this is the sort
 

11087
02:57:21,520 --> 02:57:22,790
interference right like this is the sort
of thing that you know like

countries governments do all the time
like it's

11092
02:57:26,550 --> 02:57:26,560
like it's
 

11093
02:57:26,560 --> 02:57:28,790
like it's
a very convenient excuse right because

11094
02:57:28,790 --> 02:57:28,800
a very convenient excuse right because
 

11095
02:57:28,800 --> 02:57:30,469
a very convenient excuse right because
it allows you to just like

11096
02:57:30,469 --> 02:57:30,479
it allows you to just like
 

11097
02:57:30,479 --> 02:57:31,990
it allows you to just like
blame these things that are happening on

11098
02:57:31,990 --> 02:57:32,000
blame these things that are happening on
 

11099
02:57:32,000 --> 02:57:33,590
blame these things that are happening on
the foreigners and

02:57:35,840 --> 02:57:37,349
avoid like actually grappling with the
facts that like well no actually you

11104
02:57:37,349 --> 02:57:37,359
facts that like well no actually you
 

11105
02:57:37,359 --> 02:57:38,950
facts that like well no actually you
have people in your very own community

11106
02:57:38,950 --> 02:57:38,960
have people in your very own community

belief and
i think you know i feel like the

11114
02:57:44,469 --> 02:57:44,479
i think you know i feel like the
 

11115
02:57:44,479 --> 02:57:46,550
i think you know i feel like the
ethereum community like during that time

11116
02:57:46,550 --> 02:57:46,560
ethereum community like during that time
 

11117
02:57:46,560 --> 02:57:48,550
ethereum community like during that time
did not do a very good job of grappling

11118
02:57:48,550 --> 02:57:48,560
did not do a very good job of grappling
 

11119
02:57:48,560 --> 02:57:49,910
did not do a very good job of grappling
with that and i feel like like i during

11120
02:57:49,910 --> 02:57:49,920
with that and i feel like like i during
 

11121
02:57:49,920 --> 02:57:50,630
with that and i feel like like i during
that time

11122
02:57:50,630 --> 02:57:50,640
that time
 

11123
02:57:50,640 --> 02:57:52,550
that time
did not do a very good job of grappling

11124
02:57:52,550 --> 02:57:52,560
did not do a very good job of grappling
 

11125
02:57:52,560 --> 02:57:53,670
did not do a very good job of grappling
