learned in physics that the ideas are
not sequential

172
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:53,200
not sequential
 

173
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,790
not sequential
and if we think that there's one idea

174
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:54,800
and if we think that there's one idea
 

175
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,390
and if we think that there's one idea
which is more important and we start

176
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:56,400
which is more important and we start
 

177
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,149
which is more important and we start
with there and go to the next idea and

178
00:02:58,149 --> 00:02:58,159
with there and go to the next idea and
 

179
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,670
with there and go to the next idea and
next one and deduce things from that

180
00:02:59,670 --> 00:02:59,680
next one and deduce things from that
 

181
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,430
next one and deduce things from that
like mathematicians do

182
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:01,440
like mathematicians do
 

183
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,110
like mathematicians do
we have learned that the like the third

184
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:03,120
we have learned that the like the third
 

185
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,630
we have learned that the like the third
or fourth thing we deduce from that

186
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:04,640
or fourth thing we deduce from that
 

187
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,790
or fourth thing we deduce from that
principle turns out later on to be the

188
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:06,800
principle turns out later on to be the
 

189
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,309
principle turns out later on to be the
actual principle

190
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:08,319
actual principle
 

191
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,869
actual principle
and from a different perspective

192
00:03:10,869 --> 00:03:10,879
and from a different perspective
 

193
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,630
and from a different perspective
starting from there leads to new ideas

194
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:12,640
starting from there leads to new ideas
 

195
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,790
starting from there leads to new ideas
which the original one didn't lead to

196
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:14,800
which the original one didn't lead to
 

197
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,229
which the original one didn't lead to
and that's the beginning of a new

198
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:16,239
and that's the beginning of a new
 

199
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,990
and that's the beginning of a new
revolution in science

200
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,000
revolution in science
 

201
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,750
revolution in science
so this kind of thing we have seen again

202
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:19,760
so this kind of thing we have seen again
 

203
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,110
so this kind of thing we have seen again
and again in the history of science we

204
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:21,120
and again in the history of science we
 

205
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,070
and again in the history of science we
have learned

206
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,080
have learned
 

207
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,229
have learned
to not like deductive reasoning because

208
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:24,239
to not like deductive reasoning because
 

209
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,830
to not like deductive reasoning because
that gives us a

210
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:25,840
that gives us a
 

211
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,910
that gives us a
bad starting point to think that we

212
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:27,920
bad starting point to think that we
 

213
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,589
bad starting point to think that we
actually have the original thought

214
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:29,599
actually have the original thought
 

215
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,229
actually have the original thought
process

216
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:30,239
process
 

217
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,149
process
should be viewed as the primary thought

218
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:32,159
should be viewed as the primary thought
 

219
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,830
should be viewed as the primary thought
and all these are deductions

220
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:33,840
and all these are deductions
 

221
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,350
and all these are deductions
like the way mathematicians sometimes

222
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:35,360
like the way mathematicians sometimes
 

223
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,350
like the way mathematicians sometimes
does so in physics we are learning to be

224
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:37,360
does so in physics we are learning to be
 

225
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,949
does so in physics we are learning to be
skeptical of that way of thinking we

226
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:38,959
skeptical of that way of thinking we
 

227
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,110
skeptical of that way of thinking we
have to be a bit open to the possibility

228
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:41,120
have to be a bit open to the possibility
 

229
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,190
have to be a bit open to the possibility
that what we thought is a deduction

230
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,200
that what we thought is a deduction
 

231
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,190
that what we thought is a deduction
of a hypothesis actually the reason

232
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,200
of a hypothesis actually the reason
 

233
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,229
of a hypothesis actually the reason
that's true

234
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:46,239
that's true
 

235
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,550
that's true
is the opposite and so we reverse the

236
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:48,560
is the opposite and so we reverse the
 

237
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,750
is the opposite and so we reverse the
order and so this

238
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:49,760
order and so this
 

239
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,509
order and so this
this switching back and forth between

240
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:51,519
this switching back and forth between
 

241
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,429
this switching back and forth between
ideas makes us

242
00:03:53,429 --> 00:03:53,439
ideas makes us
 

243
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,710
ideas makes us
more fluid about a deductive fashion of

244
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:56,720
more fluid about a deductive fashion of
 

245
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,350
more fluid about a deductive fashion of
course

246

course
 

247
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,350
course
it sometimes gives a wrong impression

248
00:03:59,350 --> 00:03:59,360
it sometimes gives a wrong impression
 

249
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,869
it sometimes gives a wrong impression
like physicists don't care about rigor

250
00:04:00,869 --> 00:04:00,879
like physicists don't care about rigor
 

251
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:01,429
like physicists don't care about rigor
they just

252
00:04:01,429 --> 00:04:01,439
they just
 

253
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,110
they just
you know they just say random things you

254
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,120
you know they just say random things you
 

255
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,949
you know they just say random things you
know they are willing to to say things

256
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:04,959
know they are willing to to say things
 

257
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,630
know they are willing to to say things
that are not backed by you know

258
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:06,640
that are not backed by you know
 

259
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,470
that are not backed by you know
the logical reasoning that's not true at

00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:08,480
the logical reasoning that's not true at
 

261
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,990
the logical reasoning that's not true at
all so

262
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:10,000
all so
 

263
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,030
all so
despite despite this fluidity in saying

264
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,040
despite despite this fluidity in saying
 

265
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,070
despite despite this fluidity in saying
which one is a primary

266
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:14,080
which one is a primary

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,550
which one is a primary
thought we are very careful about trying

268
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:16,560
thought we are very careful about trying
 

269
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,670
thought we are very careful about trying
to understand what we have really

270
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:17,680
to understand what we have really
 

271
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,550
to understand what we have really
understood

272
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:18,560
understood
 

273
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,110
understood
in terms of relationship between ideas

00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,120
in terms of relationship between ideas
 

275
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,749
in terms of relationship between ideas
so that's

276
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:21,759
so that's
 

277
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,350
so that's
that's the that's an important

278
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:23,360
that's the that's an important
 

279
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,189
that's the that's an important
ingredient and in fact

00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:25,199
ingredient and in fact
 

281
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,590

solid math being behind physics is i
think

284
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:28,320
think
 

285
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,270
think
uh one of the attractive features of a

uh one of the attractive features of a
 

287
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,189
uh one of the attractive features of a
of a physical law so we look for

288
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:33,199
of a physical law so we look for
 

289
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,590
of a physical law so we look for
beautiful math underpinning can we dig

290
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:35,600
beautiful math underpinning can we dig
 

291
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,550
beautiful math underpinning can we dig
into that process

292
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:36,560
into that process
 

293
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,550
into that process
of starting from one place and then the

294
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:40,560
of starting from one place and then the
 

295
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,110
of starting from one place and then the
uh ending up at like the fourth step and

296
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:43,120
uh ending up at like the fourth step and
 

297
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,230
uh ending up at like the fourth step and
realizing

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,990
realizing
all along that the place you started at

all along that the place you started at
 

301
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,350
all along that the place you started at
was wrong so

302
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:47,360
was wrong so
 

303
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,670
was wrong so
is that happen when there's a

00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:49,680
is that happen when there's a
 

305
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,749
is that happen when there's a
discrepancy between

discrepancy between
 

307
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,830
discrepancy between
what the math says and what the physical

is that how you then can go back and do
 

313
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,909
is that how you then can go back and do
the

00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:57,919
the
 

315
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,550
the
revolutionary idea for different

starting place altogether
 

319
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,150
starting place altogether
perhaps i'll give an example to see see

320
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,160
perhaps i'll give an example to see see
 

321
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,749
perhaps i'll give an example to see see
how it goes and in fact the historical

322
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:05,759
how it goes and in fact the historical
 

323
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:06,790
how it goes and in fact the historical
example

324
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:06,800
example
 

325
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,150
example
is newton's work on classical mechanics

326
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:10,160
is newton's work on classical mechanics
 

327
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,550
is newton's work on classical mechanics
so so newton formulated the laws of

328
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:12,560
so so newton formulated the laws of
 

329
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,510
so so newton formulated the laws of
mechanics

330
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:13,520
mechanics
 

331
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,230
mechanics
uh you know the force f equals to m a

332
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:16,240
uh you know the force f equals to m a
 

333
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:16,629
uh you know the force f equals to m a
and

334
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:16,639
and
 

335
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,870
and
his other laws and they look very simple

00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:18,880
his other laws and they look very simple
 

337
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,870
his other laws and they look very simple
elegant and so forth

00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:02,400
going from
 

381
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,029
going from
the initial point to the final point and

00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:05,039
the initial point to the final point and
 

383
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,150
the initial point to the final point and
you compute

384
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:06,160
you compute
 

385
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,790
you compute
the action on what is an action action

386
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:08,800
the action on what is an action action
 

387
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,629
the action on what is an action action
is the integral over time

388
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:10,639
is the integral over time
 

389
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,790
is the integral over time
of the kinetic term of the particle

390
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:12,800
of the kinetic term of the particle
 

391
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,870
of the kinetic term of the particle
minus its potential

392
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:14,880
minus its potential
 

393
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,749
minus its potential
so you take this integral and each path

394
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:17,759
so you take this integral and each path
 

395
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,430
so you take this integral and each path
will give you some quantity and

396
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:19,440
will give you some quantity and
 

397
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,309
will give you some quantity and
the path it actually takes the physical

398
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:22,319
the path it actually takes the physical
 

399
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:22,950
the path it actually takes the physical
path

400
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:22,960
path
 

401
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,950
path
is the one which minimizes this integral

402
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:24,960
is the one which minimizes this integral
 

403
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,469
is the one which minimizes this integral
or this action

404
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:26,479
or this action
 

405
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,110

413
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,790

when we use it as a tool to understand
the physical world

506
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:01,440
the physical world
 

507
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,749
the physical world
yes i would say that mathematics can

508
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:03,759
yes i would say that mathematics can
 

509
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,430
yes i would say that mathematics can
lead us astray as much as

510
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:05,440
lead us astray as much as
 

511
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,710
lead us astray as much as
all physical ideas can lead us so

512
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:08,720
all physical ideas can lead us so
 

513
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,589
all physical ideas can lead us so
sure if you get stuck in some something

514
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:11,599
sure if you get stuck in some something
 

515
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,430
sure if you get stuck in some something
then you can easily fool yourself that

516
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:13,440
then you can easily fool yourself that
 

517
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,629
then you can easily fool yourself that
just like

518
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:14,639
just like
 

519
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,990
just like
the thought process we have to free

520
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:16,000
the thought process we have to free
 

521
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,150
the thought process we have to free
ourselves of that sometimes math does

522
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:18,160
ourselves of that sometimes math does
 

523
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,670
ourselves of that sometimes math does
that rule like say oh this is such a

524
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:19,680
that rule like say oh this is such a
 

525
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,510
that rule like say oh this is such a
beautiful math i definitely want to use

526
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:21,520
beautiful math i definitely want to use
 

527
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,469
beautiful math i definitely want to use
it somewhere and so

528
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:22,479
it somewhere and so
 

529
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,150
it somewhere and so
you just get carried away and you just

530
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:24,160
you just get carried away and you just
 

531
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,150
you just get carried away and you just
get maybe carried too far away so that

532
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:26,160
get maybe carried too far away so that
 

533
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,070
get maybe carried too far away so that
is certainly true but i wouldn't say

534
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,080
is certainly true but i wouldn't say
 

535
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,749
is certainly true but i wouldn't say
it's more dangerous than all physical

536
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:29,759
it's more dangerous than all physical
 

537
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,270
it's more dangerous than all physical
ideas to me

538
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:31,280
ideas to me
 

539
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,310
ideas to me
new math ideas uh is as much potential

540
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:34,320
new math ideas uh is as much potential
 

541
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,310
new math ideas uh is as much potential
to lead us astray as all physical ideas

542
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:36,320
to lead us astray as all physical ideas
 

543
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,269
to lead us astray as all physical ideas
which could be

544
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:37,279
which could be
 

545
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,029
which could be
long-held principles of physics so i'm

546
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:39,039
long-held principles of physics so i'm
 

547
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,110
long-held principles of physics so i'm
just saying that we should keep an open

548
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:41,120
just saying that we should keep an open
 

549
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,829
just saying that we should keep an open
uh mind about the role the math plays

550
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:43,839
uh mind about the role the math plays
 

551
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,990
uh mind about the role the math plays
not to be antagonistic towards it

552
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:46,000
not to be antagonistic towards it
 

553
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,949
not to be antagonistic towards it
and not to over overwhelming it we

554
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:48,959
and not to over overwhelming it we
 

555
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,949
and not to over overwhelming it we
should just be open to possibilities

556
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:50,959
should just be open to possibilities
 

557
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,630
should just be open to possibilities
what about looking at a particular

558
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:52,640
what about looking at a particular
 

559
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,630
what about looking at a particular
characteristics of both physical ideas

560
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:54,640
characteristics of both physical ideas
 

561
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,710
characteristics of both physical ideas
and mathematical ideas which is beauty

562
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:56,720
and mathematical ideas which is beauty
 

563
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,190
and mathematical ideas which is beauty
you think beauty leads us astray meaning

564
00:08:59,190 --> 00:08:59,200
you think beauty leads us astray meaning
 

565
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,990
you think beauty leads us astray meaning
um

566
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,000
um
 

567
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,470
um
and and you offline showed me a a really

568
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:02,480
and and you offline showed me a a really
 

569
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,630
and and you offline showed me a a really
nice puzzle that illustrates this

570
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:04,640
nice puzzle that illustrates this
 

571
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,949
nice puzzle that illustrates this
this idea a little bit now maybe you can

572
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:06,959
this idea a little bit now maybe you can
 

573
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:07,990
this idea a little bit now maybe you can
speak to that or another

574
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,000
speak to that or another
 

575
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,750
speak to that or another
example where uh beauty

576
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:11,760
example where uh beauty
 

577
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,590
example where uh beauty
makes it tempting for us to assume that

578
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:13,600
makes it tempting for us to assume that
 

579
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,350
makes it tempting for us to assume that
the the law and the theory

580
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:15,360
the the law and the theory
 

581
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,990
the the law and the theory
we found is actually one that perfectly

582
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:18,000
we found is actually one that perfectly
 

583
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,590
we found is actually one that perfectly
describes reality

584
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:19,600
describes reality
 

585
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,070
describes reality
i think that beauty does not lead us

586
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:22,080
i think that beauty does not lead us
 

587
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,710
i think that beauty does not lead us
astray

588
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:22,720
astray
 

589
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,110
astray
because i feel that beauty is a

590
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,120
because i feel that beauty is a
 

591
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,910
because i feel that beauty is a
requirement

592
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:25,920
requirement
 

593
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,470
requirement
for principles of physics so beauty is a

594
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:28,480
for principles of physics so beauty is a
 

595
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,829
for principles of physics so beauty is a
fundamental in the universe i think

596
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:29,839
fundamental in the universe i think
 

597
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:30,870
fundamental in the universe i think
beauty is fundamental

598
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:30,880
beauty is fundamental
 

599
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,550
beauty is fundamental
at least that's the way many of us view

600
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:32,560
at least that's the way many of us view
 

601
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,910
at least that's the way many of us view
it it's not emergent

602
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:33,920
it it's not emergent
 

603
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,150
it it's not emergent
it's not immersion i think i think hardy

604
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,160
it's not immersion i think i think hardy
 

605
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,829
it's not immersion i think i think hardy
is the mathematician who said that

606
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:37,839
is the mathematician who said that
 

607
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:38,470
is the mathematician who said that
there's no

608
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:38,480
there's no
 

609
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,790
there's no
permanent place for ugly mathematics and

610
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:40,800
permanent place for ugly mathematics and
 

611
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,790
permanent place for ugly mathematics and
so i think the same is true in physics

612
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:42,800
so i think the same is true in physics
 

613
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,150
so i think the same is true in physics
that if we find a principle which looks

614
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,160
that if we find a principle which looks
 

615
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,670
that if we find a principle which looks
ugly

616
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:47,680
ugly
 

617
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,190
ugly
we're not going to be that's not the end

618
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:49,200
we're not going to be that's not the end
 

619
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,190
we're not going to be that's not the end
stage so therefore beauty is going to

620
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:51,200
stage so therefore beauty is going to
 

621
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,269
stage so therefore beauty is going to
lead us somewhere now it doesn't mean

622
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:53,279
lead us somewhere now it doesn't mean
 

623
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,710
lead us somewhere now it doesn't mean
beauty is enough

624
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:54,720
beauty is enough
 

625
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,389
beauty is enough
it doesn't mean if you just have beauty

626
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:56,399
it doesn't mean if you just have beauty
 

627
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,150
it doesn't mean if you just have beauty
if i just look at something is beautiful

628
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:58,160
if i just look at something is beautiful
 

629
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,070
if i just look at something is beautiful
then i'm fine no that's not the case

630
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,080
then i'm fine no that's not the case
 

631
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,470
then i'm fine no that's not the case
beauty is certainly a criteria that

632
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:02,480
beauty is certainly a criteria that
 

633
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,110
beauty is certainly a criteria that

every
good physical theory should pass that's

636
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:04,720
good physical theory should pass that's
 

637
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,470
good physical theory should pass that's
at least the view we have

638
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:06,480
at least the view we have
 

639
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,710
at least the view we have
why do we have this view that's a good

640
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:08,720
why do we have this view that's a good
 

641
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,670
why do we have this view that's a good
question

examples in the history of science to

look for beauty
 

669
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,750
look for beauty
and our sense of beauty seems to

00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:19,760
have underlying symmetry when you look
 

781
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,030
have underlying symmetry when you look
at it more deeply so

aesthetics that scientists have
 

795
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,030
aesthetics that scientists have
and we don't usually talk about it among

799
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,110
scientists
in fact it's kind of a philosophical

00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:39,120
in fact it's kind of a philosophical
 

801
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,829
in fact it's kind of a philosophical

why do we look for simplicity or beauty

think especially modern science seems to

view science
 

825
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,230
view science
owes a lot to philosophy and

826
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:02,240
owes a lot to philosophy and
 

827
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,870
owes a lot to philosophy and
in my view many scientists in fact

828
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:04,880
in my view many scientists in fact
 

829
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,710
in my view many scientists in fact
probably all good scientists are

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,670
they they may not
like to be labeled philosophers but in

838
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:13,680
like to be labeled philosophers but in
 

839
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,509
like to be labeled philosophers but in
many ways what they do is like what

840
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:15,519
many ways what they do is like what
 

841
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,629
many ways what they do is like what
is philosophical takes of things

842
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:18,639
is philosophical takes of things
 

843
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,470
is philosophical takes of things
looking for simplicity or symmetry is an

844
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:20,480
looking for simplicity or symmetry is an
 

845
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,990
looking for simplicity or symmetry is an
example of that in my opinion

846
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:22,000
example of that in my opinion
 

847
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,870
example of that in my opinion
or seeing patterns you see for example

848
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:24,880
or seeing patterns you see for example
 

849
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,069
or seeing patterns you see for example
another example of the

850
00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:26,079
another example of the
 

851
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,230
another example of the
symmetry is like how you come up with

852
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:28,240
symmetry is like how you come up with
 

853
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,310
symmetry is like how you come up with
new ideas in science you see for example

854
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:30,320
new ideas in science you see for example
 

855
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:30,550
new ideas in science you see for example
an

856
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:30,560
an
 

857
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,590
an
idea a is connected with an idea b

858
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:33,600
idea a is connected with an idea b
 

859
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,590
idea a is connected with an idea b
okay so you you study this connection

860
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:35,600
okay so you you study this connection
 

861
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,710
okay so you you study this connection
very deeply

862
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:36,720
very deeply
 

863
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,629
very deeply
and then you find the cousin of an idea

864
00:13:38,629 --> 00:13:38,639
and then you find the cousin of an idea
 

865
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,030
and then you find the cousin of an idea
a let me call it a prime

866
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:41,040
a let me call it a prime
 

867
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,509
a let me call it a prime
and then you immediately look for b

868
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:43,519
and then you immediately look for b
 

869
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:44,550
and then you immediately look for b
prime if a

870
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:44,560
prime if a
 

871
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,310
prime if a
is like b and if there's an a prime then

872
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:46,320
is like b and if there's an a prime then
 

873
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,710
is like b and if there's an a prime then
you look for b prime why well

874
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:48,720
you look for b prime why well
 

875
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,990
you look for b prime why well
it completes the picture why well it's

876
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:52,000
it completes the picture why well it's
 

877
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,590
it completes the picture why well it's
philosophically appealing to have more

878
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:53,600
philosophically appealing to have more
 

879
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,189
philosophically appealing to have more
balance in terms of that

880
00:13:55,189 --> 00:13:55,199
balance in terms of that
 

881
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,110
balance in terms of that
and then you look for b prime and behold

882
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:57,120
and then you look for b prime and behold
 

883
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,790
and then you look for b prime and behold
you find this other phenomena which is a

884
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:58,800
you find this other phenomena which is a
 

885
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,389
you find this other phenomena which is a
physical phenomenon which you call b

886
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:00,399
physical phenomenon which you call b
 

887
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,509
physical phenomenon which you call b
prime so this kind of thinking motivates

888
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:03,519
prime so this kind of thinking motivates
 

889
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,430
prime so this kind of thinking motivates
asking questions and looking for things

890
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:05,440
asking questions and looking for things
 

891
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,509
asking questions and looking for things
and it has guided scientists i think

892
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:07,519
and it has guided scientists i think
 

893
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,189
and it has guided scientists i think
through many centuries and i think it

894
00:14:09,189 --> 00:14:09,199
through many centuries and i think it
 

895
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,710
through many centuries and i think it
continues to do so today

896
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:10,720
continues to do so today
 

897
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,310
continues to do so today
and i think if you look at the long arc

898
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:12,320
and i think if you look at the long arc
 

899
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,629
and i think if you look at the long arc
of history i suspect that the things

900
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:14,639
of history i suspect that the things
 

901
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,389
of history i suspect that the things
that will be remembered

902
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:16,399
that will be remembered
 

903
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,990
that will be remembered
is the philosophical flavor of the ideas

904
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:20,000
is the philosophical flavor of the ideas
 

905
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,870
is the philosophical flavor of the ideas
of physics and chemistry and computer

906
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:22,880
of physics and chemistry and computer
 

907
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,470
of physics and chemistry and computer
science and mathematics

908
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:24,480
science and mathematics
 

909
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,269
science and mathematics
like i think the actual details

910
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:29,279
like i think the actual details
 

911
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,069
like i think the actual details
will be shown to be incomplete or maybe

912
00:14:32,069 --> 00:14:32,079
will be shown to be incomplete or maybe
 

913
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,110
will be shown to be incomplete or maybe
wrong

914
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:33,120
wrong
 

915
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,110
wrong
but the philosophical intuitions will

916
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:35,120
but the philosophical intuitions will
 

917
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,710
but the philosophical intuitions will
carry through much longer

918
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:36,720
carry through much longer
 

919
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,269
carry through much longer
there's a sense in which if it's true

920
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:39,279
there's a sense in which if it's true
 

921
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,949
there's a sense in which if it's true
that we haven't figured out

922
00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:40,959
that we haven't figured out
 

923
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,230
that we haven't figured out
most of how things work currently

924
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:44,240
most of how things work currently
 

925
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,710
most of how things work currently
that uh it'll all be shown as wrong and

926
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:46,720
that uh it'll all be shown as wrong and
 

927
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,350
that uh it'll all be shown as wrong and
silly it'd

928
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:47,360
silly it'd
 

929
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,710
silly it'd
almost be a historical artifact but the

930
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:50,720
almost be a historical artifact but the
 

931
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,590
almost be a historical artifact but the
the human spirit whatever like the the

932
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:53,600
the human spirit whatever like the the
 

933
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,509
the human spirit whatever like the the
longing to understand

934
00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:55,519
longing to understand
 

935
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,110
longing to understand
the the way we perceive the world the

936
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:57,120
the the way we perceive the world the
 

937
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,189
the the way we perceive the world the
way we conceive of it

938
00:14:59,189 --> 00:14:59,199
way we conceive of it
 

939
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,269
way we conceive of it
of our place in the world those those

940
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:01,279
of our place in the world those those
 

941
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,470
of our place in the world those those
ideas will carry on

942
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:02,480
ideas will carry on
 

943
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,069
ideas will carry on
i completely agree in fact i believe

944
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:04,079
i completely agree in fact i believe
 

945
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,509
i completely agree in fact i believe
that uh almost

946
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:05,519
that uh almost
 

947
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,590
that uh almost
well i believe that none of the

948
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:07,600
well i believe that none of the
 

949
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,430
well i believe that none of the
principles or laws of physics we know

950
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:09,440
principles or laws of physics we know
 

951
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,509
principles or laws of physics we know
today are exactly correct

952
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:11,519
today are exactly correct
 

953
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,189
today are exactly correct
all of them are approximations to

954
00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:13,199
all of them are approximations to
 

955
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,310
all of them are approximations to
something they are better than the

956
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:14,320
something they are better than the
 

957
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,150
something they are better than the
previous versions that we had but

958
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:16,160
previous versions that we had but
 

959
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,829
previous versions that we had but
none of them are exactly correct and

960
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:17,839
none of them are exactly correct and
 

961
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,829
none of them are exactly correct and
none of them are going to stand forever

962
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:19,839
none of them are going to stand forever
 

963
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,230
none of them are going to stand forever
so i agree that that's the process we

964
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:22,240
so i agree that that's the process we
 

965
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,069
so i agree that that's the process we
are heading we are improving

966
00:15:24,069 --> 00:15:24,079
are heading we are improving
 

967
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,470
are heading we are improving
and yes indeed the thought process and

968
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:26,480
and yes indeed the thought process and
 

969
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,230
and yes indeed the thought process and
that philosophical take

970
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:28,240
that philosophical take
 

971
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,470
that philosophical take
is common so when we look at you know

972
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:30,480
is common so when we look at you know
 

973
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,710
is common so when we look at you know
older uh

974
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:32,720
older uh
 

975
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,550
older uh
scientists or maybe even all the way

976
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:34,560
scientists or maybe even all the way
 

977
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,230
scientists or maybe even all the way
back to greek philosophers and the

978
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:36,240
back to greek philosophers and the
 

979
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,670
back to greek philosophers and the
things that the way they thought and so

980
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:37,680
things that the way they thought and so
 

981
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,310
things that the way they thought and so
on

982
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:38,320
on
 

983
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,910
on
almost everything they said about you

984
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:39,920
almost everything they said about you
 

985
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,069
almost everything they said about you
know nature was incorrect

986
00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:42,079
know nature was incorrect
 

987
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,910
know nature was incorrect
but the way they thought about it and

988
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:43,920
but the way they thought about it and
 

989
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,749
but the way they thought about it and
many things that they were thinking

990
00:15:45,749 --> 00:15:45,759
many things that they were thinking
 

991
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,670
many things that they were thinking
is still valid today for example they

992
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:47,680
is still valid today for example they
 

993
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,910
is still valid today for example they
thought about symmetry breaking

994
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:49,920
thought about symmetry breaking
 

995
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,189
thought about symmetry breaking
they were trying to explain the

996
00:15:51,189 --> 00:15:51,199
they were trying to explain the
 

997
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,629
they were trying to explain the
following they were this is a beautiful

998
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:52,639
following they were this is a beautiful
 

999
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,310
following they were this is a beautiful
example i think they had figured out

1000
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:54,320
example i think they had figured out
 

1001
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,749
example i think they had figured out
that the earth is round

1002
00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:55,759
that the earth is round
 

1003
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,430
that the earth is round
and they said okay earth is around they

1004
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:57,440
and they said okay earth is around they
 

1005
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,870
and they said okay earth is around they
have you know they have seen the

1006
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:58,880
have you know they have seen the
 

1007
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,189
have you know they have seen the
length of the shadow of this meter stick

1008
00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:01,199
length of the shadow of this meter stick
 

1009
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,629
length of the shadow of this meter stick
and they have seen that if you go from

1010
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:02,639
and they have seen that if you go from
 

1011
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,389
and they have seen that if you go from
the equator upwards north

1012
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:04,399
the equator upwards north
 

1013
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,069
the equator upwards north
they find that depending on how far away

1014
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:06,079
they find that depending on how far away
 

1015
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,749
they find that depending on how far away
you are the length of the shadow changes

1016
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:07,759
you are the length of the shadow changes
 

1017
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,189
you are the length of the shadow changes
and from that they have either they had

1018
00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:09,199
and from that they have either they had
 

1019
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,030
and from that they have either they had
even measured the radius of the earth

1020
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,040
even measured the radius of the earth
 

1021
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,110
even measured the radius of the earth
to good accuracy that's brilliant by the

1022
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:13,120
to good accuracy that's brilliant by the
 

1023
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,470
to good accuracy that's brilliant by the
way the fact that they did that

1024
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:14,480
way the fact that they did that
 

1025
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,910
way the fact that they did that
very brilliant very brilliant so these

1026
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:15,920
very brilliant very brilliant so these
 

1027
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,829
very brilliant very brilliant so these
greek philosophers were very smart and

1028
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:17,839
greek philosophers were very smart and
 

1029
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:18,790
greek philosophers were very smart and
so

1030
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:18,800
so
 

1031
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,710
so
they had taken it to the next step they

1032
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:20,720
they had taken it to the next step they
 

1033
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,949
they had taken it to the next step they
asked okay so the earth is round

1034
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:22,959
asked okay so the earth is round
 

1035
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,590
asked okay so the earth is round
why doesn't it move they thought it

1036
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:25,600
why doesn't it move they thought it
 

1037
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,269
why doesn't it move they thought it
doesn't move they they were looking

1038
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:27,279
doesn't move they they were looking
 

1039
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,110
doesn't move they they were looking
around nothing seemed to move so

1040
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:29,120
around nothing seemed to move so
 

1041
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,710
around nothing seemed to move so
so they said okay we have to have a good

1042
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:30,720
so they said okay we have to have a good
 

1043
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,550
so they said okay we have to have a good
explanation it wasn't enough for them to

1044
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:32,560
explanation it wasn't enough for them to
 

1045
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,990
explanation it wasn't enough for them to
you know be there so they really want to

1046
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:34,000
you know be there so they really want to
 

1047
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,230
you know be there so they really want to
deeply understand that fact and they

1048
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:36,240
deeply understand that fact and they
 

1049
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,550
deeply understand that fact and they
come up with a symmetry argument

1050
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:38,560
come up with a symmetry argument
 

1051
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,269
come up with a symmetry argument
and the symmetry argument was oh if the

1052
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:41,279
and the symmetry argument was oh if the
 

1053
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,550
and the symmetry argument was oh if the
earth

1054
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:42,560
earth
 

1055
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,310
earth
is a spherical it must be at the center

1056
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:44,320
is a spherical it must be at the center
 

1057
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,910
is a spherical it must be at the center
of the universe for sure so they said

1058
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:45,920
of the universe for sure so they said
 

1059
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,949
of the universe for sure so they said
the earth is at the center of the

1060
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:46,959
the earth is at the center of the
 

1061
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,069
the earth is at the center of the
universe it makes sense

1062
00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:48,079
universe it makes sense
 

1063
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:49,509
universe it makes sense
and they said you know if the earth is

1064
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:49,519
and they said you know if the earth is
 

1065
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,509
and they said you know if the earth is
going to move which direction does it

1066
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:51,519
going to move which direction does it
 

1067
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,069
going to move which direction does it
pick

1068
00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:52,079
pick
 

1069
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,910
pick
any direction it picks it breaks that

1070
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:53,920
any direction it picks it breaks that
 

1071
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,269
any direction it picks it breaks that
spherical symmetry because you have to

1072
00:16:55,269 --> 00:16:55,279
spherical symmetry because you have to
 

1073
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,949
spherical symmetry because you have to
pick a direction

1074
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:56,959
pick a direction
 

1075
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,389
pick a direction
and that's not good because it's not

1076
00:16:58,389 --> 00:16:58,399
and that's not good because it's not
 

1077
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,069
and that's not good because it's not
symmetrical anymore so therefore

1078
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:00,079
symmetrical anymore so therefore
 

1079
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,310
symmetrical anymore so therefore
the earth decides to sit put because it

1080
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:02,320
the earth decides to sit put because it
 

1081
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,309
the earth decides to sit put because it
would break the symmetry so

1082
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:04,319
would break the symmetry so
 

1083
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,750
would break the symmetry so
so they had the incorrect science they

1084
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:05,760
so they had the incorrect science they
 

1085
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,270
so they had the incorrect science they
thought earth doesn't move and they but

1086
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:07,280
thought earth doesn't move and they but
 

1087
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,710
thought earth doesn't move and they but
they had this beautiful idea that

1088
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:08,720
they had this beautiful idea that
 

1089
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,029
they had this beautiful idea that
symmetry might explain it

1090
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:11,039
symmetry might explain it
 

1091
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,549
symmetry might explain it
but they were even smarter than that

1092
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:12,559
but they were even smarter than that
 

1093
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,990
but they were even smarter than that
aristotle didn't agree with this

1094
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:14,000
aristotle didn't agree with this
 

1095
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,829
aristotle didn't agree with this
argument

1096
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:15,839
argument
 

1097
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,270
argument
he said why do you think symmetry

1098
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:17,280
he said why do you think symmetry
 

1099
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,710
he said why do you think symmetry
prevents it from moving because the

1100
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:18,720
prevents it from moving because the
 

1101
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,829
prevents it from moving because the

are you going to do that just because of

00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:40,480
are you going to do that just because of
 

1123
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,190
are you going to do that just because of
the symmetric point

despite the fact that it breaks the
 

1133
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,789
despite the fact that it breaks the
symmetry so from this way he tried to

symmetry so from this way he tried to
 

1135
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:51,270
symmetry so from this way he tried to
argue

1136
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:51,280
argue

used today to describe many physical
 

1147
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,470
used today to describe many physical
phenomena so spontaneous symmetry

1148
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:02,480
phenomena so spontaneous symmetry

is the feature that we now use but this

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,029
is the feature that we now use but this

idea was there
 

1155
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,630

thousands of years ago but applied

now we are using it so these ideas are

so i agree very much that the thought

1164
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:16,880
so i agree very much that the thought
 

1165
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,710
so i agree very much that the thought
process is more important and these

1166
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:18,720
process is more important and these
 

1167
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,230
process is more important and these
ideas are more interesting than the

1168
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:20,240
ideas are more interesting than the
 

1169
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,750
ideas are more interesting than the
actual applications that

1170
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:21,760
actual applications that
 

1171
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,590
actual applications that
people may find today did they use the

1172
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:23,600
people may find today did they use the
 

1173
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,350
people may find today did they use the
language of symmetry and the symmetry

1174
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:25,360
language of symmetry and the symmetry
 

1175
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,950
language of symmetry and the symmetry
breaking and spontaneous symmetry that's

1176
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:26,960
breaking and spontaneous symmetry that's
 

1177
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,070
breaking and spontaneous symmetry that's
really interesting yes

1178
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:28,080
really interesting yes
 

1179
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,830
really interesting yes
because like i could see a conception of

1180
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:31,840
because like i could see a conception of
 

1181
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,070
because like i could see a conception of
the universe that kind of tends towards

1182
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:34,080
the universe that kind of tends towards
 

1183
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,029
the universe that kind of tends towards
perfect symmetry and is stuck there like

1184
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:37,039
perfect symmetry and is stuck there like
 

1185
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:37,669
perfect symmetry and is stuck there like
they

1186
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:37,679
they
 

1187
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,150
they
not stuck there but achieves that

1188
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:40,160
not stuck there but achieves that
 

1189
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,990
not stuck there but achieves that
optimal and stays there

1190
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:42,000
optimal and stays there
 

1191
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,750
optimal and stays there
the idea that you would spontaneously

1192
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:43,760
the idea that you would spontaneously
 

1193
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,750
the idea that you would spontaneously
break out of symmetry

1194
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:45,760
break out of symmetry
 

1195
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,549
break out of symmetry
like have these perturbations like jump

1196
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:48,559
like have these perturbations like jump
 

1197
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:49,590
like have these perturbations like jump
out of symmetry

1198
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:49,600
out of symmetry
 

1199
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,070
out of symmetry
and back that's not that's a really

1200
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:52,080
and back that's not that's a really
 

1201
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,590
and back that's not that's a really
difficult idea to uh

1202
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:53,600
difficult idea to uh
 

1203
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,230
difficult idea to uh
to load into your head like where where

1204
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:56,240
to load into your head like where where
 

1205
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,430
to load into your head like where where
does that come from

1206
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:57,440
does that come from
 

1207
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,430
does that come from
and then and then the idea that you may

1208
00:18:59,430 --> 00:18:59,440
and then and then the idea that you may
 

1209
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,390
and then and then the idea that you may
not be at the center of the universe

1210
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:02,400
not be at the center of the universe
 

1211
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,110
not be at the center of the universe
right that is a really tough idea right

1212
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:05,120
right that is a really tough idea right
 

1213
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,270
right that is a really tough idea right
so symmetry sometimes is an explanation

1214
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:07,280
so symmetry sometimes is an explanation
 

1215
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,870
so symmetry sometimes is an explanation
of being at the symmetric point is

1216
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:08,880
of being at the symmetric point is
 

1217
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,630
of being at the symmetric point is
sometimes a simple explanation of many

1218
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:10,640
sometimes a simple explanation of many
 

1219
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,270
sometimes a simple explanation of many
things like

1220
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:11,280
things like
 

1221
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,549
things like
if you have a bowl a

1222
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:14,559
if you have a bowl a
 

1223
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,430
if you have a bowl a
circular ball then the bottom of it is

1224
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:17,440
circular ball then the bottom of it is
 

1225
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,789
circular ball then the bottom of it is
the lowest point so if you put a you

1226
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:18,799
the lowest point so if you put a you
 

1227
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,230
the lowest point so if you put a you
know pebble or something it will slide

1228
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:20,240
know pebble or something it will slide
 

1229
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,590
know pebble or something it will slide
down and go there at the bottom and

1230
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:21,600
down and go there at the bottom and
 

1231
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,310
down and go there at the bottom and
stays there

1232
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:22,320
stays there
 

1233
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,990
stays there
at the symmetric point because the

1234
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,000
at the symmetric point because the
 

1235
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,230
at the symmetric point because the
preferred point the lowest energy point

1236
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:26,240
preferred point the lowest energy point
 

1237
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,630
preferred point the lowest energy point
but if that same symmetric circular ball

1238
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:28,640
but if that same symmetric circular ball
 

1239
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,990
but if that same symmetric circular ball
that you had had a

1240
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:30,000
that you had had a
 

1241
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,029
that you had had a
bump on the on the bottom the bottom

1242
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:33,039
bump on the on the bottom the bottom
 

1243
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,310
bump on the on the bottom the bottom
might not be at the center

1244
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:34,320
might not be at the center
 

1245
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,230
might not be at the center
it might be on a circle on the table

1246
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:36,240
it might be on a circle on the table
 

1247
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,310
it might be on a circle on the table
yeah in which case the pebble would not

1248
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:38,320
yeah in which case the pebble would not
 

1249
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,150
yeah in which case the pebble would not
end up at the center would be the lower

1250
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:40,160
end up at the center would be the lower
 

1251
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,789
end up at the center would be the lower
energy point

1252
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:40,799
energy point
 

1253
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,870
energy point
symmetrical but it breaks the symmetry

1254
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:42,880
symmetrical but it breaks the symmetry
 

1255
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,190
symmetrical but it breaks the symmetry
once it picks a point on that circle

1256
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:45,200
once it picks a point on that circle
 

1257
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,750
once it picks a point on that circle
so so we can't have symmetry reasoning

1258
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:47,760
so so we can't have symmetry reasoning
 

1259
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,870
so so we can't have symmetry reasoning
for where things end up

1260
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:48,880
for where things end up
 

1261
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,350
for where things end up
or symmetry breakings like this example

1262
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:51,360
or symmetry breakings like this example
 

1263
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,630
or symmetry breakings like this example
would suggest

1264
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:52,640
would suggest

so maxwell put put the discoveries all
 

1519
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,590
so maxwell put put the discoveries all
together in the context of what we call

him it was inconsistent the equations
 

1551
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,789
him it was inconsistent the equations
you were writing the two equations he

1552
00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:40,799
you were writing the two equations he
 

1553
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,310
you were writing the two equations he
had written down did not agree with each

1554

other
 

1557
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,950
other
and this bothered him but he figured out

1558
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:44,960
and this bothered him but he figured out
 

1559
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,789
and this bothered him but he figured out
you know if you add this jiggle this

1560
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:46,799
you know if you add this jiggle this
 

1561
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,870
you know if you add this jiggle this
equation by adding one little term there

it works

1564
00:24:49,909 --> 00:24:49,919
it works
 

1565
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,830
it works
at least it's consistent what is the

1566
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:51,840
at least it's consistent what is the
 

1567
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,269
at least it's consistent what is the
motivation for that term

1568

he said i don't know have we seen it in

1570
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:55,200
he said i don't know have we seen it in

why did you add it well because of

1574
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:58,480
why did you add it well because of
 

1575
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,390
why did you add it well because of
mathematical consistency so he said

1576
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:00,400
mathematical consistency so he said
 

1577
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,590
mathematical consistency so he said
okay math forced him to

1578
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:03,600
okay math forced him to
 

1579
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,669
okay math forced him to
do this term he added this term which we

1580
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:05,679
do this term he added this term which we
 

1581
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,149
do this term he added this term which we
now today call the maxwell term

1582
00:25:08,149 --> 00:25:08,159
now today call the maxwell term
 

1583
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,990
now today call the maxwell term
and once he added that term his

1584
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:10,000
and once he added that term his
 

1585
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,269
and once he added that term his
equations were nice you know

1586
00:25:11,269 --> 00:25:11,279
equations were nice you know
 

1587
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,950

00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,430
moving through space
at a speed that he could calculate so he

1604
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:27,440
at a speed that he could calculate so he
 

1605
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,430
at a speed that he could calculate so he
calculated the speed of the wave

1606
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:29,440
calculated the speed of the wave
 

1607
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,870
calculated the speed of the wave
and low and behold he found it's the

1608
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:30,880
and low and behold he found it's the
 

1609
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,549
and low and behold he found it's the
same as the speed of light

same as the speed of light
 

1611

but then he was courageous enough to say
 

1619
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,350
but then he was courageous enough to say
well maybe light is nothing but these

00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:19,600
we get one speed light who measures this
 

1655
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:19,990
we get one speed light who measures this
light

1656
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:20,000

1657
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,630
light
speed and he asks the question are you

1658
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:22,640
speed and he asks the question are you
 

1659
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,470
speed and he asks the question are you
are you moving are you not moving if you

1660
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:24,480
are you moving are you not moving if you
 

1661
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,230
are you moving are you not moving if you
move the speed of light changes but

1662
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:26,240
move the speed of light changes but
 

1663
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,230
move the speed of light changes but
maxwell's equation has no hint of

1664
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:28,240
maxwell's equation has no hint of
 

1665
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,830
maxwell's equation has no hint of
different speeds of light it doesn't say

1666
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:29,840
different speeds of light it doesn't say
 

1667
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,390
different speeds of light it doesn't say
oh

1668
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:30,400
oh
 

1669
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,070
oh
only if you're not moving you get the

1670
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:32,080
only if you're not moving you get the
 

1671
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,269
only if you're not moving you get the
speed it's just you always get this

1672
00:26:33,269 --> 00:26:33,279
speed it's just you always get this
 

1673
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,230
speed it's just you always get this
speed so

1674
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:34,240
speed so
 

1675
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,549
speed so
einstein was very puzzled and he he was

00:26:36,549 --> 00:26:36,559
einstein was very puzzled and he he was
 

1677
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,470
einstein was very puzzled and he he was
daring enough to say well you know maybe

1678
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:38,480
daring enough to say well you know maybe

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,310
daring enough to say well you know maybe
everybody gets the same speed for light

1680
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:40,320
everybody gets the same speed for light

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,549
everybody gets the same speed for light
yeah and that motivated his theory of

1682
00:26:42,549 --> 00:26:42,559
yeah and that motivated his theory of
 

1683
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,230
yeah and that motivated his theory of
special relativity

1684
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:44,240
special relativity
 

1685
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,669
special relativity
and this is an interesting example

1686
00:26:45,669 --> 00:26:45,679
and this is an interesting example
 

1687
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,269
and this is an interesting example
because the idea was motivated from

1688
00:26:47,269 --> 00:26:47,279
because the idea was motivated from
 

1689
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,310
because the idea was motivated from

1693
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,950

00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:52,960
people tried to
 

1695
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,549
people tried to
try to measure the properties of ether

1696
00:26:56,549 --> 00:26:56,559
try to measure the properties of ether
 

1697
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,789
try to measure the properties of ether
which was supposed to be the medium in

1698
00:26:58,789 --> 00:26:58,799
which was supposed to be the medium in
 

1699
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,630
which was supposed to be the medium in
which the light travels through

1700
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:00,640
which the light travels through
 

1701
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,190
which the light travels through
and the idea was that only in that in

1702
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:03,200
and the idea was that only in that in
 

1703
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,029
and the idea was that only in that in
that medium the speed the speed of

1704
00:27:05,029 --> 00:27:05,039
that medium the speed the speed of
 

1705
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,710
that medium the speed the speed of
if you're at rest with respect to the

1707
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,549
if you're at rest with respect to the
ether this speed the speed of light then

1708
00:27:08,549 --> 00:27:08,559
ether this speed the speed of light then
 

1709
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,310
ether this speed the speed of light then
if you're moving the speed changes

1710
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:10,320
if you're moving the speed changes
 

1711
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,830
if you're moving the speed changes
and people did not discover it

1712
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:11,840
and people did not discover it
 

1713
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,269

michaelson and morley's experiments

1714
00:27:13,269 --> 00:27:13,279
michaelson and morley's experiments
 

1715
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,029
michaelson and morley's experiments
showed there is no ether

1716
00:27:15,029 --> 00:27:15,039
showed there is no ether
 

1717
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,110
showed there is no ether
so uh then einstein was courageous

1718
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:17,120
so uh then einstein was courageous
 

1719
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,389
so uh then einstein was courageous

00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,149
and part of it is because we live in a
situation where we don't go with very

1816
00:28:48,149 --> 00:28:48,159
situation where we don't go with very
 

1817
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,389
situation where we don't go with very
high speeds that our speeds are small

1818
00:28:50,389 --> 00:28:50,399
high speeds that our speeds are small
 

1819
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:51,830
high speeds that our speeds are small
compared to the speed of light

1820
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:51,840
compared to the speed of light
 

1821
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,230
compared to the speed of light
and therefore the phenomena we we

1822
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:54,240
and therefore the phenomena we we
 

1823
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,750
and therefore the phenomena we we
observe does not distinguish the

1824
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:55,760
observe does not distinguish the
 

1825
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,269
observe does not distinguish the
relativity of time

1826
00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:57,279
relativity of time
 

1827
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,950
relativity of time
the time also depends on who measures

1828
00:28:58,950 --> 00:28:58,960
the time also depends on who measures
 

1829
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,630
the time also depends on who measures
that there's no absolute time

1830
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:00,640
that there's no absolute time
 

1831
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,870
that there's no absolute time
when you say it's noon today now it

1832
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:02,880
when you say it's noon today now it
 

1833
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,870
when you say it's noon today now it
depends on who's measuring it and it

1834
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:04,880
depends on who's measuring it and it
 

1835
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,470
depends on who's measuring it and it
not everybody would agree with that

1836
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:06,480
not everybody would agree with that
 

1837
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,389
not everybody would agree with that
statement and to see that

1838
00:29:08,389 --> 00:29:08,399
statement and to see that
 

1839
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,470
statement and to see that
you will have to have fast observer

1840
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:10,480
you will have to have fast observer
 

1841
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,430
you will have to have fast observer
moving you know

1842
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:11,440
moving you know
 

1843
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,430
moving you know
speeds close to speed of light so so

1844
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:13,440
speeds close to speed of light so so
 

1845
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,190
speeds close to speed of light so so
this shows that our intuition is at

1846
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:15,200
this shows that our intuition is at
 

1847
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:15,750
this shows that our intuition is at
fault

1848
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:15,760
fault
 

1849
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,269
fault
and a lot of the discoveries in physics

1850
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:19,279
and a lot of the discoveries in physics
 

1851
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,630
and a lot of the discoveries in physics
precisely is getting rid of the wrong

1852
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:22,640
precisely is getting rid of the wrong
 

1853
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,590
precisely is getting rid of the wrong
old intuition

1854
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:23,600
old intuition
 

1855
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,909
old intuition
and it is funny because we get rid of it

1856
00:29:25,909 --> 00:29:25,919
and it is funny because we get rid of it
 

1857
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,149
and it is funny because we get rid of it
but it always lingers in us in some form

1858
00:29:28,149 --> 00:29:28,159
but it always lingers in us in some form
 

1859
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:28,549
but it always lingers in us in some form
like

1860
00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:28,559
like
 

1861
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,549
like
even when i'm describing it i feel like

1862
00:29:30,549 --> 00:29:30,559
even when i'm describing it i feel like
 

1863
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:31,990
even when i'm describing it i feel like
a little bit like isn't it you know

1864
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:32,000
a little bit like isn't it you know
 

1865
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,870
a little bit like isn't it you know
funny

1866
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:32,880
funny
 

1867
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,630
funny
as you're just feeling the same way it

1868
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:34,640
as you're just feeling the same way it
 

1869
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,870
as you're just feeling the same way it
is yes it is but we kind of

1870
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:36,880
is yes it is but we kind of
 

1871
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,470
is yes it is but we kind of
replace it by an intuition

1872
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:40,480
replace it by an intuition
 

1873
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,230
replace it by an intuition
and actually there's a very beautiful

1874
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:42,240
and actually there's a very beautiful
 

1875
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,710
and actually there's a very beautiful
example of this how physicist do this

1876
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:44,720
example of this how physicist do this
 

1877
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,230
example of this how physicist do this
try to replace their intuition and i

1878
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:46,240
try to replace their intuition and i
 

1879
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,830
try to replace their intuition and i
think this is one of my favorite

1880
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:47,840
think this is one of my favorite
 

1881
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,990
think this is one of my favorite
examples about how physicists

1882
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:50,000
examples about how physicists
 

1883
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,430
examples about how physicists
develop intuition it goes to the work of

1884
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:53,440
develop intuition it goes to the work of
 

1885
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,950
develop intuition it goes to the work of
galileo

1886
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:54,960
galileo
 

1887
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,669
galileo
so you know again uh let's go back to

1888
00:29:57,669 --> 00:29:57,679
so you know again uh let's go back to
 

1889
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,510
so you know again uh let's go back to
greek philosophers or maybe aristotle in

1890
00:29:59,510 --> 00:29:59,520
greek philosophers or maybe aristotle in
 

1891
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,389
greek philosophers or maybe aristotle in
this case

1892
00:30:00,389 --> 00:30:00,399
this case
 

1893
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,470
this case
now again let's let's make a criticism

1894
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:02,480
now again let's let's make a criticism
 

1895
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,470
now again let's let's make a criticism
he thought that objects

1896
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:04,480
he thought that objects
 

1897
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,070
he thought that objects
the heavier objects fall faster than the

1898
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:06,080
the heavier objects fall faster than the
 

1899
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,750
the heavier objects fall faster than the
lighter objects makes sense

1900
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:07,760
lighter objects makes sense
 

1901
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,269
lighter objects makes sense
it kind of makes sense and you know

1902
00:30:09,269 --> 00:30:09,279
it kind of makes sense and you know
 

1903
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,269
it kind of makes sense and you know
people say about feather and swan but

1904
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:11,279
people say about feather and swan but
 

1905
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,789
people say about feather and swan but
that's because of the air resistant but

1906
00:30:12,789 --> 00:30:12,799
that's because of the air resistant but
 

1907
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,110
that's because of the air resistant but
you might think like if you have a heavy

1908
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:15,120
you might think like if you have a heavy
 

1909
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,590
you might think like if you have a heavy
stone and a light pebble the heavy one

1910
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:17,600
stone and a light pebble the heavy one
 

1911
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,110
stone and a light pebble the heavy one
will fall first if you don't

1912
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:19,120
will fall first if you don't
 

1913
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,470
will fall first if you don't
you know do any experiments that's the

1914
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:20,480
you know do any experiments that's the
 

1915
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,149
you know do any experiments that's the
first gut reaction i would say everybody

1916
00:30:22,149 --> 00:30:22,159
first gut reaction i would say everybody
 

1917
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:23,909
first gut reaction i would say everybody
would say that's the natural thing

1918
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:23,919
would say that's the natural thing
 

1919
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,149
would say that's the natural thing
galileo did not believe this and he kind

1920
00:30:26,149 --> 00:30:26,159
galileo did not believe this and he kind
 

1921
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,909
galileo did not believe this and he kind
of

1922
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:27,919
of
 

1923
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,950
of
did the experiment famously it said he

1924
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:30,960
did the experiment famously it said he
 

1925
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,870
did the experiment famously it said he
went on the top of piso tower and he

1926
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:32,880
went on the top of piso tower and he
 

1927
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,230
went on the top of piso tower and he
dropped you know these heavy and light

1928
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:34,240
dropped you know these heavy and light
 

1929
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,750
dropped you know these heavy and light
stones and they fell at the same time

1930
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:35,760
stones and they fell at the same time
 

1931
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,070
stones and they fell at the same time
when they he dropped it at the same time

1932
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:38,080
when they he dropped it at the same time
 

1933
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,149
when they he dropped it at the same time
from the same height okay good so he

1934
00:30:40,149 --> 00:30:40,159
from the same height okay good so he
 

1935
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,990
from the same height okay good so he
said i'm done you know i've showed that

1936
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:42,000
said i'm done you know i've showed that
 

1937
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,389
said i'm done you know i've showed that
the

1938
00:30:42,389 --> 00:30:42,399
the
 

1939
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:43,909
the
heavy and lighter objects fought the

1940
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:43,919
heavy and lighter objects fought the
 

1941
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,909
heavy and lighter objects fought the
same time i did the experiment

1942
00:30:45,909 --> 00:30:45,919
same time i did the experiment
 

1943
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:48,470
same time i did the experiment
scientists at that time did not accept

1944
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:48,480
scientists at that time did not accept
 

1945
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,430
scientists at that time did not accept
it

1946
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:49,440
it
 

1947
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,590
it
why was that because at that time

1948
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:51,600
why was that because at that time
 

1949
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,549
why was that because at that time
science was not just

1950
00:30:52,549 --> 00:30:52,559
science was not just
 

1951
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,350
science was not just
experimental the experiment was not

1952
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:55,360
experimental the experiment was not
 

1953
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,630
experimental the experiment was not
enough

00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:56,640
enough

enough
they didn't think that they have to sort

1956
00:30:58,470 --> 00:30:58,480
they didn't think that they have to sort
 

1957
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,950
they didn't think that they have to sort
their hands in doing experiments to get

why so galileo had to come up with an

1964
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:05,600
why so galileo had to come up with an
 

1965
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,750
why so galileo had to come up with an
explanation of why heavier and lighter

1966
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:07,760
explanation of why heavier and lighter
 

1967
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,430
explanation of why heavier and lighter
objects fought the same ray

1968

objects fought the same ray
this is the way he convinced them using

1970
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:11,760
this is the way he convinced them using
 

1971
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,110
this is the way he convinced them using
symmetry

1972

symmetry
 

1973

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:16,870
he said suppose you have three bricks
the same

1976
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:16,880
the same
 

1977
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,909
the same
shape the same size

1978
00:31:19,909 --> 00:31:19,919

 

1979
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,549

same as everything and we hold these

1980
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:22,559
same as everything and we hold these
 

1981
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,950
same as everything and we hold these
three bricks at the same height

1982
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:24,960
three bricks at the same height
 

1983
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,470
three bricks at the same height
and drop them which one will fall to the

1984
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:28,480
and drop them which one will fall to the
 

1985
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:28,870
and drop them which one will fall to the
ground

1986
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:28,880

first everybody said of course we know

1988
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:31,360
first everybody said of course we know
 

1989
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,230
first everybody said of course we know
that symmetry

1990
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:32,240
that symmetry
 

1991
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,669
that symmetry
tells you know they're all the same

1992
00:31:33,669 --> 00:31:33,679
tells you know they're all the same
 

1993
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:35,350
tells you know they're all the same
shape same size same height

1994
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:35,360
shape same size same height
 

1995
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,870
shape same size same height
of course they fall at the same time

1996
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:36,880
of course they fall at the same time
 

1997
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,710
of course they fall at the same time
yeah we know that next next

1998
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:38,720
yeah we know that next next
 

1999
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,029
yeah we know that next next
it's trivial he says okay what if we

2000
00:31:41,029 --> 00:31:41,039
it's trivial he says okay what if we
 

2001
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,549
it's trivial he says okay what if we
move these bricks around with the same

2002
00:31:42,549 --> 00:31:42,559
move these bricks around with the same
 

2003
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,070
move these bricks around with the same
height does it change the time they hit

2004
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:44,080
height does it change the time they hit
 

2005
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,190
height does it change the time they hit
the ground

2006
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:45,200
the ground
 

2007
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,630
the ground
they said if it's the same height again

2008
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:46,640
they said if it's the same height again
 

2009
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,230
they said if it's the same height again
by the symmetry principle because the

2010
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:48,240
by the symmetry principle because the
 

2011
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,509
by the symmetry principle because the

translation the symmetry

2014
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:50,960
translation the symmetry
 

2015
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,789
translation the symmetry
no it doesn't matter they all fall the

2016
00:31:52,789 --> 00:31:52,799
no it doesn't matter they all fall the
 

2017
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,950
no it doesn't matter they all fall the
same rate good doesn't matter how close

2018
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:54,960
same rate good doesn't matter how close
 

2019
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,950
same rate good doesn't matter how close
i bring them together no it doesn't

2020
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:56,960
i bring them together no it doesn't
 

2021
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,950
i bring them together no it doesn't
okay suppose i make the two bricks touch

2022
00:31:58,950 --> 00:31:58,960
okay suppose i make the two bricks touch
 

2023
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,310
okay suppose i make the two bricks touch
and then let them go do they fall out

2024
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:00,320
and then let them go do they fall out
 

2025
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,110
and then let them go do they fall out
the same raid

2026
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:01,120
the same raid
 

2027
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,070
the same raid
yes they do but they said well the two

2028
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:04,080
yes they do but they said well the two
 

2029
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:04,870
yes they do but they said well the two
bricks that touch

2030
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:04,880
bricks that touch
 

2031
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,389
bricks that touch
are twice more mass than this other

2032
00:32:06,389 --> 00:32:06,399
are twice more mass than this other
 

2033
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,230
are twice more mass than this other
brick and you just agreed that they

2034
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:08,240
brick and you just agreed that they
 

2035
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,509
brick and you just agreed that they
fought the same rate

2036
00:32:09,509 --> 00:32:09,519
fought the same rate
 

2037
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:10,950
fought the same rate
they say yeah yeah we just agreed that's

2038
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:10,960
they say yeah yeah we just agreed that's
 

2039
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,029
they say yeah yeah we just agreed that's
right that's strange yes

2040
00:32:13,029 --> 00:32:13,039
right that's strange yes
 

2041
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,029
right that's strange yes
so he deconfused them by the symmetry

2042
00:32:15,029 --> 00:32:15,039
so he deconfused them by the symmetry
 

2043
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,549
so he deconfused them by the symmetry
design so this way

2044
00:32:16,549 --> 00:32:16,559
design so this way
 

2045
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,389
design so this way

reason about it

2138
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:56,240
reason about it
 

2139
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:01,029
reason about it
it's uh the more i talk to topologists

2140
00:34:01,029 --> 00:34:01,039

 

2141
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,750

the more they seem to not operate at all

2142
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:03,760
the more they seem to not operate at all
 

2143
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,590
the more they seem to not operate at all
at all in the visual space

2144
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:05,600
at all in the visual space
 

2145
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,909
at all in the visual space
they really trust the mathematics like

2146
00:34:07,909 --> 00:34:07,919
they really trust the mathematics like
 

2147
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:09,589
they really trust the mathematics like
which is really annoying to me because

2148
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:09,599
which is really annoying to me because
 

2149
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,990
which is really annoying to me because
topology

2150
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:12,000
topology
 

2151
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,950
topology
and differential geometry feels like it

2152
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:14,960
and differential geometry feels like it
 

2153
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,550
and differential geometry feels like it
has a lot of potential for beautiful

2154
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:16,560
has a lot of potential for beautiful
 

2155
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,430
has a lot of potential for beautiful
pictures

2156
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:17,440
pictures
 

2157
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,310
pictures
yes i think they do actually i would not

2158
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:20,320
yes i think they do actually i would not
 

2159
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,750
yes i think they do actually i would not
be able to

2160
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:21,760
be able to
 

2161
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,069
be able to
uh do my my research if i don't have an

2162
00:34:24,069 --> 00:34:24,079
uh do my my research if i don't have an
 

2163
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:26,149
uh do my my research if i don't have an
intuitive feel about geometry

2164
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:26,159
intuitive feel about geometry
 

2165
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,629
intuitive feel about geometry
and i i will get to it as you mentioned

2166
00:34:28,629 --> 00:34:28,639
and i i will get to it as you mentioned
 

2167
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,550
and i i will get to it as you mentioned
late uh before that

2168
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:30,560
late uh before that
 

2169
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,149
late uh before that
how for example in strength there you

2170
00:34:32,149 --> 00:34:32,159
how for example in strength there you
 

2171
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,430
how for example in strength there you
deal with these extra dimensions and

2172
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:33,440
deal with these extra dimensions and
 

2173
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,389
deal with these extra dimensions and
i'll be very happy

2174
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:34,399
i'll be very happy
 

2175
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:35,750
i'll be very happy
to describe how we do it because with

2176
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:35,760
to describe how we do it because with
 

2177
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,589
to describe how we do it because with
that intuition we will not get anywhere

2178
00:34:37,589 --> 00:34:37,599
that intuition we will not get anywhere
 

2179
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:38,149
that intuition we will not get anywhere
and i

2180
00:34:38,149 --> 00:34:38,159
and i
 

2181
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,589
and i
i don't think you can just rely on

2182
00:34:39,589 --> 00:34:39,599
i don't think you can just rely on
 

2183
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,270
i don't think you can just rely on
formalism i don't

2184
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:41,280
formalism i don't
 

2185
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,109
formalism i don't
i don't think any physicist just relies

2186
00:34:43,109 --> 00:34:43,119
i don't think any physicist just relies
 

2187
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:45,190
i don't think any physicist just relies
on formalism that's not physics that's

2188
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:45,200
on formalism that's not physics that's
 

2189
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,629
on formalism that's not physics that's
not understanding

2190
00:34:46,629 --> 00:34:46,639
not understanding
 

2191
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,629
not understanding
so we have to intuit it and that's

2192
00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:48,639
so we have to intuit it and that's
 

2193
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,389
so we have to intuit it and that's
crucial and this there are steps of

2194
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:50,399
crucial and this there are steps of
 

2195
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:51,829
crucial and this there are steps of
doing it and we learned it might not be

2196
00:34:51,829 --> 00:34:51,839
doing it and we learned it might not be
 

2197
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:52,629
doing it and we learned it might not be
trivial

2198
00:34:52,629 --> 00:34:52,639
trivial
 

2199
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,550
trivial
but we learned how to do it similar to

2200
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:54,560
but we learned how to do it similar to
 

2201
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,389
but we learned how to do it similar to
this galileo picture i just told you

2202
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:56,399
this galileo picture i just told you
 

2203
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:59,670
this galileo picture i just told you
you have to build these gradually but

2204
00:34:59,670 --> 00:34:59,680
you have to build these gradually but
 

2205
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,750
you have to build these gradually but
about to connect the bricks

2206
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:03,760
about to connect the bricks
 

2207
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,790
about to connect the bricks
literally yeah so yeah so then uh so

2208
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:06,800
literally yeah so yeah so then uh so
 

2209
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,470
literally yeah so yeah so then uh so
going back to your question about this

2210
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:08,480
going back to your question about this
 

2211
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,910
going back to your question about this
the path of the history of the science

2212
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:09,920
the path of the history of the science
 

2213
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,710
the path of the history of the science
so i was

2214
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:10,720
so i was
 

2215
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,390
so i was
saying about the existing magnesium and

2216
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:12,400
saying about the existing magnesium and
 

2217
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,470
saying about the existing magnesium and
the special relativity where simple idea

2218
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:14,480
the special relativity where simple idea
 

2219
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,109
the special relativity where simple idea
led to special relativity but then he

2220
00:35:17,109 --> 00:35:17,119
led to special relativity but then he
 

2221
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,069
led to special relativity but then he
went further

2222
00:35:18,069 --> 00:35:18,079
went further
 

2223
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,150
went further
thinking about acceleration in the

2224
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:20,160
thinking about acceleration in the
 

2225
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,150
thinking about acceleration in the
context of relativity and he came up

2226
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:22,160
context of relativity and he came up
 

2227
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,670
context of relativity and he came up
with general relativity

2228
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:23,680
with general relativity
 

2229
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,790
with general relativity
where he talked about you know the

2230
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:24,800
where he talked about you know the
 

2231
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,950
where he talked about you know the
fabric of space time being curved and so

2232
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:26,960
fabric of space time being curved and so
 

2233
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,990
fabric of space time being curved and so
forth and

2234
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:28,000
forth and
 

2235
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,630
forth and
matter affecting the the curvature of

2236
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:30,640
matter affecting the the curvature of
 

2237
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,910
matter affecting the the curvature of
the space on time so

2238
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:31,920
the space on time so
 

2239
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,230
the space on time so
so this gradually became a

2240
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:36,240

 

2241
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,470

connection between geometry and physics

2242
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:38,480
connection between geometry and physics
 

2243
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,470
connection between geometry and physics
namely he replaced newton's

2244
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:40,480
namely he replaced newton's
 

2245
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,510
namely he replaced newton's
you know gravitational force with

2246
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:43,520
you know gravitational force with
 

2247
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,910
you know gravitational force with
a very geometrical beautiful picture

2248
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:45,920
a very geometrical beautiful picture
 

2249
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,670
a very geometrical beautiful picture
it's much more elegant than newton's but

2250
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:47,680
it's much more elegant than newton's but
 

2251
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,910
it's much more elegant than newton's but
much more complicated mathematically

2252
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:49,920
much more complicated mathematically
 

2253
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,670
much more complicated mathematically
so so when we say it's simpler we mean

2254
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:53,680
so so when we say it's simpler we mean
 

2255
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,670
so so when we say it's simpler we mean
in some form it's simpler but not in

2256
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:55,680
in some form it's simpler but not in
 

2257
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,829
in some form it's simpler but not in
pragmatic terms of equation solving the

2258
00:35:57,829 --> 00:35:57,839
pragmatic terms of equation solving the
 

2259
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:58,710
pragmatic terms of equation solving the
equations are

2260
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:58,720
equations are
 

2261
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,710
equations are
much harder to solve in einstein's

2262
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:00,720
much harder to solve in einstein's
 

2263
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,230
much harder to solve in einstein's
theory and in fact so much

2264
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:02,240
theory and in fact so much
 

2265
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,829
theory and in fact so much
so much harder that einstein himself

2266
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:03,839
so much harder that einstein himself
 

2267
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,510
so much harder that einstein himself
couldn't solve many of his many of the

2268
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:05,520
couldn't solve many of his many of the
 

2269
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,790
couldn't solve many of his many of the
cases he thought for example you

2270
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:06,800
cases he thought for example you
 

2271
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,390
cases he thought for example you
couldn't solve the equation for a

2272
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:08,400
couldn't solve the equation for a
 

2273
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,190
couldn't solve the equation for a
spherical symmetric matter uh like like

2274
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:11,200
spherical symmetric matter uh like like
 

2275
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,790
spherical symmetric matter uh like like
if you had this symmetric sun

2276
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:12,800
if you had this symmetric sun
 

2277
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,150
if you had this symmetric sun
he didn't think you can actually write

2278
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:14,160
he didn't think you can actually write
 

2279
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,990
he didn't think you can actually write
this solve his equation for that and

2280
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:16,000
this solve his equation for that and
 

2281
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,750
this solve his equation for that and
a year after he he said that it was

2282
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:17,760
a year after he he said that it was
 

2283
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,230
a year after he he said that it was
solved by by short child so it was

2284
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:20,240
solved by by short child so it was
 

2285
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,910
solved by by short child so it was
it was that hard that he didn't think

2286
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:21,920
it was that hard that he didn't think
 

2287
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,349
it was that hard that he didn't think
it's going to be that easy so yeah the

2288
00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:23,359
it's going to be that easy so yeah the
 

2289
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:24,870
it's going to be that easy so yeah the
formalism is hard

2290
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:24,880
formalism is hard
 

2291
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,870
formalism is hard
but the contrast between the special

2292
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:26,880
but the contrast between the special
 

2293
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,310
but the contrast between the special
relativity and general relativity is

2294
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:28,320
relativity and general relativity is
 

2295
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,750
relativity and general relativity is
very interesting because one of them has

2296
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:29,760
very interesting because one of them has
 

2297
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,430
very interesting because one of them has
almost trivial math

2298
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:31,440
almost trivial math
 

2299
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,510
almost trivial math
and the other one has super complicated

2300
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:33,520
and the other one has super complicated
 

2301
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,470
and the other one has super complicated
math

2302
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:34,480
math
 

2303
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,510
math
both are physically amazingly important

2304
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:37,520
both are physically amazingly important
 

2305
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,990
both are physically amazingly important
and so so we have learned that you know

2306
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:40,000
and so so we have learned that you know
 

2307
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,750
and so so we have learned that you know
the physics

2308
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:41,760
the physics
 

2309
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,790
the physics
may or may not require complicated math

2310
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:44,800
may or may not require complicated math
 

2311
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,270
may or may not require complicated math
we should not shy from using complicated

2312
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:47,280
we should not shy from using complicated
 

2313
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,710
we should not shy from using complicated
math like einstein did

2314
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:48,720
math like einstein did
 

2315
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,230
math like einstein did
nobody einstein wouldn't say i'm not

2316
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:50,240
nobody einstein wouldn't say i'm not
 

2317
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,589
nobody einstein wouldn't say i'm not
going to touch this math because it's

2318
00:36:51,589 --> 00:36:51,599
going to touch this math because it's
 

2319
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,109
going to touch this math because it's
too much you know

2320
00:36:53,109 --> 00:36:53,119
too much you know
 

2321
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,790
too much you know
tensors or you know curvature and i

2322
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:54,800
tensors or you know curvature and i
 

2323
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,230
tensors or you know curvature and i
don't like four-dimensional space-time

2324
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:56,240
don't like four-dimensional space-time
 

2325
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,069
don't like four-dimensional space-time
because i can't see four-dimension

2326
00:36:58,069 --> 00:36:58,079
because i can't see four-dimension
 

2327
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,390
because i can't see four-dimension
he wasn't doing that he was willing to

2328
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:00,400
he wasn't doing that he was willing to
 

2329
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,990
he wasn't doing that he was willing to
abstract from that because

2330
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:02,000
abstract from that because
 

2331
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,990
abstract from that because
physics drove him in that direction but

2332
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:04,000
physics drove him in that direction but
 

2333
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,750
physics drove him in that direction but
his motivation was physics physics

2334
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:05,760
his motivation was physics physics
 

2335
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,470
his motivation was physics physics
pushed him

2336
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:06,480
pushed him
 

2337
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,430
pushed him
just like newton pushed to develop

2338
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:09,440
just like newton pushed to develop
 

2339
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,349
just like newton pushed to develop
calculus because physics pushed him that

2340
00:37:11,349 --> 00:37:11,359
calculus because physics pushed him that
 

2341
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,030
calculus because physics pushed him that
he didn't have the tools so he had to

2342
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:13,040
he didn't have the tools so he had to
 

2343
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,990
he didn't have the tools so he had to
develop the tools

2344
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:14,000
develop the tools
 

2345
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,470
develop the tools
to answer his physics questions so his

2346
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:16,480
to answer his physics questions so his
 

2347
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,710
to answer his physics questions so his
motivation was physics again

2348
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:18,720
motivation was physics again
 

2349
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,710
motivation was physics again
so to me those are examples which showed

2350
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:20,720
so to me those are examples which showed
 

2351
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,790
so to me those are examples which showed
that math and physics have this

2352
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:22,800
that math and physics have this
 

2353
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,870
that math and physics have this
symbiotic reality relationship which

2354
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:24,880
symbiotic reality relationship which
 

2355
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,109
symbiotic reality relationship which
which kind of reinforce each other here

of both of them namely newton's work led
 

2361
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,270
of both of them namely newton's work led
to development of mathematics

2362
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:33,280
to development of mathematics
 

2363
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,750
to development of mathematics
calculus and in the case of einstein he

2364
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:35,760
calculus and in the case of einstein he
 

2365
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,470
calculus and in the case of einstein he
didn't develop

2366
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:36,480
didn't develop
 

2367
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,190
didn't develop
the premium geometry just use them so so

2368
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:39,200
the premium geometry just use them so so
 

2369
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,310
the premium geometry just use them so so
it goes both ways

2370
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:40,320
it goes both ways
 

2371
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,150
it goes both ways
and in the context of modern physics we

2372
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:42,160
and in the context of modern physics we
 

2373
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,910
and in the context of modern physics we
see that again and again it goes both

2374
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:43,920
see that again and again it goes both
 

2375
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,470
see that again and again it goes both
ways

2376
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:44,480

i'll ask the same question about
 

2385
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,950
i'll ask the same question about
einstein's ideas which is

einstein's ideas which is
 

2387
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,430
einstein's ideas which is
uh which one do you think is the biggest

00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,069
aha moment the general relativity to you
is not

2460
00:39:02,069 --> 00:39:02,079
is not
 

2461
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:05,109
is not
like the conception of space time in a

2462
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:05,119
like the conception of space time in a
 

2463
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:06,470
like the conception of space time in a
sense the conception of space time

2464
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:06,480
sense the conception of space time
 

2465
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,430
sense the conception of space time
already was

2466
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:07,440
already was
 

2467
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,870
already was
part of the speciality when you talk

2468
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:08,880
part of the speciality when you talk
 

2469
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,790
part of the speciality when you talk
about length contraction

2470
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:10,800
about length contraction
 

2471
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,390
about length contraction
so general relativity takes that to the

2472
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:12,400
so general relativity takes that to the
 

2473
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,310
so general relativity takes that to the
next step but beginning of it was

2474
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:14,320
next step but beginning of it was
 

2475
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,030
next step but beginning of it was
already

2476
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:15,040
already
 

2477
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,829
already
space link contracts time dilays so once

2478
00:39:17,829 --> 00:39:17,839
space link contracts time dilays so once
 

2479
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:19,190
space link contracts time dilays so once
you talk about those then yeah you can

2480
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:19,200
you talk about those then yeah you can
 

2481
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,630
you talk about those then yeah you can
dilate more or less different places

2482
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:20,640
dilate more or less different places
 

2483
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,829
dilate more or less different places
than it's curvature

2484
00:39:21,829 --> 00:39:21,839
than it's curvature
 

2485
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:23,430
than it's curvature
so you don't have a choice so it's kind

2486
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:23,440
so you don't have a choice so it's kind
 

2487
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,829
so you don't have a choice so it's kind
of started just with that same simple

2488
00:39:25,829 --> 00:39:25,839
of started just with that same simple
 

2489
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:26,390
of started just with that same simple
thought

2490
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:26,400
thought
 

2491
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,950
thought
speed of light is the same for all where

2492
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:28,960
speed of light is the same for all where
 

2493
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,069
speed of light is the same for all where
does uh

2494
00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:30,079
does uh
 

2495
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:32,470
does uh
quantum mechanics come into view exactly

2496
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:32,480
quantum mechanics come into view exactly
 

2497
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,310
quantum mechanics come into view exactly
so this is the next step so einstein's

2498
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:34,320
so this is the next step so einstein's
 

2499
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,030
so this is the next step so einstein's
you know

2500
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:35,040
you know
 

2501
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,030
you know
uh develops general activity and is

2502
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:37,040
uh develops general activity and is
 

2503
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,470
uh develops general activity and is
beginning to develop the foundation of

2504
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:38,480
beginning to develop the foundation of
 

2505
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,910
beginning to develop the foundation of
quantum mechanics at the same time the

2506
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:39,920
quantum mechanics at the same time the
 

2507
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,230
quantum mechanics at the same time the
photoelectric effects on others

2508
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:42,240
photoelectric effects on others
 

2509
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,349
photoelectric effects on others
and um so so quantum mechanics overtakes

2510
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:45,359
and um so so quantum mechanics overtakes
 

2511
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:46,950
and um so so quantum mechanics overtakes
in fact einstein in many ways because he

2512
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:46,960
in fact einstein in many ways because he
 

2513
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,069
in fact einstein in many ways because he
doesn't like the

2514
00:39:48,069 --> 00:39:48,079
doesn't like the
 

2515
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:49,750
doesn't like the
probabilistic interpretation of quantum

2516
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:49,760
probabilistic interpretation of quantum
 

2517
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,270
probabilistic interpretation of quantum
mechanics and the formulas that's

2518
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:51,280

2521
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,750
emerging
but physicists march on and try to for

00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:55,760
but physicists march on and try to for
 

2523
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,310
but physicists march on and try to for
example

2524
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:56,320
example
 

2525
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,750
example
combine einstein's theory of relativity

2526
00:39:59,750 --> 00:39:59,760
combine einstein's theory of relativity
 

2527
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,390
combine einstein's theory of relativity
with quantum mechanics so dirac takes

2528
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:02,400
with quantum mechanics so dirac takes
 

2529
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,990
with quantum mechanics so dirac takes
special relativity

2530
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:04,000
special relativity
 

2531
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,790
special relativity
tries to see how is it compatible with

00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:06,800
tries to see how is it compatible with
 

2533

quantum mechanics
 

2535
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,510
quantum mechanics
can we pause and briefly say what is

2536
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:09,520
can we pause and briefly say what is
 

2537
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,430
can we pause and briefly say what is
quantum mechanics oh yes sure so quantum

2538
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:11,440
quantum mechanics oh yes sure so quantum

00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:15,440
so i i discussed briefly when i talked
 

2543
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,270
so i i discussed briefly when i talked
about the connection between newtonian

2544
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:17,280
about the connection between newtonian
 

2545
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,470
about the connection between newtonian

2547
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,950

and the euler lagrangian formulation of

2548
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:20,960
and the euler lagrangian formulation of
 

2549
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,390
and the euler lagrangian formulation of
of the newtonian mechanics and

00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:22,400
of the newtonian mechanics and
 

2551
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,750
of the newtonian mechanics and
interpretation of this

2552
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:23,760
interpretation of this
 

2553
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,630
interpretation of this
audio dot grunge formalism in terms of

2554
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:26,640
audio dot grunge formalism in terms of
 

2555
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,470
audio dot grunge formalism in terms of
the paths that the particle take

2556
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:28,480
the paths that the particle take
 

2557
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,230
the paths that the particle take
so when we say a particle goes from here

2558
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:30,240
so when we say a particle goes from here
 

2559
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,510
so when we say a particle goes from here
to here

2560
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:31,520
to here
 

2561
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,150
to here
we usually think it classically it

2562
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:34,160
we usually think it classically it
 

2563
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,230
we usually think it classically it
follows a specific trajectory

2564
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:36,240
follows a specific trajectory
 

2565
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,710
follows a specific trajectory
but actually in quantum mechanics it

2566
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:38,720
but actually in quantum mechanics it
 

2567
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,270
but actually in quantum mechanics it
falls

2568
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:39,280
falls
 

2569
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,589
falls
follows every trajectory with different

2570
00:40:41,589 --> 00:40:41,599
follows every trajectory with different
 

2571
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:42,870
follows every trajectory with different
probabilities

2572
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:42,880
probabilities
 

2573
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,069
probabilities
and so there's this fuzziness now

2574
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:46,079
and so there's this fuzziness now
 

2575
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,990
and so there's this fuzziness now
most probable it's the path that you

2576
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:48,000
most probable it's the path that you
 

2577
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,270
most probable it's the path that you
actually see

2578
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:49,280
actually see
 

2579
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,190
actually see
and the deviation from that is very very

2580
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:51,200
and the deviation from that is very very
 

2581
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,790
and the deviation from that is very very
unlikely and probabilistically very

2582
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:52,800
unlikely and probabilistically very
 

2583
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,750
unlikely and probabilistically very
minuscule

2584
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:53,760
minuscule
 

2585
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,510
minuscule
so in everyday experiments we don't see

2586
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:55,520
so in everyday experiments we don't see
 

2587
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,990
so in everyday experiments we don't see
anything deviated from what we expect

2588
00:40:57,990 --> 00:40:58,000
anything deviated from what we expect
 

2589
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,390
anything deviated from what we expect
but quantum mechanics tells us that the

2590
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:00,400
but quantum mechanics tells us that the
 

2591
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,309
but quantum mechanics tells us that the
things are more fuzzy things are

2592
00:41:02,309 --> 00:41:02,319
things are more fuzzy things are
 

2593
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:05,829
things are more fuzzy things are
are not as precise as the line you draw

2594
00:41:05,829 --> 00:41:05,839
are not as precise as the line you draw
 

2595
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:08,150
are not as precise as the line you draw
things are a bit like cloud so if you go

2596
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:08,160
things are a bit like cloud so if you go
 

2597
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,910
things are a bit like cloud so if you go
to microscopic

2598
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:09,920
to microscopic
 

2599
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,470
to microscopic
uh scales like atomic scales and lower

2600
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:12,480
uh scales like atomic scales and lower
 

2601
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,710
uh scales like atomic scales and lower
these phenomena become more pronounced

2602
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:14,720
these phenomena become more pronounced
 

2603
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,109
these phenomena become more pronounced
you can see it much better the electron

2604
00:41:17,109 --> 00:41:17,119
you can see it much better the electron
 

2605
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:18,550
you can see it much better the electron
is is not at the point but

2606
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:18,560
is is not at the point but
 

2607
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,190
is is not at the point but
the clouds spread out around the nucleus

2608
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:21,200
the clouds spread out around the nucleus
 

2609
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,430
the clouds spread out around the nucleus
and so this fuzziness this probabilistic

2610
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:23,440
and so this fuzziness this probabilistic
 

2611
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,390
and so this fuzziness this probabilistic
aspect

2612
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:24,400
aspect
 

2613
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,589
aspect
of reality is what quantum mechanics

2614
00:41:27,589 --> 00:41:27,599
of reality is what quantum mechanics
 

2615
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,150
of reality is what quantum mechanics
describes can i briefly pause on that on

2616
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:30,160
describes can i briefly pause on that on
 

2617
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,589
describes can i briefly pause on that on
that idea

2618
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:31,599
that idea
 

2619
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,750
that idea
do you think this is quantum mechanics

2620
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:33,760
do you think this is quantum mechanics
 

2621
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,270
do you think this is quantum mechanics
is just a really damn good approximation

2622
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:37,280
is just a really damn good approximation
 

2623
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,710
is just a really damn good approximation
a tool for predicting reality or does it

2624
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:40,720
a tool for predicting reality or does it
 

2625
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,349
a tool for predicting reality or does it
actually describe reality

2626
00:41:43,349 --> 00:41:43,359
actually describe reality
 

2627
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:45,030
actually describe reality
do you think reality is fuzzy at that

2628
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:45,040
do you think reality is fuzzy at that
 

2629
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,950
do you think reality is fuzzy at that
level well i think that

2630
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:46,960
level well i think that
 

2631
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,630
level well i think that
reality is fuzzy at that level but i

2632
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:48,640
reality is fuzzy at that level but i
 

2633
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,829
reality is fuzzy at that level but i
don't think quantum mechanics is

2634
00:41:49,829 --> 00:41:49,839
don't think quantum mechanics is
 

2635
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:51,510
don't think quantum mechanics is
necessarily the end of the story

2636
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:51,520
necessarily the end of the story
 

2637
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,790
necessarily the end of the story
right so um so quantum mechanics is

2638
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:54,800
right so um so quantum mechanics is
 

2639
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,710
right so um so quantum mechanics is
certainly an improvement over classical

2640
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:56,720
certainly an improvement over classical
 

2641
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,109

would have given which is second order
 

2759
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:43,270
would have given which is second order
so you have to take a square root

2760
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:43,280
so you have to take a square root
 

2761
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,870
so you have to take a square root
now square root usually has a plus or

00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:44,880
now square root usually has a plus or
 

2763
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,430
now square root usually has a plus or
minus sign when you take it

2764
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:47,440
minus sign when you take it
 

2765
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,510
minus sign when you take it

minus sign but later physics pointed out
 

2773
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,069

to direct says look there's also this
 

2775
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:58,150
to direct says look there's also this
minus sign and if you use this minus

2776
00:43:58,150 --> 00:43:58,160
minus sign and if you use this minus
 

2777
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,030
minus sign and if you use this minus
sign you get negative energy

2778
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:01,040
sign you get negative energy
 

2779
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,309
sign you get negative energy
in fact it was very very annoying that

in fact it was very very annoying that
 

2781
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:05,589
in fact it was very very annoying that
you know somebody else tells you this

00:44:05,589 --> 00:44:05,599
you know somebody else tells you this
 

2783
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:07,750
you know somebody else tells you this
obvious mistake you make paulie

2784
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:07,760
obvious mistake you make paulie
 

2785
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,349
obvious mistake you make paulie
famous physicist told direct this is

2786
00:44:09,349 --> 00:44:09,359
famous physicist told direct this is
 

2787
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:10,630
famous physicist told direct this is
nonsense you're going to get negative

2788
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:10,640
nonsense you're going to get negative
 

2789
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,150
nonsense you're going to get negative
energy with your equation with negative

2790
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:12,160
energy with your equation with negative
 

2791
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,910
energy with your equation with negative
energy without any bottom you can go all

2792
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:13,920
energy without any bottom you can go all
 

2793
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,750
energy without any bottom you can go all
the way down to negative

2794
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:15,760
the way down to negative
 

2795
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,190
the way down to negative
infinite energy so it doesn't make any

2796
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:17,200
infinite energy so it doesn't make any
 

2797
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,589
infinite energy so it doesn't make any
sense direct thought about it and then

2798
00:44:19,589 --> 00:44:19,599
sense direct thought about it and then
 

2799
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:21,510
sense direct thought about it and then
he remembered paulie's exclusion

2800
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:21,520
he remembered paulie's exclusion
 

2801
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,349
he remembered paulie's exclusion
principle before just before him paulie

2802
00:44:23,349 --> 00:44:23,359
principle before just before him paulie
 

2803
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:24,230
principle before just before him paulie
had said you know

2804
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:24,240
had said you know
 

2805
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,430
had said you know
there's this principle called the

2806
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:25,440
there's this principle called the
 

2807
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,430
there's this principle called the
exclusion principle that you know two or

2808
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:27,440
exclusion principle that you know two or
 

2809
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,790
exclusion principle that you know two or
two electrons cannot be on the same

2810
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:28,800
two electrons cannot be on the same
 

2811
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,309
two electrons cannot be on the same
orbit

2812
00:44:30,309 --> 00:44:30,319
orbit
 

2813
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:32,710
orbit
and so direct said okay you know what

2814
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:32,720
and so direct said okay you know what
 

2815
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,510
and so direct said okay you know what
all these negative energy states

2816
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:35,520
all these negative energy states
 

2817
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,870
all these negative energy states
are filled orbits occupied

2818
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:38,880
are filled orbits occupied
 

2819
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,150
are filled orbits occupied
so according to you uh

2820
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:42,160
so according to you uh
 

2821
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,950
so according to you uh
mr paulie there's no place to go so

2822
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:44,960
mr paulie there's no place to go so
 

2823
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,270
mr paulie there's no place to go so
therefore they only have to go positive

2824
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:47,280
therefore they only have to go positive
 

2825
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,230
therefore they only have to go positive
sounded like a big cheat and then paulie

2826
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:50,240
sounded like a big cheat and then paulie
 

2827
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,910
sounded like a big cheat and then paulie
said oh you know what

2828
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:51,920
said oh you know what
 

2829
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,589
said oh you know what
we can change orbits from one orbit to

2830
00:44:53,589 --> 00:44:53,599
we can change orbits from one orbit to
 

2831
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:54,790
we can change orbits from one orbit to
another what if i take one of these

2832
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:54,800
another what if i take one of these
 

2833
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,390
another what if i take one of these
negative energy orbits and put it up

2834
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:56,400
negative energy orbits and put it up
 

2835
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,510
negative energy orbits and put it up
there

2836
00:44:57,510 --> 00:44:57,520
there
 

2837
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,910
there
then it seems to be a new particle which

2838
00:44:59,910 --> 00:44:59,920
then it seems to be a new particle which
 

2839
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,829
then it seems to be a new particle which
has opposite

2840
00:45:01,829 --> 00:45:01,839
has opposite
 

2841
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:03,750
has opposite
properties to the electron has positive

2842
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:03,760
properties to the electron has positive
 

2843
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,069
properties to the electron has positive
energy but it has positive charge

2844
00:45:06,069 --> 00:45:06,079
energy but it has positive charge
 

2845
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:09,109
energy but it has positive charge
what is that like

2846
00:45:09,109 --> 00:45:09,119
what is that like
 

2847
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:10,790
what is that like
the iraq was a bit worried he said maybe

2848
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:10,800
the iraq was a bit worried he said maybe
 

2849
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,710
the iraq was a bit worried he said maybe
that's proton because proton has plus

2850
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:12,720
that's proton because proton has plus
 

2851
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,270
that's proton because proton has plus
charge he wasn't sure but then he said

2852
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:15,280
charge he wasn't sure but then he said
 

2853
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,390
charge he wasn't sure but then he said
oh maybe it's proton

2854
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:16,400
oh maybe it's proton
 

2855
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,150
oh maybe it's proton
but then they said no no no it has the

2856
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:18,160
but then they said no no no it has the
 

2857
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,750
but then they said no no no it has the
same mass as the electron cannot be

2858
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:19,760
same mass as the electron cannot be
 

2859
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,150
same mass as the electron cannot be
proton because proton is heavier

2860
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:22,160
proton because proton is heavier
 

2861
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,150
proton because proton is heavier
the iraq was stuck he says well then

2862
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:24,160
the iraq was stuck he says well then
 

2863
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,670
the iraq was stuck he says well then
maybe another part we haven't seen

2864
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:27,680

 

2865
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,670

by that time dirac himself was getting a

2866
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:29,680
by that time dirac himself was getting a
 

2867
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:30,710
by that time dirac himself was getting a
little bit

2868
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:30,720
little bit
 

2869
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,309
little bit
worried about his own equation and his

2870
00:45:32,309 --> 00:45:32,319
worried about his own equation and his
 

2871
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:34,069
worried about his own equation and his
own crazy interpretation

2872
00:45:34,069 --> 00:45:34,079
own crazy interpretation
 

2873
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:37,190
own crazy interpretation
yes until a few years later anderson in

2874
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:37,200
yes until a few years later anderson in
 

2875
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,950
yes until a few years later anderson in
photographic cosmic uh

2876
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:38,960
photographic cosmic uh
 

2877
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,309
photographic cosmic uh
in the photographic place that he had

2878
00:45:40,309 --> 00:45:40,319
in the photographic place that he had
 

2879
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:42,150
in the photographic place that he had
gotten from this cosmic rays

2880
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:42,160
gotten from this cosmic rays
 

2881
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:45,990
gotten from this cosmic rays
he discovered a particle which goes in

2882
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:46,000
he discovered a particle which goes in
 

2883
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,589
he discovered a particle which goes in
the opposite direction that the electron

2884
00:45:47,589 --> 00:45:47,599
the opposite direction that the electron
 

2885
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:49,829
the opposite direction that the electron
goes when there's a magnetic field

2886
00:45:49,829 --> 00:45:49,839
goes when there's a magnetic field
 

2887
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:53,430
goes when there's a magnetic field
and with the same mass exactly like what

2888
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:53,440
and with the same mass exactly like what
 

2889
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,109
and with the same mass exactly like what
the iraq had predicted

2890
00:45:55,109 --> 00:45:55,119
the iraq had predicted
 

2891
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:57,589
the iraq had predicted
and this was what we call now positron

2892
00:45:57,589 --> 00:45:57,599
and this was what we call now positron
 

2893
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:58,630
and this was what we call now positron
and in fact

2894
00:45:58,630 --> 00:45:58,640
and in fact
 

2895
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,550
and in fact
beginning with the work of dirac we know

2896
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:00,560
beginning with the work of dirac we know
 

2897
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,109
beginning with the work of dirac we know
that every particle has an anti-particle

2898
00:46:03,109 --> 00:46:03,119
that every particle has an anti-particle
 

2899
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:04,710
that every particle has an anti-particle
and so this idea that there's an

2900
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:04,720
and so this idea that there's an
 

2901
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,550
and so this idea that there's an
anti-particle came from the simple math

2902
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:06,560
anti-particle came from the simple math
 

2903
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,710
anti-particle came from the simple math
you know there's a plus and a minus

2904
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:08,720
you know there's a plus and a minus
 

2905
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:12,710
you know there's a plus and a minus
from the directs quote-unquote mistake

2906
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:12,720
from the directs quote-unquote mistake
 

2907
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,349
from the directs quote-unquote mistake
so again trying to combine ideas

2908
00:46:15,349 --> 00:46:15,359
so again trying to combine ideas
 

2909
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:17,670
so again trying to combine ideas
sometimes the math is smarter than the

2910
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:17,680
sometimes the math is smarter than the
 

2911
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,270
sometimes the math is smarter than the
person who uses it to

2912
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:19,280
person who uses it to
 

2913
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,190
person who uses it to
apply it and you try to resist it and

2914
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:21,200
apply it and you try to resist it and
 

2915
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,030
apply it and you try to resist it and
then you you kind of confront it by

2916
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:23,040
then you you kind of confront it by
 

2917
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,950
then you you kind of confront it by
criticism which is the way it should be

2918
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:24,960
criticism which is the way it should be
 

2919
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,550
criticism which is the way it should be
so physicist comes and said no no that's

2920
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:26,560
so physicist comes and said no no that's
 

2921
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:27,910
so physicist comes and said no no that's
wrong and you correct it and so on so

2922
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:27,920
wrong and you correct it and so on so
 

2923
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:28,630
wrong and you correct it and so on so
that

2924
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:28,640
that
 

2925
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,950
that
is the development of the idea there's

2926
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:30,960
is the development of the idea there's
 

2927
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,710
is the development of the idea there's
particle there's antiparticle and so on

2928
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:32,720
particle there's antiparticle and so on
 

2929
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,309
particle there's antiparticle and so on
so this is the beginning of

2930
00:46:34,309 --> 00:46:34,319
so this is the beginning of
 

2931
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:35,750
so this is the beginning of
development of quantum mechanics and the

2932
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:35,760
development of quantum mechanics and the
 

2933
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,829
development of quantum mechanics and the
connection with relativity but the thing

2934
00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:37,839
connection with relativity but the thing
 

2935
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:39,670
connection with relativity but the thing
was more challenging because

2936
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:39,680
was more challenging because
 

2937
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,349
was more challenging because
we had to also describe how electric and

2938
00:46:41,349 --> 00:46:41,359
we had to also describe how electric and
 

2939
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:42,710
we had to also describe how electric and
magnetic fields

2940
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:42,720
magnetic fields
 

2941
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,030
magnetic fields
work with quantum mechanics this was

2942
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:45,040
work with quantum mechanics this was
 

2943
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,630
work with quantum mechanics this was
much more complicated because it's not

2944
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:46,640
much more complicated because it's not
 

2945
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,589
much more complicated because it's not
just one point

2946
00:46:47,589 --> 00:46:47,599
just one point
 

2947
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:49,109
just one point
electric and magnetic fields were

2948
00:46:49,109 --> 00:46:49,119
electric and magnetic fields were
 

2949
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:51,430
electric and magnetic fields were
everywhere so you had to talk about

2950
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:51,440
everywhere so you had to talk about
 

2951
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,349
everywhere so you had to talk about
fluctuating and a fuzziness of

2952
00:46:53,349 --> 00:46:53,359
fluctuating and a fuzziness of
 

2953
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:55,030
fluctuating and a fuzziness of
electrical field and magnetic fields

2954
00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:55,040
electrical field and magnetic fields
 

2955
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,230
electrical field and magnetic fields
everywhere

2956
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:56,240
everywhere
 

2957
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,109
everywhere
and the math for that was was was very

2958
00:46:59,109 --> 00:46:59,119
and the math for that was was was very
 

2959
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:00,550
and the math for that was was was very
difficult to deal with

2960
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:00,560
difficult to deal with
 

2961
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,550
difficult to deal with
and this led to a subject called quantum

2962
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:02,560
and this led to a subject called quantum
 

2963
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:03,990
and this led to a subject called quantum
field theory fields

2964
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:04,000
field theory fields
 

2965
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,589
field theory fields
like electric and magnetic field to be

2966
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:05,599
like electric and magnetic field to be
 

2967
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:07,430
like electric and magnetic field to be
quantum had to be described

2968
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:07,440
quantum had to be described
 

2969
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,710
quantum had to be described
also in a wavy way feinman in particular

2970
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:10,720
also in a wavy way feinman in particular
 

2971
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,589
also in a wavy way feinman in particular
was one of the pioneers along with

2972
00:47:13,589 --> 00:47:13,599
was one of the pioneers along with
 

2973
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,030
was one of the pioneers along with
schwinger's and others

2974
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:15,040
schwinger's and others
 

2975
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,109
schwinger's and others
to try to come up with the formalism to

2976
00:47:17,109 --> 00:47:17,119
to try to come up with the formalism to
 

2977
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:18,710
to try to come up with the formalism to
deal with fields

2978
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:18,720
deal with fields
 

2979
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,790
deal with fields
like electric and magnetic fields

2980
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:20,800
like electric and magnetic fields
 

2981
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,549
like electric and magnetic fields
interacting with electrons

2982
00:47:22,549 --> 00:47:22,559
interacting with electrons
 

2983
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:24,390
interacting with electrons
in a consistent quantum fashion and they

2984
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:24,400
in a consistent quantum fashion and they
 

2985
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,829
in a consistent quantum fashion and they
just developed this beautiful theory

2986
00:47:25,829 --> 00:47:25,839
just developed this beautiful theory
 

2987
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:28,230
just developed this beautiful theory
quantum electrodynamics from that and

2988
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:28,240
quantum electrodynamics from that and
 

2989
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,309
quantum electrodynamics from that and
later on that same formalism quantum

2990
00:47:30,309 --> 00:47:30,319
later on that same formalism quantum
 

2991
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:32,069
later on that same formalism quantum
field theory led to the

2992
00:47:32,069 --> 00:47:32,079
field theory led to the
 

2993
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:33,910
field theory led to the
discovery of other forces and other

2994
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:33,920
discovery of other forces and other
 

2995
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,910
discovery of other forces and other
particles all consistent with the idea

2996
00:47:35,910 --> 00:47:35,920
particles all consistent with the idea
 

2997
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:36,790
particles all consistent with the idea
of quantum

2998
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:36,800
of quantum
 

2999
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,069
of quantum
mechanics so that was how physics

3000
00:47:40,069 --> 00:47:40,079
mechanics so that was how physics
 

3001
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:40,710
mechanics so that was how physics
progressed

3002
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:40,720
progressed
 

3003
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,710
progressed
and so basically we learned that all

3004
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:42,720
and so basically we learned that all
 

3005
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,750
and so basically we learned that all
particles and all the forces

3006
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:45,760
particles and all the forces
 

3007
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,670
particles and all the forces
are are in some sense related to

3008
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:47,680
are are in some sense related to
 

3009
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,589
are are in some sense related to
particle exchanges

3010
00:47:49,589 --> 00:47:49,599
particle exchanges
 

3011
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,589
particle exchanges
and so for example electromagnetic

3012
00:47:51,589 --> 00:47:51,599
and so for example electromagnetic
 

3013
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:52,870
and so for example electromagnetic
forces are

3014
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:52,880
forces are
 

3015
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,549
forces are
are mediated by a particle we call

3016
00:47:54,549 --> 00:47:54,559
are mediated by a particle we call
 

3017
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:56,309
are mediated by a particle we call
photon and

3018
00:47:56,309 --> 00:47:56,319
photon and
 

3019
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:58,470
photon and
uh and so forth and the same for other

3020
00:47:58,470 --> 00:47:58,480
uh and so forth and the same for other
 

3021
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,829
uh and so forth and the same for other
forces that they discovered strong

3022
00:47:59,829 --> 00:47:59,839
forces that they discovered strong
 

3023
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:01,349
forces that they discovered strong
forces and the weak forces so

3024
00:48:01,349 --> 00:48:01,359
forces and the weak forces so
 

3025
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:02,790
forces and the weak forces so
so we got the sense of what quantum

3026
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:02,800
so we got the sense of what quantum
 

3027
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,030
so we got the sense of what quantum
field theory is is that a big leap

3028
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:05,040
field theory is is that a big leap
 

3029
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,549
field theory is is that a big leap
of uh of an idea that uh

3030
00:48:08,549 --> 00:48:08,559
of uh of an idea that uh
 

3031
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:12,069
of uh of an idea that uh
particles are fluctuations in the field

3032
00:48:12,069 --> 00:48:12,079
particles are fluctuations in the field
 

3033
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:14,950
particles are fluctuations in the field
like the idea that everything is a field

3034
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:14,960
like the idea that everything is a field
 

3035
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,950
like the idea that everything is a field
is the old einstein

3036
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:16,960
is the old einstein
 

3037
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,109
is the old einstein
light is a wave both a particle and a

3038
00:48:19,109 --> 00:48:19,119
light is a wave both a particle and a
 

3039
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:21,109
light is a wave both a particle and a
wave kind of idea is that is that a huge

3040
00:48:21,109 --> 00:48:21,119
wave kind of idea is that is that a huge
 

3041
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:24,549
wave kind of idea is that is that a huge
leap in our understanding of conceiving

3042
00:48:24,549 --> 00:48:24,559
leap in our understanding of conceiving
 

3043
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:26,230
leap in our understanding of conceiving
the universe's fields

3044
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:26,240
the universe's fields
 

3045
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,069
the universe's fields
i would say so i would say that on

3046
00:48:28,069 --> 00:48:28,079
i would say so i would say that on
 

3047
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:29,589
i would say so i would say that on
viewing the particles

3048
00:48:29,589 --> 00:48:29,599
viewing the particles
 

3049
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:31,910
viewing the particles
this duality that bore mentioned between

3050
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:31,920
this duality that bore mentioned between
 

3051
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,510
this duality that bore mentioned between
particles and waves that waves can

3052
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:33,520
particles and waves that waves can
 

3053
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,950
particles and waves that waves can
behave sometimes like particles

3054
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:34,960
behave sometimes like particles
 

3055
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,230
behave sometimes like particles
sometimes like waves

3056
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:36,240
sometimes like waves
 

3057
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,030
sometimes like waves
is one of the biggest leaps of

3058
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:39,040
is one of the biggest leaps of
 

3059
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,069
is one of the biggest leaps of
imagination

3060
00:48:40,069 --> 00:48:40,079
imagination
 

3061
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:42,790
imagination
that quantum mechanics made physics do

3062
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:42,800
that quantum mechanics made physics do
 

3063
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,549
that quantum mechanics made physics do
so i agree that that is

3064
00:48:44,549 --> 00:48:44,559
so i agree that that is
 

3065
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:47,910
so i agree that that is
quite remarkable is duality fundamental

3066
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:47,920
quite remarkable is duality fundamental
 

3067
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,349
quite remarkable is duality fundamental
to

3068
00:48:49,349 --> 00:48:49,359
to
 

3069
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,030
to
to the universe or is it just because we

3070
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:51,040
to the universe or is it just because we
 

3071
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,710
to the universe or is it just because we
don't understand it fully like we'll

3072
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:52,720
don't understand it fully like we'll
 

3073
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,750
don't understand it fully like we'll
eventually collapse into a clean

00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:55,760
eventually collapse into a clean
 

3075
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,750
eventually collapse into a clean
explanation that doesn't require duality

3076
00:48:57,750 --> 00:48:57,760
explanation that doesn't require duality
 

3077
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:58,470
explanation that doesn't require duality
like

3078
00:48:58,470 --> 00:48:58,480
like
 

3079
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,589
like
th that that a phenomenon could be two

th that that a phenomenon could be two
 

3081
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:02,870
th that that a phenomenon could be two
things at once and both

3082
00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:02,880
things at once and both
 

3083
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,150
things at once and both
to be true so that seems weird so in

to be true so that seems weird so in

fact i
 

3087
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,630

i i was going to get to that when we get

3088
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:08,640
i i was going to get to that when we get
 

3089
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,150
i i was going to get to that when we get
to string theory but maybe i can comment

3090
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:10,160
to string theory but maybe i can comment
 

3091
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:10,870
to string theory but maybe i can comment
on that now

3092
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:10,880
on that now
 

3093
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,109
on that now
duality turns out to be running the show

00:49:19,670 --> 00:49:19,680
so it's the most beautiful subject i
 

3103
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,109
so it's the most beautiful subject i
want to talk about let's let's talk

00:49:22,069 --> 00:49:22,079
about it in the context
 

3107
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:23,589
about it in the context
let's talk about the other strengths so

3108
00:49:23,589 --> 00:49:23,599
let's talk about the other strengths so
 

3109
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:27,030
let's talk about the other strengths so
we uh do want to take a next step into

3110
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:27,040
we uh do want to take a next step into
 

3111
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,549
we uh do want to take a next step into
because we mentioned general relativity

3112
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:28,559
because we mentioned general relativity
 

3113
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:30,390
because we mentioned general relativity
we mentioned quantum mechanics

3114
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:30,400
we mentioned quantum mechanics
 

3115
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,670
we mentioned quantum mechanics
is there something to be said about

3116
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:31,680
is there something to be said about
 

3117
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,510
is there something to be said about
quantum gravity yes that's exactly the

3118
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:33,520
quantum gravity yes that's exactly the
 

3119
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:34,870
quantum gravity yes that's exactly the
right point to talk about

3120
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:34,880
right point to talk about
 

3121
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,710
right point to talk about
so namely we have talked about quantum

3122
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:36,720
so namely we have talked about quantum
 

3123
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,549
so namely we have talked about quantum
fields and i talked about electric

3124
00:49:38,549 --> 00:49:38,559
fields and i talked about electric
 

3125
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,750
fields and i talked about electric
forces

3126
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:39,760
forces
 

3127
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,670
forces
photon being the particle carrying those

3128
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:41,680
photon being the particle carrying those
 

3129
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,390
photon being the particle carrying those
forces so for gravity

3130
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:44,400
forces so for gravity
 

3131
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,790
forces so for gravity

you get another particle called graviton

3138
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:52,480
you get another particle called graviton
 

3139
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:55,750
you get another particle called graviton
so what about gravitons should be there

3140
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:55,760
so what about gravitons should be there
 

3141
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,309
so what about gravitons should be there
no problem so then you start computing

3142
00:49:58,309 --> 00:49:58,319
no problem so then you start computing
 

3143
00:49:58,319 --> 00:49:58,950
no problem so then you start computing
it

3144
00:49:58,950 --> 00:49:58,960
it
 

3145
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,790
it
what do i mean by computing it well you

3146
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:00,800
what do i mean by computing it well you
 

3147
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,510
what do i mean by computing it well you

with an electron and so on see what you

3152
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:06,880
with an electron and so on see what you
 

3153
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:07,910
with an electron and so on see what you
get

3154
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:07,920
get
 

3155

feynman had already mastered the this

3156
00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:11,040
feynman had already mastered the this
 

3157
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,870
feynman had already mastered the this
quantum electrodynamics you said no

3158
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:12,880
quantum electrodynamics you said no
 

3159
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,309
quantum electrodynamics you said no
problem let me do it

3160
00:50:14,309 --> 00:50:14,319
problem let me do it
 

3161
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:17,109
problem let me do it
even though these are such weak forces

3162
00:50:17,109 --> 00:50:17,119
even though these are such weak forces
 

3163
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:18,870
even though these are such weak forces
the gravity is very weak so therefore to

3164
00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:18,880
the gravity is very weak so therefore to
 

3165
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:19,510
the gravity is very weak so therefore to
see them

3166
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:19,520
see them
 

3167
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,270
see them
these quantum effects of gravitational

3168
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:21,280
these quantum effects of gravitational
 

3169
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,109
these quantum effects of gravitational
waves is was impossible

3170
00:50:23,109 --> 00:50:23,119
waves is was impossible
 

3171
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:26,069
waves is was impossible
it's even impossible today so feynman

3172
00:50:26,069 --> 00:50:26,079
it's even impossible today so feynman
 

3173
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:27,829
it's even impossible today so feynman
just did it for fun

3174
00:50:27,829 --> 00:50:27,839
just did it for fun
 

3175
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:29,109
just did it for fun
he usually you know had this mindset

3176
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:29,119
he usually you know had this mindset
 

3177
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:30,309
he usually you know had this mindset
that i want to do something which i will

3178
00:50:30,309 --> 00:50:30,319
that i want to do something which i will
 

3179
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:31,910
that i want to do something which i will
see an experiment but this one let's

3180
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:31,920
see an experiment but this one let's
 

3181
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,230
see an experiment but this one let's
just see what it does

3182
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:34,240
just see what it does
 

3183
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,069
just see what it does
and he was surprised because the same

3184
00:50:36,069 --> 00:50:36,079
and he was surprised because the same
 

3185
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:38,870
and he was surprised because the same
techniques he was using for doing

3186
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:38,880
techniques he was using for doing
 

3187
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,150
techniques he was using for doing
the same calculations quantum

3188
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:40,160
the same calculations quantum
 

3189
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,549
the same calculations quantum
electrodynamics when applied to gravity

3190
00:50:42,549 --> 00:50:42,559
electrodynamics when applied to gravity
 

3191
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:46,150
electrodynamics when applied to gravity
failed the formula seemed to make sense

3192
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:46,160
failed the formula seemed to make sense
 

3193
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,670
failed the formula seemed to make sense
but he had to do some integrals and he

3194
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:47,680
but he had to do some integrals and he
 

3195
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:48,950
but he had to do some integrals and he
found that when he does those integrals

3196
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:48,960
found that when he does those integrals
 

3197
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,950
found that when he does those integrals
he got infinity

3198
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:50,960
he got infinity
 

3199
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,470
he got infinity
and it didn't make any sense now there

3200
00:50:52,470 --> 00:50:52,480
and it didn't make any sense now there
 

3201
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:53,829
and it didn't make any sense now there
are similar infinities in the other

3202
00:50:53,829 --> 00:50:53,839
are similar infinities in the other
 

3203
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:55,349
are similar infinities in the other
pieces that but he had managed to make

3204
00:50:55,349 --> 00:50:55,359
pieces that but he had managed to make
 

3205
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:56,870
pieces that but he had managed to make
sense out of those before

3206
00:50:56,870 --> 00:50:56,880
sense out of those before
 

3207
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,190
sense out of those before
this was no way he could make sense out

3208
00:50:59,190 --> 00:50:59,200
this was no way he could make sense out
 

3209
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,910
this was no way he could make sense out
of it he just didn't know what to do

3210
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:01,920
of it he just didn't know what to do
 

3211
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,510
of it he just didn't know what to do
he didn't feel as an urgent issue

3212
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:03,520
he didn't feel as an urgent issue
 

3213
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,670
he didn't feel as an urgent issue
because nobody could do the experiment

3214
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:05,680
because nobody could do the experiment
 

3215
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,430
because nobody could do the experiment
so he was kind of said okay there's this

3216
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:07,440
so he was kind of said okay there's this
 

3217
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,710
so he was kind of said okay there's this
thing but okay we don't know how to

3218
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:08,720
thing but okay we don't know how to
 

3219
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,150
thing but okay we don't know how to
exactly do it but

3220
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:10,160
exactly do it but
 

3221
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,230
exactly do it but
but that's the way it is so in some

3222
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:12,240
but that's the way it is so in some
 

3223
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,990
but that's the way it is so in some
sense a natural conclusion

3224
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:14,000
sense a natural conclusion
 

3225
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,829
sense a natural conclusion
from what feynman did could have been

3226
00:51:15,829 --> 00:51:15,839
from what feynman did could have been
 

3227
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:18,069
from what feynman did could have been
like gravity cannot be consistent with

3228
00:51:18,069 --> 00:51:18,079
like gravity cannot be consistent with
 

3229
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:19,270
like gravity cannot be consistent with
quantum theory

3230
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:19,280
quantum theory
 

3231
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,790
quantum theory
but that cannot be the case because

3232
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:20,800
but that cannot be the case because
 

3233
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,150
but that cannot be the case because
gravity is in our universe quantum

3234
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:22,160
gravity is in our universe quantum
 

3235
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,270
gravity is in our universe quantum
mechanics is our universe they both

3236
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:23,280
mechanics is our universe they both
 

3237
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,510
mechanics is our universe they both
together somehow it should work

3238
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:25,520
together somehow it should work
 

3239
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,990
together somehow it should work
so it's not acceptable to say you know

3240
00:51:27,990 --> 00:51:28,000
so it's not acceptable to say you know
 

3241
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,589
so it's not acceptable to say you know
they don't work together so

3242
00:51:29,589 --> 00:51:29,599
they don't work together so
 

3243
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:31,270
they don't work together so
so that was a puzzle how does it

3244
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:31,280
so that was a puzzle how does it
 

3245
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,109
so that was a puzzle how does it
possibly work it was

3246
00:51:33,109 --> 00:51:33,119
possibly work it was
 

3247
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:36,710
possibly work it was
left open and then we get to the string

3248
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:36,720
left open and then we get to the string
 

3249
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,390
left open and then we get to the string
theory so this is the puzzle of quantum

3250
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:38,400
theory so this is the puzzle of quantum
 

3251
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,069
theory so this is the puzzle of quantum
gravity the particle description of

3252
00:51:40,069 --> 00:51:40,079
gravity the particle description of
 

3253
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:41,349
gravity the particle description of
quantum gravity fails

3254
00:51:41,349 --> 00:51:41,359
quantum gravity fails
 

3255
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:44,069
quantum gravity fails
so the infinity shows up what do we do

3256
00:51:44,069 --> 00:51:44,079
so the infinity shows up what do we do
 

3257
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:45,750
so the infinity shows up what do we do
what do we do with infinity

3258
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:45,760
what do we do with infinity
 

3259
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,349
what do we do with infinity
let's get to the fun part let's talk

3260
00:51:47,349 --> 00:51:47,359
let's get to the fun part let's talk
 

3261
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:49,990
let's get to the fun part let's talk
about string theory yes

3262
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:50,000
about string theory yes
 

3263
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,190
about string theory yes
uh let's uh discuss some

3264
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:53,200
uh let's uh discuss some
 

3265
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,230
uh let's uh discuss some
technical basics of uh string theory

3266

technical basics of uh string theory
 

3267
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,670
technical basics of uh string theory
what is string theory

3268
00:51:57,670 --> 00:51:57,680
what is string theory
 

3269
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,910
what is string theory
what is the string how many dimensions

3270
00:51:59,910 --> 00:51:59,920
what is the string how many dimensions
 

3271
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:00,950
what is the string how many dimensions
are we talking about

3272
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:00,960
are we talking about
 

3273
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,030
are we talking about
what are the different states how do we

3274
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:03,040
what are the different states how do we
 

3275
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,950
what are the different states how do we
represent the elementary particles

3276
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:04,960
represent the elementary particles
 

3277
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,990
represent the elementary particles
and the laws of physics using this

3278
00:52:07,990 --> 00:52:08,000
and the laws of physics using this
 

3279
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,069
and the laws of physics using this
new framework so string theory

3280
00:52:12,069 --> 00:52:12,079
new framework so string theory
 

3281
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:14,150
new framework so string theory
is the idea that the fundamental

3282
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:14,160
is the idea that the fundamental
 

3283
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,109
is the idea that the fundamental
entities are not

3284
00:52:15,109 --> 00:52:15,119
entities are not
 

3285
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:17,910
entities are not
particles but extended higher

3286
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:17,920
particles but extended higher
 

3287
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,829
particles but extended higher
dimensional objects like one-dimensional

3288
00:52:19,829 --> 00:52:19,839
dimensional objects like one-dimensional
 

3289
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:20,950
dimensional objects like one-dimensional
strings

3290
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:20,960
strings
 

3291
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,589
strings
like loops these loops could be open

3292
00:52:23,589 --> 00:52:23,599
like loops these loops could be open
 

3293
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:24,230
like loops these loops could be open
like

3294
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:24,240
like
 

3295
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,109
like
with two ends like an interval or a

3296
00:52:27,109 --> 00:52:27,119
with two ends like an interval or a
 

3297
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:28,069
with two ends like an interval or a
circle

3298
00:52:28,069 --> 00:52:28,079
circle
 

3299
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:29,990
circle
without any ends so and they're

3300
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:30,000
without any ends so and they're
 

3301
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,630
without any ends so and they're
vibrating and moving around in space

3302
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:32,640
vibrating and moving around in space
 

3303
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:35,910
vibrating and moving around in space
so how big they are well you can of

3304
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:35,920
so how big they are well you can of
 

3305
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,510
so how big they are well you can of
course stretch it and make it big

3306
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:37,520
course stretch it and make it big
 

3307
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,270
course stretch it and make it big
or you can just let it be whatever it

3308
00:52:39,270 --> 00:52:39,280
or you can just let it be whatever it
 

3309
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,190
or you can just let it be whatever it
wants it can be as small as a point

3310
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:41,200
wants it can be as small as a point
 

3311
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:41,910
wants it can be as small as a point
because the

3312
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:41,920
because the
 

3313
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,870
because the
circle can shrink to a point and be very

3314
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:44,880
circle can shrink to a point and be very
 

3315
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:45,349
circle can shrink to a point and be very
light

3316
00:52:45,349 --> 00:52:45,359
light
 

3317
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:46,950
light
or you can you know stretch it and

3318
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:46,960
or you can you know stretch it and
 

3319
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,470
or you can you know stretch it and
becomes very massive or it could

3320
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:48,480
becomes very massive or it could
 

3321
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,309
becomes very massive or it could
oscillate and become massive that way so

3322
00:52:50,309 --> 00:52:50,319
oscillate and become massive that way so
 

3323
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:51,190
oscillate and become massive that way so
depends on

3324
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:51,200
depends on
 

3325
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,549
depends on
which kind of state you have in fact

3326
00:52:52,549 --> 00:52:52,559
which kind of state you have in fact
 

3327
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:54,549
which kind of state you have in fact
this string can have infinitely many

3328
00:52:54,549 --> 00:52:54,559
this string can have infinitely many
 

3329
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:55,829
this string can have infinitely many
modes depending on which kind of

3330
00:52:55,829 --> 00:52:55,839
modes depending on which kind of
 

3331
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,829
modes depending on which kind of
oscillation it's doing like a guitar

3332
00:52:57,829 --> 00:52:57,839
oscillation it's doing like a guitar
 

3333
00:52:57,839 --> 00:52:59,349
oscillation it's doing like a guitar
has different harmonics string has

3334
00:52:59,349 --> 00:52:59,359
has different harmonics string has
 

3335
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:01,190
has different harmonics string has
different harmonics but for the string

3336
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:01,200
different harmonics but for the string
 

3337
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,870
different harmonics but for the string
each harmonic is a particle

3338
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:02,880
each harmonic is a particle
 

3339
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,790
each harmonic is a particle
so each particle will give you ah this

3340
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:04,800
so each particle will give you ah this
 

3341
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,390
so each particle will give you ah this
is a more massive harmonic this is a

3342
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:06,400
is a more massive harmonic this is a
 

3343
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,349
is a more massive harmonic this is a
less mass

3344
00:53:07,349 --> 00:53:07,359
less mass
 

3345
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:09,190
less mass
so the lightest harmonic so to speak is

3346
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:09,200
so the lightest harmonic so to speak is
 

3347
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,630
so the lightest harmonic so to speak is
no harmonics which means like

3348
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:10,640
no harmonics which means like
 

3349
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,190
no harmonics which means like
a string strung to a point and then it

3350
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:13,200
a string strung to a point and then it
 

3351
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,150
a string strung to a point and then it
becomes like a

3352
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:14,160
becomes like a
 

3353
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,069
becomes like a
massless particles or light particles

3354
00:53:16,069 --> 00:53:16,079
massless particles or light particles
 

3355
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:17,349
massless particles or light particles
like photon

3356
00:53:17,349 --> 00:53:17,359
like photon
 

3357
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:20,390
like photon
and graviton and so forth so when when

3358
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:20,400
and graviton and so forth so when when
 

3359
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,589
and graviton and so forth so when when
you look at

3360
00:53:21,589 --> 00:53:21,599
you look at
 

3361
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:23,990
you look at
tiny strings which are strong to a point

3362
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:24,000
tiny strings which are strong to a point
 

3363
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,349
tiny strings which are strong to a point
the lightest ones

3364
00:53:25,349 --> 00:53:25,359
the lightest ones
 

3365
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:27,190
the lightest ones
they look like the particles that we we

3366
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:27,200
they look like the particles that we we
 

3367
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,630
they look like the particles that we we
think they're like particles in other

3368
00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:28,640
think they're like particles in other
 

3369
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:29,190
think they're like particles in other
words

3370
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:29,200
words
 

3371
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,109
words
from far away they look like a point but

3372
00:53:31,109 --> 00:53:31,119
from far away they look like a point but
 

3373
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:32,390
from far away they look like a point but
of course if you zoom in there's this

3374
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:32,400
of course if you zoom in there's this
 

3375
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,829
of course if you zoom in there's this
tiny little you know little circle

3376
00:53:33,829 --> 00:53:33,839
tiny little you know little circle
 

3377
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:34,950
tiny little you know little circle
that's there

3378
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:34,960
that's there
 

3379
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,190
that's there
that's strong to almost a point should

3380
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:37,200
that's strong to almost a point should
 

3381
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,470
that's strong to almost a point should
we be imagining

3382
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:38,480
we be imagining
 

3383
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,710
we be imagining
this is to the visual intuition should

3384
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:40,720
this is to the visual intuition should
 

3385
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:41,750
this is to the visual intuition should
we be imagining

3386
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:41,760
we be imagining
 

3387
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,670
we be imagining
literally strings that are potentially

3388
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:43,680
literally strings that are potentially
 

3389
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,349
literally strings that are potentially
connected as a loop

3390
00:53:45,349 --> 00:53:45,359
connected as a loop
 

3391
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:49,109
connected as a loop
or not when you and when somebody

3392
00:53:49,109 --> 00:53:49,119
or not when you and when somebody
 

3393
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:50,549
or not when you and when somebody
outside of physics

3394
00:53:50,549 --> 00:53:50,559
outside of physics
 

3395
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:53,589
outside of physics
is imagining a basic element of string

3396
00:53:53,589 --> 00:53:53,599
is imagining a basic element of string
 

3397
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:56,390
is imagining a basic element of string
theory which is a string

3398
00:53:56,390 --> 00:53:56,400
theory which is a string
 

3399
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,069
theory which is a string
should we literally be thinking about a

3400
00:53:58,069 --> 00:53:58,079
should we literally be thinking about a
 

3401
00:53:58,079 --> 00:53:59,829
should we literally be thinking about a
string yes you should literally think

3402
00:53:59,829 --> 00:53:59,839
string yes you should literally think
 

3403
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:00,470
string yes you should literally think
about string

3404
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:00,480
about string
 

3405
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,030
about string
but string with zero thickness with zero

3406
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:03,040
but string with zero thickness with zero
 

3407
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:03,829
but string with zero thickness with zero
thickness

3408
00:54:03,829 --> 00:54:03,839
thickness
 

3409
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:05,829
thickness
so notice it's a it's a it's a loop of

3410
00:54:05,829 --> 00:54:05,839
so notice it's a it's a it's a loop of
 

3411
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:07,589
so notice it's a it's a it's a loop of
energy so to speak

3412
00:54:07,589 --> 00:54:07,599
energy so to speak
 

3413
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:09,270
energy so to speak
if you can think of it that way and so

3414
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:09,280
if you can think of it that way and so
 

3415
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,710
if you can think of it that way and so
there's a tension like the regular

3416
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:10,720
there's a tension like the regular
 

3417
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,150
there's a tension like the regular
string if you pull it there's you know

3418
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:12,160
string if you pull it there's you know
 

3419
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,910
string if you pull it there's you know
you have to you have to stretch it

3420
00:54:13,910 --> 00:54:13,920
you have to you have to stretch it
 

3421
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,190
you have to you have to stretch it
but it's not like a thickness like

3422
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:15,200
but it's not like a thickness like
 

3423
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,549
but it's not like a thickness like
you're made of something it's just

3424
00:54:16,549 --> 00:54:16,559
you're made of something it's just
 

3425
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:17,670
you're made of something it's just
energy

3426
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:17,680
energy
 

3427
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,349
energy
it's not made of atoms or something like

3428
00:54:19,349 --> 00:54:19,359
it's not made of atoms or something like
 

3429

all right but what is this where is this

3618
00:57:13,829 --> 00:57:13,839
all right but what is this where is this
 

3619
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:15,990
all right but what is this where is this
coming from which which kind of physics

everything was working beautifully for
particle physics

3754
00:59:20,789 --> 00:59:20,799
particle physics
 

3755
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:23,030
particle physics
and so that was the shining golden age

3756
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:23,040
and so that was the shining golden age
 

3757
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,549
and so that was the shining golden age
of quantum field theory and all the

3758
00:59:24,549 --> 00:59:24,559
of quantum field theory and all the
 

3759
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:26,950
of quantum field theory and all the
experiments standard model this and that

3760
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:26,960
experiments standard model this and that
 

3761
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,870
experiments standard model this and that
unification and spontaneous symmetry

3762
00:59:28,870 --> 00:59:28,880
unification and spontaneous symmetry
 

3763
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,069
unification and spontaneous symmetry
breaking was taking place all of them

3764
00:59:30,069 --> 00:59:30,079
breaking was taking place all of them
 

3765
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:30,870
breaking was taking place all of them
was nice

3766
00:59:30,870 --> 00:59:30,880
was nice
 

3767
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:32,390
was nice
this was kind of like a sideshow and

3768
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:32,400
this was kind of like a sideshow and
 

3769
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,230
this was kind of like a sideshow and
nobody was paying so much attention

3770
00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:34,240
nobody was paying so much attention
 

3771
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,470
nobody was paying so much attention
this exotic string is needed for quantum

3772
00:59:36,470 --> 00:59:36,480
this exotic string is needed for quantum
 

3773
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,069
this exotic string is needed for quantum
gravity ah maybe there's other ways

3774
00:59:38,069 --> 00:59:38,079
gravity ah maybe there's other ways
 

3775
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:39,349
gravity ah maybe there's other ways
maybe we should do something else

3776
00:59:39,349 --> 00:59:39,359
maybe we should do something else
 

3777
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:41,829
maybe we should do something else
so yeah it wasn't paid much attention to

3778
00:59:41,829 --> 00:59:41,839
so yeah it wasn't paid much attention to
 

3779
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:42,390
so yeah it wasn't paid much attention to
and

3780
00:59:42,390 --> 00:59:42,400
and
 

3781
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,150
and
this took a little bit more effort to

3782
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:44,160
this took a little bit more effort to
 

3783
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,990
this took a little bit more effort to
try to actually connect it to

3784
00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:46,000
try to actually connect it to
 

3785
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,710
try to actually connect it to
to the reality there are a few more

3786
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:48,720
to the reality there are a few more
 

3787
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:49,750
to the reality there are a few more
steps first of all

3788
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:49,760
steps first of all
 

3789
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,829
steps first of all
there was a puzzle that you were getting

3790
00:59:51,829 --> 00:59:51,839
there was a puzzle that you were getting
 

3791
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:53,829
there was a puzzle that you were getting
extra dimensions

3792
00:59:53,829 --> 00:59:53,839
extra dimensions
 

3793
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:55,829
extra dimensions
string was not working well with three

3794
00:59:55,829 --> 00:59:55,839
string was not working well with three
 

3795
00:59:55,839 --> 00:59:57,670
string was not working well with three
spatial dimensions on one time

3796
00:59:57,670 --> 00:59:57,680
spatial dimensions on one time
 

3797
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:00,870
spatial dimensions on one time
it needed extra dimension now

3798
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:00,880
it needed extra dimension now
 

3799
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,390
it needed extra dimension now
there are different versions of strings

3800
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:02,400
there are different versions of strings
 

3801
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,990
there are different versions of strings
but the version that ended up being

3802
01:00:03,990 --> 01:00:04,000
but the version that ended up being
 

3803
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:04,630
but the version that ended up being
related

3804
01:00:04,630 --> 01:00:04,640
related
 

3805
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:06,870
related
to having particles like electron what

3806
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:06,880
to having particles like electron what
 

3807
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,150
to having particles like electron what
we call fermions

3808
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:08,160
we call fermions
 

3809
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,630
we call fermions
needed 10 dimensions what we call super

3810
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:10,640
needed 10 dimensions what we call super
 

3811
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,150
needed 10 dimensions what we call super
string

3812
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:12,160
string
 

3813
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,829
string
now why super white the word super it

3814
01:00:13,829 --> 01:00:13,839
now why super white the word super it
 

3815
01:00:13,839 --> 01:00:15,430
now why super white the word super it
turns out this

3816
01:00:15,430 --> 01:00:15,440
turns out this
 

3817
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,589
turns out this
uh this version of the string which had

3818
01:00:17,589 --> 01:00:17,599
uh this version of the string which had
 

3819
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:18,549
uh this version of the string which had
fermions

3820
01:00:18,549 --> 01:00:18,559
fermions
 

3821
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:21,750
fermions
had an extra symmetry which we call

3822
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:21,760
had an extra symmetry which we call
 

3823
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,829
had an extra symmetry which we call
supersymmetry

3824
01:00:23,829 --> 01:00:23,839
supersymmetry
 

3825
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:26,150
supersymmetry
this is a symmetry between a particle

3826
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:26,160
this is a symmetry between a particle
 

3827
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,710
this is a symmetry between a particle
and another particle with exactly the

3828
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:28,720
and another particle with exactly the
 

3829
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:30,230
and another particle with exactly the
same properties same mass

3830
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:30,240
same properties same mass
 

3831
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,390
same properties same mass
same charge etc the only difference is

3832
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:32,400
same charge etc the only difference is
 

3833
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,829
same charge etc the only difference is
that one of them has a little different

3834
01:00:33,829 --> 01:00:33,839
that one of them has a little different
 

3835
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:34,309
that one of them has a little different
spin

3836
01:00:34,309 --> 01:00:34,319
spin
 

3837
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:36,390
spin
than the other one and one and one of

3838
01:00:36,390 --> 01:00:36,400
than the other one and one and one of
 

3839
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,589
than the other one and one and one of
them is the boson

3840
01:00:37,589 --> 01:00:37,599
them is the boson
 

3841
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:39,430
them is the boson
one of them is a fermion because of that

3842
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:39,440
one of them is a fermion because of that
 

3843
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:40,950
one of them is a fermion because of that
shift of spin

3844
01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:40,960
shift of spin
 

3845
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,390
shift of spin
otherwise they're identical so there was

3846
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:42,400
otherwise they're identical so there was
 

3847
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,630
otherwise they're identical so there was
this symmetry string theory

3848
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:44,640
this symmetry string theory
 

3849
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,870
this symmetry string theory
had the symmetry in fact supersymmetry

3850
01:00:46,870 --> 01:00:46,880
had the symmetry in fact supersymmetry
 

3851
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,230
had the symmetry in fact supersymmetry
was discovered

3852
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:48,240
was discovered
 

3853
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:51,430
was discovered
through string theory theoretically

3854
01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:51,440
through string theory theoretically
 

3855
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:52,950
through string theory theoretically
so theoretically the first place that

3856
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:52,960
so theoretically the first place that
 

3857
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,549
so theoretically the first place that
this was observed when when you were

3858
01:00:54,549 --> 01:00:54,559
this was observed when when you were
 

3859
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:55,670
this was observed when when you were
describing these

3860
01:00:55,670 --> 01:00:55,680
describing these
 

3861
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:58,470
describing these
fermionic strings so that was the

3862
01:00:58,470 --> 01:00:58,480
fermionic strings so that was the
 

3863
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,150
fermionic strings so that was the
beginning of the study of supersymmetry

3864
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:00,160
beginning of the study of supersymmetry
 

3865
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,069
beginning of the study of supersymmetry
was the via string theory

3866
01:01:02,069 --> 01:01:02,079
was the via string theory
 

3867
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:04,870
was the via string theory
and then it had remarkable properties

3868
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:04,880
and then it had remarkable properties
 

3869
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:06,309
and then it had remarkable properties
that you know this symmetry

3870
01:01:06,309 --> 01:01:06,319
that you know this symmetry
 

3871
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:08,150
that you know this symmetry
meant and so forth that people began

3872
01:01:08,150 --> 01:01:08,160
meant and so forth that people began
 

3873
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,549
meant and so forth that people began
studying supersymmetry after that

3874
01:01:10,549 --> 01:01:10,559
studying supersymmetry after that
 

3875
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:12,470
studying supersymmetry after that
and that was continuation that was kind

3876
01:01:12,470 --> 01:01:12,480
and that was continuation that was kind
 

3877
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:14,150
and that was continuation that was kind
of a tangent direction at the beginning

3878
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:14,160
of a tangent direction at the beginning
 

3879
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:16,549
of a tangent direction at the beginning
for string theory but people in particle

3880
01:01:16,549 --> 01:01:16,559
for string theory but people in particle
 

3881
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:18,069
for string theory but people in particle
physics started also thinking oh

3882
01:01:18,069 --> 01:01:18,079
physics started also thinking oh
 

3883
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:19,430
physics started also thinking oh
supersymmetry is great let's see if we

3884
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:19,440
supersymmetry is great let's see if we
 

3885
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:20,230
supersymmetry is great let's see if we
can have

3886
01:01:20,230 --> 01:01:20,240
can have
 

3887
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:22,069
can have
supersymmetry in particle physics and so

3888
01:01:22,069 --> 01:01:22,079
supersymmetry in particle physics and so
 

3889
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:23,910
supersymmetry in particle physics and so
forth forget about strings and they

3890
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:23,920
forth forget about strings and they
 

3891
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,670
forth forget about strings and they
developed on a different track as well

3892
01:01:25,670 --> 01:01:25,680
developed on a different track as well
 

3893
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,910
developed on a different track as well
supersymmetry in different models became

3894
01:01:27,910 --> 01:01:27,920
supersymmetry in different models became
 

3895
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,109
supersymmetry in different models became
a subject on its own right

3896
01:01:29,109 --> 01:01:29,119
a subject on its own right
 

3897
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:31,030
a subject on its own right
understanding supersymmetry and what

3898
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:31,040
understanding supersymmetry and what
 

3899
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,150
understanding supersymmetry and what
does this mean

3900
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:32,160
does this mean
 

3901
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,069
does this mean
because it unified bosons and fermi and

3902
01:01:34,069 --> 01:01:34,079
because it unified bosons and fermi and
 

3903
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:35,910
because it unified bosons and fermi and
unifies some ideas together

3904
01:01:35,910 --> 01:01:35,920
unifies some ideas together
 

3905
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:38,150
unifies some ideas together
so photon is a boson electron is a

3906
01:01:38,150 --> 01:01:38,160
so photon is a boson electron is a
 

3907
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,030
so photon is a boson electron is a
fermion

3908
01:01:39,030 --> 01:01:39,040
fermion
 

3909
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:40,549
fermion
could things like that be somehow

3910
01:01:40,549 --> 01:01:40,559
could things like that be somehow
 

3911
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:43,030
could things like that be somehow
related it was a kind of a natural kind

3912
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:43,040
related it was a kind of a natural kind
 

3913
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,870
related it was a kind of a natural kind
of a question to try to kind of unify

3914
01:01:44,870 --> 01:01:44,880
of a question to try to kind of unify
 

3915
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:45,510
of a question to try to kind of unify
because

3916
01:01:45,510 --> 01:01:45,520
because
 

3917
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:48,549
because
in physics we love unification now

3918
01:01:48,549 --> 01:01:48,559
in physics we love unification now
 

3919
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:50,230
in physics we love unification now
gradually string theory was beginning to

3920
01:01:50,230 --> 01:01:50,240
gradually string theory was beginning to
 

3921
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,910
gradually string theory was beginning to
show signs of unification it had

3922
01:01:51,910 --> 01:01:51,920
show signs of unification it had
 

3923
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:52,870
show signs of unification it had
graviton

3924
01:01:52,870 --> 01:01:52,880
graviton
 

3925
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,789
graviton
but people found that you also have

3926
01:01:54,789 --> 01:01:54,799
but people found that you also have
 

3927
01:01:54,799 --> 01:01:56,390
but people found that you also have
things like photons in them

3928
01:01:56,390 --> 01:01:56,400
things like photons in them
 

3929
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:57,990
things like photons in them
different excitations of string behave

3930
01:01:57,990 --> 01:01:58,000
different excitations of string behave
 

3931
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,910
different excitations of string behave
like photons another one behaves like

3932
01:01:59,910 --> 01:01:59,920
like photons another one behaves like
 

3933
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:00,950
like photons another one behaves like
electron

3934
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:00,960
electron
 

3935
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:04,069
electron
so a single string was unifying all

3936
01:02:04,069 --> 01:02:04,079
so a single string was unifying all
 

3937
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:06,230
so a single string was unifying all
these particles into one object

3938
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:06,240
these particles into one object
 

3939
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:09,589
these particles into one object
that's remarkable it's in ten dimensions

3940
01:02:09,589 --> 01:02:09,599
that's remarkable it's in ten dimensions
 

3941
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:10,470
that's remarkable it's in ten dimensions
though

3942
01:02:10,470 --> 01:02:10,480
though
 

3943
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,150
though
it is not our universe because we live

3944
01:02:12,150 --> 01:02:12,160
it is not our universe because we live
 

3945
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:13,750
it is not our universe because we live
in three plus one dimension how could

3946
01:02:13,750 --> 01:02:13,760
in three plus one dimension how could
 

3947
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:15,589
in three plus one dimension how could
that be possibly true

3948
01:02:15,589 --> 01:02:15,599
that be possibly true
 

3949
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:19,109
that be possibly true
so this was a conundrum it was elegant

3950
01:02:19,109 --> 01:02:19,119
so this was a conundrum it was elegant
 

3951
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:20,789
so this was a conundrum it was elegant
it was beautiful but it was very

3952
01:02:20,789 --> 01:02:20,799
it was beautiful but it was very
 

3953
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:21,829
it was beautiful but it was very
specific

3954
01:02:21,829 --> 01:02:21,839
specific
 

3955
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:23,510
specific
about which dimension you're getting

3956
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:23,520
about which dimension you're getting
 

3957
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:24,950
about which dimension you're getting
which structure you're getting

3958
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:24,960
which structure you're getting
 

3959
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,950
which structure you're getting
it wasn't saying oh you just put d

3960
01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:26,960
it wasn't saying oh you just put d
 

3961
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,390
it wasn't saying oh you just put d
equals to four you'll get your space

3962
01:02:28,390 --> 01:02:28,400
equals to four you'll get your space
 

3963
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:29,910
equals to four you'll get your space
time dimension that you want no

3964
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:29,920
time dimension that you want no
 

3965
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:31,829
time dimension that you want no
it didn't like that it said i want ten

3966
01:02:31,829 --> 01:02:31,839
it didn't like that it said i want ten
 

3967
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:34,230
it didn't like that it said i want ten
dimensions and that's the way it is

3968
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:34,240
dimensions and that's the way it is
 

3969
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:36,390
dimensions and that's the way it is
so it was very specific now so people

3970
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:36,400
so it was very specific now so people
 

3971
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,390
so it was very specific now so people
try to reconcile this by the idea that

3972
01:02:38,390 --> 01:02:38,400
try to reconcile this by the idea that
 

3973
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:39,270
try to reconcile this by the idea that
you know

3974
01:02:39,270 --> 01:02:39,280
you know
 

3975
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:42,069
you know
maybe these extra dimensions are tiny so

3976
01:02:42,069 --> 01:02:42,079
maybe these extra dimensions are tiny so
 

3977
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:42,950
maybe these extra dimensions are tiny so
if you take

3978
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:42,960
if you take
 

3979
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:45,349
if you take
three macroscopic spatial dimensions on

3980
01:02:45,349 --> 01:02:45,359
three macroscopic spatial dimensions on
 

3981
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:46,309
three macroscopic spatial dimensions on
one time

3982
01:02:46,309 --> 01:02:46,319
one time
 

3983
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:49,349
one time
and six extra tiny spatial dimensions

3984
01:02:49,349 --> 01:02:49,359
and six extra tiny spatial dimensions
 

3985
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:52,390
and six extra tiny spatial dimensions
like tiny spheres or tiny circles then

3986
01:02:52,390 --> 01:02:52,400
like tiny spheres or tiny circles then
 

3987
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:55,670
like tiny spheres or tiny circles then
it avoids contradiction with manifest

3988
01:02:55,670 --> 01:02:55,680
it avoids contradiction with manifest
 

3989
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:56,950
it avoids contradiction with manifest
fact that we haven't seen extra

a string observed in experiments no
 

4005
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:12,870
a string observed in experiments no
because it's so small

4006
01:03:12,870 --> 01:03:12,880
because it's so small
 

4007
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,829
because it's so small
so it's beginning to sound a little bit

4008
01:03:14,829 --> 01:03:14,839
so it's beginning to sound a little bit
 

4009
01:03:14,839 --> 01:03:16,069
so it's beginning to sound a little bit
funny

4010
01:03:16,069 --> 01:03:16,079
funny
 

4011
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:18,950
funny
similar feeling to the way perhaps drag

4012
01:03:18,950 --> 01:03:18,960
similar feeling to the way perhaps drag
 

4013
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,190
similar feeling to the way perhaps drag
had felt about this positron plus or

4014
01:03:21,190 --> 01:03:21,200
had felt about this positron plus or
 

4015
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,950
had felt about this positron plus or
minus you know it was beginning to sound

4016
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:22,960
minus you know it was beginning to sound
 

4017
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,069
minus you know it was beginning to sound
a little bit like

4018
01:03:24,069 --> 01:03:24,079
a little bit like
 

4019
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:25,430
a little bit like
oh yeah not only i have to have ten

4020
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:25,440
oh yeah not only i have to have ten
 

4021
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:26,950
oh yeah not only i have to have ten
dimension but i also have to this i have

4022
01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:26,960
dimension but i also have to this i have
 

4023
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,549
dimension but i also have to this i have
to also listen

4024
01:03:28,549 --> 01:03:28,559
to also listen
 

4025
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:30,630
to also listen
and so you so conservative physicists

4026
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:30,640
and so you so conservative physicists
 

4027
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:31,829
and so you so conservative physicists
would say um

4028
01:03:31,829 --> 01:03:31,839
would say um
 

4029
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:32,950
would say um
you know i haven't seen these

4030
01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:32,960
you know i haven't seen these
 

4031
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:35,190
you know i haven't seen these
experiments i don't know if they are

4032
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:35,200
experiments i don't know if they are
 

4033
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,430
experiments i don't know if they are
really there are you pulling my leg

4034
01:03:37,430 --> 01:03:37,440
really there are you pulling my leg
 

4035
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,029
really there are you pulling my leg
i do you want me to imagine things that

4036
01:03:39,029 --> 01:03:39,039
i do you want me to imagine things that
 

4037
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:41,589
i do you want me to imagine things that
are not there so this was an attitude of

4038
01:03:41,589 --> 01:03:41,599
are not there so this was an attitude of
 

4039
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:42,789
are not there so this was an attitude of
some physicist

4040
01:03:42,789 --> 01:03:42,799
some physicist
 

4041
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:45,270
some physicist
towards string theory despite the fact

but still was this skepticism you're

4048
01:03:51,029 --> 01:03:51,039
but still was this skepticism you're
 

4049
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,309
but still was this skepticism you're
putting all these things that you want

01:03:52,309 --> 01:03:52,319
putting all these things that you want
 

4051
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:53,670
putting all these things that you want
me to imagine there are these extra

01:03:53,670 --> 01:03:53,680
me to imagine there are these extra
 

4053
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,910
me to imagine there are these extra
dimensions that i cannot see uh-huh

4054
01:03:55,910 --> 01:03:55,920
dimensions that i cannot see uh-huh
 

4055
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,190
dimensions that i cannot see uh-huh
and you want me to believe that stream

4056
01:03:57,190 --> 01:03:57,200
and you want me to believe that stream
 

4057
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,630
and you want me to believe that stream
that you have not even seen experiments

4058
01:03:58,630 --> 01:03:58,640
that you have not even seen experiments
 

4059
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,150
that you have not even seen experiments
are real uh-huh okay what else do you

4060
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:00,160
are real uh-huh okay what else do you
 

4061
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:01,029
are real uh-huh okay what else do you
want me to believe

4062
01:04:01,029 --> 01:04:01,039
want me to believe
 

4063
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:02,470
want me to believe
so it was kind of beginning to sound a

4064
01:04:02,470 --> 01:04:02,480
so it was kind of beginning to sound a
 

4065
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,150
so it was kind of beginning to sound a
little funny now

4066
01:04:04,150 --> 01:04:04,160
little funny now
 

4067
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,069
little funny now
i was i would pass forward forward a

became the mainstream
of efforts to unify the forces and

01:05:12,799 --> 01:05:14,390
following the work of wickenstein who
had predicted

4140
01:05:14,390 --> 01:05:14,400
had predicted
 

4141
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:17,829
had predicted
that black holes have entropy

4142
01:05:17,829 --> 01:05:17,839
that black holes have entropy
 

4143
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:19,750
that black holes have entropy
so wickenstein had tried to attach the

4144
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:19,760
so wickenstein had tried to attach the
 

4145
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:21,430
so wickenstein had tried to attach the
entropy to the black hole

4146
01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:21,440
entropy to the black hole
 

4147
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,109
entropy to the black hole
if you throw something into that black

4148
01:05:23,109 --> 01:05:23,119
if you throw something into that black
 

4149
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:25,270
if you throw something into that black
hole the entropy seems to go down

4150
01:05:25,270 --> 01:05:25,280
hole the entropy seems to go down
 

4151
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:26,950
hole the entropy seems to go down
because you have something entropy in

4152
01:05:26,950 --> 01:05:26,960
because you have something entropy in
 

4153
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:28,789
because you have something entropy in
outside the black hole and you throw it

4154
01:05:28,789 --> 01:05:28,799
outside the black hole and you throw it
 

4155
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:30,710
outside the black hole and you throw it
entropy was you it black was unique so

4156
01:05:30,710 --> 01:05:30,720
entropy was you it black was unique so
 

4157
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:31,990
entropy was you it black was unique so
the entropy did not have any

4158
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:32,000
the entropy did not have any
 

4159
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,990
the entropy did not have any
blackout no entropy so you seem the

4160
01:05:33,990 --> 01:05:34,000
blackout no entropy so you seem the
 

4161
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,470
blackout no entropy so you seem the
entropy seem to go down and so that's

4162
01:05:36,470 --> 01:05:36,480
entropy seem to go down and so that's
 

4163
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,470
entropy seem to go down and so that's
against the laws of thermodynamics so

4164
01:05:38,470 --> 01:05:38,480
against the laws of thermodynamics so
 

4165
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:39,990
against the laws of thermodynamics so
beckenstein was trying to say no no

4166
01:05:39,990 --> 01:05:40,000
beckenstein was trying to say no no
 

4167
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,150
beckenstein was trying to say no no
therefore black must have an entropy so

4168
01:05:42,150 --> 01:05:42,160
therefore black must have an entropy so
 

4169
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:43,349
therefore black must have an entropy so
he was trying to understand that he

4170
01:05:43,349 --> 01:05:43,359
he was trying to understand that he
 

4171
01:05:43,359 --> 01:05:45,190
he was trying to understand that he
found that if you assign

4172
01:05:45,190 --> 01:05:45,200
found that if you assign
 

4173
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,349
found that if you assign
entropy to the to be proportional to the

4174
01:05:47,349 --> 01:05:47,359
entropy to the to be proportional to the
 

4175
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:49,109
entropy to the to be proportional to the
area of the black hole it seems to work

4176
01:05:49,109 --> 01:05:49,119
area of the black hole it seems to work
 

4177
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:50,630
area of the black hole it seems to work
and then hawking

4178
01:05:50,630 --> 01:05:50,640
and then hawking
 

4179
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:52,950
and then hawking
found not only that's correct he found

4180
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:52,960
found not only that's correct he found
 

4181
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:54,549
found not only that's correct he found
the correct proportionality factor of

4182
01:05:54,549 --> 01:05:54,559
the correct proportionality factor of
 

4183
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:56,309
the correct proportionality factor of
factor of one quarter of the area and

4184
01:05:56,309 --> 01:05:56,319
factor of one quarter of the area and
 

4185
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:57,750
factor of one quarter of the area and
planck units is the

4186
01:05:57,750 --> 01:05:57,760
planck units is the
 

4187
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:59,910
planck units is the
correct amount of entropy and he gave an

4188
01:05:59,910 --> 01:05:59,920
correct amount of entropy and he gave an
 

4189
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:01,029
correct amount of entropy and he gave an
argument using

4190
01:06:01,029 --> 01:06:01,039
argument using
 

4191
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:03,750
argument using
quantum semi-classical arguments which

01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:03,760
quantum semi-classical arguments which
 

4193
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:05,270
quantum semi-classical arguments which
barely which means basically using a

4194
01:06:05,270 --> 01:06:05,280
barely which means basically using a
 

4195
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:06,789
barely which means basically using a
little bit of a quantum mechanics

4196
01:06:06,789 --> 01:06:06,799
little bit of a quantum mechanics
 

4197
01:06:06,799 --> 01:06:07,990
little bit of a quantum mechanics
because he didn't have the full quantum

4198
01:06:07,990 --> 01:06:08,000
because he didn't have the full quantum
 

4199
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,150
because he didn't have the full quantum
mechanics of string there he could do

4200
01:06:10,150 --> 01:06:10,160
mechanics of string there he could do
 

4201
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:11,990
mechanics of string there he could do
some aspects of approximate quantum

01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:14,880
so heuristic quantum arguments led to
 

4207
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:15,910
so heuristic quantum arguments led to

01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:46,230
and there was just one solution so where
are these

4244
01:06:46,230 --> 01:06:46,240
are these

01:06:52,630 --> 01:06:52,640
they were hidden somewhere so later in
 

4251
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:53,750
they were hidden somewhere so later in
string theory

4252
01:06:53,750 --> 01:06:53,760
string theory
 

4253
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,069
string theory
uh the work that we did with my

4254
01:06:56,069 --> 01:06:56,079
uh the work that we did with my
 

4255
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:57,510
uh the work that we did with my
colleague strong manager

4256
01:06:57,510 --> 01:06:57,520
colleague strong manager
 

4257
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:59,670
colleague strong manager
in particular showed that these

4258
01:06:59,670 --> 01:06:59,680
in particular showed that these
 

4259
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:02,069
in particular showed that these

dimensions
 

4265
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:08,230
dimensions
so the degrees of freedom are are hidden

4266
01:07:08,230 --> 01:07:08,240
so the degrees of freedom are are hidden
 

4267
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:10,069
so the degrees of freedom are are hidden
in terms of things like strings

4268
01:07:10,069 --> 01:07:10,079
in terms of things like strings

hidden dimensions
 

4273
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:15,670
hidden dimensions
and then we started counting how many

4274
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:15,680
and then we started counting how many
 

4275
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:17,430
and then we started counting how many
ways like the strings can wrap around

4276
01:07:17,430 --> 01:07:17,440
ways like the strings can wrap around
 

4277
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:18,470
ways like the strings can wrap around
this circle and the

01:07:18,470 --> 01:07:18,480
this circle and the
 

4279
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,069
this circle and the
extra dimension or that circle and

01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:20,079
extra dimension or that circle and
 

4281
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:21,510
extra dimension or that circle and
counted the microscopic degrees of

4282
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:21,520
counted the microscopic degrees of
 

4283
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:22,309
counted the microscopic degrees of

and lo and behold we got the microscopic

4286
01:07:24,390 --> 01:07:24,400
and lo and behold we got the microscopic
 

4287
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:25,510
and lo and behold we got the microscopic
degrees of freedom that

4288
01:07:25,510 --> 01:07:25,520
degrees of freedom that
 

4289
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,589
degrees of freedom that
hawking was predicting four dimensions

4290
01:07:27,589 --> 01:07:27,599
hawking was predicting four dimensions
 

4291
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:30,069
hawking was predicting four dimensions
so the extra dimensions became useful

4292
01:07:30,069 --> 01:07:30,079
so the extra dimensions became useful
 

4293
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:31,589
so the extra dimensions became useful
for resolving a puzzle in four

01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:31,599
for resolving a puzzle in four
 

4295
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:33,670
for resolving a puzzle in four

4297
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:35,430

like the the entropy in black holes
 

4329
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:11,109
like the the entropy in black holes
but what you said that to you a theory

4330
01:08:11,109 --> 01:08:11,119
but what you said that to you a theory
 

4331
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:13,190
but what you said that to you a theory
becomes

some of the analogies work first of all

4344
01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:25,920
some of the analogies work first of all
 

4345
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:28,630
some of the analogies work first of all
we do a lot of analogies

4346
01:08:28,630 --> 01:08:28,640
we do a lot of analogies
 

4347
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:31,189
we do a lot of analogies
and by analogies we build intuition so i

4348
01:08:31,189 --> 01:08:31,199
and by analogies we build intuition so i
 

4349
01:08:31,199 --> 01:08:33,110
and by analogies we build intuition so i
will i will start with this example

4350
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:33,120
will i will start with this example
 

4351
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,269
will i will start with this example
i will try to explain that if we are in

4352
01:08:35,269 --> 01:08:35,279
i will try to explain that if we are in
 

4353
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:37,349
i will try to explain that if we are in
10 dimensional space

4354
01:08:37,349 --> 01:08:37,359
10 dimensional space
 

4355
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:40,470
10 dimensional space
if we have a seven dimensional plane and

4356
01:08:40,470 --> 01:08:40,480
if we have a seven dimensional plane and
 

4357
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:42,709
if we have a seven dimensional plane and
eight dimensional plane

4358
01:08:42,709 --> 01:08:42,719
eight dimensional plane
 

4359
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:44,550
eight dimensional plane
we ask typically in what space do they

4360
01:08:44,550 --> 01:08:44,560
we ask typically in what space do they
 

4361
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:46,630
we ask typically in what space do they
intersect each other in what dimension

4362
01:08:46,630 --> 01:08:46,640
intersect each other in what dimension
 

4363
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:48,470
intersect each other in what dimension
that might sound like how do you

4364
01:08:48,470 --> 01:08:48,480
that might sound like how do you
 

4365
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:50,470
that might sound like how do you
possibly give an answer to this

4366
01:08:50,470 --> 01:08:50,480
possibly give an answer to this
 

4367
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:52,470
possibly give an answer to this
so we start with lower dimensions we

4368
01:08:52,470 --> 01:08:52,480
so we start with lower dimensions we
 

4369
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:53,990
so we start with lower dimensions we
start with two dimensions we say if you

4370
01:08:53,990 --> 01:08:54,000
start with two dimensions we say if you
 

4371
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,590
start with two dimensions we say if you
have one dimension

4372
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:55,600
have one dimension
 

4373
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:57,990
have one dimension
and a point do they intersect typically

4374
01:08:57,990 --> 01:08:58,000
and a point do they intersect typically
 

4375
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,349
and a point do they intersect typically
on a plane the answer is no

4376
01:08:59,349 --> 01:08:59,359
on a plane the answer is no
 

4377
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:01,510
on a plane the answer is no
so a line one dimensional a point zero

4378
01:09:01,510 --> 01:09:01,520
so a line one dimensional a point zero
 

4379
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:02,789
so a line one dimensional a point zero
dimension

4380
01:09:02,789 --> 01:09:02,799
dimension
 

4381
01:09:02,799 --> 01:09:04,229
dimension
on a two dimensional plane they don't

4382
01:09:04,229 --> 01:09:04,239
on a two dimensional plane they don't
 

4383
01:09:04,239 --> 01:09:06,229
on a two dimensional plane they don't
typically meet but if you have a

4384
01:09:06,229 --> 01:09:06,239
typically meet but if you have a
 

4385
01:09:06,239 --> 01:09:07,990
typically meet but if you have a
one-dimensional line and another

4386
01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:08,000
one-dimensional line and another
 

4387
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,390
one-dimensional line and another
line which is one plus one on a plane

4388
01:09:10,390 --> 01:09:10,400
line which is one plus one on a plane
 

4389
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:12,070
line which is one plus one on a plane
they typically intersect

4390
01:09:12,070 --> 01:09:12,080
they typically intersect
 

4391
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:14,550
they typically intersect
at a point typically means if you're not

4392
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:14,560
at a point typically means if you're not
 

4393
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,149
at a point typically means if you're not
parallel typically they intersect at a

4394
01:09:16,149 --> 01:09:16,159
parallel typically they intersect at a
 

4395
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:16,950
parallel typically they intersect at a
point

4396
01:09:16,950 --> 01:09:16,960
point
 

4397
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:19,829
point
so one plus one is two and in two

4398
01:09:19,829 --> 01:09:19,839
so one plus one is two and in two
 

4399
01:09:19,839 --> 01:09:20,550
so one plus one is two and in two
dimension

4400
01:09:20,550 --> 01:09:20,560
dimension
 

4401
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,149
dimension
they intersect at the zero dimensional

4402
01:09:22,149 --> 01:09:22,159
they intersect at the zero dimensional
 

4403
01:09:22,159 --> 01:09:24,070
they intersect at the zero dimensional
point so you see two dimension

4404
01:09:24,070 --> 01:09:24,080
point so you see two dimension
 

4405
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:26,950
point so you see two dimension
one and one two two minus two is zero so

4406
01:09:26,950 --> 01:09:26,960
one and one two two minus two is zero so
 

4407
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:27,749
one and one two two minus two is zero so
you get point

4408
01:09:27,749 --> 01:09:27,759
you get point
 

4409
01:09:27,759 --> 01:09:30,229
you get point
out of intersection okay let's go to

4410
01:09:30,229 --> 01:09:30,239
out of intersection okay let's go to
 

4411
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:31,749
out of intersection okay let's go to
three dimension

4412
01:09:31,749 --> 01:09:31,759
three dimension
 

4413
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:33,269
three dimension
you have a plane two dimensional plane

4414
01:09:33,269 --> 01:09:33,279
you have a plane two dimensional plane
 

4415
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:35,189
you have a plane two dimensional plane
and a point do they intersect no two and

4416
01:09:35,189 --> 01:09:35,199
and a point do they intersect no two and
 

4417
01:09:35,199 --> 01:09:37,669
and a point do they intersect no two and
zero

4418
01:09:37,669 --> 01:09:37,679

 

4419
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:39,749

how about a plane and a line a plane is

4420
01:09:39,749 --> 01:09:39,759
how about a plane and a line a plane is
 

4421
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:41,510
how about a plane and a line a plane is
two dimensional and a line is one two

4422
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:41,520
two dimensional and a line is one two
 

4423
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:42,870
two dimensional and a line is one two
plus one is three

4424
01:09:42,870 --> 01:09:42,880
plus one is three
 

4425
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:45,669
plus one is three
in three dimension a plane and a line

4426
01:09:45,669 --> 01:09:45,679
in three dimension a plane and a line
 

4427
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:46,789
in three dimension a plane and a line
meet at points

4428
01:09:46,789 --> 01:09:46,799
meet at points
 

4429
01:09:46,799 --> 01:09:48,550
meet at points
which is zero dimensionals three minus

4430
01:09:48,550 --> 01:09:48,560
which is zero dimensionals three minus
 

4431
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,309
which is zero dimensionals three minus
three is zero okay

4432
01:09:50,309 --> 01:09:50,319
three is zero okay
 

4433
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:53,030
three is zero okay
so plane and the line intersect at the

4434
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:53,040
so plane and the line intersect at the
 

4435
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,310
so plane and the line intersect at the
point in three dimensions how about the

4436
01:09:54,310 --> 01:09:54,320
point in three dimensions how about the
 

4437
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:55,750
point in three dimensions how about the
plane on a plane in three d

4438
01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:55,760
plane on a plane in three d
 

4439
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,750
plane on a plane in three d
well plane is two and this is two two

4440
01:09:57,750 --> 01:09:57,760
well plane is two and this is two two
 

4441
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:59,110
well plane is two and this is two two
plus two is four

4442
01:09:59,110 --> 01:09:59,120
plus two is four
 

4443
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:01,030
plus two is four
in three d four minus three is one they

4444
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:01,040
in three d four minus three is one they
 

4445
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:03,030
in three d four minus three is one they
intersect on a one dimensional line

4446
01:10:03,030 --> 01:10:03,040
intersect on a one dimensional line
 

4447
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:04,470
intersect on a one dimensional line
okay we're beginning to see the pattern

4448
01:10:04,470 --> 01:10:04,480
okay we're beginning to see the pattern
 

4449
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:06,149
okay we're beginning to see the pattern
okay now come to the question we're in

4450
01:10:06,149 --> 01:10:06,159
okay now come to the question we're in
 

4451
01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:07,990
okay now come to the question we're in
ten dimensions now we have the intuition

4452
01:10:07,990 --> 01:10:08,000
ten dimensions now we have the intuition
 

4453
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,430
ten dimensions now we have the intuition
we have a seven dimensional plane and

4454
01:10:09,430 --> 01:10:09,440
we have a seven dimensional plane and
 

4455
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:11,430
we have a seven dimensional plane and
eight dimensional plane in ten dimension

4456
01:10:11,430 --> 01:10:11,440
eight dimensional plane in ten dimension
 

4457
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,270
eight dimensional plane in ten dimension
they intersect on a plane what's the

4458
01:10:13,270 --> 01:10:13,280
they intersect on a plane what's the
 

4459
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:15,350
they intersect on a plane what's the
dimension well seven plus eight is 15

4460
01:10:15,350 --> 01:10:15,360
dimension well seven plus eight is 15
 

4461
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:16,790
dimension well seven plus eight is 15
minus 10 is 5.

4462
01:10:16,790 --> 01:10:16,800
minus 10 is 5.
 

4463
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:20,149
minus 10 is 5.
we draw the same picture as two planes

4464
01:10:20,149 --> 01:10:20,159
we draw the same picture as two planes
 

4465
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:21,750
we draw the same picture as two planes
and we write seven dimension eight

4466
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:21,760
and we write seven dimension eight
 

4467
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,350
and we write seven dimension eight
dimension but we have gotten the

4468
01:10:23,350 --> 01:10:23,360
dimension but we have gotten the
 

4469
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,270
dimension but we have gotten the
intuition from the lower dimensional one

4470
01:10:25,270 --> 01:10:25,280
intuition from the lower dimensional one
 

4471
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:27,830
intuition from the lower dimensional one
what to expect it doesn't scare us

4472
01:10:27,830 --> 01:10:27,840
what to expect it doesn't scare us
 

4473
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:28,550
what to expect it doesn't scare us
anymore

4474
01:10:28,550 --> 01:10:28,560
anymore
 

4475
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:31,590
anymore
so we draw this picture we cannot see

4476
01:10:31,590 --> 01:10:31,600
so we draw this picture we cannot see
 

4477
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:33,270
so we draw this picture we cannot see
all the seven dimensions by looking at

4478
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:33,280
all the seven dimensions by looking at
 

4479
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:33,750
all the seven dimensions by looking at
this

4480
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:33,760
this
 

4481
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:36,310
this
two-dimensional visualization of it but

4482
01:10:36,310 --> 01:10:36,320
two-dimensional visualization of it but
 

4483
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:38,229
two-dimensional visualization of it but
it has all the features we want

4484
01:10:38,229 --> 01:10:38,239
it has all the features we want
 

4485
01:10:38,239 --> 01:10:39,990
it has all the features we want
it has so i we draw this picture which

4486
01:10:39,990 --> 01:10:40,000
it has so i we draw this picture which
 

4487
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,070
it has so i we draw this picture which
is seven seven and they they meet at the

4488
01:10:42,070 --> 01:10:42,080
is seven seven and they they meet at the
 

4489
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:43,430
is seven seven and they they meet at the
five-dimensional plane

4490
01:10:43,430 --> 01:10:43,440
five-dimensional plane
 

4491
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,750
five-dimensional plane
it says five so we have we have build

4492
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:45,760
it says five so we have we have build
 

4493
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:48,390
it says five so we have we have build
this intuition now

4494
01:10:48,390 --> 01:10:48,400
this intuition now
 

4495
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,870
this intuition now
this is an example of how we come up

4496
01:10:50,870 --> 01:10:50,880
this is an example of how we come up
 

4497
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:51,750
this is an example of how we come up
with intuition

4498
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:51,760
with intuition
 

4499
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:53,189
with intuition
let me give you more examples of it

4500
01:10:53,189 --> 01:10:53,199
let me give you more examples of it
 

4501
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:55,350
let me give you more examples of it
because i think this will show you that

4502
01:10:55,350 --> 01:10:55,360
because i think this will show you that
 

4503
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:57,030
because i think this will show you that
people have to come up with intuitions

4504
01:10:57,030 --> 01:10:57,040
people have to come up with intuitions
 

4505
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:58,470
people have to come up with intuitions
to visualize that otherwise we

4506
01:10:58,470 --> 01:10:58,480
to visualize that otherwise we
 

4507
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:01,189
to visualize that otherwise we
will be a little bit uh lost so what you

4508
01:11:01,189 --> 01:11:01,199
will be a little bit uh lost so what you
 

4509
01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:01,590
will be a little bit uh lost so what you
just

4510
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:01,600
just
 

4511
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:03,270
just
described is kind of uh in these high

4512
01:11:03,270 --> 01:11:03,280
described is kind of uh in these high
 

4513
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:06,229
described is kind of uh in these high
dimensional spaces focus on the meeting

4514
01:11:06,229 --> 01:11:06,239
dimensional spaces focus on the meeting
 

4515
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:08,950
dimensional spaces focus on the meeting
place of uh two planes in high

4516
01:11:08,950 --> 01:11:08,960

dimensional spaces
 

4519
01:11:10,159 --> 01:11:12,070
dimensional spaces
exactly how the planes meet for example

4520
01:11:12,070 --> 01:11:12,080
exactly how the planes meet for example
 

4521
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:13,590
exactly how the planes meet for example
what's the dimension of their

4522
01:11:13,590 --> 01:11:13,600
what's the dimension of their
 

4523
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,750
what's the dimension of their
intersection and so on so how do we come

4524
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:15,760
intersection and so on so how do we come
 

4525
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:16,950
intersection and so on so how do we come
up with the intuition we

4526
01:11:16,950 --> 01:11:16,960
up with the intuition we
 

4527
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:19,510
up with the intuition we
borrow examples from door dimensions

4528
01:11:19,510 --> 01:11:19,520
borrow examples from door dimensions
 

4529
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:20,790
borrow examples from door dimensions
build up intuition and

4530
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:20,800
build up intuition and
 

4531
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,390
build up intuition and
draw the same pictures as if we are

4532
01:11:22,390 --> 01:11:22,400
draw the same pictures as if we are
 

4533
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:23,910
draw the same pictures as if we are
talking about

4534
01:11:23,910 --> 01:11:23,920
talking about
 

4535
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:25,430
talking about
10 dimensions but we are drawing the

4536
01:11:25,430 --> 01:11:25,440
10 dimensions but we are drawing the
 

4537
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:26,790
10 dimensions but we are drawing the
same as the two dimensional plane

4538
01:11:26,790 --> 01:11:26,800
same as the two dimensional plane
 

4539
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:28,149
same as the two dimensional plane
because we cannot do any better

4540
01:11:28,149 --> 01:11:28,159
because we cannot do any better
 

4541
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:31,350
because we cannot do any better
but our our our words change

4542
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:31,360
but our our our words change
 

4543
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:33,430
but our our our words change
but not our pictures so your senses we

4544
01:11:33,430 --> 01:11:33,440
but not our pictures so your senses we
 

4545
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:35,750
but not our pictures so your senses we
can have a deep understanding

4546
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:35,760
can have a deep understanding
 

4547
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:39,110
can have a deep understanding
of reality by looking at its at slices

4548
01:11:39,110 --> 01:11:39,120
of reality by looking at its at slices
 

4549
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:41,270
of reality by looking at its at slices
a lower dimensional slice exactly

4550
01:11:41,270 --> 01:11:41,280
a lower dimensional slice exactly
 

4551
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:42,790
a lower dimensional slice exactly
exactly and this this is that comes

4552
01:11:42,790 --> 01:11:42,800
exactly and this this is that comes
 

4553
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,390

which is sphere let's think about how do

4558
01:11:47,189 --> 01:11:47,199
which is sphere let's think about how do
 

4559
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:48,470
which is sphere let's think about how do
we think about the sphere

4560
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:48,480
we think about the sphere
 

4561
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:50,149
we think about the sphere
well the sphere is a sphere you know the

4562
01:11:50,149 --> 01:11:50,159
well the sphere is a sphere you know the
 

4563
01:11:50,159 --> 01:11:51,750
well the sphere is a sphere you know the
round nice thing but

4564
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:51,760
round nice thing but
 

4565
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:55,669
round nice thing but
sphere has a circular symmetry now

4566
01:11:55,669 --> 01:11:55,679
sphere has a circular symmetry now
 

4567
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:57,189
sphere has a circular symmetry now
i can describe the sphere in the

4568
01:11:57,189 --> 01:11:57,199
i can describe the sphere in the
 

4569
01:11:57,199 --> 01:11:59,350
i can describe the sphere in the
following way i can describe it

4570
01:11:59,350 --> 01:11:59,360
following way i can describe it
 

4571
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:02,470
following way i can describe it
by an interval which is

4572
01:12:02,470 --> 01:12:02,480
by an interval which is
 

4573
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:04,470
by an interval which is
think about this going from the north of

4574
01:12:04,470 --> 01:12:04,480
think about this going from the north of
 

4575
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:06,229
think about this going from the north of
the sphere to the south

4576
01:12:06,229 --> 01:12:06,239
the sphere to the south
 

4577
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:07,990
the sphere to the south
and at each point i have a circle

4578
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:08,000
and at each point i have a circle
 

4579
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,350
and at each point i have a circle
attached to it

4580
01:12:09,350 --> 01:12:09,360
attached to it
 

4581
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:11,030
attached to it
so you can think about the sphere as a

4582
01:12:11,030 --> 01:12:11,040
so you can think about the sphere as a
 

4583
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:12,790
so you can think about the sphere as a
line with a circle attached with

4584
01:12:12,790 --> 01:12:12,800
line with a circle attached with
 

4585
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:15,430
line with a circle attached with
each point the circle shrinks to a

4586
01:12:15,430 --> 01:12:15,440
each point the circle shrinks to a
 

4587
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:16,709
each point the circle shrinks to a
circle string to a point

4588
01:12:16,709 --> 01:12:16,719
circle string to a point
 

4589
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:18,390
circle string to a point
at endpoints of the interval so i can

4590
01:12:18,390 --> 01:12:18,400
at endpoints of the interval so i can
 

4591
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:21,750
at endpoints of the interval so i can
say oh one way to think about the sphere

4592
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:21,760
say oh one way to think about the sphere
 

4593
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:24,550
say oh one way to think about the sphere
is an interval where at each point on

4594
01:12:24,550 --> 01:12:24,560
is an interval where at each point on
 

4595
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:26,229
is an interval where at each point on
that interval there's another circle i'm

4596
01:12:26,229 --> 01:12:26,239
that interval there's another circle i'm
 

4597
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:27,110
that interval there's another circle i'm
not drawing

4598
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:27,120
not drawing
 

4599
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:29,270
not drawing
but if you like you can just draw it say

4600
01:12:29,270 --> 01:12:29,280
but if you like you can just draw it say
 

4601
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:31,189
but if you like you can just draw it say
okay i won't draw it so from now on

4602
01:12:31,189 --> 01:12:31,199
okay i won't draw it so from now on
 

4603
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:33,510
okay i won't draw it so from now on
is this mnemonic i draw an interval when

4604
01:12:33,510 --> 01:12:33,520
is this mnemonic i draw an interval when
 

4605
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:34,790
is this mnemonic i draw an interval when
i want to talk about the sphere and you

4606
01:12:34,790 --> 01:12:34,800
i want to talk about the sphere and you
 

4607
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:35,590
i want to talk about the sphere and you
remember

4608
01:12:35,590 --> 01:12:35,600
remember
 

4609
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:37,430
remember
that the end points of the interval mean

4610
01:12:37,430 --> 01:12:37,440
that the end points of the interval mean
 

4611
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:39,189
that the end points of the interval mean
a strong circle that's all

4612
01:12:39,189 --> 01:12:39,199
a strong circle that's all
 

4613
01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:40,790
a strong circle that's all
and they say yeah i see that's a sphere

4614
01:12:40,790 --> 01:12:40,800
and they say yeah i see that's a sphere
 

4615
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:42,709
and they say yeah i see that's a sphere
good now we want to talk about the

4616
01:12:42,709 --> 01:12:42,719
good now we want to talk about the
 

4617
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:44,149
good now we want to talk about the
product of two spheres

4618
01:12:44,149 --> 01:12:44,159
product of two spheres
 

4619
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:45,510
product of two spheres
that's four dimensional how can i

4620
01:12:45,510 --> 01:12:45,520
that's four dimensional how can i
 

4621
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:47,910
that's four dimensional how can i
visualize it easy

4622
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:47,920
visualize it easy
 

4623
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:49,510
visualize it easy
you just take an interval and it's

4624
01:12:49,510 --> 01:12:49,520
you just take an interval and it's
 

4625
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:51,430
you just take an interval and it's
another interval that's just going to be

4626
01:12:51,430 --> 01:12:51,440
another interval that's just going to be
 

4627
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:52,229
another interval that's just going to be
a square

4628
01:12:52,229 --> 01:12:52,239
a square
 

4629
01:12:52,239 --> 01:12:55,990
a square
yeah a square is a four dimensional

4630
01:12:55,990 --> 01:12:56,000
yeah a square is a four dimensional
 

4631
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,790
yeah a square is a four dimensional
space yeah why is that well at each

4632
01:12:58,790 --> 01:12:58,800
space yeah why is that well at each
 

4633
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,229
space yeah why is that well at each
point

4634
01:13:00,229 --> 01:13:00,239
point
 

4635
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:02,229
point
on the square there's two circles one

4636
01:13:02,229 --> 01:13:02,239
on the square there's two circles one
 

4637
01:13:02,239 --> 01:13:04,709
on the square there's two circles one
for each of those directions you drew

4638
01:13:04,709 --> 01:13:04,719
for each of those directions you drew
 

4639
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:06,470
for each of those directions you drew
and when you get to the boundaries of

4640
01:13:06,470 --> 01:13:06,480
and when you get to the boundaries of
 

4641
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:08,070
and when you get to the boundaries of
each direction one of the circles shrink

01:13:08,070 --> 01:13:08,080
each direction one of the circles shrink
 

4643
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:09,750
each direction one of the circles shrink
on each edge of that square

4644
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:09,760
on each edge of that square
 

4645
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,270
on each edge of that square
and when you get to the corners of the

and when you get to the corners of the
 

4647
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:13,590
and when you get to the corners of the
square all both circles shrink

01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:43,030
not drawing for you
for each one of those directions there's

4680
01:13:43,030 --> 01:13:43,040
for each one of those directions there's
 

4681
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:44,790
for each one of those directions there's
another circle but each time you get to

4682
01:13:44,790 --> 01:13:44,800
another circle but each time you get to
 

4683
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:45,990
another circle but each time you get to
the boundary of the cube one

4684
01:13:45,990 --> 01:13:46,000
the boundary of the cube one
 

4685
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,910
the boundary of the cube one
circle shrinks when the boundaries meet

4686
01:13:47,910 --> 01:13:47,920
circle shrinks when the boundaries meet
 

4687
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:49,110
circle shrinks when the boundaries meet
two circuit strings when three

boundaries meet
 

4691
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:52,310
boundaries meet
all the three circles shrink so i just

4692
01:13:52,310 --> 01:13:52,320
all the three circles shrink so i just
 

4693
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:53,990
all the three circles shrink so i just
give you a picture now

4694
01:13:53,990 --> 01:13:54,000
give you a picture now
 

4695
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,510
give you a picture now
mathematicians come up with amazing

4696
01:13:55,510 --> 01:13:55,520
mathematicians come up with amazing
 

4697
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:57,189
mathematicians come up with amazing
things like you know what i want to take

4698
01:13:57,189 --> 01:13:57,199
things like you know what i want to take
 

4699
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:59,270
things like you know what i want to take
a point in space and blow it up

4700
01:13:59,270 --> 01:13:59,280
a point in space and blow it up
 

4701
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:01,270
a point in space and blow it up
you know these concepts like topology

4702
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:01,280
you know these concepts like topology
 

4703
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:03,430
you know these concepts like topology
and geometry complicated how do you do

4704
01:14:03,430 --> 01:14:03,440
and geometry complicated how do you do
 

4705
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,590
and geometry complicated how do you do
in this picture it's very easy blow it

4706
01:14:05,590 --> 01:14:05,600
in this picture it's very easy blow it
 

4707
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:07,750
in this picture it's very easy blow it
up in this picture means the following

4708
01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:07,760
up in this picture means the following
 

4709
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:09,350
up in this picture means the following
you think about this cube you go to the

4710
01:14:09,350 --> 01:14:09,360
you think about this cube you go to the
 

4711
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:12,550
you think about this cube you go to the
corner and you chop off a corner

4712
01:14:12,550 --> 01:14:12,560
corner and you chop off a corner
 

4713
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:14,149
corner and you chop off a corner
chopping off the corner replaces the

4714
01:14:14,149 --> 01:14:14,159
chopping off the corner replaces the
 

4715
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:16,390
chopping off the corner replaces the
point yeah you raise the point by

4716
01:14:16,390 --> 01:14:16,400
point yeah you raise the point by
 

4717
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:17,030
point yeah you raise the point by
triangle

4718
01:14:17,030 --> 01:14:17,040
triangle
 

4719
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:18,870
triangle
yes that's called blowing up a point and

4720
01:14:18,870 --> 01:14:18,880
yes that's called blowing up a point and
 

4721
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:20,790
yes that's called blowing up a point and
then this triangle is what they call p2

4722
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:20,800
then this triangle is what they call p2
 

4723
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:22,149
then this triangle is what they call p2
projective two space

4724
01:14:22,149 --> 01:14:22,159
projective two space
 

4725
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:24,470
projective two space
but these pictures are very physical and

4726
01:14:24,470 --> 01:14:24,480
but these pictures are very physical and
 

4727
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,310
but these pictures are very physical and
you feel it there's nothing amazing i'm

4728
01:14:26,310 --> 01:14:26,320
you feel it there's nothing amazing i'm
 

4729
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:27,990
you feel it there's nothing amazing i'm
not talking about six dimension

4730
01:14:27,990 --> 01:14:28,000
not talking about six dimension
 

4731
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,590
not talking about six dimension
four plus six is ten the dimension of

4732
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:29,600
four plus six is ten the dimension of
 

4733
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:31,430
four plus six is ten the dimension of
string theory so we can visualize that

4734
01:14:31,430 --> 01:14:31,440
string theory so we can visualize that
 

4735
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:32,229
string theory so we can visualize that
no problem

4736
01:14:32,229 --> 01:14:32,239
no problem
 

4737
01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:34,390
no problem
okay so that's building the intuition to

4738
01:14:34,390 --> 01:14:34,400
okay so that's building the intuition to
 

4739
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:35,910
okay so that's building the intuition to
a complicated world

4740
01:14:35,910 --> 01:14:35,920
a complicated world
 

4741
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:37,590
a complicated world
of string theory nevertheless these

4742
01:14:37,590 --> 01:14:37,600
of string theory nevertheless these
 

4743
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:39,910
of string theory nevertheless these
objects are really small

4744
01:14:39,910 --> 01:14:39,920
objects are really small
 

4745
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:41,910
objects are really small
and just like you said experimental

4746
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:41,920
and just like you said experimental
 

4747
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:43,590
and just like you said experimental
validation is very difficult because the

4748
01:14:43,590 --> 01:14:43,600
validation is very difficult because the
 

4749
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:44,229
validation is very difficult because the
objects

4750
01:14:44,229 --> 01:14:44,239
objects
 

4751
01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:47,110
objects
are way smaller than anything that we

4752
01:14:47,110 --> 01:14:47,120
are way smaller than anything that we
 

4753
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:48,310
are way smaller than anything that we
currently have the tools and

4754
01:14:48,310 --> 01:14:48,320
currently have the tools and
 

4755
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:51,189
currently have the tools and
accelerators and so on to uh

4756
01:14:51,189 --> 01:14:51,199
accelerators and so on to uh
 

4757
01:14:51,199 --> 01:14:54,310
accelerators and so on to uh
to reveal through experiment so

4758
01:14:54,310 --> 01:14:54,320
to reveal through experiment so
 

4759
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:56,790
to reveal through experiment so
there's a kind of skepticism that's not

4760
01:14:56,790 --> 01:14:56,800
there's a kind of skepticism that's not
 

4761
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:58,229
there's a kind of skepticism that's not
just about

4762
01:14:58,229 --> 01:14:58,239
just about
 

4763
01:14:58,239 --> 01:14:59,590
just about
the nature of the theory because of the

4764
01:14:59,590 --> 01:14:59,600
the nature of the theory because of the
 

4765
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:01,750
the nature of the theory because of the
10 dimensions as you've explained

4766
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:01,760
10 dimensions as you've explained
 

4767
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,750
10 dimensions as you've explained
but in that we can't experimentally

4768
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:03,760
but in that we can't experimentally
 

4769
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:04,870
but in that we can't experimentally
validate it

4770
01:15:04,870 --> 01:15:04,880
validate it
 

4771
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:07,669
validate it
and it doesn't necessarily to date maybe

4772
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:07,679
and it doesn't necessarily to date maybe
 

4773
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:08,950
and it doesn't necessarily to date maybe
can correct me

4774
01:15:08,950 --> 01:15:08,960
can correct me
 

4775
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:11,990
can correct me
predicts something fundamentally new

4776
01:15:11,990 --> 01:15:12,000
predicts something fundamentally new
 

4777
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,110
predicts something fundamentally new
so it's it's beautiful as an explaining

4778
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:15,120
so it's it's beautiful as an explaining
 

4779
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:15,990
so it's it's beautiful as an explaining

theory
 

4781
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,310
theory
which means that it's very possible that

4782
01:15:18,310 --> 01:15:18,320
which means that it's very possible that
 

4783
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:19,990
which means that it's very possible that
it is a fundamental theory that

4784
01:15:19,990 --> 01:15:20,000
it is a fundamental theory that
 

4785
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,470
it is a fundamental theory that
describes reality and unifies the laws

4786
01:15:22,470 --> 01:15:22,480
describes reality and unifies the laws
 

4787
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:25,510
describes reality and unifies the laws
but there's still a kind of skepticism

but there's still a kind of skepticism

a little bit of a

a little bit of a

growing cynicism about string theory in
 

4797
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:37,189

the recent few years
 

4799
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:40,149
the recent few years
can you describe the cynicism about sort

4800
01:15:40,149 --> 01:15:40,159
can you describe the cynicism about sort
 

4801
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:40,470
can you describe the cynicism about sort
of

4802

of
 

4803
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:43,830
of
by cynicism i mean a cynicism about

4804
01:15:43,830 --> 01:15:43,840
by cynicism i mean a cynicism about
 

4805
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:46,950
by cynicism i mean a cynicism about
the hope for this theory of

4806
01:15:46,950 --> 01:15:46,960
the hope for this theory of
 

4807
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:50,709
the hope for this theory of
pushing theoretical physics forward yes

4808
01:15:50,709 --> 01:15:50,719
pushing theoretical physics forward yes
 

4809
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:53,990
pushing theoretical physics forward yes
can you do describe why this is cynicism

4810
01:15:53,990 --> 01:15:54,000
can you do describe why this is cynicism
 

4811
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,310
can you do describe why this is cynicism
and how do we reverse that trend yes

4812
01:15:56,310 --> 01:15:56,320
and how do we reverse that trend yes
 

4813
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:57,110
and how do we reverse that trend yes
first of all

4814
01:15:57,110 --> 01:15:57,120
first of all
 

4815
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:01,030
first of all
the criticism uh for string theory

4816
01:16:01,030 --> 01:16:01,040
the criticism uh for string theory
 

4817
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:03,990
the criticism uh for string theory
uh is healthy in some in a sense that in

4818
01:16:03,990 --> 01:16:04,000
uh is healthy in some in a sense that in
 

4819
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,270
uh is healthy in some in a sense that in
science we

4820
01:16:05,270 --> 01:16:05,280
science we
 

4821
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:06,630
science we
we have to have different viewpoints and

4822
01:16:06,630 --> 01:16:06,640
we have to have different viewpoints and
 

4823
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:08,390
we have to have different viewpoints and
that's good so i don't i welcome

4824
01:16:08,390 --> 01:16:08,400
that's good so i don't i welcome
 

4825
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:09,590
that's good so i don't i welcome
criticism

4826
01:16:09,590 --> 01:16:09,600
criticism
 

4827
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:12,310
criticism
uh and the the the reason for criticism

4828
01:16:12,310 --> 01:16:12,320
uh and the the the reason for criticism
 

4829
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:13,910
uh and the the the reason for criticism
and i think that is a valid reason is

4830
01:16:13,910 --> 01:16:13,920
and i think that is a valid reason is
 

4831
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:15,430
and i think that is a valid reason is
that there has been zero experimental

4832
01:16:15,430 --> 01:16:15,440
that there has been zero experimental
 

4833
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:17,030
that there has been zero experimental
evidence for string theory

4834
01:16:17,030 --> 01:16:17,040
evidence for string theory
 

4835
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:20,149
evidence for string theory
that is no experiment has been done

4836
01:16:20,149 --> 01:16:20,159
that is no experiment has been done
 

4837
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:21,510
that is no experiment has been done
to show that there's you know there's

4838
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:21,520
to show that there's you know there's
 

4839
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:23,990
to show that there's you know there's
this little loop of energy moving around

4840
01:16:23,990 --> 01:16:24,000
this little loop of energy moving around
 

4841
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,110
this little loop of energy moving around
and so that's a valid valid uh objection

4842
01:16:27,110 --> 01:16:27,120
and so that's a valid valid uh objection
 

4843
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:28,390
and so that's a valid valid uh objection
and valid worry

4844
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:28,400
and valid worry
 

4845
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,149
and valid worry
and if i were to say you know what

4846
01:16:30,149 --> 01:16:30,159
and if i were to say you know what
 

4847
01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:31,830
and if i were to say you know what
string theory can never be verified or

4848
01:16:31,830 --> 01:16:31,840
string theory can never be verified or
 

4849
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:33,189
string theory can never be verified or
experimentally checked that's the way it

4850
01:16:33,189 --> 01:16:33,199
experimentally checked that's the way it
 

4851
01:16:33,199 --> 01:16:34,630
experimentally checked that's the way it
is

4852
01:16:34,630 --> 01:16:34,640
is
 

4853
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:36,310
is
they would have every right to say what

4854
01:16:36,310 --> 01:16:36,320
they would have every right to say what
 

4855
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:37,750
they would have every right to say what
you're talking about is not science

4856
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:37,760
you're talking about is not science
 

4857
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,669
you're talking about is not science
because in science we will have to have

4858
01:16:39,669 --> 01:16:39,679
because in science we will have to have
 

4859
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:42,229
because in science we will have to have
experimental consequences and checks

4860
01:16:42,229 --> 01:16:42,239
experimental consequences and checks
 

4861
01:16:42,239 --> 01:16:44,550
experimental consequences and checks
the difference between string theory and

4862
01:16:44,550 --> 01:16:44,560
the difference between string theory and
 

4863
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:45,750
the difference between string theory and
something which is not scientific is

4864
01:16:45,750 --> 01:16:45,760
something which is not scientific is
 

4865
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:47,510
something which is not scientific is
that string 3 has predictions

4866
01:16:47,510 --> 01:16:47,520
that string 3 has predictions
 

4867
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:49,030
that string 3 has predictions
the problem is that the predictions we

4868
01:16:49,030 --> 01:16:49,040
the problem is that the predictions we
 

4869
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:50,870
the problem is that the predictions we
have today of string theory is hard to

4870
01:16:50,870 --> 01:16:50,880
have today of string theory is hard to
 

4871
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:53,510
have today of string theory is hard to
access by experiments available with the

4872
01:16:53,510 --> 01:16:53,520
access by experiments available with the
 

4873
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:54,709
access by experiments available with the
energies we can

4874
01:16:54,709 --> 01:16:54,719
energies we can
 

4875
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:56,630
energies we can
achieve with the colliders today it

4876
01:16:56,630 --> 01:16:56,640
achieve with the colliders today it
 

4877
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:57,750
achieve with the colliders today it
doesn't mean there's a problem with

4878
01:16:57,750 --> 01:16:57,760
doesn't mean there's a problem with
 

4879
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:59,030
doesn't mean there's a problem with
string theory it just means

4880
01:16:59,030 --> 01:16:59,040
string theory it just means
 

4881
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:01,590
string theory it just means
technologically we're not that far ahead

4882
01:17:01,590 --> 01:17:01,600
technologically we're not that far ahead
 

4883
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:03,110
technologically we're not that far ahead
now

4884
01:17:03,110 --> 01:17:03,120
now
 

4885
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:05,350
now
we can have two attitudes you say well

4886
01:17:05,350 --> 01:17:05,360
we can have two attitudes you say well
 

4887
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:06,709
we can have two attitudes you say well
if that's the case why are you studying

4888
01:17:06,709 --> 01:17:06,719
if that's the case why are you studying
 

4889
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:07,830
if that's the case why are you studying
this subject because you can't do

01:17:07,830 --> 01:17:07,840
this subject because you can't do
 

4891
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:09,350
this subject because you can't do
experiment today

4892
01:17:09,350 --> 01:17:09,360
experiment today
 

4893
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:11,510
experiment today
now this is becoming a little bit more

4894
01:17:11,510 --> 01:17:11,520
now this is becoming a little bit more
 

4895
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:13,270
now this is becoming a little bit more
like mathematics in that sense you say

4896
01:17:13,270 --> 01:17:13,280
like mathematics in that sense you say
 

4897
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:14,550
like mathematics in that sense you say
well

4898
01:17:14,550 --> 01:17:14,560
well
 

4899
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:15,990
well
i want to learn i want to know how the

4900
01:17:15,990 --> 01:17:16,000
i want to learn i want to know how the
 

4901
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,830
i want to learn i want to know how the
nature works even though i cannot prove

4902
01:17:17,830 --> 01:17:17,840
nature works even though i cannot prove
 

4903
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:18,390
nature works even though i cannot prove
it today

4904
01:17:18,390 --> 01:17:18,400
it today
 

4905
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,950
it today
that this is it because of experiments

4906
01:17:20,950 --> 01:17:20,960
that this is it because of experiments
 

4907
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:22,709
that this is it because of experiments
that should not prevent my mind not to

4908
01:17:22,709 --> 01:17:22,719
that should not prevent my mind not to
 

4909
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:24,070
that should not prevent my mind not to
think about it that's right

4910
01:17:24,070 --> 01:17:24,080
think about it that's right
 

4911
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:25,830
think about it that's right
so that's the attitude many string tears

4912
01:17:25,830 --> 01:17:25,840
so that's the attitude many string tears
 

4913
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:27,350
so that's the attitude many string tears
follow that that that

4914
01:17:27,350 --> 01:17:27,360
follow that that that
 

4915
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:29,350
follow that that that
should be like this now so that's that's

4916
01:17:29,350 --> 01:17:29,360
should be like this now so that's that's
 

4917
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:31,270
should be like this now so that's that's
the answer to the criticism but there's

4918
01:17:31,270 --> 01:17:31,280
the answer to the criticism but there's
 

4919
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:32,470
the answer to the criticism but there's
actually a better answer to the

4920
01:17:32,470 --> 01:17:32,480
actually a better answer to the
 

4921
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:33,990
actually a better answer to the
criticism i would say

4922
01:17:33,990 --> 01:17:34,000
criticism i would say
 

4923
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,790
criticism i would say
we don't have experimental evidence for

01:17:36,790 --> 01:17:36,800
we don't have experimental evidence for
 

4925
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:38,310
we don't have experimental evidence for
string theory but we have theoretical

4926
01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:38,320
string theory but we have theoretical
 

4927
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:39,750
string theory but we have theoretical
evidence for string theory and what do i

4928
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:39,760
evidence for string theory and what do i
 

4929
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:40,709
evidence for string theory and what do i
mean by

01:18:18,870 --> 01:18:18,880
subject is
 

4971
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:21,189
subject is
very rich it's not something we were

4972
01:18:21,189 --> 01:18:21,199
very rich it's not something we were
 

4973
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:22,870
very rich it's not something we were
smart enough to develop

4974
01:18:22,870 --> 01:18:22,880
smart enough to develop
 

4975
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:24,630
smart enough to develop
it came at us as i explained to you the

4976
01:18:24,630 --> 01:18:24,640
it came at us as i explained to you the
 

4977
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,149
it came at us as i explained to you the
development of string theory came from

development of string theory came from
 

4979

we were smart enough to come up with
 

4983
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:31,830
we were smart enough to come up with
idea oh yeah string of course has

idea oh yeah string of course has
 

4985
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:34,550

gravity no it was accident discovery so

4986
01:18:34,550 --> 01:18:34,560
gravity no it was accident discovery so
 

4987
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:36,229
gravity no it was accident discovery so
some people say it's not fair to say we

some people say it's not fair to say we
 

4989
01:18:36,239 --> 01:18:36,709
some people say it's not fair to say we
have no

4990
01:18:36,709 --> 01:18:36,719
have no
 

4991
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:38,709
have no
evidence for string theory graviton

4992
01:18:38,709 --> 01:18:38,719

4993
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:40,630

gravity is that evidence for string

4994
01:18:40,630 --> 01:18:40,640
gravity is that evidence for string
 

4995
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:41,189
gravity is that evidence for string

4997
01:18:41,199 --> 01:18:43,270

it's predicted by string theory we

4998
01:18:43,270 --> 01:18:43,280
it's predicted by string theory we
 

4999
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:45,750
it's predicted by string theory we
didn't put it by hand we got it

5000
01:18:45,750 --> 01:18:45,760
didn't put it by hand we got it
 

5001
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:48,470
didn't put it by hand we got it
so there's a qualitative check okay

5002
01:18:48,470 --> 01:18:48,480
so there's a qualitative check okay
 

5003
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:49,270
so there's a qualitative check okay
gravity

5004
01:18:49,270 --> 01:18:49,280
gravity
 

5005
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:51,189
gravity
is a prediction of string theory it's a

5006
01:18:51,189 --> 01:18:51,199
is a prediction of string theory it's a
 

5007
01:18:51,199 --> 01:18:52,709
is a prediction of string theory it's a
postdiction because we know gravity

5008
01:18:52,709 --> 01:18:52,719
postdiction because we know gravity
 

5009
01:18:52,719 --> 01:18:53,590
postdiction because we know gravity
existed

5010
01:18:53,590 --> 01:18:53,600
existed
 

5011
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:56,709
existed
but still logically it is a prediction

5012
01:18:56,709 --> 01:18:56,719
but still logically it is a prediction
 

5013
01:18:56,719 --> 01:18:57,990
but still logically it is a prediction
because

5014
01:18:57,990 --> 01:18:58,000
because
 

5015
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,430
because
really we didn't know it had that

5016
01:18:59,430 --> 01:18:59,440
really we didn't know it had that
 

5017
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:01,189
really we didn't know it had that
graviton that we later learned that oh

5018
01:19:01,189 --> 01:19:01,199
graviton that we later learned that oh
 

5019
01:19:01,199 --> 01:19:03,270
graviton that we later learned that oh
that's the same as gravity so literally

5020
01:19:03,270 --> 01:19:03,280
that's the same as gravity so literally
 

5021
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:04,390
that's the same as gravity so literally
that's the way it was discovered it

5022
01:19:04,390 --> 01:19:04,400
that's the way it was discovered it
 

5023
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:06,149
that's the way it was discovered it
wasn't put in by hand

5024
01:19:06,149 --> 01:19:06,159
wasn't put in by hand
 

5025
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:07,910
wasn't put in by hand
so so there are there are many things

5026
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:07,920
so so there are there are many things
 

5027
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:09,350
so so there are there are many things
like that that there are there are

01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:35,510
because they will say okay great you got
some math but what's to do with reality

5054
01:19:35,510 --> 01:19:35,520
some math but what's to do with reality
 

5055
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:38,070
some math but what's to do with reality
but as i explained many of the physical

5056
01:19:38,070 --> 01:19:38,080
but as i explained many of the physical
 

5057
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:39,510
but as i explained many of the physical
principles we know of

5058
01:19:39,510 --> 01:19:39,520
principles we know of
 

5059
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:41,750
principles we know of
have beautiful math underpinning them so

5060
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:41,760
have beautiful math underpinning them so
 

5061
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:44,550
have beautiful math underpinning them so
it certainly leads further

5062
01:19:44,550 --> 01:19:44,560
it certainly leads further
 

5063
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:46,310
it certainly leads further
confidence that we may not be going

5064
01:19:46,310 --> 01:19:46,320
confidence that we may not be going
 

5065
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:47,750
confidence that we may not be going
astray even though that's not the food

5066
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:47,760
astray even though that's not the food
 

5067
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:49,110
astray even though that's not the food
proof as we know

5068
01:19:49,110 --> 01:19:49,120
proof as we know
 

5069
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:51,189
proof as we know
so so there are these aspects that give

5070
01:19:51,189 --> 01:19:51,199
so so there are these aspects that give
 

5071
01:19:51,199 --> 01:19:52,229
so so there are these aspects that give
further evidence

5072
01:19:52,229 --> 01:19:52,239
further evidence
 

5073
01:19:52,239 --> 01:19:54,470
further evidence
for string theory connections between

5074
01:19:54,470 --> 01:19:54,480
for string theory connections between
 

5075
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:55,990
for string theory connections between
each other connection with the real

5076
01:19:55,990 --> 01:19:56,000
each other connection with the real
 

5077
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,189
each other connection with the real
world but then there are other things

5078
01:19:57,189 --> 01:19:57,199
world but then there are other things
 

5079
01:19:57,199 --> 01:19:58,390
world but then there are other things
that come about

5080
01:19:58,390 --> 01:19:58,400
that come about
 

5081
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:01,030
that come about
and i can try to give examples of that

5082
01:20:01,030 --> 01:20:01,040
and i can try to give examples of that
 

5083
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:01,590
and i can try to give examples of that
so

5084
01:20:01,590 --> 01:20:01,600
so
 

5085
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:03,189
so
so these are further evidences and these

5086
01:20:03,189 --> 01:20:03,199
so these are further evidences and these
 

5087
01:20:03,199 --> 01:20:05,750
so these are further evidences and these
are certain predictions of string theory

5088
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:05,760
are certain predictions of string theory
 

5089
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:08,470
are certain predictions of string theory
they are not as as as detailed as we

5090
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:08,480
they are not as as as detailed as we
 

5091
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:11,750
they are not as as as detailed as we
want but there are still predictions

5092
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:11,760
want but there are still predictions
 

5093
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:13,830
want but there are still predictions

see i don't know just just deal with it

5098
01:20:18,870 --> 01:20:18,880
see i don't know just just deal with it

three plus one
 

5101
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:23,270

but in physics we want to know why

5102
01:20:23,270 --> 01:20:23,280
but in physics we want to know why
 

5103
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:25,910

01:20:44,070 --> 01:20:44,080
three or four would not be your pick the
 

5123
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:45,350
three or four would not be your pick the
fact that we are in three or four

fact that we are in three or four
 

5125
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:48,390

go beyond 10 or maybe 11 or something
 

5131

go beyond 10 or maybe 11 or something
the fact that they're just upper bound

01:21:00,709 --> 01:21:00,719
it already brings a natural prior oh
 

5139
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:02,229
it already brings a natural prior oh
yeah three or four is you know it's just

5140
01:21:02,229 --> 01:21:02,239
yeah three or four is you know it's just
 

5141
01:21:02,239 --> 01:21:03,110
yeah three or four is you know it's just
on the average if you

5142
01:21:03,110 --> 01:21:03,120
on the average if you
 

5143
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:04,070
on the average if you
if you pick some of the

5144
01:21:04,070 --> 01:21:04,080
if you pick some of the
 

5145
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:05,590
if you pick some of the
compactifications then it could easily

5146
01:21:05,590 --> 01:21:05,600
compactifications then it could easily
 

5147
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:07,030
compactifications then it could easily
be that so in other words

5148
01:21:07,030 --> 01:21:07,040
be that so in other words
 

5149
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:09,110
be that so in other words
it makes it much more possible that it

5150
01:21:09,110 --> 01:21:09,120
it makes it much more possible that it
 

5151
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:11,510
it makes it much more possible that it
could be theory of our universe so

5152
01:21:11,510 --> 01:21:11,520
could be theory of our universe so
 

5153
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:13,430
could be theory of our universe so
the fact that the dimension already is

5154
01:21:13,430 --> 01:21:13,440
the fact that the dimension already is
 

5155
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:14,550
the fact that the dimension already is
so small it

5156
01:21:14,550 --> 01:21:14,560
so small it
 

5157
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:16,629
so small it
should be surprising we don't ask that

5158
01:21:16,629 --> 01:21:16,639
should be surprising we don't ask that
 

5159
01:21:16,639 --> 01:21:18,870
should be surprising we don't ask that
question we should be surprised

5160
01:21:18,870 --> 01:21:18,880
question we should be surprised
 

5161
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:20,390
question we should be surprised
because we could have conceived of

5162
01:21:20,390 --> 01:21:20,400
because we could have conceived of
 

5163
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:22,310
because we could have conceived of
universes with our predimension

5164
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:22,320
universes with our predimension
 

5165
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:23,750
universes with our predimension
why is it that we have such a small

5166
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:23,760
why is it that we have such a small
 

5167
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,430
why is it that we have such a small
dimension that's number one

5168
01:21:25,430 --> 01:21:25,440
dimension that's number one
 

5169
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:28,149
dimension that's number one
so oh so so good theory of the universe

5170
01:21:28,149 --> 01:21:28,159
so oh so so good theory of the universe
 

5171
01:21:28,159 --> 01:21:30,229
so oh so so good theory of the universe
should give you an intuition of

5172
01:21:30,229 --> 01:21:30,239
should give you an intuition of
 

5173
01:21:30,239 --> 01:21:33,510
should give you an intuition of
the why it's four or three plus one

5174
01:21:33,510 --> 01:21:33,520
the why it's four or three plus one
 

5175
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:35,510
the why it's four or three plus one
and it's not obvious that it should be

5176
01:21:35,510 --> 01:21:35,520
and it's not obvious that it should be
 

5177
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:37,510
and it's not obvious that it should be
that that should be explained we take

5178
01:21:37,510 --> 01:21:37,520
that that should be explained we take
 

5179
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:38,870
that that should be explained we take
that as a

5180
01:21:38,870 --> 01:21:38,880
that as a
 

5181
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:42,149
that as a
as an assumption but that's a thing that

5182
01:21:42,149 --> 01:21:42,159
as an assumption but that's a thing that
 

5183
01:21:42,159 --> 01:21:43,270
as an assumption but that's a thing that
should be explained

5184
01:21:43,270 --> 01:21:43,280
should be explained
 

5185
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:44,550
should be explained
yeah so we haven't explained that in

5186
01:21:44,550 --> 01:21:44,560
yeah so we haven't explained that in
 

5187
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:46,550
yeah so we haven't explained that in
string here actually i did write a model

5188
01:21:46,550 --> 01:21:46,560
string here actually i did write a model
 

5189
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:48,149
string here actually i did write a model
within string theory to try to describe

5190
01:21:48,149 --> 01:21:48,159
within string theory to try to describe
 

5191
01:21:48,159 --> 01:21:50,229
within string theory to try to describe
why we end up with three

5192
01:21:50,229 --> 01:21:50,239
why we end up with three
 

5193
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:52,629
why we end up with three
uh plus one space time dimensions which

5194
01:21:52,629 --> 01:21:52,639
uh plus one space time dimensions which
 

5195
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:54,629
uh plus one space time dimensions which
are big compared to the rest of them

5196
01:21:54,629 --> 01:21:54,639
are big compared to the rest of them
 

5197
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:57,030
are big compared to the rest of them
and even though this has not been uh the

5198
01:21:57,030 --> 01:21:57,040
and even though this has not been uh the
 

5199
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:58,470
and even though this has not been uh the
technical difficulties to prove it

01:21:58,470 --> 01:21:58,480
technical difficulties to prove it
 

5201
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,709
technical difficulties to prove it
is is still not there but i will explain

5202
01:22:00,709 --> 01:22:00,719
is is still not there but i will explain
 

5203
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:01,510
is is still not there but i will explain
the idea

the idea
 

5205
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:02,950
the idea
because the idea connects to some other

which is the following consider a a
universe

5212
01:22:08,629 --> 01:22:08,639
universe
 

5213
01:22:08,639 --> 01:22:11,510
universe
made of a box three-dimensional box or

5214
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:11,520
made of a box three-dimensional box or
 

5215
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:11,990
made of a box three-dimensional box or
in fact

5216
01:22:11,990 --> 01:22:12,000
in fact
 

5217
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,189
in fact
if we start in string theory

5218
01:22:13,189 --> 01:22:13,199
if we start in string theory
 

5219
01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:14,629
if we start in string theory
nine-dimensional box because we have

5220
01:22:14,629 --> 01:22:14,639
nine-dimensional box because we have
 

5221
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:17,110
nine-dimensional box because we have
nine spatial dimensions at one time

5222
01:22:17,110 --> 01:22:17,120
nine spatial dimensions at one time
 

5223
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:20,149
nine spatial dimensions at one time
so imagine a nine-dimensional box

5224
01:22:20,149 --> 01:22:20,159
so imagine a nine-dimensional box
 

5225
01:22:20,159 --> 01:22:22,629
so imagine a nine-dimensional box
so we should imagine the box of the

5226
01:22:22,629 --> 01:22:22,639
so we should imagine the box of the
 

5227
01:22:22,639 --> 01:22:23,990
so we should imagine the box of the
typical size of the string which

5228
01:22:23,990 --> 01:22:24,000
typical size of the string which
 

5229
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,870
typical size of the string which
is small so the universe would naturally

5230
01:22:26,870 --> 01:22:26,880
is small so the universe would naturally
 

5231
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:27,270
is small so the universe would naturally
small

5232
01:22:27,270 --> 01:22:27,280

start with a very tiny nine dimensional

5234
01:22:29,030 --> 01:22:29,040
start with a very tiny nine dimensional

what do strings do well strings go you

5238
01:22:32,229 --> 01:22:32,239
what do strings do well strings go you
 

5239
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:34,470
what do strings do well strings go you
know go around the box and move around

5240
01:22:34,470 --> 01:22:34,480
know go around the box and move around
 

5241
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:36,390
know go around the box and move around
and vibrate and all that but also

5242
01:22:36,390 --> 01:22:36,400
and vibrate and all that but also
 

5243
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:38,470
and vibrate and all that but also
they can wrap around one side of the box

5244
01:22:38,470 --> 01:22:38,480
they can wrap around one side of the box
 

5245
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:40,229
they can wrap around one side of the box
to the other because

5246
01:22:40,229 --> 01:22:40,239
to the other because
 

5247
01:22:40,239 --> 01:22:41,910
to the other because
i'm imagining a box with periodic

5248
01:22:41,910 --> 01:22:41,920
i'm imagining a box with periodic
 

5249
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:43,430
i'm imagining a box with periodic
boundary conditions so what we call the

5250
01:22:43,430 --> 01:22:43,440
boundary conditions so what we call the
 

5251
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:44,470
boundary conditions so what we call the
torus

5252
01:22:44,470 --> 01:22:44,480
torus
 

5253
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:46,550
torus
so the string can go from one side to

5254
01:22:46,550 --> 01:22:46,560
so the string can go from one side to
 

5255
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:48,070
so the string can go from one side to
the other this is what we call a winding

5256
01:22:48,070 --> 01:22:48,080
the other this is what we call a winding
 

5257
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:49,750
the other this is what we call a winding
string the string can wind around the

5258
01:22:49,750 --> 01:22:49,760
string the string can wind around the
 

5259
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:51,669
string the string can wind around the
box

01:22:58,470 --> 01:22:58,480
starts to expand
 

5269
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:01,189
starts to expand
but it doesn't it doesn't expand too far

01:23:02,229 --> 01:23:02,239
why is it
 

5273
01:23:02,239 --> 01:23:04,550
why is it
well because there are these strings

5274
01:23:04,550 --> 01:23:04,560
well because there are these strings
 

5275
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:06,310
well because there are these strings
which are wrapped around from one side

5276
01:23:06,310 --> 01:23:06,320
which are wrapped around from one side
 

5277
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:07,990
which are wrapped around from one side
of the wall to the other

5278
01:23:07,990 --> 01:23:08,000
of the wall to the other
 

5279
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,590
of the wall to the other
when the universe the walls of the

5280
01:23:09,590 --> 01:23:09,600
when the universe the walls of the
 

5281
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:11,270
when the universe the walls of the
universe are growing

5282
01:23:11,270 --> 01:23:11,280
universe are growing
 

5283
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:13,110
universe are growing
it is stretching the string and the

5284
01:23:13,110 --> 01:23:13,120
it is stretching the string and the
 

5285
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:15,750
it is stretching the string and the
strings are becoming very very massive

5286
01:23:15,750 --> 01:23:15,760
strings are becoming very very massive
 

5287
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:17,669
strings are becoming very very massive
so it becomes difficult to expand it

5288
01:23:17,669 --> 01:23:17,679
so it becomes difficult to expand it
 

5289
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:20,550
so it becomes difficult to expand it
kind of puts a halt on it in order to

5290
01:23:20,550 --> 01:23:20,560
kind of puts a halt on it in order to
 

5291
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,310
kind of puts a halt on it in order to
not with a halt a string which is going

5292
01:23:22,310 --> 01:23:22,320
not with a halt a string which is going
 

5293
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:23,910
not with a halt a string which is going
this way and a thing which is going that

5294
01:23:23,910 --> 01:23:23,920
this way and a thing which is going that
 

5295
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:25,030
this way and a thing which is going that
way should

5296
01:23:25,030 --> 01:23:25,040
way should
 

5297
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:27,270
way should
should uh intersect each other and

5298
01:23:27,270 --> 01:23:27,280
should uh intersect each other and
 

5299
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:29,270
should uh intersect each other and
disconnect each other and unwind

5300
01:23:29,270 --> 01:23:29,280
disconnect each other and unwind
 

5301
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:31,189
disconnect each other and unwind
so a string which is winds this way and

5302
01:23:31,189 --> 01:23:31,199
so a string which is winds this way and
 

5303
01:23:31,199 --> 01:23:33,189
so a string which is winds this way and
the string which finds the opposite way

5304
01:23:33,189 --> 01:23:33,199
the string which finds the opposite way
 

5305
01:23:33,199 --> 01:23:35,990
the string which finds the opposite way
should find each other to to to

5306
01:23:35,990 --> 01:23:36,000
should find each other to to to
 

5307
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:36,870
should find each other to to to
reconnect

5308
01:23:36,870 --> 01:23:36,880
reconnect
 

5309
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:39,750
reconnect
and this way disappear so if they find

5310
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:39,760
and this way disappear so if they find
 

5311
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:41,030
and this way disappear so if they find
each other and they did these

5312
01:23:41,030 --> 01:23:41,040
each other and they did these
 

5313
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:43,189
each other and they did these
they disappear but how can strings find

5314
01:23:43,189 --> 01:23:43,199
they disappear but how can strings find
 

5315
01:23:43,199 --> 01:23:45,110
they disappear but how can strings find
each other well the string moves

5316
01:23:45,110 --> 01:23:45,120
each other well the string moves
 

5317
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:47,830
each other well the string moves
and another string moves a string is one

5318
01:23:47,830 --> 01:23:47,840
and another string moves a string is one
 

5319
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,990
and another string moves a string is one
dimensional one plus one is two

5320
01:23:49,990 --> 01:23:50,000
dimensional one plus one is two
 

5321
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,709
dimensional one plus one is two
and one plus one is two and two plus two

5322
01:23:52,709 --> 01:23:52,719
and one plus one is two and two plus two
 

5323
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:53,590
and one plus one is two and two plus two
is four

5324
01:23:53,590 --> 01:23:53,600
is four
 

5325
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:55,590
is four
in four dimensional space time they will

5326
01:23:55,590 --> 01:23:55,600
in four dimensional space time they will
 

5327
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:56,870
in four dimensional space time they will
find each other

5328
01:23:56,870 --> 01:23:56,880
find each other
 

5329
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:58,870
find each other
in a higher dimensional space time they

5330
01:23:58,870 --> 01:23:58,880
in a higher dimensional space time they
 

5331
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:00,550
in a higher dimensional space time they
typically miss each other

5332
01:24:00,550 --> 01:24:00,560
typically miss each other
 

5333
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:02,550
typically miss each other
oh interesting so if the dimensions were

5334
01:24:02,550 --> 01:24:02,560
oh interesting so if the dimensions were
 

5335
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:04,229
oh interesting so if the dimensions were
too big they would miss each other they

5336
01:24:04,229 --> 01:24:04,239
too big they would miss each other they
 

5337
01:24:04,239 --> 01:24:05,669
too big they would miss each other they
wouldn't be able to expand

5338
01:24:05,669 --> 01:24:05,679
wouldn't be able to expand
 

5339
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:07,669
wouldn't be able to expand
so in order to expand they have to find

5340
01:24:07,669 --> 01:24:07,679
so in order to expand they have to find
 

5341
01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:09,669
so in order to expand they have to find
each other and three of them can't find

5342
01:24:09,669 --> 01:24:09,679
each other and three of them can't find
 

5343
01:24:09,679 --> 01:24:11,430
each other and three of them can't find
each other and those can expand and the

5344
01:24:11,430 --> 01:24:11,440
each other and those can expand and the
 

5345
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:13,189
each other and those can expand and the
other one will be stuck so that explains

5346
01:24:13,189 --> 01:24:13,199
other one will be stuck so that explains
 

5347
01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:14,870
other one will be stuck so that explains
why within string theory these

5348
01:24:14,870 --> 01:24:14,880
why within string theory these
 

5349
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:16,470
why within string theory these

it turns out and it turns out the reason
it's difficult is the following it turns

5374
01:24:40,149 --> 01:24:40,159
it's difficult is the following it turns
 

5375
01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:40,870
it's difficult is the following it turns
out that in

5376
01:24:40,870 --> 01:24:40,880
out that in
 

5377
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:43,990
out that in
higher dimension you use you use

5378
01:24:43,990 --> 01:24:44,000
higher dimension you use you use
 

5379
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,590
higher dimension you use you use
what's called surgery in mathematical

5380
01:24:45,590 --> 01:24:45,600
what's called surgery in mathematical
 

5381
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:47,510
what's called surgery in mathematical
terminology where you use these two

5382
01:24:47,510 --> 01:24:47,520
terminology where you use these two
 

5383
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:49,030
terminology where you use these two
dimensional tubes

5384
01:24:49,030 --> 01:24:49,040
dimensional tubes
 

5385
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:51,510
dimensional tubes
to maneuver them off of each other so

5386
01:24:51,510 --> 01:24:51,520
to maneuver them off of each other so
 

5387
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:53,189
to maneuver them off of each other so
you have two plus two

5388
01:24:53,189 --> 01:24:53,199
you have two plus two
 

5389
01:24:53,199 --> 01:24:54,790
you have two plus two
becoming four and higher than four

5390
01:24:54,790 --> 01:24:54,800
becoming four and higher than four
 

5391
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:56,390
becoming four and higher than four
dimension you can pass them through each

5392
01:24:56,390 --> 01:24:56,400
dimension you can pass them through each
 

5393
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:57,030
dimension you can pass them through each
other

5394
01:24:57,030 --> 01:24:57,040
other
 

5395
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:59,270
other
without them intersecting in fourth

5396
01:24:59,270 --> 01:24:59,280
without them intersecting in fourth
 

5397
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:00,149
without them intersecting in fourth
dimension

5398
01:25:00,149 --> 01:25:00,159
dimension
 

5399
01:25:00,159 --> 01:25:03,350
dimension
two plus two doesn't allow you to pass

5400
01:25:03,350 --> 01:25:03,360
two plus two doesn't allow you to pass
 

5401
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:04,709
two plus two doesn't allow you to pass
them through each other so the same take

5402
01:25:04,709 --> 01:25:04,719
them through each other so the same take
 

5403
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:06,149
them through each other so the same take
things that work in higher dimension

5404
01:25:06,149 --> 01:25:06,159
things that work in higher dimension
 

5405
01:25:06,159 --> 01:25:07,590
things that work in higher dimension
don't work in four dimension

5406
01:25:07,590 --> 01:25:07,600
don't work in four dimension
 

5407
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:09,350
don't work in four dimension
because two plus two is four the same

5408
01:25:09,350 --> 01:25:09,360
because two plus two is four the same
 

5409
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:10,950
because two plus two is four the same
reasoning i was just telling you

5410
01:25:10,950 --> 01:25:10,960
reasoning i was just telling you
 

5411
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:13,110
reasoning i was just telling you
about strings finding each other and

5412
01:25:13,110 --> 01:25:13,120
about strings finding each other and
 

5413
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:15,350
about strings finding each other and
four ends up to be the reason why four

5414
01:25:15,350 --> 01:25:15,360
four ends up to be the reason why four
 

5415
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:16,950
four ends up to be the reason why four
is much more complicated

5416
01:25:16,950 --> 01:25:16,960
is much more complicated
 

5417
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:19,270
is much more complicated
to classify for mathematicians as well

5418
01:25:19,270 --> 01:25:19,280
to classify for mathematicians as well
 

5419
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:20,629
to classify for mathematicians as well
so so there might be these

5420
01:25:20,629 --> 01:25:20,639
so so there might be these
 

5421
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:22,790
so so there might be these
these things so i cannot say that this

5422
01:25:22,790 --> 01:25:22,800
these things so i cannot say that this
 

5423
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,709
these things so i cannot say that this
is the reason that string theory is

5424
01:25:24,709 --> 01:25:24,719
is the reason that string theory is
 

5425
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:26,070
is the reason that string theory is
is giving you three plus one but it

5426
01:25:26,070 --> 01:25:26,080
is giving you three plus one but it
 

5427
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:27,830
is giving you three plus one but it
could be a model for it and so

5428
01:25:27,830 --> 01:25:27,840
could be a model for it and so
 

5429
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:29,350
could be a model for it and so
so there are these kind of ideas that

5430
01:25:29,350 --> 01:25:29,360
so there are these kind of ideas that
 

5431
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:31,110
so there are these kind of ideas that
could underlie why

5432
01:25:31,110 --> 01:25:31,120
could underlie why
 

5433
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:32,550
could underlie why
we have three extra dimensions which are

5434
01:25:32,550 --> 01:25:32,560
we have three extra dimensions which are
 

5435
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:33,990
we have three extra dimensions which are
large and the rest of our small but

5436
01:25:33,990 --> 01:25:34,000
large and the rest of our small but
 

5437
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,750
large and the rest of our small but
absolutely we have to have a good reason

5438
01:25:35,750 --> 01:25:35,760
absolutely we have to have a good reason
 

5439
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:37,590
absolutely we have to have a good reason
we cannot leave it like that can i ask a

5440
01:25:37,590 --> 01:25:37,600
we cannot leave it like that can i ask a
 

5441
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:40,470
we cannot leave it like that can i ask a
tricky human question

5442
01:25:40,470 --> 01:25:40,480
tricky human question
 

5443
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:43,510
tricky human question
so you are one of the seminal figures

5444
01:25:43,510 --> 01:25:43,520
so you are one of the seminal figures
 

5445
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:44,950
so you are one of the seminal figures
in string theory you got the

5446
01:25:44,950 --> 01:25:44,960
in string theory you got the
 

5447
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:46,870
in string theory you got the
breakthrough prize you worked with

5448
01:25:46,870 --> 01:25:46,880

01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:01,750
it makes you quite sad especially big
like ligo big experimental projects when

01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:01,760
like ligo big experimental projects when
 

5463
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:02,709
like ligo big experimental projects when
so many

5464
01:26:02,709 --> 01:26:02,719
so many
 

5465
01:26:02,719 --> 01:26:04,870
so many
incredible people have been involved and

01:26:04,870 --> 01:26:04,880
incredible people have been involved and
 

5467
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:06,070
incredible people have been involved and
yet the nobel prize

5468
01:26:06,070 --> 01:26:06,080
yet the nobel prize
 

5469
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:07,910
yet the nobel prize
is annoying in that it's only given to

5470
01:26:07,910 --> 01:26:07,920
is annoying in that it's only given to
 

5471
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:09,830
is annoying in that it's only given to
three people who do you think

uh

5476
01:26:13,189 --> 01:26:13,199
uh
 

5477
01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:16,470
uh
at first if it turns out that it

5478
01:26:16,470 --> 01:26:16,480
at first if it turns out that it
 

5479
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:20,870
at first if it turns out that it
um if not in full then in part

um if not in full then in part
 

5481
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:24,229
um if not in full then in part
is is a good model of

01:26:24,229 --> 01:26:24,239
is is a good model of
 

5483
01:26:24,239 --> 01:26:26,070
is is a good model of
the way the physics of the universe

5484

the way the physics of the universe
 

5485
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:27,350
the way the physics of the universe

who are the key figures maybe let's put

5488
01:26:29,750 --> 01:26:29,760
who are the key figures maybe let's put
 

5489
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:30,950
who are the key figures maybe let's put
nobel prize aside

5490
01:26:30,950 --> 01:26:30,960
nobel prize aside
 

5491
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:32,790
nobel prize aside
or the key figures i like the second

5492
01:26:32,790 --> 01:26:32,800
or the key figures i like the second
 

5493
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:34,950
or the key figures i like the second
version of the question because i think

5494
01:26:34,950 --> 01:26:34,960
version of the question because i think
 

5495
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:36,790
version of the question because i think
to try to give a prize to one person in

5496
01:26:36,790 --> 01:26:36,800
to try to give a prize to one person in
 

5497
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,550
to try to give a prize to one person in
string there doesn't do justice to the

5498
01:26:38,550 --> 01:26:38,560
string there doesn't do justice to the
 

5499
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:40,629
string there doesn't do justice to the
diversity of the subject that to me is

5500
01:26:40,629 --> 01:26:40,639
diversity of the subject that to me is
 

5501
01:26:40,639 --> 01:26:42,550
diversity of the subject that to me is
so there was quite a lot of incredible

5502
01:26:42,550 --> 01:26:42,560
so there was quite a lot of incredible
 

5503
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:44,390
so there was quite a lot of incredible
people there in the history of quite a

5504
01:26:44,390 --> 01:26:44,400
people there in the history of quite a
 

5505
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:45,830
people there in the history of quite a
lot of people i mean starting with

5506
01:26:45,830 --> 01:26:45,840
lot of people i mean starting with
 

5507
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:47,830
lot of people i mean starting with
vanessa who wasn't talking about strings

5508
01:26:47,830 --> 01:26:47,840
vanessa who wasn't talking about strings
 

5509
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:49,510
vanessa who wasn't talking about strings
yes i mean he wrote down the the

5510
01:26:49,510 --> 01:26:49,520
yes i mean he wrote down the the
 

5511
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:50,870
yes i mean he wrote down the the
beginning of a string so we cannot

5512
01:26:50,870 --> 01:26:50,880
beginning of a string so we cannot
 

5513
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,709
beginning of a string so we cannot
ignore that for sure and so

5514
01:26:52,709 --> 01:26:52,719
ignore that for sure and so
 

5515
01:26:52,719 --> 01:26:54,470
ignore that for sure and so
so you start with that and you go on

5516
01:26:54,470 --> 01:26:54,480
so you start with that and you go on
 

5517
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:56,149
so you start with that and you go on
with various other figures and so on so

5518
01:26:56,149 --> 01:26:56,159
with various other figures and so on so
 

5519
01:26:56,159 --> 01:26:57,590
with various other figures and so on so
there are different epochs in string

5520
01:26:57,590 --> 01:26:57,600
there are different epochs in string
 

5521
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:58,070
there are different epochs in string
theory

5522
01:26:58,070 --> 01:26:58,080
theory
 

5523
01:26:58,080 --> 01:26:59,270
theory
yes and different people have been

5524
01:26:59,270 --> 01:26:59,280
yes and different people have been
 

5525
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:01,270
yes and different people have been
pushing it and so for example the early

5526
01:27:01,270 --> 01:27:01,280
pushing it and so for example the early
 

5527
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:03,750
pushing it and so for example the early
epoch we just told you people like uh

5528
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:03,760
epoch we just told you people like uh
 

5529
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:04,870
epoch we just told you people like uh
like veneziano

5530
01:27:04,870 --> 01:27:04,880
like veneziano
 

5531
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:07,030
like veneziano
and nambu and the saskan and others were

5532
01:27:07,030 --> 01:27:07,040
and nambu and the saskan and others were
 

5533
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:08,790
and nambu and the saskan and others were
pushing it green and shorts were pushing

5534
01:27:08,790 --> 01:27:08,800
pushing it green and shorts were pushing
 

5535
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:09,750
pushing it green and shorts were pushing
it and so forth

5536
01:27:09,750 --> 01:27:09,760
it and so forth
 

5537
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:11,830
it and so forth
so this was or shark and so on so these

5538
01:27:11,830 --> 01:27:11,840
so this was or shark and so on so these
 

5539
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:14,470
so this was or shark and so on so these
were the initial periods of

5540
01:27:14,470 --> 01:27:14,480
were the initial periods of
 

5541
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:16,709
were the initial periods of
pioneers i would say of string theory

5542
01:27:16,709 --> 01:27:16,719
pioneers i would say of string theory
 

5543
01:27:16,719 --> 01:27:18,790
pioneers i would say of string theory
and then there were there were the

5544
01:27:18,790 --> 01:27:18,800
and then there were there were the
 

5545
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:21,110
and then there were there were the
mid 80s that uh edward whitten was the

5546
01:27:21,110 --> 01:27:21,120
mid 80s that uh edward whitten was the
 

5547
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:22,870
mid 80s that uh edward whitten was the
major proponent of string theory and he

5548
01:27:22,870 --> 01:27:22,880
major proponent of string theory and he
 

5549
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:23,910
major proponent of string theory and he
really

5550
01:27:23,910 --> 01:27:23,920
really
 

5551
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:25,669
really
changed the landscape of string theory

5552
01:27:25,669 --> 01:27:25,679
changed the landscape of string theory
 

5553
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:27,430
changed the landscape of string theory
in terms of what people do and how

5554
01:27:27,430 --> 01:27:27,440
in terms of what people do and how
 

5555
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:29,910
in terms of what people do and how
how we view it and i think his efforts

5556
01:27:29,910 --> 01:27:29,920
how we view it and i think his efforts
 

5557
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:31,990
how we view it and i think his efforts
brought a lot of attention to the

5558
01:27:31,990 --> 01:27:32,000
brought a lot of attention to the
 

5559
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,350
brought a lot of attention to the
community about

5560
01:27:33,350 --> 01:27:33,360
community about
 

5561
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:35,510
community about
a high energy community to focus on this

5562
01:27:35,510 --> 01:27:35,520
a high energy community to focus on this
 

5563
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:37,350
a high energy community to focus on this
effort as the correct theory of

5564
01:27:37,350 --> 01:27:37,360
effort as the correct theory of
 

5565
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:39,030
effort as the correct theory of
unification of forces so he brought a

5566
01:27:39,030 --> 01:27:39,040
unification of forces so he brought a
 

5567
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:41,110
unification of forces so he brought a
lot of research as well as of course the

5568
01:27:41,110 --> 01:27:41,120
lot of research as well as of course the
 

5569
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:43,030
lot of research as well as of course the
first rate work he himself did

5570
01:27:43,030 --> 01:27:43,040
first rate work he himself did
 

5571
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:45,510
first rate work he himself did
to this area so that's in 80s and

5572
01:27:45,510 --> 01:27:45,520
to this area so that's in 80s and
 

5573
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:47,669
to this area so that's in 80s and
onwards and also in mid 90s where he

5574
01:27:47,669 --> 01:27:47,679
onwards and also in mid 90s where he
 

5575
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:49,590
onwards and also in mid 90s where he
was one of the proponents of the duality

5576
01:27:49,590 --> 01:27:49,600
was one of the proponents of the duality
 

5577
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:51,590
was one of the proponents of the duality
revolution in string theory

revolution in string theory
 

5579
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:53,669
revolution in string theory
and with that came a lot of these other

5580
01:27:53,669 --> 01:27:53,679
and with that came a lot of these other
 

5581
01:27:53,679 --> 01:27:54,790
and with that came a lot of these other

i i feel and in my work most of my work

5636
01:28:43,590 --> 01:28:43,600
i i feel and in my work most of my work
 

5637
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:44,790
i i feel and in my work most of my work
is with colleagues

01:28:44,790 --> 01:28:44,800
is with colleagues
 

5639
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:47,430
is with colleagues
i have much more collaborations than

5640
01:28:47,430 --> 01:28:47,440
i have much more collaborations than
 

5641
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:49,189
i have much more collaborations than
soul author papers

5642
01:28:49,189 --> 01:28:49,199
soul author papers
 

5643
01:28:49,199 --> 01:28:51,510
soul author papers
and i enjoy it and i think that that's

5644
01:28:51,510 --> 01:28:51,520
and i enjoy it and i think that that's
 

5645
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:53,189
and i enjoy it and i think that that's
to me one of the most satisfying aspects

5646
01:28:53,189 --> 01:28:53,199
to me one of the most satisfying aspects
 

5647
01:28:53,199 --> 01:28:54,390
to me one of the most satisfying aspects
of science

5648
01:28:54,390 --> 01:28:54,400
of science
 

5649
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:57,750
of science
is to interact and learn and

5650
01:28:57,750 --> 01:28:57,760
is to interact and learn and
 

5651
01:28:57,760 --> 01:28:59,510
is to interact and learn and
debate ideas with colleagues because

5652
01:28:59,510 --> 01:28:59,520
debate ideas with colleagues because
 

5653
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:02,070
debate ideas with colleagues because
that influx of ideas enriches it

5654
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:02,080
that influx of ideas enriches it
 

5655
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:05,590
that influx of ideas enriches it
and that's why i i find it interesting

5656
01:29:05,590 --> 01:29:05,600
and that's why i i find it interesting
 

5657
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:08,229
and that's why i i find it interesting
to me science if i was in an island and

5658
01:29:08,229 --> 01:29:08,239
to me science if i was in an island and
 

5659
01:29:08,239 --> 01:29:09,830
to me science if i was in an island and
if i was developing strength here by

5660
01:29:09,830 --> 01:29:09,840
if i was developing strength here by
 

5661
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:11,350
if i was developing strength here by
myself and had nothing to do with

5662
01:29:11,350 --> 01:29:11,360
myself and had nothing to do with
 

5663
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:13,110
myself and had nothing to do with
anybody it would be much less satisfying

5664
01:29:13,110 --> 01:29:13,120
anybody it would be much less satisfying
 

5665
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:14,070
anybody it would be much less satisfying
in my opinion

5666
01:29:14,070 --> 01:29:14,080
in my opinion
 

5667
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:16,629
in my opinion
even if i could take credit i did it

5668
01:29:16,629 --> 01:29:16,639
even if i could take credit i did it
 

5669
01:29:16,639 --> 01:29:17,110
even if i could take credit i did it
yeah

5670
01:29:17,110 --> 01:29:17,120
yeah
 

5671
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:19,189
yeah
it won't be as satisfying sitting alone

5672
01:29:19,189 --> 01:29:19,199
it won't be as satisfying sitting alone
 

5673
01:29:19,199 --> 01:29:20,950
it won't be as satisfying sitting alone
with the yeah with a big metal

5674
01:29:20,950 --> 01:29:20,960
with the yeah with a big metal
 

5675
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:23,510
with the yeah with a big metal
drinking champagne no i think i think to

5676
01:29:23,510 --> 01:29:23,520
drinking champagne no i think i think to
 

5677
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:25,750
drinking champagne no i think i think to
me the collective work is more exciting

5678
01:29:25,750 --> 01:29:25,760
me the collective work is more exciting
 

5679
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:26,470
me the collective work is more exciting
and

5680
01:29:26,470 --> 01:29:26,480
and
 

5681
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:27,669
and
you mentioned my getting the

you mentioned my getting the
 

5683
01:29:27,679 --> 01:29:29,510
you mentioned my getting the
breakthrough when i was getting it i

5684
01:29:29,510 --> 01:29:29,520
breakthrough when i was getting it i
 

5685
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:31,510
breakthrough when i was getting it i
made sure to mention that it is because

5686
01:29:31,510 --> 01:29:31,520
made sure to mention that it is because
 

5687
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:33,350
made sure to mention that it is because
of the joint work that i've done with

5688

01:29:40,390 --> 01:29:40,400
in the in the web page for them i write
 

5697
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:41,350
in the in the web page for them i write
all of their names and the

5698
01:29:41,350 --> 01:29:41,360
all of their names and the
 

5699
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:43,189
all of their names and the
collaborations that led to this so

5700
01:29:43,189 --> 01:29:43,199
collaborations that led to this so
 

5701
01:29:43,199 --> 01:29:45,030
collaborations that led to this so
to me science is fun when it's

5702
01:29:45,030 --> 01:29:45,040
to me science is fun when it's
 

5703
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:46,470
to me science is fun when it's
collaboration

5704
01:29:46,470 --> 01:29:46,480
collaboration
 

5705
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:48,709
collaboration
and yes there are more important and

5706
01:29:48,709 --> 01:29:48,719
and yes there are more important and
 

5707
01:29:48,719 --> 01:29:51,110
and yes there are more important and
less important figures as in any field

5708
01:29:51,110 --> 01:29:51,120
less important figures as in any field
 

5709
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:52,709
less important figures as in any field
and that's true that's true in strength

5710
01:29:52,709 --> 01:29:52,719
and that's true that's true in strength
 

5711
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:54,310
and that's true that's true in strength
here as well but i think that

5712
01:29:54,310 --> 01:29:54,320
here as well but i think that
 

5713
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:56,070
here as well but i think that
i would like to view this as a

5714
01:29:56,070 --> 01:29:56,080
i would like to view this as a
 

5715
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:57,430
i would like to view this as a
collective effort so

5716
01:29:57,430 --> 01:29:57,440
collective effort so
 

5717
01:29:57,440 --> 01:30:01,910
collective effort so
setting the heroes aside the nobel prize

5718
01:30:01,910 --> 01:30:01,920
setting the heroes aside the nobel prize
 

5719
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:04,709
setting the heroes aside the nobel prize
is a celebration of um what's the right

5720
01:30:04,709 --> 01:30:04,719
is a celebration of um what's the right
 

5721
01:30:04,719 --> 01:30:05,750
is a celebration of um what's the right
way to put it

5722
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:05,760
way to put it
 

5723
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:09,430
way to put it
that this idea turned out to be right

5724
01:30:09,430 --> 01:30:09,440
that this idea turned out to be right
 

5725
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:11,750
that this idea turned out to be right
so like you look at uh einstein didn't

5726
01:30:11,750 --> 01:30:11,760
so like you look at uh einstein didn't
 

5727
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:12,950
so like you look at uh einstein didn't
believe in black holes

5728
01:30:12,950 --> 01:30:12,960
believe in black holes
 

5729
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:15,910
believe in black holes
right and then black holes got their

5730
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:15,920
right and then black holes got their
 

5731
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:17,110
right and then black holes got their
nobel prize

5732
01:30:17,110 --> 01:30:17,120
nobel prize
 

5733
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:19,350
nobel prize
right do you think string theory will

5734
01:30:19,350 --> 01:30:19,360
right do you think string theory will
 

5735
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:20,229
right do you think string theory will
get

5736
01:30:20,229 --> 01:30:20,239
get
 

5737
01:30:20,239 --> 01:30:23,669
get
its nobel prize nobel prizes

5738
01:30:23,669 --> 01:30:23,679
its nobel prize nobel prizes
 

5739
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:25,830
its nobel prize nobel prizes
if you were to bet money if this was

5740
01:30:25,830 --> 01:30:25,840
if you were to bet money if this was
 

5741
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:27,669
if you were to bet money if this was
like if this was an investment meeting

5742
01:30:27,669 --> 01:30:27,679
like if this was an investment meeting
 

5743
01:30:27,679 --> 01:30:28,550
like if this was an investment meeting
and we had to bet

5744
01:30:28,550 --> 01:30:28,560
and we had to bet
 

5745
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:30,709
and we had to bet
all our money do you think he gets the

5746
01:30:30,709 --> 01:30:30,719
all our money do you think he gets the
 

5747
01:30:30,719 --> 01:30:31,910
all our money do you think he gets the
nobel prizes

5748
01:30:31,910 --> 01:30:31,920
nobel prizes
 

5749
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:33,590
nobel prizes
i think it's possible that none of the

5750
01:30:33,590 --> 01:30:33,600
i think it's possible that none of the
 

5751
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,110
i think it's possible that none of the
living physicists will get the nobel

5752
01:30:35,110 --> 01:30:35,120
living physicists will get the nobel
 

5753
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:37,910
living physicists will get the nobel
prize on string theory but somebody will

5754
01:30:37,910 --> 01:30:37,920
prize on string theory but somebody will
 

5755
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:40,070
prize on string theory but somebody will
because because unfortunately the

5756
01:30:40,070 --> 01:30:40,080
because because unfortunately the
 

5757
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:42,310
because because unfortunately the
technology available today is not very

5758
01:30:42,310 --> 01:30:42,320
technology available today is not very
 

5759
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:42,950
technology available today is not very
encouraging

5760
01:30:42,950 --> 01:30:42,960
encouraging
 

5761
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:45,669
encouraging
in terms of seeing directly evidence for

5762
01:30:45,669 --> 01:30:45,679
in terms of seeing directly evidence for
 

5763
01:30:45,679 --> 01:30:46,870
in terms of seeing directly evidence for
string theory do you think this

5764
01:30:46,870 --> 01:30:46,880
string theory do you think this
 

5765
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:47,990
string theory do you think this
ultimately boils down

5766
01:30:47,990 --> 01:30:48,000
ultimately boils down
 

5767
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:49,669
ultimately boils down
to the nobel prize will be given when

5768
01:30:49,669 --> 01:30:49,679
to the nobel prize will be given when
 

5769
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:51,110
to the nobel prize will be given when
there is some

5770
01:30:51,110 --> 01:30:51,120
there is some
 

5771
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:53,750
there is some
direct or indirect evidence there would

5772
01:30:53,750 --> 01:30:53,760
direct or indirect evidence there would
 

5773
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:54,390
direct or indirect evidence there would
be but

5774
01:30:54,390 --> 01:30:54,400
be but
 

5775
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:55,910
be but
uh but i think that part of this

5776
01:30:55,910 --> 01:30:55,920
uh but i think that part of this
 

5777
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:58,070
uh but i think that part of this
breakthrough prize was precisely the

5778
01:30:58,070 --> 01:30:58,080
breakthrough prize was precisely the
 

5779
01:30:58,080 --> 01:30:59,590
breakthrough prize was precisely the
appreciation that when we have

5780
01:30:59,590 --> 01:30:59,600
appreciation that when we have
 

5781
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:01,350
appreciation that when we have
sufficient evidence

5782
01:31:01,350 --> 01:31:01,360
sufficient evidence
 

5783
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:04,149
sufficient evidence
theoretical as it is and not experiment

5784
01:31:04,149 --> 01:31:04,159
theoretical as it is and not experiment
 

5785
01:31:04,159 --> 01:31:05,030
theoretical as it is and not experiment
because of this

5786
01:31:05,030 --> 01:31:05,040
because of this
 

5787
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:07,270
because of this
technology lag you appreciate what what

5788
01:31:07,270 --> 01:31:07,280
technology lag you appreciate what what
 

5789
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:08,870
technology lag you appreciate what what
you think is the correct path

5790
01:31:08,870 --> 01:31:08,880
you think is the correct path
 

5791
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:10,310
you think is the correct path
so there are many people who have been

5792
01:31:10,310 --> 01:31:10,320
so there are many people who have been
 

5793
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:12,470
so there are many people who have been
have been recognized precisely

5794
01:31:12,470 --> 01:31:12,480
have been recognized precisely
 

5795
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:14,470
have been recognized precisely
because they may not be around when it

5796
01:31:14,470 --> 01:31:14,480
because they may not be around when it
 

5797
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:16,070
because they may not be around when it
actually gets experimented

5798
01:31:16,070 --> 01:31:16,080
actually gets experimented
 

5799
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:18,390
actually gets experimented
even though they discovered it so so

5800
01:31:18,390 --> 01:31:18,400
even though they discovered it so so
 

5801
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:19,590
even though they discovered it so so
there are there are many things like

5802
01:31:19,590 --> 01:31:19,600
there are there are many things like
 

5803
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:20,950
there are there are many things like
that that's going on in

5804
01:31:20,950 --> 01:31:20,960
that that's going on in
 

5805
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:23,030
that that's going on in
in science so i think that i would i

5806
01:31:23,030 --> 01:31:23,040
in science so i think that i would i
 

5807
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:24,070
in science so i think that i would i
would want to attach

5808
01:31:24,070 --> 01:31:24,080
would want to attach
 

5809
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:27,669
would want to attach
less significance to the recognitions

5810
01:31:27,669 --> 01:31:27,679
less significance to the recognitions
 

5811
01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:30,070
less significance to the recognitions
of people and i i have i have a i have a

5812
01:31:30,070 --> 01:31:30,080
of people and i i have i have a i have a
 

5813
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:32,390
of people and i i have i have a i have a
second review on this which is

5814
01:31:32,390 --> 01:31:32,400
second review on this which is
 

5815
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:34,790
second review on this which is
there are people who you know who look

5816
01:31:34,790 --> 01:31:34,800
there are people who you know who look
 

5817
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:36,390
there are people who you know who look
at these works that people have done

5818
01:31:36,390 --> 01:31:36,400
at these works that people have done
 

5819
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:38,149
at these works that people have done
and put them together and you know make

5820
01:31:38,149 --> 01:31:38,159
and put them together and you know make
 

5821
01:31:38,159 --> 01:31:39,910
and put them together and you know make
the next big breakthrough

5822
01:31:39,910 --> 01:31:39,920
the next big breakthrough
 

5823
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:42,870
the next big breakthrough
and they get identified with you know

5824
01:31:42,870 --> 01:31:42,880
and they get identified with you know
 

5825
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:43,990
and they get identified with you know
perhaps rightly with

5826
01:31:43,990 --> 01:31:44,000
perhaps rightly with
 

5827
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,910
perhaps rightly with
many of these you know new new visions

5828
01:31:47,910 --> 01:31:47,920
many of these you know new new visions
 

5829
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:49,510
many of these you know new new visions
but they are on the shoulders of these

5830
01:31:49,510 --> 01:31:49,520
but they are on the shoulders of these
 

5831
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:51,350
but they are on the shoulders of these
little scientists yes

5832
01:31:51,350 --> 01:31:51,360
little scientists yes
 

5833
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:54,229
little scientists yes
which don't get any recognition you know

5834
01:31:54,229 --> 01:31:54,239
which don't get any recognition you know
 

5835
01:31:54,239 --> 01:31:55,669
which don't get any recognition you know
yeah you did this little work oh yeah

5836
01:31:55,669 --> 01:31:55,679
yeah you did this little work oh yeah
 

5837
01:31:55,679 --> 01:31:56,629
yeah you did this little work oh yeah
you did this little

5838
01:31:56,629 --> 01:31:56,639
you did this little
 

5839
01:31:56,639 --> 01:31:58,070
you did this little
work oh yeah yeah five of you oh yeah

5840
01:31:58,070 --> 01:31:58,080
work oh yeah yeah five of you oh yeah
 

5841
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:59,430
work oh yeah yeah five of you oh yeah
this showed this pattern and then

5842
01:31:59,430 --> 01:31:59,440
this showed this pattern and then
 

5843
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:00,390
this showed this pattern and then
somebody else

5844
01:32:00,390 --> 01:32:00,400
somebody else
 

5845
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:03,110
somebody else
it's not fair yeah to me to me those

5846
01:32:03,110 --> 01:32:03,120
it's not fair yeah to me to me those
 

5847
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:04,070
it's not fair yeah to me to me those
little guys

5848
01:32:04,070 --> 01:32:04,080
little guys
 

5849
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:06,310
little guys
which which kind of like like seem to do

5850
01:32:06,310 --> 01:32:06,320
which which kind of like like seem to do
 

5851
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:07,750
which which kind of like like seem to do
a little calculation here a little thing

5852
01:32:07,750 --> 01:32:07,760
a little calculation here a little thing
 

5853
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:08,870
a little calculation here a little thing
there which is not doesn't

5854
01:32:08,870 --> 01:32:08,880
there which is not doesn't
 

5855
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:10,229
there which is not doesn't
doesn't rise to the occasion of this

5856
01:32:10,229 --> 01:32:10,239
doesn't rise to the occasion of this
 

5857
01:32:10,239 --> 01:32:12,229
doesn't rise to the occasion of this
grandiose kind of thing doesn't make it

to the new york times
 

5861
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:16,149
to the new york times
headlines and so on deserve a lot of

5862
01:32:16,149 --> 01:32:16,159
headlines and so on deserve a lot of
 

5863
01:32:16,159 --> 01:32:17,990
headlines and so on deserve a lot of
recognition and i think they don't get

5864
01:32:17,990 --> 01:32:18,000
recognition and i think they don't get
 

5865
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,430
recognition and i think they don't get
enough i would say that

5866

enough i would say that
 

5867
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:21,669
enough i would say that
there should be this nobel prize for you

5868

there should be this nobel prize for you
 

5869
01:32:21,679 --> 01:32:22,790
there should be this nobel prize for you
know they have these

5870
01:32:22,790 --> 01:32:22,800
know they have these
 

5871
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:24,470
know they have these
doctors without borders a huge group

doctors without borders a huge group
 

5873
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:25,910
doctors without borders a huge group
they should do similar thing

5874
01:32:25,910 --> 01:32:25,920
they should do similar thing
 

5875
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:27,350
they should do similar thing
these string theories without borders

5876
01:32:27,350 --> 01:32:27,360
these string theories without borders
 

5877
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:29,270

01:34:49,430 --> 01:34:49,440
mind of the way you approached science
 

6019
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:51,510
mind of the way you approached science
and physics and mathematics

6020
01:34:51,510 --> 01:34:51,520
and physics and mathematics
 

6021
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:54,310
and physics and mathematics
how did he uh perturb that trajectory

6022
01:34:54,310 --> 01:34:54,320
how did he uh perturb that trajectory
 

6023
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:54,709
how did he uh perturb that trajectory
yes

6024
01:34:54,709 --> 01:34:54,719
yes
 

6025
01:34:54,719 --> 01:34:56,790
yes
he did actually so i can explain because

6026
01:34:56,790 --> 01:34:56,800
he did actually so i can explain because
 

6027
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:57,830
he did actually so i can explain because
when i was a student i

6028
01:34:57,830 --> 01:34:57,840
when i was a student i
 

6029
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:01,189
when i was a student i
i i the biggest impact by him uh clearly

6030
01:35:01,189 --> 01:35:01,199
i i the biggest impact by him uh clearly
 

6031
01:35:01,199 --> 01:35:02,550
i i the biggest impact by him uh clearly
as a grad student at princeton so i

6032
01:35:02,550 --> 01:35:02,560
as a grad student at princeton so i
 

6033
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:03,189
as a grad student at princeton so i
think

6034
01:35:03,189 --> 01:35:03,199
think
 

6035
01:35:03,199 --> 01:35:04,790
think
that was the time where i was a little

6036
01:35:04,790 --> 01:35:04,800
that was the time where i was a little
 

6037
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:06,550
that was the time where i was a little
bit confused

6038
01:35:06,550 --> 01:35:06,560
bit confused
 

6039
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:08,229
bit confused
about the relation between math and

6040
01:35:08,229 --> 01:35:08,239
about the relation between math and
 

6041
01:35:08,239 --> 01:35:10,229
about the relation between math and
physics i got a double major in

6042
01:35:10,229 --> 01:35:10,239
physics i got a double major in
 

6043
01:35:10,239 --> 01:35:12,870
physics i got a double major in
mathematics and physics at mit

6044
01:35:12,870 --> 01:35:12,880
mathematics and physics at mit
 

6045
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:14,870
mathematics and physics at mit
and because i really enjoyed both and i

6046
01:35:14,870 --> 01:35:14,880
and because i really enjoyed both and i
 

6047
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:16,390
and because i really enjoyed both and i
write the elegance and the

6048
01:35:16,390 --> 01:35:16,400
write the elegance and the
 

6049
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:19,189
write the elegance and the
rigor of mathematics and i like the

6050
01:35:19,189 --> 01:35:19,199
rigor of mathematics and i like the
 

6051
01:35:19,199 --> 01:35:21,350
rigor of mathematics and i like the
power of ideas and physics and its

6052
01:35:21,350 --> 01:35:21,360
power of ideas and physics and its
 

6053
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:23,189
power of ideas and physics and its
applicability to reality and what it

6054
01:35:23,189 --> 01:35:23,199
applicability to reality and what it
 

6055
01:35:23,199 --> 01:35:24,390
applicability to reality and what it
teaches about

6056
01:35:24,390 --> 01:35:24,400
teaches about
 

6057
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:27,350
teaches about
the real world around us but i saw this

6058
01:35:27,350 --> 01:35:27,360
the real world around us but i saw this
 

6059
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:29,270
the real world around us but i saw this
tension between

6060
01:35:29,270 --> 01:35:29,280
tension between
 

6061
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:31,910
tension between
rigorous thinking in mathematics and

6062
01:35:31,910 --> 01:35:31,920
rigorous thinking in mathematics and
 

6063
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:33,910
rigorous thinking in mathematics and
lack thereof in physics and this

6064
01:35:33,910 --> 01:35:33,920
lack thereof in physics and this
 

6065
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:37,030
lack thereof in physics and this
troubled me to no end i was troubled by

6066
01:35:37,030 --> 01:35:37,040
troubled me to no end i was troubled by
 

6067
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:37,990
troubled me to no end i was troubled by
that

6068
01:35:37,990 --> 01:35:38,000
that
 

6069
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,629
that
so i was at crossroads when i decided to

6070
01:35:40,629 --> 01:35:40,639
so i was at crossroads when i decided to
 

6071
01:35:40,639 --> 01:35:42,149
so i was at crossroads when i decided to
go to graduate school in physics

6072
01:35:42,149 --> 01:35:42,159
go to graduate school in physics
 

6073
01:35:42,159 --> 01:35:44,229
go to graduate school in physics
because i did not like some of the lack

6074
01:35:44,229 --> 01:35:44,239
because i did not like some of the lack
 

6075
01:35:44,239 --> 01:35:47,030
because i did not like some of the lack
of rigors i was seeing in physics

6076
01:35:47,030 --> 01:35:47,040
of rigors i was seeing in physics
 

6077
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:48,950
of rigors i was seeing in physics
on the other hand to me mathematics even

6078
01:35:48,950 --> 01:35:48,960
on the other hand to me mathematics even
 

6079
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:50,709
on the other hand to me mathematics even
though it was rigorous something it it

6080
01:35:50,709 --> 01:35:50,719
though it was rigorous something it it
 

6081
01:35:50,719 --> 01:35:52,790
though it was rigorous something it it
sometimes were i didn't see the point of

6082
01:35:52,790 --> 01:35:52,800
sometimes were i didn't see the point of
 

6083
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:54,310
sometimes were i didn't see the point of
it in other words

6084
01:35:54,310 --> 01:35:54,320
it in other words
 

6085
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:56,070
it in other words
when i see when i see you know the math

6086
01:35:56,070 --> 01:35:56,080
when i see when i see you know the math
 

6087
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:57,430
when i see when i see you know the math
theorem by itself could be beautiful but

6088
01:35:57,430 --> 01:35:57,440
theorem by itself could be beautiful but
 

6089
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:58,950
theorem by itself could be beautiful but
i really wanted more than that i want to

6090
01:35:58,950 --> 01:35:58,960
i really wanted more than that i want to
 

6091
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:00,550
i really wanted more than that i want to
say okay what did it teach us about

6092
01:36:00,550 --> 01:36:00,560
say okay what did it teach us about
 

6093
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:02,229
say okay what did it teach us about
something else something more than just

6094
01:36:02,229 --> 01:36:02,239
something else something more than just
 

6095
01:36:02,239 --> 01:36:02,790
something else something more than just
math

6096
01:36:02,790 --> 01:36:02,800
math
 

6097
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:04,550
math
so i wasn't i wasn't that enamored with

6098
01:36:04,550 --> 01:36:04,560
so i wasn't i wasn't that enamored with
 

6099
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:06,709
so i wasn't i wasn't that enamored with
just math but physics was a little bit

6100
01:36:06,709 --> 01:36:06,719
just math but physics was a little bit
 

6101
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:08,310
just math but physics was a little bit
bothersome nevertheless i decided to go

6102
01:36:08,310 --> 01:36:08,320
bothersome nevertheless i decided to go
 

6103
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:09,669
bothersome nevertheless i decided to go
to physics and i decided to go to

6104
01:36:09,669 --> 01:36:09,679
to physics and i decided to go to
 

6105
01:36:09,679 --> 01:36:10,790
to physics and i decided to go to
princeton

6106
01:36:10,790 --> 01:36:10,800
princeton
 

6107
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:12,870
princeton
and i started working with edward

6108
01:36:12,870 --> 01:36:12,880
and i started working with edward
 

6109
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:15,910
and i started working with edward
whitten as my thesis advisor

6110
01:36:15,910 --> 01:36:15,920
whitten as my thesis advisor
 

6111
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:19,669
whitten as my thesis advisor
and um at that time i was trying to

6112
01:36:19,669 --> 01:36:19,679
and um at that time i was trying to
 

6113
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:21,910
and um at that time i was trying to
put physics in rigorous mathematical

6114
01:36:21,910 --> 01:36:21,920
put physics in rigorous mathematical
 

6115
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:23,669
put physics in rigorous mathematical
terms i took quantum fifth theory

6116
01:36:23,669 --> 01:36:23,679
terms i took quantum fifth theory
 

6117
01:36:23,679 --> 01:36:25,750
terms i took quantum fifth theory
i tried to make rigorous out of it and

6118
01:36:25,750 --> 01:36:25,760
i tried to make rigorous out of it and
 

6119
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:26,709
i tried to make rigorous out of it and
so on

6120
01:36:26,709 --> 01:36:26,719
so on
 

6121
01:36:26,719 --> 01:36:29,109
so on
and no matter how hard i was trying i

6122
01:36:29,109 --> 01:36:29,119
and no matter how hard i was trying i
 

6123
01:36:29,119 --> 01:36:29,750
and no matter how hard i was trying i
was not

6124
01:36:29,750 --> 01:36:29,760
was not
 

6125
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:32,550
was not
being able to do that and i was falling

6126
01:36:32,550 --> 01:36:32,560
being able to do that and i was falling
 

6127
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:34,149
being able to do that and i was falling
behind from my classes i was not

6128
01:36:34,149 --> 01:36:34,159
behind from my classes i was not
 

6129
01:36:34,159 --> 01:36:34,870
behind from my classes i was not
learning

6130
01:36:34,870 --> 01:36:34,880
learning
 

6131
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:36,470
learning
much physics and i was not making it

6132
01:36:36,470 --> 01:36:36,480
much physics and i was not making it
 

6133
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:38,070
much physics and i was not making it
rigorous and to me

6134
01:36:38,070 --> 01:36:38,080
rigorous and to me
 

6135
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:39,910
rigorous and to me
it was this dichotomy between math and

6136
01:36:39,910 --> 01:36:39,920
it was this dichotomy between math and
 

6137
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:42,149
it was this dichotomy between math and
physics what am i doing i like math but

6138
01:36:42,149 --> 01:36:42,159
physics what am i doing i like math but
 

6139
01:36:42,159 --> 01:36:43,109
physics what am i doing i like math but
this is not

6140
01:36:43,109 --> 01:36:43,119
this is not
 

6141
01:36:43,119 --> 01:36:46,790
this is not
exactly risk there comes ed written as

my advisor and i see him in action

6144
01:36:48,950 --> 01:36:48,960
my advisor and i see him in action
 

6145
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:51,990
my advisor and i see him in action
thinking about math and physics

6146
01:36:51,990 --> 01:36:52,000
thinking about math and physics
 

6147
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,229
thinking about math and physics
he was amazing in math he knew all about

6148
01:36:54,229 --> 01:36:54,239
he was amazing in math he knew all about
 

6149
01:36:54,239 --> 01:36:56,070
he was amazing in math he knew all about
the math it was no problem with him

6150
01:36:56,070 --> 01:36:56,080
the math it was no problem with him
 

6151
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:58,390
the math it was no problem with him
but he thought about physics in a way

6152
01:36:58,390 --> 01:36:58,400
but he thought about physics in a way
 

6153
01:36:58,400 --> 01:36:59,270
but he thought about physics in a way
which did not

6154
01:36:59,270 --> 01:36:59,280
which did not
 

6155
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:02,550
which did not
find this tension between the two

6156
01:37:02,550 --> 01:37:02,560
find this tension between the two
 

6157
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:04,870
find this tension between the two
it was much more harmonious for him he

6158
01:37:04,870 --> 01:37:04,880
it was much more harmonious for him he
 

6159
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:06,629
it was much more harmonious for him he
would draw the feynman diagrams but he

6160
01:37:06,629 --> 01:37:06,639
would draw the feynman diagrams but he
 

6161
01:37:06,639 --> 01:37:07,189
would draw the feynman diagrams but he
wouldn't

6162
01:37:07,189 --> 01:37:07,199
wouldn't
 

6163
01:37:07,199 --> 01:37:09,270
wouldn't
view it as a formalism he was viewed oh

6164
01:37:09,270 --> 01:37:09,280
view it as a formalism he was viewed oh
 

6165
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:10,550
view it as a formalism he was viewed oh
yeah the particle goes over there and

6166
01:37:10,550 --> 01:37:10,560
yeah the particle goes over there and
 

6167
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:11,990
yeah the particle goes over there and
this is what's going on and

6168
01:37:11,990 --> 01:37:12,000
this is what's going on and
 

6169
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,510
this is what's going on and
so wait you're thinking really is this

6170
01:37:13,510 --> 01:37:13,520
so wait you're thinking really is this
 

6171
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:14,790
so wait you're thinking really is this
particle this virtual this is really

6172
01:37:14,790 --> 01:37:14,800
particle this virtual this is really
 

6173
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:15,990
particle this virtual this is really
electron going there right

6174
01:37:15,990 --> 01:37:16,000
electron going there right
 

6175
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:17,990
electron going there right
yeah it's not it's not the formula

6176
01:37:17,990 --> 01:37:18,000
yeah it's not it's not the formula
 

6177
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,750
yeah it's not it's not the formula
perturbation no no

6178
01:37:19,750 --> 01:37:19,760

you just feel like the electron you're

6180
01:37:21,270 --> 01:37:21,280
you just feel like the electron you're
 

6181
01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:22,790
you just feel like the electron you're
moving with this guy and do that and so

6182
01:37:22,790 --> 01:37:22,800
moving with this guy and do that and so
 

6183
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:24,390
moving with this guy and do that and so
on and you're thinking invariantly about

6184
01:37:24,390 --> 01:37:24,400
on and you're thinking invariantly about
 

6185
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:26,070
on and you're thinking invariantly about
physics or the way he thought about

6186
01:37:26,070 --> 01:37:26,080
physics or the way he thought about
 

6187
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:28,550
physics or the way he thought about
relativity like you know i was thinking

6188
01:37:28,550 --> 01:37:28,560
relativity like you know i was thinking
 

6189
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:29,990
relativity like you know i was thinking
about you know this momentum says he was

6190
01:37:29,990 --> 01:37:30,000
about you know this momentum says he was
 

6191
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,590
about you know this momentum says he was
thinking invariantly about physics just

6192
01:37:31,590 --> 01:37:31,600
thinking invariantly about physics just
 

6193
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:32,390
thinking invariantly about physics just
like the way

6194
01:37:32,390 --> 01:37:32,400
like the way
 

6195
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:33,990
like the way
you think about invariant concepts in

6196
01:37:33,990 --> 01:37:34,000
you think about invariant concepts in
 

6197
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:35,350
you think about invariant concepts in
relativity which don't depend on the

6198
01:37:35,350 --> 01:37:35,360
relativity which don't depend on the

relativity which don't depend on the
frame of reference

01:37:38,550 --> 01:37:38,560
he was thinking about the physics in in
 

6203
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:39,669
he was thinking about the physics in in
variant ways that

6204
01:37:39,669 --> 01:37:39,679
variant ways that
 

6205
01:37:39,679 --> 01:37:42,229
variant ways that
the way that doesn't gives you a bigger

the way that doesn't gives you a bigger
 

6207
01:37:42,239 --> 01:37:43,350
the way that doesn't gives you a bigger
perspective so

6208
01:37:43,350 --> 01:37:43,360
perspective so
 

6209
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:47,430
perspective so
this gradually helped me appreciate that

6210
01:37:47,430 --> 01:37:47,440
this gradually helped me appreciate that
 

6211
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:49,270
this gradually helped me appreciate that

01:37:59,270 --> 01:37:59,280
rigorously define what i mean by this
 

6223
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:00,790
rigorously define what i mean by this
but this thing connects with this other

and they together form an elegant story
 

6229
01:38:06,239 --> 01:38:08,709
and they together form an elegant story
and that replaced for me what i believed

6230
01:38:08,709 --> 01:38:08,719
and that replaced for me what i believed
 

6231
01:38:08,719 --> 01:38:11,030
and that replaced for me what i believed
as a solidness which i found in math as

6232
01:38:11,030 --> 01:38:11,040
as a solidness which i found in math as
 

6233
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:11,910
as a solidness which i found in math as
a rigor

6234
01:38:11,910 --> 01:38:11,920
a rigor
 

6235
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:14,310
a rigor
and was solid i found that replaced the

6236
01:38:14,310 --> 01:38:14,320
and was solid i found that replaced the
 

6237
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:16,070
and was solid i found that replaced the
rigor and solidness in physics

6238
01:38:16,070 --> 01:38:16,080
rigor and solidness in physics
 

6239
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:18,149
rigor and solidness in physics
so i found okay that's the way you can

6240
01:38:18,149 --> 01:38:18,159
so i found okay that's the way you can
 

6241
01:38:18,159 --> 01:38:19,109
so i found okay that's the way you can

it was more than that and it was no

sequence of properties of the space
which is the topological

6342
01:39:52,870 --> 01:39:52,880
which is the topological
 

6343
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:55,990
which is the topological
property of a space so holy cat axis of

01:39:55,990 --> 01:39:56,000
property of a space so holy cat axis of
 

6345
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,830
property of a space so holy cat axis of
the calabia was a property of the space

6346
01:39:57,830 --> 01:39:57,840
the calabia was a property of the space
 

6347
01:39:57,840 --> 01:39:59,270
the calabia was a property of the space
and so

6348
01:39:59,270 --> 01:39:59,280
and so
 

6349
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:01,030
and so
we noticed that from the physics

6350
01:40:01,030 --> 01:40:01,040
we noticed that from the physics
 

6351
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:03,430
we noticed that from the physics
formalism if string moves in a calabia

6353
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:06,229
formalism if string moves in a calabia
you cannot distinguish we cannot compute

6354
01:40:06,229 --> 01:40:06,239
you cannot distinguish we cannot compute
 

6355
01:40:06,239 --> 01:40:07,669
you cannot distinguish we cannot compute
the euler characteristic you can only

6356
01:40:07,669 --> 01:40:07,679
the euler characteristic you can only
 

6357
01:40:07,679 --> 01:40:10,229
the euler characteristic you can only
compute the absolute value of it

6358
01:40:10,229 --> 01:40:10,239
compute the absolute value of it
 

6359
01:40:10,239 --> 01:40:12,390
compute the absolute value of it
now this bothered us because how could

6360
01:40:12,390 --> 01:40:12,400
now this bothered us because how could
 

6361
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:15,590
now this bothered us because how could
it do not compute the actual sign

6362
01:40:15,590 --> 01:40:15,600
it do not compute the actual sign
 

6363
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:18,870
it do not compute the actual sign
unless the both sides were the same

6364
01:40:18,870 --> 01:40:18,880
unless the both sides were the same
 

6365
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:21,030
unless the both sides were the same
so i conjectured maybe for every calabia

6366
01:40:21,030 --> 01:40:21,040
so i conjectured maybe for every calabia
 

6367
01:40:21,040 --> 01:40:22,229
so i conjectured maybe for every calabia

that i'm making this conjecture is it
 

6377
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:33,669
that i'm making this conjecture is it
possible that for every calabia there's

how
 

6397
01:40:47,679 --> 01:40:50,310
how
so we conjectured that for every calabia

6398
01:40:50,310 --> 01:40:50,320
so we conjectured that for every calabia
 

6399
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:51,669
so we conjectured that for every calabia
with one side there's the other one

so this is actually the opposite view

6418
01:41:09,109 --> 01:41:09,119
so this is actually the opposite view
 

6419
01:41:09,119 --> 01:41:11,430
so this is actually the opposite view
that is physics is so sure about it

okay very good question so let's go back

6464
01:41:49,510 --> 01:41:49,520
okay very good question so let's go back
 

6465
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:51,350
okay very good question so let's go back
to what i was describing about feinman

6466
01:41:51,350 --> 01:41:51,360
to what i was describing about feinman
 

6467
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:53,750
to what i was describing about feinman
yes feinman was trying to do these

6468
01:41:53,750 --> 01:41:53,760
yes feinman was trying to do these
 

6469
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:55,669
yes feinman was trying to do these

he's getting infinities he cannot
 

6475
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:01,109
he's getting infinities he cannot

6476
01:42:01,109 --> 01:42:01,119
resolve
 

6477
01:42:01,119 --> 01:42:03,270

okay the natural conclusion is that

6478
01:42:03,270 --> 01:42:03,280
okay the natural conclusion is that
 

6479
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:05,109
okay the natural conclusion is that

rare exceptions work so string theory
 

6517

rare exceptions work so string theory
are those rare exceptions

are those rare exceptions
so therefore the general principle that

01:44:16,719 --> 01:44:18,629
that same list
so you can take any group but only fine

so you can take any group but only fine
 

6615

beautiful field theories
 

6631
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:35,990
beautiful field theories
but not when you include gravity so

6632
01:44:35,990 --> 01:44:36,000
but not when you include gravity so
 

6633
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:37,830
but not when you include gravity so
so then this becomes a hopeful thing so

6634
01:44:37,830 --> 01:44:37,840
so then this becomes a hopeful thing so
 

6635
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:40,229
so then this becomes a hopeful thing so

now is this joule subset small or large
 

6643
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:52,950
now is this joule subset small or large
yeah it turns out that subset is

01:44:52,950 --> 01:44:52,960
yeah it turns out that subset is
 

6645
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:57,270
yeah it turns out that subset is
humongous but we believe still finite

the fact that they're humongous is the

01:47:27,030 --> 01:47:27,040
particle because what you can do
 

6807
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:28,470
particle because what you can do
you can take a charged particle and

6808
01:47:28,470 --> 01:47:28,480
you can take a charged particle and
 

6809
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:30,390
you can take a charged particle and
throw it into a charged black hole

6810
01:47:30,390 --> 01:47:30,400
throw it into a charged black hole
 

6811
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:32,790
throw it into a charged black hole
and wait it to evaporate and by the

6812
01:47:32,790 --> 01:47:32,800
and wait it to evaporate and by the
 

6813
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:34,310
and wait it to evaporate and by the
looking at the properties of evaporation

6814
01:47:34,310 --> 01:47:34,320
looking at the properties of evaporation
 

6815
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:35,270
looking at the properties of evaporation
you find that

6816
01:47:35,270 --> 01:47:35,280
you find that
 

6817
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:37,910
you find that
if it cannot evaporate particles whose

6818
01:47:37,910 --> 01:47:37,920
if it cannot evaporate particles whose
 

6819
01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:39,430
if it cannot evaporate particles whose
mass is less than their charge

6820
01:47:39,430 --> 01:47:39,440
mass is less than their charge
 

6821
01:47:39,440 --> 01:47:41,109
mass is less than their charge
then it will never evaporate you'll be

6822
01:47:41,109 --> 01:47:41,119
then it will never evaporate you'll be
 

6823
01:47:41,119 --> 01:47:43,590
then it will never evaporate you'll be
stuck and so the possibility of a black

6824
01:47:43,590 --> 01:47:43,600
stuck and so the possibility of a black
 

6825
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:45,590
stuck and so the possibility of a black
hole evaporation forces you to have

6826
01:47:45,590 --> 01:47:45,600
hole evaporation forces you to have
 

6827
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:46,470
hole evaporation forces you to have
particles

6828
01:47:46,470 --> 01:47:46,480
particles
 

6829
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:48,870
particles
whose mass is sufficiently small so that

6830
01:47:48,870 --> 01:47:48,880
whose mass is sufficiently small so that
 

6831
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:50,390
whose mass is sufficiently small so that
the gravity is weaker

the gravity is weaker
 

6833
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:52,550
the gravity is weaker
so you connect this fact to the other

6834
01:47:52,550 --> 01:47:52,560
so you connect this fact to the other
 

6835
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:54,229
so you connect this fact to the other
fact so we begin to find

6836
01:47:54,229 --> 01:47:54,239
fact so we begin to find
 

6837
01:47:54,239 --> 01:47:55,990
fact so we begin to find
different facts that reinforce each

6838
01:47:55,990 --> 01:47:56,000
different facts that reinforce each
 

6839
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,430
different facts that reinforce each
other so different

6840
01:47:57,430 --> 01:47:57,440
other so different
 

6841
01:47:57,440 --> 01:47:59,030
other so different
parts of the physics reinforce each

6842
01:47:59,030 --> 01:47:59,040
parts of the physics reinforce each
 

6843
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:00,470
parts of the physics reinforce each
other and once they all

other and once they all
 

6845
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:02,870
other and once they all
kind of come together you believe that

6846
01:48:02,870 --> 01:48:02,880
kind of come together you believe that
 

6847
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:04,310
kind of come together you believe that
you're getting the principle correct so

6848
01:48:04,310 --> 01:48:04,320
you're getting the principle correct so
 

6849
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:05,830
you're getting the principle correct so
weak gravity conjecture is one of the

we later learned that one of the circles

we later learned that one of the circles

01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:26,870
we later learned that one of the circles
of string theory itself was

7140
01:52:26,870 --> 01:52:26,880
of string theory itself was
 

7141
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:29,830
of string theory itself was
tiny that we had not appreciated that

7142
01:52:29,830 --> 01:52:29,840
tiny that we had not appreciated that
 

7143
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:31,589
tiny that we had not appreciated that
fact and we discovered by doing thought

7144
01:52:31,589 --> 01:52:31,599
fact and we discovered by doing thought
 

7145
01:52:31,599 --> 01:52:33,030
fact and we discovered by doing thought
experiments and string theory that

7146
01:52:33,030 --> 01:52:33,040
experiments and string theory that
 

7147
01:52:33,040 --> 01:52:34,870
experiments and string theory that
there's got to be an extra circle

7148
01:52:34,870 --> 01:52:34,880
there's got to be an extra circle
 

7149
01:52:34,880 --> 01:52:36,550
there's got to be an extra circle
and that circle is connected to an

7150
01:52:36,550 --> 01:52:36,560
and that circle is connected to an
 

7151
01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:38,229
and that circle is connected to an
11-dimensional perspective

7152
01:52:38,229 --> 01:52:38,239
11-dimensional perspective
 

7153
01:52:38,239 --> 01:52:39,990
11-dimensional perspective
and that's what later on god's called m

7154
01:52:39,990 --> 01:52:40,000
and that's what later on god's called m
 

7155
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,350
and that's what later on god's called m

i would just give you an example and

and so it's more subtle than so what
 

7215

01:54:52,470 --> 01:54:52,480
well suppose you do that and you shrink
 

7299
01:54:52,480 --> 01:54:53,589
well suppose you do that and you shrink
it and say well they get smaller and

7300
01:54:53,589 --> 01:54:53,599
it and say well they get smaller and
 

7301
01:54:53,599 --> 01:54:55,589
it and say well they get smaller and
smaller so what i said well

7302
01:54:55,589 --> 01:54:55,599
smaller so what i said well
 

7303
01:54:55,599 --> 01:54:57,030
smaller so what i said well
it turns out in string theory there are

01:54:57,030 --> 01:54:57,040
it turns out in string theory there are
 

7305
01:54:57,040 --> 01:55:00,390
it turns out in string theory there are
two different kinds of photons

two different kinds of photons
 

7307
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:02,550
two different kinds of photons
one photon measures one over l the other

7308
01:55:02,550 --> 01:55:02,560
one photon measures one over l the other
 

7309
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:04,629
one photon measures one over l the other
one measures l

7310
01:55:04,629 --> 01:55:04,639
one measures l
 

7311
01:55:04,639 --> 01:55:07,430
one measures l
and so this duality reformulates oh fast

7312
01:55:07,430 --> 01:55:07,440
and so this duality reformulates oh fast

01:55:07,440 --> 01:55:08,950
and so this duality reformulates oh fast
and when the space gets smaller it says

01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:10,149
and when the space gets smaller it says
oh no you better use the bigger

7316
01:55:10,149 --> 01:55:10,159
oh no you better use the bigger
 

7317
01:55:10,159 --> 01:55:11,430
oh no you better use the bigger
perspective because the smaller one is

7318
01:55:11,430 --> 01:55:11,440
perspective because the smaller one is
 

7319
01:55:11,440 --> 01:55:12,870
perspective because the smaller one is
harder to deal with

7320
01:55:12,870 --> 01:55:12,880
harder to deal with
 

7321
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:15,189
harder to deal with
so you do this one so so these examples

7322
01:55:15,189 --> 01:55:15,199
so you do this one so so these examples
 

7323
01:55:15,199 --> 01:55:16,470
so you do this one so so these examples
of loop quantum gravity have none of

7324
01:55:16,470 --> 01:55:16,480
of loop quantum gravity have none of
 

7325
01:55:16,480 --> 01:55:17,990
of loop quantum gravity have none of
these features these features that i'm

01:55:17,990 --> 01:55:18,000
these features these features that i'm
 

7327
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,189
these features these features that i'm
telling you about we have learned from

7328
01:55:19,189 --> 01:55:19,199
telling you about we have learned from
 

7329
01:55:19,199 --> 01:55:20,070
telling you about we have learned from
string theory

7330
01:55:20,070 --> 01:55:20,080
string theory
 

7331
01:55:20,080 --> 01:55:21,589

but they nevertheless have some of these

7332
01:55:21,589 --> 01:55:21,599
but they nevertheless have some of these
 

7333
01:55:21,599 --> 01:55:23,510
but they nevertheless have some of these
ideas like topological as gravity

7334
01:55:23,510 --> 01:55:23,520
ideas like topological as gravity
 

7335
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:24,390

7337
01:55:24,400 --> 01:55:27,189

are emphasizing the context of loop

are emphasizing the context of loop
 

7339
01:55:27,199 --> 01:55:28,870
are emphasizing the context of loop
quantum gravity in some form and so

7340
01:55:28,870 --> 01:55:28,880
quantum gravity in some form and so
 

7341
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:30,470
quantum gravity in some form and so
these ideas might be there in some

7342
01:55:30,470 --> 01:55:30,480
these ideas might be there in some
 

7343
01:55:30,480 --> 01:55:31,109
these ideas might be there in some

in some corners of string there in fact
 

7347
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:34,950
in some corners of string there in fact
i wrote a paper about topological string

7348
01:55:34,950 --> 01:55:34,960
i wrote a paper about topological string
 

7349
01:55:34,960 --> 01:55:36,629
i wrote a paper about topological string
theory and some connections with

7350
01:55:36,629 --> 01:55:36,639
theory and some connections with
 

7351
01:55:36,639 --> 01:55:38,229
theory and some connections with
potentially loop quantum gravity which

7352
01:55:38,229 --> 01:55:38,239
potentially loop quantum gravity which
 

7353
01:55:38,239 --> 01:55:39,830
potentially loop quantum gravity which
could be part of that so there are

7354
01:55:39,830 --> 01:55:39,840
could be part of that so there are
 

7355
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:40,310
could be part of that so there are
little

7356
01:55:40,310 --> 01:55:40,320
little
 

7357
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:43,030
little
facets of connections i wouldn't say

7358
01:55:43,030 --> 01:55:43,040
facets of connections i wouldn't say
 

7359
01:55:43,040 --> 01:55:44,790
facets of connections i wouldn't say
they're complete but i would say

01:55:44,790 --> 01:55:44,800
they're complete but i would say
 

7361
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:46,310
they're complete but i would say
most probably what will happen to some

01:55:46,310 --> 01:55:46,320
most probably what will happen to some
 

7363
01:55:46,320 --> 01:55:48,310

let me ask a crazy out there question
can physics

7372
01:55:55,990 --> 01:55:56,000
can physics
 

7373
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:01,109
can physics
help us understand life so

7374
01:56:01,109 --> 01:56:01,119
help us understand life so
 

7375
01:56:01,119 --> 01:56:04,629
help us understand life so
uh we spoke so confidently

7376
01:56:04,629 --> 01:56:04,639
uh we spoke so confidently
 

7377
01:56:04,639 --> 01:56:06,629
uh we spoke so confidently
about the laws of physics being able to

01:56:06,629 --> 01:56:06,639
about the laws of physics being able to
 

7379
01:56:06,639 --> 01:56:08,070
about the laws of physics being able to
explain reality but

7380
01:56:08,070 --> 01:56:08,080
explain reality but
 

7381
01:56:08,080 --> 01:56:10,790
explain reality but
and we even said words like theory of

7382
01:56:10,790 --> 01:56:10,800
and we even said words like theory of
 

7383
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:11,830
and we even said words like theory of
everything

7384
01:56:11,830 --> 01:56:11,840
everything
 

7385
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:13,750

is it possible that the four

01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:20,550
is it possible that the four
laws we've been talking about are

laws we've been talking about are
 

7393
01:56:20,560 --> 01:56:22,149
laws we've been talking about are
actually missing

01:56:22,159 --> 01:56:23,830
actually missing
they are accurate in describing what

they are accurate in describing what

01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:25,430
they are accurate in describing what

the description of a lot of other things
 

7401
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:29,030

like
emergence of life uh and

emergence of life uh and
 

7405
01:56:32,320 --> 01:56:35,510

there
 

7409
01:56:36,320 --> 01:56:38,390
there
do you ever think about this kind of

7410
01:56:38,390 --> 01:56:38,400
do you ever think about this kind of
 

7411
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:40,149
do you ever think about this kind of
stuff where

7412
01:56:40,149 --> 01:56:40,159
stuff where
 

7413
01:56:40,159 --> 01:56:43,430

we would need to understand extra

we call

we call
 

7423
01:56:53,280 --> 01:56:56,390
we call
life and consciousness in this big

so first of all we don't claim that

7430
01:57:02,950 --> 01:57:02,960
so first of all we don't claim that
 

7431
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:03,910
so first of all we don't claim that
string theory is

string theory is
 

7433
01:57:03,920 --> 01:57:05,430
string theory is
the theory of everything in the sense

itself we are learning it so i wouldn't
 

7441
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:12,310
itself we are learning it so i wouldn't
say okay give me whatever i will tell

say okay give me whatever i will tell
 

7443
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:14,310

any form of reality i call it physics

01:57:22,480 --> 01:57:24,390
any form of reality i call it physics
that's my definition i mean i may not

01:57:24,390 --> 01:57:24,400
that's my definition i mean i may not
 

7455
01:57:24,400 --> 01:57:24,790
that's my definition i mean i may not
know

7456

know
 

7457
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:27,109
know
a lot of it like maybe the origin of

01:57:27,109 --> 01:57:27,119
a lot of it like maybe the origin of
 

7459
01:57:27,119 --> 01:57:29,109
a lot of it like maybe the origin of
life and so on maybe a piece of that

01:57:29,109 --> 01:57:29,119
life and so on maybe a piece of that
 

7461
01:57:29,119 --> 01:57:30,790
life and so on maybe a piece of that
but i would call that as part of physics

but i would call that as part of physics

to say no you know from this point

7480
01:57:45,830 --> 01:57:45,840
to say no you know from this point
 

7481
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:47,510
to say no you know from this point
onwards it's not my territory somebody

7482
01:57:47,510 --> 01:57:47,520
onwards it's not my territory somebody

but whether we need new ideas on string

7486
01:57:50,550 --> 01:57:50,560
but whether we need new ideas on string
 

7487
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:52,070
but whether we need new ideas on string
clear to describe other reality

7488
01:57:52,070 --> 01:57:52,080
clear to describe other reality
 

7489
01:57:52,080 --> 01:57:54,070
clear to describe other reality
reality features for sure i believe as i

7490
01:57:54,070 --> 01:57:54,080
reality features for sure i believe as i
 

7491
01:57:54,080 --> 01:57:55,350
reality features for sure i believe as i
mentioned i don't believe

7492
01:57:55,350 --> 01:57:55,360
mentioned i don't believe
 

7493
01:57:55,360 --> 01:57:57,510
mentioned i don't believe
any things any of the laws we know today

7494
01:57:57,510 --> 01:57:57,520
any things any of the laws we know today
 

7495
01:57:57,520 --> 01:57:59,990
any things any of the laws we know today
is final so therefore yes we will need

7496
01:57:59,990 --> 01:58:00,000
is final so therefore yes we will need
 

7497
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,310
is final so therefore yes we will need
new ideas this is a very tricky thing

7498
01:58:02,310 --> 01:58:02,320
new ideas this is a very tricky thing
 

7499
01:58:02,320 --> 01:58:05,270
new ideas this is a very tricky thing
for us to understand

7500
01:58:05,270 --> 01:58:05,280
for us to understand
 

7501
01:58:05,280 --> 01:58:09,270
for us to understand
and uh be precise about but

7502
01:58:09,270 --> 01:58:09,280
and uh be precise about but
 

7503
01:58:09,280 --> 01:58:12,709
and uh be precise about but
just because you understand the physics

7504
01:58:12,709 --> 01:58:12,719
just because you understand the physics
 

7505
01:58:12,719 --> 01:58:15,990
just because you understand the physics
doesn't necessarily mean that

7506
01:58:15,990 --> 01:58:16,000
doesn't necessarily mean that
 

7507
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:17,910
doesn't necessarily mean that
you understand the emergence of

7508
01:58:17,910 --> 01:58:17,920
you understand the emergence of
 

7509
01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:20,870
you understand the emergence of
chemistry biology

7510
01:58:20,870 --> 01:58:20,880
chemistry biology
 

7511
01:58:20,880 --> 01:58:24,550
chemistry biology
life intelligence consciousness so those

7512
01:58:24,550 --> 01:58:24,560
life intelligence consciousness so those
 

7513
01:58:24,560 --> 01:58:27,669
life intelligence consciousness so those
are built it's like you might understand

7514
01:58:27,669 --> 01:58:27,679
are built it's like you might understand
 

7515
01:58:27,679 --> 01:58:28,950
are built it's like you might understand
the way

7516
01:58:28,950 --> 01:58:28,960
the way
 

7517
01:58:28,960 --> 01:58:31,830
the way
bricks work yes but to understand what

7518
01:58:31,830 --> 01:58:31,840
bricks work yes but to understand what
 

7519
01:58:31,840 --> 01:58:32,390
bricks work yes but to understand what
it

7520
01:58:32,390 --> 01:58:32,400
it
 

7521
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:35,589
it
means to have a happy family right you

7522
01:58:35,589 --> 01:58:35,599
means to have a happy family right you
 

7523
01:58:35,599 --> 01:58:37,030
means to have a happy family right you
you don't construct you don't get from

7524
01:58:37,030 --> 01:58:37,040
you don't construct you don't get from
 

7525
01:58:37,040 --> 01:58:39,109
you don't construct you don't get from
the bricks so directly

7526
01:58:39,109 --> 01:58:39,119
the bricks so directly
 

7527
01:58:39,119 --> 01:58:42,310
the bricks so directly
you you right in theory you could uh

7528
01:58:42,310 --> 01:58:42,320
you you right in theory you could uh
 

7529
01:58:42,320 --> 01:58:45,189
you you right in theory you could uh
if you ran the universe over again but

7530
01:58:45,189 --> 01:58:45,199
if you ran the universe over again but
 

7531
01:58:45,199 --> 01:58:45,510
if you ran the universe over again but
just

7532
01:58:45,510 --> 01:58:45,520
just
 

7533
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:47,350
just
understanding the rules of the universe

7534
01:58:47,350 --> 01:58:47,360
understanding the rules of the universe
 

7535
01:58:47,360 --> 01:58:48,870
understanding the rules of the universe
doesn't necessarily give you

7536
01:58:48,870 --> 01:58:48,880
doesn't necessarily give you
 

7537
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:51,510
doesn't necessarily give you
a sense of the weird beautiful things

7538
01:58:51,510 --> 01:58:51,520
a sense of the weird beautiful things
 

7539
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:52,149
a sense of the weird beautiful things
that emerge

7540
01:58:52,149 --> 01:58:52,159
that emerge
 

7541
01:58:52,159 --> 01:58:54,229
that emerge
right no so let me let me describe what

7542
01:58:54,229 --> 01:58:54,239
right no so let me let me describe what
 

7543
01:58:54,239 --> 01:58:55,189
right no so let me let me describe what
you just said

7544
01:58:55,189 --> 01:58:55,199
you just said
 

7545
01:58:55,199 --> 01:58:56,470
you just said
so there are two questions one is

7546
01:58:56,470 --> 01:58:56,480
so there are two questions one is
 

7547
01:58:56,480 --> 01:58:58,470
so there are two questions one is
whether or not the techniques are used

7548
01:58:58,470 --> 01:58:58,480
whether or not the techniques are used
 

7549
01:58:58,480 --> 01:58:59,990
whether or not the techniques are used
and let's say quantum field theory and

7550
01:58:59,990 --> 01:59:00,000
and let's say quantum field theory and
 

7551
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:01,830
and let's say quantum field theory and
so on will describe how the society

7552
01:59:01,830 --> 01:59:01,840
so on will describe how the society
 

7553
01:59:01,840 --> 01:59:02,310
so on will describe how the society
works

7554
01:59:02,310 --> 01:59:02,320
works
 

7555
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:05,270
works
yes okay that's far distance far for

7556
01:59:05,270 --> 01:59:05,280
yes okay that's far distance far for
 

7557
01:59:05,280 --> 01:59:06,709
yes okay that's far distance far for
different scales of questions that we're

7558
01:59:06,709 --> 01:59:06,719
different scales of questions that we're
 

7559
01:59:06,719 --> 01:59:08,149
different scales of questions that we're
asking here

7560
01:59:08,149 --> 01:59:08,159
asking here
 

7561
01:59:08,159 --> 01:59:10,629
asking here
the question is is there a change of is

7562
01:59:10,629 --> 01:59:10,639
the question is is there a change of is
 

7563
01:59:10,639 --> 01:59:12,790
the question is is there a change of is
there a new law which takes over

7564
01:59:12,790 --> 01:59:12,800
there a new law which takes over
 

7565
01:59:12,800 --> 01:59:14,870
there a new law which takes over
that cannot be connected to the other

7566
01:59:14,870 --> 01:59:14,880
that cannot be connected to the other
 

7567
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:16,149
that cannot be connected to the other
laws that we know

7568
01:59:16,149 --> 01:59:16,159
laws that we know
 

7569
01:59:16,159 --> 01:59:17,990
laws that we know
or of more fundamental laws that we know

7570
01:59:17,990 --> 01:59:18,000
or of more fundamental laws that we know
 

7571
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,229
or of more fundamental laws that we know
do you need new laws to describe it

7572
01:59:20,229 --> 01:59:20,239
do you need new laws to describe it
 

7573
01:59:20,239 --> 01:59:21,589
do you need new laws to describe it
i don't think that's necessarily the

7574
01:59:21,589 --> 01:59:21,599
i don't think that's necessarily the
 

7575
01:59:21,599 --> 01:59:23,030
i don't think that's necessarily the
case in many of these phenomena like

7576
01:59:23,030 --> 01:59:23,040
case in many of these phenomena like
 

7577
01:59:23,040 --> 01:59:25,189
case in many of these phenomena like
chemistry or so on you mentioned

7578
01:59:25,189 --> 01:59:25,199
chemistry or so on you mentioned
 

7579
01:59:25,199 --> 01:59:27,030
chemistry or so on you mentioned
so we do expect you know in principle

7580
01:59:27,030 --> 01:59:27,040
so we do expect you know in principle
 

7581
01:59:27,040 --> 01:59:28,950
so we do expect you know in principle
chemistry can be described by quantum

7582
01:59:28,950 --> 01:59:28,960
chemistry can be described by quantum
 

7583
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:30,550
chemistry can be described by quantum
mechanics we don't think there's going

7584
01:59:30,550 --> 01:59:30,560
mechanics we don't think there's going
 

7585
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:32,229
mechanics we don't think there's going
to be a magical thing but chemistry is

7586
01:59:32,229 --> 01:59:32,239
to be a magical thing but chemistry is
 

7587
01:59:32,239 --> 01:59:33,270
to be a magical thing but chemistry is
complicated yeah

7588
01:59:33,270 --> 01:59:33,280
complicated yeah
 

7589
01:59:33,280 --> 01:59:35,270
complicated yeah
indeed there are rules of chemistry that

7590
01:59:35,270 --> 01:59:35,280
indeed there are rules of chemistry that
 

7591
01:59:35,280 --> 01:59:36,629
indeed there are rules of chemistry that
you know chemists have put down which

7592
01:59:36,629 --> 01:59:36,639
you know chemists have put down which
 

7593
01:59:36,639 --> 01:59:38,310
you know chemists have put down which
has not been explained yet using quantum

7594
01:59:38,310 --> 01:59:38,320
has not been explained yet using quantum
 

7595
01:59:38,320 --> 01:59:40,629
has not been explained yet using quantum
mechanics do i believe that they will be

7596
01:59:40,629 --> 01:59:40,639
mechanics do i believe that they will be
 

7597
01:59:40,639 --> 01:59:42,149
mechanics do i believe that they will be
something described by quantum mechanics

7598
01:59:42,149 --> 01:59:42,159
something described by quantum mechanics
 

7599
01:59:42,159 --> 01:59:43,750
something described by quantum mechanics
yes i do i don't think they are going to

7600
01:59:43,750 --> 01:59:43,760
yes i do i don't think they are going to
 

7601
01:59:43,760 --> 01:59:44,790
yes i do i don't think they are going to
be sitting there

7602
01:59:44,790 --> 01:59:44,800
be sitting there
 

7603
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:46,310
be sitting there
in this just forever but maybe it's too

7604
01:59:46,310 --> 01:59:46,320
in this just forever but maybe it's too
 

7605
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:48,310
in this just forever but maybe it's too
complicated and maybe you know we

7606
01:59:48,310 --> 01:59:48,320
complicated and maybe you know we
 

7607
01:59:48,320 --> 01:59:49,750
complicated and maybe you know we
will wait for very powerful quantum

7608
01:59:49,750 --> 01:59:49,760
will wait for very powerful quantum
 

7609
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:51,270
will wait for very powerful quantum
computers or what not to solve those

7610
01:59:51,270 --> 01:59:51,280
computers or what not to solve those
 

7611
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:52,550
computers or what not to solve those
problems i don't know

7612
01:59:52,550 --> 01:59:52,560
problems i don't know
 

7613
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:54,790
problems i don't know
but i don't think in that context we

7614
01:59:54,790 --> 01:59:54,800
but i don't think in that context we
 

7615
01:59:54,800 --> 01:59:57,189
but i don't think in that context we
have no principles to be added to fix

7616
01:59:57,189 --> 01:59:57,199
have no principles to be added to fix
 

7617
01:59:57,199 --> 01:59:59,910
have no principles to be added to fix
those so by i'm perfectly fine

7618
01:59:59,910 --> 01:59:59,920
those so by i'm perfectly fine
 

7619
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:02,070
those so by i'm perfectly fine
in the intermediate situation to have

7620
02:00:02,070 --> 02:00:02,080
in the intermediate situation to have
 

7621
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:03,910
in the intermediate situation to have
rules of thumb or you know principles

7622
02:00:03,910 --> 02:00:03,920
rules of thumb or you know principles
 

7623
02:00:03,920 --> 02:00:05,109
rules of thumb or you know principles
that chemists have found which are

7624
02:00:05,109 --> 02:00:05,119
that chemists have found which are
 

7625
02:00:05,119 --> 02:00:05,669
that chemists have found which are

quantum mechanical laws
 

7631
02:00:09,280 --> 02:00:11,030
quantum mechanical laws
which does their job similarly as

02:00:11,030 --> 02:00:11,040
which does their job similarly as
 

7633
02:00:11,040 --> 02:00:13,270
which does their job similarly as
biologists do not found everything in

7634
02:00:13,270 --> 02:00:13,280
biologists do not found everything in
 

7635
02:00:13,280 --> 02:00:14,790
biologists do not found everything in
terms of chemistry but they think you

7636
02:00:14,790 --> 02:00:14,800
terms of chemistry but they think you
 

7637
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:15,350
terms of chemistry but they think you
know

7638
02:00:15,350 --> 02:00:15,360
know
 

7639
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:16,709
know
there's no reason why chemistry cannot

7640

02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:49,830
a good i like this example quite a bit
um you know we distinguish between

7750
02:01:49,830 --> 02:01:49,840
um you know we distinguish between
 

7751
02:01:49,840 --> 02:01:51,750
um you know we distinguish between
liquid and a gas phase like water is

7752
02:01:51,750 --> 02:01:51,760
liquid and a gas phase like water is
 

7753
02:01:51,760 --> 02:01:52,709
liquid and a gas phase like water is
liquid or

7754
02:01:52,709 --> 02:01:52,719
liquid or
 

7755
02:01:52,719 --> 02:01:54,470
liquid or
or vapor is gas we say they're different

7756
02:01:54,470 --> 02:01:54,480
or vapor is gas we say they're different
 

7757
02:01:54,480 --> 02:01:56,070
or vapor is gas we say they're different
you can distinguish them actually that's

7758
02:01:56,070 --> 02:01:56,080
you can distinguish them actually that's
 

7759
02:01:56,080 --> 02:01:57,189
you can distinguish them actually that's
not true

7760
02:01:57,189 --> 02:01:57,199
not true
 

7761
02:01:57,199 --> 02:01:59,270
not true
it's not true because we know from

7762
02:01:59,270 --> 02:01:59,280
it's not true because we know from
 

7763
02:01:59,280 --> 02:02:00,550
it's not true because we know from
physics that you can

7764
02:02:00,550 --> 02:02:00,560
physics that you can
 

7765
02:02:00,560 --> 02:02:02,229
physics that you can
change temperatures and pressure to go

7766
02:02:02,229 --> 02:02:02,239
change temperatures and pressure to go
 

7767
02:02:02,239 --> 02:02:04,149
change temperatures and pressure to go
from liquid to the gas without making

7768
02:02:04,149 --> 02:02:04,159
from liquid to the gas without making
 

7769
02:02:04,159 --> 02:02:05,589
from liquid to the gas without making
any phase transition

7770
02:02:05,589 --> 02:02:05,599
any phase transition
 

7771
02:02:05,599 --> 02:02:07,350
any phase transition
so there is no point that you can say

7772
02:02:07,350 --> 02:02:07,360
so there is no point that you can say
 

7773
02:02:07,360 --> 02:02:09,990
so there is no point that you can say
this was a liquid and this was a gas

7774
02:02:09,990 --> 02:02:10,000
this was a liquid and this was a gas
 

7775
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:11,350
this was a liquid and this was a gas
you can continuously change the

7776
02:02:11,350 --> 02:02:11,360
you can continuously change the
 

7777
02:02:11,360 --> 02:02:13,750
you can continuously change the
parameters to go from one to the other

7778
02:02:13,750 --> 02:02:13,760
parameters to go from one to the other
 

7779
02:02:13,760 --> 02:02:15,430
parameters to go from one to the other
so at the end it's very different

7780
02:02:15,430 --> 02:02:15,440
so at the end it's very different
 

7781
02:02:15,440 --> 02:02:16,950
so at the end it's very different
looking like you know i know that water

7782
02:02:16,950 --> 02:02:16,960
looking like you know i know that water
 

7783
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:17,990
looking like you know i know that water
is different from vapor

7784
02:02:17,990 --> 02:02:18,000
is different from vapor
 

7785
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:19,830
is different from vapor
but you know there's no precise point

7786
02:02:19,830 --> 02:02:19,840
but you know there's no precise point
 

7787
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:21,109
but you know there's no precise point
this happens

7788
02:02:21,109 --> 02:02:21,119
this happens
 

7789
02:02:21,119 --> 02:02:23,030
this happens
i feel many of these things that we

7790
02:02:23,030 --> 02:02:23,040
i feel many of these things that we
 

7791
02:02:23,040 --> 02:02:25,189
i feel many of these things that we
think like consciousness clearly

7792
02:02:25,189 --> 02:02:25,199
think like consciousness clearly
 

7793
02:02:25,199 --> 02:02:26,709
think like consciousness clearly
that person is not conscious on the

7794
02:02:26,709 --> 02:02:26,719
that person is not conscious on the
 

7795
02:02:26,719 --> 02:02:27,990
that person is not conscious on the
other one is so there's a difference

7796
02:02:27,990 --> 02:02:28,000
other one is so there's a difference
 

7797
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:28,390
other one is so there's a difference
like

7798
02:02:28,390 --> 02:02:28,400
like
 

7799
02:02:28,400 --> 02:02:31,350
like
water and vapor but there's no point you

7800
02:02:31,350 --> 02:02:31,360
water and vapor but there's no point you
 

7801
02:02:31,360 --> 02:02:32,870
water and vapor but there's no point you
could say that this is conscious there's

7802
02:02:32,870 --> 02:02:32,880
could say that this is conscious there's
 

7803
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:33,270
could say that this is conscious there's
no

7804
02:02:33,270 --> 02:02:33,280
no
 

7805
02:02:33,280 --> 02:02:35,030
no
sharp transition so it could very well

7806
02:02:35,030 --> 02:02:35,040
sharp transition so it could very well
 

7807
02:02:35,040 --> 02:02:37,189
sharp transition so it could very well
be that what we call

7808
02:02:37,189 --> 02:02:37,199
be that what we call
 

7809
02:02:37,199 --> 02:02:39,669
be that what we call
uh heuristically in daily life

7810
02:02:39,669 --> 02:02:39,679
uh heuristically in daily life
 

7811
02:02:39,679 --> 02:02:41,589
uh heuristically in daily life
consciousness is similar or life is

7812
02:02:41,589 --> 02:02:41,599
consciousness is similar or life is
 

7813
02:02:41,599 --> 02:02:43,030
consciousness is similar or life is
similar to that

7814
02:02:43,030 --> 02:02:43,040
similar to that
 

7815
02:02:43,040 --> 02:02:44,390
similar to that
i don't know if it's like that or not

7816
02:02:44,390 --> 02:02:44,400
i don't know if it's like that or not
 

7817
02:02:44,400 --> 02:02:46,709
i don't know if it's like that or not
i'm just hypothesizing that's possible

7818
02:02:46,709 --> 02:02:46,719
i'm just hypothesizing that's possible
 

7819
02:02:46,719 --> 02:02:48,790
i'm just hypothesizing that's possible
like there's no there's no discrete

7820
02:02:48,790 --> 02:02:48,800
like there's no there's no discrete
 

7821
02:02:48,800 --> 02:02:49,830
like there's no there's no discrete
phases there's no

7822
02:02:49,830 --> 02:02:49,840
phases there's no
 

7823
02:02:49,840 --> 02:02:51,589
phases there's no
phase transition like that yeah yeah but

7824
02:02:51,589 --> 02:02:51,599
phase transition like that yeah yeah but
 

7825
02:02:51,599 --> 02:02:53,510
phase transition like that yeah yeah but
this you might

7826
02:02:53,510 --> 02:02:53,520
this you might
 

7827
02:02:53,520 --> 02:02:55,910
this you might
there might be you know concepts of

7828
02:02:55,910 --> 02:02:55,920
there might be you know concepts of
 

7829
02:02:55,920 --> 02:02:57,189
there might be you know concepts of
temperature and pressure

7830
02:02:57,189 --> 02:02:57,199
temperature and pressure
 

7831
02:02:57,199 --> 02:02:59,350
temperature and pressure
that we need to understand uh to

7832
02:02:59,350 --> 02:02:59,360
that we need to understand uh to
 

7833
02:02:59,360 --> 02:03:01,430
that we need to understand uh to
describe what the heck consciousness in

7834
02:03:01,430 --> 02:03:01,440
describe what the heck consciousness in
 

7835
02:03:01,440 --> 02:03:02,629
describe what the heck consciousness in
life is

7836
02:03:02,629 --> 02:03:02,639
life is
 

7837
02:03:02,639 --> 02:03:04,870
life is
that that we're totally missing yeah i

7838
02:03:04,870 --> 02:03:04,880
that that we're totally missing yeah i
 

7839
02:03:04,880 --> 02:03:05,750
that that we're totally missing yeah i
think that's not

7840
02:03:05,750 --> 02:03:05,760
think that's not
 

7841
02:03:05,760 --> 02:03:08,870
think that's not
a useless question even those questions

7842
02:03:08,870 --> 02:03:08,880
a useless question even those questions
 

7843
02:03:08,880 --> 02:03:10,629
a useless question even those questions
is back to our original discussion of

7844
02:03:10,629 --> 02:03:10,639
is back to our original discussion of
 

7845
02:03:10,639 --> 02:03:13,109
is back to our original discussion of
philosophy i would say consciousness

7846
02:03:13,109 --> 02:03:13,119
philosophy i would say consciousness
 

7847
02:03:13,119 --> 02:03:16,070
philosophy i would say consciousness
and free will for example are topics

7848
02:03:16,070 --> 02:03:16,080
and free will for example are topics
 

7849
02:03:16,080 --> 02:03:16,870
and free will for example are topics
that

7850
02:03:16,870 --> 02:03:16,880
that
 

7851
02:03:16,880 --> 02:03:19,589
that
are very much so in the realm of

7852
02:03:19,589 --> 02:03:19,599
are very much so in the realm of
 

7853
02:03:19,599 --> 02:03:21,350
are very much so in the realm of
philosophy currently yes but i don't

7854
02:03:21,350 --> 02:03:21,360
philosophy currently yes but i don't
 

7855
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:22,790
philosophy currently yes but i don't
think they will always be

7856
02:03:22,790 --> 02:03:22,800
think they will always be
 

7857
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:24,629
think they will always be
i agree with you i agree with you and i

7858
02:03:24,629 --> 02:03:24,639
i agree with you i agree with you and i
 

7859
02:03:24,639 --> 02:03:26,950
i agree with you i agree with you and i
think i am i'm fine with some topics

7860
02:03:26,950 --> 02:03:26,960
think i am i'm fine with some topics
 

7861
02:03:26,960 --> 02:03:28,390
think i am i'm fine with some topics
being part of a different realm than

7862
02:03:28,390 --> 02:03:28,400
being part of a different realm than
 

7863
02:03:28,400 --> 02:03:29,669
being part of a different realm than
physics today

7864
02:03:29,669 --> 02:03:29,679
physics today
 

7865
02:03:29,679 --> 02:03:32,070
physics today
because we don't have the right tools

7866
02:03:32,070 --> 02:03:32,080
because we don't have the right tools
 

7867
02:03:32,080 --> 02:03:33,990
because we don't have the right tools
just like biology was i mean before we

7868
02:03:33,990 --> 02:03:34,000
just like biology was i mean before we
 

7869
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:35,669
just like biology was i mean before we
had dna and all that genetics and all

7870
02:03:35,669 --> 02:03:35,679
had dna and all that genetics and all
 

7871
02:03:35,679 --> 02:03:36,950
had dna and all that genetics and all
that gradually began to

7872
02:03:36,950 --> 02:03:36,960
that gradually began to
 

7873
02:03:36,960 --> 02:03:39,830
that gradually began to
take hold i mean when mandela when

7874
02:03:39,830 --> 02:03:39,840
take hold i mean when mandela when
 

7875
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:40,790
take hold i mean when mandela when
people were beginning

7876
02:03:40,790 --> 02:03:40,800
people were beginning
 

7877
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:43,189
people were beginning
with face experiments with biology and

7878
02:03:43,189 --> 02:03:43,199
with face experiments with biology and
 

7879
02:03:43,199 --> 02:03:44,790
with face experiments with biology and
chemistry and so on they gradually they

7880
02:03:44,790 --> 02:03:44,800
chemistry and so on they gradually they
 

7881
02:03:44,800 --> 02:03:45,830
chemistry and so on they gradually they
came together

7882
02:03:45,830 --> 02:03:45,840
came together
 

7883
02:03:45,840 --> 02:03:47,910
came together
so it wasn't like together so yeah i'll

7884
02:03:47,910 --> 02:03:47,920
so it wasn't like together so yeah i'll
 

7885
02:03:47,920 --> 02:03:49,350
so it wasn't like together so yeah i'll
be perfectly understanding of a

7886
02:03:49,350 --> 02:03:49,360
be perfectly understanding of a
 

7887
02:03:49,360 --> 02:03:51,430
be perfectly understanding of a
situation where we don't have the tools

7888
02:03:51,430 --> 02:03:51,440
situation where we don't have the tools
 

7889
02:03:51,440 --> 02:03:53,189
situation where we don't have the tools
so do these experiments that you think

7890
02:03:53,189 --> 02:03:53,199
so do these experiments that you think
 

7891
02:03:53,199 --> 02:03:54,550
so do these experiments that you think
has defines the consciousness in

7892
02:03:54,550 --> 02:03:54,560
has defines the consciousness in
 

7893
02:03:54,560 --> 02:03:55,830
has defines the consciousness in
different form and gradually we will

7894
02:03:55,830 --> 02:03:55,840
different form and gradually we will
 

7895
02:03:55,840 --> 02:03:57,109
different form and gradually we will
build it and connect it

7896
02:03:57,109 --> 02:03:57,119
build it and connect it
 

7897
02:03:57,119 --> 02:03:59,030
build it and connect it
and yes we might discover new principles

7898
02:03:59,030 --> 02:03:59,040
and yes we might discover new principles
 

7899
02:03:59,040 --> 02:04:00,950
and yes we might discover new principles
of nature that we didn't know

7900
02:04:00,950 --> 02:04:00,960
of nature that we didn't know
 

7901
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:02,390
of nature that we didn't know
i don't know but i would say that if

7902
02:04:02,390 --> 02:04:02,400
i don't know but i would say that if
 

7903
02:04:02,400 --> 02:04:04,149
i don't know but i would say that if
they are they will be deeply connected

7904
02:04:04,149 --> 02:04:04,159
they are they will be deeply connected
 

7905
02:04:04,159 --> 02:04:05,030
they are they will be deeply connected
with yes we

7906
02:04:05,030 --> 02:04:05,040
with yes we
 

7907
02:04:05,040 --> 02:04:06,950
with yes we
we have never we have seen in physics we

7908
02:04:06,950 --> 02:04:06,960
we have never we have seen in physics we
 

7909
02:04:06,960 --> 02:04:08,229
we have never we have seen in physics we
don't have things in isolation you

7910
02:04:08,229 --> 02:04:08,239
don't have things in isolation you
 

7911
02:04:08,239 --> 02:04:08,950
don't have things in isolation you
cannot

7912
02:04:08,950 --> 02:04:08,960
cannot
 

7913
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:10,709
cannot
you cannot compartmentalize you know

7914
02:04:10,709 --> 02:04:10,719
you cannot compartmentalize you know
 

7915
02:04:10,719 --> 02:04:12,629
you cannot compartmentalize you know
this is gravity this is electricity this

7916
02:04:12,629 --> 02:04:12,639
this is gravity this is electricity this
 

7917
02:04:12,639 --> 02:04:13,109
this is gravity this is electricity this
is that

7918
02:04:13,109 --> 02:04:13,119
is that
 

7919
02:04:13,119 --> 02:04:14,550
is that
we have learned they all talk to each

7920
02:04:14,550 --> 02:04:14,560
we have learned they all talk to each
 

7921
02:04:14,560 --> 02:04:16,550
we have learned they all talk to each
other there's no way to

7922
02:04:16,550 --> 02:04:16,560
other there's no way to
 

7923
02:04:16,560 --> 02:04:18,390
other there's no way to
to make them you know in one corner and

7924
02:04:18,390 --> 02:04:18,400
to make them you know in one corner and
 

7925
02:04:18,400 --> 02:04:19,910
to make them you know in one corner and
don't talk so same thing with

7926
02:04:19,910 --> 02:04:19,920
don't talk so same thing with
 

7927
02:04:19,920 --> 02:04:21,350
don't talk so same thing with
anything anything which is real so

7928
02:04:21,350 --> 02:04:21,360
anything anything which is real so
 

7929
02:04:21,360 --> 02:04:23,109
anything anything which is real so
consciousness is real so therefore

7930
02:04:23,109 --> 02:04:23,119
consciousness is real so therefore
 

7931
02:04:23,119 --> 02:04:25,109
consciousness is real so therefore
we have to connect it to everything else

7932
02:04:25,109 --> 02:04:25,119
we have to connect it to everything else
 

7933
02:04:25,119 --> 02:04:26,870
we have to connect it to everything else
so to me once you connect it you cannot

7934
02:04:26,870 --> 02:04:26,880
so to me once you connect it you cannot
 

7935
02:04:26,880 --> 02:04:28,229
so to me once you connect it you cannot
say it's not reality and once this

7936
02:04:28,229 --> 02:04:28,239
say it's not reality and once this
 

7937
02:04:28,239 --> 02:04:29,830
say it's not reality and once this
reality is physics

7938
02:04:29,830 --> 02:04:29,840
reality is physics
 

7939
02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:31,189
reality is physics
i call it physics it may not be the

7940
02:04:31,189 --> 02:04:31,199
i call it physics it may not be the
 

7941
02:04:31,199 --> 02:04:32,870
i call it physics it may not be the
physics i know today for sure it's not

7942
02:04:32,870 --> 02:04:32,880
physics i know today for sure it's not
 

7943
02:04:32,880 --> 02:04:33,589
physics i know today for sure it's not
but

7944
02:04:33,589 --> 02:04:33,599
but
 

7945
02:04:33,599 --> 02:04:35,109
but
but i wouldn't i would i would be

7946
02:04:35,109 --> 02:04:35,119
but i wouldn't i would i would be
 

7947
02:04:35,119 --> 02:04:36,629
but i wouldn't i would i would be
surprised if there's disconnected

7948
02:04:36,629 --> 02:04:36,639
surprised if there's disconnected
 

7949
02:04:36,639 --> 02:04:38,470
surprised if there's disconnected
realities that you know you cannot

7950
02:04:38,470 --> 02:04:38,480
realities that you know you cannot
 

7951
02:04:38,480 --> 02:04:40,229
realities that you know you cannot
you cannot imagine them as a part of the

7952
02:04:40,229 --> 02:04:40,239
you cannot imagine them as a part of the
 

7953
02:04:40,239 --> 02:04:42,310
you cannot imagine them as a part of the
same soup so i guess uh

7954
02:04:42,310 --> 02:04:42,320
same soup so i guess uh
 

7955
02:04:42,320 --> 02:04:44,550
same soup so i guess uh
god doesn't have a biology or chemistry

7956
02:04:44,550 --> 02:04:44,560
god doesn't have a biology or chemistry
 

7957
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:45,830
god doesn't have a biology or chemistry
textbook and mostly

7958
02:04:45,830 --> 02:04:45,840
textbook and mostly
 

7959
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:49,350
textbook and mostly
or maybe uh he or she reads it for fun

7960
02:04:49,350 --> 02:04:49,360
or maybe uh he or she reads it for fun
 

7961
02:04:49,360 --> 02:04:50,950
or maybe uh he or she reads it for fun
biology and chemistry but when you're

7962
02:04:50,950 --> 02:04:50,960
biology and chemistry but when you're
 

7963
02:04:50,960 --> 02:04:52,390
biology and chemistry but when you're
trying to get some work done it'll be

7964
02:04:52,390 --> 02:04:52,400
trying to get some work done it'll be
 

7965
02:04:52,400 --> 02:04:54,470
trying to get some work done it'll be
going to the physics textbook

7966
02:04:54,470 --> 02:04:54,480
going to the physics textbook
 

7967
02:04:54,480 --> 02:04:58,470
going to the physics textbook
okay uh what advice let's put on your

7968
02:04:58,470 --> 02:04:58,480
okay uh what advice let's put on your
 

7969
02:04:58,480 --> 02:05:01,589
okay uh what advice let's put on your
wise visionary hat what advice do you

7970
02:05:01,589 --> 02:05:01,599
wise visionary hat what advice do you
 

7971
02:05:01,599 --> 02:05:02,310
wise visionary hat what advice do you
have

7972
02:05:02,310 --> 02:05:02,320
have
 

7973
02:05:02,320 --> 02:05:04,950
have
for young people today you've um are

7974
02:05:04,950 --> 02:05:04,960
for young people today you've um are
 

7975
02:05:04,960 --> 02:05:05,990
for young people today you've um are
you've dedicated your

7976
02:05:05,990 --> 02:05:06,000
you've dedicated your
 

7977
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,629
you've dedicated your
book actually to your kids to your

7978
02:05:08,629 --> 02:05:08,639
book actually to your kids to your
 

7979

book actually to your kids to your
family

7980
02:05:09,589 --> 02:05:09,599
family
 

7981
02:05:09,599 --> 02:05:11,589
family
what advice would you give to them what

7982
02:05:11,589 --> 02:05:11,599
what advice would you give to them what
 

7983
02:05:11,599 --> 02:05:13,430
what advice would you give to them what
advice would you give to young people

7984
02:05:13,430 --> 02:05:13,440
advice would you give to young people
 

7985
02:05:13,440 --> 02:05:15,189
advice would you give to young people
today thinking about their career

7986
02:05:15,189 --> 02:05:15,199
today thinking about their career
 

7987
02:05:15,199 --> 02:05:16,629
today thinking about their career
thinking about life

7988
02:05:16,629 --> 02:05:16,639
thinking about life
 

7989
02:05:16,639 --> 02:05:18,629
thinking about life
of how to live a successful life how to

7990
02:05:18,629 --> 02:05:18,639
of how to live a successful life how to
 

7991
02:05:18,639 --> 02:05:19,750
of how to live a successful life how to
live a good life

7992
02:05:19,750 --> 02:05:19,760
live a good life
 

7993
02:05:19,760 --> 02:05:23,669
live a good life
yes uh yes i have three sons and in fact

7994
02:05:23,669 --> 02:05:23,679
yes uh yes i have three sons and in fact
 

7995
02:05:23,679 --> 02:05:26,629
yes uh yes i have three sons and in fact
to them i have uh i have tried not to

7996
02:05:26,629 --> 02:05:26,639
to them i have uh i have tried not to
 

7997
02:05:26,639 --> 02:05:28,229
to them i have uh i have tried not to
give too much advice

7998
02:05:28,229 --> 02:05:28,239
give too much advice
 

7999
02:05:28,239 --> 02:05:30,709
give too much advice
so even though i've tried to kind of not

8000
02:05:30,709 --> 02:05:30,719
so even though i've tried to kind of not
 

8001
02:05:30,719 --> 02:05:31,830
so even though i've tried to kind of not
give advice maybe

8002
02:05:31,830 --> 02:05:31,840
give advice maybe
 

8003
02:05:31,840 --> 02:05:33,910
give advice maybe
indirectly it has been some impact my

8004
02:05:33,910 --> 02:05:33,920
indirectly it has been some impact my
 

8005
02:05:33,920 --> 02:05:35,510
indirectly it has been some impact my
oldest one is doing biophysics for

8006
02:05:35,510 --> 02:05:35,520
oldest one is doing biophysics for
 

8007
02:05:35,520 --> 02:05:36,709
oldest one is doing biophysics for
example and the

8008
02:05:36,709 --> 02:05:36,719
example and the
 

8009
02:05:36,719 --> 02:05:38,149
example and the
the second one is doing machine learning

8010
02:05:38,149 --> 02:05:38,159
the second one is doing machine learning
 

8011
02:05:38,159 --> 02:05:39,910
the second one is doing machine learning
and the third one is doing theoretical

8012
02:05:39,910 --> 02:05:39,920
and the third one is doing theoretical
 

8013
02:05:39,920 --> 02:05:41,189
and the third one is doing theoretical
computer science so there are

8014
02:05:41,189 --> 02:05:41,199
computer science so there are
 

8015
02:05:41,199 --> 02:05:42,870
computer science so there are
there are these facets of interest which

8016
02:05:42,870 --> 02:05:42,880
there are these facets of interest which
 

8017
02:05:42,880 --> 02:05:45,030
there are these facets of interest which
are not too far from my area but i have

8018
02:05:45,030 --> 02:05:45,040
are not too far from my area but i have
 

8019
02:05:45,040 --> 02:05:46,149
are not too far from my area but i have
not tried to

8020
02:05:46,149 --> 02:05:46,159
not tried to
 

8021
02:05:46,159 --> 02:05:48,390
not tried to
to impact them in in that way but and

8022
02:05:48,390 --> 02:05:48,400
to impact them in in that way but and
 

8023
02:05:48,400 --> 02:05:49,910
to impact them in in that way but and
they have followed their own interests

8024
02:05:49,910 --> 02:05:49,920
they have followed their own interests
 

8025
02:05:49,920 --> 02:05:50,550
they have followed their own interests
and i think

8026
02:05:50,550 --> 02:05:50,560
and i think
 

8027
02:05:50,560 --> 02:05:52,310
and i think
that's the advice i would give to any

8028
02:05:52,310 --> 02:05:52,320
that's the advice i would give to any
 

8029
02:05:52,320 --> 02:05:54,870
that's the advice i would give to any
young person follow your own interest

8030
02:05:54,870 --> 02:05:54,880
young person follow your own interest
 

8031
02:05:54,880 --> 02:05:56,470
young person follow your own interest
and let it that take you wherever it

8032
02:05:56,470 --> 02:05:56,480
and let it that take you wherever it
 

8033
02:05:56,480 --> 02:05:58,470
and let it that take you wherever it
takes you um

8034
02:05:58,470 --> 02:05:58,480
takes you um
 

8035
02:05:58,480 --> 02:06:02,229
takes you um
and this i did in my own case that

8036
02:06:02,229 --> 02:06:02,239
and this i did in my own case that
 

8037
02:06:02,239 --> 02:06:04,629
and this i did in my own case that
uh i was planning to study economics and

8038
02:06:04,629 --> 02:06:04,639
uh i was planning to study economics and
 

8039
02:06:04,639 --> 02:06:06,069
uh i was planning to study economics and
electrical engineering

8040
02:06:06,069 --> 02:06:06,079
electrical engineering
 

8041
02:06:06,079 --> 02:06:08,790
electrical engineering
when i started at mit and you know i

8042
02:06:08,790 --> 02:06:08,800
when i started at mit and you know i
 

8043
02:06:08,800 --> 02:06:09,750
when i started at mit and you know i
discovered that

8044
02:06:09,750 --> 02:06:09,760
discovered that
 

8045
02:06:09,760 --> 02:06:11,109
discovered that
i'm more passionate about math and

8046
02:06:11,109 --> 02:06:11,119
i'm more passionate about math and
 

8047
02:06:11,119 --> 02:06:13,350
i'm more passionate about math and
physics and at that time i didn't think

8048
02:06:13,350 --> 02:06:13,360
physics and at that time i didn't think
 

8049
02:06:13,360 --> 02:06:14,830
physics and at that time i didn't think
math and physics would make a good

8050
02:06:14,830 --> 02:06:14,840
math and physics would make a good
 

8051
02:06:14,840 --> 02:06:16,550
math and physics would make a good
career and so i

8052
02:06:16,550 --> 02:06:16,560
career and so i
 

8053
02:06:16,560 --> 02:06:18,069
career and so i
was kind of hesitant to go in that

8054
02:06:18,069 --> 02:06:18,079
was kind of hesitant to go in that
 

8055
02:06:18,079 --> 02:06:20,069
was kind of hesitant to go in that
direction but i did because i kind of

8056
02:06:20,069 --> 02:06:20,079
direction but i did because i kind of
 

8057
02:06:20,079 --> 02:06:22,550
direction but i did because i kind of
felt that that's what i'm driven to do

8058
02:06:22,550 --> 02:06:22,560
felt that that's what i'm driven to do
 

8059
02:06:22,560 --> 02:06:25,350
felt that that's what i'm driven to do
so i didn't i don't regret it i'm i'm

8060
02:06:25,350 --> 02:06:25,360
so i didn't i don't regret it i'm i'm
 

8061
02:06:25,360 --> 02:06:27,109
so i didn't i don't regret it i'm i'm
lucky in the sense that you know society

8062
02:06:27,109 --> 02:06:27,119
lucky in the sense that you know society
 

8063
02:06:27,119 --> 02:06:28,629
lucky in the sense that you know society
supports people like me who are doing

8064
02:06:28,629 --> 02:06:28,639
supports people like me who are doing
 

8065
02:06:28,639 --> 02:06:30,390
supports people like me who are doing
you know these abstract stuff which

8066
02:06:30,390 --> 02:06:30,400
you know these abstract stuff which
 

8067
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:31,990
you know these abstract stuff which
which may or may not be experimentally

8068
02:06:31,990 --> 02:06:32,000
which may or may not be experimentally
 

8069
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:33,910
which may or may not be experimentally
verified even let's not apply to the

8070
02:06:33,910 --> 02:06:33,920
verified even let's not apply to the
 

8071
02:06:33,920 --> 02:06:36,550
verified even let's not apply to the
data technology in our lifetimes i'm

8072
02:06:36,550 --> 02:06:36,560
data technology in our lifetimes i'm
 

8073
02:06:36,560 --> 02:06:37,589
data technology in our lifetimes i'm
lucky i'm doing that

8074
02:06:37,589 --> 02:06:37,599
lucky i'm doing that
 

8075
02:06:37,599 --> 02:06:40,629
lucky i'm doing that
and i feel that uh if people follow

8076
02:06:40,629 --> 02:06:40,639
and i feel that uh if people follow
 

8077
02:06:40,639 --> 02:06:42,229
and i feel that uh if people follow
their interest they will find a niche

8078
02:06:42,229 --> 02:06:42,239
their interest they will find a niche
 

8079
02:06:42,239 --> 02:06:44,629
their interest they will find a niche
that they're good at and

8080
02:06:44,629 --> 02:06:44,639
that they're good at and
 

8081
02:06:44,639 --> 02:06:47,510
that they're good at and
this coincidence of hopefully their

8082
02:06:47,510 --> 02:06:47,520
this coincidence of hopefully their
 

8083
02:06:47,520 --> 02:06:48,550
this coincidence of hopefully their
interests and

8084
02:06:48,550 --> 02:06:48,560
interests and
 

8085
02:06:48,560 --> 02:06:51,990
interests and
and abilities are kind of align

8086
02:06:51,990 --> 02:06:52,000
and abilities are kind of align
 

8087
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:53,910
and abilities are kind of align
at least to some extent to be able to

8088
02:06:53,910 --> 02:06:53,920
at least to some extent to be able to
 

8089
02:06:53,920 --> 02:06:55,109
at least to some extent to be able to
drive them to something which is

8090
02:06:55,109 --> 02:06:55,119
drive them to something which is
 

8091
02:06:55,119 --> 02:06:56,149
drive them to something which is
successful

8092
02:06:56,149 --> 02:06:56,159
successful
 

8093
02:06:56,159 --> 02:06:58,229
successful
and not to be driven by things like you

8094
02:06:58,229 --> 02:06:58,239
and not to be driven by things like you
 

8095
02:06:58,239 --> 02:06:59,990
and not to be driven by things like you
know this doesn't make a good career or

8096
02:06:59,990 --> 02:07:00,000
know this doesn't make a good career or
 

8097
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:01,589
know this doesn't make a good career or
this doesn't do that and my parents

8098
02:07:01,589 --> 02:07:01,599
this doesn't do that and my parents
 

8099
02:07:01,599 --> 02:07:03,669
this doesn't do that and my parents
expect that or what about this and

8100
02:07:03,669 --> 02:07:03,679
expect that or what about this and
 

8101
02:07:03,679 --> 02:07:05,589
expect that or what about this and
i think ultimately you have to live with

8102
02:07:05,589 --> 02:07:05,599
i think ultimately you have to live with
 

8103
02:07:05,599 --> 02:07:07,430
i think ultimately you have to live with
yourself and you only have one life and

8104
02:07:07,430 --> 02:07:07,440
yourself and you only have one life and
 

8105
02:07:07,440 --> 02:07:08,069
yourself and you only have one life and
it's short

8106
02:07:08,069 --> 02:07:08,079
it's short
 

8107
02:07:08,079 --> 02:07:09,510
it's short
very short i can tell you i'm getting

8108
02:07:09,510 --> 02:07:09,520
very short i can tell you i'm getting
 

8109
02:07:09,520 --> 02:07:11,109
very short i can tell you i'm getting
yes i'm getting there so i know it's

8110
02:07:11,109 --> 02:07:11,119
yes i'm getting there so i know it's
 

8111
02:07:11,119 --> 02:07:12,629
yes i'm getting there so i know it's
short so you really

8112
02:07:12,629 --> 02:07:12,639
short so you really
 

8113
02:07:12,639 --> 02:07:14,950
short so you really
want not to not to not to do things that

8114
02:07:14,950 --> 02:07:14,960
want not to not to not to do things that
 

8115
02:07:14,960 --> 02:07:16,470
want not to not to not to do things that
you don't want to do so i think

8116
02:07:16,470 --> 02:07:16,480
you don't want to do so i think
 

8117
02:07:16,480 --> 02:07:18,149
you don't want to do so i think
follow your interest my strongest advice

8118
02:07:18,149 --> 02:07:18,159
follow your interest my strongest advice
 

8119
02:07:18,159 --> 02:07:20,069
follow your interest my strongest advice
to young people yeah it's scary

8121
02:07:20,079 --> 02:07:23,669
to young people yeah it's scary
when your interest doesn't directly map

8122
02:07:23,669 --> 02:07:23,679
when your interest doesn't directly map
 

8123
02:07:23,679 --> 02:07:26,470
when your interest doesn't directly map
to a career of the past or of today

8124
02:07:26,470 --> 02:07:26,480
to a career of the past or of today
 

8125
02:07:26,480 --> 02:07:28,229
to a career of the past or of today
so you're almost anticipating future

8126
02:07:28,229 --> 02:07:28,239
so you're almost anticipating future
 

8127
02:07:28,239 --> 02:07:29,510
so you're almost anticipating future
careers that could be created

8128
02:07:29,510 --> 02:07:29,520
careers that could be created
 

8129
02:07:29,520 --> 02:07:32,950
careers that could be created
is scary um but

8130
02:07:32,950 --> 02:07:32,960
is scary um but
 

8131
02:07:32,960 --> 02:07:34,069
is scary um but
yeah there's something to that

8132
02:07:34,069 --> 02:07:34,079
yeah there's something to that
 

8133
02:07:34,079 --> 02:07:35,350
yeah there's something to that
especially when the interest and the

8134
02:07:35,350 --> 02:07:35,360
especially when the interest and the
 

8135
02:07:35,360 --> 02:07:36,790
especially when the interest and the
ability align

8136
02:07:36,790 --> 02:07:36,800
ability align
 

8137
02:07:36,800 --> 02:07:39,830
ability align
you'll pay you'll pave a path that will

8138
02:07:39,830 --> 02:07:39,840
you'll pay you'll pave a path that will
 

8139
02:07:39,840 --> 02:07:41,109
you'll pay you'll pave a path that will
find a way to make money

8140
02:07:41,109 --> 02:07:41,119
find a way to make money
 

8141
02:07:41,119 --> 02:07:44,069
find a way to make money
especially in this society in the in in

8142
02:07:44,069 --> 02:07:44,079
especially in this society in the in in
 

8143
02:07:44,079 --> 02:07:46,149
especially in this society in the in in
the capitalistic united states society

8144
02:07:46,149 --> 02:07:46,159
the capitalistic united states society
 

8145
02:07:46,159 --> 02:07:48,310
the capitalistic united states society
it feels like

8146
02:07:48,310 --> 02:07:48,320
it feels like
 

8147
02:07:48,320 --> 02:07:52,830
it feels like
um ability and passion paves the way

yes you've mentioned uh life is short
 

8155
02:08:00,800 --> 02:08:03,990
yes you've mentioned uh life is short
do you think about um your mortality

8156
02:08:03,990 --> 02:08:04,000
do you think about um your mortality
 

8157
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,310
do you think about um your mortality
are you afraid of death uh i don't think

8158
02:08:06,310 --> 02:08:06,320
are you afraid of death uh i don't think
 

8159
02:08:06,320 --> 02:08:09,750
are you afraid of death uh i don't think
about my mortality

8160
02:08:09,750 --> 02:08:09,760
about my mortality
 

8161
02:08:09,760 --> 02:08:12,310
about my mortality
i think that i don't think about my debt

8162
02:08:12,310 --> 02:08:12,320
i think that i don't think about my debt
 

8163
02:08:12,320 --> 02:08:13,669
i think that i don't think about my debt
and i don't think about death in general

8164
02:08:13,669 --> 02:08:13,679
and i don't think about death in general
 

8165
02:08:13,679 --> 02:08:14,550
and i don't think about death in general
too much

8166
02:08:14,550 --> 02:08:14,560
too much
 

8167
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:15,669
too much
first of all it's something that i can't

8168
02:08:15,669 --> 02:08:15,679
first of all it's something that i can't
 

8169
02:08:15,679 --> 02:08:17,750
first of all it's something that i can't
too much about and i think it's

8170
02:08:17,750 --> 02:08:17,760
too much about and i think it's
 

8171
02:08:17,760 --> 02:08:18,470
too much about and i think it's
something that

8172
02:08:18,470 --> 02:08:18,480
something that
 

8173
02:08:18,480 --> 02:08:20,709
something that
doesn't it doesn't drive my everyday

8174
02:08:20,709 --> 02:08:20,719
doesn't it doesn't drive my everyday
 

8175
02:08:20,719 --> 02:08:21,510
doesn't it doesn't drive my everyday
action

8176
02:08:21,510 --> 02:08:21,520
action
 

8177
02:08:21,520 --> 02:08:23,589
action
it is natural to expect that it's

8178
02:08:23,589 --> 02:08:23,599
it is natural to expect that it's
 

8179
02:08:23,599 --> 02:08:24,550
it is natural to expect that it's
somewhat like the

8180
02:08:24,550 --> 02:08:24,560
somewhat like the
 

8181
02:08:24,560 --> 02:08:26,310
somewhat like the
time reversal situation so we believe

8182
02:08:26,310 --> 02:08:26,320
time reversal situation so we believe
 

8183
02:08:26,320 --> 02:08:27,830
time reversal situation so we believe
that we have this approximate symmetry

8184
02:08:27,830 --> 02:08:27,840
that we have this approximate symmetry
 

8185
02:08:27,840 --> 02:08:29,350
that we have this approximate symmetry
in nature time reversal

8186
02:08:29,350 --> 02:08:29,360
in nature time reversal
 

8187
02:08:29,360 --> 02:08:31,189
in nature time reversal
going forward we die going backwards we

8188
02:08:31,189 --> 02:08:31,199
going forward we die going backwards we
 

8189
02:08:31,199 --> 02:08:33,270
going forward we die going backwards we
get born yeah so

8190
02:08:33,270 --> 02:08:33,280
get born yeah so
 

8191
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:36,470
get born yeah so
what was it to get born it wasn't such a

8192
02:08:36,470 --> 02:08:36,480
what was it to get born it wasn't such a
 

8193
02:08:36,480 --> 02:08:38,069
what was it to get born it wasn't such a
good or bad feeling i have no feeling of

8194
02:08:38,069 --> 02:08:38,079
good or bad feeling i have no feeling of
 

8195
02:08:38,079 --> 02:08:39,589
good or bad feeling i have no feeling of
it so

8196
02:08:39,589 --> 02:08:39,599
it so
 

8197
02:08:39,599 --> 02:08:41,030
it so
you know who knows what the death will

8198
02:08:41,030 --> 02:08:41,040
you know who knows what the death will
 

8199
02:08:41,040 --> 02:08:42,950
you know who knows what the death will
feel like uh the moment of death or

8200
02:08:42,950 --> 02:08:42,960
feel like uh the moment of death or
 

8201
02:08:42,960 --> 02:08:44,470
feel like uh the moment of death or
whatnot so i don't know

8202
02:08:44,470 --> 02:08:44,480
whatnot so i don't know
 

8203
02:08:44,480 --> 02:08:47,430
whatnot so i don't know
it is not known but uh in what form do

8204
02:08:47,430 --> 02:08:47,440
it is not known but uh in what form do
 

8205
02:08:47,440 --> 02:08:50,069
it is not known but uh in what form do
we exist before or after

8206
02:08:50,069 --> 02:08:50,079
we exist before or after
 

8207
02:08:50,079 --> 02:08:52,069
we exist before or after
again it's something that it's uh it's

8208
02:08:52,069 --> 02:08:52,079
again it's something that it's uh it's
 

8209
02:08:52,079 --> 02:08:53,589
again it's something that it's uh it's
partly philosophical maybe

8210
02:08:53,589 --> 02:08:53,599
partly philosophical maybe
 

8211
02:08:53,599 --> 02:08:55,109
partly philosophical maybe
i like how you draw comfort from

8212
02:08:55,109 --> 02:08:55,119
i like how you draw comfort from
 

8213
02:08:55,119 --> 02:08:57,109
i like how you draw comfort from
symmetry it does seem that there is

8214
02:08:57,109 --> 02:08:57,119
symmetry it does seem that there is
 

8215
02:08:57,119 --> 02:08:58,629
symmetry it does seem that there is
something asymmetric here

8216
02:08:58,629 --> 02:08:58,639
something asymmetric here
 

8217
02:08:58,639 --> 02:09:01,510
something asymmetric here
breaking of symmetry because there's

8218
02:09:01,510 --> 02:09:01,520
breaking of symmetry because there's
 

8219
02:09:01,520 --> 02:09:03,270
breaking of symmetry because there's
there's something

8220
02:09:03,270 --> 02:09:03,280
there's something
 

8221
02:09:03,280 --> 02:09:06,790
there's something
to the uh creative force of the human

8222
02:09:06,790 --> 02:09:06,800
to the uh creative force of the human
 

8223
02:09:06,800 --> 02:09:07,830
to the uh creative force of the human
spirit

8224
02:09:07,830 --> 02:09:07,840
spirit
 

8225
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:10,950
spirit
that goes only one way right that

8226
02:09:10,950 --> 02:09:10,960
that goes only one way right that
 

8227
02:09:10,960 --> 02:09:13,350
that goes only one way right that
it seems the finiteness of life is the

8228
02:09:13,350 --> 02:09:13,360
it seems the finiteness of life is the
 

8229
02:09:13,360 --> 02:09:15,830
it seems the finiteness of life is the
thing that drives the creativity

8230
02:09:15,830 --> 02:09:15,840
thing that drives the creativity
 

8231
02:09:15,840 --> 02:09:18,870
thing that drives the creativity
and so it does seem that that um at

8232
02:09:18,870 --> 02:09:18,880
and so it does seem that that um at
 

8233
02:09:18,880 --> 02:09:19,270
and so it does seem that that um at
least

8234
02:09:19,270 --> 02:09:19,280
least
 

8235
02:09:19,280 --> 02:09:22,629
least
the contemplation of of the finiteness

8236
02:09:22,629 --> 02:09:22,639
the contemplation of of the finiteness
 

8237
02:09:22,639 --> 02:09:24,470
the contemplation of of the finiteness
of life of mortality

8238
02:09:24,470 --> 02:09:24,480
of life of mortality
 

8239
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:26,550
of life of mortality
is a thing that helps you get your stuff

8240
02:09:26,550 --> 02:09:26,560
is a thing that helps you get your stuff
 

8241
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:28,229
is a thing that helps you get your stuff
together yes i think that's true but

8242
02:09:28,229 --> 02:09:28,239
together yes i think that's true but
 

8243
02:09:28,239 --> 02:09:29,430
together yes i think that's true but
actually i have a different perspective

8244
02:09:29,430 --> 02:09:29,440
actually i have a different perspective
 

8245
02:09:29,440 --> 02:09:30,830
actually i have a different perspective
on that a little bit yes

8246
02:09:30,830 --> 02:09:30,840
on that a little bit yes
 

8247
02:09:30,840 --> 02:09:33,589
on that a little bit yes
namely uh suppose i told you you have

8248
02:09:33,589 --> 02:09:33,599
namely uh suppose i told you you have
 

8249
02:09:33,599 --> 02:09:34,709
namely uh suppose i told you you have
you're immortal

8250
02:09:34,709 --> 02:09:34,719
you're immortal
 

8251
02:09:34,719 --> 02:09:38,229
you're immortal
yes i think your life will be totally

8252
02:09:38,229 --> 02:09:38,239
yes i think your life will be totally
 

8253
02:09:38,239 --> 02:09:39,750
yes i think your life will be totally
boring after that

8254
02:09:39,750 --> 02:09:39,760
boring after that
 

8255
02:09:39,760 --> 02:09:42,870
boring after that
because you will not there's i think

8256
02:09:42,870 --> 02:09:42,880
because you will not there's i think
 

8257
02:09:42,880 --> 02:09:45,189
because you will not there's i think
part of the reason we have enjoyment in

8258
02:09:45,189 --> 02:09:45,199
part of the reason we have enjoyment in
 

8259
02:09:45,199 --> 02:09:47,189
part of the reason we have enjoyment in
life is the finiteness of it

8260
02:09:47,189 --> 02:09:47,199
life is the finiteness of it
 

8261
02:09:47,199 --> 02:09:50,470
life is the finiteness of it
yes and so i think mortality

8262
02:09:50,470 --> 02:09:50,480
yes and so i think mortality
 

8263
02:09:50,480 --> 02:09:53,109
yes and so i think mortality
might be a blessing and immortality may

8264
02:09:53,109 --> 02:09:53,119
might be a blessing and immortality may
 

8265
02:09:53,119 --> 02:09:53,990
might be a blessing and immortality may
not

8266
02:09:53,990 --> 02:09:54,000
not
 

8267
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,149
not
so i think that we value things because

8268
02:09:56,149 --> 02:09:56,159
so i think that we value things because
 

8269
02:09:56,159 --> 02:09:57,990
so i think that we value things because
we have that finite life

8270
02:09:57,990 --> 02:09:58,000
we have that finite life
 

8271
02:09:58,000 --> 02:09:59,669
we have that finite life
we we appreciate things we want to do

8272
02:09:59,669 --> 02:09:59,679
we we appreciate things we want to do
 

8273
02:09:59,679 --> 02:10:00,550
we we appreciate things we want to do
this we want to do that we have

8274
02:10:00,550 --> 02:10:00,560
this we want to do that we have
 

8275
02:10:00,560 --> 02:10:01,430
this we want to do that we have
motivation

8276
02:10:01,430 --> 02:10:01,440
motivation
 

8277
02:10:01,440 --> 02:10:03,030
motivation
if i told you no you have infinite life

8278
02:10:03,030 --> 02:10:03,040
if i told you no you have infinite life
 

8279
02:10:03,040 --> 02:10:04,629
if i told you no you have infinite life
oh i don't i don't need to do this today

8280
02:10:04,629 --> 02:10:04,639

8284
02:10:08,229 --> 02:10:08,239
it's a billion or trillion or infinite
 

8285
02:10:08,239 --> 02:10:09,990
it's a billion or trillion or infinite
life so why do i do now

8286
02:10:09,990 --> 02:10:10,000
life so why do i do now
 

8287
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,310
life so why do i do now
there is no motivation a lot of the

8288
02:10:12,310 --> 02:10:12,320
there is no motivation a lot of the
 

8289
02:10:12,320 --> 02:10:13,510
there is no motivation a lot of the
things that we do

8290
02:10:13,510 --> 02:10:13,520
things that we do
 

8291
02:10:13,520 --> 02:10:15,350
things that we do
are driven by that finiteness this

8292
02:10:15,350 --> 02:10:15,360
are driven by that finiteness this
 

8293
02:10:15,360 --> 02:10:17,189
are driven by that finiteness this
refinedness of these resources so i

8294
02:10:17,189 --> 02:10:17,199
refinedness of these resources so i
 

8295
02:10:17,199 --> 02:10:17,589
refinedness of these resources so i
think

8296
02:10:17,589 --> 02:10:17,599
think
 

8297
02:10:17,599 --> 02:10:20,390
think
it's a blessing in disguise i don't

8298
02:10:20,390 --> 02:10:20,400
it's a blessing in disguise i don't
 

8299
02:10:20,400 --> 02:10:22,149
it's a blessing in disguise i don't
regret it that we have more

8300
02:10:22,149 --> 02:10:22,159
regret it that we have more
 

8301
02:10:22,159 --> 02:10:25,430
regret it that we have more
finite life and i think

8302
02:10:25,430 --> 02:10:25,440
finite life and i think
 

8303
02:10:25,440 --> 02:10:28,709
finite life and i think
i think that the the process

8304
02:10:28,709 --> 02:10:28,719
i think that the the process
 

8305
02:10:28,719 --> 02:10:31,270
i think that the the process
of uh being part of this thing that you

8306
02:10:31,270 --> 02:10:31,280
of uh being part of this thing that you
 

8307
02:10:31,280 --> 02:10:31,830
of uh being part of this thing that you
know the

8308
02:10:31,830 --> 02:10:31,840
know the
 

8309
02:10:31,840 --> 02:10:34,629
know the
the reality to me part of what attracts

8310
02:10:34,629 --> 02:10:34,639
the reality to me part of what attracts
 

8311
02:10:34,639 --> 02:10:36,390
the reality to me part of what attracts
me to science

8312
02:10:36,390 --> 02:10:36,400
me to science
 

8313
02:10:36,400 --> 02:10:38,790
me to science
is to connect to that immortality kind

8314
02:10:38,790 --> 02:10:38,800
is to connect to that immortality kind
 

8315
02:10:38,800 --> 02:10:39,589
is to connect to that immortality kind
of

8316
02:10:39,589 --> 02:10:39,599
of
 

8317
02:10:39,599 --> 02:10:43,830
of
namely the laws the reality is beyond us

8318
02:10:43,830 --> 02:10:43,840
namely the laws the reality is beyond us
 

8319
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:46,870
namely the laws the reality is beyond us
to me i'm i'm i'm resigned to the fact

8320
02:10:46,870 --> 02:10:46,880
to me i'm i'm i'm resigned to the fact
 

8321
02:10:46,880 --> 02:10:47,830
to me i'm i'm i'm resigned to the fact
that not only me

8322
02:10:47,830 --> 02:10:47,840
that not only me
 

8323
02:10:47,840 --> 02:10:50,629
that not only me
everybody is going to die so this is a

8324
02:10:50,629 --> 02:10:50,639
everybody is going to die so this is a
 

8325
02:10:50,639 --> 02:10:52,390
everybody is going to die so this is a
little bit of a consolation none of us

8326
02:10:52,390 --> 02:10:52,400
little bit of a consolation none of us
 

8327
02:10:52,400 --> 02:10:53,830
little bit of a consolation none of us
are going to be around

8328
02:10:53,830 --> 02:10:53,840
are going to be around
 

8329
02:10:53,840 --> 02:10:55,910
are going to be around
so therefore okay and none of none of

8330
02:10:55,910 --> 02:10:55,920
so therefore okay and none of none of
 

8331
02:10:55,920 --> 02:10:57,510
so therefore okay and none of none of
the people before me are around so

8332
02:10:57,510 --> 02:10:57,520
the people before me are around so
 

8333
02:10:57,520 --> 02:10:58,950
the people before me are around so
therefore yeah okay this is

8334
02:10:58,950 --> 02:10:58,960
therefore yeah okay this is
 

8335
02:10:58,960 --> 02:11:01,510
therefore yeah okay this is
something everybody goes through so so

8336
02:11:01,510 --> 02:11:01,520
something everybody goes through so so
 

8337
02:11:01,520 --> 02:11:03,350
something everybody goes through so so
taking that minuscule version of

8338
02:11:03,350 --> 02:11:03,360
taking that minuscule version of
 

8339
02:11:03,360 --> 02:11:05,830
taking that minuscule version of
okay how tiny we are and how short time

8340
02:11:05,830 --> 02:11:05,840
okay how tiny we are and how short time
 

8341
02:11:05,840 --> 02:11:07,430
okay how tiny we are and how short time
it is and so on

8342
02:11:07,430 --> 02:11:07,440
it is and so on
 

8343
02:11:07,440 --> 02:11:09,990
it is and so on
to connect to the deeper truth beyond us

8344
02:11:09,990 --> 02:11:10,000
to connect to the deeper truth beyond us
 

8345
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:11,830
to connect to the deeper truth beyond us
the reality beyond us

8346
02:11:11,830 --> 02:11:11,840
the reality beyond us
 

8347
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:15,350
the reality beyond us
is what sense of quote-unquote

8348
02:11:15,350 --> 02:11:15,360
is what sense of quote-unquote
 

8349
02:11:15,360 --> 02:11:16,790
is what sense of quote-unquote
immortality i would get

8350
02:11:16,790 --> 02:11:16,800
immortality i would get
 

8351
02:11:16,800 --> 02:11:19,030
immortality i would get
namely i at least i can hang on to this

8352
02:11:19,030 --> 02:11:19,040
namely i at least i can hang on to this
 

8353
02:11:19,040 --> 02:11:20,629
namely i at least i can hang on to this
little piece of truth

8354
02:11:20,629 --> 02:11:20,639
little piece of truth
 

8355
02:11:20,639 --> 02:11:22,629
little piece of truth
even though i know i know it's not

8356
02:11:22,629 --> 02:11:22,639
even though i know i know it's not
 

8357
02:11:22,639 --> 02:11:24,790
even though i know i know it's not
complete i know it's going to be

8358
02:11:24,790 --> 02:11:24,800
complete i know it's going to be
 

8359
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:26,470
complete i know it's going to be
imp imperfect i know it's going to

8360
02:11:26,470 --> 02:11:26,480
imp imperfect i know it's going to
 

8361
02:11:26,480 --> 02:11:28,310
imp imperfect i know it's going to
change and it's going to be improved

8362
02:11:28,310 --> 02:11:28,320
change and it's going to be improved
 

8363
02:11:28,320 --> 02:11:30,470
change and it's going to be improved
but having a little bit deeper insight

8364
02:11:30,470 --> 02:11:30,480
but having a little bit deeper insight
 

8365
02:11:30,480 --> 02:11:32,629
but having a little bit deeper insight
than than just the naive thing around us

8366
02:11:32,629 --> 02:11:32,639
than than just the naive thing around us
 

8367
02:11:32,639 --> 02:11:34,390
than than just the naive thing around us
little earth year and little galaxy and

8368
02:11:34,390 --> 02:11:34,400
little earth year and little galaxy and
 

8369
02:11:34,400 --> 02:11:35,189
little earth year and little galaxy and
so on

8370
02:11:35,189 --> 02:11:35,199
so on
 

8371
02:11:35,199 --> 02:11:38,310
so on
makes me feel a little bit more uh more

8372
02:11:38,310 --> 02:11:38,320
makes me feel a little bit more uh more
 

8373
02:11:38,320 --> 02:11:39,189
makes me feel a little bit more uh more
pleasure to

8374
02:11:39,189 --> 02:11:39,199
pleasure to
 

8375
02:11:39,199 --> 02:11:40,709
pleasure to
to live this life so i think that's the

8376
02:11:40,709 --> 02:11:40,719
to live this life so i think that's the
 

8377
02:11:40,719 --> 02:11:43,109
to live this life so i think that's the
way i view my my role as a scientist

8378
02:11:43,109 --> 02:11:43,119
way i view my my role as a scientist
 

8379
02:11:43,119 --> 02:11:46,229
way i view my my role as a scientist
yeah this the scarcity of this life

8380
02:11:46,229 --> 02:11:46,239
yeah this the scarcity of this life
 

8381
02:11:46,239 --> 02:11:49,270
yeah this the scarcity of this life
helps us appreciate the beauty of the

8382
02:11:49,270 --> 02:11:49,280
helps us appreciate the beauty of the
 

8383
02:11:49,280 --> 02:11:52,390
helps us appreciate the beauty of the
the immortal the universal truths of

8384
02:11:52,390 --> 02:11:52,400
the immortal the universal truths of
 

8385
02:11:52,400 --> 02:11:55,109
the immortal the universal truths of
that physics present us and maybe maybe

8386
02:11:55,109 --> 02:11:55,119
that physics present us and maybe maybe
 

8387
02:11:55,119 --> 02:11:55,990
that physics present us and maybe maybe
one day

8388
02:11:55,990 --> 02:11:56,000
one day
 

8389
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,790
one day
physics will will have something to say

8390
02:11:58,790 --> 02:11:58,800
physics will will have something to say
 

8391
02:11:58,800 --> 02:11:59,910
physics will will have something to say
about

8392
02:11:59,910 --> 02:11:59,920
about
 

8393
02:11:59,920 --> 02:12:03,350
about
that that beauty in itself

8394
02:12:03,350 --> 02:12:03,360
that that beauty in itself
 

8395
02:12:03,360 --> 02:12:05,589
that that beauty in itself
explaining why the heck it's so

8396
02:12:05,589 --> 02:12:05,599
explaining why the heck it's so
 

8397
02:12:05,599 --> 02:12:06,390
explaining why the heck it's so
beautiful

8398
02:12:06,390 --> 02:12:06,400
beautiful
 

8399
02:12:06,400 --> 02:12:08,310
beautiful
to appreciate the laws of physics and

8400
02:12:08,310 --> 02:12:08,320
to appreciate the laws of physics and
 

8401
02:12:08,320 --> 02:12:09,510
to appreciate the laws of physics and
yet

8402
02:12:09,510 --> 02:12:09,520
yet
 

8403
02:12:09,520 --> 02:12:12,629
yet
um why it's so tragic that we uh

8404
02:12:12,629 --> 02:12:12,639
um why it's so tragic that we uh
 

8405
02:12:12,639 --> 02:12:15,669
um why it's so tragic that we uh
we would die so quickly yes we do so

8406
02:12:15,669 --> 02:12:15,679
we would die so quickly yes we do so
 

8407
02:12:15,679 --> 02:12:17,189
we would die so quickly yes we do so
quickly so that can be a bit longer

8408
02:12:17,189 --> 02:12:17,199
quickly so that can be a bit longer
 

8409
02:12:17,199 --> 02:12:17,990
quickly so that can be a bit longer
that's for sure

8410

that's for sure
 

8411
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:19,990
that's for sure
it would be very nice maybe physics will

8412
02:12:19,990 --> 02:12:20,000
it would be very nice maybe physics will
 

8413
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,229
it would be very nice maybe physics will
help out well karma and it was uh

8414
02:12:22,229 --> 02:12:22,239
help out well karma and it was uh
 

8415
02:12:22,239 --> 02:12:24,229
help out well karma and it was uh
an incredible conversation thank you so

picture
 

8421
02:12:26,880 --> 02:12:29,830
picture
of the history of physics and it kind of

8422
02:12:29,830 --> 02:12:29,840
of the history of physics and it kind of
 

8423
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:31,189
of the history of physics and it kind of
presents a hopeful
