in the universe yes I do believe so we

in the universe yes I do believe so we
 

71
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,320
in the universe yes I do believe so we
have no evidence of it but I think the

72
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:27,330
have no evidence of it but I think the
 

73
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,240
have no evidence of it but I think the
probabilities are overwhelming in favor

give me a universe where we have 10 to

thing that we have special is we can
talk about it of course not all people

126
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:32,190
talk about it of course not all people
 

127

can talk about the babies and little

can talk about the babies and little
 

129
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,750
can talk about the babies and little
children can talk about the patients who

inferior frontal gyrus can talk about it
 

135
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,590
inferior frontal gyrus can talk about it
but most normal adult people can talk

but most normal adult people can talk
 

137
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,570
but most normal adult people can talk
about it and so we think that makes us

138
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:44,580
about it and so we think that makes us

that they to experience the world and so

that they to experience the world and so
 

149
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,540
that they to experience the world and so
it's overwhelmingly likely that other

it's overwhelmingly likely that other

155
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,640
their world of course differently
because they have a difference in serum

because they have a difference in serum
 

157
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,020
because they have a difference in serum
they've different sense of they had a

they've different sense of they had a
 

159
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,300
they've different sense of they had a
very different environment but the fact

160
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:05,310
very different environment but the fact
 

161
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,480
very different environment but the fact
that I would strongly suppose that they

00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,870
human alive but may not have experience
what is the gap well so that's a big big

324
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:29,880
what is the gap well so that's a big big
 

325
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,730
what is the gap well so that's a big big
question that's occupied people for the

326
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:31,740
question that's occupied people for the
 

327
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,940
question that's occupied people for the
last certainly last 50 years since we

00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:37,840
you know since he happened the birth of
 

331
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,689
you know since he happened the birth of
of computers that's a question on

332
00:06:39,689 --> 00:06:39,699
of computers that's a question on
 

333
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,340
of computers that's a question on
chilling try to answer and of course he

334
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:41,350
chilling try to answer and of course he
 

335
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,260
chilling try to answer and of course he
did it in this indirect way by proposing

336
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:43,270
did it in this indirect way by proposing
 

337
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,260
did it in this indirect way by proposing
its test and operational test so but

338
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:46,270
its test and operational test so but
 

339
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,689
its test and operational test so but
that's not really that's you know he

340
00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:48,699
that's not really that's you know he
 

341
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,100
that's not really that's you know he
tried to get it what does it mean for

342
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:50,110
tried to get it what does it mean for
 

343
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,110
tried to get it what does it mean for
person to think and then he had this

344
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:52,120
person to think and then he had this
 

345
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,180
person to think and then he had this
test like you lock him away and then you

346
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:54,190
test like you lock him away and then you
 

347
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,500
test like you lock him away and then you
have a communication with him and then

348
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:55,510
have a communication with him and then
 

349
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,780
have a communication with him and then
you try to to guess after while whether

00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,510
you go talk about a Paramecium or a
little worm alright and and we see the

422
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:15,520
little worm alright and and we see the
 

423
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,190
little worm alright and and we see the
complexity of the nervous system goes

424

complexity of the nervous system goes
 

425
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,730

from one cell to two specialized cells
 

427
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,830
from one cell to two specialized cells
to a worm that has three net that has

00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:22,840
to a worm that has three net that has

00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,020
to a worm that has three net that has
30% of its cells and nerve cells to

that ever has had a billion even more
 

435
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,379
that ever has had a billion even more
nerve cells and so they based on

436
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:31,389
nerve cells and so they based on
 

437
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:33,120
nerve cells and so they based on
behavioral evidence and based on the

438
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,130
behavioral evidence and based on the
 

439
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,370
behavioral evidence and based on the
underlying neuroscience we believe that

440
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:35,380
underlying neuroscience we believe that
 

441
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,740
underlying neuroscience we believe that
as these creatures become more complex

00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:37,750
as these creatures become more complex
 

443
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,500
as these creatures become more complex
they are better adapted to it to their

00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:45,520
become more conscious probably because
 

449
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,949
become more conscious probably because
their brain calls and we believe

450
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:46,959
their brain calls and we believe

00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:12,760
right and you know so we still have this

00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,400
right and you know so we still have this

and so we see brains of different
 

481
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,880
and so we see brains of different

00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:03,980
mystical experiences you have a
dissociation of function form of

intelligence from from conscious no
 

805
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,400
intelligence from from conscious no
consciousness you caught me asking a

806
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:10,410
consciousness you caught me asking a
 

807
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,100
consciousness you caught me asking a
white question let me ask a question

808
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:13,110
white question let me ask a question
 

809
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:15,170
white question let me ask a question
that's not a white question you're

810
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:15,180
that's not a white question you're
 

811
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,910
that's not a white question you're
giving a talk later today on the Turing

812
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:16,920
giving a talk later today on the Turing
 

813
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,920
giving a talk later today on the Turing
test for intelligence and consciousness

814
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:18,930
test for intelligence and consciousness
 

815
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:21,590
test for intelligence and consciousness
drawing lines between the two so is

816
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:21,600
drawing lines between the two so is
 

817
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,870
drawing lines between the two so is
there a scientific way to say there's

818
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:23,880
there a scientific way to say there's
 

819
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,480
there a scientific way to say there's
consciousness present in this entity or

820
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:26,490
consciousness present in this entity or
 

821
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:30,560
consciousness present in this entity or
not and to anticipate your answer

822
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:30,570
not and to anticipate your answer
 

823
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:30,990
not and to anticipate your answer
because

824
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:31,000
because
 

825
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,939
because
you also there's a neurobiological

826
00:15:32,939 --> 00:15:32,949
you also there's a neurobiological
 

827
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:35,519
you also there's a neurobiological
answer so we can test a human brain but

828
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:35,529
answer so we can test a human brain but
 

829
00:15:35,529 --> 00:15:37,470
answer so we can test a human brain but
if you take a machine brain that you

830
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:37,480
if you take a machine brain that you
 

831
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,769
if you take a machine brain that you
don't know tests for yet how would you

832
00:15:40,769 --> 00:15:40,779
don't know tests for yet how would you
 

833
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:44,400
don't know tests for yet how would you
even begin to approach a test if there's

834
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:44,410
even begin to approach a test if there's
 

835
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,499
even begin to approach a test if there's
consciousness present in this thing okay

836
00:15:46,499 --> 00:15:46,509
consciousness present in this thing okay
 

837
00:15:46,509 --> 00:15:48,150
consciousness present in this thing okay
that's a really good question so let me

838
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:48,160
that's a really good question so let me
 

839
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,939
that's a really good question so let me
take in two steps so as you point out

840
00:15:49,939 --> 00:15:49,949
take in two steps so as you point out
 

841
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:53,610
take in two steps so as you point out
for for for for humans let's just stick

842
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:53,620
for for for for humans let's just stick
 

843
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,350
for for for for humans let's just stick
with humans there's now a test called

844
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:55,360
with humans there's now a test called
 

845
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,509
with humans there's now a test called
the zap and zip it's a procedure where

846
00:15:57,509 --> 00:15:57,519
the zap and zip it's a procedure where
 

847
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,069
the zap and zip it's a procedure where
you ping the brain using transcranial

848
00:15:59,069 --> 00:15:59,079
you ping the brain using transcranial
 

849
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:01,410
you ping the brain using transcranial
magnetic stimulation you look at the

850
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:01,420
magnetic stimulation you look at the
 

851
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,569
magnetic stimulation you look at the
electrical reverberations essentially

852
00:16:03,569 --> 00:16:03,579
electrical reverberations essentially
 

853
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:06,179
electrical reverberations essentially
using EEG and then you can measure the

854
00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:06,189
using EEG and then you can measure the
 

855
00:16:06,189 --> 00:16:07,889
using EEG and then you can measure the
complexity of this plain response and

856
00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:07,899
complexity of this plain response and
 

857
00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:09,449
complexity of this plain response and
you can do this in a way people in

858
00:16:09,449 --> 00:16:09,459
you can do this in a way people in
 

859
00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:11,879
you can do this in a way people in
asleep normal people you can do it in a

860
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:11,889
asleep normal people you can do it in a
 

861
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:13,590
asleep normal people you can do it in a
wake people and then anesthetize them

862
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:13,600
wake people and then anesthetize them
 

863
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,290
wake people and then anesthetize them
you can do it in patients and it's it it

864
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:16,300
you can do it in patients and it's it it
 

865
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,079
you can do it in patients and it's it it
has hundred percent accuracy that in all

866
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:19,089
has hundred percent accuracy that in all
 

867
00:16:19,089 --> 00:16:20,460
has hundred percent accuracy that in all
those cases when you're clear the

868
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:20,470
those cases when you're clear the
 

869
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:21,720
those cases when you're clear the
patient or the person is either

870
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:21,730
patient or the person is either
 

871
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,519
patient or the person is either
conscious or unconscious the complexity

872
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:23,529
conscious or unconscious the complexity
 

873
00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:25,319
conscious or unconscious the complexity
is either high or low and then you can

874
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:25,329
is either high or low and then you can
 

875
00:16:25,329 --> 00:16:26,639
is either high or low and then you can
adopt these techniques to similar

876
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:26,649
adopt these techniques to similar
 

877
00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:28,590
adopt these techniques to similar
creatures like monkeys and dogs and and

878
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:28,600
creatures like monkeys and dogs and and
 

879
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,069
creatures like monkeys and dogs and and
and mice that have very similar brains

880
00:16:31,069 --> 00:16:31,079
and mice that have very similar brains
 

881
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:33,749
and mice that have very similar brains
now of course you you point out that may

882
00:16:33,749 --> 00:16:33,759
now of course you you point out that may
 

883
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,519
now of course you you point out that may
not help you because we don't have a

884
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:35,529
not help you because we don't have a
 

885
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:37,470
not help you because we don't have a
cortex you know and if I send a magnetic

886
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:37,480
cortex you know and if I send a magnetic
 

887
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,749
cortex you know and if I send a magnetic
pulse into my iPhone or my computer it's

888
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:39,759
pulse into my iPhone or my computer it's
 

889
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,759
pulse into my iPhone or my computer it's
probably gonna break something so we

890
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:41,769
probably gonna break something so we
 

891
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:42,990
probably gonna break something so we
don't have that so what we need

892
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:43,000
don't have that so what we need
 

893
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,470
don't have that so what we need
ultimately we need a theory of

894
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:46,480
ultimately we need a theory of
 

895
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,600
ultimately we need a theory of
consciousness we can't just rely on our

896
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:48,610
consciousness we can't just rely on our
 

897
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,549
consciousness we can't just rely on our
intuition our intuition is well yeah if

898
00:16:50,549 --> 00:16:50,559
intuition our intuition is well yeah if
 

899
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:53,579
intuition our intuition is well yeah if
somebody talks they're conscious however

900
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:53,589
somebody talks they're conscious however
 

901
00:16:53,589 --> 00:16:55,110
somebody talks they're conscious however
then they're all these page children

902
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:55,120
then they're all these page children
 

903
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,269
then they're all these page children
babies don't talk right but we believe

904
00:16:57,269 --> 00:16:57,279
babies don't talk right but we believe
 

905
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,850
babies don't talk right but we believe
that that the babies also have conscious

906
00:16:59,850 --> 00:16:59,860
that that the babies also have conscious
 

907
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,710
that that the babies also have conscious
experiences right and then there are

908
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:01,720
experiences right and then there are
 

909
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,380
experiences right and then there are
these patients I mentioned did and they

910
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:04,390
these patients I mentioned did and they
 

911
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,970
these patients I mentioned did and they
don't talk when you dream you can't talk

912
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:05,980
don't talk when you dream you can't talk
 

913
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,069
don't talk when you dream you can't talk
because you're paralyzed so so what

914
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:08,079
because you're paralyzed so so what
 

915
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,600
because you're paralyzed so so what
would we ultimately need we can't just

916
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:09,610
would we ultimately need we can't just
 

917
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:11,939
would we ultimately need we can't just
rely on our intuition we need a theory

918
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:11,949
rely on our intuition we need a theory
 

919
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:14,189
rely on our intuition we need a theory
of constants that tells us what is it

920
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:14,199
of constants that tells us what is it
 

921
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,929
of constants that tells us what is it
about a piece of matter what is it about

922
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:15,939
about a piece of matter what is it about
 

923
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:17,850
about a piece of matter what is it about
a piece of highly excitable matter like

924
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:17,860
a piece of highly excitable matter like
 

925
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,890
a piece of highly excitable matter like
the brain or like a computer that give

926
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:19,900
the brain or like a computer that give
 

927
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,990
the brain or like a computer that give
rise to conscious experience we all

928
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:22,000
rise to conscious experience we all
 

929
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,669
rise to conscious experience we all
believe none of us believe anymore in

930
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:23,679
believe none of us believe anymore in
 

931
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,860
believe none of us believe anymore in
the old story it's a soul but that used

932
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:25,870
the old story it's a soul but that used
 

933
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:27,270
the old story it's a soul but that used
to be the most common explanation that

934
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:27,280
to be the most common explanation that
 

935
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,680
to be the most common explanation that
most people accept that in still a lot

936
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:28,690
most people accept that in still a lot
 

937
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,480
most people accept that in still a lot
of people today believe well there's

938
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:30,490
of people today believe well there's
 

939
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,970
of people today believe well there's
there's God and doubt only us was a

940
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:32,980
there's God and doubt only us was a
 

941
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,130
there's God and doubt only us was a
special thing that animals don't have

942
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:35,140
special thing that animals don't have

00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,389
Rene Descartes famously said a dog if he
hit it with your carriage may Yelp me

946
00:17:39,389 --> 00:17:39,399
hit it with your carriage may Yelp me
 

947
00:17:39,399 --> 00:17:41,580
hit it with your carriage may Yelp me
cry but it doesn't have this special

948
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:41,590
cry but it doesn't have this special
 

949
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:43,080
cry but it doesn't have this special
thing it doesn't have the magic the

950
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:43,090
thing it doesn't have the magic the
 

951
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,430
thing it doesn't have the magic the
magic salt oh yeah

952
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:44,440
magic salt oh yeah

00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,710
magic salt oh yeah
it doesn't have restaurants the soul now

954
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:46,720
it doesn't have restaurants the soul now
 

955
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,360
it doesn't have restaurants the soul now
we believe that isn't the case anymore

956
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:48,370
we believe that isn't the case anymore
 

957
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:51,389
we believe that isn't the case anymore
so what is the difference between brains

958
00:17:51,389 --> 00:17:51,399

do you have to say she's not conscious

970
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:06,730
do you have to say she's not conscious
 

971
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:08,730
do you have to say she's not conscious
in particular if she says it's of course

there are several differences one is so

982
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:23,620
there are several differences one is so
 

983
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,710
there are several differences one is so
this relates to the problem they're very

984
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:25,720
this relates to the problem they're very
 

985
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,159
this relates to the problem they're very

hard
 

987
00:18:26,169 --> 00:18:28,230

why is consciousness a hard problem it's

988
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:28,240
why is consciousness a hard problem it's
 

989
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,049
why is consciousness a hard problem it's
because it's subjective right only I

00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:55,600
if I give you this muesli and ask you
 

1015
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,180

how does it taste you tell me things

1016
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:57,190
how does it taste you tell me things
 

1017
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:59,399
how does it taste you tell me things
that you know that that I would also say

1018
00:18:59,399 --> 00:18:59,409
that you know that that I would also say
 

1019
00:18:59,409 --> 00:19:01,320
that you know that that I would also say
more or less I yes so I infer based on

1020
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:01,330
more or less I yes so I infer based on
 

1021
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:02,700
more or less I yes so I infer based on
all of that that you're conscious now

1022
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:02,710
all of that that you're conscious now
 

1023
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:04,230
all of that that you're conscious now
we're silly I can't do that so there I

1024
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:04,240
we're silly I can't do that so there I
 

1025
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,269
we're silly I can't do that so there I
really need a theory that tells me what

1026
00:19:06,269 --> 00:19:06,279
really need a theory that tells me what
 

1027
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:09,480
really need a theory that tells me what
is it about above any system this or

1028
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:09,490
is it about above any system this or
 

1029
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,399
is it about above any system this or
this it makes it conscious and we have

1030
00:19:11,399 --> 00:19:11,409
this it makes it conscious and we have
 

1031
00:19:11,409 --> 00:19:14,190
this it makes it conscious and we have
such a theory yes so the the integrator

1032
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:14,200
such a theory yes so the the integrator
 

1033
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,529
such a theory yes so the the integrator
information theory is but let me first

1034
00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:16,539
information theory is but let me first
 

1035
00:19:16,539 --> 00:19:18,029
information theory is but let me first
maybe his introduction for people are

a lot about pants psychism can you

1040
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:24,429
a lot about pants psychism can you
 

1041
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:28,379
a lot about pants psychism can you
describe what physicalism versus dualism

1051
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,159
of which pan site-- chasm can emerge of
dualism versus physicalism or do you not

1052
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:47,169
dualism versus physicalism or do you not
 

1053
00:19:47,169 --> 00:19:49,139

see pants psychism is fitting into that

1054
00:19:49,139 --> 00:19:49,149
see pants psychism is fitting into that
 

1055
00:19:49,149 --> 00:19:51,659
see pants psychism is fitting into that
and no you can argue there's some well

ok so let's step back so kemp psychism
 

1059

try to advocate this for this idea it's
called gazelian monism that that pant

1114
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:00,980
called gazelian monism that that pant
 

1115
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,250
called gazelian monism that that pant
psychism is really physics viewed from

1116
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:03,260
psychism is really physics viewed from
 

1117
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:06,250
psychism is really physics viewed from
the inside so the idea is that physics

1118
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:06,260
the inside so the idea is that physics
 

1119
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,560
the inside so the idea is that physics
is very good at describing relationship

1120
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:08,570
is very good at describing relationship
 

1121
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:11,290
is very good at describing relationship
among objects like charges or like

1122
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:11,300
among objects like charges or like
 

1123
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,720
among objects like charges or like
gravity all right you know this card the

1124
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:13,730
gravity all right you know this card the
 

1125
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,490
gravity all right you know this card the
relationship between curvature and mass

1126
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:15,500
relationship between curvature and mass
 

1127
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,930
relationship between curvature and mass
distribution okay that's the

1128
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:16,940
distribution okay that's the
 

1129
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,700
distribution okay that's the
relationship among thing physics doesn't

1130
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:18,710
relationship among thing physics doesn't
 

1131
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,110
relationship among thing physics doesn't
really describe the ultimate reality

1132
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:20,120
really describe the ultimate reality
 

1133
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,630
really describe the ultimate reality
itself it's just relationship among you

1134
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:22,640
itself it's just relationship among you
 

1135
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,030

know quarks or all these other stuffs

1136
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:25,040
know quarks or all these other stuffs
 

1137
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,520

from like a third-person observer yeah

1138
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:27,530
from like a third-person observer yeah

yes and consciousness is what physics

1140
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:30,800
yes and consciousness is what physics
 

1141
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,770
yes and consciousness is what physics
feels from the inside so my conscious

1142
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:32,780
feels from the inside so my conscious
 

1143
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:35,230
feels from the inside so my conscious
experience it's a way the physics of my

1144
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:35,240
experience it's a way the physics of my
 

1145
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,330
experience it's a way the physics of my
brain particular my cortex feel from the

1146
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:37,340
brain particular my cortex feel from the
 

1147
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:40,900
brain particular my cortex feel from the
inside and so if you are Paramecium you

1148
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:40,910
inside and so if you are Paramecium you
 

1149
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:42,220
inside and so if you are Paramecium you
gotta remember you see Paramecium well

1150
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:42,230
gotta remember you see Paramecium well
 

1151
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:43,690
gotta remember you see Paramecium well
that's a pretty dumb creature this but

if you like something yep so this is

1180
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:13,620
if you like something yep so this is
 

1181
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,500
if you like something yep so this is
really interesting can we draw some

1182
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:15,510
really interesting can we draw some
 

1183
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,720
really interesting can we draw some
lines and maybe try to understand the

1184
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:17,730
lines and maybe try to understand the
 

1185
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:21,260
lines and maybe try to understand the
difference between life intelligence and

1186

difference between life intelligence and
 

1187
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:24,170
difference between life intelligence and
consciousness how do you see all of

1188
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:24,180
consciousness how do you see all of
 

1189
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,720
consciousness how do you see all of
those if you have to define what is a

1190
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:26,730
those if you have to define what is a
 

1191
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:29,750
those if you have to define what is a
living thing what is a conscious thing

1192
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:29,760
living thing what is a conscious thing
 

1193
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,610
living thing what is a conscious thing
and what is an intelligent thing do

1194
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:31,620
and what is an intelligent thing do
 

1195
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,950

those intermix for you or they totally
 

1197
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,810
those intermix for you or they totally
separate okay so a that's a question

1198
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:35,820
separate okay so a that's a question
 

1199
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,640
separate okay so a that's a question
that we don't have a full answer right

they have a sensitive so only animals
 

1235
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:13,460
they have a sensitive so only animals
and humans have also a sensitive soul or

00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:13,470
and humans have also a sensitive soul or
 

1237
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:15,560
and humans have also a sensitive soul or
an appetitive soul they they can see

1243
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:23,030
want to repeat use they want to eat etc
and then only humans have what he called

1244
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:23,040
and then only humans have what he called
 

1245
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,480
and then only humans have what he called
a rational soul okay right and that idea

1246
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:26,490
a rational soul okay right and that idea
 

1247
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,580
a rational soul okay right and that idea
that made it into christen dome and then

1248
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:28,590
that made it into christen dome and then
 

1249
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,320
that made it into christen dome and then
the rational soul is the one that lives

1250

00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:33,750
really I mean different readings of
 

1255
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,720
really I mean different readings of
Aristotle give different was that did he

1256
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:35,730
Aristotle give different was that did he
 

1257
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:37,340
Aristotle give different was that did he
believe that rational soul was immortal

1258

believe that rational soul was immortal
 

1259
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,860
believe that rational soul was immortal
or not I probably think he didn't but

1260
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:39,870
or not I probably think he didn't but
 

1261
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:41,300
or not I probably think he didn't but
then of course that made it into its who

00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:03,750
and so in evolution evolved systems they
 

1393
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:06,110
and so in evolution evolved systems they
go together in artificial system

because it simulates it's a difference

1442
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:53,940
because it simulates it's a difference
 

1443
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,210
because it simulates it's a difference
between the simulated and the real so it

1444
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:56,220
between the simulated and the real so it
 

1445
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,490
between the simulated and the real so it
simulates the behavior salted with

intelligence is not the same as having
 

1457
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,120
intelligence is not the same as having
conscious experiences and I'll give you

this computer simulation suck me in

1484
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:43,160
this computer simulation suck me in
 

1485
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,430
this computer simulation suck me in
alright it simulates gravity but it

1486
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:46,440
alright it simulates gravity but it
 

1487
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,800
alright it simulates gravity but it
doesn't have the causal power of gravity

1488
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:48,810
doesn't have the causal power of gravity
 

1489
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:50,960
doesn't have the causal power of gravity
it's a huge difference so it's a

1490
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:50,970
it's a huge difference so it's a
 

1491
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:53,870
it's a huge difference so it's a
difference between the real and and the

1492
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:53,880
difference between the real and and the
 

1493
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,520
difference between the real and and the
simulator just like it doesn't get wet

1494
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:55,530
simulator just like it doesn't get wet
 

1495
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:56,990

inside the computer when the computer

1496
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:57,000
inside the computer when the computer
 

1497
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,580
inside the computer when the computer
runs code that simulates a weather storm

1498
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:58,590
runs code that simulates a weather storm
 

1499
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:01,520
runs code that simulates a weather storm
and so in order to have to have

1500
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:01,530
and so in order to have to have
 

1501
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:03,830
and so in order to have to have
artificial continents you have to give

1502
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:03,840
artificial continents you have to give
 

1503
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,050
artificial continents you have to give
it the same causal power as a human

1504
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:06,060
it the same causal power as a human
 

1505
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,090
it the same causal power as a human
brain yes you have to build so-called a

1506
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:08,100
brain yes you have to build so-called a
 

1507
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,430
brain yes you have to build so-called a
neuromorphic machine that has hardware

1508
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:10,440
neuromorphic machine that has hardware
 

1509
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,260
neuromorphic machine that has hardware
that is very similar to the human brain

1510
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:12,270
that is very similar to the human brain
 

1511
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:15,950
that is very similar to the human brain
not a digital clock for normal computer

1512
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:15,960
not a digital clock for normal computer
 

1513
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,370
not a digital clock for normal computer
so that's just to clarify though you

1514
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:19,380
so that's just to clarify though you
 

1515
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:22,130
so that's just to clarify though you
think that consciousness is not required

1516
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:22,140
think that consciousness is not required
 

1517
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:25,370
think that consciousness is not required
to create human level intelligence it

1518
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:25,380
to create human level intelligence it
 

1519
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,010
to create human level intelligence it
seems to accompany in the human brain

1520
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:28,020
seems to accompany in the human brain
 

1521
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:33,230
seems to accompany in the human brain
but for a machine not of court so maybe

1522
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:33,240
but for a machine not of court so maybe
 

1523
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,620
but for a machine not of court so maybe
just because this is AGI let's dig in a

1524
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:36,630
just because this is AGI let's dig in a
 

1525
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,700
just because this is AGI let's dig in a
little bit about what we mean by

1526
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:37,710
little bit about what we mean by
 

1527
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:41,270
little bit about what we mean by
intelligence so one thing is the G

1528
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:41,280
intelligence so one thing is the G
 

1529
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,250
intelligence so one thing is the G
factor these kind of IQ tests of

1530
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:43,260
factor these kind of IQ tests of
 

1531
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:46,310
factor these kind of IQ tests of
intelligence but I think if you maybe

1532
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:46,320
intelligence but I think if you maybe
 

1533
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,090
intelligence but I think if you maybe
another way to say so in 2040 2050

1534
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:49,100
another way to say so in 2040 2050
 

1535
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,740
another way to say so in 2040 2050
people will have Siri that is

1536
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:51,750
people will have Siri that is
 

1537
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:55,220
people will have Siri that is
just really impressive do you think

1538
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:55,230
just really impressive do you think
 

1539
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:58,000
just really impressive do you think
people will say serious intelligent yes

1540
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,010
people will say serious intelligent yes
 

1541
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:01,280
people will say serious intelligent yes
intelligence is this amorphous thing so

1542
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:01,290
intelligence is this amorphous thing so
 

1543
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:03,620
intelligence is this amorphous thing so
it to be intelligent it seems like you

1544
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:03,630
it to be intelligent it seems like you
 

1545
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:05,210
it to be intelligent it seems like you
have to have some kind of connections

1546
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:05,220
have to have some kind of connections
 

1547
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:08,000
have to have some kind of connections
with other human beings in a sense that

1548
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,010
with other human beings in a sense that
 

1549
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:09,770
with other human beings in a sense that
you have to impress them with your

00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:09,780
you have to impress them with your
 

1551
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:13,430
you have to impress them with your
intelligence and their feels you have to

1552
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:13,440
intelligence and their feels you have to
 

1553
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,310
intelligence and their feels you have to

somehow operate in this world full of
 

1555
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,770
somehow operate in this world full of
humans and for that there feels like

1556
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:18,780
humans and for that there feels like
 

1557
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,240
humans and for that there feels like
there has to be something like

1558
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:20,250
there has to be something like
 

1559
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:22,670
there has to be something like
consciousness so you think you can have

1560
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:22,680
consciousness so you think you can have
 

1561
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,580

2019
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:13,160
conscious existence that is so basic and
so deeply satisfying you I think you

2020
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:13,170
so deeply satisfying you I think you
 

2021
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:15,440
so deeply satisfying you I think you
touch the root of being that's really

2022
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:15,450
touch the root of being that's really

what you're touching there you're
 

2025
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,140
what you're touching there you're
getting close to the root of being and

00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:18,150
getting close to the root of being and
 

2027
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:20,829
getting close to the root of being and
that's very different from intelligence

2028
00:38:20,829 --> 00:38:20,839
that's very different from intelligence

00:38:23,369 --> 00:38:25,310
so what do you think about the
simulation hypothesis simulation theory

2032

simulation hypothesis simulation theory
 

2033
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,990
simulation hypothesis simulation theory
the idea that we all live in a computer

scholars for many centuries are we all
 

2043
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,320
scholars for many centuries are we all

00:38:43,859 --> 00:38:45,770
right and this is just a modern version
of it it's it's it's it's equally

2048
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:45,780
of it it's it's it's it's equally
 

2049
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:48,380
of it it's it's it's it's equally
plausible people love talking about

2050
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:48,390
plausible people love talking about
 

2051
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:50,060
plausible people love talking about
these sorts of things I know their book

2052
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:50,070
these sorts of things I know their book
 

2053
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,079
these sorts of things I know their book
written is about the simulation

2054
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:51,089
written is about the simulation
 

2055

hypothesis if that's what people want to

2056
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:53,280
hypothesis if that's what people want to
 

2057
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,430
hypothesis if that's what people want to
do that's fine it seems rather esoteric

2058
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:55,440
do that's fine it seems rather esoteric
 

2059
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,849
do that's fine it seems rather esoteric
it's never testable but it's not useful

2060
00:38:58,849 --> 00:38:58,859
it's never testable but it's not useful
 

2061
00:38:58,859 --> 00:39:00,349
it's never testable but it's not useful
for you to think of in those terms so

2062
00:39:00,349 --> 00:39:00,359
for you to think of in those terms so
 

2063
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:02,750
for you to think of in those terms so
maybe connecting to the questions of

2064
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:02,760
maybe connecting to the questions of
 

2065
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,820
maybe connecting to the questions of
free will which you've talked about I

2066
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:04,830
free will which you've talked about I
 

2067
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:07,370
free will which you've talked about I
think vaguely wherever you saying that

2068
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:07,380
think vaguely wherever you saying that
 

2069
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:10,579
think vaguely wherever you saying that
the idea that there's no free will it

2070
00:39:10,579 --> 00:39:10,589
the idea that there's no free will it
 

2071
00:39:10,589 --> 00:39:13,880
the idea that there's no free will it
makes you very uncomfortable so what do

2072
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:13,890
makes you very uncomfortable so what do
 

2073
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:16,099
makes you very uncomfortable so what do
you think about free will and from that

2074
00:39:16,099 --> 00:39:16,109
you think about free will and from that
 

2075
00:39:16,109 --> 00:39:18,109
you think about free will and from that
you from a physics perspective or a

2076
00:39:18,109 --> 00:39:18,119
you from a physics perspective or a
 

2077
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:20,079
you from a physics perspective or a
consciousness perspective what is it all

2078
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:20,089
consciousness perspective what is it all
 

2079
00:39:20,089 --> 00:39:22,040
consciousness perspective what is it all
okay so from the physics perspective

2080
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:22,050
okay so from the physics perspective
 

2081
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:24,290
okay so from the physics perspective
leaving inside quantum mechanics we

2082
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:24,300
leaving inside quantum mechanics we
 

2083
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,760
leaving inside quantum mechanics we
believe we live in a fully deterministic

quantum mechanics so now we know that

2088
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:29,400
quantum mechanics so now we know that
 

2089
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,070
quantum mechanics so now we know that
certain things on principle not

certain things on principle not
 

2091
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,680
certain things on principle not

2092
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:33,690
predictable which as you said I prefer
 

2093
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:36,740

because the idea that at the initial

00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,150
because the idea that at the initial

now when it comes to consciousness I

00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,990
now when it comes to consciousness I
think we do have certain freedom we are

over there in that unconscious a lot I

2210
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:52,540
over there in that unconscious a lot I
 

2211
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,210
over there in that unconscious a lot I
mean much more than we think this is

2212
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:54,220
mean much more than we think this is
 

2213
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,160

00:44:30,519 --> 00:44:32,849
be better if you can analyze it and then
get it out of there or just forget it

2358
00:44:32,849 --> 00:44:32,859
get it out of there or just forget it
 

2359
00:44:32,859 --> 00:44:35,519
get it out of there or just forget it
ever happened you know that that seems a

2360
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:35,529
ever happened you know that that seems a
 

2361
00:44:35,529 --> 00:44:38,069
ever happened you know that that seems a
very buggy kind of well yeah but in

2362
00:44:38,069 --> 00:44:38,079
very buggy kind of well yeah but in
 

2363
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:39,599
very buggy kind of well yeah but in
general we don't have and that's

2364
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:39,609
general we don't have and that's
 

2365
00:44:39,609 --> 00:44:41,069
general we don't have and that's
probably functional we don't have an

2366
00:44:41,069 --> 00:44:41,079
probably functional we don't have an
 

2367
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:43,440
probably functional we don't have an
ability unless it's extremely of cases

2368
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:43,450
ability unless it's extremely of cases
 

2369
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:45,630
ability unless it's extremely of cases
clinical dissociations right when people

2370
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:45,640
clinical dissociations right when people
 

2371
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,999
clinical dissociations right when people
are heavily abused when they completely

2372
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:48,009
are heavily abused when they completely
 

2373
00:44:48,009 --> 00:44:50,130
are heavily abused when they completely
repress them they the memory but that

2374
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:50,140
repress them they the memory but that
 

2375
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:52,259
repress them they the memory but that
doesn't happen in in in you know in

2376
00:44:52,259 --> 00:44:52,269
doesn't happen in in in you know in
 

2377
00:44:52,269 --> 00:44:54,180
doesn't happen in in in you know in
normal people if we don't have an

2378
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:54,190
normal people if we don't have an
 

2379
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:57,180
normal people if we don't have an
ability to remove traumatic memories and

2380
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:57,190
ability to remove traumatic memories and
 

2381
00:44:57,190 --> 00:44:59,160
ability to remove traumatic memories and
of course we suffer from that on the

2382
00:44:59,160 --> 00:44:59,170
of course we suffer from that on the
 

2383
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:01,229
of course we suffer from that on the
other hand probably if you had the

2384
00:45:01,229 --> 00:45:01,239
other hand probably if you had the
 

2385
00:45:01,239 --> 00:45:02,969
other hand probably if you had the
ability to constantly wipe your memory

2386
00:45:02,969 --> 00:45:02,979
ability to constantly wipe your memory
 

2387
00:45:02,979 --> 00:45:05,489
ability to constantly wipe your memory
you probably do it to an extent that

2388
00:45:05,489 --> 00:45:05,499
you probably do it to an extent that
 

2389
00:45:05,499 --> 00:45:06,989
you probably do it to an extent that
isn't useful to you

2390
00:45:06,989 --> 00:45:06,999
isn't useful to you
 

2391
00:45:06,999 --> 00:45:10,440
isn't useful to you
so yeah it's a good question with the

2392
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:10,450
so yeah it's a good question with the
 

2393
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:13,109
so yeah it's a good question with the
balance so on the books is Jack

2394
00:45:13,109 --> 00:45:13,119
balance so on the books is Jack
 

2395
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:16,160
balance so on the books is Jack
mentioned correct me if I'm wrong but

2396
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:16,170
mentioned correct me if I'm wrong but
 

2397
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:19,049
mentioned correct me if I'm wrong but
broadly speaking in academia and the

2398
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:19,059
broadly speaking in academia and the
 

2399
00:45:19,059 --> 00:45:20,309
broadly speaking in academia and the
different scientific disciplines

2400
00:45:20,309 --> 00:45:20,319
different scientific disciplines
 

2401
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:22,380
different scientific disciplines
certainly an engineering reading

2402
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:22,390
certainly an engineering reading
 

2403
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:25,640

literature seems to be a rare pursuit

00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:25,650
literature seems to be a rare pursuit
 

2405
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:27,630

perhaps I'm wrong in this but that's in

00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:27,640
perhaps I'm wrong in this but that's in
 

2407
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,849
perhaps I'm wrong in this but that's in
my experience most people are read much

2408
00:45:29,849 --> 00:45:29,859
my experience most people are read much
 

2409
00:45:29,859 --> 00:45:32,190
my experience most people are read much
more technical text and do not sort of

more technical text and do not sort of
 

2411
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:36,749

00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:39,130
seems like you do so what do you think
 

2415
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:40,529
seems like you do so what do you think
is the value what do you think

literature asks the pursuit of

2418
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:42,369
literature asks the pursuit of
 

2419
00:45:42,369 --> 00:45:45,209
literature asks the pursuit of
scientific truth do you think it's good

00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:45,219
scientific truth do you think it's good

it's useful for given access to much

00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:48,400
it's useful for given access to much
 

2423
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,589
it's useful for given access to much
wider array of human experiences how

2424
00:45:52,589 --> 00:45:52,599
wider array of human experiences how
 

2425
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:54,539
wider array of human experiences how
valuable do you think it is well if you

2426
00:45:54,539 --> 00:45:54,549
valuable do you think it is well if you
 

2427
00:45:54,549 --> 00:45:56,969
valuable do you think it is well if you
want to understand human nature and

2428
00:45:56,969 --> 00:45:56,979
want to understand human nature and
 

2429
00:45:56,979 --> 00:45:58,410
want to understand human nature and
nature in general then I think you have

2430
00:45:58,410 --> 00:45:58,420
nature in general then I think you have
 

2431
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:01,529
nature in general then I think you have
to better understand wide variety of

I used to do that for most psychologists

2442
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:10,450
I used to do that for most psychologists
 

2443
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:11,969
I used to do that for most psychologists
do there's nothing wrong with that but

2444
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:11,979
do there's nothing wrong with that but
 

2445
00:46:11,979 --> 00:46:13,890
do there's nothing wrong with that but
you need to consider lots of other

2446
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:13,900
you need to consider lots of other
 

2447
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:17,309
you need to consider lots of other

strange states you know and literature
 

2449
00:46:17,319 --> 00:46:19,410

00:46:32,799 --> 00:46:34,289
different and you know the one way to
explain that is reading all these

2466
00:46:34,289 --> 00:46:34,299
explain that is reading all these
 

2467

00:46:38,279 --> 00:46:38,289
you you see everything so relative

you you see everything so relative
read eBooks million years ago they

2472
00:46:39,419 --> 00:46:39,429
read eBooks million years ago they
 

2473
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:41,099
read eBooks million years ago they
thought about certain problems very very

2474
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:41,109
thought about certain problems very very
 

2475
00:46:41,109 --> 00:46:43,890
thought about certain problems very very
differently than us today we today like

00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:43,900
differently than us today we today like
 

2477
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:46,079
differently than us today we today like
any culture think we know it all that's

2478
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:46,089
any culture think we know it all that's
 

2479
00:46:46,089 --> 00:46:47,789
any culture think we know it all that's
common to every culture every culture

00:46:49,509 --> 00:46:51,179
believes that at a day they know it all
and then you realize well there's other

2484
00:46:51,179 --> 00:46:51,189
and then you realize well there's other
 

2485
00:46:51,189 --> 00:46:53,189
and then you realize well there's other
ways of viewing the universe and some of

2486
00:46:53,189 --> 00:46:53,199
ways of viewing the universe and some of
 

2487
00:46:53,199 --> 00:46:55,019
ways of viewing the universe and some of
them may have lots of things in their

2488
00:46:55,019 --> 00:46:55,029
them may have lots of things in their
 

2489
00:46:55,029 --> 00:46:58,049
them may have lots of things in their
favor so I this is a question I wanted

2490
00:46:58,049 --> 00:46:58,059
favor so I this is a question I wanted
 

2491
00:46:58,059 --> 00:47:00,809
favor so I this is a question I wanted
to ask about time scale or scale in

2492
00:47:00,809 --> 00:47:00,819
to ask about time scale or scale in

try to think about consciousness try to
 

2497
00:47:06,549 --> 00:47:09,299
try to think about consciousness try to
think about these ideas we kind of

2498
00:47:09,299 --> 00:47:09,309
think about these ideas we kind of
 

2499
00:47:09,309 --> 00:47:11,479
think about these ideas we kind of
naturally think in human timescales

2500
00:47:11,479 --> 00:47:11,489
naturally think in human timescales
 

2501
00:47:11,489 --> 00:47:16,620
naturally think in human timescales
do you or and also entities that are

2502
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:16,630
do you or and also entities that are
 

2503
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:19,499
do you or and also entities that are
sized close to humans do you think of

2504
00:47:19,499 --> 00:47:19,509
sized close to humans do you think of
 

2505
00:47:19,509 --> 00:47:21,120
sized close to humans do you think of
things that are much larger much smaller

2506
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:21,130
things that are much larger much smaller
 

2507

its containing consciousness and do you

2508
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:22,749
its containing consciousness and do you
 

2509
00:47:22,749 --> 00:47:26,219
its containing consciousness and do you
think of things that take you know well

2510
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:26,229
think of things that take you know well
 

2511
00:47:26,229 --> 00:47:30,569

00:47:30,579 --> 00:47:33,109
is this you know it ages eons to uh to
operate in their conscious cause effect

2514
00:47:33,109 --> 00:47:33,119
operate in their conscious cause effect
 

2515
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,489
operate in their conscious cause effect
cause effect it's a very good question

2516
00:47:35,489 --> 00:47:35,499
cause effect it's a very good question
 

2517
00:47:35,499 --> 00:47:37,079
cause effect it's a very good question
so I think a lot about small creatures

2518
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:37,089
so I think a lot about small creatures
 

2519
00:47:37,089 --> 00:47:38,669
so I think a lot about small creatures
because experimentally you know a lot of

2520
00:47:38,669 --> 00:47:38,679
because experimentally you know a lot of
 

2521
00:47:38,679 --> 00:47:41,219
because experimentally you know a lot of
people work on fly then and bees alright

2522
00:47:41,219 --> 00:47:41,229
people work on fly then and bees alright
 

2523
00:47:41,229 --> 00:47:43,019
people work on fly then and bees alright
so and most people just think they are

2524
00:47:43,019 --> 00:47:43,029
so and most people just think they are
 

2525
00:47:43,029 --> 00:47:44,759
so and most people just think they are
tormented a this box for heaven's sake

2526
00:47:44,759 --> 00:47:44,769
tormented a this box for heaven's sake
 

2527
00:47:44,769 --> 00:47:46,169
tormented a this box for heaven's sake
right but if you look at their behavior

2528
00:47:46,169 --> 00:47:46,179
right but if you look at their behavior
 

2529
00:47:46,179 --> 00:47:48,149
right but if you look at their behavior
like bees they can recognize individual

2530
00:47:48,149 --> 00:47:48,159
like bees they can recognize individual
 

2531
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:50,269
like bees they can recognize individual
humans they have this very complicated

2532
00:47:50,269 --> 00:47:50,279
humans they have this very complicated
 

2533
00:47:50,279 --> 00:47:53,099
humans they have this very complicated
way to communicate if you've ever been

2534
00:47:53,099 --> 00:47:53,109
way to communicate if you've ever been
 

2535
00:47:53,109 --> 00:47:54,569
way to communicate if you've ever been
involved or you know your parents when

2536
00:47:54,569 --> 00:47:54,579
involved or you know your parents when
 

2537
00:47:54,579 --> 00:47:55,829

agonizing decision that is and bees have

2540
00:47:58,319 --> 00:47:58,329

2541
00:47:58,329 --> 00:48:00,179
agonizing decision that is and bees have
to do that once a year right when they

2542
00:48:00,179 --> 00:48:00,189
to do that once a year right when they
 

2543
00:48:00,189 --> 00:48:01,829

Tom so we just don't know how to talk to

2752
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:36,700
Tom so we just don't know how to talk to
 

2753
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:38,520
Tom so we just don't know how to talk to
them so it's the language the

2754
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:38,530
them so it's the language the
 

2755
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:40,080
them so it's the language the
communication because you don't know

2756
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:40,090
communication because you don't know
 

2757
00:51:40,090 --> 00:51:42,750
communication because you don't know
what to do with it so that's one sort of

2758
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:42,760
what to do with it so that's one sort of
 

2759
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:45,270
what to do with it so that's one sort of
view is consciousness there's only

2760
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:45,280
view is consciousness there's only
 

2761
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,000
view is consciousness there's only
something you can measure so it's not

2762
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:48,010
something you can measure so it's not
 

2763
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:50,220
something you can measure so it's not
conscious if you can't measure it but so

2764
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:50,230
conscious if you can't measure it but so
 

2765
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:51,960
conscious if you can't measure it but so
you're making an ontological and an

2766
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:51,970
you're making an ontological and an
 

2767
00:51:51,970 --> 00:51:54,120
you're making an ontological and an
epistemic statement one is there they

2768
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:54,130
epistemic statement one is there they
 

2769
00:51:54,130 --> 00:51:56,250
epistemic statement one is there they
are it's it's just like seeing their

2770
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:56,260
are it's it's just like seeing their
 

2771
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:58,440
are it's it's just like seeing their
multiverses that might be true but I

2772
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:58,450
multiverses that might be true but I
 

2773
00:51:58,450 --> 00:52:00,150
multiverses that might be true but I
can't communicate with them I don't have

2774
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:00,160
can't communicate with them I don't have
 

2775
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,770
can't communicate with them I don't have
I can't have any also that's an

2776
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:01,780
I can't have any also that's an
 

2777
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:03,720
I can't have any also that's an
epistemic argument right so those are

2778
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:03,730
epistemic argument right so those are
 

2779
00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:04,920
epistemic argument right so those are
two different things so may well be

2780
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:04,930
two different things so may well be
 

2781
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:06,780
two different things so may well be
possible look at not in other case

2782
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:06,790
possible look at not in other case
 

2783
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:07,920
possible look at not in other case
that's happening right now people are

2784
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:07,930
that's happening right now people are
 

2785
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:09,390
that's happening right now people are
building these mini organoids

2786
00:52:09,390 --> 00:52:09,400
building these mini organoids
 

2787
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,280
building these mini organoids
do you know about this so you know you

2788
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:11,290
do you know about this so you know you
 

2789
00:52:11,290 --> 00:52:12,870
do you know about this so you know you
can take stem cells from under your arm

2790
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:12,880
can take stem cells from under your arm
 

2791
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,400
can take stem cells from under your arm
put in one dish add four transcription

2792
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:14,410
put in one dish add four transcription
 

2793
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:16,200
put in one dish add four transcription
factors and then you can induce them to

2794
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:16,210
factors and then you can induce them to
 

2795
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:19,140
factors and then you can induce them to
code to go into large or large they're a

00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:19,150
code to go into large or large they're a
 

2797
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:20,550
code to go into large or large they're a
few millimeters they're like a half a

00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:26,470
at Howard at Stanford everywhere they're
 

2805
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:28,380
at Howard at Stanford everywhere they're
building them it may be well be possible

2806
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:28,390
building them it may be well be possible
 

2807
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:29,790
building them it may be well be possible
that they're beginning to feel like

2808
00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:29,800
that they're beginning to feel like
 

2809
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,950
that they're beginning to feel like
something but we we can't really

2810
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:31,960
something but we we can't really
 

2811
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,570
something but we we can't really
communicate with them right now so

2812
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:33,580
communicate with them right now so
 

2813
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:34,950
communicate with them right now so
people are beginning to think about the

2814
00:52:34,950 --> 00:52:34,960
people are beginning to think about the
 

2815
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,109
people are beginning to think about the
ethics of this right so yes he may be

2816
00:52:37,109 --> 00:52:37,119
ethics of this right so yes he may be
 

2817
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:40,290
ethics of this right so yes he may be
perfectly right but they made its one

2818
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:40,300
perfectly right but they made its one
 

2819
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:41,910
perfectly right but they made its one
question are they conscious or not it's

2820
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:41,920
question are they conscious or not it's
 

2821
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,320
question are they conscious or not it's
totally separate question how would I

2822
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:43,330
totally separate question how would I
 

2823
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:44,640
totally separate question how would I
know those are two different things

2824
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:44,650
know those are two different things
 

2825
00:52:44,650 --> 00:52:48,300
know those are two different things
right if you could give advice to a

doesn't have this easy understanding
that you have right so so some people

2916
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:30,480
that you have right so so some people
 

2917
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,970
that you have right so so some people
make yeah I mean in order to go to the

2918
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:31,980
make yeah I mean in order to go to the
 

2919
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:33,170
make yeah I mean in order to go to the
next step or you really want to build

2920
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:33,180
next step or you really want to build
 

2921
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:34,880

and I we have to go to psychology we

2924
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:37,140
and I we have to go to psychology we
 

2925
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:38,599
and I we have to go to psychology we
need to understand how we do it and our

2926
00:54:38,599 --> 00:54:38,609
need to understand how we do it and our
 

2927
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:40,550
need to understand how we do it and our
brains enable us to do it and so

2928
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:40,560
brains enable us to do it and so
 

2929
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:42,650
brains enable us to do it and so
therefore being on the cusp it's also so

2930
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:42,660
therefore being on the cusp it's also so
 

2931
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:44,720
therefore being on the cusp it's also so
exciting I'd to try to understand better

2932
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:44,730
exciting I'd to try to understand better
 

2933
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:47,300
exciting I'd to try to understand better
our nature and then to build to take

2934
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:47,310
our nature and then to build to take
 

2935
00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:48,859
our nature and then to build to take
some of those inside and build them so I

2936
00:54:48,859 --> 00:54:48,869
some of those inside and build them so I
 

2937
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:50,000
some of those inside and build them so I
think the most exciting thing is

2938
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:50,010
think the most exciting thing is
 

2939
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:51,470

3035
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,810

3043
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:44,120
input from all of them and it projects
back to all of them and so we are
