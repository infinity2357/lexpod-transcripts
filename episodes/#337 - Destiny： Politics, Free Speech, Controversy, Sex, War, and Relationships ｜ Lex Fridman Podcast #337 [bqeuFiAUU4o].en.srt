00:03:45,649 --> 00:03:45,659
flavor of thinking about
 

201
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,750
flavor of thinking about
like The Meta conversation trying to

202
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:47,760
like The Meta conversation trying to
 

203
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,149
like The Meta conversation trying to
optimize how should this conversation go

204
00:03:50,149 --> 00:03:50,159
optimize how should this conversation go
 

205
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,690
optimize how should this conversation go
because I feel like the more you do that

206
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:53,700
because I feel like the more you do that
 

207
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,550
because I feel like the more you do that
the better you get at that

208
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:55,560
the better you get at that
 

209
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,070
the better you get at that
the less human connection you have like

210
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,080
the less human connection you have like
 

211
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,570
the less human connection you have like
the less genuinely you're actually

212
00:03:59,570 --> 00:03:59,580
the less genuinely you're actually
 

213
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,649
the less genuinely you're actually
sitting there in the moment and

214
00:04:00,649 --> 00:04:00,659
sitting there in the moment and
 

215
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:02,449
sitting there in the moment and
listening to the person you're more like

216
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:02,459
listening to the person you're more like
 

217
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:03,949
listening to the person you're more like
calculating what's the right thing to

218
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:03,959
calculating what's the right thing to
 

219
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:07,070
calculating what's the right thing to
say versus like feeling what is uh what

220
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:07,080
say versus like feeling what is uh what
 

221
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,449
say versus like feeling what is uh what
is that person feeling right now what

222
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:08,459
is that person feeling right now what
 

223
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:09,949
is that person feeling right now what
are they thinking that's what I'm trying

224
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:09,959
are they thinking that's what I'm trying
 

225
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,710
are they thinking that's what I'm trying
to do is like putting myself in their

226
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:12,720
to do is like putting myself in their
 

227
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,449
to do is like putting myself in their
mind and thinking what does the world

228
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:14,459
mind and thinking what does the world
 

229
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:16,310
mind and thinking what does the world
look like to them what does the world

230
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:16,320
look like to them what does the world
 

231
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,550
look like to them what does the world
feel like to them and so from that I

232
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:19,560
feel like to them and so from that I
 

233
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,289
feel like to them and so from that I
truly try to listen now I'm also

234
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:21,299
truly try to listen now I'm also
 

235

learning
 

237
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,590
learning
especially because Rogan and others have

238
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:24,600
especially because Rogan and others have
 

239
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,290
especially because Rogan and others have
been giving me [\h__\h] for not pushing back

240
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:26,300
been giving me [\h__\h] for not pushing back
 

241
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,330
been giving me [\h__\h] for not pushing back
it's good sometimes to say

242
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:29,340
it's good sometimes to say
 

243
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,210
it's good sometimes to say
from a place of care for the other human

244
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:32,220
from a place of care for the other human
 

245
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,550
from a place of care for the other human
being to say stop

246
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:34,560
being to say stop
 

247
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,830
being to say stop
what did you just say I don't think

248
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:36,840
what did you just say I don't think
 

249
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,830
what did you just say I don't think
that's represents who you are and what

250
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:39,840
that's represents who you are and what
 

251
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,230
that's represents who you are and what
you really mean or maybe

252
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:42,240
you really mean or maybe
 

253
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,150
you really mean or maybe
if it does at that time represents who

254
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:44,160
if it does at that time represents who
 

255
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,290
if it does at that time represents who
they are

256
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:45,300
they are
 

257
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,450
they are
I could see a better

258
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:47,460
I could see a better
 

259
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,670
I could see a better
a better world if they grow into a

260
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:49,680
a better world if they grow into a
 

261
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,689
a better world if they grow into a
different direction and try to point

262
00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:50,699
different direction and try to point
 

263
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:52,730
different direction and try to point
that direction out to them it was a

264
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:52,740
that direction out to them it was a
 

265
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,770
that direction out to them it was a
really complicated dance between letting

266
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:54,780
really complicated dance between letting
 

267
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,930
really complicated dance between letting
somebody share their full story versus

268
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:56,940
somebody share their full story versus
 

269
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,850
somebody share their full story versus
letting somebody like essentially I

270
00:04:58,850 --> 00:04:58,860
letting somebody like essentially I
 

271
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,770
letting somebody like essentially I
guess like proselytize your audience and

272
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:00,780
guess like proselytize your audience and
 

273
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,450
guess like proselytize your audience and
it's like okay hold on let's take a

274
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:02,460
it's like okay hold on let's take a
 

275
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,090
it's like okay hold on let's take a
minute here but yeah I used to be four

276
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:05,100
minute here but yeah I used to be four
 

277
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,129
minute here but yeah I used to be four
or five years ago it was attack attack

278
00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:07,139
or five years ago it was attack attack
 

279
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:08,870
or five years ago it was attack attack
attack attack attack whatever you said

280
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:08,880
attack attack attack whatever you said
 

281
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,730
attack attack attack whatever you said
and now I'm leaning way more towards

282
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:10,740
and now I'm leaning way more towards
 

283
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,110
and now I'm leaning way more towards
though like okay well tell me how you

284
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:12,120
though like okay well tell me how you
 

285
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,129
though like okay well tell me how you
feel about everything and then we'll go

286
00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:13,139
feel about everything and then we'll go
 

287
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:14,870
feel about everything and then we'll go
from there so a lot of people like my

288
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:14,880
from there so a lot of people like my
 

289
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,550
from there so a lot of people like my
new approach some older fans will watch

290
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:16,560
new approach some older fans will watch
 

291
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,390
new approach some older fans will watch
and they're like why are you letting

292
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:17,400
and they're like why are you letting
 

293
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,710
and they're like why are you letting
this guy just Ramble On you know he said

294
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:18,720
this guy just Ramble On you know he said
 

295
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,270
this guy just Ramble On you know he said
like five or six wrong things and you're

296
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:20,280
like five or six wrong things and you're
 

297
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,409
like five or six wrong things and you're
only gonna call them out on two of them

298
00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:21,419
only gonna call them out on two of them
 

299
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:23,330
only gonna call them out on two of them
and it's like it's different styles of

300
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:23,340
and it's like it's different styles of
 

301
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,710
and it's like it's different styles of
conversation but you know do you do a

302
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:24,720
conversation but you know do you do a
 

303
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,749
conversation but you know do you do a
lot of research beforehand too depending

304
00:05:26,749 --> 00:05:26,759
lot of research beforehand too depending
 

305
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,010
lot of research beforehand too depending
on the conversation yeah so if we're

306
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:28,020
on the conversation yeah so if we're
 

307
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,210
on the conversation yeah so if we're
going to talk like vaccines and stuff

308
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:29,220
going to talk like vaccines and stuff
 

309
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,010
going to talk like vaccines and stuff
yeah that's a ton of reading and stuff

310
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:31,020
yeah that's a ton of reading and stuff
 

311
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,930
yeah that's a ton of reading and stuff
that I never thought I'd know going into

312
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:32,940
that I never thought I'd know going into
 

313
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,790
that I never thought I'd know going into
it um if it's a more personal like

314
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:34,800
it um if it's a more personal like
 

315
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,170
it um if it's a more personal like
political philosophy conversation

316
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:36,180
political philosophy conversation
 

317
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,370
political philosophy conversation
there's not as much you can prepare for

318
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:37,380
there's not as much you can prepare for
 

319
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,689
there's not as much you can prepare for
just it truly depends on the

320
00:05:38,689 --> 00:05:38,699
just it truly depends on the
 

321
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:40,310
just it truly depends on the
conversation how much are you actually

because of the thing let's lay out one

404
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:54,900
because of the thing let's lay out one
 

405
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,350
because of the thing let's lay out one
two three and every time you try to lay

406
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:57,360
two three and every time you try to lay
 

407
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,110
two three and every time you try to lay
it out it would falter I think it had to

408
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:00,120
it out it would falter I think it had to
 

409
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,689
it out it would falter I think it had to
do with sort of can you use data to make

410
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:02,699
do with sort of can you use data to make
 

411
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:04,730
do with sort of can you use data to make
an argument or do you need to use a

412
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:04,740
an argument or do you need to use a
 

413
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,409
an argument or do you need to use a
study that does an interpretation of

414
00:07:06,409 --> 00:07:06,419
study that does an interpretation of
 

415
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:08,330
study that does an interpretation of
that data and then there's like this

416
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:08,340
that data and then there's like this
 

417
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,189
that data and then there's like this
tension between I think this is a

418
00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:10,199
tension between I think this is a
 

419
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,510
tension between I think this is a
behavioral Economist that you were

420
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:11,520
behavioral Economist that you were
 

421
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,790
behavioral Economist that you were
talking to and the point is you do this

422
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:13,800
talking to and the point is you do this
 

423
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,590
talking to and the point is you do this
kind of nice layout that the whole point

424
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:15,600
kind of nice layout that the whole point
 

425
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,050
kind of nice layout that the whole point
of Behavioral economics is says there's

426
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:18,060
of Behavioral economics is says there's
 

427
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,550
of Behavioral economics is says there's
more to it than just the data you have

428
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:19,560
more to it than just the data you have
 

429
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,189
more to it than just the data you have
to give the context and like do the rich

430
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:22,199
to give the context and like do the rich
 

431
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,469
to give the context and like do the rich
rigorous interpretation in the context

432
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:24,479
rigorous interpretation in the context
 

433
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,749
rigorous interpretation in the context
of the full human story and then there

434
00:07:26,749 --> 00:07:26,759
of the full human story and then there
 

435
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:27,890
of the full human story and then there
was like a dance back and forth

436
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:27,900
was like a dance back and forth
 

437
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,570
was like a dance back and forth
sometimes use data sometimes not and

438
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:29,580
sometimes use data sometimes not and
 

439
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,490
sometimes use data sometimes not and
you're getting really frustrated and

440
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:31,500
you're getting really frustrated and
 

441
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,710
you're getting really frustrated and
shutting down and so that felt like a

442
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:33,720
shutting down and so that felt like a
 

443
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,170
shutting down and so that felt like a
failure mode I've seen Sam Harris have

444
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:36,180
failure mode I've seen Sam Harris have
 

445
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,150
failure mode I've seen Sam Harris have
similar sticking points like if we can't

446
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:38,160
similar sticking points like if we can't
 

447
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,430
similar sticking points like if we can't
agree on the terminology we can't go on

448
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:40,440
agree on the terminology we can't go on
 

449
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:45,170
agree on the terminology we can't go on
to me I feel like uh I'm just sort of

450
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:45,180
to me I feel like uh I'm just sort of
 

451
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,890
to me I feel like uh I'm just sort of
the the winkenstein perspective is like

452
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:48,900
the the winkenstein perspective is like
 

453
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,110
the the winkenstein perspective is like
I think if you get stuck on any one

454
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,120
I think if you get stuck on any one
 

455
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,129
I think if you get stuck on any one
thing you're just not going to make

456
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:52,139
thing you're just not going to make
 

457
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,689

progress you have to
 

459
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:56,570
progress you have to
part of the conversation has to be

460
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:56,580
part of the conversation has to be
 

461
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,010
part of the conversation has to be
about

462
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:58,020
about
 

463
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,790
about
uh doing a good dance together

464
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:00,800
uh doing a good dance together

versus being dogmatically stuck on the

466
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:04,560
versus being dogmatically stuck on the
 

467
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,189
versus being dogmatically stuck on the
path to truth I think the true challenge

468
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:07,199
path to truth I think the true challenge
 

469
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,529
path to truth I think the true challenge
is identifying what of those sticking

470
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:09,539
is identifying what of those sticking
 

471
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:13,730
is identifying what of those sticking
points are important versus what is not

472
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:13,740
points are important versus what is not
 

473
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,589
points are important versus what is not
important it's like if I'm having an

474
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:15,599
important it's like if I'm having an
 

475
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,390
important it's like if I'm having an

representation and media they might it
 

479
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,350
representation and media they might it
might be like a big conversation and

480
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:21,360
might be like a big conversation and
 

481
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,330

for hour two three four hours of stuff
 

1117
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,470
for hour two three four hours of stuff
and then by the end you know someone in

1118
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:15,480
and then by the end you know someone in
 

1119

1123
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:20,750
remember like this this particular thing
and I'll say not really no not too much

1124
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:20,760
and I'll say not really no not too much
 

1125

but what happens is as long as you've
 

1127
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,110
but what happens is as long as you've
seen it once what will happen is like

1128
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:24,120
seen it once what will happen is like
 

1129
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,610
seen it once what will happen is like
the next day the day after we'll read

1130
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:25,620
the next day the day after we'll read
 

1131
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,409
the next day the day after we'll read
something else and we're like oh I

1132
00:18:27,409 --> 00:18:27,419
something else and we're like oh I
 

1133
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:29,090
something else and we're like oh I
remember that thing from this thing I

1134
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:29,100
remember that thing from this thing I
 

1135
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,470
remember that thing from this thing I
remember like vaguely that and then if

1136
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:30,480
remember like vaguely that and then if
 

1137
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,610
remember like vaguely that and then if
you see it like a third time you're like

1138
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:31,620
you see it like a third time you're like
 

1139
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,070
you see it like a third time you're like
oh this makes sense because especially

1140
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:34,080
oh this makes sense because especially
 

1141
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,110
oh this makes sense because especially
when it comes to oh here's like a little

1142
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:36,120
when it comes to oh here's like a little
 

1143
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,029
when it comes to oh here's like a little
trick on stuff if you're ever reading

1144
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:38,039
trick on stuff if you're ever reading
 

1145
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:40,370
trick on stuff if you're ever reading
any news and there's a place that pops

1146
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:40,380
any news and there's a place that pops
 

1147
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,529
any news and there's a place that pops
up always look at it on a map because so

1148
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:42,539
up always look at it on a map because so
 

1149
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,810
up always look at it on a map because so
much of history is like on a map it's so

1150
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:44,820
much of history is like on a map it's so
 

1151
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,130
much of history is like on a map it's so
important to like know the geography it

1152
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:46,140
important to like know the geography it
 

1153
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,350
important to like know the geography it
makes things make so much more sense

1154
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:48,360
makes things make so much more sense
 

1155
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,029
makes things make so much more sense
um but yeah once I once I start to see

1156
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:50,039
um but yeah once I once I start to see
 

1157
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:51,409
um but yeah once I once I start to see
stuff over and over again just because

1158
00:18:51,409 --> 00:18:51,419
stuff over and over again just because
 

1159
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:53,210
stuff over and over again just because
I've like read it a few times stuff will

1160
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:53,220
I've like read it a few times stuff will
 

1161
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,529
I've like read it a few times stuff will
start to kind of connect to my mind and

1162
00:18:54,529 --> 00:18:54,539
start to kind of connect to my mind and
 

1163
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:55,789
start to kind of connect to my mind and
like oh yeah well this makes sense of

1164
00:18:55,789 --> 00:18:55,799
like oh yeah well this makes sense of
 

1165
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:57,350
like oh yeah well this makes sense of
course these people believe this because

1166
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:57,360
course these people believe this because
 

1167
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,850
course these people believe this because
of this or of course like this happen

1168
00:18:58,850 --> 00:18:58,860
of this or of course like this happen
 

1169
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,110
of this or of course like this happen
here it's because you know that happened

1170
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:00,120
here it's because you know that happened
 

1171
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,130
here it's because you know that happened
there

1172
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:01,140
there
 

1173
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,570
there
um so yeah it's a lot of that if there's

1174
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:02,580
um so yeah it's a lot of that if there's
 

1175
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,370
um so yeah it's a lot of that if there's
like a topic that I'm doing specific

1176
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:04,380
like a topic that I'm doing specific
 

1177
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,750
like a topic that I'm doing specific
research for

1178
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:05,760
research for
 

1179
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,730
research for
um so like vaccine related stuff is a

1180
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:07,740
um so like vaccine related stuff is a

big one the Ukrainian Russian conflict
is a big one that I'll break out a note

1184
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:11,880
is a big one that I'll break out a note
 

1185
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,310
is a big one that I'll break out a note
um I'll probably get like a Google doc

1186
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:13,320
um I'll probably get like a Google doc
 

1187
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,570
um I'll probably get like a Google doc
and I'll just start like writing like an

1188
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:14,580
and I'll just start like writing like an
 

1189
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,310
and I'll just start like writing like an
outline of kind of the rough points of

1190
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:16,320
outline of kind of the rough points of
 

1191
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,570
outline of kind of the rough points of
everything just to organize is my

1192
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:17,580
everything just to organize is my
 

1193
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,710
everything just to organize is my
thoughts around different topics yeah

1194
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:18,720
thoughts around different topics yeah
 

1195
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,570
thoughts around different topics yeah

it's like well there might have been
 

1255
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,409
it's like well there might have been
steps you could have taken to mitigate

1256
00:20:21,409 --> 00:20:21,419
steps you could have taken to mitigate
 

1257
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:23,750
steps you could have taken to mitigate
the risk it's not her fault of what

1258

the risk it's not her fault of what
 

1259
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,730
the risk it's not her fault of what
happened because the responsibility

1260
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:25,740
happened because the responsibility
 

1261
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,010
happened because the responsibility
rests on the on the agent making the

choice right there's a Chooser at some
 

1265
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,730
choice right there's a Chooser at some
point that is choosing to do wrong or

1266
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:31,740
point that is choosing to do wrong or
 

1267
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,630
point that is choosing to do wrong or
evil

1268
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:32,640
evil
 

1269
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,270
evil
I don't believe in any of the arguments

1270
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:35,280
I don't believe in any of the arguments
 

1271
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,590
I don't believe in any of the arguments
that say the United States has

1272
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:36,600
that say the United States has
 

1273
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,690
that say the United States has
contributed to Russia's position on

1274
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:38,700
contributed to Russia's position on
 

1275
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,490
contributed to Russia's position on
Ukraine or the actions they've taken on

1276
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:40,500
Ukraine or the actions they've taken on
 

1277
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,010
Ukraine or the actions they've taken on
Ukraine there are several arguments that

1278
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:43,020
Ukraine there are several arguments that
 

1279
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,950
Ukraine there are several arguments that
some people uh some even political

1280
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:45,960
some people uh some even political
 

1281
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,570
some people uh some even political
Scholars are are putting out there to

1282
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:47,580
Scholars are are putting out there to
 

1283
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,770
Scholars are are putting out there to
say that the United States is to blame

1284
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:48,780
say that the United States is to blame
 

1285
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,270
say that the United States is to blame
but I find them completely unconvincing

1286
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:50,280
but I find them completely unconvincing
 

1287
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,010
but I find them completely unconvincing
I think that when you ask the question

1288
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:52,020
I think that when you ask the question
 

1289
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,230
I think that when you ask the question
of like what is the United States role

1290
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:54,240
of like what is the United States role
 

1291
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,090
of like what is the United States role
or what has our role been I think it's

1292
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:56,100
or what has our role been I think it's
 

1293
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,409
or what has our role been I think it's
really important for us I don't think we

1294
00:20:57,409 --> 00:20:57,419
really important for us I don't think we
 

1295
00:20:57,419 --> 00:20:58,730
really important for us I don't think we
even agree as a country on what our role

1296
00:20:58,730 --> 00:20:58,740
even agree as a country on what our role
 

1297
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,990
even agree as a country on what our role
should be which I think is a hard one

1298
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:00,000
should be which I think is a hard one
 

1299
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,549
should be which I think is a hard one
because you've got this kind of there's

1300
00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:01,559
because you've got this kind of there's
 

1301
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,529
because you've got this kind of there's
this growing populist movement in the

1302
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:03,539
this growing populist movement in the
 

1303
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:05,150
this growing populist movement in the
United States it might be the far left

1304
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:05,160
United States it might be the far left
 

1305
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,770
United States it might be the far left
in the far right and I think populous

1306
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:06,780
in the far right and I think populous
 

1307
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,990
in the far right and I think populous
tend to have this kind of isolationist

1308
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:09,000
tend to have this kind of isolationist
 

1309
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,549
tend to have this kind of isolationist
view of the world where the United

1310
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:10,559
view of the world where the United
 

1311
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,110
view of the world where the United
States should just be our own thing we

1312
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:12,120
States should just be our own thing we
 

1313
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,909
States should just be our own thing we
shouldn't be telling anybody what to do

1314
00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:13,919
shouldn't be telling anybody what to do
 

1315
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,590
shouldn't be telling anybody what to do
we shouldn't be the World Police and

1316
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:15,600
we shouldn't be the World Police and
 

1317
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,789
we shouldn't be the World Police and
then kind of more in these like Center

1318
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:16,799
then kind of more in these like Center
 

1319
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,289
then kind of more in these like Center
left center right positions and then

1320
00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:18,299
left center right positions and then
 

1321
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:19,730
left center right positions and then
across a lot of Europe you've got well

1322
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:19,740
across a lot of Europe you've got well
 

1323
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,590
across a lot of Europe you've got well
okay the United States is kind of like

1324
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:21,600
okay the United States is kind of like
 

1325
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,330
okay the United States is kind of like
the big kid on the Block like we're

1326
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:23,340
the big kid on the Block like we're
 

1327
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,650
the big kid on the Block like we're
looking to them for guidance and

1328
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:24,660
looking to them for guidance and
 

1329
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,330
looking to them for guidance and
Leadership on situations like what's

1330
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:26,340
Leadership on situations like what's
 

1331
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:30,409
Leadership on situations like what's
going on in Ukraine so insofar as uh the

1332
00:21:30,409 --> 00:21:30,419
going on in Ukraine so insofar as uh the
 

1333
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:31,490
going on in Ukraine so insofar as uh the
original question is like what what is

1334
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:31,500
original question is like what what is
 

1335
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,169
original question is like what what is
like the United States responsibility I

1336
00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:33,179
like the United States responsibility I
 

1337
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:35,090
like the United States responsibility I
think we have a responsibility to ensure

1338
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:35,100
think we have a responsibility to ensure
 

1339
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,730
think we have a responsibility to ensure
the relative like Freedom prosperity and

1340
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:37,740
the relative like Freedom prosperity and
 

1341
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,710
the relative like Freedom prosperity and
stability across Europe I think that

1342
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:39,720
stability across Europe I think that
 

1343
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,570
stability across Europe I think that
defending Ukraine's sovereignty and

1344
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:41,580
defending Ukraine's sovereignty and
 

1345
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,190
defending Ukraine's sovereignty and
right to their borders is a part of that

1346
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:43,200
right to their borders is a part of that
 

1347
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,409
right to their borders is a part of that
and I don't believe that prior to the

1348
00:21:45,409 --> 00:21:45,419
and I don't believe that prior to the
 

1349
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:48,169
and I don't believe that prior to the
invasion in 2822 I don't think the

1350
00:21:48,169 --> 00:21:48,179
invasion in 2822 I don't think the
 

1351
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:50,450
invasion in 2822 I don't think the
United States was contributing to Russia

1352
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:50,460
United States was contributing to Russia
 

1353
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,970
United States was contributing to Russia
invading that country I know there are

1354
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:52,980
invading that country I know there are
 

1355
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,230
invading that country I know there are
arguments given that like the expansion

1356
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:54,240
arguments given that like the expansion
 

1357
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,390
arguments given that like the expansion
of NATO you know has something that's

1358
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:56,400
of NATO you know has something that's
 

1359
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,010
of NATO you know has something that's
been threatening to Russia but the

1360
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:58,020
been threatening to Russia but the
 

1361
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,810
been threatening to Russia but the
baltics joined and Russia didn't do

1362
00:21:59,810 --> 00:21:59,820
baltics joined and Russia didn't do
 

1363
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,789
baltics joined and Russia didn't do
anything about it the invasion to Crimea

1364
00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:01,799
anything about it the invasion to Crimea
 

1365
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:03,230
anything about it the invasion to Crimea
was very clearly a response to the

1366
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:03,240
was very clearly a response to the
 

1367
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,810
was very clearly a response to the
revolution in 2014 The Invasion on the

1368
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:05,820
revolution in 2014 The Invasion on the
 

1369
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,570
revolution in 2014 The Invasion on the
borders is clearly a response to Ukraine

1370
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:08,580
borders is clearly a response to Ukraine
 

1371
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,730
borders is clearly a response to Ukraine
winning that Civil War in the Southeast

1372
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:10,740
winning that Civil War in the Southeast
 

1373
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,770
winning that Civil War in the Southeast
and the donbos and Russia becoming more

1374
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:12,780
and the donbos and Russia becoming more
 

1375
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,850
and the donbos and Russia becoming more
aggressive I don't think that you can

1376
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:13,860
aggressive I don't think that you can
 

1377
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,710
aggressive I don't think that you can
blame any of that on on NATO expansion

1378
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:15,720
blame any of that on on NATO expansion
 

1379
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,909
blame any of that on on NATO expansion
there's no NATO countries that are

1380
00:22:16,909 --> 00:22:16,919
there's no NATO countries that are
 

1381
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:19,130
there's no NATO countries that are
threatening Russia orbiting Russia do

1382
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:19,140
threatening Russia orbiting Russia do
 

1383
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,070
threatening Russia orbiting Russia do
you think there is a nuclear threat

1384
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:22,080
you think there is a nuclear threat
 

1385
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,750
you think there is a nuclear threat
do you think about this do you worry

1386
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:23,760
do you think about this do you worry
 

1387
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,549
do you think about this do you worry
about this that there is a threat of a

1388
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:25,559
about this that there is a threat of a
 

1389
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:27,770
about this that there is a threat of a
tactical nuclear weapon being dropped I

1390
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:27,780
tactical nuclear weapon being dropped I
 

1391
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,149
tactical nuclear weapon being dropped I
think that possibility exists either way

1392
00:22:29,149 --> 00:22:29,159
think that possibility exists either way
 

1393
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:30,409
think that possibility exists either way
and I think the responsibility for that

1394
00:22:30,409 --> 00:22:30,419
and I think the responsibility for that
 

1395
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:32,930
and I think the responsibility for that
is on Russia because it can't it just

1396
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:32,940
is on Russia because it can't it just
 

1397
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,610
is on Russia because it can't it just
can't be the case that if you have nukes

1398
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:34,620
can't be the case that if you have nukes
 

1399
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,750
can't be the case that if you have nukes
you're allowed to invade countries and

1400
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:35,760
you're allowed to invade countries and
 

1401
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,430
you're allowed to invade countries and
take their land because of anything I

1402
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:37,440
take their land because of anything I
 

1403
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,990
take their land because of anything I
think that that down the road also

1404
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:39,000
think that that down the road also
 

1405
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,970
think that that down the road also
increased increases the potential for

1406
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:40,980
increased increases the potential for
 

1407
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,710
increased increases the potential for
nuclear problems in the future right

1408
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:42,720
nuclear problems in the future right
 

1409
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,450
nuclear problems in the future right
because at that point either every

1410
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:44,460
because at that point either every
 

1411
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,890
because at that point either every
single country has to acquire their own

1412
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:45,900
single country has to acquire their own
 

1413
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,090
single country has to acquire their own
nuclear weapons because if you don't

1414
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:47,100
nuclear weapons because if you don't
 

1415
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,890
nuclear weapons because if you don't
Russia is going to mess with you or

1416
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:48,900
Russia is going to mess with you or
 

1417
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,390
Russia is going to mess with you or
every single country has to join NATO

1418
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:50,400
every single country has to join NATO
 

1419
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,070
every single country has to join NATO
and now what we're back at square zero

1420
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:52,080
and now what we're back at square zero
 

1421
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,690
and now what we're back at square zero
Ground Zero square one where people like

1422
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:53,700
Ground Zero square one where people like
 

1423
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,890
Ground Zero square one where people like
oh well look all these countries joining

1424
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:54,900
oh well look all these countries joining
 

1425
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,210
oh well look all these countries joining
NATO is aggressive towards Russia like

1426

what are you gonna do

1428
00:22:57,529 --> 00:22:57,539
what are you gonna do
 

1429
00:22:57,539 --> 00:23:00,830
what are you gonna do
yeah you've mentioned that um there's a

1430
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:00,840
yeah you've mentioned that um there's a
 

1431
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,049
yeah you've mentioned that um there's a
complicated calculus going on with the

1432
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:03,059
complicated calculus going on with the
 

1433
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:05,390
complicated calculus going on with the
countries that have uh they have nuclear

1434
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:05,400
countries that have uh they have nuclear
 

1435
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,270
countries that have uh they have nuclear
weapons and what's our responsibility

1436
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:08,280
weapons and what's our responsibility
 

1437
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,010
weapons and what's our responsibility
are you allowed to do anything you want

1438
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:10,020
are you allowed to do anything you want
 

1439

are you allowed to do anything you want
to countries that don't have nuclear

1440
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:11,580
to countries that don't have nuclear

to countries that don't have nuclear
weapons

1442
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:12,960
weapons
 

1443
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,590
weapons
that's a really tricky discussion for

1444
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:15,600
that's a really tricky discussion for
 

1445
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,510
that's a really tricky discussion for
sure because what is UI supposed to do

1446
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:17,520
sure because what is UI supposed to do
 

1447
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,370
sure because what is UI supposed to do
if Russia drops a tactic when you grow

1448
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:19,380
if Russia drops a tactic when you grow
 

1449
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:23,090
if Russia drops a tactic when you grow
weapon there's a set of options

1450
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:23,100
weapon there's a set of options
 

1451
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,409
weapon there's a set of options
none of which are good and

1452
00:23:26,409 --> 00:23:26,419
none of which are good and
 

1453
00:23:26,419 --> 00:23:28,909
none of which are good and
it's such a tricky moment right now

1454
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:28,919
it's such a tricky moment right now
 

1455
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:33,049
it's such a tricky moment right now
because uh the things that Biden and

1456
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:33,059
because uh the things that Biden and
 

1457

00:23:37,789 --> 00:23:37,799
a significant impact on the way this
 

1461
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:39,230
a significant impact on the way this
game turns out because I think mutually

1462
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:39,240
game turns out because I think mutually
 

1463
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,710
game turns out because I think mutually
sure destruction is partially a game of

1464
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:42,720
sure destruction is partially a game of
 

1465
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,490
sure destruction is partially a game of
words now I mean I believe in the power

you have to have a balance between
 

1475
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,110

of um I don't know if you've ever heard

1492
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:17,100
of um I don't know if you've ever heard
 

1493
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,770
of um I don't know if you've ever heard
in like evolutionary psych Evolution or

1494
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:18,780
in like evolutionary psych Evolution or
 

1495
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,090
in like evolutionary psych Evolution or
biology there are things called Tit for

1496
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:20,100
biology there are things called Tit for
 

1497
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,250
biology there are things called Tit for
Tat strategies it kind of reminds me of

1498
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:22,260
Tat strategies it kind of reminds me of
 

1499
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,930
Tat strategies it kind of reminds me of
that where it's like if like uh there

1500
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:23,940
that where it's like if like uh there
 

1501
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:24,770
that where it's like if like uh there
are a whole bunch of these little

1502
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:24,780
are a whole bunch of these little
 

1503
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,270
are a whole bunch of these little
biological mechanisms where creatures

1504
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:26,280
biological mechanisms where creatures
 

1505
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,770
biological mechanisms where creatures
will develop like socializing like Tit

1506
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:27,780
will develop like socializing like Tit
 

1507
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,270
will develop like socializing like Tit
for Tat if you do something bad to me

1508
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:29,280
for Tat if you do something bad to me
 

1509
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,190
for Tat if you do something bad to me
I'm gonna do something bad for you and

1510
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:31,200
I'm gonna do something bad for you and
 

1511
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,750
I'm gonna do something bad for you and
then more complicated schemes will come

1512
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:32,760
then more complicated schemes will come
 

1513
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,149
then more complicated schemes will come
out where it'll be like tit tip for Tat

1514
00:24:35,149 --> 00:24:35,159
out where it'll be like tit tip for Tat
 

1515
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:36,770
out where it'll be like tit tip for Tat
or it's like you can make one mistake

1516
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:36,780
or it's like you can make one mistake
 

1517
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,090
or it's like you can make one mistake
and then I'm gonna get you if you do a

1518
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:38,100
and then I'm gonna get you if you do a
 

1519
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,830
and then I'm gonna get you if you do a
second one or could be Tit for Tat or

1520
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:39,840
second one or could be Tit for Tat or
 

1521
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,210
second one or could be Tit for Tat or
they're gonna be tit for a tat tat for

1522
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:41,220
they're gonna be tit for a tat tat for
 

1523
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,529
they're gonna be tit for a tat tat for
there's like all these like back and

1524
00:24:42,529 --> 00:24:42,539
there's like all these like back and
 

1525
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:44,330
there's like all these like back and
forths where creatures kind of optimize

1526
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:44,340
forths where creatures kind of optimize
 

1527
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,070
forths where creatures kind of optimize
themselves and

1528
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:46,080
themselves and
 

1529
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,510
themselves and
um yeah I think something the United

1530
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:47,520
um yeah I think something the United
 

1531
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,190
um yeah I think something the United
States did really well in terms of that

1532
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:49,200
States did really well in terms of that
 

1533
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,049
States did really well in terms of that
kind of conversational strategy and I

1534
00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:51,059
kind of conversational strategy and I
 

1535
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:52,549
kind of conversational strategy and I
approved of this in the beginning was

1536
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:52,559
approved of this in the beginning was
 

1537
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,529
approved of this in the beginning was
Biden was very clear about setting out

1538
00:24:54,529 --> 00:24:54,539
Biden was very clear about setting out
 

1539
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:56,510
Biden was very clear about setting out
like the exact level of U.S involvement

1540
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:56,520
like the exact level of U.S involvement
 

1541
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,370
like the exact level of U.S involvement
for the war we're not going to do a

1542
00:24:58,370 --> 00:24:58,380
for the war we're not going to do a
 

1543
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,870
for the war we're not going to do a
no-fly zone there's not going to be US

1544
00:24:59,870 --> 00:24:59,880
no-fly zone there's not going to be US
 

1545
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,430
no-fly zone there's not going to be US
troops on the ground in Ukraine but we

1546
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:01,440
troops on the ground in Ukraine but we
 

1547
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,630
troops on the ground in Ukraine but we
are going to send a whole bunch of money

1548
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:02,640
are going to send a whole bunch of money
 

1549
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,830
are going to send a whole bunch of money
and a whole bunch of arms and a whole

1550
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:03,840
and a whole bunch of arms and a whole
 

1551
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,450
and a whole bunch of arms and a whole
bunch of Intel to them and I thought he

1552
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:05,460
bunch of Intel to them and I thought he
 

1553
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,770
bunch of Intel to them and I thought he
did a good job at laying out like the

1554
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:06,780
did a good job at laying out like the
 

1555
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,510
did a good job at laying out like the
limitation of the OS involvement while

1556
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:08,520
limitation of the OS involvement while
 

1557
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,250
limitation of the OS involvement while
opening as much as we could in the ways

1558
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:10,260
opening as much as we could in the ways
 

1559
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,590
opening as much as we could in the ways
we could help but the um yeah that

1560
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:12,600
we could help but the um yeah that
 

1561
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,149
we could help but the um yeah that
looming threat of some sort of tactical

1562
00:25:14,149 --> 00:25:14,159
looming threat of some sort of tactical
 

1563
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,830
looming threat of some sort of tactical
nuclear weapon I think on the table

1564
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:15,840
nuclear weapon I think on the table
 

1565
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,149
nuclear weapon I think on the table
right now is like it's going to be the

1566
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:17,159
right now is like it's going to be the
 

1567
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:18,950
right now is like it's going to be the
annihilation of like Russian sea forces

1568
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:18,960
annihilation of like Russian sea forces
 

1569
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,990
annihilation of like Russian sea forces
and everything but you know what happens

1570
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:21,000
and everything but you know what happens
 

1571
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,029
and everything but you know what happens
if it continues to escalate that's like

1572
00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:23,039
if it continues to escalate that's like
 

1573
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,010
if it continues to escalate that's like
a world that nobody wants to nobody

1574
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:25,020
a world that nobody wants to nobody
 

1575
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,570
a world that nobody wants to nobody

guess the thing that would be

1622
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:14,340
guess the thing that would be
 

1623
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,950
guess the thing that would be
interesting to me

1624
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:15,960
interesting to me
 

1625
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,710
interesting to me
would be like what is Vladimir Putin's

1626
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:18,720
would be like what is Vladimir Putin's
 

1627
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,870
would be like what is Vladimir Putin's
interest like what is the genuine

1629
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,390
interest like what is the genuine
interest that he has in the conflict

1630
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:23,400
interest that he has in the conflict
 

1631
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,070
interest that he has in the conflict
because I think finding out like what is

1632
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:25,080
because I think finding out like what is
 

1633
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,750
because I think finding out like what is
your buy-in or what is your like what is

1634
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:26,760
your buy-in or what is your like what is
 

1635

the answer that question a lot of people

1676
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:02,220
the answer that question a lot of people
 

1677
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,950
the answer that question a lot of people
write about it but yeah well there's a

1678

I think
this is a really interesting distinction

1690
00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:14,159
this is a really interesting distinction
 

1691

because you do do difficult
conversations in the space of ideas but

1694
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:19,380

also in your stream you have I mean
there's a bunch of drama going on

1698
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:22,080
there's a bunch of drama going on
 

1699
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,930
there's a bunch of drama going on
there's there's a human psychology is

1700
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:23,940
there's there's a human psychology is
 

1701
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,990
there's there's a human psychology is
laid out uh in its full richness before

1702
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:27,000
laid out uh in its full richness before
 

1703
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,710

you so to me with leaders I think

1704
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:30,720
you so to me with leaders I think
 

1705
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,570
you so to me with leaders I think
a part of the conversation has to be

1706
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:32,580
a part of the conversation has to be
 

1707

a part of the conversation has to be
about the human psychology sure

1708
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:35,100

00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:11,090
what you want in this war will be
political answers it's like it's like a

1734
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:11,100
political answers it's like it's like a
 

1735
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,769
political answers it's like it's like a
game that's being played again with

1736
00:28:12,769 --> 00:28:12,779
game that's being played again with
 

1737
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:14,510
game that's being played again with
words and politicians are incredibly

1738
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:14,520
words and politicians are incredibly
 

1739
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,789
words and politicians are incredibly
good at playing that game I think the

1740
00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:16,799
good at playing that game I think the
 

1741
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,289
good at playing that game I think the
deeper truth

1742
00:28:18,289 --> 00:28:18,299
deeper truth
 

1743
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:20,390
deeper truth
comes from understanding the human being

1744
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:20,400
comes from understanding the human being
 

1745
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,029
comes from understanding the human being
from which those words come

1746
00:28:23,029 --> 00:28:23,039
from which those words come
 

1747
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,769
from which those words come
and I think that's what you do I don't

know if you do those kinds of

1750
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:25,740
know if you do those kinds of
 

1751
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,169
know if you do those kinds of
conversations where I've never talk to

1752
00:28:27,169 --> 00:28:27,179

um for failures of mine I mean it's
 

1835
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,430
um for failures of mine I mean it's
always going to be

1836
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:46,440
always going to be
 

1837
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,230
always going to be
on stream it'll be like I didn't push

1838
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:48,240
on stream it'll be like I didn't push
 

1839
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,789
on stream it'll be like I didn't push
back hard enough or I didn't know like a

1840
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:49,799
back hard enough or I didn't know like a
 

1841
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:52,250
back hard enough or I didn't know like a
certain fact for a conversation these

1842
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:52,260
certain fact for a conversation these
 

1843
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,570
certain fact for a conversation these
are usually the they're going to be on

1844
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:53,580
are usually the they're going to be on
 

1845
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,889
are usually the they're going to be on
these like very technical grounds

1846
00:29:54,889 --> 00:29:54,899
these like very technical grounds
 

1847
00:29:54,899 --> 00:29:56,810
these like very technical grounds
generally I'm pretty happy with like the

1848
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:56,820
generally I'm pretty happy with like the
 

1849
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,970
generally I'm pretty happy with like the
direction my conversations have gone uh

1850
00:29:58,970 --> 00:29:58,980
direction my conversations have gone uh
 

1851
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,289
direction my conversations have gone uh
recently especially over like the past

1852
00:30:00,289 --> 00:30:00,299
recently especially over like the past
 

1853
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:03,250
recently especially over like the past
six months so your goal is to

1854
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:03,260
six months so your goal is to
 

1855
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,750
six months so your goal is to
de-radicalize the audience of those

1856
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:05,760
de-radicalize the audience of those
 

1857
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,930
de-radicalize the audience of those
folks and so that used to be my goal uh

1858
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:08,940
folks and so that used to be my goal uh
 

1859
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,330
folks and so that used to be my goal uh
my goal was de-radicalization now I'm

1860
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:11,340
my goal was de-radicalization now I'm
 

1861
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,409
my goal was de-radicalization now I'm
kind of hoping that that's just the

1862
00:30:12,409 --> 00:30:12,419
kind of hoping that that's just the
 

1863
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:14,690
kind of hoping that that's just the
byproduct so the goal I think is to talk

1864
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:14,700
byproduct so the goal I think is to talk
 

1865
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,610
byproduct so the goal I think is to talk
to somebody and to show they believe

1866
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:16,620
to somebody and to show they believe
 

1867
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,950
to somebody and to show they believe
this because of these reasons and if you

1868
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:18,960
this because of these reasons and if you
 

1869
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,330
this because of these reasons and if you
want to change people's beliefs we have

1870
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:20,340
want to change people's beliefs we have
 

1871
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,830
want to change people's beliefs we have
to talk about the underlying reasons for

1872
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:21,840
to talk about the underlying reasons for
 

1873
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,210
to talk about the underlying reasons for
why they think the things they think

1874
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:23,220
why they think the things they think
 

1875
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,950
why they think the things they think
it's not enough to just say like that

1876
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:24,960
it's not enough to just say like that
 

1877
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,570
it's not enough to just say like that
belief is bad because it's like well

1878
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:26,580
belief is bad because it's like well
 

1879
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,710
belief is bad because it's like well
they believe it for a whole bunch of

1880
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:27,720
they believe it for a whole bunch of
 

1881
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,330
they believe it for a whole bunch of
things that are true and real to them at

1882
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:29,340
things that are true and real to them at
 

1883
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,310
things that are true and real to them at
least so you have to address all the

1884
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:31,320
least so you have to address all the
 

1885
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,110
least so you have to address all the
underlying things that they believe

1886
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:33,120
underlying things that they believe
 

1887
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,490
underlying things that they believe
before you can change the overlying

1888
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:34,500
before you can change the overlying

belief so if I'm having a conversation
 

1891
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,450
belief so if I'm having a conversation
with somebody it'll be like okay why do

okay I understand that maybe like a
better way to solve that would be like

1898
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:43,500
better way to solve that would be like
 

1899
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,850
better way to solve that would be like
this or that instead of this thing so to

1900
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:46,860
this or that instead of this thing so to

1967
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,590
and I'm going to try to be working
through that framework really good

1968
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:45,600
through that framework really good
 

1969
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,450
through that framework really good
example might be

1970
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:47,460
example might be
 

1971
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,889
example might be
um we'll say like when it comes to trans

that I want that debate to play out is
 

1979
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:57,470
that I want that debate to play out is
uh let's look at all the data let's see

1980
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:57,480
uh let's look at all the data let's see
 

1981
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,330
uh let's look at all the data let's see
what are the outcomes uh let's see what

1982
00:31:59,330 --> 00:31:59,340
what are the outcomes uh let's see what
 

1983
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,409
what are the outcomes uh let's see what
are the processes for getting a

1984
00:32:00,409 --> 00:32:00,419
are the processes for getting a
 

1985
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:01,730
are the processes for getting a
medication and then we'll evaluate all

1986
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:01,740
medication and then we'll evaluate all
 

1987
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,990
medication and then we'll evaluate all
of that and then we'll go in whatever

1988
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:03,000
of that and then we'll go in whatever
 

1989
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,090
of that and then we'll go in whatever
like points more favorably but that's

1990
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:05,100
like points more favorably but that's
 

1991
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,710
like points more favorably but that's
wholly unconvincing to most people right

1992
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:06,720
wholly unconvincing to most people right
 

1993
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,510

1997
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:10,850
conversation with another parent the
easiest way for me to have that

1998
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:10,860
easiest way for me to have that
 

1999
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,769
easiest way for me to have that
conversation is like hey we both have

2000
00:32:12,769 --> 00:32:12,779
conversation is like hey we both have
 

2001
00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:14,870

kids imagine how horrible it would be if
 

2003
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,549
kids imagine how horrible it would be if
we felt like our kids needed help and

2004
00:32:16,549 --> 00:32:16,559
we felt like our kids needed help and
 

2005
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,630
we felt like our kids needed help and
the government was trying to get between

2006
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:17,640
the government was trying to get between
 

2007
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,789
the government was trying to get between
us and and their doctor and that

2008
00:32:19,789 --> 00:32:19,799
us and and their doctor and that
 

2009
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:21,409
us and and their doctor and that
conversation that might be how that talk

2010
00:32:21,409 --> 00:32:21,419
conversation that might be how that talk
 

2011
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:23,090
conversation that might be how that talk
plays out which I think that's a really

2012
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:23,100
plays out which I think that's a really
 

2013
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,409
plays out which I think that's a really
good argument because I think there

2014
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:24,419
good argument because I think there
 

2015
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:25,250
good argument because I think there
probably are times when the government

2016
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:25,260
probably are times when the government
 

2017
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,389
probably are times when the government
should get in between but I'll have that

2018
00:32:26,389 --> 00:32:26,399
should get in between but I'll have that
 

2019
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,250
should get in between but I'll have that
conversation because now I'm in a world

2020
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:28,260
conversation because now I'm in a world
 

2021
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,630
conversation because now I'm in a world
where they understand what I'm saying

where they understand what I'm saying
I'm resonating with the way that they

2024
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:31,380
I'm resonating with the way that they
 

2025
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,930
I'm resonating with the way that they
feel about things and then I can make

2026
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:32,940
feel about things and then I can make
 

2027
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,730
feel about things and then I can make
progress with the way that they're kind

2028
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:34,740
progress with the way that they're kind
 

2029
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,750
progress with the way that they're kind

said hate speech but I don't use like
 

2041
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:48,110
said hate speech but I don't use like
slurs or anything so it's hard to know

2042
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:48,120
slurs or anything so it's hard to know
 

2043
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,450
slurs or anything so it's hard to know
exactly so I think you made the claim

2044
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:50,460
exactly so I think you made the claim
 

2045
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,610
exactly so I think you made the claim
that trans women shouldn't compete with

2046
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:52,620
that trans women shouldn't compete with
 

2047
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,490
that trans women shouldn't compete with
CIS women in the women's Athletics

2048
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:55,500
CIS women in the women's Athletics
 

2049
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,230
CIS women in the women's Athletics
can you

2050
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:57,240
can you
 

2051
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,450
can you
make this case and can you still man the

2052
00:32:59,450 --> 00:32:59,460
make this case and can you still man the
 

2053
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,490
make this case and can you still man the
case against it I think in your

2054
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:01,500
case against it I think in your
 

2055
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,769
case against it I think in your
community there's a lot of trans folks

2056
00:33:03,769 --> 00:33:03,779
community there's a lot of trans folks
 

2057
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:06,049
community there's a lot of trans folks
who love you and there's a lot who hate

2058
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:06,059
who love you and there's a lot who hate
 

2059
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:09,110
who love you and there's a lot who hate
you yeah and so if you can walk the

2060
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:09,120
you yeah and so if you can walk the
 

2061
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,870
you yeah and so if you can walk the
tightrope of this conversation to try to

2062
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:11,880
tightrope of this conversation to try to
 

2063
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,730
tightrope of this conversation to try to
steal me on both sides one of the

2064
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:13,740
steal me on both sides one of the
 

2065
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,110
steal me on both sides one of the
argumentative strategies I say is that

2066
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:15,120
argumentative strategies I say is that
 

2067
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,310
argumentative strategies I say is that
like any time you have a conversation

2068
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:16,320
like any time you have a conversation
 

2069
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,630
like any time you have a conversation
you should be able to argue both sides

2070
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:17,640
you should be able to argue both sides
 

2071
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,210
you should be able to argue both sides
better than anybody else you know so um

2072
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:20,220
better than anybody else you know so um
 

2073
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,250
better than anybody else you know so um
for the for the my side the genuine

2074
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:22,260
for the for the my side the genuine
 

2075
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,690
for the for the my side the genuine
belief side

2076
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:23,700
belief side
 

2077
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,690
belief side
um it feels like overwhelmingly all of

2078
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:26,700
um it feels like overwhelmingly all of
 

2079
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,509
um it feels like overwhelmingly all of
the data is showing that trans mostly

2080
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:29,519
the data is showing that trans mostly
 

2081
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,389
the data is showing that trans mostly
trans women uh even after I think three

2082
00:33:32,389 --> 00:33:32,399
trans women uh even after I think three
 

2083
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:35,210
trans women uh even after I think three
years on some sort of like HRT or you

2084
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:35,220
years on some sort of like HRT or you
 

2085
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:38,210
years on some sort of like HRT or you
know estrogen uh stuff they're still

2086
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:38,220
know estrogen uh stuff they're still
 

2087
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,830
know estrogen uh stuff they're still
maintaining these advantages from their

2088
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:39,840
maintaining these advantages from their
 

2089
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,250
maintaining these advantages from their
male puberty over cisgender women and if

2090
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:43,260
male puberty over cisgender women and if
 

2091
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,870
male puberty over cisgender women and if
that is the case if we are going to draw

2092
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:44,880
that is the case if we are going to draw
 

2093
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,610
that is the case if we are going to draw
these distinctions around our Sports

2094
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:46,620
these distinctions around our Sports
 

2095
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:49,490
these distinctions around our Sports
between women and men it feels unfair to

2096
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:49,500
between women and men it feels unfair to
 

2097
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,049
between women and men it feels unfair to
have a category inside the women's

2098
00:33:51,049 --> 00:33:51,059
have a category inside the women's
 

2099
00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:53,450
have a category inside the women's
sports that are maintaining advantages

2100
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:53,460
sports that are maintaining advantages
 

2101
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,370
sports that are maintaining advantages
that are coming from a male puberty

2102
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:55,380
that are coming from a male puberty
 

2103
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,169
that are coming from a male puberty
regardless of the amount of time they've

2104
00:33:57,169 --> 00:33:57,179
regardless of the amount of time they've
 

2105
00:33:57,179 --> 00:34:00,230
regardless of the amount of time they've
spent on hormone replacement therapy

2106
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:00,240
spent on hormone replacement therapy
 

2107
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,789
spent on hormone replacement therapy
so that would be my argument on that

2108
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:01,799
so that would be my argument on that
 

2109
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:04,610
so that would be my argument on that
side so it's unfair from a performance

2110
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:04,620
side so it's unfair from a performance
 

2111
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:07,430
side so it's unfair from a performance
enhancement aspect so the same way we've

2112
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:07,440
enhancement aspect so the same way we've
 

2113
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,109
enhancement aspect so the same way we've
been

2114
00:34:08,109 --> 00:34:08,119
been
 

2115
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:10,790
been
performance performance enhancing drugs

2116
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:10,800
performance performance enhancing drugs
 

2117
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,909
performance performance enhancing drugs
that involve increasing of testosterone

2118
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:13,919
that involve increasing of testosterone
 

2119
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:15,649
that involve increasing of testosterone
in that same way would be unfair

2120
00:34:15,649 --> 00:34:15,659
in that same way would be unfair
 

2121
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:18,649
in that same way would be unfair
essentially yeah so what's the case uh

2122
00:34:18,649 --> 00:34:18,659
essentially yeah so what's the case uh
 

2123
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:21,109
essentially yeah so what's the case uh
against the key yeah so the case in

2124
00:34:21,109 --> 00:34:21,119
against the key yeah so the case in
 

2125
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,510
against the key yeah so the case in
favor of them competing together is that

2126
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:23,520
favor of them competing together is that
 

2127
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,089
favor of them competing together is that
realistically there's not going to be a

2128
00:34:26,089 --> 00:34:26,099
realistically there's not going to be a
 

2129
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:28,669
realistically there's not going to be a
transports category uh realistically

2130
00:34:28,669 --> 00:34:28,679
transports category uh realistically
 

2131
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:29,990
transports category uh realistically
trans women aren't going to be

2132
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:30,000
trans women aren't going to be
 

2133
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,490
trans women aren't going to be
competitive with CIS men because they've

2134
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:31,500
competitive with CIS men because they've
 

2135
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,470
competitive with CIS men because they've
gone through these huge uh you know like

2136
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:33,480
gone through these huge uh you know like
 

2137
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,270
gone through these huge uh you know like
hormone changes by the medication

2138
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:35,280
hormone changes by the medication
 

2139
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,530
hormone changes by the medication
they're taking

2140
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:36,540
they're taking
 

2141
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,869
they're taking
and that when we look at how sports are

2142
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:38,879
and that when we look at how sports are
 

2143
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:41,030
and that when we look at how sports are
kind of done anyway there's a whole

2144
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:41,040
kind of done anyway there's a whole
 

2145
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,070
kind of done anyway there's a whole
bunch of biological differences between

2146
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:43,080
bunch of biological differences between
 

2147
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,169
bunch of biological differences between
people within sports categories that are

2148
00:34:45,169 --> 00:34:45,179
people within sports categories that are
 

2149
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:47,089
people within sports categories that are
determining their placement in the

2150
00:34:47,089 --> 00:34:47,099
determining their placement in the
 

2151
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:49,669
determining their placement in the
professional world so for instance

2152
00:34:49,669 --> 00:34:49,679
professional world so for instance
 

2153
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,930
professional world so for instance
um somebody like me is probably never

2154
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:50,940
um somebody like me is probably never
 

2155
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,310
um somebody like me is probably never
going to go far in the NBA because I'm

2156
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:52,320
going to go far in the NBA because I'm
 

2157
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,990
going to go far in the NBA because I'm
not tall enough I think the average

2158
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:54,000
not tall enough I think the average
 

2159
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,609
not tall enough I think the average
height in the NBA don't doubt yourselves

2160
00:34:55,609 --> 00:34:55,619
height in the NBA don't doubt yourselves
 

2161
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:56,869
height in the NBA don't doubt yourselves
don't doubt myself yeah I want to say

2162
00:34:56,869 --> 00:34:56,879
don't doubt myself yeah I want to say
 

2163
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,550
don't doubt myself yeah I want to say
it's like six six or something they're

2164
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:58,560
it's like six six or something they're
 

2165
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,589
it's like six six or something they're
huge people

2166
00:35:00,589 --> 00:35:00,599
huge people
 

2167
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,210
huge people
um or you know you look at like Michael

2168
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:02,220
um or you know you look at like Michael
 

2169
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,890
um or you know you look at like Michael
Phelps as a classic example of a guy

2170
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:03,900
Phelps as a classic example of a guy
 

2171
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,230
Phelps as a classic example of a guy
whose torso is like so long his body is

2172
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:06,240
whose torso is like so long his body is
 

2173
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,510
whose torso is like so long his body is
built for swimming and I think there are

2174
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:08,520
built for swimming and I think there are
 

2175
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,770
built for swimming and I think there are
some trans people that will look at that

2176
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:09,780
some trans people that will look at that
 

2177
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,270
some trans people that will look at that
or somebody advocating for this position

2178
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:11,280
or somebody advocating for this position
 

2179
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,290
or somebody advocating for this position
they'll look at that they'll go okay

2180
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:12,300
they'll look at that they'll go okay
 

2181
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,030
they'll look at that they'll go okay
realistically the way that Michael

2182
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:14,040
realistically the way that Michael
 

2183
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,609
realistically the way that Michael
Phelps body processes lactic acid the

2184
00:35:16,609 --> 00:35:16,619
Phelps body processes lactic acid the
 

2185
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:18,470
Phelps body processes lactic acid the
shape physiologically of his body is

2186
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:18,480
shape physiologically of his body is
 

2187
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,730
shape physiologically of his body is
going to put him in a level of

2188
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:19,740
going to put him in a level of
 

2189
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,710
going to put him in a level of
competition that so many men are never

2190
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:21,720
competition that so many men are never
 

2191
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,150
competition that so many men are never
going to reach just because of biology

2192
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:23,160
going to reach just because of biology
 

2193
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,190
going to reach just because of biology
how is it fair that you can have these

2194
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:25,200
how is it fair that you can have these
 

2195
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,109
how is it fair that you can have these
biological outliers competing in these

2196
00:35:27,109 --> 00:35:27,119
biological outliers competing in these
 

2197
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,790
biological outliers competing in these
categories but then when we come to like

2198
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:28,800
categories but then when we come to like
 

2199
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,349
categories but then when we come to like
sports categories with translucentous

2200
00:35:30,349 --> 00:35:30,359
sports categories with translucentous
 

2201

women you're going to take trans women
and say that they can't compete against

2204
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:32,940
and say that they can't compete against
 

2205
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,730
and say that they can't compete against
women can't you also just say that they

women can't you also just say that they
 

2207
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,410
women can't you also just say that they
have some level of biological difference

2208
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:36,420
have some level of biological difference
 

2209
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,329
have some level of biological difference
there like is it really going to be that

2210
00:35:38,329 --> 00:35:38,339
there like is it really going to be that
 

2211
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:39,470
there like is it really going to be that
great of a difference than what Michael

do you think we're going to get into
 

2223
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,089
do you think we're going to get into
some tricky ethical territory as we

2224
00:35:50,089 --> 00:35:50,099
some tricky ethical territory as we
 

2225
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:52,010
some tricky ethical territory as we
start to be able to uh through biology

2226
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:52,020
start to be able to uh through biology
 

2227
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,770
start to be able to uh through biology
and genetics modify the human body

2228
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:54,780
and genetics modify the human body
 

2229
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,710
and genetics modify the human body
absolutely I feel like those things are

2230
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:57,720
absolutely I feel like those things are
 

2231
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,410
absolutely I feel like those things are
coming sooner than uh we want to assume

2232
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:00,420
coming sooner than uh we want to assume
 

2233
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,690
coming sooner than uh we want to assume
them to uh the uh oh man dude the a have

you seen the AI art yes that's a of

2236
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:05,040
you seen the AI art yes that's a of
 

2237
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,310
you seen the AI art yes that's a of
course I'm an AI person oh okay then

2238
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:07,320
course I'm an AI person oh okay then
 

2239
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,349
course I'm an AI person oh okay then
yeah yeah that's a uh that's always been

like uh what's gonna happen when uh when
 

2243
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,609
like uh what's gonna happen when uh when
robots can do art better than humans LOL

2244
00:36:13,609 --> 00:36:13,619
robots can do art better than humans LOL
 

2245
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:15,650
robots can do art better than humans LOL
like well we'll see in 20 years in 20

2246
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:15,660
like well we'll see in 20 years in 20
 

2247
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,810
like well we'll see in 20 years in 20
years and 20 years and now you have ai

2248
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:17,820
years and 20 years and now you have ai
 

2249
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:20,690
years and 20 years and now you have ai
art winning competitions and it's funny

2250
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:20,700
art winning competitions and it's funny
 

2251
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,609
art winning competitions and it's funny
because

2252
00:36:21,609 --> 00:36:21,619
because
 

2253
00:36:21,619 --> 00:36:25,010
because
robots are essentially the robot behind

2254
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:25,020
robots are essentially the robot behind
 

2255
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:27,050
robots are essentially the robot behind
you by the way the robot behind me oh

2256
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:27,060
you by the way the robot behind me oh
 

2257
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,130
you by the way the robot behind me oh
nice

2258
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:28,140
nice
 

2259
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,349
nice
um robots are really good careful what

2260
00:36:30,349 --> 00:36:30,359
um robots are really good careful what
 

2261
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:32,450
um robots are really good careful what
you say yeah I got it I'll be careful um

2262
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:32,460
you say yeah I got it I'll be careful um
 

2263
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,650
you say yeah I got it I'll be careful um
that's not like one of the Chinese ones

2264
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:33,660
that's not like one of the Chinese ones
 

2265
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,810
that's not like one of the Chinese ones
with a gun on it right oh okay uh

2266
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:35,820
with a gun on it right oh okay uh
 

2267
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:38,690
with a gun on it right oh okay uh
hopefully not uh we'll see depending on

2268
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:38,700
hopefully not uh we'll see depending on
 

2269
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:41,030
hopefully not uh we'll see depending on
what you say yeah okay robots are really

2270
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:41,040
what you say yeah okay robots are really
 

2271
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,849
what you say yeah okay robots are really
good at showing the limitations of the

2272
00:36:43,849 --> 00:36:43,859
good at showing the limitations of the
 

2273
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:46,670
good at showing the limitations of the
human mind in categories that we didn't

2274
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:46,680
human mind in categories that we didn't
 

2275
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,190
human mind in categories that we didn't
believe we were limited before I I think

2276
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:49,200
believe we were limited before I I think
 

2277
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,530
believe we were limited before I I think
that humans have this idea intrinsically

2278
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:51,540
that humans have this idea intrinsically
 

2279
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:54,950
that humans have this idea intrinsically
that we have like some type of like

00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:54,960
that we have like some type of like
 

2281
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,310

Innovative Creative Drive that is just

2282
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:58,320
Innovative Creative Drive that is just
 

2283
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,930
Innovative Creative Drive that is just

understanding and with a sophisticated
 

2287
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,730
understanding and with a sophisticated
enough program we see that maybe that's

2288
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:04,740
enough program we see that maybe that's
 

2289
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,230
enough program we see that maybe that's
not actually true and that's a really

2290
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:06,240
not actually true and that's a really
 

2291
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,750
not actually true and that's a really
scary thing philosophically to deal with

2292
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:08,760
scary thing philosophically to deal with
 

2293
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,010
scary thing philosophically to deal with
because we feel like we're very special

2294
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:10,020
because we feel like we're very special
 

2295
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,930
because we feel like we're very special
right we own the planet we make

2296
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:11,940
right we own the planet we make

00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,550
right we own the planet we make
computers and the idea that you can

2298
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:13,560
computers and the idea that you can
 

2299
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,990
computers and the idea that you can
start to get these robots that can do

2300
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:15,000
start to get these robots that can do
 

2301
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,670
start to get these robots that can do
things that's like okay you can do math

2302
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:16,680
things that's like okay you can do math
 

2303
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,530
things that's like okay you can do math
fine okay you can do calculations

2304
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:18,540
fine okay you can do calculations
 

2305
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,030
fine okay you can do calculations
because it's fine but you can't do art

2306
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:20,040
because it's fine but you can't do art
 

2307
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,130
because it's fine but you can't do art
that's the human stuff and then when

2308
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:22,140
that's the human stuff and then when
 

2309
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,510
that's the human stuff and then when
they start to do that it's like oh shoot

2310
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:23,520
they start to do that it's like oh shoot
 

2311
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,849
they start to do that it's like oh shoot
and that terrifies you a little bit like

2312
00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:25,859
and that terrifies you a little bit like
 

2313
00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:28,430
and that terrifies you a little bit like
a losing the human species losing

2314
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:28,440
a losing the human species losing
 

2315
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,370
a losing the human species losing
control of our dominance I don't think

2316
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:31,380
control of our dominance I don't think
 

2317
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,510
control of our dominance I don't think
it's necessarily losing control of our

2318
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:32,520
it's necessarily losing control of our
 

2319
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,130
it's necessarily losing control of our
dominance I mean I guess like a Skynet

2320
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:34,140
dominance I mean I guess like a Skynet
 

2321
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:36,050
dominance I mean I guess like a Skynet
thing could come in at some point but I

2322
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:36,060
thing could come in at some point but I
 

2323
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,810
thing could come in at some point but I
think I think it more it it brings us to

2324
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:38,820
think I think it more it it brings us to
 

2325
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,069
think I think it more it it brings us to
this really fundamental level of like

2326
00:37:40,069 --> 00:37:40,079
this really fundamental level of like
 

2327
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,930
this really fundamental level of like
what does it mean to be human what is it

2328
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:41,940
what does it mean to be human what is it
 

2329
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,430
what does it mean to be human what is it
that we're good at

2330
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:43,440
that we're good at
 

2331
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,569
that we're good at
um what should we be doing with

2332
00:37:44,569 --> 00:37:44,579
um what should we be doing with
 

2333
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:46,069
um what should we be doing with
technology we never really asked that

2334
00:37:46,069 --> 00:37:46,079
technology we never really asked that
 

2335
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,270
technology we never really asked that
question in the western world it's

2336
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:47,280
question in the western world it's
 

2337
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,730
question in the western world it's
always the technology is like normative

2338
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:49,740
always the technology is like normative
 

2339
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:52,370
always the technology is like normative
and that technology equals good and more

2340
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:52,380
and that technology equals good and more
 

2341
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,750
and that technology equals good and more
technology equals better that's been

2342
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:53,760
technology equals better that's been
 

2343
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,490
technology equals better that's been
like the default assumption in fact if

2344
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:55,500
like the default assumption in fact if
 

2345
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,990
like the default assumption in fact if
you ask a lot of people how do you know

2346
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:57,000
you ask a lot of people how do you know
 

2347
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,490
you ask a lot of people how do you know
if civilization has progressed over the

if civilization has progressed over the
 

2349
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,829
if civilization has progressed over the
past 100 or 200 years they don't say we

00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:02,930
past 100 or 200 years they don't say we
have better relationships we um you know

00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:02,940
have better relationships we um you know
 

2353
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,670

we've got crazy phones we've got crazy
computers and um the idea that more

2360
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:09,180
computers and um the idea that more
 

2361
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,970
computers and um the idea that more
technology might be bad has never even

00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:10,980
technology might be bad has never even
 

2363
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,410
technology might be bad has never even
crossed somebody's mind unless it's used

2364
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:12,420
crossed somebody's mind unless it's used
 

2365
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,569
crossed somebody's mind unless it's used
for like a really bad thing so well it's

2366
00:38:14,569 --> 00:38:14,579
for like a really bad thing so well it's
 

2367
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:16,430
for like a really bad thing so well it's
interesting we kind of think as more and

2368
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:16,440
interesting we kind of think as more and
 

2369
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,589
interesting we kind of think as more and
more automation is happening we're going

2370
00:38:18,589 --> 00:38:18,599
more automation is happening we're going
 

2371
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:20,569
more automation is happening we're going
to get more and more meaning from things

2372
00:38:20,569 --> 00:38:20,579
to get more and more meaning from things
 

2373
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:22,970
to get more and more meaning from things
like being artists and doing creative

2374
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:22,980
like being artists and doing creative

if the r if the creative proceeds are
 

2379
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,349
if the r if the creative proceeds are
also being automated then what are we

2380
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:30,359
also being automated then what are we
 

2381
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:31,970
also being automated then what are we
going to gain meaning from what are the

2382
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:31,980
going to gain meaning from what are the
 

2383
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,290
going to gain meaning from what are the
activities from what you'll gain meaning

it's interesting to build up intuition

2396
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:44,160
it's interesting to build up intuition
 

2397
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:48,349
it's interesting to build up intuition
and destroy that intuition about what is

2398
00:38:48,349 --> 00:38:48,359
and destroy that intuition about what is
 

2399
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:52,010
and destroy that intuition about what is
and isn't solvable by machines I think

2400
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:52,020
and isn't solvable by machines I think
 

2401
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,690
and isn't solvable by machines I think
um for the longest time I grew up

2402
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:53,700
um for the longest time I grew up
 

2403
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:56,270
um for the longest time I grew up
thinking go is not the game will go is

2405
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,810
thinking go is not the game will go is
not solvable uh because my understanding

2406
00:38:59,810 --> 00:38:59,820
not solvable uh because my understanding
 

2407
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:03,349
not solvable uh because my understanding
of AI systems is ultimately that it's

salesman problem it's not even going to

2418
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:14,280
salesman problem it's not even going to
 

2419
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,190
salesman problem it's not even going to
be able to give you an approximation so

2420
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:16,200
be able to give you an approximation so
 

2421
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,930
be able to give you an approximation so
most interesting problems are giant

most interesting problems are giant
 

2423
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:20,270
most interesting problems are giant
travel salesman problem and then so of

2424
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:20,280
travel salesman problem and then so of
 

2425
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,349
travel salesman problem and then so of
course it's not gonna be able to solve

2426
00:39:21,349 --> 00:39:21,359
course it's not gonna be able to solve
 

2427
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,990
course it's not gonna be able to solve
that and then you then uh the Deep

00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:24,000
that and then you then uh the Deep
 

2429
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,970
that and then you then uh the Deep
learning Revolution made you realize

to struggle with the most is the

so that that's a counterintuitive we

2486
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:32,160
so that that's a counterintuitive we
 

2487

so that that's a counterintuitive we
humans think that it's um it's pretty

00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:34,500
humans think that it's um it's pretty
 

2489
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,910
humans think that it's um it's pretty
trivial the being able to pick up a cup

2490
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:37,920
trivial the being able to pick up a cup

00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:40,440
being able to like write with a pen like
 

2493
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,990
being able to like write with a pen like
in the physical space would think that's

2494
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:42,000
in the physical space would think that's
 

2495
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,450
in the physical space would think that's
trivial we give ourselves respect for

00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:44,460
trivial we give ourselves respect for
 

2497
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,370
trivial we give ourselves respect for
being great artists and great uh

2498
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:46,380
being great artists and great uh
 

2499
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,750
being great artists and great uh
mathematicians and all that kind of

2500
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:47,760
mathematicians and all that kind of
 

2501
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,430
mathematicians and all that kind of
stuff and that seems to be much easier

2502
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:49,440
stuff and that seems to be much easier
 

2503
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,770
stuff and that seems to be much easier
than the physical space our bodies are

2504
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:51,780
than the physical space our bodies are
 

2505
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,930
than the physical space our bodies are
really cool yeah there is a um I don't

2506
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:53,940
really cool yeah there is a um I don't
 

2507
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,490
really cool yeah there is a um I don't
know it's probably Asimov or something

2508
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:55,500
know it's probably Asimov or something
 

2509
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,810
know it's probably Asimov or something
there's some science fiction writer that

2510
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:56,820
there's some science fiction writer that
 

2511
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,130
there's some science fiction writer that
had a short story and it was like an

2512
00:40:58,130 --> 00:40:58,140
had a short story and it was like an
 

2513
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,510
had a short story and it was like an
alien that had landed on Earth and it

2514
00:40:59,510 --> 00:40:59,520
alien that had landed on Earth and it
 

2515
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,190
alien that had landed on Earth and it
was describing our bodies from a totally

2516
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:01,200
was describing our bodies from a totally
 

2517
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,050
was describing our bodies from a totally
alien perspective and when you think

2518
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:03,060
alien perspective and when you think
 

2519
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,670
alien perspective and when you think
about all the things we can do it's

2520
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:04,680
about all the things we can do it's
 

2521
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,650
about all the things we can do it's
pretty cool we can you know climb

2522
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:06,660
pretty cool we can you know climb
 

2523
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,510
pretty cool we can you know climb
through a whole multitude of

2524
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:08,520
through a whole multitude of
 

2525
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,010
through a whole multitude of
environments we can exist in a multitude

2526
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:10,020
environments we can exist in a multitude
 

2527
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:13,190
environments we can exist in a multitude
of temperatures we can manipulate things

2528
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:13,200
of temperatures we can manipulate things
 

2529
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,470
of temperatures we can manipulate things
um just with our hands and you know the

2530
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:15,480
um just with our hands and you know the
 

2531
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,730
um just with our hands and you know the
way that we can interact with things

2532
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:16,740
way that we can interact with things
 

2533
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,530
way that we can interact with things
around us and yeah we're very capable on

2534
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:18,540
around us and yeah we're very capable on
 

2535
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,970
around us and yeah we're very capable on
like a physical level even though like

2536
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:19,980
like a physical level even though like
 

2537
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,170
like a physical level even though like
you said we think about ourselves like

2538
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:21,180
you said we think about ourselves like
 

2539
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,190
you said we think about ourselves like
oh well human beings have really big

2540
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:22,200
oh well human beings have really big
 

2541
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,569
oh well human beings have really big
brains and we do we're really

2542
00:41:23,569 --> 00:41:23,579
brains and we do we're really
 

2543
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:25,130
brains and we do we're really
intelligent as well but yeah our bodies

2544
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:25,140
intelligent as well but yeah our bodies
 

2545
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,210
intelligent as well but yeah our bodies
are pretty cool too

2546
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:26,220
are pretty cool too
 

2547
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:29,150
are pretty cool too
and it's a fascinating hierarchical

2548
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:29,160
and it's a fascinating hierarchical
 

2549
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,089
and it's a fascinating hierarchical
biological system like um

2550
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:32,099
biological system like um
 

2551
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:33,770
biological system like um
that were made up of a bunch of

2552
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:33,780
that were made up of a bunch of
 

2553
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:34,970
that were made up of a bunch of
different

2554
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:34,980
different
 

2555
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:37,069
different
like living organisms

2556
00:41:37,069 --> 00:41:37,079
like living organisms
 

2557
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:38,630
like living organisms
that all don't know about the big

2558
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:38,640
that all don't know about the big
 

2559
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,390
that all don't know about the big
picture of our body and it's all

2560
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:41,400
picture of our body and it's all
 

2561
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,829
picture of our body and it's all
functioning its own little local world

2562
00:41:42,829 --> 00:41:42,839
functioning its own little local world
 

2563
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:45,290
functioning its own little local world
and it's doing its thing but together it

2564
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:45,300
and it's doing its thing but together it
 

2565
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:48,050
and it's doing its thing but together it
has a of it forms a super resilient

2566
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:48,060
has a of it forms a super resilient
 

2567
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:51,550
has a of it forms a super resilient
system all of that comes from

2568
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:51,560
system all of that comes from
 

2569
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:55,370
system all of that comes from
a very uh compressed

2570
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:55,380
a very uh compressed
 

2571
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,650
a very uh compressed
encoding of what makes a human you start

2572
00:41:57,650 --> 00:41:57,660
encoding of what makes a human you start
 

2573
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,569
encoding of what makes a human you start
with the DNA and it builds up from a

2574
00:41:59,569 --> 00:41:59,579
with the DNA and it builds up from a
 

2575
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:03,109
with the DNA and it builds up from a
single cell to a giant organism I mean

2576
00:42:03,109 --> 00:42:03,119
single cell to a giant organism I mean
 

2577
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,050
single cell to a giant organism I mean
and because of the DNA through the

2578
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:06,060
and because of the DNA through the
 

2579
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,210
and because of the DNA through the
evolution process you can constantly

2580
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:08,220
evolution process you can constantly
 

2581
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,829
evolution process you can constantly
create new humans and new living

2582
00:42:09,829 --> 00:42:09,839
create new humans and new living
 

2583
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:11,810
create new humans and new living
organisms that adapt to the environment

2584
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:11,820
organisms that adapt to the environment
 

2585
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,790
organisms that adapt to the environment
like that resilience to the physical

2586
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:13,800
like that resilience to the physical
 

2587
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,930
like that resilience to the physical
world

2588
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:14,940
world
 

2589
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:17,450
world
it seems like running the whole earth

2590
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:17,460
it seems like running the whole earth
 

2591
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,950
it seems like running the whole earth
over again

2592
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:18,960
over again
 

2593
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,810
over again
the whole evolutionary process over

00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:20,820
the whole evolutionary process over
 

2595
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:24,710
the whole evolutionary process over
again is uh might be the only way to do

2596
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:24,720
again is uh might be the only way to do
 

2597
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,109
again is uh might be the only way to do
it so to create a robot that actually

2598
00:42:27,109 --> 00:42:27,119
it so to create a robot that actually
 

2599
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:28,730
it so to create a robot that actually
adapts

2600
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:28,740
adapts

is as resilient to the dynamic world

2602
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:31,500
is as resilient to the dynamic world
 

2603
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,430
is as resilient to the dynamic world
might be a really difficult problem

2604
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:34,440
might be a really difficult problem
 

2605
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,170
might be a really difficult problem
possibly well it's going to say like in

2606
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:36,180
possibly well it's going to say like in
 

2607
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,490
possibly well it's going to say like in
a programming environment you can do

2608
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:37,500
a programming environment you can do
 

2609
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,109
a programming environment you can do
things on time scales that are

2610
00:42:39,109 --> 00:42:39,119
things on time scales that are
 

2611
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:41,270
things on time scales that are
impossible in the real world right like

2612
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:41,280
impossible in the real world right like
 

2613
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,010
impossible in the real world right like
the benefit to Ai and computers is a

00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:43,020
the benefit to Ai and computers is a
 

2615
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,569
the benefit to Ai and computers is a
computational they can compute so much

2616

computational they can compute so much
 

2617
00:42:44,579 --> 00:42:46,730
computational they can compute so much
data so quickly whereas on human

timetables we have to wait when you talk

2620
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:48,720
timetables we have to wait when you talk
 

2621
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,030
timetables we have to wait when you talk
about Evolution

2622
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:50,040
about Evolution
 

2623
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,650
about Evolution
um you know it's generation after

2624
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:51,660
um you know it's generation after
 

2625
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:53,210
um you know it's generation after
generation after generation you know

2626
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:53,220
generation after generation you know
 

2627
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:54,770
generation after generation you know
maybe in a virtual environment that

2628
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:54,780
maybe in a virtual environment that
 

2629
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,210
maybe in a virtual environment that
could be simulated and then those

2630
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:56,220
could be simulated and then those
 

2631
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,650
could be simulated and then those
changes Could Happen a lot quicker with

2632
00:42:57,650 --> 00:42:57,660
changes Could Happen a lot quicker with
 

2633
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,690
changes Could Happen a lot quicker with
this in a human time scale but you have

2634
00:42:59,690 --> 00:42:59,700
this in a human time scale but you have
 

2635
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:00,770
this in a human time scale but you have
to look at Earth

2636
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:00,780
to look at Earth
 

2637
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,930
to look at Earth
at a Quantum as a quantum mechanical

2638
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:02,940
at a Quantum as a quantum mechanical
 

2639
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:04,430
at a Quantum as a quantum mechanical

super fast this is a giant computer

2642
00:43:06,349 --> 00:43:06,359
super fast this is a giant computer
 

2643
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:08,870
super fast this is a giant computer
doing a giant simulation so just because

2644
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:08,880
doing a giant simulation so just because
 

2645
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,329
doing a giant simulation so just because
for us humans it's slow there's like

2646
00:43:11,329 --> 00:43:11,339
for us humans it's slow there's like
 

2647
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:13,730
for us humans it's slow there's like
trillions of organisms involved in you

2648
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:13,740
trillions of organisms involved in you
 

2649
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:16,490
trillions of organisms involved in you
Destiny being you sure but the next

2650
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:16,500
Destiny being you sure but the next
 

2651
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,890
Destiny being you sure but the next
iteration of like from Human to human

2652

even if under the quantum love is a lot

2654
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:21,000
even if under the quantum love is a lot
 

2655
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,430
even if under the quantum love is a lot
of stuff going on you talk about like um

2656
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:22,440
of stuff going on you talk about like um
 

2657
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,410
of stuff going on you talk about like um
like changes in DNA for instance right

2658
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:24,420
like changes in DNA for instance right
 

2659
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:26,750
like changes in DNA for instance right
like that's happening from a generation

2660
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:26,760
like that's happening from a generation
 

2661
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,370
like that's happening from a generation
a generation time scale like in a

2662
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:28,380
a generation time scale like in a
 

2663
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:29,210
a generation time scale like in a
virtual environment that could

2664
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:29,220
virtual environment that could
 

2665
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:31,130

like working on doing all that stuff and

2672
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:36,480
like working on doing all that stuff and
 

2673
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,790
like working on doing all that stuff and
it'll run like trillions and trillions

2674
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:37,800
it'll run like trillions and trillions

slower than the actual protein folding
 

2681
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:46,849

humans entertain us and that's a really
 

2729
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,670
humans entertain us and that's a really
interesting of course problem but it's

interesting of course problem but it's
 

2731
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,970
interesting of course problem but it's
surprising how difficult it has been

because so many your social network is

2824
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:29,700
because so many your social network is
 

2825
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,309
because so many your social network is
established the digital space like so

2826
00:46:31,309 --> 00:46:31,319
established the digital space like so
 

2827
00:46:31,319 --> 00:46:32,569
established the digital space like so
many people know you through the digital

2828

many people know you through the digital
 

2829
00:46:32,579 --> 00:46:35,030
many people know you through the digital
space can there be can we swap out

2830
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:35,040
space can there be can we swap out
 

2831
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,010
space can there be can we swap out
another person that looks like you

2832
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:37,020
another person that looks like you
 

2833
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:39,589
another person that looks like you
and like an AI system and then that

2834
00:46:39,589 --> 00:46:39,599
and like an AI system and then that
 

2835
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,270
and like an AI system and then that
entity known as Destiny will continue

2836
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:41,280
entity known as Destiny will continue
 

2837
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,790
entity known as Destiny will continue
existing so I mean it must be like there

2838
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:43,800
existing so I mean it must be like there
 

2839
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,349
existing so I mean it must be like there
must be some level of sophistication

2840
00:46:45,349 --> 00:46:45,359
must be some level of sophistication
 

2841
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,569
must be some level of sophistication
that could emulate a human brain I would

2842
00:46:47,569 --> 00:46:47,579
that could emulate a human brain I would
 

2843
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:49,069
that could emulate a human brain I would
imagine right

2844
00:46:49,069 --> 00:46:49,079
imagine right
 

2845
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:51,170
imagine right
probably the text not there yet but well

2846
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:51,180
probably the text not there yet but well
 

2847
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:53,210
probably the text not there yet but well
the question is what's the level of

2848
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:53,220
the question is what's the level of
 

2849
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:55,069
the question is what's the level of
sophistication of the audience that

2850
00:46:55,069 --> 00:46:55,079
sophistication of the audience that
 

2851
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:56,329
sophistication of the audience that
would recognize that something has

2852
00:46:56,329 --> 00:46:56,339
would recognize that something has
 

2853
00:46:56,339 --> 00:46:57,710
would recognize that something has
changed

2854
00:46:57,710 --> 00:46:57,720
changed
 

2855
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:00,770
changed
like it's the touring test yeah how hard

2856
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:00,780
like it's the touring test yeah how hard
 

2857
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:03,770
like it's the touring test yeah how hard
is it to trick your audience your your

2858
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:03,780
is it to trick your audience your your
 

2859
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:06,530
is it to trick your audience your your
large audience of fans that watch your

2860
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:06,540
large audience of fans that watch your
 

2861
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:09,470
large audience of fans that watch your
streams that when you swap out in the AI

2862
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:09,480
streams that when you swap out in the AI
 

2863
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:12,050
streams that when you swap out in the AI
that emulates you that nothing has

2864
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:12,060
that emulates you that nothing has
 

2865
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:13,069
that emulates you that nothing has
changed

2866
00:47:13,069 --> 00:47:13,079
changed
 

2867
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:15,470
changed
and the question is do you have to

2868
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:15,480
and the question is do you have to
 

2869
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,089
and the question is do you have to
really simulate so much of the human

2870
00:47:17,089 --> 00:47:17,099
really simulate so much of the human
 

2871
00:47:17,099 --> 00:47:19,849
really simulate so much of the human
brain for that I don't think so probably

2872
00:47:19,849 --> 00:47:19,859
brain for that I don't think so probably
 

2873
00:47:19,859 --> 00:47:24,589
brain for that I don't think so probably
not and so I mean like you said a lot of

2874
00:47:24,589 --> 00:47:24,599
not and so I mean like you said a lot of
 

2875
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:26,450
not and so I mean like you said a lot of
political discourses just walking down

2876
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:26,460
political discourses just walking down
 

2877
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:28,490
political discourses just walking down
the tree together so you can probably

2878
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:28,500
the tree together so you can probably
 

2879
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,770
the tree together so you can probably
emulate a lot of that discussion yeah it

2880
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:30,780
emulate a lot of that discussion yeah it
 

2881
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:32,329
emulate a lot of that discussion yeah it
would depend on if you're doing old data

2882
00:47:32,329 --> 00:47:32,339
would depend on if you're doing old data
 

2883
00:47:32,339 --> 00:47:33,770
would depend on if you're doing old data
sets and you're training on that and I'm

2884
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:33,780
sets and you're training on that and I'm
 

2885
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:35,450
sets and you're training on that and I'm
having conversations about abortion and

2886
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:35,460
having conversations about abortion and
 

2887
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:37,130
having conversations about abortion and
Ukrainian vaccines I imagine it could do

2888
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:37,140
Ukrainian vaccines I imagine it could do
 

2889
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:38,569
Ukrainian vaccines I imagine it could do
it for quite a while the only thing that

2890
00:47:38,569 --> 00:47:38,579
it for quite a while the only thing that
 

2891
00:47:38,579 --> 00:47:40,069
it for quite a while the only thing that
would be weird is when novel issues pop

2892
00:47:40,069 --> 00:47:40,079
would be weird is when novel issues pop
 

2893
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:41,510
would be weird is when novel issues pop
up then you probably need a more

2894
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:41,520
up then you probably need a more
 

2895
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,849
up then you probably need a more
sophisticated resemblance of the inner

2896
00:47:43,849 --> 00:47:43,859
sophisticated resemblance of the inner
 

2897
00:47:43,859 --> 00:47:45,410
sophisticated resemblance of the inner
brain right now you have to keep keep

2898
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:45,420
brain right now you have to keep keep
 

2899
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:46,970
brain right now you have to keep keep
training on the internet so how the

2900
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:46,980
training on the internet so how the
 

2901
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:48,290
training on the internet so how the
language models and that's the most

2902
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:48,300
language models and that's the most
 

2903
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:49,790
language models and that's the most
incredible breakthroughs is the language

2904
00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:49,800
incredible breakthroughs is the language
 

2905
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,650
incredible breakthroughs is the language
models you just have to keep retraining

2906
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:51,660
models you just have to keep retraining
 

2907
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:54,770
models you just have to keep retraining
the system on Reddit which is actually

2908
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:54,780
the system on Reddit which is actually
 

2909
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:56,809
the system on Reddit which is actually
what a lot of it is trained on it's just

2910
00:47:56,809 --> 00:47:56,819
what a lot of it is trained on it's just
 

2911
00:47:56,819 --> 00:47:58,130
what a lot of it is trained on it's just
hilarious I do think it's really

2912
00:47:58,130 --> 00:47:58,140
hilarious I do think it's really
 

2913
00:47:58,140 --> 00:47:59,750

interesting that like kind of like funny
problems like the trolley problem that

2916
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:01,380
problems like the trolley problem that
 

2917
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:02,450
problems like the trolley problem that
we can kind of work through our

2918
00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:02,460
we can kind of work through our
 

2919
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:04,250
we can kind of work through our
normative ethical systems on are now

2920
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:04,260
normative ethical systems on are now
 

2921
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:06,109
normative ethical systems on are now
like real questions like if you're

2922
00:48:06,109 --> 00:48:06,119
like real questions like if you're
 

2923
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:07,609
like real questions like if you're
driving a Tesla and it's on autopilot

2924
00:48:07,609 --> 00:48:07,619
driving a Tesla and it's on autopilot
 

2925

and you're going to hit somebody but it
can swerve and hit somebody else like

2928
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:09,900
can swerve and hit somebody else like
 

2929
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:12,109
can swerve and hit somebody else like
what what ought the system do like we

2930
00:48:12,109 --> 00:48:12,119
what what ought the system do like we
 

2931
00:48:12,119 --> 00:48:14,089
what what ought the system do like we
went very quickly from fun kind of like

2932
00:48:14,089 --> 00:48:14,099
went very quickly from fun kind of like
 

2933
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:17,150
went very quickly from fun kind of like
project in philosophy class too we need

2934
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:17,160
project in philosophy class too we need
 

2935
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,410
project in philosophy class too we need
to solve this for insurance purposes

2936
00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:18,420
to solve this for insurance purposes
 

2937
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:20,030
to solve this for insurance purposes
like as quickly as possible it's kind of

like as quickly as possible it's kind of
interesting to think about well I

2940
00:48:21,589 --> 00:48:21,599
interesting to think about well I
 

2941
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,569
interesting to think about well I
actually have uh I'll bring up the

2942
00:48:23,569 --> 00:48:23,579
actually have uh I'll bring up the
 

2943
00:48:23,579 --> 00:48:25,730
actually have uh I'll bring up the
trolley problem with you later there's a

2944
00:48:25,730 --> 00:48:25,740
trolley problem with you later there's a
 

2945
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:27,410
trolley problem with you later there's a
fascinating version of it that I find

2946
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:27,420
fascinating version of it that I find

hilarious okay uh let's let's return to
 

2949
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,750
hilarious okay uh let's let's return to
your low point oh yeah uh

2950
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:32,760
your low point oh yeah uh
 

2951
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,430
your low point oh yeah uh
uh you started playing video games that

2952
00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:34,440
uh you started playing video games that
 

2953
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:36,589
uh you started playing video games that
was a lucky break you uh you did

2954
00:48:36,589 --> 00:48:36,599
was a lucky break you uh you did
 

2955
00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:38,150
was a lucky break you uh you did
text-based ones that was a lucky break

2956
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:38,160
text-based ones that was a lucky break
 

2957
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,589
text-based ones that was a lucky break
because you gotten to be pretty good at

2958
00:48:39,589 --> 00:48:39,599
because you gotten to be pretty good at
 

2959
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:42,410
because you gotten to be pretty good at
learning and then you started thinking

2960
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:42,420
learning and then you started thinking
 

2961
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:43,849
learning and then you started thinking
about going to college and so on what

2962
00:48:43,849 --> 00:48:43,859
about going to college and so on what
 

2963
00:48:43,859 --> 00:48:45,770
about going to college and so on what
happened next I mean I went to like a

2964
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:45,780
happened next I mean I went to like a
 

2965
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,510
happened next I mean I went to like a
prep school so you kind of have to go to

2966

prep school so you kind of have to go to
 

2967
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:48,530
prep school so you kind of have to go to
college after that's like the point

2968
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:48,540
college after that's like the point
 

2969
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:50,329
college after that's like the point
right I was also a millennial they all

um my life was kind of uh it's hard to
 

2977
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,370
um my life was kind of uh it's hard to

25 and older because this is like when
 

3837
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,530
25 and older because this is like when
you're determining the foundations that

3838

you're determining the foundations that
everything's gonna build up yeah 100 so

3840
01:02:18,109 --> 01:02:18,119
everything's gonna build up yeah 100 so
 

3841
01:02:18,119 --> 01:02:21,230
everything's gonna build up yeah 100 so

the liberating aspect of being young is
like anything you learn

3846
01:02:26,809 --> 01:02:26,819
like anything you learn

like anything you learn
so working hard at learning something

3848
01:02:28,910 --> 01:02:28,920
so working hard at learning something
 

3849
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:31,849
so working hard at learning something
will pay off in like non-linear ways

3850
01:02:31,849 --> 01:02:31,859
will pay off in like non-linear ways
 

3851
01:02:31,859 --> 01:02:33,530
will pay off in like non-linear ways
like you said with video games I feel

growing you're learning you're learning
 

3863
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:45,470

a skill you're learning about a thing
 

3865
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:47,569
a skill you're learning about a thing
of course you know you could push back

3866
01:02:47,569 --> 01:02:47,579
of course you know you could push back
 

3867
01:02:47,579 --> 01:02:49,190
of course you know you could push back
and say well there's some trajectories

3868
01:02:49,190 --> 01:02:49,200
and say well there's some trajectories
 

3869
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,990

my feeling is that any word is just a
 

4259
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:29,090
my feeling is that any word is just a
word and if it hurts you that's your

01:09:29,090 --> 01:09:29,100
word and if it hurts you that's your

fault take responsibility for yourself
 

4263
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:32,749
fault take responsibility for yourself
um this probably came from my background

01:09:32,749 --> 01:09:32,759
um this probably came from my background
 

4265
01:09:32,759 --> 01:09:33,890
um this probably came from my background
of being like a really independent

4266
01:09:33,890 --> 01:09:33,900
of being like a really independent
 

4267
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:35,030
of being like a really independent
person so that's just kind of like the

person so that's just kind of like the
 

4269
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:37,849
person so that's just kind of like the
mind that I had for everything and

4270
01:09:37,849 --> 01:09:37,859
mind that I had for everything and
 

4271
01:09:37,859 --> 01:09:39,289

there are basically they were like a

4272
01:09:39,289 --> 01:09:39,299
there are basically they were like a
 

4273
01:09:39,299 --> 01:09:40,669
there are basically they were like a
collection of experiences that I had

4274
01:09:40,669 --> 01:09:40,679
collection of experiences that I had
 

4275
01:09:40,679 --> 01:09:43,070
collection of experiences that I had
that As I Grew I started to realize like

that As I Grew I started to realize like
 

4277
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:45,470
that As I Grew I started to realize like
okay well I feel differently about some

there's a ruthlessness to the language

4374
01:11:14,350 --> 01:11:14,360
there's a ruthlessness to the language
 

4375
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:17,750
there's a ruthlessness to the language
in uh the gaming world yeah and there's

4376
01:11:17,750 --> 01:11:17,760
in uh the gaming world yeah and there's
 

4377
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:19,310
in uh the gaming world yeah and there's
different communities they have

4378
01:11:19,310 --> 01:11:19,320
different communities they have
 

4379
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:23,750
different communities they have
different flavors of language of hate

4380
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:23,760
different flavors of language of hate
 

4381
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:27,050
different flavors of language of hate
speech essentially and uh there's also a

4382
01:11:27,050 --> 01:11:27,060
speech essentially and uh there's also a
 

4383
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:29,510
speech essentially and uh there's also a
humor to it

4384
01:11:29,510 --> 01:11:29,520
humor to it
 

4385
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:31,430
humor to it
which

4386
01:11:31,430 --> 01:11:31,440
which
 

4387
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:34,669
which
really bothers me in a dark way that I

4388
01:11:34,669 --> 01:11:34,679
really bothers me in a dark way that I
 

4389
01:11:34,679 --> 01:11:35,990
really bothers me in a dark way that I
haven't been able to really think

4390
01:11:35,990 --> 01:11:36,000
haven't been able to really think
 

4391
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,130
haven't been able to really think
through

4392
01:11:37,130 --> 01:11:37,140
through
 

4393
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:40,030
through
because humor seems to be a kind of

4394
01:11:40,030 --> 01:11:40,040
because humor seems to be a kind of
 

4395
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:43,130
because humor seems to be a kind of
catalyst for hate it seems to normalize

4396
01:11:43,130 --> 01:11:43,140
catalyst for hate it seems to normalize
 

4397
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:46,070
catalyst for hate it seems to normalize
hate like uh you say

4398

hate like uh you say
 

4399
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:48,770
hate like uh you say
basically it's like Lucy case has a lot

4400
01:11:48,770 --> 01:11:48,780
basically it's like Lucy case has a lot
 

4401
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:51,110
basically it's like Lucy case has a lot
of edgy things but you take something

4402
01:11:51,110 --> 01:11:51,120
of edgy things but you take something
 

4403
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:53,990
of edgy things but you take something
Lucy K says and do it in a non-funny way

4404
01:11:53,990 --> 01:11:54,000
Lucy K says and do it in a non-funny way
 

4405
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,490
Lucy K says and do it in a non-funny way
and do it over and over and over and

4406
01:11:55,490 --> 01:11:55,500
and do it over and over and over and
 

4407
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:59,030
and do it over and over and over and
keep uh increasing the hatefulness of it

4408
01:11:59,030 --> 01:11:59,040
keep uh increasing the hatefulness of it
 

4409
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:02,390
keep uh increasing the hatefulness of it
the vitriol and somehow you find

4410
01:12:02,390 --> 01:12:02,400
the vitriol and somehow you find
 

4411
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,790
the vitriol and somehow you find
yourself like Alice in Wonderland in a

4412
01:12:04,790 --> 01:12:04,800
yourself like Alice in Wonderland in a
 

4413
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,709
yourself like Alice in Wonderland in a
world full of hate where there's no good

4414
01:12:06,709 --> 01:12:06,719
world full of hate where there's no good
 

4415
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:09,229
world full of hate where there's no good
and evil it's all the same in fact the

01:12:09,229 --> 01:12:09,239
and evil it's all the same in fact the
 

4417
01:12:09,239 --> 01:12:10,070
and evil it's all the same in fact the
good

4418
01:12:10,070 --> 01:12:10,080
good
 

4419
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:12,890
good
is to be mocked and the evil is to be

4420
01:12:12,890 --> 01:12:12,900
is to be mocked and the evil is to be
 

4421
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:15,470
is to be mocked and the evil is to be
celebrated for the humor of it basically

4422
01:12:15,470 --> 01:12:15,480
celebrated for the humor of it basically
 

4423
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:18,110
celebrated for the humor of it basically
not taking the ideas of evil seriously

4424
01:12:18,110 --> 01:12:18,120
not taking the ideas of evil seriously
 

4425
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:20,510
not taking the ideas of evil seriously

and I don't know what it it reveals
 

4427
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:21,830
and I don't know what it it reveals
something about human nature that you

01:12:21,830 --> 01:12:21,840
something about human nature that you
 

4429
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:25,010
something about human nature that you
can let go the moral of relativism that

01:12:25,010 --> 01:12:25,020
can let go the moral of relativism that
 

4431
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:26,750
can let go the moral of relativism that
can happen when you do that kind of

4432
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:26,760
can happen when you do that kind of

everything in society is a feedback loop

4808
01:19:01,370 --> 01:19:01,380
everything in society is a feedback loop
 

4809
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:02,870
everything in society is a feedback loop
and that if you're really unhappy with

4810
01:19:02,870 --> 01:19:02,880
and that if you're really unhappy with
 

4811
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:04,189
and that if you're really unhappy with
the state of the media I think that the

4812
01:19:04,189 --> 01:19:04,199
the state of the media I think that the
 

4813
01:19:04,199 --> 01:19:05,390
the state of the media I think that the
media is a good reflection for what

4814
01:19:05,390 --> 01:19:05,400
media is a good reflection for what
 

4815
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:07,070
media is a good reflection for what
people want to see because there is a

4816
01:19:07,070 --> 01:19:07,080
people want to see because there is a
 

4817
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:08,270
people want to see because there is a
room right now in the United States

4818
01:19:08,270 --> 01:19:08,280
room right now in the United States
 

4819
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:09,350
room right now in the United States
where somebody could start a company

4820
01:19:09,350 --> 01:19:09,360
where somebody could start a company
 

4821
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:11,990
where somebody could start a company
where all they do is completely factual

4822
01:19:11,990 --> 01:19:12,000
where all they do is completely factual
 

4823
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,250
where all they do is completely factual
reporting they don't have a political

4824
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:13,260
reporting they don't have a political
 

4825
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:14,630
reporting they don't have a political
slant and they're not giving you these

4826
01:19:14,630 --> 01:19:14,640
slant and they're not giving you these
 

4827
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:15,890
slant and they're not giving you these
like sensationalist narratives or

4828
01:19:15,890 --> 01:19:15,900
like sensationalist narratives or
 

4829
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:17,450
like sensationalist narratives or
stories and that Media Company would

4830
01:19:17,450 --> 01:19:17,460
stories and that Media Company would
 

4831
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:18,530
stories and that Media Company would
fail in two weeks because people don't

4832
01:19:18,530 --> 01:19:18,540
fail in two weeks because people don't
 

4833
01:19:18,540 --> 01:19:20,090
fail in two weeks because people don't
want to see that generally people really

4834
01:19:20,090 --> 01:19:20,100
want to see that generally people really
 

4835

calls the other guy an idiot the guys

4840
01:19:24,350 --> 01:19:24,360
calls the other guy an idiot the guys
 

4841

calls the other guy an idiot the guys
that are screaming on TV or on the radio

4842
01:19:25,790 --> 01:19:25,800
that are screaming on TV or on the radio
 

4843
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:27,530

like this is what I really want
 

4845
01:19:27,540 --> 01:19:29,270
like this is what I really want
um and people will engage in that and

4846
01:19:29,270 --> 01:19:29,280
um and people will engage in that and
 

4847
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:31,130
um and people will engage in that and
that feedback loop will continue for

4848
01:19:31,130 --> 01:19:31,140
that feedback loop will continue for
 

4849
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:32,870
that feedback loop will continue for
generations and then all of a sudden

4850
01:19:32,870 --> 01:19:32,880
generations and then all of a sudden
 

4851
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:34,610
generations and then all of a sudden
people like why is the media so biased

4852
01:19:34,610 --> 01:19:34,620
people like why is the media so biased
 

4853
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:35,990
people like why is the media so biased
why is the media driving so many

4854
01:19:35,990 --> 01:19:36,000
why is the media driving so many
 

4855
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,070
why is the media driving so many
narratives I was like what do you mean

4856
01:19:37,070 --> 01:19:37,080
narratives I was like what do you mean
 

4857
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:38,870
narratives I was like what do you mean
this is exactly what you want to see

4858
01:19:38,870 --> 01:19:38,880
this is exactly what you want to see
 

4859
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,850
this is exactly what you want to see
and that's that's frustrating for me

4860
01:19:40,850 --> 01:19:40,860
and that's that's frustrating for me
 

4861
01:19:40,860 --> 01:19:42,110
and that's that's frustrating for me
that's one of my big kind of when I

4862
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:42,120
that's one of my big kind of when I
 

4863
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:43,669
that's one of my big kind of when I
defend establishments or when I talk

4864
01:19:43,669 --> 01:19:43,679
defend establishments or when I talk
 

4865
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:45,890
defend establishments or when I talk
about like the interplay between Citizen

4866
01:19:45,890 --> 01:19:45,900
about like the interplay between Citizen
 

4867
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:46,850
about like the interplay between Citizen
and

4868
01:19:46,850 --> 01:19:46,860
and
 

4869
01:19:46,860 --> 01:19:49,070
and
and all these institutions we have that

4870
01:19:49,070 --> 01:19:49,080
and all these institutions we have that
 

4871
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:50,630
and all these institutions we have that
the institutions are very much a

4872
01:19:50,630 --> 01:19:50,640
the institutions are very much a
 

4873
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:53,030
the institutions are very much a
reflection of the population at least in

4874
01:19:53,030 --> 01:19:53,040
reflection of the population at least in
 

4875
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:54,890
reflection of the population at least in
Democratic societies and I think that

4876
01:19:54,890 --> 01:19:54,900
Democratic societies and I think that
 

4877
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:56,510
Democratic societies and I think that
people very much try to elude the

4878
01:19:56,510 --> 01:19:56,520
people very much try to elude the
 

4879
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:59,090
people very much try to elude the
personal responsibility or the country's

4880
01:19:59,090 --> 01:19:59,100
personal responsibility or the country's
 

4881
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:00,770
personal responsibility or the country's
responsibility to why some of them look

4882
01:20:00,770 --> 01:20:00,780
responsibility to why some of them look
 

4883
01:20:00,780 --> 01:20:02,870
responsibility to why some of them look
the way that they do

4884
01:20:02,870 --> 01:20:02,880
the way that they do
 

4885
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:04,729
the way that they do
but that takes us back to the n-word

4886
01:20:04,729 --> 01:20:04,739
but that takes us back to the n-word
 

4887
01:20:04,739 --> 01:20:07,550
but that takes us back to the n-word
with a hard R sure why

4888
01:20:07,550 --> 01:20:07,560
with a hard R sure why
 

4889
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:09,470
with a hard R sure why
for the particular examples that I was

4890
01:20:09,470 --> 01:20:09,480
for the particular examples that I was
 

4891
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:10,850
for the particular examples that I was
giving for the particular conversations

4892
01:20:10,850 --> 01:20:10,860
giving for the particular conversations
 

4893
01:20:10,860 --> 01:20:12,649
giving for the particular conversations
that I was having if you're going to

4894
01:20:12,649 --> 01:20:12,659
that I was having if you're going to
 

4895
01:20:12,659 --> 01:20:13,970
that I was having if you're going to
have challenging conversations around

4896
01:20:13,970 --> 01:20:13,980
have challenging conversations around
 

4897
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:15,530
have challenging conversations around
certain words I think you should

4898
01:20:15,530 --> 01:20:15,540
certain words I think you should
 

4899
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:16,850
certain words I think you should
probably be able to say them otherwise

4900
01:20:16,850 --> 01:20:16,860
probably be able to say them otherwise
 

4901
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:18,830
probably be able to say them otherwise
it feels really ridiculous to me that's

4902
01:20:18,830 --> 01:20:18,840
it feels really ridiculous to me that's
 

4903
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:20,689
it feels really ridiculous to me that's
why you still believe that

4904
01:20:20,689 --> 01:20:20,699
why you still believe that
 

4905
01:20:20,699 --> 01:20:23,270
why you still believe that
um for com yes and not like calling

4906
01:20:23,270 --> 01:20:23,280
um for com yes and not like calling
 

4907
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:24,290
um for com yes and not like calling
people those words but having

4908
01:20:24,290 --> 01:20:24,300
people those words but having
 

4909
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:25,910
people those words but having
conversations about those words I would

4910
01:20:25,910 --> 01:20:25,920
conversations about those words I would
 

4911
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:27,770
conversations about those words I would
say that I still believe I am but don't

4912
01:20:27,770 --> 01:20:27,780
say that I still believe I am but don't
 

4913
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:30,050
say that I still believe I am but don't
you think as you said that using those

4914
01:20:30,050 --> 01:20:30,060
you think as you said that using those
 

4915
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:32,110
you think as you said that using those
words

4916
01:20:32,110 --> 01:20:32,120
words
 

4917
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:35,689
words
actually gives motivation and strength

4918
01:20:35,689 --> 01:20:35,699
actually gives motivation and strength
 

4919
01:20:35,699 --> 01:20:37,790
actually gives motivation and strength
to people who have hate in their hearts

4920
01:20:37,790 --> 01:20:37,800
to people who have hate in their hearts
 

4921
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:40,310
to people who have hate in their hearts
I think depending on the context of

4922
01:20:40,310 --> 01:20:40,320
I think depending on the context of
 

4923
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:41,810
I think depending on the context of
what's going on

4924
01:20:41,810 --> 01:20:41,820
what's going on
 

4925
01:20:41,820 --> 01:20:42,950
what's going on
um I think that that's going to be a big

4926
01:20:42,950 --> 01:20:42,960
um I think that that's going to be a big
 

4927
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:45,050
um I think that that's going to be a big
driver in terms of how people are going

4928
01:20:45,050 --> 01:20:45,060
driver in terms of how people are going
 

4929
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:47,149
driver in terms of how people are going
to perceive or take it so in a

4930
01:20:47,149 --> 01:20:47,159
to perceive or take it so in a
 

4931
01:20:47,159 --> 01:20:48,770
to perceive or take it so in a
conversation about the n-word I don't

4932
01:20:48,770 --> 01:20:48,780
conversation about the n-word I don't
 

4933
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:50,090
conversation about the n-word I don't
think I would normally say the n-word we

4934
01:20:50,090 --> 01:20:50,100
think I would normally say the n-word we
 

4935
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:52,250
think I would normally say the n-word we
just talk about the word much the same

4936
01:20:52,250 --> 01:20:52,260
just talk about the word much the same
 

4937
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:53,810
just talk about the word much the same
way that like in um like say like in a

4938
01:20:53,810 --> 01:20:53,820
way that like in um like say like in a
 

4939
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:55,550
way that like in um like say like in a
movie like in Django the people use the

4940
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:55,560
movie like in Django the people use the
 

4941
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:56,990
movie like in Django the people use the
N word should that be censored in that

4942
01:20:56,990 --> 01:20:57,000
N word should that be censored in that
 

4943
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,090
N word should that be censored in that
movie or in the context of that movie is

4944
01:20:59,090 --> 01:20:59,100
movie or in the context of that movie is
 

4945
01:20:59,100 --> 01:21:00,649
movie or in the context of that movie is
it being employed in a way where these

4946
01:21:00,649 --> 01:21:00,659
it being employed in a way where these
 

4947
01:21:00,659 --> 01:21:01,610
it being employed in a way where these
aren't good people you're not supposed

4948
01:21:01,610 --> 01:21:01,620
aren't good people you're not supposed
 

4949
01:21:01,620 --> 01:21:02,630
aren't good people you're not supposed
to like them and that's what the

4950
01:21:02,630 --> 01:21:02,640
to like them and that's what the
 

4951
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:04,130
to like them and that's what the
audience walks away with

4952
01:21:04,130 --> 01:21:04,140
audience walks away with
 

4953
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:05,930
audience walks away with
yeah but that context is different than

4954
01:21:05,930 --> 01:21:05,940
yeah but that context is different than
 

4955
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:07,130
yeah but that context is different than
conversation it feels like in

4956
01:21:07,130 --> 01:21:07,140
conversation it feels like in
 

4957
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:08,290
conversation it feels like in
conversation

4958
01:21:08,290 --> 01:21:08,300
conversation
 

4959
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:12,350
conversation
you using that word normalizes it and

4960
01:21:12,350 --> 01:21:12,360
you using that word normalizes it and
 

4961
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:14,810
you using that word normalizes it and
that normalizing that word is going to

4962
01:21:14,810 --> 01:21:14,820
that normalizing that word is going to
 

4963
01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:16,790
that normalizing that word is going to
make it easier for people who use that

4964
01:21:16,790 --> 01:21:16,800
make it easier for people who use that
 

4965
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:19,729
make it easier for people who use that
word in a hateful way to use it same

4966
01:21:19,729 --> 01:21:19,739
word in a hateful way to use it same
 

4967
01:21:19,739 --> 01:21:23,270
word in a hateful way to use it same
with the f word this the F slur

4968
01:21:23,270 --> 01:21:23,280
with the f word this the F slur
 

4969
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:25,250
with the f word this the F slur
if you use that

4970
01:21:25,250 --> 01:21:25,260
if you use that
 

4971
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:28,490
if you use that
casually and normalize it

4972
01:21:28,490 --> 01:21:28,500
casually and normalize it
 

4973
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:31,430
casually and normalize it
in a way that's not hateful you use in a

4974
01:21:31,430 --> 01:21:31,440
in a way that's not hateful you use in a
 

4975
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:33,890
in a way that's not hateful you use in a
way that's not hateful but you the side

4976
01:21:33,890 --> 01:21:33,900
way that's not hateful but you the side
 

4977
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:35,810
way that's not hateful but you the side
effect is that it normalizes it then

4978
01:21:35,810 --> 01:21:35,820
effect is that it normalizes it then
 

4979
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:37,790
effect is that it normalizes it then
people who do use it in a hateful way

4980
01:21:37,790 --> 01:21:37,800
people who do use it in a hateful way
 

4981
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:41,890
people who do use it in a hateful way
will be more likely to use it therefore

4982
01:21:41,890 --> 01:21:41,900
will be more likely to use it therefore
 

4983
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:43,669
will be more likely to use it therefore
mathematically looking at the equation

4984
01:21:43,669 --> 01:21:43,679
mathematically looking at the equation
 

4985
01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:46,610
mathematically looking at the equation
of the number of times the n-word or the

4986
01:21:46,610 --> 01:21:46,620
of the number of times the n-word or the
 

4987
01:21:46,620 --> 01:21:48,950
of the number of times the n-word or the
f word is used throughout the world it

4988
01:21:48,950 --> 01:21:48,960
f word is used throughout the world it
 

4989
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:50,030
f word is used throughout the world it
increases the number of times it's used

4990
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:50,040
increases the number of times it's used
 

4991
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:52,370
increases the number of times it's used
in a hateful way yeah I think the human

4992
01:21:52,370 --> 01:21:52,380
in a hateful way yeah I think the human
 

4993
01:21:52,380 --> 01:21:54,110
in a hateful way yeah I think the human
and you're part of that problem Stephen

4994
01:21:54,110 --> 01:21:54,120
and you're part of that problem Stephen
 

4995
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:55,970
and you're part of that problem Stephen
I don't I don't agree I understand I

4996
01:21:55,970 --> 01:21:55,980
I don't I don't agree I understand I
 

4997
01:21:55,980 --> 01:21:57,649
I don't I don't agree I understand I
understand the thought process

4998
01:21:57,649 --> 01:21:57,659
understand the thought process
 

4999
01:21:57,659 --> 01:21:59,689
understand the thought process
um but I don't know if using certain

5000
01:21:59,689 --> 01:21:59,699
um but I don't know if using certain
 

5001
01:21:59,699 --> 01:22:03,169
um but I don't know if using certain
words within different contexts is going

5002
01:22:03,169 --> 01:22:03,179
words within different contexts is going
 

5003
01:22:03,179 --> 01:22:04,910
words within different contexts is going
to necessarily normalize like the

5004
01:22:04,910 --> 01:22:04,920
to necessarily normalize like the
 

5005
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:06,890
to necessarily normalize like the
hateful use of that word

5006
01:22:06,890 --> 01:22:06,900
hateful use of that word
 

5007
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:08,810
hateful use of that word
um that is an argument that I've heard

5008
01:22:08,810 --> 01:22:08,820
um that is an argument that I've heard
 

5009
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:10,669
um that is an argument that I've heard
people use somebody will say like okay

5010
01:22:10,669 --> 01:22:10,679
people use somebody will say like okay
 

5011
01:22:10,679 --> 01:22:12,110
people use somebody will say like okay
well hold on that should never be used

5012
01:22:12,110 --> 01:22:12,120
well hold on that should never be used
 

5013
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:14,209
well hold on that should never be used
ever because by virtue of you

5014
01:22:14,209 --> 01:22:14,219
ever because by virtue of you
 

5015
01:22:14,219 --> 01:22:16,189
ever because by virtue of you
normalizing it even in an inoffensive

5016
01:22:16,189 --> 01:22:16,199
normalizing it even in an inoffensive
 

5017
01:22:16,199 --> 01:22:17,990
normalizing it even in an inoffensive
environment you increase the proclivity

5018
01:22:17,990 --> 01:22:18,000
environment you increase the proclivity
 

5019
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,729
environment you increase the proclivity
for people to use it in a potentially

5020
01:22:19,729 --> 01:22:19,739
for people to use it in a potentially
 

5021
01:22:19,739 --> 01:22:21,169
for people to use it in a potentially
more offensive environment and my

5022
01:22:21,169 --> 01:22:21,179
more offensive environment and my
 

5023
01:22:21,179 --> 01:22:22,550
more offensive environment and my
argument is always like no I don't think

5024
01:22:22,550 --> 01:22:22,560
argument is always like no I don't think
 

5025
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:24,229
argument is always like no I don't think
that crossover exists but if you did

5026
01:22:24,229 --> 01:22:24,239
that crossover exists but if you did
 

5027
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:25,669
that crossover exists but if you did
want to take that argument and maybe you

5028
01:22:25,669 --> 01:22:25,679
want to take that argument and maybe you
 

5029
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:27,110
want to take that argument and maybe you
do feel this way I think that you get

5030
01:22:27,110 --> 01:22:27,120
do feel this way I think that you get
 

5031
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:28,370
do feel this way I think that you get
really problematic when you run into

5032
01:22:28,370 --> 01:22:28,380
really problematic when you run into
 

5033
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:29,990
really problematic when you run into
communities that do use certain words

5034
01:22:29,990 --> 01:22:30,000
communities that do use certain words
 

5035
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,010
communities that do use certain words
that people would say well they should

5036
01:22:31,010 --> 01:22:31,020
that people would say well they should
 

5037
01:22:31,020 --> 01:22:32,570
that people would say well they should
be allowed to do it so for instance if

5038
01:22:32,570 --> 01:22:32,580
be allowed to do it so for instance if
 

5039
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:33,830
be allowed to do it so for instance if
you think that any utterance of the

5040
01:22:33,830 --> 01:22:33,840
you think that any utterance of the
 

5041
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:35,450
you think that any utterance of the
n-word at all is highly problematic it

5042
01:22:35,450 --> 01:22:35,460
n-word at all is highly problematic it
 

5043
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:37,130
n-word at all is highly problematic it
might increase hatred then like the

5044
01:22:37,130 --> 01:22:37,140
might increase hatred then like the
 

5045
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:38,630
might increase hatred then like the
entire rap industry has to dramatically

5046
01:22:38,630 --> 01:22:38,640
entire rap industry has to dramatically
 

5047
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:39,830
entire rap industry has to dramatically
change the way that they engage with the

5048
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:39,840
change the way that they engage with the
 

5049
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:41,209
change the way that they engage with the
n-word and obviously a lot of people

5050
01:22:41,209 --> 01:22:41,219
n-word and obviously a lot of people
 

5051
01:22:41,219 --> 01:22:42,890
n-word and obviously a lot of people
that criticize people's use of the

5052
01:22:42,890 --> 01:22:42,900
that criticize people's use of the
 

5053
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:44,330
that criticize people's use of the
n-word aren't going to turn to rappers

5054
01:22:44,330 --> 01:22:44,340
n-word aren't going to turn to rappers
 

5055
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:45,410
n-word aren't going to turn to rappers
and say well you guys can't say it

5056
01:22:45,410 --> 01:22:45,420
and say well you guys can't say it
 

5057
01:22:45,420 --> 01:22:48,290
and say well you guys can't say it
either no it's who I mean it's who uses

5058
01:22:48,290 --> 01:22:48,300
either no it's who I mean it's who uses
 

5059
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:50,390
either no it's who I mean it's who uses
the n-word that's what it's not so it's

5060
01:22:50,390 --> 01:22:50,400
the n-word that's what it's not so it's
 

5061
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:52,790
the n-word that's what it's not so it's
not just the word it's the

5062
01:22:52,790 --> 01:22:52,800
not just the word it's the
 

5063
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:57,530
not just the word it's the
the it it is context dependent uh but I

5064
01:22:57,530 --> 01:22:57,540
the it it is context dependent uh but I
 

5065
01:22:57,540 --> 01:22:59,930
the it it is context dependent uh but I
would say that you as a white person

5066
01:22:59,930 --> 01:22:59,940
would say that you as a white person
 

5067
01:22:59,940 --> 01:23:03,169
would say that you as a white person
having conversations

5068
01:23:03,169 --> 01:23:03,179
having conversations
 

5069
01:23:03,179 --> 01:23:05,689
having conversations
the context there is the kind that would

5070
01:23:05,689 --> 01:23:05,699
the context there is the kind that would
 

5071
01:23:05,699 --> 01:23:07,669
the context there is the kind that would
lead to an increase in hate do you think

5072
01:23:07,669 --> 01:23:07,679
lead to an increase in hate do you think
 

5073
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:08,810
lead to an increase in hate do you think
the N word should be censored in the

5074
01:23:08,810 --> 01:23:08,820
the N word should be censored in the
 

5075
01:23:08,820 --> 01:23:11,510
the N word should be censored in the
dictionary no and I believe there's a

5076
01:23:11,510 --> 01:23:11,520
dictionary no and I believe there's a
 

5077
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,130
dictionary no and I believe there's a
Wikipedia page on it and it's not

5078
01:23:13,130 --> 01:23:13,140
Wikipedia page on it and it's not
 

5079
01:23:13,140 --> 01:23:15,830
Wikipedia page on it and it's not
censored uh yeah I think it should be in

5080
01:23:15,830 --> 01:23:15,840
censored uh yeah I think it should be in
 

5081
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,750
censored uh yeah I think it should be in
the dictionary I think the context of

5082
01:23:17,750 --> 01:23:17,760
the dictionary I think the context of
 

5083
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:19,910
the dictionary I think the context of
casual conversation

5084
01:23:19,910 --> 01:23:19,920
casual conversation
 

5085
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:22,370
casual conversation
like like I said I just believe that on

5086
01:23:22,370 --> 01:23:22,380
like like I said I just believe that on
 

5087
01:23:22,380 --> 01:23:23,750
like like I said I just believe that on
the internet

5088
01:23:23,750 --> 01:23:23,760
the internet
 

5089
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:27,169
the internet
having humor having fun conversations as

5090
01:23:27,169 --> 01:23:27,179
having humor having fun conversations as
 

5091
01:23:27,179 --> 01:23:30,310
having humor having fun conversations as
you have on your streams

5092
01:23:30,310 --> 01:23:30,320
you have on your streams
 

5093
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:32,990
you have on your streams
that leads to the normalization of the

5094
01:23:32,990 --> 01:23:33,000
that leads to the normalization of the
 

5095
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,649
that leads to the normalization of the
word without any educational value

5096
01:23:35,649 --> 01:23:35,659
word without any educational value
 

5097
01:23:35,659 --> 01:23:37,669
word without any educational value
I think I would I think I would agree

5098
01:23:37,669 --> 01:23:37,679
I think I would I think I would agree
 

5099
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:39,169
I think I would I think I would agree
with that no sorry so there's a

5100
01:23:39,169 --> 01:23:39,179
with that no sorry so there's a
 

5101
01:23:39,179 --> 01:23:41,630
with that no sorry so there's a
difference between absolar and n-word

5102
01:23:41,630 --> 01:23:41,640
difference between absolar and n-word
 

5103
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:43,550
difference between absolar and n-word
and both I think

5104
01:23:43,550 --> 01:23:43,560
and both I think
 

5105
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:46,669
and both I think
should not be used in a fun way but the

5106
01:23:46,669 --> 01:23:46,679
should not be used in a fun way but the
 

5107
01:23:46,679 --> 01:23:48,709
should not be used in a fun way but the
f word was used in the fun way for the

5108
01:23:48,709 --> 01:23:48,719
f word was used in the fun way for the
 

5109
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:51,590
f word was used in the fun way for the
longest time for sure uh and I I'll tell

5110
01:23:51,590 --> 01:23:51,600
longest time for sure uh and I I'll tell
 

5111
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:53,030
longest time for sure uh and I I'll tell
you something that bothers me about your

5112
01:23:53,030 --> 01:23:53,040
you something that bothers me about your
 

5113
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:56,510
you something that bothers me about your
streams not your your streams and

5114
01:23:56,510 --> 01:23:56,520
streams not your your streams and
 

5115
01:23:56,520 --> 01:23:59,330
streams not your your streams and
basically every other stream is the the

5116
01:23:59,330 --> 01:23:59,340
basically every other stream is the the
 

5117
01:23:59,340 --> 01:24:01,970
basically every other stream is the the
Casual use of the r word oh the ableism

5118
01:24:01,970 --> 01:24:01,980

conversation through debate through
effective discourse yeah so I guess I'm

5280
01:27:10,910 --> 01:27:10,920
effective discourse yeah so I guess I'm
 

5281
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:12,530
effective discourse yeah so I guess I'm
just calling you out that I I think

5282
01:27:12,530 --> 01:27:12,540
just calling you out that I I think
 

5283
01:27:12,540 --> 01:27:15,169
just calling you out that I I think
using our word for me personally as a

5284
01:27:15,169 --> 01:27:15,179
using our word for me personally as a
 

5285
01:27:15,179 --> 01:27:18,010
using our word for me personally as a
fan that that believes in your mission

5286
01:27:18,010 --> 01:27:18,020
fan that that believes in your mission
 

5287
01:27:18,020 --> 01:27:20,649
fan that that believes in your mission
it just makes you look

5288
01:27:20,649 --> 01:27:20,659
it just makes you look
 

5289
01:27:20,659 --> 01:27:23,510
it just makes you look
ineffective and bad and uninspiring to

5290
01:27:23,510 --> 01:27:23,520
ineffective and bad and uninspiring to
 

5291
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:25,250
ineffective and bad and uninspiring to
young people that look up to you because

5292
01:27:25,250 --> 01:27:25,260
young people that look up to you because
 

5293
01:27:25,260 --> 01:27:26,930
young people that look up to you because
those young people are going to use

5294
01:27:26,930 --> 01:27:26,940
those young people are going to use
 

5295
01:27:26,940 --> 01:27:28,910
those young people are going to use
those words that you're using and

5296
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:28,920
those words that you're using and
 

5297
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:30,950
those words that you're using and
they'll do it much less effectively sure

5298
01:27:30,950 --> 01:27:30,960
they'll do it much less effectively sure
 

5299
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:32,810
they'll do it much less effectively sure
this the problem yeah I guess the

5300
01:27:32,810 --> 01:27:32,820
this the problem yeah I guess the
 

5301
01:27:32,820 --> 01:27:34,010
this the problem yeah I guess the
challenge is always just like finding

5302
01:27:34,010 --> 01:27:34,020
challenge is always just like finding
 

5303

01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:43,030
of robots
and that might be a compliment soon

5882
01:37:43,030 --> 01:37:43,040
and that might be a compliment soon
 

5883
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:45,770
and that might be a compliment soon
exactly what I guess bot means you don't

5884
01:37:45,770 --> 01:37:45,780
exactly what I guess bot means you don't
 

5885
01:37:45,780 --> 01:37:47,689
exactly what I guess bot means you don't
think yeah you're like an NPC you're

01:37:49,250 --> 01:37:49,260
just kind of interesting again I'm
 

5889
01:37:49,260 --> 01:37:51,229
just kind of interesting again I'm
offended on behalf of NPCs I I count

5890
01:37:51,229 --> 01:37:51,239
offended on behalf of NPCs I I count
 

5891
01:37:51,239 --> 01:37:53,629
offended on behalf of NPCs I I count
myself as one but there's a sense if you

5892
01:37:53,629 --> 01:37:53,639
myself as one but there's a sense if you
 

5893
01:37:53,639 --> 01:37:55,669
myself as one but there's a sense if you
say Bots too much

5894
01:37:55,669 --> 01:37:55,679
say Bots too much
 

5895
01:37:55,679 --> 01:37:59,030
say Bots too much
that you're just dismissing people like

5896
01:37:59,030 --> 01:37:59,040
that you're just dismissing people like
 

5897
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:02,209
that you're just dismissing people like
everything I say is right and anyone

5898
01:38:02,209 --> 01:38:02,219
everything I say is right and anyone
 

5899
01:38:02,219 --> 01:38:04,610
everything I say is right and anyone
that disagrees with me is a bot that

5900
01:38:04,610 --> 01:38:04,620
that disagrees with me is a bot that
 

5901
01:38:04,620 --> 01:38:06,709
that disagrees with me is a bot that
that's lazy too sometimes you're funny

5902
01:38:06,709 --> 01:38:06,719
that's lazy too sometimes you're funny
 

5903
01:38:06,719 --> 01:38:09,290
that's lazy too sometimes you're funny
sometimes it's effective uh basically

5904
01:38:09,290 --> 01:38:09,300
sometimes it's effective uh basically
 

5905
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:10,970
sometimes it's effective uh basically
saying a lot of people in the mainstream

5906
01:38:10,970 --> 01:38:10,980
saying a lot of people in the mainstream
 

5907
01:38:10,980 --> 01:38:12,169
saying a lot of people in the mainstream
Media or something like that are Bots

5908
01:38:12,169 --> 01:38:12,179
Media or something like that are Bots
 

5909
01:38:12,179 --> 01:38:14,149
Media or something like that are Bots
okay that's a little bit of that is

5910
01:38:14,149 --> 01:38:14,159
okay that's a little bit of that is
 

5911
01:38:14,159 --> 01:38:17,330
okay that's a little bit of that is
effective but too much it becomes

5912
01:38:17,330 --> 01:38:17,340
effective but too much it becomes
 

5913
01:38:17,340 --> 01:38:19,430
effective but too much it becomes
ineffective and I'm trying to speak to

5914
01:38:19,430 --> 01:38:19,440
ineffective and I'm trying to speak to
 

5915
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:21,530
ineffective and I'm trying to speak to
that yeah and I'm just the reason we're

5916
01:38:21,530 --> 01:38:21,540
that yeah and I'm just the reason we're
 

5917
01:38:21,540 --> 01:38:24,649
that yeah and I'm just the reason we're
highlighting clear examples like the

5918
01:38:24,649 --> 01:38:24,659
highlighting clear examples like the
 

5919
01:38:24,659 --> 01:38:25,910
highlighting clear examples like the
n-word

5920
01:38:25,910 --> 01:38:25,920
n-word
 

5921
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:28,070
n-word
uh Joe Rogan had to contend with that

5922
01:38:28,070 --> 01:38:28,080
uh Joe Rogan had to contend with that
 

5923
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:29,689
uh Joe Rogan had to contend with that
all right yeah

5924
01:38:29,689 --> 01:38:29,699
all right yeah
 

5925
01:38:29,699 --> 01:38:31,490
all right yeah
I think it's ineffective it makes you

5926
01:38:31,490 --> 01:38:31,500
I think it's ineffective it makes you
 

5927
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:34,430
I think it's ineffective it makes you
less effective at this course I but like

5928
01:38:34,430 --> 01:38:34,440
less effective at this course I but like
 

5929
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:35,750
less effective at this course I but like
like you've talked about many times

5930
01:38:35,750 --> 01:38:35,760
like you've talked about many times
 

5931
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:37,910
like you've talked about many times
language is a tricky one it's always

5932
01:38:37,910 --> 01:38:37,920
language is a tricky one it's always
 

5933
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:38,870
language is a tricky one it's always
hard because you talk about like

5934
01:38:38,870 --> 01:38:38,880
hard because you talk about like
 

5935
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:40,430
hard because you talk about like
constructing a Melody there's not one

5936
01:38:40,430 --> 01:38:40,440
constructing a Melody there's not one
 

5937
01:38:40,440 --> 01:38:42,649
constructing a Melody there's not one
Melody that sounds good to everyone

5938
01:38:42,649 --> 01:38:42,659
Melody that sounds good to everyone
 

5939
01:38:42,659 --> 01:38:44,270
Melody that sounds good to everyone
but there are probably certain notes

5940
01:38:44,270 --> 01:38:44,280
but there are probably certain notes
 

5941
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:45,850
but there are probably certain notes
that like if you got rid of them

5942
01:38:45,850 --> 01:38:45,860
that like if you got rid of them
 

5943
01:38:45,860 --> 01:38:47,629
that like if you got rid of them
everybody's still going to like it about

5944
01:38:47,629 --> 01:38:47,639
everybody's still going to like it about
 

5945
01:38:47,639 --> 01:38:48,770
everybody's still going to like it about
as much and you don't really lose

5946
01:38:48,770 --> 01:38:48,780
as much and you don't really lose
 

5947
01:38:48,780 --> 01:38:49,970
as much and you don't really lose
anything there's a whole other part of

5948
01:38:49,970 --> 01:38:49,980
anything there's a whole other part of
 

5949
01:38:49,980 --> 01:38:51,530
anything there's a whole other part of
an audience that might be more willing

5950
01:38:51,530 --> 01:38:51,540
an audience that might be more willing
 

5951
01:38:51,540 --> 01:38:53,149
an audience that might be more willing
to listen yeah of course and it's not

5952
01:38:53,149 --> 01:38:53,159
to listen yeah of course and it's not
 

5953
01:38:53,159 --> 01:38:55,010
to listen yeah of course and it's not
about losing the magic of that Melody

5954
01:38:55,010 --> 01:38:55,020
about losing the magic of that Melody
 

5955
01:38:55,020 --> 01:38:57,129
about losing the magic of that Melody
like you don't want to be vanilla

5956
01:38:57,129 --> 01:38:57,139
like you don't want to be vanilla
 

5957
01:38:57,139 --> 01:38:59,209
like you don't want to be vanilla
I just feel like there's stuff that

5958
01:38:59,209 --> 01:38:59,219
I just feel like there's stuff that
 

5959
01:38:59,219 --> 01:39:00,950
I just feel like there's stuff that
doesn't need to be there yeah for sure

5960
01:39:00,950 --> 01:39:00,960
doesn't need to be there yeah for sure
 

5961
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:03,950
doesn't need to be there yeah for sure
it's fat but then again you're the other

5962
01:39:03,950 --> 01:39:03,960
it's fat but then again you're the other
 

5963
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:05,930
it's fat but then again you're the other
thing that people should understand

5964
01:39:05,930 --> 01:39:05,940
thing that people should understand
 

5965
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:07,910
thing that people should understand
that might be listening to this you're

5966
01:39:07,910 --> 01:39:07,920
that might be listening to this you're
 

5967
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:10,189
that might be listening to this you're
streaming many hours a day

5968
01:39:10,189 --> 01:39:10,199
streaming many hours a day
 

5969
01:39:10,199 --> 01:39:12,770
streaming many hours a day
for many years I don't know it's 11 or

5970
01:39:12,770 --> 01:39:12,780
for many years I don't know it's 11 or
 

5971
01:39:12,780 --> 01:39:14,930
for many years I don't know it's 11 or
12 I think yeah I started in 2010. and

5972
01:39:14,930 --> 01:39:14,940
12 I think yeah I started in 2010. and
 

5973
01:39:14,940 --> 01:39:16,310
12 I think yeah I started in 2010. and
so one of the things that people can do

5974
01:39:16,310 --> 01:39:16,320
so one of the things that people can do
 

5975
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:18,950
so one of the things that people can do
is just clip out anything you're going

5976
01:39:18,950 --> 01:39:18,960
is just clip out anything you're going
 

5977
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:21,050
is just clip out anything you're going
through the full Human Experience of

5978
01:39:21,050 --> 01:39:21,060
through the full Human Experience of
 

5979
01:39:21,060 --> 01:39:25,370
through the full Human Experience of
emotion anger fear frustration all of it

5980
01:39:25,370 --> 01:39:25,380
emotion anger fear frustration all of it
 

5981
01:39:25,380 --> 01:39:27,770
emotion anger fear frustration all of it
so of course there's going to be moments

5982
01:39:27,770 --> 01:39:27,780
so of course there's going to be moments
 

5983
01:39:27,780 --> 01:39:28,970
so of course there's going to be moments
when you're not the best version of

5984
01:39:28,970 --> 01:39:28,980
when you're not the best version of
 

5985
01:39:28,980 --> 01:39:30,709
when you're not the best version of
yourself

5986
01:39:30,709 --> 01:39:30,719
yourself
 

5987
01:39:30,719 --> 01:39:32,570
yourself
anything else to say about the language

5988
01:39:32,570 --> 01:39:32,580
anything else to say about the language
 

5989
01:39:32,580 --> 01:39:35,330
anything else to say about the language
it's complicated I'm still always trying

5990
01:39:35,330 --> 01:39:35,340
it's complicated I'm still always trying
 

5991
01:39:35,340 --> 01:39:36,649
it's complicated I'm still always trying
to figure it out you know there are

5992
01:39:36,649 --> 01:39:36,659
to figure it out you know there are
 

5993
01:39:36,659 --> 01:39:37,910
to figure it out you know there are
opinions that I have that have changed

5994
01:39:37,910 --> 01:39:37,920
opinions that I have that have changed
 

5995
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:39,830
opinions that I have that have changed
throughout the years it's possible that

5996
01:39:39,830 --> 01:39:39,840
throughout the years it's possible that
 

5997
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:41,450
throughout the years it's possible that
the r word has always been the next one

5998
01:39:41,450 --> 01:39:41,460
the r word has always been the next one
 

5999
01:39:41,460 --> 01:39:42,649
the r word has always been the next one
on the chopping block that we're all

6000
01:39:42,649 --> 01:39:42,659
on the chopping block that we're all
 

6001
01:39:42,659 --> 01:39:43,669
on the chopping block that we're all
kind of looking at but people always

6002
01:39:43,669 --> 01:39:43,679
kind of looking at but people always
 

6003
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:45,470
kind of looking at but people always
worried about that treadmill but it's

6004
01:39:45,470 --> 01:39:45,480
worried about that treadmill but it's
 

6005
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:46,550
worried about that treadmill but it's
possible in a year or two I'll have a

6006
01:39:46,550 --> 01:39:46,560
possible in a year or two I'll have a
 

6007
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:47,750
possible in a year or two I'll have a
different view on it or I'll have

6008
01:39:47,750 --> 01:39:47,760
different view on it or I'll have
 

6009
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:49,910
different view on it or I'll have
changed away some of the words I use and

6010
01:39:49,910 --> 01:39:49,920
changed away some of the words I use and
 

6011
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:51,590
changed away some of the words I use and
that um yeah it's definitely like a it's

um something you said earlier is very
 

6049
01:40:25,320 --> 01:40:26,629
um something you said earlier is very
true I think the goal is to like

6052
01:40:28,250 --> 01:40:28,260
identify what are the elements that you
 

6053
01:40:28,260 --> 01:40:30,229
identify what are the elements that you
can cut out that aren't integral to your

more people and those are probably the

more people and those are probably the
 

6059
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:36,470
more people and those are probably the
things that you identify but I think

6060

things that you identify but I think
 

6061
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:38,330
things that you identify but I think
that you can get lost in yourself or

maybe although you're talking about more

6238
01:43:36,169 --> 01:43:36,179
maybe although you're talking about more
 

6239
01:43:36,179 --> 01:43:38,090
maybe although you're talking about more
more recording and more stuff which

6240
01:43:38,090 --> 01:43:38,100
more recording and more stuff which
 

6241
01:43:38,100 --> 01:43:40,149
more recording and more stuff which
people are already wary of but um it's a

6242
01:43:40,149 --> 01:43:40,159
people are already wary of but um it's a
 

6243
01:43:40,159 --> 01:43:43,129
people are already wary of but um it's a
double-edged sword I think there's there

6244
01:43:43,129 --> 01:43:43,139
double-edged sword I think there's there
 

6245
01:43:43,139 --> 01:43:44,510
double-edged sword I think there's there
is going to be more and more recording

6246
01:43:44,510 --> 01:43:44,520
is going to be more and more recording
 

6247
01:43:44,520 --> 01:43:45,830
is going to be more and more recording
we have to figure out how to do that in

6248
01:43:45,830 --> 01:43:45,840
we have to figure out how to do that in
 

6249
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:47,990
we have to figure out how to do that in
a way that respects people privacy and

6250
01:43:47,990 --> 01:43:48,000
a way that respects people privacy and

gives them ownership of their data and
so on I've looked at the search history

6254
01:43:51,590 --> 01:43:51,600
so on I've looked at the search history
 

6255
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:53,510
so on I've looked at the search history
I've done on Google which for most

6256

01:45:08,460 --> 01:45:09,830
and how can you fight it because you've
you've shown

6340
01:45:09,830 --> 01:45:09,840
you've shown
 

6341
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:12,290
you've shown
a lot of interest in fighting it trying

6342
01:45:12,290 --> 01:45:12,300
a lot of interest in fighting it trying
 

6343
01:45:12,300 --> 01:45:14,810
a lot of interest in fighting it trying
to decrease or eliminate misogyny from

6344
01:45:14,810 --> 01:45:14,820
to decrease or eliminate misogyny from
 

6345
01:45:14,820 --> 01:45:15,830
to decrease or eliminate misogyny from
your community

6346
01:45:15,830 --> 01:45:15,840
your community
 

6347
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:17,930
your community
I think it's really difficult I think

6348
01:45:17,930 --> 01:45:17,940
I think it's really difficult I think
 

6349
01:45:17,940 --> 01:45:19,609
I think it's really difficult I think
that eliminating racism is easier than

6350
01:45:19,609 --> 01:45:19,619
that eliminating racism is easier than
 

6351
01:45:19,619 --> 01:45:22,189
that eliminating racism is easier than
eliminating misogyny because on the

6352
01:45:22,189 --> 01:45:22,199
eliminating misogyny because on the
 

6353
01:45:22,199 --> 01:45:24,470
eliminating misogyny because on the
internet you mean on anywhere because I

6354
01:45:24,470 --> 01:45:24,480
internet you mean on anywhere because I
 

6355
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:25,850
internet you mean on anywhere because I
think fundamentally I don't think

6356
01:45:25,850 --> 01:45:25,860
think fundamentally I don't think
 

6357
01:45:25,860 --> 01:45:26,450
think fundamentally I don't think
there's that much difference between

6358
01:45:26,450 --> 01:45:26,460
there's that much difference between
 

6359
01:45:26,460 --> 01:45:28,129
there's that much difference between
like white people and black people and

6360
01:45:28,129 --> 01:45:28,139
like white people and black people and
 

6361
01:45:28,139 --> 01:45:29,270
like white people and black people and
brown people and Asian people or

6362
01:45:29,270 --> 01:45:29,280
brown people and Asian people or
 

6363
01:45:29,280 --> 01:45:30,709
brown people and Asian people or
whatever you know we have different

6364
01:45:30,709 --> 01:45:30,719
whatever you know we have different
 

6365
01:45:30,719 --> 01:45:31,970
whatever you know we have different
cultures and stuff but at the end of the

6366
01:45:31,970 --> 01:45:31,980
cultures and stuff but at the end of the
 

6367
01:45:31,980 --> 01:45:33,229
cultures and stuff but at the end of the
day we're all people

6368
01:45:33,229 --> 01:45:33,239
day we're all people
 

6369
01:45:33,239 --> 01:45:34,910
day we're all people
but I think there are differences

6370
01:45:34,910 --> 01:45:34,920
but I think there are differences
 

6371
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:37,189
but I think there are differences
between men and women like throughout

6372
01:45:37,189 --> 01:45:37,199
between men and women like throughout
 

6373
01:45:37,199 --> 01:45:38,930
between men and women like throughout
all of you like all of history and time

6374
01:45:38,930 --> 01:45:38,940
all of you like all of history and time
 

6375
01:45:38,940 --> 01:45:41,270
all of you like all of history and time
and then even today in every culture and

6376
01:45:41,270 --> 01:45:41,280
and then even today in every culture and
 

6377
01:45:41,280 --> 01:45:43,189
and then even today in every culture and
when when real differences do exist it's

6378
01:45:43,189 --> 01:45:43,199
when when real differences do exist it's
 

6379
01:45:43,199 --> 01:45:44,810
when when real differences do exist it's
harder to account for them in a way that

6380
01:45:44,810 --> 01:45:44,820
harder to account for them in a way that
 

6381
01:45:44,820 --> 01:45:46,070
harder to account for them in a way that
can we have conversations with each

6382
01:45:46,070 --> 01:45:46,080
can we have conversations with each
 

6383
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:48,229
can we have conversations with each
other without it becoming very gendered

6384
01:45:48,229 --> 01:45:48,239
other without it becoming very gendered
 

6385
01:45:48,239 --> 01:45:50,570
other without it becoming very gendered
in a negative way right negative way of

6386
01:45:50,570 --> 01:45:50,580
in a negative way right negative way of
 

6387
01:45:50,580 --> 01:45:51,950
in a negative way right negative way of
generating something like a misogynistic

6388
01:45:51,950 --> 01:45:51,960
generating something like a misogynistic
 

6389
01:45:51,960 --> 01:45:54,290
generating something like a misogynistic
way of doing it of course

6390
01:45:54,290 --> 01:45:54,300
way of doing it of course
 

6391
01:45:54,300 --> 01:45:56,990
way of doing it of course
it's unclear to me that it's so

6392
01:45:56,990 --> 01:45:57,000
it's unclear to me that it's so
 

6393
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,090
it's unclear to me that it's so
difficult to um

6394
01:45:59,090 --> 01:45:59,100
difficult to um
 

6395
01:45:59,100 --> 01:46:01,430
difficult to um
to avoid the negative gendering versus

6396
01:46:01,430 --> 01:46:01,440
to avoid the negative gendering versus
 

6397
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:03,229
to avoid the negative gendering versus
the positive because there's a lot of

6398
01:46:03,229 --> 01:46:03,239
the positive because there's a lot of
 

6399
01:46:03,239 --> 01:46:05,030
the positive because there's a lot of
positive to the the tension the dance

6400
01:46:05,030 --> 01:46:05,040
positive to the the tension the dance
 

6401
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:06,530
positive to the the tension the dance
between the different genders and so on

6402
01:46:06,530 --> 01:46:06,540
between the different genders and so on
 

6403
01:46:06,540 --> 01:46:08,209
between the different genders and so on
maybe in this particular moment in

6404
01:46:08,209 --> 01:46:08,219
maybe in this particular moment in
 

6405
01:46:08,219 --> 01:46:11,330
maybe in this particular moment in
history it's not but it's not trivial to

6406
01:46:11,330 --> 01:46:11,340
history it's not but it's not trivial to
 

6407
01:46:11,340 --> 01:46:13,010
history it's not but it's not trivial to
me that racism is easier to eliminate

6408
01:46:13,010 --> 01:46:13,020
me that racism is easier to eliminate
 

6409
01:46:13,020 --> 01:46:15,229
me that racism is easier to eliminate
it's an interesting hypothesis just

6410
01:46:15,229 --> 01:46:15,239
it's an interesting hypothesis just
 

6411
01:46:15,239 --> 01:46:16,490
it's an interesting hypothesis just
because there's more biological

6412
01:46:16,490 --> 01:46:16,500
because there's more biological
 

6413
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:18,890
because there's more biological
difference between men and women that

6414
01:46:18,890 --> 01:46:18,900
difference between men and women that
 

6415
01:46:18,900 --> 01:46:20,990
difference between men and women that
means it's harder to eliminate but I

6416
01:46:20,990 --> 01:46:21,000
means it's harder to eliminate but I
 

6417
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:22,129
means it's harder to eliminate but I
don't know if there's a Troy I hear this

6418
01:46:22,129 --> 01:46:22,139
don't know if there's a Troy I hear this
 

6419
01:46:22,139 --> 01:46:23,090
don't know if there's a Troy I hear this
a lot I feel like I've read the story

6420
01:46:23,090 --> 01:46:23,100
a lot I feel like I've read the story
 

6421
01:46:23,100 --> 01:46:24,350
a lot I feel like I've read the story
but I need to get a better Source if I

6422
01:46:24,350 --> 01:46:24,360
but I need to get a better Source if I
 

6423
01:46:24,360 --> 01:46:25,370
but I need to get a better Source if I
repeat it everywhere but I've heard that

6424
01:46:25,370 --> 01:46:25,380
repeat it everywhere but I've heard that
 

6425
01:46:25,380 --> 01:46:26,930
repeat it everywhere but I've heard that
like in the US military for instance

6426
01:46:26,930 --> 01:46:26,940
like in the US military for instance
 

6427
01:46:26,940 --> 01:46:29,570
like in the US military for instance
they've gotten exceedingly well they do

6428
01:46:29,570 --> 01:46:29,580
they've gotten exceedingly well they do
 

6429
01:46:29,580 --> 01:46:31,129
they've gotten exceedingly well they do
an exceedingly good job at getting

6430
01:46:31,129 --> 01:46:31,139
an exceedingly good job at getting
 

6431
01:46:31,139 --> 01:46:33,229
an exceedingly good job at getting
different people of different races to

6432
01:46:33,229 --> 01:46:33,239
different people of different races to
 

6433
01:46:33,239 --> 01:46:34,850
different people of different races to
integrate and it's like not a huge

6434
01:46:34,850 --> 01:46:34,860
integrate and it's like not a huge
 

6435
01:46:34,860 --> 01:46:36,709
integrate and it's like not a huge
problem once you're through basic

6436
01:46:36,709 --> 01:46:36,719
problem once you're through basic
 

6437
01:46:36,719 --> 01:46:38,030
problem once you're through basic
training all the training everything

6438
01:46:38,030 --> 01:46:38,040
training all the training everything
 

6439
01:46:38,040 --> 01:46:39,950
training all the training everything
but for a different sex as it still

6440
01:46:39,950 --> 01:46:39,960
but for a different sex as it still
 

6441
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:41,330
but for a different sex as it still
represents a significant problem that

6442
01:46:41,330 --> 01:46:41,340
represents a significant problem that
 

6443
01:46:41,340 --> 01:46:43,010
represents a significant problem that
the military hasn't figured out and I

6444
01:46:43,010 --> 01:46:43,020
the military hasn't figured out and I
 

6445
01:46:43,020 --> 01:46:44,030
the military hasn't figured out and I
actually looked like what's the military

6446
01:46:44,030 --> 01:46:44,040
actually looked like what's the military
 

6447
01:46:44,040 --> 01:46:45,290
actually looked like what's the military
doing because if you know if something

6448
01:46:45,290 --> 01:46:45,300
doing because if you know if something
 

6449
01:46:45,300 --> 01:46:46,729
doing because if you know if something
was solvable like can we sleep for four

6450
01:46:46,729 --> 01:46:46,739
was solvable like can we sleep for four
 

6451
01:46:46,739 --> 01:46:48,410
was solvable like can we sleep for four
hours a night be healthy if we could I

6452
01:46:48,410 --> 01:46:48,420
hours a night be healthy if we could I
 

6453
01:46:48,420 --> 01:46:49,609
hours a night be healthy if we could I
bet the military would know you know so

6454
01:46:49,609 --> 01:46:49,619
bet the military would know you know so
 

6455
01:46:49,619 --> 01:46:50,689
bet the military would know you know so
I kind of look sometimes for them to see

6456
01:46:50,689 --> 01:46:50,699
I kind of look sometimes for them to see
 

6457
01:46:50,699 --> 01:46:52,070
I kind of look sometimes for them to see
their integration but um it might be

6458
01:46:52,070 --> 01:46:52,080
their integration but um it might be
 

6459
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:53,090
their integration but um it might be
that there are other issues there that

6460
01:46:53,090 --> 01:46:53,100
that there are other issues there that
 

6461
01:46:53,100 --> 01:46:54,770
that there are other issues there that
make it yeah it feels like the military

6462
01:46:54,770 --> 01:46:54,780
make it yeah it feels like the military
 

6463
01:46:54,780 --> 01:46:56,030
make it yeah it feels like the military
is a very particular country for sure

6464
01:46:56,030 --> 01:46:56,040
is a very particular country for sure
 

6465
01:46:56,040 --> 01:46:58,550
is a very particular country for sure
yeah it could be the actual task at hand

6466
01:46:58,550 --> 01:46:58,560
yeah it could be the actual task at hand
 

6467
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:02,810
yeah it could be the actual task at hand
might uh bias the difficulty of the

6468
01:47:02,810 --> 01:47:02,820
might uh bias the difficulty of the
 

6469
01:47:02,820 --> 01:47:04,970
might uh bias the difficulty of the
process potentially yeah there's been a

6470
01:47:04,970 --> 01:47:04,980
process potentially yeah there's been a
 

6471
01:47:04,980 --> 01:47:06,350
process potentially yeah there's been a
lot of interesting

6472
01:47:06,350 --> 01:47:06,360
lot of interesting
 

6473
01:47:06,360 --> 01:47:09,109
lot of interesting
um talk about like women integrating

6474
01:47:09,109 --> 01:47:09,119
um talk about like women integrating
 

6475
01:47:09,119 --> 01:47:12,109
um talk about like women integrating
into male groups and how do you do this

6476
01:47:12,109 --> 01:47:12,119
into male groups and how do you do this
 

6477
01:47:12,119 --> 01:47:14,270
into male groups and how do you do this
in a way where everybody is happy with

6478
01:47:14,270 --> 01:47:14,280
in a way where everybody is happy with
 

6479
01:47:14,280 --> 01:47:18,350
in a way where everybody is happy with
the outcome and there's not like issues

6480
01:47:18,350 --> 01:47:18,360
the outcome and there's not like issues
 

6481
01:47:18,360 --> 01:47:19,550
the outcome and there's not like issues
um I think Jordan Peterson spoke about

6482
01:47:19,550 --> 01:47:19,560
um I think Jordan Peterson spoke about
 

6483
01:47:19,560 --> 01:47:20,570
um I think Jordan Peterson spoke about
this a little bit and then workplace

6484
01:47:20,570 --> 01:47:20,580
this a little bit and then workplace
 

6485
01:47:20,580 --> 01:47:22,550
this a little bit and then workplace
culture speaks about this a bit would

6486
01:47:22,550 --> 01:47:22,560
culture speaks about this a bit would
 

6487
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:24,830
culture speaks about this a bit would
you happen to remember I want to say it

6488
01:47:24,830 --> 01:47:24,840
you happen to remember I want to say it
 

6489
01:47:24,840 --> 01:47:26,570
you happen to remember I want to say it
was like five or ten years ago there was

6490
01:47:26,570 --> 01:47:26,580
was like five or ten years ago there was
 

6491
01:47:26,580 --> 01:47:28,550
was like five or ten years ago there was
a big Tech conference and there were two

6492
01:47:28,550 --> 01:47:28,560
a big Tech conference and there were two
 

6493
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:30,290
a big Tech conference and there were two
guys behind a woman and they made a joke

6494
01:47:30,290 --> 01:47:30,300

woman
 

7177
01:57:48,360 --> 01:57:51,290
woman
so like uh the group

7178
01:57:51,290 --> 01:57:51,300
so like uh the group
 

7179
01:57:51,300 --> 01:57:53,689
so like uh the group
in their brain accumulates all the

7180
01:57:53,689 --> 01:57:53,699
in their brain accumulates all the
 

7181
01:57:53,699 --> 01:57:55,250
in their brain accumulates all the
negative characteristics of the

7182
01:57:55,250 --> 01:57:55,260
negative characteristics of the
 

7183
01:57:55,260 --> 01:57:57,229
negative characteristics of the
individuals they've met not the positive

7184
01:57:57,229 --> 01:57:57,239
individuals they've met not the positive
 

7185
01:57:57,239 --> 01:57:58,970
individuals they've met not the positive
the negative and it becomes like this

7186
01:57:58,970 --> 01:57:58,980
the negative and it becomes like this
 

7187
01:57:58,980 --> 01:58:01,189
the negative and it becomes like this
ball of stickiness and then that becomes

7188
01:58:01,189 --> 01:58:01,199
ball of stickiness and then that becomes
 

7189
01:58:01,199 --> 01:58:03,770
ball of stickiness and then that becomes
the bias for their judgment of a new

7190
01:58:03,770 --> 01:58:03,780
the bias for their judgment of a new
 

7191
01:58:03,780 --> 01:58:06,410
the bias for their judgment of a new
person that comes with white men there's

7192
01:58:06,410 --> 01:58:06,420
person that comes with white men there's
 

7193
01:58:06,420 --> 01:58:08,330
person that comes with white men there's
more of a blank slate in terms of bias

7194
01:58:08,330 --> 01:58:08,340
more of a blank slate in terms of bias
 

7195
01:58:08,340 --> 01:58:10,970
more of a blank slate in terms of bias
of how they analyze the person with any

7196
01:58:10,970 --> 01:58:10,980
of how they analyze the person with any
 

7197
01:58:10,980 --> 01:58:12,589
of how they analyze the person with any
any of the minority group they're

7198
01:58:12,589 --> 01:58:12,599
any of the minority group they're
 

7199
01:58:12,599 --> 01:58:14,870
any of the minority group they're
basically make a judgment

7200
01:58:14,870 --> 01:58:14,880
basically make a judgment
 

7201
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:16,850
basically make a judgment
based on the negative characteristics of

7202
01:58:16,850 --> 01:58:16,860
based on the negative characteristics of
 

7203
01:58:16,860 --> 01:58:18,410
based on the negative characteristics of
the individuals they met in the past I

7204
01:58:18,410 --> 01:58:18,420
the individuals they met in the past I
 

7205
01:58:18,420 --> 01:58:20,870
the individuals they met in the past I
just that leads to a system where you're

7206
01:58:20,870 --> 01:58:20,880
just that leads to a system where you're
 

7207
01:58:20,880 --> 01:58:23,689
just that leads to a system where you're
just harsher towards minority groups and

7208
01:58:23,689 --> 01:58:23,699
just harsher towards minority groups and
 

7209
01:58:23,699 --> 01:58:25,910
just harsher towards minority groups and
towards women how do you solve that the

7210
01:58:25,910 --> 01:58:25,920

pill ideology comes from you know and
 

7259
01:59:04,920 --> 01:59:06,350
pill ideology comes from you know and
even if the statements are kind of true

7260
01:59:06,350 --> 01:59:06,360
even if the statements are kind of true
 

7261
01:59:06,360 --> 01:59:07,910
even if the statements are kind of true
when you're making these observations

7262
01:59:07,910 --> 01:59:07,920
when you're making these observations
 

7263
01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:09,589
when you're making these observations
over and over and over and over again it

7264
01:59:09,589 --> 01:59:09,599
over and over and over and over again it
 

7265
01:59:09,599 --> 01:59:11,870
over and over and over and over again it
it damages your ability to individually

perceive somebody and then two people

7268
01:59:13,490 --> 01:59:13,500
perceive somebody and then two people
 

7269
01:59:13,500 --> 01:59:15,169
perceive somebody and then two people
that make the same statements one can be

7270
01:59:15,169 --> 01:59:15,179
that make the same statements one can be
 

7271
01:59:15,179 --> 01:59:16,850
that make the same statements one can be
perceived more harshly just because of

7272
01:59:16,850 --> 01:59:16,860
perceived more harshly just because of
 

7273
01:59:16,860 --> 01:59:18,290
perceived more harshly just because of
that like group bias you've got built up

7274
01:59:18,290 --> 01:59:18,300
that like group bias you've got built up
 

7275
01:59:18,300 --> 01:59:19,370
that like group bias you've got built up
I think there's something about

7276
01:59:19,370 --> 01:59:19,380
I think there's something about
 

7277
01:59:19,380 --> 01:59:20,930
I think there's something about
streaming that just brings that out of

7278
01:59:20,930 --> 01:59:20,940
streaming that just brings that out of
 

7279
01:59:20,940 --> 01:59:22,310
streaming that just brings that out of
people like because you have to talk for

7280
01:59:22,310 --> 01:59:22,320
people like because you have to talk for
 

7281
01:59:22,320 --> 01:59:24,410
people like because you have to talk for
like seven hours so you're like all

7282
01:59:24,410 --> 01:59:24,420
like seven hours so you're like all
 

7283
01:59:24,420 --> 01:59:26,629
like seven hours so you're like all
right well whatever psychological issues

7284
01:59:26,629 --> 01:59:26,639
right well whatever psychological issues
 

7285
01:59:26,639 --> 01:59:28,609
right well whatever psychological issues
and complexities I I have I'm going to

7286
01:59:28,609 --> 01:59:28,619
and complexities I I have I'm going to
 

7287
01:59:28,619 --> 01:59:30,589
and complexities I I have I'm going to
explore that it's magnified magnified

7288
01:59:30,589 --> 01:59:30,599
explore that it's magnified magnified
 

7289
01:59:30,599 --> 01:59:33,050
explore that it's magnified magnified
and then we'll and then it's uh as you

7290
01:59:33,050 --> 01:59:33,060
and then we'll and then it's uh as you
 

7291
01:59:33,060 --> 01:59:36,290
and then we'll and then it's uh as you
talked about the memetic uh uh Theory so

the things that are very similar and
 

7297
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:42,770
the things that are very similar and
you're going to magnify the conflicts

7298
01:59:42,770 --> 01:59:42,780
you're going to magnify the conflicts
 

7299
01:59:42,780 --> 01:59:43,729
you're going to magnify the conflicts
that you have and you're going to

7300
01:59:43,729 --> 01:59:43,739
that you have and you're going to
 

7301
01:59:43,739 --> 01:59:45,649
that you have and you're going to
explore the all the different

7302
01:59:45,649 --> 01:59:45,659
explore the all the different
 

7303
01:59:45,659 --> 01:59:46,729
explore the all the different
perspectives on those different

7304
01:59:46,729 --> 01:59:46,739
perspectives on those different
 

7305
01:59:46,739 --> 01:59:49,129
perspectives on those different
conflicts and I mean I don't I don't

7306
01:59:49,129 --> 01:59:49,139
conflicts and I mean I don't I don't
 

7307
01:59:49,139 --> 01:59:51,470
conflicts and I mean I don't I don't
know if it's just anecdotal but it's

7308
01:59:51,470 --> 01:59:51,480
know if it's just anecdotal but it's
 

7309
01:59:51,480 --> 01:59:53,149
know if it's just anecdotal but it's
nice to have women on stream and I think

where women feel safe to speak
 

7327
02:00:12,780 --> 02:00:15,530
where women feel safe to speak
all right given that you're like we

7328
02:00:15,530 --> 02:00:15,540
all right given that you're like we
 

7329
02:00:15,540 --> 02:00:17,830
all right given that you're like we
talked about a progressive with

7330
02:00:17,830 --> 02:00:17,840
talked about a progressive with
 

7331
02:00:17,840 --> 02:00:20,570
talked about a progressive with
non-standard Progressive views so you're

7332
02:00:20,570 --> 02:00:20,580
non-standard Progressive views so you're
 

7333
02:00:20,580 --> 02:00:24,530
non-standard Progressive views so you're
very pro-free speech pro-capitalism

7334
02:00:24,530 --> 02:00:24,540
very pro-free speech pro-capitalism
 

7335
02:00:24,540 --> 02:00:26,330
very pro-free speech pro-capitalism
so given that it's very interesting that

7336
02:00:26,330 --> 02:00:26,340
so given that it's very interesting that
 

7337
02:00:26,340 --> 02:00:29,209
so given that it's very interesting that
you're also pro-establishment and pro

7338
02:00:29,209 --> 02:00:29,219
you're also pro-establishment and pro
 

7339
02:00:29,219 --> 02:00:32,450
you're also pro-establishment and pro
institutions uh so right now if you look

7340
02:00:32,450 --> 02:00:32,460
institutions uh so right now if you look
 

7341
02:00:32,460 --> 02:00:33,770
institutions uh so right now if you look
at the world there's a significant

7342
02:00:33,770 --> 02:00:33,780
at the world there's a significant
 

7343
02:00:33,780 --> 02:00:36,830
at the world there's a significant
distrust of Institutions uh at least in

7344
02:00:36,830 --> 02:00:36,840
distrust of Institutions uh at least in
 

7345
02:00:36,840 --> 02:00:39,890
distrust of Institutions uh at least in
sort of public intellectual discourse uh

7346
02:00:39,890 --> 02:00:39,900
sort of public intellectual discourse uh
 

7347
02:00:39,900 --> 02:00:41,570
sort of public intellectual discourse uh
what is the nature of your support for

7348
02:00:41,570 --> 02:00:41,580
what is the nature of your support for
 

7349
02:00:41,580 --> 02:00:43,430
what is the nature of your support for
government and institutions can you make

7350
02:00:43,430 --> 02:00:43,440
government and institutions can you make
 

7351
02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:46,330
government and institutions can you make
the case for and against them

7352
02:00:46,330 --> 02:00:46,340
the case for and against them
 

7353
02:00:46,340 --> 02:00:48,350
the case for and against them
broadly speaking

7354
02:00:48,350 --> 02:00:48,360
broadly speaking
 

7355
02:00:48,360 --> 02:00:52,189
broadly speaking
there is a synergistic effect when two

7356
02:00:52,189 --> 02:00:52,199
there is a synergistic effect when two
 

7357
02:00:52,199 --> 02:00:55,310
there is a synergistic effect when two
humans come together if I can speak very

7358
02:00:55,310 --> 02:00:55,320
humans come together if I can speak very
 

7359
02:00:55,320 --> 02:00:57,709
humans come together if I can speak very
broadly in terms of we'll say utility

7360
02:00:57,709 --> 02:00:57,719
broadly in terms of we'll say utility
 

7361
02:00:57,719 --> 02:01:00,649
broadly in terms of we'll say utility
okay my happiness with one person might

7362
02:01:00,649 --> 02:01:00,659
okay my happiness with one person might
 

7363
02:01:00,659 --> 02:01:02,930
okay my happiness with one person might
be ten the happiness of the person might

7364
02:01:02,930 --> 02:01:02,940
be ten the happiness of the person might
 

7365
02:01:02,940 --> 02:01:05,030
be ten the happiness of the person might
be ten but when they come together it's

7366
02:01:05,030 --> 02:01:05,040
be ten but when they come together it's
 

7367
02:01:05,040 --> 02:01:06,770
be ten but when they come together it's
like 50 between the two of them there's

7368
02:01:06,770 --> 02:01:06,780
like 50 between the two of them there's
 

7369
02:01:06,780 --> 02:01:08,510
like 50 between the two of them there's
like the synergistic effect when humans

7370
02:01:08,510 --> 02:01:08,520
like the synergistic effect when humans
 

7371
02:01:08,520 --> 02:01:11,390
like the synergistic effect when humans
work together that the sum is greater

7372
02:01:11,390 --> 02:01:11,400
work together that the sum is greater
 

7373
02:01:11,400 --> 02:01:12,530
work together that the sum is greater
than all the individual parts or

7374
02:01:12,530 --> 02:01:12,540
than all the individual parts or
 

7375
02:01:12,540 --> 02:01:13,850
than all the individual parts or
whatever there's like an emergent thing

7376
02:01:13,850 --> 02:01:13,860
whatever there's like an emergent thing
 

7377
02:01:13,860 --> 02:01:15,649
whatever there's like an emergent thing
that happens there there's a capacity

7378
02:01:15,649 --> 02:01:15,659
that happens there there's a capacity
 

7379
02:01:15,659 --> 02:01:17,689
that happens there there's a capacity
there's a possibility of that yeah a

7380
02:01:17,689 --> 02:01:17,699
there's a possibility of that yeah a
 

7381
02:01:17,699 --> 02:01:19,070
there's a possibility of that yeah a
possibility sure things could go really

7382
02:01:19,070 --> 02:01:19,080
possibility sure things could go really
 

7383
02:01:19,080 --> 02:01:20,450
possibility sure things could go really
wrong there could be a cannibalistic

7384
02:01:20,450 --> 02:01:20,460
wrong there could be a cannibalistic
 

7385
02:01:20,460 --> 02:01:22,189
wrong there could be a cannibalistic
tribe that all eats each other sure but

7386
02:01:22,189 --> 02:01:22,199
tribe that all eats each other sure but
 

7387
02:01:22,199 --> 02:01:23,750
tribe that all eats each other sure but
for the purpose of this there's other

7388
02:01:23,750 --> 02:01:23,760
for the purpose of this there's other
 

7389
02:01:23,760 --> 02:01:25,790
for the purpose of this there's other
failure modes but yes okay sure yeah

7390
02:01:25,790 --> 02:01:25,800
failure modes but yes okay sure yeah
 

7391
02:01:25,800 --> 02:01:27,830
failure modes but yes okay sure yeah
further for the but well I think broadly

7392
02:01:27,830 --> 02:01:27,840
further for the but well I think broadly
 

7393
02:01:27,840 --> 02:01:29,330
further for the but well I think broadly
speaking you're are you going to be the

7394
02:01:29,330 --> 02:01:29,340
speaking you're are you going to be the
 

7395
02:01:29,340 --> 02:01:31,370
speaking you're are you going to be the
well actually guy okay if you wanna okay

7396
02:01:31,370 --> 02:01:31,380
well actually guy okay if you wanna okay
 

7397
02:01:31,380 --> 02:01:33,229
well actually guy okay if you wanna okay
well actually well actually sometimes

7398
02:01:33,229 --> 02:01:33,239
well actually well actually sometimes
 

7399
02:01:33,239 --> 02:01:36,470
well actually well actually sometimes
yeah they're actually good foreign true

7400
02:01:36,470 --> 02:01:36,480
yeah they're actually good foreign true
 

7401
02:01:36,480 --> 02:01:38,270
yeah they're actually good foreign true
yeah sometimes things do going but I

7402
02:01:38,270 --> 02:01:38,280
yeah sometimes things do going but I
 

7403
02:01:38,280 --> 02:01:39,589
yeah sometimes things do going but I
think broadly speaking the fact that

7404
02:01:39,589 --> 02:01:39,599
think broadly speaking the fact that
 

7405
02:01:39,599 --> 02:01:41,209
think broadly speaking the fact that
you're sitting here in clothing that you

7406
02:01:41,209 --> 02:01:41,219
you're sitting here in clothing that you
 

7407
02:01:41,219 --> 02:01:42,589
you're sitting here in clothing that you
didn't make and I'm sitting here on an

7408
02:01:42,589 --> 02:01:42,599
didn't make and I'm sitting here on an
 

7409
02:01:42,599 --> 02:01:44,209
didn't make and I'm sitting here on an
airplane that I don't know how to fly or

7410
02:01:44,209 --> 02:01:44,219
airplane that I don't know how to fly or
 

7411
02:01:44,219 --> 02:01:45,709
airplane that I don't know how to fly or
Bill like right there's a lot of cool

7412
02:01:45,709 --> 02:01:45,719
Bill like right there's a lot of cool
 

7413
02:01:45,719 --> 02:01:47,270
Bill like right there's a lot of cool
stuff that happens when people come

7414
02:01:47,270 --> 02:01:47,280
stuff that happens when people come
 

7415
02:01:47,280 --> 02:01:50,330
stuff that happens when people come
together and they make civilizations and

7416
02:01:50,330 --> 02:01:50,340
together and they make civilizations and
 

7417
02:01:50,340 --> 02:01:53,030
together and they make civilizations and
part of that civilization building is

7418
02:01:53,030 --> 02:01:53,040
part of that civilization building is
 

7419
02:01:53,040 --> 02:01:55,310
part of that civilization building is
the fact that we can specialize and it's

7420
02:01:55,310 --> 02:01:55,320
the fact that we can specialize and it's
 

7421
02:01:55,320 --> 02:01:57,470
the fact that we can specialize and it's
the fact that we can offload a bunch of

7422
02:01:57,470 --> 02:01:57,480
the fact that we can offload a bunch of
 

7423
02:01:57,480 --> 02:02:00,109
the fact that we can offload a bunch of
trust onto third parties that we

7424
02:02:00,109 --> 02:02:00,119
trust onto third parties that we
 

7425
02:02:00,119 --> 02:02:02,270
trust onto third parties that we
delegate the power to make important

7426
02:02:02,270 --> 02:02:02,280
delegate the power to make important
 

7427
02:02:02,280 --> 02:02:04,370
delegate the power to make important
decisions about our lives right I don't

7428
02:02:04,370 --> 02:02:04,380
decisions about our lives right I don't
 

7429
02:02:04,380 --> 02:02:06,649
decisions about our lives right I don't
know anything about how to like build

7430
02:02:06,649 --> 02:02:06,659
know anything about how to like build
 

7431
02:02:06,659 --> 02:02:08,810
know anything about how to like build
like a combustion engine but I know that

7432
02:02:08,810 --> 02:02:08,820
like a combustion engine but I know that
 

7433
02:02:08,820 --> 02:02:09,950
like a combustion engine but I know that
when I push the button on my car it's

7434
02:02:09,950 --> 02:02:09,960
when I push the button on my car it's
 

7435
02:02:09,960 --> 02:02:11,270
when I push the button on my car it's
going to drive around and the fumes

7436
02:02:11,270 --> 02:02:11,280
going to drive around and the fumes
 

7437
02:02:11,280 --> 02:02:12,770
going to drive around and the fumes
aren't going to kill me and I can park

7438
02:02:12,770 --> 02:02:12,780
aren't going to kill me and I can park
 

7439
02:02:12,780 --> 02:02:14,149
aren't going to kill me and I can park
it in garages and the building's not

7440
02:02:14,149 --> 02:02:14,159
it in garages and the building's not
 

7441
02:02:14,159 --> 02:02:15,589
it in garages and the building's not
going to collapse and the only reason

7442
02:02:15,589 --> 02:02:15,599
going to collapse and the only reason
 

7443
02:02:15,599 --> 02:02:16,850
going to collapse and the only reason
all of this works is because I've

7444
02:02:16,850 --> 02:02:16,860
all of this works is because I've
 

7445
02:02:16,860 --> 02:02:18,350
all of this works is because I've
offloaded a lot of trust under these

7446
02:02:18,350 --> 02:02:18,360
offloaded a lot of trust under these
 

7447
02:02:18,360 --> 02:02:20,209
offloaded a lot of trust under these
third-party things and I would say that

7448
02:02:20,209 --> 02:02:20,219
third-party things and I would say that
 

7449
02:02:20,219 --> 02:02:21,649
third-party things and I would say that
the pillars of these third-party things

7450
02:02:21,649 --> 02:02:21,659
the pillars of these third-party things
 

7451
02:02:21,659 --> 02:02:23,510
the pillars of these third-party things
that Society is built on are roughly

7452
02:02:23,510 --> 02:02:23,520
that Society is built on are roughly
 

7453
02:02:23,520 --> 02:02:25,910
that Society is built on are roughly
speaking institutions so that might be

7454
02:02:25,910 --> 02:02:25,920
speaking institutions so that might be
 

7455
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:28,250
speaking institutions so that might be
the institution of peer review for

7456
02:02:28,250 --> 02:02:28,260
the institution of peer review for
 

7457
02:02:28,260 --> 02:02:30,410
the institution of peer review for
scientific articles it might be the

7458
02:02:30,410 --> 02:02:30,420
scientific articles it might be the
 

7459
02:02:30,420 --> 02:02:33,290
scientific articles it might be the
institution of uh voting for government

7460
02:02:33,290 --> 02:02:33,300
institution of uh voting for government
 

7461
02:02:33,300 --> 02:02:35,870
institution of uh voting for government
right or the the ability for us to vote

7462
02:02:35,870 --> 02:02:35,880
right or the the ability for us to vote
 

7463
02:02:35,880 --> 02:02:37,790
right or the the ability for us to vote
in that whole process it might yeah all

7464
02:02:37,790 --> 02:02:37,800
in that whole process it might yeah all
 

7465
02:02:37,800 --> 02:02:39,470
in that whole process it might yeah all
the FDA like all of these institutions

7466
02:02:39,470 --> 02:02:39,480
the FDA like all of these institutions
 

7467
02:02:39,480 --> 02:02:41,089
the FDA like all of these institutions
and things that they need to exist

7468
02:02:41,089 --> 02:02:41,099
and things that they need to exist
 

7469
02:02:41,099 --> 02:02:43,189
and things that they need to exist
because we don't have the time or the

7470
02:02:43,189 --> 02:02:43,199
because we don't have the time or the
 

7471
02:02:43,199 --> 02:02:44,990
because we don't have the time or the
capability to individually sort through

7472
02:02:44,990 --> 02:02:45,000
capability to individually sort through
 

7473
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:46,250
capability to individually sort through
all of our all of these things

7474
02:02:46,250 --> 02:02:46,260
all of our all of these things
 

7475
02:02:46,260 --> 02:02:47,930
all of our all of these things
individually we have to rely on some

7476
02:02:47,930 --> 02:02:47,940
individually we have to rely on some
 

7477
02:02:47,940 --> 02:02:52,490
individually we have to rely on some
certain to do it okay so you believe at

7478
02:02:52,490 --> 02:02:52,500
certain to do it okay so you believe at
 

7479
02:02:52,500 --> 02:02:55,609
certain to do it okay so you believe at
scale the when we're together we're

7480
02:02:55,609 --> 02:02:55,619
scale the when we're together we're
 

7481
02:02:55,619 --> 02:02:57,410
scale the when we're together we're
greater than the sum of our parts that's

7482
02:02:57,410 --> 02:02:57,420
greater than the sum of our parts that's
 

7483
02:02:57,420 --> 02:02:59,270
greater than the sum of our parts that's
the case for institutions absolutely

7484
02:02:59,270 --> 02:02:59,280
the case for institutions absolutely
 

7485
02:02:59,280 --> 02:03:01,550
the case for institutions absolutely
what about the inefficiencies of

7486
02:03:01,550 --> 02:03:01,560
what about the inefficiencies of
 

7487
02:03:01,560 --> 02:03:04,850
what about the inefficiencies of
bureaucracy is there some aspect when at

7488
02:03:04,850 --> 02:03:04,860
bureaucracy is there some aspect when at
 

7489
02:03:04,860 --> 02:03:06,290
bureaucracy is there some aspect when at
scale

7490
02:03:06,290 --> 02:03:06,300
scale
 

7491
02:03:06,300 --> 02:03:08,270
scale
different Dynamics come into play than

7492
02:03:08,270 --> 02:03:08,280
different Dynamics come into play than
 

7493
02:03:08,280 --> 02:03:09,709
different Dynamics come into play than
they do when there's two people together

7494
02:03:09,709 --> 02:03:09,719
they do when there's two people together
 

7495
02:03:09,719 --> 02:03:11,930
they do when there's two people together
two people that love each other the

7496
02:03:11,930 --> 02:03:11,940
two people that love each other the
 

7497
02:03:11,940 --> 02:03:14,750
two people that love each other the
birds and the bees is there some aspect

7498
02:03:14,750 --> 02:03:14,760
birds and the bees is there some aspect
 

7499
02:03:14,760 --> 02:03:16,910
birds and the bees is there some aspect
that leads more to cannibalism at scale

7500
02:03:16,910 --> 02:03:16,920
that leads more to cannibalism at scale
 

7501
02:03:16,920 --> 02:03:19,430
that leads more to cannibalism at scale
so like corruption inefficiencies that

7502
02:03:19,430 --> 02:03:19,440
so like corruption inefficiencies that
 

7503
02:03:19,440 --> 02:03:21,950
so like corruption inefficiencies that
due to bureaucracy and so on bureaucracy

7504
02:03:21,950 --> 02:03:21,960
due to bureaucracy and so on bureaucracy
 

7505
02:03:21,960 --> 02:03:24,410
due to bureaucracy and so on bureaucracy
which is not I hate it when people try

7506
02:03:24,410 --> 02:03:24,420
which is not I hate it when people try
 

7507
02:03:24,420 --> 02:03:26,209
which is not I hate it when people try
to say bureaucracy is government because

7508
02:03:26,209 --> 02:03:26,219
to say bureaucracy is government because
 

7509
02:03:26,219 --> 02:03:28,250
to say bureaucracy is government because
bureaucracy exists a ton in private

7510
02:03:28,250 --> 02:03:28,260
bureaucracy exists a ton in private
 

7511
02:03:28,260 --> 02:03:29,870
bureaucracy exists a ton in private
environments as well right in businesses

7512
02:03:29,870 --> 02:03:29,880
environments as well right in businesses
 

7513
02:03:29,880 --> 02:03:30,709
environments as well right in businesses
and everything

7514
02:03:30,709 --> 02:03:30,719
and everything
 

7515
02:03:30,719 --> 02:03:32,810
and everything
um bureaucracy introduces its own set of

7516
02:03:32,810 --> 02:03:32,820
um bureaucracy introduces its own set of
 

7517
02:03:32,820 --> 02:03:35,030
um bureaucracy introduces its own set of
problems but I mean a bureaucracy is

7518
02:03:35,030 --> 02:03:35,040
problems but I mean a bureaucracy is
 

7519
02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:37,370
problems but I mean a bureaucracy is
necessary because it's coordinating all

7520
02:03:37,370 --> 02:03:37,380
necessary because it's coordinating all
 

7521
02:03:37,380 --> 02:03:38,930
necessary because it's coordinating all
of the underlying things in order in

7522
02:03:38,930 --> 02:03:38,940
of the underlying things in order in
 

7523
02:03:38,940 --> 02:03:40,430
of the underlying things in order in
order to create something that's greater

7524
02:03:40,430 --> 02:03:40,440
order to create something that's greater
 

7525
02:03:40,440 --> 02:03:43,070
order to create something that's greater
than the sum of its parts right like all

7526
02:03:43,070 --> 02:03:43,080
than the sum of its parts right like all
 

7527
02:03:43,080 --> 02:03:44,629
than the sum of its parts right like all
of the software developers in the world

7528
02:03:44,629 --> 02:03:44,639
of the software developers in the world
 

7529
02:03:44,639 --> 02:03:46,010
of the software developers in the world
are useless without being paired with

7530
02:03:46,010 --> 02:03:46,020
are useless without being paired with
 

7531
02:03:46,020 --> 02:03:47,390
are useless without being paired with
good designers in order to make their

7532
02:03:47,390 --> 02:03:47,400
good designers in order to make their
 

7533
02:03:47,400 --> 02:03:49,189
good designers in order to make their
products usable by a person and the

7534
02:03:49,189 --> 02:03:49,199
products usable by a person and the
 

7535
02:03:49,199 --> 02:03:50,629
products usable by a person and the
coordination of those people and the

7536
02:03:50,629 --> 02:03:50,639
coordination of those people and the
 

7537
02:03:50,639 --> 02:03:51,830
coordination of those people and the
coordination of increasingly more and

7538
02:03:51,830 --> 02:03:51,840
coordination of increasingly more and
 

7539
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:53,629
coordination of increasingly more and
more things necessitates some level of

7540
02:03:53,629 --> 02:03:53,639
more things necessitates some level of
 

7541
02:03:53,639 --> 02:03:55,189
more things necessitates some level of
bureaucracy I think we always say

7542
02:03:55,189 --> 02:03:55,199
bureaucracy I think we always say
 

7543
02:03:55,199 --> 02:03:57,290
bureaucracy I think we always say
bureaucracy when it's like a bad it's

7544
02:03:57,290 --> 02:03:57,300
bureaucracy when it's like a bad it's
 

7545
02:03:57,300 --> 02:03:58,609
bureaucracy when it's like a bad it's
like a slur almost like you're a

7546
02:03:58,609 --> 02:03:58,619
like a slur almost like you're a
 

7547
02:03:58,619 --> 02:04:00,169
like a slur almost like you're a
bureaucrat you're bureaucratic the

7548
02:04:00,169 --> 02:04:00,179
bureaucrat you're bureaucratic the
 

7549
02:04:00,179 --> 02:04:01,250
bureaucrat you're bureaucratic the
bureaucracy is slowing everything down

7550
02:04:01,250 --> 02:04:01,260
bureaucracy is slowing everything down
 

7551
02:04:01,260 --> 02:04:02,810
bureaucracy is slowing everything down
it's like sure the bureaucracy slows

7552
02:04:02,810 --> 02:04:02,820
it's like sure the bureaucracy slows
 

7553
02:04:02,820 --> 02:04:04,430
it's like sure the bureaucracy slows
things down but bureaucracy also gives

7554
02:04:04,430 --> 02:04:04,440
things down but bureaucracy also gives
 

7555
02:04:04,440 --> 02:04:05,810
things down but bureaucracy also gives
us things like you know safe medicine

7556
02:04:05,810 --> 02:04:05,820
us things like you know safe medicine
 

7557
02:04:05,820 --> 02:04:07,850
us things like you know safe medicine
and safe water to drink for most of the

7558

cars to drive so so the managers and
 

7563
02:04:12,840 --> 02:04:14,570

managers is the bureaucracy the the

7568
02:04:18,649 --> 02:04:18,659
managers is the bureaucracy the the
 

7569
02:04:18,659 --> 02:04:21,709
managers is the bureaucracy the the
reason bureaucracy is used as a slur is

7570
02:04:21,709 --> 02:04:21,719
reason bureaucracy is used as a slur is
 

7571
02:04:21,719 --> 02:04:24,770
reason bureaucracy is used as a slur is
that something about human nature

7572
02:04:24,770 --> 02:04:24,780
that something about human nature
 

7573
02:04:24,780 --> 02:04:28,370
that something about human nature
leads to bureaucracy often growing

7574
02:04:28,370 --> 02:04:28,380
leads to bureaucracy often growing
 

7575
02:04:28,380 --> 02:04:31,550
leads to bureaucracy often growing
growing indefinitely becoming less and

7576
02:04:31,550 --> 02:04:31,560
growing indefinitely becoming less and
 

7577
02:04:31,560 --> 02:04:33,649
growing indefinitely becoming less and
less efficient without a I mean this is

7578
02:04:33,649 --> 02:04:33,659
less efficient without a I mean this is
 

7579
02:04:33,659 --> 02:04:36,290
less efficient without a I mean this is
what capitalism can come in that

7580
02:04:36,290 --> 02:04:36,300
what capitalism can come in that
 

7581
02:04:36,300 --> 02:04:39,229
what capitalism can come in that
capitalism puts a pressure on the

7582
02:04:39,229 --> 02:04:39,239
capitalism puts a pressure on the
 

7583
02:04:39,239 --> 02:04:41,990
capitalism puts a pressure on the
bureaucracy not to grow too much because

7584
02:04:41,990 --> 02:04:42,000
bureaucracy not to grow too much because
 

7585
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,229
bureaucracy not to grow too much because
you want the bureaucracy to be useful

7586
02:04:44,229 --> 02:04:44,239
you want the bureaucracy to be useful
 

7587
02:04:44,239 --> 02:04:48,649
you want the bureaucracy to be useful
but not large yeah and to be a certain

7588
02:04:48,649 --> 02:04:48,659
but not large yeah and to be a certain
 

7589
02:04:48,659 --> 02:04:50,689
but not large yeah and to be a certain
size yeah of course to be the minimum

7590
02:04:50,689 --> 02:04:50,699
size yeah of course to be the minimum
 

7591
02:04:50,699 --> 02:04:51,649
size yeah of course to be the minimum
size

7592
02:04:51,649 --> 02:04:51,659
size
 

7593
02:04:51,659 --> 02:04:54,109
size
to get the job done and so capitalism

7594
02:04:54,109 --> 02:04:54,119
to get the job done and so capitalism
 

7595
02:04:54,119 --> 02:04:57,589
to get the job done and so capitalism
provides that mechanism

7596
02:04:57,589 --> 02:04:57,599
provides that mechanism
 

7597
02:04:57,599 --> 02:04:59,089
provides that mechanism
government

7598
02:04:59,089 --> 02:04:59,099
government
 

7599
02:04:59,099 --> 02:05:01,609
government
does not always and so that's the

7600
02:05:01,609 --> 02:05:01,619
does not always and so that's the
 

7601
02:05:01,619 --> 02:05:03,589
does not always and so that's the
criticism of government of Institutions

7602
02:05:03,589 --> 02:05:03,599
criticism of government of Institutions
 

7603
02:05:03,599 --> 02:05:06,109
criticism of government of Institutions
where it can grow without a significant

7604
02:05:06,109 --> 02:05:06,119
where it can grow without a significant
 

7605
02:05:06,119 --> 02:05:08,689
where it can grow without a significant
mechanism that says there's a cost to

7606
02:05:08,689 --> 02:05:08,699
mechanism that says there's a cost to
 

7607
02:05:08,699 --> 02:05:10,609
mechanism that says there's a cost to
bureaucracy that's not being accounted

7608
02:05:10,609 --> 02:05:10,619
bureaucracy that's not being accounted
 

7609
02:05:10,619 --> 02:05:12,709
bureaucracy that's not being accounted
for here we're just paying for the

7610
02:05:12,709 --> 02:05:12,719
for here we're just paying for the
 

7611
02:05:12,719 --> 02:05:15,649
for here we're just paying for the
increasing size of government without

7612
02:05:15,649 --> 02:05:15,659
increasing size of government without
 

7613
02:05:15,659 --> 02:05:18,109
increasing size of government without
the benefit yeah government is a special

7614
02:05:18,109 --> 02:05:18,119
the benefit yeah government is a special
 

7615
02:05:18,119 --> 02:05:20,030
the benefit yeah government is a special
institution because it doesn't have to

7616
02:05:20,030 --> 02:05:20,040
institution because it doesn't have to
 

7617
02:05:20,040 --> 02:05:22,370
institution because it doesn't have to
show itself to be financially viable and

7618
02:05:22,370 --> 02:05:22,380
show itself to be financially viable and
 

7619
02:05:22,380 --> 02:05:23,870
show itself to be financially viable and
we kind of live in a capitalist economy

7620
02:05:23,870 --> 02:05:23,880
we kind of live in a capitalist economy
 

7621
02:05:23,880 --> 02:05:25,370
we kind of live in a capitalist economy
where that's generally the case so

7622
02:05:25,370 --> 02:05:25,380
where that's generally the case so
 

7623
02:05:25,380 --> 02:05:27,290
where that's generally the case so
government gets its powers from votes

7624
02:05:27,290 --> 02:05:27,300
government gets its powers from votes
 

7625
02:05:27,300 --> 02:05:28,850
government gets its powers from votes
from the people which introduces a whole

7626
02:05:28,850 --> 02:05:28,860
from the people which introduces a whole
 

7627
02:05:28,860 --> 02:05:31,010
from the people which introduces a whole
new set of possible positives and

7628
02:05:31,010 --> 02:05:31,020
new set of possible positives and
 

7629
02:05:31,020 --> 02:05:32,570
new set of possible positives and
possible negatives right having

7630
02:05:32,570 --> 02:05:32,580
possible negatives right having
 

7631
02:05:32,580 --> 02:05:34,430
possible negatives right having
something for instance that gives food

7632
02:05:34,430 --> 02:05:34,440
something for instance that gives food
 

7633
02:05:34,440 --> 02:05:36,410
something for instance that gives food
or shelter to homeless people maybe you

7634
02:05:36,410 --> 02:05:36,420
or shelter to homeless people maybe you
 

7635
02:05:36,420 --> 02:05:37,790
or shelter to homeless people maybe you
don't want that to have to run at a

7636
02:05:37,790 --> 02:05:37,800
don't want that to have to run at a
 

7637
02:05:37,800 --> 02:05:40,070
don't want that to have to run at a
profit but giving you know an

7638
02:05:40,070 --> 02:05:40,080
profit but giving you know an
 

7639
02:05:40,080 --> 02:05:41,810
profit but giving you know an
organization that can self-justify its

7640
02:05:41,810 --> 02:05:41,820
organization that can self-justify its
 

7641
02:05:41,820 --> 02:05:43,250
organization that can self-justify its
budgets perpetually and definitely

7642
02:05:43,250 --> 02:05:43,260
budgets perpetually and definitely
 

7643
02:05:43,260 --> 02:05:44,990
budgets perpetually and definitely
growing maybe that's not the best thing

7644
02:05:44,990 --> 02:05:45,000
growing maybe that's not the best thing
 

7645
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:46,790
growing maybe that's not the best thing
yeah we always have to figure out how to

7646
02:05:46,790 --> 02:05:46,800
yeah we always have to figure out how to
 

7647
02:05:46,800 --> 02:05:48,830
yeah we always have to figure out how to
do the constraints there but what about

7648
02:05:48,830 --> 02:05:48,840
do the constraints there but what about
 

7649
02:05:48,840 --> 02:05:52,250
do the constraints there but what about
the the corrupting nature of power

7650
02:05:52,250 --> 02:05:52,260
the the corrupting nature of power
 

7651
02:05:52,260 --> 02:05:54,410
the the corrupting nature of power
that comes with institutions as well

7652
02:05:54,410 --> 02:05:54,420
that comes with institutions as well
 

7653
02:05:54,420 --> 02:05:56,689
that comes with institutions as well
absolutely so then you better pick your

7654
02:05:56,689 --> 02:05:56,699
absolutely so then you better pick your
 

7655
02:05:56,699 --> 02:05:58,669
absolutely so then you better pick your
your style of institution very carefully

7656
02:05:58,669 --> 02:05:58,679
your style of institution very carefully
 

7657
02:05:58,679 --> 02:06:00,770
your style of institution very carefully
I think that the Democratic institution

7658
02:06:00,770 --> 02:06:00,780
I think that the Democratic institution
 

7659
02:06:00,780 --> 02:06:02,330
I think that the Democratic institution
we have in the United States today I

7660
02:06:02,330 --> 02:06:02,340
we have in the United States today I
 

7661
02:06:02,340 --> 02:06:04,310
we have in the United States today I
think works very well but I mean there

7662
02:06:04,310 --> 02:06:04,320
think works very well but I mean there
 

7663
02:06:04,320 --> 02:06:05,330
think works very well but I mean there
are other styles of government that have

7664
02:06:05,330 --> 02:06:05,340
are other styles of government that have
 

7665
02:06:05,340 --> 02:06:06,530
are other styles of government that have
been tried in the past that I think lend

7666
02:06:06,530 --> 02:06:06,540
been tried in the past that I think lend
 

7667
02:06:06,540 --> 02:06:08,570
been tried in the past that I think lend
themselves more to corruption not to say

7668
02:06:08,570 --> 02:06:08,580
themselves more to corruption not to say
 

7669
02:06:08,580 --> 02:06:09,709
themselves more to corruption not to say
that by the way there's not corruption

7670
02:06:09,709 --> 02:06:09,719
that by the way there's not corruption
 

7671
02:06:09,719 --> 02:06:10,850
that by the way there's not corruption
in the United States of course there's

7672
02:06:10,850 --> 02:06:10,860
in the United States of course there's
 

7673
02:06:10,860 --> 02:06:12,470
in the United States of course there's
going to be varying levels of corruption

7674
02:06:12,470 --> 02:06:12,480
going to be varying levels of corruption
 

7675
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:14,089
going to be varying levels of corruption
at like all

7676
02:06:14,089 --> 02:06:14,099
at like all
 

7677
02:06:14,099 --> 02:06:16,250
at like all
um at all levels but you run you run

7678
02:06:16,250 --> 02:06:16,260
um at all levels but you run you run
 

7679
02:06:16,260 --> 02:06:18,070
um at all levels but you run you run
into this interesting problem where

7680
02:06:18,070 --> 02:06:18,080
into this interesting problem where
 

7681
02:06:18,080 --> 02:06:20,390
into this interesting problem where
authoritarian regimes can act with

7682
02:06:20,390 --> 02:06:20,400
authoritarian regimes can act with
 

7683
02:06:20,400 --> 02:06:22,910
authoritarian regimes can act with
ruthless precision and swiftness because

7684
02:06:22,910 --> 02:06:22,920
ruthless precision and swiftness because
 

7685
02:06:22,920 --> 02:06:23,990
ruthless precision and swiftness because
they don't have to ask any questions

7686
02:06:23,990 --> 02:06:24,000
they don't have to ask any questions
 

7687
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,629
they don't have to ask any questions
they just do do do do and that's it

7688
02:06:26,629 --> 02:06:26,639
they just do do do do and that's it
 

7689
02:06:26,639 --> 02:06:28,189
they just do do do do and that's it
um but the problem is is it's an

7690
02:06:28,189 --> 02:06:28,199
um but the problem is is it's an
 

7691
02:06:28,199 --> 02:06:29,570
um but the problem is is it's an
authoritarian regime they're prone to

7692
02:06:29,570 --> 02:06:29,580
authoritarian regime they're prone to
 

7693
02:06:29,580 --> 02:06:31,669
authoritarian regime they're prone to
missteps they're slow to respond to

7694
02:06:31,669 --> 02:06:31,679
missteps they're slow to respond to
 

7695
02:06:31,679 --> 02:06:34,010
missteps they're slow to respond to
changing or evolving needs there's an

7696
02:06:34,010 --> 02:06:34,020
changing or evolving needs there's an
 

7697
02:06:34,020 --> 02:06:35,030
changing or evolving needs there's an
interesting study that was put out a

7698
02:06:35,030 --> 02:06:35,040
interesting study that was put out a
 

7699
02:06:35,040 --> 02:06:36,350
interesting study that was put out a
while ago that showed that like every

7700
02:06:36,350 --> 02:06:36,360
while ago that showed that like every
 

7701
02:06:36,360 --> 02:06:37,910
while ago that showed that like every
single famine that happened around the

7702
02:06:37,910 --> 02:06:37,920
single famine that happened around the
 

7703
02:06:37,920 --> 02:06:40,550
single famine that happened around the
world almost all like 98 of them happen

7704
02:06:40,550 --> 02:06:40,560
world almost all like 98 of them happen
 

7705
02:06:40,560 --> 02:06:42,229
world almost all like 98 of them happen
under authoritarian regimes where like

7706
02:06:42,229 --> 02:06:42,239
under authoritarian regimes where like
 

7707
02:06:42,239 --> 02:06:43,490
under authoritarian regimes where like
freedom of speech is very limited it's

7708
02:06:43,490 --> 02:06:43,500
freedom of speech is very limited it's
 

7709
02:06:43,500 --> 02:06:45,410
freedom of speech is very limited it's
very rare for a famine to happen under

7710
02:06:45,410 --> 02:06:45,420
very rare for a famine to happen under
 

7711
02:06:45,420 --> 02:06:47,270
very rare for a famine to happen under
uh democracy because press and

7712
02:06:47,270 --> 02:06:47,280
uh democracy because press and
 

7713
02:06:47,280 --> 02:06:48,290
uh democracy because press and
everything makes the government more

7714
02:06:48,290 --> 02:06:48,300
everything makes the government more
 

7715
02:06:48,300 --> 02:06:49,370
everything makes the government more
responsive to the needs of the people

7716
02:06:49,370 --> 02:06:49,380
responsive to the needs of the people
 

7717
02:06:49,380 --> 02:06:51,290
responsive to the needs of the people
power can corrupt their levels of

7718
02:06:51,290 --> 02:06:51,300
power can corrupt their levels of
 

7719
02:06:51,300 --> 02:06:52,910
power can corrupt their levels of
corruption but you have to have like a

7720
02:06:52,910 --> 02:06:52,920
corruption but you have to have like a
 

7721
02:06:52,920 --> 02:06:54,589
corruption but you have to have like a
system of checks and balances on on all

7722
02:06:54,589 --> 02:06:54,599
system of checks and balances on on all
 

7723
02:06:54,599 --> 02:06:55,550
system of checks and balances on on all
of those different levels to make sure

7724
02:06:55,550 --> 02:06:55,560
of those different levels to make sure
 

7725
02:06:55,560 --> 02:06:57,229
of those different levels to make sure
it doesn't run off the rails I guess and

7726

Weeds on things no pun intended um you

8008
02:11:21,410 --> 02:11:21,420
Weeds on things no pun intended um you
 

8009
02:11:21,420 --> 02:11:23,330
Weeds on things no pun intended um you
start to realize like oh shoot this is

8010
02:11:23,330 --> 02:11:23,340
start to realize like oh shoot this is
 

8011
02:11:23,340 --> 02:11:24,950
start to realize like oh shoot this is
more complicated I thought I don't know

8012
02:11:24,950 --> 02:11:24,960
more complicated I thought I don't know
 

8013
02:11:24,960 --> 02:11:26,330
more complicated I thought I don't know
the numbers in particular for

8014
02:11:26,330 --> 02:11:26,340
the numbers in particular for
 

8015
02:11:26,340 --> 02:11:28,370
the numbers in particular for
legalization of of marijuana but this is

8016
02:11:28,370 --> 02:11:28,380
legalization of of marijuana but this is
 

8017
02:11:28,380 --> 02:11:29,570
legalization of of marijuana but this is
what I'm going to guess is the case if

8018
02:11:29,570 --> 02:11:29,580
what I'm going to guess is the case if
 

8019
02:11:29,580 --> 02:11:31,729
what I'm going to guess is the case if
you pull and you say should we legalize

8020
02:11:31,729 --> 02:11:31,739
you pull and you say should we legalize
 

8021
02:11:31,739 --> 02:11:33,890
you pull and you say should we legalize
marijuana that number might pull at like

8022
02:11:33,890 --> 02:11:33,900
marijuana that number might pull at like
 

8023
02:11:33,900 --> 02:11:36,109
marijuana that number might pull at like
65 70 percent

8024
02:11:36,109 --> 02:11:36,119
65 70 percent
 

8025
02:11:36,119 --> 02:11:37,430
65 70 percent
but that's including people that are in

8026
02:11:37,430 --> 02:11:37,440
but that's including people that are in
 

8027
02:11:37,440 --> 02:11:38,930
but that's including people that are in
favor of medical marijuana if you were

8028
02:11:38,930 --> 02:11:38,940
favor of medical marijuana if you were
 

8029
02:11:38,940 --> 02:11:41,270
favor of medical marijuana if you were
to pull like should we legalize should

8030
02:11:41,270 --> 02:11:41,280
to pull like should we legalize should
 

8031
02:11:41,280 --> 02:11:43,310
to pull like should we legalize should
we decriminalize recreational use of

8032
02:11:43,310 --> 02:11:43,320
we decriminalize recreational use of
 

8033
02:11:43,320 --> 02:11:45,109
we decriminalize recreational use of
marijuana that never might drop to like

8034
02:11:45,109 --> 02:11:45,119
marijuana that never might drop to like
 

8035
02:11:45,119 --> 02:11:47,450
marijuana that never might drop to like
52 and then if you pull like should we

8036
02:11:47,450 --> 02:11:47,460
52 and then if you pull like should we
 

8037
02:11:47,460 --> 02:11:49,609
52 and then if you pull like should we
completely legalize not just completely

02:17:04,439 --> 02:17:06,530
I agree that there are going to be
different elements at play and how much

8348
02:17:06,530 --> 02:17:06,540
different elements at play and how much
 

8349
02:17:06,540 --> 02:17:09,770
different elements at play and how much
of those elements that lead us astray

8350
02:17:09,770 --> 02:17:09,780
of those elements that lead us astray
 

8351
02:17:09,780 --> 02:17:13,009
of those elements that lead us astray
can be attributed to the largeness of

8352
02:17:13,009 --> 02:17:13,019
can be attributed to the largeness of
 

8353
02:17:13,019 --> 02:17:15,469
can be attributed to the largeness of
the different systems so and the

8354
02:17:15,469 --> 02:17:15,479
the different systems so and the
 

8355
02:17:15,479 --> 02:17:18,290
the different systems so and the
different institutions like the the

8356
02:17:18,290 --> 02:17:18,300
different institutions like the the
 

8357
02:17:18,300 --> 02:17:20,990
different institutions like the the
media institutions and government

8358
02:17:20,990 --> 02:17:21,000
media institutions and government
 

8359
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,150
media institutions and government
the institutions that have a monopoly on

8360
02:17:23,150 --> 02:17:23,160
the institutions that have a monopoly on
 

8361
02:17:23,160 --> 02:17:25,129
the institutions that have a monopoly on
violence let's put it this way which is

8362
02:17:25,129 --> 02:17:25,139
violence let's put it this way which is
 

8363
02:17:25,139 --> 02:17:27,230
violence let's put it this way which is
what one way to define government sure

8364
02:17:27,230 --> 02:17:27,240
what one way to define government sure
 

8365
02:17:27,240 --> 02:17:28,790
what one way to define government sure
it's complicated

8366
02:17:28,790 --> 02:17:28,800
it's complicated
 

8367
02:17:28,800 --> 02:17:29,629
it's complicated
um there's definitely different

8368
02:17:29,629 --> 02:17:29,639
um there's definitely different
 

8369
02:17:29,639 --> 02:17:31,669
um there's definitely different
institutions at play I but I think that

8370
02:17:31,669 --> 02:17:31,679
institutions at play I but I think that
 

8371
02:17:31,679 --> 02:17:33,650
institutions at play I but I think that
like all I would say is like in

8372
02:17:33,650 --> 02:17:33,660
like all I would say is like in
 

8373
02:17:33,660 --> 02:17:34,790
like all I would say is like in
reference to my original point when

8374
02:17:34,790 --> 02:17:34,800
reference to my original point when
 

8375
02:17:34,800 --> 02:17:36,650
reference to my original point when
there becomes like broad consensus

8376
02:17:36,650 --> 02:17:36,660
there becomes like broad consensus
 

8377
02:17:36,660 --> 02:17:37,910
there becomes like broad consensus
around a thing I think the government

8378
02:17:37,910 --> 02:17:37,920
around a thing I think the government
 

8379
02:17:37,920 --> 02:17:39,230
around a thing I think the government
will usually follow it's not going to

8380
02:17:39,230 --> 02:17:39,240
will usually follow it's not going to
 

8381
02:17:39,240 --> 02:17:40,849
will usually follow it's not going to
fight it's going to follow more often

8382
02:17:40,849 --> 02:17:40,859
fight it's going to follow more often
 

8383
02:17:40,859 --> 02:17:41,870
fight it's going to follow more often
than not

8384
02:17:41,870 --> 02:17:41,880
than not
 

8385
02:17:41,880 --> 02:17:43,490
than not
um but I think that a lot of times I

8386
02:17:43,490 --> 02:17:43,500
um but I think that a lot of times I
 

8387
02:17:43,500 --> 02:17:45,049
um but I think that a lot of times I
think Americans think that there's more

8388
02:17:45,049 --> 02:17:45,059
think Americans think that there's more
 

8389
02:17:45,059 --> 02:17:46,790
think Americans think that there's more
consensus around certain issues and

8390
02:17:46,790 --> 02:17:46,800
consensus around certain issues and
 

8391
02:17:46,800 --> 02:17:48,589
consensus around certain issues and
there actually are um so like a really

8392
02:17:48,589 --> 02:17:48,599
there actually are um so like a really
 

8393
02:17:48,599 --> 02:17:49,849
there actually are um so like a really
good example we're on that warp Point

8394
02:17:49,849 --> 02:17:49,859
good example we're on that warp Point
 

8395
02:17:49,859 --> 02:17:51,049
good example we're on that warp Point
too

8396
02:17:51,049 --> 02:17:51,059
too
 

8397
02:17:51,059 --> 02:17:53,570
too
um what caused like the lowest dip in

8398
02:17:53,570 --> 02:17:53,580
um what caused like the lowest dip in
 

8399
02:17:53,580 --> 02:17:55,250
um what caused like the lowest dip in
Biden's approval rating

8400
02:17:55,250 --> 02:17:55,260
Biden's approval rating
 

8401
02:17:55,260 --> 02:17:56,750
Biden's approval rating
I'm pretty sure it was right after we

8402
02:17:56,750 --> 02:17:56,760
I'm pretty sure it was right after we
 

8403
02:17:56,760 --> 02:17:59,330
I'm pretty sure it was right after we
pulled out of Afghanistan which I think

8404
02:17:59,330 --> 02:17:59,340
pulled out of Afghanistan which I think
 

8405
02:17:59,340 --> 02:18:01,250
pulled out of Afghanistan which I think
if I would have asked people like a year

8406
02:18:01,250 --> 02:18:01,260
if I would have asked people like a year
 

8407
02:18:01,260 --> 02:18:02,990
if I would have asked people like a year
before like let's assume that we could

8408
02:18:02,990 --> 02:18:03,000
before like let's assume that we could
 

8409
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:04,730
before like let's assume that we could
pull out of Afghanistan

8410
02:18:04,730 --> 02:18:04,740
pull out of Afghanistan
 

8411
02:18:04,740 --> 02:18:05,750
pull out of Afghanistan
um the government's probably going to

8412
02:18:05,750 --> 02:18:05,760
um the government's probably going to
 

8413
02:18:05,760 --> 02:18:07,070
um the government's probably going to
collapse after we leave because they

8414
02:18:07,070 --> 02:18:07,080
collapse after we leave because they
 

8415
02:18:07,080 --> 02:18:08,150
collapse after we leave because they
just don't have the will to fight they

8416
02:18:08,150 --> 02:18:08,160
just don't have the will to fight they
 

8417
02:18:08,160 --> 02:18:08,990
just don't have the will to fight they
don't have the support they don't

8418
02:18:08,990 --> 02:18:09,000
don't have the support they don't
 

8419
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:10,070
don't have the support they don't
whatever they're just not going to work

8420
02:18:10,070 --> 02:18:10,080
whatever they're just not going to work
 

8421
02:18:10,080 --> 02:18:11,750
whatever they're just not going to work
but like no Americans are going to die

8422
02:18:11,750 --> 02:18:11,760
but like no Americans are going to die
 

8423
02:18:11,760 --> 02:18:13,250
but like no Americans are going to die
there might be a couple other people but

8424
02:18:13,250 --> 02:18:13,260
there might be a couple other people but
 

8425
02:18:13,260 --> 02:18:14,030
there might be a couple other people but
like no America's gonna die we're gonna

8426
02:18:14,030 --> 02:18:14,040
like no America's gonna die we're gonna
 

8427
02:18:14,040 --> 02:18:15,830
like no America's gonna die we're gonna
say would you support that I think

8428
02:18:15,830 --> 02:18:15,840
say would you support that I think
 

8429
02:18:15,840 --> 02:18:18,049
say would you support that I think
broadly speaking I think I think like

8430
02:18:18,049 --> 02:18:18,059
broadly speaking I think I think like
 

8431
02:18:18,059 --> 02:18:20,089
broadly speaking I think I think like
more than 60 or 70 of Americans are like

8432
02:18:20,089 --> 02:18:20,099
more than 60 or 70 of Americans are like
 

8433
02:18:20,099 --> 02:18:21,709
more than 60 or 70 of Americans are like
yeah that would be fine but then when it

8434
02:18:21,709 --> 02:18:21,719
yeah that would be fine but then when it
 

8435
02:18:21,719 --> 02:18:23,209
yeah that would be fine but then when it
actually plays it on TV when we see the

8436
02:18:23,209 --> 02:18:23,219
actually plays it on TV when we see the
 

8437
02:18:23,219 --> 02:18:24,770
actually plays it on TV when we see the
people hang on to the planes when we see

8438
02:18:24,770 --> 02:18:24,780
people hang on to the planes when we see
 

8439
02:18:24,780 --> 02:18:26,389
people hang on to the planes when we see
like helicopter Embassy some of the

8440
02:18:26,389 --> 02:18:26,399
like helicopter Embassy some of the
 

8441
02:18:26,399 --> 02:18:27,950
like helicopter Embassy some of the
quotes from politicians well now it's

8442
02:18:27,950 --> 02:18:27,960
quotes from politicians well now it's
 

8443
02:18:27,960 --> 02:18:29,509
quotes from politicians well now it's
like oh my God this was horrible and it

8444
02:18:29,509 --> 02:18:29,519
like oh my God this was horrible and it
 

8445
02:18:29,519 --> 02:18:30,950
like oh my God this was horrible and it
was so botched and it was so like it

8446
02:18:30,950 --> 02:18:30,960
was so botched and it was so like it
 

8447
02:18:30,960 --> 02:18:31,969
was so botched and it was so like it
could have gone so much better well

8448
02:18:31,969 --> 02:18:31,979
could have gone so much better well
 

8449
02:18:31,979 --> 02:18:33,230
could have gone so much better well
could it have gone better like maybe

8450
02:18:33,230 --> 02:18:33,240
could it have gone better like maybe
 

8451
02:18:33,240 --> 02:18:35,990
could it have gone better like maybe
maybe not but I mean it seems like you

8452
02:18:35,990 --> 02:18:36,000
maybe not but I mean it seems like you
 

8453
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:37,009
maybe not but I mean it seems like you
can have consensus around its own

8454
02:18:37,009 --> 02:18:37,019
can have consensus around its own
 

8455
02:18:37,019 --> 02:18:39,469
can have consensus around its own
opinion but the way that things play out

8456
02:18:39,469 --> 02:18:39,479
opinion but the way that things play out
 

8457
02:18:39,479 --> 02:18:40,730
opinion but the way that things play out
and the way that people actually feel

8458
02:18:40,730 --> 02:18:40,740
and the way that people actually feel
 

8459
02:18:40,740 --> 02:18:42,469
and the way that people actually feel
it's actually way way way more

8460
02:18:42,469 --> 02:18:42,479
it's actually way way way more
 

8461
02:18:42,479 --> 02:18:44,389
it's actually way way way more
complicated and there's not usually this

8462
02:18:44,389 --> 02:18:44,399
complicated and there's not usually this
 

8463
02:18:44,399 --> 02:18:46,730
complicated and there's not usually this
broad consensus opinion when all right

8464
02:18:46,730 --> 02:18:46,740
broad consensus opinion when all right
 

8465
02:18:46,740 --> 02:18:48,530
broad consensus opinion when all right
yeah go ahead I'd like to believe that I

8466
02:18:48,530 --> 02:18:48,540
yeah go ahead I'd like to believe that I
 

8467
02:18:48,540 --> 02:18:51,650
yeah go ahead I'd like to believe that I
mean just to leave my cars out on the

8468
02:18:51,650 --> 02:18:51,660
mean just to leave my cars out on the
 

8469
02:18:51,660 --> 02:18:53,750
mean just to leave my cars out on the
table

8470
02:18:53,750 --> 02:18:53,760
table
 

8471
02:18:53,760 --> 02:18:56,629
table
I have uh faith

8472
02:18:56,629 --> 02:18:56,639
I have uh faith
 

8473
02:18:56,639 --> 02:18:59,929
I have uh faith
in the power of Effective Government

8474
02:18:59,929 --> 02:18:59,939
in the power of Effective Government
 

8475
02:18:59,939 --> 02:19:01,790
in the power of Effective Government
I just

8476
02:19:01,790 --> 02:19:01,800
I just
 

8477
02:19:01,800 --> 02:19:03,049
I just
have

8478
02:19:03,049 --> 02:19:03,059
have
 

8479
02:19:03,059 --> 02:19:05,089
have
um a lot of concern about what happens

8480
02:19:05,089 --> 02:19:05,099
um a lot of concern about what happens
 

8481
02:19:05,099 --> 02:19:07,849
um a lot of concern about what happens
as institutions grow in size for sure

8482
02:19:07,849 --> 02:19:07,859
as institutions grow in size for sure
 

8483
02:19:07,859 --> 02:19:09,830
as institutions grow in size for sure
and I just have a lot of worry about the

8484
02:19:09,830 --> 02:19:09,840
and I just have a lot of worry about the
 

8485
02:19:09,840 --> 02:19:12,589
and I just have a lot of worry about the
natural corrupting influence on the

8486
02:19:12,589 --> 02:19:12,599
natural corrupting influence on the
 

8487
02:19:12,599 --> 02:19:15,349
natural corrupting influence on the
individuals and on the system as a whole

8488
02:19:15,349 --> 02:19:15,359
individuals and on the system as a whole
 

8489
02:19:15,359 --> 02:19:17,990
individuals and on the system as a whole
like the the boys club nature of it I

8490
02:19:17,990 --> 02:19:18,000
like the the boys club nature of it I
 

8491
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:19,070
like the the boys club nature of it I
don't know there must be a better term

8492
02:19:19,070 --> 02:19:19,080
don't know there must be a better term
 

8493
02:19:19,080 --> 02:19:21,049
don't know there must be a better term
but basically they

8494
02:19:21,049 --> 02:19:21,059
but basically they
 

8495
02:19:21,059 --> 02:19:23,030
but basically they
they agreed to the game and they play

8496
02:19:23,030 --> 02:19:23,040
they agreed to the game and they play
 

8497
02:19:23,040 --> 02:19:25,490
they agreed to the game and they play
the game and there's a generational

8498
02:19:25,490 --> 02:19:25,500
the game and there's a generational
 

8499
02:19:25,500 --> 02:19:28,669
the game and there's a generational
aspect momentum to the game and they

8500
02:19:28,669 --> 02:19:28,679
aspect momentum to the game and they
 

8501
02:19:28,679 --> 02:19:30,830
aspect momentum to the game and they
more and more stop being responsive to

8502
02:19:30,830 --> 02:19:30,840
more and more stop being responsive to
 

8503
02:19:30,840 --> 02:19:33,290
more and more stop being responsive to
the people that they represent I just

8504

the people that they represent I just
 

8505
02:19:33,300 --> 02:19:36,110
the people that they represent I just
feel like there is that mechanism and I

8506
02:19:36,110 --> 02:19:36,120
feel like there is that mechanism and I
 

8507
02:19:36,120 --> 02:19:39,469
feel like there is that mechanism and I
think the nice thing democracy elections

8508
02:19:39,469 --> 02:19:39,479
think the nice thing democracy elections
 

8509
02:19:39,479 --> 02:19:41,270
think the nice thing democracy elections
are resistance to that natural human

8510
02:19:41,270 --> 02:19:41,280
are resistance to that natural human
 

8511
02:19:41,280 --> 02:19:42,830
are resistance to that natural human
mechanism

8512
02:19:42,830 --> 02:19:42,840
mechanism
 

8513
02:19:42,840 --> 02:19:44,690
mechanism
um also the balances of power is a

8514
02:19:44,690 --> 02:19:44,700
um also the balances of power is a
 

8515
02:19:44,700 --> 02:19:46,610
um also the balances of power is a
resistance to that mechanism in some

8516
02:19:46,610 --> 02:19:46,620
resistance to that mechanism in some
 

8517
02:19:46,620 --> 02:19:48,889
resistance to that mechanism in some
ways the media that reveals the [\h__\h]

8518
02:19:48,889 --> 02:19:48,899
ways the media that reveals the [\h__\h]
 

8519
02:19:48,899 --> 02:19:51,349
ways the media that reveals the [\h__\h]

02:19:51,349 --> 02:19:51,359
of politicians is also a resistance to
 

8521
02:19:51,359 --> 02:19:53,210
of politicians is also a resistance to
that mechanism it's it's hard to be full

8522
02:19:53,210 --> 02:19:53,220
that mechanism it's it's hard to be full
 

8523
02:19:53,220 --> 02:19:55,250
that mechanism it's it's hard to be full

try to catch you on it so there's a
 

8527
02:19:57,660 --> 02:20:00,650
try to catch you on it so there's a
honesty method there that keeps you

8528
02:20:00,650 --> 02:20:00,660
honesty method there that keeps you
 

8529
02:20:00,660 --> 02:20:03,650
honesty method there that keeps you
honest it's to some degree but it still

8530
02:20:03,650 --> 02:20:03,660
honest it's to some degree but it still
 

8531
02:20:03,660 --> 02:20:06,250
honest it's to some degree but it still
feels like

8532
02:20:06,250 --> 02:20:06,260
feels like
 

8533
02:20:06,260 --> 02:20:08,690
feels like
it still feels like politicians are

8534
02:20:08,690 --> 02:20:08,700
it still feels like politicians are
 

8535
02:20:08,700 --> 02:20:10,429
it still feels like politicians are
going to politician

8536
02:20:10,429 --> 02:20:10,439
going to politician
 

8537
02:20:10,439 --> 02:20:11,990
going to politician
yeah they definitely play their games

8538
02:20:11,990 --> 02:20:12,000
yeah they definitely play their games
 

8539
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,330
yeah they definitely play their games
that is true but there's probably always

8540
02:20:14,330 --> 02:20:14,340
that is true but there's probably always
 

8541
02:20:14,340 --> 02:20:15,950
that is true but there's probably always
going to be that meta narrative over

8542
02:20:15,950 --> 02:20:15,960
going to be that meta narrative over
 

8543
02:20:15,960 --> 02:20:18,710
going to be that meta narrative over
like governance that just develops as

like governance that just develops as
 

8545

like you have to form relationships and
play games to play get legislation

8548
02:20:21,710 --> 02:20:21,720
play games to play get legislation
 

8549
02:20:21,720 --> 02:20:23,929
play games to play get legislation
passed and everything the all the only

02:20:23,929 --> 02:20:23,939
passed and everything the all the only
 

8551
02:20:23,939 --> 02:20:25,250

reason why I don't like it when people

8552
02:20:25,250 --> 02:20:25,260
reason why I don't like it when people
 

8553
02:20:25,260 --> 02:20:27,110
reason why I don't like it when people
attack institutions is because one

8554
02:20:27,110 --> 02:20:27,120
attack institutions is because one
 

8555
02:20:27,120 --> 02:20:28,849
attack institutions is because one
institutions are incredibly important

8556
02:20:28,849 --> 02:20:28,859
institutions are incredibly important
 

8557
02:20:28,859 --> 02:20:30,710
institutions are incredibly important
arguably Paramount no they are to

8558
02:20:30,710 --> 02:20:30,720
arguably Paramount no they are to
 

8559
02:20:30,720 --> 02:20:33,290
arguably Paramount no they are to
keeping Society Running and two I think

8560
02:20:33,290 --> 02:20:33,300
keeping Society Running and two I think
 

8561
02:20:33,300 --> 02:20:34,849
keeping Society Running and two I think
sometimes when we shift the blame onto

8562
02:20:34,849 --> 02:20:34,859
sometimes when we shift the blame onto
 

8563
02:20:34,859 --> 02:20:36,830
sometimes when we shift the blame onto
institutions too much I think that we

8564
02:20:36,830 --> 02:20:36,840
institutions too much I think that we
 

8565
02:20:36,840 --> 02:20:38,270
institutions too much I think that we
lose sight of what the real problems are

8566
02:20:38,270 --> 02:20:38,280
lose sight of what the real problems are
 

8567
02:20:38,280 --> 02:20:40,250
lose sight of what the real problems are
so for instance in the United States

8568
02:20:40,250 --> 02:20:40,260
so for instance in the United States
 

8569
02:20:40,260 --> 02:20:42,170
so for instance in the United States
today people might be very critical of

8570
02:20:42,170 --> 02:20:42,180
today people might be very critical of
 

8571
02:20:42,180 --> 02:20:44,270
today people might be very critical of
the government not getting much done but

8572
02:20:44,270 --> 02:20:44,280
the government not getting much done but
 

8573
02:20:44,280 --> 02:20:45,590
the government not getting much done but
then everybody turns their eyes to the

8574
02:20:45,590 --> 02:20:45,600
then everybody turns their eyes to the
 

8575
02:20:45,600 --> 02:20:47,330
then everybody turns their eyes to the
government for being ineffective but

8576
02:20:47,330 --> 02:20:47,340
government for being ineffective but
 

8577
02:20:47,340 --> 02:20:48,710
government for being ineffective but
what I would argue is I would say the

8578
02:20:48,710 --> 02:20:48,720
what I would argue is I would say the
 

8579
02:20:48,720 --> 02:20:50,330
what I would argue is I would say the
government is actually incredibly

8580
02:20:50,330 --> 02:20:50,340
government is actually incredibly
 

8581
02:20:50,340 --> 02:20:52,309
government is actually incredibly
effective and it's showcasing the will

8582
02:20:52,309 --> 02:20:52,319
effective and it's showcasing the will
 

8583
02:20:52,319 --> 02:20:53,929
effective and it's showcasing the will
of the American people really well right

8584
02:20:53,929 --> 02:20:53,939
of the American people really well right
 

8585
02:20:53,939 --> 02:20:56,030
of the American people really well right
now which is we are historically more

8586
02:20:56,030 --> 02:20:56,040
now which is we are historically more
 

8587
02:20:56,040 --> 02:20:58,370
now which is we are historically more
divided than we have ever been and if I

8588
02:20:58,370 --> 02:20:58,380
divided than we have ever been and if I
 

8589
02:20:58,380 --> 02:20:59,690
divided than we have ever been and if I
were to just look at the people and I

8590
02:20:59,690 --> 02:20:59,700
were to just look at the people and I
 

8591
02:20:59,700 --> 02:21:02,270
were to just look at the people and I
would say we have a historic divide that

8592
02:21:02,270 --> 02:21:02,280
would say we have a historic divide that
 

8593
02:21:02,280 --> 02:21:04,429
would say we have a historic divide that
is getting like rapidly blown apart by

8594
02:21:04,429 --> 02:21:04,439
is getting like rapidly blown apart by
 

8595
02:21:04,439 --> 02:21:05,690
is getting like rapidly blown apart by
things like the internet and the media

8596
02:21:05,690 --> 02:21:05,700
things like the internet and the media
 

8597
02:21:05,700 --> 02:21:07,429
things like the internet and the media
right if that exists well what would I

8598
02:21:07,429 --> 02:21:07,439
right if that exists well what would I
 

8599
02:21:07,439 --> 02:21:08,929
right if that exists well what would I
expect the government to look like I

8600
02:21:08,929 --> 02:21:08,939
expect the government to look like I
 

8601
02:21:08,939 --> 02:21:09,830
expect the government to look like I
wouldn't expect the government to be

8602
02:21:09,830 --> 02:21:09,840
wouldn't expect the government to be
 

8603
02:21:09,840 --> 02:21:11,389
wouldn't expect the government to be
governing very fast I would expect that

8604
02:21:11,389 --> 02:21:11,399
governing very fast I would expect that
 

8605
02:21:11,399 --> 02:21:13,250
governing very fast I would expect that
government to show that legitimate

8606
02:21:13,250 --> 02:21:13,260
government to show that legitimate
 

8607
02:21:13,260 --> 02:21:15,170
government to show that legitimate

right now I think there is a huge divide
 

8645
02:21:48,540 --> 02:21:49,910
right now I think there is a huge divide
in terms of the direction they want to

8646
02:21:49,910 --> 02:21:49,920
in terms of the direction they want to
 

8647
02:21:49,920 --> 02:21:51,170
in terms of the direction they want to
see the country go and what they believe

really and what they even believe is
reality right unfortunately that's where

8652
02:21:54,410 --> 02:21:54,420
reality right unfortunately that's where
 

8653
02:21:54,420 --> 02:21:55,730
reality right unfortunately that's where
we've gotten to

8654
02:21:55,730 --> 02:21:55,740
we've gotten to
 

8655
02:21:55,740 --> 02:21:57,710
we've gotten to
can I just speak about the mechanism of

8656
02:21:57,710 --> 02:21:57,720
can I just speak about the mechanism of
 

8657
02:21:57,720 --> 02:21:59,809
can I just speak about the mechanism of
the left and right here maybe on the

8658
02:21:59,809 --> 02:21:59,819
the left and right here maybe on the
 

8659
02:21:59,819 --> 02:22:02,630
the left and right here maybe on the
memetic ratherly aspect is there some

8660
02:22:02,630 --> 02:22:02,640
memetic ratherly aspect is there some

between both sides I think that the left

8707
02:22:44,640 --> 02:22:45,830
between both sides I think that the left
just kind of gets highlighted more

8708

just kind of gets highlighted more
 

8709

people have kind of been pushed off of
 

8725
02:22:57,600 --> 02:22:59,330
people have kind of been pushed off of
the main areas of the internet now

8726
02:22:59,330 --> 02:22:59,340
the main areas of the internet now
 

8727
02:22:59,340 --> 02:23:01,790
the main areas of the internet now
interesting my sense was that it's hard

8728
02:23:01,790 --> 02:23:01,800
interesting my sense was that it's hard
 

8729
02:23:01,800 --> 02:23:03,830
interesting my sense was that it's hard
to exist on the center left

8730
02:23:03,830 --> 02:23:03,840
to exist on the center left
 

8731
02:23:03,840 --> 02:23:06,050
to exist on the center left
but maybe because I just don't have the

8732
02:23:06,050 --> 02:23:06,060
but maybe because I just don't have the
 

8733
02:23:06,060 --> 02:23:08,270
but maybe because I just don't have the
full spectrum view of the political

8734
02:23:08,270 --> 02:23:08,280
full spectrum view of the political
 

8735
02:23:08,280 --> 02:23:10,190
full spectrum view of the political
divide it felt like Central Lots is a

8736
02:23:10,190 --> 02:23:10,200
divide it felt like Central Lots is a
 

8737
02:23:10,200 --> 02:23:11,630
divide it felt like Central Lots is a
difficult position to occupy yeah I

8738
02:23:11,630 --> 02:23:11,640
difficult position to occupy yeah I
 

8739
02:23:11,640 --> 02:23:13,250
difficult position to occupy yeah I
would definitely say so yeah I don't

8740
02:23:13,250 --> 02:23:13,260
would definitely say so yeah I don't
 

8741
02:23:13,260 --> 02:23:14,990
would definitely say so yeah I don't
know if it's that difficult to be center

8742
02:23:14,990 --> 02:23:15,000
know if it's that difficult to be center
 

8743
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:16,790
know if it's that difficult to be center

02:23:18,710 --> 02:23:18,720
right I think actually maybe even more
 

8747
02:23:18,720 --> 02:23:20,270
right I think actually maybe even more
difficult because the center right

8748
02:23:20,270 --> 02:23:20,280
difficult because the center right
 

8749
02:23:20,280 --> 02:23:21,710
difficult because the center right

8775
02:23:42,479 --> 02:23:45,230
uh there's a Ben Shapiro who I'm talking
with I think he publicly spoke against

8776
02:23:45,230 --> 02:23:45,240
with I think he publicly spoke against
 

8777
02:23:45,240 --> 02:23:47,510
with I think he publicly spoke against
Trump right he did initially but I feel

8778
02:23:47,510 --> 02:23:47,520
Trump right he did initially but I feel
 

8779
02:23:47,520 --> 02:23:48,770
Trump right he did initially but I feel
like he softened his language up on him

8780
02:23:48,770 --> 02:23:48,780
like he softened his language up on him
 

8781
02:23:48,780 --> 02:23:50,389
like he softened his language up on him
pretty significantly but so there's a

8782
02:23:50,389 --> 02:23:50,399
pretty significantly but so there's a
 

8783
02:23:50,399 --> 02:23:52,550
pretty significantly but so there's a
significant pressure to kind of coverage

8784
02:23:52,550 --> 02:23:52,560
significant pressure to kind of coverage
 

8785
02:23:52,560 --> 02:23:54,110
significant pressure to kind of coverage
out to a certain kind of messaging which

8786
02:23:54,110 --> 02:23:54,120
out to a certain kind of messaging which
 

8787
02:23:54,120 --> 02:23:55,610
out to a certain kind of messaging which
the whole Republican party is feeling

out on a limb yeah so like to take risks
 

9345
02:32:52,439 --> 02:32:55,010
out on a limb yeah so like to take risks
for example I've heard that with uh lab

9346
02:32:55,010 --> 02:32:55,020
for example I've heard that with uh lab
 

9347

like yeah it's obviously leaked from a

9352
02:33:00,889 --> 02:33:00,899
like yeah it's obviously leaked from a
 

9353
02:33:00,899 --> 02:33:04,309
like yeah it's obviously leaked from a
lab like early on oh maybe okay we can

9354
02:33:04,309 --> 02:33:04,319
lab like early on oh maybe okay we can
 

9355
02:33:04,319 --> 02:33:06,830
lab like early on oh maybe okay we can
fight over this one but sorry guys we

9356
02:33:06,830 --> 02:33:06,840
fight over this one but sorry guys we
 

9357
02:33:06,840 --> 02:33:09,290
fight over this one but sorry guys we
can fight over this like they okay I

9358
02:33:09,290 --> 02:33:09,300
can fight over this like they okay I
 

9359
02:33:09,300 --> 02:33:11,809
can fight over this like they okay I
should sort of backstep and say like

9360
02:33:11,809 --> 02:33:11,819
should sort of backstep and say like
 

9361
02:33:11,819 --> 02:33:13,670
should sort of backstep and say like
that's like you talk about shooting the

9362
02:33:13,670 --> 02:33:13,680
that's like you talk about shooting the
 

9363
02:33:13,680 --> 02:33:15,050
that's like you talk about shooting the
shed you haven't really investigated but

9364
02:33:15,050 --> 02:33:15,060
shed you haven't really investigated but
 

9365
02:33:15,060 --> 02:33:16,910
shed you haven't really investigated but
it's your gut like this doesn't make any

9366
02:33:16,910 --> 02:33:16,920
it's your gut like this doesn't make any
 

9367
02:33:16,920 --> 02:33:18,590
it's your gut like this doesn't make any
sense there would never say that

9368
02:33:18,590 --> 02:33:18,600
sense there would never say that
 

9369
02:33:18,600 --> 02:33:21,290
sense there would never say that
publicly of course mostly because you're

9370
02:33:21,290 --> 02:33:21,300
publicly of course mostly because you're
 

9371
02:33:21,300 --> 02:33:23,450
publicly of course mostly because you're
saying like what they would all say is

9372
02:33:23,450 --> 02:33:23,460
saying like what they would all say is
 

9373
02:33:23,460 --> 02:33:25,490
saying like what they would all say is
like we want to see data yeah which

9374
02:33:25,490 --> 02:33:25,500
like we want to see data yeah which
 

9375
02:33:25,500 --> 02:33:27,050
like we want to see data yeah which
would be good which is fine so they're

9376
02:33:27,050 --> 02:33:27,060
would be good which is fine so they're
 

9377
02:33:27,060 --> 02:33:28,969
would be good which is fine so they're
going with like like this is too many

9378
02:33:28,969 --> 02:33:28,979
going with like like this is too many
 

9379
02:33:28,979 --> 02:33:30,710
going with like like this is too many
coincidence in the same place that's the

9380
02:33:30,710 --> 02:33:30,720
coincidence in the same place that's the
 

9381
02:33:30,720 --> 02:33:32,450
coincidence in the same place that's the
the logic but they don't want to say

9382
02:33:32,450 --> 02:33:32,460
the logic but they don't want to say
 

9383
02:33:32,460 --> 02:33:34,010
the logic but they don't want to say
anything because there's no data you

9384
02:33:34,010 --> 02:33:34,020
anything because there's no data you
 

9385
02:33:34,020 --> 02:33:35,450
anything because there's no data you
need to have evidence you need to have

9386
02:33:35,450 --> 02:33:35,460
need to have evidence you need to have
 

9387
02:33:35,460 --> 02:33:37,010
need to have evidence you need to have
actual evidence to say one way or the

9388
02:33:37,010 --> 02:33:37,020
actual evidence to say one way or the
 

9389
02:33:37,020 --> 02:33:39,650
actual evidence to say one way or the
other there's that but there's also just

9390
02:33:39,650 --> 02:33:39,660
other there's that but there's also just
 

9391
02:33:39,660 --> 02:33:41,510
other there's that but there's also just
like you said I mean if effective

9392
02:33:41,510 --> 02:33:41,520
like you said I mean if effective
 

9393
02:33:41,520 --> 02:33:43,610
like you said I mean if effective

engaged with it at all there's really
 

9539
02:36:02,819 --> 02:36:04,250
engaged with it at all there's really
interesting interesting research that

9540
02:36:04,250 --> 02:36:04,260
interesting interesting research that
 

9541
02:36:04,260 --> 02:36:05,809
interesting interesting research that
shows us a really strong study that

9542
02:36:05,809 --> 02:36:05,819
shows us a really strong study that
 

9543
02:36:05,819 --> 02:36:07,670
shows us a really strong study that
shows that there's like a high degree of

9544

shows that there's like a high degree of
 

9545
02:36:07,680 --> 02:36:09,410
shows that there's like a high degree of
certainty that it came from the wet

9546
02:36:09,410 --> 02:36:09,420
certainty that it came from the wet
 

9547
02:36:09,420 --> 02:36:11,389
certainty that it came from the wet
markets very very high degree of

9548

markets very very high degree of
 

9549
02:36:11,399 --> 02:36:12,770
markets very very high degree of
certainty and there was an article that

9550

um from these kind of like first
 

9959
02:42:41,939 --> 02:42:44,210
um from these kind of like first
principles out of that is where all of

10701
02:54:15,180 --> 02:54:16,670
measured pretty calm the whole time and
think he started to get increasingly

10702
02:54:16,670 --> 02:54:16,680
think he started to get increasingly
 

10703
02:54:16,680 --> 02:54:18,950
think he started to get increasingly
irritated that I was levying like more

10704
02:54:18,950 --> 02:54:18,960
irritated that I was levying like more
 

10705
02:54:18,960 --> 02:54:20,750
irritated that I was levying like more
and more serious criticisms at like the

10706
02:54:20,750 --> 02:54:20,760

10709
02:54:22,500 --> 02:54:23,750
quality of work that he did
um probably because he felt a little bit

10710
02:54:23,750 --> 02:54:23,760
um probably because he felt a little bit
 

10711
02:54:23,760 --> 02:54:26,090
um probably because he felt a little bit
intimidated I think by my willingness to

after that was 50 seconds okay but that
 

11053
02:59:59,640 --> 03:00:01,610
after that was 50 seconds okay but that
you never know the point is you never

11054
03:00:01,610 --> 03:00:01,620
you never know the point is you never

say something like that listen like that
 

11057
03:00:03,479 --> 03:00:05,330
say something like that listen like that
you you've spoken about the Bosnia

11058
03:00:05,330 --> 03:00:05,340
you you've spoken about the Bosnia
 

11059
03:00:05,340 --> 03:00:06,830
you you've spoken about the Bosnia
speech which is your favorite of his

11060
03:00:06,830 --> 03:00:06,840
speech which is your favorite of his
 

11061
03:00:06,840 --> 03:00:08,870
speech which is your favorite of his
yeah I went back to and listened to it

11062
03:00:08,870 --> 03:00:08,880
yeah I went back to and listened to it
 

11063
03:00:08,880 --> 03:00:10,969
yeah I went back to and listened to it
before I move to that just on this it's

11064
03:00:10,969 --> 03:00:10,979
before I move to that just on this it's
 

11065
03:00:10,979 --> 03:00:12,650
before I move to that just on this it's
really hard for him to call out that

11066
03:00:12,650 --> 03:00:12,660
really hard for him to call out that
 

11067
03:00:12,660 --> 03:00:14,150
really hard for him to call out that
group of like election deniers I think

11068
03:00:14,150 --> 03:00:14,160
group of like election deniers I think
 

11069
03:00:14,160 --> 03:00:15,830
group of like election deniers I think
without it always feeling well why call

11070
03:00:15,830 --> 03:00:15,840
without it always feeling well why call
 

11071
03:00:15,840 --> 03:00:18,410
without it always feeling well why call
them out because it's arguably one of

11072
03:00:18,410 --> 03:00:18,420
them out because it's arguably one of
 

11073
03:00:18,420 --> 03:00:19,730
them out because it's arguably one of
the most destructive forces that exists

11074
03:00:19,730 --> 03:00:19,740
the most destructive forces that exists
 

11075
03:00:19,740 --> 03:00:22,070
the most destructive forces that exists
in this country today did it destroy

11076
03:00:22,070 --> 03:00:22,080
in this country today did it destroy
 

11077
03:00:22,080 --> 03:00:24,830
in this country today did it destroy
anything they were trying to did it

11078
03:00:24,830 --> 03:00:24,840
anything they were trying to did it
 

11079
03:00:24,840 --> 03:00:25,730
anything they were trying to did it
though

11080
03:00:25,730 --> 03:00:25,740
though
 

11081
03:00:25,740 --> 03:00:28,010
though
it didn't did it so does that mean we

11082
03:00:28,010 --> 03:00:28,020
it didn't did it so does that mean we
 

11083
03:00:28,020 --> 03:00:29,450
it didn't did it so does that mean we
don't call it out we wait till next time

11084
03:00:29,450 --> 03:00:29,460
don't call it out we wait till next time
 

11085
03:00:29,460 --> 03:00:32,870
don't call it out we wait till next time
because calling it out is giving fuel to

11086
03:00:32,870 --> 03:00:32,880
because calling it out is giving fuel to
 

11087
03:00:32,880 --> 03:00:34,070
because calling it out is giving fuel to
the division

11088
03:00:34,070 --> 03:00:34,080
the division
 

11089
03:00:34,080 --> 03:00:36,469
the division
like the people that doubted the

11090
03:00:36,469 --> 03:00:36,479
like the people that doubted the
 

11091
03:00:36,479 --> 03:00:38,929
like the people that doubted the
validity of the election that's anger

11092
03:00:38,929 --> 03:00:38,939
validity of the election that's anger
 

11093
03:00:38,939 --> 03:00:40,610
validity of the election that's anger
that's frustration with the other side

11094
03:00:40,610 --> 03:00:40,620
that's frustration with the other side
 

11095
03:00:40,620 --> 03:00:43,790
that's frustration with the other side
you heal that as opposed to saying all

11096
03:00:43,790 --> 03:00:43,800
you heal that as opposed to saying all
 

11097
03:00:43,800 --> 03:00:46,190
you heal that as opposed to saying all
those people that believed that at any

11098
03:00:46,190 --> 03:00:46,200

people can't handle it and they they
agree to something and then they realize

agree to something and then they realize
 

13041
03:31:10,319 --> 03:31:12,170

that they're way too cool and then they

03:31:12,170 --> 03:31:12,180
that they're way too cool and then they
 

13043
03:31:12,180 --> 03:31:13,729
that they're way too cool and then they
get really obsessed and they think that

13044
03:31:13,729 --> 03:31:13,739
get really obsessed and they think that
 

13045
03:31:13,739 --> 03:31:15,290
get really obsessed and they think that
they can like get in there and then it

they can like get in there and then it
 

13047
03:31:15,300 --> 03:31:17,450

I was a professional speaker of two

13370
03:36:23,690 --> 03:36:23,700
I was a professional speaker of two
 

13371
03:36:23,700 --> 03:36:25,070
I was a professional speaker of two
players so I remember when the AI

13372
03:36:25,070 --> 03:36:25,080
players so I remember when the AI
 

13373
03:36:25,080 --> 03:36:26,750
players so I remember when the AI
started to play it's interesting the

13374
03:36:26,750 --> 03:36:26,760
started to play it's interesting the
 

13375
03:36:26,760 --> 03:36:28,130
started to play it's interesting the
types of restrictions that you would

13376
03:36:28,130 --> 03:36:28,140
types of restrictions that you would
 

13377
03:36:28,140 --> 03:36:29,809
types of restrictions that you would
have to put on like a gaming robot to

13378
03:36:29,809 --> 03:36:29,819
have to put on like a gaming robot to
 

13379
03:36:29,819 --> 03:36:31,790
have to put on like a gaming robot to
make it like functional and not totally

13380
03:36:31,790 --> 03:36:31,800
make it like functional and not totally
 

13381
03:36:31,800 --> 03:36:34,070
make it like functional and not totally
unfair to the other side yeah to make a

13382
03:36:34,070 --> 03:36:34,080
unfair to the other side yeah to make a
 

13383
03:36:34,080 --> 03:36:35,809
unfair to the other side yeah to make a
human-like yeah was that interesting to

13384
03:36:35,809 --> 03:36:35,819
human-like yeah was that interesting to
 

13385
03:36:35,819 --> 03:36:37,969
human-like yeah was that interesting to
you to see AI be able to play those

13386
03:36:37,969 --> 03:36:37,979
you to see AI be able to play those
 

13387
03:36:37,979 --> 03:36:39,650
you to see AI be able to play those
video games I think in some ways people

13388
03:36:39,650 --> 03:36:39,660
video games I think in some ways people
 

13389
03:36:39,660 --> 03:36:40,910
video games I think in some ways people
think things are more complicated than

13390
03:36:40,910 --> 03:36:40,920
think things are more complicated than
 

13391
03:36:40,920 --> 03:36:42,410
think things are more complicated than
they actually are and I think video

13392
03:36:42,410 --> 03:36:42,420
they actually are and I think video
 

13393
03:36:42,420 --> 03:36:43,550
they actually are and I think video
games is one of those things where

13394
03:36:43,550 --> 03:36:43,560
games is one of those things where
 

13395
03:36:43,560 --> 03:36:45,050
games is one of those things where
really oh my God there's like a million

13396
03:36:45,050 --> 03:36:45,060
really oh my God there's like a million
 

13397
03:36:45,060 --> 03:36:46,969
really oh my God there's like a million
possibilities at every second and who

13398
03:36:46,969 --> 03:36:46,979
possibilities at every second and who
 

13399
03:36:46,979 --> 03:36:48,050
possibilities at every second and who
knows and it's like no there's like

13400
03:36:48,050 --> 03:36:48,060
knows and it's like no there's like
 

13401
03:36:48,060 --> 03:36:49,250
knows and it's like no there's like
three or four things going at any point

13402
03:36:49,250 --> 03:36:49,260
three or four things going at any point
 

13403
03:36:49,260 --> 03:36:50,630
three or four things going at any point
in time and I'm willing to bet that like

13404
03:36:50,630 --> 03:36:50,640
in time and I'm willing to bet that like
 

13405
03:36:50,640 --> 03:36:51,950
in time and I'm willing to bet that like
an AI could probably solve some of these

13406
03:36:51,950 --> 03:36:51,960
an AI could probably solve some of these
 

13407
03:36:51,960 --> 03:36:53,690
an AI could probably solve some of these
games like pretty easily

13408
03:36:53,690 --> 03:36:53,700
games like pretty easily
 

13409
03:36:53,700 --> 03:36:54,830
games like pretty easily
um especially if there are no

13410
03:36:54,830 --> 03:36:54,840
um especially if there are no
 

13411
03:36:54,840 --> 03:36:56,110
um especially if there are no
constraints on how they can learn yeah

I think the analysis on how men and
women interact is a way to transactional

13672
03:41:15,769 --> 03:41:15,779
women interact is a way to transactional

how do you basically have sex with the
most amount of women possible and that's

13682
03:41:25,070 --> 03:41:25,080
most amount of women possible and that's

most amount of women possible and that's
going to make you happy

literally so
I think for sure people in that world

13824
03:43:40,269 --> 03:43:40,279
I think for sure people in that world
 

13825

I think for sure people in that world
have fewer meaningful long-term

13826
03:43:43,849 --> 03:43:43,859
have fewer meaningful long-term
 

13827
03:43:43,859 --> 03:43:45,590
have fewer meaningful long-term
relationships that are fulfilling they

13828
03:43:45,590 --> 03:43:45,600
relationships that are fulfilling they
 

13829
03:43:45,600 --> 03:43:47,750
relationships that are fulfilling they
actually help them succeed in life that

13830
03:43:47,750 --> 03:43:47,760
actually help them succeed in life that
 

13831
03:43:47,760 --> 03:43:49,309
actually help them succeed in life that
help them be happy and content and all

13832
03:43:49,309 --> 03:43:49,319
help them be happy and content and all
 

13833
03:43:49,319 --> 03:43:51,290
help them be happy and content and all
that kind of stuff but just even the

13834
03:43:51,290 --> 03:43:51,300
that kind of stuff but just even the
 

13835
03:43:51,300 --> 03:43:52,969
that kind of stuff but just even the
straight up the the shallow goal of

13836
03:43:52,969 --> 03:43:52,979
straight up the the shallow goal of
 

13837
03:43:52,979 --> 03:43:54,830
straight up the the shallow goal of
getting laid

13838
03:43:54,830 --> 03:43:54,840
getting laid
 

13839
03:43:54,840 --> 03:43:58,190
getting laid
I wonder because it's very possible that

13840
03:43:58,190 --> 03:43:58,200
I wonder because it's very possible that
 

13841
03:43:58,200 --> 03:44:00,050
I wonder because it's very possible that
like just the the roughness with which

13842
03:44:00,050 --> 03:44:00,060
like just the the roughness with which
 

13843
03:44:00,060 --> 03:44:03,769
like just the the roughness with which
they uh treat intellectually women that

13844
03:44:03,769 --> 03:44:03,779
they uh treat intellectually women that
 

13845
03:44:03,779 --> 03:44:06,110
they uh treat intellectually women that
might lead to lower success not higher

13846
03:44:06,110 --> 03:44:06,120
might lead to lower success not higher
 

13847
03:44:06,120 --> 03:44:08,389
might lead to lower success not higher
success it's very adversarial which I

13848
03:44:08,389 --> 03:44:08,399
success it's very adversarial which I
 

13849
03:44:08,399 --> 03:44:09,410
success it's very adversarial which I
think is always disappointing anything

13850
03:44:09,410 --> 03:44:09,420
think is always disappointing anything
 

13851
03:44:09,420 --> 03:44:10,790
think is always disappointing anything
that talks about men and women I think

13852
03:44:10,790 --> 03:44:10,800
that talks about men and women I think
 

13853
03:44:10,800 --> 03:44:12,469
that talks about men and women I think
it's good to acknowledge differences but

13854
03:44:12,469 --> 03:44:12,479
it's good to acknowledge differences but
 

13855
03:44:12,479 --> 03:44:13,790
it's good to acknowledge differences but
when it becomes like adversarial

13856
03:44:13,790 --> 03:44:13,800
when it becomes like adversarial
 

13857
03:44:13,800 --> 03:44:15,349
when it becomes like adversarial
especially when you talk about sex sex

13858
03:44:15,349 --> 03:44:15,359
especially when you talk about sex sex

03:44:15,359 --> 03:44:16,969
especially when you talk about sex sex
is something that men are getting and

13860
03:44:16,969 --> 03:44:16,979

13861
03:44:16,979 --> 03:44:18,469
is something that men are getting and
it's something that women are giving and

13862
03:44:18,469 --> 03:44:18,479
it's something that women are giving and
 

13863
03:44:18,479 --> 03:44:19,729
it's something that women are giving and
that type of like trade-off and the way

13864
03:44:19,729 --> 03:44:19,739
that type of like trade-off and the way
 

13865
03:44:19,739 --> 03:44:21,469
that type of like trade-off and the way
they talk about it is like yeah it sets

03:46:54,420 --> 03:46:56,030
date like a high value male
to the degree that he's a high value

14046
03:46:56,030 --> 03:46:56,040
to the degree that he's a high value
 

14047
03:46:56,040 --> 03:46:58,370
to the degree that he's a high value
male yes but like I don't think you'll

03:46:58,370 --> 03:46:58,380
male yes but like I don't think you'll
 

14049
03:46:58,380 --> 03:47:00,110
male yes but like I don't think you'll
feel that way the definition of high

14050
03:47:00,110 --> 03:47:00,120
feel that way the definition of high
 

14051
03:47:00,120 --> 03:47:02,990
feel that way the definition of high
value change is completely certainly the

14052
03:47:02,990 --> 03:47:03,000
value change is completely certainly the
 

14053
03:47:03,000 --> 03:47:04,250
value change is completely certainly the
stereotypical

14054
03:47:04,250 --> 03:47:04,260

measures the value contribute to the

14056
03:47:06,110 --> 03:47:06,120
measures the value contribute to the
 

14057
03:47:06,120 --> 03:47:07,610
measures the value contribute to the
calculation but it's so much more than

14058
03:47:07,610 --> 03:47:07,620
calculation but it's so much more than
 

14059
03:47:07,620 --> 03:47:09,530
calculation but it's so much more than
that I think on the chemistry of the

14084
03:47:36,830 --> 03:47:36,840
is who you are right like somebody tells
 

14085
03:47:36,840 --> 03:47:38,450
is who you are right like somebody tells
me like they have a 200 body count and

14086
03:47:38,450 --> 03:47:38,460
me like they have a 200 body count and
 

14087
03:47:38,460 --> 03:47:40,190
me like they have a 200 body count and
they're 16. something's probably going

14088
03:47:40,190 --> 03:47:40,200
they're 16. something's probably going
 

14089
03:47:40,200 --> 03:47:41,750
they're 16. something's probably going
on there that's not good I was thinking

14090
03:47:41,750 --> 03:47:41,760
on there that's not good I was thinking
 

14091
03:47:41,760 --> 03:47:43,010
on there that's not good I was thinking
about that you're like because it could

14092
03:47:43,010 --> 03:47:43,020
about that you're like because it could
 

14093
03:47:43,020 --> 03:47:44,330
about that you're like because it could
be like really young people that are

14094
03:47:44,330 --> 03:47:44,340
be like really young people that are
 

14095
03:47:44,340 --> 03:47:46,370
be like really young people that are
having some sort of like mental yeah

14096
03:47:46,370 --> 03:47:46,380
having some sort of like mental yeah
 

14097
03:47:46,380 --> 03:47:48,710
having some sort of like mental yeah
it's going on or somebody's like yeah 45

14098
03:47:48,710 --> 03:47:48,720
it's going on or somebody's like yeah 45
 

14099
03:47:48,720 --> 03:47:50,269
it's going on or somebody's like yeah 45
and they've like never had sex before

14100
03:47:50,269 --> 03:47:50,279
and they've like never had sex before
 

14101
03:47:50,279 --> 03:47:51,410
and they've like never had sex before
there's probably something going on

14102
03:47:51,410 --> 03:47:51,420
there's probably something going on
 

14103
03:47:51,420 --> 03:47:52,790
there's probably something going on
right so I could be indicative but if

14104
03:47:52,790 --> 03:47:52,800
right so I could be indicative but if
 

14105
03:47:52,800 --> 03:47:53,990
right so I could be indicative but if
somebody's like in their 20s and they've

14106
03:47:53,990 --> 03:47:54,000
somebody's like in their 20s and they've
 

14107
03:47:54,000 --> 03:47:55,670
somebody's like in their 20s and they've
had sex with you know 100 people or 50

14108
03:47:55,670 --> 03:47:55,680
had sex with you know 100 people or 50
 

14109
03:47:55,680 --> 03:47:56,870
had sex with you know 100 people or 50
people whatever it's you know whatever

14110
03:47:56,870 --> 03:47:56,880
people whatever it's you know whatever
 

14111
03:47:56,880 --> 03:47:59,090
people whatever it's you know whatever
there's more experience which can be

14112
03:47:59,090 --> 03:47:59,100
there's more experience which can be
 

14113
03:47:59,100 --> 03:48:01,250
there's more experience which can be
good sure okay so that that just

14114
03:48:01,250 --> 03:48:01,260
good sure okay so that that just
 

14115
03:48:01,260 --> 03:48:03,710
good sure okay so that that just
represents you're like sexually open and

14116
03:48:03,710 --> 03:48:03,720
represents you're like sexually open and
 

14117
03:48:03,720 --> 03:48:05,389
represents you're like sexually open and
so it doesn't really necessarily mean

14118
03:48:05,389 --> 03:48:05,399
so it doesn't really necessarily mean

communication but it's a gray area I

14768
03:58:30,769 --> 03:58:30,779
communication but it's a gray area I
 

14769
03:58:30,779 --> 03:58:31,729
communication but it's a gray area I
would say like something that is

14770
03:58:31,729 --> 03:58:31,739
would say like something that is
 

14771
03:58:31,739 --> 03:58:32,929
would say like something that is
probably recently done in that case

14772
03:58:32,929 --> 03:58:32,939
probably recently done in that case
 

14773
03:58:32,939 --> 03:58:34,790
probably recently done in that case
because it's been joking about women a

14774
03:58:34,790 --> 03:58:34,800
because it's been joking about women a
 

14775
03:58:34,800 --> 03:58:37,070
because it's been joking about women a
lot like it's women's fault they're bad

14776
03:58:37,070 --> 03:58:37,080
lot like it's women's fault they're bad
 

14777
03:58:37,080 --> 03:58:39,229
lot like it's women's fault they're bad
like it's just it's been like a lot of

14778
03:58:39,229 --> 03:58:39,239
like it's just it's been like a lot of
 

14779
03:58:39,239 --> 03:58:40,729
like it's just it's been like a lot of
jokes when it comes to misogyny I guess

14780
03:58:40,729 --> 03:58:40,739
jokes when it comes to misogyny I guess
 

14781
03:58:40,739 --> 03:58:42,469
jokes when it comes to misogyny I guess
in your community and I think it's

14782
03:58:42,469 --> 03:58:42,479
in your community and I think it's
 

14783
03:58:42,479 --> 03:58:43,910
in your community and I think it's
actually turned people a little bit that

14784
03:58:43,910 --> 03:58:43,920
actually turned people a little bit that
 

14785
03:58:43,920 --> 03:58:45,650
actually turned people a little bit that
way that's why we've done the research

14786
03:58:45,650 --> 03:58:45,660
way that's why we've done the research
 

14787
03:58:45,660 --> 03:58:47,450
way that's why we've done the research
yes so that's I guess that's actually

14788
03:58:47,450 --> 03:58:47,460
yes so that's I guess that's actually
 

14789
03:58:47,460 --> 03:58:49,189
yes so that's I guess that's actually
true because I don't think it was pretty

14790
03:58:49,189 --> 03:58:49,199
true because I don't think it was pretty
 

14791
03:58:49,199 --> 03:58:51,110
true because I don't think it was pretty
I don't think it was clear enough I

14792
03:58:51,110 --> 03:58:51,120
I don't think it was clear enough I
 

14793
03:58:51,120 --> 03:58:52,429
I don't think it was clear enough I
don't think it actually was I think you

14794
03:58:52,429 --> 03:58:52,439
don't think it actually was I think you
 

14795
03:58:52,439 --> 03:58:54,410
don't think it actually was I think you
did that mistake

14796
03:58:54,410 --> 03:58:54,420
did that mistake
 

14797
03:58:54,420 --> 03:58:55,849
did that mistake
um but I think back then I was even

14798
03:58:55,849 --> 03:58:55,859
um but I think back then I was even
 

14799
03:58:55,859 --> 03:58:57,110
um but I think back then I was even
saying like hey you should probably not

04:07:16,849 --> 04:07:16,859
actually not that popular at all and uh
 

15327
04:07:16,859 --> 04:07:18,650
actually not that popular at all and uh
that's kind of sad I think yeah of

15328
04:07:18,650 --> 04:07:18,660
that's kind of sad I think yeah of
 

15329
04:07:18,660 --> 04:07:20,510
that's kind of sad I think yeah of
course there's now bigger mechanisms and

15330
04:07:20,510 --> 04:07:20,520
course there's now bigger mechanisms and
 

15331
04:07:20,520 --> 04:07:24,830
course there's now bigger mechanisms and
platforms to spread stuff music so as

15332
04:07:24,830 --> 04:07:24,840
platforms to spread stuff music so as
 

15333
04:07:24,840 --> 04:07:26,210
platforms to spread stuff music so as
long as you could be content with not

15334
04:07:26,210 --> 04:07:26,220
long as you could be content with not
 

15335
04:07:26,220 --> 04:07:28,010
long as you could be content with not
being popular I think you can still

15336
04:07:28,010 --> 04:07:28,020
being popular I think you can still
 

15337
04:07:28,020 --> 04:07:30,110
being popular I think you can still
create yeah but not like when people get

15338
04:07:30,110 --> 04:07:30,120
create yeah but not like when people get
 

15339
04:07:30,120 --> 04:07:31,309
create yeah but not like when people get
a little popular they get addicted to

15340
04:07:31,309 --> 04:07:31,319
a little popular they get addicted to
 

15341
04:07:31,319 --> 04:07:34,250
a little popular they get addicted to
that so fast yeah it's weird yeah you

15342
04:07:34,250 --> 04:07:34,260
that so fast yeah it's weird yeah you
 

15343
04:07:34,260 --> 04:07:36,469
that so fast yeah it's weird yeah you
have been somewhat good at least from my

15344
04:07:36,469 --> 04:07:36,479
have been somewhat good at least from my
 

15345
04:07:36,479 --> 04:07:38,450
have been somewhat good at least from my
outside of perspective because I think

15346
04:07:38,450 --> 04:07:38,460
outside of perspective because I think
 

15347
04:07:38,460 --> 04:07:41,510
outside of perspective because I think
you I can at least imagine you making

15348
04:07:41,510 --> 04:07:41,520
you I can at least imagine you making
 

15349
04:07:41,520 --> 04:07:43,130
you I can at least imagine you making
choices that could make you more popular

15350
04:07:43,130 --> 04:07:43,140
choices that could make you more popular
 

15351
04:07:43,140 --> 04:07:46,809
choices that could make you more popular
and you don't seem to make those choices

15352
04:07:46,809 --> 04:07:46,819
and you don't seem to make those choices
 

15353
04:07:46,819 --> 04:07:48,910
and you don't seem to make those choices
sabotage

15354
04:07:48,910 --> 04:07:48,920
sabotage
 

15355
04:07:48,920 --> 04:07:51,229
sabotage
but it is very intentional like you said

15356
04:07:51,229 --> 04:07:51,239
but it is very intentional like you said
 

15357

but it is very intentional like you said
like and I made that choice at every

like and I made that choice at every
 

15359
04:07:52,800 --> 04:07:55,130
like and I made that choice at every
single stage of My Life One is because

15360
04:07:55,130 --> 04:07:55,140
single stage of My Life One is because
 

15361
04:07:55,140 --> 04:07:56,689
single stage of My Life One is because
from the perspective of being a carpet

15362
04:07:56,689 --> 04:07:56,699
from the perspective of being a carpet
 

15363
04:07:56,699 --> 04:07:58,490

effect factor factor is a really good

15410
04:08:40,250 --> 04:08:40,260
effect factor factor is a really good
 

15411
04:08:40,260 --> 04:08:41,750
effect factor factor is a really good
game that's like not a fair comparison

15412
04:08:41,750 --> 04:08:41,760
game that's like not a fair comparison
 

15413
04:08:41,760 --> 04:08:42,769
game that's like not a fair comparison
okay you're talking about one of the

15414
04:08:42,769 --> 04:08:42,779
okay you're talking about one of the
 

15415
04:08:42,779 --> 04:08:44,990
okay you're talking about one of the
best cleanest games best support ever

15416
04:08:44,990 --> 04:08:45,000
best cleanest games best support ever
 

15417
04:08:45,000 --> 04:08:47,630
best cleanest games best support ever
made cleanest code base like yeah this

15418
04:08:47,630 --> 04:08:47,640
made cleanest code base like yeah this
 

15419
04:08:47,640 --> 04:08:48,250
made cleanest code base like yeah this
is

15420
04:08:48,250 --> 04:08:48,260
is
 

15421
04:08:48,260 --> 04:08:51,950
is
yeah it's more factorial time for me

15422
04:08:51,950 --> 04:08:51,960
yeah it's more factorial time for me
 

15423
04:08:51,960 --> 04:08:53,090
yeah it's more factorial time for me
starting to understand where the

15424
04:08:53,090 --> 04:08:53,100
starting to understand where the
 

15425
04:08:53,100 --> 04:08:54,769
starting to understand where the
massaging comes from by the way is is

15426
04:08:54,769 --> 04:08:54,779
massaging comes from by the way is is
 

15427
04:08:54,779 --> 04:08:57,050
massaging comes from by the way is is
the uh is Factor legit a really good

15428
04:08:57,050 --> 04:08:57,060
the uh is Factor legit a really good
 

15429
04:08:57,060 --> 04:08:59,090
the uh is Factor legit a really good
game yeah of course yeah if you're like

15430
04:08:59,090 --> 04:08:59,100
game yeah of course yeah if you're like
 

15431
04:08:59,100 --> 04:09:01,309
game yeah of course yeah if you're like
uh do you enjoy programming of course

15432
04:09:01,309 --> 04:09:01,319
uh do you enjoy programming of course
 

15433
04:09:01,319 --> 04:09:02,870
uh do you enjoy programming of course
that's all I do that's all that's okay

15434
04:09:02,870 --> 04:09:02,880
that's all I do that's all that's okay
 

15435
04:09:02,880 --> 04:09:05,570
that's all I do that's all that's okay
do you got like a programming is is the

15436
04:09:05,570 --> 04:09:05,580
do you got like a programming is is the
 

15437
04:09:05,580 --> 04:09:07,010
do you got like a programming is is the
game in itself that I enjoy probably

15438
04:09:07,010 --> 04:09:07,020
game in itself that I enjoy probably
 

15439
04:09:07,020 --> 04:09:08,570
game in itself that I enjoy probably
more than anything else but yeah it's

15440
04:09:08,570 --> 04:09:08,580
more than anything else but yeah it's
 

15441
04:09:08,580 --> 04:09:10,070
more than anything else but yeah it's
very much a game like that like if

15442
04:09:10,070 --> 04:09:10,080
very much a game like that like if
 

15443
04:09:10,080 --> 04:09:11,330
very much a game like that like if
you're into stuff like that like you can

15444
04:09:11,330 --> 04:09:11,340
you're into stuff like that like you can
 

15445
04:09:11,340 --> 04:09:13,130
you're into stuff like that like you can
lose hundreds of hours like very quickly

15446
04:09:13,130 --> 04:09:13,140
lose hundreds of hours like very quickly
 

15447
04:09:13,140 --> 04:09:15,410
lose hundreds of hours like very quickly
to like you have a problem and then you

15448
04:09:15,410 --> 04:09:15,420
to like you have a problem and then you
 

15449
04:09:15,420 --> 04:09:16,910
to like you have a problem and then you
think of a solution and then you iterate

15450
04:09:16,910 --> 04:09:16,920
think of a solution and then you iterate
 

15451
04:09:16,920 --> 04:09:18,349
think of a solution and then you iterate
on that over and over and over again in

15452
04:09:18,349 --> 04:09:18,359
on that over and over and over again in
 

15453
04:09:18,359 --> 04:09:19,790
on that over and over and over again in
larger larger schemes sometimes you got

15454
04:09:19,790 --> 04:09:19,800
larger larger schemes sometimes you got
 

15455
04:09:19,800 --> 04:09:21,050
larger larger schemes sometimes you got
to redesign stuff sometimes you get like

15456
04:09:21,050 --> 04:09:21,060
to redesign stuff sometimes you get like
 

15457
04:09:21,060 --> 04:09:22,130
to redesign stuff sometimes you get like
it's very much like that kind of game

15458
04:09:22,130 --> 04:09:22,140
it's very much like that kind of game
 

15459
04:09:22,140 --> 04:09:23,450
it's very much like that kind of game
this is essentially building a factory

15460
04:09:23,450 --> 04:09:23,460
this is essentially building a factory
 

15461
04:09:23,460 --> 04:09:25,189
this is essentially building a factory
like what on a foreign planet or

15462
04:09:25,189 --> 04:09:25,199
like what on a foreign planet or
 

15463
04:09:25,199 --> 04:09:26,689
like what on a foreign planet or
something like that it's basically it's

15464
04:09:26,689 --> 04:09:26,699
something like that it's basically it's
 

15465
04:09:26,699 --> 04:09:27,650
something like that it's basically it's
like a bunch of you're trying to

15466
04:09:27,650 --> 04:09:27,660
like a bunch of you're trying to
 

15467
04:09:27,660 --> 04:09:29,330
like a bunch of you're trying to
automate different problems so that you

15468
04:09:29,330 --> 04:09:29,340
automate different problems so that you
 

15469
04:09:29,340 --> 04:09:30,710
automate different problems so that you
can build bigger things so that you can

15470
04:09:30,710 --> 04:09:30,720
can build bigger things so that you can
 

15471
04:09:30,720 --> 04:09:32,030
can build bigger things so that you can
automate bigger problems so you can

15472
04:09:32,030 --> 04:09:32,040
automate bigger problems so you can
 

15473
04:09:32,040 --> 04:09:33,229
automate bigger problems so you can
build bigger things and automate bigger

15474
04:09:33,229 --> 04:09:33,239
build bigger things and automate bigger
 

15475
04:09:33,239 --> 04:09:34,790
build bigger things and automate bigger
problems so it's more complicated than

15476
04:09:34,790 --> 04:09:34,800
problems so it's more complicated than
 

15477
04:09:34,800 --> 04:09:37,010
problems so it's more complicated than
like a city building game like some City

15478
04:09:37,010 --> 04:09:37,020
like a city building game like some City
 

15479
04:09:37,020 --> 04:09:39,110
like a city building game like some City
type of thing I wouldn't say it's more

15480
04:09:39,110 --> 04:09:39,120
type of thing I wouldn't say it's more
 

15481
04:09:39,120 --> 04:09:41,030
type of thing I wouldn't say it's more
complicated it's more like it's like

15482
04:09:41,030 --> 04:09:41,040
complicated it's more like it's like
 

15483
04:09:41,040 --> 04:09:42,769
complicated it's more like it's like
factorial is like a game of like logic

15484
04:09:42,769 --> 04:09:42,779
factorial is like a game of like logic
 

15485
04:09:42,779 --> 04:09:45,050
factorial is like a game of like logic
like strictly like logic like it's

15486
04:09:45,050 --> 04:09:45,060
like strictly like logic like it's
 

15487
04:09:45,060 --> 04:09:46,670
like strictly like logic like it's
almost like you're building a circuit or

15488
04:09:46,670 --> 04:09:46,680
almost like you're building a circuit or
 

15489
04:09:46,680 --> 04:09:48,050
almost like you're building a circuit or
something yes yeah there's like their

15490
04:09:48,050 --> 04:09:48,060
something yes yeah there's like their
 

15491
04:09:48,060 --> 04:09:49,550
something yes yeah there's like their
circuitry and you've got your an orgs or

15492
04:09:49,550 --> 04:09:49,560
circuitry and you've got your an orgs or
 

15493
04:09:49,560 --> 04:09:50,750
circuitry and you've got your an orgs or
Gates you like there's stuff like that

15494
04:09:50,750 --> 04:09:50,760
Gates you like there's stuff like that
 

15495
04:09:50,760 --> 04:09:52,370
Gates you like there's stuff like that
it's very much like that like the

15496
04:09:52,370 --> 04:09:52,380
it's very much like that like the
 

15497
04:09:52,380 --> 04:09:54,290
it's very much like that like the
enemies in the game like what um they're

15498
04:09:54,290 --> 04:09:54,300
enemies in the game like what um they're
 

15499
04:09:54,300 --> 04:09:56,750
enemies in the game like what um they're
like try to bite you and you can get

15500
04:09:56,750 --> 04:09:56,760
like try to bite you and you can get
 

15501
04:09:56,760 --> 04:09:58,130
like try to bite you and you can get
guns and shoot and kill them but as I

15502
04:09:58,130 --> 04:09:58,140
guns and shoot and kill them but as I
 

15503
04:09:58,140 --> 04:09:59,750
guns and shoot and kill them but as I
saw there's like shooting going on yeah

15504
04:09:59,750 --> 04:09:59,760
saw there's like shooting going on yeah
 

15505
04:09:59,760 --> 04:10:00,950
saw there's like shooting going on yeah
but that's like a mine it's just another

15506
04:10:00,950 --> 04:10:00,960
but that's like a mine it's just another
 

15507
04:10:00,960 --> 04:10:02,269
but that's like a mine it's just another
problem to solve in the game basically

15508
04:10:02,269 --> 04:10:02,279
problem to solve in the game basically
 

15509
04:10:02,279 --> 04:10:04,610
problem to solve in the game basically
yeah okay all right so you see what we

do there we just started talking about
 

15513
04:10:05,760 --> 04:10:08,210
do there we just started talking about
the game as we're trying oh my God

15514
04:10:08,210 --> 04:10:08,220
the game as we're trying oh my God

horrible anyway is there is that

15518
04:10:12,349 --> 04:10:12,359
horrible anyway is there is that
