summer vision project to be given
 

187
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,589
summer vision project to be given
as far as we know to 10 students to work

as far as we know to 10 students to work
on and solve that summer

so that proposal outlined many of the

why do you think we underestimate and

198
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:38,959
why do you think we underestimate and
 

199
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,430
why do you think we underestimate and
perhaps we did underestimate and perhaps

00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:41,440
perhaps we did underestimate and perhaps
 

201
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,030
perhaps we did underestimate and perhaps
still underestimate

202
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,040
still underestimate
 

203
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,789
still underestimate
how hard computer vision is because

204
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:46,799
how hard computer vision is because
 

205
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,710
how hard computer vision is because
most of what we do in vision we do

206
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:48,720
most of what we do in vision we do
 

207
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,869
most of what we do in vision we do
unconsciously or subconsciously

00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,670
unconsciously or subconsciously
in human vision in human vision so that

gives us

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,869
gives us
this that effortlessness gives us the

00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:56,879
this that effortlessness gives us the
 

215
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:57,830
this that effortlessness gives us the
sense that oh

sense that oh

this must be very easy to implement on a

now this is why
the early researchers in ai got it so

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,910
the early researchers in ai got it so
wrong

00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:09,920
wrong
 

227
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,270

however if you go into neuroscience or

of human vision then the complexity
 

233
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,949
of human vision then the complexity
becomes very clear

234
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:18,959
becomes very clear
 

235
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,110
becomes very clear
the fact is that a very large part of

00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,120
the fact is that a very large part of

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,390
the fact is that a very large part of

the
 

239
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,710
the

the cerebral cortex is devoted to visual
 

241
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,830
the cerebral cortex is devoted to visual

i mean and this is true in other
 

245
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,350

so once we looked at it from a

00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:32,400
so once we looked at it from a
 

249
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,550
so once we looked at it from a
neuroscience or psychology perspective

250
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:34,560
neuroscience or psychology perspective
 

251
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,469
neuroscience or psychology perspective
it it becomes quite clear that the

252
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:36,479
it it becomes quite clear that the
 

253
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,230
it it becomes quite clear that the
problem is very challenging and it will

254
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:38,240
problem is very challenging and it will
 

255
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,510
problem is very challenging and it will
take some time

256
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:39,520
take some time
 

257
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,230
take some time
you said the higher level parts are the

258
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:42,240
you said the higher level parts are the
 

259
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,830
you said the higher level parts are the
harder parts

260
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:43,840
harder parts
 

261
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,590
harder parts
i think vision appears to to be easy

262
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:47,600
i think vision appears to to be easy
 

263
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,469
i think vision appears to to be easy
because

264
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:48,479
because
 

265
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,670
because
uh most of what visual processing

266
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:51,680
uh most of what visual processing
 

267
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,510
uh most of what visual processing
is subconscious or unconscious right

268
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:55,520
is subconscious or unconscious right
 

269
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,150
is subconscious or unconscious right
so we underestimate the difficulty

270
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:58,160
so we underestimate the difficulty
 

271
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,790
so we underestimate the difficulty
whereas

272
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:58,800
whereas
 

273
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,070
whereas
uh when you are

274
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,080

 

275
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,150

like proving a mathematical theorem or

276
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,160
like proving a mathematical theorem or
 

277
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,590
like proving a mathematical theorem or
playing chess

279
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,710

the difficulty is much more evident so

280
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:08,720
the difficulty is much more evident so
 

281
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,790
the difficulty is much more evident so
because it is your conscious brain which

282
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:10,800
because it is your conscious brain which
 

283
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,710
because it is your conscious brain which

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,110

that's true but it seems strange that

again makes the mistake of um

308
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:40,160
again makes the mistake of um
 

309
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,909
again makes the mistake of um
thinking the problem is easier than it

310
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:41,919
thinking the problem is easier than it
 

311
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,670
thinking the problem is easier than it
is or maybe it's not a mistake

312
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:43,680
is or maybe it's not a mistake
 

313
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,270
is or maybe it's not a mistake
we'll talk a little bit about autonomous

314
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:45,280
we'll talk a little bit about autonomous
 

315
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,510
we'll talk a little bit about autonomous
driving for example how hard of a vision

task that is
 

319
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,749
task that is
it do do you think i mean what

320
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:53,759
it do do you think i mean what
 

321
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,270
it do do you think i mean what
is it just human nature or is there

322
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:55,280
is it just human nature or is there
 

323
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,110
is it just human nature or is there
something fundamental to the vision

324
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,120
something fundamental to the vision
 

325
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,790
something fundamental to the vision
problem that we we underestimate

326
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:00,800
problem that we we underestimate
 

327
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,590
problem that we we underestimate
we're still not able to be cognizant of

328
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:03,600
we're still not able to be cognizant of
 

329
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,670
we're still not able to be cognizant of

how hard the problem is
 

331
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,710
how hard the problem is
yeah i think in the early days it could

332
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:08,720
yeah i think in the early days it could
 

333
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,629
yeah i think in the early days it could
have been excused because

334
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:10,639
have been excused because
 

335
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,950
have been excused because
in the early days all aspects of ai were

00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:12,960
in the early days all aspects of ai were
 

337
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,270
in the early days all aspects of ai were
regarded as too easy

338

regarded as too easy
 

339
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,990
regarded as too easy
but i think today it is much less

340
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,000
but i think today it is much less
 

341
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,430

343
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,469

and i think why people

344
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:22,479
and i think why people
 

345
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,909
and i think why people
fall for this is because of what i call

still an open problem
 

393
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,469
still an open problem
but in your sense how much understanding

but in your sense how much understanding
 

395
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,670

something called common sense reasoning
 

401
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,070
something called common sense reasoning
is

402
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:34,080
is
 

403
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,189
is
required to really be able to interpret

even static scenes yeah so vision

406
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:40,400
even static scenes yeah so vision
 

407
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,270
even static scenes yeah so vision
operates at

408
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,280
operates at
 

409
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,710
operates at
uh at all levels and there are parts

410
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:44,720
uh at all levels and there are parts
 

411
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,909
uh at all levels and there are parts
which are

412
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:45,919
which are
 

413
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,230
which are
which can be solved with what we could

414
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:48,240
which can be solved with what we could
 

415
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,629
which can be solved with what we could
call maybe peripheral processing

416
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:50,639
call maybe peripheral processing
 

417
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,510
call maybe peripheral processing
so in the in the human vision literature

418
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:53,520
so in the in the human vision literature
 

419
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,110
so in the in the human vision literature
there used to be these terms

420
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,120
there used to be these terms
 

421
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,710
there used to be these terms
sensation perception and cognition

422
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:58,720
sensation perception and cognition
 

423
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,749
sensation perception and cognition
which roughly speaking referred to like

424
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:01,759
which roughly speaking referred to like
 

425
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,990
which roughly speaking referred to like
the front end of processing

426
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:04,000
the front end of processing
 

427
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,070
the front end of processing
middle stages of processing and higher

428
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,080
middle stages of processing and higher
 

429
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,830
middle stages of processing and higher

00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:07,840
level of processing
 

431
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,710
level of processing
and i think they made a big deal out of

432
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:10,720
and i think they made a big deal out of
 

433
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,390
and i think they made a big deal out of
out of this and they wanted to just

00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:12,400
out of this and they wanted to just
 

435
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,550
out of this and they wanted to just
study only perception and then

436
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:14,560
study only perception and then
 

437
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,189
study only perception and then
dismiss certain certain problems as

438
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:17,199
dismiss certain certain problems as

being quote cognitive
 

441
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,589
being quote cognitive
but really i think these are artificial

442
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:21,599
but really i think these are artificial
 

443
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,029
but really i think these are artificial
divides

the problem is continuous at all level

446
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,080
the problem is continuous at all level
 

447
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,390
the problem is continuous at all level
and there are challenges at all levels

448
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:28,400
and there are challenges at all levels
 

449
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,950
and there are challenges at all levels
the techniques that we have today

450
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:30,960
the techniques that we have today
 

451
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,110
the techniques that we have today
they work better at the lower and mid

452
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:33,120
they work better at the lower and mid
 

453
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,870
they work better at the lower and mid

454
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:34,880
levels of the problem
 

455
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,870
levels of the problem
i think the higher levels of the problem

456
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:36,880
i think the higher levels of the problem
 

457
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,829
i think the higher levels of the problem
quote the cognitive levels of the

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,029
problem
are there and we

462
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:43,039
are there and we
 

463
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,030
are there and we
in many real applications we have to

464
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,040
in many real applications we have to
 

465
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,310
in many real applications we have to
confront them

466
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:46,320
confront them
 

467
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,829
confront them
now how much that is necessary will

468
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:49,839
now how much that is necessary will
 

469
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,269
now how much that is necessary will
depend on the application

470
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:51,279
depend on the application
 

471
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,030
depend on the application
for some problems it doesn't matter for

472
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,040
for some problems it doesn't matter for
 

473
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,110
for some problems it doesn't matter for
some problems it matters a lot

474
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:55,120
some problems it matters a lot
 

475
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,949
some problems it matters a lot
so i am for example

476
00:08:58,949 --> 00:08:58,959
so i am for example
 

477
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,550
so i am for example
a pessimist on fully autonomous driving

478
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:02,560
a pessimist on fully autonomous driving
 

479
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,630
a pessimist on fully autonomous driving
in the near future

480
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:04,640
in the near future
 

481
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,710
in the near future
and the reason is because i think there

482
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:06,720
and the reason is because i think there
 

483
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,829
and the reason is because i think there
will be

484
00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:07,839
will be
 

485
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,829
will be
that 0.01 percent of the cases

486
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:11,839
that 0.01 percent of the cases
 

487
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,389
that 0.01 percent of the cases
where quite sophisticated cognitive

488
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:14,399
where quite sophisticated cognitive
 

489
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,389

00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:20,160
however there are tasks where you can
 

493
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,030
however there are tasks where you can
first of all they are much more they are

00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,040
first of all they are much more they are
 

495
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,710
first of all they are much more they are
robust so in the sense that

496
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:24,720
robust so in the sense that
 

497
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,190
robust so in the sense that
error rates error is not so much of a

501
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,269

00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:31,279
for example uh uh let's say we are

you're doing uh
image search you're trying to get images

right i mean when google image search

516
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:45,519
right i mean when google image search
 

517
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,670
right i mean when google image search

there's not a matter of life and death
 

527
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,509
there's not a matter of life and death

00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:55,519
but
 

529
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,710
but
making mistakes when you're

let's go there briefly
about autonomous vehicles so one of the

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,069
musk are working on
a system called autopilot which is

550
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:22,079
a system called autopilot which is
 

551
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,990
a system called autopilot which is
primarily a vision-based system with

552
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,000
primarily a vision-based system with
 

553
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,509
primarily a vision-based system with
eight cameras

554
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:25,519
eight cameras
 

555
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,750
eight cameras
and uh basically a single neural network

556
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:27,760
and uh basically a single neural network
 

557
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,990
and uh basically a single neural network
a multi-task neural network

558
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,000
a multi-task neural network
 

559
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,870
a multi-task neural network
they they call it hydro net multiple

560
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:32,880
they they call it hydro net multiple

so it does multiple tasks but is forming
 

565
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,790
so it does multiple tasks but is forming
the same representation

566
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:36,800
the same representation
 

567
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,069
the same representation
at the core do you think driving can be

568
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:40,079
at the core do you think driving can be
 

569
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,190
at the core do you think driving can be
converted

570
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:41,200
converted
 

571
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,389
converted
in this way to uh purely a vision

572
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:44,399
in this way to uh purely a vision
 

573
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:44,870
in this way to uh purely a vision

00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:44,880
problem
 

575
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,110
problem
and then solved within you with learning

576
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:49,120
and then solved within you with learning
 

577
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,750
and then solved within you with learning
or even more specifically in the current

or even more specifically in the current
 

579
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,470
or even more specifically in the current
approach

580
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:52,480
approach
 

581
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,470
approach
what do you think about what tesla

582
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:54,480
what do you think about what tesla
 

583
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,949
what do you think about what tesla
autopilot team is doing

584
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:56,959
autopilot team is doing
 

585
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,350
autopilot team is doing
so the way i think about it is that

586
00:10:59,350 --> 00:10:59,360
so the way i think about it is that
 

587
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,389
so the way i think about it is that
there are certainly

588
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:00,399
there are certainly
 

589
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,790
there are certainly
subset subsets of the visual based

590
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:02,800
subset subsets of the visual based
 

591
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,269
subset subsets of the visual based
driving problem which are quite solvable

592
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:05,279
driving problem which are quite solvable
 

593
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,190
driving problem which are quite solvable
so for example driving in freeway

594
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:07,200
so for example driving in freeway
 

595
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,030
so for example driving in freeway
conditions

596
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,040
conditions
 

597
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,269
conditions
is quite a solvable problem i think

598
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:13,279
is quite a solvable problem i think
 

599
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,949
is quite a solvable problem i think
there were demonstrations of that going

600
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:14,959
there were demonstrations of that going
 

601
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,990
there were demonstrations of that going
back to the 1980s by

602
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,000
back to the 1980s by

someone called ernst stickmans in munich
 

605
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,630
someone called ernst stickmans in munich
in the 90s there were approaches from

606
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:24,640
in the 90s there were approaches from
 

607
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,389
in the 90s there were approaches from
carnegie mellon there were approaches

608
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:26,399
carnegie mellon there were approaches
 

609
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:26,790
carnegie mellon there were approaches
from

610
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:26,800
from
 

611
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,670
from
our team at berkeley in the 2000s there

612
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:29,680
our team at berkeley in the 2000s there
 

613
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,910
our team at berkeley in the 2000s there
were approaches from stanford

614
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:31,920
were approaches from stanford
 

615
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,990
were approaches from stanford
and so on so autonomous driving in

616
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:36,000
and so on so autonomous driving in
 

617
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,389
and so on so autonomous driving in
certain settings is very doable

618
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:38,399
certain settings is very doable
 

619
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,670
certain settings is very doable
the challenge is to have an autopilot

620
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:41,680
the challenge is to have an autopilot
 

621
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:41,990
the challenge is to have an autopilot
work

622
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:42,000
work
 

623
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,269
work
under all kinds of driving conditions

624
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:45,279
under all kinds of driving conditions
 

625
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,949
under all kinds of driving conditions
at that point it's not just a question

626
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:46,959
at that point it's not just a question
 

627
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,470
at that point it's not just a question
of vision

628
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:48,480
of vision
 

629
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,350
of vision
or perception but really also of control

630
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:51,360
or perception but really also of control
 

631
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,990
or perception but really also of control
and dealing with all the edge cases

632
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,000
and dealing with all the edge cases
 

633
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,590
and dealing with all the edge cases
so where do you think most of the

634
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:55,600
so where do you think most of the
 

635
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,509
so where do you think most of the
difficult cases

636
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:57,519
difficult cases
 

637
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,269
difficult cases
to me even the highway driving is an

638
00:11:59,269 --> 00:11:59,279
to me even the highway driving is an
 

639
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,949
to me even the highway driving is an
open problem because

640
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:00,959
open problem because
 

641
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:06,230
open problem because
uh it applies the same 50 90 95 99 rule

642
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:06,240
uh it applies the same 50 90 95 99 rule
 

643
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,550
uh it applies the same 50 90 95 99 rule
or the first step the fallacy of the

644
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:08,560
or the first step the fallacy of the
 

645
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,990
or the first step the fallacy of the
first step i forget how you put

646
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,000
first step i forget how you put
 

647
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,550
first step i forget how you put
it we fall victim to i think even

648
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:12,560
it we fall victim to i think even
 

649
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,710
it we fall victim to i think even
highway driving has a lot of elements

650
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:14,720
highway driving has a lot of elements
 

651
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,110
highway driving has a lot of elements
because to solve autonomous driving you

652
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:17,120
because to solve autonomous driving you
 

653
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,190
because to solve autonomous driving you
have to completely relinquish

654
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:19,200
have to completely relinquish
 

655
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,629
have to completely relinquish
the the fat help of a human being

656
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:22,639
the the fat help of a human being
 

657
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,230
the the fat help of a human being
you're always in control so that you're

658
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:24,240
you're always in control so that you're
 

659
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,389
you're always in control so that you're
really going to feel the edge cases

660
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:26,399
really going to feel the edge cases
 

661
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,389
really going to feel the edge cases
so i i think even highway driving is

662
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:28,399
so i i think even highway driving is
 

663
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,590
so i i think even highway driving is
really difficult but

664
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:29,600
really difficult but
 

665
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,230
really difficult but
in terms of the general driving task do

666
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:32,240
in terms of the general driving task do
 

667
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:32,949
in terms of the general driving task do
you think

668
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:32,959
you think
 

669
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,910
you think
vision is the fundamental problem or is

670
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:35,920
vision is the fundamental problem or is
 

671
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,269
vision is the fundamental problem or is
it

672
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:37,279
it
 

673
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,629
it
also your action the the interaction

674
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:40,639
also your action the the interaction
 

675
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,710
also your action the the interaction
with the environment

676
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:42,720
with the environment
 

677
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,350
with the environment
the ability to uh and then like the

678
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:45,360
the ability to uh and then like the
 

679
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,790
the ability to uh and then like the
middle ground i don't know if you put

680
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:46,800
middle ground i don't know if you put
 

681
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,389
middle ground i don't know if you put
that under vision which is

682
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:48,399
that under vision which is
 

683
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,190
that under vision which is
trying to predict the behavior of others

684
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:51,200
trying to predict the behavior of others
 

685
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,470
trying to predict the behavior of others
which is a little bit

686
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:52,480
which is a little bit
 

687
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,590
which is a little bit
in the world of understanding the scene

688
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:55,600
in the world of understanding the scene
 

689
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,310
in the world of understanding the scene
but it's also trying to form a model of

690
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:58,320
but it's also trying to form a model of
 

691
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,910
but it's also trying to form a model of
the actors in the scene

692
00:12:59,910 --> 00:12:59,920
the actors in the scene
 

693
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,629
the actors in the scene
and predict their behavior yeah i

694
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:02,639
and predict their behavior yeah i
 

695
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,230
and predict their behavior yeah i
include that in vision because

696
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:04,240
include that in vision because
 

697
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,030
include that in vision because
to me perception blends into cognition

698
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:07,040
to me perception blends into cognition
 

699
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,430
to me perception blends into cognition
and building predictive models of other

700
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:09,440
and building predictive models of other
 

701
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,190
and building predictive models of other
agents in the world

702
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:11,200
agents in the world
 

703
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,790
agents in the world
which could be other agents could be

704
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:12,800
which could be other agents could be
 

705
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,269
which could be other agents could be
people other agents could be other cars

706
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:15,279
people other agents could be other cars
 

707
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,230
people other agents could be other cars
that is part of the task of perception

708
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:18,240
that is part of the task of perception
 

709
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:18,870
that is part of the task of perception
because

710
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:18,880
because
 

711
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,389
because
perception always has to uh not tell us

712
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:22,399
perception always has to uh not tell us
 

713
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,790
perception always has to uh not tell us
what is now but what will happen

714
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:24,800
what is now but what will happen
 

715
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,790
what is now but what will happen
because what's now is boring it's done

716
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:26,800
because what's now is boring it's done
 

717
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,550
because what's now is boring it's done
it's over with

718
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:28,560
it's over with
 

719
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,110
it's over with
okay yeah we care about the future

720
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:31,120
okay yeah we care about the future
 

721
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,829
okay yeah we care about the future
because we

722
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:31,839
because we
 

723
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,310
because we
act in the future and we care about the

724
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:34,320
act in the future and we care about the
 

725
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:34,870
act in the future and we care about the
past

726
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:34,880
past
 

727
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,790
past
and as much as it informs what's going

728
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:36,800
and as much as it informs what's going
 

729
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,790
and as much as it informs what's going
to happen in the future

730
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:38,800
to happen in the future
 

731
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,470
to happen in the future
so i think we have to build predictive

732
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:40,480
so i think we have to build predictive
 

733
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,550
so i think we have to build predictive
models of of

734
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:42,560
models of of
 

735
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,350
models of of
of behaviors of people and and those can

736
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:45,360
of behaviors of people and and those can
 

737
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,829
of behaviors of people and and those can
get quite

738
00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:46,839
get quite
 

739
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,829
get quite
complicated so uh uh

740
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:49,839
complicated so uh uh
 

741
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,269
complicated so uh uh
i mean uh i i've seen examples of this

742
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:53,279
i mean uh i i've seen examples of this
 

743
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:53,590
i mean uh i i've seen examples of this
in

744
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:53,600
in
 

745
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,670
in
uh actually i mean i own a tesla

746
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:57,680
uh actually i mean i own a tesla
 

747
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,550
uh actually i mean i own a tesla
and it has various safety features built

748
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:00,560
and it has various safety features built
 

749
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,350
and it has various safety features built
in

750
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:01,360
in
 

751
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,870
in
and uh what i see are these examples

752
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:04,880
and uh what i see are these examples
 

753
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,590
and uh what i see are these examples
where

754
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:05,600
where
 

755
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,550
where
let's say there is some uh skateboarder

756
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:08,560
let's say there is some uh skateboarder
 

757
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,030
let's say there is some uh skateboarder
i mean

758
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,040
i mean
 

759
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,189
i mean
this i and i i don't want to be too

760
00:14:11,189 --> 00:14:11,199
this i and i i don't want to be too
 

761
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,550
this i and i i don't want to be too
critical because

762
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:12,560
critical because
 

763
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,949
critical because
obviously this is these are the systems

764
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:14,959
obviously this is these are the systems
 

765
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,150
obviously this is these are the systems
are always being improved

766
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:16,160
are always being improved
 

767
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,269
are always being improved
and any specific criticism i have

768
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:19,279
and any specific criticism i have
 

769
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,350
and any specific criticism i have
maybe the system six months from now

770
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:21,360
maybe the system six months from now
 

771
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,550
maybe the system six months from now
will not have that

772
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:22,560
will not have that
 

773
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,590
will not have that
that that particular failure mode

774
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:25,600
that that particular failure mode
 

775
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,710
that that particular failure mode
so uh it

776
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:28,720
so uh it
 

777
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,990
so uh it
it had it it had the wrong response and

778
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:32,000
it had it it had the wrong response and
 

779
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,910
it had it it had the wrong response and
it's because it couldn't predict

780
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:33,920
it's because it couldn't predict
 

781
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,189
it's because it couldn't predict
what what this skateboarder was going to

782
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:37,199
what what this skateboarder was going to
 

783
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,150
what what this skateboarder was going to
do

784
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:38,160
do
 

785
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,750
do
okay and because it really required that

786
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:41,760
okay and because it really required that
 

787
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,990
okay and because it really required that
higher level cognitive understanding

788
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:44,000
higher level cognitive understanding
 

789
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,550
higher level cognitive understanding
of what skateboarders typically do as

790
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:46,560
of what skateboarders typically do as
 

791
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,470
of what skateboarders typically do as
opposed to a normal pedestrian

792
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:48,480
opposed to a normal pedestrian
 

793
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,910
opposed to a normal pedestrian
so what might have been the correct

794
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:49,920
so what might have been the correct
 

795
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,910
so what might have been the correct
behavior for a pedestrian

796
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:51,920
behavior for a pedestrian
 

797
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,829
behavior for a pedestrian
a typical behavior for pedestrian was

798
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:53,839
a typical behavior for pedestrian was
 

799
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,829
a typical behavior for pedestrian was
not the typical behavior for a

800
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:56,839
not the typical behavior for a
 

801
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,670
not the typical behavior for a
skateboarder right yeah

802
00:14:59,670 --> 00:14:59,680
skateboarder right yeah
 

803
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,030
skateboarder right yeah
and uh so so therefore

804
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:03,040
and uh so so therefore
 

805
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,870
and uh so so therefore
to do a good job there you need to have

806
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:04,880
to do a good job there you need to have
 

807
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,230
to do a good job there you need to have
enough data where

808
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:06,240
enough data where
 

809
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,150
enough data where
you have pedestrians you also have

810
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:08,160
you have pedestrians you also have
 

811
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,350
you have pedestrians you also have
skateboarders

812
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:09,360
skateboarders
 

813
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,590
skateboarders
you've seen enough skateboarders to see

814
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:11,600
you've seen enough skateboarders to see
 

815
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,470
you've seen enough skateboarders to see
what

816
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:12,480
what
 

817
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,269
what
uh what kinds of patterns or behavior

818
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:15,279
uh what kinds of patterns or behavior
 

819
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,310
uh what kinds of patterns or behavior
they have

820
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:16,320
they have
 

821
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,269
they have
so it is it is in principle with enough

822
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:19,279
so it is it is in principle with enough
 

823
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,350
so it is it is in principle with enough
data that problem could be solved

824
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:21,360
data that problem could be solved
 

825
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,269
data that problem could be solved
but uh i think our current

826
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:25,279
but uh i think our current
 

827
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,350
but uh i think our current
systems computer vision systems they

828
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:27,360
systems computer vision systems they
 

829
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,470
systems computer vision systems they
need far

830
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:28,480
need far
 

831
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,590
need far
far more data than humans do for

832
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:31,600
far more data than humans do for
 

833
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,310
far more data than humans do for
learning those

834
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:32,320
learning those
 

835
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,710
learning those
same capabilities so say that there is

836
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:34,720

what we have today
 

845
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,749

look similar
 

859
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,990
look similar
in that regard and we'll just have more

860
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:56,000
in that regard and we'll just have more
 

861
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,910
in that regard and we'll just have more

uh learning systems have been
 

877
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,470
uh learning systems have been
uh what we have found currently very

learning paradigm is
 

885
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,790
learning paradigm is
sort of tabula rasa learning and tabular

886
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:24,800
sort of tabula rasa learning and tabular
 

887
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,590
sort of tabula rasa learning and tabular
us are learning

888
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:25,600
us are learning
 

889
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,069
us are learning
in a supervised way with lots and lots

in a supervised way with lots and lots
 

891
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,069
in a supervised way with lots and lots
of what's going on

of what's going on
 

893
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,470

00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:32,480
in the sense that blank slate we just
 

895
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,870
in the sense that blank slate we just
have the system which is

00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:34,880
have the system which is
 

897
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,189
have the system which is
given a series of experiences in this

898
00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:37,199
given a series of experiences in this
 

899
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,749
given a series of experiences in this
setting and then it learns there

900
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:39,759
setting and then it learns there
 

901
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,470
setting and then it learns there
now if let's think about human driving

902
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:42,480
now if let's think about human driving
 

903
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,470
now if let's think about human driving
it is not tabular assad learning

904
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:44,480
it is not tabular assad learning
 

905
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,949
it is not tabular assad learning
so at the age of 16 in high school

906
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:48,959
so at the age of 16 in high school
 

907
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,069
so at the age of 16 in high school
uh a teenager goes into uh

908
00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:52,079
uh a teenager goes into uh
 

909
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,590
uh a teenager goes into uh
goes into driver ed class right and now

910
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:55,600
goes into driver ed class right and now
 

911
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,870
goes into driver ed class right and now
at that point they learn but at the age

912
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:58,880
at that point they learn but at the age
 

913
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,069
at that point they learn but at the age
of 16 they are already visual geniuses

914
00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:02,079
of 16 they are already visual geniuses
 

915
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,350
of 16 they are already visual geniuses
because from 0 to 16 they have built a

916
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:05,360
because from 0 to 16 they have built a
 

917
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,510
because from 0 to 16 they have built a
certain repertoire of vision

918
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:07,520
certain repertoire of vision
 

919
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,590
certain repertoire of vision
in fact most of it has probably been

920
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:09,600
in fact most of it has probably been
 

921
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,549
in fact most of it has probably been
achieved by

922
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:10,559
achieved by
 

923
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,789
achieved by
age 2 right in in this period of age

924
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:14,799
age 2 right in in this period of age
 

925
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,110
age 2 right in in this period of age
up to age 2 they know that the world is

926
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:17,120
up to age 2 they know that the world is
 

927
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,789
up to age 2 they know that the world is
three-dimensional they know how

928
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:18,799
three-dimensional they know how
 

929
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,029
three-dimensional they know how
objects look like from different

perspectives

932
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:22,160
perspectives
 

933
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,750
perspectives
they know about occlusion they

934
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:25,760
they know about occlusion they
 

935
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,470
they know about occlusion they
know about common dynamics of humans and

936
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:28,480
know about common dynamics of humans and
 

937
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,510
know about common dynamics of humans and
other bodies

938
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:29,520
other bodies
 

939
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,110
other bodies
they have some notion of intuitive

940
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:31,120
they have some notion of intuitive
 

941
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,870
they have some notion of intuitive
physics so they

942
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:32,880
physics so they
 

943
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,230
physics so they
they built that up from their

944
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:34,240
they built that up from their
 

945
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,430
they built that up from their
observations and interactions

946
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:37,440
observations and interactions
 

947
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,110
observations and interactions
in early childhood and of course

948
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:39,120
in early childhood and of course
 

949
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,029
in early childhood and of course
reinforced through

950
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:41,039
reinforced through
 

951
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,070
reinforced through
their their growing up to age 16. so

952
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:44,080
their their growing up to age 16. so
 

953
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,710
their their growing up to age 16. so
then

954
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:44,720
then
 

955
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,830
then
at age 16 when they go into driver ed

956
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:47,840
at age 16 when they go into driver ed
 

957
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,750
at age 16 when they go into driver ed
what are they learning they're not

958
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:49,760
what are they learning they're not
 

959
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,150

learning afresh the visual world
 

961
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,549
learning afresh the visual world
they have a mastery of the visual world

962
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:54,559
they have a mastery of the visual world
 

963
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:55,590
they have a mastery of the visual world
what they are learning

964
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:55,600
what they are learning
 

965
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,350
what they are learning
is control okay they are learning how to

00:17:59,350 --> 00:17:59,360
is control okay they are learning how to
 

967
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,150
is control okay they are learning how to
be smooth

968
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:00,160
be smooth

and so forth
 

973
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,990
and so forth
they're learning a sense of typical

974
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:06,000
they're learning a sense of typical
 

975
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,830
they're learning a sense of typical

now the the that education process

978
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:11,600
now the the that education process
 

979
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,950
now the the that education process
can be quite short because they are

980
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:14,960
can be quite short because they are
 

981
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,510
can be quite short because they are
coming in as visual geniuses

982
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:17,520
coming in as visual geniuses
 

983
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,390
coming in as visual geniuses
and of course in their future they're

984
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:20,400
and of course in their future they're
 

985
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,230
and of course in their future they're
going to encounter situations which are

986
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:22,240
going to encounter situations which are
 

987
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,590
going to encounter situations which are
very novel

988
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:23,600
very novel
 

989
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,110
very novel
right so during my driver ed class

990
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:27,120
right so during my driver ed class
 

991
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,630
right so during my driver ed class
that i may not have had to deal with a

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,789
junk gets dropped from the truck
and i have to deal with it right but i

1004
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:42,799
and i have to deal with it right but i
 

1005
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:43,830
and i have to deal with it right but i
can deal with this

1006
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:43,840
can deal with this
 

1007
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,070
can deal with this
as a driver even though i did not

1008
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:46,080
as a driver even though i did not
 

1009
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,830
as a driver even though i did not
encounter this in my driver at

1010
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:47,840
encounter this in my driver at
 

1011
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,990
encounter this in my driver at
class and the reason i can deal with it

1012
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:50,000
class and the reason i can deal with it
 

1013
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,430
class and the reason i can deal with it
is because i have all this

1014
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:51,440
is because i have all this
 

1015
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,549
is because i have all this
general visual knowledge and expertise

1016
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:54,559
general visual knowledge and expertise
 

1017
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,669
general visual knowledge and expertise
and uh do you think the learning

1018
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:57,679
and uh do you think the learning
 

1019
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,750
and uh do you think the learning
mechanisms we have today

1020
00:18:59,750 --> 00:18:59,760
mechanisms we have today
 

1021
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,669
mechanisms we have today
can do that kind of long-term

1022
00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:01,679
can do that kind of long-term
 

1023
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,590
can do that kind of long-term
accumulation of knowledge

1024
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:03,600
accumulation of knowledge
 

1025
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,430
accumulation of knowledge
or do we have to uh do some kind of

1026
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:07,440
or do we have to uh do some kind of
 

1027
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,590
or do we have to uh do some kind of
you know in the the the work that led up

1028
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:09,600
you know in the the the work that led up
 

1029
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,750
you know in the the the work that led up
to expert systems with knowledge

1030
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:11,760
to expert systems with knowledge
 

1031
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,870
to expert systems with knowledge
representation

1032
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:12,880
representation
 

1033
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,870
representation
you know the broader field of what of

1034
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:14,880
you know the broader field of what of
 

1035
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,630
you know the broader field of what of
artificial intelligence

1036
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:16,640
artificial intelligence
 

1037
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,870
artificial intelligence
uh worked on this kind of accumulation

1038
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:18,880
uh worked on this kind of accumulation
 

1039
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,990
uh worked on this kind of accumulation
of knowledge

1040
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:20,000
of knowledge
 

1041
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,270
of knowledge
do you think neural networks can do the

1042
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:21,280
do you think neural networks can do the
 

1043
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,150
do you think neural networks can do the
same i think uh

1044
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:24,160
same i think uh
 

1045
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,270
same i think uh
i don't see any in principle problem

1046
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:27,280
i don't see any in principle problem
 

1047
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,110
i don't see any in principle problem
with neural networks doing it

1048
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:29,120
with neural networks doing it
 

1049
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,950
with neural networks doing it
but i think the learning techniques

1050
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:30,960
but i think the learning techniques
 

1051
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,510
but i think the learning techniques
would need to evolve significantly

1052
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:33,520
would need to evolve significantly
 

1053
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,029
would need to evolve significantly
so the current uh the current

1054
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:37,039
so the current uh the current
 

1055
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,230
so the current uh the current
learning techniques that we have yeah is

1056
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:40,240
learning techniques that we have yeah is
 

1057
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,830
learning techniques that we have yeah is
our supervised learning you're given

1058
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:41,840
our supervised learning you're given
 

1059
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,270
our supervised learning you're given
lots of examples

1060
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:43,280
lots of examples
 

1061
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,150
lots of examples
xiy pairs and you you learn the

1062
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:46,160
xiy pairs and you you learn the
 

1063
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,470
xiy pairs and you you learn the
functional mapping between them

1064
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:48,480
functional mapping between them
 

1065
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,710
functional mapping between them
i think that human learning is far

1066
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:50,720
i think that human learning is far
 

1067
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,150
i think that human learning is far
richer than that

1068
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:52,160
richer than that
 

1069
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,549
richer than that
it includes many different components

1070
00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:54,559
it includes many different components
 

1071
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:55,350
it includes many different components
there are

1072
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:55,360
there are
 

1073
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,190
there are
there is a a child explores the world

1074
00:19:59,190 --> 00:19:59,200
there is a a child explores the world
 

1075
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,190
there is a a child explores the world
and sees as for example a child

1076
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:03,200
and sees as for example a child
 

1077
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,230
and sees as for example a child
takes an object and manipulates it

1078
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:06,240
takes an object and manipulates it
 

1079
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,990
takes an object and manipulates it
in his or her hand and therefore gets to

1080
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:10,000
in his or her hand and therefore gets to
 

1081
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,669
in his or her hand and therefore gets to
see the object from different points of

1082
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:11,679
see the object from different points of
 

1083
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:12,470
see the object from different points of
view

1084
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:12,480
view
 

1085
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,630
view
and the child has commanded the movement

1086
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:14,640
and the child has commanded the movement
 

1087
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,549
and the child has commanded the movement
so that's a kind of learning data but

1088
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:16,559
so that's a kind of learning data but
 

1089
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,630
so that's a kind of learning data but
the learning data has been

1090
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:18,640
the learning data has been
 

1091
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,590
the learning data has been
arranged by the child and this is a very

1092
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:21,600
arranged by the child and this is a very
 

1093
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,470
arranged by the child and this is a very
rich

1094
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:22,480
rich
 

1095
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,750
rich
kind of data the child can do various

1096
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:25,760
kind of data the child can do various
 

1097
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,310
kind of data the child can do various
experiments with the world so

1098
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:30,320

 

1099
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,789

so there are many aspects of sort of

1100
00:20:32,789 --> 00:20:32,799
so there are many aspects of sort of
 

1101
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,390
so there are many aspects of sort of
human learning and these have been

1102
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:34,400
human learning and these have been
 

1103
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,149
human learning and these have been
studied in

1104
00:20:36,149 --> 00:20:36,159
studied in
 

1105
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,270
studied in
in child development by psychologists

1106
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:39,280
in child development by psychologists
 

1107
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,230
in child development by psychologists
and they what they tell us is that

1108
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:42,240
and they what they tell us is that
 

1109
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,549
and they what they tell us is that
supervised learning is a very small part

1110
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:44,559
supervised learning is a very small part
 

1111
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:45,190
supervised learning is a very small part
of it

1112
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:45,200
of it
 

1113
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,270
of it
there are many different aspects of

1114
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:47,280
there are many different aspects of
 

1115
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,549
there are many different aspects of
learning

1116
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:48,559
learning
 

1117
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,110
learning
and what we would need to do is to

1118
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:51,120
and what we would need to do is to
 

1119
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,190
and what we would need to do is to
develop models of

1120
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:53,200
develop models of
 

1121
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,710
develop models of
all of these and then

1122
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:56,720
all of these and then
 

1123
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,750
all of these and then
train our systems in that with that kind

1124
00:20:59,750 --> 00:20:59,760
train our systems in that with that kind
 

1125
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,190
train our systems in that with that kind
of

1126
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:01,200
of
 

1127
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,669
of
uh protocol so new new methods of

yes some of which might imitate the
 

1133
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,029
yes some of which might imitate the
human brain but you also

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,549
in your talks have mentioned some of the
compute side of things

1138

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,350
interesting valuable to consider about
the difference

00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:36,480
per second yes so if we go back
 

1161
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,430
per second yes so if we go back
uh so so this is a point i've been

1162
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:39,440
uh so so this is a point i've been
 

1163
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,510
uh so so this is a point i've been
making for 20 years now

1164
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:41,520
making for 20 years now
 

1165
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,230
making for 20 years now
and i think once upon a time the way i

1166
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:44,240
and i think once upon a time the way i
 

1167
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:44,950
and i think once upon a time the way i
used to

1168
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:44,960
used to
 

1169
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,110
used to
argue this was that we just didn't have

1170
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:47,120
argue this was that we just didn't have
 

1171
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,950
argue this was that we just didn't have
the computing power of the human brain

1172
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:48,960
the computing power of the human brain
 

1173
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,070
the computing power of the human brain
our computers were uh were not

1174
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:52,080
our computers were uh were not
 

1175
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,149
our computers were uh were not
quite there and i mean there is a

1176
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:56,159
quite there and i mean there is a
 

1177
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,029
quite there and i mean there is a
well well-known trade-off which we know

1178
00:21:59,029 --> 00:21:59,039
well well-known trade-off which we know
 

1179
00:21:59,039 --> 00:21:59,830
well well-known trade-off which we know
that

1180
00:21:59,830 --> 00:21:59,840
that
 

1181
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,830
that
the that neurons are slow compared to

1182
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:03,840
the that neurons are slow compared to
 

1183
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,590
the that neurons are slow compared to
transistors but uh but we have a lot of

1184
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:07,600
transistors but uh but we have a lot of
 

1185
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,789
transistors but uh but we have a lot of
them and they have a very high

1186
00:22:08,789 --> 00:22:08,799
them and they have a very high
 

1187
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:09,909
them and they have a very high
connectivity

1188
00:22:09,909 --> 00:22:09,919
connectivity
 

1189
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,350
connectivity
whereas in silicon you have much faster

1190
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:13,360
whereas in silicon you have much faster
 

1191
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,510
whereas in silicon you have much faster
devices transistors switch at

1192
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:15,520
devices transistors switch at
 

1193
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,230
devices transistors switch at
on the order of nanoseconds but the

1194
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:18,240
on the order of nanoseconds but the
 

1195
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,230
on the order of nanoseconds but the
connectivity is usually smaller

1196
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:20,240
connectivity is usually smaller
 

1197
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,590
connectivity is usually smaller
right at this point in time i mean we

1198
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:23,600
right at this point in time i mean we
 

1199
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,669
right at this point in time i mean we
are now talking about

1200
00:22:24,669 --> 00:22:24,679
are now talking about
 

1201
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:27,750
are now talking about
2020 we do have if you consider the

1202
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:27,760
2020 we do have if you consider the
 

1203
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,750
2020 we do have if you consider the
latest gpus and so on

1204
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:29,760
latest gpus and so on
 

1205
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,950
latest gpus and so on
amazing computing power and if we look

1206
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:32,960
amazing computing power and if we look
 

1207
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,990
amazing computing power and if we look
back at enhanced modex type of

1208
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:36,000
back at enhanced modex type of
 

1209
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,870
back at enhanced modex type of
calculations which he did in the 1990s

1210
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:38,880
calculations which he did in the 1990s
 

1211
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,350
calculations which he did in the 1990s
we may be there today in terms of

1212
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:41,360
we may be there today in terms of
 

1213
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,590
we may be there today in terms of
computing power comparable to the brain

1214
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:43,600
computing power comparable to the brain
 

1215
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,310
computing power comparable to the brain
but it's not in the of the same style

1216
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:46,320
but it's not in the of the same style
 

1217
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,750
but it's not in the of the same style
it's of a very different style

1218
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:49,760

 

1219
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,149

so i mean for example the the style of

1220
00:22:52,149 --> 00:22:52,159
so i mean for example the the style of
 

1221
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,310
so i mean for example the the style of
computing that we have in our gpus

1222
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:54,320
computing that we have in our gpus
 

1223
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,669
computing that we have in our gpus
is far far more power hungry than

1224
00:22:57,669 --> 00:22:57,679
is far far more power hungry than
 

1225
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,310
is far far more power hungry than
the style of computing that is there in

1226
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:00,320
the style of computing that is there in
 

1227
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,149
the style of computing that is there in
the human brain or other

1228
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:02,159
the human brain or other
 

1229
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,590

00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:05,600
biological uh entities
 

1231
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,950
biological uh entities
yeah and that the efficiency part is uh

1232
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:08,960
yeah and that the efficiency part is uh
 

1233
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,310
yeah and that the efficiency part is uh
we're gonna have to solve that in order

1234
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:10,320
we're gonna have to solve that in order
 

1235
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,789
we're gonna have to solve that in order
to build actual real world systems

1236
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:12,799
to build actual real world systems
 

1237
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,990
to build actual real world systems
of large scale let me ask sort of

1238
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:16,000
of large scale let me ask sort of
 

1239
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,310
of large scale let me ask sort of
the high level question step taking a

does such a thing exist so if you look
 

1249
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,909
does such a thing exist so if you look
at the computer vision conferences and

00:23:27,909 --> 00:23:27,919
at the computer vision conferences and
 

1251
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,510
at the computer vision conferences and
the work that's been going on

00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:29,520
the work that's been going on
 

1253
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,510
the work that's been going on
it's often separated into different

it's often separated into different
 

1255
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,070
it's often separated into different
little segments

there's benchmarks for each

1266
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:46,559
there's benchmarks for each
 

1267
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,070
there's benchmarks for each
but if you were to sort of

but if you were to sort of
 

1269
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,990
but if you were to sort of
philosophically say what is

such a thing exist
yes but it's not in isolation so

1276
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:57,679
yes but it's not in isolation so
 

1277
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,789
yes but it's not in isolation so
if we have to so for all

always go back to sort of biology or

1282
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:08,240
always go back to sort of biology or
 

1283
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,350
always go back to sort of biology or
humans and if we think about

00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:11,360
humans and if we think about
 

1285
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,310
humans and if we think about

1287
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,190
vision or perception in that setting we
realize that

1288
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:15,200
realize that
 

1289
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,830
realize that

unless it is coupled with action so we

1298
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:25,279
unless it is coupled with action so we
 

1299
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:26,230
unless it is coupled with action so we
can go back

1300
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:26,240
can go back
 

1301
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,950
can go back
and think about the first multicellular

1302
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:28,960
and think about the first multicellular
 

1303
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,070
and think about the first multicellular
animals

1304
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:30,080
animals
 

1305
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,549
animals
which arose in the cambrian era you know

1306
00:24:32,549 --> 00:24:32,559
which arose in the cambrian era you know
 

1307
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,630
which arose in the cambrian era you know
500 million years ago

1308
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:34,640
500 million years ago
 

1309
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,750
500 million years ago
and uh these animals could move

1310
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:37,760
and uh these animals could move
 

1311
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,789
and uh these animals could move
and they could see in some ways and

1312
00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:40,799
and they could see in some ways and
 

1313
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:41,430
and they could see in some ways and
their two

1314
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:41,440
their two
 

1315
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,830
their two
activities helped each other because uh

1316
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:44,840
activities helped each other because uh
 

1317
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,909
activities helped each other because uh
uh how does movement help movement

1318
00:24:47,909 --> 00:24:47,919
uh how does movement help movement
 

1319
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,149
uh how does movement help movement
helps that because you can get food in

1320
00:24:50,149 --> 00:24:50,159
helps that because you can get food in
 

1321
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:51,990
helps that because you can get food in
different places

1322
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,000
different places
 

1323
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,310
different places
but you need to know where to go and

1324
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:54,320
but you need to know where to go and
 

1325
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,310
but you need to know where to go and
that's really about

1326
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:56,320
that's really about
 

1327
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,390
that's really about
perception or seeing i mean i mean

1328
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:58,400
perception or seeing i mean i mean
 

1329
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,590
perception or seeing i mean i mean
vision is

1330
00:24:59,590 --> 00:24:59,600
vision is
 

1331
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,549
vision is
perhaps the single most perception sense

1332
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:02,559
perhaps the single most perception sense
 

1333
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:02,870
perhaps the single most perception sense
but

1334
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:02,880
but
 

1335
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,789
but
all the others are equally are also

1336
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:04,799
all the others are equally are also
 

1337
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,310
all the others are equally are also
important so

1338
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:06,320
important so
 

1339
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,870
important so
uh so perception and action kind of grow

1340
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:08,880
uh so perception and action kind of grow
 

1341
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,909
uh so perception and action kind of grow
go together

1342
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:09,919
go together
 

1343
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,230
go together
so earlier it was in these very simple

1344
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:12,240
so earlier it was in these very simple
 

1345
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,430
so earlier it was in these very simple
feedback loops

1346
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:13,440
feedback loops
 

1347
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,110
feedback loops
which were about uh finding food

1348
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:17,120
which were about uh finding food
 

1349
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,110
which were about uh finding food
or avoiding becoming food if there's a

1350
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:19,120
or avoiding becoming food if there's a
 

1351
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,549
or avoiding becoming food if there's a
predator running uh

1352
00:25:20,549 --> 00:25:20,559
predator running uh
 

1353
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,830
predator running uh
trying to you know eat you up

1354
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:23,840
trying to you know eat you up
 

1355
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,789
trying to you know eat you up
and and so forth so so we must at the

1356
00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:26,799
and and so forth so so we must at the
 

1357
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:27,990
and and so forth so so we must at the
fundamental level connect

1358
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:28,000
fundamental level connect
 

1359
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,029
fundamental level connect
perception to action then

1360
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:31,039
perception to action then
 

1361
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,630
perception to action then
as we evolved uh perception became more

1362
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:34,640
as we evolved uh perception became more
 

1363
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,470
as we evolved uh perception became more
and more sophisticated

1364
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:36,480
and more sophisticated
 

1365
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,830
and more sophisticated
because it served many more purposes and

1366
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:39,840
because it served many more purposes and
 

1367
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,190
because it served many more purposes and
uh so today we have what seems like a

1368
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:43,200
uh so today we have what seems like a
 

1369
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,750
uh so today we have what seems like a
fairly general purpose capability

1370
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:45,760
fairly general purpose capability
 

1371
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,149
fairly general purpose capability
which can look at the external world and

1372
00:25:48,149 --> 00:25:48,159
which can look at the external world and
 

1373
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:49,110
which can look at the external world and
build and

1374
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:49,120
build and
 

1375
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,430
build and
a model of the external world inside the

1376
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:51,440
a model of the external world inside the
 

1377
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,350
a model of the external world inside the
head

1378
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:53,360
head
 

1379
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,430
head
we do have that capability that model is

1380
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:55,440
we do have that capability that model is
 

1381
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,710
we do have that capability that model is
not perfect

1382
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:56,720
not perfect
 

1383
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,630
not perfect
and psychologists have great fun in

1384
00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:58,640
and psychologists have great fun in
 

1385
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,470
and psychologists have great fun in
pointing out the ways in which

1386
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:00,480
pointing out the ways in which
 

1387
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,190
pointing out the ways in which
the model in your head is not a perfect

00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:03,200
the model in your head is not a perfect

model of the external world
and they have create various illusions

1392
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:08,000
and they have create various illusions
 

1393
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,710
and they have create various illusions
to

1394
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:08,720
to
 

1395
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,190
to
show the ways in which it is imperfect

1396
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:11,200
show the ways in which it is imperfect
 

1397
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,149
show the ways in which it is imperfect
but

1398
00:26:12,149 --> 00:26:12,159
but
 

1399
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,110
but
it's amazing how far it has come from a

have this

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,990
have this

these very sophisticated visual systems
 

1413
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,789
these very sophisticated visual systems
we can then

00:26:28,789 --> 00:26:28,799
we can then
 

1415
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,590
we can then
impose a structure on them it's we as

00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,350
this module of 3d reconstruction
what's going on is really all of these

1430
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:47,360
what's going on is really all of these
 

1431
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,149
what's going on is really all of these
processes are running

00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:49,159
processes are running
 

1433
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:53,909
processes are running
simultaneously and uh

00:26:53,909 --> 00:26:53,919

 

1435
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,230

and and they are running simultaneously
 

1437
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,149
and and they are running simultaneously
because originally their purpose was

00:26:58,149 --> 00:26:58,159
because originally their purpose was
 

1439
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,190
because originally their purpose was
in fact to help guide action so

1440
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:01,200
in fact to help guide action so

as a guiding general statement of a

00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,510
as a guiding general statement of a

1444
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:05,520
problem do you think
 

1445
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,070

we can say that the the general problem

we can say that the the general problem
 

1447

we can say that the the general problem

of computer vision
 

1449
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,470
of computer vision
you said in humans it was tied to action

1450
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:14,480
you said in humans it was tied to action
 

1451
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,310
you said in humans it was tied to action
do you think we should also say that

1452
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:16,320
do you think we should also say that
 

1453
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,789
do you think we should also say that
ultimately the the goal

1454
00:27:18,789 --> 00:27:18,799
ultimately the the goal
 

1455
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:21,110
ultimately the the goal
the problem of computer vision is to

00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:21,120
the problem of computer vision is to
 

1457
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,950
the problem of computer vision is to
sense the world

1458
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:22,960
sense the world
 

1459
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,310
sense the world
in the way that helps you act in the

00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:26,320
in the way that helps you act in the

world
 

1463
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,669
world
yes i think that's the most fundamental

1464
00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:29,679
yes i think that's the most fundamental
 

1465
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:30,389
yes i think that's the most fundamental
uh

1466
00:27:30,389 --> 00:27:30,399
uh
 

1467
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,590
uh
that's the most fundamental purpose

1468
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:33,600
that's the most fundamental purpose
 

1469
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,110
that's the most fundamental purpose
we have by now hyper evolved

1470
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:37,120
we have by now hyper evolved
 

1471
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,830
we have by now hyper evolved
so we have this visual system which can

1472
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:39,840
so we have this visual system which can
 

1473
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,750
so we have this visual system which can
be used for other things

1474
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:41,760
be used for other things
 

1475
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,470
be used for other things
for example judging the aesthetic value

1476
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:44,480
for example judging the aesthetic value
 

1477
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,630
for example judging the aesthetic value
of a painting

1478
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:46,640
of a painting
 

1479
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,269
of a painting
and this is not guiding action maybe

1480
00:27:49,269 --> 00:27:49,279
and this is not guiding action maybe
 

1481
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,430
and this is not guiding action maybe
it's guiding action in terms of how much

1482
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:51,440
it's guiding action in terms of how much
 

1483
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,990
it's guiding action in terms of how much
money you will put in your auction bid

1484
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:54,000
money you will put in your auction bid
 

1485
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,750
money you will put in your auction bid
but that's a bit stretched

1486
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:55,760
but that's a bit stretched
 

1487
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,789
but that's a bit stretched
but the basics are in fact in terms of

1488
00:27:58,789 --> 00:27:58,799
but the basics are in fact in terms of
 

1489
00:27:58,799 --> 00:27:59,590
but the basics are in fact in terms of
action

1490

action
 

1491
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,190
action
but we have we've evolved

1492
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:03,200
but we have we've evolved
 

1493
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,470
but we have we've evolved

actually just too uh sorry to interrupt

00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:10,080
actually just too uh sorry to interrupt
 

1499
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,510
actually just too uh sorry to interrupt
but perhaps it is

1500
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:11,520
but perhaps it is
 

1501
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,830
but perhaps it is
fundamentally about action you kind of

1502
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:13,840
fundamentally about action you kind of
 

1503
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,510
fundamentally about action you kind of
jokingly said about spending

00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:15,520
jokingly said about spending
 

1505
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,190
jokingly said about spending
but perhaps the capitalistic

1506
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:19,200
but perhaps the capitalistic
 

1507
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,350
but perhaps the capitalistic
uh drive that drives a lot of the

1508
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:21,360
uh drive that drives a lot of the
 

1509
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,430
uh drive that drives a lot of the
development in this world

1510
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:23,440
development in this world
 

1511
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,950
development in this world
is is about to exchange your money and

1512
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:24,960
is is about to exchange your money and
 

1513
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,630
is is about to exchange your money and
the fundamental action is money if you

1514
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:26,640
the fundamental action is money if you
 

1515
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:26,950
the fundamental action is money if you
watch

1516
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:26,960
watch
 

1517
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,350
watch
netflix if you enjoy watching movies

1518
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:29,360
netflix if you enjoy watching movies
 

1519
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,950
netflix if you enjoy watching movies
you're using your perception system to

1520
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:30,960
you're using your perception system to
 

1521
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,549
you're using your perception system to
interpret the movie

1522
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:32,559
interpret the movie
 

1523
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,549
interpret the movie
ultimately your enjoyment of that movie

1524
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:34,559
ultimately your enjoyment of that movie
 

1525
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,630
ultimately your enjoyment of that movie
means you'll subscribe to netflix

1526
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:36,640
means you'll subscribe to netflix
 

1527
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,070
means you'll subscribe to netflix
so the action is this uh

1528
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:40,080
so the action is this uh
 

1529
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,990
so the action is this uh
this extra layer that we've developed in

this extra layer that we've developed in
 

1531
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,990
this extra layer that we've developed in
modern society perhaps this is

1532
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:44,000
modern society perhaps this is
 

1533
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,750
modern society perhaps this is
fundamentally tied to the action of

1534
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:45,760
fundamentally tied to the action of
 

1535
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,510
fundamentally tied to the action of
spending money

1536
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:47,520
spending money
 

1537
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,830
spending money
well certainly with respect to uh

00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:51,840
well certainly with respect to uh

00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,789
well certainly with respect to uh
you know interactions with firms so so

00:28:54,789 --> 00:28:54,799
you know interactions with firms so so
 

1541
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,789
you know interactions with firms so so
in this homo economics role

00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:59,110
in this homo economics role
when you're interacting with firms it

1544
00:28:59,110 --> 00:28:59,120
when you're interacting with firms it
 

1545
00:28:59,120 --> 00:28:59,909
when you're interacting with firms it
does become

uh it does become that that's what else

1548
00:29:02,149 --> 00:29:02,159
uh it does become that that's what else
 

1549
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,269
uh it does become that that's what else
is there

1551
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,590

uh that was a rhetorical question okay

1552
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:07,600
uh that was a rhetorical question okay
 

1553
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,669
uh that was a rhetorical question okay
so

1554
00:29:09,669 --> 00:29:09,679

have been in the static world in
 

1567
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,870
have been in the static world in
looking at static images and then you've

1568
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:24,880
looking at static images and then you've
 

1569
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,350
looking at static images and then you've

also
 

1571
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,750
also
worked on starting but it's a much

worked on starting but it's a much
 

1573
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,350

smaller degree the community is looking

at dynamic and video
 

1577
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,750
at dynamic and video
at dynamic scenes and then there is

1578
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:33,760
at dynamic scenes and then there is
 

1579
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,110
at dynamic scenes and then there is
robotic vision

robotic vision
 

1581
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,149
robotic vision
which is dynamic but also where you

which is dynamic but also where you

00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,669
which is dynamic but also where you
actually have a robot in the physical

well of course one image is harder but

1596
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:54,240
well of course one image is harder but
 

1597
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,350
well of course one image is harder but
so if you look at a deeper question

1598
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:57,360
so if you look at a deeper question
 

1599
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,389
so if you look at a deeper question
there

there
 

1601
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:01,669
there
are we um what's the term cutting

1602
00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:01,679
are we um what's the term cutting
 

1603
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:02,630
are we um what's the term cutting
ourselves

ourselves
 

1605
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,549

00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,190
making the problem harder by focusing on
the images that's a fair question i

00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,029
the images that's a fair question i
think

sometimes we we can simplify our problem

sometimes we we can simplify our problem

sometimes we we can simplify our problem
so much

so much
that we essentially lose

00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,269
to solve the problem
and one could reasonably argue that to

and one could reasonably argue that to
 

1625
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:29,190
and one could reasonably argue that to
some extent this happens when we go from

some extent this happens when we go from

now historically uh you have to consider

00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,830
not enough storage
so so think of these choices so one of

1660
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:09,840
so so think of these choices so one of
 

1661
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,269
so so think of these choices so one of
the choices is

1662
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:11,279
the choices is
 

1663
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,190
the choices is
focusing on single images rather than

1664
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:13,200
focusing on single images rather than
 

1665
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,430
focusing on single images rather than
video okay

1666
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:15,440
video okay
 

1667
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,269
video okay
clear questions storage and compute

1668
00:31:19,269 --> 00:31:19,279
clear questions storage and compute
 

1669
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:22,470
clear questions storage and compute
we had to focus on we did we

1670
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:22,480
we had to focus on we did we
 

1671
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,310
we had to focus on we did we
used to detect edges and throw away the

1672
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:24,320
used to detect edges and throw away the
 

1673
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,630
used to detect edges and throw away the
image right so you have an image

1674
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:26,640
image right so you have an image
 

1675
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,750
image right so you have an image
which i say 256 by 256 pixels and

1676
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:29,760
which i say 256 by 256 pixels and
 

1677
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,070
which i say 256 by 256 pixels and
instead of keeping around the grayscale

1678
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:32,080
instead of keeping around the grayscale
 

1679
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,350
instead of keeping around the grayscale
value what we did was we detected edges

1680
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:35,360
value what we did was we detected edges
 

1681
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,350
value what we did was we detected edges
find the places where the brightness

1682
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:37,360
find the places where the brightness
 

1683
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,549
find the places where the brightness
changes a lot

1684
00:31:38,549 --> 00:31:38,559
changes a lot
 

1685
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,110
changes a lot
so now that and now and then throw away

1686
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:41,120
so now that and now and then throw away
 

1687
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:41,830
so now that and now and then throw away
the rest

1688
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:41,840
the rest
 

1689
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,630
the rest
so this was a major compression device

1690
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:44,640
so this was a major compression device
 

1691
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,029
so this was a major compression device
and the hope was that this makes it

1692
00:31:47,029 --> 00:31:47,039
and the hope was that this makes it
 

1693
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,789
and the hope was that this makes it
that you can still work with it and the

1694
00:31:48,789 --> 00:31:48,799
that you can still work with it and the
 

1695
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:51,269
that you can still work with it and the
logic was humans can interpret a line

1696
00:31:51,269 --> 00:31:51,279
logic was humans can interpret a line
 

1697
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,950
logic was humans can interpret a line
drawing

1698
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:52,960
drawing
 

1699
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,110
drawing
and uh and yes and this will save us a

1700
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:57,120
and uh and yes and this will save us a
 

1701
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,350
and uh and yes and this will save us a
competition so many of the choices were

1702
00:31:59,350 --> 00:31:59,360
competition so many of the choices were
 

1703
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,950
competition so many of the choices were
dictated by that

1704
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:00,960
dictated by that
 

1705
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,990
dictated by that
i think uh today

1706
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:04,000
i think uh today
 

1707
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,110
i think uh today
we are no longer detecting edges right

1708
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:07,120
we are no longer detecting edges right
 

1709
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:07,430
we are no longer detecting edges right
we

1710
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:07,440
we
 

1711
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,070
we
process images with convnets because we

1712
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:10,080
process images with convnets because we
 

1713
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,669
process images with convnets because we
don't need to we don't have that

1714
00:32:11,669 --> 00:32:11,679
don't need to we don't have that
 

1715
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,389
don't need to we don't have that
those compute restrictions anymore now

1716
00:32:14,389 --> 00:32:14,399
those compute restrictions anymore now
 

1717
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:15,430
those compute restrictions anymore now
video is still

1718
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:15,440
video is still
 

1719
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,750
video is still
under studied because video compute is

1720
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:17,760
under studied because video compute is
 

1721
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,509
under studied because video compute is
still quite challenging

1722
00:32:19,509 --> 00:32:19,519
still quite challenging
 

1723
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,389

the youtube search and discovery and
 

1741
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,909
the youtube search and discovery and
they still struggle doing stuff on

video it's very difficult except doing

1744
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:40,720
video it's very difficult except doing
 

1745
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,310
video it's very difficult except doing
except using techniques that are

00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:42,320
except using techniques that are
 

1747
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,149
except using techniques that are
essentially the techniques you used in

00:32:44,149 --> 00:32:44,159
essentially the techniques you used in
 

1749
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,029
essentially the techniques you used in
in the 90s some very basic computer

1750
00:32:47,029 --> 00:32:47,039
in the 90s some very basic computer

vision techniques

1752
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:48,480
vision techniques
 

1753
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,789
vision techniques
no that's when you want to do things at

1754
00:32:50,789 --> 00:32:50,799
no that's when you want to do things at
 

1755
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,149
no that's when you want to do things at
scale so if

1756
00:32:52,149 --> 00:32:52,159
scale so if
 

1757
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,710
scale so if
you want to operate at the scale of all

1758
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:54,720
you want to operate at the scale of all
 

1759
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,389
you want to operate at the scale of all
the content of youtube it's very

1760
00:32:56,389 --> 00:32:56,399
the content of youtube it's very
 

1761
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,070
the content of youtube it's very
challenging and there's similar issues

1762
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:58,080
challenging and there's similar issues
 

1763
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,310
challenging and there's similar issues
in

1764
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:58,320
in
 

1765
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,509
in
facebook but as a researcher you

1766
00:33:01,509 --> 00:33:01,519
facebook but as a researcher you
 

1767
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,710
facebook but as a researcher you
you have you have more uh you know

1768
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:04,720
you have you have more uh you know
 

1769
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,669
you have you have more uh you know
opportunities

1770
00:33:05,669 --> 00:33:05,679
opportunities
 

1771
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:07,269
opportunities
you can train large you know that works

1772
00:33:07,269 --> 00:33:07,279
you can train large you know that works
 

1773
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,870
you can train large you know that works
with relatively large

1774
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:08,880
with relatively large
 

1775
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,750
with relatively large
uh video data sets yeah yes so i think

1776
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:11,760
uh video data sets yeah yes so i think
 

1777
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,310
uh video data sets yeah yes so i think
that

1778
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:12,320
that
 

1779
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,789
that
this is part of the reason why we have

1780
00:33:14,789 --> 00:33:14,799
this is part of the reason why we have
 

1781
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:17,110
this is part of the reason why we have
so emphasized static images

1782
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:17,120
so emphasized static images
 

1783
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,190
so emphasized static images
i think that this is changing and over

1784
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:19,200
i think that this is changing and over
 

1785
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,389
i think that this is changing and over
the next few years

1786
00:33:20,389 --> 00:33:20,399
the next few years
 

1787
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:24,470
the next few years
i see a lot more progress happening in

1788
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:24,480
i see a lot more progress happening in
 

1789
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,750
i see a lot more progress happening in
in video so i have this generic

1790
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:27,760
in video so i have this generic
 

1791
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,269
in video so i have this generic
statement that

1792
00:33:29,269 --> 00:33:29,279
statement that
 

1793
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,509
statement that
to me video recognition feels like 10

1794
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:31,519
to me video recognition feels like 10
 

1795
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:32,549
to me video recognition feels like 10
years behind

1796
00:33:32,549 --> 00:33:32,559
years behind
 

1797
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:35,509
years behind
object recognition and you can quantify

1798
00:33:35,509 --> 00:33:35,519
object recognition and you can quantify
 

1799
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:36,389
object recognition and you can quantify
that because

1800
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:36,399
that because
 

1801
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:37,830
that because
you can take some of the challenging

1802
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:37,840
you can take some of the challenging
 

1803
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,909
you can take some of the challenging
video data sets and

1804
00:33:39,909 --> 00:33:39,919
video data sets and
 

1805
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:41,669
video data sets and
their performance on action

1806
00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:41,679
their performance on action
 

1807
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,470
their performance on action
classification is like say 30

1808
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:44,480
classification is like say 30
 

1809
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,190
classification is like say 30
which is kind of what we used to have

1810
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:47,200
which is kind of what we used to have
 

1811
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,149
which is kind of what we used to have
around

1812
00:33:49,149 --> 00:33:49,159
around
 

1813
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:52,470
around
2009 in object detection you know so

1814
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:52,480
2009 in object detection you know so
 

1815
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,549
2009 in object detection you know so
it's like about 10 years behind

1816
00:33:54,549 --> 00:33:54,559
it's like about 10 years behind
 

1817
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:57,190
it's like about 10 years behind
and uh whether it'll take 10 years to

1818
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:57,200
and uh whether it'll take 10 years to
 

1819
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,630
and uh whether it'll take 10 years to
catch up is a different question

1820
00:33:58,630 --> 00:33:58,640
catch up is a different question
 

1821
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,070
catch up is a different question
hopefully it will take less than that

1822
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:02,080
hopefully it will take less than that
 

1823
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,750
hopefully it will take less than that
let me ask a similar question i've

1824
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:03,760
let me ask a similar question i've
 

1825
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,990
let me ask a similar question i've
already asked but once again so for

1826
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:06,000
already asked but once again so for
 

1827
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,389
already asked but once again so for
dynamic scenes

1828
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:08,399
dynamic scenes
 

1829
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,030
dynamic scenes
do you think do you think some kind of

1830
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:11,040
do you think do you think some kind of
 

1831
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:11,829
do you think do you think some kind of
injection

1832
00:34:11,829 --> 00:34:11,839
injection
 

1833
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:14,629
injection
of knowledge basis and reasoning is

1834
00:34:14,629 --> 00:34:14,639
of knowledge basis and reasoning is
 

1835
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:15,909
of knowledge basis and reasoning is
required

1836
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:15,919
required
 

1837
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:19,990
required
to help improve like action recognition

1838
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:20,000
to help improve like action recognition
 

1839
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,230
to help improve like action recognition
like if if if um

1840
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:24,240
like if if if um
 

1841
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,750
like if if if um
if we solve the general action

1842
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:25,760
if we solve the general action
 

1843
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,589
if we solve the general action
recognition problem

1844
00:34:27,589 --> 00:34:27,599
recognition problem
 

1845
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:28,790
recognition problem
what do you think the solution would

1846
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:28,800
what do you think the solution would
 

1847
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,950
what do you think the solution would
look like it's another way yeah

1848
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:30,960
look like it's another way yeah
 

1849
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,069
look like it's another way yeah
so i i completely

1850
00:34:34,069 --> 00:34:34,079
so i i completely
 

1851
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,270
so i i completely
agree that knowledge is called for and

1852
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:37,280
agree that knowledge is called for and
 

1853
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,310
agree that knowledge is called for and
that knowledge can be

1854
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:38,320
that knowledge can be
 

1855
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,470
that knowledge can be
quite sophisticated so the way i would

1856
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:40,480
quite sophisticated so the way i would
 

1857
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,349
quite sophisticated so the way i would
say it is that

1858
00:34:41,349 --> 00:34:41,359
say it is that
 

1859
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,990
say it is that
perception blends into cognition and

1860
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:44,000
perception blends into cognition and
 

1861
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,190
perception blends into cognition and
cognition brings in

1862
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:45,200
cognition brings in
 

1863
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,109
cognition brings in
issues of memory and

1864
00:34:49,109 --> 00:34:49,119
issues of memory and
 

1865
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,990
issues of memory and
this notion of a schema from psychology

1866
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:52,000
this notion of a schema from psychology
 

1867
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,030
this notion of a schema from psychology
which is

1868
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:53,040
which is
 

1869
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,190
which is
uh let me use the classic example which

1870
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:55,200
uh let me use the classic example which
 

1871
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,310
uh let me use the classic example which
is

1872
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:56,320
is

example of ai from the 1970s

1890
00:35:19,349 --> 00:35:19,359
example of ai from the 1970s
 

1891
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:21,990
example of ai from the 1970s
uh it was called there was the term

1892
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:22,000
uh it was called there was the term
 

1893
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,430
uh it was called there was the term
frames and

1894

frames and
 

1895
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,349
frames and
scripts and schemas these are all quite

1896
00:35:25,349 --> 00:35:25,359
scripts and schemas these are all quite
 

1897
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:26,950
scripts and schemas these are all quite
similar ideas

1898
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:26,960
similar ideas
 

1899
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,069
similar ideas
okay in the 70s the way

1900
00:35:30,069 --> 00:35:30,079
okay in the 70s the way
 

1901
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,150
okay in the 70s the way
the ai of the time dealt with it was by

1902
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:32,160
the ai of the time dealt with it was by

build hand coding this

1904
00:35:34,069 --> 00:35:34,079
build hand coding this
 

1905
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,470
build hand coding this
so they hand coded in this notion of a

1906
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:36,480
so they hand coded in this notion of a
 

1907
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,310
so they hand coded in this notion of a
script and the various

1908
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:38,320
script and the various
 

1909
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,950
script and the various
stages and the actors and so on and so

1910
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:40,960
stages and the actors and so on and so
 

1911
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,910
stages and the actors and so on and so
forth

1912
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:41,920
forth
 

1913
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,470
forth
and use that to interpret for example

1914
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:44,480
and use that to interpret for example
 

1915
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,349
and use that to interpret for example
language

1916
00:35:45,349 --> 00:35:45,359
language
 

1917
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:48,470
language
i mean if there's a description of a of

1918
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:48,480
i mean if there's a description of a of
 

1919
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,630
i mean if there's a description of a of
a story involving

1920
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:50,640
a story involving
 

1921
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,790
a story involving
some people eating at a restaurant there

1922
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:52,800
some people eating at a restaurant there
 

1923
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,470
some people eating at a restaurant there
are way all these

1924
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:54,480
are way all these
 

1925
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,109
are way all these
inferences you can make because you know

1926
00:35:57,109 --> 00:35:57,119
inferences you can make because you know
 

1927
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,069
inferences you can make because you know
what happens typically at a restaurant

1928
00:36:00,069 --> 00:36:00,079
what happens typically at a restaurant
 

1929
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:03,109
what happens typically at a restaurant
so i think this kind of uh

1930
00:36:03,109 --> 00:36:03,119
so i think this kind of uh
 

1931
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,630
so i think this kind of uh
this kind of knowledge is absolutely

1932
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:04,640
this kind of knowledge is absolutely
 

1933
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,710
this kind of knowledge is absolutely
essential so i think

1934
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:06,720
essential so i think
 

1935
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,510
essential so i think
that when we are going to do long-form

1936
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:09,520
that when we are going to do long-form

1938
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:11,520
video understanding
 

1939
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,750
video understanding
we are going to need to do this i think

1940
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:13,760
we are going to need to do this i think
 

1941
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,510
we are going to need to do this i think
the kinds of technology that we have

1942
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:15,520
the kinds of technology that we have
 

1943
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,710
the kinds of technology that we have
right now with

1944
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:16,720
right now with

00:36:23,589 --> 00:36:23,599
it's very much tailored towards

it's very much tailored towards

1952
00:36:25,829 --> 00:36:25,839
short-term video understanding
 

1953
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:28,230
short-term video understanding
not that long-term understanding

00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:28,240
not that long-term understanding

00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,750
not that long-term understanding
long-term understanding

long-term understanding
 

1957
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,030
long-term understanding
requires a notion of

1958
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:33,040
requires a notion of
 

1959
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,790
requires a notion of
this notion of schemas that i talked

1960
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:34,800
this notion of schemas that i talked
 

1961
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,950
this notion of schemas that i talked
about perhaps some notions of

1962
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:36,960
about perhaps some notions of
 

1963
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,870
about perhaps some notions of

1965
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,910
goals intentionality functionality
and so on and so forth now

1966
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:43,920
and so on and so forth now
 

1967
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,390
and so on and so forth now
how will we bring that in so we could

1968
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:46,400
how will we bring that in so we could
 

1969
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,710
how will we bring that in so we could
either revert back to the 70s and say

1970
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:48,720
either revert back to the 70s and say
 

1971
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,109
either revert back to the 70s and say
okay i'm going to hand code in

1972
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:51,119
okay i'm going to hand code in
 

1973
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,470
okay i'm going to hand code in
a script or we might

1974
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:54,480
a script or we might
 

1975
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,069
a script or we might
try to learn it so i

1976
00:36:58,069 --> 00:36:58,079
try to learn it so i
 

1977
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,550
try to learn it so i
tend to believe that we have to find

1978
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:00,560
tend to believe that we have to find
 

1979
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,790
tend to believe that we have to find
learning ways of doing this

1980
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:02,800
learning ways of doing this
 

1981
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,790
learning ways of doing this
because i think learning ways to land up

1982
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:04,800
because i think learning ways to land up
 

1983
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,550
because i think learning ways to land up
being more robust

1984
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:06,560
being more robust
 

1985
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,550
being more robust
and there must be a learning version of

1986
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:08,560
and there must be a learning version of
 

1987
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,150
and there must be a learning version of
the story because

1988
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:10,160
the story because
 

1989
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,470
the story because
uh children acquire a lot of this

1990
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:12,480
uh children acquire a lot of this
 

1991
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,510
uh children acquire a lot of this
knowledge

1992
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:13,520
knowledge
 

1993
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,190
knowledge
by uh sort of just observation so

1994
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:17,200
by uh sort of just observation so
 

1995
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,190
by uh sort of just observation so
at no moment in a child's life there's a

1996
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:21,200
at no moment in a child's life there's a
 

1997
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,750
at no moment in a child's life there's a
it's possible but i think it's not so

1998
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:23,760
it's possible but i think it's not so
 

1999
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,630
it's possible but i think it's not so
typical that

2000
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:24,640
typical that
 

2001
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,750
typical that
somebody that a mother coaches a child

2002
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:27,760
somebody that a mother coaches a child
 

2003
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,430
somebody that a mother coaches a child
through all the stages of what happens

2004
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:29,440
through all the stages of what happens
 

2005
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,390
through all the stages of what happens
in a restaurant

2006
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:30,400
in a restaurant
 

2007
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,430
in a restaurant
they just go as a family they they

2008
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:33,440
they just go as a family they they
 

2009
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,190
they just go as a family they they
they go to the restaurant they eat come

2010
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:35,200
they go to the restaurant they eat come
 

2011
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,030
they go to the restaurant they eat come
back and the child goes through 10 such

2012
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:37,040
back and the child goes through 10 such
 

2013

experiences
 

2015
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,550
experiences
and the child has has got a schema of

2016
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:40,560
and the child has has got a schema of
 

2017
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,470
and the child has has got a schema of
what happens when you go to a restaurant

2018
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:42,480
what happens when you go to a restaurant
 

2019
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,829
what happens when you go to a restaurant
so we somehow need to we need to provide

00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:56,480
that many people
 

2031
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,030
that many people
like you said many people know and very

00:37:59,030 --> 00:37:59,040
like you said many people know and very
 

2033
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,030
like you said many people know and very
few have read

00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:03,359
where he proposes the turing test this
 

2037
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:04,870
where he proposes the turing test this
is this is how you know because it's

2038
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:04,880
is this is how you know because it's
 

2039
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,550
is this is how you know because it's
towards the end of the paper

2040
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:06,560
towards the end of the paper
 

2041
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,310
towards the end of the paper
instead of trying to produce a program

2042
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:08,320
instead of trying to produce a program
 

2043
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,910
instead of trying to produce a program
to simulate the adult mind

2044
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:09,920
to simulate the adult mind
 

2045
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,910
to simulate the adult mind
why not rather try to produce one which

2046
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:11,920
why not rather try to produce one which
 

2047
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,230
why not rather try to produce one which
simulates the child's

2048
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:14,240
simulates the child's
 

2049
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,270
simulates the child's
so that's a really interesting point if

2050
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:17,280
so that's a really interesting point if
 

2051
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,270
so that's a really interesting point if
i think about the benchmarks we have

2052
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:19,280
i think about the benchmarks we have
 

2053
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,550
i think about the benchmarks we have
before us the the tests

2054
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:22,560
before us the the tests
 

2055
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,550
before us the the tests
of our computer vision systems they're

2056
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:24,560
of our computer vision systems they're
 

2057
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,150
of our computer vision systems they're
often kind of trying to

2058
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:26,160
often kind of trying to
 

2059
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,030
often kind of trying to
get to the adult so what kind of

2060
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:29,040
get to the adult so what kind of
 

2061
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,870
get to the adult so what kind of
benchmarks should we have

2062
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:30,880
benchmarks should we have
 

2063
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,470
benchmarks should we have
what kind of tests for computer vision

2064
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:32,480
what kind of tests for computer vision
 

2065
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,310
what kind of tests for computer vision
do you think we should have

2066
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:34,320
do you think we should have
 

2067
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,750
do you think we should have
that mimic the child's in computer

2068
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:37,760
that mimic the child's in computer
 

2069
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,390
that mimic the child's in computer
vision yeah

2070
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:38,400
vision yeah
 

2071
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,790
vision yeah
i think we should have those and we

2072
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:40,800
i think we should have those and we
 

2073
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,550
i think we should have those and we
don't have those today

2074
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:42,560
don't have those today
 

2075
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,470
don't have those today
and i think uh the part of that

2076
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:46,480
and i think uh the part of that
 

2077
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,150
and i think uh the part of that
the challenge is that we should really

2078
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:48,160
the challenge is that we should really
 

2079
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,829
the challenge is that we should really
be collecting data

2080
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:49,839
be collecting data
 

2081
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:52,950
be collecting data
of the type that a child uh that the

2082
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:52,960
of the type that a child uh that the
 

2083
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,710
of the type that a child uh that the
child experiences

2084
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:54,720
child experiences
 

2085
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,790
child experiences
right so that gets into issues of you

2086
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:56,800
right so that gets into issues of you
 

2087
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,109
right so that gets into issues of you
know privacy and so on and so forth

2088
00:38:59,109 --> 00:38:59,119
know privacy and so on and so forth
 

2089
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,030
know privacy and so on and so forth
but there are attempts in this direction

2090
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:01,040
but there are attempts in this direction
 

2091
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,150
but there are attempts in this direction
to

2092
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:02,160
to
 

2093
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,870
to
sort of try to collect the kind of data

2094
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:04,880
sort of try to collect the kind of data
 

2095
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,990
sort of try to collect the kind of data
that a child

2096
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:06,000
that a child
 

2097
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,349
that a child
encounters growing up so what's the

2098
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:09,359
encounters growing up so what's the
 

2099
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:10,390
encounters growing up so what's the
child's linguistic

2100
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:10,400
child's linguistic
 

2101
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,150
child's linguistic
environment what's the child's visual

2102
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:12,160
environment what's the child's visual
 

2103
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,430
environment what's the child's visual
environment

2104
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:13,440
environment
 

2105
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,030
environment
so if we could collect that kind of data

2106
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:17,040
so if we could collect that kind of data
 

2107
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,390
so if we could collect that kind of data
and then develop learning schemes based

2108
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:20,400
and then develop learning schemes based
 

2109
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,670
and then develop learning schemes based
on that data

2110
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:21,680
on that data
 

2111
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,670
on that data
that would be one way to do it i

2112
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:25,680
that would be one way to do it i
 

2113
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,190
that would be one way to do it i
i think that's a very promising

2114
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:27,200
i think that's a very promising
 

2115
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,670
i think that's a very promising
direction myself there might be people

2116
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:29,680
direction myself there might be people
 

2117
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,030
direction myself there might be people
who would argue

2118
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:31,040
who would argue
 

2119
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,870
who would argue
that we could just short circuit this in

2120
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:32,880
that we could just short circuit this in
 

2121
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,470
that we could just short circuit this in
some way and

2122
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:34,480
some way and
 

2123
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,829
some way and
uh sometimes we have

2124
00:39:37,829 --> 00:39:37,839
uh sometimes we have
 

2125
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:41,349
uh sometimes we have
imitated uh we have not

2126
00:39:41,349 --> 00:39:41,359
imitated uh we have not
 

2127
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:43,190
imitated uh we have not
we have had success by not imitating

2128
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:43,200
we have had success by not imitating
 

2129
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,950
we have had success by not imitating
nature in detail so

2130
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:44,960
nature in detail so
 

2131
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,510
nature in detail so
the usual example is airplanes right we

2132
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:47,520
the usual example is airplanes right we
 

2133
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,910
the usual example is airplanes right we
don't build flapping winds

2134
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:49,920
don't build flapping winds
 

2135
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,190
don't build flapping winds
flapping wings so uh

2136
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:53,200
flapping wings so uh
 

2137
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,510
flapping wings so uh
yes that's uh that's one of the points

2138
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:55,520
yes that's uh that's one of the points
 

2139
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,630
yes that's uh that's one of the points
of debate

2140
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:56,640
of debate
 

2141
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:01,270
of debate
uh in my mind i i i would i would bet on

2142
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:01,280
uh in my mind i i i would i would bet on
 

2143
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,950
uh in my mind i i i would i would bet on
this this learning like a child approach

2144
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:04,960
this this learning like a child approach
 

2145
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,550
this this learning like a child approach
so one of the fundamental aspects of

2146
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:08,560
so one of the fundamental aspects of
 

2147
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,910
so one of the fundamental aspects of
learning like a child is the

2148
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:09,920
learning like a child is the
 

2149
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,190
learning like a child is the
interactivity

2150
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:11,200
interactivity
 

2151
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,030
interactivity
so the child gets to play with the data

2152
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:13,040
so the child gets to play with the data
 

2153
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,230
so the child gets to play with the data
set it's learning from

2154
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:14,240
set it's learning from
 

2155
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,390
set it's learning from
yes it's against the select i mean you

2156
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:16,400
yes it's against the select i mean you
 

2157
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,309
yes it's against the select i mean you
can call that active learning you can

2158
00:40:18,309 --> 00:40:18,319
can call that active learning you can
 

2159
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,550
can call that active learning you can
you know in the machine learning world

2160
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:20,560
you know in the machine learning world
 

2161
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,349
you know in the machine learning world
you can call it a lot of terms

2162
00:40:23,349 --> 00:40:23,359
you can call it a lot of terms
 

2163
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,030
you can call it a lot of terms
what are your thoughts about this whole

2164
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:25,040
what are your thoughts about this whole
 

2165
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,870
what are your thoughts about this whole
space of being able to play with the

2166
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:26,880
space of being able to play with the
 

2167
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,430
space of being able to play with the
data set or select what you're learning

2168
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:29,440
data set or select what you're learning
 

2169
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,470
data set or select what you're learning
yeah so i think that uh i

2170
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:32,480
yeah so i think that uh i
 

2171
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,910
yeah so i think that uh i
i believe in that and i think that we

2172
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:35,920
i believe in that and i think that we
 

2173
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,710
i believe in that and i think that we
could achieve it in in two ways and i

2174
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:38,720
could achieve it in in two ways and i
 

2175
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,630
could achieve it in in two ways and i
think we should use both

2176
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:40,640
think we should use both
 

2177
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,990
think we should use both
so one is uh actually

2178
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:44,000
so one is uh actually
 

2179
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,430
so one is uh actually
real robotics right so real uh

2180
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:47,440
real robotics right so real uh
 

2181
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,950
real robotics right so real uh
you know physical embodiments of agents

2182
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:50,960
you know physical embodiments of agents
 

2183
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,550
you know physical embodiments of agents
who are interacting with the world and

2184
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:52,560
who are interacting with the world and
 

2185
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,150
who are interacting with the world and
they have a physical body with

2186
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:54,160
they have a physical body with
 

2187
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,910
they have a physical body with
dynamics and mass and moment of inertia

2188
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:57,920
dynamics and mass and moment of inertia
 

2189
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,630
dynamics and mass and moment of inertia
and friction and all the rest and you

2190
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:00,640
and friction and all the rest and you
 

2191
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,470
and friction and all the rest and you
learn your body the robot learns its

2192
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:02,480
learn your body the robot learns its
 

2193
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,190
learn your body the robot learns its
body by

environments
 

2201
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,390
environments
so i think simulation environments are

2202
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:14,400
so i think simulation environments are
 

2203
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,790
so i think simulation environments are
getting much much better

2204
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:16,800
getting much much better
 

2205
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,069

00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:24,640
worked on something called habitat
 

2211
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,150
worked on something called habitat
which is a simulation environment

2212

2221
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,910
of
various urban spaces and so forth and as

2222
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:39,920
various urban spaces and so forth and as
 

2223
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,630
various urban spaces and so forth and as
you move

2224
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:40,640
you move
 

2225
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,790
you move
you get a picture which is a pretty

2226
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:42,800
you get a picture which is a pretty
 

2227
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,790
you get a picture which is a pretty
accurate picture

2228
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:44,800
accurate picture
 

2229
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,710
accurate picture
so uh i i can now uh you can imagine

2230
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:48,720
so uh i i can now uh you can imagine
 

2231
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,910
so uh i i can now uh you can imagine
that

2232
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:49,920
that
 

2233
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,589
that
subsequent generations of these

2234
00:41:51,589 --> 00:41:51,599
subsequent generations of these
 

2235
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:54,150
subsequent generations of these
simulators will be accurate not just

2236
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:54,160
simulators will be accurate not just
 

2237
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,710
simulators will be accurate not just
visually but with respect to

2238
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:56,720
visually but with respect to
 

2239
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,910
visually but with respect to
you know forces and masses and

2240
00:41:59,910 --> 00:41:59,920
you know forces and masses and
 

2241
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,109
you know forces and masses and
haptic interactions and so on

2242
00:42:03,109 --> 00:42:03,119
haptic interactions and so on
 

2243
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,150
haptic interactions and so on
and uh then then we have that

2244
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:06,160
and uh then then we have that
 

2245
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,510
and uh then then we have that
environment to play with

2246
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:07,520
environment to play with
 

2247
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:11,430
environment to play with
i think that let me state one reason why

2248
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:11,440
i think that let me state one reason why
 

2249
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,230
i think that let me state one reason why
i think

2250
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:12,240
i think
 

2251
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,270
i think
this active being able to act in the

2252
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:15,280
this active being able to act in the
 

2253
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:15,750
this active being able to act in the
world is

2254
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:15,760
world is
 

2255
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,510
world is
important i think that this is one way

2256
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:17,520
important i think that this is one way
 

2257
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,790
important i think that this is one way
to break

2258
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:18,800
to break
 

2259
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,790
to break
the correlation versus causation barrier

2260
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:22,800
the correlation versus causation barrier
 

2261
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,829
the correlation versus causation barrier
so this is something which is of a great

2262
00:42:25,829 --> 00:42:25,839
so this is something which is of a great
 

2263
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:27,349
so this is something which is of a great
deal of interest these days i mean

2264
00:42:27,349 --> 00:42:27,359
deal of interest these days i mean
 

2265
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:29,190
deal of interest these days i mean
people like judea pearl have

2266
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:29,200
people like judea pearl have
 

2267
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,230
people like judea pearl have
talked a lot about uh why

2268
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:32,240
talked a lot about uh why
 

2269
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,510
talked a lot about uh why
that we are neglecting causality and he

2270
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:35,520
that we are neglecting causality and he
 

2271
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,630
that we are neglecting causality and he
describes the entire set of successes of

00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,870
describes the entire set of successes of
deep learning as just curve fitting

2274
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:40,880
deep learning as just curve fitting
 

2275
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,069
deep learning as just curve fitting
right because it's uh but i i don't

2276
00:42:44,069 --> 00:42:44,079
right because it's uh but i i don't
 

2277
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:44,790
right because it's uh but i i don't
quite agree

2278
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:44,800
quite agree
 

2279
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,190
quite agree
about as a troublemaker he is but uh

2280
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:47,200
about as a troublemaker he is but uh
 

2281
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,069
about as a troublemaker he is but uh
causality

2282
00:42:48,069 --> 00:42:48,079
causality
 

2283
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:51,750
causality
is important but causality is not

2284
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:51,760
is important but causality is not
 

2285
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,470
is important but causality is not
is not like a single silver bullet it's

2286
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:54,480
is not like a single silver bullet it's
 

2287
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,150
is not like a single silver bullet it's
not like one single principle there are

2288
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:56,160
not like one single principle there are
 

2289
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,390
not like one single principle there are
many different aspects here

2290
00:42:58,390 --> 00:42:58,400
many different aspects here
 

2291
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,430
many different aspects here
and one of the ways in which uh

2292
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:01,440
and one of the ways in which uh
 

2293
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,510
and one of the ways in which uh
one of our most reliable ways of

2294
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:03,520
one of our most reliable ways of
 

2295
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,589
one of our most reliable ways of
establishing causal links and this is

2296
00:43:05,589 --> 00:43:05,599
establishing causal links and this is
 

2297
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,550
establishing causal links and this is
the way

2298
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:06,560
the way
 

2299
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,349
the way
for example the the medical community

2300
00:43:09,349 --> 00:43:09,359
for example the the medical community
 

2301
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:10,630
for example the the medical community
does this is

2302
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:10,640
does this is
 

2303
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,589
does this is
randomized control trials so you have

2304
00:43:13,589 --> 00:43:13,599
randomized control trials so you have
 

2305
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:13,910
randomized control trials so you have
you

2306
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:13,920
you
 

2307
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,230
you
you pick some situation and now in some

2308
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:16,240
you pick some situation and now in some
 

2309
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,390
you pick some situation and now in some
situation you perform an action and

2310
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:18,400
situation you perform an action and
 

2311
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,430
situation you perform an action and
for certain others you don't

2312
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:21,440
for certain others you don't
 

2313
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,349
for certain others you don't
right so so you have a control

2314
00:43:23,349 --> 00:43:23,359
right so so you have a control
 

2315
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:25,589
right so so you have a control
experiment well the child is in fact

2316
00:43:25,589 --> 00:43:25,599
experiment well the child is in fact
 

2317
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,270
experiment well the child is in fact
performing controlled experiments all

2318
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:27,280
performing controlled experiments all
 

2319
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,309
performing controlled experiments all
the time

2320
00:43:28,309 --> 00:43:28,319
the time
 

2321
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:31,109
the time
right right right okay small scale and

2322
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:31,119
right right right okay small scale and
 

2323
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:32,630
right right right okay small scale and
in a small scale and

2324
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:32,640
in a small scale and
 

2325
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:36,230
in a small scale and
but but that is a way that the child

2326
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:36,240
but but that is a way that the child
 

2327
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,589
but but that is a way that the child
gets to

2328
00:43:37,589 --> 00:43:37,599
gets to
 

2329
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,670
gets to
build and refine its causal models of

2330
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:39,680
build and refine its causal models of
 

2331
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,870
build and refine its causal models of
the world

2332
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:40,880
the world
 

2333
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,470
the world
and my colleague alison gopnik has

2334
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:44,480
and my colleague alison gopnik has
 

2335
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,069
and my colleague alison gopnik has
together with a couple of authors

2336
00:43:46,069 --> 00:43:46,079
together with a couple of authors
 

2337
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:47,430
together with a couple of authors
co-authors has this book called the

2338
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:47,440
co-authors has this book called the
 

2339
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,030
co-authors has this book called the
scientist in the crib

2340
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:49,040
scientist in the crib
 

2341
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,230
scientist in the crib
referring to children so i like the part

2342
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:52,240
referring to children so i like the part
 

2343
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,150
referring to children so i like the part
that i like about that is

2344
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:54,160
that i like about that is
 

2345
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:57,670
that i like about that is
the scientist wants to do wants to build

2346
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:57,680
the scientist wants to do wants to build
 

2347
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:58,710
the scientist wants to do wants to build
causal models

2348
00:43:58,710 --> 00:43:58,720
causal models
 

2349
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,470
causal models
and the scientist does control

2350
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:00,480
and the scientist does control
 

2351
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,630
and the scientist does control
experiments and i think the child is

2352
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:02,640
experiments and i think the child is
 

2353
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,589
experiments and i think the child is
doing that

2354
00:44:03,589 --> 00:44:03,599
doing that
 

2355
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,710
doing that
so to enable that we will need to

2356
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:06,720
so to enable that we will need to
 

2357
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,910
so to enable that we will need to
have these these active experiments

2358
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:09,920
have these these active experiments
 

2359
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,950
have these these active experiments
and i think this could be done some in

2360
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:12,960
and i think this could be done some in
 

2361
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,790
and i think this could be done some in
the real world and some in simulation so

2362
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:14,800
the real world and some in simulation so
 

2363
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,790
the real world and some in simulation so
you have hope for simulation

2364
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:16,800
you have hope for simulation
 

2365
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,230
you have hope for simulation
i have a hopeless solution that's an

2366
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:18,240
i have a hopeless solution that's an
 

2367
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,309
i have a hopeless solution that's an
exciting possibility if we can get to

2368
00:44:20,309 --> 00:44:20,319
exciting possibility if we can get to
 

2369
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:22,950
exciting possibility if we can get to
not just photo realistic but what's that

2370
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:22,960
not just photo realistic but what's that
 

2371
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:23,910
not just photo realistic but what's that
called

2372
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:23,920
called
 

2373
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,510
called
life realistic yeah uh simulation

2374
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:27,520
life realistic yeah uh simulation
 

2375
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,630
life realistic yeah uh simulation
so you don't see any fundamental

2376
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:30,640
so you don't see any fundamental
 

2377
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,190
so you don't see any fundamental
blocks to why we can't eventually

2378
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:33,200
blocks to why we can't eventually
 

2379
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,230
blocks to why we can't eventually
simulate

2380
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:34,240
simulate
 

2381
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,710
simulate
the the principles of what it means to

2382
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:36,720
the the principles of what it means to
 

2383
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,150
the the principles of what it means to
exist in the world

2384
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:38,160
exist in the world
 

2385
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,990
exist in the world
as a physical i i don't see any

2386
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:40,000
as a physical i i don't see any
 

2387
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,589
as a physical i i don't see any
fundamental problems there i mean

2388
00:44:41,589 --> 00:44:41,599
fundamental problems there i mean
 

2389
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,990
fundamental problems there i mean
and look the computer graphics community

2390
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:44,000
and look the computer graphics community
 

2391
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:44,950
and look the computer graphics community
has come a long way

2392
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:44,960
has come a long way
 

2393
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,950
has come a long way
right so the in the early days back

2394
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:46,960
right so the in the early days back
 

2395
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,829
right so the in the early days back
going back to the 80s and 90s they were

2396
00:44:49,829 --> 00:44:49,839
going back to the 80s and 90s they were
 

2397
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:52,230
going back to the 80s and 90s they were
they were focusing on visual realism

2398
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:52,240
they were focusing on visual realism
 

2399
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,069
they were focusing on visual realism
right and then they could do the easy

2400
00:44:54,069 --> 00:44:54,079
right and then they could do the easy
 

2401
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:55,829
right and then they could do the easy
stuff but they couldn't do stuff like

2402
00:44:55,829 --> 00:44:55,839
stuff but they couldn't do stuff like
 

2403
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:58,870
stuff but they couldn't do stuff like
hair or fur and so on

2404
00:44:58,870 --> 00:44:58,880
hair or fur and so on
 

2405
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,349
hair or fur and so on
okay well they managed to do that then

2406
00:45:01,349 --> 00:45:01,359
okay well they managed to do that then
 

2407
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:03,430
okay well they managed to do that then
they couldn't do physical

2408
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:03,440
they couldn't do physical
 

2409
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,910
they couldn't do physical
actions right like there's a bowl of

2410
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:05,920
actions right like there's a bowl of
 

2411
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,230
actions right like there's a bowl of
glass and it falls down and it shatters

2412
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:08,240
glass and it falls down and it shatters
 

2413
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,990
glass and it falls down and it shatters
but then they could start to do pretty

2414
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:10,000
but then they could start to do pretty
 

2415
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,309
but then they could start to do pretty
realistic models of that

2416
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:12,319
realistic models of that
 

2417
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,390
realistic models of that
and so on and so forth so the graphics

2418
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:14,400
and so on and so forth so the graphics
 

2419
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,710
and so on and so forth so the graphics
people have shown that they can do

2420
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:16,720
people have shown that they can do
 

2421
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,829
people have shown that they can do
this forward direction not just for

2422
00:45:19,829 --> 00:45:19,839
this forward direction not just for
 

2423
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:21,750
this forward direction not just for
optical interactions but also for

2424
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:21,760
optical interactions but also for
 

2425
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,670
optical interactions but also for
physical interactions

2426
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:23,680
physical interactions
 

2427
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,710
physical interactions
so i think uh of course some of that is

2428
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:26,720
so i think uh of course some of that is
 

2429
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,790
so i think uh of course some of that is
very computer intensive but

2430
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:28,800
very computer intensive but
 

2431
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,309
very computer intensive but
i think by and by we will find ways of

2432
00:45:32,309 --> 00:45:32,319
i think by and by we will find ways of
 

2433
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:35,670
i think by and by we will find ways of
making our models ever more realistic

2434
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:35,680
making our models ever more realistic
 

2435
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,150
making our models ever more realistic
you break vision apart into in one of

2436
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:38,160
you break vision apart into in one of
 

2437
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,109
you break vision apart into in one of
your presentations

2438

dynamics and understanding
 

2443
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,309
dynamics and understanding
and raise a few interesting questions i

2444
00:45:44,309 --> 00:45:44,319
and raise a few interesting questions i
 

2445
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,230
and raise a few interesting questions i
thought i could just throw some

2446
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:46,240
thought i could just throw some
 

2447
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,950
thought i could just throw some
some at you just to see if you want to

2448
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:48,960
some at you just to see if you want to
 

2449
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,150
some at you just to see if you want to
talk about them

2450
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:50,160
talk about them
 

2451
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,190
talk about them
so early vision so it's what is it

2452
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:53,200
so early vision so it's what is it
 

2453
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,790
so early vision so it's what is it
you said um sensation

2454
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:56,800
you said um sensation
 

2455
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,790
you said um sensation
perception and cognition so is this a

2456
00:45:58,790 --> 00:45:58,800
perception and cognition so is this a
 

2457
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,430
perception and cognition so is this a
sensation yes

2458
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:01,440
sensation yes
 

2459
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,349
sensation yes
what can we learn from image statistics

2460
00:46:03,349 --> 00:46:03,359
what can we learn from image statistics
 

2461
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:05,510
what can we learn from image statistics
that we don't already know

2462
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:05,520
that we don't already know
 

2463
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:10,150
that we don't already know
so at the lowest level what um

2464
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:10,160
so at the lowest level what um
 

2465
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,950
so at the lowest level what um
what can we make from just this the the

2466
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:12,960
what can we make from just this the the
 

2467
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,870
what can we make from just this the the
statistic the basics so there were the

2468
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:14,880
statistic the basics so there were the
 

2469
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,630
statistic the basics so there were the
variations in the rock pixels the

2470
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:16,640
variations in the rock pixels the
 

2471
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,950
variations in the rock pixels the
textures and so on

2472
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:18,960
textures and so on
 

2473
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,430
textures and so on
yeah so what we seem to have learned is

2474
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:21,440
yeah so what we seem to have learned is
 

2475
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,630
yeah so what we seem to have learned is
uh

2476
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:22,640
uh
 

2477
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,589
uh
uh uh is that there's a lot of

2478
00:46:25,589 --> 00:46:25,599
uh uh is that there's a lot of
 

2479
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:28,710
uh uh is that there's a lot of
redundancy in these images and

2480
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:28,720
redundancy in these images and
 

2481
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,470
redundancy in these images and
as a result we are able to do a lot of

2482
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:30,480
as a result we are able to do a lot of
 

2483
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,230
as a result we are able to do a lot of
compression

2484
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:32,240
compression
 

2485
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,990
compression
and and this compression is very

2486
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:34,000
and and this compression is very
 

2487
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,790
and and this compression is very
important in biological settings right

2488
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:36,800
important in biological settings right
 

2489
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,950
important in biological settings right
so you might have ten to the eight

2490
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:38,960
so you might have ten to the eight
 

2491
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,109
so you might have ten to the eight
photoreceptors and only ten to the six

2492
00:46:41,109 --> 00:46:41,119
photoreceptors and only ten to the six
 

2493
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:42,870
photoreceptors and only ten to the six
fibers in the optic nerve so you have to

2494
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:42,880
fibers in the optic nerve so you have to
 

2495
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,309
fibers in the optic nerve so you have to
do this compression by

2496
00:46:44,309 --> 00:46:44,319
do this compression by
 

2497
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:47,510
do this compression by
a factor of hundreds to one and

2498
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:47,520
a factor of hundreds to one and
 

2499
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,790
a factor of hundreds to one and
uh and uh so there are analogs of that

2500
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:50,800
uh and uh so there are analogs of that
 

2501
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,790
uh and uh so there are analogs of that
which are happening in

2502
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:52,800
which are happening in
 

2503
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,710
which are happening in
in our neural net artificial neural

2504
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:54,720
in our neural net artificial neural
 

2505
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,150
in our neural net artificial neural
network that's the early layer so you

2506
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:56,160
network that's the early layer so you
 

2507
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,190
network that's the early layer so you
think

2508
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:57,200
think
 

2509
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,589
think
there's a lot of compression that can be

2510
00:46:59,589 --> 00:46:59,599
there's a lot of compression that can be
 

2511
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:00,710
there's a lot of compression that can be
done in the beginning

2512
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:00,720
done in the beginning
 

2513
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,750
done in the beginning
yeah just just the statistics yeah

2514
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:03,760
yeah just just the statistics yeah
 

2515
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,870
yeah just just the statistics yeah
um how much

2516
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:06,880
um how much
 

2517
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,990
um how much
how much well so i mean the the way to

2518
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:10,000
how much well so i mean the the way to
 

2519
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:10,950
how much well so i mean the the way to
think about it is

2520
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:10,960
think about it is
 

2521
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,309
think about it is
just how successful is image compression

2522
00:47:14,309 --> 00:47:14,319
just how successful is image compression
 

2523
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:17,030
just how successful is image compression
right and we we and there are and that's

2524
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:17,040
right and we we and there are and that's
 

2525
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,390
right and we we and there are and that's
been done with

2526
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:18,400
been done with
 

2527
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,470
been done with
older technologies but it can be done

2528
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:20,480
older technologies but it can be done
 

2529
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,790
older technologies but it can be done
with there are

2530
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:22,800
with there are
 

2531
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,109
with there are
several companies which are trying to

2532
00:47:25,109 --> 00:47:25,119
several companies which are trying to
 

2533
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:26,630
several companies which are trying to
use

2534
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:26,640
use
 

2535
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,069
use
sort of these more advanced neural

2536
00:47:28,069 --> 00:47:28,079
sort of these more advanced neural
 

2537
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,390
sort of these more advanced neural
network type techniques for compression

2538
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:30,400
network type techniques for compression
 

2539
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,270
network type techniques for compression
both for static images as well as for

2540
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:33,280
both for static images as well as for
 

2541
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,069
both for static images as well as for
for video

2542
00:47:34,069 --> 00:47:34,079
for video
 

2543
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:37,349
for video
one of my former students has a company

2544
00:47:37,349 --> 00:47:37,359
one of my former students has a company
 

2545
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:39,030
one of my former students has a company
which is trying to do

2546
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:39,040
which is trying to do
 

2547
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,230
which is trying to do
stuff like this and

2548
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:42,240
stuff like this and
 

2549
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,549
stuff like this and
i think i think that they are showing

2550
00:47:44,549 --> 00:47:44,559
i think i think that they are showing
 

2551
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:45,829
i think i think that they are showing
quite

2552
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:45,839
quite
 

2553
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:47,910
quite
interesting results and i think that

2554
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:47,920
interesting results and i think that
 

2555
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:48,950
interesting results and i think that
that's all

2556
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:48,960
that's all
 

2557
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,750
that's all
the success of that's really about image

2558
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:51,760
the success of that's really about image
 

2559
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,670
the success of that's really about image
statistics and video statistics but

2560
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:53,680
statistics and video statistics but
 

2561
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,750
statistics and video statistics but
that's still not doing

2562
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:55,760
that's still not doing
 

2563
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,270
that's still not doing
compression of the kind when i see a

2564
00:47:57,270 --> 00:47:57,280
compression of the kind when i see a
 

2565
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,790
compression of the kind when i see a
picture of a cat

2566
00:47:58,790 --> 00:47:58,800
picture of a cat
 

2567
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,630
picture of a cat
all i have to say is it's a cat that's

2568
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:00,640
all i have to say is it's a cat that's
 

2569
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,549
all i have to say is it's a cat that's
another semantic kind of complication

2570
00:48:02,549 --> 00:48:02,559
another semantic kind of complication
 

2571
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,150
another semantic kind of complication
yeah so this is this is at the lower

2572
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:04,160
yeah so this is this is at the lower
 

2573
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,390
yeah so this is this is at the lower
level right so we are we are we as i

2574
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:06,400
level right so we are we are we as i
 

2575
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,270
level right so we are we are we as i
said yeah

2576
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:07,280
said yeah
 

2577
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,150
said yeah
that's focusing on low level statistics

2578
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:10,160
that's focusing on low level statistics
 

2579
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,630
that's focusing on low level statistics
so to linger on that for a little bit

2580
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:12,640
so to linger on that for a little bit
 

2581
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:16,790
so to linger on that for a little bit
uh you mentioned how far can bottom-up

2582
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:16,800
uh you mentioned how far can bottom-up
 

2583
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,150
uh you mentioned how far can bottom-up
image segmentation go

2584
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:18,160
image segmentation go
 

2585
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,270
image segmentation go
and in general what you mentioned

2586
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:21,280
and in general what you mentioned
 

2587
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,510
and in general what you mentioned
that the central question for scene

2588
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:23,520
that the central question for scene
 

2589
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:24,790
that the central question for scene
understanding is the interplay of

2590
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:24,800
understanding is the interplay of
 

2591
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,870
understanding is the interplay of
bottom-up and top-down information maybe

2592
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:26,880
bottom-up and top-down information maybe
 

2593
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,309
bottom-up and top-down information maybe
this is a good time

2594
00:48:28,309 --> 00:48:28,319
this is a good time
 

2595
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:30,870
this is a good time
to elaborate on that maybe define what

2596
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:30,880
to elaborate on that maybe define what
 

2597
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:31,990
to elaborate on that maybe define what
is

2598
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:32,000
is
 

2599
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,349
is
what is up what is top down

2600
00:48:35,349 --> 00:48:35,359
what is up what is top down
 

2601
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:36,710
what is up what is top down
in the comments yes the computer vision

2602
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:36,720
in the comments yes the computer vision
 

2603
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,109
in the comments yes the computer vision
uh right that's uh

2604
00:48:39,109 --> 00:48:39,119
uh right that's uh
 

2605
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:42,390
uh right that's uh
so today what we have are a are very

2606
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:42,400
so today what we have are a are very
 

2607
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,230
so today what we have are a are very
interesting systems because they work

2608
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:44,240
interesting systems because they work
 

2609
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,910
interesting systems because they work
completely bottom up

2610
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:45,920
completely bottom up
 

2611
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,270
completely bottom up
how are they what does bottom bottom-up

2612
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:47,280
how are they what does bottom bottom-up
 

2613
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,109
how are they what does bottom bottom-up
mean sorry so bottom-up means in this

2614
00:48:49,109 --> 00:48:49,119
mean sorry so bottom-up means in this
 

2615
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:50,870
mean sorry so bottom-up means in this
case means a feed-forward net neural

2616
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:50,880
case means a feed-forward net neural
 

2617
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:51,910
case means a feed-forward net neural
network

2618
00:48:51,910 --> 00:48:51,920
network
 

2619
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,910
network
so starting from the raw pixels yeah

2620
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:53,920
so starting from the raw pixels yeah
 

2621
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,390
so starting from the raw pixels yeah
they start from the raw pixels and they

2622
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:56,400
they start from the raw pixels and they
 

2623
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,870
they start from the raw pixels and they
they end up with some something like cat

2624
00:48:58,870 --> 00:48:58,880
they end up with some something like cat
 

2625
00:48:58,880 --> 00:48:59,750
they end up with some something like cat
or not a cat

2626
00:48:59,750 --> 00:48:59,760
or not a cat
 

2627
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,309
or not a cat
right so our our systems are running

2628
00:49:02,309 --> 00:49:02,319
right so our our systems are running
 

2629
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:04,309
right so our our systems are running
totally feed forward

2630
00:49:04,309 --> 00:49:04,319
totally feed forward
 

2631
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:07,349
totally feed forward
they're trained in a very top-down way

2632
00:49:07,349 --> 00:49:07,359
they're trained in a very top-down way
 

2633
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:09,430
they're trained in a very top-down way
so they're trained by saying okay this

2634
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:09,440
so they're trained by saying okay this
 

2635
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,270
so they're trained by saying okay this
is a cat there's a cat there's a dog

2636
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:11,280
is a cat there's a cat there's a dog
 

2637
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,069
is a cat there's a cat there's a dog
there's a zebra etc

2638
00:49:14,069 --> 00:49:14,079
there's a zebra etc
 

2639
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:17,430
there's a zebra etc
and i'm not happy with either of these

2640
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:17,440
and i'm not happy with either of these
 

2641
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,790
and i'm not happy with either of these
choices fully

2642
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:18,800
choices fully
 

2643
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,670
choices fully
we have gone into uh because we have

2644
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:21,680
we have gone into uh because we have
 

2645
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,309
we have gone into uh because we have
completely separated these processes

2646
00:49:24,309 --> 00:49:24,319
completely separated these processes
 

2647
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:28,069
completely separated these processes
right so there is a so i would like the

2648
00:49:28,069 --> 00:49:28,079
right so there is a so i would like the
 

2649
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:31,510
right so there is a so i would like the
uh the process uh

2650
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:31,520
uh the process uh
 

2651
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,910
uh the process uh
so what do we know compared to biology

2652
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:33,920
so what do we know compared to biology
 

2653
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,470
so what do we know compared to biology
so in biology what we know is that the

2654
00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:36,480
so in biology what we know is that the
 

2655
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,510
so in biology what we know is that the
processes

2656
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:37,520
processes
 

2657
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:41,589
processes
in at test time at run time

2658
00:49:41,589 --> 00:49:41,599
in at test time at run time
 

2659
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:43,589
in at test time at run time
those processes are not purely feed

2660
00:49:43,589 --> 00:49:43,599
those processes are not purely feed
 

2661
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:46,150
those processes are not purely feed
forward but they involve feedback

2662
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:46,160
forward but they involve feedback
 

2663
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,710
forward but they involve feedback
so and they involve much shallower

2664
00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:48,720
so and they involve much shallower
 

2665
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:49,829
so and they involve much shallower
neural networks

2666
00:49:49,829 --> 00:49:49,839
neural networks
 

2667
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:51,589
neural networks
so the kinds of neural networks we are

2668
00:49:51,589 --> 00:49:51,599
so the kinds of neural networks we are
 

2669
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:54,870
so the kinds of neural networks we are
using in computer vision say a resnet 50

2670
00:49:54,870 --> 00:49:54,880
using in computer vision say a resnet 50
 

2671
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,309
using in computer vision say a resnet 50
has 50 layers

2672
00:49:56,309 --> 00:49:56,319
has 50 layers
 

2673
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:58,870
has 50 layers
well in in the brain in the visual

2674
00:49:58,870 --> 00:49:58,880
well in in the brain in the visual
 

2675
00:49:58,880 --> 00:49:59,510
well in in the brain in the visual
cortex

2676
00:49:59,510 --> 00:49:59,520
cortex
 

2677
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:02,230
cortex
going from the retina to it maybe we

2678
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:02,240
going from the retina to it maybe we
 

2679
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,829
going from the retina to it maybe we
have like seven

2680
00:50:03,829 --> 00:50:03,839
have like seven
 

2681
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:06,309
have like seven
right so they're far shallower but we

2682
00:50:06,309 --> 00:50:06,319
right so they're far shallower but we
 

2683
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:08,069
right so they're far shallower but we
have the possibility of feedback so

2684
00:50:08,069 --> 00:50:08,079
have the possibility of feedback so
 

2685
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:10,710
have the possibility of feedback so
there are backward connections

2686
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:10,720
there are backward connections
 

2687
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,990
there are backward connections
and this might enable us to uh

2688
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:14,000
and this might enable us to uh
 

2689
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,870
and this might enable us to uh
to deal with the more ambiguous stimuli

2690
00:50:16,870 --> 00:50:16,880
to deal with the more ambiguous stimuli
 

2691
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,069
to deal with the more ambiguous stimuli
for example

2692
00:50:18,069 --> 00:50:18,079
for example
 

2693
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:21,349
for example
so the the biological solution seems to

2694
00:50:21,349 --> 00:50:21,359
so the the biological solution seems to
 

2695
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:23,109
so the the biological solution seems to
involve feedback

2696
00:50:23,109 --> 00:50:23,119
involve feedback
 

2697
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:26,150
involve feedback
the solution in in artificial

2698
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:26,160
the solution in in artificial
 

2699
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,790
the solution in in artificial
vision seems to be just feed forward but

2700
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:28,800
vision seems to be just feed forward but
 

2701
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,470
vision seems to be just feed forward but
with a much deeper network

2702
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:30,480
with a much deeper network
 

2703
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:33,190
with a much deeper network
and the two are functionally equivalent

2704
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:33,200
and the two are functionally equivalent
 

2705
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,950
and the two are functionally equivalent
because if you have a feedback network

2706
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:34,960
because if you have a feedback network
 

2707
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,549
because if you have a feedback network
which just has like three rounds of

2708
00:50:36,549 --> 00:50:36,559
which just has like three rounds of
 

2709
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:37,349
which just has like three rounds of
feedback

2710
00:50:37,349 --> 00:50:37,359
feedback
 

2711
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:40,069
feedback
you can just unroll it and make it three

2712
00:50:40,069 --> 00:50:40,079
you can just unroll it and make it three
 

2713
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:40,950
you can just unroll it and make it three
times the depth

2714
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:40,960
times the depth
 

2715
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,589
times the depth
and create it in a totally feed forward

2716
00:50:43,589 --> 00:50:43,599
and create it in a totally feed forward
 

2717
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:44,390
and create it in a totally feed forward
way

2718
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:44,400
way
 

2719
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,470
way
so this is something which i mean we

2720
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:46,480
so this is something which i mean we
 

2721
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,150
so this is something which i mean we
have written some papers on this

2722
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:48,160
have written some papers on this
 

2723
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:51,510
have written some papers on this
theme but i really feel that this should

2724
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:51,520
theme but i really feel that this should
 

2725
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:55,109
theme but i really feel that this should
this theme should be pursued further

2726
00:50:55,109 --> 00:50:55,119
this theme should be pursued further
 

2727
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:57,109
this theme should be pursued further
have some kind of recurrence mechanism

2728
00:50:57,109 --> 00:50:57,119
have some kind of recurrence mechanism
 

2729
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:58,309
have some kind of recurrence mechanism
yeah

2730
00:50:58,309 --> 00:50:58,319
yeah
 

2731
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:01,270
yeah
okay the other uh so that so that's uh

2732
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:01,280
okay the other uh so that so that's uh
 

2733
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:01,670
okay the other uh so that so that's uh
so i

2734
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:01,680
so i
 

2735
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,990
so i
so i want to have a little bit more top

2736
00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:04,000
so i want to have a little bit more top
 

2737
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,829
so i want to have a little bit more top
down in the

2738
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:05,839
down in the
 

2739
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:10,150
down in the
at test time okay then at training time

2740
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:10,160
at test time okay then at training time
 

2741
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,990
at test time okay then at training time
we make use of a lot of top-down

2742
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:12,000
we make use of a lot of top-down
 

2743
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,589
we make use of a lot of top-down
knowledge right now

2744
00:51:13,589 --> 00:51:13,599
knowledge right now
 

2745
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:15,910
knowledge right now
so basically to learn to segment an

2746
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:15,920
so basically to learn to segment an
 

2747
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,589
so basically to learn to segment an
object we have to have all these

2748
00:51:17,589 --> 00:51:17,599
object we have to have all these
 

2749
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:20,230
object we have to have all these
examples of this is the boundary of a

2750
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:20,240
examples of this is the boundary of a
 

2751
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,990
examples of this is the boundary of a
cat and this is the boundary of a chair

2752
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:22,000
cat and this is the boundary of a chair
 

2753
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,510
cat and this is the boundary of a chair
and this is the boundary of a horse and

2754
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:23,520
and this is the boundary of a horse and
 

2755
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,190
and this is the boundary of a horse and
so on and this is

2756
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:25,200
so on and this is
 

2757
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:29,190
so on and this is
too much top-down knowledge how do

2758
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:29,200
too much top-down knowledge how do
 

2759
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:32,309
too much top-down knowledge how do
humans do this we manage to we manage

2760
00:51:32,309 --> 00:51:32,319
humans do this we manage to we manage
 

2761
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:34,069
humans do this we manage to we manage
with far less supervision

2762
00:51:34,069 --> 00:51:34,079
with far less supervision
 

2763
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:36,309
with far less supervision
and we do it in a sort of bottom-up way

2764
00:51:36,309 --> 00:51:36,319
and we do it in a sort of bottom-up way
 

2765
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:37,990
and we do it in a sort of bottom-up way
because for example

2766
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:38,000
because for example
 

2767
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,630
because for example
we're looking at a video stream and the

2768
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:40,640
we're looking at a video stream and the
 

2769
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,309
we're looking at a video stream and the
horse moves

2770
00:51:42,309 --> 00:51:42,319
horse moves
 

2771
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:45,190
horse moves
and that enables me to say that all

2772
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:45,200
and that enables me to say that all
 

2773
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,870
and that enables me to say that all
these pixels are together

2774
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:46,880
these pixels are together
 

2775
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,190
these pixels are together
yeah so the gestural psychologists used

2776
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:49,200
yeah so the gestural psychologists used
 

2777
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,150
yeah so the gestural psychologists used
to call this

2778
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:50,160
to call this
 

2779
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,270
to call this
the principle of common fate so there

2780
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:53,280
the principle of common fate so there
 

2781
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,549
the principle of common fate so there
was a bottom-up

2782
00:51:54,549 --> 00:51:54,559
was a bottom-up
 

2783
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:56,790
was a bottom-up
process by which we were able to segment

2784
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:56,800
process by which we were able to segment
 

2785
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,230
process by which we were able to segment
out these objects

2786
00:51:58,230 --> 00:51:58,240
out these objects
 

2787
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,910
out these objects
and we have totally focused on this

2788
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:01,920
and we have totally focused on this
 

2789
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,309
and we have totally focused on this
top-down training signal

2790
00:52:04,309 --> 00:52:04,319
top-down training signal
 

2791
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:07,349
top-down training signal
so in my view we have currently solved

2792
00:52:07,349 --> 00:52:07,359
so in my view we have currently solved
 

2793
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:07,670
so in my view we have currently solved
it

2794
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:07,680
it
 

2795
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,589
it
in machine vision this top-down

2796
00:52:09,589 --> 00:52:09,599
in machine vision this top-down
 

2797
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:12,470
in machine vision this top-down
bottom-up interaction

2798
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:12,480
bottom-up interaction
 

2799
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,390
bottom-up interaction
but i don't find the solution fully

2800
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:14,400
but i don't find the solution fully
 

2801
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,990
but i don't find the solution fully
satisfactory

2802
00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:16,000
satisfactory
 

2803
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,950
satisfactory
and i would rather have a bit of both in

2804
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:18,960
and i would rather have a bit of both in
 

2805
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:19,990
and i would rather have a bit of both in
at both stages

2806
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:20,000
at both stages
 

2807
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,390
at both stages
for all computer vision problems which

2808
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:22,400
for all computer vision problems which
 

2809
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,990
for all computer vision problems which
is not just segmentation

2810
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:24,000
is not just segmentation
 

2811
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,069
is not just segmentation
and and and and the question that you

2812
00:52:26,069 --> 00:52:26,079
and and and and the question that you
 

2813
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:27,109
and and and and the question that you
can ask is

2814
00:52:27,109 --> 00:52:27,119
can ask is
 

2815
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:29,910
can ask is
so for me i'm inspired a lot by human

2816
00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:29,920
so for me i'm inspired a lot by human
 

2817
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,670
so for me i'm inspired a lot by human
vision and i care about that

2818
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:31,680
vision and i care about that
 

2819
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,589
vision and i care about that
you could be a just a hard-boiled

2820
00:52:33,589 --> 00:52:33,599
you could be a just a hard-boiled
 

2821
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:35,349
you could be a just a hard-boiled
engineer not give a damn

2822
00:52:35,349 --> 00:52:35,359
engineer not give a damn
 

2823
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:38,630
engineer not give a damn
so to you i would then argue that uh you

2824
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:38,640
so to you i would then argue that uh you
 

2825
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,390
so to you i would then argue that uh you
would need far less training data

2826
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:40,400
would need far less training data
 

2827
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:45,030
would need far less training data
if you could make my uh research agenda

2828
00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:45,040
if you could make my uh research agenda
 

2829
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:48,790
if you could make my uh research agenda
you know fruitful okay so

2830
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:48,800
you know fruitful okay so
 

2831
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,510
you know fruitful okay so
maybe taking a step into uh segmentation

2832
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:51,520
maybe taking a step into uh segmentation
 

2833
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,829
maybe taking a step into uh segmentation
static scene understanding

2834
00:52:53,829 --> 00:52:53,839
static scene understanding
 

2835
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:55,109
static scene understanding
what is the interaction between

2836
00:52:55,109 --> 00:52:55,119
what is the interaction between
 

2837
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:57,190
what is the interaction between
segmentation and recognition

2838
00:52:57,190 --> 00:52:57,200
segmentation and recognition
 

2839
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:00,549
segmentation and recognition
you mentioned the movement of objects

2840
00:53:00,549 --> 00:53:00,559
you mentioned the movement of objects
 

2841
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:02,470
you mentioned the movement of objects
so for people who don't know computer

2842
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:02,480
so for people who don't know computer
 

2843
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,670
so for people who don't know computer
vision

2844
00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:03,680
vision
 

2845
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,309
vision
segmentation is this weird activity that

2846
00:53:06,309 --> 00:53:06,319
segmentation is this weird activity that
 

2847
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:07,109
segmentation is this weird activity that
we

2848
00:53:07,109 --> 00:53:07,119
we
 

2849
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:08,630
we
that computer vision folks have all

2850
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:08,640
that computer vision folks have all
 

2851
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,630
that computer vision folks have all
agreed is very important

2852
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:10,640
agreed is very important
 

2853
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:14,150
agreed is very important
uh of drawing outlines around objects

2854
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:14,160
uh of drawing outlines around objects
 

2855
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:17,829
uh of drawing outlines around objects
versus a bounding box or

2856
00:53:17,829 --> 00:53:17,839
versus a bounding box or
 

2857
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:21,109
versus a bounding box or
and then classifying that object

2858
00:53:21,109 --> 00:53:21,119
and then classifying that object
 

2859
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:23,430
and then classifying that object
what's what's the value of segmentation

2860
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:23,440
what's what's the value of segmentation
 

2861
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,549
what's what's the value of segmentation
what is it

2862
00:53:24,549 --> 00:53:24,559
what is it
 

2863
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:27,430
what is it
as a problem in computer vision how is

2864
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:27,440
as a problem in computer vision how is
 

2865
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,349
as a problem in computer vision how is
it fundamentally different from

2866
00:53:29,349 --> 00:53:29,359
it fundamentally different from
 

2867
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:31,270
it fundamentally different from
detection recognition any other problems

2868
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:31,280
detection recognition any other problems
 

2869
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,630
detection recognition any other problems
yeah so i think

2870
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:32,640
yeah so i think
 

2871
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:36,069
yeah so i think
uh so so segmentation

2872
00:53:36,069 --> 00:53:36,079
uh so so segmentation
 

2873
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:39,589
uh so so segmentation
enables us to say that

2874
00:53:39,589 --> 00:53:39,599
enables us to say that
 

2875
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:42,790
enables us to say that
some set of pixels are an object without

2876
00:53:42,790 --> 00:53:42,800
some set of pixels are an object without
 

2877
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,270
some set of pixels are an object without
necessarily even being able to name that

2878
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:45,280
necessarily even being able to name that
 

2879
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,109
necessarily even being able to name that
object or knowing properties of that

2880
00:53:47,109 --> 00:53:47,119
object or knowing properties of that
 

2881
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:47,829
object or knowing properties of that
object

2882
00:53:47,829 --> 00:53:47,839
object
 

2883
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:51,109
object
oh so you mean segmentation purely as

2884
00:53:51,109 --> 00:53:51,119
oh so you mean segmentation purely as
 

2885
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:54,710
oh so you mean segmentation purely as
as as the act of separating an object

2886
00:53:54,710 --> 00:53:54,720
as as the act of separating an object
 

2887
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:58,230
as as the act of separating an object
from its background a blob of uh

2888
00:53:58,230 --> 00:53:58,240
from its background a blob of uh
 

2889
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,549
from its background a blob of uh
of that's united in some way from his

2890
00:54:00,549 --> 00:54:00,559
of that's united in some way from his
 

2891
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:02,790
of that's united in some way from his
background yeah so identification if you

2892
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:02,800
background yeah so identification if you
 

2893
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:03,190
background yeah so identification if you
were

2894
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:03,200
were
 

2895
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,950
were
making an entity out of it and

2896
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:04,960
making an entity out of it and
 

2897
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,349
making an entity out of it and
justification yeah beautifully

2898
00:54:07,349 --> 00:54:07,359
justification yeah beautifully
 

2899
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:10,549
justification yeah beautifully
so so i think that we have that

2900
00:54:10,549 --> 00:54:10,559
so so i think that we have that
 

2901
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:11,430
so so i think that we have that
capability

2902
00:54:11,430 --> 00:54:11,440
capability
 

2903
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:14,950
capability
and that is that enables us

2904
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:14,960
and that is that enables us
 

2905
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:18,069
and that is that enables us
to uh as we are growing up to

2906
00:54:18,069 --> 00:54:18,079
to uh as we are growing up to
 

2907
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:21,750
to uh as we are growing up to
acquire uh names of objects

2908
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:21,760
acquire uh names of objects
 

2909
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,069
acquire uh names of objects
with very little supervision so suppose

2910
00:54:24,069 --> 00:54:24,079
with very little supervision so suppose
 

2911
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:24,870
with very little supervision so suppose
the child

2912
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:24,880
the child
 

2913
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,790
the child
lets posit that the child has this

2914
00:54:26,790 --> 00:54:26,800
lets posit that the child has this
 

2915
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,230
lets posit that the child has this
ability to separate out

2916
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:28,240
ability to separate out
 

2917
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:31,030
ability to separate out
objects in the world then when the

2918
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:31,040
objects in the world then when the
 

2919
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:31,829
objects in the world then when the
there's a

2920
00:54:31,829 --> 00:54:31,839
there's a
 

2921
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:36,309
there's a
the mother says pick up your bottle or

2922
00:54:36,309 --> 00:54:36,319
the mother says pick up your bottle or
 

2923
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:38,510
the mother says pick up your bottle or
the cat's behaving funny today

2924
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:38,520
the cat's behaving funny today
 

2925
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:41,030
the cat's behaving funny today
[Laughter]

2926
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:41,040
[Laughter]
 

2927
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:44,069
[Laughter]
the word cat suggests some object and

2928
00:54:44,069 --> 00:54:44,079
the word cat suggests some object and
 

2929
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:46,150
the word cat suggests some object and
then the child sort of does the mapping

2930
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:46,160
then the child sort of does the mapping
 

2931
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,710
then the child sort of does the mapping
right right the mother doesn't have to

2932
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:48,720
right right the mother doesn't have to
 

2933
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,150
right right the mother doesn't have to
teach

2934
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:50,160
teach
 

2935
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,870
teach
a specific object labels by pointing to

2936
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:52,880
a specific object labels by pointing to
 

2937
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,710
a specific object labels by pointing to
them

2938
00:54:54,710 --> 00:54:54,720
them
 

2939
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:57,670
them
weak supervision works in the context

2940
00:54:57,670 --> 00:54:57,680
weak supervision works in the context
 

2941
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:58,789
weak supervision works in the context
that you have

2942
00:54:58,789 --> 00:54:58,799
that you have
 

2943
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:01,990
that you have
the ability to create objects so

2944
00:55:01,990 --> 00:55:02,000
the ability to create objects so
 

2945
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,109
the ability to create objects so
i think that uh so to me that's that's a

2946
00:55:05,109 --> 00:55:05,119
i think that uh so to me that's that's a
 

2947
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:07,270
i think that uh so to me that's that's a
very fundamental capability

2948
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:07,280
very fundamental capability
 

2949
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,270
very fundamental capability
uh there are applications where this is

2950
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:09,280
uh there are applications where this is
 

2951
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,870
uh there are applications where this is
very important uh

2952
00:55:10,870 --> 00:55:10,880
very important uh
 

2953
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,190
very important uh
for example medical diagnosis so in

2954
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:13,200
for example medical diagnosis so in
 

2955
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,950
for example medical diagnosis so in
medical diagnosis

2956
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:14,960
medical diagnosis
 

2957
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,990
medical diagnosis
uh you have some uh brain scan i mean

2958
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:18,000
uh you have some uh brain scan i mean
 

2959
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:18,549
uh you have some uh brain scan i mean
some

2960
00:55:18,549 --> 00:55:18,559
some
 

2961
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:20,470
some
this is some work that we did in my

2962
00:55:20,470 --> 00:55:20,480
this is some work that we did in my
 

2963
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:23,030
this is some work that we did in my
group where you have ct scans of people

2964
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:23,040
group where you have ct scans of people
 

2965
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:23,829
group where you have ct scans of people
who have

2966
00:55:23,829 --> 00:55:23,839
who have
 

2967
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:26,710
who have
had traumatic brain injury and what uh

2968
00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:26,720
had traumatic brain injury and what uh
 

2969
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,870
had traumatic brain injury and what uh
what the radiologist needs to do is to

2970
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:28,880
what the radiologist needs to do is to
 

2971
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,589
what the radiologist needs to do is to
precisely delineate various

2972
00:55:31,589 --> 00:55:31,599
precisely delineate various
 

2973
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:34,870
precisely delineate various
places where there might be bleeds for

2974
00:55:34,870 --> 00:55:34,880
places where there might be bleeds for
 

2975
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,069
places where there might be bleeds for
example

2976
00:55:36,069 --> 00:55:36,079
example
 

2977
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:38,870
example
and there's there are clear needs like

2978
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:38,880
and there's there are clear needs like
 

2979
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:39,589
and there's there are clear needs like
that

2980
00:55:39,589 --> 00:55:39,599
that
 

2981
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:42,549
that
so they're certainly very practical

2982
00:55:42,549 --> 00:55:42,559
so they're certainly very practical
 

2983
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:44,390
so they're certainly very practical
applications of computer vision where

2984
00:55:44,390 --> 00:55:44,400
applications of computer vision where
 

2985
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,069
applications of computer vision where
segmentation is necessary

2986
00:55:46,069 --> 00:55:46,079
segmentation is necessary
 

2987
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:49,589
segmentation is necessary
but philosophically segmentation

2988
00:55:49,589 --> 00:55:49,599
but philosophically segmentation
 

2989
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:52,630
but philosophically segmentation
enables the task of recognition

2990
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:52,640
enables the task of recognition
 

2991
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:55,990
enables the task of recognition
to proceed with much weaker supervision

2992
00:55:55,990 --> 00:55:56,000
to proceed with much weaker supervision
 

2993
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,750
to proceed with much weaker supervision
than we require today

2994
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:57,760
than we require today
 

2995
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,349
than we require today
and you think of segmentation as this

2996
00:55:59,349 --> 00:55:59,359
and you think of segmentation as this
 

2997
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:01,990
and you think of segmentation as this
kind of task that takes on

2998
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:02,000
kind of task that takes on
 

2999
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,190
kind of task that takes on
a visual scene and breaks it apart

3000
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:05,200
a visual scene and breaks it apart
 

3001
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:08,470
a visual scene and breaks it apart
into into interesting entities yeah

3002
00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:08,480
into into interesting entities yeah
 

3003
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,390
into into interesting entities yeah
that might be useful for whatever the

3004
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:10,400
that might be useful for whatever the
 

3005
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,549
that might be useful for whatever the
task is yeah

3006
00:56:12,549 --> 00:56:12,559
task is yeah
 

3007
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:14,950
task is yeah
and and it is not semantics free so i

3008
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:14,960
and and it is not semantics free so i
 

3009
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:15,990
and and it is not semantics free so i
think i

3010
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:16,000
think i
 

3011
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,990
think i
i mean it it blends into it involves

3012
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:20,000
i mean it it blends into it involves
 

3013
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,270
i mean it it blends into it involves
perception and cognition it is not it is

3014
00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:23,280
perception and cognition it is not it is
 

3015
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:23,750
perception and cognition it is not it is
not

3016
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:23,760
not
 

3017
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,230
not
i i think the mistake that we used to

3018
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:26,240
i i think the mistake that we used to
 

3019
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:27,750
i i think the mistake that we used to
make in the early days of computer

3020
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:27,760
make in the early days of computer
 

3021
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:28,390
make in the early days of computer
vision

3022
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:28,400
vision
 

3023
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,270
vision
was to treat it as a purely bottom-up

3024
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:31,280
was to treat it as a purely bottom-up
 

3025
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:34,549
was to treat it as a purely bottom-up
perceptual task it is not just that

3026
00:56:34,549 --> 00:56:34,559
perceptual task it is not just that
 

3027
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:38,870
perceptual task it is not just that
because we do revise our notion of

3028
00:56:38,870 --> 00:56:38,880
because we do revise our notion of
 

3029
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,510
because we do revise our notion of
segmentation with more experience right

3030
00:56:41,510 --> 00:56:41,520
segmentation with more experience right
 

3031
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,230
segmentation with more experience right
because

3032
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:42,240
because
 

3033
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,750
because
for example there are objects which are

3034
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:43,760
for example there are objects which are
 

3035
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,430
for example there are objects which are
non-rigid like animals

3036
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:45,440
non-rigid like animals
 

3037
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:49,430
non-rigid like animals
or humans and uh i think

3038
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:49,440
or humans and uh i think
 

3039
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,349
or humans and uh i think
understanding that all the pixels of a

3040
00:56:51,349 --> 00:56:51,359
understanding that all the pixels of a
 

3041
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:53,349
understanding that all the pixels of a
human are one entity is actually quite a

3042
00:56:53,349 --> 00:56:53,359
human are one entity is actually quite a
 

3043
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:54,150
human are one entity is actually quite a
challenge

3044
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:54,160
challenge
 

3045
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:57,109
challenge
because the parts of the human they can

3046
00:56:57,109 --> 00:56:57,119
because the parts of the human they can
 

3047
00:56:57,119 --> 00:56:58,710
because the parts of the human they can
move independently

3048
00:56:58,710 --> 00:56:58,720
move independently
 

3049
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,950
move independently
and the human wears clothes so they

3050
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:00,960
and the human wears clothes so they
 

3051
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,549
and the human wears clothes so they
might be differently colored

3052
00:57:02,549 --> 00:57:02,559
might be differently colored
 

3053
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:05,510
might be differently colored
so it's all sort of a challenge you

3054
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:05,520
so it's all sort of a challenge you
 

3055
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,109
so it's all sort of a challenge you
mentioned the three hours of computer

3056
00:57:07,109 --> 00:57:07,119
mentioned the three hours of computer
 

3057
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:07,910
mentioned the three hours of computer
vision

3058
00:57:07,910 --> 00:57:07,920
vision
 

3059
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,829
vision
are recognition reconstruction

3060
00:57:10,829 --> 00:57:10,839
are recognition reconstruction
 

3061
00:57:10,839 --> 00:57:11,990
are recognition reconstruction
reorganization

3062
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:12,000
reorganization
 

3063
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,309
reorganization
can you describe these three r's sure

3064
00:57:14,309 --> 00:57:14,319
can you describe these three r's sure
 

3065
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:15,270
can you describe these three r's sure
how they interact

3066
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:15,280
how they interact
 

3067
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:19,030
how they interact
yeah so uh so recognition is the easiest

3068
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:19,040
yeah so uh so recognition is the easiest
 

3069
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:19,510
yeah so uh so recognition is the easiest
one

3070
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:19,520
one
 

3071
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:22,789
one
because that's uh what i think

3072
00:57:22,789 --> 00:57:22,799
because that's uh what i think
 

3073
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:25,030
because that's uh what i think
people generally think of as computer

3074
00:57:25,030 --> 00:57:25,040
people generally think of as computer
 

3075
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,630
people generally think of as computer
vision

3076
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:26,640
vision
 

3077
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:30,309
vision
achieving these days which is uh labels

3078
00:57:30,309 --> 00:57:30,319
achieving these days which is uh labels
 

3079
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:34,230
achieving these days which is uh labels
so is this a cat is this a dog is this a

3080
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:34,240
so is this a cat is this a dog is this a
 

3081
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,870
so is this a cat is this a dog is this a
chihuahua i mean you know it could be

3082
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:36,880
chihuahua i mean you know it could be
 

3083
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,470
chihuahua i mean you know it could be
very fine grain like

3084
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:38,480
very fine grain like
 

3085
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,190
very fine grain like
you know specific breed of a dog or a

3086
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:41,200
you know specific breed of a dog or a
 

3087
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,349
you know specific breed of a dog or a
specific species or bird

3088
00:57:43,349 --> 00:57:43,359
specific species or bird
 

3089
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:46,789
specific species or bird
or it could be very abstract like animal

3090
00:57:46,789 --> 00:57:46,799
or it could be very abstract like animal
 

3091
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:49,430
or it could be very abstract like animal
but given a part of an image or a whole

3092
00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:49,440
but given a part of an image or a whole
 

3093
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:50,309
but given a part of an image or a whole
image say

3094
00:57:50,309 --> 00:57:50,319
image say
 

3095
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:53,030
image say
put a label on that yeah so that's

3096
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:53,040
put a label on that yeah so that's
 

3097
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,470
put a label on that yeah so that's
that's recognition

3098
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:54,480
that's recognition
 

3099
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:58,069
that's recognition
reconstruction is uh

3100
00:57:58,069 --> 00:57:58,079
reconstruction is uh
 

3101
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:01,829
reconstruction is uh
essentially it you can think of it as

3102
00:58:01,829 --> 00:58:01,839
essentially it you can think of it as
 

3103
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:02,710
essentially it you can think of it as
inverse

3104
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:02,720
inverse
 

3105
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,910
inverse
graphics i mean that's one way

3106
00:58:05,910 --> 00:58:05,920
graphics i mean that's one way
 

3107
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:08,710
graphics i mean that's one way
to think about it so graphics is your

3108
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:08,720
to think about it so graphics is your
 

3109
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,309
to think about it so graphics is your
you have some internal computer

3110
00:58:10,309 --> 00:58:10,319
you have some internal computer
 

3111
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:11,990
you have some internal computer
representation

3112
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:12,000
representation
 

3113
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,990
representation
and uh you have a computer

3114
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:14,000
and uh you have a computer
 

3115
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,150
and uh you have a computer
representation of some objects arranged

3116
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:16,160
representation of some objects arranged
 

3117
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,190
representation of some objects arranged
in a scene

3118
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:17,200
in a scene
 

3119
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,910
in a scene
and what you do is you produce a picture

3120
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:19,920
and what you do is you produce a picture
 

3121
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:22,069
and what you do is you produce a picture
you produce the pixels corresponding to

3122
00:58:22,069 --> 00:58:22,079
you produce the pixels corresponding to
 

3123
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:24,390
you produce the pixels corresponding to
a rendering of that scene

3124
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:24,400
a rendering of that scene
 

3125
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,670
a rendering of that scene
so uh so let's

3126
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:27,680
so uh so let's
 

3127
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,430
so uh so let's
do the inverse of this we are given an

3128
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:29,440
do the inverse of this we are given an
 

3129
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,910
do the inverse of this we are given an
image and we try to

3130
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:31,920
image and we try to
 

3131
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:35,349
image and we try to
we we we say oh this image

3132
00:58:35,349 --> 00:58:35,359
we we we say oh this image
 

3133
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:39,349
we we we say oh this image
arises from some objects in a scene

3134
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:39,359
arises from some objects in a scene
 

3135
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:41,030
arises from some objects in a scene
looked at with a camera from this

3136
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:41,040
looked at with a camera from this
 

3137
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,710
looked at with a camera from this
viewpoint and we might have more

3138
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:42,720
viewpoint and we might have more
 

3139
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,270
viewpoint and we might have more
information about the objects like their

3140
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:45,280
information about the objects like their
 

3141
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:48,630
information about the objects like their
shape maybe their textures maybe

3142
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:48,640
shape maybe their textures maybe
 

3143
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,670
shape maybe their textures maybe
you know color et cetera et cetera so

3144
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:51,680
you know color et cetera et cetera so
 

3145
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,430
you know color et cetera et cetera so
that's the reconstruction problem in a

3146
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:53,440
that's the reconstruction problem in a
 

3147
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,630
that's the reconstruction problem in a
way

3148
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:54,640
way
 

3149
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:57,829
way
that you are in your head creating a

3150
00:58:57,829 --> 00:58:57,839
that you are in your head creating a
 

3151
00:58:57,839 --> 00:59:01,349
that you are in your head creating a
model of the external world

3152
00:59:01,349 --> 00:59:01,359
model of the external world
 

3153
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:04,710
model of the external world
okay reorganization is to do with

3154
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:04,720
okay reorganization is to do with
 

3155
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:08,390
okay reorganization is to do with
essentially finding these entities so

3156
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:08,400
essentially finding these entities so
 

3157
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:12,309
essentially finding these entities so
uh so it's uh organization or

3158
00:59:12,309 --> 00:59:12,319
uh so it's uh organization or
 

3159
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:15,430
uh so it's uh organization or
the word organization implies structure

3160
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:15,440
the word organization implies structure
 

3161
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:18,870
the word organization implies structure
so uh that in in uh perception

3162
00:59:18,870 --> 00:59:18,880
so uh that in in uh perception
 

3163
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:21,270
so uh that in in uh perception
in psychology we use the term perceptual

3164
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:21,280
in psychology we use the term perceptual
 

3165
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,549
in psychology we use the term perceptual
organization

3166
00:59:22,549 --> 00:59:22,559
organization
 

3167
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:26,309
organization
that uh the the world is not just

3168
00:59:26,309 --> 00:59:26,319
that uh the the world is not just
 

3169
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:29,750
that uh the the world is not just
an image is not just seen as is not

3170
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:29,760
an image is not just seen as is not
 

3171
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,430
an image is not just seen as is not
internally represented as just a

3172
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:31,440
internally represented as just a
 

3173
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,430
internally represented as just a
collection of pixels but we

3174
00:59:33,430 --> 00:59:33,440
collection of pixels but we
 

3175
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,990
collection of pixels but we
make these entities we create these

3176
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:36,000
make these entities we create these
 

3177
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:36,630
make these entities we create these
entities

3178
00:59:36,630 --> 00:59:36,640
entities
 

3179
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:38,230
entities
objects whatever you want to call in the

3180
00:59:38,230 --> 00:59:38,240
objects whatever you want to call in the
 

3181
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:39,750
objects whatever you want to call in the
relationship between the entities as

3182
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:39,760
relationship between the entities as
 

3183
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:42,230
relationship between the entities as
well or is it purely about the entities

3184
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:42,240
well or is it purely about the entities
 

3185
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,390
well or is it purely about the entities
it could be about the relationships but

3186
00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:44,400
it could be about the relationships but
 

3187
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,069
it could be about the relationships but
mainly we focus on the fact that there

3188
00:59:46,069 --> 00:59:46,079
mainly we focus on the fact that there
 

3189
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:47,589
mainly we focus on the fact that there
are entities

3190
00:59:47,589 --> 00:59:47,599
are entities
 

3191
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:50,150
are entities
sometimes i'm trying to pinpoint what

3192
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:50,160
sometimes i'm trying to pinpoint what
 

3193
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,230
sometimes i'm trying to pinpoint what
the organization means

3194
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:52,240
the organization means
 

3195
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,950
the organization means
so organization is that instead of like

3196
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:54,960
so organization is that instead of like
 

3197
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:55,589
so organization is that instead of like
a

3198
00:59:55,589 --> 00:59:55,599
a
 

3199
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:59,910
a
uniform grid we have the structure of

3200
00:59:59,910 --> 00:59:59,920
uniform grid we have the structure of
 

3201
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,910
uniform grid we have the structure of
objects

3202
01:00:01,910 --> 01:00:01,920
objects
 

3203
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:05,190
objects
so segmentation is a small part of that

3204
01:00:05,190 --> 01:00:05,200
so segmentation is a small part of that
 

3205
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,910
so segmentation is a small part of that
so segmentation gets us going towards

3206
01:00:07,910 --> 01:00:07,920
so segmentation gets us going towards
 

3207
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:08,230
so segmentation gets us going towards
that

3208
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:08,240
that
 

3209
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:11,589
that
yeah and you kind of have this triangle

3210
01:00:11,589 --> 01:00:11,599
yeah and you kind of have this triangle
 

3211
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:13,430
yeah and you kind of have this triangle
where they all interact together

3212
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:13,440
where they all interact together
 

3213
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:17,109
where they all interact together
yes so how do you see that interaction

3214
01:00:17,109 --> 01:00:17,119
yes so how do you see that interaction
 

3215
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:20,510
yes so how do you see that interaction
in uh sort of uh

3216
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:20,520
in uh sort of uh
 

3217
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:23,109
in uh sort of uh
reorganization is yes defining the

3218
01:00:23,109 --> 01:00:23,119
reorganization is yes defining the
 

3219
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,030
reorganization is yes defining the
entities in the world

3220
01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:25,040
entities in the world
 

3221
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:28,069
entities in the world
the recognition is labeling those

3222
01:00:28,069 --> 01:00:28,079
the recognition is labeling those
 

3223
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:29,910
the recognition is labeling those
entities

3224
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:29,920
entities
 

3225
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:32,549
entities
and then reconstruction is what filling

3226
01:00:32,549 --> 01:00:32,559
and then reconstruction is what filling
 

3227
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:33,829
and then reconstruction is what filling
in the gaps

3228
01:00:33,829 --> 01:00:33,839
in the gaps
 

3229
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:37,270
in the gaps
well to for example see

3230
01:00:37,270 --> 01:00:37,280
well to for example see
 

3231
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:40,710
well to for example see
impute some 3d objects corresponding to

3232
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:40,720
impute some 3d objects corresponding to
 

3233
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:41,670
impute some 3d objects corresponding to
each of these

3234
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:41,680
each of these
 

3235
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,630
each of these
entities that would be part of adding

3236
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:44,640
entities that would be part of adding
 

3237
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,390
entities that would be part of adding
more information that's not

3238
01:00:46,390 --> 01:00:46,400
more information that's not
 

3239
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,430
more information that's not
there in the raw data correct

3240
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:49,440
there in the raw data correct
 

3241
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:53,430
there in the raw data correct
i mean i started pushing this kind of a

3242
01:00:53,430 --> 01:00:53,440
i mean i started pushing this kind of a
 

3243
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:56,870
i mean i started pushing this kind of a
view in the around 2010 or something

3244
01:00:56,870 --> 01:00:56,880
view in the around 2010 or something
 

3245
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:57,910
view in the around 2010 or something
like that

3246
01:00:57,910 --> 01:00:57,920
like that
 

3247
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:00,870
like that
because at that time in computer vision

3248
01:01:00,870 --> 01:01:00,880
because at that time in computer vision
 

3249
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,150
because at that time in computer vision
the distinction that

3250
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:02,160
the distinction that
 

3251
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:05,910
the distinction that
people were were just

3252
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:05,920
people were were just
 

3253
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:08,470
people were were just
working on many different problems but

3254
01:01:08,470 --> 01:01:08,480
working on many different problems but
 

3255
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,390
working on many different problems but
they treated each of them as a separate

3256
01:01:10,390 --> 01:01:10,400
they treated each of them as a separate
 

3257
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,109
they treated each of them as a separate
isolated problem with each with its own

3258
01:01:13,109 --> 01:01:13,119
isolated problem with each with its own
 

3259
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:15,030
isolated problem with each with its own
data set and then you try to solve that

3260
01:01:15,030 --> 01:01:15,040
data set and then you try to solve that
 

3261
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,870
data set and then you try to solve that
and get good numbers on it

3262
01:01:16,870 --> 01:01:16,880
and get good numbers on it
 

3263
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,430
and get good numbers on it
so i wasn't i didn't like that approach

3264
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:19,440
so i wasn't i didn't like that approach
 

3265
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,349
so i wasn't i didn't like that approach
because i wanted to see

3266
01:01:21,349 --> 01:01:21,359
because i wanted to see
 

3267
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:24,470
because i wanted to see
the connection between these and

3268
01:01:24,470 --> 01:01:24,480
the connection between these and
 

3269
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:28,710
the connection between these and
if people divided up vision into

3270
01:01:28,710 --> 01:01:28,720
if people divided up vision into
 

3271
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,309
if people divided up vision into
into various modules the way they would

3272
01:01:30,309 --> 01:01:30,319
into various modules the way they would
 

3273
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:32,390
into various modules the way they would
do it is as low level mid-level and

3274
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:32,400
do it is as low level mid-level and
 

3275
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,309
do it is as low level mid-level and
high-level vision

3276
01:01:34,309 --> 01:01:34,319
high-level vision
 

3277
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:35,589
high-level vision
corresponding roughly to the

3278
01:01:35,589 --> 01:01:35,599
corresponding roughly to the
 

3279
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:37,750
corresponding roughly to the
psychologist's notion of sensation

3280
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:37,760
psychologist's notion of sensation
 

3281
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,910
psychologist's notion of sensation
perception and cognition

3282
01:01:39,910 --> 01:01:39,920
perception and cognition
 

3283
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:43,349
perception and cognition
and i didn't that didn't map to tasks

3284
01:01:43,349 --> 01:01:43,359
and i didn't that didn't map to tasks
 

3285
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:45,349
and i didn't that didn't map to tasks
that people cared about

3286
01:01:45,349 --> 01:01:45,359
that people cared about
 

3287
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:48,390
that people cared about
okay so therefore i tried to promote

3288
01:01:48,390 --> 01:01:48,400
okay so therefore i tried to promote
 

3289
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,150
okay so therefore i tried to promote
this particular framework

3290
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:50,160
this particular framework
 

3291
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,309
this particular framework
as a way of considering the problems

3292
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:52,319
as a way of considering the problems
 

3293
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:53,910
as a way of considering the problems
that people in computer vision were

3294
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:53,920
that people in computer vision were
 

3295
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,430
that people in computer vision were
actually working on

3296
01:01:55,430 --> 01:01:55,440
actually working on
 

3297
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:58,549
actually working on
and trying to be more explicit about the

3298
01:01:58,549 --> 01:01:58,559
and trying to be more explicit about the
 

3299
01:01:58,559 --> 01:01:59,750
and trying to be more explicit about the
fact that they actually

3300
01:01:59,750 --> 01:01:59,760
fact that they actually
 

3301
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:03,270
fact that they actually
are connected to each other and i was at

3302
01:02:03,270 --> 01:02:03,280
are connected to each other and i was at
 

3303
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:04,630
are connected to each other and i was at
that time

3304
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:04,640
that time
 

3305
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,230
that time
just doing this on the basis of

3306
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:06,240
just doing this on the basis of
 

3307
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:07,670
just doing this on the basis of
information flow

3308
01:02:07,670 --> 01:02:07,680
information flow
 

3309
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:11,190
information flow
now it turns out in the last five years

3310
01:02:11,190 --> 01:02:11,200
now it turns out in the last five years
 

3311
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,430
now it turns out in the last five years
or so

3312
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:13,440
or so
 

3313
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:17,190
or so
in the post the deep learning revolution

3314
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:17,200
in the post the deep learning revolution
 

3315
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:20,150
in the post the deep learning revolution
that this this architecture has turned

3316
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:20,160
that this this architecture has turned
 

3317
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:21,270
that this this architecture has turned
out to be

3318
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:21,280
out to be
 

3319
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:24,630
out to be
very conducive to that

3320
01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:24,640
very conducive to that
 

3321
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:27,349
very conducive to that
because basically in these neural

3322
01:02:27,349 --> 01:02:27,359
because basically in these neural
 

3323
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:28,950
because basically in these neural
networks we are trying to

3324
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:28,960
networks we are trying to
 

3325
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:32,789
networks we are trying to
build multiple representations

3326
01:02:32,789 --> 01:02:32,799

 

3327
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:35,029

there can be multiple output heads

3328
01:02:35,029 --> 01:02:35,039
there can be multiple output heads
 

3329
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:37,109
there can be multiple output heads
sharing common representations

3330
01:02:37,109 --> 01:02:37,119
sharing common representations
 

3331
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:40,390
sharing common representations
so in a certain sense today given the

3332
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:40,400
so in a certain sense today given the
 

3333
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,630
so in a certain sense today given the
reality of what solutions people have to

3334
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:42,640
reality of what solutions people have to
 

3335
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:44,150
reality of what solutions people have to
these

3336
01:02:44,150 --> 01:02:44,160
these
 

3337
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,349
these
i i i i do not need to preach this

3338
01:02:47,349 --> 01:02:47,359
i i i i do not need to preach this
 

3339
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:48,150
i i i i do not need to preach this
anymore

3340
01:02:48,150 --> 01:02:48,160
anymore
 

3341
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:51,109
anymore
it is it is just there it's part of the

3342
01:02:51,109 --> 01:02:51,119
it is it is just there it's part of the
 

3343
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:52,470
it is it is just there it's part of the
solution space

3344
01:02:52,470 --> 01:02:52,480
solution space
 

3345
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:55,270
solution space
so speaking of neural networks how much

3346
01:02:55,270 --> 01:02:55,280
so speaking of neural networks how much
 

3347
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:56,630
so speaking of neural networks how much
of

3348
01:02:56,630 --> 01:02:56,640
of
 

3349
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:00,390
of
this uh problem of computer vision

3350
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:00,400
this uh problem of computer vision
 

3351
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,750
this uh problem of computer vision
of the organization recognition

3352
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:03,760
of the organization recognition
 

3353
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:09,029
of the organization recognition
can be um reconstruction

3354
01:03:09,029 --> 01:03:09,039
can be um reconstruction
 

3355
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:11,270
can be um reconstruction
how much of it can be learned end to end

3356
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:11,280
how much of it can be learned end to end
 

3357
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:12,470
how much of it can be learned end to end
do you think

3358
01:03:12,470 --> 01:03:12,480
do you think
 

3359
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:17,109
do you think
instead of uh set it and forget it just

3360
01:03:17,109 --> 01:03:17,119
instead of uh set it and forget it just
 

3361
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:18,230
instead of uh set it and forget it just
plug and play

3362
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:18,240
plug and play
 

3363
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,710
plug and play
have a giant data set multiple perhaps

3364
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:20,720
have a giant data set multiple perhaps
 

3365
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,069
have a giant data set multiple perhaps
multi-modal

3366
01:03:22,069 --> 01:03:22,079
multi-modal
 

3367
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:25,349
multi-modal
and then just learn the entirety of it

3368
01:03:25,349 --> 01:03:25,359
and then just learn the entirety of it
 

3369
01:03:25,359 --> 01:03:28,870
and then just learn the entirety of it
well so i i think that currently what

3370
01:03:28,870 --> 01:03:28,880
well so i i think that currently what
 

3371
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,029
well so i i think that currently what
that end-to-end learning means nowadays

3372
01:03:31,029 --> 01:03:31,039
that end-to-end learning means nowadays
 

3373
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:33,670
that end-to-end learning means nowadays
is end-to-end supervised learning

3374
01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:33,680
is end-to-end supervised learning
 

3375
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:36,789
is end-to-end supervised learning
and and that i would argue is too narrow

3376
01:03:36,789 --> 01:03:36,799
and and that i would argue is too narrow
 

3377
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:38,390
and and that i would argue is too narrow
a view of the problem

3378
01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:38,400
a view of the problem
 

3379
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:41,910
a view of the problem
i would i like this child development

3380
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:41,920
i would i like this child development
 

3381
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:42,309
i would i like this child development
view

3382
01:03:42,309 --> 01:03:42,319
view
 

3383
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:45,829
view
this lifelong learning view one where

3384
01:03:45,829 --> 01:03:45,839
this lifelong learning view one where
 

3385
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:47,589
this lifelong learning view one where
there are certain capabilities that are

3386
01:03:47,589 --> 01:03:47,599
there are certain capabilities that are
 

3387
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:49,029
there are certain capabilities that are
built up and then there are certain

3388
01:03:49,029 --> 01:03:49,039
built up and then there are certain
 

3389
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:51,510
built up and then there are certain
capabilities which are built up

3390
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:51,520
capabilities which are built up
 

3391
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:54,870
capabilities which are built up
on top of that so uh

3392
01:03:54,870 --> 01:03:54,880
on top of that so uh
 

3393
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:58,549
on top of that so uh
that's that's what i i believe in

3394
01:03:58,549 --> 01:03:58,559
that's that's what i i believe in
 

3395
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:02,309
that's that's what i i believe in
so i think uh

3396
01:04:02,309 --> 01:04:02,319
so i think uh
 

3397
01:04:02,319 --> 01:04:05,109
so i think uh
end-to-end learning in the supervised

3398
01:04:05,109 --> 01:04:05,119
end-to-end learning in the supervised
 

3399
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,549
end-to-end learning in the supervised
setting

3400
01:04:06,549 --> 01:04:06,559
setting
 

3401
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:10,829
setting
for a very precise task to me is

3402
01:04:10,829 --> 01:04:10,839
for a very precise task to me is
 

3403
01:04:10,839 --> 01:04:13,910
for a very precise task to me is
a kind of is uh

3404
01:04:13,910 --> 01:04:13,920
a kind of is uh
 

3405
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,309
a kind of is uh
it's sort of a limited view of the of

3406
01:04:16,309 --> 01:04:16,319
it's sort of a limited view of the of
 

3407
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:18,069
it's sort of a limited view of the of
the learning process

3408
01:04:18,069 --> 01:04:18,079
the learning process
 

3409
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:21,589
the learning process
got it so if we think about beyond

3410
01:04:21,589 --> 01:04:21,599
got it so if we think about beyond
 

3411
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:23,750
got it so if we think about beyond
purely supervised look at back to

01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:23,760
purely supervised look at back to
 

3413

children you mentioned six lessons
 

3415
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:29,910
children you mentioned six lessons
that we can learn from children uh of

among
 

3437
01:04:57,359 --> 01:05:01,589
among
child development people it's just that

child development people it's just that
 

3439
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:04,150
child development people it's just that
these are this is not common wisdom

3440
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:04,160
these are this is not common wisdom

01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:04,950
these are this is not common wisdom
among people

3442

among people
 

3443
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:07,029
among people
in computer vision and ai and machine

3444
01:05:07,029 --> 01:05:07,039
in computer vision and ai and machine
 

3445
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:08,870

learning so

3446
01:05:08,870 --> 01:05:08,880
learning so
 

3447
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:12,549
learning so
i view my role as uh trying to

3448
01:05:12,549 --> 01:05:12,559
i view my role as uh trying to
 

3449
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:15,750
i view my role as uh trying to
bridge the worlds bridge the two worlds

3450
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:15,760
bridge the worlds bridge the two worlds
 

3451
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,150
bridge the worlds bridge the two worlds
so uh so let's take an example of a

3452
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:18,160
so uh so let's take an example of a
 

3453
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:19,990
so uh so let's take an example of a
multi-modal i like that

3454
01:05:19,990 --> 01:05:20,000
multi-modal i like that
 

3455
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,470
multi-modal i like that
so multi-modal canonical example is uh

3456
01:05:24,470 --> 01:05:24,480
so multi-modal canonical example is uh
 

3457
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:27,670
so multi-modal canonical example is uh
a child interacting with uh with an

3458
01:05:27,670 --> 01:05:27,680
a child interacting with uh with an
 

3459
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:28,630
a child interacting with uh with an
object

3460
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:28,640
object
 

3461
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,870
object
so then the child so the child holds a

3462
01:05:30,870 --> 01:05:30,880
so then the child so the child holds a
 

3463
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:32,390
so then the child so the child holds a
ball and plays with it

3464
01:05:32,390 --> 01:05:32,400
ball and plays with it
 

3465
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,230
ball and plays with it
so at that point it's getting a touch

3466
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:34,240
so at that point it's getting a touch
 

3467
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:35,510
so at that point it's getting a touch
signal

3468
01:05:35,510 --> 01:05:35,520
signal
 

3469
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:38,789
signal
so the touch signal is

3470
01:05:38,789 --> 01:05:38,799
so the touch signal is
 

3471
01:05:38,799 --> 01:05:41,750
so the touch signal is
is getting as the notion of 3d shape but

3472
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:41,760
is getting as the notion of 3d shape but
 

3473
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,829
is getting as the notion of 3d shape but
it is sparse

3474
01:05:43,829 --> 01:05:43,839
it is sparse
 

3475
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:45,589
it is sparse
and then the child is also seeing a

3476
01:05:45,589 --> 01:05:45,599
and then the child is also seeing a
 

3477
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:47,589
and then the child is also seeing a
visual signal right

3478
01:05:47,589 --> 01:05:47,599
visual signal right
 

3479
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:50,470
visual signal right
and and these two so imagine these are

3480
01:05:50,470 --> 01:05:50,480
and and these two so imagine these are
 

3481
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,230
and and these two so imagine these are
two in totally different spaces

3482
01:05:52,230 --> 01:05:52,240
two in totally different spaces
 

3483
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:55,190
two in totally different spaces
right so one is the space of receptors

3484
01:05:55,190 --> 01:05:55,200
right so one is the space of receptors
 

3485
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,069
right so one is the space of receptors
on the skin

3486
01:05:56,069 --> 01:05:56,079
on the skin
 

3487
01:05:56,079 --> 01:05:57,829
on the skin
of the fingers and the thumb and the

3488
01:05:57,829 --> 01:05:57,839
of the fingers and the thumb and the
 

3489
01:05:57,839 --> 01:05:59,190
of the fingers and the thumb and the
palm

3490
01:05:59,190 --> 01:05:59,200
palm
 

3491
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,750
palm
right and then these map on to these

3492
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:01,760
right and then these map on to these
 

3493
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:03,589
right and then these map on to these
neuronal fibers are

3494
01:06:03,589 --> 01:06:03,599
neuronal fibers are
 

3495
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:06,630
neuronal fibers are
getting activated somewhere right these

3496
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:06,640
getting activated somewhere right these
 

3497
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:09,349
getting activated somewhere right these
lead to some activation in somatosensory

3498
01:06:09,349 --> 01:06:09,359
lead to some activation in somatosensory
 

3499
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:10,309
lead to some activation in somatosensory
cortex

3500
01:06:10,309 --> 01:06:10,319
cortex
 

3501
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:12,710
cortex
i mean a similar thing will happen if we

3502
01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:12,720
i mean a similar thing will happen if we
 

3503
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:14,150
i mean a similar thing will happen if we
have a robot

3504
01:06:14,150 --> 01:06:14,160
have a robot
 

3505
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:16,950
have a robot
hand okay and then we have the pixels

3506
01:06:16,950 --> 01:06:16,960
hand okay and then we have the pixels
 

3507
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:18,150
hand okay and then we have the pixels
corresponding to the

3508
01:06:18,150 --> 01:06:18,160
corresponding to the
 

3509
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:20,470
corresponding to the
visual view but we know that they

3510
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:20,480
visual view but we know that they
 

3511
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:21,910
visual view but we know that they
correspond to the same

3512
01:06:21,910 --> 01:06:21,920
correspond to the same
 

3513
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:24,950
correspond to the same
object right so that's

3514
01:06:24,950 --> 01:06:24,960
object right so that's
 

3515
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:27,430
object right so that's
a very very strong cross calibration

3516
01:06:27,430 --> 01:06:27,440
a very very strong cross calibration
 

3517
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:28,710
a very very strong cross calibration
signal

3518
01:06:28,710 --> 01:06:28,720
signal
 

3519
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,950
signal
and it is self-supervisory which is

3520
01:06:30,950 --> 01:06:30,960
and it is self-supervisory which is
 

3521
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,230
and it is self-supervisory which is
beautiful right

3522
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:32,240
beautiful right
 

3523
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:34,069
beautiful right
there's nobody assigning a label the

3524
01:06:34,069 --> 01:06:34,079
there's nobody assigning a label the
 

3525
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:35,510
there's nobody assigning a label the
mother doesn't have to

3526
01:06:35,510 --> 01:06:35,520
mother doesn't have to
 

3527
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:38,150
mother doesn't have to
come and assign a label the child

3528
01:06:38,150 --> 01:06:38,160
come and assign a label the child
 

3529
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,109
come and assign a label the child
doesn't even have to

3530
01:06:39,109 --> 01:06:39,119
doesn't even have to
 

3531
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:42,150
doesn't even have to
know that this object is called a ball

3532
01:06:42,150 --> 01:06:42,160
know that this object is called a ball
 

3533
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:44,069
know that this object is called a ball
okay but the obj the child is learning

3534
01:06:44,069 --> 01:06:44,079
okay but the obj the child is learning
 

3535
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:45,510
okay but the obj the child is learning
something about the three-dimensional

3536
01:06:45,510 --> 01:06:45,520
something about the three-dimensional
 

3537
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:46,630
something about the three-dimensional
world

3538
01:06:46,630 --> 01:06:46,640
world
 

3539
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:49,750
world
from this signal uh

3540
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:49,760
from this signal uh
 

3541
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:52,549
from this signal uh
i think tactile and visual there is some

3542
01:06:52,549 --> 01:06:52,559
i think tactile and visual there is some
 

3543
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:53,430
i think tactile and visual there is some
work on

3544
01:06:53,430 --> 01:06:53,440
work on
 

3545
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:55,109
work on
there is a lot of work currently on

3546
01:06:55,109 --> 01:06:55,119
there is a lot of work currently on
 

3547
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:57,430
there is a lot of work currently on
audio and visual

3548
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:57,440
audio and visual
 

3549
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,910
audio and visual
okay an audio visual so there is some

3550
01:06:59,910 --> 01:06:59,920
okay an audio visual so there is some
 

3551
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,670
okay an audio visual so there is some
event that happens in the world

3552
01:07:01,670 --> 01:07:01,680
event that happens in the world
 

3553
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:04,069
event that happens in the world
and that event has a visual signature

3554
01:07:04,069 --> 01:07:04,079
and that event has a visual signature
 

3555
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:05,430
and that event has a visual signature
and it has a

3556
01:07:05,430 --> 01:07:05,440
and it has a
 

3557
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:07,670
and it has a
auditory signature so there is this

3558
01:07:07,670 --> 01:07:07,680
auditory signature so there is this
 

3559
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:09,829
auditory signature so there is this
glass bowl on the table and it falls and

3560
01:07:09,829 --> 01:07:09,839
glass bowl on the table and it falls and
 

3561
01:07:09,839 --> 01:07:11,510
glass bowl on the table and it falls and
breaks and i hear the

3562
01:07:11,510 --> 01:07:11,520
breaks and i hear the
 

3563
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:13,589
breaks and i hear the
smashing sound and i see the pieces of

3564
01:07:13,589 --> 01:07:13,599
smashing sound and i see the pieces of
 

3565
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:15,109
smashing sound and i see the pieces of
glass

3566
01:07:15,109 --> 01:07:15,119
glass
 

3567
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:17,750
glass
okay i've built that connection between

3568
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:17,760
okay i've built that connection between
 

3569
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:18,789
okay i've built that connection between
the two

3570
01:07:18,789 --> 01:07:18,799
the two
 

3571
01:07:18,799 --> 01:07:21,750
the two
right we have people uh i mean this has

3572
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:21,760
right we have people uh i mean this has
 

3573
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:23,589
right we have people uh i mean this has
become a hot topic in computer vision in

3574
01:07:23,589 --> 01:07:23,599
become a hot topic in computer vision in
 

3575
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:25,430
become a hot topic in computer vision in
the last couple of years

3576
01:07:25,430 --> 01:07:25,440
the last couple of years
 

3577
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:28,950
the last couple of years
there is there are problems like uh

3578
01:07:28,950 --> 01:07:28,960
there is there are problems like uh
 

3579
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:32,309
there is there are problems like uh
separating out multiple speakers right

3580
01:07:32,309 --> 01:07:32,319
separating out multiple speakers right
 

3581
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:34,549
separating out multiple speakers right
which was a classic problem in in

3582
01:07:34,549 --> 01:07:34,559
which was a classic problem in in
 

3583
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:36,470
which was a classic problem in in
audition they call this the problem of

3584
01:07:36,470 --> 01:07:36,480
audition they call this the problem of
 

3585
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:38,230
audition they call this the problem of
source separation or the

3586
01:07:38,230 --> 01:07:38,240
source separation or the
 

3587
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:41,270
source separation or the
cocktail party effect and so on but just

3588
01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:41,280
cocktail party effect and so on but just
 

3589
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,029
cocktail party effect and so on but just
try to do it visually

3590
01:07:43,029 --> 01:07:43,039
try to do it visually
 

3591
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:46,470
try to do it visually
when you also have it becomes so much

3592
01:07:46,470 --> 01:07:46,480
when you also have it becomes so much
 

3593
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:50,470
when you also have it becomes so much
easier and so much more useful

3594
01:07:50,470 --> 01:07:50,480
easier and so much more useful
 

3595
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:53,589
easier and so much more useful
so the the multimodal i mean there's so

3596
01:07:53,589 --> 01:07:53,599
so the the multimodal i mean there's so
 

3597
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:54,230
so the the multimodal i mean there's so
much more

3598
01:07:54,230 --> 01:07:54,240
much more
 

3599
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:56,630
much more
signal with multimodal and you can use

3600
01:07:56,630 --> 01:07:56,640
signal with multimodal and you can use
 

3601
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:57,430
signal with multimodal and you can use
that

3602
01:07:57,430 --> 01:07:57,440
that
 

3603
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,589
that
for some kind of weak supervision as

3604
01:07:59,589 --> 01:07:59,599
for some kind of weak supervision as
 

3605
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:00,630
for some kind of weak supervision as
well yes

3606
01:08:00,630 --> 01:08:00,640
well yes
 

3607
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:01,990
well yes
because they are occurring at the same

3608
01:08:01,990 --> 01:08:02,000
because they are occurring at the same
 

3609
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,069
because they are occurring at the same
time in time yeah so you have time

3610
01:08:04,069 --> 01:08:04,079
time in time yeah so you have time
 

3611
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:06,470
time in time yeah so you have time
which links the two right so at a

3612
01:08:06,470 --> 01:08:06,480
which links the two right so at a
 

3613
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:08,069
which links the two right so at a
certain moment t1

3614
01:08:08,069 --> 01:08:08,079
certain moment t1
 

3615
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:09,589
certain moment t1
you've got a certain signal in the

3616
01:08:09,589 --> 01:08:09,599
you've got a certain signal in the
 

3617
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:11,349
you've got a certain signal in the
auditory domain and a certain signal in

3618
01:08:11,349 --> 01:08:11,359
auditory domain and a certain signal in
 

3619
01:08:11,359 --> 01:08:12,390
auditory domain and a certain signal in
the visual domain

3620
01:08:12,390 --> 01:08:12,400
the visual domain
 

3621
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:15,349
the visual domain
but they must be causally related yeah

3622
01:08:15,349 --> 01:08:15,359
but they must be causally related yeah
 

3623
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:17,349
but they must be causally related yeah
it's an exciting area not well studied

3624
01:08:17,349 --> 01:08:17,359
it's an exciting area not well studied
 

3625
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:17,910
it's an exciting area not well studied
yet

3626
01:08:17,910 --> 01:08:17,920
yet
 

3627
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:19,749
yet
not yeah i mean we have a little bit of

3628
01:08:19,749 --> 01:08:19,759
not yeah i mean we have a little bit of
 

3629
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:22,309
not yeah i mean we have a little bit of
work at this but uh but

3630
01:08:22,309 --> 01:08:22,319
work at this but uh but
 

3631
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:24,390
work at this but uh but
but so much more needs to be done yeah

3632
01:08:24,390 --> 01:08:24,400
but so much more needs to be done yeah
 

3633
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:25,349
but so much more needs to be done yeah
so so so

3634
01:08:25,349 --> 01:08:25,359
so so so
 

3635
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:28,070
so so so
so this this is this is a good example

3636
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:28,080
so this this is this is a good example
 

3637
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:29,110
so this this is this is a good example
be physical

3638
01:08:29,110 --> 01:08:29,120
be physical
 

3639
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:31,269
be physical
that's to do with uh like the one thing

3640
01:08:31,269 --> 01:08:31,279
that's to do with uh like the one thing
 

3641
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:32,390
that's to do with uh like the one thing
we talked about

3642
01:08:32,390 --> 01:08:32,400
we talked about
 

3643
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:34,950
we talked about
earlier that that there's a embodied

3644
01:08:34,950 --> 01:08:34,960
earlier that that there's a embodied
 

3645
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:36,390
earlier that that there's a embodied
world

3646
01:08:36,390 --> 01:08:36,400
world
 

3647
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:39,910
world
to mention language use language so

3648
01:08:39,910 --> 01:08:39,920
to mention language use language so
 

3649
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:42,390
to mention language use language so
no chomsky believes that language may be

3650
01:08:42,390 --> 01:08:42,400
no chomsky believes that language may be
 

3651
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:44,149
no chomsky believes that language may be
at the core of cognition at the core of

3652
01:08:44,149 --> 01:08:44,159
at the core of cognition at the core of
 

3653
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:46,229
at the core of cognition at the core of
everything in the human mind

3654
01:08:46,229 --> 01:08:46,239
everything in the human mind
 

3655
01:08:46,239 --> 01:08:48,149
everything in the human mind
what is the connection between language

3656
01:08:48,149 --> 01:08:48,159
what is the connection between language
 

3657
01:08:48,159 --> 01:08:49,990
what is the connection between language
and vision to you

3658
01:08:49,990 --> 01:08:50,000
and vision to you
 

3659
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,309
and vision to you
like what's more fundamental are they

3660
01:08:52,309 --> 01:08:52,319
like what's more fundamental are they
 

3661
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:53,269
like what's more fundamental are they
neighbors

3662
01:08:53,269 --> 01:08:53,279
neighbors
 

3663
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:56,149
neighbors
is one the parent and the child the

3664
01:08:56,149 --> 01:08:56,159
is one the parent and the child the
 

3665
01:08:56,159 --> 01:08:57,829
is one the parent and the child the
chicken and the egg

3666
01:08:57,829 --> 01:08:57,839
chicken and the egg
 

3667
01:08:57,839 --> 01:08:59,990
chicken and the egg
oh it's very clear it is vision which is

3668
01:08:59,990 --> 01:09:00,000
oh it's very clear it is vision which is
 

3669
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,189
oh it's very clear it is vision which is
the appearance the fundament the

3670
01:09:01,189 --> 01:09:01,199
the appearance the fundament the
 

3671
01:09:01,199 --> 01:09:02,470
the appearance the fundament the
permission is the fundamental

3672
01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:02,480
permission is the fundamental
 

3673
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:06,950
permission is the fundamental
ability okay well so

3674
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:06,960
ability okay well so
 

3675
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:09,349
ability okay well so
uh it comes before you think vision is

3676
01:09:09,349 --> 01:09:09,359
uh it comes before you think vision is
 

3677
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:10,789
uh it comes before you think vision is
more fundamental than language

3678
01:09:10,789 --> 01:09:10,799
more fundamental than language
 

3679
01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:14,390
more fundamental than language
correct and and and it and yeah

3680
01:09:14,390 --> 01:09:14,400
correct and and and it and yeah
 

3681
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,709
correct and and and it and yeah
you can think of it either in phylogeny

3682
01:09:16,709 --> 01:09:16,719
you can think of it either in phylogeny
 

3683
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:17,990
you can think of it either in phylogeny
or in ontogeny

3684
01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:18,000
or in ontogeny
 

3685
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,749
or in ontogeny
so phylogeny means if you look at

3686
01:09:19,749 --> 01:09:19,759
so phylogeny means if you look at
 

3687
01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:21,669
so phylogeny means if you look at
evolutionary time

3688
01:09:21,669 --> 01:09:21,679
evolutionary time
 

3689
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:23,990
evolutionary time
right so you we have vision that

3690
01:09:23,990 --> 01:09:24,000
right so you we have vision that
 

3691
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,390
right so you we have vision that
developed 500 million years ago

3692
01:09:26,390 --> 01:09:26,400
developed 500 million years ago
 

3693
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:29,510
developed 500 million years ago
okay then something like when we get to

3694
01:09:29,510 --> 01:09:29,520
okay then something like when we get to
 

3695
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:30,390
okay then something like when we get to
maybe like

3696
01:09:30,390 --> 01:09:30,400
maybe like
 

3697
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:32,070
maybe like
five million years ago you have the

3698
01:09:32,070 --> 01:09:32,080
five million years ago you have the
 

3699
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:35,349
five million years ago you have the
first bipedal primate so when we started

3700
01:09:35,349 --> 01:09:35,359
first bipedal primate so when we started
 

3701
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:36,149
first bipedal primate so when we started
to

3702
01:09:36,149 --> 01:09:36,159
to
 

3703
01:09:36,159 --> 01:09:39,030
to
walk then the hands became free and so

3704
01:09:39,030 --> 01:09:39,040
walk then the hands became free and so
 

3705
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:39,510
walk then the hands became free and so
then

3706
01:09:39,510 --> 01:09:39,520
then
 

3707
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,990
then
manipulation the ability to manipulate

3708
01:09:41,990 --> 01:09:42,000
manipulation the ability to manipulate
 

3709
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,070
manipulation the ability to manipulate
objects and build tools and

3710
01:09:44,070 --> 01:09:44,080
objects and build tools and
 

3711
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:46,789
objects and build tools and
so on and so forth so you said 500 000

3712
01:09:46,789 --> 01:09:46,799
so on and so forth so you said 500 000
 

3713
01:09:46,799 --> 01:09:47,990
so on and so forth so you said 500 000
years ago no no sorry

3714
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:48,000
years ago no no sorry
 

3715
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,269
years ago no no sorry
the the first multicellular animals

3716
01:09:51,269 --> 01:09:51,279
the the first multicellular animals
 

3717
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:52,950
the the first multicellular animals
which you can say

3718
01:09:52,950 --> 01:09:52,960
which you can say
 

3719
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:56,630
which you can say
had some intelligence arose 500 million

3720
01:09:56,630 --> 01:09:56,640
had some intelligence arose 500 million
 

3721
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:58,070
had some intelligence arose 500 million
years ago

3722
01:09:58,070 --> 01:09:58,080
years ago
 

3723
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:01,430
years ago
okay and now let's fast forward to say

3724
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:01,440
okay and now let's fast forward to say
 

3725
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:01,990
okay and now let's fast forward to say
the last

3726
01:10:01,990 --> 01:10:02,000
the last
 

3727
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,030
the last
seven million years which is the

3728
01:10:05,030 --> 01:10:05,040
seven million years which is the
 

3729
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:06,950
seven million years which is the
development of the hominid line right

3730
01:10:06,950 --> 01:10:06,960
development of the hominid line right
 

3731
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:09,430
development of the hominid line right
where from the other primates we have

3732
01:10:09,430 --> 01:10:09,440
where from the other primates we have
 

3733
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:11,270
where from the other primates we have
the branch which leads on to modern

3734
01:10:11,270 --> 01:10:11,280
the branch which leads on to modern
 

3735
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:12,630
the branch which leads on to modern
humans

3736
01:10:12,630 --> 01:10:12,640
humans
 

3737
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:16,310
humans
now there are many of these hominids

3738
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:16,320
now there are many of these hominids
 

3739
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:20,790
now there are many of these hominids
but the the ones which

3740
01:10:20,790 --> 01:10:20,800

 

3741
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,390

you know people talk about lucy because

3742
01:10:22,390 --> 01:10:22,400
you know people talk about lucy because
 

3743
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:23,910
you know people talk about lucy because
that's like a skeleton from three

3744
01:10:23,910 --> 01:10:23,920
that's like a skeleton from three
 

3745
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:26,470
that's like a skeleton from three
million years ago and we know that lucy

3746
01:10:26,470 --> 01:10:26,480
million years ago and we know that lucy
 

3747
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:30,149
million years ago and we know that lucy
walked okay so at this stage you have

3748
01:10:30,149 --> 01:10:30,159
walked okay so at this stage you have
 

3749
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:32,630
walked okay so at this stage you have
that the hand is free for manipulating

3750
01:10:32,630 --> 01:10:32,640
that the hand is free for manipulating
 

3751
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:33,590
that the hand is free for manipulating
objects

3752
01:10:33,590 --> 01:10:33,600
objects
 

3753
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:35,750
objects
and then the ability to manipulate

3754
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:35,760
and then the ability to manipulate
 

3755
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:36,950
and then the ability to manipulate
objects build

3756
01:10:36,950 --> 01:10:36,960
objects build
 

3757
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:41,189
objects build
tools and the brain size

3758
01:10:41,189 --> 01:10:41,199
tools and the brain size
 

3759
01:10:41,199 --> 01:10:44,790
tools and the brain size
grew in this era so okay so now you have

3760
01:10:44,790 --> 01:10:44,800
grew in this era so okay so now you have
 

3761
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:45,990
grew in this era so okay so now you have
manipulation

3762
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:46,000
manipulation
 

3763
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,229
manipulation
now we don't know exactly when language

3764
01:10:48,229 --> 01:10:48,239
now we don't know exactly when language
 

3765
01:10:48,239 --> 01:10:49,430
now we don't know exactly when language
arrows

3766
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:49,440
arrows
 

3767
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:52,709
arrows
but after that but after that because no

3768
01:10:52,709 --> 01:10:52,719
but after that but after that because no
 

3769
01:10:52,719 --> 01:10:56,149
but after that but after that because no
apes have i mean so i mean chomsky is

3770
01:10:56,149 --> 01:10:56,159
apes have i mean so i mean chomsky is
 

3771
01:10:56,159 --> 01:10:57,750
apes have i mean so i mean chomsky is
correct in that that it is a uniquely

3772
01:10:57,750 --> 01:10:57,760
correct in that that it is a uniquely
 

3773
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:59,350
correct in that that it is a uniquely
human capability

3774
01:10:59,350 --> 01:10:59,360
human capability
 

3775
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:02,550
human capability
and we primates

3776
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:02,560
and we primates
 

3777
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,709
and we primates
other primaries don't have that but so

3778
01:11:04,709 --> 01:11:04,719
other primaries don't have that but so
 

3779
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:06,870
other primaries don't have that but so
it developed somewhere in this era

3780
01:11:06,870 --> 01:11:06,880
it developed somewhere in this era
 

3781
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:10,550
it developed somewhere in this era
but it developed i would

3782
01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:10,560
but it developed i would
 

3783
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:12,550
but it developed i would
i mean uh argue that it probably

3784
01:11:12,550 --> 01:11:12,560
i mean uh argue that it probably
 

3785
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,270
i mean uh argue that it probably
developed after we had this stage of

3786
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:15,280
developed after we had this stage of
 

3787
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:18,390
developed after we had this stage of
uh uh humans or i mean the

3788
01:11:18,390 --> 01:11:18,400
uh uh humans or i mean the
 

3789
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:21,510
uh uh humans or i mean the
human species already able to manipulate

3790
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:21,520
human species already able to manipulate
 

3791
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:25,189
human species already able to manipulate
and a hands-free much bigger brain size

3792
01:11:25,189 --> 01:11:25,199
and a hands-free much bigger brain size
 

3793
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:28,550
and a hands-free much bigger brain size
and for that there's a lot of vision

3794
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:28,560
and for that there's a lot of vision
 

3795
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:31,350
and for that there's a lot of vision
has already had had to have developed

3796
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:31,360
has already had had to have developed
 

3797
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:32,070
has already had had to have developed
yeah so

3798
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:32,080
yeah so
 

3799
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,310
yeah so
the sensation and the perception may be

3800
01:11:34,310 --> 01:11:34,320
the sensation and the perception may be
 

3801
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:35,990
the sensation and the perception may be
some of the cognition

3802
01:11:35,990 --> 01:11:36,000
some of the cognition
 

3803
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,830
some of the cognition
yeah so we we so those

3804
01:11:39,830 --> 01:11:39,840
yeah so we we so those
 

3805
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:43,030
yeah so we we so those
so so that so the world so there

3806
01:11:43,030 --> 01:11:43,040
so so that so the world so there
 

3807
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:46,390
so so that so the world so there
so so these ancestors of us

3808
01:11:46,390 --> 01:11:46,400
so so these ancestors of us
 

3809
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,550
so so these ancestors of us
you know three four million years ago

3810
01:11:48,550 --> 01:11:48,560
you know three four million years ago
 

3811
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,390
you know three four million years ago
they had

3812
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:50,400
they had
 

3813
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:53,510
they had
uh they had spatial intelligence so they

3814
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:53,520
uh they had spatial intelligence so they
 

3815
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:55,990
uh they had spatial intelligence so they
knew that the world consists of objects

3816
01:11:55,990 --> 01:11:56,000
knew that the world consists of objects
 

3817
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,430
knew that the world consists of objects
they knew that the objects were in

3818
01:11:57,430 --> 01:11:57,440
they knew that the objects were in
 

3819
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:59,510
they knew that the objects were in
certain relationships to each other

3820
01:11:59,510 --> 01:11:59,520
certain relationships to each other
 

3821
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:03,030
certain relationships to each other
they had observed causal

3822
01:12:03,030 --> 01:12:03,040
they had observed causal
 

3823
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:05,510
they had observed causal
interactions among objects they could

3824
01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:05,520
interactions among objects they could
 

3825
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:07,590
interactions among objects they could
move in space so they had space and time

3826
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:07,600
move in space so they had space and time
 

3827
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:07,990
move in space so they had space and time
and all

3828
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:08,000
and all
 

3829
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,510
and all
of that so language

3830
01:12:11,510 --> 01:12:11,520
of that so language
 

3831
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:14,149
of that so language
builds on that substrate so language has

3832
01:12:14,149 --> 01:12:14,159
builds on that substrate so language has
 

3833
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:15,189
builds on that substrate so language has
a lot of

3834
01:12:15,189 --> 01:12:15,199
a lot of
 

3835
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:18,950
a lot of
i mean i mean the all human languages

3836
01:12:18,950 --> 01:12:18,960
i mean i mean the all human languages
 

3837
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:20,790
i mean i mean the all human languages
have constructs which depend on

3838
01:12:20,790 --> 01:12:20,800
have constructs which depend on
 

3839
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:23,669
have constructs which depend on
a notion of space and time where did

3840
01:12:23,669 --> 01:12:23,679
a notion of space and time where did
 

3841
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:26,709
a notion of space and time where did
that notion of space and time come from

3842
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:26,719
that notion of space and time come from
 

3843
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:29,189
that notion of space and time come from
it had to come from perception and

3844
01:12:29,189 --> 01:12:29,199
it had to come from perception and
 

3845
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:30,870
it had to come from perception and
action in the world we live in

3846
01:12:30,870 --> 01:12:30,880
action in the world we live in
 

3847
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,709
action in the world we live in
yeah what you refer to as the spatial

3848
01:12:32,709 --> 01:12:32,719
yeah what you refer to as the spatial
 

3849
01:12:32,719 --> 01:12:35,350
yeah what you refer to as the spatial
intelligence yeah yeah

3850
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:35,360
intelligence yeah yeah
 

3851
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:38,390
intelligence yeah yeah
to linger a little bit we mentioned

3852
01:12:38,390 --> 01:12:38,400
to linger a little bit we mentioned
 

3853
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:41,830
to linger a little bit we mentioned
touring and his uh mention of

3854
01:12:41,830 --> 01:12:41,840
touring and his uh mention of
 

3855
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:44,229
touring and his uh mention of
we should learn from children

3856
01:12:44,229 --> 01:12:44,239
we should learn from children
 

3857
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:45,990
we should learn from children
nevertheless language is

3858
01:12:45,990 --> 01:12:46,000
nevertheless language is
 

3859
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,910
nevertheless language is
the fundamental piece of the test of

3860
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:47,920
the fundamental piece of the test of
 

3861
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:50,950
the fundamental piece of the test of
intelligence that touring proposed

3862
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:50,960
intelligence that touring proposed
 

3863
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:52,870
intelligence that touring proposed
what do you think is a good test of

3864
01:12:52,870 --> 01:12:52,880
what do you think is a good test of
 

3865
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:54,470
what do you think is a good test of
intelligence are you

3866
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:54,480
intelligence are you
 

3867
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:56,310
intelligence are you
what would impress the heck out of you

3868
01:12:56,310 --> 01:12:56,320
what would impress the heck out of you
 

3869
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:58,550
what would impress the heck out of you
is it fundamentally

3870
01:12:58,550 --> 01:12:58,560
is it fundamentally
 

3871
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:00,630
is it fundamentally
natural language or is there something

3872
01:13:00,630 --> 01:13:00,640
natural language or is there something
 

3873
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:02,790
natural language or is there something
in vision

3874
01:13:02,790 --> 01:13:02,800
in vision
 

3875
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:05,830
in vision
i i think uh i i wouldn't i

3876
01:13:05,830 --> 01:13:05,840
i i think uh i i wouldn't i
 

3877
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,350
i i think uh i i wouldn't i
i don't think we should have created a

3878
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:07,360
i don't think we should have created a
 

3879
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:09,910
i don't think we should have created a
single test of intelligence

3880
01:13:09,910 --> 01:13:09,920
single test of intelligence
 

3881
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:12,149
single test of intelligence
so just like i don't believe in iq as a

3882
01:13:12,149 --> 01:13:12,159
so just like i don't believe in iq as a
 

3883
01:13:12,159 --> 01:13:13,830
so just like i don't believe in iq as a
single number

3884
01:13:13,830 --> 01:13:13,840
single number
 

3885
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:17,189
single number
i think generally there can be many

3886
01:13:17,189 --> 01:13:17,199
i think generally there can be many
 

3887
01:13:17,199 --> 01:13:17,990
i think generally there can be many
capabilities

3888
01:13:17,990 --> 01:13:18,000
capabilities
 

3889
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,750
capabilities
which are correlated perhaps

3890
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:21,760

 

3891
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:24,870

so i think that there will be

3892
01:13:24,870 --> 01:13:24,880
so i think that there will be
 

3893
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:26,870
so i think that there will be
uh there will be accomplishments which

3894
01:13:26,870 --> 01:13:26,880
uh there will be accomplishments which
 

3895
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,149
uh there will be accomplishments which
are visual accomplishments

3896
01:13:28,149 --> 01:13:28,159
are visual accomplishments
 

3897
01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:29,990
are visual accomplishments
accomplishments which are

3898
01:13:29,990 --> 01:13:30,000
accomplishments which are
 

3899
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,430
accomplishments which are
uh accomplishments in manipulation or

3900
01:13:33,430 --> 01:13:33,440
uh accomplishments in manipulation or
 

3901
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:36,070
uh accomplishments in manipulation or
robotics and then accomplishments in

3902
01:13:36,070 --> 01:13:36,080
robotics and then accomplishments in
 

3903
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:36,790
robotics and then accomplishments in
language

3904
01:13:36,790 --> 01:13:36,800
language
 

3905
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,550
language
i do believe that language will be the

3906
01:13:38,550 --> 01:13:38,560
i do believe that language will be the
 

3907
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:40,310
i do believe that language will be the
hardest not to crack

3908
01:13:40,310 --> 01:13:40,320
hardest not to crack
 

3909
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,950
hardest not to crack
really yeah so what's what's harder to

3910
01:13:42,950 --> 01:13:42,960
really yeah so what's what's harder to
 

3911
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:43,830
really yeah so what's what's harder to
pass

3912
01:13:43,830 --> 01:13:43,840
pass
 

3913
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:45,510
pass
the spirit of the touring test or like

3914
01:13:45,510 --> 01:13:45,520
the spirit of the touring test or like
 

3915
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:47,830
the spirit of the touring test or like
whatever formulation will make it

3916
01:13:47,830 --> 01:13:47,840
whatever formulation will make it
 

3917
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:50,310
whatever formulation will make it
natural language convincingly in natural

3918
01:13:50,310 --> 01:13:50,320
natural language convincingly in natural
 

3919
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:50,950
natural language convincingly in natural
language

3920
01:13:50,950 --> 01:13:50,960
language
 

3921
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:52,149
language
like somebody you would want to have a

3922
01:13:52,149 --> 01:13:52,159
like somebody you would want to have a
 

3923
01:13:52,159 --> 01:13:54,550
like somebody you would want to have a
beer with hang out and have a chat with

3924
01:13:54,550 --> 01:13:54,560
beer with hang out and have a chat with
 

3925
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:57,750
beer with hang out and have a chat with
or the general natural scene

3926
01:13:57,750 --> 01:13:57,760
or the general natural scene
 

3927
01:13:57,760 --> 01:13:59,110
or the general natural scene
understanding

3928
01:13:59,110 --> 01:13:59,120
understanding
 

3929
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:02,229
understanding
you think language is the type i think

3930
01:14:02,229 --> 01:14:02,239
you think language is the type i think
 

3931
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:05,430
you think language is the type i think
i'm not a fan of the

3932
01:14:05,430 --> 01:14:05,440
i'm not a fan of the
 

3933
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:08,390
i'm not a fan of the
i think i think turing test that turing

3934
01:14:08,390 --> 01:14:08,400
i think i think turing test that turing
 

3935
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:11,430
i think i think turing test that turing
as he proposed the test in 1950

3936
01:14:11,430 --> 01:14:11,440
as he proposed the test in 1950
 

3937
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:13,750
as he proposed the test in 1950
was trying to solve a certain problem

3938
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:13,760
was trying to solve a certain problem
 

3939
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:14,790
was trying to solve a certain problem
yeah imitation

3940
01:14:14,790 --> 01:14:14,800
yeah imitation
 

3941
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:17,350
yeah imitation
yeah and and i think it made a lot of

3942
01:14:17,350 --> 01:14:17,360
yeah and and i think it made a lot of
 

3943
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:18,470
yeah and and i think it made a lot of
sense then

3944
01:14:18,470 --> 01:14:18,480
sense then
 

3945
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:21,510
sense then
where we are today 70 years later

3946
01:14:21,510 --> 01:14:21,520
where we are today 70 years later
 

3947
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:24,870
where we are today 70 years later
i think i think we

3948
01:14:24,870 --> 01:14:24,880
i think i think we
 

3949
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:26,709
i think i think we
we should not worry about that i mean i

3950
01:14:26,709 --> 01:14:26,719
we should not worry about that i mean i
 

3951
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:27,990
we should not worry about that i mean i
think the turing test is no

3952
01:14:27,990 --> 01:14:28,000
think the turing test is no
 

3953
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,030
think the turing test is no
longer the right way to uh to

3954
01:14:31,030 --> 01:14:31,040
longer the right way to uh to
 

3955
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:34,070
longer the right way to uh to
to channel research in in ai because

3956
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:34,080
to channel research in in ai because
 

3957
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:36,390
to channel research in in ai because
that it takes us down this path of this

3958
01:14:36,390 --> 01:14:36,400
that it takes us down this path of this
 

3959
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:38,149
that it takes us down this path of this
chat bot which can fool us for five

3960
01:14:38,149 --> 01:14:38,159
chat bot which can fool us for five
 

3961
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:39,669
chat bot which can fool us for five
minutes or whatever

3962
01:14:39,669 --> 01:14:39,679
minutes or whatever
 

3963
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:42,870
minutes or whatever
okay i think i would rather have a list

3964
01:14:42,870 --> 01:14:42,880
okay i think i would rather have a list
 

3965
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:45,669
okay i think i would rather have a list
of 10 different tasks i mean i think

3966
01:14:45,669 --> 01:14:45,679
of 10 different tasks i mean i think
 

3967
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:49,189
of 10 different tasks i mean i think
their tasks which their tasks in the

3968
01:14:49,189 --> 01:14:49,199
their tasks which their tasks in the
 

3969
01:14:49,199 --> 01:14:51,510
their tasks which their tasks in the
manipulation domain tasks and navigation

3970
01:14:51,510 --> 01:14:51,520
manipulation domain tasks and navigation
 

3971
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:53,750
manipulation domain tasks and navigation
tasks and visual scene understanding

3972
01:14:53,750 --> 01:14:53,760
tasks and visual scene understanding
 

3973
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:57,110
tasks and visual scene understanding
tasks in under reading a story and

3974
01:14:57,110 --> 01:14:57,120
tasks in under reading a story and
 

3975
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:59,189
tasks in under reading a story and
answering questions based on that i mean

3976
01:14:59,189 --> 01:14:59,199
answering questions based on that i mean
 

3977
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:00,709
answering questions based on that i mean
so my favorite

3978
01:15:00,709 --> 01:15:00,719
so my favorite
 

3979
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:04,149
so my favorite
language understanding task would be

3980
01:15:04,149 --> 01:15:04,159
language understanding task would be
 

3981
01:15:04,159 --> 01:15:05,830
language understanding task would be
you know reading a novel and being able

3982
01:15:05,830 --> 01:15:05,840
you know reading a novel and being able
 

3983
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:08,830
you know reading a novel and being able
to answer arbitrary questions from it

3984
01:15:08,830 --> 01:15:08,840
to answer arbitrary questions from it
 

3985
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:12,229
to answer arbitrary questions from it
okay right i i think that to me

3986
01:15:12,229 --> 01:15:12,239
okay right i i think that to me
 

3987
01:15:12,239 --> 01:15:14,709
okay right i i think that to me
uh and this is not an exhausted list by

3988
01:15:14,709 --> 01:15:14,719
uh and this is not an exhausted list by
 

3989
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:15,590
uh and this is not an exhausted list by
any means

3990
01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:15,600
any means
 

3991
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:18,470
any means
so i would uh i think that that's what

3992
01:15:18,470 --> 01:15:18,480
so i would uh i think that that's what
 

3993
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:18,790
so i would uh i think that that's what
we

3994
01:15:18,790 --> 01:15:18,800
we
 

3995
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:21,510
we
where we need to be going to and each of

3996
01:15:21,510 --> 01:15:21,520
where we need to be going to and each of
 

3997
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:22,470
where we need to be going to and each of
these

3998
01:15:22,470 --> 01:15:22,480
these
 

3999
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:24,310
these
on each of these axes there's a fair

4000
01:15:24,310 --> 01:15:24,320
on each of these axes there's a fair
 

4001
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:25,910
on each of these axes there's a fair
amount of work to be done

4002
01:15:25,910 --> 01:15:25,920
amount of work to be done
 

4003
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:28,310
amount of work to be done
so on the visual understanding side in

4004
01:15:28,310 --> 01:15:28,320
so on the visual understanding side in
 

4005
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:30,310
so on the visual understanding side in
this intelligence olympics that we've

4006
01:15:30,310 --> 01:15:30,320
this intelligence olympics that we've
 

4007
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:31,990
this intelligence olympics that we've
set up yeah what's a good

4008
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:32,000
set up yeah what's a good
 

4009
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,030
set up yeah what's a good
test for one of many

4010
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:35,040
test for one of many
 

4011
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:39,270
test for one of many
of visual scene understanding

4012
01:15:39,270 --> 01:15:39,280
of visual scene understanding
 

4013
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,189
of visual scene understanding
uh do you think such benchmarks exist

4014
01:15:41,189 --> 01:15:41,199
uh do you think such benchmarks exist
 

4015
01:15:41,199 --> 01:15:42,630
uh do you think such benchmarks exist
sorry to interrupt no there

4016
01:15:42,630 --> 01:15:42,640
sorry to interrupt no there
 

4017
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:44,709
sorry to interrupt no there
there aren't any i i think i think

4018
01:15:44,709 --> 01:15:44,719
there aren't any i i think i think
 

4019
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:45,669
there aren't any i i think i think
essentially

4020
01:15:45,669 --> 01:15:45,679
essentially
 

4021
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:48,709
essentially
to me a really uh good

4022
01:15:48,709 --> 01:15:48,719
to me a really uh good
 

4023
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:51,510
to me a really uh good
aid to the blind so suppose there was a

4024
01:15:51,510 --> 01:15:51,520
aid to the blind so suppose there was a
 

4025
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:53,270
aid to the blind so suppose there was a
blind person

4026
01:15:53,270 --> 01:15:53,280
blind person
 

4027
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:56,950
blind person
and i needed to assist the blind person

4028
01:15:56,950 --> 01:15:56,960
and i needed to assist the blind person
 

4029
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:59,750
and i needed to assist the blind person
so ultimately like we said vision that

4030
01:15:59,750 --> 01:15:59,760
so ultimately like we said vision that
 

4031
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:01,189
so ultimately like we said vision that
aids in the action

4032
01:16:01,189 --> 01:16:01,199
aids in the action
 

4033
01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:05,510
aids in the action
in the survival in this world yeah

4034
01:16:05,510 --> 01:16:05,520
in the survival in this world yeah
 

4035
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:08,709
in the survival in this world yeah
maybe in a simulated world

4036
01:16:08,709 --> 01:16:08,719
maybe in a simulated world
 

4037
01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:11,910
maybe in a simulated world
maybe easier to to measure performance

4038
01:16:11,910 --> 01:16:11,920
maybe easier to to measure performance
 

4039
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:13,270
maybe easier to to measure performance
in a simulated world

4040
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:13,280
in a simulated world
 

4041
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:14,790
in a simulated world
what we are ultimately after is

4042
01:16:14,790 --> 01:16:14,800
what we are ultimately after is
 

4043
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:17,430
what we are ultimately after is
performance in the real world

4044
01:16:17,430 --> 01:16:17,440
performance in the real world
 

4045
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:21,189
performance in the real world
so david hilbert in 1900 proposed 23

4046
01:16:21,189 --> 01:16:21,199
so david hilbert in 1900 proposed 23
 

4047
01:16:21,199 --> 01:16:23,510
so david hilbert in 1900 proposed 23
open problems in mathematics some of

4048
01:16:23,510 --> 01:16:23,520
open problems in mathematics some of
 

4049
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:24,790
open problems in mathematics some of
which are still unsolved

4050
01:16:24,790 --> 01:16:24,800
which are still unsolved
 

4051
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,790
which are still unsolved
most important famous of which is

4052
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:26,800
most important famous of which is
 

4053
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:29,110
most important famous of which is
probably the riemann hypothesis

4054
01:16:29,110 --> 01:16:29,120
probably the riemann hypothesis
 

4055
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:30,790
probably the riemann hypothesis
you've thought about and presented about

4056
01:16:30,790 --> 01:16:30,800
you've thought about and presented about
 

4057
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:33,030
you've thought about and presented about
the hilbert problems of computer vision

4058
01:16:33,030 --> 01:16:33,040
the hilbert problems of computer vision
 

4059
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:36,470
the hilbert problems of computer vision
so let me ask what to you today

4060
01:16:36,470 --> 01:16:36,480
so let me ask what to you today
 

4061
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:37,669
so let me ask what to you today
i don't know when the last year you

4062
01:16:37,669 --> 01:16:37,679
i don't know when the last year you
 

4063
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:40,950
i don't know when the last year you
presented that 2015 but versions of it

4064
01:16:40,950 --> 01:16:40,960
presented that 2015 but versions of it
 

4065
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:42,709
presented that 2015 but versions of it
yeah you're kind of the the face and the

4066
01:16:42,709 --> 01:16:42,719
yeah you're kind of the the face and the
 

4067
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:45,830
yeah you're kind of the the face and the
spokesperson for computer vision

4068
01:16:45,830 --> 01:16:45,840
spokesperson for computer vision
 

4069
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:48,790
spokesperson for computer vision
yeah it's your job to just to state what

4070
01:16:48,790 --> 01:16:48,800
yeah it's your job to just to state what
 

4071
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:49,510
yeah it's your job to just to state what
the problem

4072
01:16:49,510 --> 01:16:49,520
the problem
 

4073
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:51,830
the problem
the open problems are for the field so

4074
01:16:51,830 --> 01:16:51,840
the open problems are for the field so
 

4075
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:52,550
the open problems are for the field so
what today

4076
01:16:52,550 --> 01:16:52,560
what today
 

4077
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:54,229
what today
are the hilbert problems of computer

4078
01:16:54,229 --> 01:16:54,239
are the hilbert problems of computer
 

4079
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:56,310
are the hilbert problems of computer
vision do you think

4080
01:16:56,310 --> 01:16:56,320
vision do you think
 

4081
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:59,750
vision do you think
let me pick pick one to which i regard

4082
01:16:59,750 --> 01:16:59,760
let me pick pick one to which i regard
 

4083
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:00,229
let me pick pick one to which i regard
as

4084
01:17:00,229 --> 01:17:00,239
as
 

4085
01:17:00,239 --> 01:17:04,149
as
uh clearly clearly unsolved

4086
01:17:04,149 --> 01:17:04,159
uh clearly clearly unsolved
 

4087
01:17:04,159 --> 01:17:06,070
uh clearly clearly unsolved
which is what i would call long-form

4088
01:17:06,070 --> 01:17:06,080
which is what i would call long-form
 

4089
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:08,070
which is what i would call long-form
video understanding

4090
01:17:08,070 --> 01:17:08,080
video understanding
 

4091
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:11,430
video understanding
so so we have a video clip and we want

4092
01:17:11,430 --> 01:17:11,440
so so we have a video clip and we want
 

4093
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:12,550
so so we have a video clip and we want
to

4094
01:17:12,550 --> 01:17:12,560
to
 

4095
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:15,750
to
understand the behavior

4096
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:15,760
understand the behavior
 

4097
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:18,790
understand the behavior
in there in terms of

4098
01:17:18,790 --> 01:17:18,800
in there in terms of
 

4099
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,950
in there in terms of
agents their goals

4100
01:17:21,950 --> 01:17:21,960
agents their goals
 

4101
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:25,750
agents their goals
intentionality and uh

4102
01:17:25,750 --> 01:17:25,760
intentionality and uh
 

4103
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:29,510
intentionality and uh
make predictions about what might happen

4104
01:17:29,510 --> 01:17:29,520
make predictions about what might happen
 

4105
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:32,790
make predictions about what might happen
you know so so that that kind of

4106
01:17:32,790 --> 01:17:32,800
you know so so that that kind of
 

4107
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:35,030
you know so so that that kind of
understanding which goes away from

4108
01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:35,040
understanding which goes away from
 

4109
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:36,870
understanding which goes away from
atomic visual action so

4110
01:17:36,870 --> 01:17:36,880
atomic visual action so
 

4111
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:39,669
atomic visual action so
so in the short range the question is

4112
01:17:39,669 --> 01:17:39,679
so in the short range the question is
 

4113
01:17:39,679 --> 01:17:41,430
so in the short range the question is
are you sitting are you standing are you

4114
01:17:41,430 --> 01:17:41,440
are you sitting are you standing are you
 

4115
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:43,030
are you sitting are you standing are you
catching a ball

4116
01:17:43,030 --> 01:17:43,040
catching a ball
 

4117
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:46,229
catching a ball
right that we can do now or we even if

4118
01:17:46,229 --> 01:17:46,239
right that we can do now or we even if
 

4119
01:17:46,239 --> 01:17:48,070
right that we can do now or we even if
we can't do it fully accurately

4120
01:17:48,070 --> 01:17:48,080
we can't do it fully accurately
 

4121
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:50,709
we can't do it fully accurately
if we can do it at 50 percent maybe next

4122
01:17:50,709 --> 01:17:50,719
if we can do it at 50 percent maybe next
 

4123
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:53,750
if we can do it at 50 percent maybe next
year we'll do it at 65 and so forth

4124
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:53,760
year we'll do it at 65 and so forth
 

4125
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:56,709
year we'll do it at 65 and so forth
but i think the long range video

4126
01:17:56,709 --> 01:17:56,719
but i think the long range video
 

4127
01:17:56,719 --> 01:17:57,430
but i think the long range video
understanding

4128
01:17:57,430 --> 01:17:57,440
understanding
 

4129
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:00,950
understanding
i don't think we we we can do today well

4130
01:18:00,950 --> 01:18:00,960
i don't think we we we can do today well
 

4131
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:03,350
i don't think we we we can do today well
today and that means so long and it

4132
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:03,360
today and that means so long and it
 

4133
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:05,110
today and that means so long and it
blends into cognition that's the reason

4134
01:18:05,110 --> 01:18:05,120
blends into cognition that's the reason
 

4135
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:06,630
blends into cognition that's the reason
why it's challenging

4136
01:18:06,630 --> 01:18:06,640
why it's challenging
 

4137
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,390
why it's challenging
and so you have to track you have to

4138
01:18:08,390 --> 01:18:08,400
and so you have to track you have to
 

4139
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:10,070
and so you have to track you have to
understand the entities

4140
01:18:10,070 --> 01:18:10,080
understand the entities
 

4141
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:11,669
understand the entities
you have to understand the sds you have

4142
01:18:11,669 --> 01:18:11,679
you have to understand the sds you have
 

4143
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:13,270
you have to understand the sds you have
to track them

4144
01:18:13,270 --> 01:18:13,280
to track them
 

4145
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:15,030
to track them
and you have to have some kind of model

4146
01:18:15,030 --> 01:18:15,040
and you have to have some kind of model
 

4147
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:16,790
and you have to have some kind of model
of their behavior

4148
01:18:16,790 --> 01:18:16,800
of their behavior
 

4149
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:19,350
of their behavior
correct and their and if their behavior

4150
01:18:19,350 --> 01:18:19,360
correct and their and if their behavior
 

4151
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:20,229
correct and their and if their behavior
might be

4152
01:18:20,229 --> 01:18:20,239
might be
 

4153
01:18:20,239 --> 01:18:21,830
might be
these are these are agents so they are

4154
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:21,840
these are these are agents so they are
 

4155
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:23,270
these are these are agents so they are
not just like passive

4156
01:18:23,270 --> 01:18:23,280
not just like passive
 

4157
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:26,390
not just like passive
objects but the agent so therefore we

4158
01:18:26,390 --> 01:18:26,400
objects but the agent so therefore we
 

4159
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,229
objects but the agent so therefore we
they might they would exhibit gold

4160
01:18:28,229 --> 01:18:28,239
they might they would exhibit gold
 

4161
01:18:28,239 --> 01:18:30,390
they might they would exhibit gold
directed behavior

4162
01:18:30,390 --> 01:18:30,400
directed behavior
 

4163
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:33,110
directed behavior
okay so this is this is one area then i

4164
01:18:33,110 --> 01:18:33,120
okay so this is this is one area then i
 

4165
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:33,910
okay so this is this is one area then i
will talk about

4166
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:33,920
will talk about
 

4167
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:36,870
will talk about
say understanding the world in 3d now

4168
01:18:36,870 --> 01:18:36,880
say understanding the world in 3d now
 

4169
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:38,550
say understanding the world in 3d now
this may seem

4170
01:18:38,550 --> 01:18:38,560
this may seem
 

4171
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:41,030
this may seem
paradoxical because in a way we have

4172
01:18:41,030 --> 01:18:41,040
paradoxical because in a way we have
 

4173
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:43,030
paradoxical because in a way we have
been able to do 3d understanding even

4174
01:18:43,030 --> 01:18:43,040
been able to do 3d understanding even
 

4175
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:43,910
been able to do 3d understanding even
like

4176
01:18:43,910 --> 01:18:43,920
like
 

4177
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:46,790
like
30 years ago right but i don't think we

4178
01:18:46,790 --> 01:18:46,800
30 years ago right but i don't think we
 

4179
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:49,270
30 years ago right but i don't think we
currently have the richness of

4180
01:18:49,270 --> 01:18:49,280
currently have the richness of
 

4181
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:51,669
currently have the richness of
3d understanding in our computer vision

4182
01:18:51,669 --> 01:18:51,679
3d understanding in our computer vision
 

4183
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:53,750
3d understanding in our computer vision
system that we would like

4184
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:53,760
system that we would like
 

4185
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:56,870
system that we would like
because ah so let me elaborate on that a

4186
01:18:56,870 --> 01:18:56,880
because ah so let me elaborate on that a
 

4187
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:57,350
because ah so let me elaborate on that a
bit

4188
01:18:57,350 --> 01:18:57,360
bit
 

4189
01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:00,709
bit
so currently we have two kinds of

4190
01:19:00,709 --> 01:19:00,719
so currently we have two kinds of
 

4191
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:01,990
so currently we have two kinds of
techniques which are

4192
01:19:01,990 --> 01:19:02,000
techniques which are
 

4193
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,910
techniques which are
not fully unified so there are the kinds

4194
01:19:03,910 --> 01:19:03,920
not fully unified so there are the kinds
 

4195
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:05,590
not fully unified so there are the kinds
of techniques from

4196
01:19:05,590 --> 01:19:05,600
of techniques from
 

4197
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:07,110
of techniques from
multi-view geometry that you have

4198
01:19:07,110 --> 01:19:07,120
multi-view geometry that you have
 

4199
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:09,189
multi-view geometry that you have
multiple pictures of a scene and you do

4200
01:19:09,189 --> 01:19:09,199
multiple pictures of a scene and you do
 

4201
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:09,910
multiple pictures of a scene and you do
a

4202
01:19:09,910 --> 01:19:09,920
a
 

4203
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:12,390
a
reconstruction using stereoscopic vision

4204
01:19:12,390 --> 01:19:12,400
reconstruction using stereoscopic vision
 

4205
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,390
reconstruction using stereoscopic vision
or structure from motion

4206
01:19:14,390 --> 01:19:14,400
or structure from motion
 

4207
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:18,149
or structure from motion
but these techniques do not

4208
01:19:18,149 --> 01:19:18,159
but these techniques do not
 

4209
01:19:18,159 --> 01:19:19,750
but these techniques do not
they totally fail if you just have a

4210
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:19,760
they totally fail if you just have a
 

4211
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:21,990
they totally fail if you just have a
single view because they are relying

4212
01:19:21,990 --> 01:19:22,000
single view because they are relying
 

4213
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:26,149
single view because they are relying
on this this multiple geometry

4214
01:19:26,149 --> 01:19:26,159
on this this multiple geometry
 

4215
01:19:26,159 --> 01:19:28,149
on this this multiple geometry
okay then we have some techniques that

4216
01:19:28,149 --> 01:19:28,159
okay then we have some techniques that
 

4217
01:19:28,159 --> 01:19:29,750
okay then we have some techniques that
we have developed in the computer vision

4218
01:19:29,750 --> 01:19:29,760
we have developed in the computer vision
 

4219
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:31,590
we have developed in the computer vision
community which try to

4220
01:19:31,590 --> 01:19:31,600
community which try to
 

4221
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:34,709
community which try to
guess 3d from single views and these

4222
01:19:34,709 --> 01:19:34,719
guess 3d from single views and these
 

4223
01:19:34,719 --> 01:19:35,990
guess 3d from single views and these
techniques are based

4224
01:19:35,990 --> 01:19:36,000
techniques are based
 

4225
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,350
techniques are based
on on supervised learning

4226
01:19:39,350 --> 01:19:39,360
on on supervised learning
 

4227
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:41,830
on on supervised learning
and they are based on having a training

4228
01:19:41,830 --> 01:19:41,840
and they are based on having a training
 

4229
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:42,630
and they are based on having a training
time

4230
01:19:42,630 --> 01:19:42,640
time
 

4231
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:45,750
time
3d models of objects available

4232
01:19:45,750 --> 01:19:45,760
3d models of objects available
 

4233
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:47,350
3d models of objects available
and this is completely unnatural

4234
01:19:47,350 --> 01:19:47,360
and this is completely unnatural
 

4235
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:49,430
and this is completely unnatural
supervision

4236
01:19:49,430 --> 01:19:49,440
supervision
 

4237
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:52,070
supervision
right that's not cad models are not

4238
01:19:52,070 --> 01:19:52,080
right that's not cad models are not
 

4239
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:54,390
right that's not cad models are not
injected into your brain

4240
01:19:54,390 --> 01:19:54,400
injected into your brain
 

4241
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,390
injected into your brain
okay so what would i like what i would

4242
01:19:56,390 --> 01:19:56,400
okay so what would i like what i would
 

4243
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:58,630
okay so what would i like what i would
like would be a kind of

4244
01:19:58,630 --> 01:19:58,640
like would be a kind of
 

4245
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:01,990
like would be a kind of
uh learning as you

4246
01:20:01,990 --> 01:20:02,000
uh learning as you
 

4247
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:06,229
uh learning as you
move around the world uh notion of 3d

4248
01:20:06,229 --> 01:20:06,239
move around the world uh notion of 3d
 

4249
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:10,390
move around the world uh notion of 3d
so so we we have our

4250
01:20:10,390 --> 01:20:10,400
so so we we have our
 

4251
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:13,910
so so we we have our
succession of visual experiences

4252
01:20:13,910 --> 01:20:13,920
succession of visual experiences
 

4253
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:17,510
succession of visual experiences
and from those we

4254
01:20:17,510 --> 01:20:17,520
and from those we
 

4255
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:19,590
and from those we
so in as part of that i might see a

4256
01:20:19,590 --> 01:20:19,600
so in as part of that i might see a
 

4257
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:21,510
so in as part of that i might see a
chair from different viewpoints

4258
01:20:21,510 --> 01:20:21,520
chair from different viewpoints
 

4259
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:23,110
chair from different viewpoints
or a table from viewpoint different

4260
01:20:23,110 --> 01:20:23,120
or a table from viewpoint different
 

4261
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:24,709
or a table from viewpoint different
viewpoints and so on

4262
01:20:24,709 --> 01:20:24,719
viewpoints and so on
 

4263
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:28,629
viewpoints and so on
now as part that enables me to build

4264
01:20:28,629 --> 01:20:28,639
now as part that enables me to build
 

4265
01:20:28,639 --> 01:20:31,750
now as part that enables me to build
some internal representation and then

4266
01:20:31,750 --> 01:20:31,760
some internal representation and then
 

4267
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:33,430
some internal representation and then
next time i just see

4268
01:20:33,430 --> 01:20:33,440
next time i just see
 

4269
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:36,070
next time i just see
a single photograph and it may not even

4270
01:20:36,070 --> 01:20:36,080
a single photograph and it may not even
 

4271
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:37,910
a single photograph and it may not even
be of that chair it's of some other

4272
01:20:37,910 --> 01:20:37,920
be of that chair it's of some other
 

4273
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:38,709
be of that chair it's of some other
chair

4274
01:20:38,709 --> 01:20:38,719
chair
 

4275
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:41,590
chair
and i have a guess of what its 3d shape

4276
01:20:41,590 --> 01:20:41,600
and i have a guess of what its 3d shape
 

4277
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:41,990
and i have a guess of what its 3d shape
is like

4278
01:20:41,990 --> 01:20:42,000
is like
 

4279
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,950
is like
so you're almost learning the cad model

4280
01:20:44,950 --> 01:20:44,960
so you're almost learning the cad model
 

4281
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:45,510
so you're almost learning the cad model
kind of

4282
01:20:45,510 --> 01:20:45,520
kind of
 

4283
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:47,750
kind of
yeah implicitly i mean implicitly i mean

4284
01:20:47,750 --> 01:20:47,760
yeah implicitly i mean implicitly i mean
 

4285
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,750
yeah implicitly i mean implicitly i mean
the cad model need not be in the same

4286
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:49,760
the cad model need not be in the same
 

4287
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:50,390
the cad model need not be in the same
form as

4288
01:20:50,390 --> 01:20:50,400
form as
 

4289
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:52,870
form as

it's hidden in the representation the

01:20:55,430 --> 01:20:55,440
it's hidden in the representation the
 

4295
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:57,990
it's hidden in the representation the
ability to predict new views

achieve this kind of 3d understanding
 

4315
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:21,590
achieve this kind of 3d understanding
and you don't know how they you don't

4316
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:21,600
and you don't know how they you don't
 

4317
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:22,470
and you don't know how they you don't
know

4318
01:21:22,470 --> 01:21:22,480
know
 

4319
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:25,270
know
the rep you're not able to interest but

4320
01:21:25,270 --> 01:21:25,280
the rep you're not able to interest but
 

4321
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:26,629
the rep you're not able to interest but
you're not able to

4322
01:21:26,629 --> 01:21:26,639
you're not able to
 

4323
01:21:26,639 --> 01:21:29,110
you're not able to
visualize or understand or interact with

4324
01:21:29,110 --> 01:21:29,120
visualize or understand or interact with
 

4325
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:30,950
visualize or understand or interact with
the representation

4326
01:21:30,950 --> 01:21:30,960
the representation
 

4327
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:33,590
the representation
so the fact that they're not or may not

4328
01:21:33,590 --> 01:21:33,600
so the fact that they're not or may not
 

4329
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:35,590
so the fact that they're not or may not
be explainable

4330
01:21:35,590 --> 01:21:35,600
be explainable
 

4331
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:39,110
be explainable
yeah i think that's fine i to me that is

4332
01:21:39,110 --> 01:21:39,120
yeah i think that's fine i to me that is
 

4333
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:39,669
yeah i think that's fine i to me that is
uh

4334
01:21:39,669 --> 01:21:39,679
uh
 

4335
01:21:39,679 --> 01:21:44,310
uh
so so let me put some caveats on that

4336
01:21:44,310 --> 01:21:44,320
so so let me put some caveats on that
 

4337
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:46,870
so so let me put some caveats on that
so it depends on the setting so first of

4338
01:21:46,870 --> 01:21:46,880
so it depends on the setting so first of
 

4339
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:48,070
so it depends on the setting so first of
all i think

4340
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:48,080
all i think
 

4341
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:51,990
all i think
uh uh the

4342
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:52,000
uh uh the
 

4343
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,350
uh uh the
uh humans are not explainable

4344
01:21:55,350 --> 01:21:55,360
uh humans are not explainable
 

4345
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:56,950
uh humans are not explainable
so yeah that's a really good point yeah

4346
01:21:56,950 --> 01:21:56,960
so yeah that's a really good point yeah
 

4347
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:59,030
so yeah that's a really good point yeah
so we we

4348
01:21:59,030 --> 01:21:59,040
so we we
 

4349
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,950
so we we
one human to another human is not fully

4350
01:22:00,950 --> 01:22:00,960
one human to another human is not fully
 

4351
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,629
one human to another human is not fully
explainable

4352
01:22:02,629 --> 01:22:02,639
explainable
 

4353
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:04,550
explainable
i think there are settings where

4354
01:22:04,550 --> 01:22:04,560
i think there are settings where
 

4355
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:06,629
i think there are settings where
explainability matters

4356
01:22:06,629 --> 01:22:06,639
explainability matters
 

4357
01:22:06,639 --> 01:22:09,830
explainability matters
and these might these are these might be

4358
01:22:09,830 --> 01:22:09,840
and these might these are these might be
 

4359
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:11,350
and these might these are these might be
for example questions on medical

4360
01:22:11,350 --> 01:22:11,360
for example questions on medical
 

4361
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:13,350
for example questions on medical
diagnosis

4362
01:22:13,350 --> 01:22:13,360
diagnosis
 

4363
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:16,390
diagnosis
so i'm in a setting where

4364
01:22:16,390 --> 01:22:16,400
so i'm in a setting where
 

4365
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:18,229
so i'm in a setting where
maybe the doctor maybe a computer

4366
01:22:18,229 --> 01:22:18,239
maybe the doctor maybe a computer
 

4367
01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:21,189
maybe the doctor maybe a computer
program has made a certain diagnosis

4368
01:22:21,189 --> 01:22:21,199
program has made a certain diagnosis
 

4369
01:22:21,199 --> 01:22:23,590
program has made a certain diagnosis
and then depending on the diagnosis

4370
01:22:23,590 --> 01:22:23,600
and then depending on the diagnosis
 

4371
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:25,270
and then depending on the diagnosis
perhaps i should have treatment day or

4372
01:22:25,270 --> 01:22:25,280
perhaps i should have treatment day or
 

4373
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:27,110
perhaps i should have treatment day or
treatment b

4374
01:22:27,110 --> 01:22:27,120
treatment b
 

4375
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:31,590
treatment b
right so now is the computer programs

4376
01:22:31,590 --> 01:22:31,600
right so now is the computer programs
 

4377
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:35,030
right so now is the computer programs
diagnosis based on data

4378
01:22:35,030 --> 01:22:35,040
diagnosis based on data
 

4379
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:38,470
diagnosis based on data
which was data collected of

4380
01:22:38,470 --> 01:22:38,480
which was data collected of
 

4381
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:40,950
which was data collected of
for american males who are in their 30s

4382
01:22:40,950 --> 01:22:40,960
for american males who are in their 30s
 

4383
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:42,070
for american males who are in their 30s
and 40s

4384
01:22:42,070 --> 01:22:42,080
and 40s
 

4385
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:45,189
and 40s
and maybe not so relevant to me

4386
01:22:45,189 --> 01:22:45,199
and maybe not so relevant to me
 

4387
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:47,830
and maybe not so relevant to me
maybe it is relevant you know et cetera

4388
01:22:47,830 --> 01:22:47,840
maybe it is relevant you know et cetera
 

4389
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:49,270
maybe it is relevant you know et cetera
et cetera and we i mean in

4390
01:22:49,270 --> 01:22:49,280
et cetera and we i mean in
 

4391
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:51,430
et cetera and we i mean in
medical diagnosis we have major issues

4392
01:22:51,430 --> 01:22:51,440
medical diagnosis we have major issues
 

4393
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:53,350
medical diagnosis we have major issues
to do with the reference class

4394
01:22:53,350 --> 01:22:53,360
to do with the reference class
 

4395
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:55,510
to do with the reference class
so we may have acquired statistics from

4396
01:22:55,510 --> 01:22:55,520
so we may have acquired statistics from
 

4397
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:58,149
so we may have acquired statistics from
one group of people and applying it to

4398
01:22:58,149 --> 01:22:58,159
one group of people and applying it to
 

4399
01:22:58,159 --> 01:23:00,149
one group of people and applying it to
a different group of people who may not

4400
01:23:00,149 --> 01:23:00,159
a different group of people who may not
 

4401
01:23:00,159 --> 01:23:02,709
a different group of people who may not
share all the same characteristics

4402
01:23:02,709 --> 01:23:02,719
share all the same characteristics
 

4403
01:23:02,719 --> 01:23:05,830
share all the same characteristics
the data might have there might be error

4404
01:23:05,830 --> 01:23:05,840
the data might have there might be error
 

4405
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:07,350
the data might have there might be error
bars in the prediction

4406
01:23:07,350 --> 01:23:07,360
bars in the prediction
 

4407
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:09,590
bars in the prediction
so that prediction should really be

4408
01:23:09,590 --> 01:23:09,600
so that prediction should really be
 

4409
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:10,950
so that prediction should really be
taken with

4410
01:23:10,950 --> 01:23:10,960
taken with
 

4411
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:14,550
taken with
a huge grain of salt and but this has an

4412
01:23:14,550 --> 01:23:14,560
a huge grain of salt and but this has an
 

4413
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:17,030
a huge grain of salt and but this has an
impact on what treatments

4414
01:23:17,030 --> 01:23:17,040
impact on what treatments
 

4415
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:20,229
impact on what treatments
should be picked right so

4416
01:23:20,229 --> 01:23:20,239
should be picked right so
 

4417
01:23:20,239 --> 01:23:22,629
should be picked right so
so there are settings where i want to

4418
01:23:22,629 --> 01:23:22,639
so there are settings where i want to
 

4419
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:24,790
so there are settings where i want to
know more than just

4420
01:23:24,790 --> 01:23:24,800
know more than just
 

4421
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:27,990
know more than just
this is the answer but what i

4422
01:23:27,990 --> 01:23:28,000
this is the answer but what i
 

4423
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,830
this is the answer but what i
acknowledge is that

4424
01:23:29,830 --> 01:23:29,840
acknowledge is that
 

4425
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:31,990
acknowledge is that
so so so so i in that sense

4426
01:23:31,990 --> 01:23:32,000
so so so so i in that sense
 

4427
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,070
so so so so i in that sense
explainability and interpretability may

4428
01:23:34,070 --> 01:23:34,080
explainability and interpretability may
 

4429
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:34,790
explainability and interpretability may
matter

4430
01:23:34,790 --> 01:23:34,800
matter
 

4431
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:37,590
matter
it's about giving error bounds and a

4432
01:23:37,590 --> 01:23:37,600
it's about giving error bounds and a
 

4433
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,430
it's about giving error bounds and a
better sense of the quality of the

4434
01:23:39,430 --> 01:23:39,440
better sense of the quality of the
 

4435
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:41,270
better sense of the quality of the
decision

4436
01:23:41,270 --> 01:23:41,280
decision
 

4437
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:44,790
decision
where what i where i'm willing to

4438
01:23:44,790 --> 01:23:44,800
where what i where i'm willing to
 

4439
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:47,270
where what i where i'm willing to
sacrifice interpretability is that

4440
01:23:47,270 --> 01:23:47,280
sacrifice interpretability is that
 

4441
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:49,910
sacrifice interpretability is that
i believe that there can be systems

4442
01:23:49,910 --> 01:23:49,920
i believe that there can be systems
 

4443
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:52,070
i believe that there can be systems
which can be highly performant but which

4444
01:23:52,070 --> 01:23:52,080
which can be highly performant but which
 

4445
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:53,830
which can be highly performant but which
are internally

4446
01:23:53,830 --> 01:23:53,840
are internally
 

4447
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:56,950
are internally
black boxes and and that seems to be

4448
01:23:56,950 --> 01:23:56,960
black boxes and and that seems to be
 

4449
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:58,950
black boxes and and that seems to be
words headed some of the best performing

4450
01:23:58,950 --> 01:23:58,960
words headed some of the best performing
 

4451
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:01,270
words headed some of the best performing
systems are essentially black boxes yeah

4452
01:24:01,270 --> 01:24:01,280
systems are essentially black boxes yeah
 

4453
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:01,990
systems are essentially black boxes yeah
uh

4454
01:24:01,990 --> 01:24:02,000
uh
 

4455
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,229
uh
fundamentally by their construction you

4456
01:24:04,229 --> 01:24:04,239
fundamentally by their construction you
 

4457
01:24:04,239 --> 01:24:05,030
fundamentally by their construction you
and i are

4458
01:24:05,030 --> 01:24:05,040
and i are
 

4459
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:07,110
and i are
black boxes to each other yeah so the

4460
01:24:07,110 --> 01:24:07,120
black boxes to each other yeah so the
 

4461
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:10,550
black boxes to each other yeah so the
nice thing about the black boxes we are

4462
01:24:10,550 --> 01:24:10,560
nice thing about the black boxes we are
 

4463
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:13,590
nice thing about the black boxes we are
is so we ourselves are black boxes

4464
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:13,600
is so we ourselves are black boxes
 

4465
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:16,709
is so we ourselves are black boxes
but we're also those of us who are

4466
01:24:16,709 --> 01:24:16,719
but we're also those of us who are
 

4467
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:17,750
but we're also those of us who are
charming

4468
01:24:17,750 --> 01:24:17,760
charming
 

4469
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:20,550
charming
are able to convince others like explain

4470
01:24:20,550 --> 01:24:20,560
are able to convince others like explain
 

4471
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:21,510
are able to convince others like explain
the black

4472
01:24:21,510 --> 01:24:21,520
the black
 

4473
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:23,270
the black
what's going on inside the black box

4474
01:24:23,270 --> 01:24:23,280
what's going on inside the black box
 

4475
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:25,189
what's going on inside the black box
with narratives with stories

4476
01:24:25,189 --> 01:24:25,199
with narratives with stories
 

4477
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:27,669
with narratives with stories
so in some sense uh neural networks

4478
01:24:27,669 --> 01:24:27,679
so in some sense uh neural networks
 

4479
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:28,830
so in some sense uh neural networks
don't have to actually

4480
01:24:28,830 --> 01:24:28,840
don't have to actually
 

4481
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:31,830
don't have to actually
explain what's going on inside they just

4482
01:24:31,830 --> 01:24:31,840
explain what's going on inside they just
 

4483
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,669
explain what's going on inside they just
have to come up with stories real or

4484
01:24:33,669 --> 01:24:33,679
have to come up with stories real or
 

4485
01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:34,070
have to come up with stories real or
fake

4486
01:24:34,070 --> 01:24:34,080
fake
 

4487
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:37,110
fake
that convince you that they know what's

4488
01:24:37,110 --> 01:24:37,120
that convince you that they know what's
 

4489
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:38,229
that convince you that they know what's
going on

4490
01:24:38,229 --> 01:24:38,239
going on
 

4491
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:40,310
going on
and i'm sure we can do that we can

4492
01:24:40,310 --> 01:24:40,320
and i'm sure we can do that we can
 

4493
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:41,430
and i'm sure we can do that we can
create those nearer

4494
01:24:41,430 --> 01:24:41,440
create those nearer
 

4495
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:43,510
create those nearer
those stories neural networks can create

4496
01:24:43,510 --> 01:24:43,520
those stories neural networks can create
 

4497
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:47,270
those stories neural networks can create
those stories yeah

4498
01:24:47,270 --> 01:24:47,280

 

4499
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:50,070

and the transformer will be involved do

4500
01:24:50,070 --> 01:24:50,080
and the transformer will be involved do
 

4501
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:52,310
and the transformer will be involved do
you think we will ever

4502
01:24:52,310 --> 01:24:52,320
you think we will ever
 

4503
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:54,629
you think we will ever
build a system of human level or

4504
01:24:54,629 --> 01:24:54,639
build a system of human level or
 

4505
01:24:54,639 --> 01:24:56,310
build a system of human level or
superhuman level intelligence

4506
01:24:56,310 --> 01:24:56,320
superhuman level intelligence
 

4507
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:58,629
superhuman level intelligence
we've kind of defined what it takes to

4508
01:24:58,629 --> 01:24:58,639
we've kind of defined what it takes to
 

4509
01:24:58,639 --> 01:25:00,470
we've kind of defined what it takes to
try to approach that but do you think

4510
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:00,480
try to approach that but do you think
 

4511
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:01,110
try to approach that but do you think
we'll

4512
01:25:01,110 --> 01:25:01,120
we'll
 

4513
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:02,629
we'll
do you think that's within our reach the

4514
01:25:02,629 --> 01:25:02,639
do you think that's within our reach the
 

4515
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:04,390
do you think that's within our reach the
thing that we thought we could do

4516
01:25:04,390 --> 01:25:04,400
thing that we thought we could do
 

4517
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:06,550
thing that we thought we could do
what touring thought actually we could

4518
01:25:06,550 --> 01:25:06,560
what touring thought actually we could
 

4519
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,229
what touring thought actually we could
do by a year 2000

4520
01:25:08,229 --> 01:25:08,239
do by a year 2000
 

4521
01:25:08,239 --> 01:25:10,149
do by a year 2000
right what do you think we'll ever be

4522
01:25:10,149 --> 01:25:10,159
right what do you think we'll ever be
 

4523
01:25:10,159 --> 01:25:11,350
right what do you think we'll ever be
able to do so

4524
01:25:11,350 --> 01:25:11,360
able to do so
 

4525
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:12,870
able to do so
i think there are two answers here one

4526
01:25:12,870 --> 01:25:12,880
i think there are two answers here one
 

4527
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:14,470
i think there are two answers here one
question one answer is

4528
01:25:14,470 --> 01:25:14,480
question one answer is
 

4529
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:17,910
question one answer is
in principle can we do this at some time

4530
01:25:17,910 --> 01:25:17,920
in principle can we do this at some time
 

4531
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:21,830
in principle can we do this at some time
and my answer is yes the second

4532
01:25:21,830 --> 01:25:21,840
and my answer is yes the second
 

4533
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:23,910
and my answer is yes the second
answer is a pragmatic one do you think

4534
01:25:23,910 --> 01:25:23,920
answer is a pragmatic one do you think
 

4535
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:25,750
answer is a pragmatic one do you think
we will be able to do it in the next 20

4536
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:25,760
we will be able to do it in the next 20
 

4537
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:26,229
we will be able to do it in the next 20
years

4538
01:25:26,229 --> 01:25:26,239
years
 

4539
01:25:26,239 --> 01:25:30,229
years
or whatever and to that man says no

4540
01:25:30,229 --> 01:25:30,239
or whatever and to that man says no
 

4541
01:25:30,239 --> 01:25:33,669
or whatever and to that man says no
so and of course that's a wild guess i i

4542
01:25:33,669 --> 01:25:33,679
so and of course that's a wild guess i i
 

4543
01:25:33,679 --> 01:25:37,110
so and of course that's a wild guess i i
i i think that

4544
01:25:37,110 --> 01:25:37,120
i i think that
 

4545
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:38,709
i i think that
you know donald trump's felt is not a

4546
01:25:38,709 --> 01:25:38,719
you know donald trump's felt is not a
 

4547
01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:40,390
you know donald trump's felt is not a
favorite person of mine but

4548
01:25:40,390 --> 01:25:40,400
favorite person of mine but
 

4549
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:42,550
favorite person of mine but
one of his lines is very good which is

4550
01:25:42,550 --> 01:25:42,560
one of his lines is very good which is
 

4551
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:43,590
one of his lines is very good which is
about

4552
01:25:43,590 --> 01:25:43,600
about
 

4553
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:46,870
about
known knowns known unknowns and unknown

4554
01:25:46,870 --> 01:25:46,880
known knowns known unknowns and unknown
 

4555
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:48,070
known knowns known unknowns and unknown
unknowns

4556
01:25:48,070 --> 01:25:48,080
unknowns
 

4557
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:51,110
unknowns
so in the business we are in

4558
01:25:51,110 --> 01:25:51,120
so in the business we are in
 

4559
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:53,590
so in the business we are in
there are known unknowns and we have

4560
01:25:53,590 --> 01:25:53,600
there are known unknowns and we have
 

4561
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:54,870
there are known unknowns and we have
unknown unknowns

4562
01:25:54,870 --> 01:25:54,880
unknown unknowns
 

4563
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:57,990
unknown unknowns
so i think with respect to

4564
01:25:57,990 --> 01:25:58,000
so i think with respect to
 

4565
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:01,590
so i think with respect to
a lot of what the case in

4566
01:26:01,590 --> 01:26:01,600
a lot of what the case in
 

4567
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:04,709
a lot of what the case in
vision and robotics i feel like

4568
01:26:04,709 --> 01:26:04,719
vision and robotics i feel like
 

4569
01:26:04,719 --> 01:26:07,910
vision and robotics i feel like
we have known unknowns so i have a sense

4570
01:26:07,910 --> 01:26:07,920
we have known unknowns so i have a sense
 

4571
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:09,590
we have known unknowns so i have a sense
of where we need to go

4572
01:26:09,590 --> 01:26:09,600
of where we need to go
 

4573
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:11,350
of where we need to go
and what the problems that need to be

4574
01:26:11,350 --> 01:26:11,360
and what the problems that need to be
 

4575
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:13,430
and what the problems that need to be
solved are

4576
01:26:13,430 --> 01:26:13,440
solved are
 

4577
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:17,030
solved are
i feel with respect to natural language

4578
01:26:17,030 --> 01:26:17,040
i feel with respect to natural language
 

4579
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:20,390
i feel with respect to natural language
understanding and high level cognition

4580
01:26:20,390 --> 01:26:20,400
understanding and high level cognition
 

4581
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:22,550
understanding and high level cognition
it's not just known unknowns but also

4582
01:26:22,550 --> 01:26:22,560
it's not just known unknowns but also
 

4583
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:23,990
it's not just known unknowns but also
unknown unknowns

4584
01:26:23,990 --> 01:26:24,000
unknown unknowns
 

4585
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,229
unknown unknowns
so it is very difficult to put any kind

4586
01:26:26,229 --> 01:26:26,239
so it is very difficult to put any kind
 

4587
01:26:26,239 --> 01:26:27,510
so it is very difficult to put any kind
of uh

4588
01:26:27,510 --> 01:26:27,520
of uh
 

4589
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:31,350
of uh
time frame to that uh do you think some

4590
01:26:31,350 --> 01:26:31,360
time frame to that uh do you think some
 

4591
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:31,830
time frame to that uh do you think some
of the

4592
01:26:31,830 --> 01:26:31,840
of the
 

4593
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:35,030
of the
unknown unknowns might be positive in

4594
01:26:35,030 --> 01:26:35,040
unknown unknowns might be positive in
 

4595
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:37,110
unknown unknowns might be positive in
that they'll surprise us and make the

4596
01:26:37,110 --> 01:26:37,120
that they'll surprise us and make the
 

4597
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:38,470
that they'll surprise us and make the
job much easier

4598
01:26:38,470 --> 01:26:38,480
job much easier
 

4599
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:40,390
job much easier
so fundamental breakthroughs i think

4600
01:26:40,390 --> 01:26:40,400
so fundamental breakthroughs i think
 

4601
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:42,310
so fundamental breakthroughs i think
that is possible because certainly i

4602
01:26:42,310 --> 01:26:42,320
that is possible because certainly i
 

4603
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:42,790
that is possible because certainly i
have

4604
01:26:42,790 --> 01:26:42,800
have
 

4605
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:45,910
have
been very positively surprised by how

4606
01:26:45,910 --> 01:26:45,920
been very positively surprised by how
 

4607
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:49,030
been very positively surprised by how
effective these deep learning systems

4608
01:26:49,030 --> 01:26:49,040
effective these deep learning systems
 

4609
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:50,470
effective these deep learning systems
have been because

4610
01:26:50,470 --> 01:26:50,480
have been because
 

4611
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:54,229
have been because
i certainly would not have believed that

4612
01:26:54,229 --> 01:26:54,239
i certainly would not have believed that
 

4613
01:26:54,239 --> 01:26:54,629
i certainly would not have believed that
in

4614
01:26:54,629 --> 01:26:54,639
in
 

4615
01:26:54,639 --> 01:27:00,070
in
2010 i think

4616
01:27:00,070 --> 01:27:00,080

 

4617
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:02,229

what we knew from the mathematical

4618
01:27:02,229 --> 01:27:02,239
what we knew from the mathematical
 

4619
01:27:02,239 --> 01:27:03,750
what we knew from the mathematical
theory

4620
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:03,760
theory
 

4621
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:06,070
theory
was that convex optimization works when

4622
01:27:06,070 --> 01:27:06,080
was that convex optimization works when
 

4623
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:08,709
was that convex optimization works when
there's a single global optima then

4624
01:27:08,709 --> 01:27:08,719
there's a single global optima then
 

4625
01:27:08,719 --> 01:27:10,310
there's a single global optima then
these gradient descent techniques would

4626
01:27:10,310 --> 01:27:10,320
these gradient descent techniques would
 

4627
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:12,550
these gradient descent techniques would
work now these are

4628
01:27:12,550 --> 01:27:12,560
work now these are
 

4629
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:15,350
work now these are
non-linear systems with non-convex

4630
01:27:15,350 --> 01:27:15,360
non-linear systems with non-convex
 

4631
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:15,910
non-linear systems with non-convex
systems

4632
01:27:15,910 --> 01:27:15,920
systems
 

4633
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:17,189
systems
huge number of variables so

4634
01:27:17,189 --> 01:27:17,199
huge number of variables so
 

4635
01:27:17,199 --> 01:27:19,750
huge number of variables so
over-parametrized over-parameterized

4636
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:19,760
over-parametrized over-parameterized
 

4637
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:23,030
over-parametrized over-parameterized
and the people who used to play with

4638
01:27:23,030 --> 01:27:23,040
and the people who used to play with
 

4639
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:24,470
and the people who used to play with
them a lot

4640
01:27:24,470 --> 01:27:24,480
them a lot
 

4641
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:26,709
them a lot
the ones who are totally immersed in the

4642
01:27:26,709 --> 01:27:26,719
the ones who are totally immersed in the
 

4643
01:27:26,719 --> 01:27:27,669
the ones who are totally immersed in the
lore and the

4644
01:27:27,669 --> 01:27:27,679
lore and the
 

4645
01:27:27,679 --> 01:27:31,110
lore and the
black magic they knew that they worked

4646
01:27:31,110 --> 01:27:31,120
black magic they knew that they worked
 

4647
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:34,229
black magic they knew that they worked
uh well even though they were really

4648
01:27:34,229 --> 01:27:34,239
uh well even though they were really
 

4649
01:27:34,239 --> 01:27:37,030
uh well even though they were really
i thought like everybody no the claim

4650
01:27:37,030 --> 01:27:37,040
i thought like everybody no the claim
 

4651
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:37,350
i thought like everybody no the claim
that

4652
01:27:37,350 --> 01:27:37,360
that
 

4653
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:40,629
that
i hear from my friends like yan lacoon

4654
01:27:40,629 --> 01:27:40,639
i hear from my friends like yan lacoon
 

4655
01:27:40,639 --> 01:27:41,510
i hear from my friends like yan lacoon
and so forth

4656
01:27:41,510 --> 01:27:41,520
and so forth
 

4657
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:44,070
and so forth
now yeah that they feel that they were

4658
01:27:44,070 --> 01:27:44,080
now yeah that they feel that they were
 

4659
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:45,669
now yeah that they feel that they were
comfortable with them

4660
01:27:45,669 --> 01:27:45,679
comfortable with them
 

4661
01:27:45,679 --> 01:27:47,350
comfortable with them
well he says but the community as a

4662
01:27:47,350 --> 01:27:47,360
well he says but the community as a
 

4663
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:48,790
well he says but the community as a
whole

4664
01:27:48,790 --> 01:27:48,800
whole
 

4665
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:52,229
whole
was certainly not and i think uh

4666
01:27:52,229 --> 01:27:52,239
was certainly not and i think uh
 

4667
01:27:52,239 --> 01:27:55,510
was certainly not and i think uh
we were to me that was the surprise that

4668
01:27:55,510 --> 01:27:55,520
we were to me that was the surprise that
 

4669
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:58,629
we were to me that was the surprise that
they actually worked robustly

4670
01:27:58,629 --> 01:27:58,639
they actually worked robustly
 

4671
01:27:58,639 --> 01:28:01,669
they actually worked robustly
for a wide range of problems from a wide

4672
01:28:01,669 --> 01:28:01,679
for a wide range of problems from a wide
 

4673
01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:04,550
for a wide range of problems from a wide
range of initializations and so on

4674
01:28:04,550 --> 01:28:04,560
range of initializations and so on
 

4675
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:07,510
range of initializations and so on
and uh so that was that that was

4676
01:28:07,510 --> 01:28:07,520
and uh so that was that that was
 

4677
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:09,189
and uh so that was that that was
certainly

4678
01:28:09,189 --> 01:28:09,199
certainly
 

4679
01:28:09,199 --> 01:28:13,430
certainly
more rapid progress than uh we expected

4680
01:28:13,430 --> 01:28:13,440
more rapid progress than uh we expected
 

4681
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:15,030
more rapid progress than uh we expected
but then there are certainly lots of

4682
01:28:15,030 --> 01:28:15,040
but then there are certainly lots of
 

4683
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:16,709
but then there are certainly lots of
times in fact

4684
01:28:16,709 --> 01:28:16,719
times in fact
 

4685
01:28:16,719 --> 01:28:19,590
times in fact
most of the history and fear is when we

4686
01:28:19,590 --> 01:28:19,600
most of the history and fear is when we
 

4687
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:20,870
most of the history and fear is when we
have made less pro

4688
01:28:20,870 --> 01:28:20,880
have made less pro
 

4689
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:22,709
have made less pro
progress at a slower rate than we

4690
01:28:22,709 --> 01:28:22,719
progress at a slower rate than we
 

4691
01:28:22,719 --> 01:28:23,910
progress at a slower rate than we
expected

4692
01:28:23,910 --> 01:28:23,920
expected
 

4693
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:27,430
expected
so uh we just keep going

4694
01:28:27,430 --> 01:28:27,440
so uh we just keep going
 

4695
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:31,430
so uh we just keep going
i think uh what i regard as

4696
01:28:31,430 --> 01:28:31,440
i think uh what i regard as
 

4697
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:35,030
i think uh what i regard as
uh really unwarranted are these

4698
01:28:35,030 --> 01:28:35,040
uh really unwarranted are these
 

4699
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:38,550
uh really unwarranted are these
these fears of uh you know agi in 10

4700
01:28:38,550 --> 01:28:38,560
these fears of uh you know agi in 10
 

4701
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:40,070
these fears of uh you know agi in 10
years and 20 years and

4702
01:28:40,070 --> 01:28:40,080
years and 20 years and
 

4703
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:42,229
years and 20 years and
that kind of stuff because that's based

4704
01:28:42,229 --> 01:28:42,239
that kind of stuff because that's based
 

4705
01:28:42,239 --> 01:28:45,110
that kind of stuff because that's based
on completely unrealistic models of how

4706
01:28:45,110 --> 01:28:45,120
on completely unrealistic models of how
 

4707
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:47,110
on completely unrealistic models of how
rapidly we will make progress in this

4708
01:28:47,110 --> 01:28:47,120
rapidly we will make progress in this
 

4709
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:51,669
rapidly we will make progress in this
field so i agree with you but i've also

4710
01:28:51,669 --> 01:28:51,679
field so i agree with you but i've also
 

4711
01:28:51,679 --> 01:28:53,990
field so i agree with you but i've also
gotten a chance to interact with very

4712
01:28:53,990 --> 01:28:54,000
gotten a chance to interact with very
 

4713
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,669
gotten a chance to interact with very
smart people who really worry about the

4714
01:28:55,669 --> 01:28:55,679
smart people who really worry about the
 

4715
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:57,510
smart people who really worry about the
existential threats of ai

4716
01:28:57,510 --> 01:28:57,520
existential threats of ai
 

4717
01:28:57,520 --> 01:28:59,990
existential threats of ai
and i as an open-minded person and sort

of taking

4720
01:29:01,030 --> 01:29:01,040
of taking
 

4721
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:06,070
of taking

4722
01:29:06,070 --> 01:29:06,080
and taking it in do you think
 

4723
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:10,470
and taking it in do you think
if ai systems in some way the unknown

4724

if ai systems in some way the unknown

unknowns
 

4727
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:13,510
unknowns
not super intelligent ai but in ways we

4728
01:29:13,510 --> 01:29:13,520
not super intelligent ai but in ways we
 

4729
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:14,950
not super intelligent ai but in ways we
don't quite understand

01:29:14,950 --> 01:29:14,960
don't quite understand
 

4731
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:17,590
don't quite understand
uh the nature of superintelligence will

4732
01:29:17,590 --> 01:29:17,600
uh the nature of superintelligence will
 

4733
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:20,070
uh the nature of superintelligence will
have a detrimental effect on society

4734
01:29:20,070 --> 01:29:20,080
have a detrimental effect on society
 

4735
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:21,669
have a detrimental effect on society
do you think this is something we should

4736
01:29:21,669 --> 01:29:21,679
do you think this is something we should
 

4737
01:29:21,679 --> 01:29:23,990
do you think this is something we should
be worried about

4738
01:29:23,990 --> 01:29:24,000
be worried about
 

4739
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,310
be worried about
or we need to first allow the unknown

4740
01:29:26,310 --> 01:29:26,320
or we need to first allow the unknown
 

4741
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:27,910
or we need to first allow the unknown
our nose to become

4742
01:29:27,910 --> 01:29:27,920
our nose to become
 

4743
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:30,790
our nose to become
known unknowns i think we need to be

4744
01:29:30,790 --> 01:29:30,800
known unknowns i think we need to be
 

4745
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:32,870
known unknowns i think we need to be
worried about ai today

4746
01:29:32,870 --> 01:29:32,880
worried about ai today
 

4747
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:35,189
worried about ai today
i think that it is not just a worry we

4748
01:29:35,189 --> 01:29:35,199
i think that it is not just a worry we
 

4749
01:29:35,199 --> 01:29:37,189
i think that it is not just a worry we
need to have when we get that

4750
01:29:37,189 --> 01:29:37,199
need to have when we get that
 

4751
01:29:37,199 --> 01:29:40,870
need to have when we get that
agi i think that ai is being used in

4752
01:29:40,870 --> 01:29:40,880
agi i think that ai is being used in
 

4753
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:42,950
agi i think that ai is being used in
many systems today

4754
01:29:42,950 --> 01:29:42,960
many systems today
 

4755
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:45,110
many systems today
and there might be settings for example

4756
01:29:45,110 --> 01:29:45,120
and there might be settings for example
 

4757
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:46,149
and there might be settings for example
when it causes

4758
01:29:46,149 --> 01:29:46,159
when it causes
 

4759
01:29:46,159 --> 01:29:49,750
when it causes
biases or decisions which could

4760
01:29:49,750 --> 01:29:49,760
biases or decisions which could
 

4761
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:52,070
biases or decisions which could
be harmful i mean decisions which could

4762
01:29:52,070 --> 01:29:52,080
be harmful i mean decisions which could
 

4763
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:53,830
be harmful i mean decisions which could
be unfair to some people

4764
01:29:53,830 --> 01:29:53,840
be unfair to some people
 

4765
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:55,910
be unfair to some people
or it could be a self-driving cars which

4766
01:29:55,910 --> 01:29:55,920
or it could be a self-driving cars which
 

4767
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:57,590
or it could be a self-driving cars which
kills a pedestrian

4768
01:29:57,590 --> 01:29:57,600
kills a pedestrian
 

4769
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:01,430
kills a pedestrian
so ai systems are being deployed today

4770
01:30:01,430 --> 01:30:01,440
so ai systems are being deployed today
 

4771
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:03,030
so ai systems are being deployed today
right and they're being deployed in many

4772
01:30:03,030 --> 01:30:03,040
right and they're being deployed in many
 

4773
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:04,470
right and they're being deployed in many
different settings maybe in medical

4774
01:30:04,470 --> 01:30:04,480
different settings maybe in medical
 

4775
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:06,550
different settings maybe in medical
diagnosis maybe in a self-driving car

4776
01:30:06,550 --> 01:30:06,560
diagnosis maybe in a self-driving car
 

4777
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:07,430
diagnosis maybe in a self-driving car
maybe

4778
01:30:07,430 --> 01:30:07,440
maybe
 

4779
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:09,830
maybe
in selecting applicants for an interview

4780
01:30:09,830 --> 01:30:09,840
in selecting applicants for an interview
 

4781
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:10,470
in selecting applicants for an interview
so

4782
01:30:10,470 --> 01:30:10,480
so
 

4783
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:14,070
so
i would argue that when these systems

4784
01:30:14,070 --> 01:30:14,080
i would argue that when these systems
 

4785
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:17,910
i would argue that when these systems
make mistakes there are consequences

4786
01:30:17,910 --> 01:30:17,920
make mistakes there are consequences
 

4787
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:19,910
make mistakes there are consequences
and we are in a certain sense

4788
01:30:19,910 --> 01:30:19,920
and we are in a certain sense
 

4789
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:22,629
and we are in a certain sense
responsible for those consequences

4790
01:30:22,629 --> 01:30:22,639
responsible for those consequences
 

4791
01:30:22,639 --> 01:30:24,950
responsible for those consequences
so i would argue that this is a

4792
01:30:24,950 --> 01:30:24,960
so i would argue that this is a
 

4793
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:26,870
so i would argue that this is a
continuous effort

4794
01:30:26,870 --> 01:30:26,880
continuous effort
 

4795
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:30,390
continuous effort
it is we and and this is something that

4796
01:30:30,390 --> 01:30:30,400
it is we and and this is something that
 

4797
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:32,790
it is we and and this is something that
in a way is not so surprising it's about

4798
01:30:32,790 --> 01:30:32,800
in a way is not so surprising it's about
 

4799
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:33,830
in a way is not so surprising it's about
all

4800
01:30:33,830 --> 01:30:33,840
all
 

4801
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:35,750
all
engineering and scientific progress

4802
01:30:35,750 --> 01:30:35,760
engineering and scientific progress
 

4803
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:37,270
engineering and scientific progress
which uh

4804
01:30:37,270 --> 01:30:37,280
which uh
 

4805
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:39,830
which uh
great power comes great responsibility

4806
01:30:39,830 --> 01:30:39,840
great power comes great responsibility
 

4807
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:41,990
great power comes great responsibility
so as these systems are deployed we have

4808
01:30:41,990 --> 01:30:42,000
so as these systems are deployed we have
 

4809
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,110
so as these systems are deployed we have
to worry about them and

4810
01:30:43,110 --> 01:30:43,120
to worry about them and
 

4811
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:45,430
to worry about them and
it's a continuous problem i don't think

4812
01:30:45,430 --> 01:30:45,440
it's a continuous problem i don't think
 

4813
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:46,950
it's a continuous problem i don't think
of it as something

4814
01:30:46,950 --> 01:30:46,960
of it as something
 

4815
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:49,430
of it as something
which will suddenly happen on some day

4816
01:30:49,430 --> 01:30:49,440
which will suddenly happen on some day
 

4817
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:51,270
which will suddenly happen on some day
in 2079

4818
01:30:51,270 --> 01:30:51,280
in 2079
 

4819
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:53,830
in 2079
for which i need to design some clever

4820
01:30:53,830 --> 01:30:53,840
for which i need to design some clever
 

4821
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:54,790
for which i need to design some clever
trick

4822
01:30:54,790 --> 01:30:54,800
trick
 

4823
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:56,950
trick
i'm saying that these problems exist

4824
01:30:56,950 --> 01:30:56,960
i'm saying that these problems exist
 

4825
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:58,149
i'm saying that these problems exist
today yeah

4826
01:30:58,149 --> 01:30:58,159
today yeah
 

4827
01:30:58,159 --> 01:31:00,390
today yeah
and we need to be continuously on the

4828
01:31:00,390 --> 01:31:00,400
and we need to be continuously on the
 

4829
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:02,310
and we need to be continuously on the
lookout for

4830
01:31:02,310 --> 01:31:02,320
lookout for
 

4831
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:06,390
lookout for
worrying about safety biases risks

4832
01:31:06,390 --> 01:31:06,400
worrying about safety biases risks
 

4833
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,790
worrying about safety biases risks
right i mean the self-driving car kills

4834
01:31:08,790 --> 01:31:08,800
right i mean the self-driving car kills
 

4835
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:09,750
right i mean the self-driving car kills
are pedestrian

4836
01:31:09,750 --> 01:31:09,760
are pedestrian
 

4837
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:13,510
are pedestrian
and they have right i mean the this uber

4838
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:13,520
and they have right i mean the this uber
 

4839
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:16,229
and they have right i mean the this uber
incident in arizona yeah right it has

4840
01:31:16,229 --> 01:31:16,239
incident in arizona yeah right it has
 

4841
01:31:16,239 --> 01:31:17,030
incident in arizona yeah right it has
happened

4842
01:31:17,030 --> 01:31:17,040
happened
 

4843
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:20,310
happened
right this is not about agi it in fact

4844
01:31:20,310 --> 01:31:20,320
right this is not about agi it in fact
 

4845
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:22,390
right this is not about agi it in fact
it's about a very dumb intelligence

4846
01:31:22,390 --> 01:31:22,400
it's about a very dumb intelligence
 

4847
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:24,229
it's about a very dumb intelligence
which is also killing people the worry

4848
01:31:24,229 --> 01:31:24,239
which is also killing people the worry
 

4849
01:31:24,239 --> 01:31:25,830
which is also killing people the worry
people have with agi

4850
01:31:25,830 --> 01:31:25,840
people have with agi

01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:14,390
as they get smarter and smarter i mean
that is the agi

01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:17,110
that is the agi
yeah is that's the the algorithm that's

gets into our life it's that algorithm

4926
01:32:45,270 --> 01:32:45,280
gets into our life it's that algorithm
 

4927
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:46,149
gets into our life it's that algorithm
we start

4928
01:32:46,149 --> 01:32:46,159
we start
 

4929
01:32:46,159 --> 01:32:47,430
we start
depending on it in the different

4930
01:32:47,430 --> 01:32:47,440
depending on it in the different
 

4931
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:48,470
depending on it in the different
companies that are working on the

4932
01:32:48,470 --> 01:32:48,480
companies that are working on the
 

4933
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:49,510
companies that are working on the
algorithm so i think it's

4934
01:32:49,510 --> 01:32:49,520
algorithm so i think it's
 

4935
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:52,070
algorithm so i think it's
you're right it's already it's already

4936
01:32:52,070 --> 01:32:52,080
you're right it's already it's already
 

4937
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:52,550
you're right it's already it's already
there

4938
01:32:52,550 --> 01:32:52,560
there
 

4939
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:55,189
there
and youtube in particular is using

4940
01:32:55,189 --> 01:32:55,199
and youtube in particular is using
 

4941
01:32:55,199 --> 01:32:56,950
and youtube in particular is using
computer vision

4942
01:32:56,950 --> 01:32:56,960
computer vision
 

4943
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:59,669
computer vision
doing their hardest to try to understand

4944
01:32:59,669 --> 01:32:59,679
doing their hardest to try to understand
 

4945
01:32:59,679 --> 01:33:02,629
doing their hardest to try to understand
the content of videos so they could

4946
01:33:02,629 --> 01:33:02,639
the content of videos so they could
 

4947
01:33:02,639 --> 01:33:04,950
the content of videos so they could
be able to connect videos with the

4948
01:33:04,950 --> 01:33:04,960
be able to connect videos with the
 

4949
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:06,550
be able to connect videos with the
people who would benefit from those

4950
01:33:06,550 --> 01:33:06,560
people who would benefit from those
 

4951
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:09,830
people who would benefit from those
videos the most and so that development

4952
01:33:09,830 --> 01:33:09,840
videos the most and so that development
 

4953
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:11,510
videos the most and so that development
could go in a bunch of different

4954
01:33:11,510 --> 01:33:11,520
could go in a bunch of different
 

4955
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:13,030
could go in a bunch of different
directions some of which might be

4956
01:33:13,030 --> 01:33:13,040
directions some of which might be
 

4957
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:14,629
directions some of which might be
harmful

4958
01:33:14,629 --> 01:33:14,639
harmful
 

4959
01:33:14,639 --> 01:33:17,510
harmful
so yeah you're right the the the threats

4960
01:33:17,510 --> 01:33:17,520
so yeah you're right the the the threats
 

4961
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:19,030
so yeah you're right the the the threats
of ai are here already we should be

4962
01:33:19,030 --> 01:33:19,040
of ai are here already we should be
 

4963
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:20,950
of ai are here already we should be
thinking about them

4964
01:33:20,950 --> 01:33:20,960
thinking about them
 

4965
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:24,870
thinking about them
on a philosophical notion

4966
01:33:24,870 --> 01:33:24,880
on a philosophical notion
 

4967
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:27,910
on a philosophical notion
if you could personal perhaps

4968
01:33:27,910 --> 01:33:27,920
if you could personal perhaps
 

4969
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:29,350
if you could personal perhaps
if you could relive a moment in your

4970
01:33:29,350 --> 01:33:29,360
if you could relive a moment in your
 

4971
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:31,830
if you could relive a moment in your
life outside of family

4972
01:33:31,830 --> 01:33:31,840
life outside of family
 

4973
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:34,830
life outside of family
because it made you truly happy or was a

4974
01:33:34,830 --> 01:33:34,840
because it made you truly happy or was a
 

4975
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:37,030
because it made you truly happy or was a
profound moment that impacted the

4976
01:33:37,030 --> 01:33:37,040
profound moment that impacted the
 

4977
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:38,790
profound moment that impacted the
direction of your life

4978
01:33:38,790 --> 01:33:38,800
direction of your life
 

4979
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:43,750
direction of your life
what would you go to

4980
01:33:43,750 --> 01:33:43,760

 

4981
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:46,709

i don't think of single moments but i

4982
01:33:46,709 --> 01:33:46,719
i don't think of single moments but i
 

4983
01:33:46,719 --> 01:33:49,189
i don't think of single moments but i
look over the long haul

4984
01:33:49,189 --> 01:33:49,199
look over the long haul
 

4985
01:33:49,199 --> 01:33:52,950
look over the long haul
i feel that i've been very lucky because

4986
01:33:52,950 --> 01:33:52,960
i feel that i've been very lucky because
 

4987
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:56,390
i feel that i've been very lucky because
i feel that i think that in

4988
01:33:56,390 --> 01:33:56,400
i feel that i think that in
 

4989
01:33:56,400 --> 01:34:00,550
i feel that i think that in
scientific research a lot of it is about

4990
01:34:00,550 --> 01:34:00,560
scientific research a lot of it is about
 

4991
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:02,070
scientific research a lot of it is about
being at the right place at the right

4992
01:34:02,070 --> 01:34:02,080
being at the right place at the right
 

4993
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:03,350
being at the right place at the right
time

4994
01:34:03,350 --> 01:34:03,360
time
 

4995
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:06,149
time
and you can you can work on problems at

4996
01:34:06,149 --> 01:34:06,159
and you can you can work on problems at
 

4997
01:34:06,159 --> 01:34:08,310
and you can you can work on problems at
a time when

4998
01:34:08,310 --> 01:34:08,320
a time when
 

4999
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:11,030
a time when
they're just too premature you know you

5000
01:34:11,030 --> 01:34:11,040
they're just too premature you know you
 

5001
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:11,830
they're just too premature you know you
butt your head

5002
01:34:11,830 --> 01:34:11,840
butt your head
 

5003
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:14,470
butt your head
against them and and nothing happens

5004
01:34:14,470 --> 01:34:14,480
against them and and nothing happens
 

5005
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:16,870
against them and and nothing happens
because it's

5006
01:34:16,870 --> 01:34:16,880
because it's
 

5007
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:18,790
because it's
the prerequisites for success are not

5008
01:34:18,790 --> 01:34:18,800
the prerequisites for success are not
 

5009
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:20,870
the prerequisites for success are not
there and then there are times when you

5010
01:34:20,870 --> 01:34:20,880
there and then there are times when you
 

5011
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:22,470
there and then there are times when you
are in a field which is all

5012
01:34:22,470 --> 01:34:22,480
are in a field which is all
 

5013
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:26,950
are in a field which is all
pretty mature and you can only

5014
01:34:26,950 --> 01:34:26,960
pretty mature and you can only
 

5015
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:30,070
pretty mature and you can only
solve curricules upon colloquius i've

5016
01:34:30,070 --> 01:34:30,080
solve curricules upon colloquius i've
 

5017
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:32,229
solve curricules upon colloquius i've
been lucky to have been in this field

5018
01:34:32,229 --> 01:34:32,239
been lucky to have been in this field
 

5019
01:34:32,239 --> 01:34:33,910
been lucky to have been in this field
which

5020
01:34:33,910 --> 01:34:33,920
which
 

5021
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:36,870
which
for 34 years 35 well actually 34 years

5022
01:34:36,870 --> 01:34:36,880
for 34 years 35 well actually 34 years
 

5023
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:38,229
for 34 years 35 well actually 34 years
as a professor at berkeley so

5024
01:34:38,229 --> 01:34:38,239
as a professor at berkeley so
 

5025
01:34:38,239 --> 01:34:41,510
as a professor at berkeley so
longer than that uh which

5026
01:34:41,510 --> 01:34:41,520
longer than that uh which
 

5027
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:44,550
longer than that uh which
when i started in it was just

5028
01:34:44,550 --> 01:34:44,560
when i started in it was just
 

5029
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:48,790
when i started in it was just
like some little crazy absolutely

5030
01:34:48,790 --> 01:34:48,800
like some little crazy absolutely
 

5031
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:51,990
like some little crazy absolutely
useless field which couldn't really do

5032
01:34:51,990 --> 01:34:52,000
useless field which couldn't really do
 

5033
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,109
useless field which couldn't really do
anything

5034
01:34:53,109 --> 01:34:53,119
anything
 

5035
01:34:53,119 --> 01:34:56,709
anything
to a time when it's really really

5036
01:34:56,709 --> 01:34:56,719
to a time when it's really really
 

5037
01:34:56,719 --> 01:34:59,669
to a time when it's really really
solving a lot of practical problems has

5038
01:34:59,669 --> 01:34:59,679
solving a lot of practical problems has
 

5039
01:34:59,679 --> 01:35:00,310
solving a lot of practical problems has
a lot

5040
01:35:00,310 --> 01:35:00,320
a lot
 

5041
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:01,910
a lot
has offered a lot of tools for

5042
01:35:01,910 --> 01:35:01,920
has offered a lot of tools for
 

5043
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:04,229
has offered a lot of tools for
scientific research

5044
01:35:04,229 --> 01:35:04,239
scientific research
 

5045
01:35:04,239 --> 01:35:05,590
scientific research
right because computer vision is

5046
01:35:05,590 --> 01:35:05,600
right because computer vision is
 

5047
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:07,350
right because computer vision is
impactful for

5048
01:35:07,350 --> 01:35:07,360
impactful for
 

5049
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:10,149
impactful for
images in biology or astronomy and and

5050
01:35:10,149 --> 01:35:10,159
images in biology or astronomy and and
 

5051
01:35:10,159 --> 01:35:11,830

so on and so forth
 

5053
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:14,470
so on and so forth
and we have so we have made great

5054
01:35:14,470 --> 01:35:14,480
and we have so we have made great
 

5055
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:16,709
and we have so we have made great
scientific progress which has had

5056
01:35:16,709 --> 01:35:16,719
scientific progress which has had
 

5057
01:35:16,719 --> 01:35:19,510
scientific progress which has had
real practical impact in the world and i

5058
01:35:19,510 --> 01:35:19,520
real practical impact in the world and i
 

5059
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:21,750
real practical impact in the world and i
feel lucky that

5060
01:35:21,750 --> 01:35:21,760
feel lucky that
 

5061
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:26,390
feel lucky that
i i got in at a time when the field was

5062
01:35:26,390 --> 01:35:26,400
i i got in at a time when the field was
 

5063
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:29,510
i i got in at a time when the field was
very young and at a time when it is

5064
01:35:29,510 --> 01:35:29,520
very young and at a time when it is
 

5065
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:33,669
very young and at a time when it is
it's now mature but not fully mature

5066
01:35:33,669 --> 01:35:33,679
it's now mature but not fully mature
 

5067
01:35:33,679 --> 01:35:35,030
it's now mature but not fully mature
it's mature but not

5068
01:35:35,030 --> 01:35:35,040
it's mature but not
 

5069
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:37,990
it's mature but not
done i mean it's really in still in a in

5070
01:35:37,990 --> 01:35:38,000
done i mean it's really in still in a in
 

5071
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,070
done i mean it's really in still in a in
a productive phase yes

5072
01:35:40,070 --> 01:35:40,080
a productive phase yes
 

5073
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:41,830
a productive phase yes
yeah yeah i think people 500 years from

5074
01:35:41,830 --> 01:35:41,840
yeah yeah i think people 500 years from
 

5075
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:43,430
yeah yeah i think people 500 years from
now would laugh are you calling this

5076
01:35:43,430 --> 01:35:43,440
now would laugh are you calling this
 

5077
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:44,390
now would laugh are you calling this
field mature

5078
01:35:44,390 --> 01:35:44,400
field mature
 

5079
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:47,750
field mature
yeah that is very possible yeah so but

5080
01:35:47,750 --> 01:35:47,760
yeah that is very possible yeah so but
 

5081
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:48,790
yeah that is very possible yeah so but
you're also

5082
01:35:48,790 --> 01:35:48,800
you're also
 

5083
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:51,109
you're also
lest i forget to mention you've also

5084
01:35:51,109 --> 01:35:51,119
lest i forget to mention you've also
 

5085
01:35:51,119 --> 01:35:51,910
lest i forget to mention you've also
mentored

5086
01:35:51,910 --> 01:35:51,920
mentored
 

5087

does it take to be
 

5099
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:07,430
does it take to be
a good mentor what does it take to be a

5100

had very very smart and hardworking and
 

5109
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:19,830
had very very smart and hardworking and
creative students i think

5110
01:36:19,830 --> 01:36:19,840
creative students i think
 

5111
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:23,910
creative students i think
some part of the credit just belongs to

5112
01:36:23,910 --> 01:36:23,920
some part of the credit just belongs to
 

5113
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:25,030
some part of the credit just belongs to
being at berkeley

5115
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:27,350
being at berkeley
i think those of us who are at top

5116
01:36:27,350 --> 01:36:27,360
i think those of us who are at top
 

5117
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:28,229
i think those of us who are at top
universities

5118
01:36:28,229 --> 01:36:28,239
universities
 

5119
01:36:28,239 --> 01:36:31,430
universities
are blessed because we have

5120
01:36:31,430 --> 01:36:31,440
are blessed because we have
 

5121
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:33,750
are blessed because we have
very very smart and capable students

5122
01:36:33,750 --> 01:36:33,760
very very smart and capable students
 

5123
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:34,550
very very smart and capable students
coming on

5124
01:36:34,550 --> 01:36:34,560
coming on
 

5125
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:37,830
coming on
knocking on our door so so i have to be

5126
01:36:37,830 --> 01:36:37,840
knocking on our door so so i have to be
 

5127
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:40,229
knocking on our door so so i have to be
humble enough to acknowledge that

5128
01:36:40,229 --> 01:36:40,239
humble enough to acknowledge that
 

5129
01:36:40,239 --> 01:36:42,629
humble enough to acknowledge that
but what have i added i think i have

5130
01:36:42,629 --> 01:36:42,639
but what have i added i think i have
 

5131
01:36:42,639 --> 01:36:43,830
but what have i added i think i have
added something

5132
01:36:43,830 --> 01:36:43,840
added something
 

5133
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:47,510
added something
what i have added is uh i think

5134
01:36:47,510 --> 01:36:47,520
what i have added is uh i think
 

5135
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:50,709
what i have added is uh i think
what i've always tried to teach them is

5136
01:36:50,709 --> 01:36:50,719
what i've always tried to teach them is
 

5137
01:36:50,719 --> 01:36:54,550
what i've always tried to teach them is
a sense of picking the right problems

5138
01:36:54,550 --> 01:36:54,560
a sense of picking the right problems
 

5139
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:59,189
a sense of picking the right problems
so i think that in science in the short

5140
01:36:59,189 --> 01:36:59,199
so i think that in science in the short
 

5141
01:36:59,199 --> 01:36:59,990
so i think that in science in the short
run

5142
01:36:59,990 --> 01:37:00,000
run
 

5143
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,189
run
success is always based on technical

5144
01:37:03,189 --> 01:37:03,199

10 years what's a good problem if you

5182
01:37:42,790 --> 01:37:42,800
10 years what's a good problem if you
 

5183
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:44,149
10 years what's a good problem if you
could summarize

5184
01:37:44,149 --> 01:37:44,159
could summarize
 

5185
01:37:44,159 --> 01:37:45,910
could summarize
if is that possible to even summarize

5186
01:37:45,910 --> 01:37:45,920
if is that possible to even summarize
 

5187
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:47,590
if is that possible to even summarize
like what what's your sense of a good

i i think uh i think uh i have a sense
 

5193
01:37:51,199 --> 01:37:53,189
i i think uh i think uh i have a sense
of what is a good problem which is

uh there is a british scientist uh

5196
01:37:56,390 --> 01:37:56,400
uh there is a british scientist uh
 

5197
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:58,149
uh there is a british scientist uh
in fact he won a nobel prize peter

5198
01:37:58,149 --> 01:37:58,159
in fact he won a nobel prize peter

medover who has a
 

5201
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:04,310
medover who has a
a book on on this and uh basically he

5202
01:38:04,310 --> 01:38:04,320
a book on on this and uh basically he
 

5203
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:05,030
a book on on this and uh basically he
calls

5204
01:38:05,030 --> 01:38:05,040

so we need to sort of find problems

5210
01:38:11,510 --> 01:38:11,520
so we need to sort of find problems
 

5211
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:13,910
so we need to sort of find problems
which are

5212
01:38:13,910 --> 01:38:13,920
which are
 

5213
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:16,790
which are
which are not yet solved but which are

and he sort of refers to this

5218
01:38:21,669 --> 01:38:21,679
and he sort of refers to this
 

5219
01:38:21,679 --> 01:38:23,430
and he sort of refers to this
sense that there is this problem which

5220
01:38:23,430 --> 01:38:23,440
sense that there is this problem which
 

5221
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:25,910
sense that there is this problem which
isn't quite solved yet but it has a soft

5222
01:38:25,910 --> 01:38:25,920
isn't quite solved yet but it has a soft
 

5223
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:27,189
isn't quite solved yet but it has a soft
underbelly

5224
01:38:27,189 --> 01:38:27,199
underbelly
 

5225
01:38:27,199 --> 01:38:29,990
underbelly
there is some place where you can you

5226
01:38:29,990 --> 01:38:30,000
there is some place where you can you
 

5227
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:30,390
there is some place where you can you
know

5228
01:38:30,390 --> 01:38:30,400

intuition that this problem is ripe is

5232
01:38:37,430 --> 01:38:37,440
intuition that this problem is ripe is
 

5233
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:39,270
intuition that this problem is ripe is
is a good thing because otherwise you

5234
01:38:39,270 --> 01:38:39,280
is a good thing because otherwise you
 

5235
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:40,709
is a good thing because otherwise you
can just beat your head and not make

5236
01:38:40,709 --> 01:38:40,719
can just beat your head and not make
 

5237
01:38:40,719 --> 01:38:42,229
can just beat your head and not make
progress

5238

so i think that is that is important so

5240
01:38:45,910 --> 01:38:45,920
so i think that is that is important so
 

5241
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:46,470
so i think that is that is important so
if

5242
01:38:46,470 --> 01:38:46,480
if
 

5243
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:48,550
if
if i have that and if i can convey that

5244
01:38:48,550 --> 01:38:48,560
if i have that and if i can convey that
 

5245
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:49,590
if i have that and if i can convey that
to students

5246
01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:49,600
to students
 

5247
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:52,070
to students
it's not just that they do great

5248
01:38:52,070 --> 01:38:52,080
it's not just that they do great
 

5249
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:53,990
it's not just that they do great
