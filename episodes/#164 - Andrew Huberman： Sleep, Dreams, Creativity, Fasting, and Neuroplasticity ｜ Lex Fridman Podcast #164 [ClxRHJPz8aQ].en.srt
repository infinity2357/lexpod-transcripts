00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,710
first question okay well the answer i'll
start with

104
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:36,720
start with
 

105
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,870
start with
is the one that i always default to when

106
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:38,880
is the one that i always default to when
 

107
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,749
is the one that i always default to when
there's a why

108
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:39,759
there's a why

00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,789
there's a why

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,389

giving a

116
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:48,399
giving a
 

117
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,429
giving a
absolute answer right but

118
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:51,439
absolute answer right but
 

119
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,030
absolute answer right but
there's one mechanism that's very clear

120
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:55,040
there's one mechanism that's very clear
 

121
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,190
there's one mechanism that's very clear
that's super important which is that the

122
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,200
that's super important which is that the
 

123
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,950
that's super important which is that the
longer we are awake

124
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:58,960
longer we are awake
 

125
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,310
longer we are awake
the more adenosine accumulates

126
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:02,320
the more adenosine accumulates
 

127
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,429
the more adenosine accumulates
in our brain and adenosine binds to

128
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:05,439
in our brain and adenosine binds to
 

129
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,469
in our brain and adenosine binds to
adenosine receptors no surprise there

130
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:08,479
adenosine receptors no surprise there
 

131
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,309
adenosine receptors no surprise there
and it creates the feeling of sleepiness

132
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:12,319
and it creates the feeling of sleepiness
 

133
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,589
and it creates the feeling of sleepiness
independent of time of day or night

134
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:15,599
independent of time of day or night
 

135
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,070
independent of time of day or night
so there are two mechanisms one is we

136
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:18,080
so there are two mechanisms one is we
 

137
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,630
so there are two mechanisms one is we
get sleepy

138
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:20,640
get sleepy
 

139
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,390
get sleepy
as adenosine accumulates the longer

140
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:22,400
as adenosine accumulates the longer
 

141
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,990
as adenosine accumulates the longer
we've been awake the more adenosine is

142
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,000
we've been awake the more adenosine is
 

143
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,150
we've been awake the more adenosine is
accumulated in our system

144
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,160
accumulated in our system
 

145
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,910
accumulated in our system
but how sleepy we get

146
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:29,920
but how sleepy we get
 

147
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,670
but how sleepy we get
for a given amount of adenosine depends

148
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:31,680
for a given amount of adenosine depends
 

149
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,270
for a given amount of adenosine depends
on where we are in this so-called

150
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:33,280
on where we are in this so-called
 

151
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,550
on where we are in this so-called
circadian cycle

152
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:34,560
circadian cycle
 

153
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,030
circadian cycle
and the circadian cycle is just this

154
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,040
and the circadian cycle is just this
 

155
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,190
and the circadian cycle is just this
very very well conserved oscillation

156
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:39,200
very very well conserved oscillation
 

157
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,270
very very well conserved oscillation
it's a temperature oscillation where you

00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:41,280
it's a temperature oscillation where you
 

159
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,710
it's a temperature oscillation where you
go from a low point

go from a low point
 

161
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,309
go from a low point
typically if you're awake during the day

typically if you're awake during the day
 

163
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,830
typically if you're awake during the day
and you're asleep at night you'll

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,229
like three a.m four a.m and then your
temperature will start to creep

170
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:52,239
temperature will start to creep
 

171
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,830
temperature will start to creep
up as you wake up in the morning and

172
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:53,840
up as you wake up in the morning and
 

173
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,229
up as you wake up in the morning and
then it'll peak in the late afternoon

174
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:56,239
then it'll peak in the late afternoon
 

175
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,750
then it'll peak in the late afternoon
and then it'll start to drop again

176
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:57,760
and then it'll start to drop again
 

177
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,949
and then it'll start to drop again
toward the evening and then you get

178
00:02:58,949 --> 00:02:58,959
toward the evening and then you get
 

179
00:02:58,959 --> 00:02:59,910
toward the evening and then you get
sleepy again that

180
00:02:59,910 --> 00:02:59,920
sleepy again that

those converge
 

213
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,350
those converge
to create a sense of sleepiness or

214
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:33,360
to create a sense of sleepiness or
 

215
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,030
to create a sense of sleepiness or
wakefulness the simple way

wakefulness the simple way
 

217
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,110

to reveal these two mechanisms to

218
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:37,120
to reveal these two mechanisms to
 

219
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,750
to reveal these two mechanisms to
uncouple them is stay up for 24 hours

220
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:39,760
uncouple them is stay up for 24 hours
 

221
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,670
uncouple them is stay up for 24 hours
and you will find that even though

you get i will get very sleepy around 3

236
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,000
you get i will get very sleepy around 3
 

237
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,110
you get i will get very sleepy around 3
4 a.m

238
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,120
4 a.m
 

239
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,309
4 a.m
but then around 5 or 6 or 7 a.m which is

240
00:03:58,309 --> 00:03:58,319
but then around 5 or 6 or 7 a.m which is
 

241
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,509
but then around 5 or 6 or 7 a.m which is
my normal wake-up time

242
00:03:59,509 --> 00:03:59,519
my normal wake-up time
 

243
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,910
my normal wake-up time
i'll start to feel more alert even

244
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:01,920
i'll start to feel more alert even
 

245
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,190
i'll start to feel more alert even
though adenosine has been accumulating

246
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:05,200
though adenosine has been accumulating
 

247
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,750
though adenosine has been accumulating
further so adenosine is higher for me

248
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:07,760
further so adenosine is higher for me
 

249
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,589
further so adenosine is higher for me
the longer i stay up and yet i feel more

250
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:09,599
the longer i stay up and yet i feel more
 

251
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,949
the longer i stay up and yet i feel more
alert than i did a few hours ago and

252
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:10,959
alert than i did a few hours ago and
 

253
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:11,830
alert than i did a few hours ago and
that's because these are

254
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:11,840
that's because these are
 

255
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,149
that's because these are
two interacting forces so adenosine

256
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:14,159
two interacting forces so adenosine
 

257
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,190
two interacting forces so adenosine
makes you sleepy

258
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,200
makes you sleepy
 

259
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,030
makes you sleepy
and then just how sleepy or how awake

260
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:17,040
and then just how sleepy or how awake
 

261
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,870
and then just how sleepy or how awake
you feel also depends on where you are

262
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:18,880
you feel also depends on where you are
 

263
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,229
you feel also depends on where you are
in this temperature oscillation that

264
00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:20,239
in this temperature oscillation that
 

265
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:21,670
in this temperature oscillation that
takes 24 hours okay so that's

266
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:21,680
takes 24 hours okay so that's
 

267
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,430
takes 24 hours okay so that's
fascinating so there's a bunch of

268
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:23,440
fascinating so there's a bunch of
 

269
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,629
fascinating so there's a bunch of
oscillations going on

270
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:24,639
oscillations going on
 

271
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,870
oscillations going on
and then it kind of through the

272
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:26,880
and then it kind of through the
 

273
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,990
and then it kind of through the
evolutionary process

274
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,000
evolutionary process
 

275
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,550
evolutionary process
have evolved to all be aligned somewhat

276
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:30,560
have evolved to all be aligned somewhat
 

277
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,990
have evolved to all be aligned somewhat
and they interplay so it's

278
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:32,000
and they interplay so it's
 

279
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,310
and they interplay so it's
you said your your body temperature goes

280
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:34,320
you said your your body temperature goes
 

281
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,830
you said your your body temperature goes
up and down

282
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:35,840
up and down
 

283
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,870
up and down
there's chemicals in your brain that

284
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:38,880
there's chemicals in your brain that
 

285
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,430
there's chemicals in your brain that
uh oscillate and then there's the actual

286
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:41,440
uh oscillate and then there's the actual
 

287
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,070
uh oscillate and then there's the actual
oscillation

288
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,080
oscillation
 

289
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,430
oscillation
of the the sun in the

290
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:45,440
of the the sun in the
 

291
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,629
of the the sun in the
in the sky so all of that together

292
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:50,639

 

293
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,790

has some impact on each other and

294
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:52,800
has some impact on each other and
 

295
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,150
has some impact on each other and
somehow that all

296
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:54,160
somehow that all
 

297
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,230
somehow that all
results in us wanting to go to sleep

298
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:56,240
results in us wanting to go to sleep
 

299
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,189
results in us wanting to go to sleep
every night

300
00:04:57,189 --> 00:04:57,199
every night
 

301
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,430
every night
right so um and we can get right into

302
00:04:59,430 --> 00:04:59,440
right so um and we can get right into
 

303
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,029
right so um and we can get right into
the meat of this so i guess we just dove

304
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:01,039
the meat of this so i guess we just dove
 

305
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,310
the meat of this so i guess we just dove
right in but the

306
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:02,320
right in but the
 

307
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,430
right in but the
so the the temperature oscillation

308
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:05,440
so the the temperature oscillation
 

309
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,990
so the the temperature oscillation
is the effector of the circadian clock

310
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:08,000
is the effector of the circadian clock
 

311
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,990
is the effector of the circadian clock
so every cell in our body has a 24-hour

312
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,000
so every cell in our body has a 24-hour
 

313
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,830
so every cell in our body has a 24-hour
rhythm that's dictated by

314
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:11,840
rhythm that's dictated by
 

315
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,790
rhythm that's dictated by
genes like clock per bee male this is

00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:14,800
genes like clock per bee male this is
 

317
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,310
genes like clock per bee male this is

and probably particularly in kids you
 

497
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,749
and probably particularly in kids you
imagine kids running around in the dark

498
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:01,759
imagine kids running around in the dark
 

499
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:02,390
imagine kids running around in the dark
and getting

500
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:02,400
and getting
 

501
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,589
and getting
that where there are a lot of animals

502
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:03,599
that where there are a lot of animals
 

503
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:04,869
that where there are a lot of animals
that can see really well under those

504
00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:04,879
that can see really well under those
 

505
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,550
that can see really well under those
conditions and humans can't

506
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:06,560
conditions and humans can't
 

507
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,469
conditions and humans can't
and this would be all pre-electricity

508
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:08,479
and this would be all pre-electricity
 

509
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:09,830
and this would be all pre-electricity
even if you're carrying a torch

510
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:09,840
even if you're carrying a torch
 

511
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,350
even if you're carrying a torch
i mean the range of illumination on a

512
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:11,360
i mean the range of illumination on a
 

513
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,110
i mean the range of illumination on a
torch is nothing

514
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:13,120
torch is nothing
 

515
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,230
torch is nothing
compared to what um a a nighttime

516
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:16,240
compared to what um a a nighttime
 

517
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,309
compared to what um a a nighttime
predator like a large cat or something

518
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:18,319
predator like a large cat or something
 

519
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,909
predator like a large cat or something
can can do that i mean they basically

520
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:19,919
can can do that i mean they basically
 

521
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,110
can can do that i mean they basically
they can see everything they need to in

522
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:21,120
they can see everything they need to in
 

523
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,469
they can see everything they need to in
order to eat us

524
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:22,479
order to eat us
 

525
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,710
order to eat us
and not the other way around so one

526
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:24,720
and not the other way around so one
 

527
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,309
and not the other way around so one
fascinating thing you said

528
00:08:26,309 --> 00:08:26,319
fascinating thing you said
 

529
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,510
fascinating thing you said
is uh that blew my mind and we went

530
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:29,520
is uh that blew my mind and we went
 

531
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,150
is uh that blew my mind and we went
right past

532
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:30,160
right past
 

533
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,589
right past
it uh which is the temperature is a

534
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:33,599
it uh which is the temperature is a
 

535
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,469
it uh which is the temperature is a
really powerful like if you were to

536
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:36,479
really powerful like if you were to
 

537
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,990
really powerful like if you were to
think about the ways that different

538
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,000
think about the ways that different
 

539
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,870
think about the ways that different
parts of the body

540
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:38,880
parts of the body
 

541
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,630
parts of the body
different systems the body would

542
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:40,640
different systems the body would
 

543
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,310
different systems the body would
communicate with each other

544
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:42,320
communicate with each other
 

545
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,910
communicate with each other
temperature would be a really good one

546
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:45,920
temperature would be a really good one
 

547
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,389
temperature would be a really good one
and that just i mean maybe it's obvious

548
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:48,399
and that just i mean maybe it's obvious
 

549
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,110
and that just i mean maybe it's obvious
but it kind of blew my mind just now

550
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:51,120
but it kind of blew my mind just now
 

551
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,230
but it kind of blew my mind just now
that yeah these systems are all

552
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:54,240
that yeah these systems are all
 

553
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,509
that yeah these systems are all
distributed

554
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:55,519
distributed
 

555
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,070
distributed
right and they have to kind of they're

556
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,080
right and they have to kind of they're
 

557
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,990
right and they have to kind of they're
not actually sending signals but they're

558
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,000
not actually sending signals but they're
 

559
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,269
not actually sending signals but they're
coordinating they need

560
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:01,279
coordinating they need
 

561
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,269
coordinating they need
some sort of universal thing to look at

562
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:05,279
some sort of universal thing to look at
 

563
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,670
some sort of universal thing to look at
in order to coordinate and temperature

564
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:07,680
in order to coordinate and temperature
 

565
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,870
in order to coordinate and temperature
is a nice one to

566
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:08,880
is a nice one to
 

567
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,550
is a nice one to
to uh to build around and that way

568
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:12,560
to uh to build around and that way
 

569
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,389
to uh to build around and that way
you can control the behavior of all

570
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:14,399
you can control the behavior of all
 

571
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,150
you can control the behavior of all
these different systems by controlling

572
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:16,160
these different systems by controlling
 

573
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,949
these different systems by controlling
the temperature right it's attractive to

574
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:18,959
the temperature right it's attractive to
 

575
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,949
the temperature right it's attractive to
think of a mechanism where this

576
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:20,959
think of a mechanism where this
 

577
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,630
think of a mechanism where this
master circadian clock secretes a

00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:22,640
master circadian clock secretes a
 

579
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,470
master circadian clock secretes a
peptide or something that goes and

580
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:24,480
peptide or something that goes and
 

581
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,150
peptide or something that goes and
locks to receptors in all the cells and

582
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,160
locks to receptors in all the cells and
 

583
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,070
locks to receptors in all the cells and
gets it just right but that leaves far

584
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,080
gets it just right but that leaves far
 

585
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,110
gets it just right but that leaves far
too much room for

586
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:29,120
too much room for
 

587
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,829
too much room for
variability binding affinities cells in

589
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:32,470

liver cells and so forth and for
 

599
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,150

instance our we have a clock in our gut

600
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:40,160
instance our we have a clock in our gut
 

601
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,990
instance our we have a clock in our gut
and in our liver

602
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,000
and in our liver
 

603
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,590
and in our liver
such that if we were just take out your

00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:43,600
such that if we were just take out your

liver and put it on a table
 

607
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,870
liver and put it on a table
and just look at the expression of these

608
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:46,880
and just look at the expression of these
 

609
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,310
and just look at the expression of these
genes it would be in a 24 hour

610
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:48,320
genes it would be in a 24 hour
 

611
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,389

but something has to entrain them and
 

615
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,910
but something has to entrain them and
keep them all synchronized and so it's

616
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:53,920
keep them all synchronized and so it's
 

617
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,670
keep them all synchronized and so it's
not obvious that it would be temperature

618
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:55,680
not obvious that it would be temperature

00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:14,079
generally with the most sleepy phase of
 

825
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,069
generally with the most sleepy phase of
your circadian cycle

826
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:16,079
your circadian cycle
 

827
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,230
your circadian cycle
so cool is better for falling and

828
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:18,240
so cool is better for falling and
 

829
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,990
so cool is better for falling and
staying asleep and sleeping deeply

830
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,000
staying asleep and sleeping deeply
 

831
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,150
staying asleep and sleeping deeply
and then i i guess like that's what ate

832
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:22,160
and then i i guess like that's what ate
 

833
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,670
and then i i guess like that's what ate
sleep showed they have like an app

834
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:23,680
sleep showed they have like an app
 

835
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,430
sleep showed they have like an app
is uh it warms back up uh to wake you up

836
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:27,440
is uh it warms back up uh to wake you up
 

837
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,230
is uh it warms back up uh to wake you up
the idea that

838
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:28,240
the idea that
 

839
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,990
the idea that
i haven't actually used it i'm like this

840
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:30,000
i haven't actually used it i'm like this
 

841
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,629
i haven't actually used it i'm like this
is stupid uh

842
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:32,639
is stupid uh
 

843
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,629
is stupid uh
people say it works but i just keep it

844
00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:34,639
people say it works but i just keep it
 

845
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:35,910
people say it works but i just keep it
the same temperature throughout the

846
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:35,920
the same temperature throughout the
 

847
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,949
the same temperature throughout the
night

848
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:36,959
night
 

849
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,389
night
but uh warming it up i guess wakes you

850
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:40,399
but uh warming it up i guess wakes you
 

851
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,110
but uh warming it up i guess wakes you
up which is

852
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,120
up which is
 

853
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,790
up which is
it was just fascinating yeah because

854
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:42,800
it was just fascinating yeah because
 

855
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,710
it was just fascinating yeah because
you're the wake up signal

856
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:44,720
you're the wake up signal
 

857
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,310
you're the wake up signal
is it's interesting to think about it's

858
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:46,320
is it's interesting to think about it's
 

859
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,150
is it's interesting to think about it's
not just correlated with an increase in

00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:48,160
not just correlated with an increase in
 

861
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,829
not just correlated with an increase in
body temperature the increase in body

862
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:49,839
body temperature the increase in body
 

863
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:50,790

is triggering the release of cortisol
 

867
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,470
is triggering the release of cortisol
from your adrenals and that's the wake

868
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:54,480
from your adrenals and that's the wake
 

869
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,189
from your adrenals and that's the wake
up signal

870
00:13:55,189 --> 00:13:55,199
up signal
 

871
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,710
up signal
do you think it's absolute temperatures

872
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:56,720
do you think it's absolute temperatures
 

873
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,069
do you think it's absolute temperatures
we're talking about is just even

everyone's going to have slightly
 

881
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,509
everyone's going to have slightly
different basal temperature the idea

different basal temperature the idea
 

883
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,829

that everybody should be 98.6 i mean
 

885
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,110
that everybody should be 98.6 i mean
that's a myth

that's a myth
 

887
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,870
that's a myth
and there are theories that body

temperature overall has been dropping in
 

891
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,030
temperature overall has been dropping in
the last 50 years or so i i doubt that's

892
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,040
the last 50 years or so i i doubt that's
 

893
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,629
the last 50 years or so i i doubt that's
true for somebody who's athletic like

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,590
you know young and healthy but basically
the the coldest period of that 24-hour

900
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:21,600
the the coldest period of that 24-hour

cycle
 

903
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,629

00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:24,639
is when you are going to be sleepiest
 

905
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:25,990
is when you are going to be sleepiest
there's actually a period within that

i'm not talking about the wake-up time
 

921
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,990
i'm not talking about the wake-up time
in the middle of the night where you go

922
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:38,000
in the middle of the night where you go
 

923
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,430
in the middle of the night where you go
use the bathroom or where you set an

00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:40,880
alarm to go catch a flight i mean
 

927
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,150
alarm to go catch a flight i mean
if you were to just allow yourself to

928
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:42,160
if you were to just allow yourself to
 

929
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,629
if you were to just allow yourself to
sleep without a clock for a few days

sleep without a clock for a few days
 

931
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,310
sleep without a clock for a few days
measure when you typically wake up two

932
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:46,320
measure when you typically wake up two
 

933
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,750
measure when you typically wake up two
hours before then is your temperature

934
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:47,760
hours before then is your temperature
 

935
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,470
hours before then is your temperature
minimum

936
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:48,480
minimum
 

937
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,150
minimum
and that temperature minimum turns out

938
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:50,160
and that temperature minimum turns out
 

939
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,230
and that temperature minimum turns out
to be a very important

940
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:52,240
to be a very important
 

941
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,990
to be a very important
landmark in your circadian cycle because

942
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,000
landmark in your circadian cycle because
 

943
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,790
landmark in your circadian cycle because
it turns out that if you get bright

944
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:58,800
it turns out that if you get bright
 

945
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,389
it turns out that if you get bright
light in your eyes

946
00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:00,399
light in your eyes
 

947
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,350
light in your eyes
in the hours immediately before your

temperature minimum
 

951
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,790
temperature minimum
so two to four hours or any time within

952
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:08,800
so two to four hours or any time within
 

953
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,069
so two to four hours or any time within
the two or four hour window before that

00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:10,079
the two or four hour window before that
 

955
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,949
the two or four hour window before that
temperature minimum

956
00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:10,959
temperature minimum
 

957
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,030
temperature minimum
you are going to what's called delay

958
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:13,040
you are going to what's called delay
 

959
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,269
you are going to what's called delay
your circadian clock the next day

960
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:15,279
your circadian clock the next day
 

961
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,509
your circadian clock the next day
that whole oscillation is going to move

962
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:17,519
that whole oscillation is going to move
 

963
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:18,870
that whole oscillation is going to move
forward it will make you want to go to

964
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:18,880
forward it will make you want to go to
 

965
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,670
forward it will make you want to go to
sleep later

966
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:19,680
sleep later
 

967
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,590
sleep later
and wake up later whereas if you get

968
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:21,600
and wake up later whereas if you get
 

969
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,430
and wake up later whereas if you get
bright light in your eyes in the

970
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:23,440
bright light in your eyes in the
 

971
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,069
bright light in your eyes in the
hours after that temperature minimum so

972
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:26,079
hours after that temperature minimum so
 

973
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,030
hours after that temperature minimum so
let's say for me

974
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:27,040
let's say for me
 

975
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,629
let's say for me
typical wake up time is 6 a.m my

that oscillation so that i want to go to

984
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:38,399
that oscillation so that i want to go to
 

985
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,189

00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:39,199
bed earlier
 

987
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,110
bed earlier
and wake up earlier the subsequent

988
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:41,120
and wake up earlier the subsequent
 

989
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,949
and wake up earlier the subsequent
nights so you might say

990
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:42,959
nights so you might say
 

991
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,710
nights so you might say
wait but most nights i go to sleep and

992
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:44,720
wait but most nights i go to sleep and
 

993
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,230
wait but most nights i go to sleep and
wake up at more or less the same time

994
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:46,240
wake up at more or less the same time
 

995
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,030
wake up at more or less the same time
why is that

996
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:47,040
why is that
 

997
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,870
why is that
and that's because the same thing is

998
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:48,880
and that's because the same thing is
 

999
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,470
and that's because the same thing is
happening on both sides you are both

1000
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:50,480
happening on both sides you are both
 

1001
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,069
happening on both sides you are both
advancing your clock a little bit

1002
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:52,079
advancing your clock a little bit
 

1003
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,150
advancing your clock a little bit
and assuming that you're looking at

1004
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:54,160
and assuming that you're looking at
 

1005
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,749
and assuming that you're looking at
light in the evening you're also

1006
00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:55,759
light in the evening you're also
 

1007
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,189
light in the evening you're also
delaying your clock a little bit so you

1008
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:57,199
delaying your clock a little bit so you
 

1009
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,710
delaying your clock a little bit so you
get kind of captured in between and then

1010
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:58,720
get kind of captured in between and then
 

1011
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,949
get kind of captured in between and then
your rhythm more or less oscillates

1012
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:00,959
your rhythm more or less oscillates
 

1013
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,350
your rhythm more or less oscillates
at the at the same period as we say as

1014
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:03,360
at the at the same period as we say as
 

1015
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:03,990
at the at the same period as we say as
the

00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:04,000
the

east coast then i know that you had to
 

1027
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:13,590

pulling basically and all night yeah
 

1031
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,430
pulling basically and all night yeah
yeah that's the interesting

1032
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:17,440
yeah that's the interesting
 

1033
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,949
yeah that's the interesting
uh point about the messiness of

1034
00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:20,959
uh point about the messiness of
 

1035
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,670
uh point about the messiness of
sleep so most people seem to up perform

1036
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:23,680
sleep so most people seem to up perform
 

1037
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,430

i perhaps am the same

i perhaps am the same
 

1043
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,110
i perhaps am the same
but i don't know that and i tend to

believe that
 

1047
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,269
believe that
you can also perform relatively

1048
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:37,279
you can also perform relatively
 

1049
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,949
you can also perform relatively
optimally with

optimally with
chaos of sleep of uh

try to minimize stress in life so

what i found for myself with diet

1070
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:10,720
what i found for myself with diet
 

1071
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,669
what i found for myself with diet
with sleep is that if i obsess about it

1072
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:13,679
with sleep is that if i obsess about it
 

1073

but i think that

1148
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:26,000
but i think that
 

1149
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,390
but i think that
we've created this anxiety about sleep

1150
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:28,400
we've created this anxiety about sleep
 

1151
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,750
we've created this anxiety about sleep
that it's get if we don't sleep enough

1152
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:29,760
that it's get if we don't sleep enough
 

1153
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,190
that it's get if we don't sleep enough
we're gonna get dementia if we don't get

1154
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:31,200
we're gonna get dementia if we don't get
 

1155
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,230
we're gonna get dementia if we don't get
sleep then

1156
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:32,240
sleep then
 

1157
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,150
sleep then
uh you know the reproductive axis is

1158
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:34,160
uh you know the reproductive axis is
 

1159
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,230
uh you know the reproductive axis is
gonna you know completely crash

1160
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:36,240
gonna you know completely crash
 

1161
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,470
gonna you know completely crash
um you know there's a lot of evidence to

1162
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:38,480
um you know there's a lot of evidence to
 

1163
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,350
um you know there's a lot of evidence to
the contrary

1164
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:39,360
the contrary
 

1165
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,590

this study
what she showed was that consistency of

total sleep duration
 

1375
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,470
total sleep duration
was far more important for performance

1376
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:02,480
was far more important for performance
 

1377
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,190
was far more important for performance
on these

1378
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:03,200
on these
 

1379
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,630
on these
exams than total sleep duration itself

1380
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:06,640
exams than total sleep duration itself
 

1381
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,630
exams than total sleep duration itself
so it's not that just getting more sleep

1382
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:08,640
so it's not that just getting more sleep
 

1383
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,149
so it's not that just getting more sleep
allows you to perform better

1384
00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:10,159
allows you to perform better
 

1385
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,310
allows you to perform better
consistently getting about the same

1386
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:12,320
consistently getting about the same
 

1387
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,590
consistently getting about the same
amount of sleep

1388
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:13,600
amount of sleep
 

1389
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,750
amount of sleep
is more is better for performance at

1390
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:15,760
is more is better for performance at
 

1391
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,350
is more is better for performance at
least in on okim

1392
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:17,360
least in on okim
 

1393
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,909
least in on okim
yeah than just getting more that's

1394
00:22:19,909 --> 00:22:19,919
yeah than just getting more that's
 

1395
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,110
yeah than just getting more that's
interesting so that's

1396
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:21,120
interesting so that's
 

1397
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,590
interesting so that's
referring to more that there should be a

1398
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:23,600
referring to more that there should be a
 

1399
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,350
referring to more that there should be a
consistent habit

1400
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:25,360
consistent habit
 

1401
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,470
consistent habit
versus the total amount to me like the

1402
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:28,480
versus the total amount to me like the
 

1403
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,110
versus the total amount to me like the
entirety of the picture of sleep

1404
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:31,120
entirety of the picture of sleep
 

1405
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,630
entirety of the picture of sleep
is uh it's similar to nutrition in that

1406
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:34,640
is uh it's similar to nutrition in that
 

1407
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,230
is uh it's similar to nutrition in that
it feels like it's

1408
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:38,240
it feels like it's
 

1409
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,070
it feels like it's
there's so many variables involved and

1410
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:40,080
there's so many variables involved and
 

1411
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,310
there's so many variables involved and
it's so person specific

1412
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:42,320
it's so person specific
 

1413
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,630
it's so person specific
so you know a lot of studies i mean this

1414
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:44,640
so you know a lot of studies i mean this
 

1415
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,830
so you know a lot of studies i mean this
is the way of science

1416
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:45,840
is the way of science
 

1417
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,950
is the way of science
has to look and aggregate the effects on

1418
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:48,960
has to look and aggregate the effects on
 

1419
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,430
has to look and aggregate the effects on
sleep

1420
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:49,440
sleep
 

1421
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,230
sleep
it doesn't focus on high performers and

1422
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:52,240
it doesn't focus on high performers and
 

1423
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:52,710
it doesn't focus on high performers and
which are

1424
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:52,720
which are
 

1425
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,310
which are
individuals ultimately like the question

1426
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:56,320
individuals ultimately like the question
 

1427
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,510
individuals ultimately like the question
isn't

1428
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:57,520
isn't
 

1429
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,029
isn't
uh so it's a very important question

1430
00:22:59,029 --> 00:22:59,039
uh so it's a very important question
 

1431
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,950
uh so it's a very important question
it's like what kind of diet

1432
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:00,960
it's like what kind of diet
 

1433
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,149
it's like what kind of diet
fights obesity reduces obesity

1434
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:04,159
fights obesity reduces obesity
 

1435
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,390
fights obesity reduces obesity
it's another question what kind of diet

1436
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:06,400
it's another question what kind of diet
 

1437
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,230
it's another question what kind of diet
allows david goggins to be the best

00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:11,039
these high performers in different
 

1443
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,110
these high performers in different
avenues and the same thing with sleep

1444
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:13,120
avenues and the same thing with sleep
 

1445
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,990
avenues and the same thing with sleep
like people that tell me that i should

1446
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:16,000
like people that tell me that i should
 

1447
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,470
like people that tell me that i should
get eight hours of sleep

1448
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:18,480
get eight hours of sleep
 

1449
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,990
get eight hours of sleep
it's like it's i i

1450
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:22,000
it's like it's i i
 

1451
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,549
it's like it's i i
mean i i get it and they may be right

1452
00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:24,559
mean i i get it and they may be right
 

1453
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:25,990
mean i i get it and they may be right
but they may be very wrong

1454
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:26,000
but they may be very wrong
 

1455
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,830
but they may be very wrong
and there's no evidence that eight is

1456
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:27,840
and there's no evidence that eight is
 

1457
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,350
and there's no evidence that eight is
better than six

1458
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:29,360
better than six
 

1459
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,470
better than six
that you could very well do better on

1460
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:32,480
that you could very well do better on
 

1461
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,350
that you could very well do better on
six than on eight

1462
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:33,360
six than on eight
 

1463
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,789
six than on eight
there are a few other things that um

1464
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:34,799
there are a few other things that um
 

1465
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,190
there are a few other things that um
turn out to be strong parameters for

1466
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:37,200
turn out to be strong parameters for

it's probably some point in
 

1545
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,710
it's probably some point in
infancy but and i function well during

infancy but and i function well during
 

1547

the day i think that
 

1549
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,549
the day i think that
that's a big that's an important

that's a big that's an important
 

1551

that's a big that's an important
parameter is how do you feel during the

almost everybody experiences some sort
of dip in energy in the late afternoon

1558
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:02,880
of dip in energy in the late afternoon
 

1559
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,909
of dip in energy in the late afternoon
or what would correlate to their

00:25:03,909 --> 00:25:03,919
or what would correlate to their
 

1561
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,190
or what would correlate to their
temperature peak

temperature peak
 

1563
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,510
temperature peak
and that's a good time of day to get

1564
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:07,520
and that's a good time of day to get

yes there is a magic to the nap and
 

1687
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,510
yes there is a magic to the nap and
maybe you could speak to the because you

1688
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:01,520
maybe you could speak to the because you
 

1689
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,870
maybe you could speak to the because you
mentioned these protocols

1690
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:02,880
mentioned these protocols
 

1691
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,590
mentioned these protocols
that don't necessarily so they're

1692
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:05,600
that don't necessarily so they're
 

1693
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,710
that don't necessarily so they're
non-sleep

1694
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:06,720
non-sleep
 

1695
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,149
non-sleep
but to me the nap

1696
00:27:10,149 --> 00:27:10,159
but to me the nap
 

1697
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,990
but to me the nap
one or two a day can

1698
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:14,000
one or two a day can
 

1699
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,390
one or two a day can
almost irrespective of how much sleep i

1700
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:16,400
almost irrespective of how much sleep i
 

1701
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,990
almost irrespective of how much sleep i
get the night before

1702
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:18,000
get the night before
 

1703
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,870
get the night before
i have a fundamental change in my mood

1704
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:20,880
i have a fundamental change in my mood
 

1705
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,430
i have a fundamental change in my mood
and my

1706
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:21,440
and my
 

1707
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,110
and my
performance for the better for the

1708
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:23,120
performance for the better for the
 

1709
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,950
performance for the better for the
better for the better yeah likewise

1710
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:24,960
better for the better yeah likewise
 

1711
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,710
better for the better yeah likewise
so uh i do tend to kind of experiment

1712
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:28,720
so uh i do tend to kind of experiment
 

1713
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,669
so uh i do tend to kind of experiment
with durations

1714
00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:29,679
with durations
 

1715
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,510
with durations
it's it's consistently surprising to me

1716
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:33,520
it's it's consistently surprising to me
 

1717
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,549
it's it's consistently surprising to me
how like a nap of like 10 minutes i

1718
00:27:36,549 --> 00:27:36,559
how like a nap of like 10 minutes i
 

1719
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:37,750
how like a nap of like 10 minutes i
don't know maybe you can speak to the

1720
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:37,760
don't know maybe you can speak to the
 

1721
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,590
don't know maybe you can speak to the
perfect duration of a nap

1722
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:39,600
perfect duration of a nap
 

1723
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,029
perfect duration of a nap
but i find that it's like magic

1724
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:43,039
but i find that it's like magic
 

1725
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:46,710
but i find that it's like magic
that a short nap does as much good

1726
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:46,720
that a short nap does as much good
 

1727
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,430
that a short nap does as much good
and often better than a longer one for

1728
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:49,440
and often better than a longer one for
 

1729
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,950
and often better than a longer one for
me for me subjective what would be a

1730
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:50,960
me for me subjective what would be a
 

1731
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,830
me for me subjective what would be a
longer one

1732
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:51,840
longer one
 

1733
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,389
longer one
longer than 90 minutes no no like 90

1734
00:27:54,389 --> 00:27:54,399
longer than 90 minutes no no like 90
 

1735
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,070
longer than 90 minutes no no like 90
minutes or but longer than 90

1736
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:56,080
minutes or but longer than 90
 

1737
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,070
minutes or but longer than 90
like two hours yeah that's dropping you

1738
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:58,080
like two hours yeah that's dropping you
 

1739
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,070
like two hours yeah that's dropping you
starting to drop you into rem sleep and

1740
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:00,080
starting to drop you into rem sleep and
 

1741
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,830
starting to drop you into rem sleep and
even if it's a tiny amount of rem sleep

1742
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:01,840
even if it's a tiny amount of rem sleep
 

1743
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,190
even if it's a tiny amount of rem sleep
people can come out of those naps kind

1744
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:03,200
people can come out of those naps kind
 

1745
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,470
people can come out of those naps kind
of disoriented

1746
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:04,480
of disoriented
 

1747
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,389
of disoriented
i mean remember in sleep space and time

1748
00:28:06,389 --> 00:28:06,399
i mean remember in sleep space and time
 

1749
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,710
i mean remember in sleep space and time
are are totally uncoupled and so

1750
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:08,720
are are totally uncoupled and so
 

1751
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,750
are are totally uncoupled and so
they that's an odd state to re-enter the

1752
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:11,760
they that's an odd state to re-enter the
 

1753
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,190
they that's an odd state to re-enter the
world in if you're not going to stay

i think a 20-minute nap is pretty
 

1761

block of sleep so it's about three hours
 

1997
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,070
block of sleep so it's about three hours
that you have

1998
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:04,080
that you have
 

1999
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,669
that you have
non-exercising every time and of course

2000
00:32:07,669 --> 00:32:07,679
non-exercising every time and of course
 

2001
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,909

it takes time to try to fall asleep and
 

2003
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,750
it takes time to try to fall asleep and
there's an intensity to the whole thing

2004
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:11,760
there's an intensity to the whole thing
 

2005
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,509
there's an intensity to the whole thing
i mean it's probably impossible to get

2006
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:15,519
i mean it's probably impossible to get
 

2007
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,029
i mean it's probably impossible to get
anything more

2008
00:32:17,029 --> 00:32:17,039
anything more
 

2009
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,269
anything more
than uh two hours of sleep if you wanted

2010
00:32:19,269 --> 00:32:19,279
than uh two hours of sleep if you wanted
 

2011
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,909
than uh two hours of sleep if you wanted
to so the optimal thing is probably

2012
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:21,919
to so the optimal thing is probably
 

2013
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:24,070
to so the optimal thing is probably
from the sound of it i'd be curious to

bit
 

2023

bit
before we met up today so i think there

2024
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:33,840
before we met up today so i think there
 

2025
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,669
before we met up today so i think there
are two general approaches

2026
00:32:35,669 --> 00:32:35,679
are two general approaches
 

2027
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,549
are two general approaches
that could work neither one necessarily

2028
00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:38,559
that could work neither one necessarily
 

2029
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,310
that could work neither one necessarily
better than the other

2030
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:40,320
better than the other
 

2031
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,990
better than the other
one would be just to hammer through the

2032
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:44,000
one would be just to hammer through the
 

2033
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,710
one would be just to hammer through the
whole thing

2034
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:44,720

ramped up so that you don't expect
yourself to sleep

system and you know it's all mental

2230
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:41,680
system and you know it's all mental
 

2231
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,109
system and you know it's all mental
um actually and then there's a third

2232
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:45,119
um actually and then there's a third
 

2233
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,870
um actually and then there's a third
so you could try and sleep or or take

care in between yes
yeah and then there's a third approach

2238
00:35:50,069 --> 00:35:50,079
yeah and then there's a third approach
 

2239
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,030
yeah and then there's a third approach
oh yeah but i didn't come up with it

00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,150
but when you inhale the diaphragm moves
down

2904
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:42,160
down
 

2905
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,349
down
the heart gets a little bigger because

2906
00:46:43,349 --> 00:46:43,359
the heart gets a little bigger because
 

2907
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:44,470
the heart gets a little bigger because
there's a little more space in the

2908
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:44,480
there's a little more space in the
 

2909
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,589
there's a little more space in the
thoracic cavity

2910
00:46:45,589 --> 00:46:45,599
thoracic cavity
 

2911
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:48,069
thoracic cavity
and as a consequence blood flows a

2912
00:46:48,069 --> 00:46:48,079
and as a consequence blood flows a
 

2913
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:49,430
and as a consequence blood flows a
little bit more slowly through that

2914
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:49,440
little bit more slowly through that
 

2915
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,630
little bit more slowly through that
larger volume

2916
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:50,640
larger volume
 

2917
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,390
larger volume
there's a category of neurons the

2918
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:52,400
there's a category of neurons the
 

2919
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,670
there's a category of neurons the
sinoatrial node

2920
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:53,680
sinoatrial node
 

2921
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,710
sinoatrial node
that sees that that recognizes that that

rate through that larger volume sends a

2926
00:46:59,829 --> 00:46:59,839
rate through that larger volume sends a
 

2927
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,190
rate through that larger volume sends a
signal to the brain stem and the brain

2928
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:01,200
signal to the brain stem and the brain
 

2929
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,790
signal to the brain stem and the brain
stem sends a signal back to the heart to

2930
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:02,800
stem sends a signal back to the heart to
 

2931
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,150
stem sends a signal back to the heart to
speed the heart up

2932
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:04,160
speed the heart up
 

2933
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,589
speed the heart up
so every time you inhale you're speeding

2934
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:05,599
so every time you inhale you're speeding
 

2935
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:07,190
so every time you inhale you're speeding
the heart up when you exhale

2936
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:07,200
the heart up when you exhale
 

2937

the heart up when you exhale
the diaphragm moves up the heart gets a

2938
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:08,720
the diaphragm moves up the heart gets a
 

2939
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,470
the diaphragm moves up the heart gets a
little smaller the volume is smaller

2940
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:10,480
little smaller the volume is smaller
 

2941
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,750
little smaller the volume is smaller
blood flows more quickly through the

2942
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:11,760
blood flows more quickly through the
 

2943
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,910
blood flows more quickly through the
heart a signal sent up to the brain and

2944
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:13,920
heart a signal sent up to the brain and
 

2945
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,270
heart a signal sent up to the brain and
the brain sends a signal back

2946
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:15,280
the brain sends a signal back
 

2947
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,630
the brain sends a signal back
to slow the heart down this is the basis

2948
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:18,640
to slow the heart down this is the basis
 

2949
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,470
to slow the heart down this is the basis
of heart rate variability

2950
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:20,480
of heart rate variability
 

2951
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,069
of heart rate variability
so at any point if you feel like your

2952
00:47:22,069 --> 00:47:22,079
so at any point if you feel like your
 

2953
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:23,990
so at any point if you feel like your
heart is racing and you feel like you're

00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:24,000
heart is racing and you feel like you're
 

2955
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,349
heart is racing and you feel like you're
working too hard per unit of effort

2956
00:47:27,349 --> 00:47:27,359
working too hard per unit of effort
 

2957
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:30,390
working too hard per unit of effort
focus on making your exhales longer or

2958
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:30,400
focus on making your exhales longer or
 

2959
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,470
focus on making your exhales longer or
more intense than your inhales

2960
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:32,480
more intense than your inhales
 

2961
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,150
more intense than your inhales
if ever you feel like you're truly

2962
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:34,160
if ever you feel like you're truly
 

2963
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,069
if ever you feel like you're truly
flagging you do not have the energy to

2964
00:47:36,069 --> 00:47:36,079
flagging you do not have the energy to
 

2965
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:37,829
flagging you do not have the energy to
get up it's like okay it's time to go

2966
00:47:37,829 --> 00:47:37,839
get up it's like okay it's time to go
 

2967
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:39,349
get up it's like okay it's time to go
and you're exhausted

2968
00:47:39,349 --> 00:47:39,359
and you're exhausted
 

2969
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:41,990
and you're exhausted
you want to draw more oxygen into the

2970
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:42,000
you want to draw more oxygen into the
 

2971
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,230
you want to draw more oxygen into the
system get your heart rate going faster

2972
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:44,240
system get your heart rate going faster
 

2973
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,589
system get your heart rate going faster
now some people when they hear this

2974
00:47:45,589 --> 00:47:45,599
now some people when they hear this
 

2975
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:46,710
now some people when they hear this
probably thinking well this is really

2976
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:46,720
probably thinking well this is really
 

2977
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,069
probably thinking well this is really
obvious but there's so much out there

2978
00:47:48,069 --> 00:47:48,079
obvious but there's so much out there
 

2979
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:49,750
obvious but there's so much out there
about breath work and how to breathe and

2980
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:49,760
about breath work and how to breathe and
 

2981
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:50,870
about breath work and how to breathe and
all this stuff but no one talks about

2982
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:50,880
all this stuff but no one talks about
 

2983
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:51,510
all this stuff but no one talks about
how to do it in

2984
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:51,520
how to do it in
 

2985
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,750
how to do it in
real time while you're exerting effort

2986
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:53,760
real time while you're exerting effort
 

2987
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,990
real time while you're exerting effort
so this is something like almost like

2988
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:56,000
so this is something like almost like
 

2989
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,870
so this is something like almost like
second by second you can adjust things

2990
00:47:58,870 --> 00:47:58,880
second by second you can adjust things
 

2991
00:47:58,880 --> 00:47:59,430
second by second you can adjust things
to just

2992
00:47:59,430 --> 00:47:59,440
to just
 

2993
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,589
to just
in real time based on how you're feeling

2994
00:48:01,589 --> 00:48:01,599
in real time based on how you're feeling
 

2995
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:03,430
in real time based on how you're feeling
but based on the heart rate that's right

2996
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:03,440
but based on the heart rate that's right
 

2997
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,870
but based on the heart rate that's right
the experience of the heart rate

2998
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:04,880
the experience of the heart rate
 

2999
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,870
the experience of the heart rate
that's right so one thing that could

3000
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:06,880
that's right so one thing that could
 

3001
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,549
that's right so one thing that could
could be very efficient and we're doing

3002
00:48:08,549 --> 00:48:08,559
could be very efficient and we're doing
 

3003
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:10,069
could be very efficient and we're doing
some work with athletes now

3004
00:48:10,069 --> 00:48:10,079
some work with athletes now
 

3005
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:12,470
some work with athletes now
these are unpublished data but if you

00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:12,480
these are unpublished data but if you
 

3007
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,309
these are unpublished data but if you
while you're running

while you're running
 

3009
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:16,630
while you're running
if you want to get into a nice cadence

if you want to get into a nice cadence
 

3011
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,230
if you want to get into a nice cadence
of heart rate variability

3012
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:18,240
of heart rate variability
 

3013
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:21,910
of heart rate variability
do double inhales

3014
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:21,920

 

3015
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,670

while you're running what this will do

3016
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:23,680
while you're running what this will do
 

3017
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,430
while you're running what this will do
is when you do the double inhale has the

3018
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:25,440
is when you do the double inhale has the
 

3019
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,069
is when you do the double inhale has the
effect of

3020
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:26,079
effect of
 

3021
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:28,790
effect of
of reopening the avioli of the lungs

3022
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:28,800
of reopening the avioli of the lungs
 

3023
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,230
of reopening the avioli of the lungs
your lungs are filled with tons of

3024
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:30,240
your lungs are filled with tons of
 

3025
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,190
your lungs are filled with tons of
little sacs

3026

little sacs
 

3027
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,030
little sacs
when you they tend to collapse as you

3028
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:33,040
when you they tend to collapse as you
 

3029
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,470

fatigue when you
 

3031
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,910
fatigue when you
and carbon dioxide builds up in the

and carbon dioxide builds up in the
 

3033
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:36,950
and carbon dioxide builds up in the
bloodstream and that's when we start

00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:38,240
getting stress if you've ever been
 

3037
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,750
getting stress if you've ever been
sprinting you start getting beat and

3038
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:39,760
sprinting you start getting beat and
 

3039
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,349

you're going as hard as you can what
 

3041
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:42,790
you're going as hard as you can what
what you really need to do is double

what you really need to do is double
 

3043
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,630
what you really need to do is double
inhale and reinflate these sacs in the

inhale and reinflate these sacs in the
 

3045
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,230
inhale and reinflate these sacs in the
lungs and then offload a lot of carbon

so dopamine and testosterone are closely

3446
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:11,200
so dopamine and testosterone are closely
 

3447
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:14,150
so dopamine and testosterone are closely
related in the pituitary system

chromosomal backgrounds yeah

3714
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:26,240
chromosomal backgrounds yeah
 

3715
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,950
chromosomal backgrounds yeah
yeah i mean you also mentioned fasting

3716
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:28,960
yeah i mean you also mentioned fasting
 

3717
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,789
yeah i mean you also mentioned fasting
potentially through this uh two day

3718
00:59:30,789 --> 00:59:30,799
potentially through this uh two day
 

3719
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:31,430
potentially through this uh two day
thing

3720
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:31,440
thing
 

3721
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,670
thing
it'd be cool to get your thoughts about

3722
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:33,680
it'd be cool to get your thoughts about
 

3723
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:36,390
it'd be cool to get your thoughts about
fasting in general do you think

3724
00:59:36,390 --> 00:59:36,400
fasting in general do you think
 

3725
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:39,270
fasting in general do you think
uh on a personal level and at a higher

3726
00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:39,280
uh on a personal level and at a higher
 

3727
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:39,910
uh on a personal level and at a higher
sort of

3728
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:39,920
sort of
 

3729
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,750
sort of
level of studies that you're aware of

3730

and so on what do you think about

3734
00:59:45,190 --> 00:59:45,200
and so on what do you think about
 

3735
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,950
and so on what do you think about
intermittent fasting of like

3736
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:46,960
intermittent fasting of like
 

3737
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:49,750
intermittent fasting of like

day meal
 

3993
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,230

is that anytime you have a lot of food

in the gut you're increasing sleepiness

3996

in the gut you're increasing sleepiness
 

3997
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:46,069
in the gut you're increasing sleepiness
because you're diverting blood to the

3998
01:03:46,069 --> 01:03:46,079
because you're diverting blood to the
 

3999
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:48,710
because you're diverting blood to the
gut it's going to trigger the vagus to

gut it's going to trigger the vagus to
 

4001
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:50,710
gut it's going to trigger the vagus to

signal to the brain to shut down your
 

4003
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:53,190
signal to the brain to shut down your
system and utilize those nutrients can

4004
01:03:53,190 --> 01:03:53,200
system and utilize those nutrients can
 

4005
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:53,430
system and utilize those nutrients can
you

4006
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:53,440
you
 

4007
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:55,589
you
digest and utilize those nutrients so

4008
01:03:55,589 --> 01:03:55,599
digest and utilize those nutrients so
 

4009
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:56,870
digest and utilize those nutrients so
i've done the once

4010
01:03:56,870 --> 01:03:56,880
i've done the once
 

4011
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:58,950
i've done the once
a day eating thing the problem is i eat

4012
01:03:58,950 --> 01:03:58,960
a day eating thing the problem is i eat
 

4013
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:02,069
a day eating thing the problem is i eat
so much in that meal that i'm exhausted

4014
01:04:02,069 --> 01:04:02,079
so much in that meal that i'm exhausted
 

4015
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:04,069
so much in that meal that i'm exhausted
and so it doesn't always lend itself

4016
01:04:04,069 --> 01:04:04,079
and so it doesn't always lend itself
 

4017
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:05,589
and so it doesn't always lend itself
well to the schedule

4018
01:04:05,589 --> 01:04:05,599
well to the schedule
 

4019
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:07,510
well to the schedule
but so in a six or eight hour eating

4020
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:07,520
but so in a six or eight hour eating
 

4021
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,910
but so in a six or eight hour eating
block for me is a little bit better

4022
01:04:09,910 --> 01:04:09,920
block for me is a little bit better
 

4023
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:11,589
block for me is a little bit better
i do eat carbohydrates i'm probably one

experienced
except while he had fasted and he said

4196
01:06:50,789 --> 01:06:50,799
except while he had fasted and he said
 

4197
01:06:50,799 --> 01:06:52,150
except while he had fasted and he said
that that was a remarkable

4198
01:06:52,150 --> 01:06:52,160
that that was a remarkable
 

4199
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:54,470
that that was a remarkable
clarity of mind energy it's a little bit

4200
01:06:54,470 --> 01:06:54,480
clarity of mind energy it's a little bit
 

4201
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:55,349
clarity of mind energy it's a little bit
of what you described

4202
01:06:55,349 --> 01:06:55,359
of what you described
 

4203
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:56,950
of what you described
he described a kind of suppleness and

4204
01:06:56,950 --> 01:06:56,960
he described a kind of suppleness and
 

4205
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:58,789
he described a kind of suppleness and
explosiveness so there's probably

4206
01:06:58,789 --> 01:06:58,799
explosiveness so there's probably
 

4207
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:00,309
explosiveness so there's probably
something there on which day

4208
01:07:00,309 --> 01:07:00,319
something there on which day
 

4209
01:07:00,319 --> 01:07:03,109
something there on which day
uh at once he was in the fifth or sixth

4210
01:07:03,109 --> 01:07:03,119
uh at once he was in the fifth or sixth
 

4211
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:04,309
uh at once he was in the fifth or sixth
day of the february see this is the

4212
01:07:04,309 --> 01:07:04,319
day of the february see this is the
 

4213
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:05,910
day of the february see this is the
thing is i've never been there

4214
01:07:05,910 --> 01:07:05,920
thing is i've never been there
 

4215
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:08,710
thing is i've never been there
uh on the second third fourth fifth day

4216
01:07:08,710 --> 01:07:08,720
uh on the second third fourth fifth day
 

4217
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:09,829
uh on the second third fourth fifth day
that kind of thing

4218
01:07:09,829 --> 01:07:09,839
that kind of thing
 

4219
01:07:09,839 --> 01:07:14,950
that kind of thing
but when i just don't eat for 20 hours

4220
01:07:14,950 --> 01:07:14,960
but when i just don't eat for 20 hours
 

4221
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:17,990
but when i just don't eat for 20 hours
many times through my training the

4222
01:07:17,990 --> 01:07:18,000
many times through my training the
 

4223
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:18,710
many times through my training the
clarity

4224
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:18,720
clarity
 

4225
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:21,029
clarity
it's like you feel like everyone is

4226
01:07:21,029 --> 01:07:21,039
it's like you feel like everyone is
 

4227
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:23,029
it's like you feel like everyone is
moving super slowly

4228
01:07:23,029 --> 01:07:23,039
moving super slowly
 

4229
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:25,349
moving super slowly
and you're able to like dominate people

4230
01:07:25,349 --> 01:07:25,359
and you're able to like dominate people
 

4231
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:27,510
and you're able to like dominate people
you weren't able to before it's like

4232
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:27,520
you weren't able to before it's like
 

4233
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:29,589
you weren't able to before it's like
well you might have slipped into or

4234
01:07:29,589 --> 01:07:29,599
well you might have slipped into or
 

4235
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:32,390
well you might have slipped into or
switched over rather into full ketosis

4236
01:07:32,390 --> 01:07:32,400
switched over rather into full ketosis
 

4237
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:35,270
switched over rather into full ketosis
and ketogenic diets done properly can be

4238
01:07:35,270 --> 01:07:35,280
and ketogenic diets done properly can be
 

4239
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:36,230
and ketogenic diets done properly can be
great for people

4240
01:07:36,230 --> 01:07:36,240
great for people
 

4241
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:37,589
great for people
the problem is if you do it wrong you

4242
01:07:37,589 --> 01:07:37,599
the problem is if you do it wrong you
 

4243
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:39,430
the problem is if you do it wrong you
can really mess it up i tried it once

4244
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:39,440
can really mess it up i tried it once
 

4245
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:40,950
can really mess it up i tried it once
and i basically got psoriasis i thought

4246
01:07:40,950 --> 01:07:40,960
and i basically got psoriasis i thought
 

4247
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:42,470
and i basically got psoriasis i thought
my scalp was going to fall off i was

4248
01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:42,480
my scalp was going to fall off i was
 

4249
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:44,150
my scalp was going to fall off i was
like slothing off all this

4250
01:07:44,150 --> 01:07:44,160
like slothing off all this
 

4251
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,910
like slothing off all this
and i stopped and i was taking the

4252
01:07:45,910 --> 01:07:45,920
and i stopped and i was taking the
 

4253
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:47,670
and i stopped and i was taking the
liquid ketones and then all of a sudden

4254
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:47,680
liquid ketones and then all of a sudden
 

4255
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:48,870
liquid ketones and then all of a sudden
i felt better again

4256
01:07:48,870 --> 01:07:48,880
i felt better again
 

4257
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:51,990
i felt better again
but i was told that i just did it wrong

4258
01:07:51,990 --> 01:07:52,000
but i was told that i just did it wrong
 

4259
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,390
but i was told that i just did it wrong
yes um that's so i think there's a right

4260
01:07:54,390 --> 01:07:54,400
yes um that's so i think there's a right
 

4261
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:56,150
yes um that's so i think there's a right
way and a wrong way and you have to get

4262
01:07:56,150 --> 01:07:56,160
way and a wrong way and you have to get
 

4263
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:56,710
way and a wrong way and you have to get
it right

4264
01:07:56,710 --> 01:07:56,720
it right
 

4265
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:58,630
it right
definitely and so i've experimented

4266
01:07:58,630 --> 01:07:58,640
definitely and so i've experimented
 

4267
01:07:58,640 --> 01:07:59,910
definitely and so i've experimented
quite a bit with keto too

4268
01:07:59,910 --> 01:07:59,920
quite a bit with keto too
 

4269
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:01,750
quite a bit with keto too
to see how my body feels and doing it

4270
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:01,760
to see how my body feels and doing it
 

4271
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:03,029
to see how my body feels and doing it
the right way and following all the

4272
01:08:03,029 --> 01:08:03,039
the right way and following all the
 

4273
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:03,670
the right way and following all the
instructions

4274
01:08:03,670 --> 01:08:03,680
instructions
 

4275
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:06,549
instructions
there's definitely a huge difference

4276
01:08:06,549 --> 01:08:06,559
there's definitely a huge difference
 

4277
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:07,349
there's definitely a huge difference
that

4278
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:07,359
that
 

4279
01:08:07,359 --> 01:08:08,789
that
like for example one of the things i

4280
01:08:08,789 --> 01:08:08,799
like for example one of the things i
 

4281
01:08:08,799 --> 01:08:10,549
like for example one of the things i
discovered everyone always said this

4282
01:08:10,549 --> 01:08:10,559
discovered everyone always said this
 

4283
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:13,750
discovered everyone always said this
and but i tried this uh recently

4284
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:13,760
and but i tried this uh recently
 

4285
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:17,030
and but i tried this uh recently
over the past year as i started drinking

4286
01:08:17,030 --> 01:08:17,040
over the past year as i started drinking
 

4287
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:19,749
over the past year as i started drinking
when i don't feel great if i'm fasting

4288
01:08:19,749 --> 01:08:19,759
when i don't feel great if i'm fasting
 

4289
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:21,430
when i don't feel great if i'm fasting
uh bone broth

4290
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:21,440
uh bone broth
 

4291
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:23,430
uh bone broth
chicken bone broth oh yeah and for some

4292
01:08:23,430 --> 01:08:23,440
chicken bone broth oh yeah and for some
 

4293
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:25,590
chicken bone broth oh yeah and for some
reason like magically it could be

4294
01:08:25,590 --> 01:08:25,600
reason like magically it could be
 

4295
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,669
reason like magically it could be
this is the other thing the mind i don't

4296
01:08:27,669 --> 01:08:27,679
this is the other thing the mind i don't
 

4297
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:29,510
this is the other thing the mind i don't
know but it makes me feel

4298
01:08:29,510 --> 01:08:29,520
know but it makes me feel
 

4299
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:32,709
know but it makes me feel
really good well it could be the salt

4300
01:08:32,709 --> 01:08:32,719
really good well it could be the salt
 

4301
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:35,030
really good well it could be the salt
so i mean neurons the action potential

4302
01:08:35,030 --> 01:08:35,040
so i mean neurons the action potential
 

4303
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:36,789
so i mean neurons the action potential
neurons as you know is sodium's rushing

electrolytes that i mean we should have
 

4351
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:17,749
electrolytes that i mean we should have
actually talked about that at the

4380
01:09:43,510 --> 01:09:43,520
i mean this is a vast space and we're
 

4381
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:44,630
i mean this is a vast space and we're
kind of talking about the overlap

4382
01:09:44,630 --> 01:09:44,640
kind of talking about the overlap
 

4383
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:45,749
kind of talking about the overlap
between

4384
01:09:45,749 --> 01:09:45,759

neurochemicals hormones and nutrition
and it's a fascinating space and it's

4388
01:09:49,910 --> 01:09:49,920
and it's a fascinating space and it's
 

4389
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:50,550
and it's a fascinating space and it's
one that

4390
01:09:50,550 --> 01:09:50,560

4399
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:59,110
sphere yet
and i think that's because people get so

4400
01:09:59,110 --> 01:09:59,120
and i think that's because people get so
 

4401

yeah you realize that like you have to

4684
01:14:21,510 --> 01:14:21,520
yeah you realize that like you have to
 

4685
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:23,270
yeah you realize that like you have to
become a scientist first of all you have

4686
01:14:23,270 --> 01:14:23,280
become a scientist first of all you have
 

4687
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:25,189
become a scientist first of all you have
to read literature you have to learn you

4688
01:14:25,189 --> 01:14:25,199
to read literature you have to learn you
 

4689
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:26,950
to read literature you have to learn you
experiment but you also have to

4690
01:14:26,950 --> 01:14:26,960
experiment but you also have to
 

4691
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:28,950
experiment but you also have to
become a scientist of your own body and

4692
01:14:28,950 --> 01:14:28,960
become a scientist of your own body and
 

4693
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:30,310
become a scientist of your own body and
in the same way

4694
01:14:30,310 --> 01:14:30,320
in the same way
 

4695
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:32,070
in the same way
i have a lot of preconceived notions of

4696
01:14:32,070 --> 01:14:32,080
i have a lot of preconceived notions of
 

4697
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:33,910
i have a lot of preconceived notions of
what performance is like

4698
01:14:33,910 --> 01:14:33,920
what performance is like
 

4699
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:37,030
what performance is like
under vegan diet and i want to do it

4700
01:14:37,030 --> 01:14:37,040
under vegan diet and i want to do it
 

4701
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:40,310
under vegan diet and i want to do it
right like seriously not not

4702
01:14:40,310 --> 01:14:40,320
right like seriously not not
 

4703
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:42,229
right like seriously not not
necessarily for the ethical reasons but

4704
01:14:42,229 --> 01:14:42,239
necessarily for the ethical reasons but
 

4705
01:14:42,239 --> 01:14:44,470
necessarily for the ethical reasons but
to see if it's performance wise

4706
01:14:44,470 --> 01:14:44,480
to see if it's performance wise
 

4707
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,550
to see if it's performance wise
like can i remember there's like a

4708
01:14:46,550 --> 01:14:46,560
like can i remember there's like a
 

4709
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:49,590
like can i remember there's like a
fruitarian diet where you eat fruit only

4710
01:14:49,590 --> 01:14:49,600
fruitarian diet where you eat fruit only
 

4711
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:52,070
fruitarian diet where you eat fruit only
you know these extremes are like they're

4712
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:52,080
you know these extremes are like they're
 

4713
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:53,430
you know these extremes are like they're
pretty they're interesting because

4714
01:14:53,430 --> 01:14:53,440
pretty they're interesting because
 

4715
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:54,229
pretty they're interesting because
people have

4716
01:14:54,229 --> 01:14:54,239
people have
 

4717
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:56,630
people have
this need the extremes are informative

4718
01:14:56,630 --> 01:14:56,640
this need the extremes are informative
 

4719
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:57,510
this need the extremes are informative
though right i mean

4720
01:14:57,510 --> 01:14:57,520
though right i mean
 

4721
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:58,790
though right i mean
well-controlled experiments you

4722
01:14:58,790 --> 01:14:58,800
well-controlled experiments you
 

4723
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,630
well-controlled experiments you
eliminate as many variables as you can

4724
01:15:00,630 --> 01:15:00,640
eliminate as many variables as you can
 

4725
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,470

except the one you're interested in so
 

4727
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:04,790

people are running these experiments i i

4728
01:15:04,790 --> 01:15:04,800
people are running these experiments i i
 

4729
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,189
people are running these experiments i i
think that

4730
01:15:07,189 --> 01:15:07,199
think that
 

4731
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:10,070
think that
it's hard to imagine getting i know

4732
01:15:10,070 --> 01:15:10,080
it's hard to imagine getting i know
 

4733
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:11,750
it's hard to imagine getting i know
people say you can get enough amino

4734
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:11,760

4737
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,470
acids
from plant-based sources and i believe

4738
01:15:14,470 --> 01:15:14,480
from plant-based sources and i believe
 

4739
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:15,590
from plant-based sources and i believe
that i

4740
01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:15,600
that i
 

4741
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:16,950
that i
think it probably takes a little more

4742
01:15:16,950 --> 01:15:16,960
think it probably takes a little more
 

4743
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:19,590
think it probably takes a little more
work one thing that's really clear is

01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:21,510
work one thing that's really clear is
that the benefit of these

4746

some background
 

4899
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:50,229
some background
and then we did four episodes on sleep

4900
01:17:50,229 --> 01:17:50,239
and then we did four episodes on sleep
 

4901
01:17:50,239 --> 01:17:51,510
and then we did four episodes on sleep
including some stuff about food

folks and shift workers yeah it's like a
 

4909
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:58,149
folks and shift workers yeah it's like a
master class on sleep and then you're go

4910
01:17:58,149 --> 01:17:58,159
master class on sleep and then you're go
 

4911

master class on sleep and then you're go
you're going on to a next uh

01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:14,400
mind when it sleeps is dreaming
 

4925
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:18,550
mind when it sleeps is dreaming
uh what do you think we understand about

4926
01:18:18,550 --> 01:18:18,560
uh what do you think we understand about
 

4927
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:21,669
uh what do you think we understand about
the contents of dreams like what do

4928
01:18:21,669 --> 01:18:21,679
the contents of dreams like what do
 

4929
01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:23,990
the contents of dreams like what do
dreams mean all the stuff we see when we

4930
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:24,000
dreams mean all the stuff we see when we
 

4931
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,270
dreams mean all the stuff we see when we
dream

4932
01:18:25,270 --> 01:18:25,280
dream
 

4933
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:28,550
dream
is there something that we understand

4934
01:18:28,550 --> 01:18:28,560
is there something that we understand
 

4935
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:29,030
is there something that we understand
about

4936
01:18:29,030 --> 01:18:29,040
about
 

4937
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:32,550
about
uh the contents of dreams some of it is

4938
01:18:32,550 --> 01:18:32,560
uh the contents of dreams some of it is
 

4939
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:34,310
uh the contents of dreams some of it is
very concrete so

4940
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:34,320
very concrete so
 

4941
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:37,910

matt wilson who mit um

4942
01:18:37,910 --> 01:18:37,920
matt wilson who mit um
 

4943
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:39,510
matt wilson who mit um
showed in rodents and it's been shown in

4944
01:18:39,510 --> 01:18:39,520
showed in rodents and it's been shown in
 

4945
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:40,950
showed in rodents and it's been shown in
non-human primates and now it's been

4946
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:40,960
non-human primates and now it's been
 

4947
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:42,709
non-human primates and now it's been
shown in humans that

4948
01:18:42,709 --> 01:18:42,719
shown in humans that
 

4949
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:46,149
shown in humans that
there is replay of spatial information

4950
01:18:46,149 --> 01:18:46,159
there is replay of spatial information
 

4951
01:18:46,159 --> 01:18:47,350
there is replay of spatial information
during sleep

4952
01:18:47,350 --> 01:18:47,360
during sleep
 

4953
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:50,310
during sleep
so initially what matt showed was that

4954
01:18:50,310 --> 01:18:50,320
so initially what matt showed was that
 

4955
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:50,630
so initially what matt showed was that
as

4956
01:18:50,630 --> 01:18:50,640
as
 

4957
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:52,390
as
these little rodents navigate through a

01:18:52,390 --> 01:18:52,400
these little rodents navigate through a

01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:53,669
these little rodents navigate through a
maze they're the cells in the

4960
01:18:53,669 --> 01:18:53,679
maze they're the cells in the
 

4961
01:18:53,679 --> 01:18:55,750
maze they're the cells in the
hippocampus called place cells that fire

4962
01:18:55,750 --> 01:18:55,760
hippocampus called place cells that fire
 

4963
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:56,229
hippocampus called place cells that fire
when the

4964
01:18:56,229 --> 01:18:56,239
when the
 

4965
01:18:56,239 --> 01:18:58,630
when the
animal encounters a turn or a corridor

4966
01:18:58,630 --> 01:18:58,640
animal encounters a turn or a corridor
 

4967
01:18:58,640 --> 01:18:59,270
animal encounters a turn or a corridor
and

4968
01:18:59,270 --> 01:18:59,280
and
 

4969
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:01,669
and
that same exact same sequence is replay

4970
01:19:01,669 --> 01:19:01,679
that same exact same sequence is replay
 

4971
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:02,550
that same exact same sequence is replay
during sleep

4972
01:19:02,550 --> 01:19:02,560
during sleep
 

4973
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:05,590
during sleep
and it turns out this is true in

4974
01:19:05,590 --> 01:19:05,600
and it turns out this is true in
 

4975
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:08,790
and it turns out this is true in
london taxi cab drivers before phones

4976
01:19:08,790 --> 01:19:08,800
london taxi cab drivers before phones
 

4977
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:10,870
london taxi cab drivers before phones
and gps were what they are today

4978
01:19:10,870 --> 01:19:10,880
and gps were what they are today
 

4979
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:13,270
and gps were what they are today
the london taxi cab drivers were famous

4980
01:19:13,270 --> 01:19:13,280
the london taxi cab drivers were famous
 

4981
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:15,830
the london taxi cab drivers were famous
for knowing the routes through the city

4982
01:19:15,830 --> 01:19:15,840
for knowing the routes through the city
 

4983
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:18,950
for knowing the routes through the city
through these mental maps and their

4984
01:19:18,950 --> 01:19:18,960
through these mental maps and their
 

4985
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:20,709
through these mental maps and their
analysis of their place cell firing

4986
01:19:20,709 --> 01:19:20,719
analysis of their place cell firing
 

4987
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:22,709
analysis of their place cell firing
during sleep and during wakefulness and

4988
01:19:22,709 --> 01:19:22,719
during sleep and during wakefulness and
 

4989
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:24,149
during sleep and during wakefulness and
so we are essentially

4990
01:19:24,149 --> 01:19:24,159
so we are essentially
 

4991
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:25,750
so we are essentially

5478
01:26:54,390 --> 01:26:54,400
that doesn't tend to happen in slow wave
 

5479
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:55,990
that doesn't tend to happen in slow wave
sleep dreams now all this of course is

5480
01:26:55,990 --> 01:26:56,000
sleep dreams now all this of course is
 

5481
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,669
sleep dreams now all this of course is
by waking people up and asking them what

5482
01:26:57,669 --> 01:26:57,679
by waking people up and asking them what
 

5483
01:26:57,679 --> 01:26:58,870
by waking people up and asking them what
they were dreaming about which

5484
01:26:58,870 --> 01:26:58,880
they were dreaming about which
 

5485
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:01,669
they were dreaming about which
from a standpoint of a ai guy or a

5486
01:27:01,669 --> 01:27:01,679
from a standpoint of a ai guy or a

machine learning

5488
01:27:02,470 --> 01:27:02,480
machine learning
 

5489
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:05,110
machine learning
or a is kind of like but it's the best

5490
01:27:05,110 --> 01:27:05,120
or a is kind of like but it's the best
 

5491
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:05,830
or a is kind of like but it's the best
we've got

5492
01:27:05,830 --> 01:27:05,840
we've got
 

5493
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:08,390
we've got
yes but brain imaging what in waking

5494
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:08,400
yes but brain imaging what in waking
 

5495
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:10,229
yes but brain imaging what in waking
states while people view a movie

5496
01:27:10,229 --> 01:27:10,239
states while people view a movie
 

5497
01:27:10,239 --> 01:27:11,830
states while people view a movie
and then brain imaging while people are

5498
01:27:11,830 --> 01:27:11,840
and then brain imaging while people are
 

5499
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:13,270
and then brain imaging while people are
sleeping supports the idea that that's

5500
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:13,280
sleeping supports the idea that that's
 

5501
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:15,270
sleeping supports the idea that that's
basically what's going on

5502
01:27:15,270 --> 01:27:15,280
basically what's going on
 

5503
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:17,669
basically what's going on
so rem sleep is amazing and you're not

5504
01:27:17,669 --> 01:27:17,679
so rem sleep is amazing and you're not
 

5505
01:27:17,679 --> 01:27:19,510
so rem sleep is amazing and you're not
going to get much of it during your

5506
01:27:19,510 --> 01:27:19,520
going to get much of it during your
 

5507
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:21,990
going to get much of it during your
about with uh goggins but you will

5508
01:27:21,990 --> 01:27:22,000
about with uh goggins but you will
 

5509
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,030
about with uh goggins but you will
afterward

5510
01:27:23,030 --> 01:27:23,040
afterward
 

5511
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:26,390
afterward
why so to comment why won't i

5512
01:27:26,390 --> 01:27:26,400
why so to comment why won't i
 

5513
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:28,709
why so to comment why won't i
so is it not possible to get into it

5514
01:27:28,709 --> 01:27:28,719
so is it not possible to get into it
 

5515
01:27:28,719 --> 01:27:30,229
so is it not possible to get into it
real quick

5516
01:27:30,229 --> 01:27:30,239
real quick
 

5517
01:27:30,239 --> 01:27:32,790
real quick
only if you're very very sleep deprived

5518
01:27:32,790 --> 01:27:32,800
only if you're very very sleep deprived
 

5519
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:34,310
only if you're very very sleep deprived
but because you're going to be at

5520
01:27:34,310 --> 01:27:34,320
but because you're going to be at
 

5521
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:36,390
but because you're going to be at
high muscular output that's going to

5522
01:27:36,390 --> 01:27:36,400
high muscular output that's going to
 

5523
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:38,470
high muscular output that's going to
bias you towards more slow wave sleep

5524
01:27:38,470 --> 01:27:38,480
bias you towards more slow wave sleep
 

5525
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:41,910
bias you towards more slow wave sleep
overall and your body

5526
01:27:41,910 --> 01:27:41,920
overall and your body
 

5527
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:44,629
overall and your body
and brain are smart they it will know

5528
01:27:44,629 --> 01:27:44,639
and brain are smart they it will know
 

5529
01:27:44,639 --> 01:27:45,669
and brain are smart they it will know
they will know

5530
01:27:45,669 --> 01:27:45,679
they will know
 

5531
01:27:45,679 --> 01:27:49,189
they will know
that your main goal is to recover

5532
01:27:49,189 --> 01:27:49,199
that your main goal is to recover
 

5533
01:27:49,199 --> 01:27:50,870
that your main goal is to recover
so you can keep going so you can keep

5534
01:27:50,870 --> 01:27:50,880
so you can keep going so you can keep
 

5535
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:52,629
so you can keep going so you can keep
firing neuromuscular contractions and

5536
01:27:52,629 --> 01:27:52,639
firing neuromuscular contractions and
 

5537
01:27:52,639 --> 01:27:54,629
firing neuromuscular contractions and
you can keep running so that you can

5538
01:27:54,629 --> 01:27:54,639
you can keep running so that you can
 

5539
01:27:54,639 --> 01:27:56,229
you can keep running so that you can
i mean it's amazing to think like why do

5540
01:27:56,229 --> 01:27:56,239
i mean it's amazing to think like why do
 

5541
01:27:56,239 --> 01:27:57,830
i mean it's amazing to think like why do
we ever stop

5542
01:27:57,830 --> 01:27:57,840
we ever stop
 

5543
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:00,229
we ever stop
unlike weight training where i can't do

5544
01:28:00,229 --> 01:28:00,239
unlike weight training where i can't do
 

5545
01:28:00,239 --> 01:28:02,870
unlike weight training where i can't do
a 500 pound deadlift i just can't

5546
01:28:02,870 --> 01:28:02,880
a 500 pound deadlift i just can't
 

5547
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:04,310
a 500 pound deadlift i just can't
i could train for it but i certainly

5548
01:28:04,310 --> 01:28:04,320
i could train for it but i certainly
 

5549
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:07,270
i could train for it but i certainly
can't do a 600 pound i can't do that

5550
01:28:07,270 --> 01:28:07,280
can't do a 600 pound i can't do that
 

5551
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:10,149
can't do a 600 pound i can't do that
what causes us to stop an endurance

problem i mean neuroscientists don't

5562
01:28:18,629 --> 01:28:18,639
problem i mean neuroscientists don't
 

5563
01:28:18,639 --> 01:28:20,149

01:28:20,159 --> 01:28:22,350
tend to think about those sorts of

problems because it sounds so
 

5567
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:24,470
problems because it sounds so
non-neuroscientific but that's

01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:26,629
they're like this isn't worth it it's
helpless they're just this isn't worth

5638
01:29:26,629 --> 01:29:26,639
helpless they're just this isn't worth
 

5639
01:29:26,639 --> 01:29:28,310
helpless they're just this isn't worth
my time and energy but this is where the

5640
01:29:28,310 --> 01:29:28,320
my time and energy but this is where the
 

5641
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:29,830
my time and energy but this is where the
difference between humans

5642
01:29:29,830 --> 01:29:29,840
difference between humans
 

5643
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:32,629
difference between humans
and non-human animals is interesting

5644
01:29:32,629 --> 01:29:32,639
and non-human animals is interesting
 

5645
01:29:32,639 --> 01:29:32,950
and non-human animals is interesting
because

5646
01:29:32,950 --> 01:29:32,960
because
 

5647
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:34,870
because
it does feel like humans have an extra

5648
01:29:34,870 --> 01:29:34,880
it does feel like humans have an extra
 

5649
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:36,830
it does feel like humans have an extra
level of cognitive

5650
01:29:36,830 --> 01:29:36,840
level of cognitive
 

5651
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:39,990
level of cognitive
ability that might

5652
01:29:39,990 --> 01:29:40,000
ability that might
 

5653
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,950
ability that might
be relevant here well you can pull from

5654
01:29:42,950 --> 01:29:42,960
be relevant here well you can pull from
 

5655
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:44,629
be relevant here well you can pull from
different time references

5656
01:29:44,629 --> 01:29:44,639
different time references
 

5657
01:29:44,639 --> 01:29:46,870
different time references
so if you're in that moment you're gonna

5658
01:29:46,870 --> 01:29:46,880
so if you're in that moment you're gonna
 

5659
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:48,550
so if you're in that moment you're gonna
need a kit of things to

5660
01:29:48,550 --> 01:29:48,560
need a kit of things to
 

5661
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:51,350
need a kit of things to
pull from so you can think this is in

5662
01:29:51,350 --> 01:29:51,360
pull from so you can think this is in
 

5663
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,590
pull from so you can think this is in
honor of someone else that passed away

5664
01:29:53,590 --> 01:29:53,600
honor of someone else that passed away
 

5665
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:56,470
honor of someone else that passed away
right and you will find a gas reserve

5666
01:29:56,470 --> 01:29:56,480
right and you will find a gas reserve
 

5667
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:57,750
right and you will find a gas reserve
that's amazing

5668
01:29:57,750 --> 01:29:57,760
that's amazing
 

5669
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:00,149
that's amazing
right now whether or not mice are like i

5670
01:30:00,149 --> 01:30:00,159
right now whether or not mice are like i
 

5671

right now whether or not mice are like i
remember my brother back in the other

5672
01:30:01,830 --> 01:30:01,840
remember my brother back in the other
 

5673
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:03,350
remember my brother back in the other
cage when i was a little mouse

5674
01:30:03,350 --> 01:30:03,360
cage when i was a little mouse
 

5675
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:06,470
cage when i was a little mouse
you know we don't know but it's

5676
01:30:06,470 --> 01:30:06,480
you know we don't know but it's
 

5677
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:08,470
you know we don't know but it's
very likely that they don't do that that

5678
01:30:08,470 --> 01:30:08,480
very likely that they don't do that that
 

5679
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:09,990
very likely that they don't do that that
they're so present they're in the

5680
01:30:09,990 --> 01:30:10,000
they're so present they're in the
 

5681
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:10,950
they're so present they're in the
experience of

5682
01:30:10,950 --> 01:30:10,960
experience of
 

5683
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:12,950
experience of
there and then and now that they aren't

5684
01:30:12,950 --> 01:30:12,960
there and then and now that they aren't
 

5685
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:14,790
there and then and now that they aren't
able to extract

5686
01:30:14,790 --> 01:30:14,800
able to extract
 

5687
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:17,270
able to extract
from the past and they're not able to

5688
01:30:17,270 --> 01:30:17,280
from the past and they're not able to
 

5689
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:19,030
from the past and they're not able to
project into the future like how great

5690
01:30:19,030 --> 01:30:19,040
project into the future like how great
 

5691
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:20,550
project into the future like how great
it's going to feel when i get to the end

5692
01:30:20,550 --> 01:30:20,560
it's going to feel when i get to the end
 

5693
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:23,669
it's going to feel when i get to the end
of this really lame vr corridor i don't

5694
01:30:23,669 --> 01:30:23,679
of this really lame vr corridor i don't
 

5695
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:24,950
of this really lame vr corridor i don't
think they think about that

5696
01:30:24,950 --> 01:30:24,960
think they think about that
 

5697
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:28,550
think they think about that
and and think about like if i quit now

5698
01:30:28,550 --> 01:30:28,560
and and think about like if i quit now
 

5699
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:30,310
and and think about like if i quit now
how would i have what kind of effect

5700
01:30:30,310 --> 01:30:30,320
how would i have what kind of effect
 

5701

01:30:33,350 --> 01:30:33,360
future difficult times
 

5705
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:35,110
future difficult times
like if you allow yourself to quit in

5706
01:30:35,110 --> 01:30:35,120
like if you allow yourself to quit in
 

5707
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:36,790
like if you allow yourself to quit in
this particular moment you'll become a

this particular moment you'll become a
 

5709
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:38,790
this particular moment you'll become a
quitter more and more in life and then

5710
01:30:38,790 --> 01:30:38,800
quitter more and more in life and then
 

5711
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:40,629
quitter more and more in life and then
you're going to not get the the other

5712

you're going to not get the the other
 

5713

you went there the whole way to

5720
01:30:48,870 --> 01:30:48,880
you went there the whole way to
 

5721
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:50,550
you went there the whole way to
evolution and back again i mean but

5722
01:30:50,550 --> 01:30:50,560
evolution and back again i mean but
 

5723
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:52,149
evolution and back again i mean but
that's that's really it i mean our

5724
01:30:52,149 --> 01:30:52,159
that's that's really it i mean our
 

5725
01:30:52,159 --> 01:30:52,950
that's that's really it i mean our
ability

5726
01:30:52,950 --> 01:30:52,960
ability
 

5727
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:55,510
ability
to time reference in the past present or

5728
01:30:55,510 --> 01:30:55,520
to time reference in the past present or
 

5729
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:57,510
to time reference in the past present or
future i do believe that we can be in

5730
01:30:57,510 --> 01:30:57,520
future i do believe that we can be in
 

5731
01:30:57,520 --> 01:30:59,830
future i do believe that we can be in
the present and the past or the present

01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:02,950
and the future
or only in the present or only in the

5736
01:31:02,950 --> 01:31:02,960
or only in the present or only in the
 

5737
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:04,470
or only in the present or only in the
future only in the past but i don't

5738
01:31:04,470 --> 01:31:04,480
future only in the past but i don't
 

5739
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:05,830
future only in the past but i don't
think that we can really think about

5740
01:31:05,830 --> 01:31:05,840
think that we can really think about
 

5741
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:08,070
think that we can really think about
past present and future all at once

5742
01:31:08,070 --> 01:31:08,080
past present and future all at once
 

5743
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:10,310
past present and future all at once
and this has a similarity to covert

5744
01:31:10,310 --> 01:31:10,320
and this has a similarity to covert
 

5745
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:12,070

attention like we can split our visual

5746
01:31:12,070 --> 01:31:12,080
attention like we can split our visual
 

5747
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:13,590
attention like we can split our visual
attention into two things

5748
01:31:13,590 --> 01:31:13,600
attention into two things
 

5749
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:15,750
attention into two things
we really can duo task even though we

5750
01:31:15,750 --> 01:31:15,760
we really can duo task even though we
 

5751
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:16,709
we really can duo task even though we
can't multitask

5752
01:31:16,709 --> 01:31:16,719
can't multitask
 

5753
01:31:16,719 --> 01:31:18,149
can't multitask
or we can bring those two spotlights of

5754
01:31:18,149 --> 01:31:18,159
or we can bring those two spotlights of
 

5755
01:31:18,159 --> 01:31:19,910
or we can bring those two spotlights of
attention to the same location

5756
01:31:19,910 --> 01:31:19,920
attention to the same location
 

5757
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:21,510
attention to the same location
but it's very hard to split our

5758
01:31:21,510 --> 01:31:21,520
but it's very hard to split our
 

5759
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:23,430
but it's very hard to split our
attention and really well into

5760
01:31:23,430 --> 01:31:23,440
attention and really well into
 

5761
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:25,189
attention and really well into
three domains excuse me into three

5762
01:31:25,189 --> 01:31:25,199
three domains excuse me into three
 

5763
01:31:25,199 --> 01:31:26,470
three domains excuse me into three
domains

5764

domains
 

5765
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:28,470
domains
i think that that's very very

5766
01:31:28,470 --> 01:31:28,480
i think that that's very very
 

5767
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:30,310
i think that that's very very
challenging and time

5768
01:31:30,310 --> 01:31:30,320
challenging and time
 

5769
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:32,950
challenging and time
our time referencing scheme tends to be

5770
01:31:32,950 --> 01:31:32,960
our time referencing scheme tends to be
 

5771
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:33,830
our time referencing scheme tends to be
just

5772
01:31:33,830 --> 01:31:33,840
just
 

5773
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:36,870
just
one or two time references

5774
01:31:36,870 --> 01:31:36,880
one or two time references
 

5775
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:39,669
one or two time references

how
psychedelics and dreaming are very

psychedelics and dreaming are very
 

6049
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:03,030
psychedelics and dreaming are very
similar that was way back when i was in

and how similar they
 

6059
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:13,750
and how similar they
are i think psychedelics and matt knows

are i think psychedelics and matt knows
 

6061
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:15,109
are i think psychedelics and matt knows
way more about this than i do of course

way more about this than i do of course

but
 

6065
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:18,790

major issues
 

6097
01:36:45,119 --> 01:36:47,830
major issues
one is that people talk about plasticity

6098
01:36:47,830 --> 01:36:47,840
one is that people talk about plasticity
 

6099
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:50,070
one is that people talk about plasticity
as if plasticity is the goal

6100
01:36:50,070 --> 01:36:50,080
as if plasticity is the goal
 

6101
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:52,070
as if plasticity is the goal
but plasticity is a state within which

but plasticity is a state within which

you can direct neurology and the

01:36:53,669 --> 01:36:53,679
you can direct neurology and the
 

6105
01:36:53,679 --> 01:36:54,550
you can direct neurology and the
question is

6106
01:36:54,550 --> 01:36:54,560
question is
 

6107
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:56,870
question is
what changes are you trying to get to so

6108
01:36:56,870 --> 01:36:56,880
what changes are you trying to get to so
 

6109
01:36:56,880 --> 01:36:58,629
what changes are you trying to get to so
people are just taking psychedelics to

but mdma ecstasy
 

6183
01:38:11,199 --> 01:38:13,830
but mdma ecstasy
is a very unusual situation where

is a very unusual situation where

is a very unusual situation where
dopamine is

dopamine is
 

6187
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:17,189
dopamine is
very very high because of the the way

dopamine release it goes through the
 

6193
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:22,070

roof so people feel
 

6195
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:23,910
roof so people feel
great and they want to move and they

6196
01:38:23,910 --> 01:38:23,920
great and they want to move and they
 

6197
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:25,109
great and they want to move and they
have a lot of energy

have a lot of energy
 

6199
01:38:25,119 --> 01:38:27,590
have a lot of energy
but serotonin levels are also high and

6200
01:38:27,590 --> 01:38:27,600
but serotonin levels are also high and
 

6201
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:30,310
but serotonin levels are also high and
that's a very unnatural state

6202
01:38:30,310 --> 01:38:30,320
that's a very unnatural state
 

6203
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:34,070
that's a very unnatural state
and why mdma may may and i want to

certain forms of depression
 

6211
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:43,910
certain forms of depression
is an interesting question because never

6212
01:38:43,910 --> 01:38:43,920
is an interesting question because never
 

6213
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:44,950
is an interesting question because never
before in

6214
01:38:44,950 --> 01:38:44,960
before in

01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:47,669
before in
as far as we know in human history has

as far as we know in human history has
 

6217
01:38:47,679 --> 01:38:48,950
as far as we know in human history has
there been

6218
01:38:48,950 --> 01:38:48,960
there been
 

6219
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:51,270
there been
a possibility of opening up dopaminergic

6220
01:38:51,270 --> 01:38:51,280
a possibility of opening up dopaminergic
 

6221
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:52,870
a possibility of opening up dopaminergic
and serotonergic states at the same time

6222
01:38:52,870 --> 01:38:52,880
and serotonergic states at the same time
 

6223
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:54,550
and serotonergic states at the same time
dopamine being the molecule pursuit and

6224
01:38:54,550 --> 01:38:54,560
dopamine being the molecule pursuit and
 

6225
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:56,229
dopamine being the molecule pursuit and
reward and more and more

6226
01:38:56,229 --> 01:38:56,239
reward and more and more
 

6227
01:38:56,239 --> 01:38:58,629
reward and more and more
and serotonin being one of bliss and

6228
01:38:58,629 --> 01:38:58,639
and serotonin being one of bliss and
 

6229
01:38:58,639 --> 01:39:00,070
and serotonin being one of bliss and
being content right where you're at so

6230
01:39:00,070 --> 01:39:00,080
being content right where you're at so
 

6231
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:01,430
being content right where you're at so
it's almost like those two things wrap

6232
01:39:01,430 --> 01:39:01,440
it's almost like those two things wrap
 

6233
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:03,189
it's almost like those two things wrap
back on themselves and create this very

6234
01:39:03,189 --> 01:39:03,199
back on themselves and create this very
 

6235
01:39:03,199 --> 01:39:04,390
back on themselves and create this very
unusual state

6236
01:39:04,390 --> 01:39:04,400
unusual state
 

6237
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:06,390
unusual state
and i think the bigger conversation is

6238
01:39:06,390 --> 01:39:06,400
and i think the bigger conversation is
 

6239
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:08,149
and i think the bigger conversation is
what to do with a state like that

6240
01:39:08,149 --> 01:39:08,159
what to do with a state like that
 

6241
01:39:08,159 --> 01:39:11,189
what to do with a state like that
like do you is it about self-love

6242
01:39:11,189 --> 01:39:11,199
like do you is it about self-love
 

6243
01:39:11,199 --> 01:39:12,950
like do you is it about self-love
is it about developing love for another

6244
01:39:12,950 --> 01:39:12,960
is it about developing love for another
 

6245
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:15,109
is it about developing love for another
person is it about forgetting hate

6246
01:39:15,109 --> 01:39:15,119
person is it about forgetting hate
 

6247
01:39:15,119 --> 01:39:17,270
person is it about forgetting hate
like these are powerful molecules and i

6248
01:39:17,270 --> 01:39:17,280
like these are powerful molecules and i
 

6249
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:19,109
like these are powerful molecules and i
think if the academic community

6250
01:39:19,109 --> 01:39:19,119
think if the academic community
 

6251
01:39:19,119 --> 01:39:20,229
think if the academic community
and the clinical community is going to

6252
01:39:20,229 --> 01:39:20,239
and the clinical community is going to
 

6253
01:39:20,239 --> 01:39:21,830
and the clinical community is going to
move forward with them in any serious

6254
01:39:21,830 --> 01:39:21,840
move forward with them in any serious
 

6255
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:22,470
move forward with them in any serious
way

6256
01:39:22,470 --> 01:39:22,480
way
 

6257
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:24,229
way
i think there needs to be a conversation

6258
01:39:24,229 --> 01:39:24,239
i think there needs to be a conversation
 

6259
01:39:24,239 --> 01:39:26,149
i think there needs to be a conversation
about what

6260
01:39:26,149 --> 01:39:26,159
about what
 

6261
01:39:26,159 --> 01:39:29,350
about what
they're being used for right and and

6262
01:39:29,350 --> 01:39:29,360
they're being used for right and and
 

6263
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:31,510
they're being used for right and and
coupled with that i think similar to

6264
01:39:31,510 --> 01:39:31,520
coupled with that i think similar to
 

6265
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:32,790
coupled with that i think similar to
what you're saying

6266
01:39:32,790 --> 01:39:32,800
what you're saying
 

6267
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:34,470
what you're saying
like matt has talked about is others

6268
01:39:34,470 --> 01:39:34,480
like matt has talked about is others
 

6269
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:35,830
like matt has talked about is others
have talked about

6270
01:39:35,830 --> 01:39:35,840
have talked about
 

6271
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:39,189
have talked about
some of the biggest benefits of like

6272
01:39:39,189 --> 01:39:39,199
some of the biggest benefits of like
 

6273
01:39:39,199 --> 01:39:40,629
some of the biggest benefits of like
progress whether it's like quitting

6274
01:39:40,629 --> 01:39:40,639
progress whether it's like quitting
 

6275
01:39:40,639 --> 01:39:42,790
progress whether it's like quitting
smoking and all those kind of stuff

6276
01:39:42,790 --> 01:39:42,800
smoking and all those kind of stuff
 

6277
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:45,510
smoking and all those kind of stuff
is in the is in the days after it's the

6278
01:39:45,510 --> 01:39:45,520
is in the is in the days after it's the
 

6279
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:47,510
is in the is in the days after it's the
integration of the experience

6280
01:39:47,510 --> 01:39:47,520
integration of the experience
 

6281
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:49,669
integration of the experience
so maybe you open up the brain to the

6282
01:39:49,669 --> 01:39:49,679
so maybe you open up the brain to the
 

6283
01:39:49,679 --> 01:39:51,350
so maybe you open up the brain to the
neuroplasticity but then there's like

6284
01:39:51,350 --> 01:39:51,360
neuroplasticity but then there's like
 

6285
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:52,229
neuroplasticity but then there's like
work to be done

6286
01:39:52,229 --> 01:39:52,239
work to be done
 

6287
01:39:52,239 --> 01:39:54,550
work to be done
it's not you're like you shake up

6288
01:39:54,550 --> 01:39:54,560
it's not you're like you shake up
 

6289
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:55,830
it's not you're like you shake up
something in it

6290
01:39:55,830 --> 01:39:55,840
something in it
 

6291
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:58,229
something in it
in the biology of the brain but you have

6292
01:39:58,229 --> 01:39:58,239
in the biology of the brain but you have
 

6293
01:39:58,239 --> 01:39:59,189
in the biology of the brain but you have
to do then

6294
01:39:59,189 --> 01:39:59,199
to do then
 

6295
01:39:59,199 --> 01:40:01,510
to do then
it's work absolutely now a friend of

6296
01:40:01,510 --> 01:40:01,520
it's work absolutely now a friend of
 

6297
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:02,629
it's work absolutely now a friend of
mine who's a

6298
01:40:02,629 --> 01:40:02,639
mine who's a
 

6299
01:40:02,639 --> 01:40:05,910
mine who's a
physician he says um who's quite open to

6300
01:40:05,910 --> 01:40:05,920
physician he says um who's quite open to
 

6301
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:08,070
physician he says um who's quite open to
this idea that psychedelics could play a

6302
01:40:08,070 --> 01:40:08,080
this idea that psychedelics could play a
 

6303
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:10,870
this idea that psychedelics could play a
real role in in real medicine says

6304
01:40:10,870 --> 01:40:10,880
real role in in real medicine says
 

6305
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:12,390
real role in in real medicine says
better living through chemistry still

6306
01:40:12,390 --> 01:40:12,400
better living through chemistry still
 

6307
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:14,310
better living through chemistry still
requires better living

6308
01:40:14,310 --> 01:40:14,320
requires better living
 

6309
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:15,990
requires better living
and and i think it's it's a beautiful

6310
01:40:15,990 --> 01:40:16,000
and and i think it's it's a beautiful
 

6311
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,590
and and i think it's it's a beautiful
statement i wish i had said it

6312
01:40:17,590 --> 01:40:17,600
statement i wish i had said it
 

6313
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:20,950
statement i wish i had said it
be um but he gets the credit but

6314
01:40:20,950 --> 01:40:20,960
be um but he gets the credit but
 

6315
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:22,950
be um but he gets the credit but
the plasticity window opens and then as

6316
01:40:22,950 --> 01:40:22,960
the plasticity window opens and then as
 

6317
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:24,390
the plasticity window opens and then as
you said what are you gonna do in the

6318
01:40:24,390 --> 01:40:24,400
you said what are you gonna do in the
 

6319
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:25,750
you said what are you gonna do in the
two weeks three weeks four weeks

6320
01:40:25,750 --> 01:40:25,760
two weeks three weeks four weeks
 

6321
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:27,189
two weeks three weeks four weeks
afterward because that's the real

6322
01:40:27,189 --> 01:40:27,199
afterward because that's the real
 

6323
01:40:27,199 --> 01:40:28,070
afterward because that's the real
opportunity

6324
01:40:28,070 --> 01:40:28,080
opportunity
 

6325
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:29,990
opportunity
but those psychedelic experiences are

6326
01:40:29,990 --> 01:40:30,000
but those psychedelic experiences are
 

6327
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,990
but those psychedelic experiences are
really a case of an amplified experience

6328
01:40:31,990 --> 01:40:32,000
really a case of an amplified experience
 

6329
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:33,590
really a case of an amplified experience
inside of an amplified experience so

6330
01:40:33,590 --> 01:40:33,600
inside of an amplified experience so
 

6331
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:34,950
inside of an amplified experience so
much so that

6332
01:40:34,950 --> 01:40:34,960
much so that
 

6333
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:38,390
much so that
everything seems relevant and it's um

6334
01:40:38,390 --> 01:40:38,400
everything seems relevant and it's um
 

6335
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:40,950
everything seems relevant and it's um
it's it's fascinating i mean i my hope

6336
01:40:40,950 --> 01:40:40,960
it's it's fascinating i mean i my hope
 

6337
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:41,830
it's it's fascinating i mean i my hope
is that

6338
01:40:41,830 --> 01:40:41,840
is that
 

6339
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:43,990
is that
the ai and machine learning and the

6340
01:40:43,990 --> 01:40:44,000
the ai and machine learning and the
 

6341
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,510
the ai and machine learning and the
brain machine interface and all that

6342
01:40:45,510 --> 01:40:45,520
brain machine interface and all that
 

6343
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:46,550
brain machine interface and all that
will eventually be

6344
01:40:46,550 --> 01:40:46,560
will eventually be
 

6345
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:49,510
will eventually be
merged with the psychedelic treatments

6346
01:40:49,510 --> 01:40:49,520
merged with the psychedelic treatments
 

6347
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:50,470
merged with the psychedelic treatments
so that you

6348
01:40:50,470 --> 01:40:50,480
so that you
 

6349
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:53,270
so that you
an individual can go in take whatever

6350
01:40:53,270 --> 01:40:53,280
an individual can go in take whatever
 

6351
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:54,870
an individual can go in take whatever
amount of whatever's safe for them

6352
01:40:54,870 --> 01:40:54,880
amount of whatever's safe for them
 

6353
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:55,990
amount of whatever's safe for them
working with a clinician

6354
01:40:55,990 --> 01:40:56,000
working with a clinician
 

6355
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:57,990
working with a clinician
and really direct the plasticity while

6356
01:40:57,990 --> 01:40:58,000
and really direct the plasticity while
 

6357
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:59,350
and really direct the plasticity while
maybe stimulating

6358
01:40:59,350 --> 01:40:59,360
maybe stimulating
 

6359
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:00,790
maybe stimulating
the orbital frontal medial orbital

6360
01:41:00,790 --> 01:41:00,800
the orbital frontal medial orbital
 

6361
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:02,629
the orbital frontal medial orbital
frontal cortex or increasing the

6362
01:41:02,629 --> 01:41:02,639
frontal cortex or increasing the
 

6363
01:41:02,639 --> 01:41:04,629
frontal cortex or increasing the
observer or decreasing the observer in

6364
01:41:04,629 --> 01:41:04,639
observer or decreasing the observer in
 

6365
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:05,350
observer or decreasing the observer in
the brain or

01:41:05,350 --> 01:41:05,360
the brain or
 

6367
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:07,350
the brain or
decreasing the amygdala i mean it's

6368
01:41:07,350 --> 01:41:07,360
decreasing the amygdala i mean it's
 

6369
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:09,189
decreasing the amygdala i mean it's
doable it's doable with

6370
01:41:09,189 --> 01:41:09,199
doable it's doable with
 

6371
01:41:09,199 --> 01:41:11,109
doable it's doable with
transcranial magnetic stimulation and

6372
01:41:11,109 --> 01:41:11,119
transcranial magnetic stimulation and
 

6373
01:41:11,119 --> 01:41:13,109
transcranial magnetic stimulation and
it's for shutting down activity and it's

6374
01:41:13,109 --> 01:41:13,119
it's for shutting down activity and it's
 

6375
01:41:13,119 --> 01:41:15,189
it's for shutting down activity and it's
doable with ultrasound ultrasound now

6376
01:41:15,189 --> 01:41:15,199
doable with ultrasound ultrasound now
 

6377
01:41:15,199 --> 01:41:16,709
doable with ultrasound ultrasound now
allows very focal

6378
01:41:16,709 --> 01:41:16,719
allows very focal
 

6379
01:41:16,719 --> 01:41:19,030
allows very focal
activation of particular brain regions

6380
01:41:19,030 --> 01:41:19,040
activation of particular brain regions
 

6381
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:19,830
activation of particular brain regions
through the skull

6382
01:41:19,830 --> 01:41:19,840
through the skull
 

6383
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:21,990
through the skull
non-invasively so it's approaching the

6384
01:41:21,990 --> 01:41:22,000
non-invasively so it's approaching the
 

6385
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,350
non-invasively so it's approaching the
same kind of uh

6386
01:41:23,350 --> 01:41:23,360
same kind of uh
 

6387
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:25,590
same kind of uh
therapy from different angles one ai is

6388
01:41:25,590 --> 01:41:25,600
therapy from different angles one ai is
 

6389
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:27,350
therapy from different angles one ai is
the computational side so

6390
01:41:27,350 --> 01:41:27,360
the computational side so
 

6391
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:30,790
the computational side so
injecting like the robotics injecting

6392
01:41:30,790 --> 01:41:30,800
injecting like the robotics injecting
 

6393
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:31,189
injecting like the robotics injecting
like

6394
01:41:31,189 --> 01:41:31,199
like
 

6395
01:41:31,199 --> 01:41:32,629
like
maybe you can even think about it as

6396
01:41:32,629 --> 01:41:32,639
maybe you can even think about it as
 

6397
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:35,669
maybe you can even think about it as
like electricity the electrical approach

6398
01:41:35,669 --> 01:41:35,679
like electricity the electrical approach
 

6399
01:41:35,679 --> 01:41:38,149
like electricity the electrical approach
versus then like the the chemical

6400
01:41:38,149 --> 01:41:38,159
versus then like the the chemical
 

6401
01:41:38,159 --> 01:41:39,750
versus then like the the chemical
approach absolutely and then the psycho

6402
01:41:39,750 --> 01:41:39,760
approach absolutely and then the psycho
 

6403
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:41,350
approach absolutely and then the psycho
and then the psychology is

6404
01:41:41,350 --> 01:41:41,360
and then the psychology is
 

6405
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:43,109
and then the psychology is
is subjective right so it's going to

6406
01:41:43,109 --> 01:41:43,119
is subjective right so it's going to
 

6407
01:41:43,119 --> 01:41:44,550
is subjective right so it's going to
take some real

6408
01:41:44,550 --> 01:41:44,560
take some real
 

6409
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:47,510
take some real
um understanding of what that person's

6410
01:41:47,510 --> 01:41:47,520
um understanding of what that person's
 

6411
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:48,390
um understanding of what that person's
um

6412

um
lexicon is like you know that wasn't a

01:41:50,709 --> 01:41:50,719
lexicon is like you know that wasn't a
 

6415
01:41:50,719 --> 01:41:52,550

i'm sorry it's terrible that's the one

6418
01:41:55,430 --> 01:41:55,440
i'm sorry it's terrible that's the one
 

6419
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:56,709
i'm sorry it's terrible that's the one
thing i know from the feedback on my

my jokes are terrible but i never
 

6425
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:01,109
my jokes are terrible but i never
claimed to be funny the

6426
01:42:01,109 --> 01:42:01,119
claimed to be funny the
 

6427
01:42:01,119 --> 01:42:03,750
claimed to be funny the
the uh but somebody who they really

6428

the uh but somebody who they really
 

6429
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:04,550
the uh but somebody who they really
trust

trust
 

6431
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:06,950
trust
and understands when somebody says you

for a very stoic person like i'm
 

6437
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:11,590
for a very stoic person like i'm
imagining you interviewed the great dan

something while on one of these drugs
and like

6450
01:42:18,790 --> 01:42:18,800
and like
 

6451
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:23,030
and like
i mean his languaging might if he says

6452
01:42:23,030 --> 01:42:23,040
i mean his languaging might if he says
 

6453
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:24,950
i mean his languaging might if he says
that was troubling it might mean that it

6454
01:42:24,950 --> 01:42:24,960
that was troubling it might mean that it
 

6455
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:26,629
that was troubling it might mean that it
was very troubling or not troubling at

6456
01:42:26,629 --> 01:42:26,639
was very troubling or not troubling at
 

6457

was very troubling or not troubling at
all

6458
01:42:27,270 --> 01:42:27,280
all
 

6459
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:30,310
all
so people are language is a poor

6460
01:42:30,310 --> 01:42:30,320
so people are language is a poor
 

6461
01:42:30,320 --> 01:42:32,790
so people are language is a poor
guide because if i say i'm upset how

6462
01:42:32,790 --> 01:42:32,800
guide because if i say i'm upset how
 

6463
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:34,470
guide because if i say i'm upset how
upset is that well that's very

6464
01:42:34,470 --> 01:42:34,480
upset is that well that's very
 

6465
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:35,189
upset is that well that's very
subjective

6466
01:42:35,189 --> 01:42:35,199
subjective
 

6467
01:42:35,199 --> 01:42:37,830
subjective
so you need we need can you build a tool

6468
01:42:37,830 --> 01:42:37,840
so you need we need can you build a tool
 

6469
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:39,430
so you need we need can you build a tool
for that can you build a ai tool for

6470
01:42:39,430 --> 01:42:39,440
for that can you build a ai tool for
 

6471
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:40,229
for that can you build a ai tool for
that yeah deeper

6472
01:42:40,229 --> 01:42:40,239
that yeah deeper
 

6473
01:42:40,239 --> 01:42:41,990
that yeah deeper
yeah maybe that's the eye maybe that's

6474
01:42:41,990 --> 01:42:42,000
yeah maybe that's the eye maybe that's
 

6475
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,790
yeah maybe that's the eye maybe that's
our that's what the eyes could reveal

6476
01:42:44,790 --> 01:42:44,800
our that's what the eyes could reveal
 

6477
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:46,470
our that's what the eyes could reveal
so language is not just words it's

6478
01:42:46,470 --> 01:42:46,480
so language is not just words it's
 

6479
01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:47,910
so language is not just words it's
everything together and that's

6480
01:42:47,910 --> 01:42:47,920
everything together and that's
 

6481
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:49,910
everything together and that's
one of the fascinating things about the

6482
01:42:49,910 --> 01:42:49,920
one of the fascinating things about the
 

6483
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:51,830
one of the fascinating things about the
eyes in the window to the soul i mean

6484
01:42:51,830 --> 01:42:51,840
eyes in the window to the soul i mean

eyes in the window to the soul i mean
they express so much the face the eyes

6486
01:42:54,229 --> 01:42:54,239
they express so much the face the eyes
 

6487
01:42:54,239 --> 01:42:55,430
they express so much the face the eyes

communication of emotions
 

6493
01:42:59,119 --> 01:43:02,229
communication of emotions
it's a super complex perhaps it's a bit

6494
01:43:02,229 --> 01:43:02,239
it's a super complex perhaps it's a bit
 

6495
01:43:02,239 --> 01:43:02,790
it's a super complex perhaps it's a bit
of a

6496
01:43:02,790 --> 01:43:02,800
of a

just a mystery in itself
 

6507
01:43:19,199 --> 01:43:21,030
just a mystery in itself
over its intensity what happens to the

is
as a kind of a freight train through

01:43:54,870 --> 01:43:54,880
as a kind of a freight train through
 

6539
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:55,990
as a kind of a freight train through
space and time

6540
01:43:55,990 --> 01:43:56,000
space and time
 

6541
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,189
space and time
very different than the way people

6542
01:43:57,189 --> 01:43:57,199
very different than the way people
 

6543
01:43:57,199 --> 01:43:58,950
very different than the way people
describe lsd type experiences or

6544
01:43:58,950 --> 01:43:58,960
describe lsd type experiences or
 

6545

describe lsd type experiences or
psilocybin where

6546
01:44:00,149 --> 01:44:00,159
psilocybin where
 

6547
01:44:00,159 --> 01:44:02,310
psilocybin where
time and space are very fluid but it

6548
01:44:02,310 --> 01:44:02,320
time and space are very fluid but it
 

6549
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:04,149
time and space are very fluid but it
tends to be a kind of a slower

6550
01:44:04,149 --> 01:44:04,159
tends to be a kind of a slower
 

6551
01:44:04,159 --> 01:44:07,510
tends to be a kind of a slower
role if you will um so it's clear that

6552
01:44:07,510 --> 01:44:07,520
role if you will um so it's clear that
 

6553

they do reveal a certain component about
 

6601
01:44:54,159 --> 01:44:55,830
they do reveal a certain component about
our underlying neurology

6602
01:44:55,830 --> 01:44:55,840
our underlying neurology
 

6603
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:59,430
our underlying neurology
i'm fascinated by the concept of

i'm fascinated by the concept of
 

6605
01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:00,950
i'm fascinated by the concept of
wordlessness

6606
01:45:00,950 --> 01:45:00,960
wordlessness
 

6607
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:04,149
wordlessness
activities in which language is just not

6608
01:45:04,149 --> 01:45:04,159
activities in which language is just not
 

6609
01:45:04,159 --> 01:45:06,070
activities in which language is just not
sufficient to capture

6610
01:45:06,070 --> 01:45:06,080
sufficient to capture
 

6611
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:09,830
sufficient to capture
and in which feel so vital as a reset as

6612
01:45:09,830 --> 01:45:09,840
and in which feel so vital as a reset as
 

6613
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:11,750
and in which feel so vital as a reset as
important as sleep you know i think

important as sleep you know i think

that's one of the dangers of the phone

6616
01:45:13,270 --> 01:45:13,280
that's one of the dangers of the phone
 

6617
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:14,390
that's one of the dangers of the phone
is not that you're going to get into

6618
01:45:14,390 --> 01:45:14,400
is not that you're going to get into
 

6619
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:15,910
is not that you're going to get into
some online battle or that you're always

6620
01:45:15,910 --> 01:45:15,920
some online battle or that you're always
 

6621
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:17,669
some online battle or that you're always
staring at the phone is that it's a word

6622
01:45:17,669 --> 01:45:17,679
staring at the phone is that it's a word
 

6623
01:45:17,679 --> 01:45:18,950
staring at the phone is that it's a word
so as we read things we're

6624
01:45:18,950 --> 01:45:18,960
so as we read things we're
 

6625
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:20,870
so as we read things we're
hearing the script in our head and i

6626
01:45:20,870 --> 01:45:20,880
hearing the script in our head and i
 

6627
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:22,229
hearing the script in our head and i
think getting into

6628
01:45:22,229 --> 01:45:22,239
think getting into
 

6629
01:45:22,239 --> 01:45:24,870
think getting into
states where we are in a state of

6630
01:45:24,870 --> 01:45:24,880
states where we are in a state of
 

6631
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:26,390
states where we are in a state of
wordlessness

6632
01:45:26,390 --> 01:45:26,400
wordlessness
 

6633
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:29,510
wordlessness
is is very renewing and replenishing and

6634
01:45:29,510 --> 01:45:29,520
is is very renewing and replenishing and
 

6635
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:30,070
is is very renewing and replenishing and
just

6636
01:45:30,070 --> 01:45:30,080
just
 

6637
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:33,030
just
can feel amazing for and i believe also

6638
01:45:33,030 --> 01:45:33,040
can feel amazing for and i believe also
 

6639
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:35,109
can feel amazing for and i believe also
can help us tap into

6640
01:45:35,109 --> 01:45:35,119
can help us tap into
 

6641
01:45:35,119 --> 01:45:36,950
can help us tap into
creative states and allow our neurology

6642
01:45:36,950 --> 01:45:36,960
creative states and allow our neurology
 

6643
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:38,629
creative states and allow our neurology
to access creative states

6644
01:45:38,629 --> 01:45:38,639
to access creative states
 

6645
01:45:38,639 --> 01:45:41,669
to access creative states
and sleep is one such wordlessness

6646
01:45:41,669 --> 01:45:41,679
and sleep is one such wordlessness
 

6647
01:45:41,679 --> 01:45:45,270
and sleep is one such wordlessness
period so one of the most interesting

6648
01:45:45,270 --> 01:45:45,280
period so one of the most interesting
 

6649
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:47,189
period so one of the most interesting
things to me are states that one can

6650
01:45:47,189 --> 01:45:47,199
things to me are states that one can
 

6651
01:45:47,199 --> 01:45:49,990
things to me are states that one can

in that moment
and that's beautiful and i think uh i

6692
01:46:25,350 --> 01:46:25,360
and that's beautiful and i think uh i
 

6693
01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:26,790
and that's beautiful and i think uh i
think it's not just beautiful because it

6694
01:46:26,790 --> 01:46:26,800
think it's not just beautiful because it
 

6695
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:27,590
think it's not just beautiful because it
feels good

i think it's beautiful because it's
 

6699
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:31,109
i think it's beautiful because it's
important and it's clearly fundamental

6700
01:46:31,109 --> 01:46:31,119
important and it's clearly fundamental
 

6701
01:46:31,119 --> 01:46:32,550
important and it's clearly fundamental
to our neurology

6702
01:46:32,550 --> 01:46:32,560
to our neurology
 

6703
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:34,950
to our neurology
and your sense is there's a connection

6704
01:46:34,950 --> 01:46:34,960
and your sense is there's a connection
 

6705
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:36,550
and your sense is there's a connection
between dreams and dmt and like

6706
01:46:36,550 --> 01:46:36,560
between dreams and dmt and like
 

6707
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:38,629
between dreams and dmt and like
psychedelic like all of the

6708
01:46:38,629 --> 01:46:38,639
psychedelic like all of the
 

6709
01:46:38,639 --> 01:46:41,750
psychedelic like all of the
uh you can you can understand one by

6710
01:46:41,750 --> 01:46:41,760
uh you can you can understand one by
 

6711
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:44,070
uh you can you can understand one by
studying the other so for example dreams

6712
01:46:44,070 --> 01:46:44,080
studying the other so for example dreams
 

6713
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:46,149
studying the other so for example dreams
are also very difficult to study right

6714
01:46:46,149 --> 01:46:46,159
are also very difficult to study right
 

6715
01:46:46,159 --> 01:46:47,109
are also very difficult to study right
but they're

6716
01:46:47,109 --> 01:46:47,119
but they're
 

6717
01:46:47,119 --> 01:46:49,830
but they're
more accessible it's safer to study and

6718
01:46:49,830 --> 01:46:49,840
more accessible it's safer to study and
 

6719
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:51,669
more accessible it's safer to study and
we're told we need to get more of it

6720
01:46:51,669 --> 01:46:51,679
we're told we need to get more of it
 

6721
01:46:51,679 --> 01:46:53,350
we're told we need to get more of it
whereas with psychedelics there's this

6722
01:46:53,350 --> 01:46:53,360
whereas with psychedelics there's this
 

6723
01:46:53,360 --> 01:46:54,790
whereas with psychedelics there's this
big question mark is it going to make

6724
01:46:54,790 --> 01:46:54,800
big question mark is it going to make
 

6725
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:56,229
big question mark is it going to make
everyone crazy

6726
01:46:56,229 --> 01:46:56,239
everyone crazy
 

6727
01:46:56,239 --> 01:46:58,470
everyone crazy
is it is it going to be legal i mean

6728
01:46:58,470 --> 01:46:58,480
is it is it going to be legal i mean
 

6729
01:46:58,480 --> 01:46:59,990
is it is it going to be legal i mean
it's kind of interesting how

6730
01:46:59,990 --> 01:47:00,000
it's kind of interesting how
 

6731
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,709
it's kind of interesting how
if one looks on instagram one could

6732
01:47:02,709 --> 01:47:02,719
if one looks on instagram one could
 

6733
01:47:02,719 --> 01:47:03,990
if one looks on instagram one could
almost think that these drugs are

6734
01:47:03,990 --> 01:47:04,000
almost think that these drugs are
 

6735
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,430
almost think that these drugs are
already legal based on the way that

6736
01:47:05,430 --> 01:47:05,440
already legal based on the way that
 

6737
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:06,709
already legal based on the way that
people commute but they're not yet

6738
01:47:06,709 --> 01:47:06,719
people commute but they're not yet
 

6739
01:47:06,719 --> 01:47:07,830
people commute but they're not yet
they're still a lot of them are

6740
01:47:07,830 --> 01:47:07,840
they're still a lot of them are
 

6741
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:09,350
they're still a lot of them are
scheduled there's a lot of questions

6742
01:47:09,350 --> 01:47:09,360
scheduled there's a lot of questions
 

6743
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:10,390
scheduled there's a lot of questions
yeah uh

6744
01:47:10,390 --> 01:47:10,400
yeah uh
 

6745
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:14,390
yeah uh
i mean and but nevertheless it's like

6746
01:47:14,390 --> 01:47:14,400
i mean and but nevertheless it's like
 

6747
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:17,830
i mean and but nevertheless it's like
uh my my hope is that uh science

6748
01:47:17,830 --> 01:47:17,840
uh my my hope is that uh science
 

6749
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:21,430
uh my my hope is that uh science
opens up to these uh drugs a little bit

6750
01:47:21,430 --> 01:47:21,440
opens up to these uh drugs a little bit
 

6751
01:47:21,440 --> 01:47:23,189
opens up to these uh drugs a little bit
more it's just i have this intuition

6752
01:47:23,189 --> 01:47:23,199
more it's just i have this intuition
 

6753
01:47:23,199 --> 01:47:24,390
more it's just i have this intuition
that

6754
01:47:24,390 --> 01:47:24,400
that
 

6755
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:26,390
that
like a lot of people share that they

6756
01:47:26,390 --> 01:47:26,400
like a lot of people share that they
 

6757
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:28,390
like a lot of people share that they
would be able to

6758
01:47:28,390 --> 01:47:28,400
would be able to
 

6759
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:31,109
would be able to
uh unlock a deeper understanding of our

6760
01:47:31,109 --> 01:47:31,119
uh unlock a deeper understanding of our
 

6761
01:47:31,119 --> 01:47:33,109
uh unlock a deeper understanding of our
own mind it's it's any kind of

6762
01:47:33,109 --> 01:47:33,119
own mind it's it's any kind of
 

6763
01:47:33,119 --> 01:47:35,669
own mind it's it's any kind of

01:47:43,270 --> 01:47:43,280
implementation of linearities i mean
 

6771
01:47:43,280 --> 01:47:43,590
implementation of linearities i mean
that's

6772
01:47:43,590 --> 01:47:43,600
that's
 

6773
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:45,830
that's
that's what is absolutely clear this is

about

as the study that they're working on
 

6797
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:06,310
as the study that they're working on
is as opposed to i think most of the

psychedelic studies
 

6801
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:10,629
psychedelic studies
they've done is on how to treat

and one of the things they're working on
 

6807
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:16,070
and one of the things they're working on
now is to try to do a study where

goodness if you take creatives and you
 

6823
01:48:28,159 --> 01:48:29,830
goodness if you take creatives and you
give them more psychedelics they're not

stuff
 

6861
01:49:05,440 --> 01:49:08,470
stuff
and studying that that's a i mean that's

6862
01:49:08,470 --> 01:49:08,480
and studying that that's a i mean that's
 

6863
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:11,750
and studying that that's a i mean that's
weird i usually the science

the scientific exploration there has
 

6867
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:14,790
the scientific exploration there has
been done in

been done in
 

6869
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:17,030
been done in
uh by the musicians themselves as has

it's
 

6877
01:49:22,159 --> 01:49:23,750
it's
but the people still have to know how to

life together because they can't
 

6951
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:27,510
life together because they can't
and they you know we look at people who

6952
01:50:27,510 --> 01:50:27,520
and they you know we look at people who
 

6953
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:29,430
and they you know we look at people who
are kind of pseudo aspergers or

6954
01:50:29,430 --> 01:50:29,440
are kind of pseudo aspergers or
 

6955
01:50:29,440 --> 01:50:31,270
are kind of pseudo aspergers or
aspergers or some forms of autism and

6956
01:50:31,270 --> 01:50:31,280
aspergers or some forms of autism and
 

6957
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:31,750
aspergers or some forms of autism and
they are

6958
01:50:31,750 --> 01:50:31,760
they are
 

6959
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:33,830
they are
so hyper linear but you take away those

6960
01:50:33,830 --> 01:50:33,840
so hyper linear but you take away those
 

6961
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:36,310
so hyper linear but you take away those
linearities and they freak out

6962
01:50:36,310 --> 01:50:36,320
linearities and they freak out
 

6963
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:37,750
linearities and they freak out
and that's kind of the essence of some

6964
01:50:37,750 --> 01:50:37,760
and that's kind of the essence of some
 

6965
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:40,550
and that's kind of the essence of some
of those syndromes so i think that

6966
01:50:40,550 --> 01:50:40,560
of those syndromes so i think that
 

6967
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:42,229
of those syndromes so i think that
the ability to toggle back and forth

6968
01:50:42,229 --> 01:50:42,239
the ability to toggle back and forth
 

6969
01:50:42,239 --> 01:50:43,510
the ability to toggle back and forth
between those states is what's

6970
01:50:43,510 --> 01:50:43,520
between those states is what's
 

6971
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:44,550
between those states is what's
remarkable i mean

6972
01:50:44,550 --> 01:50:44,560
remarkable i mean

interesting earlier we're talking about
 

7209
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:29,589
interesting earlier we're talking about
the challenge with david that you're

7210
01:54:29,589 --> 01:54:29,599
the challenge with david that you're
 

7211
01:54:29,599 --> 01:54:30,470
the challenge with david that you're
about to do

7212
01:54:30,470 --> 01:54:30,480
about to do
 

7213
01:54:30,480 --> 01:54:33,990
about to do
i mean that is a psychedelic experience

7214
01:54:33,990 --> 01:54:34,000
i mean that is a psychedelic experience
 

7215
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:35,750
i mean that is a psychedelic experience
of sorts because you're biasing your

7216
01:54:35,750 --> 01:54:35,760
of sorts because you're biasing your
 

7217
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:36,070
of sorts because you're biasing your
mind

7218
01:54:36,070 --> 01:54:36,080

towards a pretty extreme neurochemical

7220
01:54:37,910 --> 01:54:37,920
towards a pretty extreme neurochemical
 

7221
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:39,669
towards a pretty extreme neurochemical
state and you don't know what you're

7222
01:54:39,669 --> 01:54:39,679
state and you don't know what you're
 

7223
01:54:39,679 --> 01:54:40,550
state and you don't know what you're
going to find there

7224
01:54:40,550 --> 01:54:40,560
going to find there
 

7225
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:42,070
going to find there
and that's kind of the excitement at

7226
01:54:42,070 --> 01:54:42,080
and that's kind of the excitement at
 

7227
01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:44,070
and that's kind of the excitement at
least for me as an observer it's like i

7228
01:54:44,070 --> 01:54:44,080
least for me as an observer it's like i
 

7229
01:54:44,080 --> 01:54:45,350
least for me as an observer it's like i
want to know

7230
01:54:45,350 --> 01:54:45,360
want to know
 

7231
01:54:45,360 --> 01:54:48,870
want to know
what what the experience is like

7232
01:54:48,870 --> 01:54:48,880
what what the experience is like
 

7233
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:50,950
what what the experience is like
afterward i want to know like how was it

7234
01:54:50,950 --> 01:54:50,960
afterward i want to know like how was it
 

7235
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:52,229
afterward i want to know like how was it
i mean i'm sure you're going to get

7236
01:54:52,229 --> 01:54:52,239
i mean i'm sure you're going to get
 

7237
01:54:52,239 --> 01:54:53,430
i mean i'm sure you're going to get
something like you said you're going to

7238
01:54:53,430 --> 01:54:53,440
something like you said you're going to
 

7239
01:54:53,440 --> 01:54:55,109
something like you said you're going to
grow the question is how and not

7240
01:54:55,109 --> 01:54:55,119
grow the question is how and not
 

7241
01:54:55,119 --> 01:54:56,629
grow the question is how and not
resisting i mean it's the same as with a

7242
01:54:56,629 --> 01:54:56,639
resisting i mean it's the same as with a
 

7243
01:54:56,639 --> 01:54:58,229
resisting i mean it's the same as with a
psychedelic experience it's like

7244
01:54:58,229 --> 01:54:58,239
psychedelic experience it's like
 

7245
01:54:58,239 --> 01:55:01,350
psychedelic experience it's like
not like giving yourself over completely

7246
01:55:01,350 --> 01:55:01,360
not like giving yourself over completely
 

7247
01:55:01,360 --> 01:55:02,470
not like giving yourself over completely
to the experience and

7248
01:55:02,470 --> 01:55:02,480
to the experience and
 

7249
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:03,830
to the experience and
not resisting and going through the

7250
01:55:03,830 --> 01:55:03,840
not resisting and going through the
 

7251
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:06,310
not resisting and going through the
whole mental journey of whether it's

7252
01:55:06,310 --> 01:55:06,320
whole mental journey of whether it's
 

7253
01:55:06,320 --> 01:55:08,709
whole mental journey of whether it's
anger or excitement or exhaustion the

7254
01:55:08,709 --> 01:55:08,719
anger or excitement or exhaustion the
 

7255
01:55:08,719 --> 01:55:09,750
anger or excitement or exhaustion the
whole thing

7256
01:55:09,750 --> 01:55:09,760
whole thing
 

7257
01:55:09,760 --> 01:55:13,109
whole thing
it's uh i mean uh

7258
01:55:13,109 --> 01:55:13,119
it's uh i mean uh
 

7259
01:55:13,119 --> 01:55:16,470
it's uh i mean uh
that's in the entirety of the process

7260
01:55:16,470 --> 01:55:16,480
that's in the entirety of the process
 

7261
01:55:16,480 --> 01:55:18,550
that's in the entirety of the process
that david goes through when he does his

7262
01:55:18,550 --> 01:55:18,560
that david goes through when he does his
 

7263
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:18,950
that david goes through when he does his

01:55:20,950 --> 01:55:20,960
challenges and so on is that whole
 

7267
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:22,070
challenges and so on is that whole
journey he finds

7268
01:55:22,070 --> 01:55:22,080
journey he finds
 

7269
01:55:22,080 --> 01:55:25,350
journey he finds
purposely like missile seeks

7270
01:55:25,350 --> 01:55:25,360
purposely like missile seeks
 

7271
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:28,870
purposely like missile seeks
the limits of the mind that whenever

7272
01:55:28,870 --> 01:55:28,880
the limits of the mind that whenever
 

7273
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:31,430
the limits of the mind that whenever
the resistance is felt runs up against

7274
01:55:31,430 --> 01:55:31,440
the resistance is felt runs up against
 

7275
01:55:31,440 --> 01:55:33,430
the resistance is felt runs up against
it and then goes to the full journey of

7276
01:55:33,430 --> 01:55:33,440
it and then goes to the full journey of
 

7277
01:55:33,440 --> 01:55:35,589
it and then goes to the full journey of
going beyond it and seeing what's there

7278
01:55:35,589 --> 01:55:35,599
going beyond it and seeing what's there
 

7279
01:55:35,599 --> 01:55:36,470
going beyond it and seeing what's there
on the other side

7280
01:55:36,470 --> 01:55:36,480
on the other side
 

7281
01:55:36,480 --> 01:55:38,070
on the other side
well stress has these two sides the

7282
01:55:38,070 --> 01:55:38,080
well stress has these two sides the
 

7283
01:55:38,080 --> 01:55:39,589
well stress has these two sides the
limbic friction of being

7284
01:55:39,589 --> 01:55:39,599
limbic friction of being
 

7285
01:55:39,599 --> 01:55:41,589
limbic friction of being
tired and needing to get more energized

7286
01:55:41,589 --> 01:55:41,599
tired and needing to get more energized
 

7287
01:55:41,599 --> 01:55:43,430
tired and needing to get more energized
that's one form of stress

7288
01:55:43,430 --> 01:55:43,440
that's one form of stress
 

7289
01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:45,350
that's one form of stress
and then there's the feeling too amped

7290
01:55:45,350 --> 01:55:45,360
and then there's the feeling too amped
 

7291
01:55:45,360 --> 01:55:46,790
and then there's the feeling too amped
up and needing to calm down

7292
01:55:46,790 --> 01:55:46,800
up and needing to calm down
 

7293
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:48,470
up and needing to calm down
the the typical discussion around

01:55:48,470 --> 01:55:48,480
the the typical discussion around
 

7295
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:49,990
the the typical discussion around
stresses is one thing

stresses is one thing
 

7297
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:51,990
stresses is one thing
but it's all limbic friction it's just

7298
01:55:51,990 --> 01:55:52,000
but it's all limbic friction it's just
 

7299
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:53,430
but it's all limbic friction it's just
that when i say lymbic friction

7300
01:55:53,430 --> 01:55:53,440
that when i say lymbic friction
 

7301
01:55:53,440 --> 01:55:54,950
that when i say lymbic friction
that's not a real scientific term i just

7302
01:55:54,950 --> 01:55:54,960
that's not a real scientific term i just
 

7303
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:56,629
that's not a real scientific term i just

you uh this month on the podcast you're
 

7331
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:23,669
you uh this month on the podcast you're
talking about neuroplasticity you

7332
01:56:23,669 --> 01:56:23,679
talking about neuroplasticity you
 

7333
01:56:23,679 --> 01:56:25,109
talking about neuroplasticity you
mentioned a bunch already

7334
01:56:25,109 --> 01:56:25,119
mentioned a bunch already
 

7335
01:56:25,119 --> 01:56:27,270
mentioned a bunch already
is there something you're looking

7336
01:56:27,270 --> 01:56:27,280
is there something you're looking
 

7337
01:56:27,280 --> 01:56:28,149
is there something you're looking
forward to

7338
01:56:28,149 --> 01:56:28,159
forward to
 

7339
01:56:28,159 --> 01:56:30,470
forward to
specifically like something maybe you're

7340
01:56:30,470 --> 01:56:30,480
specifically like something maybe you're
 

7341
01:56:30,480 --> 01:56:31,430
specifically like something maybe you're
fascinated

7342
01:56:31,430 --> 01:56:31,440
fascinated
 

7343
01:56:31,440 --> 01:56:33,430
fascinated
by that jumps to mind about

7344
01:56:33,430 --> 01:56:33,440
by that jumps to mind about
 

7345
01:56:33,440 --> 01:56:34,550
by that jumps to mind about
neuroplasticity

7346
01:56:34,550 --> 01:56:34,560
neuroplasticity
 

7347
01:56:34,560 --> 01:56:37,430
neuroplasticity
this fascinating property of the brain

7348
01:56:37,430 --> 01:56:37,440
this fascinating property of the brain
 

7349
01:56:37,440 --> 01:56:38,950
this fascinating property of the brain
yeah i think that

7350
01:56:38,950 --> 01:56:38,960
yeah i think that
 

7351
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:40,629
yeah i think that
it's clear there's one facet of

7352
01:56:40,629 --> 01:56:40,639
it's clear there's one facet of
 

7353
01:56:40,639 --> 01:56:42,070
it's clear there's one facet of
neuroplasticity that

7354
01:56:42,070 --> 01:56:42,080
neuroplasticity that
 

7355
01:56:42,080 --> 01:56:44,870
neuroplasticity that
is very well supported by the research

7356
01:56:44,870 --> 01:56:44,880
is very well supported by the research
 

7357
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:45,270
is very well supported by the research
data

7358
01:56:45,270 --> 01:56:45,280
data
 

7359
01:56:45,280 --> 01:56:47,910
data
that hardly anyone has implemented in

the real world
 

7363
01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:50,550
the real world
and that's the release of acetylcholine

7364
01:56:50,550 --> 01:56:50,560
and that's the release of acetylcholine
 

7365
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:52,070
and that's the release of acetylcholine
from these neurons in the forebrain

7366

and if we don't do this i don't think

reach out of all the machine learning
 

7505
01:59:01,920 --> 01:59:03,030
reach out of all the machine learning
tools either

because everyone talks about these huge

7508
01:59:04,790 --> 01:59:04,800
because everyone talks about these huge
 

7509
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:07,189
because everyone talks about these huge
data sets and but those huge data sets

7510
01:59:07,189 --> 01:59:07,199
data sets and but those huge data sets
 

7511
01:59:07,199 --> 01:59:09,510

funnel into human interpretation i mean

funnel into human interpretation i mean
 

7513
01:59:09,520 --> 01:59:11,030

we don't just like stare at the numbers

7514

we don't just like stare at the numbers
 

7515
01:59:11,040 --> 01:59:12,310
we don't just like stare at the numbers
and bask right

7516
01:59:12,310 --> 01:59:12,320
and bask right
 

7517
01:59:12,320 --> 01:59:15,669

so some the human brain i think needs to

7518
01:59:15,669 --> 01:59:15,679
so some the human brain i think needs to
 

7519
01:59:15,679 --> 01:59:17,669
so some the human brain i think needs to
leverage these plasticity mechanisms to

7520
01:59:17,669 --> 01:59:17,679
leverage these plasticity mechanisms to
 

7521
01:59:17,679 --> 01:59:19,430
leverage these plasticity mechanisms to
keep up with the thing that's happening

7522
01:59:19,430 --> 01:59:19,440
keep up with the thing that's happening
 

7523
01:59:19,440 --> 01:59:20,950
keep up with the thing that's happening
very very fast which is technology

7524
01:59:20,950 --> 01:59:20,960

7527
01:59:21,599 --> 01:59:23,990

so that's a long-winded way of saying

7528
01:59:23,990 --> 01:59:24,000
so that's a long-winded way of saying
 

7529
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,070
so that's a long-winded way of saying

it allows for plasticine adulthood and
 

7535
01:59:29,119 --> 01:59:30,149
it allows for plasticine adulthood and
allows for it in

7536
01:59:30,149 --> 01:59:30,159
allows for it in
 

7537
01:59:30,159 --> 01:59:31,830
allows for it in
single trial learning which is

01:59:31,830 --> 01:59:31,840
single trial learning which is
 

7539
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:33,189

incredible
 

7541
01:59:33,199 --> 01:59:36,229
incredible
but how do we leverage that like in the

7542
01:59:36,229 --> 01:59:36,239
but how do we leverage that like in the
 

7543
01:59:36,239 --> 01:59:38,310
but how do we leverage that like in the

02:00:00,639 --> 02:00:01,830
that increases nicotinic transmission i

to do this but that's where it's going
 

7615
02:00:45,679 --> 02:00:47,430
to do this but that's where it's going

but it's very dispersed is there a lot
 

7699
02:02:16,080 --> 02:02:17,910
but it's very dispersed is there a lot
of different data sets like

7700
02:02:17,910 --> 02:02:17,920
of different data sets like
 

7701
02:02:17,920 --> 02:02:19,589
of different data sets like
in your work that you've just come

7702
02:02:19,589 --> 02:02:19,599
in your work that you've just come
 

7703
02:02:19,599 --> 02:02:21,830
in your work that you've just come
across is a huge

well there's a lot of cell sequencing

7710
02:02:27,750 --> 02:02:27,760
well there's a lot of cell sequencing
 

7711
02:02:27,760 --> 02:02:30,070
well there's a lot of cell sequencing
stuff so the broad over it you know

7712
02:02:30,070 --> 02:02:30,080
stuff so the broad over it you know
 

7713
02:02:30,080 --> 02:02:32,629
stuff so the broad over it you know
on in boston and then on this coast the

7892
02:05:18,229 --> 02:05:18,239
or you go work for a company and
 

7893
02:05:18,239 --> 02:05:19,990
or you go work for a company and
actually build stuff that's useful

7894
02:05:19,990 --> 02:05:20,000
actually build stuff that's useful
 

7895
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:21,430
actually build stuff that's useful
i think neuroscientists and people

7896
02:05:21,430 --> 02:05:21,440
i think neuroscientists and people
 

7897
02:05:21,440 --> 02:05:22,790
i think neuroscientists and people
interested in neuroscience are starting

7898
02:05:22,790 --> 02:05:22,800
interested in neuroscience are starting
 

7899
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:23,669
interested in neuroscience are starting
to think

7900
02:05:23,669 --> 02:05:23,679
to think
 

7901
02:05:23,679 --> 02:05:25,589
to think
how can i build stuff that's useful and

7902
02:05:25,589 --> 02:05:25,599
how can i build stuff that's useful and
 

7903
02:05:25,599 --> 02:05:27,750
how can i build stuff that's useful and

there's the neuroscientist there's a
 

7933
02:05:53,040 --> 02:05:55,109
there's the neuroscientist there's a
neurobiology way of studying the eye

7934
02:05:55,109 --> 02:05:55,119
neurobiology way of studying the eye
 

7935
02:05:55,119 --> 02:05:56,629
neurobiology way of studying the eye
and there's the computer vision way of

7936
02:05:56,629 --> 02:05:56,639
and there's the computer vision way of
 

7937
02:05:56,639 --> 02:05:58,790
and there's the computer vision way of
studying the eye and the computer vision

studying the eye and the computer vision
 

7939
02:05:58,800 --> 02:06:00,310
studying the eye and the computer vision
way of studying the eye of just like

7940
02:06:00,310 --> 02:06:00,320
way of studying the eye of just like
 

7941
02:06:00,320 --> 02:06:02,950
way of studying the eye of just like
observing non-contact sensing of humans

7942

observing non-contact sensing of humans
 

7943
02:06:02,960 --> 02:06:04,870
observing non-contact sensing of humans
is really fascinating to me in studying

02:06:04,870 --> 02:06:04,880
is really fascinating to me in studying
 

7945
02:06:04,880 --> 02:06:06,629
is really fascinating to me in studying
human behavior in different contexts

like
 

7949
02:06:07,280 --> 02:06:10,069
like
in semi-autonomous vehicles it seemed

7950
02:06:10,069 --> 02:06:10,079
in semi-autonomous vehicles it seemed
 

7951
02:06:10,079 --> 02:06:12,069
in semi-autonomous vehicles it seemed
like there is a lot of signal that comes

7952
02:06:12,069 --> 02:06:12,079
like there is a lot of signal that comes
 

7953
02:06:12,079 --> 02:06:15,109
like there is a lot of signal that comes
from the eye that comes from blinking

i did the
 

8005
02:07:09,119 --> 02:07:11,109
i did the
really like rigorous processing of it

8006
02:07:11,109 --> 02:07:11,119
really like rigorous processing of it
 

8007
02:07:11,119 --> 02:07:12,629
really like rigorous processing of it
which is like

8008
02:07:12,629 --> 02:07:12,639
which is like
 

8009
02:07:12,639 --> 02:07:15,910
which is like
the i extracted all of the faces i did

8010
02:07:15,910 --> 02:07:15,920
the i extracted all of the faces i did
 

8011
02:07:15,920 --> 02:07:16,870
the i extracted all of the faces i did
the really good

8012
02:07:16,870 --> 02:07:16,880
the really good
 

8013
02:07:16,880 --> 02:07:18,950
the really good
blink track of the pupil tracking and

8014
02:07:18,950 --> 02:07:18,960
blink track of the pupil tracking and
 

8015
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:19,910
blink track of the pupil tracking and
the blink

8016
02:07:19,910 --> 02:07:19,920
the blink
 

8017
02:07:19,920 --> 02:07:22,790
the blink
detection for the entirety that are oh i

8018
02:07:22,790 --> 02:07:22,800
detection for the entirety that are oh i
 

8019
02:07:22,800 --> 02:07:23,589
detection for the entirety that are oh i
should say it's

8020
02:07:23,589 --> 02:07:23,599
should say it's
 

8021
02:07:23,599 --> 02:07:26,709
should say it's
from episode like i forget what it is

8022
02:07:26,709 --> 02:07:26,719
from episode like i forget what it is
 

8023
02:07:26,719 --> 02:07:28,629
from episode like i forget what it is
but it's like episode 900 when

8024
02:07:28,629 --> 02:07:28,639
but it's like episode 900 when
 

8025
02:07:28,639 --> 02:07:31,669
but it's like episode 900 when
they switched to 1080p video but it was

8026
02:07:31,669 --> 02:07:31,679
they switched to 1080p video but it was
 

8027
02:07:31,679 --> 02:07:33,430
they switched to 1080p video but it was
like much crappier videos so

8028
02:07:33,430 --> 02:07:33,440
like much crappier videos so
 

8029
02:07:33,440 --> 02:07:35,109
like much crappier videos so
it's still kind of long when there was

8030
02:07:35,109 --> 02:07:35,119
it's still kind of long when there was
 

8031
02:07:35,119 --> 02:07:37,189
it's still kind of long when there was
marijuana consumption or when they were

8032
02:07:37,189 --> 02:07:37,199
marijuana consumption or when they were
 

8033
02:07:37,199 --> 02:07:37,990
marijuana consumption or when they were
drinking

8034
02:07:37,990 --> 02:07:38,000
drinking
 

8035
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:41,109
drinking
when they're i mean there's like

8036
02:07:41,109 --> 02:07:41,119
when they're i mean there's like
 

8037
02:07:41,119 --> 02:07:43,030
when they're i mean there's like
just it won't throw off the data but

8038
02:07:43,030 --> 02:07:43,040
just it won't throw off the data but
 

8039
02:07:43,040 --> 02:07:44,149
just it won't throw off the data but
it's relevant to the

8040
02:07:44,149 --> 02:07:44,159
it's relevant to the
 

8041
02:07:44,159 --> 02:07:47,430
it's relevant to the
the relatively competitive data

8042
02:07:47,430 --> 02:07:47,440
the relatively competitive data
 

8043
02:07:47,440 --> 02:07:50,470
the relatively competitive data
so let's just put it uh this way there's

8044
02:07:50,470 --> 02:07:50,480
so let's just put it uh this way there's
 

8045
02:07:50,480 --> 02:07:52,069
so let's just put it uh this way there's
a lot of fascinating computer vision

8046
02:07:52,069 --> 02:07:52,079
a lot of fascinating computer vision
 

8047
02:07:52,079 --> 02:07:53,589
a lot of fascinating computer vision
problems involved but

8048
02:07:53,589 --> 02:07:53,599
problems involved but
 

8049
02:07:53,599 --> 02:07:57,030
problems involved but
i only kept long sequences of data

8050
02:07:57,030 --> 02:07:57,040
i only kept long sequences of data
 

8051
02:07:57,040 --> 02:07:59,109
i only kept long sequences of data

there seemed to be quite a lot of signal
 

8133
02:09:21,040 --> 02:09:23,270
there seemed to be quite a lot of signal
there that indicates

there that indicates

02:09:23,280 --> 02:09:26,229
there that indicates
amount of cognitive load but it's not

8136

but if there is some signal that's a
 

8141
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:32,790
but if there is some signal that's a
really powerful one because eye movement

pick that up really easily

pick that up really easily
 

8221
02:10:40,719 --> 02:10:42,790
pick that up really easily
at much lower levels than the the

blinking well blink frequency is gonna

blinking well blink frequency is gonna
 

8241
02:11:00,079 --> 02:11:00,950
blinking well blink frequency is gonna
increase

actually been teased a lot online

8246
02:11:06,149 --> 02:11:06,159
actually been teased a lot online
 

8247
02:11:06,159 --> 02:11:07,669

because i don't blink much when i'll do

8248
02:11:07,669 --> 02:11:07,679
because i don't blink much when i'll do
 

8249
02:11:07,679 --> 02:11:08,550
because i don't blink much when i'll do
a post

8250
02:11:08,550 --> 02:11:08,560
a post
 

8251
02:11:08,560 --> 02:11:10,390
a post
and i and so i did a whole post about

8252
02:11:10,390 --> 02:11:10,400
and i and so i did a whole post about
 

8253
02:11:10,400 --> 02:11:11,830
and i and so i did a whole post about
blinking about the science of blinking

8254
02:11:11,830 --> 02:11:11,840
blinking about the science of blinking
 

8255
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:12,310
blinking about the science of blinking
there's some

8256
02:11:12,310 --> 02:11:12,320
there's some
 

8257
02:11:12,320 --> 02:11:14,709
there's some
data very strong data not from my lab

8258
02:11:14,709 --> 02:11:14,719
data very strong data not from my lab
 

8259
02:11:14,719 --> 02:11:15,750
data very strong data not from my lab
that showed that

8260
02:11:15,750 --> 02:11:15,760
that showed that
 

8261
02:11:15,760 --> 02:11:17,350
that showed that
every time you blink it resets your

8262
02:11:17,350 --> 02:11:17,360
every time you blink it resets your
 

8263
02:11:17,360 --> 02:11:18,870
every time you blink it resets your
perception of time they have people

8264
02:11:18,870 --> 02:11:18,880
perception of time they have people
 

8265
02:11:18,880 --> 02:11:21,430
perception of time they have people
do these kind of track uh kind of a

8266
02:11:21,430 --> 02:11:21,440
do these kind of track uh kind of a
 

8267
02:11:21,440 --> 02:11:22,950
do these kind of track uh kind of a
doppler like thing and

8268
02:11:22,950 --> 02:11:22,960
doppler like thing and
 

8269
02:11:22,960 --> 02:11:24,709
doppler like thing and
anyway blinking resets your perception

8270
02:11:24,709 --> 02:11:24,719
anyway blinking resets your perception
 

8271
02:11:24,719 --> 02:11:26,149
anyway blinking resets your perception
of time and there's a dopaminergic

8272
02:11:26,149 --> 02:11:26,159
of time and there's a dopaminergic
 

8273
02:11:26,159 --> 02:11:27,350
of time and there's a dopaminergic
mechanism in a

mechanism in a
 

8275
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:28,950

when people are very alert they tend to

when people are very alert they tend to
 

8281
02:11:31,599 --> 02:11:33,030
when people are very alert they tend to
not blink very much when we're sleepy we

not blink very much when we're sleepy we
 

8283
02:11:33,040 --> 02:11:34,390
not blink very much when we're sleepy we
tend to blink more and our eyes

sit some people are like this all the
 

8291
02:11:40,079 --> 02:11:41,589
sit some people are like this all the
time there are some very famous people

i'm not going to name them because i

might run into them at some point who

8296
02:11:44,870 --> 02:11:44,880
might run into them at some point who
 

8297
02:11:44,880 --> 02:11:46,870
might run into them at some point who
are like accused of being sociopaths

8298
02:11:46,870 --> 02:11:46,880
are like accused of being sociopaths
 

8299
02:11:46,880 --> 02:11:48,550
are like accused of being sociopaths
because they don't blink very often

8300
02:11:48,550 --> 02:11:48,560
because they don't blink very often
 

8301
02:11:48,560 --> 02:11:49,910
because they don't blink very often
but they might just have high levels of

02:11:49,910 --> 02:11:49,920
but they might just have high levels of
 

8303
02:11:49,920 --> 02:11:51,750
but they might just have high levels of

02:11:51,750 --> 02:11:51,760
autonomic arousal they just don't blink
 

8305
02:11:51,760 --> 02:11:52,310

very much

8306
02:11:52,310 --> 02:11:52,320
very much

02:11:52,320 --> 02:11:54,470
very much
yeah also depends on how lubricated the

8317
02:12:01,840 --> 02:12:03,750
this person's blinking a lot they're
lying this person or they're tired this

they're they're stressed i think if you

8322
02:12:08,470 --> 02:12:08,480
they're they're stressed i think if you
 

8323
02:12:08,480 --> 02:12:10,390
they're they're stressed i think if you
understand that person's baseline you

8324
02:12:10,390 --> 02:12:10,400
understand that person's baseline you
 

8325
02:12:10,400 --> 02:12:12,229
understand that person's baseline you
can get it and presumably

8326
02:12:12,229 --> 02:12:12,239
can get it and presumably
 

8327
02:12:12,239 --> 02:12:13,830
can get it and presumably

time being sitting down there i mean joe

8342
02:12:24,229 --> 02:12:24,239
time being sitting down there i mean joe
 

8343
02:12:24,239 --> 02:12:24,709
time being sitting down there i mean joe
was

8344
02:12:24,709 --> 02:12:24,719
was
 

8345
02:12:24,719 --> 02:12:26,390
was
incredibly gracious made me feel very

8346
02:12:26,390 --> 02:12:26,400
incredibly gracious made me feel very
 

8347
02:12:26,400 --> 02:12:28,310
incredibly gracious made me feel very
comfortable there but yeah it's a

8348
02:12:28,310 --> 02:12:28,320
comfortable there but yeah it's a
 

8349
02:12:28,320 --> 02:12:30,229
comfortable there but yeah it's a
it's an intense experience um it's a

8350
02:12:30,229 --> 02:12:30,239
it's an intense experience um it's a
 

8351
02:12:30,239 --> 02:12:32,069
it's an intense experience um it's a
small space too anytime you enter a

8352
02:12:32,069 --> 02:12:32,079
small space too anytime you enter a
 

8353
02:12:32,079 --> 02:12:33,669
small space too anytime you enter a
small space from a big space

8354
02:12:33,669 --> 02:12:33,679
small space from a big space
 

8355
02:12:33,679 --> 02:12:37,910
small space from a big space
in this old studio you're familiar with

8356
02:12:37,910 --> 02:12:37,920
in this old studio you're familiar with
 

8357
02:12:37,920 --> 02:12:39,189
in this old studio you're familiar with
there's a breaking in period where

8358
02:12:39,189 --> 02:12:39,199
there's a breaking in period where
 

8359
02:12:39,199 --> 02:12:41,109
there's a breaking in period where
you're getting to know somebody and so

8360
02:12:41,109 --> 02:12:41,119
you're getting to know somebody and so
 

8361
02:12:41,119 --> 02:12:43,510
you're getting to know somebody and so
i'm sure my levels of autonomic arousal

8362
02:12:43,510 --> 02:12:43,520
i'm sure my levels of autonomic arousal
 

8363
02:12:43,520 --> 02:12:45,270
i'm sure my levels of autonomic arousal
front of the podcast were higher than

8364
02:12:45,270 --> 02:12:45,280
front of the podcast were higher than
 

8365
02:12:45,280 --> 02:12:47,669
front of the podcast were higher than
later so but once you have a baseline

8366
02:12:47,669 --> 02:12:47,679
later so but once you have a baseline
 

8367
02:12:47,679 --> 02:12:50,069
later so but once you have a baseline
established you can get a lot of data on

8368
02:12:50,069 --> 02:12:50,079
established you can get a lot of data on
 

8369
02:12:50,079 --> 02:12:50,790
established you can get a lot of data on
somebody

8370
02:12:50,790 --> 02:12:50,800
somebody
 

8371
02:12:50,800 --> 02:12:53,109
somebody
simply from blinks um some people

8372
02:12:53,109 --> 02:12:53,119
simply from blinks um some people
 

8373
02:12:53,119 --> 02:12:54,629
simply from blinks um some people
averting gays too

8374
02:12:54,629 --> 02:12:54,639
averting gays too
 

8375
02:12:54,639 --> 02:12:56,310
averting gays too
if you have both people that's really

8376
02:12:56,310 --> 02:12:56,320
if you have both people that's really
 

8377
02:12:56,320 --> 02:12:57,990
if you have both people that's really
powerful this is the holy grail

8378
02:12:57,990 --> 02:12:58,000
powerful this is the holy grail
 

8379
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,229
powerful this is the holy grail
another holy grail of neuroscience we've

8380
02:13:00,229 --> 02:13:00,239
another holy grail of neuroscience we've
 

8381
02:13:00,239 --> 02:13:01,510
another holy grail of neuroscience we've
mainly looked at subjects

8382
02:13:01,510 --> 02:13:01,520
mainly looked at subjects
 

8383
02:13:01,520 --> 02:13:03,430
mainly looked at subjects
in isolation absolutely there hasn't

8384
02:13:03,430 --> 02:13:03,440
in isolation absolutely there hasn't
 

8385
02:13:03,440 --> 02:13:05,910
in isolation absolutely there hasn't
been much brain imaging of two people in

8386
02:13:05,910 --> 02:13:05,920
been much brain imaging of two people in
 

8387
02:13:05,920 --> 02:13:08,470
been much brain imaging of two people in
interacting or even in animal models of

8388
02:13:08,470 --> 02:13:08,480
interacting or even in animal models of
 

8389
02:13:08,480 --> 02:13:10,550
interacting or even in animal models of
two mice or two monkeys interacting it's

8390
02:13:10,550 --> 02:13:10,560
two mice or two monkeys interacting it's
 

8391
02:13:10,560 --> 02:13:11,109
two mice or two monkeys interacting it's
all like

8392
02:13:11,109 --> 02:13:11,119
all like
 

8393
02:13:11,119 --> 02:13:13,589
all like
a person scanner bite bar i mean if

8394
02:13:13,589 --> 02:13:13,599
a person scanner bite bar i mean if
 

8395
02:13:13,599 --> 02:13:14,390
a person scanner bite bar i mean if
you've ever been in one of these

8396
02:13:14,390 --> 02:13:14,400
you've ever been in one of these
 

8397
02:13:14,400 --> 02:13:16,069
you've ever been in one of these
scanners like in a bite bar

8398
02:13:16,069 --> 02:13:16,079
scanners like in a bite bar
 

8399
02:13:16,079 --> 02:13:18,550
scanners like in a bite bar
it's very medieval and so you think in

8400
02:13:18,550 --> 02:13:18,560
it's very medieval and so you think in
 

8401
02:13:18,560 --> 02:13:20,709
it's very medieval and so you think in
the interaction there's actually

8402
02:13:20,709 --> 02:13:20,719
the interaction there's actually
 

8403
02:13:20,719 --> 02:13:22,629
the interaction there's actually
you can almost study them as a single

8404
02:13:22,629 --> 02:13:22,639
you can almost study them as a single
 

8405
02:13:22,639 --> 02:13:24,790
you can almost study them as a single
brain or as a single system the two

8406
02:13:24,790 --> 02:13:24,800
brain or as a single system the two
 

8407
02:13:24,800 --> 02:13:26,149
brain or as a single system the two
brains are a single system

8408
02:13:26,149 --> 02:13:26,159
brains are a single system
 

8409
02:13:26,159 --> 02:13:28,069
brains are a single system
i think with ai highly correlated yeah

8410
02:13:28,069 --> 02:13:28,079
i think with ai highly correlated yeah
 

8411
02:13:28,079 --> 02:13:29,589
i think with ai highly correlated yeah
maybe are your blinks triggering my

8412
02:13:29,589 --> 02:13:29,599
maybe are your blinks triggering my
 

8413
02:13:29,599 --> 02:13:30,310
maybe are your blinks triggering my
blinks like

8414
02:13:30,310 --> 02:13:30,320
blinks like
 

8415
02:13:30,320 --> 02:13:32,709
blinks like
you know or your non-blink epochs you

8416
02:13:32,709 --> 02:13:32,719
you know or your non-blink epochs you
 

8417
02:13:32,719 --> 02:13:35,109
you know or your non-blink epochs you
know extending my non-blink epochs

8418
02:13:35,109 --> 02:13:35,119
know extending my non-blink epochs
 

8419
02:13:35,119 --> 02:13:37,430
know extending my non-blink epochs
there's a fascinating space to explore

8420
02:13:37,430 --> 02:13:37,440
there's a fascinating space to explore
 

8421
02:13:37,440 --> 02:13:39,910
there's a fascinating space to explore
there and no one's done it

8422
02:13:39,910 --> 02:13:39,920
there and no one's done it

get the comments too because i think the

8430
02:13:47,669 --> 02:13:47,679
get the comments too because i think the
 

8431
02:13:47,679 --> 02:13:48,629
get the comments too because i think the
comments were

8432
02:13:48,629 --> 02:13:48,639
comments were
 

8433
02:13:48,639 --> 02:13:49,830
comments were
almost as entertaining as the

me realize with the couplings i have a

8438
02:13:53,430 --> 02:13:53,440
me realize with the couplings i have a
 

8439
02:13:53,440 --> 02:13:54,950
me realize with the couplings i have a
better data set than the joe rogan

so for example both cameras right now

8446
02:14:01,910 --> 02:14:01,920
so for example both cameras right now
 

8447
02:14:01,920 --> 02:14:03,350
so for example both cameras right now
are recording you and i

8448
02:14:03,350 --> 02:14:03,360
are recording you and i
 

8449
02:14:03,360 --> 02:14:06,310
are recording you and i
full full feed the final result will

8450
02:14:06,310 --> 02:14:06,320
full full feed the final result will
 

8451
02:14:06,320 --> 02:14:08,069
full full feed the final result will
switch cameras back and forth but i have

8452
02:14:08,069 --> 02:14:08,079
switch cameras back and forth but i have
 

8453
02:14:08,079 --> 02:14:08,950
switch cameras back and forth but i have
the full feed

8454

the full feed
 

8455
02:14:08,960 --> 02:14:11,109
the full feed
right so i can have the blinking for

8456
02:14:11,109 --> 02:14:11,119
right so i can have the blinking for
 

8457
02:14:11,119 --> 02:14:12,550
right so i can have the blinking for
both you and i the whole time

8458
02:14:12,550 --> 02:14:12,560
both you and i the whole time
 

8459
02:14:12,560 --> 02:14:15,109
both you and i the whole time
i bet you people trigger blanks and in

8460
02:14:15,109 --> 02:14:15,119
i bet you people trigger blanks and in
 

8461
02:14:15,119 --> 02:14:16,310
i bet you people trigger blanks and in
one another

8462

one another
 

8463
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:18,629
one another
you know and there's also like the the

8464
02:14:18,629 --> 02:14:18,639
you know and there's also like the the
 

8465
02:14:18,639 --> 02:14:20,229
you know and there's also like the the
simplest way to think about the blinks

8466
02:14:20,229 --> 02:14:20,239
simplest way to think about the blinks
 

8467
02:14:20,239 --> 02:14:21,910
simplest way to think about the blinks
and the attentional thing and the

8468
02:14:21,910 --> 02:14:21,920
and the attentional thing and the
 

8469
02:14:21,920 --> 02:14:24,390
and the attentional thing and the
alertness is two fighters in the in the

8470
02:14:24,390 --> 02:14:24,400
alertness is two fighters in the in the
 

8471
02:14:24,400 --> 02:14:25,350
alertness is two fighters in the in the

standoff
 

8473
02:14:25,360 --> 02:14:26,870

there's this whole lore around who

8474
02:14:26,870 --> 02:14:26,880
there's this whole lore around who
 

8475
02:14:26,880 --> 02:14:28,709
there's this whole lore around who
blinks first yeah it's like they blink

8476
02:14:28,709 --> 02:14:28,719
blinks first yeah it's like they blink
 

8477
02:14:28,719 --> 02:14:29,430
blinks first yeah it's like they blink
first well

8478
02:14:29,430 --> 02:14:29,440
first well
 

8479
02:14:29,440 --> 02:14:30,629
first well
what are what are we really asking

8480
02:14:30,629 --> 02:14:30,639
what are what are we really asking
 

8481
02:14:30,639 --> 02:14:32,470
what are what are we really asking
they're asking whether or not one person

8482
02:14:32,470 --> 02:14:32,480
they're asking whether or not one person
 

8483
02:14:32,480 --> 02:14:33,430
they're asking whether or not one person
can maintain

8484
02:14:33,430 --> 02:14:33,440
can maintain
 

8485
02:14:33,440 --> 02:14:36,629
can maintain
focus longer than the other person

8486
02:14:36,629 --> 02:14:36,639
focus longer than the other person
 

8487
02:14:36,639 --> 02:14:39,510
focus longer than the other person
which is an important parameter it's not

8488
02:14:39,510 --> 02:14:39,520
which is an important parameter it's not
 

8489
02:14:39,520 --> 02:14:40,950
which is an important parameter it's not
the only parameter but

8490
02:14:40,950 --> 02:14:40,960
the only parameter but
 

8491
02:14:40,960 --> 02:14:43,030
the only parameter but
it's an important parameter and so that

8492
02:14:43,030 --> 02:14:43,040
it's an important parameter and so that
 

8493
02:14:43,040 --> 02:14:44,550
it's an important parameter and so that
blinking contest even though they don't

8494
02:14:44,550 --> 02:14:44,560
blinking contest even though they don't
 

8495
02:14:44,560 --> 02:14:46,629
blinking contest even though they don't
square off as a blinking contest

8496
02:14:46,629 --> 02:14:46,639
square off as a blinking contest
 

8497
02:14:46,639 --> 02:14:48,870
square off as a blinking contest
it's well known that the first to blink

8498
02:14:48,870 --> 02:14:48,880
it's well known that the first to blink
 

8499
02:14:48,880 --> 02:14:49,750
it's well known that the first to blink
is revealing

8500
02:14:49,750 --> 02:14:49,760
is revealing
 

8501
02:14:49,760 --> 02:14:51,750
is revealing
something about their capacity to hold

8502
02:14:51,750 --> 02:14:51,760
something about their capacity to hold
 

8503
02:14:51,760 --> 02:14:53,510
something about their capacity to hold

it's basically you it embodies
 

8517
02:15:08,880 --> 02:15:11,109
it's basically you it embodies
the personality of andrew huberman which

8518
02:15:11,109 --> 02:15:11,119
the personality of andrew huberman which
 

8519
02:15:11,119 --> 02:15:12,470
the personality of andrew huberman which
is like

8520
02:15:12,470 --> 02:15:12,480
is like
 

8521
02:15:12,480 --> 02:15:15,830
is like
makes science accessible um

8522
02:15:15,830 --> 02:15:15,840
makes science accessible um
 

8523
02:15:15,840 --> 02:15:19,750
makes science accessible um
but also uh fascinating

8524
02:15:19,750 --> 02:15:19,760
but also uh fascinating
 

8525
02:15:19,760 --> 02:15:23,430
but also uh fascinating
and giving it like what do you call it

8526

and giving it like what do you call it
 

8527
02:15:23,440 --> 02:15:27,270
and giving it like what do you call it
you give tools for everyday life meaning

8528
02:15:27,270 --> 02:15:27,280
you give tools for everyday life meaning
 

8529
02:15:27,280 --> 02:15:29,830
you give tools for everyday life meaning
it kind of grounds in like what the hell

8530
02:15:29,830 --> 02:15:29,840
it kind of grounds in like what the hell
 

8531
02:15:29,840 --> 02:15:31,990
it kind of grounds in like what the hell
does this mean for my life

when i decided to do the podcast the
huberman lab podcast i thought really

8612
02:16:56,870 --> 02:16:56,880
huberman lab podcast i thought really
 

8613
02:16:56,880 --> 02:16:58,070
huberman lab podcast i thought really
long and hard about what

8614
02:16:58,070 --> 02:16:58,080
long and hard about what
 

8615
02:16:58,080 --> 02:16:59,349
long and hard about what
would work best and would be most

8616
02:16:59,349 --> 02:16:59,359
would work best and would be most
 

8617
02:16:59,359 --> 02:17:01,270
would work best and would be most
beneficial turned out to be the hardest

8618
02:17:01,270 --> 02:17:01,280
beneficial turned out to be the hardest
 

8619
02:17:01,280 --> 02:17:02,070
beneficial turned out to be the hardest
thing

8620
02:17:02,070 --> 02:17:02,080
thing
 

8621
02:17:02,080 --> 02:17:04,870
thing
which is to stay on a single topic for

8622
02:17:04,870 --> 02:17:04,880
which is to stay on a single topic for
 

8623
02:17:04,880 --> 02:17:06,709
which is to stay on a single topic for
three or four or more episodes before

8624
02:17:06,709 --> 02:17:06,719
three or four or more episodes before
 

8625
02:17:06,719 --> 02:17:08,549
three or four or more episodes before
switching to a new topic

8626
02:17:08,549 --> 02:17:08,559
switching to a new topic
 

8627
02:17:08,559 --> 02:17:12,150
switching to a new topic
because i know from the experience of

8628
02:17:12,150 --> 02:17:12,160
because i know from the experience of
 

8629
02:17:12,160 --> 02:17:15,030
because i know from the experience of
university and teaching in university as

8630
02:17:15,030 --> 02:17:15,040
university and teaching in university as
 

8631
02:17:15,040 --> 02:17:15,750
university and teaching in university as
you know

8632
02:17:15,750 --> 02:17:15,760
you know
 

8633
02:17:15,760 --> 02:17:18,709
you know
as well that there's always the

8634
02:17:18,709 --> 02:17:18,719
as well that there's always the
 

8635
02:17:18,719 --> 02:17:20,629
as well that there's always the
temptation to pivot to something else

8636
02:17:20,629 --> 02:17:20,639
temptation to pivot to something else
 

8637
02:17:20,639 --> 02:17:22,950
temptation to pivot to something else
but the drilling into something really

8638
02:17:22,950 --> 02:17:22,960
but the drilling into something really
 

8639
02:17:22,960 --> 02:17:24,150
but the drilling into something really
deeply is where the

8640
02:17:24,150 --> 02:17:24,160
deeply is where the
 

8641
02:17:24,160 --> 02:17:26,950
deeply is where the
where the gems reside and the the

8642
02:17:26,950 --> 02:17:26,960
where the gems reside and the the
 

8643
02:17:26,960 --> 02:17:28,309
where the gems reside and the the
challenge has been

8644
02:17:28,309 --> 02:17:28,319
challenge has been
 

8645
02:17:28,319 --> 02:17:29,910
challenge has been
how to make it interesting how to keep

8646
02:17:29,910 --> 02:17:29,920
how to make it interesting how to keep
 

8647
02:17:29,920 --> 02:17:32,389
how to make it interesting how to keep
people on board how to give people tools

8648
02:17:32,389 --> 02:17:32,399
people on board how to give people tools
 

8649
02:17:32,399 --> 02:17:34,309
people on board how to give people tools
along the way

8650
02:17:34,309 --> 02:17:34,319
along the way
 

8651
02:17:34,319 --> 02:17:36,230
along the way
but also stay close to the scientific

8652
02:17:36,230 --> 02:17:36,240
but also stay close to the scientific
 

8653
02:17:36,240 --> 02:17:37,509
but also stay close to the scientific
data um

8654
02:17:37,509 --> 02:17:37,519
data um
 

8655
02:17:37,519 --> 02:17:38,950
data um
i like to think that we're headed in the

8656
02:17:38,950 --> 02:17:38,960
i like to think that we're headed in the
 

8657
02:17:38,960 --> 02:17:41,030
i like to think that we're headed in the
right direction it still needs to evolve

8658
02:17:41,030 --> 02:17:41,040
right direction it still needs to evolve
 

8659
02:17:41,040 --> 02:17:44,070
right direction it still needs to evolve
but that's been a challenge

8660
02:17:44,070 --> 02:17:44,080
but that's been a challenge
 

8661
02:17:44,080 --> 02:17:47,589
but that's been a challenge
i think i also am challenged by the fact

8662
02:17:47,589 --> 02:17:47,599
i think i also am challenged by the fact
 

8663
02:17:47,599 --> 02:17:49,190
i think i also am challenged by the fact
that there's a tremendous range of

8664
02:17:49,190 --> 02:17:49,200
that there's a tremendous range of
 

8665
02:17:49,200 --> 02:17:50,629
that there's a tremendous range of
backgrounds of listeners

8666
02:17:50,629 --> 02:17:50,639
backgrounds of listeners
 

8667
02:17:50,639 --> 02:17:53,429
backgrounds of listeners
so some people have asked for more names

8668
02:17:53,429 --> 02:17:53,439
so some people have asked for more names
 

8669
02:17:53,439 --> 02:17:53,750
so some people have asked for more names
like

8670
02:17:53,750 --> 02:17:53,760
like
 

8671
02:17:53,760 --> 02:17:55,190
like
more bits and parts of the nervous

8672
02:17:55,190 --> 02:17:55,200
more bits and parts of the nervous
 

8673
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:57,429
more bits and parts of the nervous
system and cellular molecular mechanisms

8674
02:17:57,429 --> 02:17:57,439
system and cellular molecular mechanisms
 

8675
02:17:57,439 --> 02:17:58,469
system and cellular molecular mechanisms
and all that kind of thing

8676
02:17:58,469 --> 02:17:58,479
and all that kind of thing
 

8677
02:17:58,479 --> 02:17:59,990
and all that kind of thing
and other people said i don't understand

8678
02:17:59,990 --> 02:18:00,000
and other people said i don't understand
 

8679
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:01,509
and other people said i don't understand
any of that stuff but i think i'm

8680
02:18:01,509 --> 02:18:01,519
any of that stuff but i think i'm
 

8681
02:18:01,519 --> 02:18:02,629
any of that stuff but i think i'm
keeping up and so

8682
02:18:02,629 --> 02:18:02,639
keeping up and so
 

8683
02:18:02,639 --> 02:18:04,230
keeping up and so
unlike a university course where there

8684
02:18:04,230 --> 02:18:04,240
unlike a university course where there
 

8685
02:18:04,240 --> 02:18:06,070
unlike a university course where there
are prerequisites and everyone's coming

8686
02:18:06,070 --> 02:18:06,080
are prerequisites and everyone's coming
 

8687
02:18:06,080 --> 02:18:07,429
are prerequisites and everyone's coming
to the table with more or less the same

to the table with more or less the same

knowledge
 

8691

knowledge
i have a very limited sense of what the

02:18:10,070 --> 02:18:10,080
i have a very limited sense of what the
 

8693

some people along the way but hopefully

8740
02:18:54,150 --> 02:18:54,160
some people along the way but hopefully
 

8741
02:18:54,160 --> 02:18:56,629
some people along the way but hopefully
at the end of each month and because of

at the end of each month and because of
the way that the

8744
02:18:57,429 --> 02:18:57,439
the way that the
 

8745
02:18:57,439 --> 02:18:59,429
the way that the

away feeling
as if they've learned a ton and they

8750
02:19:01,990 --> 02:19:02,000
as if they've learned a ton and they
 

8751
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:03,589
as if they've learned a ton and they
have tools that they can implement

8752
02:19:03,589 --> 02:19:03,599
have tools that they can implement
 

8753
02:19:03,599 --> 02:19:04,950
have tools that they can implement
and perhaps most importantly that

8754
02:19:04,950 --> 02:19:04,960
and perhaps most importantly that
 

8755
02:19:04,960 --> 02:19:07,589
and perhaps most importantly that
they're starting to think scientifically

8756
02:19:07,589 --> 02:19:07,599
they're starting to think scientifically
 

8757
02:19:07,599 --> 02:19:09,509
they're starting to think scientifically
about the tons of other stuff that's out

8758
02:19:09,509 --> 02:19:09,519
about the tons of other stuff that's out
 

8759
02:19:09,519 --> 02:19:10,629
about the tons of other stuff that's out
there

8760
02:19:10,629 --> 02:19:10,639
there
 

8761
02:19:10,639 --> 02:19:12,629
there
so that's been the challenge and it's

8762
02:19:12,629 --> 02:19:12,639
so that's been the challenge and it's
 

8763

02:19:18,549 --> 02:19:18,559
intentional challenge i realize that
 

8769
02:19:18,559 --> 02:19:19,349
intentional challenge i realize that

quite as much of track of time it's
still an intellectual effort and i think

8964

still an intellectual effort and i think
 

8965
02:22:41,040 --> 02:22:42,150
still an intellectual effort and i think
it might always be

8966
02:22:42,150 --> 02:22:42,160
it might always be
 

8967
02:22:42,160 --> 02:22:43,750
it might always be
as it would be with you because you're

really good scientific discussion is
 

8993
02:23:04,800 --> 02:23:05,590

you have to be maintaining three or four

8996
02:23:07,910 --> 02:23:07,920
you have to be maintaining three or four
 

8997

it's occasionally getting to like a real

9002
02:23:12,230 --> 02:23:12,240
it's occasionally getting to like a real
 

9003
02:23:12,240 --> 02:23:13,750
it's occasionally getting to like a real
streak of linearity

02:23:13,750 --> 02:23:13,760
streak of linearity
 

9005
02:23:13,760 --> 02:23:16,710
streak of linearity
but as we found today that typically

9006
02:23:16,710 --> 02:23:16,720
but as we found today that typically
 

9007
02:23:16,720 --> 02:23:17,750
but as we found today that typically
there's three or four different things

9008
02:23:17,750 --> 02:23:17,760
there's three or four different things
 

9009
02:23:17,760 --> 02:23:19,030
there's three or four different things
that we're bouncing back and forth

9010
02:23:19,030 --> 02:23:19,040
that we're bouncing back and forth
 

9011
02:23:19,040 --> 02:23:21,030
that we're bouncing back and forth
and that requires a lot of updating of

9012
02:23:21,030 --> 02:23:21,040
and that requires a lot of updating of

02:23:21,040 --> 02:23:23,110
and that requires a lot of updating of
these you know forebrain circuits it's

9014
02:23:23,110 --> 02:23:23,120
these you know forebrain circuits it's
 

9015
02:23:23,120 --> 02:23:23,429
these you know forebrain circuits it's
not

9016
02:23:23,429 --> 02:23:23,439
not
 

9017
02:23:23,439 --> 02:23:25,750
not
it's not a passive listening experience

9018
02:23:25,750 --> 02:23:25,760
it's not a passive listening experience
 

9019
02:23:25,760 --> 02:23:27,990
it's not a passive listening experience
but i like to think that the brain likes

9020

but i like to think that the brain likes
 

9021
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:28,630
but i like to think that the brain likes
that

9022
02:23:28,630 --> 02:23:28,640

a bank of lectures i have some sources
 

9073
02:24:26,399 --> 02:24:28,870
a bank of lectures i have some sources
of recorded university seminars

9074
02:24:28,870 --> 02:24:28,880
of recorded university seminars
 

9075
02:24:28,880 --> 02:24:30,950
of recorded university seminars
i'm trying to find the the points of

9076
02:24:30,950 --> 02:24:30,960
i'm trying to find the the points of
 

9077
02:24:30,960 --> 02:24:33,030
i'm trying to find the the points of
intersection so like for four episodes

9078
02:24:33,030 --> 02:24:33,040
intersection so like for four episodes
 

9079
02:24:33,040 --> 02:24:34,469

find the overlap
 

9089
02:24:41,200 --> 02:24:44,469
find the overlap
in the different elements i also so what

9090
02:24:44,469 --> 02:24:44,479
in the different elements i also so what
 

9091
02:24:44,479 --> 02:24:45,030
in the different elements i also so what
i'll do is

9092
02:24:45,030 --> 02:24:45,040
i'll do is
 

9093

i'll chase a few references i'll listen

9104
02:24:57,110 --> 02:24:57,120
i'll chase a few references i'll listen
 

9105
02:24:57,120 --> 02:24:58,950
i'll chase a few references i'll listen
to some youtube videos but of university

9106
02:24:58,950 --> 02:24:58,960
to some youtube videos but of university

level lectures
 

9109
02:25:00,399 --> 02:25:02,550
level lectures
and then i throw all that on a

9110
02:25:02,550 --> 02:25:02,560
and then i throw all that on a
 

9111
02:25:02,560 --> 02:25:04,550
and then i throw all that on a
whiteboard usually while i work out in

9112
02:25:04,550 --> 02:25:04,560
whiteboard usually while i work out in
 

9113
02:25:04,560 --> 02:25:05,590
whiteboard usually while i work out in
the morning

9114
02:25:05,590 --> 02:25:05,600
the morning
 

9115
02:25:05,600 --> 02:25:07,270
the morning
i'll just be working out i have a gym in

9116
02:25:07,270 --> 02:25:07,280
i'll just be working out i have a gym in
 

9117
02:25:07,280 --> 02:25:09,190
i'll just be working out i have a gym in
my house and i'll just put up

9118
02:25:09,190 --> 02:25:09,200
my house and i'll just put up
 

9119
02:25:09,200 --> 02:25:10,630
my house and i'll just put up
all these random ideas i want to cover

9120
02:25:10,630 --> 02:25:10,640
all these random ideas i want to cover
 

9121
02:25:10,640 --> 02:25:12,230
all these random ideas i want to cover
that dreams hallucination

9122
02:25:12,230 --> 02:25:12,240
that dreams hallucination
 

9123
02:25:12,240 --> 02:25:13,910
that dreams hallucination
and then i take that and i start

9124
02:25:13,910 --> 02:25:13,920
and then i take that and i start
 

9125
02:25:13,920 --> 02:25:15,590
and then i take that and i start
eliminating i draw lines between the

9126
02:25:15,590 --> 02:25:15,600
eliminating i draw lines between the
 

9127
02:25:15,600 --> 02:25:17,270
eliminating i draw lines between the
common points of intersection

9128
02:25:17,270 --> 02:25:17,280
common points of intersection
 

9129
02:25:17,280 --> 02:25:20,070
common points of intersection
and then from that i i distill out an

9130
02:25:20,070 --> 02:25:20,080
and then from that i i distill out an
 

9131
02:25:20,080 --> 02:25:21,190
and then from that i i distill out an
outline

9132
02:25:21,190 --> 02:25:21,200
outline
 

9133
02:25:21,200 --> 02:25:24,230
outline
and then i basically think about what i

9134
02:25:24,230 --> 02:25:24,240
and then i basically think about what i
 

9135
02:25:24,240 --> 02:25:24,870
and then i basically think about what i
want to say

9136
02:25:24,870 --> 02:25:24,880
want to say
 

9137
02:25:24,880 --> 02:25:27,910
want to say
on my walks with my dog and i bother a

9138
02:25:27,910 --> 02:25:27,920
on my walks with my dog and i bother a
 

9139
02:25:27,920 --> 02:25:29,349
on my walks with my dog and i bother a
couple people and blabbed to them so i

9140
02:25:29,349 --> 02:25:29,359
couple people and blabbed to them so i
 

9141
02:25:29,359 --> 02:25:30,469
couple people and blabbed to them so i
would say each podcast

9142
02:25:30,469 --> 02:25:30,479
would say each podcast
 

9143
02:25:30,479 --> 02:25:33,590
would say each podcast
yeah i put in 10 to 15 hours at least of

9144
02:25:33,590 --> 02:25:33,600
yeah i put in 10 to 15 hours at least of
 

9145
02:25:33,600 --> 02:25:36,150
yeah i put in 10 to 15 hours at least of
passive listening preparation and maybe

9146
02:25:36,150 --> 02:25:36,160
passive listening preparation and maybe
 

9147
02:25:36,160 --> 02:25:37,030
passive listening preparation and maybe
five or six of

9148
02:25:37,030 --> 02:25:37,040
five or six of
 

9149
02:25:37,040 --> 02:25:39,910
five or six of
active preparation so i do prepare quite

9150
02:25:39,910 --> 02:25:39,920
active preparation so i do prepare quite
 

9151
02:25:39,920 --> 02:25:40,710
active preparation so i do prepare quite
a lot

9152
02:25:40,710 --> 02:25:40,720
a lot
 

9153
02:25:40,720 --> 02:25:43,190
a lot
but it has a certain reward component

9154
02:25:43,190 --> 02:25:43,200
but it has a certain reward component
 

9155
02:25:43,200 --> 02:25:43,750
but it has a certain reward component
for me

9156
02:25:43,750 --> 02:25:43,760
for me
 

9157
02:25:43,760 --> 02:25:45,990
for me
i to come up at the end with something

9158
02:25:45,990 --> 02:25:46,000
i to come up at the end with something
 

9159
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:47,990
i to come up at the end with something
that's somewhat crystallized

9160
02:25:47,990 --> 02:25:48,000
that's somewhat crystallized
 

9161
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,790
that's somewhat crystallized
for me is just so satisfying it feels

9162
02:25:50,790 --> 02:25:50,800
for me is just so satisfying it feels
 

9163
02:25:50,800 --> 02:25:52,309
for me is just so satisfying it feels
like there's something about my dopamine

9164
02:25:52,309 --> 02:25:52,319
like there's something about my dopamine
 

9165
02:25:52,319 --> 02:25:54,389
like there's something about my dopamine
circuits that just love that

9166
02:25:54,389 --> 02:25:54,399
circuits that just love that
 

9167
02:25:54,399 --> 02:25:57,590
circuits that just love that
and uh the the only pain is that a year

9168
02:25:57,590 --> 02:25:57,600
and uh the the only pain is that a year
 

9169
02:25:57,600 --> 02:25:59,190
and uh the the only pain is that a year
later after i've talked about the stuff

9170
02:25:59,190 --> 02:25:59,200
later after i've talked about the stuff
 

9171
02:25:59,200 --> 02:26:00,870
later after i've talked about the stuff
a bunch of times it's so much more

9172
02:26:00,870 --> 02:26:00,880
a bunch of times it's so much more
 

9173
02:26:00,880 --> 02:26:02,550

sometimes there's some gems there but

9290
02:28:05,750 --> 02:28:05,760
sometimes there's some gems there but
 

9291
02:28:05,760 --> 02:28:08,790
sometimes there's some gems there but
generally it goes you know and yeah i

9292
02:28:08,790 --> 02:28:08,800
generally it goes you know and yeah i
 

9293

think you really have to know a field
 

9295
02:28:11,280 --> 02:28:12,950
think you really have to know a field
in order to extract the best things from

9296
02:28:12,950 --> 02:28:12,960
in order to extract the best things from
 

9297
02:28:12,960 --> 02:28:15,429
in order to extract the best things from
that field and my hope is that other

9298
02:28:15,429 --> 02:28:15,439
that field and my hope is that other
 

9299
02:28:15,439 --> 02:28:17,270
that field and my hope is that other

one thing that comes to mind is

9528
02:32:01,830 --> 02:32:01,840
one thing that comes to mind is
 

9529
02:32:01,840 --> 02:32:03,349
one thing that comes to mind is
when like in clubhouse you have your

9530
02:32:03,349 --> 02:32:03,359
when like in clubhouse you have your
 

9531
02:32:03,359 --> 02:32:05,030
when like in clubhouse you have your
little icon so they don't actually you

9532
02:32:05,030 --> 02:32:05,040
little icon so they don't actually you
 

9533
02:32:05,040 --> 02:32:06,230
little icon so they don't actually you
don't see your face moving

i think when people see their own image

9536
02:32:08,710 --> 02:32:08,720
i think when people see their own image
 

9537
02:32:08,720 --> 02:32:10,349
i think when people see their own image
it puts them in a state of

9538
02:32:10,349 --> 02:32:10,359
it puts them in a state of
 

9539
02:32:10,359 --> 02:32:11,910
it puts them in a state of
self-consciousness that

9540
02:32:11,910 --> 02:32:11,920
self-consciousness that
 

9541
02:32:11,920 --> 02:32:14,070
self-consciousness that
is eliminated by just having an icon or

9542
02:32:14,070 --> 02:32:14,080
is eliminated by just having an icon or
 

9543
02:32:14,080 --> 02:32:15,270
is eliminated by just having an icon or
an avatar yes

9544
02:32:15,270 --> 02:32:15,280
an avatar yes

chang would be an interesting person to
 

9577
02:32:43,840 --> 02:32:44,950
chang would be an interesting person to
talk to about this because he

9578
02:32:44,950 --> 02:32:44,960
talk to about this because he
 

9579
02:32:44,960 --> 02:32:46,870
talk to about this because he
understands so much about how inflection

9580
02:32:46,870 --> 02:32:46,880
understands so much about how inflection
 

9581
02:32:46,880 --> 02:32:48,150
understands so much about how inflection
communicates

9582
02:32:48,150 --> 02:32:48,160
communicates
 

9583
02:32:48,160 --> 02:32:50,309
communicates
emotionality and deeper state but

9584
02:32:50,309 --> 02:32:50,319
emotionality and deeper state but
 

9585
02:32:50,319 --> 02:32:52,150
emotionality and deeper state but
there's a balance between

9586
02:32:52,150 --> 02:32:52,160
there's a balance between
 

9587
02:32:52,160 --> 02:32:53,750
there's a balance between
i think just like you said this the

9588
02:32:53,750 --> 02:32:53,760
i think just like you said this the
 

9589
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:55,349
i think just like you said this the
privacy

9590
02:32:55,349 --> 02:32:55,359
privacy
 

9591
02:32:55,359 --> 02:32:59,110
privacy
uh somehow uh allows for the intimacy so

9592
02:32:59,110 --> 02:32:59,120
uh somehow uh allows for the intimacy so
 

9593
02:32:59,120 --> 02:33:00,630
uh somehow uh allows for the intimacy so
like being able to

9594
02:33:00,630 --> 02:33:00,640
like being able to
 

9595
02:33:00,640 --> 02:33:02,710
like being able to
uh as opposed to put on putting on an

9596
02:33:02,710 --> 02:33:02,720
uh as opposed to put on putting on an
 

9597
02:33:02,720 --> 02:33:04,790
uh as opposed to put on putting on an
act which i realize we do when we're

9598
02:33:04,790 --> 02:33:04,800
act which i realize we do when we're
 

9599
02:33:04,800 --> 02:33:06,150
act which i realize we do when we're
visually presenting ourselves

9600
02:33:06,150 --> 02:33:06,160
visually presenting ourselves
 

9601
02:33:06,160 --> 02:33:08,389
visually presenting ourselves
right in remote communication but i

9602
02:33:08,389 --> 02:33:08,399
right in remote communication but i
 

9603
02:33:08,399 --> 02:33:10,070
right in remote communication but i
think that there's so few places where

9604
02:33:10,070 --> 02:33:10,080
think that there's so few places where
 

9605
02:33:10,080 --> 02:33:10,790
think that there's so few places where
people can

9606
02:33:10,790 --> 02:33:10,800
people can
 

9607
02:33:10,800 --> 02:33:13,510
people can
actually communicate without the fear of

9608
02:33:13,510 --> 02:33:13,520
actually communicate without the fear of
 

9609
02:33:13,520 --> 02:33:14,150
actually communicate without the fear of
penalty

9610
02:33:14,150 --> 02:33:14,160
penalty
 

9611
02:33:14,160 --> 02:33:18,150

absent these days and so maybe people
 

9615
02:33:19,920 --> 02:33:21,830
absent these days and so maybe people

10259
02:43:47,520 --> 02:43:49,990
before 9 a.m than most people do in in
a decade it's clear and that what he

02:43:49,990 --> 02:43:50,000
a decade it's clear and that what he
 

10261
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:50,710
a decade it's clear and that what he

about the brain working hard equates to

02:44:00,389 --> 02:44:00,399
about the brain working hard equates to
 

10269
02:44:00,399 --> 02:44:02,150
about the brain working hard equates to
thinking about duration path and outcome

10270
02:44:02,150 --> 02:44:02,160
thinking about duration path and outcome
 

10271
02:44:02,160 --> 02:44:04,469
thinking about duration path and outcome
and anticipating outcomes given a b

10272
02:44:04,469 --> 02:44:04,479
and anticipating outcomes given a b

02:44:08,160 --> 02:44:10,950
thinking
and prediction and that is hard it's

10278
02:44:10,950 --> 02:44:10,960
and prediction and that is hard it's
 

10279
02:44:10,960 --> 02:44:12,790
and prediction and that is hard it's
stressful it requires intense

10280
02:44:12,790 --> 02:44:12,800
stressful it requires intense
 

10281
02:44:12,800 --> 02:44:14,150

neurochemical output

10282
02:44:14,150 --> 02:44:14,160
neurochemical output
 

10283
02:44:14,160 --> 02:44:15,590
neurochemical output
and he's doing that for multiple

10284
02:44:15,590 --> 02:44:15,600
and he's doing that for multiple
 

10285
02:44:15,600 --> 02:44:17,910
and he's doing that for multiple
projects so presumably he's buffered

how
 

10319
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:49,510
how
to optimize his biology and

02:44:49,510 --> 02:44:49,520
to optimize his biology and
 

10321
02:44:49,520 --> 02:44:51,429
to optimize his biology and
he's thinking about that not just for

10322
02:44:51,429 --> 02:44:51,439
he's thinking about that not just for
 

10323
02:44:51,439 --> 02:44:53,349
he's thinking about that not just for
himself but for all of neural link

because i think i'm not trying to dodge

10326
02:44:55,670 --> 02:44:55,680
because i think i'm not trying to dodge
 

10327
02:44:55,680 --> 02:44:56,950
because i think i'm not trying to dodge
the question but i think

10328
02:44:56,950 --> 02:44:56,960
the question but i think
 

10329
02:44:56,960 --> 02:44:58,389
the question but i think
there's the there's the scale of the

10330
02:44:58,389 --> 02:44:58,399
there's the there's the scale of the
 

10331
02:44:58,399 --> 02:45:00,230
there's the there's the scale of the
individual but then there's the

10332
02:45:00,230 --> 02:45:00,240
individual but then there's the
 

10333
02:45:00,240 --> 02:45:01,349
individual but then there's the
companies that

10334
02:45:01,349 --> 02:45:01,359
companies that
 

10335
02:45:01,359 --> 02:45:03,510

there that
 

10339
02:45:04,479 --> 02:45:06,150
there that
you could imagine if they're working at

10340
02:45:06,150 --> 02:45:06,160
you could imagine if they're working at
 

10341
02:45:06,160 --> 02:45:08,630
you could imagine if they're working at
ten percent better capacity or can focus

ten percent better capacity or can focus

02:45:11,279 --> 02:45:12,230
five percent better for twenty percent
of the day

10346
02:45:12,230 --> 02:45:12,240
of the day
 

10347
02:45:12,240 --> 02:45:14,870
of the day
you're looking at a enormous increase in

10348
02:45:14,870 --> 02:45:14,880
you're looking at a enormous increase in
 

10349
02:45:14,880 --> 02:45:16,230
you're looking at a enormous increase in
productivity and

10350
02:45:16,230 --> 02:45:16,240
productivity and
 

10351
02:45:16,240 --> 02:45:17,990
productivity and
a reduction in the time to reach goals

10352
02:45:17,990 --> 02:45:18,000
a reduction in the time to reach goals
 

10353
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:20,230
a reduction in the time to reach goals
which will reduce the amount of stress

10354
02:45:20,230 --> 02:45:20,240
which will reduce the amount of stress
 

10355
02:45:20,240 --> 02:45:21,830
which will reduce the amount of stress
presumably on elon unless he goes and

02:45:21,830 --> 02:45:21,840
presumably on elon unless he goes and
 

10357

02:45:23,590 --> 02:45:23,600
starts another endeavor
 

10359
02:45:23,600 --> 02:45:26,870
starts another endeavor
right so i think it's certainly not

10360
02:45:26,870 --> 02:45:26,880
right so i think it's certainly not
 

10361
02:45:26,880 --> 02:45:28,630
right so i think it's certainly not
healthy for most people

10362
02:45:28,630 --> 02:45:28,640
healthy for most people
 

10363

10367
02:45:31,920 --> 02:45:33,510
dopamine hits i'm also
really struck by the fact that he has a

that so
 

10377
02:45:39,040 --> 02:45:42,550
that so
it's super impressive i think that

10378
02:45:42,550 --> 02:45:42,560
it's super impressive i think that
 

10379
02:45:42,560 --> 02:45:45,830
it's super impressive i think that
um i don't know how old is elon yes 40

i'm pushing 50 i think 48
so even more impressive 29 because you

10384
02:45:51,990 --> 02:45:52,000
so even more impressive 29 because you
 

10385
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:52,389
so even more impressive 29 because you
know

10386
02:45:52,389 --> 02:45:52,399

you know it's like
puzzles it's constant puzzle solving i

10430
02:46:41,269 --> 02:46:41,279
puzzles it's constant puzzle solving i
 

10431
02:46:41,279 --> 02:46:42,870

actually sometimes i think maybe that's
 

10683
02:50:54,319 --> 02:50:56,070
actually sometimes i think maybe that's
true but a lot of times i just think

but there's so many gems out there in
 

10691
02:51:02,080 --> 02:51:03,670
but there's so many gems out there in
the world now it's almost

10692
02:51:03,670 --> 02:51:03,680
the world now it's almost
 

10693

the world now it's almost
like sure how you allocate time is key

10694
02:51:06,469 --> 02:51:06,479
like sure how you allocate time is key
 

10695
02:51:06,479 --> 02:51:07,030
like sure how you allocate time is key
but

10696
02:51:07,030 --> 02:51:07,040
but
 

10697
02:51:07,040 --> 02:51:11,190
but
i i think you can do it all

10698
02:51:11,190 --> 02:51:11,200
i i think you can do it all
 

10699
02:51:11,200 --> 02:51:13,510
i i think you can do it all
yeah maybe not five more things yeah yes

10700
02:51:13,510 --> 02:51:13,520
yeah maybe not five more things yeah yes
 

10701
02:51:13,520 --> 02:51:14,389
yeah maybe not five more things yeah yes
but all yes

10702

but all yes
 

10703
02:51:14,399 --> 02:51:16,150
but all yes
and one thing i just had this idea and

10704
02:51:16,150 --> 02:51:16,160
and one thing i just had this idea and
 

10705
02:51:16,160 --> 02:51:18,070
and one thing i just had this idea and
this is not grounded in any scientific

10706
02:51:18,070 --> 02:51:18,080
this is not grounded in any scientific
 

10707
02:51:18,080 --> 02:51:19,750
this is not grounded in any scientific
paper but i think the answer might come

10708
02:51:19,750 --> 02:51:19,760
paper but i think the answer might come
 

10709
02:51:19,760 --> 02:51:22,389
paper but i think the answer might come
to you during this um

10710
02:51:22,389 --> 02:51:22,399
to you during this um
 

10711

through with david because in those
 

10715
02:51:25,920 --> 02:51:27,830
through with david because in those
mental states you're really asking the

10716

10721
02:51:30,880 --> 02:51:32,550
right you're asking the question where
is my capacity

10722
02:51:32,550 --> 02:51:32,560
is my capacity
 

10723
02:51:32,560 --> 02:51:35,590
is my capacity
and am i even close to my capacity and
