reason he needed to eat so much is not
 

629
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,990
reason he needed to eat so much is not
that he was burning that many calories

that he was burning that many calories

in pure movement it's that when you do

water the heat transfer in water is
 

637
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,150
water the heat transfer in water is
greater so you burn far more calories

638

greater so you burn far more calories

really early on that if you give a talk
 

697
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,230
really early on that if you give a talk
about your data and you cite all these

about your data and you cite all these
 

699
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,470
about your data and you cite all these
amazing sources all it does is

standing on the shoulders of giants is a
powerful thing

powerful thing
 

739
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,750
powerful thing
but there's also a culture of not giving

00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:17,760
but there's also a culture of not giving
 

741
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,190
but there's also a culture of not giving

but especially in science when they're

758
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:35,040
but especially in science when they're
 

759
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,269
but especially in science when they're
as the closer they get and the exactly

as the closer they get and the exactly

and so there's this dance you know

764
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:41,200
and so there's this dance you know
 

765
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,190
and so there's this dance you know
there's a few researchers

766
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:43,200
there's a few researchers
 

767
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,790
there's a few researchers
in each of the individual little things

768
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:44,800
in each of the individual little things
 

769
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,069
in each of the individual little things
that you work on

770
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:46,079
that you work on
 

771
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,590
that you work on
if you're studying a particular kind of

772
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:47,600
if you're studying a particular kind of
 

773
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,990
if you're studying a particular kind of
ant you know that other [\h__\h]

774
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:50,000
ant you know that other [\h__\h]
 

775
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,750
ant you know that other [\h__\h]
that also is studying that particular

776
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:51,760
that also is studying that particular
 

777
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,710
that also is studying that particular
ant and then you're not going to often

778
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:54,720
ant and then you're not going to often
 

779
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,430
ant and then you're not going to often
give credit for the brilliant ideas that

780
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:57,440
give credit for the brilliant ideas that
 

781
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,069
give credit for the brilliant ideas that
that other researcher is doing and i

782
00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:00,079
that other researcher is doing and i
 

783
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,190
that other researcher is doing and i
think one of the things you've

784
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:01,200
think one of the things you've
 

785
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,030
think one of the things you've
discovered and just as part of your

which is why it's it's really great that

other ant study here it's great and you

00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:13,760
other ant study here it's great and you

everybody wins it it raises all boats

800
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:16,720
everybody wins it it raises all boats
 

801
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,670
everybody wins it it raises all boats

1293
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,710
fortune of spending time with him out
away from the microphones so to speak

1294
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:46,720
away from the microphones so to speak
 

1295
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,070
away from the microphones so to speak
joe is joe

1296
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:48,080
joe is joe
 

1297
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,630
joe is joe
so can you speak to your that process

1298
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:50,640
so can you speak to your that process
 

1299
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,830
so can you speak to your that process
you mentioned the walking and the

1300
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:51,840
you mentioned the walking and the
 

1301
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,870
you mentioned the walking and the
talking to yourself because that's

1302
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:52,880
talking to yourself because that's
 

1303
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,510
talking to yourself because that's
fascinating yeah i try and

1304
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:55,520
fascinating yeah i try and
 

1305
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,510
fascinating yeah i try and
do a couple of things um

1306
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:57,520
do a couple of things um
 

1307
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,430
do a couple of things um
first of all i when i was a kid i had a

1308
00:21:59,430 --> 00:21:59,440
first of all i when i was a kid i had a
 

1309
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,430
first of all i when i was a kid i had a
little bit of a grunting tick

1310
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:01,440
little bit of a grunting tick
 

1311
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,110
little bit of a grunting tick
when i was five or six

1312
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:03,120
when i was five or six
 

1313
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,430
when i was five or six
i would feel this buildup of tension in

1314
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:05,440
i would feel this buildup of tension in
 

1315
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,549
i would feel this buildup of tension in
my throat

1316
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:06,559
my throat
 

1317
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:07,830
my throat
and i would do this grunting tick if i

1318
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:07,840
and i would do this grunting tick if i
 

1319
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,390
and i would do this grunting tick if i
get very tired i start to do it still we

1320
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:10,400
get very tired i start to do it still we
 

1321
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,830
get very tired i start to do it still we
actually know that this is related to

1322
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:11,840
actually know that this is related to
 

1323
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,830
actually know that this is related to
these basal ganglia circuits for go no

1324
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:13,840
these basal ganglia circuits for go no
 

1325
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,270
these basal ganglia circuits for go no
go you've got an accelerator and a break

1326
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:15,280
go you've got an accelerator and a break
 

1327
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,830
go you've got an accelerator and a break
basically in your neural circuitry and

1328
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:17,840
basically in your neural circuitry and
 

1329
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,750
basically in your neural circuitry and
um kids with turrets in ocd um the break

1330
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:21,760
um kids with turrets in ocd um the break
 

1331
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,750
um kids with turrets in ocd um the break
doesn't work quite as well and so one

1332
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:23,760
doesn't work quite as well and so one
 

1333
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,110
doesn't work quite as well and so one
thing that happens is if i wake up in

1334
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:25,120
thing that happens is if i wake up in
 

1335
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,390
thing that happens is if i wake up in
the morning and i'm especially if i'm

1336
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:26,400
the morning and i'm especially if i'm
 

1337
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,750
the morning and i'm especially if i'm
well rested

1338
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:27,760
well rested
 

1339
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,190
well rested
well if i'm not well rested i do a

1340
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:29,200
well if i'm not well rested i do a
 

1341
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,350
well if i'm not well rested i do a
hypnosis or yoga nidra in order to

1342
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:31,360
hypnosis or yoga nidra in order to
 

1343
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,950
hypnosis or yoga nidra in order to
recover my sleep that works really well

1344
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:32,960
recover my sleep that works really well
 

1345
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,870
recover my sleep that works really well
but then once i'm into the process of

1346
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:34,880
but then once i'm into the process of
 

1347
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,630
but then once i'm into the process of
preparing the podcast

1348
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:36,640
preparing the podcast
 

1349
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,909
preparing the podcast
i've already gone through my notes i

1350
00:22:37,909 --> 00:22:37,919
i've already gone through my notes i
 

1351
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,430
i've already gone through my notes i
know what i want to say more or less in

1352
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:39,440
know what i want to say more or less in
 

1353
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,350
know what i want to say more or less in
a kind of general contour and then i

1354
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:41,360
a kind of general contour and then i
 

1355
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,430
a kind of general contour and then i
take a walk and i

1356
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:43,440
take a walk and i
 

1357
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,909
take a walk and i
i try to so no phone with me and i try

1358
00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:45,919
i try to so no phone with me and i try
 

1359
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:47,430
i try to so no phone with me and i try
to assess

1360
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:47,440
to assess
 

1361
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,990
to assess
whether or not my energy is too high or

1362
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:50,000
whether or not my energy is too high or
 

1363
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,549
whether or not my energy is too high or
too low for podcasting because when you

1364
00:22:52,549 --> 00:22:52,559
too low for podcasting because when you
 

1365
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,950
too low for podcasting because when you
podcast as you know you have to punch

1366
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:54,960
podcast as you know you have to punch
 

1367
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,149
podcast as you know you have to punch
out a lot of material but then there's

1368
00:22:56,149 --> 00:22:56,159
out a lot of material but then there's
 

1369
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,510
out a lot of material but then there's
times when you really need to slow down

1370
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:57,520
times when you really need to slow down
 

1371
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,510
times when you really need to slow down
and emphasize and articulate

1372
00:22:59,510 --> 00:22:59,520
and emphasize and articulate
 

1373
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,470
and emphasize and articulate
and so

1374
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:00,480
and so
 

1375
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,909

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,510
uh what i do actually is i will recite
the lyrics of songs for about 10 minutes

1382
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:09,520
the lyrics of songs for about 10 minutes
 

1383
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,549
the lyrics of songs for about 10 minutes
um songs i love while i walk out loud it

do i think it gets my vocal cords

1388
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:17,360
do i think it gets my vocal cords
 

1389
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,549
do i think it gets my vocal cords
warmed up and it also do you sing or

1390
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:20,559
warmed up and it also do you sing or
 

1391

speak them i often sing them
 

1393
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,230
speak them i often sing them
and unfortunately nobody hears and as i

1394
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:26,240
and unfortunately nobody hears and as i
 

1395
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,029
and unfortunately nobody hears and as i
do this i start to evaluate whether or

1396
00:23:29,029 --> 00:23:29,039
do this i start to evaluate whether or
 

1397
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,789
do this i start to evaluate whether or
not i'm straining to get the words out

1398
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:30,799
not i'm straining to get the words out
 

1399
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,590
not i'm straining to get the words out
or whether or not i'm straining to

1400
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:33,600
or whether or not i'm straining to
 

1401
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,430
or whether or not i'm straining to
make them slow enough so that i can

1402
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:35,440
make them slow enough so that i can
 

1403
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,110
make them slow enough so that i can
articulate them

1404
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:37,120
articulate them
 

1405
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,630
articulate them
so there are days when i have so much

1406
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:38,640
so there are days when i have so much
 

1407
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,830
so there are days when i have so much
energy

1408
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:39,840
energy
 

1409
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,350
energy
that i

1410
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:41,360
that i
 

1411
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,310
that i
i'm trying to speak faster than i should

1412
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:44,320
i'm trying to speak faster than i should
 

1413
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,070
i'm trying to speak faster than i should
in order to articulate properly there

1414
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,080
in order to articulate properly there
 

1415
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,510
in order to articulate properly there
are other days when i'm tired and i

1416
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:47,520
are other days when i'm tired and i
 

1417
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,510
are other days when i'm tired and i
can't sort of keep up with my thoughts

1418
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:49,520
can't sort of keep up with my thoughts
 

1419
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,430
can't sort of keep up with my thoughts
and so what i try and do is assess that

1420
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:51,440
and so what i try and do is assess that
 

1421
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,149
and so what i try and do is assess that
and then adjust the transmission the rpm

1422
00:23:54,149 --> 00:23:54,159
and then adjust the transmission the rpm
 

1423
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,990
and then adjust the transmission the rpm
so to speak for instance i can speak

1424
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:56,000
so to speak for instance i can speak
 

1425
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,909
so to speak for instance i can speak
very quickly and then i can slow down so

1426
00:23:57,909 --> 00:23:57,919
very quickly and then i can slow down so
 

1427
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,750
very quickly and then i can slow down so
i can change the cadence of my voice and

1428
00:23:59,750 --> 00:23:59,760
i can change the cadence of my voice and
 

1429
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,510
i can change the cadence of my voice and
when you teach in the classroom you

1430
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:01,520
when you teach in the classroom you
 

1431
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,269
when you teach in the classroom you
learn as you know because you're an

1432
00:24:03,269 --> 00:24:03,279
learn as you know because you're an
 

1433
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,390
learn as you know because you're an

you're somebody who's given a lot of

2388
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:57,520
you're somebody who's given a lot of
 

2389
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,470
you're somebody who's given a lot of
power

2390
00:39:58,470 --> 00:39:58,480
power
 

2391
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,430
power
and slowly you start to abuse that power

2392
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:01,440
and slowly you start to abuse that power
 

2393
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,910
and slowly you start to abuse that power
and what does that person become who are

2394
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:03,920
and what does that person become who are
 

2395
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,150
and what does that person become who are
you i have to plug myself into those

2396
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:06,160
you i have to plug myself into those
 

2397
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,309
you i have to plug myself into those
moments in my life in the past where

2398
00:40:08,309 --> 00:40:08,319
moments in my life in the past where
 

2399
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:11,030
moments in my life in the past where
i've been angry at something uh

2400
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:11,040
i've been angry at something uh
 

2401
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:11,829
i've been angry at something uh
and

2402
00:40:11,829 --> 00:40:11,839
and
 

2403
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:13,670
and
where i've been cruel because i was

2404
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:13,680
where i've been cruel because i was
 

2405
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,150
where i've been cruel because i was
angry in little ways but then you

2406
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:16,160
angry in little ways but then you
 

2407
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,630
angry in little ways but then you
magnify them at scale and i have to have

2408
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:18,640
magnify them at scale and i have to have
 

2409
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,190
magnify them at scale and i have to have
to go there and that's very human and

2410
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:21,200
to go there and that's very human and
 

2411
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,950
to go there and that's very human and
then i have to look at another person

2412
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:22,960
then i have to look at another person
 

2413
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,790
then i have to look at another person
from across the table for me and

2414
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:24,800
from across the table for me and
 

2415
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,790
from across the table for me and
understand well you're there too

2416
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:26,800
understand well you're there too
 

2417
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,750
understand well you're there too
and then you had more opportunity to do

2418
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:29,760
and then you had more opportunity to do
 

2419
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,150
and then you had more opportunity to do
truly cruel things and and then um

2420
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:34,160
truly cruel things and and then um
 

2421
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,990
truly cruel things and and then um
and then where like i have to plug

2422
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:36,000
and then where like i have to plug
 

2423
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,309
and then where like i have to plug
myself into places where i've been i can

2424
00:40:38,309 --> 00:40:38,319
myself into places where i've been i can
 

2425
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:40,790
myself into places where i've been i can
imagine i can go where i was cruel to

2426
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:40,800
imagine i can go where i was cruel to
 

2427
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,190
imagine i can go where i was cruel to
others and was unaware of it

2428
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:43,200
others and was unaware of it
 

2429
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,870
others and was unaware of it
so i was in my space where i was

2430
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:44,880
so i was in my space where i was
 

2431
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,790
so i was in my space where i was
thinking that i'm doing good and i was

2432
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:46,800
thinking that i'm doing good and i was
 

2433
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,230
thinking that i'm doing good and i was
doing not good

2434
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:48,240
doing not good
 

2435
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,309
doing not good
again i've never got an opportunity to

2436
00:40:50,309 --> 00:40:50,319
again i've never got an opportunity to
 

2437
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:52,390
again i've never got an opportunity to
do any of those things at a large scale

2438
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:52,400
do any of those things at a large scale
 

2439
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,069
do any of those things at a large scale
but all of us have done it at a small

2440
00:40:54,069 --> 00:40:54,079
but all of us have done it at a small
 

2441
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,710
but all of us have done it at a small
scale sure and i plug myself into that

2442
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:56,720
scale sure and i plug myself into that
 

2443
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,990
scale sure and i plug myself into that
and then we're we're here or two if it's

2444
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:00,000
and then we're we're here or two if it's
 

2445
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,670
and then we're we're here or two if it's
somebody who's in prison if it's

2446
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:01,680
somebody who's in prison if it's
 

2447
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,910
somebody who's in prison if it's
somebody who's a dictator we're in that

2448
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:03,920
somebody who's a dictator we're in that
 

2449
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,870
somebody who's a dictator we're in that
space

2450
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:04,880
space
 

2451
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,390
space
where evil is

2452
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:06,400
where evil is
 

2453
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,630
where evil is
is all of us have the capacity to do

2454
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:08,640
is all of us have the capacity to do
 

2455
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,030
is all of us have the capacity to do
that evil and i have to imagine myself

2456
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:11,040
that evil and i have to imagine myself
 

2457
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,349
that evil and i have to imagine myself
being able to do that evil

2458
00:41:13,349 --> 00:41:13,359
being able to do that evil
 

2459
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:15,910
being able to do that evil
and then we're here together in that

2460
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:15,920
and then we're here together in that
 

2461
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,910
and then we're here together in that
dark dark place

2462
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:17,920
dark dark place
 

2463
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,390
dark dark place
and then if if it's just right something

2464
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:20,400
and then if if it's just right something
 

2465
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,309
and then if if it's just right something
real can actually come something from

2466
00:41:22,309 --> 00:41:22,319
real can actually come something from
 

2467
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,390
real can actually come something from
that person's childhood i may be

2468
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:24,400
that person's childhood i may be
 

2469
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,790
that person's childhood i may be
awakening to uh

2470
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:26,800
awakening to uh
 

2471
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,030
awakening to uh
realization that i thought it was a good

2472
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:29,040
realization that i thought it was a good
 

2473
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,710
realization that i thought it was a good
person and i'm not

2474
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:30,720
person and i'm not
 

2475
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,589
person and i'm not
and

2476
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:31,599
and
 

2477
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,910
and
for that only happens when you truly

2478
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:33,920
for that only happens when you truly
 

2479
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,470
for that only happens when you truly
empathize those moments of discovery are

2480
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:36,480
empathize those moments of discovery are
 

2481
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,990
empathize those moments of discovery are
beautiful but they also happen in

2482
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:38,000
beautiful but they also happen in
 

2483
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,270
beautiful but they also happen in
science when you just have a

2484
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:39,280
science when you just have a
 

2485
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,390
science when you just have a
conversation and you realize uh i feel

2486
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:42,400
conversation and you realize uh i feel
 

2487
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,069
conversation and you realize uh i feel
like talking to stephen wolfram i feel

like talking to stephen wolfram i feel
like we constantly realize

2490
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:46,160
like we constantly realize
 

2491
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,309
like we constantly realize
beautiful things together on this

2492
00:41:48,309 --> 00:41:48,319
beautiful things together on this
 

2493

debated in the psychology community and

2520
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:20,480
debated in the psychology community and
 

2521
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,710

in the neuroscience community

2522

in the neuroscience community
 

2523
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,589
in the neuroscience community
and as a matter of philosophy but

2524
00:42:25,589 --> 00:42:25,599
and as a matter of philosophy but
 

2525
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:28,309
and as a matter of philosophy but
there are certain people not many but

2526
00:42:28,309 --> 00:42:28,319
there are certain people not many but
 

2527
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:30,150
there are certain people not many but
there are certain people for whom

2528
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:30,160
there are certain people for whom
 

2529
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,190
there are certain people for whom
they've actually lived out many versions

2530
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:33,200
they've actually lived out many versions
 

2531
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,589
they've actually lived out many versions
of their possible selves

2532
00:42:35,589 --> 00:42:35,599
of their possible selves
 

2533
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:37,670
of their possible selves
in the first person and so those are

2534
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:37,680
in the first person and so those are
 

2535
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,750
in the first person and so those are
unique individuals then even if they

2536
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:39,760
unique individuals then even if they
 

2537
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,589
unique individuals then even if they
tapped into these things that as you

2538
00:42:41,589 --> 00:42:41,599
tapped into these things that as you
 

2539
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:44,470
tapped into these things that as you
mentioned as a at a more minor level as

2540
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:44,480
mentioned as a at a more minor level as
 

2541
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,510
mentioned as a at a more minor level as
opposed to

2542
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:45,520

there's something about creating a

3152
00:52:32,069 --> 00:52:32,079
there's something about creating a
 

3153
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:33,589
there's something about creating a
feeling i have a sense that there's a

3154
00:52:33,589 --> 00:52:33,599
feeling i have a sense that there's a
 

3155
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:35,109
feeling i have a sense that there's a
robot over there there's there's

3156
00:52:35,109 --> 00:52:35,119
robot over there there's there's
 

3157
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:37,190
robot over there there's there's
severals throughout this place and i i

3158
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:37,200
severals throughout this place and i i
 

3159
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,829
severals throughout this place and i i
think

3160
00:52:39,829 --> 00:52:39,839

 

3161
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:42,790

i think part of that

3162
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:42,800
i think part of that
 

3163
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,549
i think part of that
part of creating a feeling would be

3164
00:52:44,549 --> 00:52:44,559
part of creating a feeling would be
 

3165
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:47,030
part of creating a feeling would be
having the robots constantly moving

3166
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:47,040
having the robots constantly moving
 

3167
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,910
having the robots constantly moving
around and having a mind of their own

3168
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:49,920
around and having a mind of their own
 

3169
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,349
around and having a mind of their own
because that would

3170
00:52:51,349 --> 00:52:51,359
because that would
 

3171
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:53,030
because that would
most closely

3172
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:53,040
most closely
 

3173
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,910
most closely
put guests and other humans they

3174
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:55,920
put guests and other humans they
 

3175
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,990
put guests and other humans they
interact with into a place

3176
00:52:57,990 --> 00:52:58,000
interact with into a place
 

3177
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,190
interact with into a place
that's

3178
00:52:59,190 --> 00:52:59,200
that's
 

3179
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:02,069
that's
um closest to my mind because of such an

3180
00:53:02,069 --> 00:53:02,079
um closest to my mind because of such an
 

3181
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:05,349
um closest to my mind because of such an
engineering mind and and one where when

3182
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:05,359
engineering mind and and one where when
 

3183
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:07,190
engineering mind and and one where when
things come to life it's a beautiful

you know evacuative projection when

5360
01:30:37,830 --> 01:30:37,840

people feel something and they try and
 

5363
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:41,270
people feel something and they try and
evacuate it and project it onto somebody

5364
01:30:41,270 --> 01:30:41,280
evacuate it and project it onto somebody
 

5365
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:43,189

what you essentially just said is that

5368
01:30:44,550 --> 01:30:44,560
what you essentially just said is that
 

5369
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:46,629
what you essentially just said is that
you don't accept projections

5370
01:30:46,629 --> 01:30:46,639
you don't accept projections
 

5371
01:30:46,639 --> 01:30:49,510
you don't accept projections
in in fact you transmute them to put in

5372
01:30:49,510 --> 01:30:49,520
in in fact you transmute them to put in
 

5373
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:51,189
in in fact you transmute them to put in
the language of the buddhists you know

5374
01:30:51,189 --> 01:30:51,199
the language of the buddhists you know
 

5375
01:30:51,199 --> 01:30:53,430
the language of the buddhists you know
you transmute it into positivity and in

5376
01:30:53,430 --> 01:30:53,440
you transmute it into positivity and in
 

5377
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:56,070
you transmute it into positivity and in
that way you you you truly neutralize it

5378
01:30:56,070 --> 01:30:56,080
that way you you you truly neutralize it
 

5379
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:57,030
that way you you you truly neutralize it
um

5380
01:30:57,030 --> 01:30:57,040
um
 

5381
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:58,470
um
and transmute it

5382
01:30:58,470 --> 01:30:58,480
and transmute it
 

5383
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:00,629
and transmute it
i think that

5384
01:31:00,629 --> 01:31:00,639
i think that
 

5385
01:31:00,639 --> 01:31:03,030
i think that
if people were better understood when

5386
01:31:03,030 --> 01:31:03,040
if people were better understood when
 

5387
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,870
if people were better understood when
they were experiencing or observing

5388
01:31:04,870 --> 01:31:04,880
they were experiencing or observing
 

5389
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:06,790
they were experiencing or observing
evacuative projection

5390
01:31:06,790 --> 01:31:06,800
evacuative projection
 

5391
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,310
evacuative projection
um

5392
01:31:08,310 --> 01:31:08,320
um
 

5393
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:10,070
um
the world would be a much healthier and

5394
01:31:10,070 --> 01:31:10,080
the world would be a much healthier and
 

5395
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:12,950
the world would be a much healthier and
happier place but it requires a certain

5396
01:31:12,950 --> 01:31:12,960
happier place but it requires a certain
 

5397
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:16,229
happier place but it requires a certain
a stable internal rudder and um you know

5398
01:31:16,229 --> 01:31:16,239
a stable internal rudder and um you know
 

5399
01:31:16,239 --> 01:31:18,310
a stable internal rudder and um you know
when we're tired or sick or angry you

5400

all of us are less less good at it i've
been positively struck by the nature of

5406
01:31:25,590 --> 01:31:25,600
been positively struck by the nature of
 

5407
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:26,950
been positively struck by the nature of
most of the

5408
01:31:26,950 --> 01:31:26,960
most of the
 

5409
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:29,189
most of the
interactions not just feedback but

5410
01:31:29,189 --> 01:31:29,199
interactions not just feedback but
 

5411
01:31:29,199 --> 01:31:30,790
interactions not just feedback but
my favorite thing

an aggressor in that way so it's very so

6830
01:55:27,270 --> 01:55:27,280
an aggressor in that way so it's very so
 

6831

them even though the circumstances are
 

6837
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:34,870
them even though the circumstances are
different and people also forget they

in the outside life but their careers
 

6873
01:56:06,400 --> 01:56:08,229
in the outside life but their careers
were built on

6874
01:56:08,229 --> 01:56:08,239
were built on
 

6875
01:56:08,239 --> 01:56:09,109
were built on
the

6876
01:56:09,109 --> 01:56:09,119
the
 

6877
01:56:09,119 --> 01:56:10,709
the
business of

6878
01:56:10,709 --> 01:56:10,719
business of
 

6879
01:56:10,719 --> 01:56:12,950
business of
pretending to be other people yeah and

6880
01:56:12,950 --> 01:56:12,960
pretending to be other people yeah and
 

6881
01:56:12,960 --> 01:56:15,510
pretending to be other people yeah and
that's got to distort

6882
01:56:15,510 --> 01:56:15,520
that's got to distort
 

6883
01:56:15,520 --> 01:56:18,310
that's got to distort
maybe positively but also just

6884
01:56:18,310 --> 01:56:18,320
maybe positively but also just
 

6885
01:56:18,320 --> 01:56:19,629
maybe positively but also just
let's be honest what it is that the

6886
01:56:19,629 --> 01:56:19,639
let's be honest what it is that the
 

6887
01:56:19,639 --> 01:56:22,070
let's be honest what it is that the
neuroplasticity there the changes in the

6888
01:56:22,070 --> 01:56:22,080
neuroplasticity there the changes in the
 

6889
01:56:22,080 --> 01:56:23,350
neuroplasticity there the changes in the
areas of the brain that represent

6890
01:56:23,350 --> 01:56:23,360
areas of the brain that represent
 

6891
01:56:23,360 --> 01:56:25,270
areas of the brain that represent
personality have to be quite different

6892
01:56:25,270 --> 01:56:25,280
personality have to be quite different
 

6893
01:56:25,280 --> 01:56:26,950
personality have to be quite different
for somebody who pretends to be lots of

6894
01:56:26,950 --> 01:56:26,960
for somebody who pretends to be lots of
 

6895
01:56:26,960 --> 01:56:28,390
for somebody who pretends to be lots of
different personalities and gets paid

6896
01:56:28,390 --> 01:56:28,400
different personalities and gets paid
 

6897
01:56:28,400 --> 01:56:30,790
different personalities and gets paid
for it you're working the reward system

6898
01:56:30,790 --> 01:56:30,800
for it you're working the reward system
 

6899
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:34,070
for it you're working the reward system
into the system of self-identity and

6900
01:56:34,070 --> 01:56:34,080
into the system of self-identity and
 

6901
01:56:34,080 --> 01:56:36,149
into the system of self-identity and
you know you have to imagine that that

6902
01:56:36,149 --> 01:56:36,159
you know you have to imagine that that
 

6903
01:56:36,159 --> 01:56:38,390
you know you have to imagine that that
can really

6904
01:56:38,390 --> 01:56:38,400
can really
 

6905
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:41,589
can really
contort somebody's neurology in ways

6906
01:56:41,589 --> 01:56:41,599
contort somebody's neurology in ways
 

6907
01:56:41,599 --> 01:56:44,149
contort somebody's neurology in ways
that maybe they are not as in maybe they

6908
01:56:44,149 --> 01:56:44,159
that maybe they are not as in maybe they
 

6909
01:56:44,159 --> 01:56:45,910
that maybe they are not as in maybe they
are not in touch with reality in the

6910
01:56:45,910 --> 01:56:45,920
are not in touch with reality in the
 

6911
01:56:45,920 --> 01:56:47,589
are not in touch with reality in the
same way that we are remember earlier we

6912
01:56:47,589 --> 01:56:47,599
same way that we are remember earlier we
 

6913
01:56:47,599 --> 01:56:49,750
same way that we are remember earlier we
talked about neurotic versus psychotic

6914
01:56:49,750 --> 01:56:49,760
talked about neurotic versus psychotic
 

6915
01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:53,030
talked about neurotic versus psychotic

you know they may be more borderline
 

6917
01:56:53,040 --> 01:56:55,430
you know they may be more borderline
in their kind of ground state than than

6918
01:56:55,430 --> 01:56:55,440
in their kind of ground state than than
 

6919
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:57,109
in their kind of ground state than than
we think and so i'm actually impressed

6920
01:56:57,109 --> 01:56:57,119
we think and so i'm actually impressed
 

6921
01:56:57,119 --> 01:56:58,709
we think and so i'm actually impressed
anytime there's a celebrity who doesn't

they're just shitty
 

6943
01:57:18,560 --> 01:57:19,910
they're just shitty
you should probably talk privately

6944
01:57:19,910 --> 01:57:19,920
you should probably talk privately
 

6945
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:22,709
you should probably talk privately
man-to-man uh not because otherwise it's

6946
01:57:22,709 --> 01:57:22,719
man-to-man uh not because otherwise it's
 

6947
01:57:22,719 --> 01:57:24,550
man-to-man uh not because otherwise it's
like a dramatic display

6948
01:57:24,550 --> 01:57:24,560
like a dramatic display
 

6949
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:26,149
like a dramatic display
it's like it's almost like you are a

6950
01:57:26,149 --> 01:57:26,159
it's like it's almost like you are a
 

6951
01:57:26,159 --> 01:57:28,229
it's like it's almost like you are a
fake act you're acting well they're all

6952
01:57:28,229 --> 01:57:28,239
fake act you're acting well they're all

6954
01:57:30,470 --> 01:57:30,480
these questions right i mean obviously
 

6955
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:31,669
these questions right i mean obviously
it was

6956
01:57:31,669 --> 01:57:31,679
it was
 

6957
01:57:31,679 --> 01:57:33,430
it was
aggressive at some level there's this

6958
01:57:33,430 --> 01:57:33,440
aggressive at some level there's this
 

6959
01:57:33,440 --> 01:57:34,950
aggressive at some level there's this
question of whether or not it was

6960
01:57:34,950 --> 01:57:34,960
question of whether or not it was
 

6961
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:37,189
question of whether or not it was
impulsive i think most people feel yes

6962
01:57:37,189 --> 01:57:37,199
impulsive i think most people feel yes
 

6963
01:57:37,199 --> 01:57:38,229
impulsive i think most people feel yes
there's a question there was the

6964
01:57:38,229 --> 01:57:38,239
there's a question there was the
 

6965
01:57:38,239 --> 01:57:39,910
there's a question there was the
protective nature of it because he was

6966
01:57:39,910 --> 01:57:39,920
protective nature of it because he was
 

6967
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:42,950
protective nature of it because he was
doing it to you know in it apparently to

6968
01:57:42,950 --> 01:57:42,960
doing it to you know in it apparently to
 

6969
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:45,589
doing it to you know in it apparently to
in defense but then there's also the the

6970
01:57:45,589 --> 01:57:45,599
in defense but then there's also the the
 

6971
01:57:45,599 --> 01:57:47,189
in defense but then there's also the the
context

6972
01:57:47,189 --> 01:57:47,199
context
 

6973
01:57:47,199 --> 01:57:50,390
context
he lost touch with the context right um

6974
01:57:50,390 --> 01:57:50,400
he lost touch with the context right um
 

6975
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:53,189
he lost touch with the context right um
whereas chris rock basically gets um

6976
01:57:53,189 --> 01:57:53,199
whereas chris rock basically gets um
 

6977
01:57:53,199 --> 01:57:55,109
whereas chris rock basically gets um
there there's the possible critique that

6978
01:57:55,109 --> 01:57:55,119
there there's the possible critique that
 

6979
01:57:55,119 --> 01:57:56,709
there there's the possible critique that
he went too far

6980
01:57:56,709 --> 01:57:56,719
he went too far
 

6981
01:57:56,719 --> 01:57:57,750
he went too far
that's going to be in the eye of the

6982
01:57:57,750 --> 01:57:57,760
that's going to be in the eye of the
 

6983
01:57:57,760 --> 01:58:00,149
that's going to be in the eye of the
beholder um but then and depending on

6984
01:58:00,149 --> 01:58:00,159
beholder um but then and depending on
 

6985
01:58:00,159 --> 01:58:01,750

you've experienced this if you've ever
been in deep research or podcasting

7464
02:06:22,069 --> 02:06:22,079
been in deep research or podcasting
 

7465
02:06:22,079 --> 02:06:23,510
been in deep research or podcasting
podcasting and then all of a sudden you

7466
02:06:23,510 --> 02:06:23,520
podcasting and then all of a sudden you
 

7467
02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:25,109
podcasting and then all of a sudden you
go for a run you probably spend the

7468
02:06:25,109 --> 02:06:25,119
go for a run you probably spend the
 

7469
02:06:25,119 --> 02:06:27,270
go for a run you probably spend the
first third of that run thinking and

7470
02:06:27,270 --> 02:06:27,280
first third of that run thinking and
 

7471
02:06:27,280 --> 02:06:28,870
first third of that run thinking and
then in the middle 30 you're kind of

7472
02:06:28,870 --> 02:06:28,880
then in the middle 30 you're kind of
 

7473
02:06:28,880 --> 02:06:30,950
then in the middle 30 you're kind of
that thinking is is fractured a bit and

7474
02:06:30,950 --> 02:06:30,960
that thinking is is fractured a bit and
 

7475
02:06:30,960 --> 02:06:32,470
that thinking is is fractured a bit and
then in the final third is where you

7476
02:06:32,470 --> 02:06:32,480
then in the final third is where you
 

7477
02:06:32,480 --> 02:06:35,030
then in the final third is where you
finally get to relax because the brain

7478
02:06:35,030 --> 02:06:35,040
finally get to relax because the brain
 

7479
02:06:35,040 --> 02:06:37,270

but just as valuable is the transition
 

7515

enlightenment

7620
02:08:57,990 --> 02:08:58,000

and then commits suicide

7622
02:09:00,470 --> 02:09:00,480
and then commits suicide
 

7623
02:09:00,480 --> 02:09:03,430
and then commits suicide
so these very unusual brain states are

7624
02:09:03,430 --> 02:09:03,440
so these very unusual brain states are
 

7625
02:09:03,440 --> 02:09:05,109
so these very unusual brain states are
are potentially hazardous if people

7626
02:09:05,109 --> 02:09:05,119
are potentially hazardous if people
 

7627
02:09:05,119 --> 02:09:07,189
are potentially hazardous if people
can't return from them

7628
02:09:07,189 --> 02:09:07,199
can't return from them
 

7629
02:09:07,199 --> 02:09:10,470
can't return from them
so it's nice to focus not on those brain

7630
02:09:10,470 --> 02:09:10,480
so it's nice to focus not on those brain
 

7631
02:09:10,480 --> 02:09:12,870
so it's nice to focus not on those brain
states but instead on the shifting right

7632
02:09:12,870 --> 02:09:12,880
states but instead on the shifting right
 

7633
02:09:12,880 --> 02:09:14,870
states but instead on the shifting right

other emotions in their body to learn to

is there advice you have for
 

8173
02:18:25,920 --> 02:18:28,070
is there advice you have for
how to achieve focus

8174
02:18:28,070 --> 02:18:28,080
how to achieve focus
 

8175
02:18:28,080 --> 02:18:29,750
how to achieve focus
on a task

8176
02:18:29,750 --> 02:18:29,760
on a task
 

8177
02:18:29,760 --> 02:18:31,110
on a task
yes

8178
02:18:31,110 --> 02:18:31,120
yes
 

8179
02:18:31,120 --> 02:18:32,389
yes
first of all we have to distinguish

8180
02:18:32,389 --> 02:18:32,399
first of all we have to distinguish
 

8181
02:18:32,399 --> 02:18:34,790
first of all we have to distinguish
between modulators and mediators and

8182
02:18:34,790 --> 02:18:34,800
between modulators and mediators and
 

8183
02:18:34,800 --> 02:18:36,549
between modulators and mediators and
i'll do this very briefly

8184
02:18:36,549 --> 02:18:36,559
i'll do this very briefly
 

8185
02:18:36,559 --> 02:18:37,750
i'll do this very briefly
there are a lot of things that will

8186
02:18:37,750 --> 02:18:37,760
there are a lot of things that will
 

8187
02:18:37,760 --> 02:18:39,349
there are a lot of things that will
modulate your state of focus but they

8188
02:18:39,349 --> 02:18:39,359
modulate your state of focus but they
 

8189
02:18:39,359 --> 02:18:41,589
modulate your state of focus but they
don't directly mediate your sense of

8190
02:18:41,589 --> 02:18:41,599
don't directly mediate your sense of
 

8191
02:18:41,599 --> 02:18:43,830
don't directly mediate your sense of
focus so for instance if right now a

8192
02:18:43,830 --> 02:18:43,840
focus so for instance if right now a
 

8193
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:45,990
focus so for instance if right now a
fire alarm went off in this building it

8194
02:18:45,990 --> 02:18:46,000
fire alarm went off in this building it
 

8195
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,230
fire alarm went off in this building it
would modulate our attention we would

8196
02:18:48,230 --> 02:18:48,240
would modulate our attention we would
 

8197
02:18:48,240 --> 02:18:49,910
would modulate our attention we would
get up and leave it'd be very hard to do

8198
02:18:49,910 --> 02:18:49,920
get up and leave it'd be very hard to do
 

8199
02:18:49,920 --> 02:18:51,349
get up and leave it'd be very hard to do
what we're doing with that banging in

8200
02:18:51,349 --> 02:18:51,359
what we're doing with that banging in
 

8201
02:18:51,359 --> 02:18:54,150
what we're doing with that banging in
the background at least at first

8202
02:18:54,150 --> 02:18:54,160
the background at least at first
 

8203
02:18:54,160 --> 02:18:56,309
the background at least at first
so it's modulating focus but it's not

8204
02:18:56,309 --> 02:18:56,319
so it's modulating focus but it's not
 

8205
02:18:56,319 --> 02:18:57,669
so it's modulating focus but it's not
really

8206
02:18:57,669 --> 02:18:57,679
really
 

8207
02:18:57,679 --> 02:18:59,589
really
involved in the mechanisms of focus

8208
02:18:59,589 --> 02:18:59,599
involved in the mechanisms of focus
 

8209
02:18:59,599 --> 02:19:00,950
involved in the mechanisms of focus
right

8210
02:19:00,950 --> 02:19:00,960
right
 

8211
02:19:00,960 --> 02:19:03,429
right
in the same way being well rested when

8212
02:19:03,429 --> 02:19:03,439
in the same way being well rested when
 

8213
02:19:03,439 --> 02:19:05,509
in the same way being well rested when
you sleep your autonomic nervous system

8214
02:19:05,509 --> 02:19:05,519
you sleep your autonomic nervous system
 

8215
02:19:05,519 --> 02:19:07,110
you sleep your autonomic nervous system
that adjusts states of alertness and

8216
02:19:07,110 --> 02:19:07,120
that adjusts states of alertness and
 

8217
02:19:07,120 --> 02:19:09,270
that adjusts states of alertness and
focus and calm works better than when

8218
02:19:09,270 --> 02:19:09,280
focus and calm works better than when
 

8219
02:19:09,280 --> 02:19:10,950
focus and calm works better than when
you're sleep deprived so if you're

8220
02:19:10,950 --> 02:19:10,960
you're sleep deprived so if you're
 

8221
02:19:10,960 --> 02:19:12,230
you're sleep deprived so if you're
sleeping better you're going to focus

8222
02:19:12,230 --> 02:19:12,240
sleeping better you're going to focus
 

8223
02:19:12,240 --> 02:19:14,790
sleeping better you're going to focus
better so i always answer this way

8224
02:19:14,790 --> 02:19:14,800
better so i always answer this way
 

8225
02:19:14,800 --> 02:19:16,709
better so i always answer this way
to a question like this because

02:19:18,469 --> 02:19:18,479
the best thing that anyone can do for
 

8229
02:19:18,479 --> 02:19:19,990
the best thing that anyone can do for
their mental health physical health and

02:19:40,469 --> 02:19:40,479
it's very clear that mental focus
 

8255
02:19:40,479 --> 02:19:42,549
it's very clear that mental focus
follows visual focus provided that

to do this braille readers have trouble

8342
02:21:06,950 --> 02:21:06,960
to do this braille readers have trouble
 

8343
02:21:06,960 --> 02:21:08,950
to do this braille readers have trouble
focusing sometimes because they feel

8344
02:21:08,950 --> 02:21:08,960
focusing sometimes because they feel
 

8345
02:21:08,960 --> 02:21:11,670
focusing sometimes because they feel
other stuff and they hear other stuff

other stuff and they hear other stuff
 

8347
02:21:11,680 --> 02:21:13,910
other stuff and they hear other stuff
so you you learn to adjust that aperture

8348
02:21:13,910 --> 02:21:13,920
so you you learn to adjust that aperture
 

8349
02:21:13,920 --> 02:21:15,030
so you you learn to adjust that aperture
consciously

8350
02:21:15,030 --> 02:21:15,040
consciously
 

8351
02:21:15,040 --> 02:21:16,630
consciously
and then of course the pharmacologic

8352
02:21:16,630 --> 02:21:16,640
and then of course the pharmacologic
 

8353
02:21:16,640 --> 02:21:19,270
and then of course the pharmacologic
tools just enough caffeine but not too

we've talked about white noise brown

8358
02:21:21,990 --> 02:21:22,000
we've talked about white noise brown

02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,550
we've talked about white noise brown
noise music or no music really varies

8360
02:21:24,550 --> 02:21:24,560
noise music or no music really varies
 

8361
02:21:24,560 --> 02:21:27,110
noise music or no music really varies
but it's very clear that binaural beats

8362
02:21:27,110 --> 02:21:27,120
but it's very clear that binaural beats
 

8363
02:21:27,120 --> 02:21:28,790
but it's very clear that binaural beats
of 40 hertz

8364
02:21:28,790 --> 02:21:28,800
of 40 hertz
 

8365
02:21:28,800 --> 02:21:30,950
of 40 hertz
can shift the brain into a heightened

8366
02:21:30,950 --> 02:21:30,960
can shift the brain into a heightened
 

8367
02:21:30,960 --> 02:21:32,710
can shift the brain into a heightened
state of focus and cognition so if

8368
02:21:32,710 --> 02:21:32,720
state of focus and cognition so if
 

8369
02:21:32,720 --> 02:21:34,070
state of focus and cognition so if
you're going to use binaural beats which

8370
02:21:34,070 --> 02:21:34,080
you're going to use binaural beats which
 

8371
02:21:34,080 --> 02:21:35,670
you're going to use binaural beats which
should definitely be used with

8372
02:21:35,670 --> 02:21:35,680
should definitely be used with
 

8373
02:21:35,680 --> 02:21:36,950
should definitely be used with
headphones

8374
02:21:36,950 --> 02:21:36,960
headphones
 

8375
02:21:36,960 --> 02:21:38,150
headphones
and there are a number of free apps out

8376
02:21:38,150 --> 02:21:38,160
and there are a number of free apps out
 

8377
02:21:38,160 --> 02:21:41,750
and there are a number of free apps out
there in sources uh 40 hertz seems to be

frequency that
 

8383
02:21:44,160 --> 02:21:45,990
frequency that
best supports the brain shifting into a

binaural beats yeah so you're going to

8388
02:21:50,309 --> 02:21:50,319
binaural beats yeah so you're going to
 

8389
02:21:50,319 --> 02:21:52,630
binaural beats yeah so you're going to
look for you'd want to find a

there are other frequencies that are
 

8403
02:22:05,520 --> 02:22:07,910
there are other frequencies that are
interesting but 40 hertz binaural beat

8404
02:22:07,910 --> 02:22:07,920
interesting but 40 hertz binaural beat
 

8405
02:22:07,920 --> 02:22:09,590
interesting but 40 hertz binaural beat
seems to be the one that there's the

8406
02:22:09,590 --> 02:22:09,600
seems to be the one that there's the
 

8407
02:22:09,600 --> 02:22:11,830
seems to be the one that there's the
most quality research on so it's like

8408
02:22:11,830 --> 02:22:11,840
most quality research on so it's like
 

8409
02:22:11,840 --> 02:22:14,070
most quality research on so it's like
it's like a b yeah oh yeah yeah but

8410
02:22:14,070 --> 02:22:14,080
it's like a b yeah oh yeah yeah but
 

8411
02:22:14,080 --> 02:22:15,830
it's like a b yeah oh yeah yeah but
you're saying there's a lot of mixed

8412
02:22:15,830 --> 02:22:15,840
you're saying there's a lot of mixed
 

8413
02:22:15,840 --> 02:22:17,510
you're saying there's a lot of mixed
science on the on the

8414
02:22:17,510 --> 02:22:17,520
science on the on the
 

8415
02:22:17,520 --> 02:22:19,270
science on the on the
yeah brought white noise and brightness

8416
02:22:19,270 --> 02:22:19,280
yeah brought white noise and brightness
 

8417
02:22:19,280 --> 02:22:20,790
yeah brought white noise and brightness
you really should be doing this with

8418
02:22:20,790 --> 02:22:20,800
you really should be doing this with
 

8419
02:22:20,800 --> 02:22:22,389
you really should be doing this with
headphones because binaural beats are

8420
02:22:22,389 --> 02:22:22,399
headphones because binaural beats are
 

8421
02:22:22,399 --> 02:22:23,910
headphones because binaural beats are
best accomplished by feeding two

8422
02:22:23,910 --> 02:22:23,920
best accomplished by feeding two
 

8423
02:22:23,920 --> 02:22:26,070
best accomplished by feeding two
different frequencies to the two ears

8424
02:22:26,070 --> 02:22:26,080
different frequencies to the two ears
 

8425
02:22:26,080 --> 02:22:27,349
different frequencies to the two ears
and then you have what's called the this

8426
02:22:27,349 --> 02:22:27,359
and then you have what's called the this
 

8427
02:22:27,359 --> 02:22:28,710
and then you have what's called the this
brain stem area that reads out what are

8428
02:22:28,710 --> 02:22:28,720
brain stem area that reads out what are
 

8429
02:22:28,720 --> 02:22:30,150
brain stem area that reads out what are
called interaural time differences and

8430
02:22:30,150 --> 02:22:30,160
called interaural time differences and
 

8431
02:22:30,160 --> 02:22:32,469
called interaural time differences and
then it extracts the the the delta

8432
02:22:32,469 --> 02:22:32,479
then it extracts the the the delta
 

8433
02:22:32,479 --> 02:22:39,270
then it extracts the the the delta
essentially turn

8434
02:22:39,270 --> 02:22:39,280

 

8435
02:22:39,280 --> 02:22:40,550

and then in other things that can

8436
02:22:40,550 --> 02:22:40,560
and then in other things that can
 

8437
02:22:40,560 --> 02:22:42,070
and then in other things that can
enhance focus so you know the

8438
02:22:42,070 --> 02:22:42,080
enhance focus so you know the
 

8439
02:22:42,080 --> 02:22:43,510
enhance focus so you know the
pharmacology around this is pretty

8440
02:22:43,510 --> 02:22:43,520
pharmacology around this is pretty
 

8441
02:22:43,520 --> 02:22:44,710
pharmacology around this is pretty
interesting things that tickle the

8442
02:22:44,710 --> 02:22:44,720
interesting things that tickle the
 

8443
02:22:44,720 --> 02:22:46,389
interesting things that tickle the
dopamine pathway and acetylcholine by

8444
02:22:46,389 --> 02:22:46,399
dopamine pathway and acetylcholine by
 

8445
02:22:46,399 --> 02:22:49,030
dopamine pathway and acetylcholine by
the way they work yeah um there's your

8446
02:22:49,030 --> 02:22:49,040
the way they work yeah um there's your
 

8447
02:22:49,040 --> 02:22:50,790
the way they work yeah um there's your
ritalin your adderalls your modafinils

8448
02:22:50,790 --> 02:22:50,800
ritalin your adderalls your modafinils
 

8449
02:22:50,800 --> 02:22:52,230
ritalin your adderalls your modafinils
which are prescription and there's a lot

8450
02:22:52,230 --> 02:22:52,240
which are prescription and there's a lot
 

8451
02:22:52,240 --> 02:22:52,870
which are prescription and there's a lot

non-prescription use of those
 

8455
02:22:54,319 --> 02:22:56,389
non-prescription use of those
prescription drugs not so much in my

ritalin adderall use

8466
02:23:06,870 --> 02:23:06,880
ritalin adderall use
 

8467
02:23:06,880 --> 02:23:08,469
ritalin adderall use
i think that unless it's prescribed by a

8468
02:23:08,469 --> 02:23:08,479
i think that unless it's prescribed by a
 

8469

8493
02:23:33,840 --> 02:23:35,830

it's going to taper off and you have to
 

8495
02:23:35,840 --> 02:23:38,070
it's going to taper off and you have to
just recognize that and then there's

8496
02:23:38,070 --> 02:23:38,080
just recognize that and then there's
 

8497
02:23:38,080 --> 02:23:39,830
just recognize that and then there's

think it's called the brain is a time

8688
02:26:52,550 --> 02:26:52,560
think it's called the brain is a time
 

8689
02:26:52,560 --> 02:26:55,110
think it's called the brain is a time
machine that talks about this expansion

8690
02:26:55,110 --> 02:26:55,120
machine that talks about this expansion
 

8691
02:26:55,120 --> 02:26:57,349

what you can do to leverage it for work

8694
02:26:59,270 --> 02:26:59,280
what you can do to leverage it for work
 

8695
02:26:59,280 --> 02:27:01,190
what you can do to leverage it for work
and creativity focus and so on yeah it's

8696
02:27:01,190 --> 02:27:01,200
and creativity focus and so on yeah it's
 

8697
02:27:01,200 --> 02:27:03,830
and creativity focus and so on yeah it's
fascinating that i think one way to

8698
02:27:03,830 --> 02:27:03,840
fascinating that i think one way to
 

8699
02:27:03,840 --> 02:27:05,990
fascinating that i think one way to
define focus for me is

8700
02:27:05,990 --> 02:27:06,000
define focus for me is
 

8701
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,389
define focus for me is
uh to the experience the feeling of

8702
02:27:08,389 --> 02:27:08,399
uh to the experience the feeling of
 

8703
02:27:08,399 --> 02:27:11,429
uh to the experience the feeling of
focus is losing track of time

8704
02:27:11,429 --> 02:27:11,439
focus is losing track of time
 

8705
02:27:11,439 --> 02:27:13,429

well and you mentioned being you know

8712
02:27:19,349 --> 02:27:19,359
well and you mentioned being you know
 

8713
02:27:19,359 --> 02:27:21,830

kind of uh cramming for for something
 

8715
02:27:21,840 --> 02:27:24,070
kind of uh cramming for for something
well you'll release a lot of adrenaline

after four hours you're probably okay
 

9463
02:40:14,479 --> 02:40:16,230
after four hours you're probably okay
but if you can do it a different day or

little bit surprising was it surprising
 

9489
02:40:35,520 --> 02:40:37,750

to you absolutely because i actually the

cold was i hear that getting into an ice

9497
02:40:42,880 --> 02:40:44,309

02:40:44,309 --> 02:40:44,319
training can reduce hypertrophy but i'm
 

9499
02:40:44,319 --> 02:40:45,670
training can reduce hypertrophy but i'm
guessing it's not that big of a deal and

02:40:45,670 --> 02:40:45,680
guessing it's not that big of a deal and
 

9501
02:40:45,680 --> 02:40:47,269
guessing it's not that big of a deal and
he said no it is a big deal it will

he said no it is a big deal it will
 

9503
02:40:47,279 --> 02:40:49,110

weight and do curls with this and you're
you are in pain and the muscles are

9672
02:43:37,750 --> 02:43:37,760
you are in pain and the muscles are
 

9673
02:43:37,760 --> 02:43:39,110
you are in pain and the muscles are
swelling up with blood it does lead to

9674
02:43:39,110 --> 02:43:39,120
swelling up with blood it does lead to
 

9675
02:43:39,120 --> 02:43:41,110
swelling up with blood it does lead to
hypertrophy but

9676
02:43:41,110 --> 02:43:41,120
hypertrophy but
 

9677
02:43:41,120 --> 02:43:43,269
hypertrophy but
in general you're not sore you're not

9678
02:43:43,269 --> 02:43:43,279
in general you're not sore you're not
 

9679
02:43:43,279 --> 02:43:45,349
in general you're not sore you're not
doing tissue damage and by the way don't

9680
02:43:45,349 --> 02:43:45,359
doing tissue damage and by the way don't
 

9681
02:43:45,359 --> 02:43:46,710
doing tissue damage and by the way don't
just turn the kid off a muscle because

9682
02:43:46,710 --> 02:43:46,720
just turn the kid off a muscle because
 

9683
02:43:46,720 --> 02:43:48,630
just turn the kid off a muscle because
you have to use the proper cuffs um

9684
02:43:48,630 --> 02:43:48,640
you have to use the proper cuffs um
 

9685
02:43:48,640 --> 02:43:49,990
you have to use the proper cuffs um
because you need the blood still to flow

9686
02:43:49,990 --> 02:43:50,000
because you need the blood still to flow
 

9687
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:51,670
because you need the blood still to flow
in one direction you can't just cinch it

9688
02:43:51,670 --> 02:43:51,680
in one direction you can't just cinch it
 

9689
02:43:51,680 --> 02:43:53,670
in one direction you can't just cinch it
off or you'll potentially kill yourself

9690
02:43:53,670 --> 02:43:53,680
off or you'll potentially kill yourself
 

9691
02:43:53,680 --> 02:43:56,710
off or you'll potentially kill yourself
if you um get a clot or you do it wrong

9692
02:43:56,710 --> 02:43:56,720
if you um get a clot or you do it wrong
 

9693
02:43:56,720 --> 02:43:58,630
if you um get a clot or you do it wrong
so get the appropriate cuffs they're out

9694
02:43:58,630 --> 02:43:58,640
so get the appropriate cuffs they're out
 

9695
02:43:58,640 --> 02:43:59,349
so get the appropriate cuffs they're out
there

9696
02:43:59,349 --> 02:43:59,359
there
 

9697
02:43:59,359 --> 02:44:00,710
there
and then for endurance i learned

9698
02:44:00,710 --> 02:44:00,720
and then for endurance i learned
 

9699
02:44:00,720 --> 02:44:02,469
and then for endurance i learned
something really cool so i i work out

9700

andy informed me that to build endurance
 

9717
02:44:18,800 --> 02:44:20,630
andy informed me that to build endurance
while building strength and maintaining

line i finally got tsc but that's for

9766
02:45:09,110 --> 02:45:09,120
line i finally got tsc but that's for
 

9767
02:45:09,120 --> 02:45:11,269
line i finally got tsc but that's for
better that's for extending endurance

9768
02:45:11,269 --> 02:45:11,279
better that's for extending endurance
 

9769
02:45:11,279 --> 02:45:13,429
better that's for extending endurance
that's for yeah it actually has some

9770
02:45:13,429 --> 02:45:13,439
that's for yeah it actually has some
 

9771
02:45:13,439 --> 02:45:15,269
that's for yeah it actually has some
carryover effects on endurance if you're

9772
02:45:15,269 --> 02:45:15,279
carryover effects on endurance if you're
 

9773
02:45:15,279 --> 02:45:16,630
carryover effects on endurance if you're
doing the other stuff and then he also

9774
02:45:16,630 --> 02:45:16,640
doing the other stuff and then he also
 

9775
02:45:16,640 --> 02:45:18,150
doing the other stuff and then he also
said one day a week to do this workout

9776
02:45:18,150 --> 02:45:18,160
said one day a week to do this workout
 

9777
02:45:18,160 --> 02:45:19,429
said one day a week to do this workout
and i haven't done it yet maybe we do it

9778
02:45:19,429 --> 02:45:19,439
and i haven't done it yet maybe we do it
 

9779
02:45:19,439 --> 02:45:22,070
and i haven't done it yet maybe we do it
tomorrow it'd be fun which is you run a

9780
02:45:22,070 --> 02:45:22,080
tomorrow it'd be fun which is you run a
 

9781
02:45:22,080 --> 02:45:24,150
tomorrow it'd be fun which is you run a
mile

9782
02:45:24,150 --> 02:45:24,160
mile
 

9783
02:45:24,160 --> 02:45:25,030
mile
you

9784
02:45:25,030 --> 02:45:25,040
you
 

9785
02:45:25,040 --> 02:45:26,309
you
ask yourself how long did that take

9786
02:45:26,309 --> 02:45:26,319
ask yourself how long did that take
 

9787
02:45:26,319 --> 02:45:28,389
ask yourself how long did that take
let's say it took eight minutes

9788
02:45:28,389 --> 02:45:28,399
let's say it took eight minutes
 

9789
02:45:28,399 --> 02:45:30,550
let's say it took eight minutes
then you walk or rest for eight minutes

9790
02:45:30,550 --> 02:45:30,560
then you walk or rest for eight minutes
 

9791
02:45:30,560 --> 02:45:32,309
then you walk or rest for eight minutes
then you run another mile

9792
02:45:32,309 --> 02:45:32,319
then you run another mile
 

9793
02:45:32,319 --> 02:45:33,990
then you run another mile
as fast as you can and then you rest for

9794
02:45:33,990 --> 02:45:34,000
as fast as you can and then you rest for
 

9795
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:35,590
as fast as you can and then you rest for
the equivalent period and you do that

9796
02:45:35,590 --> 02:45:35,600
the equivalent period and you do that
 

9797
02:45:35,600 --> 02:45:38,870
the equivalent period and you do that
one to three times once per week so

9798
02:45:38,870 --> 02:45:38,880
one to three times once per week so
 

9799
02:45:38,880 --> 02:45:41,510
one to three times once per week so
and so as an all-around fitness program

9800
02:45:41,510 --> 02:45:41,520
and so as an all-around fitness program
 

9801
02:45:41,520 --> 02:45:43,429
and so as an all-around fitness program
it make you could collapse this into

9802
02:45:43,429 --> 02:45:43,439
it make you could collapse this into
 

9803
02:45:43,439 --> 02:45:44,790
it make you could collapse this into
something where you say okay you can

9804
02:45:44,790 --> 02:45:44,800
something where you say okay you can
 

9805
02:45:44,800 --> 02:45:46,550
something where you say okay you can
work out with the weights for about an

9806
02:45:46,550 --> 02:45:46,560
work out with the weights for about an
 

9807
02:45:46,560 --> 02:45:48,710
work out with the weights for about an
hour every other day maybe take two days

9808
02:45:48,710 --> 02:45:48,720
hour every other day maybe take two days
 

9809
02:45:48,720 --> 02:45:49,990
hour every other day maybe take two days
off every once well maybe not you're

9810
02:45:49,990 --> 02:45:50,000
off every once well maybe not you're
 

9811
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:51,190
off every once well maybe not you're
going to do

9812
02:45:51,190 --> 02:45:51,200
going to do
 

9813
02:45:51,200 --> 02:45:53,990
going to do
6 to 15 repetitions you're going to push

9814
02:45:53,990 --> 02:45:54,000
6 to 15 repetitions you're going to push
 

9815
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:55,910
6 to 15 repetitions you're going to push
to failure on some of those not all

9816
02:45:55,910 --> 02:45:55,920
to failure on some of those not all
 

9817
02:45:55,920 --> 02:45:57,429
to failure on some of those not all
because some of those are designed to

9818
02:45:57,429 --> 02:45:57,439
because some of those are designed to
 

9819
02:45:57,439 --> 02:45:59,110
because some of those are designed to
build more strength you're not going to

9820
02:45:59,110 --> 02:45:59,120
build more strength you're not going to
 

9821
02:45:59,120 --> 02:46:00,630
build more strength you're not going to
failure and heavier some are designed

9822
02:46:00,630 --> 02:46:00,640
failure and heavier some are designed
 

9823
02:46:00,640 --> 02:46:03,269
failure and heavier some are designed
for hypertrophy higher rep and going to

9824
02:46:03,269 --> 02:46:03,279
for hypertrophy higher rep and going to
 

9825
02:46:03,279 --> 02:46:04,950
for hypertrophy higher rep and going to
failure and then on off days you're

know leaving a lung in the terminal so
 

9881
02:47:01,359 --> 02:47:03,429
know leaving a lung in the terminal so
it's like functional stuff like your

02:47:03,429 --> 02:47:03,439
it's like functional stuff like your
 

9883
02:47:03,439 --> 02:47:05,670
it's like functional stuff like your
life going up the stairs is easier yeah

life going up the stairs is easier yeah
 

9885
02:47:05,680 --> 02:47:07,269
life going up the stairs is easier yeah
moving about yeah look kind of just

9886
02:47:07,269 --> 02:47:07,279
moving about yeah look kind of just
 

9887
02:47:07,279 --> 02:47:08,870
moving about yeah look kind of just
regular yeah and i should mention that

9888
02:47:08,870 --> 02:47:08,880
regular yeah and i should mention that
 

9889
02:47:08,880 --> 02:47:11,269
regular yeah and i should mention that
cold showers after

9890
02:47:11,269 --> 02:47:11,279
cold showers after
 

9891
02:47:11,279 --> 02:47:14,790
cold showers after
training don't seem to short-circuit the

9892
02:47:14,790 --> 02:47:14,800
training don't seem to short-circuit the
 

9893
02:47:14,800 --> 02:47:15,990
training don't seem to short-circuit the
um

9894
02:47:15,990 --> 02:47:16,000
um
 

9895
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:17,750
um
the training effect to the same extent

9896
02:47:17,750 --> 02:47:17,760
the training effect to the same extent
 

9897
02:47:17,760 --> 02:47:19,670
the training effect to the same extent
that immersion in cold water does and

9898
02:47:19,670 --> 02:47:19,680
that immersion in cold water does and
 

9899
02:47:19,680 --> 02:47:21,110
that immersion in cold water does and
that really speaks to the fact that cold

9900
02:47:21,110 --> 02:47:21,120
that really speaks to the fact that cold
 

9901
02:47:21,120 --> 02:47:22,469
that really speaks to the fact that cold
showers even though they can provide

9902
02:47:22,469 --> 02:47:22,479
showers even though they can provide
 

9903
02:47:22,479 --> 02:47:24,230
showers even though they can provide
some of the adrenaline for the mental

9904
02:47:24,230 --> 02:47:24,240
some of the adrenaline for the mental
 

9905
02:47:24,240 --> 02:47:25,510
some of the adrenaline for the mental
effects of like oh i have a lot of

9906
02:47:25,510 --> 02:47:25,520
effects of like oh i have a lot of
 

9907
02:47:25,520 --> 02:47:26,710
effects of like oh i have a lot of
adrenaline in my system from a cold

9908
02:47:26,710 --> 02:47:26,720
adrenaline in my system from a cold
 

9909
02:47:26,720 --> 02:47:28,389
adrenaline in my system from a cold
shower and i can remain calm there's

9910
02:47:28,389 --> 02:47:28,399
shower and i can remain calm there's
 

9911
02:47:28,399 --> 02:47:29,990
shower and i can remain calm there's
utility to that

9912
02:47:29,990 --> 02:47:30,000
utility to that
 

9913
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:31,590
utility to that
it's not going to have the same

9914
02:47:31,590 --> 02:47:31,600
it's not going to have the same
 

9915
02:47:31,600 --> 02:47:33,590
it's not going to have the same
metabolic effects or other positive

9916
02:47:33,590 --> 02:47:33,600
metabolic effects or other positive
 

9917
02:47:33,600 --> 02:47:35,110
metabolic effects or other positive
effects that cold water exposure has

9918
02:47:35,110 --> 02:47:35,120
effects that cold water exposure has
 

9919
02:47:35,120 --> 02:47:36,469
effects that cold water exposure has
been shown to have

9920
02:47:36,469 --> 02:47:36,479
been shown to have
 

9921
02:47:36,479 --> 02:47:37,349
been shown to have
and

9922
02:47:37,349 --> 02:47:37,359
and
 

9923
02:47:37,359 --> 02:47:38,870
and
that's unfortunate because most people

9924
02:47:38,870 --> 02:47:38,880
that's unfortunate because most people
 

9925
02:47:38,880 --> 02:47:40,469
that's unfortunate because most people
have access to cold showers not everyone

9926
02:47:40,469 --> 02:47:40,479
have access to cold showers not everyone
 

9927
02:47:40,479 --> 02:47:42,070
have access to cold showers not everyone
has access to a cold dunk or a nice

what is this what's the big deal exactly

9954
02:48:06,150 --> 02:48:06,160
what is this what's the big deal exactly
 

9955
02:48:06,160 --> 02:48:08,389
what is this what's the big deal exactly
or people pay for this

9956
02:48:08,389 --> 02:48:08,399
or people pay for this

the snow yeah
 

9965
02:48:17,520 --> 02:48:19,590
the snow yeah
because in russia they actually did this

9966
02:48:19,590 --> 02:48:19,600
because in russia they actually did this
 

9967
02:48:19,600 --> 02:48:21,190
because in russia they actually did this
for a long time they thought that it

9968
02:48:21,190 --> 02:48:21,200
for a long time they thought that it
 

9969
02:48:21,200 --> 02:48:22,550
for a long time they thought that it
would and indeed it does build the

9970
02:48:22,550 --> 02:48:22,560
would and indeed it does build the
 

9971
02:48:22,560 --> 02:48:24,950
would and indeed it does build the
immune system to expose babies to the

9972
02:48:24,950 --> 02:48:24,960
immune system to expose babies to the
 

9973
02:48:24,960 --> 02:48:26,950
immune system to expose babies to the
cold i don't i still don't know where

9974
02:48:26,950 --> 02:48:26,960
cold i don't i still don't know where
 

9975
02:48:26,960 --> 02:48:28,630
cold i don't i still don't know where
you got that photo and you were able to

9976
02:48:28,630 --> 02:48:28,640
you got that photo and you were able to
 

9977
02:48:28,640 --> 02:48:30,389
you got that photo and you were able to
find exactly the right it was it was

9978
02:48:30,389 --> 02:48:30,399
find exactly the right it was it was
 

9979
02:48:30,399 --> 02:48:31,349
find exactly the right it was it was
great

9980
02:48:31,349 --> 02:48:31,359
great

but
it's very clear that what you need is

10186
02:51:56,309 --> 02:51:56,319
it's very clear that what you need is
 

10187
02:51:56,319 --> 02:51:57,429
it's very clear that what you need is
the release of something called

10188
02:51:57,429 --> 02:51:57,439
the release of something called
 

10189
02:51:57,439 --> 02:52:00,070
the release of something called
dinorphin we have endorphin which makes

10190
02:52:00,070 --> 02:52:00,080
dinorphin we have endorphin which makes
 

10191
02:52:00,080 --> 02:52:02,710
dinorphin we have endorphin which makes
us feel good it binds to these mu opioid

10192
02:52:02,710 --> 02:52:02,720
us feel good it binds to these mu opioid
 

10193
02:52:02,720 --> 02:52:05,429
us feel good it binds to these mu opioid
receptors in the body you have dinorphin

10194
02:52:05,429 --> 02:52:05,439
receptors in the body you have dinorphin
 

10195
02:52:05,439 --> 02:52:07,269
receptors in the body you have dinorphin
which is the terrible feeling that you

10196
02:52:07,269 --> 02:52:07,279
which is the terrible feeling that you
 

10197
02:52:07,279 --> 02:52:08,469
which is the terrible feeling that you
get when you're in really hot

10198
02:52:08,469 --> 02:52:08,479
get when you're in really hot
 

10199
02:52:08,479 --> 02:52:10,309
get when you're in really hot
temperatures it's also the terrible

10200
02:52:10,309 --> 02:52:10,319
temperatures it's also the terrible
 

10201
02:52:10,319 --> 02:52:12,550
temperatures it's also the terrible
effect that alcoholics feel when they

10202
02:52:12,550 --> 02:52:12,560
effect that alcoholics feel when they
 

10203
02:52:12,560 --> 02:52:15,110
effect that alcoholics feel when they
are in withdrawal you feel agitated you

10204
02:52:15,110 --> 02:52:15,120
are in withdrawal you feel agitated you

it's dinorphin binding to the so-called

10208
02:52:18,469 --> 02:52:18,479
it's dinorphin binding to the so-called
 

10209
02:52:18,479 --> 02:52:21,030
it's dinorphin binding to the so-called
kappa opioid receptor is that's what

10210
02:52:21,030 --> 02:52:21,040
kappa opioid receptor is that's what
 

10211
02:52:21,040 --> 02:52:22,790
kappa opioid receptor is that's what
you're trying to trigger when you do

10212
02:52:22,790 --> 02:52:22,800
you're trying to trigger when you do
 

10213
02:52:22,800 --> 02:52:24,469
you're trying to trigger when you do
that a number of things happen you set

10214
02:52:24,469 --> 02:52:24,479
that a number of things happen you set
 

10215
02:52:24,479 --> 02:52:26,950
that a number of things happen you set
off heat shock proteins that go repair

10216
02:52:26,950 --> 02:52:26,960
off heat shock proteins that go repair
 

10217
02:52:26,960 --> 02:52:29,590
off heat shock proteins that go repair
broken proteins and misfolded proteins

10218
02:52:29,590 --> 02:52:29,600
broken proteins and misfolded proteins
 

10219
02:52:29,600 --> 02:52:32,550
broken proteins and misfolded proteins
it also makes it so that later endorphin

10220
02:52:32,550 --> 02:52:32,560
it also makes it so that later endorphin
 

10221
02:52:32,560 --> 02:52:34,710
it also makes it so that later endorphin
binds its receptor more strongly so when

10222
02:52:34,710 --> 02:52:34,720
binds its receptor more strongly so when
 

10223
02:52:34,720 --> 02:52:35,750
binds its receptor more strongly so when
you have this

10224
02:52:35,750 --> 02:52:35,760
you have this
 

10225
02:52:35,760 --> 02:52:38,070
you have this
uncomfortable experience in the heat

10226
02:52:38,070 --> 02:52:38,080
uncomfortable experience in the heat
 

10227
02:52:38,080 --> 02:52:40,309
uncomfortable experience in the heat
you literally feel better in real life

02:58:40,070 --> 02:58:40,080
doing ice and heat for whatever reason
 

10593
02:58:40,080 --> 02:58:41,510
doing ice and heat for whatever reason
it doesn't matter if you end on heat or

10594
02:58:41,510 --> 02:58:41,520
it doesn't matter if you end on heat or
 

10595
02:58:41,520 --> 02:58:43,429
it doesn't matter if you end on heat or
cold but if you're using cold

10596
02:58:43,429 --> 02:58:43,439
cold but if you're using cold
 

10597
02:58:43,439 --> 02:58:45,269
cold but if you're using cold
specifically to stimulate an increase in

10598
02:58:45,269 --> 02:58:45,279
specifically to stimulate an increase in
 

10599
02:58:45,279 --> 02:58:46,389
specifically to stimulate an increase in
metabolism

10600
02:58:46,389 --> 02:58:46,399
metabolism
 

10601
02:58:46,399 --> 02:58:48,630
metabolism
end with cold that's the sobering

10602
02:58:48,630 --> 02:58:48,640
end with cold that's the sobering
 

10603
02:58:48,640 --> 02:58:49,830
end with cold that's the sobering
principle

10604
02:58:49,830 --> 02:58:49,840
principle
 

10605
02:58:49,840 --> 02:58:52,230
principle
and with cold yeah if you're alternating

10606
02:58:52,230 --> 02:58:52,240
and with cold yeah if you're alternating
 

10607
02:58:52,240 --> 02:58:54,550
and with cold yeah if you're alternating
and then uh if you want to do the tough

10608
02:58:54,550 --> 02:58:54,560
and then uh if you want to do the tough
 

10609
02:58:54,560 --> 02:58:57,190
and then uh if you want to do the tough
way you let the shivering so you just

10610
02:58:57,190 --> 02:58:57,200
way you let the shivering so you just
 

10611
02:58:57,200 --> 02:58:59,110
way you let the shivering so you just
stand out and let the water evaporate

10612
02:58:59,110 --> 02:58:59,120
stand out and let the water evaporate
 

10613
02:58:59,120 --> 02:59:00,469
stand out and let the water evaporate
yeah i mean if you ever waded into a

10614
02:59:00,469 --> 02:59:00,479
yeah i mean if you ever waded into a
 

10615
02:59:00,479 --> 02:59:02,469
yeah i mean if you ever waded into a
cold ocean you know everybody's kind of

10616
02:59:02,469 --> 02:59:02,479
cold ocean you know everybody's kind of
 

10617
02:59:02,479 --> 02:59:04,309
cold ocean you know everybody's kind of
like holding themselves you know if you

10618
02:59:04,309 --> 02:59:04,319
like holding themselves you know if you
 

10619
02:59:04,319 --> 02:59:06,309
like holding themselves you know if you
really just if you let yourself extend

10620
02:59:06,309 --> 02:59:06,319
really just if you let yourself extend
 

10621
02:59:06,319 --> 02:59:07,750
really just if you let yourself extend
your limbs and move them around a bit so

10622
02:59:07,750 --> 02:59:07,760
your limbs and move them around a bit so
 

10623
02:59:07,760 --> 02:59:09,750
your limbs and move them around a bit so
you break up that thermal layer

10624
02:59:09,750 --> 02:59:09,760
you break up that thermal layer
 

10625
02:59:09,760 --> 02:59:11,910
you break up that thermal layer
uh that's that's the tough way to do it

10626
02:59:11,910 --> 02:59:11,920
uh that's that's the tough way to do it

orgasm is actually the consequence of
 

10769
03:01:36,399 --> 03:01:37,830

the parasympathetic the calming aspect
 

10781
03:01:49,120 --> 03:01:51,429
the parasympathetic the calming aspect
of the of of the autonomy that's

03:01:51,429 --> 03:01:51,439
of the of of the autonomy that's
 

10783
03:01:51,439 --> 03:01:52,790
of the of of the autonomy that's
counterintuitive right it's

10784
03:01:52,790 --> 03:01:52,800
counterintuitive right it's
 

10785
03:01:52,800 --> 03:01:54,230
counterintuitive right it's
counterintuitive and it kind of works

10786

like a seesaw i mean there's arousal

10788
03:01:55,830 --> 03:01:55,840
like a seesaw i mean there's arousal
 

10789
03:01:55,840 --> 03:01:57,030
like a seesaw i mean there's arousal
then there's relaxation then there's

10790
03:01:57,030 --> 03:01:57,040
then there's relaxation then there's
 

10791
03:01:57,040 --> 03:01:58,389
then there's relaxation then there's
arousal but the

10792
03:01:58,389 --> 03:01:58,399
arousal but the
 

10793
03:01:58,399 --> 03:02:00,309
arousal but the
um and then immediately after

10794
03:02:00,309 --> 03:02:00,319
um and then immediately after
 

10795
03:02:00,319 --> 03:02:01,510
um and then immediately after
orgasm

10796
03:02:01,510 --> 03:02:01,520
orgasm
 

10797
03:02:01,520 --> 03:02:03,190
orgasm
and in males ejaculation what ends up

10798
03:02:03,190 --> 03:02:03,200
and in males ejaculation what ends up
 

10799
03:02:03,200 --> 03:02:05,670
and in males ejaculation what ends up
happening is there's a rebounding of the

10800
03:02:05,670 --> 03:02:05,680
happening is there's a rebounding of the
 

10801
03:02:05,680 --> 03:02:07,190
happening is there's a rebounding of the
parasympathetic nervous system which it

10802
03:02:07,190 --> 03:02:07,200
parasympathetic nervous system which it
 

10803
03:02:07,200 --> 03:02:09,030
parasympathetic nervous system which it
leads to oftentimes people feeling very

10804
03:02:09,030 --> 03:02:09,040
leads to oftentimes people feeling very
 

10805
03:02:09,040 --> 03:02:11,349
leads to oftentimes people feeling very
relaxed or falling asleep

10806
03:02:11,349 --> 03:02:11,359
relaxed or falling asleep
 

10807
03:02:11,359 --> 03:02:12,230
relaxed or falling asleep
so

10808
03:02:12,230 --> 03:02:12,240
so
 

10809
03:02:12,240 --> 03:02:14,630
so
i'm going to do a short series on sexual

10810

10825
03:02:27,760 --> 03:02:30,309

we went pretty deep into some of the uh
 

10837
03:02:40,640 --> 03:02:42,870
we went pretty deep into some of the uh
typical and unusual dynamics of of

menstrual cycles early on start to talk
 

10863
03:03:05,040 --> 03:03:06,550
menstrual cycles early on start to talk
to one another about changes in

10864
03:03:06,550 --> 03:03:06,560
to one another about changes in
 

10865
03:03:06,560 --> 03:03:08,389
to one another about changes in

of this 28-day cycle that they all

10868
03:03:09,990 --> 03:03:10,000
of this 28-day cycle that they all
 

10869
03:03:10,000 --> 03:03:12,870
of this 28-day cycle that they all
experience sooner or later males there's

10870
03:03:12,870 --> 03:03:12,880
experience sooner or later males there's
 

10871
03:03:12,880 --> 03:03:14,550
experience sooner or later males there's
less of a conversation and it usually

10872
03:03:14,550 --> 03:03:14,560
less of a conversation and it usually
 

10873
03:03:14,560 --> 03:03:16,389
less of a conversation and it usually
arrives in code people say hey what

10874
03:03:16,389 --> 03:03:16,399
arrives in code people say hey what
 

10875
03:03:16,399 --> 03:03:17,349
arrives in code people say hey what
should i take to increase my

10876
03:03:17,349 --> 03:03:17,359
should i take to increase my
 

10877
03:03:17,359 --> 03:03:19,670
should i take to increase my
testosterone and i'll say well maybe

10878
03:03:19,670 --> 03:03:19,680
testosterone and i'll say well maybe
 

10879
03:03:19,680 --> 03:03:21,670

nothing you know
what are you specifically concerned

10882
03:03:23,110 --> 03:03:23,120
what are you specifically concerned
 

10883
03:03:23,120 --> 03:03:24,790
what are you specifically concerned
about and then over time if you pull on

10884
03:03:24,790 --> 03:03:24,800
about and then over time if you pull on
 

10885
03:03:24,800 --> 03:03:27,190
about and then over time if you pull on
those threads a little bit you know you

10886
03:03:27,190 --> 03:03:27,200
those threads a little bit you know you
 

10887
03:03:27,200 --> 03:03:28,950
those threads a little bit you know you
get your answer sometimes i'll just get

10888
03:03:28,950 --> 03:03:28,960
get your answer sometimes i'll just get
 

10889
03:03:28,960 --> 03:03:32,309
get your answer sometimes i'll just get
a direct question um but i think that

10890
03:03:32,309 --> 03:03:32,319
a direct question um but i think that
 

10891
03:03:32,319 --> 03:03:33,990
a direct question um but i think that
the psychology of all this and in terms

10892
03:03:33,990 --> 03:03:34,000
the psychology of all this and in terms
 

10893
03:03:34,000 --> 03:03:36,230
the psychology of all this and in terms
of jealousy and the terms of

03:09:10,319 --> 03:09:12,710
object of your love
like uh it's almost like a

11222
03:09:12,710 --> 03:09:12,720
like uh it's almost like a
 

11223
03:09:12,720 --> 03:09:14,469
like uh it's almost like a
it's like a journey that you take on

11224
03:09:14,469 --> 03:09:14,479
it's like a journey that you take on
 

11225
03:09:14,479 --> 03:09:16,309
it's like a journey that you take on
together because also the interesting

11226
03:09:16,309 --> 03:09:16,319
together because also the interesting
 

11227
03:09:16,319 --> 03:09:17,990
together because also the interesting
thing about humans

11228
03:09:17,990 --> 03:09:18,000
thing about humans
 

11229
03:09:18,000 --> 03:09:19,990
thing about humans
is they're moment by moment a different

11230
03:09:19,990 --> 03:09:20,000
is they're moment by moment a different
 

11231
03:09:20,000 --> 03:09:22,870
is they're moment by moment a different
person day by day week by week month by

11232
03:09:22,870 --> 03:09:22,880
person day by day week by week month by
 

11233
03:09:22,880 --> 03:09:25,110
person day by day week by week month by
month they change they evolve there's an

11234
03:09:25,110 --> 03:09:25,120
month they change they evolve there's an
 

11235
03:09:25,120 --> 03:09:26,790
month they change they evolve there's an
ups and downs and stuff like that so

11236
03:09:26,790 --> 03:09:26,800
ups and downs and stuff like that so
 

11237
03:09:26,800 --> 03:09:28,389
ups and downs and stuff like that so
you're what you're doing is you're

11238
03:09:28,389 --> 03:09:28,399
you're what you're doing is you're
 

11239
03:09:28,399 --> 03:09:31,030
you're what you're doing is you're
saying well i'm going to explore all the

11240
03:09:31,030 --> 03:09:31,040
saying well i'm going to explore all the
 

11241
03:09:31,040 --> 03:09:33,110
saying well i'm going to explore all the
ways that this human gets

11242
03:09:33,110 --> 03:09:33,120
ways that this human gets
 

11243
03:09:33,120 --> 03:09:35,830
ways that this human gets
morphed and changed and the

11244
03:09:35,830 --> 03:09:35,840
morphed and changed and the
 

11245
03:09:35,840 --> 03:09:37,750
morphed and changed and the
what makes them cry what makes them

11246
03:09:37,750 --> 03:09:37,760
what makes them cry what makes them
 

11247
03:09:37,760 --> 03:09:39,750
what makes them cry what makes them
excited what makes them

11248
03:09:39,750 --> 03:09:39,760
excited what makes them
 

11249
03:09:39,760 --> 03:09:41,349
excited what makes them
uh lonely

11250
03:09:41,349 --> 03:09:41,359
uh lonely
 

11251
03:09:41,359 --> 03:09:43,030
uh lonely
uh like the

11252
03:09:43,030 --> 03:09:43,040
uh like the
 

11253
03:09:43,040 --> 03:09:45,429
uh like the
the the habits how like when they form

11254
03:09:45,429 --> 03:09:45,439
the the habits how like when they form
 

11255
03:09:45,439 --> 03:09:47,110
the the habits how like when they form
certain habits what

11256
03:09:47,110 --> 03:09:47,120
certain habits what
 

11257
03:09:47,120 --> 03:09:48,550
certain habits what
how they feel when those habits are

11258
03:09:48,550 --> 03:09:48,560
how they feel when those habits are
 

11259
03:09:48,560 --> 03:09:51,110
how they feel when those habits are
broken like the stupid my new things

11260
03:09:51,110 --> 03:09:51,120
broken like the stupid my new things
 

11261
03:09:51,120 --> 03:09:53,750
broken like the stupid my new things
that make everyday life you're gonna be

11262
03:09:53,750 --> 03:09:53,760
that make everyday life you're gonna be
 

11263
03:09:53,760 --> 03:09:55,190
that make everyday life you're gonna be
on that journey together figuring that

11264
03:09:55,190 --> 03:09:55,200
on that journey together figuring that
 

11265
03:09:55,200 --> 03:09:56,870
on that journey together figuring that
out just the way we're trying to figure

11266
03:09:56,870 --> 03:09:56,880
out just the way we're trying to figure
 

11267
03:09:56,880 --> 03:09:59,429
out just the way we're trying to figure
ourselves out when we're like optimizing

11268
03:09:59,429 --> 03:09:59,439
ourselves out when we're like optimizing
 

11269
03:09:59,439 --> 03:10:01,349
ourselves out when we're like optimizing
these things about diet and health so on

11270
03:10:01,349 --> 03:10:01,359
these things about diet and health so on
 

11271
03:10:01,359 --> 03:10:02,950
these things about diet and health so on
you're kind of doing this

11272
03:10:02,950 --> 03:10:02,960
you're kind of doing this
 

11273
03:10:02,960 --> 03:10:04,790
you're kind of doing this
computation together because neither

11274
03:10:04,790 --> 03:10:04,800
computation together because neither
 

11275
03:10:04,800 --> 03:10:07,349
computation together because neither
person really understands themselves

11276
03:10:07,349 --> 03:10:07,359
person really understands themselves
 

11277
03:10:07,359 --> 03:10:10,150
person really understands themselves
um at all and you're together both

11278
03:10:10,150 --> 03:10:10,160
um at all and you're together both
 

11279
03:10:10,160 --> 03:10:11,670
um at all and you're together both
confused about each other and you get to

11280
03:10:11,670 --> 03:10:11,680
confused about each other and you get to
 

11281
03:10:11,680 --> 03:10:13,830
confused about each other and you get to
almost like um

11282
03:10:13,830 --> 03:10:13,840
almost like um
 

11283
03:10:13,840 --> 03:10:16,550
almost like um
a relationship is a chance

11284
03:10:16,550 --> 03:10:16,560
a relationship is a chance
 

11285
03:10:16,560 --> 03:10:19,110
a relationship is a chance
to understand yourself

11286
03:10:19,110 --> 03:10:19,120
to understand yourself
 

11287
03:10:19,120 --> 03:10:20,229
to understand yourself
and

11288
03:10:20,229 --> 03:10:20,239
and
 

11289
03:10:20,239 --> 03:10:22,469
and
to understand another person

11290
03:10:22,469 --> 03:10:22,479
to understand another person
 

11291
03:10:22,479 --> 03:10:24,150
to understand another person
like together that process is some kind

11292
03:10:24,150 --> 03:10:24,160
like together that process is some kind
 

11293
03:10:24,160 --> 03:10:26,150
like together that process is some kind
of someone iterative you know the

11294
03:10:26,150 --> 03:10:26,160
of someone iterative you know the
 

11295
03:10:26,160 --> 03:10:27,910
of someone iterative you know the
dynamics right i mean you're merging two

11296
03:10:27,910 --> 03:10:27,920
dynamics right i mean you're merging two
 

11297
03:10:27,920 --> 03:10:29,750
dynamics right i mean you're merging two
nervous systems one this was once

11298
03:10:29,750 --> 03:10:29,760
nervous systems one this was once
 

11299
03:10:29,760 --> 03:10:30,870
nervous systems one this was once
described to me very well by an

11300
03:10:30,870 --> 03:10:30,880
described to me very well by an
 

11301
03:10:30,880 --> 03:10:33,030
described to me very well by an
ex-girlfriend um who's

11302
03:10:33,030 --> 03:10:33,040
ex-girlfriend um who's
 

11303
03:10:33,040 --> 03:10:35,510
ex-girlfriend um who's
truly brilliant she's really brilliant

11304
03:10:35,510 --> 03:10:35,520
truly brilliant she's really brilliant
 

11305
03:10:35,520 --> 03:10:36,870
truly brilliant she's really brilliant
um

11306
03:10:36,870 --> 03:10:36,880
um
 

11307
03:10:36,880 --> 03:10:39,349
um
she said you know there's four arrows

11308
03:10:39,349 --> 03:10:39,359
she said you know there's four arrows
 

11309
03:10:39,359 --> 03:10:41,830
she said you know there's four arrows
this is maybe to an engineer or like a

11310
03:10:41,830 --> 03:10:41,840
this is maybe to an engineer or like a
 

11311
03:10:41,840 --> 03:10:43,750
this is maybe to an engineer or like a
so makes sense there's how you feel

11312
03:10:43,750 --> 03:10:43,760
so makes sense there's how you feel
 

11313
03:10:43,760 --> 03:10:45,750
so makes sense there's how you feel
towards the other person yes there's how

11314
03:10:45,750 --> 03:10:45,760
towards the other person yes there's how
 

11315
03:10:45,760 --> 03:10:47,830
towards the other person yes there's how
they feel towards you but then there's

11316
03:10:47,830 --> 03:10:47,840
they feel towards you but then there's
 

11317
03:10:47,840 --> 03:10:49,670
they feel towards you but then there's
an there's an arrow that comes back to

11318
03:10:49,670 --> 03:10:49,680
an there's an arrow that comes back to
 

11319
03:10:49,680 --> 03:10:50,950
an there's an arrow that comes back to
you

11320
03:10:50,950 --> 03:10:50,960
you
 

11321
03:10:50,960 --> 03:10:53,750
you
which is how you feel about how

11322
03:10:53,750 --> 03:10:53,760
which is how you feel about how
 

11323
03:10:53,760 --> 03:10:54,870
which is how you feel about how
they feel

11324
03:10:54,870 --> 03:10:54,880
they feel
 

11325
03:10:54,880 --> 03:10:56,389
they feel
and then they have an arrow of how they

11326
03:10:56,389 --> 03:10:56,399
and then they have an arrow of how they
 

11327
03:10:56,399 --> 03:10:58,070
and then they have an arrow of how they
feel about how you feel right this is

11328
03:10:58,070 --> 03:10:58,080
feel about how you feel right this is
 

11329
03:10:58,080 --> 03:10:59,750
feel about how you feel right this is
why if someone else is moody or somebody

11330
03:10:59,750 --> 03:10:59,760
why if someone else is moody or somebody
 

11331
03:10:59,760 --> 03:11:01,910
why if someone else is moody or somebody
else is upset it

11332
03:11:01,910 --> 03:11:01,920
else is upset it
 

11333
03:11:01,920 --> 03:11:03,349
else is upset it
there's one version of ourselves where

11334
03:11:03,349 --> 03:11:03,359
there's one version of ourselves where
 

11335
03:11:03,359 --> 03:11:06,229
there's one version of ourselves where
we respond to that or they respond to us

11336
03:11:06,229 --> 03:11:06,239
we respond to that or they respond to us
 

11337
03:11:06,239 --> 03:11:08,790
we respond to that or they respond to us
but there's another version where we

11338
03:11:08,790 --> 03:11:08,800
but there's another version where we
 

11339
03:11:08,800 --> 03:11:10,950
but there's another version where we
respond to that but it's also there's a

11340
03:11:10,950 --> 03:11:10,960
respond to that but it's also there's a
 

11341
03:11:10,960 --> 03:11:12,710
respond to that but it's also there's a
processing of what it means for us that

11342
03:11:12,710 --> 03:11:12,720
processing of what it means for us that
 

11343
03:11:12,720 --> 03:11:14,710
processing of what it means for us that
they're behaving that way or feeling

11344
03:11:14,710 --> 03:11:14,720
they're behaving that way or feeling
 

11345
03:11:14,720 --> 03:11:17,030
they're behaving that way or feeling
that way and this again

11346
03:11:17,030 --> 03:11:17,040
that way and this again
 

11347
03:11:17,040 --> 03:11:18,710
that way and this again
leads us back to that early attachment

11348
03:11:18,710 --> 03:11:18,720
leads us back to that early attachment
 

11349
03:11:18,720 --> 03:11:21,190
leads us back to that early attachment

in fact healthy models of parenting say
that children shouldn't actually know

first eight years of their life they're

not the case but maybe the cutoff isn't

11370
03:11:39,190 --> 03:11:39,200
not the case but maybe the cutoff isn't
 

11371
03:11:39,200 --> 03:11:41,670
not the case but maybe the cutoff isn't
exactly eight but you get the idea so

11372
03:11:41,670 --> 03:11:41,680
exactly eight but you get the idea so
 

11373
03:11:41,680 --> 03:11:43,429
exactly eight but you get the idea so
the dynamics of a relationship are where

and then for the other two weeks
 

11613
03:15:49,520 --> 03:15:50,389
and then for the other two weeks
the

11614

the
 

11615
03:15:50,399 --> 03:15:52,469

distancing now i don't think that's
feasible for most people but if you look
