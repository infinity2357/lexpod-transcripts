00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,610
enhance our quality of life and usually
that's linked to something that's

164
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:25,620
that's linked to something that's
 

165
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,710
that's linked to something that's
functional right even if you think of

166
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:27,720
functional right even if you think of
 

167
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,090
functional right even if you think of
self-driving cars why is there a

168
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:29,100
self-driving cars why is there a
 

169
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,949
self-driving cars why is there a
fascination because people really do

170
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:30,959
fascination because people really do
 

171
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,960
fascination because people really do
hate to drive like there's the like

172
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:32,970
hate to drive like there's the like
 

173
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,420
hate to drive like there's the like
Saturday driving where I can just be but

174
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:35,430
Saturday driving where I can just be but
 

175
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,830
Saturday driving where I can just be but
then there was the I have to go to work

176
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:36,840
then there was the I have to go to work
 

177
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,420
then there was the I have to go to work
every day and I'm in traffic for an hour

178
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:38,430
every day and I'm in traffic for an hour
 

179
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,940
every day and I'm in traffic for an hour
I mean people really hate that and so

180
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:40,950
I mean people really hate that and so
 

181
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:45,170
I mean people really hate that and so
robots are designed to basically enhance

182
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:45,180
robots are designed to basically enhance
 

183
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,949
robots are designed to basically enhance
our ability to increase our quality of

184
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:48,959
our ability to increase our quality of
 

185
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,830
our ability to increase our quality of
life and so the perfection comes from

186
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:51,840
life and so the perfection comes from
 

187
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,910
life and so the perfection comes from
this aspect of interaction if I think

188
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:55,920
this aspect of interaction if I think
 

189
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,690
this aspect of interaction if I think
about how we drive if we drove perfectly

190
00:03:59,690 --> 00:03:59,700
about how we drive if we drove perfectly
 

191
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,270
about how we drive if we drove perfectly
we would never get anywhere right so

192
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:02,280
we would never get anywhere right so
 

193
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,229
we would never get anywhere right so
think about how many times you had to

194
00:04:05,229 --> 00:04:05,239
think about how many times you had to
 

195
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:07,759
think about how many times you had to
run past the light because you see the

196
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:07,769
run past the light because you see the
 

197
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:10,130
run past the light because you see the
car behind you is about to crash into

198
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:10,140
car behind you is about to crash into
 

199
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,970
car behind you is about to crash into
you or that little kid kind of runs into

200
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:13,980
you or that little kid kind of runs into
 

201
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,670
you or that little kid kind of runs into
the street and so you have to cross on

202
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:16,680
the street and so you have to cross on
 

203
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,020
the street and so you have to cross on
the other side because there's no cars

204
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:18,030
the other side because there's no cars
 

205
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,729
the other side because there's no cars
right like if you think about it we are

206
00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:19,739
right like if you think about it we are
 

207
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:21,710
right like if you think about it we are
not perfect drivers some of it is

208
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:21,720
not perfect drivers some of it is
 

209
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,550
not perfect drivers some of it is
because it

210
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:22,560
because it
 

211
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,460
because it
our world and so if you have a robot

212
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:25,470
our world and so if you have a robot
 

213
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,440
our world and so if you have a robot
that is perfect in that sense of the

214
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:27,450
that is perfect in that sense of the
 

215
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,230
that is perfect in that sense of the
word they wouldn't really be able to

216
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:30,240
word they wouldn't really be able to
 

217
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,000
word they wouldn't really be able to
function with us can you linger a little

218
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,010
function with us can you linger a little
 

219
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:35,420
function with us can you linger a little
bit on the word perfection so from the

220
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:35,430
bit on the word perfection so from the
 

221
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,390
bit on the word perfection so from the
robotics perspective what does that word

222
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:38,400
robotics perspective what does that word
 

223
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,230
robotics perspective what does that word
mean and how is sort of the optimal

224
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:42,240
mean and how is sort of the optimal
 

225
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,390
mean and how is sort of the optimal
behaviors you're describing different

226
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:44,400
behaviors you're describing different
 

227
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,129
behaviors you're describing different
than what we think that's perfection

228
00:04:46,129 --> 00:04:46,139
than what we think that's perfection
 

229
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:48,710
than what we think that's perfection
yeah so perfection if you think about it

230
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:48,720
yeah so perfection if you think about it
 

231
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,860
yeah so perfection if you think about it
in the more theoretical point of view

232
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:51,870
in the more theoretical point of view
 

233
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,620
in the more theoretical point of view
it's really tied to accuracy right so if

234
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:54,630
it's really tied to accuracy right so if
 

235
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,690
it's really tied to accuracy right so if
I have a function can I complete it at

236
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:56,700
I have a function can I complete it at
 

237
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:00,890
I have a function can I complete it at
100% accuracy with zero errors and so

238
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:00,900
100% accuracy with zero errors and so
 

239
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,600
100% accuracy with zero errors and so
that's kind of if you think about

240
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:02,610
that's kind of if you think about
 

241
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,240
that's kind of if you think about
perfection in the size of the word and

242
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:05,250
perfection in the size of the word and
 

243
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,030
perfection in the size of the word and
in a self-driving car realm do you think

244
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:08,040
in a self-driving car realm do you think
 

245
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,850
in a self-driving car realm do you think
from a robotics perspective we kind of

246
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:10,860
from a robotics perspective we kind of
 

247
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,270
from a robotics perspective we kind of
think that perfection means following

248
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:14,280
think that perfection means following
 

249
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,969
think that perfection means following
the rules perfectly sort of defining

250
00:05:16,969 --> 00:05:16,979
the rules perfectly sort of defining
 

251
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:19,700
the rules perfectly sort of defining
staying in the lane changing lanes when

252
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:19,710
staying in the lane changing lanes when
 

253
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,080
staying in the lane changing lanes when
there's a green light you go and there's

254
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:21,090
there's a green light you go and there's
 

255
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:23,990
there's a green light you go and there's
a red light you stop and that that's the

256
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,000
a red light you stop and that that's the
 

257
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,140
a red light you stop and that that's the
and be able to perfectly see all the

258
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:27,150
and be able to perfectly see all the
 

259
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,870
and be able to perfectly see all the
entities in the scene that's the limit

260
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:29,880
entities in the scene that's the limit
 

261
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,210
entities in the scene that's the limit
of what we think of as perfection and I

262
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:32,220
of what we think of as perfection and I
 

263
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,800
of what we think of as perfection and I
think that's where the problem comes is

264
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:33,810
think that's where the problem comes is
 

265
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,529
think that's where the problem comes is
that when people think about perfection

266
00:05:36,529 --> 00:05:36,539
that when people think about perfection
 

267
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:39,980
that when people think about perfection
for robotics the ones that are the most

268
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:39,990
for robotics the ones that are the most
 

269
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,290
for robotics the ones that are the most
successful are the ones that are quote

270
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:42,300
successful are the ones that are quote
 

271
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,909
successful are the ones that are quote
unquote perfect like I said Rosie is

272
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:43,919
unquote perfect like I said Rosie is
 

273
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,400
unquote perfect like I said Rosie is
perfect but she actually wasn't perfect

274
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:46,410
perfect but she actually wasn't perfect
 

275
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,080
perfect but she actually wasn't perfect
in terms of accuracy but she was perfect

276
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,090
in terms of accuracy but she was perfect
 

277
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:50,540
in terms of accuracy but she was perfect
in terms of how she interacted and how

278
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:50,550
in terms of how she interacted and how
 

279
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,520
in terms of how she interacted and how
she adapted and I think that's some of

280
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:52,530
she adapted and I think that's some of
 

281
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:55,330
she adapted and I think that's some of
the disconnect is that we really want

282
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:55,340
the disconnect is that we really want
 

283
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,490
the disconnect is that we really want
perfection with respect to its ability

284
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:58,500
perfection with respect to its ability
 

285
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,100
perfection with respect to its ability
to adapt to us we don't really want

286
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:01,110
to adapt to us we don't really want
 

287
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,350
to adapt to us we don't really want
perfection with respect to 100% accuracy

288
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:03,360
perfection with respect to 100% accuracy
 

289
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,300
perfection with respect to 100% accuracy
with respect to the rules that we just

290
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:05,310
with respect to the rules that we just
 

291
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,310
with respect to the rules that we just
made up anyway right and so I think

292
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:07,320
made up anyway right and so I think
 

293
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,260
made up anyway right and so I think
there's this disconnect sometimes

294
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:09,270
there's this disconnect sometimes
 

295
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:12,830
there's this disconnect sometimes
between what we really want and what

296
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:12,840
between what we really want and what
 

297
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,120
between what we really want and what
happens and we see this all the time

298
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,130
happens and we see this all the time
 

299
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:17,180
happens and we see this all the time
like in my research right like the the

300
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:17,190
like in my research right like the the
 

301
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,340
like in my research right like the the

interactions are when the robot is

304
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:22,250
interactions are when the robot is
 

305
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:26,090
interactions are when the robot is
adapting based on the person not 100%

306
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:26,100
adapting based on the person not 100%
 

307
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,580
adapting based on the person not 100%
following what's optimal based on the

308
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:28,590
following what's optimal based on the
 

309
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,620
following what's optimal based on the
roles just to linger on autonomous

310
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:30,630
roles just to linger on autonomous
 

311
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:33,290
roles just to linger on autonomous
vehicles for a second just your thoughts

312
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:33,300
vehicles for a second just your thoughts
 

313
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,510
vehicles for a second just your thoughts
maybe off the top of her head

314
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:35,520
maybe off the top of her head
 

315
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,879
maybe off the top of her head
is how hard is that problem do you think

316
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:37,889
is how hard is that problem do you think
 

317
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:39,529
is how hard is that problem do you think
based on what we just talked about you

318
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:39,539
based on what we just talked about you
 

319
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:41,930
based on what we just talked about you

I think if you look at some of the

358
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:33,270
I think if you look at some of the
 

359
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,890
I think if you look at some of the
things that are being successful is

360
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:35,900
things that are being successful is
 

361
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:41,270
things that are being successful is
these basically fixed environments where

362
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,280
these basically fixed environments where
 

363
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,060
these basically fixed environments where
you still have some anomalies wait you

364
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:44,070
you still have some anomalies wait you
 

365
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,980
you still have some anomalies wait you
still have people walking you still have

366
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:45,990
still have people walking you still have
 

367
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:49,490
still have people walking you still have
stores but you don't have other drivers

368
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:49,500
stores but you don't have other drivers
 

369
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,830
stores but you don't have other drivers
right like other human drivers are is a

370
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:51,840
right like other human drivers are is a
 

371
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,730
right like other human drivers are is a
dedicated space for the for the cars

372
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:54,740
dedicated space for the for the cars
 

373
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,779
dedicated space for the for the cars
because if you think about robotics in

374
00:07:56,779 --> 00:07:56,789
because if you think about robotics in

general where has always been successful
 

377
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:00,709
general where has always been successful
is I mean you can say manufacturing like

378
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:00,719
is I mean you can say manufacturing like
 

379
00:08:00,719 --> 00:08:02,719
is I mean you can say manufacturing like
way back in the day right it was a fixed

380
00:08:02,719 --> 00:08:02,729
way back in the day right it was a fixed
 

381
00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:04,399
way back in the day right it was a fixed
environment humans were not part of the

382
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:04,409
environment humans were not part of the
 

383
00:08:04,409 --> 00:08:06,399
environment humans were not part of the
equation we're a lot better than that

384
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:06,409
equation we're a lot better than that
 

385
00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:10,730
equation we're a lot better than that
but like when we can carve out scenarios

386
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:10,740
but like when we can carve out scenarios
 

387
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,450
but like when we can carve out scenarios
that are closer to that space then I

388
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:14,460
that are closer to that space then I
 

389
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,839
that are closer to that space then I
think that it's where we are so a closed

390
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:17,849
think that it's where we are so a closed
 

391
00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:19,430
think that it's where we are so a closed
campus where you don't have self-driving

392
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:19,440
campus where you don't have self-driving
 

393
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,700
campus where you don't have self-driving
cars and maybe some protection so that

394
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:22,710
cars and maybe some protection so that
 

395
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,249
cars and maybe some protection so that
the students don't jet in front just

396
00:08:25,249 --> 00:08:25,259
the students don't jet in front just
 

397
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:26,779
the students don't jet in front just
because they want to see what happens

398
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:26,789
because they want to see what happens
 

399
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:29,450
because they want to see what happens
like having a little bit I think that's

400
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:29,460
like having a little bit I think that's
 

401
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,159
like having a little bit I think that's
where we're gonna see the most success

402
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:31,169
where we're gonna see the most success
 

403
00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:33,050
where we're gonna see the most success
in the near future and be slow-moving

00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:09,050
of expert in the field so what does it
feel for machine to come to you it's one

478
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:09,060
feel for machine to come to you it's one
 

479
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,139
feel for machine to come to you it's one
of these very fascinating things but

480
00:10:12,139 --> 00:10:12,149
of these very fascinating things but
 

481
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:16,280
of these very fascinating things but
also I am hyper hyper alert right like

482
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:16,290
also I am hyper hyper alert right like
 

483
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:19,819
also I am hyper hyper alert right like
I'm hyper alert like my but my thumb is

484
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:19,829
I'm hyper alert like my but my thumb is
 

485
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:23,509
I'm hyper alert like my but my thumb is
like okay I'm ready to take over even

486
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:23,519
like okay I'm ready to take over even
 

487
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,030
like okay I'm ready to take over even
when I'm in my car or I'm doing things

488
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:26,040
when I'm in my car or I'm doing things
 

489
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,090
when I'm in my car or I'm doing things
like automated backing into so there's

490
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:29,100
like automated backing into so there's
 

491
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,530
like automated backing into so there's
like a feature where you can do this

492
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:30,540
like a feature where you can do this
 

493
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,030
like a feature where you can do this
automating backing into our parking

494
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:32,040
automating backing into our parking
 

495
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,160
automating backing into our parking
space our bring the car out of your

496
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:34,170
space our bring the car out of your
 

497
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:38,569
space our bring the car out of your
garage or even you know pseudo autopilot

498
00:10:38,569 --> 00:10:38,579
garage or even you know pseudo autopilot
 

499
00:10:38,579 --> 00:10:40,249
garage or even you know pseudo autopilot
on the freeway right

500
00:10:40,249 --> 00:10:40,259
on the freeway right
 

501
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:43,970
on the freeway right
I am hyper sensitive I can feel like as

502
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:43,980
I am hyper sensitive I can feel like as
 

503
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,400
I am hyper sensitive I can feel like as
I'm navigating like yeah that's an error

504
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:46,410
I'm navigating like yeah that's an error
 

505
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,280
I'm navigating like yeah that's an error
right there like I am very aware of it

506
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:49,290
right there like I am very aware of it
 

507
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:52,549
right there like I am very aware of it
but I'm also fascinated by it and it

508
00:10:52,549 --> 00:10:52,559
but I'm also fascinated by it and it
 

509
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:54,710
but I'm also fascinated by it and it
does get better like it

510
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:54,720
does get better like it
 

511
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,920
does get better like it
I look and see it's learning from all of

512
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:57,930
I look and see it's learning from all of
 

513
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:01,059
I look and see it's learning from all of
these people who are cutting it on like

514
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:01,069
these people who are cutting it on like
 

515
00:11:01,069 --> 00:11:02,160
these people who are cutting it on like
every

516
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,170
every
 

517
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:04,379
every
come on it's getting better right and so

518
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:04,389
come on it's getting better right and so
 

519
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:06,090
come on it's getting better right and so
I think that's what's amazing about it

520
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:06,100
I think that's what's amazing about it
 

521
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,150
I think that's what's amazing about it
is that this nice dance of you're still

522
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:09,160
is that this nice dance of you're still
 

523
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,920
is that this nice dance of you're still
hyper-vigilant so you're still not

524
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:10,930
hyper-vigilant so you're still not
 

525
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:13,560
hyper-vigilant so you're still not
trusting it at all yeah yeah you're

526
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:13,570
trusting it at all yeah yeah you're
 

527
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,690
trusting it at all yeah yeah you're
using it what on the highway if I were

528
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:15,700
using it what on the highway if I were
 

529
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,960
using it what on the highway if I were
to like what as a roboticist we'll talk

530
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:18,970
to like what as a roboticist we'll talk
 

531
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:22,980
to like what as a roboticist we'll talk
about trust a little bit what how do you

532
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:22,990
about trust a little bit what how do you
 

533
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,379
about trust a little bit what how do you
explain that you still use it is it the

534
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:25,389
explain that you still use it is it the
 

535
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:27,060
explain that you still use it is it the
gadget freak part like where you just

536
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:27,070
gadget freak part like where you just
 

537
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:32,009
gadget freak part like where you just
enjoy exploring technology or is that

538
00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:32,019
enjoy exploring technology or is that
 

539
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:33,900
enjoy exploring technology or is that
the right actually balance between

540
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:33,910
the right actually balance between
 

541
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,840
the right actually balance between
robotics and humans is where you use it

542
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:36,850
robotics and humans is where you use it
 

543
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:39,210
robotics and humans is where you use it
but don't trust it and somehow there's

544
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:39,220
but don't trust it and somehow there's
 

545
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,819
but don't trust it and somehow there's
this dance that ultimately is a positive

546
00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:41,829
this dance that ultimately is a positive
 

547
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:45,629
this dance that ultimately is a positive
yes so I think I'm I just don't

548
00:11:45,629 --> 00:11:45,639
yes so I think I'm I just don't
 

549
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:48,629
yes so I think I'm I just don't
necessarily trust technology but I'm an

550
00:11:48,629 --> 00:11:48,639
necessarily trust technology but I'm an
 

551
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:51,300
necessarily trust technology but I'm an
early adopter right so when it first

552
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:51,310
early adopter right so when it first
 

553
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,420
early adopter right so when it first
comes out I will use everything but I

554
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:54,430
comes out I will use everything but I
 

555
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:56,759
comes out I will use everything but I
will be very very cautious of how I use

556
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:56,769
will be very very cautious of how I use
 

557
00:11:56,769 --> 00:11:56,970
will be very very cautious of how I use
it

558
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:56,980
it
 

559
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,180
it
do you read about or do you explore but

560
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:00,190
do you read about or do you explore but
 

561
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:04,230
do you read about or do you explore but
just try it they do like it's crudely to

562
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:04,240
just try it they do like it's crudely to
 

563
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,759
just try it they do like it's crudely to
put a crew they do you read the manual

564
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:05,769
put a crew they do you read the manual
 

565
00:12:05,769 --> 00:12:08,040
put a crew they do you read the manual
or do you learn through exploration I'm

566
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,050
or do you learn through exploration I'm
 

567
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:09,569
or do you learn through exploration I'm
an explorer if I have to read the manual

568
00:12:09,569 --> 00:12:09,579
an explorer if I have to read the manual
 

569
00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:12,900
an explorer if I have to read the manual
then you know I do design then it's a

570
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:12,910
then you know I do design then it's a
 

571
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:16,800
then you know I do design then it's a
bad user interface it's a failure Elon

572
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:16,810
bad user interface it's a failure Elon
 

573
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:19,050
bad user interface it's a failure Elon
Musk is very confident that you kind of

574
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:19,060
Musk is very confident that you kind of
 

575
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,180
Musk is very confident that you kind of
take it from where it is now to full

576
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:21,190
take it from where it is now to full
 

577
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:23,699
take it from where it is now to full
autonomy so from this human robot

578
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:23,709
autonomy so from this human robot
 

579
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:25,650
autonomy so from this human robot
interaction you don't really trust and

580
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:25,660
interaction you don't really trust and
 

581
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,810
interaction you don't really trust and
then you try and then you catch it when

582
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:27,820
then you try and then you catch it when
 

583
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,449
then you try and then you catch it when
it fails to it's going to incrementally

584
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:30,459
it fails to it's going to incrementally
 

585
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:34,110
it fails to it's going to incrementally
improve itself into full full way you

586
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:34,120
improve itself into full full way you
 

587
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,189
improve itself into full full way you
don't need to participate what's your

588
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:37,199
don't need to participate what's your
 

589
00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:40,740
don't need to participate what's your
sense of that trajectory is it feasible

590
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:40,750
sense of that trajectory is it feasible
 

591
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,530
sense of that trajectory is it feasible
so the promise there is by the end of

592
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:43,540
so the promise there is by the end of
 

593
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,900
so the promise there is by the end of
next year by the end of 2020 it's the

594
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:45,910
next year by the end of 2020 it's the
 

595
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:50,280
next year by the end of 2020 it's the
current promise what's your sense about

596
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:50,290
current promise what's your sense about
 

597
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:54,150
current promise what's your sense about
that journey that test is on so there's

598
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:54,160
that journey that test is on so there's
 

599
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,340
that journey that test is on so there's
kind of three three things going on now

600
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:56,350
kind of three three things going on now
 

601
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:02,069
kind of three three things going on now
I think in terms of will people go like

602
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:02,079
I think in terms of will people go like
 

603
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,030
I think in terms of will people go like
as a user as a adopter will you trust

604
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:06,040
as a user as a adopter will you trust
 

605
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,780
as a user as a adopter will you trust
going to that point I think so right

606
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:09,790
going to that point I think so right
 

607
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,579
going to that point I think so right
like there are some users and it's

608
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:11,589
like there are some users and it's
 

609
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:15,780
like there are some users and it's
because what happens is when technology

610
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:15,790
because what happens is when technology
 

611
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,700
because what happens is when technology
at the beginning and then the technology

612
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:17,710
at the beginning and then the technology
 

613
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:21,780
at the beginning and then the technology
tends to work your apprehension slow

614
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:21,790
tends to work your apprehension slow
 

615
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:25,380
tends to work your apprehension slow
slowly goes away and as people we tend

616
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:25,390
slowly goes away and as people we tend
 

617
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,960
slowly goes away and as people we tend
to swing to the other extreme right

618
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:27,970
to swing to the other extreme right
 

619
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,090
to swing to the other extreme right
because like oh I was like hyper hyper

620
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:30,100
because like oh I was like hyper hyper
 

621
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,700
because like oh I was like hyper hyper
fearful or hypersensitive and was

622
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:32,710
fearful or hypersensitive and was
 

623
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:35,730
fearful or hypersensitive and was
awesome and we just tend to swing that's

624
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:35,740
awesome and we just tend to swing that's
 

625
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,370
awesome and we just tend to swing that's
just human nature and so you will have I

626
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:38,380
just human nature and so you will have I
 

627
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,860
just human nature and so you will have I
mean it is a scary notion because most

628
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:40,870
mean it is a scary notion because most
 

629
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:44,490
mean it is a scary notion because most
people are now extremely untrusting of

630
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:44,500
people are now extremely untrusting of
 

631
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,020
people are now extremely untrusting of
autobot they use it but they don't trust

632
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,030
autobot they use it but they don't trust
 

633
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,910
autobot they use it but they don't trust
it and it's a scary notion that there's

634
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:47,920
it and it's a scary notion that there's
 

635
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,980
it and it's a scary notion that there's
a certain point where you allow yourself

636
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:49,990
a certain point where you allow yourself
 

637
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:52,290
a certain point where you allow yourself
to look at the smartphone for like 20

638
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:52,300
to look at the smartphone for like 20
 

639
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,210
to look at the smartphone for like 20
seconds and then there'll be this phase

640
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:54,220
seconds and then there'll be this phase
 

641
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:57,480
seconds and then there'll be this phase
shift will be like 20 seconds 30 seconds

642
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:57,490
shift will be like 20 seconds 30 seconds
 

643
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:01,230
shift will be like 20 seconds 30 seconds
1 minute 2 minutes this is scary it's

644
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:01,240
1 minute 2 minutes this is scary it's
 

645
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,240
1 minute 2 minutes this is scary it's
opposition but that's people right

646
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:03,250
opposition but that's people right
 

647
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,940
opposition but that's people right
that's human that's humans I mean I

that's human that's humans I mean I
 

649
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:10,890
that's human that's humans I mean I
think of even our use of I mean just

650
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:10,900
think of even our use of I mean just
 

651
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,510
think of even our use of I mean just
everything on the internet right like

652
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:12,520
everything on the internet right like
 

653
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,360
everything on the internet right like
think about how relying we are on

654
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:15,370
think about how relying we are on
 

655
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:19,490
think about how relying we are on
certain apps and certain engines right

656
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:19,500
certain apps and certain engines right
 

657
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,780
certain apps and certain engines right
20 years ago people have been like oh

658
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:21,790
20 years ago people have been like oh
 

659
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,460
20 years ago people have been like oh
yeah that's stupid like that makes no

660
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:23,470
yeah that's stupid like that makes no
 

661
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,740
yeah that's stupid like that makes no
sense like of course that's false

662
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:25,750
sense like of course that's false
 

663
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,870
sense like of course that's false
like now it's just like oh of course

664
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:27,880
like now it's just like oh of course
 

665
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,060
like now it's just like oh of course
I've been using it it's been correct all

666
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:30,070
I've been using it it's been correct all
 

667
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:33,300
I've been using it it's been correct all
this time of course aliens I didn't

668
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:33,310
this time of course aliens I didn't
 

669
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,640
this time of course aliens I didn't
think they existed but now it says they

670
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:35,650
think they existed but now it says they
 

671
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:42,240

do obvious nth earth is flat so okay but

672
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:42,250
do obvious nth earth is flat so okay but
 

673
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,580

you said three things so one is okay so

674
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:44,590
you said three things so one is okay so
 

675
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,530
you said three things so one is okay so
one is the human and I think there would

676
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:46,540
one is the human and I think there would
 

677
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,060
one is the human and I think there would
be a group of individuals that will

678
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:48,070
be a group of individuals that will
 

679
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:51,690
be a group of individuals that will
swing right I just teenagers gene it I

680
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:51,700
swing right I just teenagers gene it I
 

681
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,540
swing right I just teenagers gene it I
mean it'll be clean it'll be adults

682
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:53,550
mean it'll be clean it'll be adults
 

683
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:56,340
mean it'll be clean it'll be adults
there's actually an age demographic

684
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:56,350
there's actually an age demographic
 

685
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:59,810
there's actually an age demographic
that's optimal for a technology adoption

686
00:14:59,810 --> 00:14:59,820
that's optimal for a technology adoption
 

687
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,340
that's optimal for a technology adoption
and you can actually find them and

688
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:02,350
and you can actually find them and
 

689
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,450
and you can actually find them and
they're actually pretty easy to find

690
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:03,460
they're actually pretty easy to find
 

691
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,140
they're actually pretty easy to find
just the based on their habits based on

692
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:06,150
just the based on their habits based on
 

693
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:09,390
just the based on their habits based on
so someone like me who wouldn't wasn't

694
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:09,400
so someone like me who wouldn't wasn't
 

695
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,030
so someone like me who wouldn't wasn't
no robot Isis or probably be the optimal

696
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:12,040
no robot Isis or probably be the optimal
 

697
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,850
no robot Isis or probably be the optimal
kind of person right early adopter okay

698
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:14,860
kind of person right early adopter okay
 

699
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:18,000
kind of person right early adopter okay
with technology very comfortable and not

700
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,010
with technology very comfortable and not
 

701
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:20,910
with technology very comfortable and not
hyper sensitive right I'm just the hyper

702
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:20,920
hyper sensitive right I'm just the hyper
 

703
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,320
hyper sensitive right I'm just the hyper
sensitive because I designed this stuff

704
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:22,330
sensitive because I designed this stuff
 

705
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:25,050
sensitive because I designed this stuff
yeah so there is a target demographic

706
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:25,060
yeah so there is a target demographic
 

707
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,940
yeah so there is a target demographic
that will swing the other one though is

708
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:26,950
that will swing the other one though is
 

709
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:29,550
that will swing the other one though is
you still have these hue

710
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:29,560
you still have these hue
 

711
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,160
you still have these hue
that are on the road that one is a

712
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:32,170
that are on the road that one is a
 

713
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:36,720
that are on the road that one is a
harder harder thing to do and as long as

714
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:36,730
harder harder thing to do and as long as
 

715
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:39,150
harder harder thing to do and as long as
we have people that are on the same

716
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:39,160
we have people that are on the same
 

717
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,960
we have people that are on the same
streets that's going to be the big issue

718
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:41,970
streets that's going to be the big issue
 

719
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:44,340
streets that's going to be the big issue
and it's just because you can't possibly

720
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:44,350
and it's just because you can't possibly
 

721
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:47,460
and it's just because you can't possibly
know well so you can't possibly map the

722
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:47,470
know well so you can't possibly map the
 

723
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:50,700
know well so you can't possibly map the
some of the silliness of human drivers

724
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:50,710
some of the silliness of human drivers
 

725
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:54,840
some of the silliness of human drivers
right like as an example when you're

726
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:54,850
right like as an example when you're
 

727
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:57,090
right like as an example when you're
next to that car that has that big

728
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:57,100
next to that car that has that big
 

729
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,019
next to that car that has that big
sticker called student driver right like

730
00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:00,029
sticker called student driver right like
 

731
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:03,269
sticker called student driver right like
you are like oh either I am going to

732
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:03,279
you are like oh either I am going to
 

733
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,150
you are like oh either I am going to
like go around like we are we know that

734
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,160
like go around like we are we know that
 

735
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,590
like go around like we are we know that
that person is just gonna make mistakes

736
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:07,600
that person is just gonna make mistakes
 

737
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,810
that person is just gonna make mistakes
that make no sense right how do you map

738
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:09,820
that make no sense right how do you map
 

739
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:13,260
that make no sense right how do you map
that information or if I'm in a car and

740
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:13,270
that information or if I'm in a car and
 

741
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:16,100
that information or if I'm in a car and
I look over and I see you know two

742
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:16,110
I look over and I see you know two
 

743
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:19,320
I look over and I see you know two
fairly young looking individuals and

744
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:19,330
fairly young looking individuals and
 

745
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:21,360
fairly young looking individuals and
there's no student driver bumper and I

746
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:21,370
there's no student driver bumper and I
 

747
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,920
there's no student driver bumper and I
see them chit-chatting to each other I'm

748
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:22,930
see them chit-chatting to each other I'm
 

749
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:26,040
see them chit-chatting to each other I'm
like oh yeah that's an issue right so

750
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:26,050
like oh yeah that's an issue right so
 

751
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,690
like oh yeah that's an issue right so
how do you get that kind of information

752
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:27,700
how do you get that kind of information
 

753
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:34,050
how do you get that kind of information
and that experience into basically an

754
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:34,060
and that experience into basically an
 

755
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,450
and that experience into basically an
autopilot yeah and there's millions of

756
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:36,460
autopilot yeah and there's millions of
 

757
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,820
autopilot yeah and there's millions of
cases like that where we take little

758
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:38,830
cases like that where we take little
 

759
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:41,490
cases like that where we take little
hints to establish context I mean you

760
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:41,500
hints to establish context I mean you
 

761
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,010
hints to establish context I mean you
said kind of beautifully poetic human

762
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:44,020
said kind of beautifully poetic human
 

763
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,390
said kind of beautifully poetic human
things but there's probably subtle

764
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:45,400
things but there's probably subtle
 

765
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,670
things but there's probably subtle
things about the environment about is

766
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:47,680
things about the environment about is
 

767
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,770
things about the environment about is
about it being maybe time for commuters

768
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:52,780
about it being maybe time for commuters
 

769
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,740
about it being maybe time for commuters
start going home from work and therefore

770
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:55,750
start going home from work and therefore
 

771
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,210
start going home from work and therefore
you can make some kind of judgment about

772
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:57,220
you can make some kind of judgment about
 

773
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:01,170
you can make some kind of judgment about
the group behavior of pedestrians or

774
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:01,180
the group behavior of pedestrians or
 

775
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,380
the group behavior of pedestrians or
even cities right like if you're in

776
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:04,390
even cities right like if you're in
 

777
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,290
even cities right like if you're in
Boston how people cross the street like

778
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:07,300
Boston how people cross the street like
 

779
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,140
Boston how people cross the street like
lights are not an issue versus other

780
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:10,150
lights are not an issue versus other
 

781
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,870

places where people will will actually
 

783
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,880
places where people will will actually
wait for the crosswalk or somewhere

784
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:16,890
wait for the crosswalk or somewhere
 

785
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:21,329
wait for the crosswalk or somewhere
peaceful and but what I've also seen so

786
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:21,339
peaceful and but what I've also seen so
 

787
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:24,000
peaceful and but what I've also seen so
just even in Boston that intersection

788
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,010
just even in Boston that intersection
 

789
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,490
just even in Boston that intersection
the intersection is different so every

790
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:26,500
the intersection is different so every
 

791
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,140
the intersection is different so every
intersection has a personality of its

792
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:28,150
intersection has a personality of its
 

793
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,000
intersection has a personality of its
own so that certain neighborhoods of

794
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,010
own so that certain neighborhoods of
 

795
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,790
own so that certain neighborhoods of
Boston are different so we kind of end

796
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:32,800
Boston are different so we kind of end
 

797
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,310
Boston are different so we kind of end
the based on different timing of day at

798
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:35,320
the based on different timing of day at
 

799
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,050
the based on different timing of day at
night it's all it's all there's a

800
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:37,060
night it's all it's all there's a
 

801
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:40,410
night it's all it's all there's a
there's a dynamic to human behavior that

802
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:40,420
there's a dynamic to human behavior that
 

803
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,540
there's a dynamic to human behavior that
would kind of figure out ourselves we're

804
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:42,550
would kind of figure out ourselves we're
 

805
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,350
would kind of figure out ourselves we're
not

806
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:43,360
not
 

807
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,030
not
be able to we're not able to introspect

808
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:45,040
be able to we're not able to introspect
 

809
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,669
be able to we're not able to introspect
and figure it out but somehow we our

810
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:47,679
and figure it out but somehow we our
 

811
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,910
and figure it out but somehow we our
brain learns it we do and so you're

812
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:50,920
brain learns it we do and so you're
 

813
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,910
brain learns it we do and so you're
you're saying is there so that's the

814
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:53,920
you're saying is there so that's the
 

815
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,770
you're saying is there so that's the
shortcut that's their shortcut though

816
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:55,780
shortcut that's their shortcut though
 

817
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,480
shortcut that's their shortcut though
for everybody is there something that

818
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:57,490
for everybody is there something that
 

819
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:00,480
for everybody is there something that
could be done you think that you know

820
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:00,490
could be done you think that you know
 

821
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:03,360
could be done you think that you know
that's what we humans do it's just like

822
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:03,370
that's what we humans do it's just like
 

823
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:05,549
that's what we humans do it's just like
bird flight right this example they give

824
00:18:05,549 --> 00:18:05,559
bird flight right this example they give
 

825
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:07,560
bird flight right this example they give
for flight do you necessarily need to

826
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:07,570
for flight do you necessarily need to
 

827
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:09,810
for flight do you necessarily need to
build the bird that flies or can you do

828
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:09,820
build the bird that flies or can you do
 

829
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:13,380
build the bird that flies or can you do
an airplane is there shortcut so I think

830
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:13,390
an airplane is there shortcut so I think
 

831
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:17,010
an airplane is there shortcut so I think
the the shortcut is and I kind of I talk

832
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:17,020
the the shortcut is and I kind of I talk
 

833
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:21,030
the the shortcut is and I kind of I talk
about it as a fixed space where so

834
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:21,040
about it as a fixed space where so
 

835
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,490
about it as a fixed space where so
imagine that there is a neighborhood

836
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:22,500
imagine that there is a neighborhood
 

837
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,830
imagine that there is a neighborhood
that's a new smart city or a new

838
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:25,840
that's a new smart city or a new
 

839
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,720
that's a new smart city or a new
neighborhood that says you know what we

840
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:27,730
neighborhood that says you know what we
 

841
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:31,740
neighborhood that says you know what we
are going to design this new city based

842
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:31,750
are going to design this new city based
 

843
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,110
are going to design this new city based
on supporting self-driving cars and then

844
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:34,120
on supporting self-driving cars and then
 

845
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,080
on supporting self-driving cars and then
doing things knowing that there's

846
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:37,090
doing things knowing that there's
 

847
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,789
doing things knowing that there's
anomalies knowing that people are like

848
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:38,799
anomalies knowing that people are like
 

849
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,860
anomalies knowing that people are like
this right and designing it based on

850
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:40,870
this right and designing it based on
 

851
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,020
this right and designing it based on
that assumption that like we're gonna

852
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,030
that assumption that like we're gonna
 

853
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:45,030
that assumption that like we're gonna
have this that would be an example of a

854
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:45,040
have this that would be an example of a
 

855
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,280
have this that would be an example of a
shortcut so you still have people but

856
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:47,290
shortcut so you still have people but
 

857
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:49,650
shortcut so you still have people but
you do very specific things to try to

858
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:49,660
you do very specific things to try to
 

859
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:53,250
you do very specific things to try to
minimize the noise a little bit as an

860
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:53,260
minimize the noise a little bit as an
 

861
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,930
minimize the noise a little bit as an
example and the people themselves become

862
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:54,940
example and the people themselves become
 

863
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,490
example and the people themselves become
accepting of the notion that there's

864
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:56,500
accepting of the notion that there's
 

865
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,320
accepting of the notion that there's
autonomous cars right right like they

866
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:58,330
autonomous cars right right like they
 

867
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:01,110
autonomous cars right right like they
move into so right now you have like a

868
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:01,120
move into so right now you have like a
 

869
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,970
move into so right now you have like a
you will have a self-selection bias

870
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:02,980
you will have a self-selection bias
 

871
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,340
you will have a self-selection bias
right like individuals will move into

872
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:05,350
right like individuals will move into
 

873
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:07,440
right like individuals will move into
this neighborhood knowing like this is

874
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:07,450
this neighborhood knowing like this is
 

875
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,600
this neighborhood knowing like this is
part of like the real estate pitch right

876
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:09,610
part of like the real estate pitch right
 

877
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:13,230
part of like the real estate pitch right
and so I think that's a way to do a

878
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:13,240
and so I think that's a way to do a
 

879
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,610
and so I think that's a way to do a
shortcut when it allows you to deploy it

880
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:17,620
shortcut when it allows you to deploy it
 

881
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,770
shortcut when it allows you to deploy it
allows you to collect then data with

882
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:19,780
allows you to collect then data with
 

883
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,650
allows you to collect then data with
these variances and anomalies because

884
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:22,660
these variances and anomalies because
 

885
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:25,440
these variances and anomalies because
people are still people but it's it's a

886
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:25,450
people are still people but it's it's a
 

887
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:27,690
people are still people but it's it's a
safer space and it's more of an

888
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:27,700
safer space and it's more of an
 

889
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,090
safer space and it's more of an
accepting space ie when something in

890
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:30,100
accepting space ie when something in
 

891
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,820
accepting space ie when something in
that space might happen because things

892
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:32,830
that space might happen because things
 

893
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:35,340
that space might happen because things
do because you already have the self

894
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:35,350
do because you already have the self
 

895
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:37,530
do because you already have the self
selection like people would be I think a

896
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:37,540
selection like people would be I think a
 

897
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:40,140
selection like people would be I think a
little more forgiving than other places

898
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:40,150
little more forgiving than other places
 

899
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:42,090
little more forgiving than other places
and you said three things that would

900
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:42,100
and you said three things that would
 

901
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,990
and you said three things that would
cover all of them the third is legal

902
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:45,000
cover all of them the third is legal
 

903
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,490
cover all of them the third is legal
liability which I don't really want to

904
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:47,500
liability which I don't really want to
 

905
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,890
liability which I don't really want to
touch but it's still it's it's still of

906
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:49,900
touch but it's still it's it's still of
 

907
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,169
touch but it's still it's it's still of
concern in the mishmash with like with

908
00:19:52,169 --> 00:19:52,179
concern in the mishmash with like with
 

909
00:19:52,179 --> 00:19:54,419
concern in the mishmash with like with
policy as well sort of government all

910
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:54,429
policy as well sort of government all
 

911
00:19:54,429 --> 00:19:56,029
policy as well sort of government all
that that whole that

912
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:56,039
that that whole that
 

913
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:59,859
that that whole that
big ball of mess yeah gotcha so that's

914
00:19:59,859 --> 00:19:59,869
big ball of mess yeah gotcha so that's
 

915
00:19:59,869 --> 00:20:03,979
big ball of mess yeah gotcha so that's
so we're out of time what do you think

916
00:20:03,979 --> 00:20:03,989
so we're out of time what do you think
 

917
00:20:03,989 --> 00:20:07,430
so we're out of time what do you think
from robotics perspective you know if

918
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:07,440
from robotics perspective you know if
 

919
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,869
from robotics perspective you know if
you if you're kind of honest of what

920
00:20:08,869 --> 00:20:08,879
you if you're kind of honest of what
 

921
00:20:08,879 --> 00:20:11,779
you if you're kind of honest of what
cars do they they kind of kind of

922
00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:11,789
cars do they they kind of kind of
 

923
00:20:11,789 --> 00:20:14,049
cars do they they kind of kind of
threaten each other's life all the time

924
00:20:14,049 --> 00:20:14,059
threaten each other's life all the time
 

925
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:18,200
threaten each other's life all the time
so cars are very us I mean in order to

926
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:18,210
so cars are very us I mean in order to
 

927
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,609
so cars are very us I mean in order to
navigate intersections there's an

928
00:20:19,609 --> 00:20:19,619
navigate intersections there's an
 

929
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:21,979
navigate intersections there's an
assertiveness there's a risk-taking and

930
00:20:21,979 --> 00:20:21,989
assertiveness there's a risk-taking and
 

931
00:20:21,989 --> 00:20:23,810
assertiveness there's a risk-taking and
if you were to reduce it to an objective

932
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:23,820
if you were to reduce it to an objective
 

933
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:27,560
if you were to reduce it to an objective
function there's a probability of murder

934
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:27,570
function there's a probability of murder
 

935
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:30,200
function there's a probability of murder
in that function meaning you killing

936
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:30,210
in that function meaning you killing
 

937
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:32,659
in that function meaning you killing
another human being and you're using

938
00:20:32,659 --> 00:20:32,669
another human being and you're using
 

939
00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:35,029
another human being and you're using
that first of all yeah it has to be low

940
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:35,039
that first of all yeah it has to be low
 

941
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,690
that first of all yeah it has to be low
enough to be acceptable to you on an

942
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:38,700
enough to be acceptable to you on an
 

943
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,729
enough to be acceptable to you on an
ethical level as a individual human

944
00:20:40,729 --> 00:20:40,739
ethical level as a individual human
 

945
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,099
ethical level as a individual human
being but it has to be high enough for

946
00:20:43,099 --> 00:20:43,109
being but it has to be high enough for
 

947
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:46,039
being but it has to be high enough for
people to respect you to not sort of

948
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:46,049
people to respect you to not sort of
 

949
00:20:46,049 --> 00:20:47,659
people to respect you to not sort of
take advantage of you completely and

950
00:20:47,659 --> 00:20:47,669
take advantage of you completely and
 

951
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:50,749
take advantage of you completely and
jaywalking front knee and so on so I

952
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:50,759
jaywalking front knee and so on so I
 

953
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:52,129
jaywalking front knee and so on so I
mean I don't think there's a right

954
00:20:52,129 --> 00:20:52,139
mean I don't think there's a right
 

955
00:20:52,139 --> 00:20:54,919
mean I don't think there's a right
answer here but what's how do we solve

956
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:54,929
answer here but what's how do we solve
 

957
00:20:54,929 --> 00:20:56,989
answer here but what's how do we solve
that how how do we solve that from a

958
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:56,999
that how how do we solve that from a
 

959
00:20:56,999 --> 00:20:58,909
that how how do we solve that from a
robotics perspective one danger and

960
00:20:58,909 --> 00:20:58,919
robotics perspective one danger and
 

961
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:00,080
robotics perspective one danger and
human life is at stake

962
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:00,090
human life is at stake
 

963
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,759
human life is at stake
yeah as they say cars don't kill people

964
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:01,769
yeah as they say cars don't kill people
 

965
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:06,460
yeah as they say cars don't kill people
people kill people people right

966
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:06,470
people kill people people right
 

967
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:10,129
people kill people people right
so I think now robotic algorithms would

968
00:21:10,129 --> 00:21:10,139
so I think now robotic algorithms would
 

969
00:21:10,139 --> 00:21:12,889
so I think now robotic algorithms would
be killing right so it will be robotics

970
00:21:12,889 --> 00:21:12,899
be killing right so it will be robotics
 

971
00:21:12,899 --> 00:21:15,080
be killing right so it will be robotics
algorithms that are prone oh it will be

972
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:15,090
algorithms that are prone oh it will be
 

973
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:16,820
algorithms that are prone oh it will be
robotic algorithms don't kill people

974
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:16,830
robotic algorithms don't kill people
 

975
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,710
robotic algorithms don't kill people
developers of the right account or there

976
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:18,720
developers of the right account or there
 

977
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,570
developers of the right account or there
was kill people right I mean one of the

978
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:20,580
was kill people right I mean one of the
 

979
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,789
was kill people right I mean one of the
things as people are still in the loop

980
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:22,799
things as people are still in the loop
 

981
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,599
things as people are still in the loop
and at least in the near and midterm I

982
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:26,609
and at least in the near and midterm I
 

983
00:21:26,609 --> 00:21:28,789
and at least in the near and midterm I
think people will still be in the loop

984
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:28,799
think people will still be in the loop
 

985
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,320
think people will still be in the loop
at some point even if it's a developer

986
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:30,330
at some point even if it's a developer
 

987
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,759
at some point even if it's a developer
like we're not necessarily at the stage

988
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:31,769
like we're not necessarily at the stage
 

989
00:21:31,769 --> 00:21:34,989
like we're not necessarily at the stage
where you know robots are programming

990
00:21:34,989 --> 00:21:34,999
where you know robots are programming
 

991
00:21:34,999 --> 00:21:37,399
where you know robots are programming
autonomous robots with different

992
00:21:37,399 --> 00:21:37,409
autonomous robots with different
 

993
00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:40,940
autonomous robots with different
behaviors quite yet not so scary notion

994
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:40,950
behaviors quite yet not so scary notion
 

995
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:44,919
behaviors quite yet not so scary notion
sorry to interrupt that a developer is

996
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:44,929
sorry to interrupt that a developer is
 

997
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:48,529
sorry to interrupt that a developer is
has some responsibility in in it in the

998
00:21:48,529 --> 00:21:48,539
has some responsibility in in it in the
 

999
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:50,930
has some responsibility in in it in the
death of a human being this uh I mean I

1000
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:50,940
death of a human being this uh I mean I
 

1001
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:54,589
death of a human being this uh I mean I
think that's why the whole aspect of

1002
00:21:54,589 --> 00:21:54,599
think that's why the whole aspect of
 

1003
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:57,200
think that's why the whole aspect of
ethics in our community is so so

1004
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:57,210
ethics in our community is so so
 

1005
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:59,749
ethics in our community is so so
important right like because it's true

1006
00:21:59,749 --> 00:21:59,759
important right like because it's true
 

1007
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:03,469
important right like because it's true
if if you think about it you can

1008
00:22:03,469 --> 00:22:03,479
if if you think about it you can
 

1009
00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:06,080
if if you think about it you can
basically say I'm not going to work on

1010
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,090
basically say I'm not going to work on
 

1011
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:08,269
basically say I'm not going to work on
weaponized AI right like people can say

1012
00:22:08,269 --> 00:22:08,279
weaponized AI right like people can say
 

1013
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:09,650
weaponized AI right like people can say
that's not what I'm

1014
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:09,660
that's not what I'm
 

1015
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,650
that's not what I'm
but yet you are programming algorithms

1016
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:12,660
but yet you are programming algorithms
 

1017
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,200
but yet you are programming algorithms
that might be used in healthcare

1018
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:14,210
that might be used in healthcare
 

1019
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:16,640
that might be used in healthcare
algorithms that might decide whether

1020
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:16,650
algorithms that might decide whether
 

1021
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,110
algorithms that might decide whether
this person should get this medication

1022
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:18,120
this person should get this medication
 

1023
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,840
this person should get this medication
or not and they don't and they die you

1024
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:20,850
or not and they don't and they die you
 

1025
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:23,980
or not and they don't and they die you
okay so that is your responsibility

1026
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:23,990
okay so that is your responsibility
 

1027
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:26,450
okay so that is your responsibility
right and if you're not conscious and

1028
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:26,460
right and if you're not conscious and
 

1029
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:29,270
right and if you're not conscious and
aware that you do have that power when

1030
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:29,280
aware that you do have that power when
 

1031
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,430
aware that you do have that power when
you're coding and things like that I

1032
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:31,440
you're coding and things like that I
 

1033
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,550
you're coding and things like that I
think that's that's that's just not a

1034
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:34,560
think that's that's that's just not a
 

1035
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,650
think that's that's that's just not a
good thing like we need to think about

1036
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:36,660
good thing like we need to think about
 

1037
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,320
good thing like we need to think about
this responsibility as we program robots

1038
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:39,330
this responsibility as we program robots
 

1039
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:42,740
this responsibility as we program robots
and and computing devices much more than

1040
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:42,750
and and computing devices much more than
 

1041
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,920
and and computing devices much more than
we are yes so it's not an option to not

1042
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:45,930
we are yes so it's not an option to not
 

1043
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,570
we are yes so it's not an option to not
think about ethics I think it's a

1044
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:47,580
think about ethics I think it's a
 

1045
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:50,530
think about ethics I think it's a
majority I would say of computer science

1046
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:50,540
majority I would say of computer science
 

1047
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:53,360
majority I would say of computer science
sort of there it's kind of a hot topic

1048
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:53,370
sort of there it's kind of a hot topic
 

1049
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,790
sort of there it's kind of a hot topic
now I think about bias and so on but

1050
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:55,800
now I think about bias and so on but
 

1051
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,190
now I think about bias and so on but
it's and we'll talk about it but usually

1052
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:58,200
it's and we'll talk about it but usually
 

1053
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,340
it's and we'll talk about it but usually
it's kind of you it's like a very

1054
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:01,350
it's kind of you it's like a very
 

1055
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,140
it's kind of you it's like a very
particular group of people that work on

1056
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:03,150
particular group of people that work on
 

1057
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:05,990
particular group of people that work on
that and then people who do like

1058
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:06,000
that and then people who do like
 

1059
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,670
that and then people who do like
robotics or like well I don't have to

1060
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:07,680
robotics or like well I don't have to
 

1061
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,620
robotics or like well I don't have to
think about that you know there's other

1062
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:09,630
think about that you know there's other
 

1063
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,660
think about that you know there's other
smart people thinking about it it seems

1064
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:11,670
smart people thinking about it it seems
 

1065
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:14,150
smart people thinking about it it seems
that everybody has to think about it

1066
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:14,160
that everybody has to think about it
 

1067
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,790
that everybody has to think about it
it's not you can't escape the ethics

1068
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:16,800
it's not you can't escape the ethics
 

1069
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,360
it's not you can't escape the ethics
well there is bias or just every aspect

1070
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:20,370
well there is bias or just every aspect
 

1071
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:22,250
well there is bias or just every aspect
of ethics that has to do with human

1072
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:22,260
of ethics that has to do with human
 

1073
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,590
of ethics that has to do with human
beings everyone so think about I'm gonna

1074
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:24,600
beings everyone so think about I'm gonna
 

1075
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,100
beings everyone so think about I'm gonna
age myself but I remember when we didn't

1076
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:28,110
age myself but I remember when we didn't
 

1077
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:30,590
age myself but I remember when we didn't
have like testers right and so what did

1078
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:30,600
have like testers right and so what did
 

1079
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,390
have like testers right and so what did
you do as a developer you had to test

1080
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:32,400
you do as a developer you had to test
 

1081
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,130
you do as a developer you had to test
your own code right like you had to go

1082
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:34,140
your own code right like you had to go
 

1083
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,810
your own code right like you had to go
through all the cases and figure it out

1084
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:35,820
through all the cases and figure it out
 

1085
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,550
through all the cases and figure it out
and you know and then they realize that

1086
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:37,560
and you know and then they realize that
 

1087
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,980
and you know and then they realize that
you know like we probably need to have

1088
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:39,990
you know like we probably need to have
 

1089
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,570
you know like we probably need to have
testing because we're not getting all

1090
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:41,580
testing because we're not getting all
 

1091
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,490
testing because we're not getting all
the things and so from there what

1092
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:43,500
the things and so from there what
 

1093
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,680
the things and so from there what
happens is like most developers they do

1094
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:45,690
happens is like most developers they do
 

1095
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,510
happens is like most developers they do
you know a little bit of testing but is

1096
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:47,520
you know a little bit of testing but is
 

1097
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,340
you know a little bit of testing but is
usually like okay - my compiler bug out

1098
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:49,350
usually like okay - my compiler bug out
 

1099
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,470
usually like okay - my compiler bug out
and you look at the warnings okay is

1100
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:51,480
and you look at the warnings okay is
 

1101
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,600
and you look at the warnings okay is
that acceptable or not right like that's

1102
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:53,610
that acceptable or not right like that's
 

1103
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:55,190
that acceptable or not right like that's
how you typically think about as a

1104
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:55,200
how you typically think about as a
 

1105
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,320
how you typically think about as a
developer and you'll just assume that is

1106
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:57,330
developer and you'll just assume that is
 

1107
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:59,270
developer and you'll just assume that is
going to go to another process and

1108
00:23:59,270 --> 00:23:59,280
going to go to another process and
 

1109
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,760
going to go to another process and
they're gonna test it out but I think we

1110
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:01,770
they're gonna test it out but I think we
 

1111
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:04,490
they're gonna test it out but I think we
need to go back to those early days when

1112
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:04,500
need to go back to those early days when
 

1113
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,920
need to go back to those early days when
you know you're a developer you're

1114
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:06,930
you know you're a developer you're
 

1115
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:08,630
you know you're a developer you're
developing there should be like they say

1116
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:08,640
developing there should be like they say
 

1117
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,060
developing there should be like they say
you know okay let me look at the ethical

1118
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:11,070
you know okay let me look at the ethical
 

1119
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:13,250
you know okay let me look at the ethical
outcomes of this because there isn't a

1120
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:13,260
outcomes of this because there isn't a
 

1121
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,860
outcomes of this because there isn't a
second like testing ethical testers

1122
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:15,870
second like testing ethical testers
 

1123
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:19,460
second like testing ethical testers
right it's you we did it back in the

1124
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:19,470
right it's you we did it back in the
 

1125
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:21,800
right it's you we did it back in the
early coding days I think that's where

1126
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:21,810
early coding days I think that's where
 

1127
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:22,730
early coding days I think that's where
we are with respect

1128
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:22,740
we are with respect
 

1129
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,310
we are with respect
to ethics like this go back to what was

1130
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:25,320
to ethics like this go back to what was
 

1131
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,260
to ethics like this go back to what was
good practice isn't only because we were

1132
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:27,270
good practice isn't only because we were
 

1133
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:30,100
good practice isn't only because we were
just developing the field

1134
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:30,110
just developing the field
 

1135
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:33,590
just developing the field
yeah and it's uh it's a really heavy

1136
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:33,600
yeah and it's uh it's a really heavy
 

1137
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,049
yeah and it's uh it's a really heavy
burden I've had to feel it recently in

1138
00:24:36,049 --> 00:24:36,059
burden I've had to feel it recently in
 

1139
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:38,480
burden I've had to feel it recently in
the last few months but I think it's a

1140
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:38,490
the last few months but I think it's a
 

1141
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:39,950
the last few months but I think it's a
good one to feel like I've gotten a

1142
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:39,960
good one to feel like I've gotten a
 

1143
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,490
good one to feel like I've gotten a
message more than one from people you

1144
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:43,500
message more than one from people you
 

1145
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,980
message more than one from people you
know I've unfortunately gotten some

1146
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:45,990
know I've unfortunately gotten some
 

1147
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:49,399
know I've unfortunately gotten some
attention recently and I've got messages

1148
00:24:49,399 --> 00:24:49,409
attention recently and I've got messages
 

1149
00:24:49,409 --> 00:24:51,580
attention recently and I've got messages
that say that I have blood on my hands

1150
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:51,590
that say that I have blood on my hands
 

1151
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,590
that say that I have blood on my hands
because of working on semi autonomous

1152
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:54,600
because of working on semi autonomous
 

1153
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:58,399
because of working on semi autonomous
vehicles so the idea that you have semi

1154
00:24:58,399 --> 00:24:58,409
vehicles so the idea that you have semi
 

1155
00:24:58,409 --> 00:25:00,470
vehicles so the idea that you have semi
autonomy means people will become would

1156
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:00,480
autonomy means people will become would
 

1157
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,960
autonomy means people will become would
lose vigilance and so on as actually be

1158
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:02,970
lose vigilance and so on as actually be
 

1159
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:05,810
lose vigilance and so on as actually be
humans as we described and because of

1160
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:05,820
humans as we described and because of
 

1161
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,450
humans as we described and because of
that because of this idea that we're

1162
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:08,460
that because of this idea that we're
 

1163
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,519
that because of this idea that we're
creating automation there will be people

1164
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:10,529
creating automation there will be people
 

1165
00:25:10,529 --> 00:25:13,669
creating automation there will be people
be hurt because of it and I think that's

1166
00:25:13,669 --> 00:25:13,679
be hurt because of it and I think that's
 

1167
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,380
be hurt because of it and I think that's
a beautiful thing I mean it's you know

1168
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:15,390
a beautiful thing I mean it's you know
 

1169
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:17,180
a beautiful thing I mean it's you know
it's many nights where I wasn't able to

1170
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:17,190
it's many nights where I wasn't able to
 

1171
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:19,010
it's many nights where I wasn't able to
sleep because of this notion you know

1172
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:19,020
sleep because of this notion you know
 

1173
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,799
sleep because of this notion you know
you really do think about people that

1174
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:21,809
you really do think about people that
 

1175
00:25:21,809 --> 00:25:23,570
you really do think about people that
might die because it's technology of

1176
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:23,580
might die because it's technology of
 

1177
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,490
might die because it's technology of
course you can then start rationalizing

1178
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:25,500
course you can then start rationalizing
 

1179
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,950
course you can then start rationalizing
saying well you know what 40,000 people

1180
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:27,960
saying well you know what 40,000 people
 

1181
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,720
saying well you know what 40,000 people
die in the United States every year and

1182
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:29,730
die in the United States every year and
 

1183
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:31,730
die in the United States every year and
we're trying to ultimately try to save

1184
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:31,740
we're trying to ultimately try to save
 

1185
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,760
we're trying to ultimately try to save
us but the reality is your code you've

1186
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:34,770
us but the reality is your code you've
 

1187
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:36,919
us but the reality is your code you've
written might kill somebody and that's

1188
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:36,929
written might kill somebody and that's
 

1189
00:25:36,929 --> 00:25:39,019
written might kill somebody and that's
an important burden to carry with you as

1190
00:25:39,019 --> 00:25:39,029
an important burden to carry with you as
 

1191
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:42,080
an important burden to carry with you as
you design the code I don't even think

1192
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:42,090
you design the code I don't even think
 

1193
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:45,080
you design the code I don't even think
of it as a burden if we train this

1194
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:45,090
of it as a burden if we train this
 

1195
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:47,630
of it as a burden if we train this
concept correctly from the beginning and

1196
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:47,640
concept correctly from the beginning and
 

1197
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,970
concept correctly from the beginning and
I use and not to say that coding is like

1198
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:49,980
I use and not to say that coding is like
 

1199
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,100
I use and not to say that coding is like
being a medical doctor the thing about

1200
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:52,110
being a medical doctor the thing about
 

1201
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:55,370
being a medical doctor the thing about
it medical doctors if they've been in

1202
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:55,380
it medical doctors if they've been in
 

1203
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,230
it medical doctors if they've been in
situations where their patient didn't

1204
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:57,240
situations where their patient didn't
 

1205
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,260
situations where their patient didn't
survive right do they give up and go

1206
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:00,270
survive right do they give up and go
 

1207
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:02,690
survive right do they give up and go
away no every time they come in they

1208
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:02,700
away no every time they come in they
 

1209
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,909
away no every time they come in they
know that there might be a possibility

1210
00:26:04,909 --> 00:26:04,919
know that there might be a possibility
 

1211
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:07,220
know that there might be a possibility
that this patient might not survive and

1212
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:07,230
that this patient might not survive and
 

1213
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:09,409
that this patient might not survive and
so when they approach every decision

1214
00:26:09,409 --> 00:26:09,419
so when they approach every decision
 

1215
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:11,539
so when they approach every decision
like that's in their back of their head

1216
00:26:11,539 --> 00:26:11,549
like that's in their back of their head
 

1217
00:26:11,549 --> 00:26:15,320
like that's in their back of their head
and so why isn't that we aren't teaching

1218
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:15,330
and so why isn't that we aren't teaching
 

1219
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:17,330
and so why isn't that we aren't teaching
and those are tools though right they're

1220
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:17,340
and those are tools though right they're
 

1221
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,610
and those are tools though right they're
given some of the tools to address that

1222
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:19,620
given some of the tools to address that
 

1223
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,159
given some of the tools to address that
so that they don't go crazy but we don't

1224
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:22,169
so that they don't go crazy but we don't
 

1225
00:26:22,169 --> 00:26:25,310
so that they don't go crazy but we don't
give those tools so that it does feel

1226
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:25,320
give those tools so that it does feel
 

1227
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,860
give those tools so that it does feel
like a burden versus something of I have

1228
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:27,870
like a burden versus something of I have
 

1229
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:29,960
like a burden versus something of I have
a great gift and I can do great awesome

1230
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:29,970
a great gift and I can do great awesome
 

1231
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:32,240
a great gift and I can do great awesome
good but with it comes great

1232
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:32,250
good but with it comes great
 

1233
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:34,730
good but with it comes great
responsibility I mean that's what we

1234
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:34,740
responsibility I mean that's what we
 

1235
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,350
responsibility I mean that's what we
teach in terms of you think about

1236
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:36,360
teach in terms of you think about
 

1237
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,090
teach in terms of you think about
medical schools right great gift great

1238
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:38,100
medical schools right great gift great
 

1239
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,250
medical schools right great gift great
responsibility I think if we just

1240
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:40,260
responsibility I think if we just
 

1241
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,350
responsibility I think if we just
changed the messaging a little great

1242
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:42,360
changed the messaging a little great
 

1243
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,720
changed the messaging a little great
gift being a developer great

1244
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:44,730
gift being a developer great
 

1245
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:46,720
gift being a developer great
responsibility and this is how you

1246
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:46,730
responsibility and this is how you
 

1247
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,880
responsibility and this is how you
combine those but do you think and this

1248
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:49,890
combine those but do you think and this
 

1249
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:51,310
combine those but do you think and this
is really interesting

1250
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:51,320
is really interesting
 

1251
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,930
is really interesting
it's it's outside I actually have no

1252
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:53,940
it's it's outside I actually have no
 

1253
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:57,430
it's it's outside I actually have no
friends or sort of surgeons or doctors I

1254
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:57,440
friends or sort of surgeons or doctors I
 

1255
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,710
friends or sort of surgeons or doctors I
mean what does it feel like to make a

1256
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:00,720
mean what does it feel like to make a
 

1257
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,140
mean what does it feel like to make a
mistake in a surgery and somebody to die

1258
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:03,150
mistake in a surgery and somebody to die
 

1259
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:04,340
mistake in a surgery and somebody to die
because of that

1260
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:04,350
because of that
 

1261
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,140
because of that
like is that something you could be

1262
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:06,150
like is that something you could be
 

1263
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:08,090
like is that something you could be
taught in medical school sort of how to

1264
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:08,100
taught in medical school sort of how to
 

1265
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,360
taught in medical school sort of how to
be accepting of that risk so because I

1266
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:11,370
be accepting of that risk so because I
 

1267
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:13,580
be accepting of that risk so because I
do a lot of work with health care

1268
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:13,590
do a lot of work with health care
 

1269
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:17,000
do a lot of work with health care
robotics I I have not lost a patient for

1270
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,010
robotics I I have not lost a patient for
 

1271
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,190
robotics I I have not lost a patient for
example the first one's always the

1272
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:19,200
example the first one's always the
 

1273
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:25,330
example the first one's always the
hardest right but they really teach the

1274
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:25,340
hardest right but they really teach the
 

1275
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:28,130
hardest right but they really teach the
value right so they teach responsibility

1276
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:28,140
value right so they teach responsibility
 

1277
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:31,270
value right so they teach responsibility
but they also teach the value like

1278
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:31,280
but they also teach the value like
 

1279
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:35,539
but they also teach the value like
you're saving 40,000 mm but in order to

1280
00:27:35,539 --> 00:27:35,549
you're saving 40,000 mm but in order to
 

1281
00:27:35,549 --> 00:27:38,570
you're saving 40,000 mm but in order to
really feel good about that when you

1282
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:38,580
really feel good about that when you
 

1283
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,940
really feel good about that when you
come to a decision you have to be able

1284
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:40,950
come to a decision you have to be able
 

1285
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:43,280
come to a decision you have to be able
to say at the end I did all that I could

1286
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:43,290
to say at the end I did all that I could
 

1287
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:46,640
to say at the end I did all that I could
possibly do right versus a well I just

1288
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:46,650
possibly do right versus a well I just
 

1289
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:49,250
possibly do right versus a well I just
picked the first widget and right like

1290
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:49,260
picked the first widget and right like
 

1291
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,230
picked the first widget and right like
so every decision is actually thought

1292
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:51,240
so every decision is actually thought
 

1293
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,930
so every decision is actually thought
through it's not a habit is not a let me

1294
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:53,940
through it's not a habit is not a let me
 

1295
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,580
through it's not a habit is not a let me
just take the best algorithm that my

1296
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:55,590
just take the best algorithm that my
 

1297
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,400
just take the best algorithm that my
friend gave me right it's a is this it

1298
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:58,410
friend gave me right it's a is this it
 

1299
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,710
friend gave me right it's a is this it
this this the best have I done my best

1300
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:00,720
this this the best have I done my best
 

1301
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,100
this this the best have I done my best
to do good right and so you're right and

1302
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:04,110
to do good right and so you're right and
 

1303
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:06,650
to do good right and so you're right and
I think burden is the wrong word if it's

1304
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:06,660
I think burden is the wrong word if it's
 

1305
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:09,680
I think burden is the wrong word if it's
a gift but you have to treat it

1306
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:09,690
a gift but you have to treat it
 

1307
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:10,700
a gift but you have to treat it
extremely seriously

1308
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:10,710
extremely seriously
 

1309
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:14,539
extremely seriously
correct so on a slightly related note

1310
00:28:14,539 --> 00:28:14,549
correct so on a slightly related note
 

1311
00:28:14,549 --> 00:28:17,000
correct so on a slightly related note
yeah in a recent paper the ugly truth

1312
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,010
yeah in a recent paper the ugly truth
 

1313
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:19,240
yeah in a recent paper the ugly truth
about ourselves and our robot creations

1314
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:19,250
about ourselves and our robot creations
 

1315
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:23,180
about ourselves and our robot creations
you you discuss you highlight some

1316
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:23,190
you you discuss you highlight some
 

1317
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:25,520
you you discuss you highlight some
biases that may affect the function in

1318
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:25,530
biases that may affect the function in
 

1319
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:27,560
biases that may affect the function in
various robotics systems can you talk

1320
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:27,570
various robotics systems can you talk
 

1321
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:29,659
various robotics systems can you talk
through if you remember examples or some

1322
00:28:29,659 --> 00:28:29,669
through if you remember examples or some
 

1323
00:28:29,669 --> 00:28:31,880
through if you remember examples or some
there's a lot of examples I use what is

1324
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:31,890
there's a lot of examples I use what is
 

1325
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:36,370
there's a lot of examples I use what is
bias first of all yes so bias is this

1326
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:36,380
bias first of all yes so bias is this
 

1327
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,390
bias first of all yes so bias is this
and so bias which is different than

1328
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:38,400
and so bias which is different than
 

1329
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,159
and so bias which is different than
prejudice so bias is that we all have

1330
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:40,169
prejudice so bias is that we all have
 

1331
00:28:40,169 --> 00:28:41,860
prejudice so bias is that we all have
these preconceived notions about

1332
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:41,870
these preconceived notions about
 

1333
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:44,960
these preconceived notions about
particular everything from particular

1334
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:44,970
particular everything from particular
 

1335
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:49,520
particular everything from particular
groups for to habits to identity right

1336
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:49,530
groups for to habits to identity right
 

1337
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:50,299
groups for to habits to identity right
so we have these

1338
00:28:50,299 --> 00:28:50,309
so we have these
 

1339
00:28:50,309 --> 00:28:53,570
so we have these
predispositions and so when we address a

1340
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:53,580
predispositions and so when we address a
 

1341
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,009
predispositions and so when we address a
problem we look at a problem make a

1342
00:28:55,009 --> 00:28:55,019
problem we look at a problem make a
 

1343
00:28:55,019 --> 00:28:58,029
problem we look at a problem make a
decision those preconceived notions

1344
00:28:58,029 --> 00:28:58,039
decision those preconceived notions
 

1345
00:28:58,039 --> 00:29:01,430
decision those preconceived notions
might affect our our outputs or outcomes

1346
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:01,440
might affect our our outputs or outcomes
 

1347
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,070
might affect our our outputs or outcomes
so they're the bias could be positive or

1348
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:04,080
so they're the bias could be positive or
 

1349
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,799
so they're the bias could be positive or
negative and then it's prejudice the

1350
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:06,809
negative and then it's prejudice the
 

1351
00:29:06,809 --> 00:29:08,989
negative and then it's prejudice the
negative courage is the negative right

1352
00:29:08,989 --> 00:29:08,999
negative courage is the negative right
 

1353
00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:11,749
negative courage is the negative right
so prejudice is that not only are you

1354
00:29:11,749 --> 00:29:11,759
so prejudice is that not only are you
 

1355
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:15,289
so prejudice is that not only are you
aware of your bias but you are then take

1356
00:29:15,289 --> 00:29:15,299
aware of your bias but you are then take
 

1357
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:18,950
aware of your bias but you are then take
it and have a negative outcome even

1358
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:18,960
it and have a negative outcome even
 

1359
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,839
it and have a negative outcome even
though you are aware wait and there

1360
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:20,849
though you are aware wait and there
 

1361
00:29:20,849 --> 00:29:24,799
though you are aware wait and there
could be gray areas too that's the

1362
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:24,809
could be gray areas too that's the
 

1363
00:29:24,809 --> 00:29:27,079
could be gray areas too that's the
challenging aspect of all questions

1364
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:27,089
challenging aspect of all questions
 

1365
00:29:27,089 --> 00:29:28,940
challenging aspect of all questions
actually so I always like so there's

1366
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:28,950
actually so I always like so there's
 

1367
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,709
actually so I always like so there's
there's a funny one and in fact I think

1368
00:29:30,709 --> 00:29:30,719
there's a funny one and in fact I think
 

1369
00:29:30,719 --> 00:29:32,060
there's a funny one and in fact I think
it might be in the paper because I think

1370
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:32,070
it might be in the paper because I think
 

1371
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,249
it might be in the paper because I think
I talked about self-driving cars but

1372
00:29:34,249 --> 00:29:34,259
I talked about self-driving cars but
 

1373
00:29:34,259 --> 00:29:38,889
I talked about self-driving cars but
think about this we for teenagers right

1374
00:29:38,889 --> 00:29:38,899
think about this we for teenagers right
 

1375
00:29:38,899 --> 00:29:42,889
think about this we for teenagers right
typically we insurance companies charge

1376
00:29:42,889 --> 00:29:42,899
typically we insurance companies charge
 

1377
00:29:42,899 --> 00:29:44,899
typically we insurance companies charge
quite a bit of money if you have a

1378
00:29:44,899 --> 00:29:44,909
quite a bit of money if you have a
 

1379
00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:47,959
quite a bit of money if you have a
teenage driver so you could say that's

1380
00:29:47,959 --> 00:29:47,969
teenage driver so you could say that's
 

1381
00:29:47,969 --> 00:29:52,310
teenage driver so you could say that's
an age bias right but no one will click

1382
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:52,320
an age bias right but no one will click
 

1383
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,499
an age bias right but no one will click
I mean parents will be grumpy but no one

1384
00:29:54,499 --> 00:29:54,509
I mean parents will be grumpy but no one
 

1385
00:29:54,509 --> 00:29:58,399
I mean parents will be grumpy but no one
really says that that's not fair

1386
00:29:58,399 --> 00:29:58,409
really says that that's not fair
 

1387
00:29:58,409 --> 00:30:00,739
really says that that's not fair
that's interesting we don't that's right

1388
00:30:00,739 --> 00:30:00,749
that's interesting we don't that's right
 

1389
00:30:00,749 --> 00:30:01,430
that's interesting we don't that's right
that's right

1390
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:01,440
that's right
 

1391
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,820
that's right
it's a everybody in human factors and

1392
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:04,830
it's a everybody in human factors and
 

1393
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:09,289
it's a everybody in human factors and
safety research almost I mean it's quite

1394
00:30:09,289 --> 00:30:09,299
safety research almost I mean it's quite
 

1395
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:13,070
safety research almost I mean it's quite
ruthlessly critical of teenagers and we

1396
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:13,080
ruthlessly critical of teenagers and we
 

1397
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,289
ruthlessly critical of teenagers and we
don't question is that okay is that okay

1398
00:30:15,289 --> 00:30:15,299
don't question is that okay is that okay
 

1399
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:17,329
don't question is that okay is that okay
to be ageist in this kind of way it is

1400
00:30:17,329 --> 00:30:17,339
to be ageist in this kind of way it is
 

1401
00:30:17,339 --> 00:30:19,190
to be ageist in this kind of way it is
and it is agent right is that really

1402
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:19,200
and it is agent right is that really
 

1403
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,369
and it is agent right is that really
there's no question about it and so so

1404
00:30:22,369 --> 00:30:22,379
there's no question about it and so so
 

1405
00:30:22,379 --> 00:30:24,379
there's no question about it and so so
these are these this is the gray area

1406
00:30:24,379 --> 00:30:24,389
these are these this is the gray area
 

1407
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:28,279
these are these this is the gray area
right cuz you you know that you know

1408
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:28,289
right cuz you you know that you know
 

1409
00:30:28,289 --> 00:30:30,139
right cuz you you know that you know
teenagers are more likely to be an

1410
00:30:30,139 --> 00:30:30,149
teenagers are more likely to be an
 

1411
00:30:30,149 --> 00:30:32,089
teenagers are more likely to be an
accident and so there's actually some

1412
00:30:32,089 --> 00:30:32,099
accident and so there's actually some
 

1413
00:30:32,099 --> 00:30:33,769
accident and so there's actually some
data to it but then if you take that

1414
00:30:33,769 --> 00:30:33,779
data to it but then if you take that
 

1415
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:37,459
data to it but then if you take that
same example and you say well I'm going

1416
00:30:37,459 --> 00:30:37,469
same example and you say well I'm going
 

1417
00:30:37,469 --> 00:30:41,930
same example and you say well I'm going
to make the insurance hire for an area

1418
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:41,940
to make the insurance hire for an area
 

1419
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,089
to make the insurance hire for an area
of Boston because there's a lot of

1420
00:30:44,089 --> 00:30:44,099
of Boston because there's a lot of
 

1421
00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:46,009
of Boston because there's a lot of
accidents and then they find out that

1422
00:30:46,009 --> 00:30:46,019
accidents and then they find out that
 

1423
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:49,549
accidents and then they find out that
that's correlated with socio economics

1424
00:30:49,549 --> 00:30:49,559
that's correlated with socio economics
 

1425
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:52,190
that's correlated with socio economics
well then it becomes a problem right

1426
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:52,200
well then it becomes a problem right
 

1427
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,279
well then it becomes a problem right
like that is not acceptable

1428
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:54,289
like that is not acceptable
 

1429
00:30:54,289 --> 00:30:58,969
like that is not acceptable
but yet the teenager which is age it's

1430
00:30:58,969 --> 00:30:58,979
but yet the teenager which is age it's
 

1431
00:30:58,979 --> 00:31:02,960
but yet the teenager which is age it's
against age is right so we figure that I

1432
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:02,970
against age is right so we figure that I
 

1433
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:03,810
against age is right so we figure that I
was I

1434
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:03,820
was I
 

1435
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,940
was I
by having conversations by the discourse

1436
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:05,950
by having conversations by the discourse
 

1437
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:08,220
by having conversations by the discourse
let me throw out history the definition

1438
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:08,230
let me throw out history the definition
 

1439
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:11,190
let me throw out history the definition
of what is ethical or not has changed

1440
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:11,200
of what is ethical or not has changed
 

1441
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,950
of what is ethical or not has changed
and hopefully always for the better

1442
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:13,960
and hopefully always for the better
 

1443
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,180
and hopefully always for the better
correct correct

1444
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:15,190
correct correct
 

1445
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:19,770

so in terms of bias or prejudice in

1446
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:19,780
so in terms of bias or prejudice in
 

1447
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:23,790
so in terms of bias or prejudice in
robotic in algorithms what what examples

1448
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:23,800
robotic in algorithms what what examples
 

1449
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,830
robotic in algorithms what what examples
do sometimes think about so I think

1450
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:25,840
do sometimes think about so I think
 

1451
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,230
do sometimes think about so I think
about quite a bit the medical domain

1452
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:28,240
about quite a bit the medical domain
 

1453
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,440
about quite a bit the medical domain
just because historically right the

1454
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:31,450
just because historically right the
 

1455
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:33,860
just because historically right the
healthcare domain has had these biases

1456
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:33,870
healthcare domain has had these biases
 

1457
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:38,130
healthcare domain has had these biases
typically based on gender and ethnicity

1458
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:38,140
typically based on gender and ethnicity
 

1459
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:41,670
typically based on gender and ethnicity
primarily a little an age but not so

1460
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:41,680
primarily a little an age but not so
 

1461
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:45,270
primarily a little an age but not so
much you know historically if you think

1462
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:45,280
much you know historically if you think
 

1463
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:49,770
much you know historically if you think
about FDA and drug trials it's you know

1464
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:49,780
about FDA and drug trials it's you know
 

1465
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:53,130
about FDA and drug trials it's you know
harder to find a woman that you know

1466
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:53,140
harder to find a woman that you know
 

1467
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:55,110
harder to find a woman that you know
aren't childbearing and so you may not

1468
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:55,120
aren't childbearing and so you may not
 

1469
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,300
aren't childbearing and so you may not
test on drugs at the same level right so

1470
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:57,310
test on drugs at the same level right so
 

1471
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:59,730
test on drugs at the same level right so
there there's these things and so if you

1472
00:31:59,730 --> 00:31:59,740
there there's these things and so if you
 

1473
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:03,390
there there's these things and so if you
think about robotics right something as

1474
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:03,400
think about robotics right something as
 

1475
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,970
think about robotics right something as
simple as I'd like to design an

1476
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:05,980
simple as I'd like to design an
 

1477
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:08,400
simple as I'd like to design an
exoskeleton right what should the

1478
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:08,410
exoskeleton right what should the
 

1479
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:10,290
exoskeleton right what should the
material be what should the way P which

1480
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:10,300
material be what should the way P which
 

1481
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:14,430
material be what should the way P which
should the form factor be are you who

1482
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:14,440
should the form factor be are you who
 

1483
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,370
should the form factor be are you who
are you going to design it around I will

1484
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:17,380
are you going to design it around I will
 

1485
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:19,950
are you going to design it around I will
say that in the US you know women

1486
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:19,960
say that in the US you know women
 

1487
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,020
say that in the US you know women
average height and weight is slightly

1488
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:22,030
average height and weight is slightly
 

1489
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:24,450
average height and weight is slightly
different than guys so who are you gonna

1490
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:24,460
different than guys so who are you gonna
 

1491
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:27,570
different than guys so who are you gonna
choose like if you're not thinking about

1492
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:27,580
choose like if you're not thinking about
 

1493
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:30,570
choose like if you're not thinking about
it from the beginning as you know okay I

1494
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:30,580
it from the beginning as you know okay I
 

1495
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,790
it from the beginning as you know okay I
when I design this and I look at the

1496
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:32,800
when I design this and I look at the
 

1497
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,440
when I design this and I look at the
algorithms and I design the control

1498
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:34,450
algorithms and I design the control
 

1499
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:36,600
algorithms and I design the control
system and the forces and the torques if

1500
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:36,610
system and the forces and the torques if
 

1501
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:39,090
system and the forces and the torques if
you're not thinking about well you have

1502
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:39,100
you're not thinking about well you have
 

1503
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,790
you're not thinking about well you have
different types of body structure you're

1504
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:41,800
different types of body structure you're
 

1505
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,560
different types of body structure you're
gonna design to you know what you're

1506
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:43,570
gonna design to you know what you're
 

1507
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:46,650
gonna design to you know what you're
used to oh this fits my all the folks in

1508
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:46,660
used to oh this fits my all the folks in
 

1509
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:49,230
used to oh this fits my all the folks in
my lab right so think about it from the

1510
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:49,240
my lab right so think about it from the
 

1511
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,780
my lab right so think about it from the
very beginning it's important what about

1512
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:51,790
very beginning it's important what about
 

1513
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,970
very beginning it's important what about
sort of algorithms that train on data

1514
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:53,980
sort of algorithms that train on data
 

1515
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:57,600
sort of algorithms that train on data
kind of thing the sadly our society

1516
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:57,610
kind of thing the sadly our society
 

1517
00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:00,810
kind of thing the sadly our society
already has a lot of negative bias and

1518
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:00,820
already has a lot of negative bias and
 

1519
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:05,100
already has a lot of negative bias and
so if we collect a lot of data even if

1520
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:05,110
so if we collect a lot of data even if
 

1521
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,780
so if we collect a lot of data even if
it's a balanced weight that's going to

1522
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:06,790
it's a balanced weight that's going to
 

1523
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:08,310
it's a balanced weight that's going to
contain the same bias that a society

1524
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:08,320
contain the same bias that a society
 

1525
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,970
contain the same bias that a society
contains and so yeah was is there is

1526
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:11,980
contains and so yeah was is there is
 

1527
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,650
contains and so yeah was is there is
there things there that bother you

1528
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:13,660
there things there that bother you
 

1529
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,750
there things there that bother you
yeah so you actually said something you

1530
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:15,760
yeah so you actually said something you
 

1531
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,060
yeah so you actually said something you
ain't said how

1532
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:18,070
ain't said how
 

1533
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:20,910
ain't said how
we have biases but hopefully we learn

1534
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:20,920
we have biases but hopefully we learn
 

1535
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,100
we have biases but hopefully we learn
from them and we become better right and

1536
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:23,110
from them and we become better right and
 

1537
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:25,650
from them and we become better right and
so that's where we are now right so the

1538
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:25,660
so that's where we are now right so the
 

1539
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:28,110
so that's where we are now right so the
data that we're collecting is historic

1540
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:28,120
data that we're collecting is historic
 

1541
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,240
data that we're collecting is historic
it's so it's based on these things when

1542
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:30,250
it's so it's based on these things when
 

1543
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,730
it's so it's based on these things when
we knew it was bad to discriminate but

1544
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:32,740
we knew it was bad to discriminate but
 

1545
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,410
we knew it was bad to discriminate but
that's the data we have and we're trying

1546
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:34,420
that's the data we have and we're trying
 

1547
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:37,020
that's the data we have and we're trying
to fix it now but we're fixing it based

1548
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:37,030
to fix it now but we're fixing it based
 

1549
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:38,940
to fix it now but we're fixing it based
on the data that was used in the first

1550
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:38,950
on the data that was used in the first
 

1551
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:43,260
on the data that was used in the first
place most right and so and so the

1552
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:43,270
place most right and so and so the
 

1553
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,820
place most right and so and so the
decisions and you can look at everything

1554
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:44,830
decisions and you can look at everything
 

1555
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,950
decisions and you can look at everything
from the hope the whole aspect of

1556
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:46,960
from the hope the whole aspect of
 

1557
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,540
from the hope the whole aspect of
predictive policing criminal recidivism

1558
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:50,550
predictive policing criminal recidivism
 

1559
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:53,070
predictive policing criminal recidivism
there was a recent paper that had the

1560
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:53,080
there was a recent paper that had the
 

1561
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,320
there was a recent paper that had the
healthcare algorithms which had kind of

1562
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:55,330
healthcare algorithms which had kind of
 

1563
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:59,300
healthcare algorithms which had kind of
a sensational titles I'm not pro

1564
00:33:59,300 --> 00:33:59,310
a sensational titles I'm not pro
 

1565
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:02,940
a sensational titles I'm not pro
sensationalism in titles but um but you

1566
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:02,950
sensationalism in titles but um but you
 

1567
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:05,670
sensationalism in titles but um but you
read it right so yeah make sure read it

1568
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:05,680
read it right so yeah make sure read it
 

1569
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:09,330
read it right so yeah make sure read it
but I'm like really like what's the

1570
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:09,340
but I'm like really like what's the
 

1571
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,130
but I'm like really like what's the
topic of the sensationalism I mean

1572
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:11,140
topic of the sensationalism I mean
 

1573
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:14,910
topic of the sensationalism I mean
what's underneath it what if you could

1574
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:14,920
what's underneath it what if you could
 

1575
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,220
what's underneath it what if you could
sort of educate me and what kind of bias

1576
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:17,230
sort of educate me and what kind of bias
 

1577
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:19,530
sort of educate me and what kind of bias
creeps into the healthcare space yes so

1578
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:19,540
creeps into the healthcare space yes so
 

1579
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:23,220
creeps into the healthcare space yes so
he's already kind of oh this one was the

1580
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:23,230
he's already kind of oh this one was the
 

1581
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:27,780
he's already kind of oh this one was the
headline was racist AI algorithms okay

1582
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:27,790
headline was racist AI algorithms okay
 

1583
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:29,580
headline was racist AI algorithms okay
like okay that's totally a clickbait

1584
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:29,590
like okay that's totally a clickbait
 

1585
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:32,100
like okay that's totally a clickbait
title yeah oh and so you looked at it

1586
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:32,110
title yeah oh and so you looked at it
 

1587
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:34,710
title yeah oh and so you looked at it
and so there was data that these

1588
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:34,720
and so there was data that these
 

1589
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,470
and so there was data that these
researchers had collected I believe I

1590
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:37,480
researchers had collected I believe I
 

1591
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,970
researchers had collected I believe I
want to say was either science or nature

1592
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:38,980
want to say was either science or nature
 

1593
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:41,040
want to say was either science or nature
he just was just published but they

1594
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:41,050
he just was just published but they
 

1595
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:42,510
he just was just published but they
didn't have the sensational tiger

1596
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:42,520
didn't have the sensational tiger
 

1597
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,600
didn't have the sensational tiger
it was like the media and so they had

1598
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:45,610
it was like the media and so they had
 

1599
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:49,130
it was like the media and so they had
looked at demographics I believe between

1600
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:49,140
looked at demographics I believe between
 

1601
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:52,530
looked at demographics I believe between
black and white women right and they

1602
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:52,540
black and white women right and they
 

1603
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:56,070
black and white women right and they
were showed that there was a discrepancy

1604
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:56,080
were showed that there was a discrepancy
 

1605
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:59,790
were showed that there was a discrepancy
in in the outcomes right and so and it

1606
00:34:59,790 --> 00:34:59,800
in in the outcomes right and so and it
 

1607
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,520
in in the outcomes right and so and it
was tied to ethnicity tied to race the

1608
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:02,530
was tied to ethnicity tied to race the
 

1609
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:04,860
was tied to ethnicity tied to race the
piece that the researchers did actually

1610
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:04,870
piece that the researchers did actually
 

1611
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:07,890
piece that the researchers did actually
went through the whole analysis but of

1612
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:07,900
went through the whole analysis but of
 

1613
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,870
went through the whole analysis but of
course I mean they're the journalists

1614
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:09,880
course I mean they're the journalists
 

1615
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,840
course I mean they're the journalists
with AI a problematic across the board

1616
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:12,850
with AI a problematic across the board
 

1617
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:15,300
with AI a problematic across the board
rights sake and so this is a problem

1618
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:15,310
rights sake and so this is a problem
 

1619
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:17,720
rights sake and so this is a problem
right and so there's this thing about

1620
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:17,730
right and so there's this thing about
 

1621
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:20,760
right and so there's this thing about
oai it has all these problems we're

1622
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:20,770
oai it has all these problems we're
 

1623
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:23,670
oai it has all these problems we're
doing it on historical data and the

1624
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:23,680
doing it on historical data and the
 

1625
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,010
doing it on historical data and the
outcomes aren't even based on gender or

1626
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:26,020
outcomes aren't even based on gender or
 

1627
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:29,910
outcomes aren't even based on gender or
ethnicity or age but I am always saying

1628
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:29,920
ethnicity or age but I am always saying
 

1629
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,930
ethnicity or age but I am always saying
is like yes

1630
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:30,940
is like yes
 

1631
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:33,270
is like yes
we need to do better right we need to do

1632
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:33,280
we need to do better right we need to do
 

1633
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,990
we need to do better right we need to do
better it is our duty to do better but

1634
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:37,000
better it is our duty to do better but
 

1635
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,780
better it is our duty to do better but
the worst AI is still better than us

1636
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:39,790
the worst AI is still better than us
 

1637
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:42,059
the worst AI is still better than us
like like you take the best of us and

1638
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:42,069
like like you take the best of us and
 

1639
00:35:42,069 --> 00:35:44,309
like like you take the best of us and
we're still worse than the worst AI at

1640
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:44,319
we're still worse than the worst AI at
 

1641
00:35:44,319 --> 00:35:45,720
we're still worse than the worst AI at
least in terms of these things and

1642
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:45,730
least in terms of these things and
 

1643
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:48,420
least in terms of these things and
that's actually not discussed right and

1644
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:48,430
that's actually not discussed right and
 

1645
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:50,309
that's actually not discussed right and
so I think and that's why the

1646
00:35:50,309 --> 00:35:50,319
so I think and that's why the
 

1647
00:35:50,319 --> 00:35:52,500
so I think and that's why the
sensational title right and it's so it's

1648
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:52,510
sensational title right and it's so it's
 

1649
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,210
sensational title right and it's so it's
like so then you can have individuals go

1650
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:54,220
like so then you can have individuals go
 

1651
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,470
like so then you can have individuals go
like oh we don't need to use this hey

1652
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:55,480
like oh we don't need to use this hey
 

1653
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,630
like oh we don't need to use this hey
I'm like oh no no no no I want the AI

1654
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:57,640
I'm like oh no no no no I want the AI
 

1655
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:01,589
I'm like oh no no no no I want the AI
instead of the the doctors that provided

1656
00:36:01,589 --> 00:36:01,599
instead of the the doctors that provided
 

1657
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:02,819
instead of the the doctors that provided
that data cuz it's still better than

1658
00:36:02,819 --> 00:36:02,829
that data cuz it's still better than
 

1659
00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:05,010
that data cuz it's still better than
that yes right I think it's really

1660
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:05,020
that yes right I think it's really
 

1661
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:07,680
that yes right I think it's really
important to linger on the idea that

1662
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:07,690
important to linger on the idea that
 

1663
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:11,430
important to linger on the idea that
this AI is racist it's like well

1664
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:11,440
this AI is racist it's like well
 

1665
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:17,970
this AI is racist it's like well
compared to what sort of the we that I

1666
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:17,980
compared to what sort of the we that I
 

1667
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:20,730
compared to what sort of the we that I
think we set unfortunately way too high

1668
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:20,740
think we set unfortunately way too high
 

1669
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:23,790
think we set unfortunately way too high
of a bar for AI algorithms and in the

1670
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:23,800
of a bar for AI algorithms and in the
 

1671
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,250
of a bar for AI algorithms and in the
ethical space where perfect is I would

1672
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:26,260
ethical space where perfect is I would
 

1673
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:30,599
ethical space where perfect is I would
argue probably impossible then if we set

1674
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:30,609
argue probably impossible then if we set
 

1675
00:36:30,609 --> 00:36:33,329
argue probably impossible then if we set
the bar of perfection essentially if it

1676
00:36:33,329 --> 00:36:33,339
the bar of perfection essentially if it
 

1677
00:36:33,339 --> 00:36:35,550
the bar of perfection essentially if it
has to be perfectly fair whatever that

1678
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:35,560
has to be perfectly fair whatever that
 

1679
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,030
has to be perfectly fair whatever that
means

1680
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:36,040
means
 

1681
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:39,120
means
is it means we're setting it up for

1682
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:39,130
is it means we're setting it up for
 

1683
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:40,950
is it means we're setting it up for
failure but that's really important to

1684
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:40,960
failure but that's really important to
 

1685
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,930
failure but that's really important to
say what you just said which is well

1686
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:42,940
say what you just said which is well
 

1687
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,390
say what you just said which is well
it's still better yeah and one of the

1688
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:45,400
it's still better yeah and one of the
 

1689
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,910
it's still better yeah and one of the
things I I think that we don't get

1690
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:47,920
things I I think that we don't get
 

1691
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,300
things I I think that we don't get
enough credit for just in terms of as

1692
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:51,310
enough credit for just in terms of as
 

1693
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:55,319
enough credit for just in terms of as
developers is that you can now poke at

1694
00:36:55,319 --> 00:36:55,329
developers is that you can now poke at
 

1695
00:36:55,329 --> 00:36:57,750
developers is that you can now poke at
it right so it's harder to say you know

1696
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:57,760
it right so it's harder to say you know
 

1697
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,520
it right so it's harder to say you know
is this hospital is the city doing

1698
00:36:59,520 --> 00:36:59,530
is this hospital is the city doing
 

1699
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:02,160
is this hospital is the city doing
something right until someone brings in

1700
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:02,170
something right until someone brings in
 

1701
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:05,309
something right until someone brings in
a civil case right well were they I it

1702
00:37:05,309 --> 00:37:05,319
a civil case right well were they I it
 

1703
00:37:05,319 --> 00:37:07,079
a civil case right well were they I it
can process through all this data and

1704
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:07,089
can process through all this data and
 

1705
00:37:07,089 --> 00:37:10,920
can process through all this data and
say hey yes there there's some an issue

1706
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:10,930
say hey yes there there's some an issue
 

1707
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:14,250
say hey yes there there's some an issue
here but here it is we've identified it

1708
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:14,260
here but here it is we've identified it
 

1709
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,079
here but here it is we've identified it
and then the next step is to fix it I

1710
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:16,089
and then the next step is to fix it I
 

1711
00:37:16,089 --> 00:37:18,450
and then the next step is to fix it I
mean that's a nice feedback loop versus

1712
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:18,460
mean that's a nice feedback loop versus
 

1713
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:20,460
mean that's a nice feedback loop versus
like waiting for someone to sue someone

1714
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:20,470
like waiting for someone to sue someone
 

1715
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:23,010
like waiting for someone to sue someone
else before it's fixed right and so I

1716
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:23,020
else before it's fixed right and so I
 

1717
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:25,950
else before it's fixed right and so I
think that power we need to capitalize

1718
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:25,960
think that power we need to capitalize
 

1719
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,900
think that power we need to capitalize
on a little bit more right instead of

1720
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:27,910
on a little bit more right instead of
 

1721
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:30,800
on a little bit more right instead of
having the sensational titles have the

1722
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:30,810
having the sensational titles have the
 

1723
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:31,980
having the sensational titles have the
okay

1724
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:31,990
okay
 

1725
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:34,050
okay
this is a problem and this is how we're

1726
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:34,060
this is a problem and this is how we're
 

1727
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,430
this is a problem and this is how we're
fixing it and people are putting money

1728
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:35,440
fixing it and people are putting money
 

1729
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,740
fixing it and people are putting money
to fix it because we can make it better

1730
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:37,750
to fix it because we can make it better
 

1731
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,870
to fix it because we can make it better
now you look at like facial recognition

1732
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:39,880
now you look at like facial recognition
 

1733
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:44,760
now you look at like facial recognition
how joy she basically called out

1734
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:44,770
how joy she basically called out
 

1735
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:47,610
how joy she basically called out
the companies and said hey and most of

1736
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:47,620
the companies and said hey and most of
 

1737
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:49,970
the companies and said hey and most of
them were like Oh embarrassment and the

1738
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:49,980
them were like Oh embarrassment and the
 

1739
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:53,520
them were like Oh embarrassment and the
next time it had been fixed right it had

1740
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:53,530
next time it had been fixed right it had
 

1741
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:55,260
next time it had been fixed right it had
been fixed better right and then I was

1742
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:55,270
been fixed better right and then I was
 

1743
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:57,240
been fixed better right and then I was
like oh here's some more issues and I

1744
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:57,250
like oh here's some more issues and I
 

1745
00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:00,690
like oh here's some more issues and I
think that conversation then moves that

1746
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:00,700
think that conversation then moves that
 

1747
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:04,020
think that conversation then moves that
needle to having much more fair and

1748
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:04,030
needle to having much more fair and
 

1749
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:08,160
needle to having much more fair and
unbiased and ethical aspects as long as

1750
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:08,170
unbiased and ethical aspects as long as
 

1751
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:10,410
unbiased and ethical aspects as long as
both sides the developers are willing to

1752
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:10,420
both sides the developers are willing to
 

1753
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:13,350
both sides the developers are willing to
say okay I hear you yes we are going to

1754
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:13,360
say okay I hear you yes we are going to
 

1755
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,240
say okay I hear you yes we are going to
improve and you have other developers

1756
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:15,250
improve and you have other developers
 

1757
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:18,330
improve and you have other developers
are like you know hey AI it's wrong

1758
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:18,340
are like you know hey AI it's wrong
 

1759
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:21,630
are like you know hey AI it's wrong
but I love it right yes so speaking of

1760
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:21,640
but I love it right yes so speaking of
 

1761
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,630
but I love it right yes so speaking of
this really nice notion that AI is maybe

1762
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:24,640
this really nice notion that AI is maybe
 

1763
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,430
this really nice notion that AI is maybe
flawed but better than humans

1764
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:26,440
flawed but better than humans
 

1765
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,730
flawed but better than humans
so just made me think of it one example

1766
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:29,740
so just made me think of it one example
 

1767
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:33,270
so just made me think of it one example
of flawed humans is our political system

1768
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:33,280
of flawed humans is our political system
 

1769
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,410
of flawed humans is our political system
do you think or you said judicial as

1770
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:37,420
do you think or you said judicial as
 

1771
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:44,720
do you think or you said judicial as
well do you have a hope for AI sort of

1772
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:44,730
well do you have a hope for AI sort of
 

1773
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:48,960
well do you have a hope for AI sort of
being elected for president or running

1774
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:48,970
being elected for president or running
 

1775
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:51,240
being elected for president or running
our Congress or being able to be a

1776
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:51,250
our Congress or being able to be a
 

1777
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:53,210
our Congress or being able to be a
powerful representative of the people

1778
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:53,220
powerful representative of the people
 

1779
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:57,230
powerful representative of the people
so I mentioned and I truly believe that

1780
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:57,240
so I mentioned and I truly believe that
 

1781
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,940
so I mentioned and I truly believe that
this whole world of AI is in

1782
00:38:59,940 --> 00:38:59,950
this whole world of AI is in
 

1783
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:01,920
this whole world of AI is in
partnerships with people and so what

1784
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:01,930
partnerships with people and so what
 

1785
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:05,250
partnerships with people and so what
does that mean I I don't believe or and

1786
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:05,260
does that mean I I don't believe or and
 

1787
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:08,610
does that mean I I don't believe or and
maybe I just don't I don't believe that

1788
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:08,620
maybe I just don't I don't believe that
 

1789
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:11,760
maybe I just don't I don't believe that
we should have an AI for president but I

1790
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:11,770
we should have an AI for president but I
 

1791
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:14,100
we should have an AI for president but I
do believe that a president should use

1792
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:14,110
do believe that a president should use
 

1793
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:16,500
do believe that a president should use
AI as an adviser right like if you think

1794
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:16,510
AI as an adviser right like if you think
 

1795
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:20,070
AI as an adviser right like if you think
about it every president has a cabinet

1796
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:20,080
about it every president has a cabinet
 

1797
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,770
about it every president has a cabinet
of individuals that have different

1798
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:22,780
of individuals that have different
 

1799
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:25,560
of individuals that have different
expertise that they should listen to

1800
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:25,570
expertise that they should listen to
 

1801
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:27,840
expertise that they should listen to
right like that's kind of what we do and

1802
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:27,850
right like that's kind of what we do and
 

1803
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:30,390
right like that's kind of what we do and
you put smart people with smart

1804
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:30,400
you put smart people with smart
 

1805
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,640
you put smart people with smart
expertise around certain issues and you

1806
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:32,650
expertise around certain issues and you
 

1807
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:35,340
expertise around certain issues and you
listen I don't see why a I can't

1808
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:35,350
listen I don't see why a I can't
 

1809
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:37,020
listen I don't see why a I can't
function as one of those smart

1810
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:37,030
function as one of those smart
 

1811
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:39,750
function as one of those smart
individuals giving input so maybe

1812
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:39,760
individuals giving input so maybe
 

1813
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,340
individuals giving input so maybe
there's an AI on health care maybe

1814
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:41,350
there's an AI on health care maybe
 

1815
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:43,920
there's an AI on health care maybe
there's an AI on education and right

1816
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:43,930
there's an AI on education and right
 

1817
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:46,640
there's an AI on education and right
like all these things that a human is

1818
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:46,650
like all these things that a human is
 

1819
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:49,800
like all these things that a human is
processing right because at the end of

1820
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:49,810
processing right because at the end of
 

1821
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:53,340
processing right because at the end of
the day there's people that are human

1822
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:53,350
the day there's people that are human
 

1823
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:55,140
the day there's people that are human
that are going to be at the end of the

1824
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:55,150
that are going to be at the end of the
 

1825
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:57,540
that are going to be at the end of the
decision and I don't think as a world as

1826
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:57,550
decision and I don't think as a world as
 

1827
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,350
decision and I don't think as a world as
a culture as

1828
00:39:58,350 --> 00:39:58,360
a culture as
 

1829
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:02,550
a culture as
xiety that we would totally be and this

1830
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:02,560
xiety that we would totally be and this
 

1831
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,800
xiety that we would totally be and this
is us like this is some fallacy about us

1832
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:04,810
is us like this is some fallacy about us
 

1833
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:08,640
is us like this is some fallacy about us
but we need to see that leader that

1834
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:08,650
but we need to see that leader that
 

1835
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:12,660
but we need to see that leader that
person as human and most people don't

1836
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:12,670
person as human and most people don't
 

1837
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:15,990
person as human and most people don't
realize that like leaders have a whole

1838
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:16,000
realize that like leaders have a whole
 

1839
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,760
realize that like leaders have a whole
lot of advice right like when they say

1840
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:17,770
lot of advice right like when they say
 

1841
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:19,860
lot of advice right like when they say
something is not that they woke up well

1842
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:19,870
something is not that they woke up well
 

1843
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:21,360
something is not that they woke up well
usually they don't wake up in the

1844
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:21,370
usually they don't wake up in the
 

1845
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:23,550
usually they don't wake up in the
morning and be like I have a brilliant

1846
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:23,560
morning and be like I have a brilliant
 

1847
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,210
morning and be like I have a brilliant
idea

1848
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:24,220
idea
 

1849
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:26,910
idea
right it's usually a ok let me listen I

1850
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:26,920
right it's usually a ok let me listen I
 

1851
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,440
right it's usually a ok let me listen I
have a brilliant idea but let me get a

1852
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:28,450
have a brilliant idea but let me get a
 

1853
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:30,600
have a brilliant idea but let me get a
little bit of feedback on this like ok

1854
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:30,610
little bit of feedback on this like ok
 

1855
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:32,430
little bit of feedback on this like ok
and then it's saying yeah that was an

1856
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:32,440
and then it's saying yeah that was an
 

1857
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,010
and then it's saying yeah that was an
awesome idea or it's like yeah let me go

1858
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:35,020
awesome idea or it's like yeah let me go
 

1859
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:37,230
awesome idea or it's like yeah let me go
back already talked to a bunch of them

1860
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:37,240
back already talked to a bunch of them
 

1861
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:41,660
back already talked to a bunch of them
but are there some possible solutions to

1862
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:41,670
but are there some possible solutions to
 

1863
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:45,240
but are there some possible solutions to
the biases presence in our algorithms

1864
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:45,250
the biases presence in our algorithms
 

1865
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:47,010
the biases presence in our algorithms
beyond what we just talked about so I

1866
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:47,020
beyond what we just talked about so I
 

1867
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:51,180
beyond what we just talked about so I
think there's two paths one is to figure

1868
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:51,190
think there's two paths one is to figure
 

1869
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:54,120
think there's two paths one is to figure
out how to systematically do the

1870
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:54,130
out how to systematically do the
 

1871
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:57,030
out how to systematically do the
feedback in corrections so right now

1872
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:57,040
feedback in corrections so right now
 

1873
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,310
feedback in corrections so right now
it's ad hoc right it's a researcher

1874
00:40:59,310 --> 00:40:59,320
it's ad hoc right it's a researcher
 

1875
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:03,030
it's ad hoc right it's a researcher
identify some outcomes that are not

1876
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:03,040
identify some outcomes that are not
 

1877
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,940
identify some outcomes that are not
don't seem to be fair right they publish

1878
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:05,950
don't seem to be fair right they publish
 

1879
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:09,510
don't seem to be fair right they publish
it they write about it and the either

1880
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:09,520
it they write about it and the either
 

1881
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,640
it they write about it and the either
the developer or the companies that have

1882
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:11,650
the developer or the companies that have
 

1883
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:13,980
the developer or the companies that have
adopted the algorithms may try to fix it

1884
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:13,990
adopted the algorithms may try to fix it
 

1885
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:17,220
adopted the algorithms may try to fix it
right and so it's really ad hoc and it's

1886
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:17,230
right and so it's really ad hoc and it's
 

1887
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:20,190
right and so it's really ad hoc and it's
not systematic there's it's just it's

1888
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:20,200
not systematic there's it's just it's
 

1889
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,890
not systematic there's it's just it's
kind of like I'm a researcher that seems

1890
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:22,900
kind of like I'm a researcher that seems
 

1891
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,050
kind of like I'm a researcher that seems
like an interesting problem which means

1892
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:25,060
like an interesting problem which means
 

1893
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,340
like an interesting problem which means
that there's a whole lot out there

1894
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:26,350
that there's a whole lot out there
 

1895
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:29,250
that there's a whole lot out there
that's not being looked at right because

1896
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:29,260
that's not being looked at right because
 

1897
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:33,510
that's not being looked at right because
it's kind of researcher driven I and I

1898
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:33,520
it's kind of researcher driven I and I
 

1899
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,240
it's kind of researcher driven I and I
don't necessarily have a solution but

1900
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:35,250
don't necessarily have a solution but
 

1901
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:39,900
don't necessarily have a solution but
that process I think could be done a

1902
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:39,910
that process I think could be done a
 

1903
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:40,650
that process I think could be done a
little bit better

1904
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:40,660
little bit better
 

1905
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:44,640
little bit better
one way is I'm going to poke a little

1906
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:44,650
one way is I'm going to poke a little
 

1907
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:48,060
one way is I'm going to poke a little
bit at some of the corporations right

1908
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:48,070
bit at some of the corporations right
 

1909
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:50,580
bit at some of the corporations right
like maybe the corporations when they

1910
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:50,590
like maybe the corporations when they
 

1911
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:52,100
like maybe the corporations when they
think about a product they should

1912
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:52,110
think about a product they should
 

1913
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:55,830
think about a product they should
instead of in addition to hiring these

1914
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:55,840
instead of in addition to hiring these
 

1915
00:41:55,840 --> 00:42:00,480
instead of in addition to hiring these
you know bug they give these oh yeah

1916
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:00,490
you know bug they give these oh yeah
 

1917
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:02,340
you know bug they give these oh yeah
yeah yeah wait you think Awards when you

1918
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:02,350
yeah yeah wait you think Awards when you
 

1919
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:05,430
yeah yeah wait you think Awards when you
find a bug yeah yes Joey bug yeah you

1920
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:05,440
find a bug yeah yes Joey bug yeah you
 

1921
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,530
find a bug yeah yes Joey bug yeah you
know let's let's put it like we will

1922
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:07,540
know let's let's put it like we will
 

1923
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:09,960
know let's let's put it like we will
give the whatever the award is that we

1924
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:09,970
give the whatever the award is that we
 

1925
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:11,910
give the whatever the award is that we
give for the people who finally secure

1926
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:11,920
give for the people who finally secure
 

1927
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,130
give for the people who finally secure
holls find an ethics hole right like

1928
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:14,140
holls find an ethics hole right like
 

1929
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:15,960
holls find an ethics hole right like
find an unfairness hole and we will pay

1930
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:15,970
find an unfairness hole and we will pay
 

1931
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:18,210
find an unfairness hole and we will pay
you X for each one you find I mean why

1932
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:18,220
you X for each one you find I mean why
 

1933
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:21,210
you X for each one you find I mean why
can't they do that one is a win-win they

1934
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:21,220
can't they do that one is a win-win they
 

1935
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:23,039
can't they do that one is a win-win they
show that they're concerned about it

1936
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:23,049
show that they're concerned about it
 

1937
00:42:23,049 --> 00:42:24,870
show that they're concerned about it
that this is important and they don't

1938
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:24,880
that this is important and they don't
 

1939
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,549
that this is important and they don't
have to necessarily dedicate it their

1940
00:42:26,549 --> 00:42:26,559
have to necessarily dedicate it their
 

1941
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:29,309
have to necessarily dedicate it their
own like internal resources and it also

1942
00:42:29,309 --> 00:42:29,319
own like internal resources and it also
 

1943
00:42:29,319 --> 00:42:31,289
own like internal resources and it also
means that everyone who has like their

1944
00:42:31,289 --> 00:42:31,299
means that everyone who has like their
 

1945
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:34,319
means that everyone who has like their
own bias lens like I'm interested in age

1946
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:34,329
own bias lens like I'm interested in age
 

1947
00:42:34,329 --> 00:42:36,390
own bias lens like I'm interested in age
and so I'll find the ones based on age

1948
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:36,400
and so I'll find the ones based on age
 

1949
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,309
and so I'll find the ones based on age
and I'm interested in gender and right

1950
00:42:38,309 --> 00:42:38,319
and I'm interested in gender and right
 

1951
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:40,109
and I'm interested in gender and right
which means that you get like all of

1952
00:42:40,109 --> 00:42:40,119
which means that you get like all of
 

1953
00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:41,789
which means that you get like all of
these different perspectives but you

1954
00:42:41,789 --> 00:42:41,799
these different perspectives but you
 

1955
00:42:41,799 --> 00:42:43,740
these different perspectives but you
think of it in a data-driven way so like

1956
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:43,750
think of it in a data-driven way so like
 

1957
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:47,849
think of it in a data-driven way so like
go see sort of if we look at a company

1958
00:42:47,849 --> 00:42:47,859
go see sort of if we look at a company
 

1959
00:42:47,859 --> 00:42:50,430
go see sort of if we look at a company
like Twitter it gets it's under a lot of

1960
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:50,440
like Twitter it gets it's under a lot of
 

1961
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:53,549
like Twitter it gets it's under a lot of
fire for discriminating against certain

1962
00:42:53,549 --> 00:42:53,559
fire for discriminating against certain
 

1963
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:56,520
fire for discriminating against certain
political beliefs correct and sort of

1964
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:56,530
political beliefs correct and sort of
 

1965
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:58,950
political beliefs correct and sort of
there's a lot of people this is the sad

1966
00:42:58,950 --> 00:42:58,960
there's a lot of people this is the sad
 

1967
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,120
there's a lot of people this is the sad
thing because I know how hard the

1968
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:00,130
thing because I know how hard the
 

1969
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:01,920
thing because I know how hard the
problem is and I know the Twitter folks

1970
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:01,930
problem is and I know the Twitter folks
 

1971
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:03,210
problem is and I know the Twitter folks
are working with a heart at it even

1972
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:03,220
are working with a heart at it even
 

1973
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:04,890
are working with a heart at it even
Facebook that everyone seems to hate I

1974
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:04,900
Facebook that everyone seems to hate I
 

1975
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,990
Facebook that everyone seems to hate I
worked in really hard of this it you

1976
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:07,000
worked in really hard of this it you
 

1977
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,849
worked in really hard of this it you
know the kind of evidence that people

1978
00:43:08,849 --> 00:43:08,859
know the kind of evidence that people
 

1979
00:43:08,859 --> 00:43:10,920
know the kind of evidence that people
bring is basically anecdotal evidence

1980
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:10,930
bring is basically anecdotal evidence
 

1981
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:14,309
bring is basically anecdotal evidence
well me or my friend all we said is X

1982
00:43:14,309 --> 00:43:14,319
well me or my friend all we said is X
 

1983
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:18,809
well me or my friend all we said is X
and for that we got banned and and

1984
00:43:18,809 --> 00:43:18,819
and for that we got banned and and
 

1985
00:43:18,819 --> 00:43:20,789
and for that we got banned and and
that's kind of a discussion of saying

1986
00:43:20,789 --> 00:43:20,799
that's kind of a discussion of saying
 

1987
00:43:20,799 --> 00:43:23,069
that's kind of a discussion of saying
well look that's usually first of all

1988
00:43:23,069 --> 00:43:23,079
well look that's usually first of all
 

1989
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:25,079
well look that's usually first of all
the whole thing is taken out of context

1990
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:25,089
the whole thing is taken out of context
 

1991
00:43:25,089 --> 00:43:26,730
the whole thing is taken out of context
so they're they present sort of

1992
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:26,740
so they're they present sort of
 

1993
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:29,220
so they're they present sort of
anecdotal evidence and how are you

1994
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:29,230
anecdotal evidence and how are you
 

1995
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:31,829
anecdotal evidence and how are you
supposed to as a company in a healthy

1996
00:43:31,829 --> 00:43:31,839
supposed to as a company in a healthy
 

1997
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:34,109
supposed to as a company in a healthy
way have a discourse about what is and

1998
00:43:34,109 --> 00:43:34,119
way have a discourse about what is and
 

1999
00:43:34,119 --> 00:43:36,599
way have a discourse about what is and
isn't ethical what how do we make

2000
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:36,609
isn't ethical what how do we make
 

2001
00:43:36,609 --> 00:43:39,270
isn't ethical what how do we make
algorithms ethical when people are just

2002
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:39,280
algorithms ethical when people are just
 

2003
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:43,140
algorithms ethical when people are just
blowing everything like they're outraged

2004
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:43,150
blowing everything like they're outraged
 

2005
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:46,140
blowing everything like they're outraged
about a particular and a godel evident

2006
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:46,150
about a particular and a godel evident
 

2007
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:48,180
about a particular and a godel evident
piece of evidence that's very difficult

2008
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:48,190
piece of evidence that's very difficult
 

2009
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:50,339
piece of evidence that's very difficult
to sort of contextualize in the big

2010
00:43:50,339 --> 00:43:50,349
to sort of contextualize in the big
 

2011
00:43:50,349 --> 00:43:51,710
to sort of contextualize in the big
data-driven way

2012
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:51,720
data-driven way
 

2013
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,569
data-driven way
do you have a hope for companies like

2014
00:43:54,569 --> 00:43:54,579
do you have a hope for companies like
 

2015
00:43:54,579 --> 00:43:57,930
do you have a hope for companies like
Twitter and yeah so I think there's a

2016
00:43:57,930 --> 00:43:57,940
Twitter and yeah so I think there's a
 

2017
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:00,030
Twitter and yeah so I think there's a
couple of things going on right first

2018
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:00,040
couple of things going on right first
 

2019
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:05,460
couple of things going on right first

I think so so I'm an optimist right and

2090
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:44,120
I think so so I'm an optimist right and
 

2091
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:47,410
I think so so I'm an optimist right and
you know we there were some dark times

2092
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:47,420
you know we there were some dark times
 

2093
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:51,160
you know we there were some dark times
in history always I think now we're in

2094
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:51,170
in history always I think now we're in
 

2095
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:53,770
in history always I think now we're in
one of those dark times I truly do and

2096
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:53,780
one of those dark times I truly do and
 

2097
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:56,500
one of those dark times I truly do and
which aspect the polarization and it's

2098
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:56,510
which aspect the polarization and it's
 

2099
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:58,300
which aspect the polarization and it's
not just us right so if it was just us

2100
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:58,310
not just us right so if it was just us
 

2101
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:00,310
not just us right so if it was just us
I'd be like yeah say us thing but we're

2102
00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:00,320
I'd be like yeah say us thing but we're
 

2103
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,440
I'd be like yeah say us thing but we're
seeing it like worldwide this

2104
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:02,450
seeing it like worldwide this
 

2105
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:06,810
seeing it like worldwide this
polarization and so I worry about that

2106
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:06,820
polarization and so I worry about that
 

2107
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:10,690
polarization and so I worry about that
but I do fundamentally believe that at

2108
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:10,700
but I do fundamentally believe that at
 

2109
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:13,330
but I do fundamentally believe that at
the end of the day people are good right

2110
00:46:13,330 --> 00:46:13,340
the end of the day people are good right
 

2111
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:15,760
the end of the day people are good right
and why do I say that because any time

2112
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:15,770
and why do I say that because any time
 

2113
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:19,180
and why do I say that because any time
there's a scenario where people are in

2114
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:19,190
there's a scenario where people are in
 

2115
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:22,060
there's a scenario where people are in
danger and I would use I saw Atlanta we

2116
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:22,070
danger and I would use I saw Atlanta we
 

2117
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:25,030
danger and I would use I saw Atlanta we
had Snowmageddon and people can laugh

2118
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:25,040

2119
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:28,390
had Snowmageddon and people can laugh
about that people at the time so the

2120
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:28,400
about that people at the time so the
 

2121
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,300
about that people at the time so the

actually taking advantage of that in the
 

2173
00:47:30,829 --> 00:47:33,370
actually taking advantage of that in the
sense because it brings you back to the

2174
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:33,380
sense because it brings you back to the
 

2175
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:35,739
sense because it brings you back to the
platform and their advertisers are

2176
00:47:35,739 --> 00:47:35,749
platform and their advertisers are
 

2177
00:47:35,749 --> 00:47:39,460
platform and their advertisers are
driven so they make a lot of money love

2178
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:39,470
driven so they make a lot of money love

doesn't sell quite as well in terms of
 

2181
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:46,509

00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:51,460
career NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory
but before I'd ask a few questions there

2186
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:51,470
but before I'd ask a few questions there
 

2187
00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:53,739
but before I'd ask a few questions there
have you happen to have ever seen Space

2188
00:47:53,739 --> 00:47:53,749
have you happen to have ever seen Space
 

2189
00:47:53,749 --> 00:47:59,499
have you happen to have ever seen Space
Odyssey 2001 Space Odyssey yes okay do

2190
00:47:59,499 --> 00:47:59,509
Odyssey 2001 Space Odyssey yes okay do
 

2191
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:02,019
Odyssey 2001 Space Odyssey yes okay do
you think Hal 9000 so we're talking

2192
00:48:02,019 --> 00:48:02,029
you think Hal 9000 so we're talking
 

2193
00:48:02,029 --> 00:48:06,009
you think Hal 9000 so we're talking
about ethics do you think how did the

2194
00:48:06,009 --> 00:48:06,019
about ethics do you think how did the
 

2195
00:48:06,019 --> 00:48:07,930
about ethics do you think how did the
right thing by taking the priority of

2196
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:07,940
right thing by taking the priority of
 

2197
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:09,430
right thing by taking the priority of
the mission over the lives of the

2198
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:09,440
the mission over the lives of the
 

2199
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,499
the mission over the lives of the
astronauts do you think Cal is good or

2200
00:48:11,499 --> 00:48:11,509
astronauts do you think Cal is good or
 

2201
00:48:11,509 --> 00:48:18,599
astronauts do you think Cal is good or
evil easy questions yeah

2202
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:18,609
evil easy questions yeah
 

2203
00:48:18,609 --> 00:48:22,390
evil easy questions yeah
Hal was misguided you're one of the

2204
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:22,400
Hal was misguided you're one of the
 

2205
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,279
Hal was misguided you're one of the
people that would be in charge of an

2206
00:48:24,279 --> 00:48:24,289
people that would be in charge of an
 

2207
00:48:24,289 --> 00:48:27,099
people that would be in charge of an
algorithm like Hal yes so how would you

2208
00:48:27,099 --> 00:48:27,109
algorithm like Hal yes so how would you
 

2209
00:48:27,109 --> 00:48:30,279
algorithm like Hal yes so how would you
do better if you think about what

2210
00:48:30,279 --> 00:48:30,289
do better if you think about what
 

2211
00:48:30,289 --> 00:48:34,839
do better if you think about what
happened was there was no failsafe right

2212
00:48:34,839 --> 00:48:34,849
happened was there was no failsafe right
 

2213
00:48:34,849 --> 00:48:38,289
happened was there was no failsafe right
so we perfection right like what is that

2214
00:48:38,289 --> 00:48:38,299
so we perfection right like what is that
 

2215
00:48:38,299 --> 00:48:39,880
so we perfection right like what is that
I'm gonna make something that I think is

2216
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:39,890
I'm gonna make something that I think is
 

2217
00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:43,799
I'm gonna make something that I think is
perfect but if my assumptions are wrong

2218
00:48:43,799 --> 00:48:43,809
perfect but if my assumptions are wrong
 

2219
00:48:43,809 --> 00:48:46,059
perfect but if my assumptions are wrong
it'll be perfect based on the wrong

2220
00:48:46,059 --> 00:48:46,069
it'll be perfect based on the wrong
 

2221
00:48:46,069 --> 00:48:48,370
it'll be perfect based on the wrong
assumptions all right that's something

2222
00:48:48,370 --> 00:48:48,380
assumptions all right that's something
 

2223
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:51,849
assumptions all right that's something
that you don't know until you deploy and

2224
00:48:51,849 --> 00:48:51,859
that you don't know until you deploy and
 

2225
00:48:51,859 --> 00:48:56,049
that you don't know until you deploy and
like oh yeah messed up but what that

2226
00:48:56,049 --> 00:48:56,059
like oh yeah messed up but what that
 

2227
00:48:56,059 --> 00:48:57,999
like oh yeah messed up but what that
means is that when we design software

2228
00:48:57,999 --> 00:48:58,009
means is that when we design software
 

2229
00:48:58,009 --> 00:49:01,329
means is that when we design software
such as in Space Odyssey when we put

2230
00:49:01,329 --> 00:49:01,339
such as in Space Odyssey when we put
 

2231
00:49:01,339 --> 00:49:02,950
such as in Space Odyssey when we put
things out that there has to be a

2232
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:02,960
things out that there has to be a
 

2233
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,049
things out that there has to be a
failsafe there has to be the ability

2234
00:49:05,049 --> 00:49:05,059
failsafe there has to be the ability
 

2235
00:49:05,059 --> 00:49:08,079
failsafe there has to be the ability
that once it's out there you know we can

2236
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:08,089
that once it's out there you know we can
 

2237
00:49:08,089 --> 00:49:11,589
that once it's out there you know we can
grade it as an F and it fails and it

2238
00:49:11,589 --> 00:49:11,599
grade it as an F and it fails and it
 

2239
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:13,450
grade it as an F and it fails and it
doesn't continue right if there's some

2240
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:13,460
doesn't continue right if there's some
 

2241
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:16,420
doesn't continue right if there's some
way that it can be brought in and and

2242
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:16,430
way that it can be brought in and and
 

2243
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:20,019
way that it can be brought in and and
removed and that's aspect because that's

2244
00:49:20,019 --> 00:49:20,029
removed and that's aspect because that's
 

2245
00:49:20,029 --> 00:49:21,509
removed and that's aspect because that's
what happened with what how it was like

2246
00:49:21,509 --> 00:49:21,519
what happened with what how it was like
 

2247
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:23,200
what happened with what how it was like
assumptions were wrong

2248
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:23,210
assumptions were wrong
 

2249
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:26,559
assumptions were wrong
it was perfectly correct based on those

2250
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:26,569
it was perfectly correct based on those
 

2251
00:49:26,569 --> 00:49:28,680
it was perfectly correct based on those
assumptions and there was no way to

2252
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:28,690
assumptions and there was no way to
 

2253
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:32,549
assumptions and there was no way to
change change it change the assumptions

2254
00:49:32,549 --> 00:49:32,559
change change it change the assumptions
 

2255
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:35,859
change change it change the assumptions
at all and the change the fallback would

2256
00:49:35,859 --> 00:49:35,869
at all and the change the fallback would
 

2257
00:49:35,869 --> 00:49:37,839
at all and the change the fallback would
be to humans so you ultimately think

2258
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:37,849
be to humans so you ultimately think
 

2259
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:42,749
be to humans so you ultimately think
like humans should be you know it's not

2260
00:49:42,749 --> 00:49:42,759
like humans should be you know it's not
 

2261
00:49:42,759 --> 00:49:46,059
like humans should be you know it's not
Turtles or AI all the way down it's at

2262
00:49:46,059 --> 00:49:46,069
Turtles or AI all the way down it's at
 

2263
00:49:46,069 --> 00:49:47,799
Turtles or AI all the way down it's at
some point there's a human that actually

2264
00:49:47,799 --> 00:49:47,809
some point there's a human that actually
 

2265
00:49:47,809 --> 00:49:50,170
some point there's a human that actually
don't think that and again because I do

2266
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:50,180
don't think that and again because I do
 

2267
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:52,089
don't think that and again because I do
human robot interaction I still think

2268
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:52,099
human robot interaction I still think
 

2269
00:49:52,099 --> 00:49:54,339
human robot interaction I still think
the human needs to be part of the

2270
00:49:54,339 --> 00:49:54,349
the human needs to be part of the
 

2271
00:49:54,349 --> 00:49:57,729
the human needs to be part of the
equation at some point so what just

2272
00:49:57,729 --> 00:49:57,739
equation at some point so what just
 

2273
00:49:57,739 --> 00:49:59,289
equation at some point so what just
looking back what are some fascinating

2274
00:49:59,289 --> 00:49:59,299
looking back what are some fascinating
 

2275
00:49:59,299 --> 00:50:02,559
looking back what are some fascinating
things in robotic space that NASA was

2276
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:02,569
things in robotic space that NASA was
 

2277
00:50:02,569 --> 00:50:04,059
things in robotic space that NASA was
working at the time or just in general

2278
00:50:04,059 --> 00:50:04,069
working at the time or just in general
 

2279
00:50:04,069 --> 00:50:07,359
working at the time or just in general
what what have you gotten to play with

2280
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:07,369
what what have you gotten to play with
 

2281
00:50:07,369 --> 00:50:09,400
what what have you gotten to play with
and what are your memories from working

2282
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:09,410
and what are your memories from working
 

2283
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:12,870
and what are your memories from working
at NASA yes so one of my first memories

2284
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:12,880
at NASA yes so one of my first memories
 

2285
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:17,140
at NASA yes so one of my first memories
was they were working on a surgical

2286
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:17,150
was they were working on a surgical
 

2287
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:20,859
was they were working on a surgical
robot system that could do eye surgery

2288
00:50:20,859 --> 00:50:20,869
robot system that could do eye surgery
 

2289
00:50:20,869 --> 00:50:23,979
robot system that could do eye surgery
right and this was back in oh my gosh it

2290
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:23,989
right and this was back in oh my gosh it
 

2291
00:50:23,989 --> 00:50:30,729
right and this was back in oh my gosh it
must have been Oh maybe 92 93 94 so it's

2292
00:50:30,729 --> 00:50:30,739
must have been Oh maybe 92 93 94 so it's
 

2293
00:50:30,739 --> 00:50:32,650
must have been Oh maybe 92 93 94 so it's
like almost like a remote operation oh

2294
00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:32,660
like almost like a remote operation oh
 

2295
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:34,569
like almost like a remote operation oh
yeah it was it was a remote operation in

2296
00:50:34,569 --> 00:50:34,579
yeah it was it was a remote operation in
 

2297
00:50:34,579 --> 00:50:36,609
yeah it was it was a remote operation in
fact that you can even find some old

2298
00:50:36,609 --> 00:50:36,619
fact that you can even find some old
 

2299
00:50:36,619 --> 00:50:39,309
fact that you can even find some old
tech reports on it so think of it you

2300
00:50:39,309 --> 00:50:39,319
tech reports on it so think of it you
 

2301
00:50:39,319 --> 00:50:41,470
tech reports on it so think of it you
know like now we have da Vinci right

2302
00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:41,480
know like now we have da Vinci right
 

2303
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:43,630
know like now we have da Vinci right
like think of it but these are like the

2304
00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:43,640
like think of it but these are like the
 

2305
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:47,380
like think of it but these are like the
late 90s right and I remember going into

2306
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:47,390
late 90s right and I remember going into
 

2307
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:49,660
late 90s right and I remember going into
the lab one day and I was like what's

2308
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:49,670
the lab one day and I was like what's
 

2309
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:52,660
the lab one day and I was like what's
that right and of course it wasn't

2310
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:52,670
that right and of course it wasn't
 

2311
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:55,359
that right and of course it wasn't
pretty right because the technology but

2312
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:55,369
pretty right because the technology but
 

2313
00:50:55,369 --> 00:50:57,249
pretty right because the technology but
it was like functional and you had as

2314
00:50:57,249 --> 00:50:57,259
it was like functional and you had as
 

2315
00:50:57,259 --> 00:50:59,739
it was like functional and you had as
this individual that could use version

2316
00:50:59,739 --> 00:50:59,749
this individual that could use version
 

2317
00:50:59,749 --> 00:51:00,489
this individual that could use version
of haptics

2318
00:51:00,489 --> 00:51:00,499
of haptics
 

2319
00:51:00,499 --> 00:51:02,259
of haptics
to actually do the surgery and they had

2320
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:02,269
to actually do the surgery and they had
 

2321
00:51:02,269 --> 00:51:04,599
to actually do the surgery and they had
this mock-up of a human face and like

2322
00:51:04,599 --> 00:51:04,609
this mock-up of a human face and like
 

2323
00:51:04,609 --> 00:51:05,650
this mock-up of a human face and like
the eyeballs

2324
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:05,660
the eyeballs
 

2325
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:08,799
the eyeballs
you can see this little drill and I was

2326
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:08,809
you can see this little drill and I was
 

2327
00:51:08,809 --> 00:51:12,900
you can see this little drill and I was
like oh that one I vividly remember

2328
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:12,910
like oh that one I vividly remember
 

2329
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:16,829
like oh that one I vividly remember
because it was so outside of my like

2330
00:51:16,829 --> 00:51:16,839
because it was so outside of my like
 

2331
00:51:16,839 --> 00:51:19,420
because it was so outside of my like
possible thoughts of what could be done

2332
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:19,430
possible thoughts of what could be done
 

2333
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:23,620
possible thoughts of what could be done
the kind of precision and uh hey what

2334
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:23,630
the kind of precision and uh hey what
 

2335
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:25,480
the kind of precision and uh hey what
what's the most amazing of a thing like

2336
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:25,490
what's the most amazing of a thing like
 

2337
00:51:25,490 --> 00:51:28,650
what's the most amazing of a thing like
that I think it was the precision it was

2338
00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:28,660
that I think it was the precision it was
 

2339
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:32,700
that I think it was the precision it was
the kind of first time that I had

2340
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:32,710
the kind of first time that I had
 

2341
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:37,750
the kind of first time that I had
physically seen this robot machine human

2342
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:37,760
physically seen this robot machine human
 

2343
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,829
physically seen this robot machine human
interface right versus because

2344
00:51:40,829 --> 00:51:40,839
interface right versus because
 

2345
00:51:40,839 --> 00:51:42,940
interface right versus because
manufacturing have been you saw those

2346
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:42,950
manufacturing have been you saw those
 

2347
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:44,920
manufacturing have been you saw those
kind of big robots right but this was

2348
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:44,930
kind of big robots right but this was
 

2349
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:48,279
kind of big robots right but this was
like oh this is in a person there's a

2350
00:51:48,279 --> 00:51:48,289
like oh this is in a person there's a
 

2351
00:51:48,289 --> 00:51:51,130
like oh this is in a person there's a
person in a robot like in the same space

2352
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:51,140
person in a robot like in the same space
 

2353
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:53,559
person in a robot like in the same space
the meeting them in person I like for me

2354
00:51:53,559 --> 00:51:53,569
the meeting them in person I like for me
 

2355
00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:56,109
the meeting them in person I like for me
it was a magical moment that I can't as

2356
00:51:56,109 --> 00:51:56,119
it was a magical moment that I can't as
 

2357
00:51:56,119 --> 00:51:58,839
it was a magical moment that I can't as
a life-transforming that I recently met

2358
00:51:58,839 --> 00:51:58,849
a life-transforming that I recently met
 

2359
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:01,299
a life-transforming that I recently met
spot mini from Boston Dynamics Elysee I

2360
00:52:01,299 --> 00:52:01,309
spot mini from Boston Dynamics Elysee I
 

2361
00:52:01,309 --> 00:52:03,700
spot mini from Boston Dynamics Elysee I
don't know why but on the human robot

2362
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:03,710
don't know why but on the human robot
 

2363
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:06,640
don't know why but on the human robot
interaction for some reason I realized

2364
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:06,650
interaction for some reason I realized
 

2365
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:09,279
interaction for some reason I realized
how easy it is to anthropomorphize and

2366
00:52:09,279 --> 00:52:09,289
how easy it is to anthropomorphize and
 

2367
00:52:09,289 --> 00:52:12,279
how easy it is to anthropomorphize and
it was I don't know it was uh it was

2368
00:52:12,279 --> 00:52:12,289
it was I don't know it was uh it was
 

2369
00:52:12,289 --> 00:52:13,870
it was I don't know it was uh it was
almost like falling in love this feeling

2370
00:52:13,870 --> 00:52:13,880
almost like falling in love this feeling
 

2371
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,480
almost like falling in love this feeling
of meeting and I've obviously seen these

2372
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:16,490
of meeting and I've obviously seen these
 

2373
00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:18,339
of meeting and I've obviously seen these
or was a lot on video and so on but

2374
00:52:18,339 --> 00:52:18,349
or was a lot on video and so on but
 

2375
00:52:18,349 --> 00:52:19,839
or was a lot on video and so on but
meeting in person just having that

2376
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:19,849
meeting in person just having that
 

2377
00:52:19,849 --> 00:52:22,720
meeting in person just having that
one-on-one time it's different so do you

2378
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:22,730
one-on-one time it's different so do you
 

2379
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:24,730
one-on-one time it's different so do you
have you had a robot like that in your

2380
00:52:24,730 --> 00:52:24,740
have you had a robot like that in your
 

2381
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:27,130
have you had a robot like that in your
life that was made you maybe fall in

2382
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:27,140
life that was made you maybe fall in
 

2383
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:29,260
life that was made you maybe fall in
love with robotics sort of odds like

2384
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:29,270
love with robotics sort of odds like
 

2385
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:33,700
love with robotics sort of odds like
meeting in person I mean I mean I I

2386
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:33,710
meeting in person I mean I mean I I
 

2387
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:37,750
meeting in person I mean I mean I I
loved robotics yeah that was a 12 year

2388
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:37,760
loved robotics yeah that was a 12 year
 

2389
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:38,950
loved robotics yeah that was a 12 year
old like I would be a roboticist

2390
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:38,960
old like I would be a roboticist
 

2391
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,410
old like I would be a roboticist
actually was I called it cybernetics but

2392
00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:41,420
actually was I called it cybernetics but
 

2393
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:44,769
actually was I called it cybernetics but
so my my motivation was Bionic Woman I

2394
00:52:44,769 --> 00:52:44,779
so my my motivation was Bionic Woman I
 

2395
00:52:44,779 --> 00:52:46,900
so my my motivation was Bionic Woman I
don't know if you know that is um and so

2396
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:46,910
don't know if you know that is um and so
 

2397
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:49,180
don't know if you know that is um and so
I mean that was like a seminal moment

2398
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:49,190
I mean that was like a seminal moment
 

2399
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:52,299
I mean that was like a seminal moment
but I didn't me like that was TV right

2400
00:52:52,299 --> 00:52:52,309
but I didn't me like that was TV right
 

2401
00:52:52,309 --> 00:52:53,589
but I didn't me like that was TV right
like it wasn't like I was in the same

2402
00:52:53,589 --> 00:52:53,599
like it wasn't like I was in the same
 

2403
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:55,269
like it wasn't like I was in the same
space and I meant I was like oh my gosh

2404
00:52:55,269 --> 00:52:55,279
space and I meant I was like oh my gosh
 

2405
00:52:55,279 --> 00:52:57,640
space and I meant I was like oh my gosh
you're like real just linking I'm Bionic

2406
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:57,650
you're like real just linking I'm Bionic
 

2407
00:52:57,650 --> 00:52:59,710
you're like real just linking I'm Bionic
Woman which by the way because I've read

2408
00:52:59,710 --> 00:52:59,720
Woman which by the way because I've read
 

2409
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:03,130
Woman which by the way because I've read
that about you I watched a bit bits of

2410
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:03,140
that about you I watched a bit bits of
 

2411
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:08,279
that about you I watched a bit bits of
it and it's just so no offence terrible

2412
00:53:08,279 --> 00:53:08,289

 

2413
00:53:08,289 --> 00:53:12,579

I've seen a couple of reruns lately it's

2414
00:53:12,579 --> 00:53:12,589
I've seen a couple of reruns lately it's
 

2415
00:53:12,589 --> 00:53:14,910
I've seen a couple of reruns lately it's
uh but of course at the time is probably

2416
00:53:14,910 --> 00:53:14,920
uh but of course at the time is probably
 

2417
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:19,609
uh but of course at the time is probably
disgusted the imagination

2418
00:53:19,609 --> 00:53:19,619

 

2419
00:53:19,619 --> 00:53:22,650

especially when you're younger just

2420
00:53:22,650 --> 00:53:22,660
especially when you're younger just
 

2421
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:24,329
especially when you're younger just
catch you but which aspect did you think

2422
00:53:24,329 --> 00:53:24,339
catch you but which aspect did you think
 

2423
00:53:24,339 --> 00:53:26,130
catch you but which aspect did you think
of it you mentioned cybernetics did you

2424
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:26,140
of it you mentioned cybernetics did you
 

2425
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:28,260
of it you mentioned cybernetics did you
think of it as robotics or did you think

2426
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:28,270
think of it as robotics or did you think
 

2427
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:30,540
think of it as robotics or did you think
of it as almost constructing artificial

2428
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:30,550
of it as almost constructing artificial
 

2429
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:34,020
of it as almost constructing artificial
beings like is it the intelligent part

2430
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:34,030
beings like is it the intelligent part
 

2431
00:53:34,030 --> 00:53:37,050
beings like is it the intelligent part
that that captured your fascination or

2432
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:37,060
that that captured your fascination or
 

2433
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:38,700
that that captured your fascination or
was it the whole thing like even just

2434
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:38,710
was it the whole thing like even just
 

2435
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:40,890
was it the whole thing like even just
the limbs and just so for me it would

2436
00:53:40,890 --> 00:53:40,900
the limbs and just so for me it would
 

2437
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:43,950
the limbs and just so for me it would
have in another world I probably would

2438
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:43,960
have in another world I probably would
 

2439
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,140
have in another world I probably would
have been more of a biomedical engineer

2440
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:46,150
have been more of a biomedical engineer
 

2441
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:49,020
have been more of a biomedical engineer
because what fascinated me was the by on

2442
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:49,030
because what fascinated me was the by on
 

2443
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:50,910
because what fascinated me was the by on
it was the parts like the Bionic parts

2444
00:53:50,910 --> 00:53:50,920
it was the parts like the Bionic parts
 

2445
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:55,290
it was the parts like the Bionic parts
the limbs those aspects of it are you

2446
00:53:55,290 --> 00:53:55,300
the limbs those aspects of it are you
 

2447
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:57,000
the limbs those aspects of it are you
especially drawn to humanoid or

2448
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:57,010
especially drawn to humanoid or
 

2449
00:53:57,010 --> 00:54:00,750
especially drawn to humanoid or
human-like robots I would say human-like

2450
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:00,760
human-like robots I would say human-like
 

2451
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:03,480
human-like robots I would say human-like
not humanoid right and when I say

2452
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:03,490
not humanoid right and when I say
 

2453
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:06,000
not humanoid right and when I say
human-like I think it's this aspect of

2454
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:06,010
human-like I think it's this aspect of
 

2455
00:54:06,010 --> 00:54:09,270
human-like I think it's this aspect of
that interaction whether it's social and

2456
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:09,280
that interaction whether it's social and
 

2457
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,270
that interaction whether it's social and
it's like a dog right like that's

2458
00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:11,280
it's like a dog right like that's
 

2459
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:14,190
it's like a dog right like that's
human-like because it's understand us it

2460
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:14,200
human-like because it's understand us it
 

2461
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,770
human-like because it's understand us it
interacts with us at that very social

2462
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:16,780
interacts with us at that very social
 

2463
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:20,970
interacts with us at that very social
level - you know humanoids are part of

2464
00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:20,980
level - you know humanoids are part of
 

2465
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:24,660
level - you know humanoids are part of
that but only if they interact with us

2466
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:24,670
that but only if they interact with us
 

2467
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:28,650
that but only if they interact with us
as if we are human but just to linger on

2468
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:28,660
as if we are human but just to linger on
 

2469
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:31,800
as if we are human but just to linger on
NASA for a little bit what do you think

2470
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:31,810
NASA for a little bit what do you think
 

2471
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:34,230
NASA for a little bit what do you think
maybe if you have other memories but

2472
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:34,240
maybe if you have other memories but
 

2473
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,380
maybe if you have other memories but
also what do you think is the future of

2474
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:36,390
also what do you think is the future of
 

2475
00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:40,230
also what do you think is the future of
robots in space will mention how but

2476
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:40,240
robots in space will mention how but
 

2477
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,359
robots in space will mention how but
there's incredible robots and NASA's

2478
00:54:42,359 --> 00:54:42,369
there's incredible robots and NASA's
 

2479
00:54:42,369 --> 00:54:44,190
there's incredible robots and NASA's
working on in general thinking about in

2480
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:44,200
working on in general thinking about in
 

2481
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:49,109
working on in general thinking about in
art as we venture out human civilization

2482
00:54:49,109 --> 00:54:49,119
art as we venture out human civilization
 

2483
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,730
art as we venture out human civilization
ventures out into space what do you

2484
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:50,740
ventures out into space what do you
 

2485
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:52,380
ventures out into space what do you
think the future of robots is there yes

2486
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:52,390
think the future of robots is there yes
 

2487
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:53,849
think the future of robots is there yes
so I mean there's the near term for

2488
00:54:53,849 --> 00:54:53,859
so I mean there's the near term for
 

2489
00:54:53,859 --> 00:54:56,400
so I mean there's the near term for
example they just announced the the

2490
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:56,410
example they just announced the the
 

2491
00:54:56,410 --> 00:55:00,329
example they just announced the the
rover that's going to the moon which you

2492
00:55:00,329 --> 00:55:00,339
rover that's going to the moon which you
 

2493
00:55:00,339 --> 00:55:03,480
rover that's going to the moon which you
know that's kind of exciting but that's

2494
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:03,490
know that's kind of exciting but that's
 

2495
00:55:03,490 --> 00:55:07,890
know that's kind of exciting but that's
like near-term you know my favorite

2496
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:07,900
like near-term you know my favorite
 

2497
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:11,599
like near-term you know my favorite
favorite favorite series is Star Trek

2498
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:11,609
favorite favorite series is Star Trek
 

2499
00:55:11,609 --> 00:55:16,380
favorite favorite series is Star Trek
right you know I really hope and even

2500
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:16,390
right you know I really hope and even
 

2501
00:55:16,390 --> 00:55:18,540
right you know I really hope and even
Star Trek like if I calculate the years

2502
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:18,550
Star Trek like if I calculate the years
 

2503
00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:22,370
Star Trek like if I calculate the years
I wouldn't be alive but I would really

2504
00:55:22,370 --> 00:55:22,380
I wouldn't be alive but I would really
 

2505
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:26,849
I wouldn't be alive but I would really
really love to be in that world like

2506
00:55:26,849 --> 00:55:26,859
really love to be in that world like
 

2507
00:55:26,859 --> 00:55:28,620
really love to be in that world like
even if it's just at the beginning like

2508
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:28,630
even if it's just at the beginning like
 

2509
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:30,900
even if it's just at the beginning like
you know like voyage

2510
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:30,910
you know like voyage
 

2511
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:34,109
you know like voyage
like adventure one so basically living

2512
00:55:34,109 --> 00:55:34,119
like adventure one so basically living
 

2513
00:55:34,119 --> 00:55:37,859
like adventure one so basically living
in space yeah with what what robots

2514
00:55:37,859 --> 00:55:37,869
in space yeah with what what robots
 

2515
00:55:37,869 --> 00:55:41,220
in space yeah with what what robots
would a robots do data were roll the

2516
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:41,230
would a robots do data were roll the
 

2517
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:42,329
would a robots do data were roll the
data would have to be even though that

2518
00:55:42,329 --> 00:55:42,339
data would have to be even though that
 

2519
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:44,549
data would have to be even though that
wasn't you know that was like later but

2520
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:44,559
wasn't you know that was like later but
 

2521
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:48,270
wasn't you know that was like later but
so data is a robot that has human-like

2522
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:48,280
so data is a robot that has human-like
 

2523
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,279
so data is a robot that has human-like
qualities right without the emotion ship

2524
00:55:50,279 --> 00:55:50,289
qualities right without the emotion ship
 

2525
00:55:50,289 --> 00:55:52,859
qualities right without the emotion ship
yeah you don't like emotion well they

2526
00:55:52,859 --> 00:55:52,869
yeah you don't like emotion well they
 

2527
00:55:52,869 --> 00:55:56,309
yeah you don't like emotion well they
know what the emotion ship was kind of a

2528
00:55:56,309 --> 00:55:56,319
know what the emotion ship was kind of a
 

2529
00:55:56,319 --> 00:56:02,250
know what the emotion ship was kind of a
mess right it took a while for for that

2530
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:02,260
mess right it took a while for for that
 

2531
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:07,349
mess right it took a while for for that
thing to adapt but and and so why was

2532
00:56:07,349 --> 00:56:07,359
thing to adapt but and and so why was
 

2533
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:10,819
thing to adapt but and and so why was
that an issue the issue is is that

2534
00:56:10,819 --> 00:56:10,829
that an issue the issue is is that
 

2535
00:56:10,829 --> 00:56:13,680
that an issue the issue is is that
emotions make us irrational agents

2536
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:13,690
emotions make us irrational agents
 

2537
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:17,400
emotions make us irrational agents
that's the problem and yet he could

2538
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:17,410
that's the problem and yet he could
 

2539
00:56:17,410 --> 00:56:20,940
that's the problem and yet he could
think through things even if it was

2540
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:20,950
think through things even if it was
 

2541
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:23,160
think through things even if it was
based on an emotional scenario right

2542
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:23,170
based on an emotional scenario right
 

2543
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:25,770
based on an emotional scenario right
based on pros and cons but as soon as

2544
00:56:25,770 --> 00:56:25,780
based on pros and cons but as soon as
 

2545
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:29,370
based on pros and cons but as soon as
you made him emotional one of the

2546
00:56:29,370 --> 00:56:29,380
you made him emotional one of the
 

2547
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:31,440
you made him emotional one of the
metrics he used for evaluation was his

2548
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:31,450
metrics he used for evaluation was his
 

2549
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:35,099
metrics he used for evaluation was his
own emotions not people around him right

2550
00:56:35,099 --> 00:56:35,109
own emotions not people around him right
 

2551
00:56:35,109 --> 00:56:38,430
own emotions not people around him right
like and so we do that as children right

2552
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:38,440
like and so we do that as children right
 

2553
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:41,370
like and so we do that as children right
so we're very egocentric we're very

2554
00:56:41,370 --> 00:56:41,380
so we're very egocentric we're very
 

2555
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:44,130
so we're very egocentric we're very
egocentric and so isn't that just an

2556
00:56:44,130 --> 00:56:44,140
egocentric and so isn't that just an
 

2557
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:46,140
egocentric and so isn't that just an
early version of the emotion ship then I

2558
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:46,150
early version of the emotion ship then I
 

2559
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:49,289
early version of the emotion ship then I
haven't watched much Star Trek I have

2560
00:56:49,289 --> 00:56:49,299
haven't watched much Star Trek I have
 

2561
00:56:49,299 --> 00:56:53,130
haven't watched much Star Trek I have
also met adults right and so that is

2562
00:56:53,130 --> 00:56:53,140
also met adults right and so that is
 

2563
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:55,500
also met adults right and so that is
that is a developmental process and I'm

2564
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:55,510
that is a developmental process and I'm
 

2565
00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:57,450
that is a developmental process and I'm
sure there's a bunch of psychologists

2566
00:56:57,450 --> 00:56:57,460
sure there's a bunch of psychologists
 

2567
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:59,549
sure there's a bunch of psychologists
that can go through like you can have a

2568
00:56:59,549 --> 00:56:59,559
that can go through like you can have a
 

2569
00:56:59,559 --> 00:57:02,309
that can go through like you can have a
six-year-old dolt who has the emotional

2570
00:57:02,309 --> 00:57:02,319
six-year-old dolt who has the emotional
 

2571
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:04,920
six-year-old dolt who has the emotional
maturity of a ten-year-old right and so

2572
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:04,930
maturity of a ten-year-old right and so
 

2573
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:07,440
maturity of a ten-year-old right and so
there's various phases that people

2574
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:07,450
there's various phases that people
 

2575
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:10,049
there's various phases that people
should go through in order to evolve and

2576
00:57:10,049 --> 00:57:10,059
should go through in order to evolve and
 

2577
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:11,930
should go through in order to evolve and
sometimes you don't so how much

2578
00:57:11,930 --> 00:57:11,940
sometimes you don't so how much
 

2579
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:15,539
sometimes you don't so how much
psychology do you think a topic that's

2580
00:57:15,539 --> 00:57:15,549
psychology do you think a topic that's
 

2581
00:57:15,549 --> 00:57:18,329
psychology do you think a topic that's
rarely mentioned in robotics but how

2582
00:57:18,329 --> 00:57:18,339
rarely mentioned in robotics but how
 

2583
00:57:18,339 --> 00:57:19,829
rarely mentioned in robotics but how
much the psychology come to play when

2584
00:57:19,829 --> 00:57:19,839
much the psychology come to play when
 

2585
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:22,829
much the psychology come to play when
you're talking about HRI human robot

2586
00:57:22,829 --> 00:57:22,839
you're talking about HRI human robot
 

2587
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:24,839
you're talking about HRI human robot
interaction when you have to have robots

2588
00:57:24,839 --> 00:57:24,849
interaction when you have to have robots
 

2589
00:57:24,849 --> 00:57:26,730
interaction when you have to have robots
that actually interact with you tons so

2590
00:57:26,730 --> 00:57:26,740
that actually interact with you tons so
 

2591
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:31,079
that actually interact with you tons so
we like my group as well as I read a lot

2592
00:57:31,079 --> 00:57:31,089
we like my group as well as I read a lot
 

2593
00:57:31,089 --> 00:57:33,329
we like my group as well as I read a lot
in the cognitive science literature as

2594
00:57:33,329 --> 00:57:33,339
in the cognitive science literature as
 

2595
00:57:33,339 --> 00:57:35,299
in the cognitive science literature as
well as the psychology literature

2596
00:57:35,299 --> 00:57:35,309
well as the psychology literature
 

2597
00:57:35,309 --> 00:57:40,170
well as the psychology literature
because they understand a lot about

2598
00:57:40,170 --> 00:57:40,180
because they understand a lot about
 

2599
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:43,440
because they understand a lot about
human human relations and developmental

2600
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:43,450
human human relations and developmental
 

2601
00:57:43,450 --> 00:57:44,790
human human relations and developmental
milestones

2602
00:57:44,790 --> 00:57:44,800
milestones
 

2603
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:48,540
milestones
things like that and so we tend to look

2604
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:48,550
things like that and so we tend to look
 

2605
00:57:48,550 --> 00:57:52,550
things like that and so we tend to look
to see what what's been done out there

2606
00:57:52,550 --> 00:57:52,560
to see what what's been done out there
 

2607
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:54,900
to see what what's been done out there
sometimes what we'll do is we'll try to

2608
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:54,910
sometimes what we'll do is we'll try to
 

2609
00:57:54,910 --> 00:57:57,750
sometimes what we'll do is we'll try to
match that to see is that human human

2610
00:57:57,750 --> 00:57:57,760
match that to see is that human human
 

2611
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:00,410
match that to see is that human human
relationship the same as human robot

2612
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:00,420
relationship the same as human robot
 

2613
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:02,610
relationship the same as human robot
sometimes it is and sometimes is

2614
00:58:02,610 --> 00:58:02,620
sometimes it is and sometimes is
 

2615
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:04,080
sometimes it is and sometimes is
different and then when it's different

2616
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:04,090
different and then when it's different
 

2617
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:06,660
different and then when it's different
we have to we try to figure out okay why

2618
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:06,670
we have to we try to figure out okay why
 

2619
00:58:06,670 --> 00:58:09,180
we have to we try to figure out okay why
is it different in this scenario but

2620
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:09,190
is it different in this scenario but
 

2621
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:10,920
is it different in this scenario but
it's the same in the other scenario

2622
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:10,930
it's the same in the other scenario
 

2623
00:58:10,930 --> 00:58:14,130
it's the same in the other scenario
right and so we try to do that quite a

2624
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:14,140
right and so we try to do that quite a
 

2625
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:16,650
right and so we try to do that quite a
bit would you say that's if we're

2626
00:58:16,650 --> 00:58:16,660
bit would you say that's if we're
 

2627
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,450
bit would you say that's if we're
looking at the future of human robot

2628
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:18,460
looking at the future of human robot
 

2629
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:20,370
looking at the future of human robot
interaction would you say the psychology

2630
00:58:20,370 --> 00:58:20,380
interaction would you say the psychology
 

2631
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:23,310
interaction would you say the psychology
piece is the hardest like if it's I mean

2632
00:58:23,310 --> 00:58:23,320
piece is the hardest like if it's I mean
 

2633
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:25,980
piece is the hardest like if it's I mean
it's a funny notion for you as I don't

2634
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:25,990
it's a funny notion for you as I don't
 

2635
00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:27,870
it's a funny notion for you as I don't
know if you consider yeah I mean one way

2636
00:58:27,870 --> 00:58:27,880
know if you consider yeah I mean one way
 

2637
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:29,430
know if you consider yeah I mean one way
to ask it do you consider yourself for

2638
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:29,440
to ask it do you consider yourself for
 

2639
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,070
to ask it do you consider yourself for
roboticist or psychologists oh I

2640
00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:32,080
roboticist or psychologists oh I
 

2641
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:34,140
roboticist or psychologists oh I
consider myself a robot is's that plays

2642
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:34,150
consider myself a robot is's that plays
 

2643
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:36,780
consider myself a robot is's that plays
the act of a psychologist but if you

2644
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:36,790
the act of a psychologist but if you
 

2645
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:39,900
the act of a psychologist but if you
were look at yourself sort of you know

2646
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:39,910
were look at yourself sort of you know
 

2647
00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:43,260
were look at yourself sort of you know
20 30 years from now do you see yourself

2648
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:43,270
20 30 years from now do you see yourself
 

2649
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:46,820
20 30 years from now do you see yourself
more and more wearing the psychology hat

2650
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:46,830
more and more wearing the psychology hat
 

2651
00:58:46,830 --> 00:58:49,650
more and more wearing the psychology hat
another way to put it is are the hard

2652
00:58:49,650 --> 00:58:49,660
another way to put it is are the hard
 

2653
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:51,540
another way to put it is are the hard
problems in human robot interactions

2654
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:51,550
problems in human robot interactions
 

2655
00:58:51,550 --> 00:58:54,750
problems in human robot interactions
fundamentally psychology or is it still

2656
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:54,760
fundamentally psychology or is it still
 

2657
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:57,150
fundamentally psychology or is it still
robotics the perception of manipulation

2658
00:58:57,150 --> 00:58:57,160
robotics the perception of manipulation
 

2659
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:59,580
robotics the perception of manipulation
planning all that kind of stuff it's

2660
00:58:59,580 --> 00:58:59,590
planning all that kind of stuff it's
 

2661
00:58:59,590 --> 00:59:03,240
planning all that kind of stuff it's
actually neither the hardest part is the

2662
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:03,250
actually neither the hardest part is the
 

2663
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:06,300
actually neither the hardest part is the
adaptation in the interaction so

2664
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:06,310
adaptation in the interaction so
 

2665
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:08,460
adaptation in the interaction so
learning it's the interface it's the

2666
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:08,470
learning it's the interface it's the
 

2667
00:59:08,470 --> 00:59:11,970
learning it's the interface it's the
learning and so if I think of like I've

2668
00:59:11,970 --> 00:59:11,980
learning and so if I think of like I've
 

2669
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:15,960
learning and so if I think of like I've
become much more of a roboticist /ai

2670
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:15,970
become much more of a roboticist /ai
 

2671
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:18,960
become much more of a roboticist /ai
person then when I like originally again

2672
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:18,970
person then when I like originally again
 

2673
00:59:18,970 --> 00:59:20,880
person then when I like originally again
I was about the bionics I was looking I

2674
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:20,890
I was about the bionics I was looking I
 

2675
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,620
I was about the bionics I was looking I
was electrical engineer I was control

2676
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:22,630
was electrical engineer I was control
 

2677
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:24,930
was electrical engineer I was control
theory right like and then I started

2678
00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:24,940
theory right like and then I started
 

2679
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:29,340
theory right like and then I started
realizing that my algorithms needed like

2680
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:29,350
realizing that my algorithms needed like
 

2681
00:59:29,350 --> 00:59:31,140
realizing that my algorithms needed like
human data right and so that I was like

2682
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:31,150
human data right and so that I was like
 

2683
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:32,940
human data right and so that I was like
okay what is this human thing but how do

2684
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:32,950
okay what is this human thing but how do
 

2685
00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:34,800
okay what is this human thing but how do
I incorporate human data and then I

2686
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:34,810
I incorporate human data and then I
 

2687
00:59:34,810 --> 00:59:38,790
I incorporate human data and then I
realized that human perception had there

2688
00:59:38,790 --> 00:59:38,800
realized that human perception had there
 

2689
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,500
realized that human perception had there
was a lot in terms of how we perceived

2690
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:40,510
was a lot in terms of how we perceived
 

2691
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:41,880
was a lot in terms of how we perceived
the world it's so trying to figure out

2692
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:41,890
the world it's so trying to figure out
 

2693
00:59:41,890 --> 00:59:43,530
the world it's so trying to figure out
how do i model human perception for my

2694
00:59:43,530 --> 00:59:43,540
how do i model human perception for my
 

2695
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:48,030
how do i model human perception for my
and so I became a HRI person human robot

2696
00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:48,040
and so I became a HRI person human robot
 

2697
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:50,760
and so I became a HRI person human robot
interaction person from being a control

2698
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:50,770
interaction person from being a control
 

2699
00:59:50,770 --> 00:59:52,410
interaction person from being a control
theory and realizing that humans

2700
00:59:52,410 --> 00:59:52,420
theory and realizing that humans
 

2701
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:55,440
theory and realizing that humans
actually offered quite a bit and then

2702
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:55,450
actually offered quite a bit and then
 

2703
00:59:55,450 --> 00:59:57,310
actually offered quite a bit and then
when you do that you become one more of

2704
00:59:57,310 --> 00:59:57,320
when you do that you become one more of
 

2705
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:00,460
when you do that you become one more of
artificial intelligence AI and so I see

2706
01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:00,470
artificial intelligence AI and so I see
 

2707
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:05,010
artificial intelligence AI and so I see
myself evolving more in this AI world

2708
01:00:05,010 --> 01:00:05,020
myself evolving more in this AI world
 

2709
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:09,070
myself evolving more in this AI world
under the lens of robotics

2710
01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:09,080
under the lens of robotics
 

2711
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:11,350
under the lens of robotics
having Hardware interacting with people

2712
01:00:11,350 --> 01:00:11,360
having Hardware interacting with people
 

2713
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:15,520
having Hardware interacting with people
so you're a world-class expert

2714
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:15,530
so you're a world-class expert
 

2715
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:19,120
so you're a world-class expert
researcher in robotics and yet others

2716
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:19,130
researcher in robotics and yet others
 

2717
01:00:19,130 --> 01:00:22,030
researcher in robotics and yet others
you know there's a few it's a small but

2718
01:00:22,030 --> 01:00:22,040
you know there's a few it's a small but
 

2719
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:24,970
you know there's a few it's a small but
fierce community of people but most of

2720
01:00:24,970 --> 01:00:24,980
fierce community of people but most of
 

2721
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:27,160
fierce community of people but most of
them don't take the journey into the h

2722
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:27,170
them don't take the journey into the h
 

2723
01:00:27,170 --> 01:00:30,640
them don't take the journey into the h
of HR I into the human so why did you

2724
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:30,650
of HR I into the human so why did you
 

2725
01:00:30,650 --> 01:00:33,430
of HR I into the human so why did you
brave into the interaction with humans

2726
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:33,440
brave into the interaction with humans
 

2727
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:36,970
brave into the interaction with humans
it seems like a really hard problem it's

2728
01:00:36,970 --> 01:00:36,980
it seems like a really hard problem it's
 

2729
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:39,070
it seems like a really hard problem it's
a hard problem and it's very risky as an

2730
01:00:39,070 --> 01:00:39,080
a hard problem and it's very risky as an
 

2731
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:43,540
a hard problem and it's very risky as an
academic yes and I knew that when I

2732
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:43,550
academic yes and I knew that when I
 

2733
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:46,870
academic yes and I knew that when I
started down that journey that it was

2734
01:00:46,870 --> 01:00:46,880
started down that journey that it was
 

2735
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:50,440
started down that journey that it was
very risky as an academic in this world

2736
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:50,450
very risky as an academic in this world
 

2737
01:00:50,450 --> 01:00:53,110
very risky as an academic in this world
that was nuanced it was just developing

2738
01:00:53,110 --> 01:00:53,120
that was nuanced it was just developing
 

2739
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:55,420
that was nuanced it was just developing
we didn't have a conference right at the

2740
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:55,430
we didn't have a conference right at the
 

2741
01:00:55,430 --> 01:00:58,780
we didn't have a conference right at the
time because it was the interesting

2742
01:00:58,780 --> 01:00:58,790
time because it was the interesting
 

2743
01:00:58,790 --> 01:01:02,580
time because it was the interesting
problems that was what drove me it was

2744
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:02,590
problems that was what drove me it was
 

2745
01:01:02,590 --> 01:01:06,520
problems that was what drove me it was
the fact that I looked at what interests

2746
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:06,530
the fact that I looked at what interests
 

2747
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:08,980
the fact that I looked at what interests
me in terms of the application space and

2748
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:08,990
me in terms of the application space and
 

2749
01:01:08,990 --> 01:01:12,600
me in terms of the application space and
the problems and that pushed me into

2750
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:12,610
the problems and that pushed me into
 

2751
01:01:12,610 --> 01:01:15,580
the problems and that pushed me into
trying to figure out what people were

2752
01:01:15,580 --> 01:01:15,590
trying to figure out what people were
 

2753
01:01:15,590 --> 01:01:17,740
trying to figure out what people were
and what humans were and how to adapt to

2754
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:17,750
and what humans were and how to adapt to
 

2755
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:20,290
and what humans were and how to adapt to
them if those problems weren't so

2756
01:01:20,290 --> 01:01:20,300
them if those problems weren't so
 

2757
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:22,960
them if those problems weren't so
interesting I'd probably still be

2758
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:22,970
interesting I'd probably still be
 

2759
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:26,680
interesting I'd probably still be
sending Rovers to glaciers right but the

2760
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:26,690
sending Rovers to glaciers right but the
 

2761
01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:28,570
sending Rovers to glaciers right but the
problems were interesting and the other

2762
01:01:28,570 --> 01:01:28,580
problems were interesting and the other
 

2763
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:30,730
problems were interesting and the other
thing was that they were hard right so

2764
01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:30,740
thing was that they were hard right so
 

2765
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:33,970
thing was that they were hard right so
it's I like having to go into a room and

2766
01:01:33,970 --> 01:01:33,980
it's I like having to go into a room and
 

2767
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:37,480
it's I like having to go into a room and
being like I don't know and then going

2768
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:37,490
being like I don't know and then going
 

2769
01:01:37,490 --> 01:01:38,770
being like I don't know and then going
back and saying okay I'm gonna figure

2770
01:01:38,770 --> 01:01:38,780
back and saying okay I'm gonna figure
 

2771
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:41,740
back and saying okay I'm gonna figure
this out I do not I'm not driven when I

2772
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:41,750
this out I do not I'm not driven when I
 

2773
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:43,540
this out I do not I'm not driven when I
go in like oh there are no surprises

2774
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:43,550
go in like oh there are no surprises
 

2775
01:01:43,550 --> 01:01:47,410
go in like oh there are no surprises
like I don't find that satisfying if

2776
01:01:47,410 --> 01:01:47,420
like I don't find that satisfying if
 

2777
01:01:47,420 --> 01:01:49,090
like I don't find that satisfying if
that was the case I go someplace and

2778
01:01:49,090 --> 01:01:49,100
that was the case I go someplace and
 

2779
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:51,520
that was the case I go someplace and
make a lot more money right I think I

2780
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:51,530
make a lot more money right I think I
 

2781
01:01:51,530 --> 01:01:54,310
make a lot more money right I think I
stay in academic because and choose to

2782
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:54,320
stay in academic because and choose to
 

2783
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:55,810
stay in academic because and choose to
do this because I can go into a room

2784
01:01:55,810 --> 01:01:55,820
do this because I can go into a room
 

2785
01:01:55,820 --> 01:01:59,710
do this because I can go into a room
like that's hard yeah I think just for

2786
01:01:59,710 --> 01:01:59,720
like that's hard yeah I think just for
 

2787
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:02,710
like that's hard yeah I think just for
my perspective maybe you can correct me

2788
01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:02,720
my perspective maybe you can correct me
 

2789
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:05,410
my perspective maybe you can correct me
on it but if I just look at the field of

2790
01:02:05,410 --> 01:02:05,420
on it but if I just look at the field of
 

2791
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:08,680
on it but if I just look at the field of
AI broadly it seems that human robot

2792
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:08,690
AI broadly it seems that human robot
 

2793
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:10,089
AI broadly it seems that human robot
interaction

2794
01:02:10,089 --> 01:02:10,099
interaction
 

2795
01:02:10,099 --> 01:02:14,710
interaction
has the most one of the most number of

2796
01:02:14,710 --> 01:02:14,720
has the most one of the most number of
 

2797
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:18,819
has the most one of the most number of
open problems people especially relative

2798
01:02:18,819 --> 01:02:18,829
open problems people especially relative
 

2799
01:02:18,829 --> 01:02:21,009
open problems people especially relative
to how many people are willing to

2800
01:02:21,009 --> 01:02:21,019
to how many people are willing to
 

2801
01:02:21,019 --> 01:02:24,099
to how many people are willing to
acknowledge that there are this because

2802
01:02:24,099 --> 01:02:24,109
acknowledge that there are this because
 

2803
01:02:24,109 --> 01:02:26,019
acknowledge that there are this because
most people are just afraid of the human

2804
01:02:26,019 --> 01:02:26,029
most people are just afraid of the human
 

2805
01:02:26,029 --> 01:02:27,430
most people are just afraid of the human
so they don't even acknowledge how many

2806
01:02:27,430 --> 01:02:27,440
so they don't even acknowledge how many
 

2807
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:29,410
so they don't even acknowledge how many
open problems are but it's a in terms of

2808
01:02:29,410 --> 01:02:29,420
open problems are but it's a in terms of
 

2809
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:31,299
open problems are but it's a in terms of
difficult problems to solve exciting

2810
01:02:31,299 --> 01:02:31,309
difficult problems to solve exciting
 

2811
01:02:31,309 --> 01:02:35,140
difficult problems to solve exciting
spaces it seems to be an incredible for

2812
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:35,150
spaces it seems to be an incredible for
 

2813
01:02:35,150 --> 01:02:37,779
spaces it seems to be an incredible for
that it is it is exciting

01:02:37,779 --> 01:02:37,789
that it is it is exciting

trap so some of the things I study in

2824
01:02:53,079 --> 01:02:53,089
trap so some of the things I study in
 

2825
01:02:53,089 --> 01:02:55,479
trap so some of the things I study in
this domain is not just trust but it

2826
01:02:55,479 --> 01:02:55,489
this domain is not just trust but it
 

2827
01:02:55,489 --> 01:02:57,370
this domain is not just trust but it
really is over trust how do you think

2828
01:02:57,370 --> 01:02:57,380
really is over trust how do you think
 

2829
01:02:57,380 --> 01:02:59,529
really is over trust how do you think
about over traffic what is for so what

2830
01:02:59,529 --> 01:02:59,539
about over traffic what is for so what
 

2831
01:02:59,539 --> 01:03:03,160
about over traffic what is for so what
is what is trust and what is overdressed

2832
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:03,170
is what is trust and what is overdressed
 

2833
01:03:03,170 --> 01:03:06,039
is what is trust and what is overdressed
basically the way I look at it is trust

2834
01:03:06,039 --> 01:03:06,049
basically the way I look at it is trust
 

2835
01:03:06,049 --> 01:03:07,779
basically the way I look at it is trust
is not what you click on a survey just

2836
01:03:07,779 --> 01:03:07,789
is not what you click on a survey just
 

2837
01:03:07,789 --> 01:03:10,089
is not what you click on a survey just
this is about your behavior so if you

2838
01:03:10,089 --> 01:03:10,099
this is about your behavior so if you
 

2839
01:03:10,099 --> 01:03:13,989
this is about your behavior so if you
interact with the technology based on

2840
01:03:13,989 --> 01:03:13,999
interact with the technology based on
 

2841
01:03:13,999 --> 01:03:16,569
interact with the technology based on
the decision are the actions of the

2842
01:03:16,569 --> 01:03:16,579
the decision are the actions of the
 

2843
01:03:16,579 --> 01:03:19,150
the decision are the actions of the
technology as if you trust that decision

2844
01:03:19,150 --> 01:03:19,160
technology as if you trust that decision
 

2845
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:23,170
technology as if you trust that decision
then you're trusting right and I mean

2846
01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:23,180
then you're trusting right and I mean
 

2847
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:25,690
then you're trusting right and I mean
even in my group we've done surveys that

2848
01:03:25,690 --> 01:03:25,700
even in my group we've done surveys that
 

2849
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:27,759
even in my group we've done surveys that
you know on the thing do my you trust

2850
01:03:27,759 --> 01:03:27,769
you know on the thing do my you trust
 

2851
01:03:27,769 --> 01:03:28,209
you know on the thing do my you trust
robots

2852
01:03:28,209 --> 01:03:28,219
robots
 

2853
01:03:28,219 --> 01:03:29,769
robots
of course not would you follow this

2854
01:03:29,769 --> 01:03:29,779
of course not would you follow this
 

2855
01:03:29,779 --> 01:03:32,019
of course not would you follow this
robot in a burning building of course

2856
01:03:32,019 --> 01:03:32,029
robot in a burning building of course
 

2857
01:03:32,029 --> 01:03:33,700
robot in a burning building of course
not right and then you look at their

2858
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:33,710
not right and then you look at their
 

2859
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:36,130
not right and then you look at their
actions and you're like clearly your

2860
01:03:36,130 --> 01:03:36,140
actions and you're like clearly your
 

2861
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:38,799
actions and you're like clearly your
behavior does not match what you think

2862
01:03:38,799 --> 01:03:38,809
behavior does not match what you think
 

2863
01:03:38,809 --> 01:03:40,930
behavior does not match what you think
right or which you think you would like

2864
01:03:40,930 --> 01:03:40,940
right or which you think you would like
 

2865
01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:42,489
right or which you think you would like
to think right and so I'm really

2866
01:03:42,489 --> 01:03:42,499
to think right and so I'm really
 

2867
01:03:42,499 --> 01:03:44,140
to think right and so I'm really
concerned about the behavior because

2868
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:44,150
concerned about the behavior because
 

2869
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:45,940
concerned about the behavior because
that's really at the end of the day when

2870
01:03:45,940 --> 01:03:45,950
that's really at the end of the day when
 

2871
01:03:45,950 --> 01:03:48,459
that's really at the end of the day when
you're in the world that's what will

2872
01:03:48,459 --> 01:03:48,469
you're in the world that's what will
 

2873
01:03:48,469 --> 01:03:50,799
you're in the world that's what will
impact others around you it's not

2874
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:50,809
impact others around you it's not
 

2875
01:03:50,809 --> 01:03:52,749
impact others around you it's not
whether before you went onto the street

2876
01:03:52,749 --> 01:03:52,759
whether before you went onto the street
 

2877
01:03:52,759 --> 01:03:54,729
whether before you went onto the street
you you clicked on like I don't trust

2878
01:03:54,729 --> 01:03:54,739
you you clicked on like I don't trust
 

2879
01:03:54,739 --> 01:03:57,549
you you clicked on like I don't trust
self-driving cars you know that from an

2880
01:03:57,549 --> 01:03:57,559
self-driving cars you know that from an
 

2881
01:03:57,559 --> 01:03:59,049
self-driving cars you know that from an
outsider perspective it's always

2882
01:03:59,049 --> 01:03:59,059
outsider perspective it's always
 

2883
01:03:59,059 --> 01:04:01,569
outsider perspective it's always
frustrating to me well I read a lot so

2884
01:04:01,569 --> 01:04:01,579
frustrating to me well I read a lot so
 

2885
01:04:01,579 --> 01:04:03,249

I'm Insider in a certain philosophical

2886
01:04:03,249 --> 01:04:03,259
I'm Insider in a certain philosophical
 

2887
01:04:03,259 --> 01:04:07,690
I'm Insider in a certain philosophical
sense the it's frustrating to me how

2888
01:04:07,690 --> 01:04:07,700
sense the it's frustrating to me how
 

2889
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:11,410
sense the it's frustrating to me how
often Trust is used in surveys and how

2890
01:04:11,410 --> 01:04:11,420
often Trust is used in surveys and how
 

2891
01:04:11,420 --> 01:04:14,769
often Trust is used in surveys and how
people say make claims that have any

2892
01:04:14,769 --> 01:04:14,779
people say make claims that have any
 

2893
01:04:14,779 --> 01:04:16,839
people say make claims that have any
kind of finding they make about somebody

2894
01:04:16,839 --> 01:04:16,849
kind of finding they make about somebody
 

2895
01:04:16,849 --> 01:04:22,240
kind of finding they make about somebody
clicking on answer you just trust is uh

2896
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:22,250

 

2897
01:04:22,250 --> 01:04:24,640

yet behavior just you said it beautiful

2898
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:24,650
yet behavior just you said it beautiful
 

2899
01:04:24,650 --> 01:04:26,500
yet behavior just you said it beautiful
I mean the action your own behavior as

2900
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:26,510
I mean the action your own behavior as
 

2901
01:04:26,510 --> 01:04:29,140
I mean the action your own behavior as
is what Trust is I mean that everything

2902
01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:29,150
is what Trust is I mean that everything
 

2903
01:04:29,150 --> 01:04:30,550
is what Trust is I mean that everything
else is not even close

2904
01:04:30,550 --> 01:04:30,560
else is not even close
 

2905
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:36,070
else is not even close
it's almost like a absurd comedic poetry

2906
01:04:36,070 --> 01:04:36,080
it's almost like a absurd comedic poetry
 

2907
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:37,930
it's almost like a absurd comedic poetry
that you weave around your actual

2908
01:04:37,930 --> 01:04:37,940
that you weave around your actual
 

2909
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:40,180
that you weave around your actual
behavior so some people can say they're

2910
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:40,190
behavior so some people can say they're
 

2911
01:04:40,190 --> 01:04:41,560
behavior so some people can say they're
they their trust

speaks volumes but their car probably

2918
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:51,440
speaks volumes but their car probably

yeah it's like even if you think about

2924
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:56,510
yeah it's like even if you think about
 

2925
01:04:56,510 --> 01:04:58,630
yeah it's like even if you think about
cars I think it's a beautiful case I

01:05:06,910 --> 01:05:06,920
it first came out I I bet if they had
 

2933
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:08,980
it first came out I I bet if they had
had a survey would you get in the car

2934

had a survey would you get in the car
 

2935

01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:17,290
many people do you would think would
have said like really you know wait even

2940
01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:17,300
have said like really you know wait even
 

2941
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:18,880
have said like really you know wait even
worse would you get in the car with a

2942
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:18,890
worse would you get in the car with a
 

2943
01:05:18,890 --> 01:05:22,090
worse would you get in the car with a
stranger at 1:00 a.m. in the morning to

2944
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:22,100
stranger at 1:00 a.m. in the morning to
 

2945
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:24,220
stranger at 1:00 a.m. in the morning to
have them drop you home as a single

2946
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:24,230
have them drop you home as a single
 

2947
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:26,620
have them drop you home as a single
female yeah like how many people would

2948
01:05:26,620 --> 01:05:26,630
female yeah like how many people would
 

2949
01:05:26,630 --> 01:05:30,730
female yeah like how many people would
say that's stupid yeah and now look at

2950
01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:30,740
say that's stupid yeah and now look at
 

2951
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:31,450
say that's stupid yeah and now look at
where we are

2952
01:05:31,450 --> 01:05:31,460
where we are
 

2953
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:34,330
where we are
I mean people put kids like great links

2954
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:34,340
I mean people put kids like great links
 

2955
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:37,810
I mean people put kids like great links
oh yeah my child has to go to school and

2956
01:05:37,810 --> 01:05:37,820
oh yeah my child has to go to school and
 

2957
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:40,480
oh yeah my child has to go to school and
I yeah I'm gonna put my kid in this car

2958
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:40,490
I yeah I'm gonna put my kid in this car
 

2959
01:05:40,490 --> 01:05:43,480
I yeah I'm gonna put my kid in this car
with a stranger yeah I mean it's just a

2960
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:43,490
with a stranger yeah I mean it's just a
 

2961
01:05:43,490 --> 01:05:46,420
with a stranger yeah I mean it's just a
fascinating how like what we think we

2962
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:46,430
fascinating how like what we think we
 

2963
01:05:46,430 --> 01:05:48,820
fascinating how like what we think we
think is not necessarily matching our

2964
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:48,830
think is not necessarily matching our
 

2965
01:05:48,830 --> 01:05:51,550
think is not necessarily matching our
behavior and certainly with robots for

2966
01:05:51,550 --> 01:05:51,560
behavior and certainly with robots for
 

2967
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:53,140
behavior and certainly with robots for
the tallest vehicles and and all all the

2968
01:05:53,140 --> 01:05:53,150
the tallest vehicles and and all all the
 

2969
01:05:53,150 --> 01:05:55,080
the tallest vehicles and and all all the
kinds of robots you work with that's

2970
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:55,090
kinds of robots you work with that's
 

2971
01:05:55,090 --> 01:06:00,370
kinds of robots you work with that's
it's yeah it's the way you answer it

2972
01:06:00,370 --> 01:06:00,380
it's yeah it's the way you answer it
 

2973
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:01,810
it's yeah it's the way you answer it
especially if you've never interacted

2974
01:06:01,810 --> 01:06:01,820
especially if you've never interacted
 

2975
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:04,900
especially if you've never interacted
with that robot before if you haven't

2976
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:04,910
with that robot before if you haven't
 

2977
01:06:04,910 --> 01:06:06,310
with that robot before if you haven't
had the experience you're being able to

2978
01:06:06,310 --> 01:06:06,320
had the experience you're being able to
 

2979
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:08,800
had the experience you're being able to
respond correctly I know surveys is

2980
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:08,810
respond correctly I know surveys is
 

2981
01:06:08,810 --> 01:06:11,109
respond correctly I know surveys is
impossible but what do you what role

2982
01:06:11,109 --> 01:06:11,119
impossible but what do you what role
 

2983
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:13,480
impossible but what do you what role
does trust play in the interaction do

2984
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:13,490
does trust play in the interaction do
 

2985
01:06:13,490 --> 01:06:16,780
does trust play in the interaction do
you think like is it good - is it good

2986
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:16,790
you think like is it good - is it good
 

2987
01:06:16,790 --> 01:06:20,820
you think like is it good - is it good
to trust a robot what is over trust mean

2988
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:20,830
to trust a robot what is over trust mean
 

2989
01:06:20,830 --> 01:06:23,560
to trust a robot what is over trust mean
what is it it's good to kind of how you

2990
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:23,570
what is it it's good to kind of how you
 

2991
01:06:23,570 --> 01:06:25,540
what is it it's good to kind of how you
feel about autopilot currently which is

2992
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:25,550
feel about autopilot currently which is
 

2993
01:06:25,550 --> 01:06:28,359
feel about autopilot currently which is
like for a roboticist perspective is

2994
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:28,369
like for a roboticist perspective is
 

2995
01:06:28,369 --> 01:06:32,830
like for a roboticist perspective is
like is so very cautious yeah so this is

2996
01:06:32,830 --> 01:06:32,840
like is so very cautious yeah so this is
 

2997
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:34,700
like is so very cautious yeah so this is
still an open area of research

2998
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:34,710
still an open area of research
 

2999
01:06:34,710 --> 01:06:39,380
still an open area of research
but basically what I would like in a

3000
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:39,390
but basically what I would like in a
 

3001
01:06:39,390 --> 01:06:42,440
but basically what I would like in a
perfect world is that people trust the

3002
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:42,450
perfect world is that people trust the
 

3003
01:06:42,450 --> 01:06:44,090
perfect world is that people trust the
technology when is working a hundred

3004
01:06:44,090 --> 01:06:44,100
technology when is working a hundred
 

3005
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:45,860
technology when is working a hundred
percent and people will be

3006
01:06:45,860 --> 01:06:45,870
percent and people will be
 

3007
01:06:45,870 --> 01:06:48,440
percent and people will be
hypersensitive and identify when it's

3008
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:48,450
hypersensitive and identify when it's
 

3009
01:06:48,450 --> 01:06:51,110
hypersensitive and identify when it's
not but of course we're not there that's

3010
01:06:51,110 --> 01:06:51,120
not but of course we're not there that's
 

3011
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:54,680
not but of course we're not there that's
that's the ideal world and but we find

3012
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:54,690
that's the ideal world and but we find
 

3013
01:06:54,690 --> 01:06:57,200
that's the ideal world and but we find
is that people swing right they tend to

3014
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:57,210
is that people swing right they tend to
 

3015
01:06:57,210 --> 01:07:01,340
is that people swing right they tend to
swing which means that if my first and

3016
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:01,350
swing which means that if my first and
 

3017
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:03,260
swing which means that if my first and
like we have some papers like first

3018
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:03,270
like we have some papers like first
 

3019
01:07:03,270 --> 01:07:04,760
like we have some papers like first
impressions in everything is everything

3020
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:04,770
impressions in everything is everything
 

3021
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:07,160
impressions in everything is everything
right if my first instance with

3022
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:07,170
right if my first instance with
 

3023
01:07:07,170 --> 01:07:10,780
right if my first instance with
technology with robotics is positive it

3024
01:07:10,780 --> 01:07:10,790
technology with robotics is positive it
 

3025
01:07:10,790 --> 01:07:14,420
technology with robotics is positive it
mitigates any risk in it correlates with

3026
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:14,430
mitigates any risk in it correlates with
 

3027
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:17,990
mitigates any risk in it correlates with
like best outcomes it means that I'm

3028
01:07:17,990 --> 01:07:18,000
like best outcomes it means that I'm
 

3029
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,830
like best outcomes it means that I'm
more likely to either not see it when it

3030
01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:21,840
more likely to either not see it when it
 

3031
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:25,100
more likely to either not see it when it
makes a mistakes or faults or I'm more

3032
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:25,110
makes a mistakes or faults or I'm more
 

3033
01:07:25,110 --> 01:07:30,050
makes a mistakes or faults or I'm more
likely to forgive it and so this is a

3034
01:07:30,050 --> 01:07:30,060
likely to forgive it and so this is a
 

3035
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:31,520
likely to forgive it and so this is a
problem because technology is not 100

3036
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:31,530
problem because technology is not 100
 

3037
01:07:31,530 --> 01:07:33,080
problem because technology is not 100
percent accurate right it's not as if

3038
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:33,090
percent accurate right it's not as if
 

3039
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:34,160
percent accurate right it's not as if
it's inaccurate although it may be

3040
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:34,170
it's inaccurate although it may be
 

3041
01:07:34,170 --> 01:07:36,530
it's inaccurate although it may be
perfect how do you get that first moment

3042
01:07:36,530 --> 01:07:36,540
perfect how do you get that first moment
 

3043
01:07:36,540 --> 01:07:38,240
perfect how do you get that first moment
right do you think there's also an

3044
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:38,250
right do you think there's also an
 

3045
01:07:38,250 --> 01:07:40,670
right do you think there's also an
education about the capabilities and

3046
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:40,680
education about the capabilities and
 

3047
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:42,740
education about the capabilities and
limitations of the system do you have a

3048
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:42,750
limitations of the system do you have a
 

3049
01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:44,960
limitations of the system do you have a
sense of how do you educate people

3050
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:44,970
sense of how do you educate people
 

3051
01:07:44,970 --> 01:07:46,640
sense of how do you educate people
correctly in that first interaction

3052
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:46,650
correctly in that first interaction
 

3053
01:07:46,650 --> 01:07:49,100
correctly in that first interaction
again this is this is an open-ended

3054
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:49,110
again this is this is an open-ended
 

3055
01:07:49,110 --> 01:07:51,830
again this is this is an open-ended
problem so one of the study that

3056
01:07:51,830 --> 01:07:51,840
problem so one of the study that
 

3057
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:55,190
problem so one of the study that
actually has given me some hope that I

3058
01:07:55,190 --> 01:07:55,200
actually has given me some hope that I
 

3059
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,170
actually has given me some hope that I
were trying to figure out how to put in

3060
01:07:57,170 --> 01:07:57,180
were trying to figure out how to put in
 

3061
01:07:57,180 --> 01:08:01,100
were trying to figure out how to put in
robotics so there was a research study

3062
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:01,110
robotics so there was a research study
 

3063
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:03,320
robotics so there was a research study
that had showed for medical AI systems

3064
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:03,330
that had showed for medical AI systems
 

3065
01:08:03,330 --> 01:08:07,250
that had showed for medical AI systems
giving information to radiologists about

3066
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:07,260
giving information to radiologists about
 

3067
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:09,020
giving information to radiologists about
you know here you need to look at these

3068
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:09,030
you know here you need to look at these
 

3069
01:08:09,030 --> 01:08:15,350
you know here you need to look at these
areas on the x-ray what they found was

3070
01:08:15,350 --> 01:08:15,360
areas on the x-ray what they found was
 

3071
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:19,900
areas on the x-ray what they found was
that when the system provided one choice

3072
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:19,910
that when the system provided one choice
 

3073
01:08:19,910 --> 01:08:25,160
that when the system provided one choice
there was this aspect of either no trust

3074
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:25,170
there was this aspect of either no trust
 

3075
01:08:25,170 --> 01:08:28,190
there was this aspect of either no trust
or over trust right like I'm not going I

3076
01:08:28,190 --> 01:08:28,200
or over trust right like I'm not going I
 

3077
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:33,140
or over trust right like I'm not going I
don't believe it at all or a yes yes yes

3078
01:08:33,140 --> 01:08:33,150
don't believe it at all or a yes yes yes
 

3079
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:35,860
don't believe it at all or a yes yes yes
yes and they was miss things right

3080
01:08:35,860 --> 01:08:35,870
yes and they was miss things right
 

3081
01:08:35,870 --> 01:08:39,170
yes and they was miss things right
instead when the system gave them

3082
01:08:39,170 --> 01:08:39,180
instead when the system gave them
 

3083
01:08:39,180 --> 01:08:41,840
instead when the system gave them
multiple choices like here are the three

3084
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:41,850
multiple choices like here are the three
 

3085
01:08:41,850 --> 01:08:43,550
multiple choices like here are the three
even if it knew like you know it had

3086
01:08:43,550 --> 01:08:43,560
even if it knew like you know it had
 

3087
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:45,560
even if it knew like you know it had
estimated that the top area you need to

3088
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:45,570
estimated that the top area you need to
 

3089
01:08:45,570 --> 01:08:48,079
estimated that the top area you need to
look at was he you know someplace

3090
01:08:48,079 --> 01:08:48,089
look at was he you know someplace
 

3091
01:08:48,089 --> 01:08:52,090
look at was he you know someplace
on the x-ray if it gave like one plus

3092
01:08:52,090 --> 01:08:52,100
on the x-ray if it gave like one plus
 

3093
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:58,280
on the x-ray if it gave like one plus
others the trust was maintained and the

3094
01:08:58,280 --> 01:08:58,290
others the trust was maintained and the
 

3095
01:08:58,290 --> 01:09:01,059
others the trust was maintained and the
accuracy of the entire population

3096
01:09:01,059 --> 01:09:01,069
accuracy of the entire population
 

3097
01:09:01,069 --> 01:09:05,300
accuracy of the entire population
increased right so basically it was a

3098
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:05,310
increased right so basically it was a
 

3099
01:09:05,310 --> 01:09:07,640
increased right so basically it was a
you're still trusting the system but

3100
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:07,650
you're still trusting the system but
 

3101
01:09:07,650 --> 01:09:09,200
you're still trusting the system but
you're also putting in a little bit of

3102
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:09,210
you're also putting in a little bit of
 

3103
01:09:09,210 --> 01:09:11,960
you're also putting in a little bit of
like your human expertise like you're a

3104
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:11,970
like your human expertise like you're a
 

3105
01:09:11,970 --> 01:09:14,570
like your human expertise like you're a
human decision processing into the

3106
01:09:14,570 --> 01:09:14,580
human decision processing into the
 

3107
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:16,760
human decision processing into the
equation so it helps to mitigate that

3108
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:16,770
equation so it helps to mitigate that
 

3109
01:09:16,770 --> 01:09:19,220
equation so it helps to mitigate that
over trust risk yeah so there's a

3110
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:19,230
over trust risk yeah so there's a
 

3111
01:09:19,230 --> 01:09:20,960
over trust risk yeah so there's a
fascinating balance tough to strike I

3112
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:20,970
fascinating balance tough to strike I
 

3113
01:09:20,970 --> 01:09:24,860
fascinating balance tough to strike I
haven't figured out again exciting open

01:09:24,870 --> 01:09:27,410
haven't figured out again exciting open
area research exactly so what are some

3116
01:09:27,410 --> 01:09:27,420
area research exactly so what are some
 

3117
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:29,660
area research exactly so what are some
exciting applications of human robot

3118
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:29,670
exciting applications of human robot
 

3119
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:31,309
exciting applications of human robot
interaction you started a company maybe

3120
01:09:31,309 --> 01:09:31,319
interaction you started a company maybe
 

3121
01:09:31,319 --> 01:09:35,000
interaction you started a company maybe
you can talk about the the exciting

3122
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:35,010
you can talk about the the exciting
 

3123
01:09:35,010 --> 01:09:36,860
you can talk about the the exciting
efforts there but in general also what

3124
01:09:36,860 --> 01:09:36,870
efforts there but in general also what
 

3125
01:09:36,870 --> 01:09:39,650
efforts there but in general also what
other space can robots interact with

3126
01:09:39,650 --> 01:09:39,660
other space can robots interact with
 

3127
01:09:39,660 --> 01:09:41,840
other space can robots interact with
humans and help yeah so besides

3128
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:41,850
humans and help yeah so besides
 

3129
01:09:41,850 --> 01:09:43,340
humans and help yeah so besides
healthcare cuz you know that's my bias

3130
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:43,350
healthcare cuz you know that's my bias
 

3131
01:09:43,350 --> 01:09:46,660
healthcare cuz you know that's my bias
lens my other bias lens is education I

3132
01:09:46,660 --> 01:09:46,670
lens my other bias lens is education I

think that well one we definitely we in

3134
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:52,050
think that well one we definitely we in
 

3135
01:09:52,050 --> 01:09:54,050
think that well one we definitely we in
the u.s. you know we're doing okay with

3136
01:09:54,050 --> 01:09:54,060
the u.s. you know we're doing okay with
 

3137
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:56,390
the u.s. you know we're doing okay with
teachers but there's a lot of school

3138
01:09:56,390 --> 01:09:56,400
teachers but there's a lot of school
 

3139
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:57,620
teachers but there's a lot of school
districts that don't have enough

3140
01:09:57,620 --> 01:09:57,630
districts that don't have enough
 

3141
01:09:57,630 --> 01:09:59,560
districts that don't have enough
teachers if you think about the

3142
01:09:59,560 --> 01:09:59,570
teachers if you think about the
 

3143
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:03,020
teachers if you think about the
teacher-student ratio for at least

3144
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:03,030
teacher-student ratio for at least
 

3145
01:10:03,030 --> 01:10:05,780
teacher-student ratio for at least
public education um in some districts

3146
01:10:05,780 --> 01:10:05,790
public education um in some districts
 

3147
01:10:05,790 --> 01:10:08,060
public education um in some districts
it's crazy it's like how can you have

3148
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:08,070
it's crazy it's like how can you have
 

3149
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:10,520
it's crazy it's like how can you have
learning in that classroom right because

3150
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:10,530
learning in that classroom right because
 

3151
01:10:10,530 --> 01:10:12,440
learning in that classroom right because
you just don't have the human capital

3152
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:12,450
you just don't have the human capital
 

3153
01:10:12,450 --> 01:10:14,920
you just don't have the human capital
and so if you think about robotics

3154
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:14,930
and so if you think about robotics
 

3155
01:10:14,930 --> 01:10:18,710
and so if you think about robotics
bringing that in to classrooms as well

3156
01:10:18,710 --> 01:10:18,720
bringing that in to classrooms as well
 

3157
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:20,870
bringing that in to classrooms as well
as the after-school space where they

3158
01:10:20,870 --> 01:10:20,880
as the after-school space where they
 

3159
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:24,590
as the after-school space where they
offset some of this lack of resources

3160
01:10:24,590 --> 01:10:24,600
offset some of this lack of resources
 

3161
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:27,590
offset some of this lack of resources
and certain communities I think that's a

3162
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:27,600
and certain communities I think that's a
 

3163
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:30,080
and certain communities I think that's a
good place and then turning on the other

3164
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:30,090
good place and then turning on the other
 

3165
01:10:30,090 --> 01:10:33,250
good place and then turning on the other
end is using the system's then for

3166
01:10:33,250 --> 01:10:33,260
end is using the system's then for
 

3167
01:10:33,260 --> 01:10:37,820
end is using the system's then for
workforce retraining and dealing with

3168
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:37,830
workforce retraining and dealing with
 

3169
01:10:37,830 --> 01:10:39,680
workforce retraining and dealing with
some of the things that are going to

3170
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:39,690
some of the things that are going to
 

3171
01:10:39,690 --> 01:10:43,190
some of the things that are going to
come out later on of job loss like

3172
01:10:43,190 --> 01:10:43,200
come out later on of job loss like
 

3173
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:45,800
come out later on of job loss like
thinking about robots and Nai systems

3174
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:45,810
thinking about robots and Nai systems
 

3175
01:10:45,810 --> 01:10:47,420
thinking about robots and Nai systems
for retraining and Workforce Development

3176
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:47,430
for retraining and Workforce Development
 

3177
01:10:47,430 --> 01:10:50,090
for retraining and Workforce Development
I think that's exciting

3178
01:10:50,090 --> 01:10:50,100
I think that's exciting
 

3179
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:53,300
I think that's exciting
areas that can be pushed even more and

3180
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:53,310
areas that can be pushed even more and
 

3181
01:10:53,310 --> 01:10:56,930
areas that can be pushed even more and
it would have a huge huge impact what

3182
01:10:56,930 --> 01:10:56,940
it would have a huge huge impact what
 

3183
01:10:56,940 --> 01:10:58,700
it would have a huge huge impact what
would you say some of the open problems

3184
01:10:58,700 --> 01:10:58,710
would you say some of the open problems
 

3185
01:10:58,710 --> 01:11:01,520
would you say some of the open problems
were in education so

3186
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:01,530
were in education so
 

3187
01:11:01,530 --> 01:11:07,210
were in education so
it's a exciting so young kids and the

3188
01:11:07,210 --> 01:11:07,220
it's a exciting so young kids and the
 

3189
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:09,620
it's a exciting so young kids and the
older folks or just folks of all ages

3190
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:09,630
older folks or just folks of all ages
 

3191
01:11:09,630 --> 01:11:13,280
older folks or just folks of all ages
who need to be retrained we need to sort

3192
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:13,290
who need to be retrained we need to sort
 

3193
01:11:13,290 --> 01:11:15,280
who need to be retrained we need to sort
of open themselves up to a whole nother

3194
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:15,290
of open themselves up to a whole nother
 

3195
01:11:15,290 --> 01:11:18,950
of open themselves up to a whole nother
area of work what what are the problems

3196
01:11:18,950 --> 01:11:18,960
area of work what what are the problems
 

3197
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:20,510
area of work what what are the problems
to be solved there how do you think

3198
01:11:20,510 --> 01:11:20,520
to be solved there how do you think
 

3199
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:23,330
to be solved there how do you think
robots can help we we have the

3200
01:11:23,330 --> 01:11:23,340
robots can help we we have the
 

3201
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:25,610
robots can help we we have the
engagement aspect right so we can figure

3202
01:11:25,610 --> 01:11:25,620
engagement aspect right so we can figure
 

3203
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:27,260
engagement aspect right so we can figure
out the engagement that's not a what do

3204
01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:27,270
out the engagement that's not a what do
 

3205
01:11:27,270 --> 01:11:30,050
out the engagement that's not a what do
you mean by engagement so identifying

3206
01:11:30,050 --> 01:11:30,060
you mean by engagement so identifying
 

3207
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:36,920
you mean by engagement so identifying
whether a person is focused is like that

3208
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:36,930
whether a person is focused is like that
 

3209
01:11:36,930 --> 01:11:39,830
whether a person is focused is like that
we can figure out what we can figure out

3210
01:11:39,830 --> 01:11:39,840
we can figure out what we can figure out
 

3211
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:43,910
we can figure out what we can figure out
and and there's some positive results in

3212
01:11:43,910 --> 01:11:43,920
and and there's some positive results in
 

3213
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:46,670
and and there's some positive results in
this is that personalized adaptation

3214
01:11:46,670 --> 01:11:46,680
this is that personalized adaptation
 

3215
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:50,270
this is that personalized adaptation
based on any con sense right so imagine

3216
01:11:50,270 --> 01:11:50,280
based on any con sense right so imagine
 

3217
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:55,160
based on any con sense right so imagine
I think about I have an agent and I'm

3218
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:55,170
I think about I have an agent and I'm
 

3219
01:11:55,170 --> 01:11:59,540
I think about I have an agent and I'm
working with a kid learning I don't know

3220
01:11:59,540 --> 01:11:59,550
working with a kid learning I don't know
 

3221
01:11:59,550 --> 01:12:03,590

algebra - in that same agent then switch

3222
01:12:03,590 --> 01:12:03,600
algebra - in that same agent then switch
 

3223
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:07,610
algebra - in that same agent then switch
and teach some type of new coding skill

3224
01:12:07,610 --> 01:12:07,620
and teach some type of new coding skill
 

3225
01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:12,500
and teach some type of new coding skill
to a displacement Anik like what does

3226
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:12,510
to a displacement Anik like what does
 

3227
01:12:12,510 --> 01:12:15,010
to a displacement Anik like what does
that actually look like right like

3228
01:12:15,010 --> 01:12:15,020
that actually look like right like
 

3229
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:18,260
that actually look like right like
hardware might be the same content is

3230
01:12:18,260 --> 01:12:18,270
hardware might be the same content is
 

3231
01:12:18,270 --> 01:12:20,450
hardware might be the same content is
different to different target

3232
01:12:20,450 --> 01:12:20,460
different to different target
 

3233
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:23,060
different to different target
demographics of engagement like how do

3234
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:23,070
demographics of engagement like how do
 

3235
01:12:23,070 --> 01:12:25,310
demographics of engagement like how do
you do that how important do you think

3236
01:12:25,310 --> 01:12:25,320
you do that how important do you think
 

3237
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:27,860
you do that how important do you think
personalization is in human robot

3238
01:12:27,860 --> 01:12:27,870
personalization is in human robot
 

3239
01:12:27,870 --> 01:12:31,520
personalization is in human robot
interaction and not just mechanic or

3240
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:31,530
interaction and not just mechanic or
 

3241
01:12:31,530 --> 01:12:32,990
interaction and not just mechanic or
student but like literally to the

3242
01:12:32,990 --> 01:12:33,000
student but like literally to the
 

3243
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,730
student but like literally to the
individual human being

3244
01:12:34,730 --> 01:12:34,740
individual human being
 

3245
01:12:34,740 --> 01:12:36,950
individual human being
I think personalization is really

3246
01:12:36,950 --> 01:12:36,960
I think personalization is really
 

3247
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:41,030
I think personalization is really
important but a caveat is that I think

3248
01:12:41,030 --> 01:12:41,040
important but a caveat is that I think
 

3249
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,520
important but a caveat is that I think
we'd be ok if we can personalize to the

3250
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:43,530
we'd be ok if we can personalize to the
 

3251
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:50,140
we'd be ok if we can personalize to the
group right and so if I can label you as

3252
01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:50,150
group right and so if I can label you as
 

3253
01:12:50,150 --> 01:12:54,050
group right and so if I can label you as
along some certain dimensions then even

3254
01:12:54,050 --> 01:12:54,060
along some certain dimensions then even
 

3255
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:56,120
along some certain dimensions then even
though it may not be you specifically I

3256
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:56,130
though it may not be you specifically I
 

3257
01:12:56,130 --> 01:12:59,000
though it may not be you specifically I
can put you in this group so the sample

3258
01:12:59,000 --> 01:12:59,010
can put you in this group so the sample
 

3259
01:12:59,010 --> 01:13:00,680
can put you in this group so the sample
size this is how they best learn this is

3260
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:00,690
size this is how they best learn this is
 

3261
01:13:00,690 --> 01:13:03,950
size this is how they best learn this is
how they best engage even at that level

3262
01:13:03,950 --> 01:13:03,960
how they best engage even at that level
 

3263
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:08,180
how they best engage even at that level
it's really important and it's because I

3264
01:13:08,180 --> 01:13:08,190
it's really important and it's because I
 

3265
01:13:08,190 --> 01:13:09,940
it's really important and it's because I
mean it's one of the reasons why

3266
01:13:09,940 --> 01:13:09,950
mean it's one of the reasons why
 

3267
01:13:09,950 --> 01:13:12,650
mean it's one of the reasons why
educating in large classrooms is so hard

3268
01:13:12,650 --> 01:13:12,660
educating in large classrooms is so hard
 

3269
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:14,490
educating in large classrooms is so hard
right you teach too

3270
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:14,500
right you teach too
 

3271
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:16,860
right you teach too
you know the median but there's these

3272
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:16,870
you know the median but there's these
 

3273
01:13:16,870 --> 01:13:19,140
you know the median but there's these
you know individuals that are you know

3274
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:19,150
you know individuals that are you know
 

3275
01:13:19,150 --> 01:13:20,730
you know individuals that are you know
struggling and then you have highly

3276
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:20,740
struggling and then you have highly
 

3277
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:22,800
struggling and then you have highly
intelligent individuals and those are

3278
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:22,810
intelligent individuals and those are
 

3279
01:13:22,810 --> 01:13:25,560
intelligent individuals and those are
the ones that are usually you know kind

3280
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:25,570
the ones that are usually you know kind
 

3281
01:13:25,570 --> 01:13:27,090
the ones that are usually you know kind
of left out so highly intelligent

3282
01:13:27,090 --> 01:13:27,100
of left out so highly intelligent
 

3283
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:29,190
of left out so highly intelligent
individuals may be disruptive and those

3284
01:13:29,190 --> 01:13:29,200
individuals may be disruptive and those
 

3285
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:30,270
individuals may be disruptive and those
who are struggling might be you

3286
01:13:30,270 --> 01:13:30,280
who are struggling might be you
 

3287
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:32,460
who are struggling might be you
disruptive because they're both bored

3288
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:32,470
disruptive because they're both bored
 

3289
01:13:32,470 --> 01:13:34,260
disruptive because they're both bored
yeah and if you narrow this the

3290
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:34,270
yeah and if you narrow this the
 

3291
01:13:34,270 --> 01:13:36,030
yeah and if you narrow this the
definition of the group or in the size

3292
01:13:36,030 --> 01:13:36,040
definition of the group or in the size
 

3293
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:38,460
definition of the group or in the size
of the group enough you'll be able to

3294
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:38,470
of the group enough you'll be able to
 

3295
01:13:38,470 --> 01:13:40,620
of the group enough you'll be able to
address their individual yeah it's not

3296
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:40,630
address their individual yeah it's not
 

3297
01:13:40,630 --> 01:13:42,960
address their individual yeah it's not
individual needs but really gross needs

3298
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:42,970
individual needs but really gross needs
 

3299
01:13:42,970 --> 01:13:45,360
individual needs but really gross needs
a group most important group needs right

3300
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:45,370
a group most important group needs right
 

3301
01:13:45,370 --> 01:13:47,340
a group most important group needs right
right and that's kind of what a lot of

3302
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:47,350
right and that's kind of what a lot of
 

3303
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:48,900
right and that's kind of what a lot of
successful recommender systems do is

3304
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:48,910
successful recommender systems do is
 

3305
01:13:48,910 --> 01:13:52,050
successful recommender systems do is
Spotify and so on say sad to believe but

3306
01:13:52,050 --> 01:13:52,060
Spotify and so on say sad to believe but
 

3307
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:54,540
Spotify and so on say sad to believe but
I'm as a music listener probably in some

3308
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:54,550
I'm as a music listener probably in some
 

3309
01:13:54,550 --> 01:13:57,510
I'm as a music listener probably in some
sort of large group it's very sadly

3310
01:13:57,510 --> 01:13:57,520
sort of large group it's very sadly
 

3311
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:59,610
sort of large group it's very sadly
predictable been labeled yeah I've been

3312
01:13:59,610 --> 01:13:59,620
predictable been labeled yeah I've been
 

3313
01:13:59,620 --> 01:14:02,340
predictable been labeled yeah I've been
labeled and and successfully so because

3314
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:02,350
labeled and and successfully so because
 

3315
01:14:02,350 --> 01:14:04,290
labeled and and successfully so because
they're able to recommend stuff that I

3316
01:14:04,290 --> 01:14:04,300
they're able to recommend stuff that I
 

3317
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:06,660
they're able to recommend stuff that I
yeah but applying that to education

3318
01:14:06,660 --> 01:14:06,670
yeah but applying that to education
 

3319
01:14:06,670 --> 01:14:08,940
yeah but applying that to education
right there's no reason why it can't be

3320
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:08,950
right there's no reason why it can't be
 

3321
01:14:08,950 --> 01:14:11,130
right there's no reason why it can't be
done do you have a hope for our

3322
01:14:11,130 --> 01:14:11,140
done do you have a hope for our
 

3323
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:14,310
done do you have a hope for our
education system I have more hope for

3324
01:14:14,310 --> 01:14:14,320
education system I have more hope for
 

3325
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:17,250
education system I have more hope for
workforce development and that's because

3326
01:14:17,250 --> 01:14:17,260
workforce development and that's because
 

3327
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:20,370
workforce development and that's because
I'm seeing investments even if you look

3328
01:14:20,370 --> 01:14:20,380
I'm seeing investments even if you look
 

3329
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:23,550
I'm seeing investments even if you look
at VC investments in education the

3330
01:14:23,550 --> 01:14:23,560
at VC investments in education the
 

3331
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:26,340
at VC investments in education the
majority of it has lately been going to

3332
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:26,350
majority of it has lately been going to
 

3333
01:14:26,350 --> 01:14:29,160
majority of it has lately been going to
workforce retraining right and so I

3334
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:29,170
workforce retraining right and so I
 

3335
01:14:29,170 --> 01:14:32,130
workforce retraining right and so I
think that government investments is

3336
01:14:32,130 --> 01:14:32,140
think that government investments is
 

3337
01:14:32,140 --> 01:14:34,560
think that government investments is
increasing there's like a claim and some

3338
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:34,570
increasing there's like a claim and some
 

3339
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:36,480
increasing there's like a claim and some
of it's based on fear right like AI is

3340
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:36,490
of it's based on fear right like AI is
 

3341
01:14:36,490 --> 01:14:37,830
of it's based on fear right like AI is
gonna come and take over all these jobs

3342
01:14:37,830 --> 01:14:37,840
gonna come and take over all these jobs
 

3343
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,030
gonna come and take over all these jobs
so what are we gonna do with all these

3344
01:14:39,030 --> 01:14:39,040
so what are we gonna do with all these
 

3345
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:42,240
so what are we gonna do with all these
non paying taxes that aren't coming to

3346
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:42,250
non paying taxes that aren't coming to
 

3347
01:14:42,250 --> 01:14:45,870
non paying taxes that aren't coming to
us by our citizens and so I think I'm

3348
01:14:45,870 --> 01:14:45,880
us by our citizens and so I think I'm
 

3349
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:49,610
us by our citizens and so I think I'm
more hopeful for that not so hopeful for

3350
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:49,620
more hopeful for that not so hopeful for
 

3351
01:14:49,620 --> 01:14:54,480
more hopeful for that not so hopeful for
early education because it's this it's

3352
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:54,490
early education because it's this it's
 

3353
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:57,270
early education because it's this it's
still a who's gonna pay for it and you

3354
01:14:57,270 --> 01:14:57,280
still a who's gonna pay for it and you
 

3355
01:14:57,280 --> 01:15:02,040
still a who's gonna pay for it and you
won't see the results for like 16 to 18

3356
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:02,050
won't see the results for like 16 to 18
 

3357
01:15:02,050 --> 01:15:04,680
won't see the results for like 16 to 18
years it's hard for people to wrap their

3358
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:04,690
years it's hard for people to wrap their
 

3359
01:15:04,690 --> 01:15:08,490
years it's hard for people to wrap their
heads around that but on the retraining

3360
01:15:08,490 --> 01:15:08,500
heads around that but on the retraining
 

3361
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:10,830
heads around that but on the retraining
part what are your thoughts there's a

3362
01:15:10,830 --> 01:15:10,840
part what are your thoughts there's a
 

3363
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:13,170
part what are your thoughts there's a

candidate andrew yang running for
 

3365
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:17,400
candidate andrew yang running for

01:15:17,410 --> 01:15:20,400
president and saying that sort of AI
automation robots universal basic income

3368
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:20,410
automation robots universal basic income
 

3369
01:15:20,410 --> 01:15:22,530
automation robots universal basic income
universal basic income in order to

3370
01:15:22,530 --> 01:15:22,540
universal basic income in order to
 

3371
01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:25,170
universal basic income in order to
support us as we kind of automation

3372
01:15:25,170 --> 01:15:25,180
support us as we kind of automation
 

3373
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:27,590
support us as we kind of automation
takes people's jobs and

3374
01:15:27,590 --> 01:15:27,600
takes people's jobs and
 

3375
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,440
takes people's jobs and
to explore and find other means like you

3376
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:30,450
to explore and find other means like you
 

3377
01:15:30,450 --> 01:15:36,380
to explore and find other means like you
have a concern of society transforming

3378
01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:36,390
have a concern of society transforming
 

3379
01:15:36,390 --> 01:15:39,590
have a concern of society transforming
effects of automation and robots and so

3380
01:15:39,590 --> 01:15:39,600
effects of automation and robots and so
 

3381
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:44,390
effects of automation and robots and so
on I do I do know that AI robotics will

3382
01:15:44,390 --> 01:15:44,400
on I do I do know that AI robotics will
 

3383
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:47,080
on I do I do know that AI robotics will
displace workers like we do know that

3384
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:47,090
displace workers like we do know that
 

3385
01:15:47,090 --> 01:15:50,540
displace workers like we do know that
but there'll be other workers that will

3386
01:15:50,540 --> 01:15:50,550
but there'll be other workers that will
 

3387
01:15:50,550 --> 01:15:55,610
but there'll be other workers that will
be defined new jobs what I worry about

3388
01:15:55,610 --> 01:15:55,620
be defined new jobs what I worry about
 

3389
01:15:55,620 --> 01:15:57,560
be defined new jobs what I worry about
is that's not what I worry about like

3390
01:15:57,560 --> 01:15:57,570
is that's not what I worry about like
 

3391
01:15:57,570 --> 01:15:59,900
is that's not what I worry about like
we'll all the jobs go away what I worry

3392
01:15:59,900 --> 01:15:59,910
we'll all the jobs go away what I worry
 

3393
01:15:59,910 --> 01:16:01,550
we'll all the jobs go away what I worry
about is the type of jobs that will come

3394
01:16:01,550 --> 01:16:01,560
about is the type of jobs that will come
 

3395
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:03,920
about is the type of jobs that will come
out right like people who graduate from

3396
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:03,930
out right like people who graduate from
 

3397
01:16:03,930 --> 01:16:06,770
out right like people who graduate from
Georgia Tech will be okay right we give

3398
01:16:06,770 --> 01:16:06,780
Georgia Tech will be okay right we give
 

3399
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:08,900
Georgia Tech will be okay right we give
them the skills they will adopt even if

01:16:11,510 --> 01:16:11,520
their current job goes away I do worry
 

3403
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:14,150
their current job goes away I do worry
about those that don't have that quality

3404
01:16:14,150 --> 01:16:14,160
about those that don't have that quality
 

3405
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:17,090
about those that don't have that quality
of an education right will they have the

3406
01:16:17,090 --> 01:16:17,100
of an education right will they have the
 

3407
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:20,360
of an education right will they have the
ability the background to adapt to those

3408
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:20,370
ability the background to adapt to those
 

3409
01:16:20,370 --> 01:16:23,480
ability the background to adapt to those
new jobs that I don't know that I worry

3410
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:23,490
new jobs that I don't know that I worry
 

3411
01:16:23,490 --> 01:16:26,090
new jobs that I don't know that I worry
about which will convey even more

3412
01:16:26,090 --> 01:16:26,100
about which will convey even more
 

3413
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:29,260
about which will convey even more
polarization in in our society

3414
01:16:29,260 --> 01:16:29,270
polarization in in our society
 

3415
01:16:29,270 --> 01:16:31,580
polarization in in our society
internationally and everywhere I worry

equal access to all these wonderful
 

3421
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:40,280
equal access to all these wonderful
things that AI can do and robotics can

3422
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:40,290
things that AI can do and robotics can
 

3423
01:16:40,290 --> 01:16:43,790
things that AI can do and robotics can
do I worry about that you know people

3424
01:16:43,790 --> 01:16:43,800
do I worry about that you know people
 

3425
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:47,060
do I worry about that you know people
like people like me from Georgia Tech

3426
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:47,070
like people like me from Georgia Tech
 

3427
01:16:47,070 --> 01:16:50,450
like people like me from Georgia Tech
from say MIT will be okay right but

3428
01:16:50,450 --> 01:16:50,460
from say MIT will be okay right but
 

3429
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:52,010
from say MIT will be okay right but
that's such a small part of the

3430
01:16:52,010 --> 01:16:52,020
that's such a small part of the
 

3431
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:55,010
that's such a small part of the
population that we need to think much

3432
01:16:55,010 --> 01:16:55,020
population that we need to think much
 

3433
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:57,590
population that we need to think much
more globally of having access to the

3434
01:16:57,590 --> 01:16:57,600
more globally of having access to the
 

3435
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:59,300
more globally of having access to the
beautiful things whether it's AI and

3436
01:16:59,300 --> 01:16:59,310
beautiful things whether it's AI and
 

3437
01:16:59,310 --> 01:17:02,530
beautiful things whether it's AI and
healthcare AI and education may ion and

3438
01:17:02,530 --> 01:17:02,540
healthcare AI and education may ion and
 

3439
01:17:02,540 --> 01:17:06,290
healthcare AI and education may ion and
politics right I worry about and that's

3440
01:17:06,290 --> 01:17:06,300
politics right I worry about and that's
 

3441

politics right I worry about and that's
part of the thing that you were talking

3442
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:07,890
part of the thing that you were talking
 

3443
01:17:07,890 --> 01:17:09,260
part of the thing that you were talking
about is people that build a technology

3444
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:09,270
about is people that build a technology
 

3445
01:17:09,270 --> 01:17:12,650
about is people that build a technology
had to be thinking about ethics have to

01:17:12,650 --> 01:17:12,660
had to be thinking about ethics have to
 

3447
01:17:12,660 --> 01:17:14,600
had to be thinking about ethics have to
be thinking about access yeah and all

3448
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:14,610
be thinking about access yeah and all
 

3449
01:17:14,610 --> 01:17:16,220
be thinking about access yeah and all
those things and not not just a small

3450
01:17:16,220 --> 01:17:16,230
those things and not not just a small
 

3451
01:17:16,230 --> 01:17:18,440
those things and not not just a small
small subset let me ask some

3452
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:18,450
small subset let me ask some
 

3453
01:17:18,450 --> 01:17:21,050
small subset let me ask some
philosophical slightly romantic

3454
01:17:21,050 --> 01:17:21,060
philosophical slightly romantic
 

3455
01:17:21,060 --> 01:17:23,240
philosophical slightly romantic
questions all right but they listen to

3456
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:23,250
questions all right but they listen to
 

3457
01:17:23,250 --> 01:17:26,090
questions all right but they listen to
this will be like here he goes again

3458
01:17:26,090 --> 01:17:26,100
this will be like here he goes again
 

3459
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:29,710
this will be like here he goes again
okay do you think do you think one day

okay do you think do you think one day
 

3461
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:33,460
okay do you think do you think one day
we'll build an AI system that we a

3462
01:17:33,460 --> 01:17:33,470
we'll build an AI system that we a
 

3463
01:17:33,470 --> 01:17:36,230
we'll build an AI system that we a
person can fall in love with and it

3464
01:17:36,230 --> 01:17:36,240
person can fall in love with and it

would love them back like in a movie her
 

3467
01:17:38,970 --> 01:17:39,770
would love them back like in a movie her
for exam

3468
01:17:39,770 --> 01:17:39,780
for exam
 

3469
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:42,200
for exam
yeah although she she kind of didn't

3470
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:42,210

something like that
so you're the jealous type I see we

3478
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:50,010
so you're the jealous type I see we
 

3479
01:17:50,010 --> 01:17:52,880
so you're the jealous type I see we
humans at the judge yes so I do believe

3480
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:52,890
humans at the judge yes so I do believe
 

3481
01:17:52,890 --> 01:17:56,600
humans at the judge yes so I do believe
that we can design systems where people

3482
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:56,610
that we can design systems where people
 

3483
01:17:56,610 --> 01:17:59,630
that we can design systems where people
would fall in love with their robot with

3484
01:17:59,630 --> 01:17:59,640
would fall in love with their robot with
 

3485
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:04,210
would fall in love with their robot with
their AI partner that I do believe

3486
01:18:04,210 --> 01:18:04,220
their AI partner that I do believe
 

3487
01:18:04,220 --> 01:18:06,800
their AI partner that I do believe
because it's actually and I won't I

3488
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:06,810
because it's actually and I won't I
 

3489
01:18:06,810 --> 01:18:08,360
because it's actually and I won't I
don't like to use the word manipulate

3490
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:08,370
don't like to use the word manipulate
 

3491
01:18:08,370 --> 01:18:11,600
don't like to use the word manipulate
but as we see there are certain

3492
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:11,610
but as we see there are certain
 

3493
01:18:11,610 --> 01:18:13,460
but as we see there are certain
individuals that can be manipulated if

3494
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:13,470
individuals that can be manipulated if
 

3495
01:18:13,470 --> 01:18:15,170
individuals that can be manipulated if
you understand the cognitive science

3496
01:18:15,170 --> 01:18:15,180
you understand the cognitive science
 

3497
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:15,710
you understand the cognitive science
about it

3498
01:18:15,710 --> 01:18:15,720
about it
 

3499
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:18,230
about it
right alright so I mean if you could

3500
01:18:18,230 --> 01:18:18,240
right alright so I mean if you could
 

3501
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:20,690
right alright so I mean if you could
think of all close relationship and love

3502
01:18:20,690 --> 01:18:20,700
think of all close relationship and love
 

3503
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:23,290
think of all close relationship and love
in general as a kind of mutual

3504
01:18:23,290 --> 01:18:23,300
in general as a kind of mutual
 

3505
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:26,390
in general as a kind of mutual
manipulation that dance the human dance

3506
01:18:26,390 --> 01:18:26,400
manipulation that dance the human dance
 

3507
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,370
manipulation that dance the human dance
I mean many patients a negative

3508
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:28,380
I mean many patients a negative
 

3509
01:18:28,380 --> 01:18:31,220
I mean many patients a negative
connotation and I don't like to use that

3510
01:18:31,220 --> 01:18:31,230
connotation and I don't like to use that
 

3511
01:18:31,230 --> 01:18:33,590
connotation and I don't like to use that
word particularly I guess another way to

3512
01:18:33,590 --> 01:18:33,600
word particularly I guess another way to
 

3513
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:35,630
word particularly I guess another way to
phrase is you're getting as it could be

3514
01:18:35,630 --> 01:18:35,640
phrase is you're getting as it could be
 

3515
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:37,640
phrase is you're getting as it could be
algorithmic eyes or something it could

3516
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:37,650
algorithmic eyes or something it could
 

3517
01:18:37,650 --> 01:18:39,830
algorithmic eyes or something it could
be the relationship building part can

3518
01:18:39,830 --> 01:18:39,840
be the relationship building part can
 

3519
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,540
be the relationship building part can
yeah yeah I mean just think about it

3520
01:18:41,540 --> 01:18:41,550
yeah yeah I mean just think about it
 

3521
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:43,910
yeah yeah I mean just think about it
there we have and I don't use dating

3522
01:18:43,910 --> 01:18:43,920
there we have and I don't use dating
 

3523
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:47,870
there we have and I don't use dating
sites but from what I heard there are

3524
01:18:47,870 --> 01:18:47,880
sites but from what I heard there are
 

3525
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:50,270
sites but from what I heard there are
some individuals that have been dating

3526
01:18:50,270 --> 01:18:50,280
some individuals that have been dating
 

3527
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:52,910
some individuals that have been dating
that have never saw each other right in

3528
01:18:52,910 --> 01:18:52,920
that have never saw each other right in
 

3529
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:54,590
that have never saw each other right in
fact there's a show I think that tries

3530
01:18:54,590 --> 01:18:54,600
fact there's a show I think that tries
 

3531
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:57,950
fact there's a show I think that tries
to I weed out fake people like there's a

3532
01:18:57,950 --> 01:18:57,960
to I weed out fake people like there's a
 

3533
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:00,110
to I weed out fake people like there's a
show that comes out right because like

3534
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:00,120
show that comes out right because like
 

3535
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:03,230
show that comes out right because like
people start faking like what's the

3536
01:19:03,230 --> 01:19:03,240
people start faking like what's the
 

3537
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:05,360
people start faking like what's the
difference of that person on the other

3538
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:05,370
difference of that person on the other
 

3539
01:19:05,370 --> 01:19:08,630
difference of that person on the other
end being an AI agent right and having a

3540
01:19:08,630 --> 01:19:08,640
end being an AI agent right and having a
 

3541
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:09,980
end being an AI agent right and having a
communication are you building a

3542
01:19:09,980 --> 01:19:09,990
communication are you building a
 

3543
01:19:09,990 --> 01:19:13,040
communication are you building a
relationship remotely like there there's

3544
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:13,050
relationship remotely like there there's
 

3545
01:19:13,050 --> 01:19:16,160
relationship remotely like there there's
no reason why that can't happen in terms

3546
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:16,170
no reason why that can't happen in terms
 

3547
01:19:16,170 --> 01:19:17,990
no reason why that can't happen in terms
of human robot interaction was a what

3548
01:19:17,990 --> 01:19:18,000
of human robot interaction was a what
 

3549
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,170
of human robot interaction was a what
role you've kind of mentioned what data

3550
01:19:20,170 --> 01:19:20,180
role you've kind of mentioned what data
 

3551
01:19:20,180 --> 01:19:24,170
role you've kind of mentioned what data
emotion being can be problematic if not

human-like things the imperfect things
 

3559
01:19:31,470 --> 01:19:33,620
human-like things the imperfect things
come into play here for a good human

3560
01:19:33,620 --> 01:19:33,630
come into play here for a good human
 

3561
01:19:33,630 --> 01:19:35,870
come into play here for a good human
robot interaction and something like

3562
01:19:35,870 --> 01:19:35,880
robot interaction and something like
 

3563
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:39,200
robot interaction and something like
love yes so in this case and you had

3564
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:39,210
love yes so in this case and you had
 

3565
01:19:39,210 --> 01:19:43,580
love yes so in this case and you had
asked can i AI agent love a human back I

3566
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:43,590
asked can i AI agent love a human back I
 

3567
01:19:43,590 --> 01:19:47,180
asked can i AI agent love a human back I
think they can emulate love back right

3568
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:47,190
think they can emulate love back right
 

3569
01:19:47,190 --> 01:19:49,040
think they can emulate love back right
and so what does that actually mean it

3570
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:49,050
and so what does that actually mean it
 

3571
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:51,110
and so what does that actually mean it
just means that if you think about their

3572
01:19:51,110 --> 01:19:51,120
just means that if you think about their
 

3573
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,000
just means that if you think about their
programming they

3574
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:53,010
programming they
 

3575
01:19:53,010 --> 01:19:55,280
programming they
might put the other person's needs in

3576
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:55,290
might put the other person's needs in
 

3577
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:57,200
might put the other person's needs in
front of theirs and certain situations

3578
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:57,210
front of theirs and certain situations
 

3579
01:19:57,210 --> 01:19:59,060
front of theirs and certain situations
right you look at think about it as a

3580
01:19:59,060 --> 01:19:59,070
right you look at think about it as a
 

3581
01:19:59,070 --> 01:20:01,160
right you look at think about it as a
return on investment like was my return

3582
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:01,170
return on investment like was my return
 

3583
01:20:01,170 --> 01:20:02,510
return on investment like was my return
on investment as part of that equation

3584
01:20:02,510 --> 01:20:02,520
on investment as part of that equation
 

3585
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:04,700
on investment as part of that equation
that person's happiness you know has

3586
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:04,710
that person's happiness you know has
 

3587
01:20:04,710 --> 01:20:07,220
that person's happiness you know has
some type of you know algorithm waiting

3588
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:07,230
some type of you know algorithm waiting
 

3589
01:20:07,230 --> 01:20:09,770
some type of you know algorithm waiting
to it and the reason why is because I

3590
01:20:09,770 --> 01:20:09,780
to it and the reason why is because I
 

3591
01:20:09,780 --> 01:20:11,660
to it and the reason why is because I
care about them right that's the only

3592
01:20:11,660 --> 01:20:11,670
care about them right that's the only
 

3593
01:20:11,670 --> 01:20:14,750
care about them right that's the only
reason right but if I care about them

3594
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:14,760
reason right but if I care about them
 

3595
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:17,510
reason right but if I care about them
and I show that then my final objective

3596
01:20:17,510 --> 01:20:17,520
and I show that then my final objective
 

3597
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:19,640
and I show that then my final objective
function is length of time of the

3598
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:19,650
function is length of time of the
 

3599
01:20:19,650 --> 01:20:21,890
function is length of time of the
engagement right so you can think of how

3600
01:20:21,890 --> 01:20:21,900
engagement right so you can think of how
 

3601
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:24,380
engagement right so you can think of how
to do this actually quite easily and so

3602
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:24,390
to do this actually quite easily and so
 

3603
01:20:24,390 --> 01:20:28,130
to do this actually quite easily and so
but that's not love well so that's the

3604
01:20:28,130 --> 01:20:28,140
but that's not love well so that's the
 

3605
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:31,990
but that's not love well so that's the
thing it I think it emulates love

3606
01:20:31,990 --> 01:20:32,000
thing it I think it emulates love
 

3607
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,270
thing it I think it emulates love
because we don't have a classical

3608
01:20:35,270 --> 01:20:35,280
because we don't have a classical
 

3609
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:39,800
because we don't have a classical
definition of love right but

3610
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:39,810
definition of love right but
 

3611
01:20:39,810 --> 01:20:42,290
definition of love right but
and we don't have the ability to look

3612
01:20:42,290 --> 01:20:42,300
and we don't have the ability to look
 

3613
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:44,360
and we don't have the ability to look
into each other's minds to see the

3614
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:44,370
into each other's minds to see the
 

3615
01:20:44,370 --> 01:20:47,840
into each other's minds to see the
algorithm and yeah I guess what I'm

3616
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:47,850
algorithm and yeah I guess what I'm
 

3617
01:20:47,850 --> 01:20:49,580
algorithm and yeah I guess what I'm
getting at is is it possible that

3618
01:20:49,580 --> 01:20:49,590
getting at is is it possible that
 

3619
01:20:49,590 --> 01:20:51,080
getting at is is it possible that
especially if that's learned especially

3620
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:51,090
especially if that's learned especially
 

3621
01:20:51,090 --> 01:20:53,180
especially if that's learned especially
if there's some mystery and black box

3622
01:20:53,180 --> 01:20:53,190
if there's some mystery and black box
 

3623
01:20:53,190 --> 01:20:57,350
if there's some mystery and black box
nature to the system how is that you

3624
01:20:57,350 --> 01:20:57,360
nature to the system how is that you
 

3625
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:58,970
nature to the system how is that you
know how is it any different I was any

3626
01:20:58,970 --> 01:20:58,980
know how is it any different I was any
 

3627
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:00,890
know how is it any different I was any
different and in terms of sort of if the

3628
01:21:00,890 --> 01:21:00,900
different and in terms of sort of if the
 

3629
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:03,440
different and in terms of sort of if the
system says I'm cautious I'm afraid of

3630
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:03,450
system says I'm cautious I'm afraid of
 

3631
01:21:03,450 --> 01:21:09,650
system says I'm cautious I'm afraid of
death and it does indicate that it loves

3632
01:21:09,650 --> 01:21:09,660
death and it does indicate that it loves
 

3633
01:21:09,660 --> 01:21:13,010
death and it does indicate that it loves
you another way to sort of phrase I be

3634
01:21:13,010 --> 01:21:13,020
you another way to sort of phrase I be
 

3635
01:21:13,020 --> 01:21:14,300
you another way to sort of phrase I be
curious to see what you think do you

3636
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:14,310
curious to see what you think do you
 

3637
01:21:14,310 --> 01:21:18,110
curious to see what you think do you
think there'll be a time when robots

3638
01:21:18,110 --> 01:21:18,120
think there'll be a time when robots
 

3639
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:20,600
think there'll be a time when robots
should have rights you've kind of

3640
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:20,610
should have rights you've kind of
 

3641
01:21:20,610 --> 01:21:23,030
should have rights you've kind of
phrased the robot in a very roboticist

3642
01:21:23,030 --> 01:21:23,040
phrased the robot in a very roboticist
 

3643
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:25,370
phrased the robot in a very roboticist
way it's just a really good way but

3644
01:21:25,370 --> 01:21:25,380
way it's just a really good way but
 

3645
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:26,900
way it's just a really good way but
saying okay well there's an objective

3646
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:26,910
saying okay well there's an objective
 

3647
01:21:26,910 --> 01:21:29,810
saying okay well there's an objective
function and I can see how you can

3648
01:21:29,810 --> 01:21:29,820
function and I can see how you can
 

3649
01:21:29,820 --> 01:21:31,700
function and I can see how you can
create a compelling human robot

3650
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:31,710
create a compelling human robot
 

3651
01:21:31,710 --> 01:21:33,890
create a compelling human robot
interaction experience that makes you

3652
01:21:33,890 --> 01:21:33,900
interaction experience that makes you
 

3653
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:35,930
interaction experience that makes you
believe that the robot cares for your

3654
01:21:35,930 --> 01:21:35,940
believe that the robot cares for your
 

3655
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:38,330
believe that the robot cares for your
needs and even something like loves you

3656
01:21:38,330 --> 01:21:38,340
needs and even something like loves you
 

3657
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:42,200
needs and even something like loves you
but what if the robot says please don't

3658
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:42,210
but what if the robot says please don't
 

3659
01:21:42,210 --> 01:21:45,020
but what if the robot says please don't
turn me off what if the robot starts

3660
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:45,030
turn me off what if the robot starts
 

3661
01:21:45,030 --> 01:21:47,630
turn me off what if the robot starts
making you feel like there's an entity

3662
01:21:47,630 --> 01:21:47,640
making you feel like there's an entity
 

3663
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:50,510
making you feel like there's an entity
of being a soul there all right do you

3664
01:21:50,510 --> 01:21:50,520
of being a soul there all right do you
 

3665
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:53,870
of being a soul there all right do you
think there'll be a future hopefully you

3666
01:21:53,870 --> 01:21:53,880
think there'll be a future hopefully you
 

3667
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:56,090
think there'll be a future hopefully you
won't laugh too much of this but there

3668
01:21:56,090 --> 01:21:56,100
won't laugh too much of this but there
 

3669
01:21:56,100 --> 01:22:00,740
won't laugh too much of this but there
were there's they do ask for rights so I

3670
01:22:00,740 --> 01:22:00,750
were there's they do ask for rights so I
 

3671
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:06,710
were there's they do ask for rights so I
can see a future if we don't address it

3672
01:22:06,710 --> 01:22:06,720
can see a future if we don't address it
 

3673
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:10,460
can see a future if we don't address it
in the near term where these agents as

3674
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:10,470
in the near term where these agents as
 

3675
01:22:10,470 --> 01:22:13,400
in the near term where these agents as
they adapt and learn could say hey this

3676
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:13,410
they adapt and learn could say hey this
 

3677
01:22:13,410 --> 01:22:15,740
they adapt and learn could say hey this
should be something that's fundamental I

3678
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:15,750
should be something that's fundamental I
 

3679
01:22:15,750 --> 01:22:18,740
should be something that's fundamental I
hopefully think that we would address it

3680
01:22:18,740 --> 01:22:18,750
hopefully think that we would address it
 

3681
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:20,540
hopefully think that we would address it
before it gets to that point you think

3682
01:22:20,540 --> 01:22:20,550
before it gets to that point you think
 

3683
01:22:20,550 --> 01:22:22,160
before it gets to that point you think
so that you think that's a bad future is

3684
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:22,170
so that you think that's a bad future is
 

3685
01:22:22,170 --> 01:22:24,530
so that you think that's a bad future is
like what is that a negative thing where

3686
01:22:24,530 --> 01:22:24,540
like what is that a negative thing where
 

3687
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:26,600
like what is that a negative thing where
they ask or being discriminated against

3688
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:26,610
they ask or being discriminated against
 

3689
01:22:26,610 --> 01:22:31,310
they ask or being discriminated against
I guess it depends on what role have

3690
01:22:31,310 --> 01:22:31,320
I guess it depends on what role have
 

3691
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:34,700
I guess it depends on what role have
they attained at that point right and so

3692
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:34,710
they attained at that point right and so
 

3693
01:22:34,710 --> 01:22:36,440
they attained at that point right and so
if I think about now careful what you

3694
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:36,450
if I think about now careful what you
 

3695
01:22:36,450 --> 01:22:39,020
if I think about now careful what you
say because the robots fifty years from

3696
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:39,030
say because the robots fifty years from
 

3697
01:22:39,030 --> 01:22:40,190
say because the robots fifty years from
when I'll be listening to this and

3698
01:22:40,190 --> 01:22:40,200
when I'll be listening to this and
 

3699
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:42,560
when I'll be listening to this and
you'll be on TV is saying this is what

3700
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:42,570
you'll be on TV is saying this is what
 

3701
01:22:42,570 --> 01:22:45,710
you'll be on TV is saying this is what
roboticists used to believe and so this

3702
01:22:45,710 --> 01:22:45,720
roboticists used to believe and so this
 

3703
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:48,080
roboticists used to believe and so this
is my and as I said I have a bias lens

3704
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:48,090
is my and as I said I have a bias lens
 

3705
01:22:48,090 --> 01:22:50,450
is my and as I said I have a bias lens
and my robot friends will understand

3706
01:22:50,450 --> 01:22:50,460
and my robot friends will understand
 

3707
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:53,780
and my robot friends will understand
that yes but so if you think about it

3708
01:22:53,780 --> 01:22:53,790
that yes but so if you think about it
 

3709
01:22:53,790 --> 01:22:57,200
that yes but so if you think about it
and I actually put this in kind of fee

3710
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:57,210
and I actually put this in kind of fee
 

3711
01:22:57,210 --> 01:23:00,380
and I actually put this in kind of fee
as a robot assists you don't necessarily

3712
01:23:00,380 --> 01:23:00,390
as a robot assists you don't necessarily
 

3713
01:23:00,390 --> 01:23:03,020
as a robot assists you don't necessarily
think of robots as human with human

3714
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:03,030
think of robots as human with human
 

3715
01:23:03,030 --> 01:23:04,850
think of robots as human with human
rights but you could think of them

3716
01:23:04,850 --> 01:23:04,860
rights but you could think of them
 

3717
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:09,140
rights but you could think of them
either in the category of property or

3718
01:23:09,140 --> 01:23:09,150
either in the category of property or
 

3719
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:11,390
either in the category of property or
you can think of them in the category of

3720
01:23:11,390 --> 01:23:11,400
you can think of them in the category of
 

3721
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:16,070
you can think of them in the category of
animals right and so both of those have

3722
01:23:16,070 --> 01:23:16,080
animals right and so both of those have
 

3723
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:19,040
animals right and so both of those have
different types of rights so animals

3724
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:19,050
different types of rights so animals
 

3725
01:23:19,050 --> 01:23:21,800
different types of rights so animals
have their own rights as as a living

3726
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:21,810
have their own rights as as a living
 

3727
01:23:21,810 --> 01:23:24,050
have their own rights as as a living
being but you know they can't vote they

3728
01:23:24,050 --> 01:23:24,060
being but you know they can't vote they
 

3729
01:23:24,060 --> 01:23:28,280
being but you know they can't vote they
can't write they can be euthanized but

3730
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:28,290
can't write they can be euthanized but
 

3731
01:23:28,290 --> 01:23:31,670
can't write they can be euthanized but
as humans if we abuse them we go to jail

3732
01:23:31,670 --> 01:23:31,680
as humans if we abuse them we go to jail
 

3733
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:34,250
as humans if we abuse them we go to jail
like right so they do have some rights

3734
01:23:34,250 --> 01:23:34,260
like right so they do have some rights
 

3735
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:36,800
like right so they do have some rights
that protect them but don't give them

3736
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:36,810
that protect them but don't give them
 

3737
01:23:36,810 --> 01:23:40,430
that protect them but don't give them
the rights of like citizenship and then

3738
01:23:40,430 --> 01:23:40,440
the rights of like citizenship and then
 

3739
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:43,310
the rights of like citizenship and then
if you think about property property the

3740
01:23:43,310 --> 01:23:43,320
if you think about property property the
 

3741
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:45,050
if you think about property property the
rights are associated with the person

3742
01:23:45,050 --> 01:23:45,060
rights are associated with the person
 

3743
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:48,410
rights are associated with the person
right so if someone vandalizes your

3744
01:23:48,410 --> 01:23:48,420
right so if someone vandalizes your
 

3745
01:23:48,420 --> 01:23:52,700
right so if someone vandalizes your
property or steals your property like

3746
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:52,710
property or steals your property like
 

3747
01:23:52,710 --> 01:23:54,140
property or steals your property like
there are some rights but it's

3748
01:23:54,140 --> 01:23:54,150
there are some rights but it's
 

3749
01:23:54,150 --> 01:23:57,610
there are some rights but it's
associated with the person who owns that

3750
01:23:57,610 --> 01:23:57,620
associated with the person who owns that
 

3751
01:23:57,620 --> 01:24:01,160
associated with the person who owns that
if you think about it back in the day

3752
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:01,170
if you think about it back in the day
 

3753
01:24:01,170 --> 01:24:03,230
if you think about it back in the day
and if you remember we talked about you

3754
01:24:03,230 --> 01:24:03,240
and if you remember we talked about you
 

3755
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:06,680
and if you remember we talked about you
know how society has changed women were

3756
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:06,690
know how society has changed women were
 

3757
01:24:06,690 --> 01:24:09,830
know how society has changed women were
property right they were not thought of

3758
01:24:09,830 --> 01:24:09,840
property right they were not thought of
 

3759
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:12,820
property right they were not thought of
as having rights they were thought of as

3760
01:24:12,820 --> 01:24:12,830
as having rights they were thought of as
 

3761
01:24:12,830 --> 01:24:16,490
as having rights they were thought of as
property of like their yeah salting a

3762
01:24:16,490 --> 01:24:16,500
property of like their yeah salting a
 

3763
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:18,890
property of like their yeah salting a
woman meant assaulting the property of

3764
01:24:18,890 --> 01:24:18,900
woman meant assaulting the property of
 

3765
01:24:18,900 --> 01:24:20,209
woman meant assaulting the property of
somebody else's butt

3766
01:24:20,209 --> 01:24:20,219
somebody else's butt
 

3767
01:24:20,219 --> 01:24:23,029
somebody else's butt
exactly and so what I envision is is

3768
01:24:23,029 --> 01:24:23,039
exactly and so what I envision is is
 

3769
01:24:23,039 --> 01:24:25,939
exactly and so what I envision is is
that we will establish some type of norm

3770
01:24:25,939 --> 01:24:25,949
that we will establish some type of norm
 

3771
01:24:25,949 --> 01:24:28,939
that we will establish some type of norm
at some point but that it might evolve

3772
01:24:28,939 --> 01:24:28,949
at some point but that it might evolve
 

3773
01:24:28,949 --> 01:24:30,830
at some point but that it might evolve
right like if you look at women's rights

3774
01:24:30,830 --> 01:24:30,840
right like if you look at women's rights
 

3775
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:34,000
right like if you look at women's rights
now like there are some countries that

3776
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:34,010
now like there are some countries that
 

3777
01:24:34,010 --> 01:24:36,680
now like there are some countries that
don't have and the rest of the world is

3778
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:36,690
don't have and the rest of the world is
 

3779
01:24:36,690 --> 01:24:39,439
don't have and the rest of the world is
like why that makes no sense right and

3780
01:24:39,439 --> 01:24:39,449
like why that makes no sense right and
 

3781
01:24:39,449 --> 01:24:41,930
like why that makes no sense right and
so I do see a world where we do

3782
01:24:41,930 --> 01:24:41,940
so I do see a world where we do
 

3783
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:44,629
so I do see a world where we do
establish some type of grounding it

3784
01:24:44,629 --> 01:24:44,639
establish some type of grounding it
 

3785
01:24:44,639 --> 01:24:46,219
establish some type of grounding it
might be based on property rights it

3786
01:24:46,219 --> 01:24:46,229
might be based on property rights it
 

3787
01:24:46,229 --> 01:24:48,709
might be based on property rights it
might be based on animal rights and if

3788
01:24:48,709 --> 01:24:48,719
might be based on animal rights and if
 

3789
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:52,969
might be based on animal rights and if
it evolves that way I think we will have

3790
01:24:52,969 --> 01:24:52,979
it evolves that way I think we will have
 

3791
01:24:52,979 --> 01:24:55,100
it evolves that way I think we will have
this conversation at that time because

3792
01:24:55,100 --> 01:24:55,110
this conversation at that time because
 

3793
01:24:55,110 --> 01:24:57,080
this conversation at that time because
that's the way our society traditionally

3794
01:24:57,080 --> 01:24:57,090
that's the way our society traditionally
 

3795
01:24:57,090 --> 01:25:02,270
that's the way our society traditionally
has evolved beautifully puts just out of

3796
01:25:02,270 --> 01:25:02,280
has evolved beautifully puts just out of
 

3797
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:05,569
has evolved beautifully puts just out of
curiosity at Anki geebo main field

3798
01:25:05,569 --> 01:25:05,579
curiosity at Anki geebo main field
 

3799
01:25:05,579 --> 01:25:08,779
curiosity at Anki geebo main field
robotics within robot curious eye how it

3800
01:25:08,779 --> 01:25:08,789
robotics within robot curious eye how it
 

3801
01:25:08,789 --> 01:25:10,790
robotics within robot curious eye how it
works we think robotics were all these

3802
01:25:10,790 --> 01:25:10,800
works we think robotics were all these
 

3803
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:13,339
works we think robotics were all these
amazing robotics companies led created

3804
01:25:13,339 --> 01:25:13,349
amazing robotics companies led created
 

3805
01:25:13,349 --> 01:25:17,209
amazing robotics companies led created
by incredible roboticists and they've

3806
01:25:17,209 --> 01:25:17,219
by incredible roboticists and they've
 

3807
01:25:17,219 --> 01:25:21,739
by incredible roboticists and they've
all went out of business recently why do

3808
01:25:21,739 --> 01:25:21,749
all went out of business recently why do
 

3809
01:25:21,749 --> 01:25:23,330
all went out of business recently why do
you think they didn't last long

3810
01:25:23,330 --> 01:25:23,340
you think they didn't last long
 

3811
01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:26,540
you think they didn't last long
why is this so hard to run a robotics

3812
01:25:26,540 --> 01:25:26,550
why is this so hard to run a robotics
 

3813
01:25:26,550 --> 01:25:29,930
why is this so hard to run a robotics
company especially one like these which

3814
01:25:29,930 --> 01:25:29,940
company especially one like these which
 

3815
01:25:29,940 --> 01:25:33,950
company especially one like these which
are fundamentally HR are HRI human robot

3816
01:25:33,950 --> 01:25:33,960
are fundamentally HR are HRI human robot
 

3817
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:38,419
are fundamentally HR are HRI human robot
interaction robots yeah one has a story

3818
01:25:38,419 --> 01:25:38,429
interaction robots yeah one has a story
 

3819
01:25:38,429 --> 01:25:41,660
interaction robots yeah one has a story
only one of them I don't understand and

3820
01:25:41,660 --> 01:25:41,670
only one of them I don't understand and
 

3821
01:25:41,670 --> 01:25:43,729
only one of them I don't understand and
that was on key that's actually the only

3822
01:25:43,729 --> 01:25:43,739
that was on key that's actually the only
 

3823
01:25:43,739 --> 01:25:45,410
that was on key that's actually the only
one I don't understand I don't

3824
01:25:45,410 --> 01:25:45,420
one I don't understand I don't
 

3825
01:25:45,420 --> 01:25:47,149
one I don't understand I don't
understand either it's you know I mean I

3826
01:25:47,149 --> 01:25:47,159
understand either it's you know I mean I
 

3827
01:25:47,159 --> 01:25:48,979
understand either it's you know I mean I
looked like from the outside you know

3828
01:25:48,979 --> 01:25:48,989
looked like from the outside you know
 

3829
01:25:48,989 --> 01:25:51,229
looked like from the outside you know
I've looked at their sheets I've looked

3830
01:25:51,229 --> 01:25:51,239
I've looked at their sheets I've looked
 

3831
01:25:51,239 --> 01:25:52,759
I've looked at their sheets I've looked
like the data that's oh you mean like

3832
01:25:52,759 --> 01:25:52,769
like the data that's oh you mean like
 

3833
01:25:52,769 --> 01:25:57,350
like the data that's oh you mean like
business-wise yeah yeah and like I look

3834
01:25:57,350 --> 01:25:57,360
business-wise yeah yeah and like I look
 

3835
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:59,629
business-wise yeah yeah and like I look
at all I look at that data and I'm like

3836
01:25:59,629 --> 01:25:59,639
at all I look at that data and I'm like
 

3837
01:25:59,639 --> 01:26:02,239
at all I look at that data and I'm like
they seem to have like product market

3838
01:26:02,239 --> 01:26:02,249
they seem to have like product market
 

3839
01:26:02,249 --> 01:26:04,939
they seem to have like product market
fit like so that's the only one I don't

3840
01:26:04,939 --> 01:26:04,949
fit like so that's the only one I don't
 

3841
01:26:04,949 --> 01:26:07,339
fit like so that's the only one I don't
understand the rest of it was product

3842
01:26:07,339 --> 01:26:07,349
understand the rest of it was product
 

3843
01:26:07,349 --> 01:26:08,060
understand the rest of it was product
market fit

3844
01:26:08,060 --> 01:26:08,070
market fit
 

3845
01:26:08,070 --> 01:26:10,100
market fit
what's product market feel if it just

3846
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:10,110
what's product market feel if it just
 

3847
01:26:10,110 --> 01:26:12,200
what's product market feel if it just
just that how do you think about it yes

3848
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:12,210
just that how do you think about it yes
 

3849
01:26:12,210 --> 01:26:14,629
just that how do you think about it yes
so although we rethink robotics was

3850
01:26:14,629 --> 01:26:14,639
so although we rethink robotics was
 

3851
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:16,339
so although we rethink robotics was
getting there right but I think it's

3852
01:26:16,339 --> 01:26:16,349
getting there right but I think it's
 

3853
01:26:16,349 --> 01:26:19,040
getting there right but I think it's
just the timing it just they're the

3854
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:19,050
just the timing it just they're the
 

3855
01:26:19,050 --> 01:26:21,169
just the timing it just they're the
clock just timed out I think if they had

3856
01:26:21,169 --> 01:26:21,179
clock just timed out I think if they had
 

3857
01:26:21,179 --> 01:26:23,239
clock just timed out I think if they had
been given a couple more years if they

3858
01:26:23,239 --> 01:26:23,249
been given a couple more years if they
 

3859
01:26:23,249 --> 01:26:25,609
been given a couple more years if they
would have been okay but the other ones

3860
01:26:25,609 --> 01:26:25,619
would have been okay but the other ones
 

3861
01:26:25,619 --> 01:26:29,209
would have been okay but the other ones
were still fairly early by the time they

3862
01:26:29,209 --> 01:26:29,219
were still fairly early by the time they
 

3863
01:26:29,219 --> 01:26:30,649
were still fairly early by the time they
got into the market and so product

3864
01:26:30,649 --> 01:26:30,659
got into the market and so product
 

3865
01:26:30,659 --> 01:26:33,739
got into the market and so product

01:29:49,469 --> 01:29:52,250
buzz but they didn't make it to that
next level but the second match right

4022
01:29:52,250 --> 01:29:52,260
next level but the second match right
 

4023
01:29:52,260 --> 01:29:56,299
next level but the second match right
the second batch I think might make it

4024
01:29:56,299 --> 01:29:56,309
the second batch I think might make it
 

4025
01:29:56,309 --> 01:29:58,100
the second batch I think might make it
to the next level do you when do you

4026
01:29:58,100 --> 01:29:58,110
to the next level do you when do you
 

4027
01:29:58,110 --> 01:30:02,509
to the next level do you when do you
think the the Facebook of Roja the

4028
01:30:02,509 --> 01:30:02,519
think the the Facebook of Roja the
 

4029
01:30:02,519 --> 01:30:06,589
think the the Facebook of Roja the
Facebook of Robotics sorry take that

4030
01:30:06,589 --> 01:30:06,599
Facebook of Robotics sorry take that
 

4031
01:30:06,599 --> 01:30:08,810
Facebook of Robotics sorry take that
phrase back because people deeply for

01:30:08,810 --> 01:30:08,820
phrase back because people deeply for
 

4033
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:11,509
phrase back because people deeply for
some reason I know why but it's I think

4034
01:30:11,509 --> 01:30:11,519
some reason I know why but it's I think
 

4035
01:30:11,519 --> 01:30:14,180
some reason I know why but it's I think
exaggerated distrust Facebook because of

4036
01:30:14,180 --> 01:30:14,190
exaggerated distrust Facebook because of
 

4037
01:30:14,190 --> 01:30:16,040
exaggerated distrust Facebook because of
the privacy concerns and so on and with

4038
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:16,050
the privacy concerns and so on and with
 

4039
01:30:16,050 --> 01:30:17,390
the privacy concerns and so on and with
robotics one of the things you have to

4040
01:30:17,390 --> 01:30:17,400
robotics one of the things you have to
 

4041
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:19,399
robotics one of the things you have to
make sure all the things we've talked

4042
01:30:19,399 --> 01:30:19,409
make sure all the things we've talked
 

4043
01:30:19,409 --> 01:30:21,919
make sure all the things we've talked
about is to be transparent and have

4044
01:30:21,919 --> 01:30:21,929
about is to be transparent and have
 

4045
01:30:21,929 --> 01:30:24,140
about is to be transparent and have
people deeply trust you to let it well

4046
01:30:24,140 --> 01:30:24,150
people deeply trust you to let it well
 

4047
01:30:24,150 --> 01:30:25,609
people deeply trust you to let it well
robot into their lives into their home

4048
01:30:25,609 --> 01:30:25,619
robot into their lives into their home
 

4049
01:30:25,619 --> 01:30:27,560
robot into their lives into their home
what do you think the second batch of

4050
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:27,570
what do you think the second batch of
 

4051
01:30:27,570 --> 01:30:31,129
what do you think the second batch of
robots local is it five ten years twenty

4052
01:30:31,129 --> 01:30:31,139
robots local is it five ten years twenty
 

4053
01:30:31,139 --> 01:30:34,640
robots local is it five ten years twenty
years that will have robots in our homes

4054
01:30:34,640 --> 01:30:34,650
years that will have robots in our homes
 

4055
01:30:34,650 --> 01:30:37,040
years that will have robots in our homes
and robots in our hearts so if I think

4056
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:37,050
and robots in our hearts so if I think
 

4057
01:30:37,050 --> 01:30:39,169
and robots in our hearts so if I think
about and because I try to follow the

4058
01:30:39,169 --> 01:30:39,179
about and because I try to follow the
 

4059
01:30:39,179 --> 01:30:41,870
about and because I try to follow the
the VC kind of space in terms of robotic

4060
01:30:41,870 --> 01:30:41,880
the VC kind of space in terms of robotic
 

4061
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:44,959
the VC kind of space in terms of robotic
investments and right now I don't know

4062
01:30:44,959 --> 01:30:44,969
investments and right now I don't know
 

4063
01:30:44,969 --> 01:30:46,279
investments and right now I don't know
if they're gonna be successful I don't

4064
01:30:46,279 --> 01:30:46,289
if they're gonna be successful I don't
 

4065
01:30:46,289 --> 01:30:49,520
if they're gonna be successful I don't
know if this is the second batch but

4066
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:49,530
know if this is the second batch but
 

4067
01:30:49,530 --> 01:30:51,169
know if this is the second batch but
there's only one batch that's focused on

4068
01:30:51,169 --> 01:30:51,179
there's only one batch that's focused on
 

4069
01:30:51,179 --> 01:30:53,419
there's only one batch that's focused on
like the first batch right and then

4070
01:30:53,419 --> 01:30:53,429
like the first batch right and then
 

4071
01:30:53,429 --> 01:30:56,089
like the first batch right and then
there's all these self-driving X's right

4072
01:30:56,089 --> 01:30:56,099
there's all these self-driving X's right
 

4073
01:30:56,099 --> 01:30:58,729
there's all these self-driving X's right
and so I don't know if they're a first

4074
01:30:58,729 --> 01:30:58,739
and so I don't know if they're a first
 

4075
01:30:58,739 --> 01:31:00,800
and so I don't know if they're a first
batch of something or if I

4076
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:00,810
batch of something or if I
 

4077
01:31:00,810 --> 01:31:02,330
batch of something or if I
like I don't know quite where they fit

4078
01:31:02,330 --> 01:31:02,340
like I don't know quite where they fit
 

4079
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:05,840
like I don't know quite where they fit
in but there's a number of companies the

4080
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:05,850
in but there's a number of companies the
 

4081
01:31:05,850 --> 01:31:08,780
in but there's a number of companies the
co robot I'll call them Co robots that

4082
01:31:08,780 --> 01:31:08,790
co robot I'll call them Co robots that
 

4083
01:31:08,790 --> 01:31:12,500
co robot I'll call them Co robots that
are still getting VC investments they

4084
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:12,510
are still getting VC investments they
 

4085
01:31:12,510 --> 01:31:14,660
are still getting VC investments they
some of them have some of the flavor of

4086
01:31:14,660 --> 01:31:14,670
some of them have some of the flavor of
 

4087
01:31:14,670 --> 01:31:16,340
some of them have some of the flavor of
like rethink robotics some of them have

4088
01:31:16,340 --> 01:31:16,350
like rethink robotics some of them have
 

4089
01:31:16,350 --> 01:31:18,920
like rethink robotics some of them have
some of the flavor like hurry

4090
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:18,930
some of the flavor like hurry
 

4091
01:31:18,930 --> 01:31:20,960
some of the flavor like hurry
what's a col robot of course so

4092
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:20,970
what's a col robot of course so
 

4093
01:31:20,970 --> 01:31:24,770
what's a col robot of course so
basically a robot in human working in

4094
01:31:24,770 --> 01:31:24,780
basically a robot in human working in
 

4095
01:31:24,780 --> 01:31:28,040
basically a robot in human working in
the same space so some of the companies

4096
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:28,050
the same space so some of the companies
 

4097
01:31:28,050 --> 01:31:31,640
the same space so some of the companies
are focused on manufacturing so having a

4098
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:31,650
are focused on manufacturing so having a
 

4099
01:31:31,650 --> 01:31:35,000
are focused on manufacturing so having a
robot and human working together in a

4100
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:35,010
robot and human working together in a
 

4101
01:31:35,010 --> 01:31:38,290
robot and human working together in a
factory some of these Co robots are

4102
01:31:38,290 --> 01:31:38,300
factory some of these Co robots are
 

4103
01:31:38,300 --> 01:31:40,700
factory some of these Co robots are
robots and humans working in the home

4104
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:40,710
robots and humans working in the home
 

4105
01:31:40,710 --> 01:31:42,470
robots and humans working in the home
working in clinics like there's

4106
01:31:42,470 --> 01:31:42,480
working in clinics like there's
 

4107
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:44,120
working in clinics like there's
different versions of these companies in

4108
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:44,130
different versions of these companies in
 

4109
01:31:44,130 --> 01:31:46,370
different versions of these companies in
terms of their products but they're all

4110
01:31:46,370 --> 01:31:46,380
terms of their products but they're all
 

4111
01:31:46,380 --> 01:31:49,280
terms of their products but they're all
so rethink robotics would be like one of

4112
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:49,290
so rethink robotics would be like one of
 

4113
01:31:49,290 --> 01:31:52,640
so rethink robotics would be like one of
the first at least well known companies

4114
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:52,650
the first at least well known companies
 

4115
01:31:52,650 --> 01:31:55,130
the first at least well known companies
focus on this space so I don't know if

4116
01:31:55,130 --> 01:31:55,140
focus on this space so I don't know if
 

4117
01:31:55,140 --> 01:31:56,810
focus on this space so I don't know if
this second if this is a second batch or

4118
01:31:56,810 --> 01:31:56,820
this second if this is a second batch or
 

4119
01:31:56,820 --> 01:32:00,830
this second if this is a second batch or
if this is still part of the first batch

4120
01:32:00,830 --> 01:32:00,840
if this is still part of the first batch
 

4121
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:02,780
if this is still part of the first batch
that I don't know and then you have all

4122
01:32:02,780 --> 01:32:02,790
that I don't know and then you have all
 

4123
01:32:02,790 --> 01:32:04,010
that I don't know and then you have all
these other companies in this

4124
01:32:04,010 --> 01:32:04,020
these other companies in this
 

4125
01:32:04,020 --> 01:32:07,190
these other companies in this
self-driving you know space and I don't

4126
01:32:07,190 --> 01:32:07,200
self-driving you know space and I don't
 

4127
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:10,190
self-driving you know space and I don't
know if that's a first batch or again a

4128
01:32:10,190 --> 01:32:10,200
know if that's a first batch or again a
 

4129
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:12,650
know if that's a first batch or again a
second batch yeah so there's a lot of

4130
01:32:12,650 --> 01:32:12,660
second batch yeah so there's a lot of
 

4131
01:32:12,660 --> 01:32:14,420
second batch yeah so there's a lot of
mystery about this now of course it's

4132
01:32:14,420 --> 01:32:14,430
mystery about this now of course it's
 

4133
01:32:14,430 --> 01:32:16,190
mystery about this now of course it's
hard to say that this is the second

4134
01:32:16,190 --> 01:32:16,200
hard to say that this is the second
 

4135
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:17,960
hard to say that this is the second
batch until it you know approves

4136
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:17,970
batch until it you know approves
 

4137
01:32:17,970 --> 01:32:19,760
batch until it you know approves
outright correct exactly yeah we need a

4138
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:19,770
outright correct exactly yeah we need a
 

4139
01:32:19,770 --> 01:32:22,180
outright correct exactly yeah we need a
unicorn yeah exactly

4140
01:32:22,180 --> 01:32:22,190
unicorn yeah exactly
 

4141
01:32:22,190 --> 01:32:25,280
unicorn yeah exactly
the why do you think people are so

4142
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:25,290
the why do you think people are so
 

4143
01:32:25,290 --> 01:32:29,300
the why do you think people are so
afraid at least in popular culture of

4144
01:32:29,300 --> 01:32:29,310
afraid at least in popular culture of
 

4145
01:32:29,310 --> 01:32:31,370
afraid at least in popular culture of
legged robots like those work than

4146
01:32:31,370 --> 01:32:31,380
legged robots like those work than
 

4147
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:33,350
legged robots like those work than
Boston Dynamics or just robotics in

4148
01:32:33,350 --> 01:32:33,360
Boston Dynamics or just robotics in
 

4149
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:35,210
Boston Dynamics or just robotics in
general if you were to psychoanalyze

4150
01:32:35,210 --> 01:32:35,220
general if you were to psychoanalyze
 

4151
01:32:35,220 --> 01:32:38,090
general if you were to psychoanalyze
that fear what do you make of it and

4152
01:32:38,090 --> 01:32:38,100
that fear what do you make of it and
 

4153
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:40,610
that fear what do you make of it and
should they be afraid sorry so should

4154
01:32:40,610 --> 01:32:40,620
should they be afraid sorry so should
 

4155
01:32:40,620 --> 01:32:42,050
should they be afraid sorry so should
people be afraid I don't think people

4156
01:32:42,050 --> 01:32:42,060
people be afraid I don't think people
 

4157
01:32:42,060 --> 01:32:45,440
people be afraid I don't think people
should be afraid but with a caveat I

4158
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:45,450
should be afraid but with a caveat I
 

4159
01:32:45,450 --> 01:32:46,760
should be afraid but with a caveat I
don't think people should be afraid

4160
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:46,770
don't think people should be afraid
 

4161
01:32:46,770 --> 01:32:51,100
don't think people should be afraid
given that most of us in this world

4162
01:32:51,100 --> 01:32:51,110
given that most of us in this world
 

4163
01:32:51,110 --> 01:32:54,050
given that most of us in this world
understand that we need to change

4164
01:32:54,050 --> 01:32:54,060
understand that we need to change
 

4165
01:32:54,060 --> 01:32:58,640
understand that we need to change
something right so given that now things

4166
01:32:58,640 --> 01:32:58,650
something right so given that now things
 

4167
01:32:58,650 --> 01:33:00,980
something right so given that now things
don't change be very afraid

4168
01:33:00,980 --> 01:33:00,990
don't change be very afraid
 

4169
01:33:00,990 --> 01:33:03,890
don't change be very afraid
what which is the dimension of change

4170
01:33:03,890 --> 01:33:03,900
what which is the dimension of change
 

4171
01:33:03,900 --> 01:33:05,570
what which is the dimension of change
that's needed so changing of thinking

4172
01:33:05,570 --> 01:33:05,580
that's needed so changing of thinking
 

4173
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:08,450
that's needed so changing of thinking
about the ramifications thinking about

4174
01:33:08,450 --> 01:33:08,460
about the ramifications thinking about

and military just not as often talked
 

4207
01:33:46,739 --> 01:33:48,790

overall you're saying if we start to

4220
01:34:03,049 --> 01:34:03,059
overall you're saying if we start to
 

4221
01:34:03,059 --> 01:34:04,520
overall you're saying if we start to
think more and more as a community about

4222
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:04,530
think more and more as a community about
 

4223

these ethical issues people should not
 

4225
01:34:06,329 --> 01:34:08,060
these ethical issues people should not
be afraid yeah I don't think people

4226
01:34:08,060 --> 01:34:08,070
be afraid yeah I don't think people
 

4227
01:34:08,070 --> 01:34:09,859
be afraid yeah I don't think people
should be afraid I think that the return

4228
01:34:09,859 --> 01:34:09,869
should be afraid I think that the return
 

4229
01:34:09,869 --> 01:34:12,950
should be afraid I think that the return
on investment the impact positive impact

4230
01:34:12,950 --> 01:34:12,960
on investment the impact positive impact
 

4231
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:15,979
on investment the impact positive impact
will outweigh any of the potentially

4232
01:34:15,979 --> 01:34:15,989
will outweigh any of the potentially
 

4233
01:34:15,989 --> 01:34:17,089
will outweigh any of the potentially
negative impacts

4234
01:34:17,089 --> 01:34:17,099
negative impacts
 

4235
01:34:17,099 --> 01:34:19,850

do you have worries of existential

4236
01:34:19,850 --> 01:34:19,860
do you have worries of existential
 

4237
01:34:19,860 --> 01:34:23,510
do you have worries of existential
threats of robots or AI that some people

4238
01:34:23,510 --> 01:34:23,520
threats of robots or AI that some people
 

4239
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:26,959
threats of robots or AI that some people
kind of talk about and romanticize about

4240
01:34:26,959 --> 01:34:26,969
kind of talk about and romanticize about
 

4241
01:34:26,969 --> 01:34:28,910
kind of talk about and romanticize about
and then you know in those decade in the

4242
01:34:28,910 --> 01:34:28,920
and then you know in those decade in the
 

4243
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:32,209
and then you know in those decade in the
next few decades no I don't singularity

4244
01:34:32,209 --> 01:34:32,219
next few decades no I don't singularity
 

4245
01:34:32,219 --> 01:34:35,299
next few decades no I don't singularity
will be an example so my concept is is

4246
01:34:35,299 --> 01:34:35,309
will be an example so my concept is is
 

4247
01:34:35,309 --> 01:34:38,569
will be an example so my concept is is
that so remember robots AI is designed

4248
01:34:38,569 --> 01:34:38,579
that so remember robots AI is designed
 

4249
01:34:38,579 --> 01:34:41,660
that so remember robots AI is designed
by people yes it has our values and I

4250
01:34:41,660 --> 01:34:41,670
by people yes it has our values and I
 

4251
01:34:41,670 --> 01:34:44,030
by people yes it has our values and I
always correlate this with a parent and

4252
01:34:44,030 --> 01:34:44,040
always correlate this with a parent and
 

4253
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:44,540
always correlate this with a parent and
a child

4254
01:34:44,540 --> 01:34:44,550
a child
 

4255
01:34:44,550 --> 01:34:46,640
a child
all right so think about it as a parent

4256
01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:46,650
all right so think about it as a parent
 

4257
01:34:46,650 --> 01:34:49,040
all right so think about it as a parent
would we want we want our kids to have a

4258
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:49,050
would we want we want our kids to have a
 

4259
01:34:49,050 --> 01:34:50,709
would we want we want our kids to have a
better life than us we want them to

4260
01:34:50,709 --> 01:34:50,719
better life than us we want them to
 

4261
01:34:50,719 --> 01:34:54,979
better life than us we want them to
expand we want them to experience the

4262
01:34:54,979 --> 01:34:54,989
expand we want them to experience the
 

4263
01:34:54,989 --> 01:34:58,100
expand we want them to experience the
world and then as we grow older our kids

4264
01:34:58,100 --> 01:34:58,110
world and then as we grow older our kids
 

4265
01:34:58,110 --> 01:35:00,919
world and then as we grow older our kids
think and know they're smarter and

4266
01:35:00,919 --> 01:35:00,929
think and know they're smarter and
 

4267
01:35:00,929 --> 01:35:03,680
think and know they're smarter and
better and more intelligent and have

4268
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:03,690
better and more intelligent and have
 

4269
01:35:03,690 --> 01:35:06,379
better and more intelligent and have
better opportunities and they may even

4270
01:35:06,379 --> 01:35:06,389
better opportunities and they may even
 

4271
01:35:06,389 --> 01:35:08,959
better opportunities and they may even
stop listening to us they don't go out

4272
01:35:08,959 --> 01:35:08,969
stop listening to us they don't go out
 

4273
01:35:08,969 --> 01:35:11,120
stop listening to us they don't go out
and then kill us right like think about

4274
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:11,130
and then kill us right like think about
 

4275
01:35:11,130 --> 01:35:13,430
and then kill us right like think about
it it's because we it's instilled in

4276
01:35:13,430 --> 01:35:13,440
it it's because we it's instilled in
 

4277
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:15,470
it it's because we it's instilled in
them values we instilled in them this

4278
01:35:15,470 --> 01:35:15,480
them values we instilled in them this
 

4279
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:18,500
them values we instilled in them this
whole aspect of community and yes even

4280

whole aspect of community and yes even
 

4281
01:35:18,510 --> 01:35:20,479
whole aspect of community and yes even
though you're maybe smarter and more

01:35:20,479 --> 01:35:20,489
though you're maybe smarter and more
 

4283
01:35:20,489 --> 01:35:23,060
though you're maybe smarter and more
have more money and data it's still

4284
01:35:23,060 --> 01:35:23,070
have more money and data it's still
 

4285
01:35:23,070 --> 01:35:27,260

01:35:28,549 --> 01:35:28,559
so that's what I believe so even
 

4289
01:35:28,559 --> 01:35:29,959
so that's what I believe so even
like you know we've created the

4290
01:35:29,959 --> 01:35:29,969
like you know we've created the
 

4291
01:35:29,969 --> 01:35:32,540
like you know we've created the
singularity and some archaic system back

4292
01:35:32,540 --> 01:35:32,550
singularity and some archaic system back
 

4293
01:35:32,550 --> 01:35:35,660
singularity and some archaic system back
in like 1980 that suddenly evolves the

4294
01:35:35,660 --> 01:35:35,670
in like 1980 that suddenly evolves the
 

4295
01:35:35,670 --> 01:35:38,660
in like 1980 that suddenly evolves the
fact is it might say I am smarter I am

4296
01:35:38,660 --> 01:35:38,670
fact is it might say I am smarter I am
 

4297
01:35:38,670 --> 01:35:42,580

relationship between robots and humans
 

4325
01:36:19,139 --> 01:36:21,410
relationship between robots and humans
right that symbiotic relationship is

4326

4330
01:36:28,399 --> 01:36:28,409
us right but think about it even though
 

4331
01:36:28,409 --> 01:36:31,129
us right but think about it even though
they enslaved us they needed us to be

4332
01:36:31,129 --> 01:36:31,139
they enslaved us they needed us to be
 

4333
01:36:31,139 --> 01:36:33,830
they enslaved us they needed us to be
happy right and in order to be happy

4334
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:33,840
happy right and in order to be happy
 

4335
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:35,510

they had to create this Kruti world that

4336
01:36:35,510 --> 01:36:35,520
they had to create this Kruti world that
 

4337
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:37,129
they had to create this Kruti world that
they then had to live in right that's

4338
01:36:37,129 --> 01:36:37,139
they then had to live in right that's
 

4339
01:36:37,139 --> 01:36:41,600
they then had to live in right that's
the whole but then there were humans

4340
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:41,610
the whole but then there were humans
 

4341
01:36:41,610 --> 01:36:45,020
the whole but then there were humans
that had a choice wait like you had a

4342
01:36:45,020 --> 01:36:45,030
that had a choice wait like you had a
 

4343
01:36:45,030 --> 01:36:47,750
that had a choice wait like you had a
choice to stay in this horrific horrific

4344
01:36:47,750 --> 01:36:47,760
choice to stay in this horrific horrific
 

4345
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:51,020
choice to stay in this horrific horrific
world where it was your fantasy and life

4346
01:36:51,020 --> 01:36:51,030
world where it was your fantasy and life
 

4347
01:36:51,030 --> 01:36:53,299
world where it was your fantasy and life
with all of the anomalies perfection but

4348
01:36:53,299 --> 01:36:53,309
with all of the anomalies perfection but
 

4349
01:36:53,309 --> 01:36:56,750
with all of the anomalies perfection but
not accurate or you can choose to be on

4350
01:36:56,750 --> 01:36:56,760
not accurate or you can choose to be on
 

4351
01:36:56,760 --> 01:37:00,830
not accurate or you can choose to be on
your own and like have maybe no food for

4352
01:37:00,830 --> 01:37:00,840
your own and like have maybe no food for
 

4353
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:03,799
your own and like have maybe no food for
a couple of days but you were totally

4354
01:37:03,799 --> 01:37:03,809
a couple of days but you were totally
 

4355
01:37:03,809 --> 01:37:07,279
a couple of days but you were totally
autonomous and so I think of that as and

4356
01:37:07,279 --> 01:37:07,289
autonomous and so I think of that as and
 

4357
01:37:07,289 --> 01:37:08,990
autonomous and so I think of that as and
that's why so it's not necessarily us

4358
01:37:08,990 --> 01:37:09,000
that's why so it's not necessarily us
 

4359
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,029
that's why so it's not necessarily us
being enslaved but I think about us

4360
01:37:11,029 --> 01:37:11,039
being enslaved but I think about us
 

4361
01:37:11,039 --> 01:37:12,560
being enslaved but I think about us
having this symbiotic relationship

4362
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:12,570
having this symbiotic relationship
 

4363
01:37:12,570 --> 01:37:14,720
having this symbiotic relationship
robots and AI even if they become

4364
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:14,730
robots and AI even if they become
 

4365
01:37:14,730 --> 01:37:16,520
robots and AI even if they become
sentient they're still part of our

4366
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:16,530
sentient they're still part of our
 

4367
01:37:16,530 --> 01:37:19,069
sentient they're still part of our
society and they will suffer just as

4368
01:37:19,069 --> 01:37:19,079
society and they will suffer just as
 

4369
01:37:19,079 --> 01:37:22,549
society and they will suffer just as
much as us and there there will be some

4370
01:37:22,549 --> 01:37:22,559
much as us and there there will be some
 

4371
01:37:22,559 --> 01:37:24,290
much as us and there there will be some
kind of equilibrium that we'll have to

4372
01:37:24,290 --> 01:37:24,300
kind of equilibrium that we'll have to
 

4373
01:37:24,300 --> 01:37:26,419
kind of equilibrium that we'll have to
find some somebody out of relationship

4374
01:37:26,419 --> 01:37:26,429
find some somebody out of relationship
 

4375
01:37:26,429 --> 01:37:28,310
find some somebody out of relationship
and then you have the ethicist the

4376
01:37:28,310 --> 01:37:28,320
and then you have the ethicist the
 

4377
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:31,430
and then you have the ethicist the
robotics folks that like no this has got

4378
01:37:31,430 --> 01:37:31,440
robotics folks that like no this has got

4409
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:24,860
I deal with drama all the time yeah but
the reason why I went to pick data's

4410
01:38:24,860 --> 01:38:24,870
the reason why I went to pick data's
 

4411
01:38:24,870 --> 01:38:28,190
the reason why I went to pick data's
brain is because I I could have a

4412
01:38:28,190 --> 01:38:28,200
brain is because I I could have a
 

4413
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:31,520
brain is because I I could have a
conversation with him and ask for
