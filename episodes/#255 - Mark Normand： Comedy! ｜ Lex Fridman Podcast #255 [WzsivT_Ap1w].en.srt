what have you done you're a barista

4222
01:11:29,270 --> 01:11:29,280
what have you done you're a barista
 

4223
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:30,790
what have you done you're a barista
so uh

4224
01:11:30,790 --> 01:11:30,800
so uh
 

4225
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:33,110
so uh
you know i just think uh

4226
01:11:33,110 --> 01:11:33,120
you know i just think uh
 

4227
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:35,030
you know i just think uh
i think space travel is good because you

4228
01:11:35,030 --> 01:11:35,040
i think space travel is good because you
 

4229
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:36,070
i think space travel is good because you
learn

4230
01:11:36,070 --> 01:11:36,080
learn
 

4231
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:38,229
learn
about the place you're living in from

4232
01:11:38,229 --> 01:11:38,239
about the place you're living in from
 

4233
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:39,590
about the place you're living in from
going to space

4234
01:11:39,590 --> 01:11:39,600
going to space
 

4235
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,590
going to space
it kind of helps you learn about this

4236
01:11:41,590 --> 01:11:41,600
it kind of helps you learn about this
 

4237
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:42,470
it kind of helps you learn about this
more

4238
01:11:42,470 --> 01:11:42,480
more
 

4239
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:43,669
more
you could say what's the point of going

4240
01:11:43,669 --> 01:11:43,679
you could say what's the point of going
 

4241
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:45,669
you could say what's the point of going
to this other there but it it does help

4242
01:11:45,669 --> 01:11:45,679
to this other there but it it does help
 

4243
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:48,470
to this other there but it it does help
i think yeah doing difficult things in

4244
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:48,480
i think yeah doing difficult things in
 

4245
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:50,630
i think yeah doing difficult things in
the engineering space seems to be a way

4246
01:11:50,630 --> 01:11:50,640
the engineering space seems to be a way
 

4247
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,950
the engineering space seems to be a way
to develop like as a

4248
01:11:52,950 --> 01:11:52,960
to develop like as a
 

4249
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:55,110
to develop like as a
as almost like an accident as a side

4250
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:55,120
as almost like an accident as a side
 

4251
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:56,950
as almost like an accident as a side
effect of doing a really difficult thing

4252
01:11:56,950 --> 01:11:56,960
effect of doing a really difficult thing
 

4253
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:58,870
effect of doing a really difficult thing
in a team of brilliant people you

4254
01:11:58,870 --> 01:11:58,880
in a team of brilliant people you
 

4255
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:01,270
in a team of brilliant people you
develop things like the internet and you

4256
01:12:01,270 --> 01:12:01,280
develop things like the internet and you
 

4257
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:02,870
develop things like the internet and you
could argue that the internet maybe is

4258
01:12:02,870 --> 01:12:02,880
could argue that the internet maybe is
 

4259
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:04,470
could argue that the internet maybe is
not so good for society no i'm just

does yeah that's interesting and i'm not
sure if that's some kind of

4348
01:13:42,270 --> 01:13:42,280
sure if that's some kind of
 

4349
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:44,390
sure if that's some kind of
anthropomorphism like where i'm

4350
01:13:44,390 --> 01:13:44,400
anthropomorphism like where i'm
 

4351
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:47,510
anthropomorphism like where i'm
projecting right my hopes for this what

4352
01:13:47,510 --> 01:13:47,520
projecting right my hopes for this what
 

4353
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,590
projecting right my hopes for this what
this thing is but maybe a little of that

4354
01:13:49,590 --> 01:13:49,600
this thing is but maybe a little of that
 

4355
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,350
this thing is but maybe a little of that
but it's kind of built in i mean it's

4356
01:13:51,350 --> 01:13:51,360
but it's kind of built in i mean it's
 

4357
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,430
but it's kind of built in i mean it's
just a source of joy maybe it it's

4358
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:53,440
just a source of joy maybe it it's
 

4359
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:54,870
just a source of joy maybe it it's
connected to the fact that there's just

4360
01:13:54,870 --> 01:13:54,880
connected to the fact that there's just
 

4361
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:57,750
connected to the fact that there's just
like a loneliness within all of us

4362
01:13:57,750 --> 01:13:57,760
like a loneliness within all of us

so uh i'm with you and i think this is
why i don't think robots will take over

4406

why i don't think robots will take over
 

4407
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:42,070

if robots get human emotions
 

4415
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:50,709
if robots get human emotions
that is scary because they could they

4416
01:14:50,709 --> 01:14:50,719
that is scary because they could they
 

4417
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:52,070
that is scary because they could they
could get mad at us and kill us and

4418
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:52,080
could get mad at us and kill us and
 

4419
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:53,350
could get mad at us and kill us and
they're stronger they don't need sleep

4420
01:14:53,350 --> 01:14:53,360
they're stronger they don't need sleep
 

4421

know but if they have
emotions then i think we can dominate

emotions then i think we can dominate
 

4431
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,470
emotions then i think we can dominate
them because who's that emotion who

we can bully them
 

4445
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:17,669
we can bully them
emotionally manipulate robots yes that's

4446
01:15:17,669 --> 01:15:17,679
emotionally manipulate robots yes that's
 

4447
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:19,830
emotionally manipulate robots yes that's
when we'll win

4448
01:15:19,830 --> 01:15:19,840
when we'll win
 

4449
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:21,270
when we'll win
right now they could kill us they could

4450
01:15:21,270 --> 01:15:21,280
right now they could kill us they could
 

4451
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:22,229

this goes back to your father being able

4468
01:15:37,189 --> 01:15:37,199
this goes back to your father being able
 

4469
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:39,350
this goes back to your father being able
to undercut you with a single word

4470
01:15:39,350 --> 01:15:39,360
to undercut you with a single word
 

4471
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:41,430
to undercut you with a single word
you're right yeah so we're the creators

4472
01:15:41,430 --> 01:15:41,440
you're right yeah so we're the creators
 

4473
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:43,110
you're right yeah so we're the creators
of the robots and then the robots will

4474
01:15:43,110 --> 01:15:43,120
of the robots and then the robots will
 

4475
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:45,590
of the robots and then the robots will
just you you would say the the exact

4476
01:15:45,590 --> 01:15:45,600
just you you would say the the exact
 

4477
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,910
just you you would say the the exact
thing yeah where the robot would be like

4478
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:47,920
thing yeah where the robot would be like
 

4479
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,990
thing yeah where the robot would be like
that son of a [\h__\h] and then he goes

4480
01:15:49,990 --> 01:15:50,000
that son of a [\h__\h] and then he goes
 

4481
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,070
that son of a [\h__\h] and then he goes
back to his hole and just sits there

4482
01:15:52,070 --> 01:15:52,080
back to his hole and just sits there
 

4483
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:54,470
back to his hole and just sits there
miserable right yeah hardware looks more

4484
01:15:54,470 --> 01:15:54,480
miserable right yeah hardware looks more
 

4485
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:57,270
miserable right yeah hardware looks more
like software to me you can't get it up

4486
01:15:57,270 --> 01:15:57,280
like software to me you can't get it up
 

4487
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:58,550
like software to me you can't get it up
yadda yadda

4488
01:15:58,550 --> 01:15:58,560
yadda yadda
 

4489
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:00,149
yadda yadda
yeah but i'm not worried about robots

4490
01:16:00,149 --> 01:16:00,159
yeah but i'm not worried about robots
 

4491
01:16:00,159 --> 01:16:01,910
yeah but i'm not worried about robots
and i think self what do you think about

4492
01:16:01,910 --> 01:16:01,920
and i think self what do you think about
 

4493
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:04,950
and i think self what do you think about
the self-driving cars is that just

4494
01:16:04,950 --> 01:16:04,960
the self-driving cars is that just
 

4495
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,709
the self-driving cars is that just
wiping out the horse and buggy isn't

4496
01:16:06,709 --> 01:16:06,719
wiping out the horse and buggy isn't
 

4497
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:09,350
wiping out the horse and buggy isn't
that just progression of technology

4498
01:16:09,350 --> 01:16:09,360
that just progression of technology
 

4499
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:10,870
that just progression of technology
yeah so i don't know if you've driven in

4500
01:16:10,870 --> 01:16:10,880
yeah so i don't know if you've driven in
 

4501
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:13,510
yeah so i don't know if you've driven in
a tesla for example i have i've i wrote

4502
01:16:13,510 --> 01:16:13,520
a tesla for example i have i've i wrote
 

4503
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:16,070
a tesla for example i have i've i wrote
in the uh the passage

4504
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:16,080
in the uh the passage
 

4505
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:18,070
in the uh the passage
yeah there's several stages in that i

4506
01:16:18,070 --> 01:16:18,080
yeah there's several stages in that i
 

4507
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:19,510
yeah there's several stages in that i
think it's the problems way harder than

4508
01:16:19,510 --> 01:16:19,520
think it's the problems way harder than
 

4509
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:20,790
think it's the problems way harder than
people realize

4510
01:16:20,790 --> 01:16:20,800
people realize
 

4511
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,950
people realize
and for quite a while it'll just make

4512
01:16:22,950 --> 01:16:22,960
and for quite a while it'll just make
 

4513
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:25,510
and for quite a while it'll just make
driving more pleasant it'll make it less

4514
01:16:25,510 --> 01:16:25,520
driving more pleasant it'll make it less
 

4515
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:27,510
driving more pleasant it'll make it less
stressful it'll take over some of the

4516
01:16:27,510 --> 01:16:27,520
stressful it'll take over some of the
 

4517
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:29,430
stressful it'll take over some of the
boring bits for you

4518
01:16:29,430 --> 01:16:29,440
boring bits for you
 

4519
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:30,709
boring bits for you
and make it easier like there's

4520
01:16:30,709 --> 01:16:30,719
and make it easier like there's
 

4521
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:32,149
and make it easier like there's
something that happens actually when the

4522
01:16:32,149 --> 01:16:32,159
something that happens actually when the
 

4523
01:16:32,159 --> 01:16:33,189
something that happens actually when the
car

4524
01:16:33,189 --> 01:16:33,199
car
 

4525
01:16:33,199 --> 01:16:36,390
car
is driving for you in the following way

4526
01:16:36,390 --> 01:16:36,400
is driving for you in the following way
 

4527
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:38,790
is driving for you in the following way
like it's it's staying in the lane it's

4528
01:16:38,790 --> 01:16:38,800
like it's it's staying in the lane it's
 

4529
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,070
like it's it's staying in the lane it's
keeping distance to the car in front of

4530
01:16:40,070 --> 01:16:40,080
keeping distance to the car in front of
 

4531
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:42,310
keeping distance to the car in front of
you maybe it's changing lanes

4532
01:16:42,310 --> 01:16:42,320
you maybe it's changing lanes
 

4533
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:44,470
you maybe it's changing lanes
it allows you to relax a little bit like

4534
01:16:44,470 --> 01:16:44,480
it allows you to relax a little bit like
 

4535
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:46,550
it allows you to relax a little bit like
yes you become

4536
01:16:46,550 --> 01:16:46,560
yes you become
 

4537
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,310
yes you become
you still have to be alert but you

4538
01:16:48,310 --> 01:16:48,320
you still have to be alert but you
 

4539
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:49,910
you still have to be alert but you
become like a passenger and you get to

4540
01:16:49,910 --> 01:16:49,920
become like a passenger and you get to
 

4541
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:51,910
become like a passenger and you get to
like take in the world i mean somehow

4542
01:16:51,910 --> 01:16:51,920
like take in the world i mean somehow
 

4543
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:54,470
like take in the world i mean somehow
that's more relaxing without making you

4544
01:16:54,470 --> 01:16:54,480
that's more relaxing without making you
 

4545
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:56,149
that's more relaxing without making you
necessarily

4546
01:16:56,149 --> 01:16:56,159
necessarily
 

4547
01:16:56,159 --> 01:16:57,189
necessarily
like

4548
01:16:57,189 --> 01:16:57,199
like
 

4549
01:16:57,199 --> 01:16:59,910
like
bored more it's energized anymore so i

4550
01:16:59,910 --> 01:16:59,920
bored more it's energized anymore so i
 

4551
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:01,030
bored more it's energized anymore so i
just think it makes the driving

4552
01:17:01,030 --> 01:17:01,040
just think it makes the driving
 

4553
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:02,470
just think it makes the driving
experience more pleasant

4554
01:17:02,470 --> 01:17:02,480
experience more pleasant
 

4555
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:04,709
experience more pleasant
but when you actually fully automate

4556
01:17:04,709 --> 01:17:04,719
but when you actually fully automate
 

4557
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:06,310
but when you actually fully automate
cars when you can just completely tune

4558
01:17:06,310 --> 01:17:06,320
cars when you can just completely tune
 

4559
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:08,950
cars when you can just completely tune
out start reading a book or go to sleep

4560
01:17:08,950 --> 01:17:08,960
out start reading a book or go to sleep
 

4561
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:11,669
out start reading a book or go to sleep
that might change

4562
01:17:11,669 --> 01:17:11,679
that might change
 

4563
01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:12,950
that might change
society

4564
01:17:12,950 --> 01:17:12,960
society
 

4565
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:15,430
society
like in ways we don't even understand

4566
01:17:15,430 --> 01:17:15,440
like in ways we don't even understand
 

4567
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:17,830
like in ways we don't even understand
because you'll have

4568
01:17:17,830 --> 01:17:17,840
because you'll have
 

4569
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:19,990
because you'll have
i mean the the

4570
01:17:19,990 --> 01:17:20,000
i mean the the
 

4571
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,510
i mean the the
they'll probably change the nature of

4572
01:17:21,510 --> 01:17:21,520
they'll probably change the nature of
 

4573
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:23,189
they'll probably change the nature of
roads because the cars because now you

4574
01:17:23,189 --> 01:17:23,199
roads because the cars because now you
 

4575
01:17:23,199 --> 01:17:25,590
roads because the cars because now you
can be super productive

4576
01:17:25,590 --> 01:17:25,600
can be super productive
 

4577
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:28,390
can be super productive
and so it no longer quite matters to you

4578
01:17:28,390 --> 01:17:28,400
and so it no longer quite matters to you
 

4579
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:30,390
and so it no longer quite matters to you
as much how long it takes to get from

4580
01:17:30,390 --> 01:17:30,400
as much how long it takes to get from
 

4581
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:31,910
as much how long it takes to get from
point a to point b

4582
01:17:31,910 --> 01:17:31,920
point a to point b
 

4583
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:34,229
point a to point b
because you're not wasting that time

4584
01:17:34,229 --> 01:17:34,239
because you're not wasting that time
 

4585
01:17:34,239 --> 01:17:37,110
because you're not wasting that time
you're just continue working yeah it's

4586
01:17:37,110 --> 01:17:37,120
you're just continue working yeah it's
 

4587
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:38,870
you're just continue working yeah it's
like public transit that comes to you

4588
01:17:38,870 --> 01:17:38,880
like public transit that comes to you
 

4589
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:39,990
like public transit that comes to you
exactly

4590
01:17:39,990 --> 01:17:40,000
exactly
 

4591
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:40,870
exactly
and

4592
01:17:40,870 --> 01:17:40,880
and
 

4593
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:43,030
and
so they there will be maybe less roads

4594
01:17:43,030 --> 01:17:43,040
so they there will be maybe less roads
 

4595
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:44,550
so they there will be maybe less roads
and bigger roads and it'll just change

4596
01:17:44,550 --> 01:17:44,560
and bigger roads and it'll just change
 

4597
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,790
and bigger roads and it'll just change
the nature of how we get from point a to

4598
01:17:46,790 --> 01:17:46,800
the nature of how we get from point a to
 

4599
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,550
the nature of how we get from point a to
point b i think you're right but that

4600
01:17:48,550 --> 01:17:48,560
point b i think you're right but that
 

4601
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:50,870
point b i think you're right but that
then couple that also with the fact that

4602
01:17:50,870 --> 01:17:50,880
then couple that also with the fact that
 

4603
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:53,350
then couple that also with the fact that
we seem to be more and more comfortable

4604
01:17:53,350 --> 01:17:53,360
we seem to be more and more comfortable
 

4605
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:55,910
we seem to be more and more comfortable
existing in the digital world yeah

4606
01:17:55,910 --> 01:17:55,920
existing in the digital world yeah
 

4607
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:57,590
existing in the digital world yeah
so like maybe we won't want to go

4608
01:17:57,590 --> 01:17:57,600
so like maybe we won't want to go
 

4609
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,430
so like maybe we won't want to go
outside more and more we'll just

4610
01:17:59,430 --> 01:17:59,440
outside more and more we'll just
 

4611
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:01,270
outside more and more we'll just
interact with each other virtually and i

4612
01:18:01,270 --> 01:18:01,280
interact with each other virtually and i
 

4613
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:03,590
interact with each other virtually and i
don't mean zoom meetings i mean just

4614
01:18:03,590 --> 01:18:03,600
don't mean zoom meetings i mean just
 

4615
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:05,270
don't mean zoom meetings i mean just
in other ways

4616
01:18:05,270 --> 01:18:05,280
in other ways
 

4617
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:07,910
in other ways
that's uh that's

4618
01:18:07,910 --> 01:18:07,920
that's uh that's
 

4619
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:09,510
that's uh that's
that's more fulfilling than a zoom

4620
01:18:09,510 --> 01:18:09,520
that's more fulfilling than a zoom
 

4621
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:11,590
that's more fulfilling than a zoom
meeting there's but then maybe not

4622
01:18:11,590 --> 01:18:11,600
meeting there's but then maybe not
 

4623
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,350
meeting there's but then maybe not
because like there's something deeply

4624
01:18:13,350 --> 01:18:13,360
because like there's something deeply
 

4625
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:15,430
because like there's something deeply
uncompelling about

4626
01:18:15,430 --> 01:18:15,440
uncompelling about
 

4627
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:17,430
uncompelling about
about zoom meetings like podcasts that

4628
01:18:17,430 --> 01:18:17,440
about zoom meetings like podcasts that
 

4629
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:19,750
about zoom meetings like podcasts that
are remote

4630
01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:19,760
are remote
 

4631
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:21,430
are remote
unless they're super information dense

4632
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:21,440
unless they're super information dense
 

4633
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:23,350
unless they're super information dense
at least to me as a podcast fan kind of

4634
01:18:23,350 --> 01:18:23,360
at least to me as a podcast fan kind of
 

4635
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:25,270
at least to me as a podcast fan kind of
suck they suck there's no connect it

4636
01:18:25,270 --> 01:18:25,280
suck they suck there's no connect it
 

4637
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:27,430
suck they suck there's no connect it
goes back to the dog thing with the zoom

4638
01:18:27,430 --> 01:18:27,440
goes back to the dog thing with the zoom
 

4639
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:28,790
goes back to the dog thing with the zoom
there's no connection

4640
01:18:28,790 --> 01:18:28,800
there's no connection
 

4641
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,550
there's no connection
yeah and we're not you know i i don't

4642
01:18:30,550 --> 01:18:30,560
yeah and we're not you know i i don't
 

4643
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:31,830
yeah and we're not you know i i don't
understand why they're we're not even

4644
01:18:31,830 --> 01:18:31,840
understand why they're we're not even
 

4645
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:33,990
understand why they're we're not even
making eye contact no it's but it's just

4646
01:18:33,990 --> 01:18:34,000
making eye contact no it's but it's just
 

4647
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,430
making eye contact no it's but it's just
something there it's in the room there's

4648
01:18:35,430 --> 01:18:35,440
something there it's in the room there's
 

4649
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:37,110
something there it's in the room there's
pheromones and that's like

4650
01:18:37,110 --> 01:18:37,120
pheromones and that's like
 

4651
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:39,030
pheromones and that's like
out of our understanding probably it's

4652
01:18:39,030 --> 01:18:39,040
out of our understanding probably it's
 

4653
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:41,350
out of our understanding probably it's
just some kind of weird biological

4654
01:18:41,350 --> 01:18:41,360
just some kind of weird biological
 

4655
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:42,709
just some kind of weird biological
you know you ever have cheerios in a

4656
01:18:42,709 --> 01:18:42,719
you know you ever have cheerios in a
 

4657
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:45,669
you know you ever have cheerios in a
bowl the cheerios tend to

4658
01:18:45,669 --> 01:18:45,679
bowl the cheerios tend to
 

4659
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:47,430
bowl the cheerios tend to
they tend to go together you see a

4660
01:18:47,430 --> 01:18:47,440
they tend to go together you see a
 

4661
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:49,030
they tend to go together you see a
cluster of cheerios they're never really

4662
01:18:49,030 --> 01:18:49,040
cluster of cheerios they're never really
 

4663
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:50,390
cluster of cheerios they're never really
hanging out on the other side and that's

4664
01:18:50,390 --> 01:18:50,400
hanging out on the other side and that's
 

4665
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:51,350
hanging out on the other side and that's
kind of how

4666
01:18:51,350 --> 01:18:51,360
kind of how
 

4667
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:53,510
kind of how
people are in the industry real life i

4668
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:53,520
people are in the industry real life i
 

4669
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:55,110
people are in the industry real life i
wonder what the physics of that is so

4670
01:18:55,110 --> 01:18:55,120
wonder what the physics of that is so
 

4671
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:57,270
wonder what the physics of that is so
they they come together and they stick

4672
01:18:57,270 --> 01:18:57,280
they they come together and they stick
 

4673
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:59,270
they they come together and they stick
especially with molecules yeah i don't

4674
01:18:59,270 --> 01:18:59,280
especially with molecules yeah i don't
 

4675
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:00,630
especially with molecules yeah i don't
know i camera what it was but it was

4676
01:19:00,630 --> 01:19:00,640
know i camera what it was but it was
 

4677
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:01,590
know i camera what it was but it was
fascinating and i think that's how

4678
01:19:01,590 --> 01:19:01,600
fascinating and i think that's how
 

4679
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:03,830
fascinating and i think that's how
people are and i think you try to write

4680
01:19:03,830 --> 01:19:03,840
people are and i think you try to write
 

4681
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:07,430
people are and i think you try to write
a tv show or or craft a movie with your

uh a
a male of the human species of the homo

4830
01:21:34,229 --> 01:21:34,239
a male of the human species of the homo
 

4831
01:21:34,239 --> 01:21:35,510
a male of the human species of the homo
sapien

4832

sapien
 

4833
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:38,790
sapien
uh produces 500 billion

4834
01:21:38,790 --> 01:21:38,800
uh produces 500 billion
 

4835
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:41,510
uh produces 500 billion
sperm cells in a lifetime

4836
01:21:41,510 --> 01:21:41,520
sperm cells in a lifetime
 

4837
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:43,669
sperm cells in a lifetime
so that's all

4838

uniquely genetically unique humans that
 

4845
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:52,629
uniquely genetically unique humans that
you could produce so even across those

4846
01:21:52,629 --> 01:21:52,639
you could produce so even across those
 

4847
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:55,430
you could produce so even across those
500 billion you can select

4848
01:21:55,430 --> 01:21:55,440
500 billion you can select
 

4849
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:57,669
500 billion you can select
and so i mean like abort some

4850
01:21:57,669 --> 01:21:57,679
and so i mean like abort some
 

4851
01:21:57,679 --> 01:21:59,990
and so i mean like abort some
or no you can choose which of them you

4852
01:21:59,990 --> 01:22:00,000
or no you can choose which of them you
 

4853
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,229
or no you can choose which of them you
want i mean just imagine all the genetic

4854
01:22:02,229 --> 01:22:02,239
want i mean just imagine all the genetic
 

4855
01:22:02,239 --> 01:22:04,149
want i mean just imagine all the genetic
possibilities that are there like all

4856
01:22:04,149 --> 01:22:04,159
possibilities that are there like all
 

4857
01:22:04,159 --> 01:22:06,790
possibilities that are there like all
the possible like you won

4858
01:22:06,790 --> 01:22:06,800
the possible like you won
 

4859
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:07,910
the possible like you won
the race

4860
01:22:07,910 --> 01:22:07,920
the race
 

4861
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:08,830
the race
yes

4862
01:22:08,830 --> 01:22:08,840
yes
 

4863
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:11,669
yes
uh shocking this is yeah this is the

4864
01:22:11,669 --> 01:22:11,679
uh shocking this is yeah this is the
 

4865
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:13,750
uh shocking this is yeah this is the
ball the 500 billion you have to imagine

4866
01:22:13,750 --> 01:22:13,760
ball the 500 billion you have to imagine
 

4867
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:17,430
ball the 500 billion you have to imagine
what the competition was oh just tards

4868
01:22:17,430 --> 01:22:17,440
what the competition was oh just tards
 

4869
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:19,830
what the competition was oh just tards
all day long handicap

4870
01:22:19,830 --> 01:22:19,840
all day long handicap
 

4871
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,990
all day long handicap
well so it's not actually the the

4872
01:22:21,990 --> 01:22:22,000
well so it's not actually the the
 

4873
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,709
well so it's not actually the the
fastest sperm or like it it's i think a

4874
01:22:24,709 --> 01:22:24,719
fastest sperm or like it it's i think a
 

4875
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:26,629
fastest sperm or like it it's i think a
lot of his timing and luck

4876
01:22:26,629 --> 01:22:26,639
lot of his timing and luck
 

4877
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:28,310
lot of his timing and luck
uh what it seems like there's actual

4878
01:22:28,310 --> 01:22:28,320
uh what it seems like there's actual
 

4879
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:30,149
uh what it seems like there's actual
papers on this and i've actually been

4880
01:22:30,149 --> 01:22:30,159
papers on this and i've actually been
 

4881
01:22:30,159 --> 01:22:32,310
papers on this and i've actually been
reading them i hope so so it's not just

4882
01:22:32,310 --> 01:22:32,320
reading them i hope so so it's not just
 

4883
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,470
reading them i hope so so it's not just
like the fastest sperm to the egg okay

4884
01:22:34,470 --> 01:22:34,480
like the fastest sperm to the egg okay
 

4885
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:36,229
like the fastest sperm to the egg okay
there's a timing thing

4886
01:22:36,229 --> 01:22:36,239
there's a timing thing
 

4887
01:22:36,239 --> 01:22:39,270
there's a timing thing
so you were just lucky all right i i

4888
01:22:39,270 --> 01:22:39,280
so you were just lucky all right i i
 

4889
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:41,110
so you were just lucky all right i i
believe that so it's interesting to

4890
01:22:41,110 --> 01:22:41,120
believe that so it's interesting to
 

4891
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:42,870
believe that so it's interesting to
think about like once you're able to

4892
01:22:42,870 --> 01:22:42,880
think about like once you're able to
 

4893
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:45,830
think about like once you're able to
specify

4894
01:22:45,830 --> 01:22:45,840

 

4895
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:47,910

some parameters of what your child is

4896
01:22:47,910 --> 01:22:47,920
some parameters of what your child is
 

4897
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:49,189
some parameters of what your child is
like

4898
01:22:49,189 --> 01:22:49,199
like
 

4899
01:22:49,199 --> 01:22:53,510
like
how that changes the nature of um

4900
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:53,520
how that changes the nature of um
 

4901
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:54,790
how that changes the nature of um
even just like

4902
01:22:54,790 --> 01:22:54,800
even just like
 

4903
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:57,030
even just like
the intimacy of two humans getting

4904
01:22:57,030 --> 01:22:57,040
the intimacy of two humans getting
 

4905
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:58,709
the intimacy of two humans getting
together

4906
01:22:58,709 --> 01:22:58,719
together
 

4907
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:00,310
together
and making

4908
01:23:00,310 --> 01:23:00,320
and making
 

4909
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:03,350
and making
creating together a child yeah i mean it

4910
01:23:03,350 --> 01:23:03,360
creating together a child yeah i mean it
 

4911
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:04,550
creating together a child yeah i mean it
changes it

4912
01:23:04,550 --> 01:23:04,560
changes it
 

4913
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:06,070
changes it
it's almost like uh i don't know it

4914
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:06,080
it's almost like uh i don't know it
 

4915
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:09,110
it's almost like uh i don't know it
becomes like a factory

4916
01:23:09,110 --> 01:23:09,120
becomes like a factory
 

4917
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:10,709
becomes like a factory
line of some kind

4918
01:23:10,709 --> 01:23:10,719
line of some kind
 

4919
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:13,110
line of some kind
if you don't meet naturally yeah if you

4920
01:23:13,110 --> 01:23:13,120
if you don't meet naturally yeah if you
 

4921
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:14,390
if you don't meet naturally yeah if you
don't mean natural

4922
01:23:14,390 --> 01:23:14,400
don't mean natural
 

4923
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:16,310
don't mean natural
and then you don't and you get you get

4924
01:23:16,310 --> 01:23:16,320
and then you don't and you get you get
 

4925
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:18,550
and then you don't and you get you get
to optimize your child

4926
01:23:18,550 --> 01:23:18,560
to optimize your child
 

4927
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:20,790
to optimize your child
then it's yeah then it's something like

4928
01:23:20,790 --> 01:23:20,800
then it's yeah then it's something like
 

4929
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,950
then it's yeah then it's something like
you have to consider utilitarian type of

4930
01:23:22,950 --> 01:23:22,960
you have to consider utilitarian type of
 

4931
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:23,990
you have to consider utilitarian type of
things like

4932
01:23:23,990 --> 01:23:24,000
things like
 

4933
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,750
things like
what's good for society and it'll

4934
01:23:25,750 --> 01:23:25,760
what's good for society and it'll
 

4935
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:27,669
what's good for society and it'll
probably be regulation about what kind

4936
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:27,679
probably be regulation about what kind
 

4937
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:29,669
probably be regulation about what kind
of children you can have or not like

4938
01:23:29,669 --> 01:23:29,679
of children you can have or not like
 

4939
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:31,990
of children you can have or not like
your child cannot have an iq below this

4940
01:23:31,990 --> 01:23:32,000
your child cannot have an iq below this
 

4941
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,229
your child cannot have an iq below this
or above us or something

4942
01:23:34,229 --> 01:23:34,239
or above us or something
 

4943

01:23:47,990 --> 01:23:48,000
yeah we do can't get on the roller
 

4957
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,750
yeah we do can't get on the roller
coaster if you're this short whatever it

4958
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:49,760
coaster if you're this short whatever it
 

4959
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:52,550
coaster if you're this short whatever it
is you know we do it in some capacity

4960
01:23:52,550 --> 01:23:52,560
is you know we do it in some capacity
 

4961
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:55,110
is you know we do it in some capacity
but here this would be like

4962
01:23:55,110 --> 01:23:55,120
but here this would be like
 

4963
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:56,950
but here this would be like
fully transparent

4964
01:23:56,950 --> 01:23:56,960
fully transparent
 

4965
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:59,189
fully transparent
and to a degree that uh it's hard to

4966
01:23:59,189 --> 01:23:59,199
and to a degree that uh it's hard to
 

4967
01:23:59,199 --> 01:24:01,830
and to a degree that uh it's hard to
imagine like the way we currently do it

4968
01:24:01,830 --> 01:24:01,840
imagine like the way we currently do it
 

4969
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:04,390
imagine like the way we currently do it
you can at least get around it yes you

4970

simple cell bacterial life like a one
 

6289
01:46:48,159 --> 01:46:50,470
simple cell bacterial life like a one
billion years in and then it started

6290
01:46:50,470 --> 01:46:50,480
billion years in and then it started
 

6291
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:52,950
billion years in and then it started
like having lots of

through natural selection there's just a
 

6303
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:06,310
through natural selection there's just a
whole evolutionary process of
