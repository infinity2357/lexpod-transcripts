know it's just a percentage we can't

as it stands today what would you say is

an accidental lab incident in Wuhan is

an accidental lab incident in Wuhan is
 

101
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,289
an accidental lab incident in Wuhan is
it 90 is it 65 percent I mean that's

00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:03,299
it 90 is it 65 percent I mean that's
 

103
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,929
it 90 is it 65 percent I mean that's
kind of arbitrary but when I stack up

kind of arbitrary but when I stack up

it on both sides is circumstantial it

kind of estimate is it possible to kind
 

121
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,089
kind of estimate is it possible to kind

of condense when you when you look at
 

123
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:31,970

the wall of evidence before you
 

125
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,150

where's your Source the the strongest
 

127
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,130
where's your Source the the strongest
source of your intuition yeah and I

00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:37,140
source of your intuition yeah and I
 

129
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,470
source of your intuition yeah and I
would have to say it's just logic and

130
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:39,480
would have to say it's just logic and
 

131
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,809
would have to say it's just logic and
deductive reasoning so before I make the

deductive reasoning so before I make the

137
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:48,470

it could be and still could be what we

00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:48,480
it could be and still could be what we

years and we they've been around for

162
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,040
years and we they've been around for
 

163
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,250
years and we they've been around for
such a long time because they are

164
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:19,260
such a long time because they are
 

165
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,110
such a long time because they are
adaptive and they're growing and they're

166
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:21,120
adaptive and they're growing and they're
 

167
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,869
adaptive and they're growing and they're
always changing and they're morphing and

168
00:03:23,869 --> 00:03:23,879
always changing and they're morphing and
 

169
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:26,869
always changing and they're morphing and
that's why viruses are I mean they've

170
00:03:26,869 --> 00:03:26,879
that's why viruses are I mean they've
 

171
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,030
that's why viruses are I mean they've
been very successful and we are are

172
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,040
been very successful and we are are
 

173
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,949
been very successful and we are are
victims sometimes we're beneficiaries we

174
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:30,959
victims sometimes we're beneficiaries we
 

175
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,309
victims sometimes we're beneficiaries we
have viral DNA has morphed into our our

176
00:03:34,309 --> 00:03:34,319
have viral DNA has morphed into our our
 

177
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,949
have viral DNA has morphed into our our
genomes but now certainly in the case of

178
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:36,959
genomes but now certainly in the case of
 

179
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,789
genomes but now certainly in the case of
covid-19 we are victims of the success

180
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:40,799
covid-19 we are victims of the success
 

181
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,390
covid-19 we are victims of the success
of viruses and so when we talk about a

182
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:44,400
of viruses and so when we talk about a
 

183
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,750
of viruses and so when we talk about a
backbone so the SARS cov2 virus

184
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:47,760
backbone so the SARS cov2 virus
 

185
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,630
backbone so the SARS cov2 virus
um has a it has a history and these

186
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:50,640
um has a it has a history and these
 

187
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,550
um has a it has a history and these
viruses don't come out of whole cloth

188
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:52,560
viruses don't come out of whole cloth
 

189
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,190
viruses don't come out of whole cloth
there are viruses that that morph and so

190
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:55,200
there are viruses that that morph and so
 

191
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,990
there are viruses that that morph and so
we know that at some period maybe 20

192
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,000
we know that at some period maybe 20
 

193
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,030
we know that at some period maybe 20
years ago or whatever

194
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:02,040
years ago or whatever
 

195
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,130
years ago or whatever
um the the the virus that is SARS cov2

196
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:06,140
um the the the virus that is SARS cov2
 

197
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:09,110
um the the the virus that is SARS cov2
existed in horseshoe bats it was a

198
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,120
existed in horseshoe bats it was a
 

199
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,890
existed in horseshoe bats it was a
horseshoe bat virus and it evolved

200
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:11,900
horseshoe bat virus and it evolved
 

201
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,809
horseshoe bat virus and it evolved
somewhere and there are some people who

202
00:04:14,809 --> 00:04:14,819
somewhere and there are some people who
 

203
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:17,270
somewhere and there are some people who
say there's no evidence of this but it's

204
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:17,280
say there's no evidence of this but it's
 

205
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,729
say there's no evidence of this but it's
a plausible Theory based on how things

206
00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:19,739
a plausible Theory based on how things
 

207
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:21,949
a plausible Theory based on how things
have happened in the past maybe that

208
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:21,959
have happened in the past maybe that
 

209
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,070
have happened in the past maybe that
virus jumped from the horseshoe bat

210
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:25,080
virus jumped from the horseshoe bat
 

211
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,350
virus jumped from the horseshoe bat
through some intermediate species so

212
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:27,360
through some intermediate species so
 

213
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,390
through some intermediate species so
it's like let's say there's a bat and

214
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:29,400
it's like let's say there's a bat and
 

215
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,850
it's like let's say there's a bat and
then it infects some other animal let's

216
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:31,860
then it infects some other animal let's
 

217
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,629
then it infects some other animal let's
say it's a pig or a raccoon dog or a

218
00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:35,639
say it's a pig or a raccoon dog or a
 

219
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,430
say it's a pig or a raccoon dog or a
civet cat they're all Pangolin they're

220
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:37,440
civet cat they're all Pangolin they're
 

221
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,350
civet cat they're all Pangolin they're
all sorts of animals that have been

222
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:39,360
all sorts of animals that have been
 

223
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,530
all sorts of animals that have been
considered and then that virus adapts

224
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:42,540
considered and then that virus adapts
 

225
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,110
considered and then that virus adapts
into that new host and it changes and

226
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,120
into that new host and it changes and
 

227
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,689
into that new host and it changes and
grows and then according to the

228
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:47,699
grows and then according to the
 

229
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:49,490
grows and then according to the
quote-unquote Natural Origins hypothesis

230
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:49,500
quote-unquote Natural Origins hypothesis
 

231
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,090
quote-unquote Natural Origins hypothesis
it jumps from that animal into humans

232
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:53,100
it jumps from that animal into humans
 

233
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,490
it jumps from that animal into humans
and so what you could imagine and some

234
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:55,500
and so what you could imagine and some
 

235
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,990
and so what you could imagine and some
of the people who are making the case

236
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:57,000
of the people who are making the case
 

237
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,189
of the people who are making the case
all of the people actually who are

238
00:04:58,189 --> 00:04:58,199
all of the people actually who are
 

239
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:00,230
all of the people actually who are
making the case for a natural origin of

240
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:00,240
making the case for a natural origin of
 

241
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,150
making the case for a natural origin of
the virus what they're saying is it went

242
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:02,160
the virus what they're saying is it went
 

243
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,330
the virus what they're saying is it went
from bat to some intermediate species

244
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:05,340
from bat to some intermediate species
 

245
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,850
from bat to some intermediate species
and then from that intermediate species

246
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:07,860
and then from that intermediate species
 

247
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,230
and then from that intermediate species
most likely there's some people who say

248
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:09,240
most likely there's some people who say
 

249
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,270
most likely there's some people who say
it went directly Back To Human but

250
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:11,280
it went directly Back To Human but
 

251
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,430
it went directly Back To Human but
through some intermediate species and

252
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:13,440
through some intermediate species and
 

253
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,430
through some intermediate species and
then humans interacted with that species

254
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:16,440
then humans interacted with that species
 

255
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,770
then humans interacted with that species
and then it jumped from that whatever it

256
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:18,780
and then it jumped from that whatever it
 

257
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,689
and then it jumped from that whatever it
is to to humans and that's a very

258
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:20,699
is to to humans and that's a very
 

259
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:22,550
is to to humans and that's a very
plausible Theory it's just that there's

260
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:22,560
plausible Theory it's just that there's
 

261
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,409
plausible Theory it's just that there's
no evidence for it and the nature of the

262
00:05:24,409 --> 00:05:24,419
no evidence for it and the nature of the
 

263
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:26,990
no evidence for it and the nature of the
interaction is do most people kind of

264
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:27,000
interaction is do most people kind of
 

265
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,230
interaction is do most people kind of
suggest that the like What markets so

266
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:30,240
suggest that the like What markets so
 

267
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,270
suggest that the like What markets so
the interaction with the humans the

268
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:32,280
the interaction with the humans the
 

269
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,490
the interaction with the humans the
animal is in the form of it's either a

270
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:34,500
animal is in the form of it's either a
 

271
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,409
animal is in the form of it's either a
live animal that's being sold to be

272
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:36,419
live animal that's being sold to be
 

273
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,950
live animal that's being sold to be
eaten or uh recently live animal but

274
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:39,960
eaten or uh recently live animal but
 

275
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,409
eaten or uh recently live animal but
newly dead animal being sold that's

276
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:42,419
newly dead animal being sold that's
 

277
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:45,950
newly dead animal being sold that's
certainly one very possible possibility

278
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:45,960
certainly one very possible possibility
 

279
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,390
certainly one very possible possibility
a possible possibility I don't know if

280
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:47,400
a possible possibility I don't know if
 

281
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,090
a possible possibility I don't know if
that's a word but the people who believe

282
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:50,100
that's a word but the people who believe
 

283
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,550
that's a word but the people who believe
in the wet Market origin that's what

284
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:52,560
in the wet Market origin that's what
 

285
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,230
in the wet Market origin that's what
they're saying so they had one of these

286
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:54,240
they're saying so they had one of these
 

287
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,870
they're saying so they had one of these
animals they were cutting it up let's

288
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:56,880
animals they were cutting it up let's
 

289
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,330
animals they were cutting it up let's
say in a market and maybe some of the

290
00:05:59,330 --> 00:05:59,340
say in a market and maybe some of the
 

291
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,850
say in a market and maybe some of the
blood got into somebody maybe had a cut

292
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:01,860
blood got into somebody maybe had a cut
 

293
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,290
blood got into somebody maybe had a cut
on their hand or maybe it was

294
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:03,300
on their hand or maybe it was
 

295
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,629
on their hand or maybe it was
aerosolized and so somebody breathed it

296
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:05,639
aerosolized and so somebody breathed it
 

297
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:08,689
aerosolized and so somebody breathed it
and then that virus found this new host

298
00:06:08,689 --> 00:06:08,699
and then that virus found this new host
 

299
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:11,990
and then that virus found this new host
and that was the the human host but you

300
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,000
and that was the the human host but you
 

301
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,270
and that was the the human host but you
could also have that happen in let's say

302
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:14,280
could also have that happen in let's say
 

303
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,390
could also have that happen in let's say
a farm so it's happened in the past that

304
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:17,400
a farm so it's happened in the past that
 

305
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,129
a farm so it's happened in the past that
let's say that there are farms and

306
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:19,139
let's say that there are farms and
 

307
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:21,950
let's say that there are farms and
because of human encroachment into Wild

308
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:21,960
because of human encroachment into Wild
 

309
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,070
because of human encroachment into Wild
Spaces we're pushing our our farms and

310
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:25,080
Spaces we're pushing our our farms and
 

311
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,350
Spaces we're pushing our our farms and
our Animal Farms further and further

312
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:27,360
our Animal Farms further and further
 

313
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,689
our Animal Farms further and further
into what used to be the the just

314
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:29,699
into what used to be the the just
 

315
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:32,150
into what used to be the the just
natural habitats and so it's happened in

316
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,160
natural habitats and so it's happened in
 

317
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,650
natural habitats and so it's happened in
the past for example that there were

318
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:33,660
the past for example that there were
 

319
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,409
the past for example that there were
bats roosting over pig pens and the bat

320
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:36,419
bats roosting over pig pens and the bat
 

321
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:39,350
bats roosting over pig pens and the bat
droppings went into the pig pens the

322
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:39,360
droppings went into the pig pens the
 

323
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,950
droppings went into the pig pens the
viruses in those droppings infected the

324
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:42,960
viruses in those droppings infected the
 

325
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,469
viruses in those droppings infected the
pigs and then the pigs infected the the

326
00:06:45,469 --> 00:06:45,479
pigs and then the pigs infected the the
 

327
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:47,150
pigs and then the pigs infected the the
humans and and that's why it's a

328
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:47,160
humans and and that's why it's a
 

329
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,730
humans and and that's why it's a
plausible Theory it's just that there's

330
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:49,740
plausible Theory it's just that there's
 

331
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,670
plausible Theory it's just that there's
basically no evidence for it if it was

332
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:52,680
basically no evidence for it if it was
 

333
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,450
basically no evidence for it if it was
the case that SARS cov2 comes from this

334
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:56,460
the case that SARS cov2 comes from this
 

335
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,070
the case that SARS cov2 comes from this
type of interaction

336
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,080
type of interaction
 

337
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,409
type of interaction
um as in most of the at least recent

338
00:07:00,409 --> 00:07:00,419
um as in most of the at least recent
 

339
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:03,170
um as in most of the at least recent
past outbreaks we'd see evidence of that

340
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:03,180
past outbreaks we'd see evidence of that
 

341
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,230
past outbreaks we'd see evidence of that
viruses are messy they're constantly

342
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:06,240
viruses are messy they're constantly
 

343
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,330
viruses are messy they're constantly
undergoing darwinian Evolution and

344
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:08,340
undergoing darwinian Evolution and
 

345
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,650
undergoing darwinian Evolution and
they're changing and it's not that

346
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:09,660
they're changing and it's not that
 

347
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,990
they're changing and it's not that
they're just ready for Prime Time ready

348
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,000
they're just ready for Prime Time ready
 

349
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,689
they're just ready for Prime Time ready
to infect humans on day one normally you

350
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:14,699
to infect humans on day one normally you
 

351
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:18,650
to infect humans on day one normally you
can trace the viral Evolution prior to

352
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:18,660
can trace the viral Evolution prior to
 

353
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,050
can trace the viral Evolution prior to
the time when it infects humans but for

00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:21,060
the time when it infects humans but for
 

355
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,350
the time when it infects humans but for
SARS cov2 it just showed up on the scene

356
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:24,360
SARS cov2 it just showed up on the scene
 

357
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,710
SARS cov2 it just showed up on the scene
ready to infect humans and there's no

00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:27,720
ready to infect humans and there's no
 

359
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,950

history that anybody has found so far of

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,589
history that anybody has found so far of

that kind of a viral Evolution with the
 

363
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,469
that kind of a viral Evolution with the
first SARS you could track it by the The

00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:36,479
first SARS you could track it by the The
 

365
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,890
first SARS you could track it by the The
genome sequencing that it was

366
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:38,900
genome sequencing that it was
 

367
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:43,070
genome sequencing that it was
experimenting and uh SARS cov2 was very

368
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:43,080
experimenting and uh SARS cov2 was very
 

369
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,589
experimenting and uh SARS cov2 was very
very stable and meaning it had already

00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:45,599
very stable and meaning it had already
 

371
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,890
very stable and meaning it had already
adapted to humans by the time it

00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:48,900
adapted to humans by the time it
 

373
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,350
adapted to humans by the time it
interacted with us fully adapted so with

SARS
 

377
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:55,790
SARS
there's a rapid Evolution when it like

378
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:55,800
there's a rapid Evolution when it like
 

379
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,730
there's a rapid Evolution when it like
first kind of hooks onto a human yeah

380
00:07:58,730 --> 00:07:58,740
first kind of hooks onto a human yeah
 

381
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,890
first kind of hooks onto a human yeah
because it's trying like a virus its

382
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:00,900
because it's trying like a virus its
 

383
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,050
because it's trying like a virus its
goal is to survive and replicate yeah no

384
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:03,060
goal is to survive and replicate yeah no
 

385
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,129
goal is to survive and replicate yeah no
it's true it's like oh we're going to

386
00:08:04,129 --> 00:08:04,139
it's true it's like oh we're going to
 

387
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:05,629
it's true it's like oh we're going to
try this oh that didn't work we'll try

388
00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:05,639
try this oh that didn't work we'll try
 

389
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:08,450
try this oh that didn't work we'll try
exactly like it like like a startup and

390
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:08,460
exactly like it like like a startup and
 

391
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,909
exactly like it like like a startup and
so we don't we don't see that and so

392
00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:10,919
so we don't we don't see that and so
 

393
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:12,770
so we don't we don't see that and so
there are some people who say why well

394
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:12,780
there are some people who say why well
 

395
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,710
there are some people who say why well
one hypothesis is are you have a totally

396
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:15,720
one hypothesis is are you have a totally
 

397
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,170
one hypothesis is are you have a totally
isolated group of humans maybe in in

398
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:18,180
isolated group of humans maybe in in
 

399
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,390
isolated group of humans maybe in in
southern China which is more than a

400
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:20,400
southern China which is more than a
 

401
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,969
southern China which is more than a
thousand miles away from uh from Wuhan

402
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:22,979
thousand miles away from uh from Wuhan
 

403
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:25,430
thousand miles away from uh from Wuhan
and maybe they're doing their animal

404
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:25,440
and maybe they're doing their animal
 

405
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,930
and maybe they're doing their animal
farming

406
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:26,940
farming
 

407
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,150
farming
um right next to these uh where these

408
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:29,160
um right next to these uh where these
 

409
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,309
um right next to these uh where these
areas where there are these horseshoe

410
00:08:31,309 --> 00:08:31,319
areas where there are these horseshoe
 

411
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:34,250
areas where there are these horseshoe
bats and maybe in this totally isolated

412
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:34,260
bats and maybe in this totally isolated
 

413
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,630
bats and maybe in this totally isolated
place that no one's ever heard of

414
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:35,640
place that no one's ever heard of
 

415
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,550
place that no one's ever heard of
they're not connected to any other place

416
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:37,560
they're not connected to any other place
 

417
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,329
they're not connected to any other place
one person gets infected and it doesn't

418
00:08:41,329 --> 00:08:41,339
one person gets infected and it doesn't
 

419
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:43,130
one person gets infected and it doesn't
spread to anybody else because they're

420
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:43,140
spread to anybody else because they're
 

421
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,710
spread to anybody else because they're
so isolated they're like I don't know I

422
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:45,720
so isolated they're like I don't know I
 

423
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,150
so isolated they're like I don't know I
mean I can't even imagine that this is

424
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:47,160
mean I can't even imagine that this is
 

425
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,030
mean I can't even imagine that this is
is the case then somebody gets in a car

426
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:50,040
is the case then somebody gets in a car
 

427
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,329
is the case then somebody gets in a car
and drives all night more than A

428
00:08:53,329 --> 00:08:53,339
and drives all night more than A

anyone and then that person goes
 

439
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,389
anyone and then that person goes
straight to the the juanan seafood

440
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:05,399
straight to the the juanan seafood
 

441
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,670
straight to the the juanan seafood
market according to this in my mind not

00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:07,680
market according to this in my mind not
 

443
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,970
market according to this in my mind not
very credible Theory and then unloads

444
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:10,980
very credible Theory and then unloads
 

445
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,590
very credible Theory and then unloads
his stuff and everybody gets infected

446
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:12,600
his stuff and everybody gets infected
 

447
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,690
his stuff and everybody gets infected
and they're only delivering those

448
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:14,700
and they're only delivering those
 

449
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,329
and they're only delivering those
animals to the Wuhan Market which

450
00:09:17,329 --> 00:09:17,339
animals to the Wuhan Market which
 

451
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:19,430
animals to the Wuhan Market which
doesn't even sell very many of these

452
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:19,440
doesn't even sell very many of these
 

453
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,170
doesn't even sell very many of these
kinds of animals that are likely

454
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:21,180
kinds of animals that are likely
 

455
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,030
kinds of animals that are likely

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,889
intermediate species and not anywhere
else so that's it's a little bit of a

458
00:09:24,889 --> 00:09:24,899
else so that's it's a little bit of a
 

459
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:26,930
else so that's it's a little bit of a
straw man

460
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:26,940
straw man
 

461
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,730
straw man
um but on top of that the Chinese have

462
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:28,740
um but on top of that the Chinese have
 

463
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,730
um but on top of that the Chinese have
sequenced more than 80 000 animal

00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:31,740
sequenced more than 80 000 animal
 

465
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,670
sequenced more than 80 000 animal

467
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,710

00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:36,720
type of a viral Evolution that we would

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,290
type of a viral Evolution that we would
otherwise expect Let's uh

470
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:39,300
otherwise expect Let's uh
 

471
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:43,250
otherwise expect Let's uh
try to at this moment steal man the

00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:43,260
try to at this moment steal man the

00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,650
try to at this moment steal man the

00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:45,660
argument for the natural origin of the
 

475
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,829
argument for the natural origin of the
virus so just uh to clarify

476
00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:48,839
virus so just uh to clarify
 

477
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,050
virus so just uh to clarify
so Wuhan is actually despite what it

478
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:51,060
so Wuhan is actually despite what it
 

479
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,910
so Wuhan is actually despite what it
might sound like to people is a pretty

480
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:52,920
might sound like to people is a pretty
 

481
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,769
might sound like to people is a pretty
big city there's a lot of people that

482
00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:54,779
big city there's a lot of people that
 

483
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:57,829
big city there's a lot of people that
live in it 11 million so not only is

484
00:09:57,829 --> 00:09:57,839
live in it 11 million so not only is
 

485
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,570
live in it 11 million so not only is
there the Wuhan Institute of virology

486
00:09:59,570 --> 00:09:59,580
there the Wuhan Institute of virology
 

487
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,630
there the Wuhan Institute of virology
there's other centers that do work on

488
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:02,640
there's other centers that do work on
 

489
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,750
there's other centers that do work on
viruses yes but there's also a giant

490
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:05,760
viruses yes but there's also a giant
 

491
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,370
viruses yes but there's also a giant
number of markets and everything we're

492
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:07,380
number of markets and everything we're
 

493
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,750
number of markets and everything we're
talking about here is pretty close

494
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:08,760
talking about here is pretty close
 

495
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,930
talking about here is pretty close
together so when I kind of look at the

496
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:11,940
together so when I kind of look at the
 

497
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,490
together so when I kind of look at the
geography of this

498
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:13,500
geography of this
 

499
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,009
geography of this
I think when you zoom out it's all Wuhan

500
00:10:16,009 --> 00:10:16,019
I think when you zoom out it's all Wuhan
 

501
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:18,350
I think when you zoom out it's all Wuhan
but when you zoom in there's just a lot

502
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:18,360
but when you zoom in there's just a lot
 

503
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,790
but when you zoom in there's just a lot
of interesting dynamics that could be

504
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:19,800
of interesting dynamics that could be
 

505
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,170
of interesting dynamics that could be
happening and where the cases are

506
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:21,180
happening and where the cases are
 

507
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,970
happening and where the cases are
popping up and what's being reported all

508
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:22,980
popping up and what's being reported all
 

509
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,050
popping up and what's being reported all
that kind of stuff

510
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:24,060
that kind of stuff
 

511
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,690
that kind of stuff
so I think the people that

512
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:26,700
so I think the people that
 

513
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,930
so I think the people that
argue for the natural origin and there's

514
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:29,940
argue for the natural origin and there's
 

515
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,150
argue for the natural origin and there's
a few recent papers that come out

516
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:32,160
a few recent papers that come out
 

517
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,769
a few recent papers that come out
arguing this

518
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:33,779
arguing this
 

519
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:35,389
arguing this
it's kind of fascinating to watch this

520
00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:35,399
it's kind of fascinating to watch this
 

521
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:36,530
it's kind of fascinating to watch this
whole thing but I think what they're

522
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:36,540
whole thing but I think what they're
 

523
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,269
whole thing but I think what they're
arguing is that there's this Hunan

524
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:38,279
arguing is that there's this Hunan
 

525
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:40,790
arguing is that there's this Hunan
Market that's one of the major markets

526
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:40,800
Market that's one of the major markets
 

527
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,430
Market that's one of the major markets
uh the wet markets in Wuhan

528
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:45,440
uh the wet markets in Wuhan
 

529
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,030
uh the wet markets in Wuhan
that uh there's a bunch of cases that

530
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:50,040
that uh there's a bunch of cases that
 

531
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,490
that uh there's a bunch of cases that
were reported from there

532
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:52,500
were reported from there
 

533
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,430
were reported from there
so if I look at for example the Michael

534
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:55,440
so if I look at for example the Michael
 

535
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,329
so if I look at for example the Michael
Warby perspective the hero in science he

536
00:10:59,329 --> 00:10:59,339
Warby perspective the hero in science he
 

537
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:02,569
Warby perspective the hero in science he
argues he wrote this a few days ago the

538
00:11:02,569 --> 00:11:02,579
argues he wrote this a few days ago the
 

539
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:05,090
argues he wrote this a few days ago the
the predominance of early covet cases

540
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:05,100
the predominance of early covet cases
 

541
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,490
the predominance of early covet cases
linked to Hunan market and this can't be

542
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:07,500
linked to Hunan market and this can't be
 

543
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,130
linked to Hunan market and this can't be
dismissed as ascertainment bias which I

544
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:10,140
dismissed as ascertainment bias which I
 

545
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,750
dismissed as ascertainment bias which I
think is what people argue that you're

546
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:11,760
think is what people argue that you're
 

547
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,430
think is what people argue that you're
just kind of focusing on this region

548
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:13,440
just kind of focusing on this region
 

549
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,810
just kind of focusing on this region
because a lot of cases came but there

550
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:14,820
because a lot of cases came but there
 

551
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,170
because a lot of cases came but there
could be a huge number of other cases

552
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:18,180
could be a huge number of other cases
 

553
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,210
could be a huge number of other cases
so people who argue against this say

554
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:20,220
so people who argue against this say
 

555
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,509
so people who argue against this say
that this is a later stage already right

556
00:11:23,509 --> 00:11:23,519
that this is a later stage already right
 

557
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,410
that this is a later stage already right
um

558
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:24,420
um
 

559
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:28,190
um
so he says no he says this is this is

560
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:28,200
so he says no he says this is this is
 

561
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,569
so he says no he says this is this is
the epicenter

562
00:11:29,569 --> 00:11:29,579
the epicenter
 

563
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:32,569
the epicenter
and uh this is a clear

564
00:11:32,569 --> 00:11:32,579
and uh this is a clear
 

565
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:35,810
and uh this is a clear
uh evidence that uh circumstantial

566
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:35,820
uh evidence that uh circumstantial
 

567
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,990
uh evidence that uh circumstantial
evidence but evidence nevertheless that

568
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:39,000
evidence but evidence nevertheless that
 

569
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,630
evidence but evidence nevertheless that
this is where the jump happened to

570
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:41,640
this is where the jump happened to
 

571
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,930
this is where the jump happened to
humans the big explosion maybe not k0 I

572
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:44,940
humans the big explosion maybe not k0 I
 

573
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,670
humans the big explosion maybe not k0 I
don't know if he argues that but with

574
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:46,680
don't know if he argues that but with
 

575
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,410
don't know if he argues that but with
the early cases so what do you make of

576
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:48,420
the early cases so what do you make of
 

577
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,389
the early cases so what do you make of
this whole idea Can you steal man it

578
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:50,399
this whole idea Can you steal man it
 

579
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,290
this whole idea Can you steal man it
yeah before yeah and my goal here isn't

580
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:54,300
yeah before yeah and my goal here isn't
 

581
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,030
yeah before yeah and my goal here isn't
to attack people on on the other side

582
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:56,040
to attack people on on the other side
 

583
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,610
to attack people on on the other side
and and if my feeling is if there is

584
00:11:58,610 --> 00:11:58,620
and and if my feeling is if there is
 

585
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,829
and and if my feeling is if there is
evidence that's presented

586
00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:00,839
evidence that's presented
 

587
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:03,350
evidence that's presented
um that that should change my view I I

588
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:03,360
um that that should change my view I I
 

589
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,389
um that that should change my view I I
hope that I'll be open-minded enough to

590
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:05,399
hope that I'll be open-minded enough to
 

591
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:07,370
hope that I'll be open-minded enough to
change my view and certainly Michael

592
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:07,380
change my view and certainly Michael
 

593
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,650
change my view and certainly Michael
Warby is a thoughtful person a

594
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:09,660
Warby is a thoughtful person a
 

595
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,509
Warby is a thoughtful person a
respectful a respected scientist and and

596
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:11,519
respectful a respected scientist and and
 

597
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,730
respectful a respected scientist and and
I think this work is is contributive

598
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:13,740
I think this work is is contributive
 

599
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,829
I think this work is is contributive
work but I just don't think

600
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:15,839
work but I just don't think
 

601
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,769
work but I just don't think
um uh that it it it that it's as

602
00:12:18,769 --> 00:12:18,779
um uh that it it it that it's as
 

603
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:22,009
um uh that it it it that it's as
significant as has been reported in in

604
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:22,019
significant as has been reported in in
 

605
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:25,069
significant as has been reported in in
the press and so what his argument is is

606
00:12:25,069 --> 00:12:25,079
the press and so what his argument is is
 

607
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:28,069
the press and so what his argument is is
that there is an early cluster in

608
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:28,079
that there is an early cluster in
 

609
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,150
that there is an early cluster in
December of 2019 around the the Juan on

610
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,160
December of 2019 around the the Juan on
 

611
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,730
December of 2019 around the the Juan on
seafood market and even though he

612
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:34,740
seafood market and even though he
 

613
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,930
seafood market and even though he
himself argues that the original break

614
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:38,940
himself argues that the original break
 

615
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,329
himself argues that the original break
through case the original case the index

616
00:12:41,329 --> 00:12:41,339
through case the original case the index
 

617
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:44,470
through case the original case the index
case where the first person infected

618
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:44,480
case where the first person infected
 

619
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,810
case where the first person infected
happened earlier happened in October or

620
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:47,820
happened earlier happened in October or
 

621
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,329
happened earlier happened in October or
November so not in December his argument

622
00:12:50,329 --> 00:12:50,339
November so not in December his argument
 

623
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:53,389
November so not in December his argument
is well what are the odds that you would

624
00:12:53,389 --> 00:12:53,399
is well what are the odds that you would
 

625
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:55,970
is well what are the odds that you would
have this number this cluster of cases

626
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:55,980
have this number this cluster of cases
 

627
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,610
have this number this cluster of cases
in the huanan seafood market and if the

628
00:12:58,610 --> 00:12:58,620
in the huanan seafood market and if the
 

629
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,190
in the huanan seafood market and if the
origin happened someplace else wouldn't

630
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:01,200
origin happened someplace else wouldn't
 

631
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,590
origin happened someplace else wouldn't
you expect other other clusters and it's

632
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:03,600
you expect other other clusters and it's
 

633
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,410
you expect other other clusters and it's
not an entirely implausible argument but

634
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:06,420
not an entirely implausible argument but
 

635
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,690
not an entirely implausible argument but
there are reasons why I think it's uh

636
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:08,700
there are reasons why I think it's uh
 

637
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,730
there are reasons why I think it's uh
that it's this is not nearly as

638
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:10,740
that it's this is not nearly as
 

639
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,129
that it's this is not nearly as
determinative as has been reported and I

640
00:13:13,129 --> 00:13:13,139
determinative as has been reported and I
 

641
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:15,110
determinative as has been reported and I
certainly had a lot of I and others had

642
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:15,120
certainly had a lot of I and others had
 

643
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,350
certainly had a lot of I and others had
tweeted a lot about this and that is

644
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:18,360
tweeted a lot about this and that is
 

645
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,990
tweeted a lot about this and that is
first uh the the people who were

646
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:21,000
first uh the the people who were
 

647
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,590
first uh the the people who were
infected in this cluster it's not the

648
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:24,600
infected in this cluster it's not the
 

649
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,530
infected in this cluster it's not the
earliest known uh virus of the SARS cov2

650
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:27,540
earliest known uh virus of the SARS cov2
 

651
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,750
earliest known uh virus of the SARS cov2
it began mutating so this is it's not

652
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:29,760
it began mutating so this is it's not
 

653
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,569
it began mutating so this is it's not
the original SARS cov2 there so you it

654
00:13:32,569 --> 00:13:32,579
the original SARS cov2 there so you it
 

655
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:34,970
the original SARS cov2 there so you it
had to have happened someplace else too

656
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:34,980
had to have happened someplace else too
 

657
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,490
had to have happened someplace else too
the people who were infected in the

658
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:37,500
the people who were infected in the
 

659
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,569
the people who were infected in the
market

660
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:38,579
market
 

661
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:40,730
market
um weren't infected in the part of the

662
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:40,740
um weren't infected in the part of the
 

663
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,250
um weren't infected in the part of the
market where they had these kinds of

664
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:43,260
market where they had these kinds of
 

665
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,750
market where they had these kinds of
animals that are considered to be

666
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:44,760
animals that are considered to be
 

667
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,069
animals that are considered to be
candidates

668
00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:46,079
candidates
 

669
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,230
candidates
um for as an intermari intermediary

670
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:48,240
um for as an intermari intermediary
 

671
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,470
um for as an intermari intermediary
species and third there was a bias

672
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:51,480
species and third there was a bias
 

673
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,389
species and third there was a bias
actually I'll have four things uh third

674
00:13:53,389 --> 00:13:53,399
actually I'll have four things uh third
 

675
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,170
actually I'll have four things uh third
there was a bias in the early assessment

676
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:57,180
there was a bias in the early assessment
 

677
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,389
there was a bias in the early assessment
in China of what what they were looking

678
00:13:59,389 --> 00:13:59,399
in China of what what they were looking
 

679
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:01,189
in China of what what they were looking
for they were asked did you have

680
00:14:01,189 --> 00:14:01,199
for they were asked did you have
 

681
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,750
for they were asked did you have
exposure to the market because I think

682
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:02,760
exposure to the market because I think
 

683
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,949
exposure to the market because I think
in the early days when people were

684
00:14:03,949 --> 00:14:03,959
in the early days when people were
 

685
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:06,050
in the early days when people were
figuring things out that was one of the

686
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:06,060
figuring things out that was one of the
 

687
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:09,050
figuring things out that was one of the
questions that uh that was asked and

688
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:09,060
questions that uh that was asked and
 

689
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,090
questions that uh that was asked and
fourth and probably most significantly

690
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:11,100
fourth and probably most significantly
 

691
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,810
fourth and probably most significantly
we have so little information about

692
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:14,820
we have so little information about
 

693
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,329
we have so little information about
those early cases in China and that's

694
00:14:17,329 --> 00:14:17,339
those early cases in China and that's
 

695
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:19,250
those early cases in China and that's
really unfortunate and we'll talk about

696
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:19,260
really unfortunate and we'll talk about
 

697
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,810
really unfortunate and we'll talk about
this later because the Chinese

698
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:20,820
this later because the Chinese
 

699
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,689
this later because the Chinese
government is preventing access to all

700
00:14:23,689 --> 00:14:23,699
government is preventing access to all
 

701
00:14:23,699 --> 00:14:25,970
government is preventing access to all
of that information which they have

702
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:25,980
of that information which they have
 

703
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,310
of that information which they have
which could easily help us get to the

704
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:28,320
which could easily help us get to the
 

705
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,350
which could easily help us get to the
bottom at least know a ton more about

706
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:30,360
bottom at least know a ton more about
 

707
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,509
bottom at least know a ton more about
how this pandemic started and so this is

708
00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:32,519
how this pandemic started and so this is
 

709
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:36,769
how this pandemic started and so this is
it it's like grasping at straws

710
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:36,779
it it's like grasping at straws
 

711
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:39,009
it it's like grasping at straws
in the dark with gloves on that's right

712
00:14:39,009 --> 00:14:39,019
in the dark with gloves on that's right
 

713
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:42,110
in the dark with gloves on that's right
but to steal man the argument we have

714
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:42,120
but to steal man the argument we have
 

715
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,129
but to steal man the argument we have
this evidence from this market and yes

716
00:14:46,129 --> 00:14:46,139
this evidence from this market and yes
 

717
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:47,930
this evidence from this market and yes
the Chinese government has turned off

718
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:47,940
the Chinese government has turned off
 

719
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,269
the Chinese government has turned off
the lights essentially so we have very

720
00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:50,279
the lights essentially so we have very
 

721
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:51,949
the lights essentially so we have very
little data to work with but this is the

722
00:14:51,949 --> 00:14:51,959
little data to work with but this is the
 

723
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:53,329
little data to work with but this is the
data we have

724
00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:53,339
data we have
 

725
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:55,910
data we have
so who's to say that this data doesn't

726
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:55,920
so who's to say that this data doesn't
 

727
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,389
so who's to say that this data doesn't
represent a much bigger data set that a

728
00:14:59,389 --> 00:14:59,399
represent a much bigger data set that a
 

729
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,949
represent a much bigger data set that a
lot of people got infected at this

730
00:15:00,949 --> 00:15:00,959
lot of people got infected at this
 

731
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,129
lot of people got infected at this
Market where it even at the parts or

732
00:15:04,129 --> 00:15:04,139
Market where it even at the parts or
 

733
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:05,750
Market where it even at the parts or
especially at the parts with the the

734
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:05,760
especially at the parts with the the
 

735
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,650
especially at the parts with the the
meat the infected meat was being sold so

736
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:09,660
meat the infected meat was being sold so
 

737
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:13,189
meat the infected meat was being sold so
that could be true and it probably is

738
00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:13,199
that could be true and it probably is
 

739
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,910
that could be true and it probably is
true the question is is this the source

740
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:16,920
true the question is is this the source
 

741
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,189
true the question is is this the source
is this the place where this began or

742
00:15:19,189 --> 00:15:19,199
is this the place where this began or
 

743
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,470
is this the place where this began or
was did this just a place where it was

744
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:21,480
was did this just a place where it was
 

745
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,629
was did this just a place where it was
Amplified and I certainly think that

746
00:15:23,629 --> 00:15:23,639
Amplified and I certainly think that
 

747
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:27,350
Amplified and I certainly think that
it's it's extremely likely that the Juan

748
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:27,360
it's it's extremely likely that the Juan
 

749
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,410
it's it's extremely likely that the Juan
on seafood market was an at point of

750
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:30,420
on seafood market was an at point of
 

751
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,090
on seafood market was an at point of
amplification and that's it's just

752
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:32,100
amplification and that's it's just
 

753
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,650
amplification and that's it's just
answering a different question basically

754
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:33,660
answering a different question basically
 

755
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,090
answering a different question basically
what you're saying is it's very

756
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:35,100
what you're saying is it's very
 

757
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,710
what you're saying is it's very
difficult to use the market as evidence

758
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:36,720
difficult to use the market as evidence
 

759
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,110
difficult to use the market as evidence
for anything

760
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:38,120
for anything
 

761
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,889
for anything
because

762
00:15:39,889 --> 00:15:39,899
because
 

763
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:42,230
because
it's probably not even the starting

764
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:42,240
it's probably not even the starting
 

765
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,689
it's probably not even the starting
point so it's just a good place for it

766
00:15:44,689 --> 00:15:44,699
point so it's just a good place for it
 

767
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:46,790
point so it's just a good place for it
to continue spreading that's certainly

768
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:46,800
to continue spreading that's certainly
 

769
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,329
to continue spreading that's certainly
my view what Michael warby's argument is

770
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:50,339
my view what Michael warby's argument is
 

771
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:52,790
my view what Michael warby's argument is
um is that well what are the odds of

772
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:52,800
um is that well what are the odds of
 

773
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,230
um is that well what are the odds of
that that we're seeing this

774
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:54,240
that that we're seeing this
 

775
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,329
that that we're seeing this
amplification at this particular in the

776
00:15:56,329 --> 00:15:56,339
amplification at this particular in the
 

777
00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:59,569
amplification at this particular in the
market and if we if let's let me put

778
00:15:59,569 --> 00:15:59,579
market and if we if let's let me put
 

779
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:01,910
market and if we if let's let me put
this way if we had all of the

780
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:01,920
this way if we had all of the
 

781
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,189
this way if we had all of the
information if if the Chinese government

782
00:16:04,189 --> 00:16:04,199
information if if the Chinese government
 

783
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:06,889
information if if the Chinese government
hadn't blocked access to all of this

784
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:06,899
hadn't blocked access to all of this
 

785
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,269
hadn't blocked access to all of this
because there's blood bank information

786
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:08,279
because there's blood bank information
 

787
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:11,470
because there's blood bank information
there's all sorts of information uh and

788
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:11,480
there's all sorts of information uh and
 

789
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,730
there's all sorts of information uh and
based on a full and complete

790
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:13,740
based on a full and complete
 

791
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,370
based on a full and complete
understanding we came to believe that

792
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:16,380
understanding we came to believe that
 

793
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,470
understanding we came to believe that
all of the early cases

794
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:18,480
all of the early cases
 

795
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,030
all of the early cases
um were at this Market I think that

796
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:20,040
um were at this Market I think that
 

797
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,269
um were at this Market I think that
would be a stronger argument than what

798
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:23,279
would be a stronger argument than what
 

799
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,009
would be a stronger argument than what
this is so far but everything leads to

800
00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:25,019
this is so far but everything leads to
 

801
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:27,470
this is so far but everything leads to
the fact that why is it that the Chinese

00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:27,480
the fact that why is it that the Chinese
 

803
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,590
the fact that why is it that the Chinese

00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:33,360
slow start the gold standard of doing
 

807
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,670
slow start the gold standard of doing
viral tracking for SARS one why have

808
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:37,680
viral tracking for SARS one why have
 

809
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,370
viral tracking for SARS one why have
they apparently done so little and

810
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:40,380
they apparently done so little and
 

811
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,009
they apparently done so little and
shared so little I think it asks it it

812
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:43,019
shared so little I think it asks it it
 

813
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:44,930
shared so little I think it asks it it
begs a lot of questions

814
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:44,940
begs a lot of questions
 

815
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,990
begs a lot of questions
okay so let's uh then talk about the

816

okay so let's uh then talk about the
 

817
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,749
okay so let's uh then talk about the
Chinese government uh let's there's

818
00:16:50,749 --> 00:16:50,759
Chinese government uh let's there's
 

819
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,970
Chinese government uh let's there's
several governments right so one is the

820
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:52,980
several governments right so one is the
 

821
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,430
several governments right so one is the
local government of Wuhan

822
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:55,440
local government of Wuhan
 

823
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,689
local government of Wuhan
and not just the Chinese government

824
00:16:56,689 --> 00:16:56,699
and not just the Chinese government
 

825
00:16:56,699 --> 00:16:58,670
and not just the Chinese government
let's talk about government

talk about planet Earth yeah no uh so
there's the Wuhan local government

834
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:08,220
there's the Wuhan local government
 

835
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,510
there's the Wuhan local government
there's the Chinese government uh led by

there's a potential catastrophic event
 

853
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,230
there's a potential catastrophic event
happening here and uh it's my ass

because I we there's incompetence all
 

857
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,850
because I we there's incompetence all
over the place the human nature is such

00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:40,860
over the place the human nature is such
 

859
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,169
over the place the human nature is such
that there's incompetence all over the

that there's incompetence all over the
 

861
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:43,610
that there's incompetence all over the
place and you're always trying to cover

862
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:43,620
place and you're always trying to cover
 

863
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:48,230
place and you're always trying to cover
it up and so so given that context

864
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:48,240
it up and so so given that context
 

865
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,549
it up and so so given that context
I want to lay out all the possible

866
00:17:51,549 --> 00:17:51,559
I want to lay out all the possible
 

867
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:53,570
I want to lay out all the possible
incompetence all the possible

868

873
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,850

all right where in your sense did the

874
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:04,860
all right where in your sense did the
 

875
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:09,110
all right where in your sense did the
cover-up start so uh there's this

876
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:09,120
cover-up start so uh there's this
 

877
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,029
cover-up start so uh there's this
suspicious

878
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:11,039
suspicious
 

879
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,810
suspicious
uh fact it seems like that the Wuhan

880
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:14,820
uh fact it seems like that the Wuhan
 

881
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,549

Institute of virology
 

883
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,909
Institute of virology
at a public database of thousands of uh

884
00:18:19,909 --> 00:18:19,919
at a public database of thousands of uh
 

885
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,490
at a public database of thousands of uh
sampled bad coronavirus sequences

886
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:22,500
sampled bad coronavirus sequences
 

887
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,210
sampled bad coronavirus sequences
and that went offline in September 2019.

888
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:26,220
and that went offline in September 2019.
 

889
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,070
and that went offline in September 2019.
what was that about

890
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:28,080
what was that about
 

891
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,710
what was that about
so let me talk about that specific and

892
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:30,720
so let me talk about that specific and
 

893
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,529
so let me talk about that specific and
then I'll also follow your path zooming

894
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:33,539
then I'll also follow your path zooming
 

895
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:34,970
then I'll also follow your path zooming
out and it's really important is that a

896
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:34,980
out and it's really important is that a
 

897
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,289
out and it's really important is that a
good start it's a great starting point

898
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:36,299
good start it's a great starting point
 

899
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:39,110
good start it's a great starting point
yeah yeah so but there's there's a a

900
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,120
yeah yeah so but there's there's a a
 

901
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,390
yeah yeah so but there's there's a a
bigger story and but let me talk about

902
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:41,400
bigger story and but let me talk about
 

903
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,510
bigger story and but let me talk about
about that so the Wuhan Institute of

904
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:44,520
about that so the Wuhan Institute of
 

905
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,130
about that so the Wuhan Institute of
virology

906
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:46,140
virology
 

907
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,870
virology
um and we can go into the whole history

908
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:47,880
um and we can go into the whole history
 

909
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,370
um and we can go into the whole history
of the Wuhan Institute of virology

910
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:49,380
of the Wuhan Institute of virology
 

911
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,810
of the Wuhan Institute of virology
either now or later because I think it's

912
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:50,820
either now or later because I think it's
 

913
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,490
either now or later because I think it's
it's very relevant to this story but

914
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:52,500
it's very relevant to this story but
 

915
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,010
it's very relevant to this story but
let's focus for now on this database

916
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:55,020
let's focus for now on this database
 

917
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:58,669
let's focus for now on this database
they had a database of 22

918
00:18:58,669 --> 00:18:58,679
they had a database of 22
 

919
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,130
they had a database of 22
000 viral samples and sequence

920
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:01,140
000 viral samples and sequence
 

921
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,289
000 viral samples and sequence
information about the viruses that they

922
00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:03,299
information about the viruses that they
 

923
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:06,650
information about the viruses that they
had had collected some of which the

924
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:06,660
had had collected some of which the
 

925
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,029
had had collected some of which the
collection of some of which was

926
00:19:08,029 --> 00:19:08,039
collection of some of which was
 

927
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:10,430
collection of some of which was
supported through funding from the NIH

928
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:10,440
supported through funding from the NIH
 

929
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,350
supported through funding from the NIH
not a huge NIH through the Eco Health

930
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:12,360
not a huge NIH through the Eco Health
 

931
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,510
not a huge NIH through the Eco Health
Alliance it's a relatively small amount

932
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:14,520
Alliance it's a relatively small amount
 

933
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,049
Alliance it's a relatively small amount
600 000 but but not nothing

934
00:19:18,049 --> 00:19:18,059
600 000 but but not nothing
 

935
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:20,990
600 000 but but not nothing
um the goal of this database

936
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:21,000
um the goal of this database
 

937
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,810
um the goal of this database
um was so that we could understand viral

938
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:23,820
um was so that we could understand viral
 

939
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,870
um was so that we could understand viral
Evolution so that exactly for this kind

940
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:26,880
Evolution so that exactly for this kind
 

941
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,630
Evolution so that exactly for this kind
of moment where we had an unknown virus

942
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:29,640
of moment where we had an unknown virus
 

943
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,850
of moment where we had an unknown virus
we could say well is this like anything

944
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:31,860
we could say well is this like anything
 

945
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,950
we could say well is this like anything
that we've seen before and that would

946
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:33,960
that we've seen before and that would
 

947
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,450
that we've seen before and that would
help us both understand what we're

948
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:35,460
help us both understand what we're
 

949
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,850
help us both understand what we're
facing and be better able um to to

950
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:37,860
facing and be better able um to to
 

951
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,289
facing and be better able um to to

whole a few months later the entire
 

963
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,409
whole a few months later the entire
database uh disappeared the Chinese have

964

said is that because there were all

966
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:00,419
said is that because there were all
 

967
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:02,630

kinds of computer attacks on this on
 

969
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,370
kinds of computer attacks on this on
this database but why would that happen

970
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:04,380
this database but why would that happen
 

971
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:08,870
this database but why would that happen
in September 2019 before the the

972
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:08,880
in September 2019 before the the
 

973
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,630
in September 2019 before the the
pandemic at least as far as as we know

government said
 

995
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,310
government said
that uh their database was getting

996
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:43,320
that uh their database was getting
 

997
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,750

hacked right
 

999
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,890
hacked right
therefore the director of this part of

00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:48,900
therefore the director of this part of
 

1001
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,450
therefore the director of this part of
the Wuhan Institute of virology said

1002
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:50,460
the Wuhan Institute of virology said
 

1003
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,210
the Wuhan Institute of virology said
that oh sh oh she was the one that said

1004
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:53,220
that oh sh oh she was the one that said
 

1005
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,770

1007
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,870
it she was the one who said oh yeah boy
I did not even know that part yeah okay

1008
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:56,880
I did not even know that part yeah okay
 

1009

so the excuse is that uh that's getting
 

1015
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,330
so the excuse is that uh that's getting
cyber attacked a lot so we're gonna take

1016
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:08,340
cyber attacked a lot so we're gonna take
 

1017
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,430
cyber attacked a lot so we're gonna take
it down without any further explanation

1018
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:10,440
it down without any further explanation
 

1019
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,529
it down without any further explanation
which seems very suspicious and then

1020
00:21:12,529 --> 00:21:12,539
which seems very suspicious and then
 

1021
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:16,610
which seems very suspicious and then
this virus starts to emerge in October

1022
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:16,620
this virus starts to emerge in October
 

1023

interrupt like but some people are
 

1029
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,850
interrupt like but some people are
saying that the first outbreak could

1030
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:22,860
saying that the first outbreak could
 

1031
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,430
saying that the first outbreak could
have happened as early as September I'm

1032

outbreak at least to somebody happened
 

1043
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:38,690
outbreak at least to somebody happened
in September they make the argument well

1044

in September they make the argument well
 

1045
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,789
in September they make the argument well
what if that also happened in

1046
00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:40,799
what if that also happened in
 

1047
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,890
what if that also happened in
mid-september of of 2019 I'm not

1048
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:42,900
mid-september of of 2019 I'm not
 

1049
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,450
mid-september of of 2019 I'm not
prepared to go there but there are some

prepared to go there but there are some
 

1051
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,710
prepared to go there but there are some
people who make that argument but I

1052
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:45,720
people who make that argument but I
 

1053
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,930
people who make that argument but I
think if again if I were to put myself

1054

think if again if I were to put myself
 

1055
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,690
think if again if I were to put myself
in the mind of officials whether it's

1056
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:50,700
in the mind of officials whether it's
 

1057
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,270
in the mind of officials whether it's
officials within the Wuhan Institute of

1058
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:53,280
officials within the Wuhan Institute of
 

1059
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,409
officials within the Wuhan Institute of
virology or Wuhan local officials

1060

virology or Wuhan local officials
 

1061
00:21:57,419 --> 00:22:01,190
virology or Wuhan local officials
um I think if I notice some major

1062

00:22:06,529 --> 00:22:06,539
some sign of
 

1067
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:08,990
some sign of
uh oh [\h__\h] was screwed up

1068
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:09,000
uh oh [\h__\h] was screwed up
 

1069
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,750

that's when you kind of uh do this slow

1070
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:11,760
that's when you kind of uh do this slow
 

1071
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,970
that's when you kind of uh do this slow
there's like a Homer Simpson meme where

1072
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:13,980
there's like a Homer Simpson meme where
 

1073
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,850
there's like a Homer Simpson meme where
you slowly start backing out and I would

1074
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:16,860
you slowly start backing out and I would
 

1075
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,490
you slowly start backing out and I would
probably start

1076
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:19,500
probably start
 

1077
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,669
probably start
um hiding stuff cya yeah yeah and then

1078
00:22:22,669 --> 00:22:22,679
um hiding stuff cya yeah yeah and then
 

1079
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:26,270
um hiding stuff cya yeah yeah and then
coming up with really shady excuses it's

1080
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:26,280
coming up with really shady excuses it's

if I give you my kind of macro view of

1096
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:43,080
if I give you my kind of macro view of
 

1097
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,590
if I give you my kind of macro view of
the whole information space and and why

1098
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:45,600
the whole information space and and why
 

1099
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,110
the whole information space and and why
I believe this has been so contentious

1100
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:48,120
I believe this has been so contentious
 

1101
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,110
I believe this has been so contentious
it's it's it's so here's here's if I had

it's it's it's so here's here's if I had
 

1103
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,330
it's it's it's so here's here's if I had
to give my best guess and I underlined

1104
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:53,340
to give my best guess and I underlined
 

1105
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,649
to give my best guess and I underlined
the word guess

1106
00:22:54,649 --> 00:22:54,659
the word guess
 

1107
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:57,350
the word guess
um of of what happened and and your

1108
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:57,360
um of of what happened and and your
 

1109
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,029
um of of what happened and and your
background your family background with

1110
00:22:59,029 --> 00:22:59,039
background your family background with
 

1111
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,070
background your family background with
Chernobyl I think is highly relevant

1112
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:01,080
Chernobyl I think is highly relevant
 

1113
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,970
Chernobyl I think is highly relevant
here

1114
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:01,980
here
 

1115
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,330
here
so after the first SARS there was a

1116
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:05,340
so after the first SARS there was a
 

1117
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,029
so after the first SARS there was a
recognition that we needed to distribute

1118
00:23:08,029 --> 00:23:08,039
recognition that we needed to distribute
 

1119
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:10,070
recognition that we needed to distribute
knowledge about virology and

1120
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:10,080
knowledge about virology and
 

1121
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,870
knowledge about virology and
epidemiology around the world that

1122
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:11,880
epidemiology around the world that
 

1123
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,210
epidemiology around the world that
people in China and Africa in Southeast

1124
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:14,220
people in China and Africa in Southeast
 

1125
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,070
people in China and Africa in Southeast
Asia they are were the front line

1126
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:16,080
Asia they are were the front line
 

1127
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,230
Asia they are were the front line
workers and they needed to be doing a

1128
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:18,240
workers and they needed to be doing a
 

1129
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,930
workers and they needed to be doing a
lot of the the viral monitoring and

1130
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:20,940
lot of the the viral monitoring and
 

1131
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,210
lot of the the viral monitoring and
assessment so that we could have an

1132
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:23,220
assessment so that we could have an
 

1133
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,549
assessment so that we could have an
early alarm system

1134
00:23:25,549 --> 00:23:25,559
early alarm system
 

1135
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:27,470
early alarm system
um and that was why there was a lot of

1136
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:27,480
um and that was why there was a lot of
 

1137
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,169
um and that was why there was a lot of
investment in in all of those places in

1138
00:23:30,169 --> 00:23:30,179
investment in in all of those places in
 

1139
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:31,789
investment in in all of those places in
building capacity and training people

1140
00:23:31,789 --> 00:23:31,799
building capacity and training people
 

1141
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:33,470
building capacity and training people
and helping to build institutional

1142
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:33,480
and helping to build institutional
 

1143
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:37,130
and helping to build institutional
capacity and the Chinese government they

1144
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:37,140
capacity and the Chinese government they
 

1145
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,649
capacity and the Chinese government they
recognized that they needed to ramp uh

1146
00:23:39,649 --> 00:23:39,659
recognized that they needed to ramp uh
 

1147
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:42,250
recognized that they needed to ramp uh
ramp things up and then the World Health

1148
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:42,260
ramp things up and then the World Health
 

1149
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,909
ramp things up and then the World Health
Organization in the world Health

1150
00:23:43,909 --> 00:23:43,919
Organization in the world Health
 

1151
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,010
Organization in the world Health
assembly they had their their

1152
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:46,020
assembly they had their their
 

1153
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,870
assembly they had their their
International Health regulations that

1154
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:47,880
International Health regulations that
 

1155
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,610
International Health regulations that
were designed to create a stronger

1156
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:49,620
were designed to create a stronger
 

1157
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,769
were designed to create a stronger
infrastructure so that was that was the

1158
00:23:51,769 --> 00:23:51,779
infrastructure so that was that was the
 

1159
00:23:51,779 --> 00:23:54,470
infrastructure so that was that was the
goal there were a lot of Investments and

1160
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:54,480
goal there were a lot of Investments and
 

1161
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,850
goal there were a lot of Investments and
and I know we'll talk later about the

1162
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:55,860
and I know we'll talk later about the
 

1163
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,409
and I know we'll talk later about the
Wuhan Institute of virology and I won't

1164
00:23:57,409 --> 00:23:57,419
Wuhan Institute of virology and I won't
 

1165
00:23:57,419 --> 00:23:59,690
Wuhan Institute of virology and I won't
go into that into that right now so

1166
00:23:59,690 --> 00:23:59,700
go into that into that right now so
 

1167
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,070
go into that into that right now so
there was all of this distributed

1168
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:01,080
there was all of this distributed
 

1169
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,390
there was all of this distributed
capacity

1170
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:02,400
capacity
 

1171
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,330
capacity
and so in the early days there's a

1172
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:05,340
and so in the early days there's a
 

1173
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:08,210
and so in the early days there's a
breakout in Wuhan we don't know is it

1174
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:08,220
breakout in Wuhan we don't know is it
 

1175
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:11,810
breakout in Wuhan we don't know is it
September October November uh maybe uh

1176
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:11,820
September October November uh maybe uh
 

1177
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,789
September October November uh maybe uh
December is when the the local

1178
00:24:13,789 --> 00:24:13,799
December is when the the local
 

1179
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:15,890
December is when the the local
authorities start to recognize that

1180
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:15,900
authorities start to recognize that
 

1181
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,330
authorities start to recognize that
something's happening but at some point

1182
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:17,340
something's happening but at some point
 

1183
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:21,230
something's happening but at some point
in late 2019 uh local officials in Wuhan

1184
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:21,240
in late 2019 uh local officials in Wuhan
 

1185
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,930
in late 2019 uh local officials in Wuhan
understand that something is up and

1186
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:23,940
understand that something is up and
 

1187
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,630
understand that something is up and
exactly like in Chernobyl these guys

1188
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:26,640
exactly like in Chernobyl these guys
 

1189
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,750
exactly like in Chernobyl these guys
exist within a hierarchical system and

1190
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:29,760
exist within a hierarchical system and
 

1191
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,730
exist within a hierarchical system and
they are going to be rewarded if good

1192
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:31,740
they are going to be rewarded if good
 

1193
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,529
they are going to be rewarded if good
things happen and they're going to be in

1194
00:24:33,529 --> 00:24:33,539
things happen and they're going to be in
 

1195
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:35,210
things happen and they're going to be in
big trouble if bad things happen under

1196
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:35,220
big trouble if bad things happen under
 

1197
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,169
big trouble if bad things happen under
their watch

1198
00:24:36,169 --> 00:24:36,179
their watch
 

1199
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:39,350
their watch
so their initial instinct is to squash

1200
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:39,360
so their initial instinct is to squash
 

1201
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,110
so their initial instinct is to squash
it uh it's and they my guess is they

1202
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:42,120
it uh it's and they my guess is they
 

1203
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,690
it uh it's and they my guess is they
think well if we squash this information

1204
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:43,700
think well if we squash this information
 

1205
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,730
think well if we squash this information
we can most likely beat back this

1206
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:46,740
we can most likely beat back this
 

1207
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,289
we can most likely beat back this
outbreak because lots of outbreaks

1208
00:24:48,289 --> 00:24:48,299
outbreak because lots of outbreaks
 

1209
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:51,230
outbreak because lots of outbreaks
happen all the time including of SARS

1210
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:51,240
happen all the time including of SARS
 

1211
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,090
happen all the time including of SARS
one where there was a multiple lab

1212
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:53,100
one where there was a multiple lab
 

1213
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,789
one where there was a multiple lab
incidents out of out of the lab in in

1214
00:24:55,789 --> 00:24:55,799
incidents out of out of the lab in in
 

1215
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:58,789
incidents out of out of the lab in in
Beijing and so they start their cover-up

1216
00:24:58,789 --> 00:24:58,799
Beijing and so they start their cover-up
 

1217
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,610
Beijing and so they start their cover-up
on day one they they start screening

1218
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:01,620
on day one they they start screening
 

1219
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:04,430
on day one they they start screening
social media they send nasty letters to

1220
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:04,440
social media they send nasty letters to
 

1221
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,950
social media they send nasty letters to
to different doctors and others who are

1222
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:06,960
to different doctors and others who are
 

1223
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,950
to different doctors and others who are
starting to speak up but then it becomes

1224
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:09,960
starting to speak up but then it becomes
 

1225
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,350
starting to speak up but then it becomes
clear that there's a bigger issue and

1226
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:12,360
clear that there's a bigger issue and
 

1227
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,570
clear that there's a bigger issue and
then the the national government of

1228
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:14,580
then the the national government of
 

1229
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:17,330
then the the national government of
China again this is just hypothesis

1230
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:17,340
China again this is just hypothesis
 

1231
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,669
China again this is just hypothesis
the national government gets involved

1232
00:25:19,669 --> 00:25:19,679
the national government gets involved
 

1233
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,169
the national government gets involved
they say all right this is getting much

1234
00:25:21,169 --> 00:25:21,179
they say all right this is getting much
 

1235
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:24,289
they say all right this is getting much
bigger they go in and they realize that

1236
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:24,299
bigger they go in and they realize that
 

1237
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:26,750
bigger they go in and they realize that
we have a big problem on our hands they

1238
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:26,760
we have a big problem on our hands they
 

1239
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,789
we have a big problem on our hands they
relatively quickly know that it's

1240
00:25:28,789 --> 00:25:28,799
relatively quickly know that it's
 

1241
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,370
relatively quickly know that it's
spreading human to human and so the

1242
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:31,380
spreading human to human and so the
 

1243
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,230
spreading human to human and so the
right thing for them to do then is what

1244
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:33,240
right thing for them to do then is what
 

1245
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,970
right thing for them to do then is what
the South African government is doing

1246
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:34,980
the South African government is doing
 

1247
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:38,090
the South African government is doing
now is to say we have this outbreak we

1248
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:38,100
now is to say we have this outbreak we
 

1249
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,590
now is to say we have this outbreak we
don't know everything but we know it's

1250
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:39,600
don't know everything but we know it's
 

1251
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,850
don't know everything but we know it's
serious

1252
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:40,860
serious
 

1253
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,649
serious
um we need help but that's not the

1254
00:25:42,649 --> 00:25:42,659
um we need help but that's not the
 

1255
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:44,269
um we need help but that's not the
Instinct of people in in most

1256
00:25:44,269 --> 00:25:44,279
Instinct of people in in most
 

1257
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:45,769
Instinct of people in in most
governments and certainly not in

1258
00:25:45,769 --> 00:25:45,779
governments and certainly not in
 

1259
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:48,169
governments and certainly not in
authoritarian governments like China

1260
00:25:48,169 --> 00:25:48,179
authoritarian governments like China
 

1261
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:51,350
authoritarian governments like China
and so the the national government they

1262
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:51,360
and so the the national government they
 

1263
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,750
and so the the national government they
have a choice at that point they can do

1264
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:53,760
have a choice at that point they can do
 

1265
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,269
have a choice at that point they can do

then at day four someone would say why
 

1415
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,010

the habit here's what Trump said and
 

1423
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,149
the habit here's what Trump said and
here's why it's wrong it's very

1424
00:29:17,149 --> 00:29:17,159
here's why it's wrong it's very
 

1425
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:18,649
here's why it's wrong it's very
complicated

1426
00:29:18,649 --> 00:29:18,659
complicated
 

1427
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:21,289
complicated
to figure out what is the role of a

1428
00:29:21,289 --> 00:29:21,299
to figure out what is the role of a
 

1429
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:22,909
to figure out what is the role of a
politician what is the role of a leader

in this kind of game of politics but

00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:26,100
in this kind of game of politics but
 

1433
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,630
in this kind of game of politics but
certainly in um when there's a tragedy

1434
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:29,640
certainly in um when there's a tragedy
 

1435
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,090
certainly in um when there's a tragedy
when there's a catastrophic event

1436
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:32,100
when there's a catastrophic event
 

1437
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,789
when there's a catastrophic event
what it takes to be a leader is to see

1438
00:29:34,789 --> 00:29:34,799
what it takes to be a leader is to see
 

1439
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,730
what it takes to be a leader is to see
clearly through the fog and to make big

1440
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:37,740
clearly through the fog and to make big
 

1441
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:40,250
clearly through the fog and to make big
bold decisions and to speak to the truth

1442
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:40,260
bold decisions and to speak to the truth
 

1443
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,649
bold decisions and to speak to the truth
of things and even if it's unpopular

1444
00:29:42,649 --> 00:29:42,659
of things and even if it's unpopular
 

1445
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:43,750
of things and even if it's unpopular
truth

1446
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:43,760

1455
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,710
the [\h__\h] all the political [\h__\h]
and just

1456
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:57,720
and just
 

1457
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,350
and just
speak to the people speak to the world

1458
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:00,360
speak to the people speak to the world
 

1459

1460
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:03,000
and make bold big decisions that that's
 

1461
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,430
and make bold big decisions that that's
probably what was needed in terms of

1462
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:04,440
probably what was needed in terms of
 

1463
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,649
probably what was needed in terms of
leadership and I'm not so willing to

1464
00:30:06,649 --> 00:30:06,659
leadership and I'm not so willing to
 

1465
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:09,649
leadership and I'm not so willing to
criticize whether it's Joe Biden or

1466
00:30:09,649 --> 00:30:09,659
criticize whether it's Joe Biden or
 

1467
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:13,789
criticize whether it's Joe Biden or
Donald Trump on this I think most people

1468
00:30:13,789 --> 00:30:13,799
Donald Trump on this I think most people
 

1469
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:16,549
Donald Trump on this I think most people
cannot be great leaders but that's why

1470
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:16,559
cannot be great leaders but that's why
 

1471
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,310
cannot be great leaders but that's why
when great leaders step up we write

1472
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:19,320
when great leaders step up we write
 

1473
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,230
when great leaders step up we write
books about them yeah and I and I agree

1474
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:21,240
books about them yeah and I and I agree
 

1475
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,409
books about them yeah and I and I agree
and and even though I mean I I think of

1476
00:30:24,409 --> 00:30:24,419
and and even though I mean I I think of
 

1477
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:26,570
and and even though I mean I I think of
myself as a progressive person I

1478
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:26,580
myself as a progressive person I
 

1479
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:29,389
myself as a progressive person I
certainly was a Critic of a lot of of

1480
00:30:29,389 --> 00:30:29,399
certainly was a Critic of a lot of of
 

1481
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:33,230
certainly was a Critic of a lot of of
what uh president Trump did

1482
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:33,240
what uh president Trump did
 

1483
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,769
what uh president Trump did
but on this particular case even though

1484
00:30:36,769 --> 00:30:36,779
but on this particular case even though
 

1485
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:39,010
but on this particular case even though
he may have said it in an uncouth way

1486
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:39,020
he may have said it in an uncouth way
 

1487
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:42,830
he may have said it in an uncouth way
Donald Trump was actually in my view

1488
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:42,840
Donald Trump was actually in my view
 

1489
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,769
Donald Trump was actually in my view
right I mean when he said hey let's look

1490
00:30:45,769 --> 00:30:45,779
right I mean when he said hey let's look
 

1491
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:48,169
right I mean when he said hey let's look
at this lab he said I have evidence I

1492
00:30:48,169 --> 00:30:48,179
at this lab he said I have evidence I
 

1493
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,850
at this lab he said I have evidence I
can't tell you I don't think he even had

1494
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:49,860
can't tell you I don't think he even had
 

1495
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:53,149
can't tell you I don't think he even had
the evidence but his intuition that this

1496
00:30:53,149 --> 00:30:53,159
the evidence but his intuition that this
 

1497
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:56,450
the evidence but his intuition that this
probably comes from a lab in my view was

1498
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:56,460
probably comes from a lab in my view was
 

1499
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:59,210
probably comes from a lab in my view was
a correct intuition and certainly I

1500
00:30:59,210 --> 00:30:59,220
a correct intuition and certainly I
 

1501
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,830
a correct intuition and certainly I

the Chinese governments to build a the
 

1577
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,830
the Chinese governments to build a the
largest bsl4 lab so biosafety level four

1578
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:39,840
largest bsl4 lab so biosafety level four
 

1579
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,389
largest bsl4 lab so biosafety level four
so in these what are called high

1580
00:32:41,389 --> 00:32:41,399
so in these what are called high
 

1581
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:43,130
so in these what are called high
containment Labs there's level four

1582
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:43,140
containment Labs there's level four
 

1583
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,750
containment Labs there's level four
which is the highest level and people

1584
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:44,760
which is the highest level and people
 

1585
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,210
which is the highest level and people
have seen that and on TV and elsewhere

1586
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:47,220
have seen that and on TV and elsewhere
 

1587
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,610
have seen that and on TV and elsewhere
where you have the the people in the

1588
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:49,620
where you have the the people in the
 

1589
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,409
where you have the the people in the
different in suits and all of these

1590
00:32:51,409 --> 00:32:51,419
different in suits and all of these
 

1591
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:53,210
different in suits and all of these
protections and then there's level three

1592
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:53,220
protections and then there's level three
 

1593
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:56,870
protections and then there's level three
which is still very serious uh and uh

1594
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:56,880
which is still very serious uh and uh
 

1595
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,909
which is still very serious uh and uh
but not as much as as level four and

1596
00:32:58,909 --> 00:32:58,919
but not as much as as level four and
 

1597
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:02,269
but not as much as as level four and
then level 2 is just kind of goggles and

1598
00:33:02,269 --> 00:33:02,279
then level 2 is just kind of goggles and
 

1599
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:04,549
then level 2 is just kind of goggles and
and some gloves and maybe that and maybe

1600
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:04,559
and some gloves and maybe that and maybe
 

1601
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,370
and some gloves and maybe that and maybe
a face mask much less so the French and

1602
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:07,380
a face mask much less so the French and
 

1603
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,250
a face mask much less so the French and
the Chinese governments

1604
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:09,260
the Chinese governments
 

1605
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:13,009
the Chinese governments
agreed that France would help build the

1606
00:33:13,009 --> 00:33:13,019
agreed that France would help build the
 

1607
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:17,330
agreed that France would help build the
first and and still the largest bsl4

1608
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:17,340
first and and still the largest bsl4
 

1609
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:20,509
first and and still the largest bsl4
plus some mobile bsl3 labs and they were

1610
00:33:20,509 --> 00:33:20,519
plus some mobile bsl3 labs and they were
 

1611
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:23,090
plus some mobile bsl3 labs and they were
going to do it in Wuhan and Wuhan is

1612
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:23,100
going to do it in Wuhan and Wuhan is
 

1613
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,430
going to do it in Wuhan and Wuhan is
kind of like China's Chicago and I had

1614
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:25,440
kind of like China's Chicago and I had

actually been it's a different story I'd
been in Wuhan relatively not that long

1618
00:33:30,649 --> 00:33:30,659
been in Wuhan relatively not that long

conditions where a leak is is possible
 

1795
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,109
conditions where a leak is is possible
and so then you mentioned shujang Li and

1796
00:37:06,109 --> 00:37:06,119
and so then you mentioned shujang Li and
 

1797
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:08,089
and so then you mentioned shujang Li and
I'll connect that to the these

1798
00:37:08,089 --> 00:37:08,099
I'll connect that to the these
 

1799
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:10,250
I'll connect that to the these
virologists who I was was was talking

1800
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:10,260
virologists who I was was was talking
 

1801
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:13,849
virologists who I was was was talking
about so there's a very credible thesis

1802
00:37:13,849 --> 00:37:13,859
about so there's a very credible thesis
 

1803
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:15,490
about so there's a very credible thesis
that because

1804
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:15,500
that because
 

1805
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,230
that because
these pathogenic outbreaks happen in

1806
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:18,240
these pathogenic outbreaks happen in
 

1807
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,210
these pathogenic outbreaks happen in
other parts of the world having

1808
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:20,220
other parts of the world having
 

1809
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:23,089
other parts of the world having
Partnerships with experts in those parts

1810
00:37:23,089 --> 00:37:23,099
Partnerships with experts in those parts
 

1811
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:26,089
Partnerships with experts in those parts
in those parts of the world must be a

1812
00:37:26,089 --> 00:37:26,099
in those parts of the world must be a
 

1813
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:28,370
in those parts of the world must be a
foundation of our of our efforts we

1814
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:28,380
foundation of our of our efforts we
 

1815
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,349
foundation of our of our efforts we
can't just bring everything home because

1816
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:30,359
can't just bring everything home because
 

1817
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:32,150
can't just bring everything home because
we know that that viruses don't care

1818
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:32,160
we know that that viruses don't care
 

1819
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,190
we know that that viruses don't care
about borders and boundaries and so if

1820
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:34,200
about borders and boundaries and so if
 

1821
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,750
about borders and boundaries and so if
something happens there it's going to

1822
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:35,760
something happens there it's going to
 

1823
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,650
something happens there it's going to
come here so very correctly and we have

1824
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:39,660
come here so very correctly and we have
 

1825
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,829
come here so very correctly and we have
all kinds of Partnerships with experts

1826
00:37:42,829 --> 00:37:42,839
all kinds of Partnerships with experts
 

1827
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:46,670
all kinds of Partnerships with experts
in in these labs and shujang Lee was one

1828
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:46,680
in in these labs and shujang Lee was one
 

1829
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,710
in in these labs and shujang Lee was one
of those partners and her closest

1830
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:48,720
of those partners and her closest
 

1831
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,829
of those partners and her closest
relationship was with Peter dazek who's

1832
00:37:51,829 --> 00:37:51,839
relationship was with Peter dazek who's
 

1833
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:54,530
relationship was with Peter dazek who's
a British I think now American but the

1834
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:54,540
a British I think now American but the
 

1835
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:57,050
a British I think now American but the
the president of a thing called Eco

1836
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:57,060
the president of a thing called Eco
 

1837
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,550
the president of a thing called Eco
Health Alliance which was getting money

1838
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:58,560
Health Alliance which was getting money
 

1839
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,130
Health Alliance which was getting money
from NIH and basically Eco Health

1840
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:01,140
from NIH and basically Eco Health
 

1841
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,410
from NIH and basically Eco Health
Alliance was a pass-through organization

1842
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:03,420
Alliance was a pass-through organization
 

1843
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,210
Alliance was a pass-through organization
and and you know over the years it was

1844
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:05,220
and and you know over the years it was
 

1845
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,710
and and you know over the years it was
only about six hundred thousand dollars

1846
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:06,720
only about six hundred thousand dollars
 

1847
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,510
only about six hundred thousand dollars
so almost all of her funding came from

1848
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:08,520
so almost all of her funding came from
 

1849
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,770
so almost all of her funding came from
the Chinese government but there's a

1850
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:09,780
the Chinese government but there's a
 

1851
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:10,970
the Chinese government but there's a
little bit that came from the United

1852
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:10,980
little bit that came from the United
 

1853
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:14,450
little bit that came from the United
States and so she became their kind of

1854
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:14,460
States and so she became their kind of
 

1855
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,790
States and so she became their kind of
leading expert and the the point of

1856
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:16,800
leading expert and the the point of
 

1857
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,310
leading expert and the the point of
contact between the Wuhan Institute of

1858
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:19,320
contact between the Wuhan Institute of
 

1859
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:23,030
contact between the Wuhan Institute of
virology and certainly Peter dazick but

1860
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:23,040
virology and certainly Peter dazick but
 

1861
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,450
virology and certainly Peter dazick but
also uh also with with others and that

1862
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:26,460
also uh also with with others and that
 

1863
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,550
also uh also with with others and that
was why in the earliest days of the

1864
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:28,560
was why in the earliest days of the
 

1865
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,950
was why in the earliest days of the
outbreak I didn't mention that um I did

1866
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:30,960
outbreak I didn't mention that um I did
 

1867
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,390
outbreak I didn't mention that um I did
mention that there were these

1868
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:32,400
mention that there were these
 

1869
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,609
mention that there were these
virologists who had this fake certainty

1870
00:38:34,609 --> 00:38:34,619
virologists who had this fake certainty
 

1871
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:37,069
virologists who had this fake certainty
that they knew it came from nature and

1872
00:38:37,069 --> 00:38:37,079
that they knew it came from nature and
 

1873
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:39,230
that they knew it came from nature and
it didn't come from a lab and they

1874
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:39,240
it didn't come from a lab and they
 

1875
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,910
it didn't come from a lab and they
called people like me conspiracy

1876
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:40,920
called people like me conspiracy
 

1877
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,710
called people like me conspiracy
theorists just for raising that that

1878
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:42,720
theorists just for raising that that
 

1879
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,589
theorists just for raising that that
possibility but when Peter dazek was

1880
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:45,599
possibility but when Peter dazek was
 

1881
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,829
possibility but when Peter dazek was
organizing that effort in February of

1882

organizing that effort in February of
 

1883
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:52,490

00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:52,500
2020 what he said is we need to Rally
 

1885

behind our Chinese colleagues and that
 

1887
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:56,690
behind our Chinese colleagues and that
the basic idea was

1888
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:56,700
the basic idea was
 

1889
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,609
the basic idea was
um these International collaborations

1890
00:38:58,609 --> 00:38:58,619
um these International collaborations
 

1891
00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:00,589
um these International collaborations
are under threat and I think it was

1892
00:39:00,589 --> 00:39:00,599
are under threat and I think it was
 

1893
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:03,109
are under threat and I think it was
because of that because Peter dazek's

1894
00:39:03,109 --> 00:39:03,119
because of that because Peter dazek's
 

1895
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,710
because of that because Peter dazek's
basically his his major contribution as

1896
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:06,720
basically his his major contribution as
 

1897
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,470
basically his his major contribution as
a scientist was just tacking his name on

1898
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:09,480
a scientist was just tacking his name on
 

1899
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,069
a scientist was just tacking his name on
work that xujang Lee had largely done

1900
00:39:13,069 --> 00:39:13,079
work that xujang Lee had largely done
 

1901
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:15,170
work that xujang Lee had largely done
um he was defending a lot certainly for

1902
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:15,180
um he was defending a lot certainly for
 

1903
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,690
um he was defending a lot certainly for
himself and his organization so you

1904
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:17,700
himself and his organization so you
 

1905
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:21,050
himself and his organization so you
think equal Health Alliance and Peter is

1906
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:21,060
think equal Health Alliance and Peter is
 

1907
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:23,750
think equal Health Alliance and Peter is
less about money it's more about kind of

1908
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:23,760
less about money it's more about kind of
 

1909
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,430
less about money it's more about kind of
um almost like Legacy because you're so

1910
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:25,440
um almost like Legacy because you're so
 

1911
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,650
um almost like Legacy because you're so
attached to this work it's just not a

1912
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:27,660
attached to this work it's just not a
 

1913
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,870
attached to this work it's just not a
human life so I I think so I mean I've

1914
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:29,880
human life so I I think so I mean I've
 

1915
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,910
human life so I I think so I mean I've
been criticized for being actually I'm

1916
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:31,920
been criticized for being actually I'm
 

1917
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,430
been criticized for being actually I'm
certainly a big critic of Peter daisig

1918
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:34,440
certainly a big critic of Peter daisig
 

1919
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,130
certainly a big critic of Peter daisig
but I've been criticized by some for

1920
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:37,140
but I've been criticized by some for
 

1921
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:39,890
but I've been criticized by some for
being too lenient I mean it's so easy to

1922
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:39,900
being too lenient I mean it's so easy to
 

1923
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,530
being too lenient I mean it's so easy to
say oh somebody they're like an evil

1924
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:42,540
say oh somebody they're like an evil
 

1925
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:46,130
say oh somebody they're like an evil
ogre and just trying to do evil and and

1926
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:46,140
ogre and just trying to do evil and and
 

1927
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:49,010
ogre and just trying to do evil and and
cackling in their in their closet or

1928
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:49,020
cackling in their in their closet or
 

1929
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,650
cackling in their in their closet or
whatever but I think for most of us even

1930
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:51,660
whatever but I think for most of us even
 

1931
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:54,349
whatever but I think for most of us even
those of us who do terrible horrible

1932
00:39:54,349 --> 00:39:54,359
those of us who do terrible horrible
 

1933
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:57,410
those of us who do terrible horrible
things the story that we tell ourselves

1934
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:57,420
things the story that we tell ourselves
 

1935
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,930
things the story that we tell ourselves
and we really believe is that we're

1936
00:39:59,930 --> 00:39:59,940
and we really believe is that we're
 

1937
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,569
and we really believe is that we're
doing the thing that we most believe in

1938
00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:02,579
doing the thing that we most believe in
 

1939
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:04,970
doing the thing that we most believe in
I mean I did my PhD dissertation on the

1940
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:04,980
I mean I did my PhD dissertation on the
 

1941
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:08,210
I mean I did my PhD dissertation on the
Khmer Rouge in Cambodia they genuinely

1942
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:08,220
Khmer Rouge in Cambodia they genuinely
 

1943
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,430
Khmer Rouge in Cambodia they genuinely
saw themselves as idealists they they

1944
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:10,440
saw themselves as idealists they they
 

1945
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,370
saw themselves as idealists they they
thought well we need to make radical

1946
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:13,380
thought well we need to make radical
 

1947
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:17,030
thought well we need to make radical
change to build a better future and what

1948
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:17,040
change to build a better future and what
 

1949
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,530
change to build a better future and what
they described as what they felt was

1950
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:18,540
they described as what they felt was
 

1951
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,630
they described as what they felt was
Radical change was was a monstrous

1952
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:20,640
Radical change was was a monstrous
 

1953
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,270
Radical change was was a monstrous
atrocities by us so the criticism here

1954
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:23,280
atrocities by us so the criticism here
 

1955
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,750
atrocities by us so the criticism here
of Peter is a uh

1956
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:26,760
of Peter is a uh
 

1957
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,430
of Peter is a uh
is that

1958
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:28,440
is that
 

1959
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:31,730
is that
uh he was uh part of an organization

1960
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:31,740
uh he was uh part of an organization
 

1961
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,109
uh he was uh part of an organization
that was

1962
00:40:33,109 --> 00:40:33,119
that was
 

1963
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:34,849
that was
kind of um

1964
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:34,859
kind of um
 

1965
00:40:34,859 --> 00:40:37,730
kind of um
well funding an effort that was an

1966
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:37,740
well funding an effort that was an
 

1967
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:40,010
well funding an effort that was an
unsafe implementation of a biosafety

1968
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:40,020
unsafe implementation of a biosafety
 

1969
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:43,309
unsafe implementation of a biosafety
level for laboratory well a few things

1970
00:40:43,309 --> 00:40:43,319
level for laboratory well a few things
 

1971
00:40:43,319 --> 00:40:47,089
level for laboratory well a few things
so what he thought he was doing

1972
00:40:47,089 --> 00:40:47,099
so what he thought he was doing
 

1973
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:49,309
so what he thought he was doing
um was and and what he thought he was

1974
00:40:49,309 --> 00:40:49,319
um was and and what he thought he was
 

1975
00:40:49,319 --> 00:40:51,589
um was and and what he thought he was
doing is itself highly controversial

1976
00:40:51,589 --> 00:40:51,599
doing is itself highly controversial
 

1977
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:56,390
doing is itself highly controversial
because there's one there that in 2011

1978
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:56,400
because there's one there that in 2011
 

1979
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,589
because there's one there that in 2011
um there were I know you've talked about

1980
00:40:57,589 --> 00:40:57,599
um there were I know you've talked about
 

1981
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:00,650
um there were I know you've talked about
this with other guests but in in 2011 uh

1982
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:00,660
this with other guests but in in 2011 uh
 

1983
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,990
this with other guests but in in 2011 uh
there were the first

1984
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:02,000
there were the first
 

1985
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,809
there were the first
published papers on this now Infamous

1986
00:41:05,809 --> 00:41:05,819
published papers on this now Infamous
 

1987
00:41:05,819 --> 00:41:07,970
published papers on this now Infamous
gain of function uh research and and

1988
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:07,980
gain of function uh research and and
 

1989
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:12,470
gain of function uh research and and
basically what they did both in in

1990
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:12,480
basically what they did both in in
 

1991
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,030
basically what they did both in in
different labs and certainly in the

1992
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:14,040
different labs and certainly in the
 

1993
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,210
different labs and certainly in the
United States in in Wisconsin and in in

1994
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:17,220
United States in in Wisconsin and in in
 

1995
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:21,109
United States in in Wisconsin and in in
the Netherlands was they had a bird flu

1996
00:41:21,109 --> 00:41:21,119
the Netherlands was they had a bird flu
 

1997
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:24,650
the Netherlands was they had a bird flu
virus that was that was very dangerous

1998
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:24,660
virus that was that was very dangerous
 

1999
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:29,030
virus that was that was very dangerous
but not massively uh transmissive and

2000
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:29,040
but not massively uh transmissive and
 

2001
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,490
but not massively uh transmissive and
they they had a gain a function process

2002
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:31,500
they they had a gain a function process
 

2003
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,650
they they had a gain a function process
through what's called serial passage

2004
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:33,660
through what's called serial passage
 

2005
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,510
through what's called serial passage
which means basically passing advice

2006
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:35,520
which means basically passing advice
 

2007
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,970
which means basically passing advice
like natural selection but forcing

2008
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:37,980
like natural selection but forcing
 

2009
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:40,309
like natural selection but forcing
natural selection by just passing a

2010
00:41:40,309 --> 00:41:40,319
natural selection by just passing a
 

2011
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:42,410
natural selection by just passing a
virus through a different cell cultures

2012
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:42,420
virus through a different cell cultures
 

2013
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:45,109
virus through a different cell cultures
and then selecting for what it is that

2014
00:41:45,109 --> 00:41:45,119
and then selecting for what it is that
 

2015
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,470
and then selecting for what it is that
you want so relatively easily they took

2016
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:48,480
you want so relatively easily they took
 

2017
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,630
you want so relatively easily they took
this deadly but not massively

2018
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:50,640
this deadly but not massively
 

2019
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,270
this deadly but not massively
transmissive virus and turned it into in

2020
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:53,280
transmissive virus and turned it into in
 

2021
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,349
transmissive virus and turned it into in
a lab a deadly and transmissive virus

2022
00:41:57,349 --> 00:41:57,359
a lab a deadly and transmissive virus
 

2023
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:59,089
a lab a deadly and transmissive virus
and that showed that this is really

2024
00:41:59,089 --> 00:41:59,099
and that showed that this is really
 

2025
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:01,010
and that showed that this is really
dangerous and so there were at that

2026
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:01,020
dangerous and so there were at that
 

2027
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,470
dangerous and so there were at that
point there was a huge controversy there

2028
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:03,480
point there was a huge controversy there
 

2029
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,809
point there was a huge controversy there
were some people

2030
00:42:04,809 --> 00:42:04,819
were some people
 

2031
00:42:04,819 --> 00:42:08,630
were some people
like Richard ebright and Mark lipsich at

2032
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:08,640
like Richard ebright and Mark lipsich at
 

2033
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,809
like Richard ebright and Mark lipsich at
Harvard who were saying that this is

2034
00:42:11,809 --> 00:42:11,819
Harvard who were saying that this is
 

2035
00:42:11,819 --> 00:42:14,930
Harvard who were saying that this is
really dangerous we're in the the idea

2036
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:14,940
really dangerous we're in the the idea
 

2037
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:17,450
really dangerous we're in the the idea
that we need to create monsters to study

2038
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:17,460
that we need to create monsters to study
 

2039
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:19,670
that we need to create monsters to study
monsters I think maybe even you have

2040
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:19,680
monsters I think maybe even you have
 

2041
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,890
monsters I think maybe even you have
said that in the past it doesn't make

2042
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:21,900
said that in the past it doesn't make
 

2043
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,690
said that in the past it doesn't make
sense because there's an unlimited

2044
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:23,700
sense because there's an unlimited
 

2045
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,550
sense because there's an unlimited
number of monsters and so what are we

2046
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:25,560
number of monsters and so what are we
 

2047
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,990
number of monsters and so what are we
going to do create an unlimited number

2048
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:27,000
going to do create an unlimited number
 

2049
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,089
going to do create an unlimited number
of monsters and if we do that eventually

2050
00:42:29,089 --> 00:42:29,099
of monsters and if we do that eventually
 

2051
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:30,950
of monsters and if we do that eventually
the monsters are are going to get out

2052
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:30,960
the monsters are are going to get out
 

2053
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,950
the monsters are are going to get out
then there was the Peter daisik camp and

2054
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:33,960
then there was the Peter daisik camp and
 

2055
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,990
then there was the Peter daisik camp and
he got a lot of fun funding particularly

2056
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:36,000
he got a lot of fun funding particularly
 

2057
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,329
he got a lot of fun funding particularly
from the United States who said well and

2058
00:42:38,329 --> 00:42:38,339
from the United States who said well and
 

2059
00:42:38,339 --> 00:42:40,790
from the United States who said well and
and certainly Collins and fauci were

2060
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:40,800
and certainly Collins and fauci were
 

2061
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,370
and certainly Collins and fauci were
supportive of this and they thought well

2062
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:43,380
supportive of this and they thought well
 

2063
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:46,069
supportive of this and they thought well
there's a safe way to go out into the

2064
00:42:46,069 --> 00:42:46,079
there's a safe way to go out into the
 

2065
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:47,930
there's a safe way to go out into the
world to collect the world's most

2066
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:47,940
world to collect the world's most
 

2067
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,930
world to collect the world's most
dangerous viruses and to poke and prod

2068
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:50,940
dangerous viruses and to poke and prod
 

2069
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:52,190
dangerous viruses and to poke and prod
them

2070
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:52,200
them
 

2071
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,230
them
um to figure out how they might mutate

2072
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:54,240
um to figure out how they might mutate
 

2073
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,910
um to figure out how they might mutate
how they might become more dangerous

2074
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:55,920
how they might become more dangerous
 

2075
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:00,650
how they might become more dangerous
with the goal of predicting future

2076
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:00,660
with the goal of predicting future
 

2077
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,809
with the goal of predicting future
pandemics and that certainly never

2078
00:43:02,809 --> 00:43:02,819
pandemics and that certainly never
 

2079
00:43:02,819 --> 00:43:05,650
pandemics and that certainly never
happened with the goal of creating

2080
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:05,660
happened with the goal of creating
 

2081
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:09,849
happened with the goal of creating
vaccines and treatments and that largely

2082
00:43:09,849 --> 00:43:09,859
vaccines and treatments and that largely
 

2083
00:43:09,859 --> 00:43:12,349
vaccines and treatments and that largely
never happened but that was so Peter

2084
00:43:12,349 --> 00:43:12,359
never happened but that was so Peter
 

2085
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:15,710
never happened but that was so Peter
daisak kind of epitomized that that

2086
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:15,720
daisak kind of epitomized that that
 

2087
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,809
daisak kind of epitomized that that
second second approach

2088
00:43:17,809 --> 00:43:17,819
second second approach
 

2089
00:43:17,819 --> 00:43:20,690
second second approach
um and as as you've talked about in the

2090
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:20,700
um and as as you've talked about in the
 

2091
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:23,390
um and as as you've talked about in the
past in 2014 there was a funding

2092
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:23,400
past in 2014 there was a funding
 

2093
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,550
past in 2014 there was a funding
moratorium in the United States and then

2094
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:25,560
moratorium in the United States and then
 

2095
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:28,609
moratorium in the United States and then
in 2017 that was lifted it didn't affect

2096
00:43:28,609 --> 00:43:28,619
in 2017 that was lifted it didn't affect
 

2097
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:31,130
in 2017 that was lifted it didn't affect
the funding that went to the to the Eco

2098
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:31,140
the funding that went to the to the Eco
 

2099
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,349
the funding that went to the to the Eco
Health Alliance

2100
00:43:33,349 --> 00:43:33,359
Health Alliance
 

2101
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:36,829
Health Alliance
um so when this happened in in the

2102
00:43:36,829 --> 00:43:36,839
um so when this happened in in the
 

2103
00:43:36,839 --> 00:43:38,270
um so when this happened in in the
beginning and again coming back to

2104
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:38,280
beginning and again coming back to
 

2105
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,890
beginning and again coming back to
Peter's motivations

2106
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:39,900
Peter's motivations
 

2107
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:42,470
Peter's motivations
I don't think here's the best case

2108
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:42,480
I don't think here's the best case
 

2109
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,510
I don't think here's the best case
scenario for for Peter I'm going to give

2110
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:44,520
scenario for for Peter I'm going to give
 

2111
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,849
scenario for for Peter I'm going to give
you if what I imagine he was thinking

2112
00:43:46,849 --> 00:43:46,859
you if what I imagine he was thinking
 

2113
00:43:46,859 --> 00:43:48,530
you if what I imagine he was thinking
and then I'll tell you what I actually

2114
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:48,540
and then I'll tell you what I actually
 

2115
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:49,609
and then I'll tell you what I actually
think

2116
00:43:49,609 --> 00:43:49,619
think
 

2117
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:51,650
think
so I think here's what he's thinking

2118
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:51,660
so I think here's what he's thinking
 

2119
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:54,890
so I think here's what he's thinking
um this is most likely a natural origin

2120
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:54,900
um this is most likely a natural origin
 

2121
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:58,010
um this is most likely a natural origin
outbreak it it just like SARS won and

2122
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:58,020
outbreak it it just like SARS won and
 

2123
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:00,650
outbreak it it just like SARS won and
again in Peter's hypothetical mind just

2124
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:00,660
again in Peter's hypothetical mind just
 

2125
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,690
again in Peter's hypothetical mind just
like SARS one this is most likely a

2126
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:02,700
like SARS one this is most likely a
 

2127
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:05,690
like SARS one this is most likely a
natural outbreak we need to have an

2128
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:05,700
natural outbreak we need to have an
 

2129
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,790
natural outbreak we need to have an
International Coalition in order to

2130
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:07,800
International Coalition in order to
 

2131
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:11,210
International Coalition in order to
fight it if we allow these political

2132
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:11,220
fight it if we allow these political
 

2133
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:13,250
fight it if we allow these political
attacks to undermine our Chinese

2134
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:13,260
attacks to undermine our Chinese
 

2135
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:15,230
attacks to undermine our Chinese

2136
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:15,240
counterparts and the Trust In This
 

2137
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,970
counterparts and the Trust In This
release relationships that we've built

2138
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:16,980
release relationships that we've built
 

2139
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:19,490
release relationships that we've built
over many years we're really screwed

2140
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:19,500
over many years we're really screwed
 

2141
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,589
over many years we're really screwed
because they have the most local

2142
00:44:21,589 --> 00:44:21,599
because they have the most local
 

2143
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:24,530
because they have the most local
knowledge of these outbreaks and even

2144
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:24,540
knowledge of these outbreaks and even
 

2145
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,690
knowledge of these outbreaks and even
though and and this guy gets a lot more

2146
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:26,700
though and and this guy gets a lot more
 

2147
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:30,050
though and and this guy gets a lot more
complicated even though there are basic

2148
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:30,060
complicated even though there are basic
 

2149
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:32,630
complicated even though there are basic
questions that anybody would ask and

2150
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:32,640
questions that anybody would ask and
 

2151
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,930
questions that anybody would ask and
that shojang Li herself did ask about

2152
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:34,940
that shojang Li herself did ask about
 

2153
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:38,510
that shojang Li herself did ask about
the origins of this pandemic even though

2154
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:38,520
the origins of this pandemic even though
 

2155
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,190
the origins of this pandemic even though
Peter dazak and I'll mention this

2156
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:40,200
Peter dazak and I'll mention this
 

2157
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,589
Peter dazak and I'll mention this
describe this in a moment had secret

2158
00:44:42,589 --> 00:44:42,599
describe this in a moment had secret
 

2159
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:45,530
describe this in a moment had secret
information that we didn't have that in

2160
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:45,540
information that we didn't have that in
 

2161
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:47,750
information that we didn't have that in
my mind massively increases the

2162
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:47,760
my mind massively increases the
 

2163
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,809
my mind massively increases the
possibility of a lab incident origin

2164
00:44:50,809 --> 00:44:50,819
possibility of a lab incident origin
 

2165
00:44:50,819 --> 00:44:54,230
possibility of a lab incident origin
I Peter daisak would like to guide the

2166
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:54,240
I Peter daisak would like to guide the
 

2167
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,630
I Peter daisak would like to guide the
public conversation in the direction

2168
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:56,640
public conversation in the direction
 

2169
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,410
public conversation in the direction
where I think it should go and in the in

2170
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:00,420
where I think it should go and in the in
 

2171
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:02,290
where I think it should go and in the in
support of the kind of international

2172
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:02,300
support of the kind of international
 

2173
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:04,550
support of the kind of international
collaboration that I think is necessary

2174
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:04,560
collaboration that I think is necessary
 

2175
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,290
collaboration that I think is necessary
that's a strong positive discussion

2176
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:06,300
that's a strong positive discussion
 

2177
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:07,609
that's a strong positive discussion
because

2178
00:45:07,609 --> 00:45:07,619
because
 

2179
00:45:07,619 --> 00:45:09,650
because
it's true

2180
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:09,660
it's true
 

2181
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:12,530
it's true
that there's a lot of political BS and a

2182
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:12,540
that there's a lot of political BS and a
 

2183
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:13,910
that there's a lot of political BS and a
lot of uh

2184
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:13,920
lot of uh
 

2185
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,690
lot of uh
kind of just the bickering and lies as

2186
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:17,700
kind of just the bickering and lies as
 

2187
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,970
kind of just the bickering and lies as
we've talked about and so it's very

2188
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:19,980
we've talked about and so it's very
 

2189
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:21,470
we've talked about and so it's very
convenient to say you know what let's

2190
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:21,480
convenient to say you know what let's
 

2191
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,510
convenient to say you know what let's
just ignore all of these quote unquote

2192
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:23,520
just ignore all of these quote unquote
 

2193
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,290
just ignore all of these quote unquote
lies and my favorite word misinformation

2194
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:26,300
lies and my favorite word misinformation
 

2195
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:29,990
lies and my favorite word misinformation
uh and then because the way out from

2196
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:30,000
uh and then because the way out from
 

2197
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,630
uh and then because the way out from
this serious pandemic is for us to work

2198
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:32,640
this serious pandemic is for us to work
 

2199
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,030
this serious pandemic is for us to work
together so let's strengthen our

2200
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:35,040

00:48:59,819 --> 00:49:01,970
viruses to insert a furin cleavage site
so I think when when everyone's now seen

2356
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:01,980
so I think when when everyone's now seen
 

2357
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:05,030
so I think when when everyone's now seen
the image of the SARS cov2 virus it has

2358
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:05,040
the image of the SARS cov2 virus it has
 

2359
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,770
the image of the SARS cov2 virus it has
these little Spike proteins these little

2360
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:06,780
these little Spike proteins these little
 

2361
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:08,450
these little Spike proteins these little
things that that stick out which is why

2362
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:08,460
things that that stick out which is why
 

2363
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:10,430
things that that stick out which is why
they call it a coronavirus within that

2364
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:10,440
they call it a coronavirus within that
 

2365
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,930
they call it a coronavirus within that
Spike protein are these if you're on

2366
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:11,940
Spike protein are these if you're on
 

2367
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:13,609
Spike protein are these if you're on
cleavage sites which basically help with

2368
00:49:13,609 --> 00:49:13,619
cleavage sites which basically help with
 

2369
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:17,030
cleavage sites which basically help with
the virus getting access into our

2370
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:17,040
the virus getting access into our
 

2371
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,670
the virus getting access into our
cells and they're going to genetically

2372
00:49:19,670 --> 00:49:19,680
cells and they're going to genetically
 

2373
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,530
cells and they're going to genetically
engineer these furion cleavage sites

2374
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:21,540
engineer these furion cleavage sites
 

2375
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:24,470
engineer these furion cleavage sites
into these bat coronaviruses the

2376
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:24,480
into these bat coronaviruses the
 

2377
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:29,569
into these bat coronaviruses the
cervical viruses and then and so then a

2378
00:49:29,569 --> 00:49:29,579
cervical viruses and then and so then a
 

2379
00:49:29,579 --> 00:49:32,089
cervical viruses and then and so then a
year and a half later what do we see we

2380
00:49:32,089 --> 00:49:32,099
year and a half later what do we see we
 

2381
00:49:32,099 --> 00:49:35,089
year and a half later what do we see we
see a bat Coronavirus

2382
00:49:35,089 --> 00:49:35,099
see a bat Coronavirus
 

2383
00:49:35,099 --> 00:49:37,309
see a bat Coronavirus
with if you're in cleavage site unlike

2384
00:49:37,309 --> 00:49:37,319
with if you're in cleavage site unlike
 

2385
00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:40,250
with if you're in cleavage site unlike
anything that we've ever seen before in

2386
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:40,260
anything that we've ever seen before in
 

2387
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:43,730
anything that we've ever seen before in
that category of SARS like coronaviruses

2388
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:43,740
that category of SARS like coronaviruses
 

2389
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:47,870
that category of SARS like coronaviruses
that well yes I mean it the the DARPA

2390
00:49:47,870 --> 00:49:47,880
that well yes I mean it the the DARPA
 

2391
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:50,089
that well yes I mean it the the DARPA
very correctly didn't support that

2392
00:49:50,089 --> 00:49:50,099
very correctly didn't support that
 

2393
00:49:50,099 --> 00:49:52,430
very correctly didn't support that
application well that's actually let's

2394
00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:52,440
application well that's actually let's
 

2395
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:53,870
application well that's actually let's
like pause on that so for a lot of

2396
00:49:53,870 --> 00:49:53,880
like pause on that so for a lot of
 

2397
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:55,970
like pause on that so for a lot of
people that's like the Smoking Gun yeah

2398
00:49:55,970 --> 00:49:55,980
people that's like the Smoking Gun yeah
 

2399
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:59,809
people that's like the Smoking Gun yeah
okay let's talk about this 2018

2400
00:49:59,809 --> 00:49:59,819
okay let's talk about this 2018
 

2401
00:49:59,819 --> 00:50:03,230
okay let's talk about this 2018
proposal to DARPA so I guess who's

2402
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:03,240
proposal to DARPA so I guess who's
 

2403
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,990
proposal to DARPA so I guess who's
drafted the proposal is it yeah ego

2404
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:06,000
drafted the proposal is it yeah ego
 

2405
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,650
drafted the proposal is it yeah ego
Health but the proposal is to do so Eco

2406
00:50:09,650 --> 00:50:09,660
Health but the proposal is to do so Eco
 

2407
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:11,750
Health but the proposal is to do so Eco
health is technically

2408
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:11,760
health is technically
 

2409
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,230
health is technically
uh a U.S funded organization primarily

2410
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:15,240
uh a U.S funded organization primarily
 

2411
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:18,770
uh a U.S funded organization primarily
and then the idea was to do work at

2412
00:50:18,770 --> 00:50:18,780
and then the idea was to do work at
 

2413
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:21,710
and then the idea was to do work at
Wuhan Institute of virology with yeah so

2414
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:21,720
Wuhan Institute of virology with yeah so
 

2415
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:24,170
Wuhan Institute of virology with yeah so
it was with equal Health yes so Eco

2416
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:24,180
it was with equal Health yes so Eco
 

2417
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:26,210
it was with equal Health yes so Eco
Health basically that um the one

2418
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:26,220
Health basically that um the one
 

2419
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:27,770
Health basically that um the one
Institute of biology was going to go and

2420
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:27,780
Institute of biology was going to go and
 

2421
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:29,870
Institute of biology was going to go and
they were going to collect these viruses

2422
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:29,880
they were going to collect these viruses
 

2423
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,089
they were going to collect these viruses
and store them at we wanted to do but

2424
00:50:32,089 --> 00:50:32,099
and store them at we wanted to do but
 

2425
00:50:32,099 --> 00:50:33,650
and store them at we wanted to do but
they're also going to do the actual test

2426
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:33,660
they're also going to do the actual test
 

2427
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:35,270
they're also going to do the actual test
recording it's a really important Point

2428
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:35,280
recording it's a really important Point
 

2429
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,150
recording it's a really important Point
according to their proposal the actual

2430
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:38,160
according to their proposal the actual
 

2431
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,849
according to their proposal the actual
work was going to be done at the lab of

2432
00:50:40,849 --> 00:50:40,859
work was going to be done at the lab of
 

2433
00:50:40,859 --> 00:50:43,010
work was going to be done at the lab of
Ralph Barrick at the University of North

2434
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:43,020
Ralph Barrick at the University of North
 

2435
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:45,170
Ralph Barrick at the University of North
Carolina who's probably the world's

2436
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:45,180
Carolina who's probably the world's
 

2437
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:47,890
Carolina who's probably the world's
leading expert on uh Corona

2438
00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:47,900
leading expert on uh Corona
 

2439
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:52,609
leading expert on uh Corona
coronaviruses and so we know that DARPA

2440
00:50:52,609 --> 00:50:52,619
coronaviruses and so we know that DARPA
 

2441
00:50:52,619 --> 00:50:55,309
coronaviruses and so we know that DARPA
didn't fund that work

2442
00:50:55,309 --> 00:50:55,319
didn't fund that work
 

2443
00:50:55,319 --> 00:50:58,730
didn't fund that work
um we know I think quite well that Ralph

2444
00:50:58,730 --> 00:50:58,740
um we know I think quite well that Ralph
 

2445
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:02,710
um we know I think quite well that Ralph
Barrack's lab in part because it was not

2446
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:02,720
Barrack's lab in part because it was not
 

2447
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:06,349
Barrack's lab in part because it was not
funded by by DARPA they didn't do that

2448
00:51:06,349 --> 00:51:06,359
funded by by DARPA they didn't do that
 

2449
00:51:06,359 --> 00:51:10,130
funded by by DARPA they didn't do that
specific work what we don't know is well

2450
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:10,140
specific work what we don't know is well
 

2451
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:12,650
specific work what we don't know is well
what work was done at the Wuhan

2452
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:12,660
what work was done at the Wuhan
 

2453
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:15,410
what work was done at the Wuhan
Institute of virology because wiv was

2454
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:15,420
Institute of virology because wiv was
 

2455
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:18,470
Institute of virology because wiv was
part of this proposal they had access to

2456
00:51:18,470 --> 00:51:18,480
part of this proposal they had access to
 

2457
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:21,109
part of this proposal they had access to
all of the plans they had done they had

2458
00:51:21,109 --> 00:51:21,119
all of the plans they had done they had
 

2459
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,329
all of the plans they had done they had
their own capacity and they had already

2460
00:51:23,329 --> 00:51:23,339
their own capacity and they had already
 

2461
00:51:23,339 --> 00:51:26,390
their own capacity and they had already
done a lot of work in genetically engine

2462
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:26,400
done a lot of work in genetically engine
 

2463
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,390
done a lot of work in genetically engine
genetically altering this exact category

2464
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:29,400
genetically altering this exact category
 

2465
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:32,809
genetically altering this exact category
of viruses they had created a chimeric

2466
00:51:32,809 --> 00:51:32,819
of viruses they had created a chimeric
 

2467
00:51:32,819 --> 00:51:36,109
of viruses they had created a chimeric
mixed viruses they had done they had

2468
00:51:36,109 --> 00:51:36,119
mixed viruses they had done they had
 

2469
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:39,410
mixed viruses they had done they had
mastered pretty much all of the steps in

2470
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:39,420
mastered pretty much all of the steps in
 

2471
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:41,030
mastered pretty much all of the steps in
order to achieve this thing that they

2472
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:41,040
order to achieve this thing that they
 

2473
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,790
order to achieve this thing that they
applied for funding with ecohealth to do

2474
00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:43,800
applied for funding with ecohealth to do
 

2475
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:47,870
applied for funding with ecohealth to do
and so the question is did the Wuhan

2476
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:47,880
and so the question is did the Wuhan
 

2477
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:50,270
and so the question is did the Wuhan
Institute of virology go through with

2478
00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:50,280
Institute of virology go through with
 

2479
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,970
Institute of virology go through with
that research anyway and in my mind

2480
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:52,980
that research anyway and in my mind
 

2481
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:54,710
that research anyway and in my mind
there's that's a very very real

2482
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:54,720
there's that's a very very real
 

2483
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,030
there's that's a very very real
possibility it would certainly explain

2484
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:56,040
possibility it would certainly explain
 

2485
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:59,650
possibility it would certainly explain
why they're giving no information and

2486
00:51:59,650 --> 00:51:59,660
why they're giving no information and
 

2487
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:01,790
why they're giving no information and
as you know I've been a member of the

2488
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:01,800
as you know I've been a member of the
 

2489
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,170
as you know I've been a member of the

2494
00:52:07,910 --> 00:52:07,920
editing which Dr Tedros created in the
 

2495
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,650
editing which Dr Tedros created in the
aftermath of the announcement of the

2496
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:09,660
aftermath of the announcement of the
 

2497
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:12,170
aftermath of the announcement of the
world's first crispr babies and and it

2498
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:12,180
world's first crispr babies and and it
 

2499
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:14,150
world's first crispr babies and and it
was just basically the exact same story

2500
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:14,160
was just basically the exact same story
 

2501
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:17,030
was just basically the exact same story
so ho John Quay Chinese scientist it was

2502
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:17,040
so ho John Quay Chinese scientist it was
 

2503
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,589
so ho John Quay Chinese scientist it was
not a first-tier scientist but a

2504
00:52:18,589 --> 00:52:18,599
not a first-tier scientist but a
 

2505
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:21,049
not a first-tier scientist but a
perfectly adequate second-tier scientist

2506
00:52:21,049 --> 00:52:21,059
perfectly adequate second-tier scientist
 

2507
00:52:21,059 --> 00:52:23,089
perfectly adequate second-tier scientist
came to the United States learned all of

2508
00:52:23,089 --> 00:52:23,099
came to the United States learned all of
 

2509
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:25,069
came to the United States learned all of
these capacities went back to China and

2510
00:52:25,069 --> 00:52:25,079
these capacities went back to China and
 

2511
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:26,930
these capacities went back to China and
said well there's a much more permissive

2512
00:52:26,930 --> 00:52:26,940
said well there's a much more permissive
 

2513
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:29,870
said well there's a much more permissive
environment I'm gonna you know be a

2514
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:29,880
environment I'm gonna you know be a
 

2515
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,790
environment I'm gonna you know be a
world leader I'm going to establish both

2516
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:31,800
world leader I'm going to establish both
 

2517
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,970
world leader I'm going to establish both
myself and China so in every scientific

2518
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:34,980
myself and China so in every scientific
 

2519
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:37,130
myself and China so in every scientific
field we're seeing this this same thing

2520
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:37,140
field we're seeing this this same thing
 

2521
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:39,829
field we're seeing this this same thing
where you kind of learn a model and then

2522
00:52:39,829 --> 00:52:39,839
where you kind of learn a model and then
 

2523
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:43,030
where you kind of learn a model and then
you do it in China so is it possible

2524
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:43,040
you do it in China so is it possible
 

2525
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,349
you do it in China so is it possible
that the Wuhan Institute of virology

2526
00:52:45,349 --> 00:52:45,359
that the Wuhan Institute of virology
 

2527
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:49,130
that the Wuhan Institute of virology
with this exact game plan was doing it

2528
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:49,140
with this exact game plan was doing it
 

2529
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:53,150
with this exact game plan was doing it
anyway do we possible we have no clue

2530
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:53,160
anyway do we possible we have no clue
 

2531
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,670
anyway do we possible we have no clue
what work was being done at the Wuhan

2532
00:52:55,670 --> 00:52:55,680
what work was being done at the Wuhan
 

2533
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,309
what work was being done at the Wuhan
Institute of virology it seems extremely

2534
00:52:58,309 --> 00:52:58,319
Institute of virology it seems extremely
 

2535
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:01,609
Institute of virology it seems extremely
likely that at the Wuhan Institute of

2536
00:53:01,609 --> 00:53:01,619
likely that at the Wuhan Institute of
 

2537
00:53:01,619 --> 00:53:03,230
likely that at the Wuhan Institute of
virology and this is certainly the U.S

2538
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:03,240
virology and this is certainly the U.S
 

2539
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,210
virology and this is certainly the U.S
government position there was the work

2540
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:05,220
government position there was the work
 

2541
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:08,569
government position there was the work
that was being done in Dr shu's lab but

2542
00:53:08,569 --> 00:53:08,579
that was being done in Dr shu's lab but
 

2543
00:53:08,579 --> 00:53:11,270
that was being done in Dr shu's lab but
that wasn't the whole wiv we know at

2544
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:11,280
that wasn't the whole wiv we know at
 

2545
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,290
that wasn't the whole wiv we know at
least a coin in the United States

2546
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:12,300
least a coin in the United States
 

2547
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:13,549
least a coin in the United States
government that there was the Chinese

2548
00:53:13,549 --> 00:53:13,559
government that there was the Chinese
 

2549
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:17,049
government that there was the Chinese
military the pla was doing work there

2550
00:53:17,049 --> 00:53:17,059
military the pla was doing work there
 

2551
00:53:17,059 --> 00:53:20,390
military the pla was doing work there
were they doing this kind of work not to

2552
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:20,400
were they doing this kind of work not to
 

2553
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,690
were they doing this kind of work not to
create a bio weapon but in order to

2554
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:23,700
create a bio weapon but in order to
 

2555
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,609
create a bio weapon but in order to
understand these viruses maybe to

2556
00:53:25,609 --> 00:53:25,619
understand these viruses maybe to
 

2557
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:29,030
understand these viruses maybe to
develop vaccines and treatments it seems

2558
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:29,040
develop vaccines and treatments it seems
 

2559
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:33,530
develop vaccines and treatments it seems
like a very very logical possibility and

2560
00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:33,540
like a very very logical possibility and
 

2561
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:35,450
like a very very logical possibility and
then so we know that the the one instead

2562
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:35,460
then so we know that the the one instead
 

2563
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:37,849
then so we know that the the one instead
of virology had all of the skills we

2564
00:53:37,849 --> 00:53:37,859
of virology had all of the skills we
 

2565
00:53:37,859 --> 00:53:39,650
of virology had all of the skills we
know that they were part of this

2566
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:39,660
know that they were part of this
 

2567
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:42,410
know that they were part of this
proposal and then you have Peter dazak

2568
00:53:42,410 --> 00:53:42,420
proposal and then you have Peter dazak
 

2569
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:44,690
proposal and then you have Peter dazak
who knows all of this that at that time

2570
00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:44,700
who knows all of this that at that time
 

2571
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:47,690
who knows all of this that at that time
in February of 2020 we didn't know but

2572
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:47,700
in February of 2020 we didn't know but
 

2573
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:49,609
in February of 2020 we didn't know but
then he comes swinging out of the gate

2574
00:53:49,609 --> 00:53:49,619
then he comes swinging out of the gate
 

2575
00:53:49,619 --> 00:53:51,470
then he comes swinging out of the gate
saying anybody who's raising this

2576
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:51,480
saying anybody who's raising this
 

2577
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,290
saying anybody who's raising this
possibility of a of a lab incident

2578
00:53:54,290 --> 00:53:54,300
possibility of a of a lab incident
 

2579
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:57,290
possibility of a of a lab incident
origin is a conspiracy theorist I mean

2580
00:53:57,290 --> 00:53:57,300
origin is a conspiracy theorist I mean
 

2581
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:00,890
origin is a conspiracy theorist I mean
it really makes him look in my mind very

2582
00:54:00,890 --> 00:54:00,900
it really makes him look in my mind very
 

2583
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:03,049
it really makes him look in my mind very
very bad and yeah not to at least be

2584
00:54:03,049 --> 00:54:03,059
very bad and yeah not to at least be
 

2585
00:54:03,059 --> 00:54:05,089
very bad and yeah not to at least be
somewhat open-minded on this because he

2586
00:54:05,089 --> 00:54:05,099
somewhat open-minded on this because he
 

2587
00:54:05,099 --> 00:54:07,849
somewhat open-minded on this because he
knows all the details he knows that it's

2588
00:54:07,849 --> 00:54:07,859
knows all the details he knows that it's
 

2589
00:54:07,859 --> 00:54:10,250
knows all the details he knows that it's
not zero percent I mean there's no way

2590
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:10,260
not zero percent I mean there's no way
 

2591
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:12,349
not zero percent I mean there's no way
in his mind could you even argue that so

2592
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:12,359
in his mind could you even argue that so
 

2593
00:54:12,359 --> 00:54:14,270
in his mind could you even argue that so
it's potential because of the bias

2594
00:54:14,270 --> 00:54:14,280
it's potential because of the bias
 

2595
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,970
it's potential because of the bias
because of your focus I mean it could be

2596
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:16,980
because of your focus I mean it could be
 

2597
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:17,870
because of your focus I mean it could be
the

2598
00:54:17,870 --> 00:54:17,880
the
 

2599
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:21,049
the
Anthony fauci masks thing whereas he

2600
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:21,059
Anthony fauci masks thing whereas he
 

2601
00:54:21,059 --> 00:54:22,609
Anthony fauci masks thing whereas he
knows there's some significant

2602
00:54:22,609 --> 00:54:22,619
knows there's some significant
 

2603
00:54:22,619 --> 00:54:24,650
knows there's some significant
probability that this is happening but

2604
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:24,660
probability that this is happening but
 

2605
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:26,950
probability that this is happening but
in order to

2606
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:26,960
in order to
 

2607
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:29,450
in order to
preserve good relations with our Chinese

2608
00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:29,460
preserve good relations with our Chinese
 

2609
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:31,730
preserve good relations with our Chinese
colleagues we want to make sure we tell

2610
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:31,740
colleagues we want to make sure we tell
 

2611
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:33,589
colleagues we want to make sure we tell
a certain kind of narrative so it's not

2612
00:54:33,589 --> 00:54:33,599
a certain kind of narrative so it's not
 

2613
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:36,650
a certain kind of narrative so it's not
really lying it's doing the best

2614
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:36,660
really lying it's doing the best
 

2615
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:39,950
really lying it's doing the best
possible action at this time to help the

2616
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:39,960
possible action at this time to help the
 

2617
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:41,630
possible action at this time to help the
world not that this already happened

2618
00:54:41,630 --> 00:54:41,640
world not that this already happened
 

2619
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:44,690
world not that this already happened
yeah but that's how like yeah I I think

2620
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:44,700
yeah but that's how like yeah I I think
 

2621
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:46,970
yeah but that's how like yeah I I think
it's quite likely that that was the

2622
00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:46,980
it's quite likely that that was the
 

2623
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:49,309
it's quite likely that that was the
story that he was telling himself

2624
00:54:49,309 --> 00:54:49,319
story that he was telling himself
 

2625
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:53,710
story that he was telling himself
but it's that that lack of transparency

2626
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:53,720
but it's that that lack of transparency
 

2627
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:57,710
but it's that that lack of transparency
in my mind is fraudulent

2628
00:54:57,710 --> 00:54:57,720
in my mind is fraudulent
 

2629
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,329
in my mind is fraudulent
um that the word that we were struggling

2630
00:54:59,329 --> 00:54:59,339
um that the word that we were struggling
 

2631
00:54:59,339 --> 00:55:01,130
um that the word that we were struggling
to understand something that we didn't

2632
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:01,140
to understand something that we didn't
 

2633
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:03,710
to understand something that we didn't
understand and that I just think that

2634
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:03,720
understand and that I just think that
 

2635
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:06,410
understand and that I just think that
people who possess that kind of

2636
00:55:06,410 --> 00:55:06,420
people who possess that kind of
 

2637
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:08,930
people who possess that kind of
information especially when

2638
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:08,940
information especially when
 

2639
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:11,210
information especially when
um the existence like his the entire

2640
00:55:11,210 --> 00:55:11,220
um the existence like his the entire
 

2641
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:13,609
um the existence like his the entire
career of Peter daisak is based on U.S

2642
00:55:13,609 --> 00:55:13,619
career of Peter daisak is based on U.S
 

2643
00:55:13,619 --> 00:55:16,549
career of Peter daisak is based on U.S
taxpayers there's a debt that comes with

2644
00:55:16,549 --> 00:55:16,559
taxpayers there's a debt that comes with
 

2645
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:18,530
taxpayers there's a debt that comes with
that and that debt is honesty and

2646
00:55:18,530 --> 00:55:18,540
that and that debt is honesty and
 

2647
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:20,030

honest and and transparent in the most
 

2655
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:29,390
honest and and transparent in the most
difficult times is really difficult if

2656
00:55:29,390 --> 00:55:29,400
difficult times is really difficult if
 

2657
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,549
difficult times is really difficult if
it were easy everybody would do it and

2658
00:55:31,549 --> 00:55:31,559
it were easy everybody would do it and
 

2659
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:34,549
it were easy everybody would do it and
that's I just feel that that uh Peter

2660
00:55:34,549 --> 00:55:34,559
that's I just feel that that uh Peter
 

2661
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:38,030
that's I just feel that that uh Peter
was the opposite of transparent and then

2662
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:38,040
was the opposite of transparent and then
 

2663
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:41,450
was the opposite of transparent and then
went on the offensive and then

2664
00:55:41,450 --> 00:55:41,460
went on the offensive and then
 

2665
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:44,870
went on the offensive and then
um uh had the gall of joining I know we

2666
00:55:44,870 --> 00:55:44,880
um uh had the gall of joining I know we
 

2667
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,970
um uh had the gall of joining I know we
can talk about this this

2668
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:46,980
can talk about this this
 

2669
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:50,289
can talk about this this
um highly compromised joint study

2670
00:55:50,289 --> 00:55:50,299
um highly compromised joint study
 

2671
00:55:50,299 --> 00:55:53,690
um highly compromised joint study
process with the the international

2672
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:53,700
process with the the international

00:55:59,030 --> 00:55:59,040
counterparts and used that as a way of
 

2677
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,370
counterparts and used that as a way of
furthering this

2678
00:56:01,370 --> 00:56:01,380
furthering this
 

2679
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:05,030
furthering this
um in my mind fraudulent narrative

2680
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:05,040
um in my mind fraudulent narrative
 

2681
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,789
um in my mind fraudulent narrative
um that it almost certainly came from

2682
00:56:07,789 --> 00:56:07,799
um that it almost certainly came from
 

2683
00:56:07,799 --> 00:56:10,910
um that it almost certainly came from
natural Origins and um and the lab

2684
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:10,920
natural Origins and um and the lab
 

2685
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:13,309
natural Origins and um and the lab
origin was extremely unlikely just to

2686
00:56:13,309 --> 00:56:13,319
origin was extremely unlikely just to
 

2687
00:56:13,319 --> 00:56:15,650
origin was extremely unlikely just to
stick briefly on the proposal to wrap

2688
00:56:15,650 --> 00:56:15,660
stick briefly on the proposal to wrap
 

2689
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:19,010
stick briefly on the proposal to wrap
that up because I do think

2690
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:19,020
that up because I do think
 

2691
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:22,370
that up because I do think
in a in a kind of John Stewart way if

2692
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:22,380
in a in a kind of John Stewart way if
 

2693
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:26,030
in a in a kind of John Stewart way if
you heard that uh a bit he yeah sort of

2694
00:56:26,030 --> 00:56:26,040
you heard that uh a bit he yeah sort of
 

2695
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:29,210
you heard that uh a bit he yeah sort of
kind of like common sense

2696
00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:29,220
kind of like common sense
 

2697
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:34,250
kind of like common sense
way the 2018 proposal to DARPA from

2698
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:34,260
way the 2018 proposal to DARPA from
 

2699
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:36,829
way the 2018 proposal to DARPA from
equal Health Alliance and wuhanistan

virology

2702
00:56:38,089 --> 00:56:38,099
virology
 

2703
00:56:38,099 --> 00:56:40,609
virology
just seems like a bit of a Smoking Gun

2704
00:56:40,609 --> 00:56:40,619
just seems like a bit of a Smoking Gun
 

2705
00:56:40,619 --> 00:56:43,549
just seems like a bit of a Smoking Gun
to me like that

2706
00:56:43,549 --> 00:56:43,559
to me like that
 

2707
00:56:43,559 --> 00:56:45,530
to me like that
um so there's this excellent book that

2708
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:45,540
um so there's this excellent book that
 

2709
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:47,930
um so there's this excellent book that
people should read uh called viral the

2710
00:56:47,930 --> 00:56:47,940
people should read uh called viral the
 

2711
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:50,630
people should read uh called viral the
search for the origin of covid-19 Matt

2712
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:50,640
search for the origin of covid-19 Matt
 

2713
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,089

Ridley and Alina Chan I think Alina is

2714
00:56:53,089 --> 00:56:53,099
Ridley and Alina Chan I think Alina is
 

2715
00:56:53,099 --> 00:56:55,430
Ridley and Alina Chan I think Alina is
in MIT should probably look at the broad

2716
00:56:55,430 --> 00:56:55,440
in MIT should probably look at the broad
 

2717
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,710
in MIT should probably look at the broad
yeah at Broad Institute yeah yeah

2718
00:56:57,710 --> 00:56:57,720
yeah at Broad Institute yeah yeah
 

2719
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:00,650
yeah at Broad Institute yeah yeah
so she I heard her in an interview

2720
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:00,660
so she I heard her in an interview
 

2721
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:04,549
so she I heard her in an interview
give this analogy of unicorns yeah and

2722
00:57:04,549 --> 00:57:04,559
give this analogy of unicorns yeah and
 

2723
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:06,650
give this analogy of unicorns yeah and
uh where

2724
00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:06,660
uh where
 

2725
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:09,530
uh where
basically somebody writes a proposal to

2726
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:09,540
basically somebody writes a proposal to
 

2727
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:12,950
basically somebody writes a proposal to
add horns to Horses The Proposal is

2728
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:12,960
add horns to Horses The Proposal is
 

2729
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,329
add horns to Horses The Proposal is
rejected

2730
00:57:14,329 --> 00:57:14,339
rejected
 

2731
00:57:14,339 --> 00:57:16,970
rejected
and then a couple of years later a year

2732
00:57:16,970 --> 00:57:16,980
and then a couple of years later a year
 

2733
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:23,870
and then a couple of years later a year
later a unicorn shows up

2734
00:57:23,870 --> 00:57:23,880

 

2735
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:26,089

and then I was like yeah I is not your

2736
00:57:26,089 --> 00:57:26,099
and then I was like yeah I is not your
 

2737
00:57:26,099 --> 00:57:27,950
and then I was like yeah I is not your
lord yeah it's like it's possible it's

2738
00:57:27,950 --> 00:57:27,960
lord yeah it's like it's possible it's
 

2739
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:30,170
lord yeah it's like it's possible it's
natural origin like we haven't detected

2740
00:57:30,170 --> 00:57:30,180
natural origin like we haven't detected
 

2741
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:31,970
natural origin like we haven't detected
a unicorn yet and this is the first time

2742
00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:31,980
a unicorn yet and this is the first time
 

2743
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:35,210
a unicorn yet and this is the first time
we've detected a unicorn or it could be

2744
00:57:35,210 --> 00:57:35,220
we've detected a unicorn or it could be
 

2745
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:37,390
we've detected a unicorn or it could be
this massive organization that was

planning is fully equipped has like a
 

2749
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:42,770
planning is fully equipped has like a
history of being able to do this stuff

2750
00:57:42,770 --> 00:57:42,780
history of being able to do this stuff
 

2751
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:44,630
history of being able to do this stuff
as the world experts to do it has the

2752
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:44,640
as the world experts to do it has the
 

2753
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:47,569

funding has the motivation to add horns
 

2755
00:57:47,579 --> 00:57:50,450
funding has the motivation to add horns
to horses and now unicorn shows up and

2756
00:57:50,450 --> 00:57:50,460
to horses and now unicorn shows up and
 

2757
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:52,730
to horses and now unicorn shows up and
they're saying nope yeah definitely

2758
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:52,740
they're saying nope yeah definitely
 

2759
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:55,370
they're saying nope yeah definitely
definitely natural that connects to the

2760
00:57:55,370 --> 00:57:55,380
definitely natural that connects to the
 

2761
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:57,470
definitely natural that connects to the
to what you your first question of how

2762
00:57:57,470 --> 00:57:57,480
to what you your first question of how
 

2763
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,690
to what you your first question of how
do I get to my 85 percent and here's

2764
00:57:59,690 --> 00:57:59,700
do I get to my 85 percent and here's
 

2765
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:03,109
do I get to my 85 percent and here's
here's a summary of that of that answer

2766
00:58:03,109 --> 00:58:03,119
here's a summary of that of that answer
 

2767
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:05,329
here's a summary of that of that answer
and so it's what I said in my 60 Minutes

2768
00:58:05,329 --> 00:58:05,339
and so it's what I said in my 60 Minutes
 

2769
00:58:05,339 --> 00:58:07,549
and so it's what I said in my 60 Minutes
uh interview a long time ago of all the

2770
00:58:07,549 --> 00:58:07,559
uh interview a long time ago of all the
 

2771
00:58:07,559 --> 00:58:09,109
uh interview a long time ago of all the
Gin joints and all the towns in all the

2772
00:58:09,109 --> 00:58:09,119
Gin joints and all the towns in all the
 

2773
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:12,170
Gin joints and all the towns in all the
world the quote from from Casablanca and

2774
00:58:12,170 --> 00:58:12,180
world the quote from from Casablanca and
 

2775
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:15,049
world the quote from from Casablanca and
so of all the places in the world where

2776
00:58:15,049 --> 00:58:15,059
so of all the places in the world where
 

2777
00:58:15,059 --> 00:58:18,770
so of all the places in the world where
we have an outbreak of a sars-like bat

2778
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:18,780
we have an outbreak of a sars-like bat
 

2779
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:22,490
we have an outbreak of a sars-like bat
coronavirus it's not in the area of the

2780
00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:22,500
coronavirus it's not in the area of the
 

2781
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:25,490
coronavirus it's not in the area of the
natural habitat of the Horseshoe bats

2782
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:25,500
natural habitat of the Horseshoe bats
 

2783
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:30,109
natural habitat of the Horseshoe bats
it's the one city in China with the

2784
00:58:30,109 --> 00:58:30,119
it's the one city in China with the
 

2785
00:58:30,119 --> 00:58:33,410
it's the one city in China with the
first and largest level 4 virology lab

2786
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:33,420
first and largest level 4 virology lab
 

2787
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:35,150
first and largest level 4 virology lab
which actually wasn't even using it they

2788
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:35,160
which actually wasn't even using it they
 

2789
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:37,490
which actually wasn't even using it they
were doing level three and level two for

2790
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:37,500
were doing level three and level two for
 

2791
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,349
were doing level three and level two for
this work where they had the world's

2792
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:39,359
this work where they had the world's
 

2793
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:42,289
this work where they had the world's
largest collection of bat coronaviruses

2794
00:58:42,289 --> 00:58:42,299
largest collection of bat coronaviruses
 

2795
00:58:42,299 --> 00:58:44,690
largest collection of bat coronaviruses
um where they were doing aggressive

2796
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:44,700
um where they were doing aggressive
 

2797
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:48,049
um where they were doing aggressive
experiments designed to make these scary

2798
00:58:48,049 --> 00:58:48,059
experiments designed to make these scary
 

2799
00:58:48,059 --> 00:58:51,410
experiments designed to make these scary
viruses scarier where they had been part

2800
00:58:51,410 --> 00:58:51,420
viruses scarier where they had been part
 

2801
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:55,430
viruses scarier where they had been part
of an application to insert a fury

2802
00:58:55,430 --> 00:58:55,440
of an application to insert a fury
 

2803
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:59,829
of an application to insert a fury
cleavage site able to infect human cells

2804
00:58:59,829 --> 00:58:59,839
cleavage site able to infect human cells
 

2805
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:03,710
cleavage site able to infect human cells
and where when the outbreak happened we

2806
00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:03,720
and where when the outbreak happened we
 

2807
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:06,410
and where when the outbreak happened we
had a virus that was ready ready for

2808
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:06,420
had a virus that was ready ready for
 

2809
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:08,150
had a virus that was ready ready for
action to infect humans and to this day

2810
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:08,160
action to infect humans and to this day
 

2811
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,970
action to infect humans and to this day
better able to infect humans than any

2812
00:59:10,970 --> 00:59:10,980
better able to infect humans than any
 

2813
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:13,490
better able to infect humans than any
other species including including bats

2814
00:59:13,490 --> 00:59:13,500
other species including including bats
 

2815
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:16,490
other species including including bats
and then from day one there's this

2816
00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:16,500
and then from day one there's this
 

2817
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:19,010
and then from day one there's this
massive cover-up and then on top of that

2818
00:59:19,010 --> 00:59:19,020
massive cover-up and then on top of that
 

2819
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:21,950
massive cover-up and then on top of that
in spite of lots of efforts by lots of

2820
00:59:21,950 --> 00:59:21,960
in spite of lots of efforts by lots of
 

2821
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:25,670
in spite of lots of efforts by lots of
people there's basically no evidence for

2822
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:25,680
people there's basically no evidence for
 

2823
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:28,010
people there's basically no evidence for
the natural origin hypothesis everything

2824
00:59:28,010 --> 00:59:28,020
the natural origin hypothesis everything
 

2825
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:29,390
the natural origin hypothesis everything
that I've described just now is

2826
00:59:29,390 --> 00:59:29,400
that I've described just now is
 

2827
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,190
that I've described just now is
circumstantial but there's a certain

2828
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:31,200
circumstantial but there's a certain
 

2829
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,470
circumstantial but there's a certain
point of where you add up the

2830
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:33,480
point of where you add up the
 

2831
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:36,230
point of where you add up the
circumstances and you see this seems

2832
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:36,240
circumstances and you see this seems
 

2833
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,329
circumstances and you see this seems
pretty pretty likely I mean if we're

2834
00:59:38,329 --> 00:59:38,339
pretty pretty likely I mean if we're
 

2835
00:59:38,339 --> 00:59:40,609
pretty pretty likely I mean if we're
getting to a hundred percent we are not

2836
00:59:40,609 --> 00:59:40,619
getting to a hundred percent we are not
 

2837
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:42,829
getting to a hundred percent we are not
at a hundred percent by any means there

2838
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:42,839
at a hundred percent by any means there
 

2839
00:59:42,839 --> 00:59:45,170
at a hundred percent by any means there
still is a possibility of a natural

2840
00:59:45,170 --> 00:59:45,180
still is a possibility of a natural
 

2841
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:47,510
still is a possibility of a natural
origin and if we find that great but

2842
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:47,520
origin and if we find that great but
 

2843
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,910
origin and if we find that great but
from everything that I know that's how I

2844
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:49,920
from everything that I know that's how I
 

2845
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,670
from everything that I know that's how I
get to my 85. and we'll talk about the

2846
00:59:52,670 --> 00:59:52,680
get to my 85. and we'll talk about the
 

2847
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:55,670
get to my 85. and we'll talk about the
why this matters in the political sense

2848
00:59:55,670 --> 00:59:55,680
why this matters in the political sense
 

2849
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,730
why this matters in the political sense
in the human sense in a science in the

2850
00:59:58,730 --> 00:59:58,740
in the human sense in a science in the
 

2851
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:00,530
in the human sense in a science in the
realm of science all of those factors

2852
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:00,540
realm of science all of those factors
 

2853
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:03,349
realm of science all of those factors
but uh first as Nietzsche said let us

2854
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:03,359
but uh first as Nietzsche said let us
 

2855
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:05,329
but uh first as Nietzsche said let us
look into the abyss and the games will

2856
01:00:05,329 --> 01:00:05,339
look into the abyss and the games will
 

2857
01:00:05,339 --> 01:00:08,089
look into the abyss and the games will
play with monsters that is uh

2858
01:00:08,089 --> 01:00:08,099
play with monsters that is uh
 

2859
01:00:08,099 --> 01:00:09,950
play with monsters that is uh
colloquially called gain of function

01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:09,960
colloquially called gain of function

research

2862
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:12,119
research
 

2863
01:00:12,119 --> 01:00:13,910
research
let me ask the kind of political

2864
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:13,920
let me ask the kind of political
 

2865
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,470
let me ask the kind of political
sounding question which is how people

2866
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:15,480
sounding question which is how people
 

2867
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:20,510
sounding question which is how people
usually phrase it did Anthony fauci

2868
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:20,520
usually phrase it did Anthony fauci
 

2869
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:24,530
usually phrase it did Anthony fauci
uh fund gain of function research at the

2870
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:24,540
uh fund gain of function research at the
 

2871
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:27,470
uh fund gain of function research at the
Wuhan Institute of virology so it

2872
01:00:27,470 --> 01:00:27,480
Wuhan Institute of virology so it
 

2873
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:30,230
Wuhan Institute of virology so it
depends I mean I've obviously been very

2874
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:30,240
depends I mean I've obviously been very
 

2875
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,390
depends I mean I've obviously been very
closely monitoring this I've spoken a

2876
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:32,400
closely monitoring this I've spoken a
 

2877
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,030
closely monitoring this I've spoken a
lot about it I've written about it and

2878
01:00:35,030 --> 01:00:35,040
lot about it I've written about it and
 

2879
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,490
lot about it I've written about it and
it depends on I mean not to quote Bill

2880
01:00:37,490 --> 01:00:37,500
it depends on I mean not to quote Bill
 

2881
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,530
it depends on I mean not to quote Bill
Clinton but to quote Bill Clinton it

2882
01:00:39,530 --> 01:00:39,540
Clinton but to quote Bill Clinton it
 

2883
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:41,390
Clinton but to quote Bill Clinton it
depends on what the definition of is is

2884
01:00:41,390 --> 01:00:41,400
depends on what the definition of is is
 

2885
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:44,930
depends on what the definition of is is
and so if you use a common sense

2886
01:00:44,930 --> 01:00:44,940
and so if you use a common sense
 

2887
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:47,089
and so if you use a common sense
definition of gain of function and by

2888
01:00:47,089 --> 01:00:47,099
definition of gain of function and by
 

2889
01:00:47,099 --> 01:00:48,650
definition of gain of function and by
gain a function there are lots of things

2890
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:48,660
gain a function there are lots of things
 

2891
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:49,970
gain a function there are lots of things
like Gene therapies that are going to

2892
01:00:49,970 --> 01:00:49,980
like Gene therapies that are going to
 

2893
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:52,250
like Gene therapies that are going to
function but here what we mean is gain a

2894
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:52,260
function but here what we mean is gain a
 

2895
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:55,970
function but here what we mean is gain a
function for uh pathogens able

2896
01:00:55,970 --> 01:00:55,980
function for uh pathogens able
 

2897
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:58,690
function for uh pathogens able
potentially able to create human

2898
01:00:58,690 --> 01:00:58,700
potentially able to create human
 

2899
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:01,430
potentially able to create human
pandemics but if you use the kind of

2900
01:01:01,430 --> 01:01:01,440
pandemics but if you use the kind of
 

2901
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:04,670
pandemics but if you use the kind of
Common Sense language and well then he

2902
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:04,680
Common Sense language and well then he
 

2903
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:07,069
Common Sense language and well then he
probably did if you use the technical

2904
01:01:07,069 --> 01:01:07,079
probably did if you use the technical
 

2905
01:01:07,079 --> 01:01:12,170
probably did if you use the technical
language from a 2017 NIH document and

2906
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:12,180
language from a 2017 NIH document and
 

2907
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:15,109
language from a 2017 NIH document and
you read that language very narrowly I

2908
01:01:15,109 --> 01:01:15,119
you read that language very narrowly I
 

2909
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:17,210
you read that language very narrowly I
think you can make a credible argument

2910
01:01:17,210 --> 01:01:17,220
think you can make a credible argument
 

2911
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:20,030
think you can make a credible argument
that he that he did not there's a

2912
01:01:20,030 --> 01:01:20,040
that he that he did not there's a
 

2913
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:22,370
that he that he did not there's a
question though and and Francis Collins

2914
01:01:22,370 --> 01:01:22,380
question though and and Francis Collins
 

2915
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:24,289
question though and and Francis Collins
talked about that in his in his

2916
01:01:24,289 --> 01:01:24,299
talked about that in his in his
 

2917
01:01:24,299 --> 01:01:26,210
talked about that in his in his
interview with you but then there's a

2918
01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:26,220
interview with you but then there's a
 

2919
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:29,210
interview with you but then there's a
question that we know from now that we

2920
01:01:29,210 --> 01:01:29,220
question that we know from now that we
 

2921
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:31,069
question that we know from now that we
have the information of the reports

2922
01:01:31,069 --> 01:01:31,079
have the information of the reports
 

2923
01:01:31,079 --> 01:01:34,190
have the information of the reports
submitted by equal Health Alliance to

2924
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:34,200
submitted by equal Health Alliance to
 

2925
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:37,010
submitted by equal Health Alliance to
the the NIH and some of which were late

2926
01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:37,020
the the NIH and some of which were late
 

2927
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:40,010
the the NIH and some of which were late
or not even delivered that some of this

2928
01:01:40,010 --> 01:01:40,020
or not even delivered that some of this
 

2929
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:42,910
or not even delivered that some of this
research was done on MERS Middle Eastern

2930
01:01:42,910 --> 01:01:42,920
research was done on MERS Middle Eastern
 

2931
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:46,849
research was done on MERS Middle Eastern
respiratory syndrome virus and if that

2932
01:01:46,849 --> 01:01:46,859
respiratory syndrome virus and if that
 

2933
01:01:46,859 --> 01:01:48,230
respiratory syndrome virus and if that
was the case

2934
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:48,240
was the case
 

2935
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:49,910
was the case
um there is a I think a colorable

2936
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:49,920
um there is a I think a colorable
 

2937
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:53,630
um there is a I think a colorable
argument that that would be considered

2938
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:53,640
argument that that would be considered
 

2939
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:56,809
argument that that would be considered
gain of function research even by the

2940
01:01:56,809 --> 01:01:56,819
gain of function research even by the
 

2941
01:01:56,819 --> 01:01:59,329
gain of function research even by the
narrow language of that 2017 document

2942
01:01:59,329 --> 01:01:59,339
narrow language of that 2017 document
 

2943
01:01:59,339 --> 01:02:01,910
narrow language of that 2017 document
but I but I I definitely think and I've

2944
01:02:01,910 --> 01:02:01,920
but I but I I definitely think and I've
 

2945
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:05,150
but I but I I definitely think and I've
said this repeatedly that Rand Paul can

2946
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:05,160
said this repeatedly that Rand Paul can
 

2947
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:08,510
said this repeatedly that Rand Paul can
be right and Tony fauci can be right and

2948
01:02:08,510 --> 01:02:08,520
be right and Tony fauci can be right and
 

2949
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:10,309
be right and Tony fauci can be right and
the question is

2950
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:10,319
the question is
 

2951
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:12,230
the question is
um what how are we defining gain a

2952
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:12,240
um what how are we defining gain a
 

2953
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:13,430
um what how are we defining gain a
function and that's why I've always said

2954
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:13,440
function and that's why I've always said
 

2955
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:16,250
function and that's why I've always said
the question in my mind isn't was it or

2956
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:16,260
the question in my mind isn't was it or
 

2957
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:18,529
the question in my mind isn't was it or
wasn't it gain of function as if that's

2958
01:02:18,529 --> 01:02:18,539
wasn't it gain of function as if that's
 

2959
01:02:18,539 --> 01:02:22,490
wasn't it gain of function as if that's
like a binary thing if if not grade and

2960
01:02:22,490 --> 01:02:22,500
like a binary thing if if not grade and
 

2961
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:25,730
like a binary thing if if not grade and
if yes guilty the question is just what

2962
01:02:25,730 --> 01:02:25,740
if yes guilty the question is just what
 

2963
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:27,349
if yes guilty the question is just what
work was being done at the Wuhan

2964
01:02:27,349 --> 01:02:27,359
work was being done at the Wuhan
 

2965
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:31,130
work was being done at the Wuhan
Institute of virology what role if any

2966
01:02:31,130 --> 01:02:31,140
Institute of virology what role if any
 

2967
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:34,750
Institute of virology what role if any
did U.S government funding play in

2968
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:34,760
did U.S government funding play in
 

2969
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:37,609
did U.S government funding play in
supporting that that work and what

2970
01:02:37,609 --> 01:02:37,619
supporting that that work and what
 

2971
01:02:37,619 --> 01:02:40,910
supporting that that work and what
rights do we all have as as as human

2972
01:02:40,910 --> 01:02:40,920
rights do we all have as as as human
 

2973
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:42,770
rights do we all have as as as human
beings and as American citizens and

2974
01:02:42,770 --> 01:02:42,780

01:02:49,130 --> 01:02:49,140
information about them so let's try to
 

2979
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,029
information about them so let's try to
kind of

2980

kind of
 

2981
01:02:50,039 --> 01:02:52,789
kind of
dissect this so who frustrates you more

2982
01:02:52,789 --> 01:02:52,799
dissect this so who frustrates you more
 

2983
01:02:52,799 --> 01:02:54,410
dissect this so who frustrates you more

function
 

2991
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:05,329
function
is a term that's kind of more used

2992
01:03:05,329 --> 01:03:05,339
is a term that's kind of more used
 

2993

uh just to mean
 

2995
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:11,329
uh just to mean
making uh playing with viruses in the

2996
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:11,339
making uh playing with viruses in the
 

2997
01:03:11,339 --> 01:03:14,089
making uh playing with viruses in the
lab to try to develop more dangerous

01:03:19,069 --> 01:03:19,079
is this uh kind of research
 

3003
01:03:19,079 --> 01:03:19,789
is this uh kind of research
um

3004
01:03:19,789 --> 01:03:19,799
um
 

3005
01:03:19,799 --> 01:03:22,010
um
a good idea

3006
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:22,020
a good idea
 

3007
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:25,430
a good idea
is it also a good idea for us to talk

3008
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:25,440
is it also a good idea for us to talk
 

3009
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,130
is it also a good idea for us to talk
about it in public in the political way

3010
01:03:28,130 --> 01:03:28,140
about it in public in the political way
 

3011
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:31,630
about it in public in the political way
that has been talked about is it okay

3012
01:03:31,630 --> 01:03:31,640
that has been talked about is it okay

that
um

3016
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:33,920
um
 

3017
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:37,069
um
us may have funded gain of function

3018
01:03:37,069 --> 01:03:37,079
us may have funded gain of function
 

3019
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:40,130
us may have funded gain of function
research elsewhere I mean it's kind of

3020
01:03:40,130 --> 01:03:40,140
research elsewhere I mean it's kind of
 

3021
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:41,270
research elsewhere I mean it's kind of
assumed

3022
01:03:41,270 --> 01:03:41,280
assumed
 

3023
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,430

uh just like with Bill Clinton

uh just like with Bill Clinton
 

3025
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:46,309
uh just like with Bill Clinton
there was very little discussion of uh I

3026
01:03:46,309 --> 01:03:46,319
there was very little discussion of uh I
 

3027
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:48,890
there was very little discussion of uh I
think correct me if I'm wrong but you

01:03:48,890 --> 01:03:48,900
think correct me if I'm wrong but you
 

3029
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:52,370
think correct me if I'm wrong but you
know whether it's okay for a president

3030
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:52,380
know whether it's okay for a president
 

3031

it was more the discussion of lying I

3044
01:04:11,809 --> 01:04:11,819
it was more the discussion of lying I
 

3045
01:04:11,819 --> 01:04:14,750
it was more the discussion of lying I
think it was did you did you lie about

3046

having sex or not and in this gain of
 

3049
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,609
having sex or not and in this gain of
function discussion what frustrates me

3050
01:04:19,609 --> 01:04:19,619
function discussion what frustrates me
 

3051
01:04:19,619 --> 01:04:21,589
function discussion what frustrates me
personally is there's not a deep

3052
01:04:21,589 --> 01:04:21,599
personally is there's not a deep
 

3053
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:23,569
personally is there's not a deep
philosophical discussion about whether

3054
01:04:23,569 --> 01:04:23,579
philosophical discussion about whether
 

3055
01:04:23,579 --> 01:04:25,370
philosophical discussion about whether
we should be doing this kind of research

3056
01:04:25,370 --> 01:04:25,380
we should be doing this kind of research
 

3057
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:29,750
we should be doing this kind of research
and what kinds like what are the ethical

3058
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:29,760
and what kinds like what are the ethical
 

3059
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:32,690

lines research on animals at all those

3060
01:04:32,690 --> 01:04:32,700
lines research on animals at all those
 

3061
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:35,270
lines research on animals at all those
are fascinating questions instead it's a

3062
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:35,280
are fascinating questions instead it's a
 

3063
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:38,630
are fascinating questions instead it's a
gotcha thing did you or did you not fund

3064
01:04:38,630 --> 01:04:38,640
gotcha thing did you or did you not fund
 

3065
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:41,930
gotcha thing did you or did you not fund
research and gain a function and did you

3066
01:04:41,930 --> 01:04:41,940
research and gain a function and did you
 

3067
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:44,089
research and gain a function and did you
fund it's almost like a bio weapon did

3068
01:04:44,089 --> 01:04:44,099
fund it's almost like a bio weapon did
 

3069
01:04:44,099 --> 01:04:45,049
fund it's almost like a bio weapon did
you give

3070
01:04:45,049 --> 01:04:45,059
you give
 

3071
01:04:45,059 --> 01:04:47,569
you give
money to China to develop this bio

3072
01:04:47,569 --> 01:04:47,579
money to China to develop this bio
 

3073

weapon that now attacked the rest of the
 

3075
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:52,250

world so I mean all all those things are

3076
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:52,260
world so I mean all all those things are
 

3077
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:54,890
world so I mean all all those things are
pretty frustrating but is there um

3078
01:04:54,890 --> 01:04:54,900
pretty frustrating but is there um
 

3079
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:57,650
pretty frustrating but is there um
I think the thing you can untangle about

3080
01:04:57,650 --> 01:04:57,660
I think the thing you can untangle about
 

3081
01:04:57,660 --> 01:04:59,390
I think the thing you can untangle about

sure so on gain function there actually

3092
01:05:11,569 --> 01:05:11,579
sure so on gain function there actually
 

3093
01:05:11,579 --> 01:05:14,690
sure so on gain function there actually
has been a lot of of debate and I

01:05:28,730 --> 01:05:28,740
um he led a thing called the Cambridge
 

3107
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:31,849
um he led a thing called the Cambridge
group uh that was highly critical of

3108
01:05:31,849 --> 01:05:31,859
group uh that was highly critical of
 

3109
01:05:31,859 --> 01:05:33,650
group uh that was highly critical of
this work but basically saying we're

3110
01:05:33,650 --> 01:05:33,660
this work but basically saying we're
 

3111
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:36,529
this work but basically saying we're
we're creating monsters they had the

3112
01:05:36,529 --> 01:05:36,539
we're creating monsters they had the
 

3113
01:05:36,539 --> 01:05:39,710
we're creating monsters they had the
funding pause in 2014 and they spent

3114
01:05:39,710 --> 01:05:39,720
funding pause in 2014 and they spent
 

3115
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:42,349
funding pause in 2014 and they spent
three years putting together a framework

3116
01:05:42,349 --> 01:05:42,359
three years putting together a framework
 

3117
01:05:42,359 --> 01:05:45,529
three years putting together a framework
and then they they lifted it in 2017. so

3118
01:05:45,529 --> 01:05:45,539
and then they they lifted it in 2017. so
 

3119
01:05:45,539 --> 01:05:46,750
and then they they lifted it in 2017. so
we had a thoughtful conversation

3120
01:05:46,750 --> 01:05:46,760
we had a thoughtful conversation
 

3121
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:49,190
we had a thoughtful conversation
unfortunately it didn't work and I think

3122
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:49,200
unfortunately it didn't work and I think
 

3123
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,650
unfortunately it didn't work and I think
that's where where we are now so I

3124
01:05:51,650 --> 01:05:51,660
that's where where we are now so I
 

3125
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:53,329
that's where where we are now so I
absolutely think

3126
01:05:53,329 --> 01:05:53,339
absolutely think
 

3127
01:05:53,339 --> 01:05:56,270
absolutely think
um that there are real issues with the

3128
01:05:56,270 --> 01:05:56,280
um that there are real issues with the
 

3129
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:57,950
um that there are real issues with the
relationship between the United States

through that Eco Health Alliance with
 

3135
01:06:03,299 --> 01:06:06,170
through that Eco Health Alliance with
the Wuhan Institute of virology and one

3136
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:06,180
the Wuhan Institute of virology and one
 

3137
01:06:06,180 --> 01:06:08,210
the Wuhan Institute of virology and one
issue is just essential transparency

3138
01:06:08,210 --> 01:06:08,220
issue is just essential transparency
 

3139
01:06:08,220 --> 01:06:10,490
issue is just essential transparency
because as I see it it's most likely the

3140
01:06:10,490 --> 01:06:10,500
because as I see it it's most likely the
 

3141
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:12,589
because as I see it it's most likely the
case that we transferred a lot of our

3142
01:06:12,589 --> 01:06:12,599
case that we transferred a lot of our
 

3143
01:06:12,599 --> 01:06:15,049
case that we transferred a lot of our
knowledge and plans and things to the

3144
01:06:15,049 --> 01:06:15,059
knowledge and plans and things to the
 

3145
01:06:15,059 --> 01:06:17,270
knowledge and plans and things to the
Wuhan Institute of virology and again

3146
01:06:17,270 --> 01:06:17,280
Wuhan Institute of virology and again
 

3147
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:22,010
Wuhan Institute of virology and again
I'm sure that shojiang Li is not herself

3148
01:06:22,010 --> 01:06:22,020
I'm sure that shojiang Li is not herself
 

3149
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:24,529
I'm sure that shojiang Li is not herself
a monster I'm sure of that even though

3150
01:06:24,529 --> 01:06:24,539
a monster I'm sure of that even though
 

3151
01:06:24,539 --> 01:06:25,750
a monster I'm sure of that even though
I've never met her

3152
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:25,760
I've never met her
 

3153
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:28,789
I've never met her
but there are just a different set of

3154
01:06:28,789 --> 01:06:28,799
but there are just a different set of
 

3155
01:06:28,799 --> 01:06:30,470
but there are just a different set of
pressures on people working in an

3156
01:06:30,470 --> 01:06:30,480
pressures on people working in an
 

3157
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,450
pressures on people working in an
authoritarian system than people who are

3158
01:06:32,450 --> 01:06:32,460
authoritarian system than people who are
 

3159
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:33,770
authoritarian system than people who are
working in other systems that doesn't

3160
01:06:33,770 --> 01:06:33,780
working in other systems that doesn't
 

3161
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:36,289
working in other systems that doesn't
mean it's entirely entirely different

3162
01:06:36,289 --> 01:06:36,299
mean it's entirely entirely different
 

3163
01:06:36,299 --> 01:06:38,870
mean it's entirely entirely different
and so I absolutely think that we

3164
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:38,880
and so I absolutely think that we
 

3165
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,730
and so I absolutely think that we
shouldn't give one dollar

3166
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:40,740
shouldn't give one dollar
 

3167
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:43,010
shouldn't give one dollar
um to an organization and certainly a

3168
01:06:43,010 --> 01:06:43,020
um to an organization and certainly a
 

3169
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:44,750
um to an organization and certainly a
virology Institute where you don't have

3170
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:44,760
virology Institute where you don't have
 

3171
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:48,349
virology Institute where you don't have
full access to to their records to their

3172
01:06:48,349 --> 01:06:48,359
full access to to their records to their
 

3173
01:06:48,359 --> 01:06:50,750
full access to to their records to their
databases we don't know what work is is

3174
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:50,760
databases we don't know what work is is
 

3175
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:53,510
databases we don't know what work is is
is happening there and I think that we

3176
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:53,520
is happening there and I think that we
 

3177
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:55,130
is happening there and I think that we
need to have

3178
01:06:55,130 --> 01:06:55,140
need to have
 

3179
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:57,109
need to have
um that kind of full examination and

3180
01:06:57,109 --> 01:06:57,119
um that kind of full examination and
 

3181
01:06:57,119 --> 01:06:59,870
um that kind of full examination and
that's why so I understand what what Dr

3182
01:06:59,870 --> 01:06:59,880
that's why so I understand what what Dr
 

3183
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:02,450
that's why so I understand what what Dr
fauci is doing is saying Hey What I Hear

3184
01:07:02,450 --> 01:07:02,460
fauci is doing is saying Hey What I Hear
 

3185
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:03,950
fauci is doing is saying Hey What I Hear
Dr fat you think what I hear from you

3186
01:07:03,950 --> 01:07:03,960
Dr fat you think what I hear from you
 

3187
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:07,130
Dr fat you think what I hear from you
Rand Paul is you're accusing me of

3188
01:07:07,130 --> 01:07:07,140
Rand Paul is you're accusing me of
 

3189
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:09,470
Rand Paul is you're accusing me of
starting this pandemic and you're using

3190
01:07:09,470 --> 01:07:09,480
starting this pandemic and you're using
 

3191
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:11,569
starting this pandemic and you're using
gain of function as a proxy for that and

3192
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:11,579
gain of function as a proxy for that and
 

3193
01:07:11,579 --> 01:07:13,130
gain of function as a proxy for that and
we have in when there are Senate

3194
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:13,140
we have in when there are Senate
 

3195
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:14,870
we have in when there are Senate
hearings every Senator gets five minutes

3196
01:07:14,870 --> 01:07:14,880
hearings every Senator gets five minutes
 

3197
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:17,150
hearings every Senator gets five minutes
and the name of the game is to translate

3198
01:07:17,150 --> 01:07:17,160
and the name of the game is to translate
 

3199
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:20,210
and the name of the game is to translate
your five minutes into a clip that's

3200
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:20,220
your five minutes into a clip that's
 

3201
01:07:20,220 --> 01:07:23,029
your five minutes into a clip that's
going to run on the news and so I get

3202
01:07:23,029 --> 01:07:23,039
going to run on the news and so I get
 

3203
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:26,150
going to run on the news and so I get
that there is that kind of game gotcha

3204
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:26,160
that there is that kind of game gotcha
 

3205
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:29,329
that there is that kind of game gotcha
um but I also think that uh the Dr fauci

3206
01:07:29,329 --> 01:07:29,339
um but I also think that uh the Dr fauci
 

3207
01:07:29,339 --> 01:07:32,329
um but I also think that uh the Dr fauci
and the Nia the National Institute of

3208
01:07:32,329 --> 01:07:32,339
and the Nia the National Institute of

01:07:34,490 --> 01:07:34,500
allergy and infectious diseases and the
 

3211
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:37,250
allergy and infectious diseases and the
NIH should have been more transparent um

3212
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:37,260
NIH should have been more transparent um
 

3213
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:39,250
NIH should have been more transparent um
because I I think that

3214
01:07:39,250 --> 01:07:39,260
because I I think that
 

3215
01:07:39,260 --> 01:07:41,809
because I I think that
in this day and age where there are a

3216
01:07:41,809 --> 01:07:41,819
in this day and age where there are a
 

3217
01:07:41,819 --> 01:07:43,370
in this day and age where there are a
lot of people poking around and this

3218
01:07:43,370 --> 01:07:43,380
lot of people poking around and this
 

3219
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:45,710
lot of people poking around and this
whole story of coveted Origins uh we

3220
01:07:45,710 --> 01:07:45,720
whole story of coveted Origins uh we
 

3221
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:48,049
whole story of coveted Origins uh we
would not be where we are if it wasn't

3222
01:07:48,049 --> 01:07:48,059
would not be where we are if it wasn't
 

3223
01:07:48,059 --> 01:07:51,109
would not be where we are if it wasn't
for a relatively small number of people

3224
01:07:51,109 --> 01:07:51,119
for a relatively small number of people
 

3225
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:53,870
for a relatively small number of people

definitely mistakes were made on all
 

3259
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:33,229
definitely mistakes were made on all
sides and that's why for me from day one

01:08:33,229 --> 01:08:33,239
sides and that's why for me from day one
 

3261

investigation into this issue that
 

3265
01:08:39,299 --> 01:08:41,030
investigation into this issue that
certainly obviously looks at China but

3266
01:08:41,030 --> 01:08:41,040
certainly obviously looks at China but
 

3267
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:42,590
certainly obviously looks at China but
we have to look at ourselves we did not

01:09:11,149 --> 01:09:11,159
the complexity of all of this the
 

3291
01:09:11,159 --> 01:09:13,610
the complexity of all of this the
uncertainty in all of this yeah and and

3292
01:09:13,610 --> 01:09:13,620
uncertainty in all of this yeah and and
 

3293
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:16,550
uncertainty in all of this yeah and and
I get that it's really hard to do that

3294
01:09:16,550 --> 01:09:16,560
I get that it's really hard to do that
 

3295
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:20,329
I get that it's really hard to do that
because let's say you you have one you

3296
01:09:20,329 --> 01:09:20,339
because let's say you you have one you
 

3297
01:09:20,339 --> 01:09:21,890
because let's say you you have one you
speak a paragraph and it's got four

3298
01:09:21,890 --> 01:09:21,900
speak a paragraph and it's got four
 

3299
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:25,309
speak a paragraph and it's got four
sentences and one of those sentences is

3300
01:09:25,309 --> 01:09:25,319
sentences and one of those sentences is
 

3301
01:09:25,319 --> 01:09:26,809
sentences and one of those sentences is
the thing that's going to be turned into

3302
01:09:26,809 --> 01:09:26,819
the thing that's going to be turned into
 

3303
01:09:26,819 --> 01:09:28,789
the thing that's going to be turned into
Twitter and let me put it back I'll get

3304
01:09:28,789 --> 01:09:28,799
Twitter and let me put it back I'll get
 

3305
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:30,169
Twitter and let me put it back I'll get
really so

3306
01:09:30,169 --> 01:09:30,179
really so
 

3307
01:09:30,179 --> 01:09:32,209
really so
um I'll try not to be emotional about

3308
01:09:32,209 --> 01:09:32,219
um I'll try not to be emotional about
 

3309
01:09:32,219 --> 01:09:34,669
um I'll try not to be emotional about
this but I

3310
01:09:34,669 --> 01:09:34,679
this but I
 

3311
01:09:34,679 --> 01:09:39,410
this but I
I've heard uh Anthony fauci a couple of

3312
01:09:39,410 --> 01:09:39,420
I've heard uh Anthony fauci a couple of
 

3313
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:43,550
I've heard uh Anthony fauci a couple of
times now say that he represents science

3314
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:43,560

 

3315
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:46,849

I know what he means by that he means in

3316
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:46,859
I know what he means by that he means in
 

3317
01:09:46,859 --> 01:09:48,769
I know what he means by that he means in
this political bickering

3318
01:09:48,769 --> 01:09:48,779
this political bickering
 

3319
01:09:48,779 --> 01:09:51,769
this political bickering
all that kind of stuff that for a lot of

all that kind of stuff that for a lot of
 

3321
01:09:51,779 --> 01:09:54,830
all that kind of stuff that for a lot of
people he represents science

3322
01:09:54,830 --> 01:09:54,840
people he represents science
 

3323
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:57,470
people he represents science
but words matter and this isn't Just

3324
01:09:57,470 --> 01:09:57,480
but words matter and this isn't Just
 

3325

apologize for it
uh like if the words I represent science

3342
01:10:19,610 --> 01:10:19,620
uh like if the words I represent science
 

3343
01:10:19,620 --> 01:10:23,570
uh like if the words I represent science
left my mouth which they very well could

3344
01:10:23,570 --> 01:10:23,580
left my mouth which they very well could
 

3345

3355
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,110
little phrase I represent science
no Dr fauci you do not represent science

3356

no Dr fauci you do not represent science
 

3357
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:41,510
no Dr fauci you do not represent science
I love science the the millions of

3358
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:41,520
I love science the the millions of
 

3359
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:44,330
I love science the the millions of
scientists that inspired me to get into

3360
01:10:44,330 --> 01:10:44,340
scientists that inspired me to get into
 

3361
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:47,209
scientists that inspired me to get into
it is to fall in love with the

3362
01:10:47,209 --> 01:10:47,219
it is to fall in love with the
 

3363
01:10:47,219 --> 01:10:49,870
it is to fall in love with the
scientific method in the

3364
01:10:49,870 --> 01:10:49,880
scientific method in the
 

3365
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:52,910
scientific method in the
exploration of ideas through the rigor

3366
01:10:52,910 --> 01:10:52,920
exploration of ideas through the rigor
 

3367
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:55,669
exploration of ideas through the rigor
of science that Anthony fall she does

3368
01:10:55,669 --> 01:10:55,679
of science that Anthony fall she does
 

3369
01:10:55,679 --> 01:10:58,189
of science that Anthony fall she does
not represent he's one I believe great

3370
01:10:58,189 --> 01:10:58,199
not represent he's one I believe great
 

3371
01:10:58,199 --> 01:11:01,250
not represent he's one I believe great
scientist of millions he does not

3372
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:01,260
scientist of millions he does not
 

3373
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:04,310
scientist of millions he does not
represent anybody uh he's just one

3374
01:11:04,310 --> 01:11:04,320
represent anybody uh he's just one
 

3375
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:06,890
represent anybody uh he's just one
scientist and I think the greatness of a

3376
01:11:06,890 --> 01:11:06,900
scientist and I think the greatness of a
 

3377
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:09,890
scientist and I think the greatness of a
scientist is best exemplified in

3378
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:09,900
scientist is best exemplified in
 

3379
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:10,850
scientist is best exemplified in
humility

3380
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:10,860
humility
 

3381
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:13,610
humility
because the scientific method basically

3382
01:11:13,610 --> 01:11:13,620
because the scientific method basically
 

3383
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:14,510
because the scientific method basically
says

3384
01:11:14,510 --> 01:11:14,520
says
 

3385
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:17,149
says
like you're you're like standing before

3386
01:11:17,149 --> 01:11:17,159
like you're you're like standing before
 

3387
01:11:17,159 --> 01:11:20,570
like you're you're like standing before
the fog the mystery of it all and like

the fog the mystery of it all and like
 

3389
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:23,750
the fog the mystery of it all and like
slowly chipping away at the mystery and

3390
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:23,760
slowly chipping away at the mystery and
 

3391
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:25,729
slowly chipping away at the mystery and
the it's it's like it's embarrassing

3392
01:11:25,729 --> 01:11:25,739
the it's it's like it's embarrassing
 

3393
01:11:25,739 --> 01:11:28,430
the it's it's like it's embarrassing
it's uh humiliating how little you know

3394
01:11:28,430 --> 01:11:28,440
it's uh humiliating how little you know
 

3395
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:31,130
it's uh humiliating how little you know
that's the experience so the the great

3396
01:11:31,130 --> 01:11:31,140
that's the experience so the the great
 

3397
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:33,350
that's the experience so the the great
scientists have to have humility to me

3398
01:11:33,350 --> 01:11:33,360
scientists have to have humility to me
 

3399
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:35,270
scientists have to have humility to me
and especially in their communication

3400

the complexity of the uncertainty you're

3420
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:03,120
the complexity of the uncertainty you're
 

3421
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:06,050
the complexity of the uncertainty you're
operating under be humble in the face of

operating under be humble in the face of
not being able to predict the future or

3427
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:12,290
understand the past or really know
what's the right thing to do but we have

3428
01:12:12,290 --> 01:12:12,300
what's the right thing to do but we have
 

3429
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:14,630
what's the right thing to do but we have
to do something and through that you

3430
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:14,640
to do something and through that you
 

3431
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:15,470
to do something and through that you
have to

3432
01:12:15,470 --> 01:12:15,480
have to
 

3433
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:17,990
have to
be a great leader that inspires action

3434
01:12:17,990 --> 01:12:18,000
be a great leader that inspires action
 

3435
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,630
be a great leader that inspires action
and some of that is just words and he

3436
01:12:20,630 --> 01:12:20,640
and some of that is just words and he
 

3437
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:24,470
and some of that is just words and he
chose words poorly I I mean I so I I'm

3438
01:12:24,470 --> 01:12:24,480
chose words poorly I I mean I so I I'm
 

3439
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:25,970
chose words poorly I I mean I so I I'm
all torn about this and then there's

3440
01:12:25,970 --> 01:12:25,980
all torn about this and then there's
 

3441
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:28,070
all torn about this and then there's
politicians they're taking those words

3442
01:12:28,070 --> 01:12:28,080
politicians they're taking those words
 

3443
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:30,830
politicians they're taking those words
and magnifying them and playing games

3444
01:12:30,830 --> 01:12:30,840
and magnifying them and playing games
 

3445
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:33,649
and magnifying them and playing games
with them and of course that's a

with them and of course that's a
disincentive for the people who do the

3448
01:12:36,590 --> 01:12:36,600
disincentive for the people who do the

to say any more words so they kind of

3454
01:12:42,410 --> 01:12:42,420
to say any more words so they kind of
 

3455
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:44,330
to say any more words so they kind of
become more conservative with the the

3456

become more conservative with the the
 

3457
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:46,610
become more conservative with the the

3459
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:49,370
words they use I mean it just becomes a
giant mess but I think the solution

3460
01:12:49,370 --> 01:12:49,380
giant mess but I think the solution
 

3461
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:53,149
giant mess but I think the solution
is to ignore all of that and to be

3462
01:12:53,149 --> 01:12:53,159
is to ignore all of that and to be
 

3463
01:12:53,159 --> 01:12:55,610
is to ignore all of that and to be
transparent to be honest to be

3464
01:12:55,610 --> 01:12:55,620
transparent to be honest to be
 

3465

probing this issue people were hiding
behind this kind of false uh consensus

behind this kind of false uh consensus
 

3641
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:28,669
behind this kind of false uh consensus

wasn't as balanced on the issue of of
covet Origins certainly Dr fauci could

3650
01:16:40,070 --> 01:16:40,080
covet Origins certainly Dr fauci could
 

3651
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:42,169
covet Origins certainly Dr fauci could
have in his conversation with Rand Paul

3652
01:16:42,169 --> 01:16:42,179
have in his conversation with Rand Paul
 

3653
01:16:42,179 --> 01:16:44,330
have in his conversation with Rand Paul
it wasn't even a conversation but in

3654
01:16:44,330 --> 01:16:44,340
it wasn't even a conversation but in
 

3655
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:46,970
it wasn't even a conversation but in
some process in the aftermath could have

3656
01:16:46,970 --> 01:16:46,980
some process in the aftermath could have
 

3657
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:49,130
some process in the aftermath could have
laid things out a bit better he did say

3658
01:16:49,130 --> 01:16:49,140
laid things out a bit better he did say
 

3659
01:16:49,140 --> 01:16:51,410
laid things out a bit better he did say
in Francis Collins did say that we don't

3660
01:16:51,410 --> 01:16:51,420
in Francis Collins did say that we don't
 

3661
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:53,810
in Francis Collins did say that we don't
know the origins and that was a shift

3662
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:53,820
know the origins and that was a shift
 

3663
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:55,310
know the origins and that was a shift
um uh and we need to have an

3664

3665
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:57,950
um uh and we need to have an
investigation so now

investigation so now
um but having said all of that I do kind

3668
01:17:01,550 --> 01:17:01,560
um but having said all of that I do kind
 

3669
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:04,490
um but having said all of that I do kind
of one I have tremendous respect for Dr

3670
01:17:04,490 --> 01:17:04,500
of one I have tremendous respect for Dr
 

3671
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:06,350
of one I have tremendous respect for Dr
fauci for the work that he's done on HIV

3672
01:17:06,350 --> 01:17:06,360
fauci for the work that he's done on HIV
 

3673
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:08,930
fauci for the work that he's done on HIV
AIDS I mean I have been vaccinated with

3674
01:17:08,930 --> 01:17:08,940
AIDS I mean I have been vaccinated with
 

3675
01:17:08,940 --> 01:17:12,290
AIDS I mean I have been vaccinated with
the moderna vaccine uh Dr fauci was a

3676
01:17:12,290 --> 01:17:12,300
the moderna vaccine uh Dr fauci was a
 

3677
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:14,810
the moderna vaccine uh Dr fauci was a
big part of the story of getting us

3678
01:17:14,810 --> 01:17:14,820
big part of the story of getting us
 

3679
01:17:14,820 --> 01:17:17,330
big part of the story of getting us
these vaccines that have saved millions

3680
01:17:17,330 --> 01:17:17,340
these vaccines that have saved millions
 

3681
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:20,330
these vaccines that have saved millions
and millions of of lives and so I I

3682
01:17:20,330 --> 01:17:20,340
and millions of of lives and so I I
 

3683
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:22,250
and millions of of lives and so I I
don't think I mean there's a lot to this

3684
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:22,260
don't think I mean there's a lot to this
 

3685
01:17:22,260 --> 01:17:25,189
don't think I mean there's a lot to this
story and then the second thing is it's

3686
01:17:25,189 --> 01:17:25,199
story and then the second thing is it's
 

3687
01:17:25,199 --> 01:17:28,430
story and then the second thing is it's
really hard to be a public health expert

3688
01:17:28,430 --> 01:17:28,440
really hard to be a public health expert
 

3689
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:31,550
really hard to be a public health expert
because you have your mission is public

3690
01:17:31,550 --> 01:17:31,560
because you have your mission is public
 

3691
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:34,669
because you have your mission is public
health and so and you have to if you are

3692
01:17:34,669 --> 01:17:34,679
health and so and you have to if you are
 

3693
01:17:34,679 --> 01:17:37,669
health and so and you have to if you are
leading with all of your uncertainty

3694
01:17:37,669 --> 01:17:37,679
leading with all of your uncertainty
 

3695
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:40,490
leading with all of your uncertainty
um it's a really hard way to do things

3696
01:17:40,490 --> 01:17:40,500
um it's a really hard way to do things
 

3697
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:43,130
um it's a really hard way to do things
and so like even now like if I go to CVS

3698
01:17:43,130 --> 01:17:43,140
and so like even now like if I go to CVS
 

3699
01:17:43,140 --> 01:17:46,610
and so like even now like if I go to CVS
and I and I get a Tylenol somebody has

3700
01:17:46,610 --> 01:17:46,620
and I and I get a Tylenol somebody has
 

3701
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:49,010
and I and I get a Tylenol somebody has
done a calculation of how many people

3702
01:17:49,010 --> 01:17:49,020
done a calculation of how many people
 

3703
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:51,830
done a calculation of how many people
will die from taking Tylenol and they

3704
01:17:51,830 --> 01:17:51,840
will die from taking Tylenol and they
 

3705
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:54,590
will die from taking Tylenol and they
say well we can live with that and

3706
01:17:54,590 --> 01:17:54,600
say well we can live with that and
 

3707
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:56,870
say well we can live with that and
that's why we have regulation and so all

3708
01:17:56,870 --> 01:17:56,880
that's why we have regulation and so all
 

3709
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:59,450
that's why we have regulation and so all
of us are doing kind of summaries and

3710
01:17:59,450 --> 01:17:59,460
of us are doing kind of summaries and
 

3711
01:17:59,460 --> 01:18:00,830
of us are doing kind of summaries and
then we have people in public health who

3712
01:18:00,830 --> 01:18:00,840
then we have people in public health who
 

3713
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:02,950
then we have people in public health who
are saying well we've summed it all up

3714
01:18:02,950 --> 01:18:02,960
are saying well we've summed it all up
 

3715
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:05,630
are saying well we've summed it all up
and you should do X you should get your

3716
01:18:05,630 --> 01:18:05,640
and you should do X you should get your
 

3717
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:09,890
and you should do X you should get your
kids you know vaccinated for measles you

3718
01:18:09,890 --> 01:18:09,900
kids you know vaccinated for measles you
 

3719
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:12,290
kids you know vaccinated for measles you
should not drive your car at 100 miles

3720
01:18:12,290 --> 01:18:12,300
should not drive your car at 100 miles
 

3721
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:14,390
should not drive your car at 100 miles
an hour you you should don't drink

3722
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:14,400
an hour you you should don't drink
 

3723
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,910
an hour you you should don't drink
lighter fluid whatever these these

3724
01:18:16,910 --> 01:18:16,920
lighter fluid whatever these these
 

3725
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:19,250
lighter fluid whatever these these
things are and we want them to kind of

3726
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:19,260
things are and we want them to kind of
 

3727
01:18:19,260 --> 01:18:22,729
things are and we want them to kind of
give us broad guidelines and yet now our

3728
01:18:22,729 --> 01:18:22,739
give us broad guidelines and yet now our
 

3729
01:18:22,739 --> 01:18:25,490
give us broad guidelines and yet now our
information world is so fragmented that

3730
01:18:25,490 --> 01:18:25,500
information world is so fragmented that
 

3731
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:29,090
information world is so fragmented that
if you if you're not being honest about

3732
01:18:29,090 --> 01:18:29,100
if you if you're not being honest about
 

3733
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:31,250
if you if you're not being honest about
something that something material

3734
01:18:31,250 --> 01:18:31,260
something that something material
 

3735
01:18:31,260 --> 01:18:33,649
something that something material
someone's going to find out and it's

3736
01:18:33,649 --> 01:18:33,659
someone's going to find out and it's
 

3737
01:18:33,659 --> 01:18:35,270
someone's going to find out and it's
going to undermine your credibility and

3738
01:18:35,270 --> 01:18:35,280
going to undermine your credibility and
 

3739
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:39,470
going to undermine your credibility and
so I agree with you that that there is a

3740
01:18:39,470 --> 01:18:39,480
so I agree with you that that there is a
 

3741
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:42,830
so I agree with you that that there is a
greater requirement for transparency now

3742
01:18:42,830 --> 01:18:42,840
greater requirement for transparency now
 

3743
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:44,870
greater requirement for transparency now
maybe there always has been but there's

3744
01:18:44,870 --> 01:18:44,880
maybe there always has been but there's
 

3745
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:48,350
maybe there always has been but there's
an even greater requirement for it now

3746
01:18:48,350 --> 01:18:48,360
an even greater requirement for it now
 

3747
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:49,930
an even greater requirement for it now
because

3748
01:18:49,930 --> 01:18:49,940
because
 

3749
01:18:49,940 --> 01:18:52,790
because
people want to trust that you're

3750
01:18:52,790 --> 01:18:52,800
people want to trust that you're
 

3751
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,470
people want to trust that you're
speaking honestly and that you're saying

3752
01:18:54,470 --> 01:18:54,480
speaking honestly and that you're saying
 

3753
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,930
speaking honestly and that you're saying
well here's what I know and this is

3754
01:18:56,930 --> 01:18:56,940
well here's what I know and this is
 

3755
01:18:56,940 --> 01:18:58,669
well here's what I know and this is
based on what I know here are the

3756
01:18:58,669 --> 01:18:58,679
based on what I know here are the
 

3757
01:18:58,679 --> 01:19:01,430
based on what I know here are the
conclusions that I draw but if it's just

3758
01:19:01,430 --> 01:19:01,440
conclusions that I draw but if it's just
 

3759
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:03,110
conclusions that I draw but if it's just
and and again I I don't I don't think

3760
01:19:03,110 --> 01:19:03,120
and and again I I don't I don't think
 

3761
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:05,390
and and again I I don't I don't think
the words I'm science or whatever it was

3762
01:19:05,390 --> 01:19:05,400
the words I'm science or whatever it was
 

3763
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:07,850
the words I'm science or whatever it was
are are the right words but if it's just

3764
01:19:07,850 --> 01:19:07,860
are are the right words but if it's just
 

3765
01:19:07,860 --> 01:19:11,209
are are the right words but if it's just
you know trust me because of who I am I

3766
01:19:11,209 --> 01:19:11,219
you know trust me because of who I am I
 

3767
01:19:11,219 --> 01:19:12,950
you know trust me because of who I am I
don't think that that flies anywhere

3768
01:19:12,950 --> 01:19:12,960
don't think that that flies anywhere
 

3769
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:14,510
don't think that that flies anywhere
anymore

3770
01:19:14,510 --> 01:19:14,520
anymore
 

3771
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:16,490
anymore
can I just ask you about the Francis

3772
01:19:16,490 --> 01:19:16,500
can I just ask you about the Francis
 

3773
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:19,010
can I just ask you about the Francis
Collins interview that I did if you got

3774
01:19:19,010 --> 01:19:19,020
Collins interview that I did if you got
 

3775
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:20,510
Collins interview that I did if you got
a chance to hear that part I think in

3776
01:19:20,510 --> 01:19:20,520
a chance to hear that part I think in
 

3777
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:21,709
a chance to hear that part I think in
the beginning we talk about the loud

3778
01:19:21,709 --> 01:19:21,719
the beginning we talk about the loud
 

3779
01:19:21,719 --> 01:19:23,450
the beginning we talk about the loud
leak

3780
01:19:23,450 --> 01:19:23,460
leak
 

3781
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:25,010
leak
um what are your thoughts about his

3782
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:25,020
um what are your thoughts about his
 

3783
01:19:25,020 --> 01:19:27,530
um what are your thoughts about his
response basically saying it's worthy of

3784
01:19:27,530 --> 01:19:27,540
response basically saying it's worthy of
 

3785
01:19:27,540 --> 01:19:30,830
response basically saying it's worthy of
an investigation but

3786
01:19:30,830 --> 01:19:30,840
an investigation but
 

3787
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:32,209
an investigation but
I mean I don't know how you would

3788
01:19:32,209 --> 01:19:32,219
I mean I don't know how you would
 

3789
01:19:32,219 --> 01:19:36,350
I mean I don't know how you would
interpret it I see it's funny because I

3790
01:19:36,350 --> 01:19:36,360
interpret it I see it's funny because I
 

3791
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:39,410
interpret it I see it's funny because I
I heard it in the moment

3792
01:19:39,410 --> 01:19:39,420
I heard it in the moment
 

3793
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:41,270
I heard it in the moment
as

3794
01:19:41,270 --> 01:19:41,280
as
 

3795
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:44,750
as
is great for the head of NIH to be

3796
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:44,760
is great for the head of NIH to be
 

3797
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:46,850
is great for the head of NIH to be
open-minded on this yeah

3798
01:19:46,850 --> 01:19:46,860
open-minded on this yeah
 

3799
01:19:46,860 --> 01:19:50,750
open-minded on this yeah
but then the internet and uh Mr Joe

3800
01:19:50,750 --> 01:19:50,760
but then the internet and uh Mr Joe
 

3801
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:52,490

colleagues
 

3805

colleagues
told me that yeah well that's

3806
01:19:56,450 --> 01:19:56,460
told me that yeah well that's
 

3807
01:19:56,460 --> 01:19:59,810
told me that yeah well that's
too late and too little yeah so first

01:19:59,810 --> 01:19:59,820
too late and too little yeah so first
 

3809
01:19:59,820 --> 01:20:02,390
too late and too little yeah so first
let me say I've been on Joe's podcast

3810
01:20:02,390 --> 01:20:02,400
let me say I've been on Joe's podcast
 

3811
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:04,850
let me say I've been on Joe's podcast
twice and I love the guy which doesn't

3812
01:20:04,850 --> 01:20:04,860
twice and I love the guy which doesn't
 

3813
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:07,550
twice and I love the guy which doesn't
mean that I agree with everything he

3814
01:20:07,550 --> 01:20:07,560
mean that I agree with everything he
 

3815
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:10,010

does or says
um and on this issue and I'm normally a

01:20:13,129 --> 01:20:13,139
um and on this issue and I'm normally a
 

3819
01:20:13,139 --> 01:20:15,770
um and on this issue and I'm normally a
pretty calm and measured guy and when

3820
01:20:15,770 --> 01:20:15,780
pretty calm and measured guy and when
 

3821
01:20:15,780 --> 01:20:17,810
pretty calm and measured guy and when
you're just out running with your

3822
01:20:17,810 --> 01:20:17,820
you're just out running with your
 

3823
01:20:17,820 --> 01:20:21,590
you're just out running with your
airpods on and you start yelling into

3824
01:20:21,590 --> 01:20:21,600
airpods on and you start yelling into
 

3825
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:24,770
airpods on and you start yelling into
the wind in Central Park nobody else

3826
01:20:24,770 --> 01:20:24,780
the wind in Central Park nobody else
 

3827
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:28,189
the wind in Central Park nobody else
knows why you're yelling but whether you

3828
01:20:28,189 --> 01:20:28,199
knows why you're yelling but whether you
 

3829
01:20:28,199 --> 01:20:30,290
knows why you're yelling but whether you
had such a moment I had a moment with

3830
01:20:30,290 --> 01:20:30,300
had such a moment I had a moment with
 

3831
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:31,970
had such a moment I had a moment with
Collins and again Francis Collins is

3832
01:20:31,970 --> 01:20:31,980
Collins and again Francis Collins is
 

3833
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:34,610
Collins and again Francis Collins is
someone I respect enormously I mean I

3834
01:20:34,610 --> 01:20:34,620
someone I respect enormously I mean I
 

3835
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:36,950
someone I respect enormously I mean I
live a big chunk of My Life

3836
01:20:36,950 --> 01:20:36,960
live a big chunk of My Life
 

3837
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:39,410
live a big chunk of My Life
um living in in the world of genetics

3838
01:20:39,410 --> 01:20:39,420
um living in in the world of genetics
 

3839
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:42,470
um living in in the world of genetics
and biotech and my book hacking Darwin

3840
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:42,480
and biotech and my book hacking Darwin
 

3841
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:44,149
and biotech and my book hacking Darwin
is about the future of human genetic

3842
01:20:44,149 --> 01:20:44,159
is about the future of human genetic
 

3843
01:20:44,159 --> 01:20:46,310
is about the future of human genetic
engineering and his work on the Human

3844
01:20:46,310 --> 01:20:46,320
engineering and his work on the Human
 

3845
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:48,350
engineering and his work on the Human
Genome Project and so many other things

3846
01:20:48,350 --> 01:20:48,360
Genome Project and so many other things
 

3847
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:50,510
Genome Project and so many other things
have been fantastic and I'm a huge fan

3848
01:20:50,510 --> 01:20:50,520
have been fantastic and I'm a huge fan
 

3849
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:53,870
have been fantastic and I'm a huge fan
of the work of uh of NIH and he was

3850
01:20:53,870 --> 01:20:53,880
of the work of uh of NIH and he was
 

3851
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:55,970
of the work of uh of NIH and he was
right to say that the Chinese government

3852
01:20:55,970 --> 01:20:55,980
right to say that the Chinese government
 

3853
01:20:55,980 --> 01:20:57,770
right to say that the Chinese government
hasn't been forthcoming and we need to

3854
01:20:57,770 --> 01:20:57,780
hasn't been forthcoming and we need to
 

3855
01:20:57,780 --> 01:21:00,410
hasn't been forthcoming and we need to
look into it but then you asked him well

3856
01:21:00,410 --> 01:21:00,420
look into it but then you asked him well
 

3857
01:21:00,420 --> 01:21:03,470
look into it but then you asked him well
how will we know and then his answer was

3858
01:21:03,470 --> 01:21:03,480
how will we know and then his answer was
 

3859
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:06,050
how will we know and then his answer was
we need to find the intermediate host

3860
01:21:06,050 --> 01:21:06,060
we need to find the intermediate host
 

3861
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:08,930
we need to find the intermediate host
remember I said before and so that made

3862
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:08,940
remember I said before and so that made
 

3863
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:11,689
remember I said before and so that made
it clear that he thought well we should

3864
01:21:11,689 --> 01:21:11,699
it clear that he thought well we should
 

3865
01:21:11,699 --> 01:21:14,629
it clear that he thought well we should
have an investigation but it comes from

3866
01:21:14,629 --> 01:21:14,639
have an investigation but it comes from
 

3867
01:21:14,639 --> 01:21:17,030
have an investigation but it comes from
nature and we just need to find that

3868
01:21:17,030 --> 01:21:17,040
nature and we just need to find that
 

3869
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:19,490
nature and we just need to find that
whatever it is that intermediate animal

3870
01:21:19,490 --> 01:21:19,500
whatever it is that intermediate animal
 

3871
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:22,430
whatever it is that intermediate animal
host in the wild and that'll tell us the

3872
01:21:22,430 --> 01:21:22,440
host in the wild and that'll tell us the
 

3873
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:24,470
host in the wild and that'll tell us the
story so here we had the conclusion in

3874
01:21:24,470 --> 01:21:24,480
story so here we had the conclusion in
 

3875
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,430
story so here we had the conclusion in
mind

3876
01:21:25,430 --> 01:21:25,440
mind
 

3877
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:27,229
mind
and they're just waiting for the

3878
01:21:27,229 --> 01:21:27,239
and they're just waiting for the
 

3879
01:21:27,239 --> 01:21:28,729
and they're just waiting for the
evidence to support the conclusion that

3880
01:21:28,729 --> 01:21:28,739
evidence to support the conclusion that
 

3881
01:21:28,739 --> 01:21:30,649
evidence to support the conclusion that
was my feeling I felt like he was and

3882
01:21:30,649 --> 01:21:30,659
was my feeling I felt like he was and
 

3883
01:21:30,659 --> 01:21:32,510
was my feeling I felt like he was and
that was frustrating in general but he

3884
01:21:32,510 --> 01:21:32,520
that was frustrating in general but he
 

3885
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:34,790
that was frustrating in general but he
was tilting and I again I used my your

3886
01:21:34,790 --> 01:21:34,800
was tilting and I again I used my your
 

3887
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:37,010
was tilting and I again I used my your
first question was where do I fall he

3888
01:21:37,010 --> 01:21:37,020
first question was where do I fall he
 

3889
01:21:37,020 --> 01:21:39,890
first question was where do I fall he
was like I'm 85 uh percent or whatever

3890
01:21:39,890 --> 01:21:39,900
was like I'm 85 uh percent or whatever
 

3891
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:43,010
was like I'm 85 uh percent or whatever
it is 80 75 90 whatever it is in the

3892
01:21:43,010 --> 01:21:43,020
it is 80 75 90 whatever it is in the
 

3893
01:21:43,020 --> 01:21:45,590
it is 80 75 90 whatever it is in the
direction of a lab incident it made it

3894
01:21:45,590 --> 01:21:45,600
direction of a lab incident it made it
 

3895
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:49,250
direction of a lab incident it made it
feel that he was 90 10 in the other

3896
01:21:49,250 --> 01:21:49,260
feel that he was 90 10 in the other
 

3897
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:51,530
feel that he was 90 10 in the other
direction which is still means that he's

3898
01:21:51,530 --> 01:21:51,540
direction which is still means that he's
 

3899
01:21:51,540 --> 01:21:54,350
direction which is still means that he's
open-minded about the possibility and

3900
01:21:54,350 --> 01:21:54,360
open-minded about the possibility and
 

3901
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:57,350
open-minded about the possibility and
that's why in my view every single

3902
01:21:57,350 --> 01:21:57,360
that's why in my view every single
 

3903
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:59,510
that's why in my view every single
person who talks about this issue

3904
01:21:59,510 --> 01:21:59,520
person who talks about this issue
 

3905
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:02,030
person who talks about this issue
meaning the right answer in my view is

3906
01:22:02,030 --> 01:22:02,040
meaning the right answer in my view is
 

3907
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:04,850
meaning the right answer in my view is
we don't know conclusively

3908
01:22:04,850 --> 01:22:04,860
we don't know conclusively
 

3909
01:22:04,860 --> 01:22:06,649
we don't know conclusively
um in my then this is my personal view

3910
01:22:06,649 --> 01:22:06,659

China

4466
01:33:43,790 --> 01:33:43,800
China
 

4467
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:46,729
China
the Chinese government I should say

4468
01:33:46,729 --> 01:33:46,739
the Chinese government I should say
 

4469
01:33:46,739 --> 01:33:49,189
the Chinese government I should say
but even China like there's this kind of

4470
01:33:49,189 --> 01:33:49,199
but even China like there's this kind of
 

4471
01:33:49,199 --> 01:33:52,189
but even China like there's this kind of
gray area that people just fall into

4472
01:33:52,189 --> 01:33:52,199
gray area that people just fall into
 

4473
01:33:52,199 --> 01:33:54,470
gray area that people just fall into
and I'm really uncomfortable with that

4474
01:33:54,470 --> 01:33:54,480
and I'm really uncomfortable with that
 

4475
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:57,770
and I'm really uncomfortable with that
perhaps because in my mind in my heart

4476
01:33:57,770 --> 01:33:57,780
perhaps because in my mind in my heart
 

4477
01:33:57,780 --> 01:33:59,810
perhaps because in my mind in my heart
and my blood or Echoes of the Cold War

4478
01:33:59,810 --> 01:33:59,820
and my blood or Echoes of the Cold War
 

4479
01:33:59,820 --> 01:34:03,370
and my blood or Echoes of the Cold War
and that kind of tension

4480
01:34:03,370 --> 01:34:03,380

 

4481
01:34:03,380 --> 01:34:07,910

it it feels like we almost desire

4482
01:34:07,910 --> 01:34:07,920

think that she is somebody who has tried
to do the right thing she was one of the

4546
01:35:24,109 --> 01:35:24,119
to do the right thing she was one of the
 

4547
01:35:24,119 --> 01:35:26,330
to do the right thing she was one of the
heroes of tracking down the origins of

4548
01:35:26,330 --> 01:35:26,340
heroes of tracking down the origins of
 

4549
01:35:26,340 --> 01:35:29,030
heroes of tracking down the origins of
of SARS one and that was a major uh

4550
01:35:29,030 --> 01:35:29,040
of SARS one and that was a major uh
 

4551
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:30,950
of SARS one and that was a major uh
contribution

4552
01:35:30,950 --> 01:35:30,960
contribution
 

4553
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:33,950
contribution
um but as we we talked about earlier

4554
01:35:33,950 --> 01:35:33,960
um but as we we talked about earlier
 

4555
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:37,970
um but as we we talked about earlier
it's it's a different thing living being

4556
01:35:37,970 --> 01:35:37,980
it's it's a different thing living being
 

4557
01:35:37,980 --> 01:35:40,149
it's it's a different thing living being
a scientist or really kind of anything

4558
01:35:40,149 --> 01:35:40,159
a scientist or really kind of anything
 

4559
01:35:40,159 --> 01:35:43,450
a scientist or really kind of anything
it's different being one of those people

4560
01:35:43,450 --> 01:35:43,460
it's different being one of those people
 

4561
01:35:43,460 --> 01:35:47,270
it's different being one of those people
in an authoritarian Society

4562
01:35:47,270 --> 01:35:47,280
in an authoritarian Society
 

4563
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:50,030
in an authoritarian Society
um than it is being in a different type

4564
01:35:50,030 --> 01:35:50,040
um than it is being in a different type
 

4565
01:35:50,040 --> 01:35:53,270
um than it is being in a different type
of society and so when shujang Lee said

4566
01:35:53,270 --> 01:35:53,280
of society and so when shujang Lee said
 

4567
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:57,950
of society and so when shujang Lee said
that the reason the uh the wiv database

4568
01:35:57,950 --> 01:35:57,960
that the reason the uh the wiv database
 

4569
01:35:57,960 --> 01:36:00,590
that the reason the uh the wiv database
was taken offline in September 19 was

4570
01:36:00,590 --> 01:36:00,600
was taken offline in September 19 was
 

4571
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:02,870
was taken offline in September 19 was
because of computer hacks I don't think

4572
01:36:02,870 --> 01:36:02,880
because of computer hacks I don't think
 

4573
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:04,790
because of computer hacks I don't think
that's the story I don't think she

4574
01:36:04,790 --> 01:36:04,800
that's the story I don't think she
 

4575
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:08,510
that's the story I don't think she
thinks that's uh that's the story when I

4576
01:36:08,510 --> 01:36:08,520
thinks that's uh that's the story when I
 

4577
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:12,050
thinks that's uh that's the story when I
asked her in March of 2021 March of this

4578
01:36:12,050 --> 01:36:12,060
asked her in March of 2021 March of this
 

4579
01:36:12,060 --> 01:36:16,070
asked her in March of 2021 March of this
year in a Rutgers online Forum when I

4580
01:36:16,070 --> 01:36:16,080
year in a Rutgers online Forum when I
 

4581
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:17,990
year in a Rutgers online Forum when I
asked her whether the Chinese military

4582
01:36:17,990 --> 01:36:18,000
asked her whether the Chinese military
 

4583
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:21,109
asked her whether the Chinese military
had any engagement with the Wuhan

4584
01:36:21,109 --> 01:36:21,119
had any engagement with the Wuhan
 

4585
01:36:21,119 --> 01:36:24,169
had any engagement with the Wuhan
Institute of virology in any way and she

4586
01:36:24,169 --> 01:36:24,179
Institute of virology in any way and she
 

4587
01:36:24,179 --> 01:36:26,990
Institute of virology in any way and she
said absolutely not paraphrasing I think

4588
01:36:26,990 --> 01:36:27,000
said absolutely not paraphrasing I think
 

4589
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,270
said absolutely not paraphrasing I think
she was lying do I think that she had

4590
01:36:29,270 --> 01:36:29,280
she was lying do I think that she had
 

4591
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:32,930
she was lying do I think that she had
the ability to say well either one yes

4592
01:36:32,930 --> 01:36:32,940
the ability to say well either one yes
 

4593
01:36:32,940 --> 01:36:35,810
the ability to say well either one yes
but I can't talk about it it or I know

4594
01:36:35,810 --> 01:36:35,820
but I can't talk about it it or I know
 

4595
01:36:35,820 --> 01:36:37,010
but I can't talk about it it or I know
there are a lot of things that are

4596
01:36:37,010 --> 01:36:37,020
there are a lot of things that are
 

4597
01:36:37,020 --> 01:36:39,590
there are a lot of things that are
happening at this institute that I don't

4598
01:36:39,590 --> 01:36:39,600
happening at this institute that I don't
 

4599
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:42,109
happening at this institute that I don't
know about and that could be one uh

4600
01:36:42,109 --> 01:36:42,119
know about and that could be one uh
 

4601
01:36:42,119 --> 01:36:43,850
know about and that could be one uh
could she have said

4602
01:36:43,850 --> 01:36:43,860
could she have said
 

4603
01:36:43,860 --> 01:36:47,090
could she have said
um that the uh the Personnel at the 100

4604
01:36:47,090 --> 01:36:47,100
um that the uh the Personnel at the 100
 

4605
01:36:47,100 --> 01:36:49,550
um that the uh the Personnel at the 100
Institute of virology have all had to go

4606
01:36:49,550 --> 01:36:49,560
Institute of virology have all had to go
 

4607
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:52,430
Institute of virology have all had to go
through classification training

4608
01:36:52,430 --> 01:36:52,440
through classification training
 

4609
01:36:52,440 --> 01:36:55,189
through classification training
um to so that they can know about what

4610
01:36:55,189 --> 01:36:55,199
um to so that they can know about what
 

4611
01:36:55,199 --> 01:36:58,129
um to so that they can know about what
can and and can't be said like she could

4612
01:36:58,129 --> 01:36:58,139
can and and can't be said like she could
 

4613
01:36:58,139 --> 01:36:59,990
can and and can't be said like she could
have said all those things but she

4614
01:36:59,990 --> 01:37:00,000
have said all those things but she
 

4615
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,470
have said all those things but she
couldn't say all of those things and so

4616
01:37:03,470 --> 01:37:03,480
couldn't say all of those things and so
 

4617
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:05,990
couldn't say all of those things and so
um and I think that's why so many

4618
01:37:05,990 --> 01:37:06,000
um and I think that's why so many
 

4619
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:09,290
um and I think that's why so many
at least in my view so many people uh in

4620
01:37:09,290 --> 01:37:09,300
at least in my view so many people uh in
 

4621
01:37:09,300 --> 01:37:11,450
at least in my view so many people uh in
the certainly in the Western World got

4622
01:37:11,450 --> 01:37:11,460
the certainly in the Western World got
 

4623
01:37:11,460 --> 01:37:13,490
the certainly in the Western World got
this story wrong from the beginning

4624
01:37:13,490 --> 01:37:13,500
this story wrong from the beginning
 

4625
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:17,270
this story wrong from the beginning
because if you're only prism was the

4626
01:37:17,270 --> 01:37:17,280
because if you're only prism was the
 

4627
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:19,609
because if you're only prism was the
science and you just assumed this is a

4628
01:37:19,609 --> 01:37:19,619
science and you just assumed this is a
 

4629
01:37:19,619 --> 01:37:21,830
science and you just assumed this is a
science question to be left to the

4630
01:37:21,830 --> 01:37:21,840
science question to be left to the
 

4631
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:25,189
science question to be left to the
scientists shujang Lee is is just like

4632
01:37:25,189 --> 01:37:25,199
scientists shujang Lee is is just like
 

4633
01:37:25,199 --> 01:37:27,530
scientists shujang Lee is is just like
any scientist working in Switzerland or

4634
01:37:27,530 --> 01:37:27,540
any scientist working in Switzerland or
 

4635
01:37:27,540 --> 01:37:31,070
any scientist working in Switzerland or
Norway the Chinese government isn't

4636
01:37:31,070 --> 01:37:31,080
Norway the Chinese government isn't
 

4637
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:34,129
Norway the Chinese government isn't
interfering in in any way and we can

4638
01:37:34,129 --> 01:37:34,139
interfering in in any way and we can
 

4639
01:37:34,139 --> 01:37:36,229
interfering in in any way and we can
trust them that would lead you down One

4640
01:37:36,229 --> 01:37:36,239
trust them that would lead you down One
 

4641
01:37:36,239 --> 01:37:39,229
trust them that would lead you down One
path uh in my view the reason why I I

4642
01:37:39,229 --> 01:37:39,239
path uh in my view the reason why I I
 

4643
01:37:39,239 --> 01:37:41,629
path uh in my view the reason why I I
progressed as I did is I felt like I had

4644
01:37:41,629 --> 01:37:41,639
progressed as I did is I felt like I had
 

4645
01:37:41,639 --> 01:37:44,629
progressed as I did is I felt like I had
two keys I had one key as I live in this

4646
01:37:44,629 --> 01:37:44,639
two keys I had one key as I live in this
 

4647
01:37:44,639 --> 01:37:46,729
two keys I had one key as I live in this
in the Science World through my work

4648
01:37:46,729 --> 01:37:46,739
in the Science World through my work
 

4649
01:37:46,739 --> 01:37:49,310
in the Science World through my work
with who and my books and and things

4650
01:37:49,310 --> 01:37:49,320
with who and my books and and things
 

4651
01:37:49,320 --> 01:37:51,649
with who and my books and and things
like that but I also have another part

4652
01:37:51,649 --> 01:37:51,659
like that but I also have another part
 

4653
01:37:51,659 --> 01:37:54,649
like that but I also have another part
of my life in the world of geopolitics

4654
01:37:54,649 --> 01:37:54,659
of my life in the world of geopolitics
 

4655
01:37:54,659 --> 01:37:58,010
of my life in the world of geopolitics
as a an Asia quote-unquote expert and

4656
01:37:58,010 --> 01:37:58,020
as a an Asia quote-unquote expert and
 

4657
01:37:58,020 --> 01:37:59,689
as a an Asia quote-unquote expert and
former National Security Council

4658
01:37:59,689 --> 01:37:59,699
former National Security Council
 

4659
01:37:59,699 --> 01:38:02,030
former National Security Council
official and other things and I felt for

4660
01:38:02,030 --> 01:38:02,040
official and other things and I felt for
 

4661
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:05,450
official and other things and I felt for
me I needed both keys to open that that

4662
01:38:05,450 --> 01:38:05,460
me I needed both keys to open that that
 

4663
01:38:05,460 --> 01:38:08,510
me I needed both keys to open that that
door uh but if I only had the science

4664
01:38:08,510 --> 01:38:08,520
door uh but if I only had the science
 

4665
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:10,850
door uh but if I only had the science
key I wouldn't have had the level of

4666
01:38:10,850 --> 01:38:10,860
key I wouldn't have had the level of
 

4667
01:38:10,860 --> 01:38:13,490
key I wouldn't have had the level of
doubt and suspicion that I have but if

4668
01:38:13,490 --> 01:38:13,500
doubt and suspicion that I have but if
 

4669
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:15,590
doubt and suspicion that I have but if
my starting point was only doubt and

4670
01:38:15,590 --> 01:38:15,600
my starting point was only doubt and
 

4671
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:18,050
my starting point was only doubt and
suspicion well it's coming from China it

4672
01:38:18,050 --> 01:38:18,060
suspicion well it's coming from China it
 

4673
01:38:18,060 --> 01:38:20,390
suspicion well it's coming from China it
must be that the government is guilty

4674
01:38:20,390 --> 01:38:20,400
must be that the government is guilty
 

4675
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:23,990
must be that the government is guilty
like that wouldn't help either

4676
01:38:23,990 --> 01:38:24,000

 

4677
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,450

I wonder what's in her mind

4678
01:38:26,450 --> 01:38:26,460
I wonder what's in her mind
 

4679
01:38:26,460 --> 01:38:28,550
I wonder what's in her mind
whether it's fear

4680
01:38:28,550 --> 01:38:28,560
whether it's fear
 

4681
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:30,709
whether it's fear
or habit

4682
01:38:30,709 --> 01:38:30,719
or habit
 

4683
01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:32,090
or habit
because I think

4684
01:38:32,090 --> 01:38:32,100
because I think
 

4685
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:32,870
because I think
um

4686
01:38:32,870 --> 01:38:32,880
um
 

4687
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:35,030
um
a lot of people in the former Soviet

4688
01:38:35,030 --> 01:38:35,040
a lot of people in the former Soviet
 

4689
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:38,570
a lot of people in the former Soviet
Union sector Noble it's not really fear

4690
01:38:38,570 --> 01:38:38,580
Union sector Noble it's not really fear
 

4691
01:38:38,580 --> 01:38:42,590
Union sector Noble it's not really fear
it's almost like a momentum it's like um

4692
01:38:42,590 --> 01:38:42,600
it's almost like a momentum it's like um
 

4693
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:44,810
it's almost like a momentum it's like um
it's like the reason I I showed up to

4694
01:38:44,810 --> 01:38:44,820
it's like the reason I I showed up to
 

4695
01:38:44,820 --> 01:38:46,310
it's like the reason I I showed up to
this interview wearing clothes as

4696
01:38:46,310 --> 01:38:46,320
this interview wearing clothes as
 

4697
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:47,870
this interview wearing clothes as
opposed to being naked

4698
01:38:47,870 --> 01:38:47,880
opposed to being naked

what we thought was the best available
 

4797
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:55,310
what we thought was the best available
system and it has totally failed here

4798
01:40:55,310 --> 01:40:55,320
system and it has totally failed here
 

4799
01:40:55,320 --> 01:40:58,790
system and it has totally failed here
and it's failed here because of the

4800
01:40:58,790 --> 01:40:58,800
and it's failed here because of the
 

4801

internal pathologies of the Chinese
 

4809
01:41:10,380 --> 01:41:13,550
internal pathologies of the Chinese

4810
01:41:13,550 --> 01:41:13,560
State and that's why on one hand I
 

4811
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:15,770
State and that's why on one hand I
totally get this impulse what we do it

4812
01:41:15,770 --> 01:41:15,780

our way they do it their way who's to
 

4815
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:21,410
our way they do it their way who's to
say that that one way is better and

4816
01:41:21,410 --> 01:41:21,420
say that that one way is better and
 

4817
01:41:21,420 --> 01:41:23,510

certainly right now in the United States

4818
01:41:23,510 --> 01:41:23,520
certainly right now in the United States
 

4819
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:26,090

hard time getting anything meaningful
 

4823
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:29,450
hard time getting anything meaningful
done

4824
01:41:29,450 --> 01:41:29,460
done
 

4825
01:41:29,460 --> 01:41:31,250
done
um and I'm sure there are people who are

4826
01:41:31,250 --> 01:41:31,260
um and I'm sure there are people who are
 

4827
01:41:31,260 --> 01:41:33,350
um and I'm sure there are people who are
saying well that model looks looks

4828
01:41:33,350 --> 01:41:33,360
saying well that model looks looks
 

4829
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:36,350
saying well that model looks looks
appealing but just as people could look

4830
01:41:36,350 --> 01:41:36,360
appealing but just as people could look
 

4831
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:38,270
appealing but just as people could look
to the United States and say well

4832
01:41:38,270 --> 01:41:38,280
to the United States and say well
 

4833
01:41:38,280 --> 01:41:40,070
to the United States and say well
because the United States has such a

4834

because the United States has such a
 

4835
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:41,750
because the United States has such a

01:41:41,750 --> 01:41:41,760
massive reach what we do domestically
 

4837
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:43,790
massive reach what we do domestically
has huge implications for the rest of

think for a lot of years people have
 

4845
01:41:50,699 --> 01:41:52,490
think for a lot of years people have
just been looking at U.S politics not

4846
01:41:52,490 --> 01:41:52,500
just been looking at U.S politics not
 

4847
01:41:52,500 --> 01:41:54,410
just been looking at U.S politics not

because it's interesting but because the
 

4849
01:41:54,420 --> 01:41:56,510
because it's interesting but because the
decisions that we make have big

4850
01:41:56,510 --> 01:41:56,520
decisions that we make have big
 

4851
01:41:56,520 --> 01:41:58,970
decisions that we make have big
implications for their lives the same is

4852
01:41:58,970 --> 01:41:58,980
implications for their lives the same is
 

4853
01:41:58,980 --> 01:42:01,250
implications for their lives the same is
true for ours you could say

4854
01:42:01,250 --> 01:42:01,260
true for ours you could say
 

4855
01:42:01,260 --> 01:42:03,830

5088
01:46:40,070 --> 01:46:40,080
any public forums but that's why most
 

5089
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:41,750
any public forums but that's why most

maybe hundreds of people in China who
have relevant information about the

origins of the pandemic who are

5106
01:46:59,209 --> 01:46:59,219

strength of the United States with all
of our flaws is particularly in that

5482
01:55:05,089 --> 01:55:05,099
of our flaws is particularly in that
 

5483
01:55:05,099 --> 01:55:08,450
of our flaws is particularly in that
that post-war period we we put forward a

5484
01:55:08,450 --> 01:55:08,460
that post-war period we we put forward a
 

5485
01:55:08,460 --> 01:55:10,850
that post-war period we we put forward a
model that was desirable to a lot of

5486
01:55:10,850 --> 01:55:10,860
model that was desirable to a lot of
 

5487
01:55:10,860 --> 01:55:12,290
model that was desirable to a lot of
people certainly it was desirable to

5488
01:55:12,290 --> 01:55:12,300
people certainly it was desirable to
 

5489
01:55:12,300 --> 01:55:13,970
people certainly it was desirable to
people in Western Europe and then

5490
01:55:13,970 --> 01:55:13,980
people in Western Europe and then
 

5491
01:55:13,980 --> 01:55:17,450
people in Western Europe and then
Eastern Europe and Japan and Korea

5492
01:55:17,450 --> 01:55:17,460
Eastern Europe and Japan and Korea
 

5493
01:55:17,460 --> 01:55:19,070
Eastern Europe and Japan and Korea
um doesn't mean it's perfect the United

5494
01:55:19,070 --> 01:55:19,080
um doesn't mean it's perfect the United
 

5495
01:55:19,080 --> 01:55:21,890
um doesn't mean it's perfect the United
States is is deeply flawed as

5496
01:55:21,890 --> 01:55:21,900
States is is deeply flawed as
 

5497
01:55:21,900 --> 01:55:24,830
States is is deeply flawed as
articulated to date I don't think

5498
01:55:24,830 --> 01:55:24,840
articulated to date I don't think
 

5499
01:55:24,840 --> 01:55:27,169
articulated to date I don't think
um most people and countries and would

5500
01:55:27,169 --> 01:55:27,179
um most people and countries and would
 

5501
01:55:27,179 --> 01:55:30,290
um most people and countries and would
like to live in a sino-centric world

5502
01:55:30,290 --> 01:55:30,300
like to live in a sino-centric world
 

5503
01:55:30,300 --> 01:55:32,149
like to live in a sino-centric world
um and so I certainly as I mentioned

5504
01:55:32,149 --> 01:55:32,159
um and so I certainly as I mentioned
 

5505
01:55:32,159 --> 01:55:34,250
um and so I certainly as I mentioned
before I'm a huge critic of what Xi

5506
01:55:34,250 --> 01:55:34,260
before I'm a huge critic of what Xi
 

5507
01:55:34,260 --> 01:55:36,350
before I'm a huge critic of what Xi
Jinping is doing the incredible

5508
01:55:36,350 --> 01:55:36,360
Jinping is doing the incredible
 

5509
01:55:36,360 --> 01:55:41,030
Jinping is doing the incredible
brutality in xinjiang in Tibet and um

5510
01:55:41,030 --> 01:55:41,040
brutality in xinjiang in Tibet and um
 

5511
01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:43,609
brutality in xinjiang in Tibet and um
and and elsewhere yeah the censorship

5512
01:55:43,609 --> 01:55:43,619
and and elsewhere yeah the censorship
 

5513
01:55:43,619 --> 01:55:44,810
and and elsewhere yeah the censorship
one

5514
01:55:44,810 --> 01:55:44,820
one
 

5515
01:55:44,820 --> 01:55:47,750
one
is it gives me a lot of trouble

5516
01:55:47,750 --> 01:55:47,760
is it gives me a lot of trouble
 

5517
01:55:47,760 --> 01:55:50,510
is it gives me a lot of trouble
on the science realm and just in

5518
01:55:50,510 --> 01:55:50,520
on the science realm and just in
 

5519
01:55:50,520 --> 01:55:52,790
on the science realm and just in
journalism and just the world that

5520
01:55:52,790 --> 01:55:52,800
journalism and just the world that
 

5521
01:55:52,800 --> 01:55:54,589
journalism and just the world that
prevents us from having conversations

5522
01:55:54,589 --> 01:55:54,599
prevents us from having conversations
 

5523
01:55:54,599 --> 01:55:56,149
prevents us from having conversations
with each other

5524
01:55:56,149 --> 01:55:56,159
with each other
 

5525
01:55:56,159 --> 01:55:57,950
with each other
do you know about the the Winnie the

5526
01:55:57,950 --> 01:55:57,960
do you know about the the Winnie the
 

5527
01:55:57,960 --> 01:56:00,470
do you know about the the Winnie the
Pooh thing yes I mean it's ridiculous

5528
01:56:00,470 --> 01:56:00,480
Pooh thing yes I mean it's ridiculous
 

5529
01:56:00,480 --> 01:56:02,810
Pooh thing yes I mean it's ridiculous
it's so so to me that's such a good

5530
01:56:02,810 --> 01:56:02,820
it's so so to me that's such a good
 

5531
01:56:02,820 --> 01:56:04,729
it's so so to me that's such a good
illustration of

5532
01:56:04,729 --> 01:56:04,739
illustration of
 

5533
01:56:04,739 --> 01:56:08,149
illustration of
a censorship being petty

5534
01:56:08,149 --> 01:56:08,159
a censorship being petty
 

5535
01:56:08,159 --> 01:56:10,189
a censorship being petty
but censorship has to be Petty because

5536
01:56:10,189 --> 01:56:10,199
but censorship has to be Petty because
 

5537
01:56:10,199 --> 01:56:12,830
but censorship has to be Petty because
the goal of censorship maybe you

5538
01:56:12,830 --> 01:56:12,840
the goal of censorship maybe you
 

5539
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:15,290
the goal of censorship maybe you
experienced in the Soviet Union is to

5540
01:56:15,290 --> 01:56:15,300
experienced in the Soviet Union is to
 

5541
01:56:15,300 --> 01:56:17,450
experienced in the Soviet Union is to
get into your head like if it's just

5542
01:56:17,450 --> 01:56:17,460
get into your head like if it's just
 

5543
01:56:17,460 --> 01:56:20,089
get into your head like if it's just
censorship like you you say down with

5544
01:56:20,089 --> 01:56:20,099
censorship like you you say down with
 

5545
01:56:20,099 --> 01:56:22,189
censorship like you you say down with
the state and like you can't say that

5546
01:56:22,189 --> 01:56:22,199
the state and like you can't say that
 

5547
01:56:22,199 --> 01:56:25,370
the state and like you can't say that
but you can say all the other things up

5548
01:56:25,370 --> 01:56:25,380
but you can say all the other things up
 

5549
01:56:25,380 --> 01:56:27,649
but you can say all the other things up
to that point eventually people will

5550
01:56:27,649 --> 01:56:27,659
to that point eventually people will
 

5551
01:56:27,659 --> 01:56:29,510
to that point eventually people will
feel empowered to say down with the

5552
01:56:29,510 --> 01:56:29,520
feel empowered to say down with the
 

5553
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:31,669
feel empowered to say down with the
state and so I think the goal of this

5554
01:56:31,669 --> 01:56:31,679
state and so I think the goal of this
 

5555
01:56:31,679 --> 01:56:34,370
state and so I think the goal of this
kind of authoritarian censorship is to

5556
01:56:34,370 --> 01:56:34,380
kind of authoritarian censorship is to
 

5557
01:56:34,380 --> 01:56:38,290
kind of authoritarian censorship is to
turn you into the sensor and so the the

5558
01:56:38,290 --> 01:56:38,300
turn you into the sensor and so the the
 

5559
01:56:38,300 --> 01:56:40,850
turn you into the sensor and so the the
self-censorship because they almost have

5560
01:56:40,850 --> 01:56:40,860
self-censorship because they almost have
 

5561
01:56:40,860 --> 01:56:42,290
self-censorship because they almost have
to have you think well if I'm going to

5562
01:56:42,290 --> 01:56:42,300
to have you think well if I'm going to
 

5563
01:56:42,300 --> 01:56:44,510
to have you think well if I'm going to
make any criticism

5564
01:56:44,510 --> 01:56:44,520
make any criticism
 

5565
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:45,890
make any criticism
um maybe they're going to come and get

5566
01:56:45,890 --> 01:56:45,900
um maybe they're going to come and get
 

5567
01:56:45,900 --> 01:56:48,950
um maybe they're going to come and get
me so it's it's safer to not do I mean

5568
01:56:48,950 --> 01:56:48,960
me so it's it's safer to not do I mean
 

5569
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:50,750
me so it's it's safer to not do I mean
I've traveled through North Korea pretty

5570
01:56:50,750 --> 01:56:50,760
I've traveled through North Korea pretty
 

5571
01:56:50,760 --> 01:56:52,850
I've traveled through North Korea pretty
extensively and I've seen that in its

5572
01:56:52,850 --> 01:56:52,860
extensively and I've seen that in its
 

5573
01:56:52,860 --> 01:56:54,950
extensively and I've seen that in its
ultimate form but well that's what

5574
01:56:54,950 --> 01:56:54,960
ultimate form but well that's what
 

5575
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:57,350
ultimate form but well that's what
they're trying to do in China too yeah

5576
01:56:57,350 --> 01:56:57,360
they're trying to do in China too yeah
 

5577
01:56:57,360 --> 01:57:00,169
they're trying to do in China too yeah
so it's for people who are not familiar

5578
01:57:00,169 --> 01:57:00,179
so it's for people who are not familiar
 

5579
01:57:00,179 --> 01:57:02,689
so it's for people who are not familiar
such a clear illustration of just the

5580
01:57:02,689 --> 01:57:02,699
such a clear illustration of just the
 

5581
01:57:02,699 --> 01:57:05,450
such a clear illustration of just the
pettiness of censorship and leaders the

5582
01:57:05,450 --> 01:57:05,460
pettiness of censorship and leaders the
 

5583
01:57:05,460 --> 01:57:08,270
pettiness of censorship and leaders the
corrupting nature of power but uh

5584
01:57:08,270 --> 01:57:08,280
corrupting nature of power but uh
 

5585
01:57:08,280 --> 01:57:11,450
corrupting nature of power but uh
there's a meme of Xi Jinping with I

5586
01:57:11,450 --> 01:57:11,460
there's a meme of Xi Jinping with I
 

5587
01:57:11,460 --> 01:57:13,669
there's a meme of Xi Jinping with I
guess uh Barack Obama

5588
01:57:13,669 --> 01:57:13,679
guess uh Barack Obama
 

5589
01:57:13,679 --> 01:57:16,970
guess uh Barack Obama
and uh the meme is that he looks like

5590
01:57:16,970 --> 01:57:16,980
and uh the meme is that he looks like
 

5591
01:57:16,980 --> 01:57:20,689
and uh the meme is that he looks like
Winnie the Pooh in that picture

5592
01:57:20,689 --> 01:57:20,699
Winnie the Pooh in that picture
 

5593
01:57:20,699 --> 01:57:23,810
Winnie the Pooh in that picture
and that was

5594
01:57:23,810 --> 01:57:23,820
and that was
 

5595
01:57:23,820 --> 01:57:25,729
and that was
uh the presidency champagne looks like

5596
01:57:25,729 --> 01:57:25,739
uh the presidency champagne looks like
 

5597
01:57:25,739 --> 01:57:28,250
uh the presidency champagne looks like
Winnie the Pooh and I guess that became

5598
01:57:28,250 --> 01:57:28,260
Winnie the Pooh and I guess that became
 

5599
01:57:28,260 --> 01:57:30,589
Winnie the Pooh and I guess that became
because that got censored or like

5600
01:57:30,589 --> 01:57:30,599
because that got censored or like
 

5601
01:57:30,599 --> 01:57:32,570
because that got censored or like
mentions of Winnie the Pooh got censored

5602
01:57:32,570 --> 01:57:32,580
mentions of Winnie the Pooh got censored
 

5603
01:57:32,580 --> 01:57:35,330
mentions of Winnie the Pooh got censored
all across China Winnie the Pooh became

5604
01:57:35,330 --> 01:57:35,340
all across China Winnie the Pooh became
 

5605
01:57:35,340 --> 01:57:38,570
all across China Winnie the Pooh became
the unknowing revolutionary hero that

5606
01:57:38,570 --> 01:57:38,580
the unknowing revolutionary hero that
 

5607
01:57:38,580 --> 01:57:41,450
the unknowing revolutionary hero that
represents freedom of speech and and so

5608
01:57:41,450 --> 01:57:41,460
represents freedom of speech and and so
 

5609
01:57:41,460 --> 01:57:44,629
represents freedom of speech and and so
on but it's just such a absurd because

5610
01:57:44,629 --> 01:57:44,639
on but it's just such a absurd because
 

5611
01:57:44,639 --> 01:57:47,270
on but it's just such a absurd because
because we spent all so much time in

5612
01:57:47,270 --> 01:57:47,280
because we spent all so much time in
 

5613
01:57:47,280 --> 01:57:48,589
because we spent all so much time in
this conversation talk about the

5614
01:57:48,589 --> 01:57:48,599
this conversation talk about the
 

5615
01:57:48,599 --> 01:57:50,810
this conversation talk about the
censorship that's a little bit more

5616
01:57:50,810 --> 01:57:50,820
censorship that's a little bit more
 

5617
01:57:50,820 --> 01:57:54,050
censorship that's a little bit more
understandable to me which is like we

5618
01:57:54,050 --> 01:57:54,060
understandable to me which is like we
 

5619
01:57:54,060 --> 01:57:55,250
understandable to me which is like we
messed up

5620
01:57:55,250 --> 01:57:55,260
messed up
 

5621
01:57:55,260 --> 01:57:56,870
messed up
and it wasn't

5622
01:57:56,870 --> 01:57:56,880
and it wasn't
 

5623
01:57:56,880 --> 01:57:59,810
and it wasn't
maybe it's almost understandable errors

5624
01:57:59,810 --> 01:57:59,820
maybe it's almost understandable errors
 

5625
01:57:59,820 --> 01:58:00,950
maybe it's almost understandable errors
that happen

5626
01:58:00,950 --> 01:58:00,960
that happen
 

5627
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:03,169
that happen
in the progress of science I mean you

5628
01:58:03,169 --> 01:58:03,179
in the progress of science I mean you
 

5629
01:58:03,179 --> 01:58:04,910
in the progress of science I mean you
could always uh

5630
01:58:04,910 --> 01:58:04,920
could always uh
 

5631
01:58:04,920 --> 01:58:08,209
could always uh
argue that uh there's a lot of mistakes

5632
01:58:08,209 --> 01:58:08,219
argue that uh there's a lot of mistakes
 

5633
01:58:08,219 --> 01:58:10,189
argue that uh there's a lot of mistakes
along the way and the censorship along

5634
01:58:10,189 --> 01:58:10,199
along the way and the censorship along
 

5635
01:58:10,199 --> 01:58:12,410
along the way and the censorship along
the way caused the big mistake you can

5636
01:58:12,410 --> 01:58:12,420
the way caused the big mistake you can
 

5637
01:58:12,420 --> 01:58:14,450
the way caused the big mistake you can
argue that same way for the Chernobyl

5638
01:58:14,450 --> 01:58:14,460

5796
02:01:34,729 --> 02:01:34,739
who in the Chinese Communist party May
 

5797
02:01:34,739 --> 02:01:36,830
who in the Chinese Communist party May
or your boss in a business has assaulted

5798
02:01:36,830 --> 02:01:36,840
or your boss in a business has assaulted
 

5799
02:01:36,840 --> 02:01:39,109
or your boss in a business has assaulted
you just like in every society I'm sure

5800
02:01:39,109 --> 02:01:39,119
you just like in every society I'm sure
 

5801
02:01:39,119 --> 02:01:40,669
you just like in every society I'm sure
there's tons of women who've been

5802
02:01:40,669 --> 02:01:40,679
there's tons of women who've been
 

5803
02:01:40,679 --> 02:01:44,330
there's tons of women who've been
sexually assaulted manipulated abused by

5804
02:01:44,330 --> 02:01:44,340
sexually assaulted manipulated abused by
 

5805
02:01:44,340 --> 02:01:48,709
sexually assaulted manipulated abused by
by men and so I I certainly hope that

5806
02:01:48,709 --> 02:01:48,719
by men and so I I certainly hope that
 

5807
02:01:48,719 --> 02:01:51,109
by men and so I I certainly hope that
there can be that kind of opening

5808
02:01:51,109 --> 02:01:51,119
there can be that kind of opening
 

5809
02:01:51,119 --> 02:01:53,209
there can be that kind of opening
um but if I were an authoritarian

5810
02:01:53,209 --> 02:01:53,219
um but if I were an authoritarian
 

5811
02:01:53,219 --> 02:01:55,430
um but if I were an authoritarian
dictator that's the thing I would be

5812
02:01:55,430 --> 02:01:55,440
dictator that's the thing I would be
 

5813
02:01:55,440 --> 02:01:58,490
dictator that's the thing I would be
most afraid of yeah dictator perhaps but

5814
02:01:58,490 --> 02:01:58,500
most afraid of yeah dictator perhaps but
 

5815
02:01:58,500 --> 02:02:00,470
most afraid of yeah dictator perhaps but
uh I think you can gradually increase

5816
02:02:00,470 --> 02:02:00,480
uh I think you can gradually increase
 

5817
02:02:00,480 --> 02:02:02,870
uh I think you can gradually increase
the freedom of speech so I think you can

5818
02:02:02,870 --> 02:02:02,880
the freedom of speech so I think you can
 

5819
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:05,030
the freedom of speech so I think you can
maintain control over the freedom of

5820
02:02:05,030 --> 02:02:05,040
maintain control over the freedom of
 

5821
02:02:05,040 --> 02:02:08,209
maintain control over the freedom of
press first so control the Press more

5822
02:02:08,209 --> 02:02:08,219
press first so control the Press more
 

5823
02:02:08,219 --> 02:02:11,450
press first so control the Press more
but let the the lower levels sort of

5824
02:02:11,450 --> 02:02:11,460
but let the the lower levels sort of
 

5825
02:02:11,460 --> 02:02:14,570
but let the the lower levels sort of
open up YouTube Right open up like where

5826
02:02:14,570 --> 02:02:14,580
open up YouTube Right open up like where
 

5827
02:02:14,580 --> 02:02:17,149
open up YouTube Right open up like where
individual citizens can make content I

5828
02:02:17,149 --> 02:02:17,159
individual citizens can make content I
 

5829
02:02:17,159 --> 02:02:18,709
individual citizens can make content I
mean there's a lot of benefits to that

5830
02:02:18,709 --> 02:02:18,719
mean there's a lot of benefits to that
 

5831
02:02:18,719 --> 02:02:21,709
mean there's a lot of benefits to that
and then uh you know from an

5832
02:02:21,709 --> 02:02:21,719
and then uh you know from an
 

5833
02:02:21,719 --> 02:02:23,330
and then uh you know from an
authoritarian perspective you can just

5834
02:02:23,330 --> 02:02:23,340
authoritarian perspective you can just
 

5835
02:02:23,340 --> 02:02:26,270
authoritarian perspective you can just
say that's misinformation that's uh

5836
02:02:26,270 --> 02:02:26,280
say that's misinformation that's uh
 

5837
02:02:26,280 --> 02:02:27,770
say that's misinformation that's uh
conspiracy theories all those kinds of

5838
02:02:27,770 --> 02:02:27,780
conspiracy theories all those kinds of
 

5839
02:02:27,780 --> 02:02:31,070
conspiracy theories all those kinds of
things but at least I think if you open

5840
02:02:31,070 --> 02:02:31,080
things but at least I think if you open
 

5841
02:02:31,080 --> 02:02:33,109
things but at least I think if you open
up that freedom of speech at the level

5842
02:02:33,109 --> 02:02:33,119
up that freedom of speech at the level
 

5843
02:02:33,119 --> 02:02:35,649
up that freedom of speech at the level
of the individual citizen

5844
02:02:35,649 --> 02:02:35,659
of the individual citizen
 

5845
02:02:35,659 --> 02:02:38,570
of the individual citizen
that's good for entrepreneurship for the

5846
02:02:38,570 --> 02:02:38,580
that's good for entrepreneurship for the
 

5847
02:02:38,580 --> 02:02:40,310
that's good for entrepreneurship for the
development of ideas of exchange of

5848
02:02:40,310 --> 02:02:40,320
development of ideas of exchange of
 

5849
02:02:40,320 --> 02:02:41,870
development of ideas of exchange of
ideas all that kind of stuff I just

02:02:43,609 --> 02:02:43,619
think that increased the GDP of the
 

5853
02:02:43,619 --> 02:02:45,229
think that increased the GDP of the
country yeah but I think there's a lot

5867
02:03:00,900 --> 02:03:03,290
freedom to the citizenry like I think
just like with North Korea is a good

5868
02:03:03,290 --> 02:03:03,300
just like with North Korea is a good
 

5869
02:03:03,300 --> 02:03:07,149
just like with North Korea is a good
example of where cracking down too much

5870
02:03:07,149 --> 02:03:07,159
example of where cracking down too much

circle Sarah everybody hold hands and
 

6119
02:07:53,280 --> 02:07:55,790
circle Sarah everybody hold hands and
then put your right just try put your

6120
02:07:55,790 --> 02:07:55,800
then put your right just try put your
 

6121
02:07:55,800 --> 02:07:57,950
then put your right just try put your
right foot in front of your left and

6122

right foot in front of your left and
 

6123
02:07:57,960 --> 02:07:59,450
right foot in front of your left and
then left foot in front of the right

6124
02:07:59,450 --> 02:07:59,460
then left foot in front of the right
 

6125
02:07:59,460 --> 02:08:01,850
then left foot in front of the right
going sideways and I said all right hit

6126
02:08:01,850 --> 02:08:01,860
going sideways and I said all right hit
 

6127
02:08:01,860 --> 02:08:04,970
going sideways and I said all right hit
it and she played a North Korean version

it and she played a North Korean version
of Hava Nagila and I think it was the

6130
02:08:07,970 --> 02:08:07,980
of Hava Nagila and I think it was the
 

6131
02:08:07,980 --> 02:08:10,310
of Hava Nagila and I think it was the
first and only Hora that they've ever

first and only Hora that they've ever
done in in North Korea I survived was

6134
02:08:13,310 --> 02:08:13,320
done in in North Korea I survived was
 

6135
02:08:13,320 --> 02:08:15,649
done in in North Korea I survived was
this reported or no it was not oh no

let's return to the beginning and it

6142
02:08:23,629 --> 02:08:23,639
let's return to the beginning and it
 

6143
02:08:23,639 --> 02:08:25,609
let's return to the beginning and it
just

6144
02:08:25,609 --> 02:08:25,619
just
 

6145
02:08:25,619 --> 02:08:27,910
just
patient zero

6146
02:08:27,910 --> 02:08:27,920
patient zero
 

6147
02:08:27,920 --> 02:08:30,589
patient zero
it's kind of uh always incredible to

6148
02:08:30,589 --> 02:08:30,599
it's kind of uh always incredible to
 

6149
02:08:30,599 --> 02:08:32,990
it's kind of uh always incredible to
think that there's one human at which it

6150
02:08:32,990 --> 02:08:33,000
think that there's one human at which it
 

6151
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:36,229
think that there's one human at which it
all started

6152

who do you think was patient zero
 

6155
02:08:38,639 --> 02:08:40,970
who do you think was patient zero
do you think it was uh

6156
02:08:40,970 --> 02:08:40,980
do you think it was uh
 

6157
02:08:40,980 --> 02:08:43,970
do you think it was uh
somebody that worked at uh Wuhan

6158

do you think it was um
there was a leak of some other kind that

6166
02:08:53,149 --> 02:08:53,159
there was a leak of some other kind that
 

6167
02:08:53,159 --> 02:08:55,729
there was a leak of some other kind that
uh led to the infection like what do we

6168
02:08:55,729 --> 02:08:55,739
uh led to the infection like what do we
 

6169
02:08:55,739 --> 02:08:57,709
uh led to the infection like what do we
know because there's this December 8th

6170
02:08:57,709 --> 02:08:57,719
know because there's this December 8th
 

6171
02:08:57,719 --> 02:09:00,729
know because there's this December 8th
slash December 16th case

of
 

6175
02:09:02,340 --> 02:09:04,310
of
um maybe you can describe what that is

6176
02:09:04,310 --> 02:09:04,320
um maybe you can describe what that is
 

6177
02:09:04,320 --> 02:09:07,490
um maybe you can describe what that is
and then there's like uh what

6178
02:09:07,490 --> 02:09:07,500
and then there's like uh what
 

6179
02:09:07,500 --> 02:09:08,689
and then there's like uh what
uh

6180
02:09:08,689 --> 02:09:08,699
uh
 

6181
02:09:08,699 --> 02:09:11,390
uh
what's his name uh Michael willby has

6182
02:09:11,390 --> 02:09:11,400
what's his name uh Michael willby has
 

6183
02:09:11,400 --> 02:09:13,550
what's his name uh Michael willby has
has a has a nice timeline I'm sure you

6184
02:09:13,550 --> 02:09:13,560
has a has a nice timeline I'm sure you
 

6185
02:09:13,560 --> 02:09:15,649
has a has a nice timeline I'm sure you
have a timeline but here's a nice

6186
02:09:15,649 --> 02:09:15,659
have a timeline but here's a nice
 

6187
02:09:15,659 --> 02:09:18,410
have a timeline but here's a nice
timeline that puts the average at like

6188
02:09:18,410 --> 02:09:18,420
timeline that puts the average at like
 

6189
02:09:18,420 --> 02:09:20,510
timeline that puts the average at like
November or something

6190
02:09:20,510 --> 02:09:20,520
November or something
 

6191
02:09:20,520 --> 02:09:22,550
November or something
um like 18th and November 16th that's

6192
02:09:22,550 --> 02:09:22,560
um like 18th and November 16th that's
 

6193
02:09:22,560 --> 02:09:26,569
um like 18th and November 16th that's
the average estimate for uh when the

6194
02:09:26,569 --> 02:09:26,579
the average estimate for uh when the
 

6195
02:09:26,579 --> 02:09:28,729
the average estimate for uh when the
patient zero got infected when the first

6196
02:09:28,729 --> 02:09:28,739
patient zero got infected when the first
 

6197
02:09:28,739 --> 02:09:30,890
patient zero got infected when the first
human infection happened yeah so the

6198
02:09:30,890 --> 02:09:30,900
human infection happened yeah so the
 

6199
02:09:30,900 --> 02:09:33,350
human infection happened yeah so the
just two points one is

6200
02:09:33,350 --> 02:09:33,360
just two points one is
 

6201
02:09:33,360 --> 02:09:36,890
just two points one is
it may be that there's infecty zero and

6202
02:09:36,890 --> 02:09:36,900
it may be that there's infecty zero and
 

6203
02:09:36,900 --> 02:09:38,810
it may be that there's infecty zero and
patient zero like it could be that the

6204
02:09:38,810 --> 02:09:38,820
patient zero like it could be that the
 

6205
02:09:38,820 --> 02:09:41,330
patient zero like it could be that the
first person infected was asymptomatic

6206
02:09:41,330 --> 02:09:41,340
first person infected was asymptomatic
 

6207
02:09:41,340 --> 02:09:42,410
first person infected was asymptomatic
because we know there's a lot of people

6208
02:09:42,410 --> 02:09:42,420
because we know there's a lot of people
 

6209
02:09:42,420 --> 02:09:44,990
because we know there's a lot of people
who are asymptomatic and then there's

6210
02:09:44,990 --> 02:09:45,000
who are asymptomatic and then there's
 

6211
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,689
who are asymptomatic and then there's
the question of well who is patient zero

6212
02:09:47,689 --> 02:09:47,699
the question of well who is patient zero
 

6213
02:09:47,699 --> 02:09:50,330
the question of well who is patient zero
meaning the first person to present

6214
02:09:50,330 --> 02:09:50,340
meaning the first person to present
 

6215
02:09:50,340 --> 02:09:52,550
meaning the first person to present
themselves in some kind of health

6216
02:09:52,550 --> 02:09:52,560
themselves in some kind of health
 

6217
02:09:52,560 --> 02:09:56,149
themselves in some kind of health
facility where that diagnosis could be

6218
02:09:56,149 --> 02:09:56,159
facility where that diagnosis could be
 

6219
02:09:56,159 --> 02:09:58,189
facility where that diagnosis could be
made so can we actually look on that

6220
02:09:58,189 --> 02:09:58,199
made so can we actually look on that
 

6221
02:09:58,199 --> 02:10:00,530
made so can we actually look on that
definition yeah so is that to you a good

6222
02:10:00,530 --> 02:10:00,540
definition yeah so is that to you a good
 

6223
02:10:00,540 --> 02:10:02,810
definition yeah so is that to you a good
definition of patient zero what okay

6224
02:10:02,810 --> 02:10:02,820
definition of patient zero what okay
 

6225
02:10:02,820 --> 02:10:04,729
definition of patient zero what okay
there's a bunch of stuff here because

6226
02:10:04,729 --> 02:10:04,739
there's a bunch of stuff here because
 

6227
02:10:04,739 --> 02:10:07,729
there's a bunch of stuff here because
this virus is weird uh so one is who

6228
02:10:07,729 --> 02:10:07,739
this virus is weird uh so one is who
 

6229
02:10:07,739 --> 02:10:10,030
this virus is weird uh so one is who
gets infected one who is

6230
02:10:10,030 --> 02:10:10,040
gets infected one who is
 

6231
02:10:10,040 --> 02:10:13,370
gets infected one who is
infectious or the first person infect

6232
02:10:13,370 --> 02:10:13,380
infectious or the first person infect
 

6233
02:10:13,380 --> 02:10:16,850
infectious or the first person infect
others yeah so so I think who shows up

6234
02:10:16,850 --> 02:10:16,860
others yeah so so I think who shows up
 

6235
02:10:16,860 --> 02:10:18,410
others yeah so so I think who shows up
to hospital yeah so I think that's why

6236
02:10:18,410 --> 02:10:18,420
to hospital yeah so I think that's why
 

6237
02:10:18,420 --> 02:10:19,430
to hospital yeah so I think that's why
that's why I'm calling the first person

6238
02:10:19,430 --> 02:10:19,440
that's why I'm calling the first person
 

6239
02:10:19,440 --> 02:10:21,350
that's why I'm calling the first person
to show up to a hospital who's diagnosed

6240
02:10:21,350 --> 02:10:21,360
to show up to a hospital who's diagnosed
 

6241
02:10:21,360 --> 02:10:23,390
to show up to a hospital who's diagnosed
with covid-19 I'm calling that person

6242
02:10:23,390 --> 02:10:23,400
with covid-19 I'm calling that person
 

6243
02:10:23,400 --> 02:10:25,250
with covid-19 I'm calling that person
patient zero

6244
02:10:25,250 --> 02:10:25,260
patient zero
 

6245
02:10:25,260 --> 02:10:27,649
patient zero
um there's also the there's somewhere

6246
02:10:27,649 --> 02:10:27,659
um there's also the there's somewhere
 

6247
02:10:27,659 --> 02:10:31,010
um there's also the there's somewhere
the first person to be infected and that

6248
02:10:31,010 --> 02:10:31,020
the first person to be infected and that
 

6249
02:10:31,020 --> 02:10:33,410
the first person to be infected and that
person maybe never showed up in a

6250
02:10:33,410 --> 02:10:33,420
person maybe never showed up in a
 

6251
02:10:33,420 --> 02:10:34,810
person maybe never showed up in a
hospital because maybe they were

6252
02:10:34,810 --> 02:10:34,820
hospital because maybe they were
 

6253
02:10:34,820 --> 02:10:37,490
hospital because maybe they were
symptomatic and and never get sick so

6254
02:10:37,490 --> 02:10:37,500
symptomatic and and never get sick so
 

6255

some person who was a villager in some
remote Village it's it's almost

6264
02:10:49,490 --> 02:10:49,500
remote Village it's it's almost
 

6265
02:10:49,500 --> 02:10:52,250
remote Village it's it's almost
impossible to imagine but possible to

6266
02:10:52,250 --> 02:10:52,260
impossible to imagine but possible to
 

6267
02:10:52,260 --> 02:10:55,370
impossible to imagine but possible to
imagine because strange things happen

6268
02:10:55,370 --> 02:10:55,380
imagine because strange things happen
 

6269
02:10:55,380 --> 02:10:57,530
imagine because strange things happen
um and that person you know somehow gets

6270
02:10:57,530 --> 02:10:57,540
um and that person you know somehow gets
 

6271
02:10:57,540 --> 02:11:00,290
um and that person you know somehow gets
to Wuhan by the way just the steel man

6272
02:11:00,290 --> 02:11:00,300
to Wuhan by the way just the steel man
 

6273
02:11:00,300 --> 02:11:02,390
to Wuhan by the way just the steel man
that argument there's not an argument

6274
02:11:02,390 --> 02:11:02,400
that argument there's not an argument
 

6275
02:11:02,400 --> 02:11:04,370
that argument there's not an argument
it's a statement but strange things

6276
02:11:04,370 --> 02:11:04,380
it's a statement but strange things
 

6277
02:11:04,380 --> 02:11:08,030
it's a statement but strange things
happen yeah all the time no I agree it

6278
02:11:08,030 --> 02:11:08,040
happen yeah all the time no I agree it
 

6279
02:11:08,040 --> 02:11:10,010
happen yeah all the time no I agree it
doesn't mean that logic doesn't apply

6280
02:11:10,010 --> 02:11:10,020
doesn't mean that logic doesn't apply
 

6281
02:11:10,020 --> 02:11:12,050
doesn't mean that logic doesn't apply
and probabilities don't apply but we

6282
02:11:12,050 --> 02:11:12,060
and probabilities don't apply but we
 

6283
02:11:12,060 --> 02:11:14,689
and probabilities don't apply but we
also I mean in general principle

6284
02:11:14,689 --> 02:11:14,699
also I mean in general principle
 

6285
02:11:14,699 --> 02:11:17,930
also I mean in general principle
everyone if we were honest should be

6286
02:11:17,930 --> 02:11:17,940
everyone if we were honest should be
 

6287
02:11:17,940 --> 02:11:21,050
everyone if we were honest should be
agnostic about everything like I think

6288
02:11:21,050 --> 02:11:21,060
agnostic about everything like I think
 

6289
02:11:21,060 --> 02:11:25,010
agnostic about everything like I think
I'm Jamie but is there a 0.01 chance or

6290
02:11:25,010 --> 02:11:25,020
I'm Jamie but is there a 0.01 chance or
 

6291
02:11:25,020 --> 02:11:28,490
I'm Jamie but is there a 0.01 chance or
001 chance that I'm not but could be I

6292
02:11:28,490 --> 02:11:28,500
001 chance that I'm not but could be I
 

6293
02:11:28,500 --> 02:11:29,990
001 chance that I'm not but could be I
mean there's a large number of people

6294
02:11:29,990 --> 02:11:30,000
mean there's a large number of people
 

6295
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:31,910
mean there's a large number of people
arguing about the meaning of the word I

6296
02:11:31,910 --> 02:11:31,920
arguing about the meaning of the word I
 

6297
02:11:31,920 --> 02:11:34,129
arguing about the meaning of the word I
in that eyes Jamie so exactly what is

6298
02:11:34,129 --> 02:11:34,139
in that eyes Jamie so exactly what is
 

6299
02:11:34,139 --> 02:11:35,990
in that eyes Jamie so exactly what is
conscious exactly exactly so we I mean

6300
02:11:35,990 --> 02:11:36,000
conscious exactly exactly so we I mean
 

6301
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,270
conscious exactly exactly so we I mean
we could spend another three hours going

6302
02:11:38,270 --> 02:11:38,280
we could spend another three hours going
 

6303
02:11:38,280 --> 02:11:40,850
we could spend another three hours going
into that one so one possibility is

6304
02:11:40,850 --> 02:11:40,860
into that one so one possibility is
 

6305
02:11:40,860 --> 02:11:42,709
into that one so one possibility is
there's some remote villager another

6306
02:11:42,709 --> 02:11:42,719
there's some remote villager another
 

6307
02:11:42,719 --> 02:11:46,069
there's some remote villager another
possibility is there's some somehow

6308
02:11:46,069 --> 02:11:46,079
possibility is there's some somehow
 

6309
02:11:46,079 --> 02:11:48,709
possibility is there's some somehow
bizarrely uh there are these infected

6310
02:11:48,709 --> 02:11:48,719
bizarrely uh there are these infected
 

6311
02:11:48,719 --> 02:11:51,109
bizarrely uh there are these infected
animals that come from Southern China

6312
02:11:51,109 --> 02:11:51,119
animals that come from Southern China
 

6313
02:11:51,119 --> 02:11:54,229
animals that come from Southern China
most likely they all maybe there's only

6314
02:11:54,229 --> 02:11:54,239
most likely they all maybe there's only
 

6315
02:11:54,239 --> 02:11:56,330
most likely they all maybe there's only
one of them that's infected which how

6316
02:11:56,330 --> 02:11:56,340
one of them that's infected which how
 

6317
02:11:56,340 --> 02:11:58,129
one of them that's infected which how
could that possibly be

6318
02:11:58,129 --> 02:11:58,139
could that possibly be
 

6319
02:11:58,139 --> 02:12:00,410
could that possibly be
um and it's only sent to Wuhan it's not

6320
02:12:00,410 --> 02:12:00,420
um and it's only sent to Wuhan it's not
 

6321
02:12:00,420 --> 02:12:03,530
um and it's only sent to Wuhan it's not
sent anywhere else uh to any of the

6322
02:12:03,530 --> 02:12:03,540
sent anywhere else uh to any of the
 

6323
02:12:03,540 --> 02:12:04,850
sent anywhere else uh to any of the
markets there or whatever and then maybe

6324
02:12:04,850 --> 02:12:04,860
markets there or whatever and then maybe
 

6325
02:12:04,860 --> 02:12:06,890
markets there or whatever and then maybe
somebody in the market is infected

6326
02:12:06,890 --> 02:12:06,900
somebody in the market is infected
 

6327
02:12:06,900 --> 02:12:09,589
somebody in the market is infected
that's one remote possibility but a

6328
02:12:09,589 --> 02:12:09,599
that's one remote possibility but a
 

6329
02:12:09,599 --> 02:12:13,310
that's one remote possibility but a
possibility another is that researchers

6330
02:12:13,310 --> 02:12:13,320
possibility another is that researchers
 

6331
02:12:13,320 --> 02:12:16,129
possibility another is that researchers
from the Wuhan Institute of virology go

6332
02:12:16,129 --> 02:12:16,139
from the Wuhan Institute of virology go
 

6333
02:12:16,139 --> 02:12:18,169
from the Wuhan Institute of virology go
down to Southern China we didn't we

6334
02:12:18,169 --> 02:12:18,179
down to Southern China we didn't we
 

6335
02:12:18,179 --> 02:12:21,410
down to Southern China we didn't we
haven't talked about it yet but in 2012

6336
02:12:21,410 --> 02:12:21,420
haven't talked about it yet but in 2012
 

6337
02:12:21,420 --> 02:12:23,330
haven't talked about it yet but in 2012
um there were six miners were sent into

6338
02:12:23,330 --> 02:12:23,340
um there were six miners were sent into
 

6339
02:12:23,340 --> 02:12:25,129
um there were six miners were sent into
a copper mine in southern China and

6340
02:12:25,129 --> 02:12:25,139
a copper mine in southern China and
 

6341
02:12:25,139 --> 02:12:27,890
a copper mine in southern China and
Yunnan Province all of them got very

6342
02:12:27,890 --> 02:12:27,900
Yunnan Province all of them got very
 

6343
02:12:27,900 --> 02:12:30,770
Yunnan Province all of them got very
sick with what now appear like covid-19

6344
02:12:30,770 --> 02:12:30,780
sick with what now appear like covid-19
 

6345
02:12:30,780 --> 02:12:34,250
sick with what now appear like covid-19
like symptoms half of them died

6346
02:12:34,250 --> 02:12:34,260
like symptoms half of them died
 

6347
02:12:34,260 --> 02:12:35,689
like symptoms half of them died
um blood samples

6348
02:12:35,689 --> 02:12:35,699
um blood samples
 

6349
02:12:35,699 --> 02:12:38,270
um blood samples
um from them uh were taken to the Wuhan

6350
02:12:38,270 --> 02:12:38,280
um from them uh were taken to the Wuhan
 

6351
02:12:38,280 --> 02:12:41,149
um from them uh were taken to the Wuhan
Institute of virology and elsewhere and

6352
02:12:41,149 --> 02:12:41,159
Institute of virology and elsewhere and
 

6353
02:12:41,159 --> 02:12:42,709
Institute of virology and elsewhere and
then after that

6354
02:12:42,709 --> 02:12:42,719
then after that
 

6355
02:12:42,719 --> 02:12:46,250
then after that
um there the there were multiple uh site

6356
02:12:46,250 --> 02:12:46,260
um there the there were multiple uh site
 

6357
02:12:46,260 --> 02:12:50,089
um there the there were multiple uh site
visits to that mine collecting viral

6358
02:12:50,089 --> 02:12:50,099
visits to that mine collecting viral
 

6359
02:12:50,099 --> 02:12:52,250
visits to that mine collecting viral
samples that were brought to the Wuhan

6360
02:12:52,250 --> 02:12:52,260
samples that were brought to the Wuhan
 

6361
02:12:52,260 --> 02:12:55,189
samples that were brought to the Wuhan
Institute of virology including included

6362
02:12:55,189 --> 02:12:55,199
Institute of virology including included
 

6363
02:12:55,199 --> 02:12:57,830
Institute of virology including included
among those samples were was this now

6364
02:12:57,830 --> 02:12:57,840
among those samples were was this now
 

6365
02:12:57,840 --> 02:13:01,310
among those samples were was this now
Infamous ratg-13 virus which is among

6366
02:13:01,310 --> 02:13:01,320
Infamous ratg-13 virus which is among
 

6367
02:13:01,320 --> 02:13:04,010
Infamous ratg-13 virus which is among
the genetically closest viruses to SARS

6368
02:13:04,010 --> 02:13:04,020
the genetically closest viruses to SARS
 

6369
02:13:04,020 --> 02:13:07,069
the genetically closest viruses to SARS
cov2 there were other nine other or

6370
02:13:07,069 --> 02:13:07,079
cov2 there were other nine other or
 

6371
02:13:07,079 --> 02:13:09,169
cov2 there were other nine other or
eight other viruses that were collected

6372
02:13:09,169 --> 02:13:09,179
eight other viruses that were collected
 

6373
02:13:09,179 --> 02:13:11,689
eight other viruses that were collected
from that mine that were presumably very

6374
02:13:11,689 --> 02:13:11,699
from that mine that were presumably very
 

6375
02:13:11,699 --> 02:13:13,669
from that mine that were presumably very
similar to that and again we have no

6376
02:13:13,669 --> 02:13:13,679
similar to that and again we have no
 

6377
02:13:13,679 --> 02:13:17,629
similar to that and again we have no
access to the information about those

6378
02:13:17,629 --> 02:13:17,639
access to the information about those
 

6379
02:13:17,639 --> 02:13:20,030
access to the information about those
and many of the other most almost all of

6380
02:13:20,030 --> 02:13:20,040
and many of the other most almost all of
 

6381
02:13:20,040 --> 02:13:24,229
and many of the other most almost all of
the other viruses so could it be that

6382
02:13:24,229 --> 02:13:24,239
the other viruses so could it be that
 

6383
02:13:24,239 --> 02:13:26,390
the other viruses so could it be that
one of the people who was sent from the

6384
02:13:26,390 --> 02:13:26,400
one of the people who was sent from the
 

6385
02:13:26,400 --> 02:13:28,129
one of the people who was sent from the
one is to the virology or the Wuhan

6386
02:13:28,129 --> 02:13:28,139
one is to the virology or the Wuhan
 

6387
02:13:28,139 --> 02:13:30,109
one is to the virology or the Wuhan
Center for Centers for Disease Control

6388
02:13:30,109 --> 02:13:30,119
Center for Centers for Disease Control
 

6389
02:13:30,119 --> 02:13:32,750
Center for Centers for Disease Control
they went down there to collect and they

6390
02:13:32,750 --> 02:13:32,760
they went down there to collect and they
 

6391
02:13:32,760 --> 02:13:34,669
they went down there to collect and they
got infected asymptomatically and

6392
02:13:34,669 --> 02:13:34,679
got infected asymptomatically and
 

6393
02:13:34,679 --> 02:13:36,470
got infected asymptomatically and
brought it back could it be that they

6394
02:13:36,470 --> 02:13:36,480
brought it back could it be that they
 

6395
02:13:36,480 --> 02:13:38,689
brought it back could it be that they
were working on these viruses in the

6396
02:13:38,689 --> 02:13:38,699
were working on these viruses in the
 

6397
02:13:38,699 --> 02:13:41,629
were working on these viruses in the
laboratory and there was an issue with

6398
02:13:41,629 --> 02:13:41,639
laboratory and there was an issue with
 

6399
02:13:41,639 --> 02:13:43,850
laboratory and there was an issue with
waste disposal we know that the Wuhan

6400
02:13:43,850 --> 02:13:43,860
waste disposal we know that the Wuhan
 

6401
02:13:43,860 --> 02:13:46,970
waste disposal we know that the Wuhan
CDC had a major problem with waste

6402
02:13:46,970 --> 02:13:46,980
CDC had a major problem with waste
 

6403
02:13:46,980 --> 02:13:49,250
CDC had a major problem with waste
disposal and just before the pandemic

6404
02:13:49,250 --> 02:13:49,260
disposal and just before the pandemic
 

6405
02:13:49,260 --> 02:13:53,149
disposal and just before the pandemic
one they they put out an RFP to fix

6406
02:13:53,149 --> 02:13:53,159
one they they put out an RFP to fix
 

6407
02:13:53,159 --> 02:13:57,290
one they they put out an RFP to fix
their waste disposal and in early 2019

6408
02:13:57,290 --> 02:13:57,300
their waste disposal and in early 2019
 

6409
02:13:57,300 --> 02:14:00,530
their waste disposal and in early 2019
they moved to their new site which was

6410
02:14:00,530 --> 02:14:00,540
they moved to their new site which was
 

6411
02:14:00,540 --> 02:14:02,330
they moved to their new site which was
basically across the street from the

6412
02:14:02,330 --> 02:14:02,340
basically across the street from the
 

6413
02:14:02,340 --> 02:14:04,910
basically across the street from the
Juan on seafood market

6414
02:14:04,910 --> 02:14:04,920
Juan on seafood market
 

6415
02:14:04,920 --> 02:14:06,470
Juan on seafood market
um so could there have been issue of

6416
02:14:06,470 --> 02:14:06,480
um so could there have been issue of
 

6417
02:14:06,480 --> 02:14:09,050
um so could there have been issue of
somebody infected in the lab of waste

6418
02:14:09,050 --> 02:14:09,060

recently passed a law saying it's

6424
02:14:14,390 --> 02:14:14,400
recently passed a law saying it's
 

6425
02:14:14,400 --> 02:14:18,050
recently passed a law saying it's
illegal to sell laboratory animals in

6426
02:14:18,050 --> 02:14:18,060
illegal to sell laboratory animals in
 

6427
02:14:18,060 --> 02:14:20,209
illegal to sell laboratory animals in
the market because there were scientists

6428
02:14:20,209 --> 02:14:20,219
the market because there were scientists
 

6429
02:14:20,219 --> 02:14:22,149
the market because there were scientists
or once scientist who was selling

6430
02:14:22,149 --> 02:14:22,159
or once scientist who was selling
 

6431
02:14:22,159 --> 02:14:24,950
or once scientist who was selling
laboratory animals in the market and

6432
02:14:24,950 --> 02:14:24,960
laboratory animals in the market and
 

6433
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:27,470
laboratory animals in the market and
people would just come and and buy

6434
02:14:27,470 --> 02:14:27,480
people would just come and and buy
 

6435
02:14:27,480 --> 02:14:30,109
people would just come and and buy
they'd say so there's so many there are

6436
02:14:30,109 --> 02:14:30,119
they'd say so there's so many there are
 

6437
02:14:30,119 --> 02:14:30,950
they'd say so there's so many there are
so many

6438
02:14:30,950 --> 02:14:30,960
so many
 

6439
02:14:30,960 --> 02:14:33,290
so many
scenarios but if I again connect it to

6440
02:14:33,290 --> 02:14:33,300
scenarios but if I again connect it to
 

6441
02:14:33,300 --> 02:14:36,830
scenarios but if I again connect it to
my 85 number I think in the whole

6442
02:14:36,830 --> 02:14:36,840
my 85 number I think in the whole
 

6443
02:14:36,840 --> 02:14:38,589
my 85 number I think in the whole
category of

6444
02:14:38,589 --> 02:14:38,599
category of
 

6445
02:14:38,599 --> 02:14:40,790
category of
laboratory related incidents whether

6446
02:14:40,790 --> 02:14:40,800
laboratory related incidents whether
 

6447
02:14:40,800 --> 02:14:43,370
laboratory related incidents whether
it's collection waste something

6448
02:14:43,370 --> 02:14:43,380
it's collection waste something
 

6449
02:14:43,380 --> 02:14:46,069
it's collection waste something
connected to the lab I think that's

6450
02:14:46,069 --> 02:14:46,079
connected to the lab I think that's
 

6451
02:14:46,079 --> 02:14:48,229
connected to the lab I think that's
um that's the most likely but there are

6452
02:14:48,229 --> 02:14:48,239
um that's the most likely but there are
 

6453
02:14:48,239 --> 02:14:49,910
um that's the most likely but there are
other credible people

6454
02:14:49,910 --> 02:14:49,920
other credible people
 

6455
02:14:49,920 --> 02:14:52,189
other credible people
um who would say they think it's not the

6456
02:14:52,189 --> 02:14:52,199
um who would say they think it's not the
 

6457
02:14:52,199 --> 02:14:54,770
um who would say they think it's not the
most likely and I I welcome their views

6458
02:14:54,770 --> 02:14:54,780
most likely and I I welcome their views
 

6459
02:14:54,780 --> 02:14:55,790
most likely and I I welcome their views
and and we need to have this

6460
02:14:55,790 --> 02:14:55,800
and and we need to have this
 

6461
02:14:55,800 --> 02:14:58,250
and and we need to have this
conversation so in your write-up

6462
02:14:58,250 --> 02:14:58,260
conversation so in your write-up
 

6463
02:14:58,260 --> 02:15:00,770
conversation so in your write-up
um but what's the URL because I always

6464
02:15:00,770 --> 02:15:00,780
um but what's the URL because I always
 

6465
02:15:00,780 --> 02:15:03,350
um but what's the URL because I always
find it by doing Jamie Marshall uh lab

6466
02:15:03,350 --> 02:15:03,360
find it by doing Jamie Marshall uh lab
 

6467
02:15:03,360 --> 02:15:06,589
find it by doing Jamie Marshall uh lab
leak yeah that's probably the idea no no

6468
02:15:06,589 --> 02:15:06,599
leak yeah that's probably the idea no no
 

6469
02:15:06,599 --> 02:15:10,330

6479
02:15:22,440 --> 02:15:24,169
oblique uh um Google's search engine is
such a powerful thing you mentioned in

6480
02:15:24,169 --> 02:15:24,179
such a powerful thing you mentioned in
 

6481
02:15:24,179 --> 02:15:27,770
such a powerful thing you mentioned in
that write up that you don't think this

6482
02:15:27,770 --> 02:15:27,780
that write up that you don't think this
 

6483
02:15:27,780 --> 02:15:29,810
that write up that you don't think this
could be just me misreading it or it was

6484
02:15:29,810 --> 02:15:29,820
could be just me misreading it or it was
 

6485
02:15:29,820 --> 02:15:32,810
could be just me misreading it or it was
just slightly miswritten but you don't

6486
02:15:32,810 --> 02:15:32,820
just slightly miswritten but you don't
 

6487
02:15:32,820 --> 02:15:36,410
just slightly miswritten but you don't
think that the virus is from that 2012

6488
02:15:36,410 --> 02:15:36,420
think that the virus is from that 2012
 

6489
02:15:36,420 --> 02:15:38,810
think that the virus is from that 2012
mind which is fascinating could be the

6490
02:15:38,810 --> 02:15:38,820
mind which is fascinating could be the
 

6491
02:15:38,820 --> 02:15:41,510
mind which is fascinating could be the
backbone for SARS cov2 so what I mean

6492
02:15:41,510 --> 02:15:41,520
backbone for SARS cov2 so what I mean
 

6493
02:15:41,520 --> 02:15:44,209
backbone for SARS cov2 so what I mean
just the specific virus which I

6494
02:15:44,209 --> 02:15:44,219
just the specific virus which I
 

6495
02:15:44,219 --> 02:15:46,609
just the specific virus which I
mentioned ratg 13 and there's a whole

6496
02:15:46,609 --> 02:15:46,619
mentioned ratg 13 and there's a whole
 

6497
02:15:46,619 --> 02:15:49,669
mentioned ratg 13 and there's a whole
history of that because it had a

6498
02:15:49,669 --> 02:15:49,679
history of that because it had a
 

6499
02:15:49,679 --> 02:15:51,950
history of that because it had a
different name and it looked and and

6500
02:15:51,950 --> 02:15:51,960
different name and it looked and and
 

6501
02:15:51,960 --> 02:15:54,169
different name and it looked and and
should jang li provided wrong

6502
02:15:54,169 --> 02:15:54,179
should jang li provided wrong
 

6503
02:15:54,179 --> 02:15:56,209
should jang li provided wrong
information about when it had been

6504
02:15:56,209 --> 02:15:56,219
information about when it had been
 

6505
02:15:56,219 --> 02:15:58,910
information about when it had been
sequenced I mean there was a whole issue

6506
02:15:58,910 --> 02:15:58,920
sequenced I mean there was a whole issue
 

6507
02:15:58,920 --> 02:16:02,390
sequenced I mean there was a whole issue
connected uh to that uh but the genetic

6508
02:16:02,390 --> 02:16:02,400
connected uh to that uh but the genetic
 

6509
02:16:02,400 --> 02:16:07,069
connected uh to that uh but the genetic
difference even though it's um it's 96.2

6510
02:16:07,069 --> 02:16:07,079
difference even though it's um it's 96.2
 

6511
02:16:07,079 --> 02:16:09,770
difference even though it's um it's 96.2
percent similar to the SARS cov2 virus

6512
02:16:09,770 --> 02:16:09,780
percent similar to the SARS cov2 virus
 

6513
02:16:09,780 --> 02:16:12,290
percent similar to the SARS cov2 virus
that's actually a significant difference

6514
02:16:12,290 --> 02:16:12,300
that's actually a significant difference
 

6515
02:16:12,300 --> 02:16:15,310
that's actually a significant difference
even though that and and a

6516
02:16:15,310 --> 02:16:15,320
even though that and and a
 

6517
02:16:15,320 --> 02:16:18,290
even though that and and a
virus called banal 52 that was collected

6518
02:16:18,290 --> 02:16:18,300
virus called banal 52 that was collected
 

6519
02:16:18,300 --> 02:16:20,689
virus called banal 52 that was collected
in Laos are the two most similar there

6520
02:16:20,689 --> 02:16:20,699
in Laos are the two most similar there
 

6521
02:16:20,699 --> 02:16:22,850
in Laos are the two most similar there
still are are differences so I'm not

6522
02:16:22,850 --> 02:16:22,860
still are are differences so I'm not
 

6523
02:16:22,860 --> 02:16:25,729
still are are differences so I'm not
saying ritg 13 is the backbone

6524
02:16:25,729 --> 02:16:25,739
saying ritg 13 is the backbone
 

6525
02:16:25,739 --> 02:16:28,250
saying ritg 13 is the backbone
um but is there I believe there is a

6526
02:16:28,250 --> 02:16:28,260
um but is there I believe there is a
 

6527
02:16:28,260 --> 02:16:31,189
um but is there I believe there is a
possibility that other viruses that were

6528
02:16:31,189 --> 02:16:31,199
possibility that other viruses that were
 

6529
02:16:31,199 --> 02:16:34,969
possibility that other viruses that were
collected either are in that mine in in

6530
02:16:34,969 --> 02:16:34,979
collected either are in that mine in in
 

6531
02:16:34,979 --> 02:16:38,870
collected either are in that mine in in
Yunnan in southern China or in Laos or

6532
02:16:38,870 --> 02:16:38,880
Yunnan in southern China or in Laos or
 

6533
02:16:38,880 --> 02:16:41,330
Yunnan in southern China or in Laos or
Cambodia because that was with the Eco

6534
02:16:41,330 --> 02:16:41,340
Cambodia because that was with the Eco
 

6535
02:16:41,340 --> 02:16:43,009

um proposals and documents their plan

6538
02:16:45,889 --> 02:16:45,899
um proposals and documents their plan
 

6539
02:16:45,899 --> 02:16:49,910
um proposals and documents their plan
was to collect viruses in Laos and and

6540
02:16:49,910 --> 02:16:49,920
was to collect viruses in Laos and and
 

6541
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:52,549
was to collect viruses in Laos and and
Cambodian elsewhere and bring them to

6542
02:16:52,549 --> 02:16:52,559
Cambodian elsewhere and bring them to
 

6543
02:16:52,559 --> 02:16:54,770
Cambodian elsewhere and bring them to
the Wuhan Institute of virology so that

6544
02:16:54,770 --> 02:16:54,780
the Wuhan Institute of virology so that
 

6545
02:16:54,780 --> 02:16:56,150
the Wuhan Institute of virology so that
there are people as a matter of fact

6546
02:16:56,150 --> 02:16:56,160
there are people as a matter of fact
 

6547
02:16:56,160 --> 02:16:57,889
there are people as a matter of fact
just when I was sitting here before this

6548
02:16:57,889 --> 02:16:57,899
just when I was sitting here before this
 

6549
02:16:57,899 --> 02:17:01,250
just when I was sitting here before this
message I got before this interview I

6550
02:17:01,250 --> 02:17:01,260
message I got before this interview I
 

6551
02:17:01,260 --> 02:17:03,469
message I got before this interview I
got a message uh from somebody who was

6552
02:17:03,469 --> 02:17:03,479
got a message uh from somebody who was
 

6553
02:17:03,479 --> 02:17:05,030
got a message uh from somebody who was
saying well Peter dazak is telling

6554
02:17:05,030 --> 02:17:05,040
saying well Peter dazak is telling
 

6555
02:17:05,040 --> 02:17:07,790
saying well Peter dazak is telling
everybody uh that the that the viral

6556
02:17:07,790 --> 02:17:07,800
everybody uh that the that the viral
 

6557
02:17:07,800 --> 02:17:11,169
everybody uh that the that the viral
sample the banal 52 from Laos proves

6558
02:17:11,169 --> 02:17:11,179
sample the banal 52 from Laos proves
 

6559
02:17:11,179 --> 02:17:13,790
sample the banal 52 from Laos proves
that there's not a lab incident origin

6560
02:17:13,790 --> 02:17:13,800
that there's not a lab incident origin
 

6561
02:17:13,800 --> 02:17:15,410
that there's not a lab incident origin
of the pandemic and it's actually

6562
02:17:15,410 --> 02:17:15,420
of the pandemic and it's actually
 

6563
02:17:15,420 --> 02:17:18,169
of the pandemic and it's actually
doesn't prove that at all because these

6564
02:17:18,169 --> 02:17:18,179
doesn't prove that at all because these
 

6565
02:17:18,179 --> 02:17:21,169
doesn't prove that at all because these
viruses were being collected in places

6566
02:17:21,169 --> 02:17:21,179
viruses were being collected in places
 

6567
02:17:21,179 --> 02:17:24,709
viruses were being collected in places
like uh Laos and and Cambodia and being

6568
02:17:24,709 --> 02:17:24,719
like uh Laos and and Cambodia and being
 

6569
02:17:24,719 --> 02:17:27,290
like uh Laos and and Cambodia and being
brought to the Wuhan Institute of

6570
02:17:27,290 --> 02:17:27,300
brought to the Wuhan Institute of
 

6571
02:17:27,300 --> 02:17:30,190
brought to the Wuhan Institute of
virology so those are like early early

6572
02:17:30,190 --> 02:17:30,200
virology so those are like early early
 

6573
02:17:30,200 --> 02:17:33,650
virology so those are like early early
uh like the the prequel so these are

6574
02:17:33,650 --> 02:17:33,660
uh like the the prequel so these are
 

6575
02:17:33,660 --> 02:17:36,469
uh like the the prequel so these are
they're not sufficiently similar to be a

6576
02:17:36,469 --> 02:17:36,479
they're not sufficiently similar to be a
 

6577
02:17:36,479 --> 02:17:38,209
they're not sufficiently similar to be a
to serve as a backbone but they kind of

6578
02:17:38,209 --> 02:17:38,219
to serve as a backbone but they kind of
 

6579
02:17:38,219 --> 02:17:39,889
to serve as a backbone but they kind of
tell a story that they could have been

6580
02:17:39,889 --> 02:17:39,899
tell a story that they could have been
 

6581
02:17:39,899 --> 02:17:42,049
tell a story that they could have been
brought to the lab through uh through

6582
02:17:42,049 --> 02:17:42,059
brought to the lab through uh through
 

6583
02:17:42,059 --> 02:17:44,509
brought to the lab through uh through
several processes including genetic

6584
02:17:44,509 --> 02:17:44,519
several processes including genetic
 

6585
02:17:44,519 --> 02:17:46,370
several processes including genetic
modification or throughout the Natural

6589
02:17:48,240 --> 02:17:49,969
Evolution processes accelerated
Evolution they could have arrived as

6590
02:17:49,969 --> 02:17:49,979
Evolution they could have arrived as
 

6591
02:17:49,979 --> 02:17:52,549
Evolution they could have arrived as
something that has the the the spike

6592
02:17:52,549 --> 02:17:52,559
something that has the the the spike
 

6593
02:17:52,559 --> 02:17:54,250
something that has the the the spike
protein and the cleavage

6594
02:17:54,250 --> 02:17:54,260
protein and the cleavage
 

6595
02:17:54,260 --> 02:17:56,690
protein and the cleavage
the fern cleavage side and all that kind

6596
02:17:56,690 --> 02:17:56,700
the fern cleavage side and all that kind
 

6597
02:17:56,700 --> 02:17:59,030
the fern cleavage side and all that kind
of stuff so what I'm saying is the the

6598
02:17:59,030 --> 02:17:59,040
of stuff so what I'm saying is the the
 

6599
02:17:59,040 --> 02:18:02,389
of stuff so what I'm saying is the the
essential point is if we had access if

6600
02:18:02,389 --> 02:18:02,399
essential point is if we had access if
 

6601
02:18:02,399 --> 02:18:04,549
essential point is if we had access if
we knew everything that was being every

we had full access we had full access to
 

6609
02:18:12,359 --> 02:18:14,809
we had full access we had full access to
everybody's lab notes and we did just

6610
02:18:14,809 --> 02:18:14,819
everybody's lab notes and we did just
 

6611
02:18:14,819 --> 02:18:16,969
everybody's lab notes and we did just
the kind of forensic investigation that

6612
02:18:16,969 --> 02:18:16,979
the kind of forensic investigation that
 

6613
02:18:16,979 --> 02:18:20,030
the kind of forensic investigation that
has been so desperately required since

6614
02:18:20,030 --> 02:18:20,040
has been so desperately required since

incident hypothesis in my mind that's

6630
02:18:40,309 --> 02:18:40,319
incident hypothesis in my mind that's
 

6631
02:18:40,319 --> 02:18:42,530
incident hypothesis in my mind that's
almost certainly why they are preventing

that our that what ritg-13 says is

6638
02:18:52,190 --> 02:18:52,200
that our that what ritg-13 says is
 

6639
02:18:52,200 --> 02:18:55,190
that our that what ritg-13 says is
because as I mentioned earlier the the

6640
02:18:55,190 --> 02:18:55,200
because as I mentioned earlier the the
 

6641
02:18:55,200 --> 02:18:57,469
because as I mentioned earlier the the
genetics of virus are are constantly

02:18:59,280 --> 02:19:01,549
recombinating
um so that what that means is if you

6646
02:19:01,549 --> 02:19:01,559
um so that what that means is if you
 

6647
02:19:01,559 --> 02:19:04,070
um so that what that means is if you
have you don't have very many total

6648
02:19:04,070 --> 02:19:04,080
have you don't have very many total

because these viruses are always mixing

6652
02:19:09,889 --> 02:19:09,899
because these viruses are always mixing
 

6653
02:19:09,899 --> 02:19:12,349
because these viruses are always mixing
and matching with each other and so if

6654
02:19:12,349 --> 02:19:12,359
and matching with each other and so if
 

6655
02:19:12,359 --> 02:19:15,709
and matching with each other and so if
you have rotg 13 which is relatively

you have rotg 13 which is relatively
similar to SARS cov2 there's a pretty

02:19:18,169 --> 02:19:18,179
similar to SARS cov2 there's a pretty
 

6659
02:19:18,179 --> 02:19:20,389

6731
02:20:45,120 --> 02:20:48,650
know how to trace the origin of a virus
and the opposite is is the case so I

6732
02:20:48,650 --> 02:20:48,660
and the opposite is is the case so I
 

6733
02:20:48,660 --> 02:20:50,570
and the opposite is is the case so I
think there are people in China who at

6734
02:20:50,570 --> 02:20:50,580
think there are people in China who at
 

6735
02:20:50,580 --> 02:20:53,630
think there are people in China who at
least know a lot they know a lot more uh

6736
02:20:53,630 --> 02:20:53,640
least know a lot they know a lot more uh
 

6737
02:20:53,640 --> 02:20:57,050
least know a lot they know a lot more uh
than they're saying uh and at the best

6738
02:20:57,050 --> 02:20:57,060
than they're saying uh and at the best
 

6739
02:20:57,060 --> 02:20:58,910
than they're saying uh and at the best
case scenario is the Chinese government

6740
02:20:58,910 --> 02:20:58,920
case scenario is the Chinese government
 

6741
02:20:58,920 --> 02:21:01,130
case scenario is the Chinese government
wants to prevent any investigation

6742

how do we build a safer world for
everyone and so that's the The Who if we

6812
02:22:33,950 --> 02:22:33,960
everyone and so that's the The Who if we
 

6813

everyone and so that's the The Who if we
although there are many critics of the

6814
02:22:35,809 --> 02:22:35,819
although there are many critics of the
 

6815
02:22:35,819 --> 02:22:38,389
although there are many critics of the
who if we didn't have it we would need

6816
02:22:38,389 --> 02:22:38,399
who if we didn't have it we would need
 

6817
02:22:38,399 --> 02:22:41,630
who if we didn't have it we would need
to invent it because the whole nature of

6818
02:22:41,630 --> 02:22:41,640
to invent it because the whole nature of
 

6819
02:22:41,640 --> 02:22:44,450
to invent it because the whole nature of
these uh big public health issues and

6820
02:22:44,450 --> 02:22:44,460
these uh big public health issues and
 

6821
02:22:44,460 --> 02:22:47,270
these uh big public health issues and
certainly for uh pandemics but all sorts

6822
02:22:47,270 --> 02:22:47,280
certainly for uh pandemics but all sorts
 

6823
02:22:47,280 --> 02:22:49,790
certainly for uh pandemics but all sorts
of things is that they are transnational

6824
02:22:49,790 --> 02:22:49,800
of things is that they are transnational
 

6825
02:22:49,800 --> 02:22:53,230
of things is that they are transnational
in nature and so we cannot just build

6826
02:22:53,230 --> 02:22:53,240
in nature and so we cannot just build
 

6827
02:22:53,240 --> 02:22:56,330
in nature and so we cannot just build
moats we cannot build walls we are all

6828
02:22:56,330 --> 02:22:56,340
moats we cannot build walls we are all
 

6829
02:22:56,340 --> 02:22:59,690
moats we cannot build walls we are all
connected to us so that's the the idea

6830
02:22:59,690 --> 02:22:59,700
connected to us so that's the the idea
 

6831
02:22:59,700 --> 02:23:01,730
connected to us so that's the the idea
um there's a political process because

the United Nations and the who is part
of it

02:23:05,270 --> 02:23:05,280
of it
 

6837
02:23:05,280 --> 02:23:07,790
of it
um is it there it exists within a

6838
02:23:07,790 --> 02:23:07,800
um is it there it exists within a
 

6839
02:23:07,800 --> 02:23:10,610
um is it there it exists within a
political context and so the the current

6840
02:23:10,610 --> 02:23:10,620
political context and so the the current
 

6841
02:23:10,620 --> 02:23:12,469
political context and so the the current

argument like it's it's not completely

6978
02:25:59,750 --> 02:25:59,760

6979
02:25:59,760 --> 02:26:02,230
argument like it's it's not completely
obvious that that's a terrible decision

6980
02:26:02,230 --> 02:26:02,240
obvious that that's a terrible decision
 

6981
02:26:02,240 --> 02:26:05,210
obvious that that's a terrible decision
like if uh you or and I were in that

6982
02:26:05,210 --> 02:26:05,220
like if uh you or and I were in that
 

6983
02:26:05,220 --> 02:26:07,250
like if uh you or and I were in that
role we would make that decision it's

6984
02:26:07,250 --> 02:26:07,260
role we would make that decision it's
 

6985
02:26:07,260 --> 02:26:10,010
role we would make that decision it's
complicated because like you want China

6986
02:26:10,010 --> 02:26:10,020
complicated because like you want China
 

6987

this amazing that we got
 

7049
02:27:22,080 --> 02:27:25,250
this amazing that we got
the the sequence like like that's

7050
02:27:25,250 --> 02:27:25,260
the the sequence like like that's
 

7051
02:27:25,260 --> 02:27:26,809
the the sequence like like that's
amazing and then the scientific

02:30:32,460 --> 02:30:35,389
access to Raw data the Chinese side
would give them conclusions based on

7204
02:30:35,389 --> 02:30:35,399
would give them conclusions based on
 

7205
02:30:35,399 --> 02:30:37,849
would give them conclusions based on
their own analysis this of the raw data

7206
02:30:37,849 --> 02:30:37,859
their own analysis this of the raw data
 

7207
02:30:37,859 --> 02:30:39,710
their own analysis this of the raw data
which was totally outrageous

7208
02:30:39,710 --> 02:30:39,720
which was totally outrageous
 

7209
02:30:39,720 --> 02:30:42,230
which was totally outrageous
so then and I was a big eye and and

7210
02:30:42,230 --> 02:30:42,240
so then and I was a big eye and and
 

7211

we've never met in person Gil de Manoff
 

7215
02:30:47,100 --> 02:30:49,190
we've never met in person Gil de Manoff
in New Zealand he did a great job of

7216
02:30:49,190 --> 02:30:49,200
in New Zealand he did a great job of
 

7217
02:30:49,200 --> 02:30:51,710
in New Zealand he did a great job of
chronicling just the letter by letter of

7218
02:30:51,710 --> 02:30:51,720
chronicling just the letter by letter of

02:31:18,120 --> 02:31:20,690
then part of their examination was going
for one month to Wuhan and the nature of

it was to have a joint study into the
 

7257
02:31:38,340 --> 02:31:40,730
it was to have a joint study into the
zoonotic origins of the virus which

7258
02:31:40,730 --> 02:31:40,740
zoonotic origins of the virus which
 

7259
02:31:40,740 --> 02:31:44,210
zoonotic origins of the virus which
means which was interpreted to mean the

7260
02:31:44,210 --> 02:31:44,220
means which was interpreted to mean the
 

7261
02:31:44,220 --> 02:31:46,510
means which was interpreted to mean the
natural Origins hypothesis

7262
02:31:46,510 --> 02:31:46,520
natural Origins hypothesis
 

7263
02:31:46,520 --> 02:31:50,210

for a single hypothesis not so that they
 

7265
02:31:50,220 --> 02:31:53,030
for a single hypothesis not so that they
weren't empowered to to examine the lab

7266
02:31:53,030 --> 02:31:53,040
weren't empowered to to examine the lab
 

7267
02:31:53,040 --> 02:31:55,490

a basically tearing tearing down the
 

8021
02:47:42,420 --> 02:47:46,309
a basically tearing tearing down the
bullshitters they don't want to uh do

8022
02:47:46,309 --> 02:47:46,319
bullshitters they don't want to uh do
 

8023
02:47:46,319 --> 02:47:49,610
bullshitters they don't want to uh do
the further steps of building and so as

8024
02:47:49,610 --> 02:47:49,620
the further steps of building and so as
 

8025
02:47:49,620 --> 02:47:51,410
the further steps of building and so as
a Chinese government I would be nervous

8026
02:47:51,410 --> 02:47:51,420
a Chinese government I would be nervous
 

8027
02:47:51,420 --> 02:47:53,330
a Chinese government I would be nervous
about being transparent with anybody

8028
02:47:53,330 --> 02:47:53,340
about being transparent with anybody
 

8029
02:47:53,340 --> 02:47:57,290
about being transparent with anybody
that just wants to tear our power

8030
02:47:57,290 --> 02:47:57,300
that just wants to tear our power
 

8031
02:47:57,300 --> 02:47:59,330
that just wants to tear our power
centers our power structures down anyway

8032
02:47:59,330 --> 02:47:59,340
centers our power structures down anyway
 

8033
02:47:59,340 --> 02:48:01,490
centers our power structures down anyway
that's a long way to ask like

8034
02:48:01,490 --> 02:48:01,500
that's a long way to ask like
 

8035
02:48:01,500 --> 02:48:04,490
that's a long way to ask like
how how should the Chinese government be

8036
02:48:04,490 --> 02:48:04,500
how how should the Chinese government be
 

8037
02:48:04,500 --> 02:48:08,389
how how should the Chinese government be
transparent now and in the future

8038
02:48:08,389 --> 02:48:08,399
transparent now and in the future
 

8039
02:48:08,399 --> 02:48:10,910
transparent now and in the future
so maybe I'll break that down into a few

8040
02:48:10,910 --> 02:48:10,920
so maybe I'll break that down into a few
 

8041
02:48:10,920 --> 02:48:14,330
so maybe I'll break that down into a few
sub questions the first is what should

8042
02:48:14,330 --> 02:48:14,340
sub questions the first is what should
 

8043
02:48:14,340 --> 02:48:16,610
sub questions the first is what should
in an Ideal World what should the

8044
02:48:16,610 --> 02:48:16,620
in an Ideal World what should the
 

8045
02:48:16,620 --> 02:48:18,469
in an Ideal World what should the
Chinese government do and and that's

8046
02:48:18,469 --> 02:48:18,479
Chinese government do and and that's
 

8047
02:48:18,479 --> 02:48:20,950
Chinese government do and and that's
pretty straightforward they should be

8048
02:48:20,950 --> 02:48:20,960
pretty straightforward they should be
 

8049
02:48:20,960 --> 02:48:23,570
pretty straightforward they should be
totally transparent the South African

8050
02:48:23,570 --> 02:48:23,580
totally transparent the South African
 

8051
02:48:23,580 --> 02:48:26,090
totally transparent the South African
government now there's an outbreak of

8052
02:48:26,090 --> 02:48:26,100
government now there's an outbreak of
 

8053
02:48:26,100 --> 02:48:28,610
government now there's an outbreak of
this uh Omicron variant and the the

8054
02:48:28,610 --> 02:48:28,620
this uh Omicron variant and the the
 

8055
02:48:28,620 --> 02:48:30,290
this uh Omicron variant and the the
South African government has done what

8056
02:48:30,290 --> 02:48:30,300
South African government has done what
 

8057
02:48:30,300 --> 02:48:32,570
South African government has done what
we would want a government to do is say

8058
02:48:32,570 --> 02:48:32,580
we would want a government to do is say
 

8059
02:48:32,580 --> 02:48:33,769
we would want a government to do is say
hey there's an outbreak we don't have

8060
02:48:33,769 --> 02:48:33,779
hey there's an outbreak we don't have
 

8061
02:48:33,779 --> 02:48:37,010
hey there's an outbreak we don't have
all of the information we need help we

8062
02:48:37,010 --> 02:48:37,020
all of the information we need help we
 

8063
02:48:37,020 --> 02:48:39,530
all of the information we need help we
want to alert the world and in some ways

8064
02:48:39,530 --> 02:48:39,540
want to alert the world and in some ways
 

8065
02:48:39,540 --> 02:48:41,269
want to alert the world and in some ways
they're being punished for it through

8066
02:48:41,269 --> 02:48:41,279
they're being punished for it through
 

8067
02:48:41,279 --> 02:48:43,370
they're being punished for it through
these travel bans but it's a separate

8068
02:48:43,370 --> 02:48:43,380
these travel bans but it's a separate
 

8069
02:48:43,380 --> 02:48:45,710
these travel bans but it's a separate
topic but I actually think short-term

8070
02:48:45,710 --> 02:48:45,720
topic but I actually think short-term
 

8071
02:48:45,720 --> 02:48:47,570
topic but I actually think short-term
travel bans actually are not a terrible

8072
02:48:47,570 --> 02:48:47,580
travel bans actually are not a terrible
 

8073
02:48:47,580 --> 02:48:49,190
travel bans actually are not a terrible
idea

8074
02:48:49,190 --> 02:48:49,200
idea
 

8075
02:48:49,200 --> 02:48:51,290
idea
um they should have in on day one if

8076
02:48:51,290 --> 02:48:51,300
um they should have in on day one if
 

8077
02:48:51,300 --> 02:48:53,570
um they should have in on day one if
they uh they should have allowed uh who

8078
02:48:53,570 --> 02:48:53,580
they uh they should have allowed uh who
 

8079
02:48:53,580 --> 02:48:56,030
they uh they should have allowed uh who
experts in they should have shared

8080
02:48:56,030 --> 02:48:56,040
experts in they should have shared
 

8081
02:48:56,040 --> 02:48:58,490
experts in they should have shared
information uh they should have allowed

8082
02:48:58,490 --> 02:48:58,500
information uh they should have allowed
 

8083
02:48:58,500 --> 02:49:02,030
information uh they should have allowed
a full and comprehensive investigation

8084
02:49:02,030 --> 02:49:02,040
a full and comprehensive investigation
 

8085
02:49:02,040 --> 02:49:04,550
a full and comprehensive investigation
um with uh International Partnerships to

8086
02:49:04,550 --> 02:49:04,560
um with uh International Partnerships to
 

8087
02:49:04,560 --> 02:49:08,150
um with uh International Partnerships to
understand uh what went wrong they

8088
02:49:08,150 --> 02:49:08,160
understand uh what went wrong they
 

8089
02:49:08,160 --> 02:49:10,969
understand uh what went wrong they
should have shared their raw data they

8090
02:49:10,969 --> 02:49:10,979
should have shared their raw data they
 

8091
02:49:10,979 --> 02:49:13,250
should have shared their raw data they
should have allowed their scientists to

8092
02:49:13,250 --> 02:49:13,260
should have allowed their scientists to
 

8093
02:49:13,260 --> 02:49:15,349
should have allowed their scientists to
speak and write publicly because nobody

8094
02:49:15,349 --> 02:49:15,359
speak and write publicly because nobody
 

8095
02:49:15,359 --> 02:49:17,570
speak and write publicly because nobody
knows more about this stuff certainly in

8096
02:49:17,570 --> 02:49:17,580
knows more about this stuff certainly in
 

8097
02:49:17,580 --> 02:49:19,910
knows more about this stuff certainly in
the early days than their scientists do

8098
02:49:19,910 --> 02:49:19,920
the early days than their scientists do
 

8099
02:49:19,920 --> 02:49:24,349
the early days than their scientists do
so it's relatively easy to say

8100
02:49:24,349 --> 02:49:24,359
so it's relatively easy to say
 

8101
02:49:24,359 --> 02:49:27,290
so it's relatively easy to say
um what they what they should do it's a

8102
02:49:27,290 --> 02:49:27,300
um what they what they should do it's a
 

8103
02:49:27,300 --> 02:49:29,030
um what they what they should do it's a
hard question to say well what would

8104
02:49:29,030 --> 02:49:29,040
hard question to say well what would
 

8105
02:49:29,040 --> 02:49:30,830
hard question to say well what would
happen let's just say

8106
02:49:30,830 --> 02:49:30,840
happen let's just say
 

8107
02:49:30,840 --> 02:49:34,610
happen let's just say
um let's just say tomorrow we prove for

8108
02:49:34,610 --> 02:49:34,620
um let's just say tomorrow we prove for
 

8109
02:49:34,620 --> 02:49:37,190
um let's just say tomorrow we prove for
certain that this pandemic stems from an

8110
02:49:37,190 --> 02:49:37,200
certain that this pandemic stems from an
 

8111
02:49:37,200 --> 02:49:39,769
certain that this pandemic stems from an
both from an accidental lab incident and

8112
02:49:39,769 --> 02:49:39,779
both from an accidental lab incident and
 

8113
02:49:39,779 --> 02:49:41,210
both from an accidental lab incident and
then from what I've consistently called

8114
02:49:41,210 --> 02:49:41,220
then from what I've consistently called
 

8115
02:49:41,220 --> 02:49:44,090
then from what I've consistently called
a criminal cover-up because if the

8116
02:49:44,090 --> 02:49:44,100
a criminal cover-up because if the
 

8117
02:49:44,100 --> 02:49:46,790
a criminal cover-up because if the
cover-up has done in many ways as much

8118
02:49:46,790 --> 02:49:46,800
cover-up has done in many ways as much
 

8119
02:49:46,800 --> 02:49:49,070
cover-up has done in many ways as much
or more damage than than and the

8120
02:49:49,070 --> 02:49:49,080
or more damage than than and the
 

8121
02:49:49,080 --> 02:49:51,349
or more damage than than and the
incident Mo what happens you could

8122
02:49:51,349 --> 02:49:51,359
incident Mo what happens you could
 

8123
02:49:51,359 --> 02:49:53,809
incident Mo what happens you could
easily imagine Xi Jinping has had two

8124
02:49:53,809 --> 02:49:53,819
easily imagine Xi Jinping has had two
 

8125
02:49:53,819 --> 02:49:57,290
easily imagine Xi Jinping has had two
terms as as the the leader of of China

8126
02:49:57,290 --> 02:49:57,300
terms as as the the leader of of China
 

8127
02:49:57,300 --> 02:50:00,070
terms as as the the leader of of China
and he can now have unlimited turns

8128
02:50:00,070 --> 02:50:00,080
and he can now have unlimited turns
 

8129
02:50:00,080 --> 02:50:02,030
and he can now have unlimited turns
they've changed the rules for that but

8130
02:50:02,030 --> 02:50:02,040
they've changed the rules for that but
 

8131
02:50:02,040 --> 02:50:04,010
they've changed the rules for that but
he's got a lot of enemies I mean there

8132
02:50:04,010 --> 02:50:04,020
he's got a lot of enemies I mean there
 

8133
02:50:04,020 --> 02:50:05,690
he's got a lot of enemies I mean there
are a lot of people who are waiting in

8134
02:50:05,690 --> 02:50:05,700
are a lot of people who are waiting in
 

8135
02:50:05,700 --> 02:50:08,990
are a lot of people who are waiting in
line to to step up so it is there a

8136
02:50:08,990 --> 02:50:09,000
line to to step up so it is there a
 

8137
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:11,210
line to to step up so it is there a
chance that Xi Jinping could be deposed

8138
02:50:11,210 --> 02:50:11,220
chance that Xi Jinping could be deposed
 

8139
02:50:11,220 --> 02:50:13,070
chance that Xi Jinping could be deposed
if it was proven that this comes from a

8140
02:50:13,070 --> 02:50:13,080
if it was proven that this comes from a
 

8141
02:50:13,080 --> 02:50:14,150
if it was proven that this comes from a
lab is it I think there's a real

8142
02:50:14,150 --> 02:50:14,160
lab is it I think there's a real
 

8143
02:50:14,160 --> 02:50:15,650
lab is it I think there's a real
possibility

8144
02:50:15,650 --> 02:50:15,660
possibility
 

8145
02:50:15,660 --> 02:50:18,050
possibility
um would uh people in the United States

8146
02:50:18,050 --> 02:50:18,060
um would uh people in the United States
 

8147
02:50:18,060 --> 02:50:20,929
um would uh people in the United States
Congress for example demand reparations

8148
02:50:20,929 --> 02:50:20,939
Congress for example demand reparations
 

8149
02:50:20,939 --> 02:50:23,330
Congress for example demand reparations
from China so we've had four and a half

8150
02:50:23,330 --> 02:50:23,340
from China so we've had four and a half
 

8151
02:50:23,340 --> 02:50:26,690
from China so we've had four and a half
a trillion dollars of stimulus all of

8152
02:50:26,690 --> 02:50:26,700
a trillion dollars of stimulus all of
 

8153
02:50:26,700 --> 02:50:29,330
a trillion dollars of stimulus all of
the economic losses and we owe a lot of

8154
02:50:29,330 --> 02:50:29,340
the economic losses and we owe a lot of
 

8155
02:50:29,340 --> 02:50:33,530
the economic losses and we owe a lot of
money to China from our our debt I'm

8156
02:50:33,530 --> 02:50:33,540
money to China from our our debt I'm
 

8157
02:50:33,540 --> 02:50:35,510
money to China from our our debt I'm
quite certain that members of Congress

8158
02:50:35,510 --> 02:50:35,520
quite certain that members of Congress
 

8159
02:50:35,520 --> 02:50:37,070
quite certain that members of Congress
would say you know we're just going to

8160
02:50:37,070 --> 02:50:37,080
would say you know we're just going to
 

8161
02:50:37,080 --> 02:50:38,630
would say you know we're just going to
wipe that out it would destroy the

8162
02:50:38,630 --> 02:50:38,640
wipe that out it would destroy the
 

8163
02:50:38,640 --> 02:50:40,550
wipe that out it would destroy the
Global Financial system but I think they

8164
02:50:40,550 --> 02:50:40,560
Global Financial system but I think they
 

8165
02:50:40,560 --> 02:50:42,830
Global Financial system but I think they
would be extremely likely would other

8166
02:50:42,830 --> 02:50:42,840
would be extremely likely would other
 

8167
02:50:42,840 --> 02:50:45,370
would be extremely likely would other
countries like India that have lost

8168
02:50:45,370 --> 02:50:45,380
countries like India that have lost
 

8169
02:50:45,380 --> 02:50:48,410
countries like India that have lost
millions of uh of people and had

8170
02:50:48,410 --> 02:50:48,420
millions of uh of people and had
 

8171
02:50:48,420 --> 02:50:51,530
millions of uh of people and had
terrible economic damages would they

8172
02:50:51,530 --> 02:50:51,540
terrible economic damages would they
 

8173
02:50:51,540 --> 02:50:54,650
terrible economic damages would they
demand reparations so I I think from a

8174
02:50:54,650 --> 02:50:54,660
demand reparations so I I think from a
 

8175
02:50:54,660 --> 02:50:57,650
demand reparations so I I think from a
Chinese perspective starting from now it

8176
02:50:57,650 --> 02:50:57,660
Chinese perspective starting from now it
 

8177
02:50:57,660 --> 02:50:59,630
Chinese perspective starting from now it
would have major geopolitical

8178
02:50:59,630 --> 02:50:59,640
would have major geopolitical
 

8179
02:50:59,640 --> 02:51:02,030
would have major geopolitical
implications and and go back to to

8180
02:51:02,030 --> 02:51:02,040
implications and and go back to to
 

8181
02:51:02,040 --> 02:51:04,790
implications and and go back to to
Chernobyl like there was a reason why

8182
02:51:04,790 --> 02:51:04,800
Chernobyl like there was a reason why
 

8183
02:51:04,800 --> 02:51:07,010
Chernobyl like there was a reason why
the Soviet Union went to such length to

8184
02:51:07,010 --> 02:51:07,020
the Soviet Union went to such length to
 

8185
02:51:07,020 --> 02:51:10,130
the Soviet Union went to such length to
cover things up and when it came out I

8186
02:51:10,130 --> 02:51:10,140
cover things up and when it came out I
 

8187
02:51:10,140 --> 02:51:11,929
cover things up and when it came out I
mean there are different theories but

8188
02:51:11,929 --> 02:51:11,939
mean there are different theories but
 

8189
02:51:11,939 --> 02:51:15,710
mean there are different theories but
certainly uh Chernobyl played some role

8190
02:51:15,710 --> 02:51:15,720
certainly uh Chernobyl played some role
 

8191
02:51:15,720 --> 02:51:20,870
certainly uh Chernobyl played some role
in the end of communist power in in the

8192
02:51:20,870 --> 02:51:20,880
in the end of communist power in in the
 

8193
02:51:20,880 --> 02:51:23,630
in the end of communist power in in the
Soviet Union so the the Chinese are very

8194
02:51:23,630 --> 02:51:23,640
Soviet Union so the the Chinese are very
 

8195
02:51:23,640 --> 02:51:26,090
Soviet Union so the the Chinese are very
very aware of that but but the

8196
02:51:26,090 --> 02:51:26,100
very aware of that but but the
 

8197
02:51:26,100 --> 02:51:27,650
very aware of that but but the
difference of course with Chernobyl the

8198
02:51:27,650 --> 02:51:27,660
difference of course with Chernobyl the
 

8199
02:51:27,660 --> 02:51:29,150
difference of course with Chernobyl the
damage to the rest of the world was not

8200
02:51:29,150 --> 02:51:29,160
damage to the rest of the world was not
 

8201
02:51:29,160 --> 02:51:31,070
damage to the rest of the world was not
a nearly as significant exactly with

8202
02:51:31,070 --> 02:51:31,080
a nearly as significant exactly with
 

8203
02:51:31,080 --> 02:51:33,950
a nearly as significant exactly with
covid so you you say that the cover-up

8204
02:51:33,950 --> 02:51:33,960
covid so you you say that the cover-up
 

8205
02:51:33,960 --> 02:51:35,929
covid so you you say that the cover-up
is a crime but

8206
02:51:35,929 --> 02:51:35,939
is a crime but
 

8207
02:51:35,939 --> 02:51:38,150
is a crime but
everything you just described the

8208
02:51:38,150 --> 02:51:38,160
everything you just described the
 

8209
02:51:38,160 --> 02:51:40,610
everything you just described the
response of the rest of the world

8210
02:51:40,610 --> 02:51:40,620
response of the rest of the world
 

8211
02:51:40,620 --> 02:51:42,349
response of the rest of the world
is uh

8212
02:51:42,349 --> 02:51:42,359
is uh
 

8213
02:51:42,359 --> 02:51:44,809
is uh
I could say unfair

8214
02:51:44,809 --> 02:51:44,819
I could say unfair
 

8215
02:51:44,819 --> 02:51:48,530
I could say unfair
if it's a so okay if we say the best

8216
02:51:48,530 --> 02:51:48,540
if it's a so okay if we say the best
 

8217
02:51:48,540 --> 02:51:51,710
if it's a so okay if we say the best
possible version of the story you know

8218
02:51:51,710 --> 02:51:51,720
possible version of the story you know
 

8219
02:51:51,720 --> 02:51:55,130
possible version of the story you know
lab leaks happen they shouldn't happen

8220
02:51:55,130 --> 02:51:55,140
lab leaks happen they shouldn't happen
 

8221
02:51:55,140 --> 02:51:58,849
lab leaks happen they shouldn't happen
right but they they happen and how is

8222
02:51:58,849 --> 02:51:58,859
right but they they happen and how is
 

8223
02:51:58,859 --> 02:52:02,150
right but they they happen and how is
that on the Chinese government

8224
02:52:02,150 --> 02:52:02,160
that on the Chinese government
 

8225
02:52:02,160 --> 02:52:04,490
that on the Chinese government
I mean what was a good example well the

8226
02:52:04,490 --> 02:52:04,500
I mean what was a good example well the
 

8227
02:52:04,500 --> 02:52:06,590
I mean what was a good example well the
Union Carbide Union Carbide there was

8228
02:52:06,590 --> 02:52:06,600
Union Carbide Union Carbide there was
 

8229
02:52:06,600 --> 02:52:08,570
Union Carbide Union Carbide there was
this American company operating in India

8230
02:52:08,570 --> 02:52:08,580
this American company operating in India
 

8231
02:52:08,580 --> 02:52:11,570
this American company operating in India
they had this Lake all these people were

8232
02:52:11,570 --> 02:52:11,580
they had this Lake all these people were
 

8233
02:52:11,580 --> 02:52:14,389
they had this Lake all these people were
were killed the company admitted

8234
02:52:14,389 --> 02:52:14,399
were killed the company admitted
 

8235
02:52:14,399 --> 02:52:16,610
were killed the company admitted
responsibility I was working in in the

8236
02:52:16,610 --> 02:52:16,620
responsibility I was working in in the
 

8237
02:52:16,620 --> 02:52:18,410
responsibility I was working in in the
white house when the United States

8238
02:52:18,410 --> 02:52:18,420
white house when the United States
 

8239
02:52:18,420 --> 02:52:20,690
white house when the United States
government in my view which I know to be

8240
02:52:20,690 --> 02:52:20,700
government in my view which I know to be
 

8241
02:52:20,700 --> 02:52:22,490
government in my view which I know to be
the case but other people in China think

8242
02:52:22,490 --> 02:52:22,500
the case but other people in China think
 

8243
02:52:22,500 --> 02:52:24,889
the case but other people in China think
differently a bombed the Chinese Embassy

8244
02:52:24,889 --> 02:52:24,899
differently a bombed the Chinese Embassy
 

8245
02:52:24,899 --> 02:52:27,050
differently a bombed the Chinese Embassy
in Belgrade and so the United States

8246
02:52:27,050 --> 02:52:27,060
in Belgrade and so the United States
 

8247
02:52:27,060 --> 02:52:29,450
in Belgrade and so the United States
government allowed a full investigation

8248
02:52:29,450 --> 02:52:29,460
government allowed a full investigation
 

8249
02:52:29,460 --> 02:52:32,290
government allowed a full investigation
then we paid reparations to the family

8250
02:52:32,290 --> 02:52:32,300
then we paid reparations to the family
 

8251
02:52:32,300 --> 02:52:36,290
then we paid reparations to the family
the families and so to your question if

8252
02:52:36,290 --> 02:52:36,300
the families and so to your question if
 

8253
02:52:36,300 --> 02:52:39,349
the families and so to your question if
I were let's just say I were the Chinese

8254
02:52:39,349 --> 02:52:39,359
I were let's just say I were the Chinese
 

8255
02:52:39,359 --> 02:52:41,090
I were let's just say I were the Chinese
government not I mean in kind of an

8256
02:52:41,090 --> 02:52:41,100
government not I mean in kind of an
 

8257
02:52:41,100 --> 02:52:42,590
government not I mean in kind of an
idealized version of the Chinese

8258
02:52:42,590 --> 02:52:42,600
idealized version of the Chinese
 

8259
02:52:42,600 --> 02:52:43,550
idealized version of the Chinese
government

8260
02:52:43,550 --> 02:52:43,560
government
 

8261
02:52:43,560 --> 02:52:46,550
government
and let's just say that they had come to

8262
02:52:46,550 --> 02:52:46,560
and let's just say that they had come to
 

8263
02:52:46,560 --> 02:52:47,990
and let's just say that they had come to
the conclusion that it was a lab

8264
02:52:47,990 --> 02:52:48,000
the conclusion that it was a lab
 

8265
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:50,990
the conclusion that it was a lab
incident and let's just say they knew

8266
02:52:50,990 --> 02:52:51,000
incident and let's just say they knew
 

8267
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:54,469
incident and let's just say they knew
that even if they continued to cover it

8268
02:52:54,469 --> 02:52:54,479
that even if they continued to cover it
 

8269
02:52:54,479 --> 02:52:57,769
that even if they continued to cover it
up eventually this information would

8270
02:52:57,769 --> 02:52:57,779
up eventually this information would
 

8271
02:52:57,779 --> 02:52:59,570
up eventually this information would
would come out I mean maybe there was a

8272
02:52:59,570 --> 02:52:59,580
would come out I mean maybe there was a
 

8273
02:52:59,580 --> 02:53:01,490
would come out I mean maybe there was a
whistleblower maybe they knew of some

8274
02:53:01,490 --> 02:53:01,500
whistleblower maybe they knew of some
 

8275
02:53:01,500 --> 02:53:04,490
whistleblower maybe they knew of some
evidence that we didn't know about or

8276
02:53:04,490 --> 02:53:04,500
evidence that we didn't know about or
 

8277
02:53:04,500 --> 02:53:07,130
evidence that we didn't know about or
something what would I do starting right

8278
02:53:07,130 --> 02:53:07,140
something what would I do starting right
 

8279
02:53:07,140 --> 02:53:08,750
something what would I do starting right
now

8280
02:53:08,750 --> 02:53:08,760
now
 

8281
02:53:08,760 --> 02:53:10,910
now
um what I would do is I would

8282
02:53:10,910 --> 02:53:10,920
um what I would do is I would
 

8283
02:53:10,920 --> 02:53:13,250
um what I would do is I would
um hold a press conference and and we

8284
02:53:13,250 --> 02:53:13,260
um hold a press conference and and we
 

8285
02:53:13,260 --> 02:53:15,650
um hold a press conference and and we
would say and I would say we had this

8286
02:53:15,650 --> 02:53:15,660
would say and I would say we had this
 

8287
02:53:15,660 --> 02:53:18,290
would say and I would say we had this
terrible accident the reason why we were

8288
02:53:18,290 --> 02:53:18,300
terrible accident the reason why we were
 

8289
02:53:18,300 --> 02:53:20,510
terrible accident the reason why we were
doing this research in Wuhan and

8290
02:53:20,510 --> 02:53:20,520
doing this research in Wuhan and
 

8291
02:53:20,520 --> 02:53:23,690
doing this research in Wuhan and
elsewhere is that we had SARS one and we

8292
02:53:23,690 --> 02:53:23,700
elsewhere is that we had SARS one and we
 

8293
02:53:23,700 --> 02:53:25,490
elsewhere is that we had SARS one and we
felt a responsibility to do everything

8294
02:53:25,490 --> 02:53:25,500
felt a responsibility to do everything
 

8295
02:53:25,500 --> 02:53:28,309
felt a responsibility to do everything
possible to prevent now that kind of

8296
02:53:28,309 --> 02:53:28,319
possible to prevent now that kind of
 

8297
02:53:28,319 --> 02:53:29,870
possible to prevent now that kind of
terrible thing happening again for our

8298
02:53:29,870 --> 02:53:29,880
terrible thing happening again for our
 

8299
02:53:29,880 --> 02:53:32,450
terrible thing happening again for our
country and for the world that was why

8300
02:53:32,450 --> 02:53:32,460
country and for the world that was why
 

8301

8337
02:54:15,060 --> 02:54:17,330
we've Dig Dug deeper we have recognized
because we have access to additional

because we have access to additional
 

8339
02:54:17,340 --> 02:54:18,969
because we have access to additional
information that we didn't have then

02:54:18,969 --> 02:54:18,979
information that we didn't have then
 

8341
02:54:18,979 --> 02:54:22,010
information that we didn't have then
that this pandemic started from an

8342

that this pandemic started from an
 

8343
02:54:22,020 --> 02:54:24,230
that this pandemic started from an
accidental lab incident and we feel

accidental lab incident and we feel
 

8345
02:54:24,240 --> 02:54:26,450
accidental lab incident and we feel
really terribly about that and we know

8346

really terribly about that and we know
 

8347
02:54:26,460 --> 02:54:29,269
really terribly about that and we know
that we were very aggressive in covering

so I would uh say not 5 trillion but

8460
02:57:02,030 --> 02:57:02,040
so I would uh say not 5 trillion but
 

8461
02:57:02,040 --> 02:57:04,190
so I would uh say not 5 trillion but
some large amount and I would really

8462
02:57:04,190 --> 02:57:04,200
some large amount and I would really
 

8463
02:57:04,200 --> 02:57:05,809
some large amount and I would really
focus on the future it was just every

8464
02:57:05,809 --> 02:57:05,819
focus on the future it was just every
 

8465
02:57:05,819 --> 02:57:08,990
focus on the future it was just every
time we talk about the lab League

8466
02:57:08,990 --> 02:57:09,000
time we talk about the lab League
 

8467
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:11,690
time we talk about the lab League
the unfortunate thing is I feel like

8468
02:57:11,690 --> 02:57:11,700
the unfortunate thing is I feel like
 

8469
02:57:11,700 --> 02:57:13,130
the unfortunate thing is I feel like
people don't focus enough about the

8470
02:57:13,130 --> 02:57:13,140
people don't focus enough about the
 

8471
02:57:13,140 --> 02:57:15,670
people don't focus enough about the
future to me the lab leak is important

8472
02:57:15,670 --> 02:57:15,680
future to me the lab leak is important
 

8473
02:57:15,680 --> 02:57:18,889
future to me the lab leak is important
because we want to construct the kind of

8474
02:57:18,889 --> 02:57:18,899
because we want to construct the kind of
 

8475
02:57:18,899 --> 02:57:22,849
because we want to construct the kind of
uh framework of thinking and a global

8476
02:57:22,849 --> 02:57:22,859
uh framework of thinking and a global
 

8477
02:57:22,859 --> 02:57:26,570
uh framework of thinking and a global
conversation that minimizes uh the

8478
02:57:26,570 --> 02:57:26,580
conversation that minimizes uh the
 

8479
02:57:26,580 --> 02:57:28,790
conversation that minimizes uh the
Damage Done by Future lab leaks which

8480
02:57:28,790 --> 02:57:28,800
Damage Done by Future lab leaks which
 

8481
02:57:28,800 --> 02:57:31,849
Damage Done by Future lab leaks which
will almost certainly happen and so to

8482
02:57:31,849 --> 02:57:31,859
will almost certainly happen and so to
 

8483
02:57:31,859 --> 02:57:34,490
will almost certainly happen and so to
me though any lab league is about the

8484
02:57:34,490 --> 02:57:34,500
me though any lab league is about the
 

8485
02:57:34,500 --> 02:57:35,690
me though any lab league is about the
future

8486
02:57:35,690 --> 02:57:35,700
future
 

8487
02:57:35,700 --> 02:57:39,469
future
I would launch a giant investment in

8488
02:57:39,469 --> 02:57:39,479
I would launch a giant investment in
 

8489
02:57:39,479 --> 02:57:42,950
I would launch a giant investment in
saying we're going to create the testing

8490
02:57:42,950 --> 02:57:42,960
saying we're going to create the testing
 

8491
02:57:42,960 --> 02:57:44,929
saying we're going to create the testing
infrastructure like all of this kind of

8492
02:57:44,929 --> 02:57:44,939
infrastructure like all of this kind of
 

8493
02:57:44,939 --> 02:57:47,269
infrastructure like all of this kind of
infrastructure Investments that help

8494
02:57:47,269 --> 02:57:47,279
infrastructure Investments that help
 

8495
02:57:47,279 --> 02:57:49,969
infrastructure Investments that help
minimize the damage of a lab leak here

8496
02:57:49,969 --> 02:57:49,979
minimize the damage of a lab leak here
 

8497
02:57:49,979 --> 02:57:52,070
minimize the damage of a lab leak here
in the rest of the world so the

8498
02:57:52,070 --> 02:57:52,080
in the rest of the world so the
 

8499
02:57:52,080 --> 02:57:55,190
in the rest of the world so the
challenge with that is one it's hard to

8500
02:57:55,190 --> 02:57:55,200
challenge with that is one it's hard to
 

8501
02:57:55,200 --> 02:57:57,710
challenge with that is one it's hard to
imagine a fully in accountable future

8502
02:57:57,710 --> 02:57:57,720
imagine a fully in accountable future
 

8503
02:57:57,720 --> 02:57:59,809
imagine a fully in accountable future
system to prevent these kinds of

8504
02:57:59,809 --> 02:57:59,819
system to prevent these kinds of
 

8505
02:57:59,819 --> 02:58:01,790
system to prevent these kinds of
terrible pandemics

8506
02:58:01,790 --> 02:58:01,800
terrible pandemics
 

8507
02:58:01,800 --> 02:58:05,150
terrible pandemics
that's built upon obfuscation and

8508
02:58:05,150 --> 02:58:05,160
that's built upon obfuscation and
 

8509
02:58:05,160 --> 02:58:07,790
that's built upon obfuscation and
cover-up regarding the origins of this

8510
02:58:07,790 --> 02:58:07,800
cover-up regarding the origins of this
 

8511
02:58:07,800 --> 02:58:10,130
cover-up regarding the origins of this
worst pandemic in a century so it's just

8512
02:58:10,130 --> 02:58:10,140
worst pandemic in a century so it's just
 

8513
02:58:10,140 --> 02:58:13,490
worst pandemic in a century so it's just
like that that Foundation isn't strong

8514
02:58:13,490 --> 02:58:13,500
like that that Foundation isn't strong
 

8515
02:58:13,500 --> 02:58:14,269
like that that Foundation isn't strong
enough

8516
02:58:14,269 --> 02:58:14,279
enough
 

8517
02:58:14,279 --> 02:58:15,590
enough
second

8518
02:58:15,590 --> 02:58:15,600
second
 

8519
02:58:15,600 --> 02:58:18,110
second
um China across the fields of science is

8520
02:58:18,110 --> 02:58:18,120
um China across the fields of science is
 

8521
02:58:18,120 --> 02:58:20,450
um China across the fields of science is
looking to LeapFrog the rest of the

8522
02:58:20,450 --> 02:58:20,460
looking to LeapFrog the rest of the
 

8523
02:58:20,460 --> 02:58:23,330
looking to LeapFrog the rest of the
world so China has current plans to

8524
02:58:23,330 --> 02:58:23,340
world so China has current plans to
 

8525
02:58:23,340 --> 02:58:26,690
world so China has current plans to
build BSL for labs in every of its

8526
02:58:26,690 --> 02:58:26,700
build BSL for labs in every of its
 

8527
02:58:26,700 --> 02:58:28,550
build BSL for labs in every of its
Province yeah they're scaling up they're

8528
02:58:28,550 --> 02:58:28,560
Province yeah they're scaling up they're
 

8529
02:58:28,560 --> 02:58:31,550
Province yeah they're scaling up they're
scaling up everything and with the plan

8530
02:58:31,550 --> 02:58:31,560
scaling up everything and with the plan
 

8531
02:58:31,560 --> 02:58:33,410
scaling up everything and with the plan
on leading and that's why again I was

8532
02:58:33,410 --> 02:58:33,420
on leading and that's why again I was
 

8533
02:58:33,420 --> 02:58:34,730
on leading and that's why again I was
saying before I think there's a lot of

8534
02:58:34,730 --> 02:58:34,740
saying before I think there's a lot of
 

8535
02:58:34,740 --> 02:58:37,130
saying before I think there's a lot of
similarity between this story at least

8536
02:58:37,130 --> 02:58:37,140
similarity between this story at least
 

8537
02:58:37,140 --> 02:58:39,290
similarity between this story at least
as I see it at least the most probable

8538
02:58:39,290 --> 02:58:39,300
as I see it at least the most probable
 

8539
02:58:39,300 --> 02:58:41,870
as I see it at least the most probable
case and these other areas where China

8540
02:58:41,870 --> 02:58:41,880
case and these other areas where China
 

8541
02:58:41,880 --> 02:58:43,670
case and these other areas where China
gets knowledge and then tries to

8542
02:58:43,670 --> 02:58:43,680
gets knowledge and then tries to
 

8543
02:58:43,680 --> 02:58:46,670
gets knowledge and then tries to
LeapFrog it's the same with with AI and

8544
02:58:46,670 --> 02:58:46,680
LeapFrog it's the same with with AI and
 

8545
02:58:46,680 --> 02:58:49,010
LeapFrog it's the same with with AI and
autonomous Killer Robots it's the same

8546
02:58:49,010 --> 02:58:49,020
autonomous Killer Robots it's the same
 

8547
02:58:49,020 --> 02:58:50,870
autonomous Killer Robots it's the same
with human genome editing with animal

8548
02:58:50,870 --> 02:58:50,880
with human genome editing with animal
 

8549
02:58:50,880 --> 02:58:53,330
with human genome editing with animal
experimentations with so many basically

8550
02:58:53,330 --> 02:58:53,340
experimentations with so many basically
 

8551
02:58:53,340 --> 02:58:57,950
experimentations with so many basically
all areas of advanced science

8552
02:58:57,950 --> 02:58:57,960
all areas of advanced science
 

8553
02:58:57,960 --> 02:59:00,290
all areas of advanced science
um so the the question is would China

8554
02:59:00,290 --> 02:59:00,300
um so the the question is would China
 

8555
02:59:00,300 --> 02:59:03,830
um so the the question is would China
stop in that process and then third

8556
02:59:03,830 --> 02:59:03,840
stop in that process and then third
 

8557
02:59:03,840 --> 02:59:05,990
stop in that process and then third
um and there's it's a little bit of a

8558
02:59:05,990 --> 02:59:06,000
um and there's it's a little bit of a
 

8559
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:08,650
um and there's it's a little bit of a
historical background but

8560
02:59:08,650 --> 02:59:08,660
historical background but
 

8561
02:59:08,660 --> 02:59:11,210
historical background but
defending national sovereignty is one of

8562
02:59:11,210 --> 02:59:11,220
defending national sovereignty is one of
 

8563
02:59:11,220 --> 02:59:14,150
defending national sovereignty is one of
the core principles of certainly of the

8564
02:59:14,150 --> 02:59:14,160
the core principles of certainly of the
 

8565
02:59:14,160 --> 02:59:16,670
the core principles of certainly of the
then of the Chinese State and the

8566
02:59:16,670 --> 02:59:16,680
then of the Chinese State and the
 

8567
02:59:16,680 --> 02:59:19,490
then of the Chinese State and the
historical issue is for those of us who

8568
02:59:19,490 --> 02:59:19,500
historical issue is for those of us who
 

8569
02:59:19,500 --> 02:59:21,950
historical issue is for those of us who
come from the West I mean one of the

8570
02:59:21,950 --> 02:59:21,960
come from the West I mean one of the
 

8571
02:59:21,960 --> 02:59:24,469
come from the West I mean one of the
lessons of the post-war planners was

8572
02:59:24,469 --> 02:59:24,479
lessons of the post-war planners was
 

8573
02:59:24,479 --> 02:59:27,349
lessons of the post-war planners was
that absolute National sovereignty was

8574
02:59:27,349 --> 02:59:27,359
that absolute National sovereignty was
 

8575
02:59:27,359 --> 02:59:30,349
that absolute National sovereignty was
actually a major feeder into the first

8576
02:59:30,349 --> 02:59:30,359
actually a major feeder into the first
 

8577
02:59:30,359 --> 02:59:32,090
actually a major feeder into the first
and second world wars that we had all

8578
02:59:32,090 --> 02:59:32,100
and second world wars that we had all
 

8579
02:59:32,100 --> 02:59:35,150
and second world wars that we had all
these conflicting States and therefore

8580
02:59:35,150 --> 02:59:35,160
these conflicting States and therefore
 

8581
02:59:35,160 --> 02:59:37,790
these conflicting States and therefore
the logic of the post-war system is we

8582
02:59:37,790 --> 02:59:37,800
the logic of the post-war system is we
 

8583
02:59:37,800 --> 02:59:39,590
the logic of the post-war system is we
need to in some ways pool sovereignty

8584
02:59:39,590 --> 02:59:39,600
need to in some ways pool sovereignty
 

8585
02:59:39,600 --> 02:59:42,349
need to in some ways pool sovereignty
that's like the uh the EU and have

8586
02:59:42,349 --> 02:59:42,359
that's like the uh the EU and have
 

8587
02:59:42,359 --> 02:59:45,170
that's like the uh the EU and have
transnational organizations like the UN

8588
02:59:45,170 --> 02:59:45,180
transnational organizations like the UN
 

8589
02:59:45,180 --> 02:59:46,849
transnational organizations like the UN
organizations and the Britain Woods

8590
02:59:46,849 --> 02:59:46,859
organizations and the Britain Woods
 

8591
02:59:46,859 --> 02:59:49,730
organizations and the Britain Woods
organizations for most Asian States and

8592
02:59:49,730 --> 02:59:49,740
organizations for most Asian States and
 

8593
02:59:49,740 --> 02:59:52,250
organizations for most Asian States and
and also even for some African the

8594
02:59:52,250 --> 02:59:52,260
and also even for some African the
 

8595
02:59:52,260 --> 02:59:54,170
and also even for some African the
people who are kind of on the colonized

8596
02:59:54,170 --> 02:59:54,180
people who are kind of on the colonized
 

8597
02:59:54,180 --> 02:59:56,929
people who are kind of on the colonized
side of History sovereignty was the

8598
02:59:56,929 --> 02:59:56,939
side of History sovereignty was the
 

8599
02:59:56,939 --> 02:59:59,450
side of History sovereignty was the
thing that was denied them that was the

8600
02:59:59,450 --> 02:59:59,460
thing that was denied them that was the
 

8601
02:59:59,460 --> 03:00:00,889
thing that was denied them that was the
thing that they want the European power

8602
03:00:00,889 --> 03:00:00,899
thing that they want the European power
 

8603
03:00:00,899 --> 03:00:04,190
thing that they want the European power
is denied and so the idea of giving up

8604
03:00:04,190 --> 03:00:04,200
is denied and so the idea of giving up
 

8605
03:00:04,200 --> 03:00:06,530
is denied and so the idea of giving up
sovereignty was that the absolute

8606
03:00:06,530 --> 03:00:06,540
sovereignty was that the absolute
 

8607
03:00:06,540 --> 03:00:10,429
sovereignty was that the absolute
opposite and so that's why China is and

8608
03:00:10,429 --> 03:00:10,439
opposite and so that's why China is and
 

8609
03:00:10,439 --> 03:00:12,410
opposite and so that's why China is and
again I mentioned this Rush Doshi book

8610
03:00:12,410 --> 03:00:12,420
again I mentioned this Rush Doshi book
 

8611
03:00:12,420 --> 03:00:14,090
again I mentioned this Rush Doshi book
it's not that China is trying to destroy

8612
03:00:14,090 --> 03:00:14,100
it's not that China is trying to destroy
 

8613
03:00:14,100 --> 03:00:16,490
it's not that China is trying to destroy
strengthen this rules-based

8614
03:00:16,490 --> 03:00:16,500
strengthen this rules-based
 

8615
03:00:16,500 --> 03:00:18,110
strengthen this rules-based
International order which is based on

8616
03:00:18,110 --> 03:00:18,120
International order which is based on
 

8617
03:00:18,120 --> 03:00:19,849
International order which is based on

going to do their thing anyway but I but
 

8791
03:04:07,380 --> 03:04:09,889
going to do their thing anyway but I but
I I think that's our system and that was

8792
03:04:09,889 --> 03:04:09,899
I I think that's our system and that was
 

8793
03:04:09,899 --> 03:04:12,610
I I think that's our system and that was
the genius of the the founding fathers

8794
03:04:12,610 --> 03:04:12,620
the genius of the the founding fathers
 

8795
03:04:12,620 --> 03:04:16,010
the genius of the the founding fathers
that the government probably is going to

8796
03:04:16,010 --> 03:04:16,020
that the government probably is going to
 

8797
03:04:16,020 --> 03:04:17,870
that the government probably is going to
have a lot of instincts to do the wrong

have a lot of instincts to do the wrong
 

8799
03:04:17,880 --> 03:04:20,210
have a lot of instincts to do the wrong
thing that was the experience in in our

8800
03:04:20,210 --> 03:04:20,220
thing that was the experience in in our
 

8801
03:04:20,220 --> 03:04:23,630
thing that was the experience in in our
in in England before and so that's why

8802
03:04:23,630 --> 03:04:23,640
in in England before and so that's why
 

8803
03:04:23,640 --> 03:04:26,570
in in England before and so that's why
we have free speech to hold the

8804
03:04:26,570 --> 03:04:26,580
we have free speech to hold the
 

8805
03:04:26,580 --> 03:04:28,670

government if the government just like

8820
03:04:44,929 --> 03:04:44,939
government if the government just like
 

8821
03:04:44,939 --> 03:04:46,910
government if the government just like

want to at least have some some
 

8827
03:04:50,160 --> 03:04:52,670
want to at least have some some
Authority so that's our system is to

8828
03:04:52,670 --> 03:04:52,680
Authority so that's our system is to
 

8829
03:04:52,680 --> 03:04:54,530
Authority so that's our system is to
have that kind of voice and that that is

8830
03:04:54,530 --> 03:04:54,540
have that kind of voice and that that is
 

8831
03:04:54,540 --> 03:04:57,530
have that kind of voice and that that is
the public voice actually balances

8832
03:04:57,530 --> 03:04:57,540
the public voice actually balances
 

8833
03:04:57,540 --> 03:04:58,910
the public voice actually balances
because every government as you

8834
03:04:58,910 --> 03:04:58,920
because every government as you
 

8835
03:04:58,920 --> 03:05:01,550
because every government as you
correctly said every government has the

8836
03:05:01,550 --> 03:05:01,560
correctly said every government has the
 

8837
03:05:01,560 --> 03:05:04,670
correctly said every government has the
same instincts and and that's why we

8838
03:05:04,670 --> 03:05:04,680
same instincts and and that's why we
 

8839
03:05:04,680 --> 03:05:06,710
same instincts and and that's why we
have and it's it's imperfect here but

8840
03:05:06,710 --> 03:05:06,720
have and it's it's imperfect here but
 

8841
03:05:06,720 --> 03:05:08,330
have and it's it's imperfect here but
kind of these ideas of separation of

8842
03:05:08,330 --> 03:05:08,340
kind of these ideas of separation of
 

8843
03:05:08,340 --> 03:05:10,849
kind of these ideas of separation of
powers of inalienable rights so that we

8844
03:05:10,849 --> 03:05:10,859
powers of inalienable rights so that we
 

8845
03:05:10,859 --> 03:05:12,889
powers of inalienable rights so that we
can have it's almost like a vast Market

8846
03:05:12,889 --> 03:05:12,899
can have it's almost like a vast Market
 

8847
03:05:12,899 --> 03:05:15,349
can have it's almost like a vast Market
where we can have balance so you think

8848
03:05:15,349 --> 03:05:15,359
where we can have balance so you think
 

8849
03:05:15,359 --> 03:05:17,030
where we can have balance so you think

hearings and they're trying to box Us in

8930
03:06:52,490 --> 03:06:52,500
hearings and they're trying to box Us in
 

8931
03:06:52,500 --> 03:06:55,370
hearings and they're trying to box Us in
and whatever but that's our process and

8932
03:06:55,370 --> 03:06:55,380
and whatever but that's our process and
 

8933
03:06:55,380 --> 03:06:57,410
and whatever but that's our process and
it there's like a form of accountability

8934
03:06:57,410 --> 03:06:57,420
it there's like a form of accountability
 

8935
03:06:57,420 --> 03:07:01,190
it there's like a form of accountability
as chaotic as crazy as as it is and so

8936
03:07:01,190 --> 03:07:01,200
as chaotic as crazy as as it is and so
 

8937
03:07:01,200 --> 03:07:03,769
as chaotic as crazy as as it is and so
it makes it really difficult I mean we

8938
03:07:03,769 --> 03:07:03,779
it makes it really difficult I mean we
 

8939
03:07:03,779 --> 03:07:05,929
it makes it really difficult I mean we
have other problems of just chaos and

8940
03:07:05,929 --> 03:07:05,939
have other problems of just chaos and
 

8941
03:07:05,939 --> 03:07:07,969
have other problems of just chaos and
everybody doing their own thing but it

8942
03:07:07,969 --> 03:07:07,979
everybody doing their own thing but it
 

8943
03:07:07,979 --> 03:07:10,849
everybody doing their own thing but it
makes it difficult to have the kind of

8944
03:07:10,849 --> 03:07:10,859
makes it difficult to have the kind of
 

8945
03:07:10,859 --> 03:07:12,590
makes it difficult to have the kind of
systematic cover-up and again

8946
03:07:12,590 --> 03:07:12,600
systematic cover-up and again
 

8947
03:07:12,600 --> 03:07:14,630
systematic cover-up and again
all of that is predicated on my

8948
03:07:14,630 --> 03:07:14,640
all of that is predicated on my
 

8949
03:07:14,640 --> 03:07:17,809
all of that is predicated on my
hypothesis not fully proven although I

8950
03:07:17,809 --> 03:07:17,819
hypothesis not fully proven although I
 

8951
03:07:17,819 --> 03:07:20,750
hypothesis not fully proven although I
think likely that this is a lab incident

8952
03:07:20,750 --> 03:07:20,760
think likely that this is a lab incident
 

8953
03:07:20,760 --> 03:07:24,230
think likely that this is a lab incident
origin of this of this pandemic well I

8954
03:07:24,230 --> 03:07:24,240
origin of this of this pandemic well I
 

8955
03:07:24,240 --> 03:07:26,030
origin of this of this pandemic well I
mean we're having like several layers of

8956
03:07:26,030 --> 03:07:26,040
mean we're having like several layers of
 

8957
03:07:26,040 --> 03:07:28,730
mean we're having like several layers of
conversation but I think

8958
03:07:28,730 --> 03:07:28,740
conversation but I think
 

8959
03:07:28,740 --> 03:07:32,990
conversation but I think
whether lab leak hypothesis is true or

8960
03:07:32,990 --> 03:07:33,000
whether lab leak hypothesis is true or
 

8961
03:07:33,000 --> 03:07:33,950
whether lab leak hypothesis is true or
not

8962
03:07:33,950 --> 03:07:33,960
not
 

8963
03:07:33,960 --> 03:07:37,190
not
it does seem that the likelihood of a

8964
03:07:37,190 --> 03:07:37,200
it does seem that the likelihood of a
 

8965
03:07:37,200 --> 03:07:38,450
it does seem that the likelihood of a
cover-up

8966
03:07:38,450 --> 03:07:38,460
cover-up
 

8967
03:07:38,460 --> 03:07:41,809
cover-up
if it leaked from a lab is high well

8968
03:07:41,809 --> 03:07:41,819
if it leaked from a lab is high well
 

8969
03:07:41,819 --> 03:07:43,670
if it leaked from a lab is high well
that's the more important conversation

8970
03:07:43,670 --> 03:07:43,680
that's the more important conversation
 

8971
03:07:43,680 --> 03:07:47,630
that's the more important conversation
to be having uh well you could argue a

8972
03:07:47,630 --> 03:07:47,640
to be having uh well you could argue a
 

8973
03:07:47,640 --> 03:07:50,389
to be having uh well you could argue a
lot of things but to me arguably that's

8974
03:07:50,389 --> 03:07:50,399
lot of things but to me arguably that's
 

8975
03:07:50,399 --> 03:07:51,950
lot of things but to me arguably that's
the more important conversation is about

8976
03:07:51,950 --> 03:07:51,960
the more important conversation is about
 

8977
03:07:51,960 --> 03:07:54,190
the more important conversation is about
what is the likelihood of a cover-up 100

8978
03:07:54,190 --> 03:07:54,200
what is the likelihood of a cover-up 100
 

8979
03:07:54,200 --> 03:07:58,309
what is the likelihood of a cover-up 100
like in my mind there is a legitimate

8980
03:07:58,309 --> 03:07:58,319
like in my mind there is a legitimate
 

8981
03:07:58,319 --> 03:08:01,610
like in my mind there is a legitimate
debate about the origins of the pandemic

8982
03:08:01,610 --> 03:08:01,620
debate about the origins of the pandemic
 

8983
03:08:01,620 --> 03:08:04,429
debate about the origins of the pandemic
there are people who I respect who I

8984
03:08:04,429 --> 03:08:04,439
there are people who I respect who I
 

8985
03:08:04,439 --> 03:08:07,190
there are people who I respect who I
don't necessarily agree with people like

8986
03:08:07,190 --> 03:08:07,200
don't necessarily agree with people like
 

8987
03:08:07,200 --> 03:08:10,070
don't necessarily agree with people like

who's been very open-minded engaged in
in productive debate about the origin

03:08:16,190 --> 03:08:16,200
in productive debate about the origin
 

8993
03:08:16,200 --> 03:08:17,750
in productive debate about the origin
and and you know where I where I stand

8994
03:08:17,750 --> 03:08:17,760
and and you know where I where I stand
 

8995
03:08:17,760 --> 03:08:22,730
and and you know where I where I stand
there is is and can be no debate about

8996
03:08:22,730 --> 03:08:22,740
there is is and can be no debate about
 

8997
03:08:22,740 --> 03:08:24,950
there is is and can be no debate about

whether or not there has been a cover-up
 

8999

whether or not there has been a cover-up
there has been a cover-up there is in my

9000
03:08:27,110 --> 03:08:27,120
there has been a cover-up there is in my
 

9001
03:08:27,120 --> 03:08:30,230
there has been a cover-up there is in my
mind no credible argument that there

9002
03:08:30,230 --> 03:08:30,240
mind no credible argument that there
 

9003
03:08:30,240 --> 03:08:32,690
mind no credible argument that there
hasn't been a cover-up and and I mean we

9004
03:08:32,690 --> 03:08:32,700
hasn't been a cover-up and and I mean we
 

9005
03:08:32,700 --> 03:08:35,809
hasn't been a cover-up and and I mean we
can just see it in the regulations in

9006
03:08:35,809 --> 03:08:35,819
can just see it in the regulations in
 

9007
03:08:35,819 --> 03:08:38,030
can just see it in the regulations in
the lack of access there's an incredible

9022
03:08:55,370 --> 03:08:55,380
imprisoned for picking quarrels which is
 

9023
03:08:55,380 --> 03:08:58,550
imprisoned for picking quarrels which is
kind of a catch-all and now she's

9024
03:08:58,550 --> 03:08:58,560
kind of a catch-all and now she's
 

9025
03:08:58,560 --> 03:09:00,950
kind of a catch-all and now she's
engaged in a hunger strike and she's

9026
03:09:00,950 --> 03:09:00,960
engaged in a hunger strike and she's
 

9027
03:09:00,960 --> 03:09:04,389
engaged in a hunger strike and she's
near death and so there's no question

9028
03:09:04,389 --> 03:09:04,399
near death and so there's no question
 

9029
03:09:04,399 --> 03:09:06,950
near death and so there's no question
that there has been a cover-up and

9030
03:09:06,950 --> 03:09:06,960
that there has been a cover-up and
 

9031
03:09:06,960 --> 03:09:08,750
that there has been a cover-up and
there's no question in my mind that that

9032
03:09:08,750 --> 03:09:08,760
there's no question in my mind that that
 

9033
03:09:08,760 --> 03:09:11,269
there's no question in my mind that that
cover-up is responsible for a

9034
03:09:11,269 --> 03:09:11,279
cover-up is responsible for a

03:10:16,140 --> 03:10:18,190
reality what I would say is Lex Friedman
is handsome

9086
03:10:18,190 --> 03:10:18,200
is handsome
 

9087
03:10:18,200 --> 03:10:22,510
is handsome
charming he's I'm gonna open it

9088
03:10:22,510 --> 03:10:22,520
charming he's I'm gonna open it
 

9089
03:10:22,520 --> 03:10:24,590
charming he's I'm gonna open it
really a great guy I'm sorry to

9090
03:10:24,590 --> 03:10:24,600
really a great guy I'm sorry to
 

9091
03:10:24,600 --> 03:10:26,570

interrupt that I appreciate that thank
you so I was reading about this last

9094
03:10:28,610 --> 03:10:28,620
you so I was reading about this last
 

9095
03:10:28,620 --> 03:10:29,929
you so I was reading about this last
night I was going to Tweet it but then

9096
03:10:29,929 --> 03:10:29,939
night I was going to Tweet it but then
 

9097
03:10:29,939 --> 03:10:31,010
night I was going to Tweet it but then
I'm like this is going to be

9098
03:10:31,010 --> 03:10:31,020
I'm like this is going to be
 

9099
03:10:31,020 --> 03:10:35,330
I'm like this is going to be
misinterpreted but uh it it's this is

9100
03:10:35,330 --> 03:10:35,340
misinterpreted but uh it it's this is
 

9101
03:10:35,340 --> 03:10:36,950
misinterpreted but uh it it's this is
why I like podcasts because I can I

9102
03:10:36,950 --> 03:10:36,960
why I like podcasts because I can I
 

9103
03:10:36,960 --> 03:10:39,170
why I like podcasts because I can I
could I could say stuff like this

9104
03:10:39,170 --> 03:10:39,180
could I could say stuff like this
 

9105
03:10:39,180 --> 03:10:39,729
could I could say stuff like this
um

9106
03:10:39,729 --> 03:10:39,739
um
 

9107
03:10:39,739 --> 03:10:42,469
um
is kind of incredible to me

9108
03:10:42,469 --> 03:10:42,479
is kind of incredible to me
 

9109
03:10:42,479 --> 03:10:45,349
is kind of incredible to me
that the average human male

9110
03:10:45,349 --> 03:10:45,359
that the average human male
 

9111
03:10:45,359 --> 03:10:49,490
that the average human male
produces like 500 billion plus sperm

9112
03:10:49,490 --> 03:10:49,500
produces like 500 billion plus sperm
 

9113
03:10:49,500 --> 03:10:52,070
produces like 500 billion plus sperm
cells in their lifetime

9114
03:10:52,070 --> 03:10:52,080
cells in their lifetime
 

9115
03:10:52,080 --> 03:10:54,469
cells in their lifetime
like each one of those are genetically

9116
03:10:54,469 --> 03:10:54,479
like each one of those are genetically
 

9117
03:10:54,479 --> 03:10:55,390
like each one of those are genetically
unique

9118
03:10:55,390 --> 03:10:55,400
unique
 

9119
03:10:55,400 --> 03:10:56,990
unique

[Music]
 

9121
03:10:57,000 --> 03:10:59,630
[Music]
like they can produce like unique humans

9122
03:10:59,630 --> 03:10:59,640
like they can produce like unique humans
 

9123
03:10:59,640 --> 03:11:02,929
like they can produce like unique humans
each one of the 500 billion there's like

9124
03:11:02,929 --> 03:11:02,939
each one of the 500 billion there's like
 

9125
03:11:02,939 --> 03:11:04,910
each one of the 500 billion there's like
a hundred billion people who's ever

9126
03:11:04,910 --> 03:11:04,920
a hundred billion people who's ever
 

9127
03:11:04,920 --> 03:11:07,910
a hundred billion people who's ever
lived 100 maybe like 110 whatever

9128
03:11:07,910 --> 03:11:07,920
lived 100 maybe like 110 whatever
 

9129
03:11:07,920 --> 03:11:10,309
lived 100 maybe like 110 whatever
whatever the number is so it's like five

9130
03:11:10,309 --> 03:11:10,319
whatever the number is so it's like five
 

9131
03:11:10,319 --> 03:11:11,570
whatever the number is so it's like five
times the number of people who ever

9132
03:11:11,570 --> 03:11:11,580
times the number of people who ever
 

9133
03:11:11,580 --> 03:11:13,550
times the number of people who ever
lived is

9134
03:11:13,550 --> 03:11:13,560
lived is
 

9135
03:11:13,560 --> 03:11:16,670
lived is
produced by each male

9136
03:11:16,670 --> 03:11:16,680
produced by each male
 

9137
03:11:16,680 --> 03:11:19,309
produced by each male
of genetic information so those are all

9138
03:11:19,309 --> 03:11:19,319
of genetic information so those are all
 

9139
03:11:19,319 --> 03:11:20,990
of genetic information so those are all
possible trajectories of lives that

9140
03:11:20,990 --> 03:11:21,000
possible trajectories of lives that
 

9141
03:11:21,000 --> 03:11:22,969
possible trajectories of lives that
could have lived like those are all

9142
03:11:22,969 --> 03:11:22,979
could have lived like those are all
 

9143
03:11:22,979 --> 03:11:25,849
could have lived like those are all
little people that could have been and

9144
03:11:25,849 --> 03:11:25,859
little people that could have been and
 

9145
03:11:25,859 --> 03:11:29,110
little people that could have been and
like all the possible stories all the

9146
03:11:29,110 --> 03:11:29,120
like all the possible stories all the
 

9147
03:11:29,120 --> 03:11:31,550
like all the possible stories all the
Hitlers and Einsteins that could have

9148
03:11:31,550 --> 03:11:31,560
Hitlers and Einsteins that could have
 

9149
03:11:31,560 --> 03:11:33,889
Hitlers and Einsteins that could have
been created and all that I mean I I

9150
03:11:33,889 --> 03:11:33,899
been created and all that I mean I I
 

9151
03:11:33,899 --> 03:11:35,389
been created and all that I mean I I
don't know this kind of

9152
03:11:35,389 --> 03:11:35,399
don't know this kind of
 

9153
03:11:35,399 --> 03:11:38,690
don't know this kind of
you're painting this possible future and

9154
03:11:38,690 --> 03:11:38,700
you're painting this possible future and
 

9155
03:11:38,700 --> 03:11:40,670
you're painting this possible future and
we get to see only one little string of

9156
03:11:40,670 --> 03:11:40,680
we get to see only one little string of
 

9157
03:11:40,680 --> 03:11:42,769
we get to see only one little string of
that I mean that I suppose the magic of

9158
03:11:42,769 --> 03:11:42,779
that I mean that I suppose the magic of
 

9159
03:11:42,779 --> 03:11:45,710
that I mean that I suppose the magic of
that is also captured by the

9160
03:11:45,710 --> 03:11:45,720
that is also captured by the
 

9161
03:11:45,720 --> 03:11:48,170
that is also captured by the

9162
03:11:48,170 --> 03:11:48,180
uh in specific physics or having like
 

9163
03:11:48,180 --> 03:11:50,870
uh in specific physics or having like
multiple dimensions in the uh

9164
03:11:50,870 --> 03:11:50,880
multiple dimensions in the uh

the many worlds hypothesis quantum

9166
03:11:52,969 --> 03:11:52,979
the many worlds hypothesis quantum
 

9167
03:11:52,979 --> 03:11:55,670
the many worlds hypothesis quantum

9168
03:11:55,670 --> 03:11:55,680
mechanics that the the interpretation
 

9169
03:11:55,680 --> 03:11:58,729
mechanics that the the interpretation
that were basically just at every Point

9170
03:11:58,729 --> 03:11:58,739
that were basically just at every Point
 

9171
03:11:58,739 --> 03:12:00,769
that were basically just at every Point
there's an infinite

9172
03:12:00,769 --> 03:12:00,779
there's an infinite
 

9173
03:12:00,779 --> 03:12:04,309
there's an infinite
uh offspring of universes that that are

9174
03:12:04,309 --> 03:12:04,319
uh offspring of universes that that are
 

9175
03:12:04,319 --> 03:12:05,990
uh offspring of universes that that are
created but I don't know that's just

9176
03:12:05,990 --> 03:12:06,000
created but I don't know that's just
 

9177
03:12:06,000 --> 03:12:08,269
created but I don't know that's just
like a magic of um

9178
03:12:08,269 --> 03:12:08,279
like a magic of um
 

9179
03:12:08,279 --> 03:12:11,570
like a magic of um
this game of genetics that we're playing

9180
03:12:11,570 --> 03:12:11,580
this game of genetics that we're playing
 

9181
03:12:11,580 --> 03:12:16,610
this game of genetics that we're playing
and the winning sperm is not the fastest

9182
03:12:16,610 --> 03:12:16,620
and the winning sperm is not the fastest
 

9183
03:12:16,620 --> 03:12:19,070
and the winning sperm is not the fastest
the winning sperm is basically the

9184
03:12:19,070 --> 03:12:19,080
the winning sperm is basically the
 

9185
03:12:19,080 --> 03:12:21,530
the winning sperm is basically the
luckiest has the right timing so it's

9186
03:12:21,530 --> 03:12:21,540
luckiest has the right timing so it's
 

9187
03:12:21,540 --> 03:12:22,729
luckiest has the right timing so it's
not

9188
03:12:22,729 --> 03:12:22,739
not
 

9189
03:12:22,739 --> 03:12:25,990
not
um I was also gotten into this whole uh

9190
03:12:25,990 --> 03:12:26,000
um I was also gotten into this whole uh
 

9191
03:12:26,000 --> 03:12:29,150
um I was also gotten into this whole uh
I started reading papers about like

9192
03:12:29,150 --> 03:12:29,160
I started reading papers about like
 

9193
03:12:29,160 --> 03:12:31,729
I started reading papers about like
is there something to be said about who

9194
03:12:31,729 --> 03:12:31,739
is there something to be said about who
 

9195
03:12:31,739 --> 03:12:34,849
is there something to be said about who
wins the race right genetically so it's

9196
03:12:34,849 --> 03:12:34,859
wins the race right genetically so it's
 

9197
03:12:34,859 --> 03:12:36,290
wins the race right genetically so it's
fascinating because there's studies and

9198
03:12:36,290 --> 03:12:36,300
fascinating because there's studies and
 

9199
03:12:36,300 --> 03:12:38,269
fascinating because there's studies and
in animals and so on to dance to that

9200
03:12:38,269 --> 03:12:38,279
in animals and so on to dance to that
 

9201
03:12:38,279 --> 03:12:39,229
in animals and so on to dance to that
question because it's interesting

9202
03:12:39,229 --> 03:12:39,239
question because it's interesting
 

9203
03:12:39,239 --> 03:12:41,570
question because it's interesting
because like because I'm a winner right

9204
03:12:41,570 --> 03:12:41,580
because like because I'm a winner right
 

9205
03:12:41,580 --> 03:12:44,090
because like because I'm a winner right
I want I want to race yes and so you

9206
03:12:44,090 --> 03:12:44,100
I want I want to race yes and so you
 

9207
03:12:44,100 --> 03:12:45,769
I want I want to race yes and so you
want to know like what what does that

9208
03:12:45,769 --> 03:12:45,779
want to know like what what does that
 

9209
03:12:45,779 --> 03:12:48,349
want to know like what what does that
say about me in this uh

9210
03:12:48,349 --> 03:12:48,359
say about me in this uh
 

9211
03:12:48,359 --> 03:12:50,389
say about me in this uh
in this fascinating genetic race against

9212
03:12:50,389 --> 03:12:50,399
in this fascinating genetic race against
 

9213
03:12:50,399 --> 03:12:53,030
in this fascinating genetic race against
I think what is it 200 200 million

9214
03:12:53,030 --> 03:12:53,040
I think what is it 200 200 million
 

9215
03:12:53,040 --> 03:12:57,410
I think what is it 200 200 million
others I think so one uh you know pool

9216
03:12:57,410 --> 03:12:57,420
others I think so one uh you know pool
 

9217
03:12:57,420 --> 03:13:00,130
others I think so one uh you know pool
of uh sperm cells is uh is about

9218
03:13:00,130 --> 03:13:00,140
of uh sperm cells is uh is about
 

9219
03:13:00,140 --> 03:13:03,650
of uh sperm cells is uh is about
something like 200 million it could be

9220
03:13:03,650 --> 03:13:03,660
something like 200 million it could be
 

9221
03:13:03,660 --> 03:13:06,769
something like 200 million it could be
yes so but that Millions yeah I thought

9222
03:13:06,769 --> 03:13:06,779
yes so but that Millions yeah I thought
 

9223
03:13:06,779 --> 03:13:08,510
yes so but that Millions yeah I thought
it was much much lower than that so like

9224
03:13:08,510 --> 03:13:08,520
it was much much lower than that so like
 

9225
03:13:08,520 --> 03:13:09,349
it was much much lower than that so like
that

9226
03:13:09,349 --> 03:13:09,359
that
 

9227
03:13:09,359 --> 03:13:10,969
that
those are all

9228
03:13:10,969 --> 03:13:10,979
those are all
 

9229
03:13:10,979 --> 03:13:14,510
those are all
brothers and sisters of mine and I beat

9230
03:13:14,510 --> 03:13:14,520
brothers and sisters of mine and I beat
 

9231
03:13:14,520 --> 03:13:17,570
brothers and sisters of mine and I beat
them all out yeah I won and so it's

9232
03:13:17,570 --> 03:13:17,580
them all out yeah I won and so it's
 

9233
03:13:17,580 --> 03:13:20,210
them all out yeah I won and so it's
interesting to to know

9234
03:13:20,210 --> 03:13:20,220
interesting to to know
 

9235
03:13:20,220 --> 03:13:21,110
interesting to to know
um

9236
03:13:21,110 --> 03:13:21,120
um
 

9237
03:13:21,120 --> 03:13:22,969
um
there's a temptation to say I'm somehow

9238
03:13:22,969 --> 03:13:22,979
there's a temptation to say I'm somehow
 

9239
03:13:22,979 --> 03:13:25,130
there's a temptation to say I'm somehow
better than them right

9240
03:13:25,130 --> 03:13:25,140
better than them right
 

9241
03:13:25,140 --> 03:13:28,190
better than them right
and now that goes into the next stage

9242
03:13:28,190 --> 03:13:28,200
and now that goes into the next stage
 

9243
03:13:28,200 --> 03:13:31,250
and now that goes into the next stage
of something you're or deeply thinking

9244
03:13:31,250 --> 03:13:31,260
of something you're or deeply thinking
 

9245
03:13:31,260 --> 03:13:33,050
of something you're or deeply thinking
about

9246
03:13:33,050 --> 03:13:33,060
about
 

9247
03:13:33,060 --> 03:13:34,490
about
which is

9248
03:13:34,490 --> 03:13:34,500
which is
 

9249
03:13:34,500 --> 03:13:35,150
which is
um

9250
03:13:35,150 --> 03:13:35,160
um
 

9251
03:13:35,160 --> 03:13:40,370
um
if we have more control now over the the

9252
03:13:40,370 --> 03:13:40,380
if we have more control now over the the
 

9253
03:13:40,380 --> 03:13:44,090
if we have more control now over the the
winning genetic code that becomes

9254
03:13:44,090 --> 03:13:44,100
winning genetic code that becomes
 

9255
03:13:44,100 --> 03:13:46,190
winning genetic code that becomes
Offspring if we have first not even

9256
03:13:46,190 --> 03:13:46,200
Offspring if we have first not even
 

9257
03:13:46,200 --> 03:13:47,769
Offspring if we have first not even
control just information

9258
03:13:47,769 --> 03:13:47,779
control just information
 

9259
03:13:47,779 --> 03:13:50,389
control just information
and then control

9260
03:13:50,389 --> 03:13:50,399
and then control
 

9261
03:13:50,399 --> 03:13:52,910
and then control
what do you think that world looks like

9262
03:13:52,910 --> 03:13:52,920
what do you think that world looks like
 

9263
03:13:52,920 --> 03:13:55,550
what do you think that world looks like
from a biological perspective and from

9264
03:13:55,550 --> 03:13:55,560
from a biological perspective and from
 

9265
03:13:55,560 --> 03:13:57,290
from a biological perspective and from
an ethical perspective when we start

9266
03:13:57,290 --> 03:13:57,300
an ethical perspective when we start
 

9267
03:13:57,300 --> 03:13:59,510
an ethical perspective when we start
getting more information and more

9268
03:13:59,510 --> 03:13:59,520
getting more information and more
 

9269
03:13:59,520 --> 03:14:00,590
getting more information and more
control

9270
03:14:00,590 --> 03:14:00,600
control
 

9271
03:14:00,600 --> 03:14:03,710
control
yeah great great question so first on

9272
03:14:03,710 --> 03:14:03,720
yeah great great question so first on
 

9273
03:14:03,720 --> 03:14:07,130
yeah great great question so first on
the sperm there can be up to about 1.2

9274
03:14:07,130 --> 03:14:07,140
the sperm there can be up to about 1.2
 

9275
03:14:07,140 --> 03:14:09,830
the sperm there can be up to about 1.2

9278
03:14:12,349 --> 03:14:12,359
ejaculation so as I mentioned in hacking
 

9279
03:14:12,359 --> 03:14:15,229

Darwin male sperm it's kind of a dime a

9280
03:14:15,229 --> 03:14:15,239
Darwin male sperm it's kind of a dime a
 

9281
03:14:15,239 --> 03:14:17,690

03:14:17,690 --> 03:14:17,700
dozen with all the all the guys in all
 

9283
03:14:17,700 --> 03:14:19,490
dozen with all the all the guys in all
in all the world just doing whatever

9284
03:14:19,490 --> 03:14:19,500
in all the world just doing whatever
 

9285
03:14:19,500 --> 03:14:21,229
in all the world just doing whatever
they do with it

9286
03:14:21,229 --> 03:14:21,239
they do with it
 

9287
03:14:21,239 --> 03:14:24,170
they do with it
um and it's an open question

9288
03:14:24,170 --> 03:14:24,180
um and it's an open question
 

9289
03:14:24,180 --> 03:14:27,530
um and it's an open question
um how competitive I mean there is an

9290
03:14:27,530 --> 03:14:27,540
um how competitive I mean there is an
 

9291
03:14:27,540 --> 03:14:29,690
um how competitive I mean there is an
element of luck and there is an element

9292
03:14:29,690 --> 03:14:29,700
element of luck and there is an element
 

9293
03:14:29,700 --> 03:14:31,389
element of luck and there is an element
of competition

9294
03:14:31,389 --> 03:14:31,399
of competition
 

9295
03:14:31,399 --> 03:14:34,849
of competition
and it's an open question how much that

9296
03:14:34,849 --> 03:14:34,859
and it's an open question how much that
 

9297
03:14:34,859 --> 03:14:36,610
and it's an open question how much that
competition

9298
03:14:36,610 --> 03:14:36,620
competition
 

9299
03:14:36,620 --> 03:14:39,530
competition
impacts the the outcome or whether it's

9300
03:14:39,530 --> 03:14:39,540
impacts the the outcome or whether it's
 

9301
03:14:39,540 --> 03:14:42,290
impacts the the outcome or whether it's
just luck but my guess is there's some

9302
03:14:42,290 --> 03:14:42,300
just luck but my guess is there's some
 

9303
03:14:42,300 --> 03:14:45,530
just luck but my guess is there's some
combination of of fitness and luck but

9304
03:14:45,530 --> 03:14:45,540
combination of of fitness and luck but
 

9305
03:14:45,540 --> 03:14:47,750
combination of of fitness and luck but
you're absolutely right that all of

9306
03:14:47,750 --> 03:14:47,760
you're absolutely right that all of
 

9307
03:14:47,760 --> 03:14:50,450
you're absolutely right that all of
those other sperm cells in in the

9308
03:14:50,450 --> 03:14:50,460
those other sperm cells in in the
 

9309
03:14:50,460 --> 03:14:53,090
those other sperm cells in in the
ejaculation if that's how the union of

9310
03:14:53,090 --> 03:14:53,100
ejaculation if that's how the union of
 

9311
03:14:53,100 --> 03:14:56,570
ejaculation if that's how the union of
spermine egg is is happening all of them

9312
03:14:56,570 --> 03:14:56,580
spermine egg is is happening all of them
 

9313
03:14:56,580 --> 03:14:59,870
spermine egg is is happening all of them
represent a different future and it's

9314
03:14:59,870 --> 03:14:59,880
represent a different future and it's
 

9315
03:14:59,880 --> 03:15:02,469
represent a different future and it's
there's a wonderful full book called

9316
03:15:02,469 --> 03:15:02,479
there's a wonderful full book called
 

9317
03:15:02,479 --> 03:15:05,929
there's a wonderful full book called
Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino and he

9318
03:15:05,929 --> 03:15:05,939
Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino and he
 

9319
03:15:05,939 --> 03:15:08,809
Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino and he
even talks about a city as something

9320
03:15:08,809 --> 03:15:08,819
even talks about a city as something
 

9321
03:15:08,819 --> 03:15:11,150
even talks about a city as something
like this where everybody you have your

9322
03:15:11,150 --> 03:15:11,160
like this where everybody you have your
 

9323
03:15:11,160 --> 03:15:12,050
like this where everybody you have your
life

9324
03:15:12,050 --> 03:15:12,060
life
 

9325
03:15:12,060 --> 03:15:13,969
life
but then you have all these alternate

9326
03:15:13,969 --> 03:15:13,979
but then you have all these alternate
 

9327
03:15:13,979 --> 03:15:15,410
but then you have all these alternate
lives and every time you make any

9328
03:15:15,410 --> 03:15:15,420
lives and every time you make any
 

9329
03:15:15,420 --> 03:15:18,170
lives and every time you make any
decision you're kind of and so but in

9330
03:15:18,170 --> 03:15:18,180
decision you're kind of and so but in
 

9331
03:15:18,180 --> 03:15:19,910
decision you're kind of and so but in
this Invisible Cities there's a little

9332
03:15:19,910 --> 03:15:19,920
this Invisible Cities there's a little
 

9333
03:15:19,920 --> 03:15:22,969
this Invisible Cities there's a little
string that goes toward that alternate

9334
03:15:22,969 --> 03:15:22,979
string that goes toward that alternate
 

9335
03:15:22,979 --> 03:15:24,950
string that goes toward that alternate
life and then the city becomes this

9336
03:15:24,950 --> 03:15:24,960
life and then the city becomes this
 

9337
03:15:24,960 --> 03:15:28,250
life and then the city becomes this
weaving of all the strings of people's

9338
03:15:28,250 --> 03:15:28,260
weaving of all the strings of people's
 

9339
03:15:28,260 --> 03:15:30,889
weaving of all the strings of people's
real lives and the alternate lives that

9340
03:15:30,889 --> 03:15:30,899
real lives and the alternate lives that
 

9341
03:15:30,899 --> 03:15:32,929
real lives and the alternate lives that
they could have taken had they made any

9342
03:15:32,929 --> 03:15:32,939
they could have taken had they made any
 

9343
03:15:32,939 --> 03:15:34,370
they could have taken had they made any
other any other different steps so that

9344
03:15:34,370 --> 03:15:34,380
other any other different steps so that
 

9345
03:15:34,380 --> 03:15:37,010
other any other different steps so that
part it's like a a deep philosophical

9346
03:15:37,010 --> 03:15:37,020
part it's like a a deep philosophical
 

9347
03:15:37,020 --> 03:15:39,110
part it's like a a deep philosophical
question it's not just for us it's for

9348
03:15:39,110 --> 03:15:39,120
question it's not just for us it's for
 

9349
03:15:39,120 --> 03:15:41,530
question it's not just for us it's for
all of it's It's baked into

evolutionary biology is this what are

9352
03:15:44,030 --> 03:15:44,040
evolutionary biology is this what are
 

9353
03:15:44,040 --> 03:15:46,490
evolutionary biology is this what are
the different strategies for different

9354
03:15:46,490 --> 03:15:46,500
the different strategies for different
 

9355
03:15:46,500 --> 03:15:48,950
the different strategies for different
species to achieve Fitness and there's

9356
03:15:48,950 --> 03:15:48,960
species to achieve Fitness and there's
 

9357
03:15:48,960 --> 03:15:51,710
species to achieve Fitness and there's
some of the different corals or other

9358
03:15:51,710 --> 03:15:51,720
some of the different corals or other
 

9359
03:15:51,720 --> 03:15:53,690
some of the different corals or other
fish where they just kind of release the

9360
03:15:53,690 --> 03:15:53,700
fish where they just kind of release the
 

9361
03:15:53,700 --> 03:15:55,910
fish where they just kind of release the
eggs into the water and there's there's

9362
03:15:55,910 --> 03:15:55,920
eggs into the water and there's there's
 

9363
03:15:55,920 --> 03:15:59,570
eggs into the water and there's there's
all different kinds of of ways and then

all different kinds of of ways and then
 

9365
03:15:59,580 --> 03:16:01,910
all different kinds of of ways and then
you're right in my book

um we are already

9380
03:16:19,809 --> 03:16:19,819
um we are already
 

9381
03:16:19,819 --> 03:16:22,250
um we are already
participating in a revolutionary

9382
03:16:22,250 --> 03:16:22,260
participating in a revolutionary
 

9383
03:16:22,260 --> 03:16:24,710
participating in a revolutionary
transformation not just because of the

9384
03:16:24,710 --> 03:16:24,720
transformation not just because of the
 

9385
03:16:24,720 --> 03:16:26,809
transformation not just because of the
Diagnostics that we have things like

9386
03:16:26,809 --> 03:16:26,819
Diagnostics that we have things like
 

9387
03:16:26,819 --> 03:16:28,309
Diagnostics that we have things like
ultrasound

9388
03:16:28,309 --> 03:16:28,319
ultrasound
 

9389
03:16:28,319 --> 03:16:30,349
ultrasound
um but because now an increasing number

9390
03:16:30,349 --> 03:16:30,359
um but because now an increasing number
 

9391
03:16:30,359 --> 03:16:33,050
um but because now an increasing number
of us are being born through in vitro

9392
03:16:33,050 --> 03:16:33,060
of us are being born through in vitro
 

9393
03:16:33,060 --> 03:16:34,969
of us are being born through in vitro
fertilization which means the eggs are

9394
03:16:34,969 --> 03:16:34,979
fertilization which means the eggs are
 

9395
03:16:34,979 --> 03:16:37,010
fertilization which means the eggs are
extracted from the mother they're

9396
03:16:37,010 --> 03:16:37,020
extracted from the mother they're
 

9397
03:16:37,020 --> 03:16:39,830
extracted from the mother they're
fertilized by the father's sperm in

9398
03:16:39,830 --> 03:16:39,840
fertilized by the father's sperm in
 

9399
03:16:39,840 --> 03:16:44,030
fertilized by the father's sperm in
vitro in a lab and then re-implanted in

03:16:44,929 --> 03:16:44,939
the mother
 

9403
03:16:44,939 --> 03:16:49,010
the mother
on top of that there's a somewhat newer

9404
03:16:49,010 --> 03:16:49,020
on top of that there's a somewhat newer
 

9405
03:16:49,020 --> 03:16:52,210
on top of that there's a somewhat newer
but still now you know older technology

9406
03:16:52,210 --> 03:16:52,220
but still now you know older technology
 

9407
03:16:52,220 --> 03:16:55,070
but still now you know older technology
called pre-implantation genetic testing

9408
03:16:55,070 --> 03:16:55,080
called pre-implantation genetic testing
 

9409
03:16:55,080 --> 03:16:57,830
called pre-implantation genetic testing
and so as everyone knows from high

9410
03:16:57,830 --> 03:16:57,840
and so as everyone knows from high
 

9411
03:16:57,840 --> 03:16:59,650
and so as everyone knows from high
school biology you have the the

9412
03:16:59,650 --> 03:16:59,660
school biology you have the the
 

9413
03:16:59,660 --> 03:17:03,349
school biology you have the the
fertilized egg and then it goes one cell

9414
03:17:03,349 --> 03:17:03,359
fertilized egg and then it goes one cell
 

9415
03:17:03,359 --> 03:17:05,090
fertilized egg and then it goes one cell
to two cells to four to eight and

9416
03:17:05,090 --> 03:17:05,100
to two cells to four to eight and
 

9417
03:17:05,100 --> 03:17:07,910
to two cells to four to eight and
whatever and after around five days in

9418
03:17:07,910 --> 03:17:07,920
whatever and after around five days in
 

9419
03:17:07,920 --> 03:17:11,510
whatever and after around five days in
this PGT process a few cells are

9420
03:17:11,510 --> 03:17:11,520
this PGT process a few cells are
 

9421
03:17:11,520 --> 03:17:14,170
this PGT process a few cells are
extracted so let's say you have 10

9422
03:17:14,170 --> 03:17:14,180
extracted so let's say you have 10
 

9423
03:17:14,180 --> 03:17:16,790
extracted so let's say you have 10
fertilized eggs early stage embryos a

9424
03:17:16,790 --> 03:17:16,800
fertilized eggs early stage embryos a
 

9425
03:17:16,800 --> 03:17:18,710
fertilized eggs early stage embryos a
few cells are extracted from each and

9426
03:17:18,710 --> 03:17:18,720
few cells are extracted from each and
 

9427
03:17:18,720 --> 03:17:21,710
few cells are extracted from each and
those cells if they would the ones that

9428
03:17:21,710 --> 03:17:21,720
those cells if they would the ones that
 

9429
03:17:21,720 --> 03:17:23,570
those cells if they would the ones that
are attracted would end up becoming the

9430
03:17:23,570 --> 03:17:23,580
are attracted would end up becoming the
 

9431
03:17:23,580 --> 03:17:26,870
are attracted would end up becoming the
placenta but every one of our cells has

9432
03:17:26,870 --> 03:17:26,880
placenta but every one of our cells has
 

9433
03:17:26,880 --> 03:17:31,370
placenta but every one of our cells has
other than a few has our full genome and

9434
03:17:31,370 --> 03:17:31,380
other than a few has our full genome and
 

9435
03:17:31,380 --> 03:17:33,229
other than a few has our full genome and
so then you sequence those cells and

9436
03:17:33,229 --> 03:17:33,239
so then you sequence those cells and
 

9437
03:17:33,239 --> 03:17:35,150
so then you sequence those cells and
with pre-implantation genetic testing

9438
03:17:35,150 --> 03:17:35,160
with pre-implantation genetic testing
 

9439
03:17:35,160 --> 03:17:38,090
with pre-implantation genetic testing
now what you can do is you can screen

9440
03:17:38,090 --> 03:17:38,100
now what you can do is you can screen
 

9441
03:17:38,100 --> 03:17:42,650
now what you can do is you can screen
out deadly uh single gel a single gene

9442
03:17:42,650 --> 03:17:42,660
out deadly uh single gel a single gene
 

9443
03:17:42,660 --> 03:17:45,530
out deadly uh single gel a single gene
mutation disorders things that could be

9444
03:17:45,530 --> 03:17:45,540
mutation disorders things that could be
 

9445
03:17:45,540 --> 03:17:48,290
mutation disorders things that could be
deadly or life ruining and so people use

9446
03:17:48,290 --> 03:17:48,300
deadly or life ruining and so people use
 

9447
03:17:48,300 --> 03:17:52,130
deadly or life ruining and so people use
it to determine which of those 10

9448
03:17:52,130 --> 03:17:52,140
it to determine which of those 10
 

9449
03:17:52,140 --> 03:17:54,950
it to determine which of those 10
um early stage embryos to implant in a

9450
03:17:54,950 --> 03:17:54,960
um early stage embryos to implant in a
 

9451
03:17:54,960 --> 03:17:57,830
um early stage embryos to implant in a
mother as we shift towards a much

03:17:57,830 --> 03:17:57,840
mother as we shift towards a much
 

9453
03:17:57,840 --> 03:18:00,410
mother as we shift towards a much
greater understanding of genetics and

03:18:00,410 --> 03:18:00,420
greater understanding of genetics and
 

9455
03:18:00,420 --> 03:18:02,510
greater understanding of genetics and
that is part of our just the broader

genetics Revolution
 

9459
03:18:04,200 --> 03:18:06,170
genetics Revolution
um but within that in our transition

9460
03:18:06,170 --> 03:18:06,180
um but within that in our transition
 

9461
03:18:06,180 --> 03:18:08,510
um but within that in our transition
from personalized to Precision

9462
03:18:08,510 --> 03:18:08,520
from personalized to Precision
 

9463
03:18:08,520 --> 03:18:10,790
from personalized to Precision
Healthcare more and more of us are going

9464
03:18:10,790 --> 03:18:10,800
Healthcare more and more of us are going
 

9465
03:18:10,800 --> 03:18:12,349
Healthcare more and more of us are going
to have our whole genome sequenced

9466
03:18:12,349 --> 03:18:12,359
to have our whole genome sequenced
 

9467
03:18:12,359 --> 03:18:13,849
to have our whole genome sequenced
because it's going to be the foundation

9468
03:18:13,849 --> 03:18:13,859
because it's going to be the foundation
 

9469
03:18:13,859 --> 03:18:15,530
because it's going to be the foundation
of getting personalized health care

9470
03:18:15,530 --> 03:18:15,540
of getting personalized health care
 

9471
03:18:15,540 --> 03:18:18,469
of getting personalized health care
we're going to have already Millions but

9472
03:18:18,469 --> 03:18:18,479
we're going to have already Millions but
 

9473
03:18:18,479 --> 03:18:21,170
we're going to have already Millions but
very soon billions of people who've had

9474
03:18:21,170 --> 03:18:21,180
very soon billions of people who've had
 

9475
03:18:21,180 --> 03:18:23,450
very soon billions of people who've had
their whole genome sequenced and then

9476
03:18:23,450 --> 03:18:23,460
their whole genome sequenced and then
 

9477
03:18:23,460 --> 03:18:25,670
their whole genome sequenced and then
we'll have big databases of people's

9478
03:18:25,670 --> 03:18:25,680
we'll have big databases of people's
 

9479
03:18:25,680 --> 03:18:28,250
we'll have big databases of people's
genetic genotypic information and life

03:18:33,170 --> 03:18:33,180
coming into your area are tools of
 

9485
03:18:33,180 --> 03:18:34,910
coming into your area are tools of

machine learning and data analytics
 

9487
03:18:34,920 --> 03:18:37,010
machine learning and data analytics
we're going to be able to increasingly

9488
03:18:37,010 --> 03:18:37,020
we're going to be able to increasingly
 

9489
03:18:37,020 --> 03:18:40,010
we're going to be able to increasingly
understand patterns of genetic

9490
03:18:40,010 --> 03:18:40,020
understand patterns of genetic
 

9491
03:18:40,020 --> 03:18:41,690
understand patterns of genetic
expression even though we're all so

9492
03:18:41,690 --> 03:18:41,700
expression even though we're all so
 

9493
03:18:41,700 --> 03:18:43,429
expression even though we're all so
predict how that genetic information

9494
03:18:43,429 --> 03:18:43,439
predict how that genetic information
 

9495
03:18:43,439 --> 03:18:46,309
predict how that genetic information
will get expressed correct yeah never

9496
03:18:46,309 --> 03:18:46,319
will get expressed correct yeah never
 

9497
03:18:46,319 --> 03:18:48,769
will get expressed correct yeah never
perfectly perhaps but more and more

9498
03:18:48,769 --> 03:18:48,779
perfectly perhaps but more and more
 

9499
03:18:48,779 --> 03:18:51,650
perfectly perhaps but more and more
always more and more and so with that

9500
03:18:51,650 --> 03:18:51,660
always more and more and so with that
 

9501
03:18:51,660 --> 03:18:53,929
always more and more and so with that
information we aren't going to just be

9502
03:18:53,929 --> 03:18:53,939
information we aren't going to just be
 

9503
03:18:53,939 --> 03:18:55,969

03:18:55,969 --> 03:18:55,979
in the even now
 

9505
03:18:55,979 --> 03:18:58,550
in the even now
um we aren't going to just be selecting

9506
03:18:58,550 --> 03:18:58,560
um we aren't going to just be selecting
 

9507
03:18:58,560 --> 03:19:01,790
um we aren't going to just be selecting
based on which of these 10 early stage

9508
03:19:01,790 --> 03:19:01,800
based on which of these 10 early stage
 

9509
03:19:01,800 --> 03:19:03,650
based on which of these 10 early stage
embryos is carrying a deadly genetic

9513
03:19:04,620 --> 03:19:06,170
disorder
but we can we'll be able to know

9514
03:19:06,170 --> 03:19:06,180
but we can we'll be able to know
 

9515
03:19:06,180 --> 03:19:09,469
but we can we'll be able to know
everything that can be partly or

9516
03:19:09,469 --> 03:19:09,479
everything that can be partly or
 

9517
03:19:09,479 --> 03:19:12,590
everything that can be partly or
entirely predicted by genetics and

9518
03:19:12,590 --> 03:19:12,600
entirely predicted by genetics and
 

9519
03:19:12,600 --> 03:19:15,469
entirely predicted by genetics and
there's a lot of our Humanity that that

9520
03:19:15,469 --> 03:19:15,479
there's a lot of our Humanity that that
 

9521
03:19:15,479 --> 03:19:18,889
there's a lot of our Humanity that that
fits into that category and um certainly

9522
03:19:18,889 --> 03:19:18,899
fits into that category and um certainly
 

9523
03:19:18,899 --> 03:19:22,309
fits into that category and um certainly
simple traits like height and eye color

9524
03:19:22,309 --> 03:19:22,319
simple traits like height and eye color
 

9525
03:19:22,319 --> 03:19:24,290
simple traits like height and eye color
and and things like that I mean height

9526
03:19:24,290 --> 03:19:24,300
and and things like that I mean height
 

9527
03:19:24,300 --> 03:19:27,050
and and things like that I mean height
is not at all simple but it's it's in if

9528
03:19:27,050 --> 03:19:27,060
is not at all simple but it's it's in if
 

9529
03:19:27,060 --> 03:19:29,389
is not at all simple but it's it's in if
you have good nutrition it's it's

9530
03:19:29,389 --> 03:19:29,399
you have good nutrition it's it's
 

9531
03:19:29,399 --> 03:19:31,790
you have good nutrition it's it's
entirely or mostly genetic but even

9532
03:19:31,790 --> 03:19:31,800
entirely or mostly genetic but even
 

9533
03:19:31,800 --> 03:19:33,769
entirely or mostly genetic but even
personality traits and personality

9534
03:19:33,769 --> 03:19:33,779
personality traits and personality
 

9535
03:19:33,779 --> 03:19:35,750
personality traits and personality
Styles there are a lot of things that we

9536
03:19:35,750 --> 03:19:35,760
Styles there are a lot of things that we
 

9537
03:19:35,760 --> 03:19:38,210
Styles there are a lot of things that we
see just as the experience the beauty of

9538
03:19:38,210 --> 03:19:38,220
see just as the experience the beauty of
 

9539
03:19:38,220 --> 03:19:41,750
see just as the experience the beauty of
life that are partly have a genetic

9540
03:19:41,750 --> 03:19:41,760
life that are partly have a genetic
 

9541
03:19:41,760 --> 03:19:45,290
life that are partly have a genetic
foundation and so whatever part of these

9542
03:19:45,290 --> 03:19:45,300
foundation and so whatever part of these
 

9543
03:19:45,300 --> 03:19:49,370
foundation and so whatever part of these
traits are definable and influenced by

9544
03:19:49,370 --> 03:19:49,380
traits are definable and influenced by
 

9545
03:19:49,380 --> 03:19:51,769
traits are definable and influenced by
genetics we're going to have greater and

9546
03:19:51,769 --> 03:19:51,779
genetics we're going to have greater and
 

9547
03:19:51,779 --> 03:19:54,469
genetics we're going to have greater and
greater predictability within a range

9548
03:19:54,469 --> 03:19:54,479
greater predictability within a range
 

9549
03:19:54,479 --> 03:19:58,690
greater predictability within a range
and so selecting those embryos will be

9550
03:19:58,690 --> 03:19:58,700
and so selecting those embryos will be
 

9551
03:19:58,700 --> 03:20:02,570
and so selecting those embryos will be
informed by that kind of of knowledge

9552
03:20:02,570 --> 03:20:02,580
informed by that kind of of knowledge
 

9553
03:20:02,580 --> 03:20:05,090
informed by that kind of of knowledge
and that's why in hacking Darwin I talk

9554
03:20:05,090 --> 03:20:05,100
and that's why in hacking Darwin I talk
 

9555
03:20:05,100 --> 03:20:08,690
and that's why in hacking Darwin I talk
about embryo selection as being a key

9556
03:20:08,690 --> 03:20:08,700
about embryo selection as being a key
 

9557
03:20:08,700 --> 03:20:11,110
about embryo selection as being a key
driver of the future of human evolution

9558
03:20:11,110 --> 03:20:11,120
driver of the future of human evolution
 

9559
03:20:11,120 --> 03:20:15,610
driver of the future of human evolution
then on top of that there is in 2012

9560
03:20:15,610 --> 03:20:15,620
then on top of that there is in 2012
 

9561
03:20:15,620 --> 03:20:19,309
then on top of that there is in 2012
yamanaka a Japanese amazing Japanese

9562
03:20:19,309 --> 03:20:19,319
yamanaka a Japanese amazing Japanese
 

9563
03:20:19,319 --> 03:20:22,130
yamanaka a Japanese amazing Japanese
scientists won the Nobel Prize for

9564
03:20:22,130 --> 03:20:22,140
scientists won the Nobel Prize for
 

9565
03:20:22,140 --> 03:20:23,990
scientists won the Nobel Prize for
developing a process for creating what

9566
03:20:23,990 --> 03:20:24,000
developing a process for creating what
 

9567
03:20:24,000 --> 03:20:26,330
developing a process for creating what
are called induced pluripotent stem

9568
03:20:26,330 --> 03:20:26,340
are called induced pluripotent stem
 

9569
03:20:26,340 --> 03:20:29,150
are called induced pluripotent stem
cells IPS cells and what IPS cells are

9570
03:20:29,150 --> 03:20:29,160
cells IPS cells and what IPS cells are
 

9571
03:20:29,160 --> 03:20:32,510
cells IPS cells and what IPS cells are
is you can induce an adult cell to go

9572
03:20:32,510 --> 03:20:32,520
is you can induce an adult cell to go
 

9573
03:20:32,520 --> 03:20:34,969
is you can induce an adult cell to go
back in evolutionary time and become a

9574
03:20:34,969 --> 03:20:34,979
back in evolutionary time and become a
 

9575
03:20:34,979 --> 03:20:37,370
back in evolutionary time and become a
stem cell and a stem cell is like when

9576
03:20:37,370 --> 03:20:37,380
stem cell and a stem cell is like when
 

9577
03:20:37,380 --> 03:20:38,809
stem cell and a stem cell is like when
we're when you're when we're a

9578
03:20:38,809 --> 03:20:38,819
we're when you're when we're a
 

9579
03:20:38,819 --> 03:20:41,030
we're when you're when we're a
fertilized egg like our entire blueprint

9580
03:20:41,030 --> 03:20:41,040
fertilized egg like our entire blueprint
 

9581
03:20:41,040 --> 03:20:43,969
fertilized egg like our entire blueprint
is in that one cell and that cell can be

9582
03:20:43,969 --> 03:20:43,979
is in that one cell and that cell can be
 

9583
03:20:43,979 --> 03:20:47,150
is in that one cell and that cell can be
anything but then it starts to spend our

9584
03:20:47,150 --> 03:20:47,160
anything but then it starts to spend our
 

9585
03:20:47,160 --> 03:20:48,769
anything but then it starts to spend our
cells start to specialize and that's why

9586
03:20:48,769 --> 03:20:48,779
cells start to specialize and that's why
 

9587
03:20:48,779 --> 03:20:50,809
cells start to specialize and that's why
we have skin cells and blood cells and

9588
03:20:50,809 --> 03:20:50,819
we have skin cells and blood cells and
 

9589
03:20:50,819 --> 03:20:51,950
we have skin cells and blood cells and
all the different types of things so

9590
03:20:51,950 --> 03:20:51,960
all the different types of things so
 

9591
03:20:51,960 --> 03:20:54,429
all the different types of things so
with the yamanaka process

9592
03:20:54,429 --> 03:20:54,439
with the yamanaka process
 

9593
03:20:54,439 --> 03:20:58,729
with the yamanaka process
we can induce an adult adult cell to

9594
03:20:58,729 --> 03:20:58,739
we can induce an adult adult cell to
 

9595
03:20:58,739 --> 03:21:01,010
we can induce an adult adult cell to
become a stem cell so the relevance to

9596
03:21:01,010 --> 03:21:01,020
become a stem cell so the relevance to
 

9597
03:21:01,020 --> 03:21:03,530
become a stem cell so the relevance to
this story is what you it can do and it

9598
03:21:03,530 --> 03:21:03,540
this story is what you it can do and it
 

9599
03:21:03,540 --> 03:21:06,349
this story is what you it can do and it
works now in animal models and as far as

9600
03:21:06,349 --> 03:21:06,359
works now in animal models and as far as
 

9601
03:21:06,359 --> 03:21:08,389
works now in animal models and as far as
I know it hasn't yet been done in humans

9602
03:21:08,389 --> 03:21:08,399
I know it hasn't yet been done in humans
 

9603
03:21:08,399 --> 03:21:10,190
I know it hasn't yet been done in humans
but it works pretty well in animal

9604
03:21:10,190 --> 03:21:10,200
but it works pretty well in animal
 

9605
03:21:10,200 --> 03:21:13,190
but it works pretty well in animal
models you take any adult cell but skin

9606
03:21:13,190 --> 03:21:13,200
models you take any adult cell but skin
 

9607
03:21:13,200 --> 03:21:16,010
models you take any adult cell but skin
cells are probably the easiest

9608
03:21:16,010 --> 03:21:16,020
cells are probably the easiest
 

9609
03:21:16,020 --> 03:21:19,790
cells are probably the easiest
you induce this skin cell into a stem

9610
03:21:19,790 --> 03:21:19,800
you induce this skin cell into a stem
 

9611
03:21:19,800 --> 03:21:21,349
you induce this skin cell into a stem
cell and if you just take a little skin

9612
03:21:21,349 --> 03:21:21,359
cell and if you just take a little skin
 

9613
03:21:21,359 --> 03:21:24,050
cell and if you just take a little skin
graft it would have millions of of cells

9614
03:21:24,050 --> 03:21:24,060
graft it would have millions of of cells
 

9615
03:21:24,060 --> 03:21:26,330
graft it would have millions of of cells
you induce those skin cells into stem

9616
03:21:26,330 --> 03:21:26,340
you induce those skin cells into stem
 

9617
03:21:26,340 --> 03:21:29,330
you induce those skin cells into stem
cells then you induce those stem cells

9618
03:21:29,330 --> 03:21:29,340
cells then you induce those stem cells
 

9619
03:21:29,340 --> 03:21:32,630
cells then you induce those stem cells
into egg precursor cells then you induce

9620
03:21:32,630 --> 03:21:32,640
into egg precursor cells then you induce
 

9621
03:21:32,640 --> 03:21:36,349
into egg precursor cells then you induce
those egg precursor cells into eggs egg

9622
03:21:36,349 --> 03:21:36,359
those egg precursor cells into eggs egg
 

9623
03:21:36,359 --> 03:21:40,309
those egg precursor cells into eggs egg
cells then because we have this massive

9624
03:21:40,309 --> 03:21:40,319
cells then because we have this massive
 

9625
03:21:40,319 --> 03:21:44,030
cells then because we have this massive
over abundance of male sperm it's then

9626
03:21:44,030 --> 03:21:44,040
over abundance of male sperm it's then
 

9627
03:21:44,040 --> 03:21:47,690
over abundance of male sperm it's then
you could fertilize let's call it ten

9628
03:21:47,690 --> 03:21:47,700
you could fertilize let's call it ten
 

9629
03:21:47,700 --> 03:21:50,510
you could fertilize let's call it ten
thousand of the mother's egg so you have

9630
03:21:50,510 --> 03:21:50,520
thousand of the mother's egg so you have
 

9631
03:21:50,520 --> 03:21:53,210
thousand of the mother's egg so you have
10 000 eggs which are fertilized sounds

9632
03:21:53,210 --> 03:21:53,220
10 000 eggs which are fertilized sounds
 

9633
03:21:53,220 --> 03:21:56,330
10 000 eggs which are fertilized sounds
like a party yeah then you have an

9634
03:21:56,330 --> 03:21:56,340
like a party yeah then you have an
 

9635
03:21:56,340 --> 03:21:58,429
like a party yeah then you have an
automated process

9636
03:21:58,429 --> 03:21:58,439
automated process
 

9637
03:21:58,439 --> 03:22:01,070
automated process
um for what I what I mentioned before in

9638
03:22:01,070 --> 03:22:01,080
um for what I what I mentioned before in
 

9639
03:22:01,080 --> 03:22:02,750
um for what I what I mentioned before in
pre-implantation genetic testing you

9640
03:22:02,750 --> 03:22:02,760
pre-implantation genetic testing you
 

9641
03:22:02,760 --> 03:22:04,910
pre-implantation genetic testing you
grow them all for five days you extract

9642
03:22:04,910 --> 03:22:04,920
grow them all for five days you extract
 

9643
03:22:04,920 --> 03:22:07,550
grow them all for five days you extract
a few cells from each you test them and

9644
03:22:07,550 --> 03:22:07,560
a few cells from each you test them and
 

9645
03:22:07,560 --> 03:22:09,050
a few cells from each you test them and
that's I had a piece in the New York

9646
03:22:09,050 --> 03:22:09,060
that's I had a piece in the New York
 

9647
03:22:09,060 --> 03:22:10,849
that's I had a piece in the New York
Times a couple of years ago imagining

9648
03:22:10,849 --> 03:22:10,859
Times a couple of years ago imagining
 

9649
03:22:10,859 --> 03:22:12,410
Times a couple of years ago imagining
what it would be like to go to a

9650
03:22:12,410 --> 03:22:12,420
what it would be like to go to a
 

9651
03:22:12,420 --> 03:22:15,050
what it would be like to go to a
fertility clinic in the year 2050 and

9652
03:22:15,050 --> 03:22:15,060
fertility clinic in the year 2050 and
 

9653
03:22:15,060 --> 03:22:17,510
fertility clinic in the year 2050 and
the choice is is involved yeah well no

9654
03:22:17,510 --> 03:22:17,520
the choice is is involved yeah well no
 

9655
03:22:17,520 --> 03:22:19,849
the choice is is involved yeah well no
no there are but the choice is not do

9656
03:22:19,849 --> 03:22:19,859
no there are but the choice is not do
 

9657
03:22:19,859 --> 03:22:22,490
no there are but the choice is not do
you want a kid who does or doesn't have

9658
03:22:22,490 --> 03:22:22,500
you want a kid who does or doesn't have
 

9659
03:22:22,500 --> 03:22:25,729
you want a kid who does or doesn't have
let's call it um Tay Sachs

9660
03:22:25,729 --> 03:22:25,739
let's call it um Tay Sachs
 

9661
03:22:25,739 --> 03:22:28,610
let's call it um Tay Sachs
um it's a whole range of possibilities

9662
03:22:28,610 --> 03:22:28,620
um it's a whole range of possibilities
 

9663
03:22:28,620 --> 03:22:31,849
um it's a whole range of possibilities
including very intimate

9664
03:22:31,849 --> 03:22:31,859
including very intimate
 

9665
03:22:31,859 --> 03:22:35,809
including very intimate
um uh traits like height IQ personality

9666
03:22:35,809 --> 03:22:35,819
um uh traits like height IQ personality
 

9667
03:22:35,819 --> 03:22:37,130
um uh traits like height IQ personality
style it doesn't mean you can predict

9668
03:22:37,130 --> 03:22:37,140
style it doesn't mean you can predict
 

9669
03:22:37,140 --> 03:22:39,830
style it doesn't mean you can predict
everything but it means there will be

9670
03:22:39,830 --> 03:22:39,840
everything but it means there will be
 

9671
03:22:39,840 --> 03:22:41,990
everything but it means there will be
increasing predictability so if you're

9672
03:22:41,990 --> 03:22:42,000
increasing predictability so if you're
 

9673
03:22:42,000 --> 03:22:45,130
increasing predictability so if you're
if you're choosing from 10 000 eggs

9674
03:22:45,130 --> 03:22:45,140
if you're choosing from 10 000 eggs
 

9675
03:22:45,140 --> 03:22:47,389
if you're choosing from 10 000 eggs
fertilized eggs early stage embryos

9676
03:22:47,389 --> 03:22:47,399
fertilized eggs early stage embryos
 

9677
03:22:47,399 --> 03:22:49,729
fertilized eggs early stage embryos
that's a lot of choice

9678
03:22:49,729 --> 03:22:49,739
that's a lot of choice
 

9679
03:22:49,739 --> 03:22:54,769
that's a lot of choice
um and on top of that then we have the

9680
03:22:54,769 --> 03:22:54,779
um and on top of that then we have the
 

9681
03:22:54,779 --> 03:22:58,190
um and on top of that then we have the
new technology of human genome editing

9682
03:22:58,190 --> 03:22:58,200
new technology of human genome editing
 

9683
03:22:58,200 --> 03:23:00,530
new technology of human genome editing
many people have heard of crispr but

9684
03:23:00,530 --> 03:23:00,540
many people have heard of crispr but
 

9685
03:23:00,540 --> 03:23:02,210
many people have heard of crispr but
what I say is if you think of human

9686
03:23:02,210 --> 03:23:02,220
what I say is if you think of human
 

9687
03:23:02,220 --> 03:23:05,330
what I say is if you think of human
genome editing as a pie human I'm sorry

9688
03:23:05,330 --> 03:23:05,340
genome editing as a pie human I'm sorry
 

9689
03:23:05,340 --> 03:23:08,030
genome editing as a pie human I'm sorry
Human Genome engineering as a pi genome

9690
03:23:08,030 --> 03:23:08,040
Human Genome engineering as a pi genome
 

9691
03:23:08,040 --> 03:23:10,429
Human Genome engineering as a pi genome
editing is a slice and crispr is just a

9692
03:23:10,429 --> 03:23:10,439
editing is a slice and crispr is just a
 

9693
03:23:10,439 --> 03:23:12,590
editing is a slice and crispr is just a
sliver of that slice it's just one of

9694
03:23:12,590 --> 03:23:12,600
sliver of that slice it's just one of
 

9695
03:23:12,600 --> 03:23:14,510
sliver of that slice it's just one of
our tools for genome editing and then

9696
03:23:14,510 --> 03:23:14,520
our tools for genome editing and then
 

9697
03:23:14,520 --> 03:23:15,889
our tools for genome editing and then
things are getting better and better

9698
03:23:15,889 --> 03:23:15,899
things are getting better and better
 

9699
03:23:15,899 --> 03:23:20,510
things are getting better and better
better then you can go in and change

9700
03:23:20,510 --> 03:23:20,520
better then you can go in and change
 

9701
03:23:20,520 --> 03:23:22,690
better then you can go in and change
let's say I mean again it starts simple

9702
03:23:22,690 --> 03:23:22,700
let's say I mean again it starts simple
 

9703
03:23:22,700 --> 03:23:25,969
let's say I mean again it starts simple
a small number of genes let's say you've

9704
03:23:25,969 --> 03:23:25,979
a small number of genes let's say you've
 

9705
03:23:25,979 --> 03:23:28,130
a small number of genes let's say you've
selected from among the one of ten or

9706
03:23:28,130 --> 03:23:28,140
selected from among the one of ten or
 

9707
03:23:28,140 --> 03:23:30,590
selected from among the one of ten or
the one of ten thousand but there are a

9708
03:23:30,590 --> 03:23:30,600
the one of ten thousand but there are a
 

9709
03:23:30,600 --> 03:23:32,210
the one of ten thousand but there are a
number of changes that you would like to

9710
03:23:32,210 --> 03:23:32,220
number of changes that you would like to
 

9711
03:23:32,220 --> 03:23:34,190
number of changes that you would like to
make to achieve some kind of outcome and

9712
03:23:34,190 --> 03:23:34,200
make to achieve some kind of outcome and
 

9713
03:23:34,200 --> 03:23:36,650
make to achieve some kind of outcome and
biology is incredibly complex and it's

9714
03:23:36,650 --> 03:23:36,660
biology is incredibly complex and it's
 

9715
03:23:36,660 --> 03:23:39,170
biology is incredibly complex and it's
not that one gene does one thing one

9716
03:23:39,170 --> 03:23:39,180
not that one gene does one thing one
 

9717
03:23:39,180 --> 03:23:41,229
not that one gene does one thing one
gene does probably a lot of things

9718
03:23:41,229 --> 03:23:41,239
gene does probably a lot of things
 

9719
03:23:41,239 --> 03:23:43,849
gene does probably a lot of things
simultaneously which is why the decision

9720
03:23:43,849 --> 03:23:43,859
simultaneously which is why the decision
 

9721
03:23:43,859 --> 03:23:46,370
simultaneously which is why the decision
about changing one gene if it's causing

9722
03:23:46,370 --> 03:23:46,380
about changing one gene if it's causing
 

9723
03:23:46,380 --> 03:23:49,250
about changing one gene if it's causing
deathly harm is easier than when we

9724
03:23:49,250 --> 03:23:49,260
deathly harm is easier than when we
 

9725
03:23:49,260 --> 03:23:51,590
deathly harm is easier than when we
think about the complexity of of biology

9726
03:23:51,590 --> 03:23:51,600
think about the complexity of of biology
 

9727
03:23:51,600 --> 03:23:53,389
think about the complexity of of biology
whether the machine learning gets better

9728
03:23:53,389 --> 03:23:53,399
whether the machine learning gets better
 

9729
03:23:53,399 --> 03:23:55,190
whether the machine learning gets better
and better predicting the full

9730
03:23:55,190 --> 03:23:55,200
and better predicting the full
 

9731
03:23:55,200 --> 03:23:58,070
and better predicting the full
complexity biology so exactly as one

9732
03:23:58,070 --> 03:23:58,080
complexity biology so exactly as one
 

9733
03:23:58,080 --> 03:24:00,349
complexity biology so exactly as one
gets better than your editing uh your

9734
03:24:00,349 --> 03:24:00,359
gets better than your editing uh your
 

9735
03:24:00,359 --> 03:24:03,889
gets better than your editing uh your
ability to uh reliably edit such that

9736
03:24:03,889 --> 03:24:03,899
ability to uh reliably edit such that
 

9737
03:24:03,899 --> 03:24:05,570
ability to uh reliably edit such that
the conclusions are predictable gets

9738
03:24:05,570 --> 03:24:05,580
the conclusions are predictable gets
 

9739
03:24:05,580 --> 03:24:06,889
the conclusions are predictable gets
better and better so those are two are

9740
03:24:06,889 --> 03:24:06,899
better and better so those are two are
 

9741
03:24:06,899 --> 03:24:08,150
better and better so those are two are
coupled together

9742
03:24:08,150 --> 03:24:08,160
coupled together
 

9743
03:24:08,160 --> 03:24:10,849
coupled together
exactly and then so that's why and and

9744
03:24:10,849 --> 03:24:10,859
exactly and then so that's why and and
 

9745
03:24:10,859 --> 03:24:12,349
exactly and then so that's why and and
people would say well that I mean I I

9746
03:24:12,349 --> 03:24:12,359
people would say well that I mean I I
 

9747
03:24:12,359 --> 03:24:14,630
people would say well that I mean I I
wrote about that in my my two science

9748
03:24:14,630 --> 03:24:14,640
wrote about that in my my two science
 

9749
03:24:14,640 --> 03:24:16,969
wrote about that in my my two science
fiction novels Genesis Code and Eternal

9750
03:24:16,969 --> 03:24:16,979

9751
03:24:16,979 --> 03:24:19,490

Sonata years ago especially with Genesis

9752
03:24:19,490 --> 03:24:19,500
Sonata years ago especially with Genesis
 

9753
03:24:19,500 --> 03:24:21,950
Sonata years ago especially with Genesis
Code I wrote about that and and as a

9754
03:24:21,950 --> 03:24:21,960
Code I wrote about that and and as a
 

9755
03:24:21,960 --> 03:24:24,590
Code I wrote about that and and as a
Sci-Fi and and I had actually testified

9756
03:24:24,590 --> 03:24:24,600
Sci-Fi and and I had actually testified
 

9757
03:24:24,600 --> 03:24:27,229
Sci-Fi and and I had actually testified
before Congress but now 15 years ago

9758
03:24:27,229 --> 03:24:27,239
before Congress but now 15 years ago
 

9759
03:24:27,239 --> 03:24:29,150
before Congress but now 15 years ago
saying here's what the future

9760
03:24:29,150 --> 03:24:29,160
saying here's what the future
 

9761
03:24:29,160 --> 03:24:30,590
saying here's what the future
looks like

9762
03:24:30,590 --> 03:24:30,600
looks like
 

9763
03:24:30,600 --> 03:24:33,769
looks like
um but even I and and in my first

9764
03:24:33,769 --> 03:24:33,779
um but even I and and in my first
 

9765
03:24:33,779 --> 03:24:36,590
um but even I and and in my first
edition of hacking Darwin

9766
03:24:36,590 --> 03:24:36,600
edition of hacking Darwin
 

9767
03:24:36,600 --> 03:24:38,510
edition of hacking Darwin
um uh when it was it was already in

9768
03:24:38,510 --> 03:24:38,520
um uh when it was it was already in
 

9769
03:24:38,520 --> 03:24:42,070
um uh when it was it was already in
production uh and then in November 2018

9770
03:24:42,070 --> 03:24:42,080
production uh and then in November 2018
 

9771
03:24:42,080 --> 03:24:45,650
production uh and then in November 2018
this scientist who John Quay announced

9772
03:24:45,650 --> 03:24:45,660
this scientist who John Quay announced
 

9773
03:24:45,660 --> 03:24:47,990
this scientist who John Quay announced
uh in Hong Kong

9774
03:24:47,990 --> 03:24:48,000
uh in Hong Kong
 

9775
03:24:48,000 --> 03:24:50,269
uh in Hong Kong
um that the world's first two

9776
03:24:50,269 --> 03:24:50,279
um that the world's first two
 

9777
03:24:50,279 --> 03:24:52,309
um that the world's first two
and later three crispr babies had been

9778
03:24:52,309 --> 03:24:52,319
and later three crispr babies had been
 

9779
03:24:52,319 --> 03:24:54,830
and later three crispr babies had been
born which he had genetically altered in

9780
03:24:54,830 --> 03:24:54,840
born which he had genetically altered in
 

9781
03:24:54,840 --> 03:24:56,690
born which he had genetically altered in
and misguided in my view and and

9782
03:24:56,690 --> 03:24:56,700
and misguided in my view and and
 

9783
03:24:56,700 --> 03:25:00,650
and misguided in my view and and
dangerous view a dangerous goal

9784
03:25:00,650 --> 03:25:00,660
dangerous view a dangerous goal
 

9785
03:25:00,660 --> 03:25:03,469
dangerous view a dangerous goal
um of making it so they would have

9786
03:25:03,469 --> 03:25:03,479
um of making it so they would have
 

9787
03:25:03,479 --> 03:25:07,429
um of making it so they would have
increased resistance to uh to HIV

9788
03:25:07,429 --> 03:25:07,439
increased resistance to uh to HIV
 

9789
03:25:07,439 --> 03:25:09,590
increased resistance to uh to HIV
and so I called my publisher

9790
03:25:09,590 --> 03:25:09,600
and so I called my publisher
 

9791
03:25:09,600 --> 03:25:11,990
and so I called my publisher
and I said I've got good news and bad

9792
03:25:11,990 --> 03:25:12,000
and I said I've got good news and bad
 

9793
03:25:12,000 --> 03:25:13,790
and I said I've got good news and bad
news I'll start with the bad news is

9794
03:25:13,790 --> 03:25:13,800
news I'll start with the bad news is
 

9795
03:25:13,800 --> 03:25:16,309
news I'll start with the bad news is
that the world's first crispr babies

9796
03:25:16,309 --> 03:25:16,319
that the world's first crispr babies
 

9797
03:25:16,319 --> 03:25:18,950
that the world's first crispr babies
have been born and so we need to pull my

9798
03:25:18,950 --> 03:25:18,960
have been born and so we need to pull my
 

9799
03:25:18,960 --> 03:25:22,190
have been born and so we need to pull my
book out of production because you can't

9800
03:25:22,190 --> 03:25:22,200
book out of production because you can't
 

9801
03:25:22,200 --> 03:25:24,170
book out of production because you can't
have a book on the future of human

9802
03:25:24,170 --> 03:25:24,180
have a book on the future of human
 

9803
03:25:24,180 --> 03:25:26,210
have a book on the future of human
genetic engineering and have it not

9804
03:25:26,210 --> 03:25:26,220
genetic engineering and have it not
 

9805
03:25:26,220 --> 03:25:28,190
genetic engineering and have it not
mentioned the first crispr babies that

9806
03:25:28,190 --> 03:25:28,200
mentioned the first crispr babies that
 

9807
03:25:28,200 --> 03:25:31,130
mentioned the first crispr babies that
have been born but the good news is in

9808
03:25:31,130 --> 03:25:31,140
have been born but the good news is in
 

9809
03:25:31,140 --> 03:25:33,950
have been born but the good news is in
the book I had predicted that it's going

9810
03:25:33,950 --> 03:25:33,960
the book I had predicted that it's going
 

9811
03:25:33,960 --> 03:25:35,750
the book I had predicted that it's going
to happen and it's going to happen in

9812
03:25:35,750 --> 03:25:35,760
to happen and it's going to happen in
 

9813
03:25:35,760 --> 03:25:39,050
to happen and it's going to happen in
China and here's why and all we need to

9814
03:25:39,050 --> 03:25:39,060
China and here's why and all we need to
 

9815
03:25:39,060 --> 03:25:42,590
China and here's why and all we need to
do is add a few more sentences and now

9816
03:25:42,590 --> 03:25:42,600
do is add a few more sentences and now
 

9817
03:25:42,600 --> 03:25:43,969
do is add a few more sentences and now
that was the hardback and then I updated

9818
03:25:43,969 --> 03:25:43,979
that was the hardback and then I updated
 

9819
03:25:43,979 --> 03:25:46,309
that was the hardback and then I updated
it more in the paperback saying and it

9820
03:25:46,309 --> 03:25:46,319
it more in the paperback saying and it
 

9821
03:25:46,319 --> 03:25:48,410
it more in the paperback saying and it
happened and it was announced on on this

9822
03:25:48,410 --> 03:25:48,420
happened and it was announced on on this
 

9823
03:25:48,420 --> 03:25:49,910
happened and it was announced on on this
diff yeah

9824
03:25:49,910 --> 03:25:49,920
diff yeah
 

9825
03:25:49,920 --> 03:25:52,849
diff yeah
well then let's fast forward

9826
03:25:52,849 --> 03:25:52,859
well then let's fast forward
 

9827
03:25:52,859 --> 03:25:55,190
well then let's fast forward
given your predictions are slowly

9828
03:25:55,190 --> 03:25:55,200
given your predictions are slowly
 

9829
03:25:55,200 --> 03:25:58,990
given your predictions are slowly
becoming reality

9830
03:25:58,990 --> 03:25:59,000

 

9831
03:25:59,000 --> 03:26:01,429

let's talk about some philosophy and

9832
03:26:01,429 --> 03:26:01,439
let's talk about some philosophy and
 

9833
03:26:01,439 --> 03:26:03,469
let's talk about some philosophy and
ethics I suppose

9834
03:26:03,469 --> 03:26:03,479
ethics I suppose
 

9835
03:26:03,479 --> 03:26:05,809
ethics I suppose
so I can I'm not being too

9836
03:26:05,809 --> 03:26:05,819
so I can I'm not being too
 

9837
03:26:05,819 --> 03:26:07,670
so I can I'm not being too
self-deprecating here

9838
03:26:07,670 --> 03:26:07,680
self-deprecating here
 

9839
03:26:07,680 --> 03:26:09,530
self-deprecating here
and saying if

9840
03:26:09,530 --> 03:26:09,540
and saying if
 

9841
03:26:09,540 --> 03:26:13,370
and saying if
um my parents had the choice

9842
03:26:13,370 --> 03:26:13,380
um my parents had the choice
 

9843
03:26:13,380 --> 03:26:16,849
um my parents had the choice
uh I I would be probably less likely to

9844
03:26:16,849 --> 03:26:16,859
uh I I would be probably less likely to
 

9845
03:26:16,859 --> 03:26:19,670
uh I I would be probably less likely to
come out the winner uh we're all weird

9846
03:26:19,670 --> 03:26:19,680
come out the winner uh we're all weird
 

9847
03:26:19,680 --> 03:26:22,250
come out the winner uh we're all weird
and I'm certainly a very

9848
03:26:22,250 --> 03:26:22,260
and I'm certainly a very
 

9849
03:26:22,260 --> 03:26:25,370
and I'm certainly a very
um distinctly weird specimen of the

9850
03:26:25,370 --> 03:26:25,380
um distinctly weird specimen of the
 

9851
03:26:25,380 --> 03:26:28,550
um distinctly weird specimen of the
human species I can give the full long

9852
03:26:28,550 --> 03:26:28,560
human species I can give the full long
 

9853
03:26:28,560 --> 03:26:31,670
human species I can give the full long
list of flaws and we can be very poetic

9854
03:26:31,670 --> 03:26:31,680
list of flaws and we can be very poetic
 

9855
03:26:31,680 --> 03:26:33,830
list of flaws and we can be very poetic
of saying like those are features and so

9856
03:26:33,830 --> 03:26:33,840
of saying like those are features and so
 

9857
03:26:33,840 --> 03:26:34,690
of saying like those are features and so
on

9858
03:26:34,690 --> 03:26:34,700
on
 

9859
03:26:34,700 --> 03:26:36,849
on
but they're not

9860
03:26:36,849 --> 03:26:36,859
but they're not
 

9861
03:26:36,859 --> 03:26:39,670
but they're not
if you look at the menu

9862
03:26:39,670 --> 03:26:39,680
if you look at the menu
 

9863
03:26:39,680 --> 03:26:42,410
if you look at the menu
again for for these uh women who are

9864
03:26:42,410 --> 03:26:42,420
again for for these uh women who are
 

9865
03:26:42,420 --> 03:26:44,330
again for for these uh women who are
listening apropos of your thing they're

9866
03:26:44,330 --> 03:26:44,340
listening apropos of your thing they're
 

9867
03:26:44,340 --> 03:26:47,630
listening apropos of your thing they're
all kind of charming individualities yes

9868
03:26:47,630 --> 03:26:47,640
all kind of charming individualities yes
 

9869
03:26:47,640 --> 03:26:49,849
all kind of charming individualities yes
it's beautiful that's one yes thank you

9870
03:26:49,849 --> 03:26:49,859
it's beautiful that's one yes thank you
 

9871
03:26:49,859 --> 03:26:52,550
it's beautiful that's one yes thank you
but anyway but on on the full sort of

9872
03:26:52,550 --> 03:26:52,560
but anyway but on on the full sort of
 

9873
03:26:52,560 --> 03:26:55,790
but anyway but on on the full sort of
individual let's say IQ alone right that

9874
03:26:55,790 --> 03:26:55,800
individual let's say IQ alone right that
 

9875
03:26:55,800 --> 03:26:57,830
individual let's say IQ alone right that
um

9876
03:26:57,830 --> 03:26:57,840
um
 

9877
03:26:57,840 --> 03:27:00,349
um
what do we what do we do

9878
03:27:00,349 --> 03:27:00,359
what do we what do we do
 

9879
03:27:00,359 --> 03:27:01,790
what do we what do we do
about

9880
03:27:01,790 --> 03:27:01,800
about
 

9881
03:27:01,800 --> 03:27:05,929
about
a world where

9882
03:27:05,929 --> 03:27:05,939

 

9883
03:27:05,939 --> 03:27:09,410

um IQ could be selected in a menu when

9884
03:27:09,410 --> 03:27:09,420
um IQ could be selected in a menu when
 

9885
03:27:09,420 --> 03:27:11,690
um IQ could be selected in a menu when
you're having children

9886
03:27:11,690 --> 03:27:11,700
you're having children
 

9887
03:27:11,700 --> 03:27:13,330
you're having children

foreign
 

9889
03:27:13,340 --> 03:27:16,250
foreign
what concerns you about that world what

9890
03:27:16,250 --> 03:27:16,260
what concerns you about that world what
 

9891
03:27:16,260 --> 03:27:19,150
what concerns you about that world what
excites you about that world

9892
03:27:19,150 --> 03:27:19,160
excites you about that world
 

9893
03:27:19,160 --> 03:27:21,889
excites you about that world
are there certain metrics

9894
03:27:21,889 --> 03:27:21,899
are there certain metrics
 

9895
03:27:21,899 --> 03:27:24,849
are there certain metrics
that excite you more than others

9896
03:27:24,849 --> 03:27:24,859
that excite you more than others
 

9897
03:27:24,859 --> 03:27:28,969
that excite you more than others
IQ has been a a source of

9898
03:27:28,969 --> 03:27:28,979
IQ has been a a source of
 

9899
03:27:28,979 --> 03:27:31,250
IQ has been a a source of
um

9900
03:27:31,250 --> 03:27:31,260

 

9901
03:27:31,260 --> 03:27:32,450

I don't know

9902
03:27:32,450 --> 03:27:32,460
I don't know
 

9903
03:27:32,460 --> 03:27:37,250
I don't know
I'm not sure IQ as a measure flawed as

9904
03:27:37,250 --> 03:27:37,260
I'm not sure IQ as a measure flawed as
 

9905
03:27:37,260 --> 03:27:38,210
I'm not sure IQ as a measure flawed as
it is

9906
03:27:38,210 --> 03:27:38,220
it is
 

9907
03:27:38,220 --> 03:27:41,750
it is
has been used to celebrate the successes

9908
03:27:41,750 --> 03:27:41,760
has been used to celebrate the successes
 

9909
03:27:41,760 --> 03:27:44,929
has been used to celebrate the successes
of the human species nearly as much as

9910
03:27:44,929 --> 03:27:44,939
of the human species nearly as much as
 

9911
03:27:44,939 --> 03:27:47,750
of the human species nearly as much as
has been used to divide people to say

9912
03:27:47,750 --> 03:27:47,760
has been used to divide people to say
 

9913
03:27:47,760 --> 03:27:50,929
has been used to divide people to say
negative things about people

9914
03:27:50,929 --> 03:27:50,939
negative things about people
 

9915
03:27:50,939 --> 03:27:51,530
negative things about people
um

9916
03:27:51,530 --> 03:27:51,540
um
 

9917
03:27:51,540 --> 03:27:54,410
um
to make negative claims about people and

9918
03:27:54,410 --> 03:27:54,420
to make negative claims about people and
 

9919
03:27:54,420 --> 03:27:57,349
to make negative claims about people and
in that same way it seems like when

9920
03:27:57,349 --> 03:27:57,359
in that same way it seems like when
 

9921
03:27:57,359 --> 03:27:59,690
in that same way it seems like when
there's a selection a genetic selection

9922
03:27:59,690 --> 03:27:59,700
there's a selection a genetic selection
 

9923
03:27:59,700 --> 03:28:03,110
there's a selection a genetic selection
based on IQ you can start now having

9924
03:28:03,110 --> 03:28:03,120
based on IQ you can start now having
 

9925
03:28:03,120 --> 03:28:06,590
based on IQ you can start now having
classes of citizenry and like further

9926
03:28:06,590 --> 03:28:06,600
classes of citizenry and like further
 

9927
03:28:06,600 --> 03:28:10,190
classes of citizenry and like further
divide you know the rich get richer you

9928
03:28:10,190 --> 03:28:10,200
divide you know the rich get richer you
 

9929
03:28:10,200 --> 03:28:12,410
divide you know the rich get richer you
know it'll be very rich people they'll

9930
03:28:12,410 --> 03:28:12,420
know it'll be very rich people they'll
 

9931
03:28:12,420 --> 03:28:15,830
know it'll be very rich people they'll
be able to do kind of uh fine selection

9932
03:28:15,830 --> 03:28:15,840
be able to do kind of uh fine selection
 

9933
03:28:15,840 --> 03:28:18,229
be able to do kind of uh fine selection
of IQ and then

9934
03:28:18,229 --> 03:28:18,239
of IQ and then
 

9935
03:28:18,239 --> 03:28:18,969
of IQ and then
um

9936
03:28:18,969 --> 03:28:18,979
um
 

9937
03:28:18,979 --> 03:28:21,710
um
they they will start forming these

9938
03:28:21,710 --> 03:28:21,720
they they will start forming these
 

9939
03:28:21,720 --> 03:28:24,349
they they will start forming these
classes of super intelligent people and

9940
03:28:24,349 --> 03:28:24,359
classes of super intelligent people and
 

9941
03:28:24,359 --> 03:28:26,150
classes of super intelligent people and
those super intelligent people in their

9942
03:28:26,150 --> 03:28:26,160
those super intelligent people in their
 

9943
03:28:26,160 --> 03:28:27,590
those super intelligent people in their
minds would of course be the right

9944
03:28:27,590 --> 03:28:27,600
minds would of course be the right
 

9945
03:28:27,600 --> 03:28:30,170
minds would of course be the right
people to be making Global authoritarian

9946
03:28:30,170 --> 03:28:30,180
people to be making Global authoritarian
 

9947
03:28:30,180 --> 03:28:31,849
people to be making Global authoritarian
decisions about everybody else all the

9948
03:28:31,849 --> 03:28:31,859
decisions about everybody else all the
 

9949
03:28:31,859 --> 03:28:34,429
decisions about everybody else all the
usual aspects of human nature but now

9950
03:28:34,429 --> 03:28:34,439
usual aspects of human nature but now
 

9951
03:28:34,439 --> 03:28:37,250
usual aspects of human nature but now
magnified with with the the new tools of

9952
03:28:37,250 --> 03:28:37,260
magnified with with the the new tools of
 

9953
03:28:37,260 --> 03:28:39,710
magnified with with the the new tools of
Technology anyway all that to say is

9954
03:28:39,710 --> 03:28:39,720
Technology anyway all that to say is
 

9955
03:28:39,720 --> 03:28:42,290
Technology anyway all that to say is
what's exciting to you

9956
03:28:42,290 --> 03:28:42,300
what's exciting to you
 

9957
03:28:42,300 --> 03:28:44,990
what's exciting to you
of what's concerning to you it's a it's

9958
03:28:44,990 --> 03:28:45,000
of what's concerning to you it's a it's
 

9959
03:28:45,000 --> 03:28:47,330
of what's concerning to you it's a it's
a great question and just stepping into

9960
03:28:47,330 --> 03:28:47,340
a great question and just stepping into
 

9961
03:28:47,340 --> 03:28:51,710
a great question and just stepping into
the the IQ we'll call it a quagmire for

9962
03:28:51,710 --> 03:28:51,720
the the IQ we'll call it a quagmire for
 

9963
03:28:51,720 --> 03:28:55,250
the the IQ we'll call it a quagmire for
now it raises a lot of big issues

9964
03:28:55,250 --> 03:28:55,260
now it raises a lot of big issues
 

9965
03:28:55,260 --> 03:28:57,229
now it raises a lot of big issues
um which are are complicated

9966
03:28:57,229 --> 03:28:57,239
um which are are complicated
 

9967
03:28:57,239 --> 03:29:00,309
um which are are complicated
um maybe you've listened to Sam Harris's

9968
03:29:00,309 --> 03:29:00,319
um maybe you've listened to Sam Harris's
 

9969
03:29:00,319 --> 03:29:03,650
um maybe you've listened to Sam Harris's
uh interview with Charles Murray and

9970
03:29:03,650 --> 03:29:03,660
uh interview with Charles Murray and
 

9971
03:29:03,660 --> 03:29:05,929
uh interview with Charles Murray and
then that that spawned a kind of a whole

9972
03:29:05,929 --> 03:29:05,939
then that that spawned a kind of a whole
 

9973
03:29:05,939 --> 03:29:08,469
then that that spawned a kind of a whole
industry of of

9974
03:29:08,469 --> 03:29:08,479
industry of of
 

9975
03:29:08,479 --> 03:29:12,050
industry of of
debate so first just the background of

9976
03:29:12,050 --> 03:29:12,060
debate so first just the background of
 

9977
03:29:12,060 --> 03:29:16,070
debate so first just the background of
of IQ and it's it's from the early 20th

9978
03:29:16,070 --> 03:29:16,080
of IQ and it's it's from the early 20th
 

9979
03:29:16,080 --> 03:29:18,410
of IQ and it's it's from the early 20th
century and there was the idea that we

9980
03:29:18,410 --> 03:29:18,420
century and there was the idea that we
 

9981
03:29:18,420 --> 03:29:20,510
century and there was the idea that we
can measure people's general

9982
03:29:20,510 --> 03:29:20,520
can measure people's general
 

9983
03:29:20,520 --> 03:29:22,250
can measure people's general
intelligence and and there are so many

9984
03:29:22,250 --> 03:29:22,260
intelligence and and there are so many
 

9985
03:29:22,260 --> 03:29:24,290
intelligence and and there are so many
different kinds of intelligence this was

9986
03:29:24,290 --> 03:29:24,300
different kinds of intelligence this was
 

9987
03:29:24,300 --> 03:29:26,750
different kinds of intelligence this was
measuring a specific thing so it's my

9988
03:29:26,750 --> 03:29:26,760
measuring a specific thing so it's my
 

9989
03:29:26,760 --> 03:29:29,990
measuring a specific thing so it's my
feeling is that IQ doesn't is not a

9990
03:29:29,990 --> 03:29:30,000
feeling is that IQ doesn't is not a
 

9991
03:29:30,000 --> 03:29:32,030
feeling is that IQ doesn't is not a
perfect measure of intelligence but it's

9992
03:29:32,030 --> 03:29:32,040
perfect measure of intelligence but it's
 

9993
03:29:32,040 --> 03:29:33,830
perfect measure of intelligence but it's
a perfect measure of IQ like it's

9994
03:29:33,830 --> 03:29:33,840
a perfect measure of IQ like it's
 

9995
03:29:33,840 --> 03:29:35,210
a perfect measure of IQ like it's
measuring what it's what it's measuring

9996
03:29:35,210 --> 03:29:35,220
measuring what it's what it's measuring
 

9997
03:29:35,220 --> 03:29:39,530
measuring what it's what it's measuring
but that thing is correlates to a lot of

9998
03:29:39,530 --> 03:29:39,540
but that thing is correlates to a lot of
 

9999
03:29:39,540 --> 03:29:43,010
but that thing is correlates to a lot of
of things which are rewarded in our

10000
03:29:43,010 --> 03:29:43,020
of things which are rewarded in our
 

10001
03:29:43,020 --> 03:29:46,849
of things which are rewarded in our
society so the the every study of IQ has

10002
03:29:46,849 --> 03:29:46,859
society so the the every study of IQ has
 

10003
03:29:46,859 --> 03:29:49,969
society so the the every study of IQ has
shown that people with higher IQs they

10004
03:29:49,969 --> 03:29:49,979
shown that people with higher IQs they
 

10005
03:29:49,979 --> 03:29:52,490
shown that people with higher IQs they
make more money they live longer they

10006
03:29:52,490 --> 03:29:52,500
make more money they live longer they
 

10007
03:29:52,500 --> 03:29:54,229
make more money they live longer they
have more stable relationships I mean

10008
03:29:54,229 --> 03:29:54,239
have more stable relationships I mean
 

10009
03:29:54,239 --> 03:29:56,030
have more stable relationships I mean
that that could be something in the in

10010
03:29:56,030 --> 03:29:56,040
that that could be something in the in
 

10011
03:29:56,040 --> 03:29:58,610
that that could be something in the in
the testing but as Sam Harris has has

10012
03:29:58,610 --> 03:29:58,620
the testing but as Sam Harris has has
 

10013
03:29:58,620 --> 03:30:01,729
the testing but as Sam Harris has has
talked about a lot you could line up all

10014
03:30:01,729 --> 03:30:01,739
talked about a lot you could line up all
 

10015
03:30:01,739 --> 03:30:04,370
talked about a lot you could line up all
of the all of these kind of IQ and IQ

10016
03:30:04,370 --> 03:30:04,380
of the all of these kind of IQ and IQ
 

10017
03:30:04,380 --> 03:30:07,490
of the all of these kind of IQ and IQ
like tests correlate with each other so

10018
03:30:07,490 --> 03:30:07,500
like tests correlate with each other so
 

10019
03:30:07,500 --> 03:30:09,530
like tests correlate with each other so
the people who score high on one score

10020
03:30:09,530 --> 03:30:09,540
the people who score high on one score
 

10021
03:30:09,540 --> 03:30:11,510
the people who score high on one score
high on all of them and and people think

10022
03:30:11,510 --> 03:30:11,520
high on all of them and and people think
 

10023
03:30:11,520 --> 03:30:13,670
high on all of them and and people think
that IQ tests are like

10024
03:30:13,670 --> 03:30:13,680
that IQ tests are like
 

10025
03:30:13,680 --> 03:30:16,429
that IQ tests are like
um a you know a thing like you know the

10026
03:30:16,429 --> 03:30:16,439
um a you know a thing like you know the
 

10027
03:30:16,439 --> 03:30:18,650
um a you know a thing like you know the
Earl of Dorchester is coming for dinner

10028
03:30:18,650 --> 03:30:18,660
Earl of Dorchester is coming for dinner
 

10029
03:30:18,660 --> 03:30:21,590
Earl of Dorchester is coming for dinner
does he have two forks or Three Forks or

10030
03:30:21,590 --> 03:30:21,600
does he have two forks or Three Forks or
 

10031
03:30:21,600 --> 03:30:23,510
does he have two forks or Three Forks or
something like that it's it's not that a

10032
03:30:23,510 --> 03:30:23,520
something like that it's it's not that a
 

10033
03:30:23,520 --> 03:30:25,969
something like that it's it's not that a
lot of them are are things that that I

10034
03:30:25,969 --> 03:30:25,979
lot of them are are things that that I
 

10035
03:30:25,979 --> 03:30:27,469
lot of them are are things that that I
think a lot of us would recognize are

10036
03:30:27,469 --> 03:30:27,479
think a lot of us would recognize are
 

10037
03:30:27,479 --> 03:30:29,630
think a lot of us would recognize are
relevant just like how much stuff can

10038
03:30:29,630 --> 03:30:29,640
relevant just like how much stuff can
 

10039
03:30:29,640 --> 03:30:32,389
relevant just like how much stuff can
you memorize if you see some shapes how

10040
03:30:32,389 --> 03:30:32,399
you memorize if you see some shapes how
 

10041
03:30:32,399 --> 03:30:35,030
you memorize if you see some shapes how
can you position them and and things

10042
03:30:35,030 --> 03:30:35,040
can you position them and and things
 

10043
03:30:35,040 --> 03:30:37,969
can you position them and and things
like that and so IQ I mean it really hit

10044
03:30:37,969 --> 03:30:37,979
like that and so IQ I mean it really hit
 

10045
03:30:37,979 --> 03:30:39,950
like that and so IQ I mean it really hit
its stride in certainly in the second

10046
03:30:39,950 --> 03:30:39,960
its stride in certainly in the second
 

10047
03:30:39,960 --> 03:30:41,990
its stride in certainly in the second
world war when we were just our

10048
03:30:41,990 --> 03:30:42,000
world war when we were just our
 

10049
03:30:42,000 --> 03:30:43,429
world war when we were just our
governments were processing a lot of

10050
03:30:43,429 --> 03:30:43,439
governments were processing a lot of
 

10051
03:30:43,439 --> 03:30:44,809
governments were processing a lot of
people and trying to figure out who to

10052
03:30:44,809 --> 03:30:44,819
people and trying to figure out who to
 

10053
03:30:44,819 --> 03:30:47,870
people and trying to figure out who to
put in what in what in what job so

10054
03:30:47,870 --> 03:30:47,880
put in what in what in what job so
 

10055
03:30:47,880 --> 03:30:49,910
put in what in what in what job so
that's the starting point let me start

10056
03:30:49,910 --> 03:30:49,920
that's the starting point let me start
 

10057
03:30:49,920 --> 03:30:52,490
that's the starting point let me start
first with the negatives

10058
03:30:52,490 --> 03:30:52,500
first with the negatives
 

10059
03:30:52,500 --> 03:30:55,490
first with the negatives
um that our societies that when we talk

10060
03:30:55,490 --> 03:30:55,500
um that our societies that when we talk
 

10061
03:30:55,500 --> 03:30:58,490
um that our societies that when we talk
about diversity in Dar darwinian terms

10062
03:30:58,490 --> 03:30:58,500
about diversity in Dar darwinian terms
 

10063
03:30:58,500 --> 03:31:01,250
about diversity in Dar darwinian terms
it's not like diversity is from

10064
03:31:01,250 --> 03:31:01,260
it's not like diversity is from
 

10065
03:31:01,260 --> 03:31:03,170
it's not like diversity is from
darwinian terms oh wouldn't it be nice

10066
03:31:03,170 --> 03:31:03,180
darwinian terms oh wouldn't it be nice
 

10067
03:31:03,180 --> 03:31:06,170
darwinian terms oh wouldn't it be nice
if we have you know some moths of

10068
03:31:06,170 --> 03:31:06,180
if we have you know some moths of
 

10069
03:31:06,180 --> 03:31:08,090
if we have you know some moths of
different colors because it'll be really

10070
03:31:08,090 --> 03:31:08,100
different colors because it'll be really
 

10071
03:31:08,100 --> 03:31:10,130
different colors because it'll be really
fun to have different colored moths

10072
03:31:10,130 --> 03:31:10,140
fun to have different colored moths
 

10073
03:31:10,140 --> 03:31:13,429
fun to have different colored moths
diversity is the sole survival strategy

10074
03:31:13,429 --> 03:31:13,439
diversity is the sole survival strategy
 

10075
03:31:13,439 --> 03:31:16,190
diversity is the sole survival strategy
of our species and of every species and

10076
03:31:16,190 --> 03:31:16,200
of our species and of every species and
 

10077
03:31:16,200 --> 03:31:19,490
of our species and of every species and
it's and and it's impossible to predict

10078
03:31:19,490 --> 03:31:19,500
it's and and it's impossible to predict
 

10079
03:31:19,500 --> 03:31:22,010
it's and and it's impossible to predict
um which what diversity is going to be

10080
03:31:22,010 --> 03:31:22,020
um which what diversity is going to be
 

10081
03:31:22,020 --> 03:31:24,590
um which what diversity is going to be
rewarded and I've said this before if

10082
03:31:24,590 --> 03:31:24,600
rewarded and I've said this before if
 

10083
03:31:24,600 --> 03:31:26,630
rewarded and I've said this before if
you went down and you had if you spoke

10084
03:31:26,630 --> 03:31:26,640
you went down and you had if you spoke
 

10085
03:31:26,640 --> 03:31:29,690
you went down and you had if you spoke
T-Rex and you spoke to the dinosaurs and

10086
03:31:29,690 --> 03:31:29,700
T-Rex and you spoke to the dinosaurs and
 

10087
03:31:29,700 --> 03:31:31,910
T-Rex and you spoke to the dinosaurs and
said hey you can select your kids

10088
03:31:31,910 --> 03:31:31,920
said hey you can select your kids
 

10089
03:31:31,920 --> 03:31:33,710
said hey you can select your kids
um what criteria do you want and they

10090
03:31:33,710 --> 03:31:33,720
um what criteria do you want and they
 

10091
03:31:33,720 --> 03:31:36,710
um what criteria do you want and they
say oh yeah yeah sharp teeth cruel

10092
03:31:36,710 --> 03:31:36,720
say oh yeah yeah sharp teeth cruel
 

10093
03:31:36,720 --> 03:31:39,889
say oh yeah yeah sharp teeth cruel
things Roar whatever it is that makes

10094
03:31:39,889 --> 03:31:39,899
things Roar whatever it is that makes
 

10095
03:31:39,899 --> 03:31:42,050
things Roar whatever it is that makes
you a great T-Rex

10096
03:31:42,050 --> 03:31:42,060
you a great T-Rex
 

10097
03:31:42,060 --> 03:31:45,050
you a great T-Rex
um but the answer from from an

10098
03:31:45,050 --> 03:31:45,060
um but the answer from from an
 

10099
03:31:45,060 --> 03:31:46,729
um but the answer from from an
evolutionary perspective from an earth

10100
03:31:46,729 --> 03:31:46,739
evolutionary perspective from an earth
 

10101
03:31:46,739 --> 03:31:48,530
evolutionary perspective from an earth
perspective was always much better to be

10102
03:31:48,530 --> 03:31:48,540
perspective was always much better to be
 

10103
03:31:48,540 --> 03:31:51,410
perspective was always much better to be
like a cockroach or an alligator or some

10104
03:31:51,410 --> 03:31:51,420
like a cockroach or an alligator or some
 

10105
03:31:51,420 --> 03:31:54,590
like a cockroach or an alligator or some
little nothing or a little shrew

10106
03:31:54,590 --> 03:31:54,600
little nothing or a little shrew
 

10107
03:31:54,600 --> 03:31:56,750
little nothing or a little shrew
um because the dinosaurs are going to

10108
03:31:56,750 --> 03:31:56,760
um because the dinosaurs are going to
 

10109
03:31:56,760 --> 03:31:59,150
um because the dinosaurs are going to
get wiped out when the asteroid hits and

10110
03:31:59,150 --> 03:31:59,160
get wiped out when the asteroid hits and
 

10111
03:31:59,160 --> 03:32:01,370
get wiped out when the asteroid hits and
so there's no better or worse in

10112
03:32:01,370 --> 03:32:01,380
so there's no better or worse in
 

10113
03:32:01,380 --> 03:32:04,010
so there's no better or worse in
evolution there's just better or worse

10114
03:32:04,010 --> 03:32:04,020
evolution there's just better or worse
 

10115
03:32:04,020 --> 03:32:06,110
evolution there's just better or worse
suited for a given environment and when

10116
03:32:06,110 --> 03:32:06,120
suited for a given environment and when
 

10117
03:32:06,120 --> 03:32:08,870
suited for a given environment and when
that environment changes the best suited

10118
03:32:08,870 --> 03:32:08,880
that environment changes the best suited
 

10119
03:32:08,880 --> 03:32:12,349
that environment changes the best suited
person from the old system could be the

10120
03:32:12,349 --> 03:32:12,359
person from the old system could be the
 

10121
03:32:12,359 --> 03:32:14,389
person from the old system could be the
worst suited person for the new one so

10122
03:32:14,389 --> 03:32:14,399
worst suited person for the new one so
 

10123
03:32:14,399 --> 03:32:17,090
worst suited person for the new one so
if we start selecting for the things

10124
03:32:17,090 --> 03:32:17,100
if we start selecting for the things
 

10125
03:32:17,100 --> 03:32:20,090
if we start selecting for the things
that we value the most including things

10126
03:32:20,090 --> 03:32:20,100
that we value the most including things
 

10127
03:32:20,100 --> 03:32:24,650
that we value the most including things
like IQ but even disease resistance I

10128
03:32:24,650 --> 03:32:24,660
like IQ but even disease resistance I
 

10129
03:32:24,660 --> 03:32:27,410
like IQ but even disease resistance I
mean this is well known but if you um

10130
03:32:27,410 --> 03:32:27,420
mean this is well known but if you um
 

10131
03:32:27,420 --> 03:32:30,950
mean this is well known but if you um
people who are recessive carrier of of

10132
03:32:30,950 --> 03:32:30,960
people who are recessive carrier of of
 

10133
03:32:30,960 --> 03:32:33,050
people who are recessive carrier of of
sickle cell disease have increased

10134
03:32:33,050 --> 03:32:33,060
sickle cell disease have increased
 

10135
03:32:33,060 --> 03:32:34,910
sickle cell disease have increased
resistance to malaria which is the

10136
03:32:34,910 --> 03:32:34,920
resistance to malaria which is the
 

10137
03:32:34,920 --> 03:32:37,790
resistance to malaria which is the
biggest reason why that that trait has

10138
03:32:37,790 --> 03:32:37,800
biggest reason why that that trait has
 

10139
03:32:37,800 --> 03:32:41,389
biggest reason why that that trait has
hasn't just disappeared given how deadly

10140
03:32:41,389 --> 03:32:41,399
hasn't just disappeared given how deadly
 

10141
03:32:41,399 --> 03:32:43,429
hasn't just disappeared given how deadly
sickle cell disease is

10142
03:32:43,429 --> 03:32:43,439
sickle cell disease is
 

10143
03:32:43,439 --> 03:32:46,670
sickle cell disease is
the biology is incredibly complex we

10144
03:32:46,670 --> 03:32:46,680
the biology is incredibly complex we
 

10145
03:32:46,680 --> 03:32:49,429
the biology is incredibly complex we
understand such a tiny percentage of it

10146
03:32:49,429 --> 03:32:49,439
understand such a tiny percentage of it
 

10147
03:32:49,439 --> 03:32:51,349
understand such a tiny percentage of it
that we need to have in your words just

10148
03:32:51,349 --> 03:32:51,359
that we need to have in your words just
 

10149
03:32:51,359 --> 03:32:54,530
that we need to have in your words just
a level of of humility there are huge

10150
03:32:54,530 --> 03:32:54,540
a level of of humility there are huge
 

10151
03:32:54,540 --> 03:32:56,570
a level of of humility there are huge
Equity issues as you've articulated

10152
03:32:56,570 --> 03:32:56,580
Equity issues as you've articulated
 

10153
03:32:56,580 --> 03:32:58,790
Equity issues as you've articulated
let's just say that it I mean it is the

10154
03:32:58,790 --> 03:32:58,800
let's just say that it I mean it is the
 

10155
03:32:58,800 --> 03:33:02,030
let's just say that it I mean it is the
case that in our society IQ and IQ like

10156
03:33:02,030 --> 03:33:02,040
case that in our society IQ and IQ like
 

10157
03:33:02,040 --> 03:33:05,750
case that in our society IQ and IQ like
traits are highly rewarded there isn't

10158
03:33:05,750 --> 03:33:05,760
traits are highly rewarded there isn't
 

10159
03:33:05,760 --> 03:33:07,429
traits are highly rewarded there isn't
an equity issue but it works in both

10160
03:33:07,429 --> 03:33:07,439
an equity issue but it works in both
 

10161
03:33:07,439 --> 03:33:09,950
an equity issue but it works in both
ways because my guess is let's just say

10162
03:33:09,950 --> 03:33:09,960
ways because my guess is let's just say
 

10163
03:33:09,960 --> 03:33:11,870
ways because my guess is let's just say
that we had a society where we were

10164
03:33:11,870 --> 03:33:11,880
that we had a society where we were
 

10165
03:33:11,880 --> 03:33:14,750
that we had a society where we were
doing genome sequencing of everybody who

10166
03:33:14,750 --> 03:33:14,760
doing genome sequencing of everybody who
 

10167
03:33:14,760 --> 03:33:16,790
doing genome sequencing of everybody who
was born and we had some predictive

10168
03:33:16,790 --> 03:33:16,800
was born and we had some predictive
 

10169
03:33:16,800 --> 03:33:19,910
was born and we had some predictive
model to predict IQ and we had decided

10170
03:33:19,910 --> 03:33:19,920
model to predict IQ and we had decided
 

10171
03:33:19,920 --> 03:33:23,269
model to predict IQ and we had decided
as a society that IQ was going to be

10172
03:33:23,269 --> 03:33:23,279
as a society that IQ was going to be
 

10173
03:33:23,279 --> 03:33:24,650
as a society that IQ was going to be
what we were going to select for we were

10174
03:33:24,650 --> 03:33:24,660
what we were going to select for we were
 

10175
03:33:24,660 --> 03:33:26,690
what we were going to select for we were
going to put the highest IQ people in

10176
03:33:26,690 --> 03:33:26,700
going to put the highest IQ people in
 

10177
03:33:26,700 --> 03:33:29,510
going to put the highest IQ people in
these these different roles I guarantee

10178
03:33:29,510 --> 03:33:29,520
these these different roles I guarantee
 

10179
03:33:29,520 --> 03:33:31,370
these these different roles I guarantee

admissions to Harvard they would very

admissions to Harvard they would very
 

10185
03:33:37,140 --> 03:33:40,729

are just wasting away because we've

10192
03:33:47,330 --> 03:33:47,340
are just wasting away because we've

I I totally get that
 

10225
03:34:29,580 --> 03:34:32,269
I I totally get that
having said that

a new way of procreating
 

10231
03:34:38,160 --> 03:34:40,190
a new way of procreating
and we're going to have to decide what

10232
03:34:40,190 --> 03:34:40,200
and we're going to have to decide what
 

10233
03:34:40,200 --> 03:34:43,610
and we're going to have to decide what
are the values that we would like to uh

10234
03:34:43,610 --> 03:34:43,620
are the values that we would like to uh
 

10235
03:34:43,620 --> 03:34:45,710
are the values that we would like to uh
to realize through that process is it

10236
03:34:45,710 --> 03:34:45,720
to realize through that process is it
 

10237
03:34:45,720 --> 03:34:47,809
to realize through that process is it
Randomness which is what we currently

10238
03:34:47,809 --> 03:34:47,819
Randomness which is what we currently
 

10239
03:34:47,819 --> 03:34:49,729
Randomness which is what we currently
have now which is not totally random

10240
03:34:49,729 --> 03:34:49,739
have now which is not totally random
 

10241
03:34:49,739 --> 03:34:51,469
have now which is not totally random
because we have a sort of mating through

and your wife also goes to Harvard it's
 

10249
03:35:03,960 --> 03:35:07,490
and your wife also goes to Harvard it's
like it's this location based uh meeting

10250
03:35:07,490 --> 03:35:07,500
like it's this location based uh meeting
 

10251
03:35:07,500 --> 03:35:09,530
like it's this location based uh meeting
well it's not location it's selection

10252
03:35:09,530 --> 03:35:09,540
well it's not location it's selection
 

10253
03:35:09,540 --> 03:35:11,570
well it's not location it's selection
it's like there are selections that are

10254
03:35:11,570 --> 03:35:11,580
it's like there are selections that are
 

10255
03:35:11,580 --> 03:35:13,969
it's like there are selections that are
made about who gets to a certain place

made about who gets to a certain place
 

10257
03:35:13,979 --> 03:35:15,710
made about who gets to a certain place
and when like it's like Harvard

admissions is a filter so so we're going

03:35:18,110 --> 03:35:18,120
admissions is a filter so so we're going
 

10261
03:35:18,120 --> 03:35:19,610
admissions is a filter so so we're going
to have to decide what are the values

10262
03:35:19,610 --> 03:35:19,620
to have to decide what are the values
 

10263
03:35:19,620 --> 03:35:21,110
to have to decide what are the values
that we want to realize through this

10264
03:35:21,110 --> 03:35:21,120
that we want to realize through this
 

10265
03:35:21,120 --> 03:35:23,630
that we want to realize through this
process because diversity has it's just

03:35:23,630 --> 03:35:23,640
process because diversity has it's just

baked into our biology we're the first

10268
03:35:25,550 --> 03:35:25,560
baked into our biology we're the first
 

10269
03:35:25,560 --> 03:35:28,670
baked into our biology we're the first
species ever that has the opportunity to

03:35:28,670 --> 03:35:28,680
species ever that has the opportunity to

03:35:28,680 --> 03:35:31,729
species ever that has the opportunity to
make choices about things that were

03:35:31,729 --> 03:35:31,739
make choices about things that were
 

10273
03:35:31,739 --> 03:35:34,010
make choices about things that were
otherwise baked into our biology and

10274
03:35:34,010 --> 03:35:34,020
otherwise baked into our biology and
 

10275
03:35:34,020 --> 03:35:36,710
otherwise baked into our biology and
there's a real danger that if we make

10276
03:35:36,710 --> 03:35:36,720
there's a real danger that if we make
 

10277
03:35:36,720 --> 03:35:39,889
there's a real danger that if we make
bad choices even with good intentions it

10278
03:35:39,889 --> 03:35:39,899
bad choices even with good intentions it
 

10279
03:35:39,899 --> 03:35:42,349
bad choices even with good intentions it
could even drive us toward Extinction

10280
03:35:42,349 --> 03:35:42,359
could even drive us toward Extinction
 

10281
03:35:42,359 --> 03:35:45,170
could even drive us toward Extinction
and certainly undermine our our humanity

10282
03:35:45,170 --> 03:35:45,180
and certainly undermine our our humanity
 

10283
03:35:45,180 --> 03:35:47,150
and certainly undermine our our humanity
and that's why I always say and like I

10284
03:35:47,150 --> 03:35:47,160
and that's why I always say and like I
 

10285
03:35:47,160 --> 03:35:49,010
and that's why I always say and like I
said I'm deeply involved with who and

conversations about science there are

10290
03:35:53,450 --> 03:35:53,460
conversations about science there are

03:35:59,210 --> 03:35:59,220
about values and ethics as you described
 

10297
03:35:59,220 --> 03:36:02,150
about values and ethics as you described
that world is wide open it's not even uh

that world is wide open it's not even uh
 

10299
03:36:02,160 --> 03:36:05,690
that world is wide open it's not even uh
a subtly different world that world is

a subtly different world that world is
 

10301
03:36:05,700 --> 03:36:07,550
a subtly different world that world is

um natural selection this random process
 

10309
03:36:14,939 --> 03:36:17,090
um natural selection this random process
is so fundamental how we think about

03:36:17,090 --> 03:36:17,100
is so fundamental how we think about

03:36:17,100 --> 03:36:18,530
is so fundamental how we think about

being able to program I mean it has the

I mean it'll probably make my question
 

10319
03:36:25,680 --> 03:36:28,910
I mean it'll probably make my question
about the ethical concerns around IQ

03:36:46,969 --> 03:36:46,979
different characteristics that make us
 

10335
03:36:46,979 --> 03:36:48,469
different characteristics that make us
who we are

10336
03:36:48,469 --> 03:36:48,479
who we are
 

10337
03:36:48,479 --> 03:36:50,330
who we are
whenever you have some control over

10338
03:36:50,330 --> 03:36:50,340
whenever you have some control over
 

10339
03:36:50,340 --> 03:36:52,370
whenever you have some control over
those characteristics those

10340
03:36:52,370 --> 03:36:52,380
those characteristics those
 

10341
03:36:52,380 --> 03:36:55,010
those characteristics those
characteristics start losing meaning

10342
03:36:55,010 --> 03:36:55,020
characteristics start losing meaning
 

10343
03:36:55,020 --> 03:36:58,010
characteristics start losing meaning
and what may start gaining meaning is

10344
03:36:58,010 --> 03:36:58,020
and what may start gaining meaning is
 

10345
03:36:58,020 --> 03:37:00,050
and what may start gaining meaning is
the ideas inside our heads for example

10346
03:37:00,050 --> 03:37:00,060
the ideas inside our heads for example
 

10347
03:37:00,060 --> 03:37:06,229
the ideas inside our heads for example
versus like the the details of like is

10348
03:37:06,229 --> 03:37:06,239
versus like the the details of like is
 

10349
03:37:06,239 --> 03:37:10,550
versus like the the details of like is
it a Commodore 64 is it a PC is it a Mac

10350
03:37:10,550 --> 03:37:10,560
it a Commodore 64 is it a PC is it a Mac
 

10351
03:37:10,560 --> 03:37:12,410
it a Commodore 64 is it a PC is it a Mac
it's going to be less important than the

10352
03:37:12,410 --> 03:37:12,420
it's going to be less important than the
 

10353
03:37:12,420 --> 03:37:15,290
it's going to be less important than the
software that runs on it so we can more

10354
03:37:15,290 --> 03:37:15,300
software that runs on it so we can more
 

10355
03:37:15,300 --> 03:37:16,790
software that runs on it so we can more
and more be operating in the digital

10356
03:37:16,790 --> 03:37:16,800
and more be operating in the digital
 

10357
03:37:16,800 --> 03:37:18,290
and more be operating in the digital
space and the identity could be

10358
03:37:18,290 --> 03:37:18,300
space and the identity could be
 

10359
03:37:18,300 --> 03:37:19,969
space and the identity could be
something that borrows multiple bodies

10360
03:37:19,969 --> 03:37:19,979
something that borrows multiple bodies
 

10361
03:37:19,979 --> 03:37:23,809
something that borrows multiple bodies
like it the the legacy of our ideas may

10362
03:37:23,809 --> 03:37:23,819
like it the the legacy of our ideas may
 

10363
03:37:23,819 --> 03:37:25,729
like it the the legacy of our ideas may
become more important than the details

10364
03:37:25,729 --> 03:37:25,739
become more important than the details
 

10365
03:37:25,739 --> 03:37:29,389
become more important than the details
of our physical embodiment like it I

10366
03:37:29,389 --> 03:37:29,399
of our physical embodiment like it I
 

10367
03:37:29,399 --> 03:37:31,130
of our physical embodiment like it I
mean I'm saying perhaps ridiculous

10368
03:37:31,130 --> 03:37:31,140
mean I'm saying perhaps ridiculous
 

10369
03:37:31,140 --> 03:37:34,010
mean I'm saying perhaps ridiculous
sounding things but they the point is it

10370
03:37:34,010 --> 03:37:34,020
sounding things but they the point is it
 

10371
03:37:34,020 --> 03:37:36,769
sounding things but they the point is it
will bring up so many new ethical

10372
03:37:36,769 --> 03:37:36,779
will bring up so many new ethical
 

10373
03:37:36,779 --> 03:37:39,950
will bring up so many new ethical
concerns that are narrow-minded thinking

10374
03:37:39,950 --> 03:37:39,960
concerns that are narrow-minded thinking
 

10375
03:37:39,960 --> 03:37:42,530
concerns that are narrow-minded thinking
about the current ethical concerns will

10376
03:37:42,530 --> 03:37:42,540
about the current ethical concerns will
 

10377
03:37:42,540 --> 03:37:45,590
about the current ethical concerns will
not apply so it's uh but it's important

10378
03:37:45,590 --> 03:37:45,600
not apply so it's uh but it's important
 

10379
03:37:45,600 --> 03:37:47,210
not apply so it's uh but it's important
to think about all this kind of stuff

10380
03:37:47,210 --> 03:37:47,220
to think about all this kind of stuff
 

10381
03:37:47,220 --> 03:37:48,950
to think about all this kind of stuff
like actively

10382
03:37:48,950 --> 03:37:48,960
like actively
 

10383
03:37:48,960 --> 03:37:51,110
like actively
what are the right conversations to be

10384
03:37:51,110 --> 03:37:51,120
what are the right conversations to be
 

10385
03:37:51,120 --> 03:37:54,110
what are the right conversations to be
having now because it feels like it's um

10386
03:37:54,110 --> 03:37:54,120
having now because it feels like it's um
 

10387
03:37:54,120 --> 03:37:56,510
having now because it feels like it's um
it's an ongoing conversation then

10388
03:37:56,510 --> 03:37:56,520
it's an ongoing conversation then
 

10389
03:37:56,520 --> 03:37:59,330
it's an ongoing conversation then
continually evolves like with an NIH

10390
03:37:59,330 --> 03:37:59,340
continually evolves like with an NIH
 

10391
03:37:59,340 --> 03:38:02,389
continually evolves like with an NIH
involved like do you do experiments

10392
03:38:02,389 --> 03:38:02,399
involved like do you do experiments
 

10393
03:38:02,399 --> 03:38:05,450
involved like do you do experiments
with animals do you build these brain

10394
03:38:05,450 --> 03:38:05,460
with animals do you build these brain
 

10395
03:38:05,460 --> 03:38:07,309
with animals do you build these brain
organoids do you still like through that

10396
03:38:07,309 --> 03:38:07,319
organoids do you still like through that
 

10397
03:38:07,319 --> 03:38:09,110
organoids do you still like through that
process you describe but the stem cells

10398
03:38:09,110 --> 03:38:09,120
process you describe but the stem cells
 

10399
03:38:09,120 --> 03:38:11,210
process you describe but the stem cells
like do you experiment with a bunch of

10400
03:38:11,210 --> 03:38:11,220
like do you experiment with a bunch of
 

10401
03:38:11,220 --> 03:38:15,889
like do you experiment with a bunch of
organisms to see how genetic uh material

10402
03:38:15,889 --> 03:38:15,899
organisms to see how genetic uh material
 

10403
03:38:15,899 --> 03:38:18,050
organisms to see how genetic uh material
what uh what form that actually takes

10404
03:38:18,050 --> 03:38:18,060
what uh what form that actually takes
 

10405
03:38:18,060 --> 03:38:19,790
what uh what form that actually takes
how to minimize the chance of cancer and

10406
03:38:19,790 --> 03:38:19,800
how to minimize the chance of cancer and
 

10407
03:38:19,800 --> 03:38:21,050
how to minimize the chance of cancer and
all those kinds of things what are the

10408
03:38:21,050 --> 03:38:21,060
all those kinds of things what are the
 

10409
03:38:21,060 --> 03:38:23,090
all those kinds of things what are the
negative consequences of that what are

10410
03:38:23,090 --> 03:38:23,100
negative consequences of that what are
 

10411
03:38:23,100 --> 03:38:25,910
negative consequences of that what are
the positive consequences yeah it's a

10412
03:38:25,910 --> 03:38:25,920
the positive consequences yeah it's a
 

10413
03:38:25,920 --> 03:38:27,410
the positive consequences yeah it's a
fascinating world it's a really

10414
03:38:27,410 --> 03:38:27,420
fascinating world it's a really
 

10415
03:38:27,420 --> 03:38:29,030
fascinating world it's a really
fascinating world yeah and then but

10416
03:38:29,030 --> 03:38:29,040
fascinating world yeah and then but
 

10417
03:38:29,040 --> 03:38:31,070
fascinating world yeah and then but
those conversations are just so

10418
03:38:31,070 --> 03:38:31,080
those conversations are just so
 

10419
03:38:31,080 --> 03:38:33,229
those conversations are just so
essential like we have to be talking

10420
03:38:33,229 --> 03:38:33,239
essential like we have to be talking
 

10421
03:38:33,239 --> 03:38:35,389
essential like we have to be talking
about ethics and then that raises the

10422
03:38:35,389 --> 03:38:35,399
about ethics and then that raises the
 

10423
03:38:35,399 --> 03:38:37,910
about ethics and then that raises the
question of who is the we and coming

10424
03:38:37,910 --> 03:38:37,920
question of who is the we and coming
 

10425
03:38:37,920 --> 03:38:39,950
question of who is the we and coming
back to to your conversation about

10426
03:38:39,950 --> 03:38:39,960
back to to your conversation about
 

10427
03:38:39,960 --> 03:38:43,189
back to to your conversation about
science communication maybe there was a

10428
03:38:43,189 --> 03:38:43,199
science communication maybe there was a
 

10429
03:38:43,199 --> 03:38:45,170
science communication maybe there was a
time earlier when these conversations

10430
03:38:45,170 --> 03:38:45,180
time earlier when these conversations
 

10431
03:38:45,180 --> 03:38:47,990
time earlier when these conversations
needed to be were were held among a

10432
03:38:47,990 --> 03:38:48,000
needed to be were were held among a
 

10433
03:38:48,000 --> 03:38:49,910
needed to be were were held among a
small number of experts who made

10434
03:38:49,910 --> 03:38:49,920
small number of experts who made
 

10435
03:38:49,920 --> 03:38:52,130
small number of experts who made
decisions on behalf of every everybody

10436
03:38:52,130 --> 03:38:52,140
decisions on behalf of every everybody
 

10437
03:38:52,140 --> 03:38:54,710
decisions on behalf of every everybody
else but what we're talking about here

10438
03:38:54,710 --> 03:38:54,720
else but what we're talking about here
 

10439
03:38:54,720 --> 03:38:57,469
else but what we're talking about here
is really the future of our species and

10440
03:38:57,469 --> 03:38:57,479
is really the future of our species and
 

10441
03:38:57,479 --> 03:39:00,290
is really the future of our species and
I think that conversation is too

10442
03:39:00,290 --> 03:39:00,300
I think that conversation is too
 

10443
03:39:00,300 --> 03:39:03,889
I think that conversation is too
important to be left just to experts and

10444
03:39:03,889 --> 03:39:03,899
important to be left just to experts and
 

10445
03:39:03,899 --> 03:39:05,570
important to be left just to experts and
and government officials so I mentioned

10446
03:39:05,570 --> 03:39:05,580
and government officials so I mentioned
 

10447
03:39:05,580 --> 03:39:07,790
and government officials so I mentioned
them that I'm a member we just ended our

10448
03:39:07,790 --> 03:39:07,800
them that I'm a member we just ended our
 

10449
03:39:07,800 --> 03:39:09,530
them that I'm a member we just ended our
our work after two years of the World

10450
03:39:09,530 --> 03:39:09,540
our work after two years of the World
 

10451
03:39:09,540 --> 03:39:11,150
our work after two years of the World
Health Organization expert advisory

10452
03:39:11,150 --> 03:39:11,160
Health Organization expert advisory
 

10453
03:39:11,160 --> 03:39:13,910
Health Organization expert advisory
committee on human genome editing and my

10454
03:39:13,910 --> 03:39:13,920
committee on human genome editing and my
 

10455
03:39:13,920 --> 03:39:16,250
committee on human genome editing and my
big push in that process

10456
03:39:16,250 --> 03:39:16,260
big push in that process
 

10457
03:39:16,260 --> 03:39:20,210
big push in that process
was to have education engagement and

10458
03:39:20,210 --> 03:39:20,220
was to have education engagement and
 

10459
03:39:20,220 --> 03:39:22,969
was to have education engagement and
empowerment of the broad public to bring

10460
03:39:22,969 --> 03:39:22,979
empowerment of the broad public to bring
 

10461
03:39:22,979 --> 03:39:25,309
empowerment of the broad public to bring
not just bring people into the

10462
03:39:25,309 --> 03:39:25,319
not just bring people into the
 

10463
03:39:25,319 --> 03:39:27,530
not just bring people into the
conversation with the tools to be able

10464
03:39:27,530 --> 03:39:27,540
conversation with the tools to be able
 

10465
03:39:27,540 --> 03:39:30,170
conversation with the tools to be able
to engage but also into the

10466
03:39:30,170 --> 03:39:30,180
to engage but also into the
 

10467
03:39:30,180 --> 03:39:32,809
to engage but also into the
decision-making process and that's it's

10468
03:39:32,809 --> 03:39:32,819
decision-making process and that's it's
 

10469
03:39:32,819 --> 03:39:34,729
decision-making process and that's it's
a real shift and there are countries

10470
03:39:34,729 --> 03:39:34,739
a real shift and there are countries
 

10471
03:39:34,739 --> 03:39:37,370
a real shift and there are countries
that are doing it better than others I

10472
03:39:37,370 --> 03:39:37,380
that are doing it better than others I
 

10473
03:39:37,380 --> 03:39:39,290
that are doing it better than others I
mean Denmark is obviously a much smaller

10474
03:39:39,290 --> 03:39:39,300
mean Denmark is obviously a much smaller
 

10475
03:39:39,300 --> 03:39:41,269
mean Denmark is obviously a much smaller
country than the United States but they

10476
03:39:41,269 --> 03:39:41,279
country than the United States but they
 

10477
03:39:41,279 --> 03:39:43,330
country than the United States but they
have a really well developed

10478
03:39:43,330 --> 03:39:43,340
have a really well developed
 

10479
03:39:43,340 --> 03:39:46,010
have a really well developed
infrastructure for public engagement

10480
03:39:46,010 --> 03:39:46,020
infrastructure for public engagement
 

10481
03:39:46,020 --> 03:39:48,469
infrastructure for public engagement
around really complicated scientific

10482
03:39:48,469 --> 03:39:48,479
around really complicated scientific
 

10483
03:39:48,479 --> 03:39:50,389
around really complicated scientific
issues and I I just think that we have

10484
03:39:50,389 --> 03:39:50,399
issues and I I just think that we have
 

10485
03:39:50,399 --> 03:39:53,210
issues and I I just think that we have
to like it's great that we have Twitter

10486
03:39:53,210 --> 03:39:53,220
to like it's great that we have Twitter
 

10487
03:39:53,220 --> 03:39:55,670
to like it's great that we have Twitter
and all these other things we need

10488
03:39:55,670 --> 03:39:55,680
and all these other things we need
 

10489
03:39:55,680 --> 03:39:59,030
and all these other things we need
structured conversations that where we

10490
03:39:59,030 --> 03:39:59,040
structured conversations that where we
 

10491
03:39:59,040 --> 03:40:01,309
structured conversations that where we
can really bring people together and and

10492
03:40:01,309 --> 03:40:01,319
can really bring people together and and
 

10493
03:40:01,319 --> 03:40:03,229
can really bring people together and and
listen to each other which feels like

10494
03:40:03,229 --> 03:40:03,239
listen to each other which feels like
 

10495
03:40:03,239 --> 03:40:06,110
listen to each other which feels like
it's it's harder than than ever

10496
03:40:06,110 --> 03:40:06,120
it's it's harder than than ever
 

10497
03:40:06,120 --> 03:40:08,750
it's it's harder than than ever
um but even now in this process where

10498
03:40:08,750 --> 03:40:08,760
um but even now in this process where
 

10499
03:40:08,760 --> 03:40:10,670
um but even now in this process where
all these people are shouting at each

10500
03:40:10,670 --> 03:40:10,680
all these people are shouting at each
 

10501
03:40:10,680 --> 03:40:12,530
all these people are shouting at each
other at least there are a bunch of

10502
03:40:12,530 --> 03:40:12,540
other at least there are a bunch of
 

10503
03:40:12,540 --> 03:40:14,510
other at least there are a bunch of
people who are in the the conversation

10504
03:40:14,510 --> 03:40:14,520
people who are in the the conversation
 

10505
03:40:14,520 --> 03:40:17,210
people who are in the the conversation
so it's we have a foundation but we just

10506
03:40:17,210 --> 03:40:17,220
so it's we have a foundation but we just
 

10507
03:40:17,220 --> 03:40:19,269
so it's we have a foundation but we just
really need to do

10508
03:40:19,269 --> 03:40:19,279
really need to do
 

10509
03:40:19,279 --> 03:40:21,830
really need to do
more work and again and again and again

10510
03:40:21,830 --> 03:40:21,840
more work and again and again and again
 

10511
03:40:21,840 --> 03:40:23,150
more work and again and again and again
it's about

10512
03:40:23,150 --> 03:40:23,160
it's about
 

10513
03:40:23,160 --> 03:40:26,090
it's about
ethics and values because we're at an

10514
03:40:26,090 --> 03:40:26,100
ethics and values because we're at an
 

10515
03:40:26,100 --> 03:40:29,030
ethics and values because we're at an
age and this has become a cliche of

10516
03:40:29,030 --> 03:40:29,040
age and this has become a cliche of
 

10517
03:40:29,040 --> 03:40:31,670
age and this has become a cliche of
exponential technological change and so

10518
03:40:31,670 --> 03:40:31,680
exponential technological change and so
 

10519
03:40:31,680 --> 03:40:35,090
exponential technological change and so
the rate of change is faster going

10520
03:40:35,090 --> 03:40:35,100
the rate of change is faster going
 

10521
03:40:35,100 --> 03:40:36,830
the rate of change is faster going
forward than it has been in the past so

10522
03:40:36,830 --> 03:40:36,840
forward than it has been in the past so
 

10523
03:40:36,840 --> 03:40:39,349
forward than it has been in the past so
in our minds we under appreciate how

10524
03:40:39,349 --> 03:40:39,359
in our minds we under appreciate how
 

10525
03:40:39,359 --> 03:40:42,590
in our minds we under appreciate how
quickly things are changing and um and

10526
03:40:42,590 --> 03:40:42,600
quickly things are changing and um and
 

10527
03:40:42,600 --> 03:40:44,990
quickly things are changing and um and
will change and if we're not careful if

10528
03:40:44,990 --> 03:40:45,000
will change and if we're not careful if
 

10529
03:40:45,000 --> 03:40:47,510
will change and if we're not careful if
we don't know who we are and what our

10530
03:40:47,510 --> 03:40:47,520
we don't know who we are and what our
 

10531
03:40:47,520 --> 03:40:49,969
we don't know who we are and what our
values are we're going to get lost and

10532
03:40:49,969 --> 03:40:49,979
values are we're going to get lost and
 

10533
03:40:49,979 --> 03:40:52,610
values are we're going to get lost and
we don't have to know technology we have

10534
03:40:52,610 --> 03:40:52,620
we don't have to know technology we have
 

10535
03:40:52,620 --> 03:40:55,610
we don't have to know technology we have
to know who we are I mean our values are

10536
03:40:55,610 --> 03:40:55,620
to know who we are I mean our values are
 

10537
03:40:55,620 --> 03:40:59,210
to know who we are I mean our values are
hard won over thousands of years no

10538
03:40:59,210 --> 03:40:59,220
hard won over thousands of years no
 

10539
03:40:59,220 --> 03:41:01,370
hard won over thousands of years no
matter how new the technology is we

10540
03:41:01,370 --> 03:41:01,380
matter how new the technology is we
 

10541
03:41:01,380 --> 03:41:03,830
matter how new the technology is we
shouldn't and can't jettison our our

03:41:03,830 --> 03:41:03,840
shouldn't and can't jettison our our
 

10543
03:41:03,840 --> 03:41:06,349
shouldn't and can't jettison our our
values because that is the our primary

10549
03:41:11,580 --> 03:41:13,670
absurd question because we were
saying that uh

10550
03:41:13,670 --> 03:41:13,680
saying that uh
 

10551
03:41:13,680 --> 03:41:16,309
saying that uh
sexual rep reproduction is not the best

10552
03:41:16,309 --> 03:41:16,319
sexual rep reproduction is not the best
 

10553

um but we may significantly stop having
 

10565
03:41:29,220 --> 03:41:32,870
um but we may significantly stop having

10613
03:42:24,420 --> 03:42:26,030
I love people yeah but it's you know
that's like the thing it's like whenever

10614
03:42:26,030 --> 03:42:26,040
that's like the thing it's like whenever
 

10615
03:42:26,040 --> 03:42:28,550
that's like the thing it's like whenever
you hear these words like humans yeah

10616
03:42:28,550 --> 03:42:28,560
you hear these words like humans yeah
 

10617
03:42:28,560 --> 03:42:30,830
you hear these words like humans yeah
what would I think of next

10618
03:42:30,830 --> 03:42:30,840
what would I think of next
 

10619
03:42:30,840 --> 03:42:32,510
what would I think of next
um so but I do think that and I write

10620
03:42:32,510 --> 03:42:32,520
um so but I do think that and I write
 

10621
03:42:32,520 --> 03:42:35,830
um so but I do think that and I write
about this in in hacking Darwin that as

10622
03:42:35,830 --> 03:42:35,840
about this in in hacking Darwin that as
 

10623
03:42:35,840 --> 03:42:40,610
about this in in hacking Darwin that as
uh people come to believe that having uh

10624
03:42:40,610 --> 03:42:40,620
uh people come to believe that having uh
 

10625
03:42:40,620 --> 03:42:42,410
uh people come to believe that having uh
that making children through the

10626
03:42:42,410 --> 03:42:42,420
that making children through the
 

10627
03:42:42,420 --> 03:42:45,469
that making children through the
application of science is safer and more

10628
03:42:45,469 --> 03:42:45,479
application of science is safer and more
 

10629
03:42:45,479 --> 03:42:47,510
application of science is safer and more
beneficial than having children through

10630
03:42:47,510 --> 03:42:47,520
beneficial than having children through
 

10631
03:42:47,520 --> 03:42:48,769
beneficial than having children through
sex

10632
03:42:48,769 --> 03:42:48,779
sex
 

10633
03:42:48,779 --> 03:42:51,349
sex
um we'll start to see a a shift over

10634
03:42:51,349 --> 03:42:51,359
um we'll start to see a a shift over
 

10635
03:42:51,359 --> 03:42:53,990
um we'll start to see a a shift over
time toward reproduction through through

10636
03:42:53,990 --> 03:42:54,000
time toward reproduction through through
 

10637
03:42:54,000 --> 03:42:56,750
time toward reproduction through through
science we'll still have sex for all

10638
03:42:56,750 --> 03:42:56,760
science we'll still have sex for all
 

10639
03:42:56,760 --> 03:42:59,269
science we'll still have sex for all
this the the same great reasons that we

10640
03:42:59,269 --> 03:42:59,279
this the the same great reasons that we
 

10641
03:42:59,279 --> 03:43:01,790
this the the same great reasons that we
that we do it now it's just reproduction

10642
03:43:01,790 --> 03:43:01,800
that we do it now it's just reproduction

the flaws the the weird quirks of humans

10654
03:43:21,889 --> 03:43:21,899
the flaws the the weird quirks of humans
 

10655
03:43:21,899 --> 03:43:24,410
the flaws the the weird quirks of humans
that's what makes us who we are the the

10656
03:43:24,410 --> 03:43:24,420
that's what makes us who we are the the
 

10657
03:43:24,420 --> 03:43:27,170
that's what makes us who we are the the
weird the weirdest the beautiful and I

10658
03:43:27,170 --> 03:43:27,180
weird the weirdest the beautiful and I
 

10659
03:43:27,180 --> 03:43:28,130
weird the weirdest the beautiful and I
yeah

10660
03:43:28,130 --> 03:43:28,140
yeah
 

10661
03:43:28,140 --> 03:43:32,570
yeah
there's a fear of optimization that I

10662
03:43:32,570 --> 03:43:32,580
there's a fear of optimization that I
 

10663
03:43:32,580 --> 03:43:34,490
there's a fear of optimization that I
you should have it I mean it's very

10664
03:43:34,490 --> 03:43:34,500
you should have it I mean it's very
 

10665
03:43:34,500 --> 03:43:36,410
you should have it I mean it's very
healthy I mean and I think that's the

10666
03:43:36,410 --> 03:43:36,420
healthy I mean and I think that's the
 

10667
03:43:36,420 --> 03:43:38,450
healthy I mean and I think that's the
same word that's the danger of all of

10668
03:43:38,450 --> 03:43:38,460
same word that's the danger of all of
 

10669
03:43:38,460 --> 03:43:41,210
same word that's the danger of all of
this selection is that we make

10670
03:43:41,210 --> 03:43:41,220
this selection is that we make
 

10671
03:43:41,220 --> 03:43:43,910
this selection is that we make
selections just based on social norms

10672
03:43:43,910 --> 03:43:43,920
selections just based on social norms
 

10673
03:43:43,920 --> 03:43:47,269
selections just based on social norms
that are so deeply internal

10674
03:43:47,269 --> 03:43:47,279
that are so deeply internal
 

10675
03:43:47,279 --> 03:43:50,929
that are so deeply internal
that they feel like their Eternal truths

10676
03:43:50,929 --> 03:43:50,939
that they feel like their Eternal truths
 

10677
03:43:50,939 --> 03:43:53,570
that they feel like their Eternal truths
and so we we talked about selecting for

10678
03:43:53,570 --> 03:43:53,580
and so we we talked about selecting for
 

10679
03:43:53,580 --> 03:43:56,389
and so we we talked about selecting for
IQ what about selecting for a kind heart

10680
03:43:56,389 --> 03:43:56,399
IQ what about selecting for a kind heart
 

10681
03:43:56,399 --> 03:43:58,309
IQ what about selecting for a kind heart
like there are lots of people you talked

10682
03:43:58,309 --> 03:43:58,319
like there are lots of people you talked
 

10683
03:43:58,319 --> 03:44:01,010
like there are lots of people you talked
about Hitler and Minecon pillar has

10684
03:44:01,010 --> 03:44:01,020
about Hitler and Minecon pillar has
 

10685
03:44:01,020 --> 03:44:03,590
about Hitler and Minecon pillar has
certainly had a high IQ I guess is

10686
03:44:03,590 --> 03:44:03,600
certainly had a high IQ I guess is
 

10687
03:44:03,600 --> 03:44:05,990
certainly had a high IQ I guess is
higher than average IQ

10688
03:44:05,990 --> 03:44:06,000
higher than average IQ
 

10689
03:44:06,000 --> 03:44:09,710
higher than average IQ
um if we just select I mean that's why I

10690
03:44:09,710 --> 03:44:09,720
um if we just select I mean that's why I
 

10691
03:44:09,720 --> 03:44:12,410
um if we just select I mean that's why I
was saying before diversity is baked

10692
03:44:12,410 --> 03:44:12,420
was saying before diversity is baked
 

10693
03:44:12,420 --> 03:44:14,870
was saying before diversity is baked
into our biology but the the key lesson

10694
03:44:14,870 --> 03:44:14,880
into our biology but the the key lesson
 

10695
03:44:14,880 --> 03:44:16,429
into our biology but the the key lesson
and I've said this many times before the

10696
03:44:16,429 --> 03:44:16,439
and I've said this many times before the
 

10697
03:44:16,439 --> 03:44:18,830
and I've said this many times before the
key lesson of this moment in our history

10698
03:44:18,830 --> 03:44:18,840
key lesson of this moment in our history
 

10699
03:44:18,840 --> 03:44:21,530
key lesson of this moment in our history
is that after nearly four billion years

10700
03:44:21,530 --> 03:44:21,540
is that after nearly four billion years
 

10701
03:44:21,540 --> 03:44:24,830
is that after nearly four billion years
of evolution are one species suddenly

10702
03:44:24,830 --> 03:44:24,840
of evolution are one species suddenly
 

10703
03:44:24,840 --> 03:44:27,650
of evolution are one species suddenly
has the unique and increasing ability to

10704
03:44:27,650 --> 03:44:27,660
has the unique and increasing ability to
 

10705
03:44:27,660 --> 03:44:30,050
has the unique and increasing ability to
read write and hack the code of life

10706
03:44:30,050 --> 03:44:30,060
read write and hack the code of life
 

10707
03:44:30,060 --> 03:44:34,010
read write and hack the code of life
and so as we apply these god-like powers

10708
03:44:34,010 --> 03:44:34,020
and so as we apply these god-like powers
 

10709
03:44:34,020 --> 03:44:37,849
and so as we apply these god-like powers
that we've now assumed for ourselves

10710
03:44:37,849 --> 03:44:37,859
that we've now assumed for ourselves
 

10711
03:44:37,859 --> 03:44:39,950
that we've now assumed for ourselves
um we better be pretty careful uh

10712
03:44:39,950 --> 03:44:39,960
um we better be pretty careful uh
 

10713
03:44:39,960 --> 03:44:44,210
um we better be pretty careful uh
because it's so easy to make mistakes uh

10714
03:44:44,210 --> 03:44:44,220
because it's so easy to make mistakes uh
 

10715
03:44:44,220 --> 03:44:47,330
because it's so easy to make mistakes uh
particularly mistakes that are Guided by

10716
03:44:47,330 --> 03:44:47,340
particularly mistakes that are Guided by
 

10717
03:44:47,340 --> 03:44:49,550
particularly mistakes that are Guided by
our best intentions

10718
03:44:49,550 --> 03:44:49,560
our best intentions
 

10719
03:44:49,560 --> 03:44:52,429
our best intentions
to jump briefly back onto lab league and

10720
03:44:52,429 --> 03:44:52,439
to jump briefly back onto lab league and
 

10721
03:44:52,439 --> 03:44:54,889
to jump briefly back onto lab league and
I swear there's a reason for that

10722
03:44:54,889 --> 03:44:54,899
I swear there's a reason for that
 

10723
03:44:54,899 --> 03:44:55,550
I swear there's a reason for that
um

10724
03:44:55,550 --> 03:44:55,560
um
 

10725
03:44:55,560 --> 03:44:59,090
um

10728
03:45:01,370 --> 03:45:01,380
this moment I forget what it was maybe a
 

10729
03:45:01,380 --> 03:45:03,950
this moment I forget what it was maybe a
few months ago in the summer I think of

10730

few months ago in the summer I think of
 

10731
03:45:03,960 --> 03:45:08,150

03:45:27,000 --> 03:45:30,050
highlighted the common sense nature
about what was the metaphor he used

03:46:09,060 --> 03:46:11,090
and talking period
um so for me in the earliest I remember

10782
03:46:11,090 --> 03:46:11,100
um so for me in the earliest I remember
 

10783
03:46:11,100 --> 03:46:13,670
um so for me in the earliest I remember
those early days of when the pandemic

10784
03:46:13,670 --> 03:46:13,680
those early days of when the pandemic
 

10785
03:46:13,680 --> 03:46:15,229
those early days of when the pandemic
started I was just sitting down it was

10786
03:46:15,229 --> 03:46:15,239
started I was just sitting down it was
 

10787
03:46:15,239 --> 03:46:17,510
started I was just sitting down it was
late January or early February 2020 and

10788
03:46:17,510 --> 03:46:17,520
late January or early February 2020 and
 

10789
03:46:17,520 --> 03:46:19,910
late January or early February 2020 and
I just was laying out all of the

10790
03:46:19,910 --> 03:46:19,920
I just was laying out all of the
 

10791
03:46:19,920 --> 03:46:22,610
I just was laying out all of the
evidence just as I that I could collect

10792
03:46:22,610 --> 03:46:22,620
evidence just as I that I could collect
 

10793
03:46:22,620 --> 03:46:25,729
evidence just as I that I could collect
trying to say make sense of where does

10794
03:46:25,729 --> 03:46:25,739
trying to say make sense of where does
 

10795
03:46:25,739 --> 03:46:28,130
trying to say make sense of where does
this come from and it just it was just

10796
03:46:28,130 --> 03:46:28,140
this come from and it just it was just
 

10797
03:46:28,140 --> 03:46:32,030
this come from and it just it was just
logic I mean I it was all the things

10798
03:46:32,030 --> 03:46:32,040
logic I mean I it was all the things
 

10799
03:46:32,040 --> 03:46:34,910
logic I mean I it was all the things
that Jon Stewart said which in some you

10800
03:46:34,910 --> 03:46:34,920
that Jon Stewart said which in some you
 

10801
03:46:34,920 --> 03:46:37,370
that Jon Stewart said which in some you
know overly wordy form were all at that

10802
03:46:37,370 --> 03:46:37,380
know overly wordy form were all at that
 

10803
03:46:37,380 --> 03:46:39,769
know overly wordy form were all at that
time on my website like what are the

10804
03:46:39,769 --> 03:46:39,779
time on my website like what are the
 

10805
03:46:39,779 --> 03:46:43,250
time on my website like what are the
odds of having this this outbreak of a

10806
03:46:43,250 --> 03:46:43,260
odds of having this this outbreak of a
 

10807
03:46:43,260 --> 03:46:45,469
odds of having this this outbreak of a
bad coronavirus of more than a thousand

10808
03:46:45,469 --> 03:46:45,479
bad coronavirus of more than a thousand
 

10809
03:46:45,479 --> 03:46:47,269
bad coronavirus of more than a thousand
miles away from where these bats have

10810
03:46:47,269 --> 03:46:47,279
miles away from where these bats have
 

10811
03:46:47,279 --> 03:46:50,210
miles away from where these bats have
their natural habitat where they have

10812
03:46:50,210 --> 03:46:50,220
their natural habitat where they have
 

10813
03:46:50,220 --> 03:46:53,210
their natural habitat where they have
the the largest collection of these bad

10814
03:46:53,210 --> 03:46:53,220
the the largest collection of these bad
 

10815
03:46:53,220 --> 03:46:55,550
the the largest collection of these bad
coronaviruses in the world and they're

10816
03:46:55,550 --> 03:46:55,560
coronaviruses in the world and they're
 

10817
03:46:55,560 --> 03:46:58,969
coronaviruses in the world and they're
doing all these very aggressive research

10818
03:46:58,969 --> 03:46:58,979
doing all these very aggressive research
 

10819
03:46:58,979 --> 03:47:02,150
doing all these very aggressive research
projects to make them more aggressive

10820
03:47:02,150 --> 03:47:02,160
projects to make them more aggressive
 

10821
03:47:02,160 --> 03:47:04,010
projects to make them more aggressive
and then you have the outbreak of a

10822
03:47:04,010 --> 03:47:04,020
and then you have the outbreak of a
 

10823
03:47:04,020 --> 03:47:06,110
and then you have the outbreak of a
virus that's that's primed for a human

10824
03:47:06,110 --> 03:47:06,120
virus that's that's primed for a human
 

10825
03:47:06,120 --> 03:47:08,929
virus that's that's primed for a human
to human transmission

10826
03:47:08,929 --> 03:47:08,939
to human transmission
 

10827
03:47:08,939 --> 03:47:12,530
to human transmission
um it was just logic was my first step

10828
03:47:12,530 --> 03:47:12,540
um it was just logic was my first step
 

10829
03:47:12,540 --> 03:47:15,710
um it was just logic was my first step
and I you know kept Gathering Gathering

10830
03:47:15,710 --> 03:47:15,720
and I you know kept Gathering Gathering
 

10831
03:47:15,720 --> 03:47:17,389
and I you know kept Gathering Gathering
the the information

10832
03:47:17,389 --> 03:47:17,399
the the information
 

10833
03:47:17,399 --> 03:47:20,689
the the information
but Jon Stewart distilled that in a way

10834
03:47:20,689 --> 03:47:20,699
but Jon Stewart distilled that in a way
 

10835
03:47:20,699 --> 03:47:24,490
but Jon Stewart distilled that in a way
that just everybody got and I think that

10836
03:47:24,490 --> 03:47:24,500
that just everybody got and I think that
 

10837
03:47:24,500 --> 03:47:27,170
that just everybody got and I think that
like I loved it and I just think that

10838
03:47:27,170 --> 03:47:27,180
like I loved it and I just think that
 

10839
03:47:27,180 --> 03:47:29,210
like I loved it and I just think that
there's a way of reaching people it's

10840
03:47:29,210 --> 03:47:29,220
there's a way of reaching people it's
 

10841
03:47:29,220 --> 03:47:31,429
there's a way of reaching people it's
the reason why I write science fiction

10842
03:47:31,429 --> 03:47:31,439
the reason why I write science fiction
 

10843
03:47:31,439 --> 03:47:33,050
the reason why I write science fiction
in addition to thinking and writing

10844
03:47:33,050 --> 03:47:33,060
in addition to thinking and writing
 

10845
03:47:33,060 --> 03:47:35,030
in addition to thinking and writing
about the science is that we kind of

10846
03:47:35,030 --> 03:47:35,040
about the science is that we kind of
 

10847
03:47:35,040 --> 03:47:38,150
about the science is that we kind of
have to reach people where they are and

10848
03:47:38,150 --> 03:47:38,160
have to reach people where they are and
 

10849
03:47:38,160 --> 03:47:41,030
have to reach people where they are and
and I just thought it was just there was

10850
03:47:41,030 --> 03:47:41,040
and I just thought it was just there was
 

10851
03:47:41,040 --> 03:47:43,729
and I just thought it was just there was
a lot of depth I thought and I mean

10852
03:47:43,729 --> 03:47:43,739
a lot of depth I thought and I mean
 

10853
03:47:43,739 --> 03:47:44,830
a lot of depth I thought and I mean
maybe that's

10854
03:47:44,830 --> 03:47:44,840
maybe that's
 

10855
03:47:44,840 --> 03:47:47,809
maybe that's
too self-serving but like in the

10856
03:47:47,809 --> 03:47:47,819
too self-serving but like in the
 

10857
03:47:47,819 --> 03:47:51,830
too self-serving but like in the
analysis but he he captured that into

10858
03:47:51,830 --> 03:47:51,840
analysis but he he captured that into
 

10859
03:47:51,840 --> 03:47:54,650
analysis but he he captured that into
the in in into those things about it's

10860
03:47:54,650 --> 03:47:54,660
the in in into those things about it's
 

10861
03:47:54,660 --> 03:47:57,170
the in in into those things about it's
like the the whatever the chewy the

10862
03:47:57,170 --> 03:47:57,180
like the the whatever the chewy the
 

10863
03:47:57,180 --> 03:47:59,809
like the the whatever the chewy the
outbreak of chewy goodness near the

10864
03:47:59,809 --> 03:47:59,819
outbreak of chewy goodness near the
 

10865
03:47:59,819 --> 03:48:01,550
outbreak of chewy goodness near the
Hershey factory I wonder where that came

10866
03:48:01,550 --> 03:48:01,560
Hershey factory I wonder where that came
 

10867
03:48:01,560 --> 03:48:05,090
Hershey factory I wonder where that came
from yeah this the humor this metaphor

10868
03:48:05,090 --> 03:48:05,100
from yeah this the humor this metaphor

10871
03:48:08,040 --> 03:48:11,450
also the like sticking with the joke
when the audience is uh

10872
03:48:11,450 --> 03:48:11,460
when the audience is uh
 

10873
03:48:11,460 --> 03:48:13,910
when the audience is uh
um in the audience that Stephen Colbert

10874
03:48:13,910 --> 03:48:13,920
um in the audience that Stephen Colbert
 

10875
03:48:13,920 --> 03:48:16,250
um in the audience that Stephen Colbert
he was like resisting it

10876
03:48:16,250 --> 03:48:16,260
he was like resisting it
 

10877
03:48:16,260 --> 03:48:18,050
he was like resisting it
he was very uncomfortable with it maybe

10878
03:48:18,050 --> 03:48:18,060
he was very uncomfortable with it maybe
 

10879
03:48:18,060 --> 03:48:19,729
he was very uncomfortable with it maybe
that was part of the bit I'm not sure

10880
03:48:19,729 --> 03:48:19,739
that was part of the bit I'm not sure
 

10881
03:48:19,739 --> 03:48:23,090
that was part of the bit I'm not sure
but it didn't look like it so Stephen in

10882
03:48:23,090 --> 03:48:23,100
but it didn't look like it so Stephen in
 

10883
03:48:23,100 --> 03:48:24,469
but it didn't look like it so Stephen in
that moment kind of represents the

10884
03:48:24,469 --> 03:48:24,479
that moment kind of represents the
 

10885
03:48:24,479 --> 03:48:26,269
that moment kind of represents the
discomfort of the scientific Community I

10886
03:48:26,269 --> 03:48:26,279
discomfort of the scientific Community I
 

10887
03:48:26,279 --> 03:48:28,070
discomfort of the scientific Community I
think it's kind of interesting that

10888
03:48:28,070 --> 03:48:28,080
think it's kind of interesting that
 

10889
03:48:28,080 --> 03:48:30,590
think it's kind of interesting that
whole dynamic and I think that was a

10890
03:48:30,590 --> 03:48:30,600
whole dynamic and I think that was a
 

10891
03:48:30,600 --> 03:48:32,650
whole dynamic and I think that was a
pivotal moment

10892
03:48:32,650 --> 03:48:32,660
pivotal moment
 

10893
03:48:32,660 --> 03:48:35,450
pivotal moment

03:49:04,670 --> 03:49:04,680
and I wish the scientific communicators
 

10915
03:49:04,680 --> 03:49:06,170

himself to keep himself humble

11098
03:52:53,870 --> 03:52:53,880
himself to keep himself humble
 

11099
03:52:53,880 --> 03:52:56,210
himself to keep himself humble
I mean I I think that's really useful to

11100
03:52:56,210 --> 03:52:56,220
I mean I I think that's really useful to
 

11101
03:52:56,220 --> 03:52:58,189
I mean I I think that's really useful to
in some kind of way for people in

11102
03:52:58,189 --> 03:52:58,199
in some kind of way for people in
 

11103
03:52:58,199 --> 03:52:59,929
in some kind of way for people in
general to

11104
03:52:59,929 --> 03:52:59,939
general to
 

11105
03:52:59,939 --> 03:53:01,250
general to
um yeah make fun of themselves a little

11106
03:53:01,250 --> 03:53:01,260
um yeah make fun of themselves a little
 

11107
03:53:01,260 --> 03:53:02,990
um yeah make fun of themselves a little
bit in whatever way that means and

11108
03:53:02,990 --> 03:53:03,000
bit in whatever way that means and
 

11109
03:53:03,000 --> 03:53:04,550
bit in whatever way that means and
saying I'm just a comedian is just one

11110
03:53:04,550 --> 03:53:04,560
saying I'm just a comedian is just one
 

11111
03:53:04,560 --> 03:53:06,710
saying I'm just a comedian is just one
way to do that now that that coupled

11112
03:53:06,710 --> 03:53:06,720
way to do that now that that coupled
 

11113
03:53:06,720 --> 03:53:08,630
way to do that now that that coupled
that with the responsibility of doing

11114
03:53:08,630 --> 03:53:08,640
that with the responsibility of doing
 

11115
03:53:08,640 --> 03:53:11,150
that with the responsibility of doing
the research and really having your open

11116
03:53:11,150 --> 03:53:11,160
the research and really having your open
 

11117
03:53:11,160 --> 03:53:13,969
the research and really having your open
mind and all those kinds of stuff

11118
03:53:13,969 --> 03:53:13,979
mind and all those kinds of stuff
 

11119
03:53:13,979 --> 03:53:15,469
mind and all those kinds of stuff
um I think that's something Joe does

11120
03:53:15,469 --> 03:53:15,479
um I think that's something Joe does
 

11121
03:53:15,479 --> 03:53:17,929
um I think that's something Joe does
really well on a lot of topics but he

11122
03:53:17,929 --> 03:53:17,939
really well on a lot of topics but he
 

11123
03:53:17,939 --> 03:53:20,269
really well on a lot of topics but he
can't do that and everything and so that

11124
03:53:20,269 --> 03:53:20,279
can't do that and everything and so that
 

11125
03:53:20,279 --> 03:53:23,030
can't do that and everything and so that
it's it's up to the people to decide how

11126
03:53:23,030 --> 03:53:23,040
it's it's up to the people to decide how
 

11127
03:53:23,040 --> 03:53:25,130
it's it's up to the people to decide how
well he does it on on certain topics and

11128
03:53:25,130 --> 03:53:25,140
well he does it on on certain topics and
 

11129
03:53:25,140 --> 03:53:26,870
well he does it on on certain topics and
and not others

11130
03:53:26,870 --> 03:53:26,880
and not others
 

11131
03:53:26,880 --> 03:53:28,670
and not others

11137
03:53:32,580 --> 03:53:35,349

uh communication so I am personally more

11150
03:53:51,710 --> 03:53:51,720
uh communication so I am personally more
 

11151
03:53:51,720 --> 03:53:54,769
uh communication so I am personally more
sympathetic now to the arguments that

11152
03:53:54,769 --> 03:53:54,779
sympathetic now to the arguments that
 

11153
03:53:54,779 --> 03:53:58,429
sympathetic now to the arguments that
Sanjay was making or trying uh trying to

11154
03:53:58,429 --> 03:53:58,439
Sanjay was making or trying uh trying to
 

11155
03:53:58,439 --> 03:54:00,950
Sanjay was making or trying uh trying to
make I believe that the threat of the

11156
03:54:00,950 --> 03:54:00,960
make I believe that the threat of the
 

11157
03:54:00,960 --> 03:54:03,469
make I believe that the threat of the
virus is greater than the threat of the

11158
03:54:03,469 --> 03:54:03,479
virus is greater than the threat of the
 

11159
03:54:03,479 --> 03:54:05,689
virus is greater than the threat of the
vaccine that doesn't mean that we can

11160
03:54:05,689 --> 03:54:05,699
vaccine that doesn't mean that we can
 

11161
03:54:05,699 --> 03:54:08,929
vaccine that doesn't mean that we can
guarantee 100 safety

11162
03:54:08,929 --> 03:54:08,939
guarantee 100 safety
 

11163
03:54:08,939 --> 03:54:11,389
guarantee 100 safety
um for the vaccine but these are really

11164
03:54:11,389 --> 03:54:11,399
um for the vaccine but these are really
 

11165
03:54:11,399 --> 03:54:14,570
um for the vaccine but these are really
well tolerated vaccine and we know for

11166
03:54:14,570 --> 03:54:14,580
well tolerated vaccine and we know for
 

11167
03:54:14,580 --> 03:54:15,710
well tolerated vaccine and we know for
all the reasons we've been talking about

11168
03:54:15,710 --> 03:54:15,720
all the reasons we've been talking about
 

11169
03:54:15,720 --> 03:54:19,010
all the reasons we've been talking about
this is a really scary virus and

11170
03:54:19,010 --> 03:54:19,020
this is a really scary virus and
 

11171
03:54:19,020 --> 03:54:21,349
this is a really scary virus and
particularly the MRNA vaccines what

11172
03:54:21,349 --> 03:54:21,359
particularly the MRNA vaccines what
 

11173
03:54:21,359 --> 03:54:23,150
particularly the MRNA vaccines what
they're basically doing is getting your

11174
03:54:23,150 --> 03:54:23,160
they're basically doing is getting your
 

11175
03:54:23,160 --> 03:54:25,670
they're basically doing is getting your
body to replicate a tiny little piece of

11176
03:54:25,670 --> 03:54:25,680
body to replicate a tiny little piece of
 

11177
03:54:25,680 --> 03:54:27,469
body to replicate a tiny little piece of
the virus the spike protein and then

11178
03:54:27,469 --> 03:54:27,479
the virus the spike protein and then
 

11179
03:54:27,479 --> 03:54:30,769
the virus the spike protein and then
your body responds to that and so that's

11180
03:54:30,769 --> 03:54:30,779
your body responds to that and so that's
 

11181
03:54:30,779 --> 03:54:34,070
your body responds to that and so that's
a much less much less of an insult to

11182
03:54:34,070 --> 03:54:34,080
a much less much less of an insult to
 

11183
03:54:34,080 --> 03:54:36,950
a much less much less of an insult to
your body than being infected by the

11184
03:54:36,950 --> 03:54:36,960
your body than being infected by the
 

11185
03:54:36,960 --> 03:54:40,790
your body than being infected by the
virus so I'm I'm more sympathetic to the

11186
03:54:40,790 --> 03:54:40,800
virus so I'm I'm more sympathetic to the
 

11187
03:54:40,800 --> 03:54:43,550
virus so I'm I'm more sympathetic to the
people who say well everybody should get

11188
03:54:43,550 --> 03:54:43,560
people who say well everybody should get
 

11189
03:54:43,560 --> 03:54:46,610
people who say well everybody should get
vaccinated but people who've already

11190
03:54:46,610 --> 03:54:46,620
vaccinated but people who've already
 

11191
03:54:46,620 --> 03:54:49,790
vaccinated but people who've already
been infected we should study whether

11192
03:54:49,790 --> 03:54:49,800
been infected we should study whether
 

11193
03:54:49,800 --> 03:54:53,210
been infected we should study whether
they need to be vaccinated or not having

11194
03:54:53,210 --> 03:54:53,220
they need to be vaccinated or not having
 

11195
03:54:53,220 --> 03:54:56,889
they need to be vaccinated or not having
said all of that I felt that

11196
03:54:56,889 --> 03:54:56,899
said all of that I felt that
 

11197
03:54:56,899 --> 03:55:00,410
said all of that I felt that
that Joe Rogan won the debate I mean it

11198
03:55:00,410 --> 03:55:00,420
that Joe Rogan won the debate I mean it
 

11199
03:55:00,420 --> 03:55:03,050
that Joe Rogan won the debate I mean it
was and the reason that I felt that he

11200
03:55:03,050 --> 03:55:03,060
was and the reason that I felt that he
 

11201
03:55:03,060 --> 03:55:04,910
was and the reason that I felt that he
won the debate was there if they were

11202
03:55:04,910 --> 03:55:04,920
won the debate was there if they were
 

11203
03:55:04,920 --> 03:55:06,769
won the debate was there if they were
kind of had they had two different

11204
03:55:06,769 --> 03:55:06,779
kind of had they had two different
 

11205
03:55:06,779 --> 03:55:10,269
kind of had they had two different
categories of arguments so Sanjay

11206
03:55:10,269 --> 03:55:10,279
categories of arguments so Sanjay
 

11207
03:55:10,279 --> 03:55:12,650
categories of arguments so Sanjay
what he was trying to do which I totally

11208
03:55:12,650 --> 03:55:12,660
what he was trying to do which I totally
 

11209
03:55:12,660 --> 03:55:14,330
what he was trying to do which I totally
respect was was saying there's so much

11210
03:55:14,330 --> 03:55:14,340
respect was was saying there's so much
 

11211
03:55:14,340 --> 03:55:16,490
respect was was saying there's so much
animosity between the on these different

11212
03:55:16,490 --> 03:55:16,500
animosity between the on these different
 

11213
03:55:16,500 --> 03:55:18,410
animosity between the on these different
sides let's lower the temperature let's

11214
03:55:18,410 --> 03:55:18,420
sides let's lower the temperature let's
 

11215
03:55:18,420 --> 03:55:21,050
sides let's lower the temperature let's
let's model that we can have a

11216
03:55:21,050 --> 03:55:21,060
let's model that we can have a
 

11217
03:55:21,060 --> 03:55:23,929
let's model that we can have a
respectful dialogue with each other we

11218
03:55:23,929 --> 03:55:23,939
respectful dialogue with each other we
 

11219
03:55:23,939 --> 03:55:25,969
respectful dialogue with each other we
can actually listen and Sanjay again

11220
03:55:25,969 --> 03:55:25,979
can actually listen and Sanjay again
 

11221
03:55:25,979 --> 03:55:28,250

11228
03:55:38,330 --> 03:55:38,340
him and so he was making cases that were
 

11229
03:55:38,340 --> 03:55:40,429
him and so he was making cases that were
based on kind of averages studies and

11230
03:55:40,429 --> 03:55:40,439
based on kind of averages studies and
 

11231
03:55:40,439 --> 03:55:43,670
based on kind of averages studies and
things like that and Joe was saying well

11232
03:55:43,670 --> 03:55:43,680
things like that and Joe was saying well
 

11233
03:55:43,680 --> 03:55:46,670
things like that and Joe was saying well

all true in the sense that we have
millions of people who are getting

another case he must have been like
because I don't imagine he would bring

11298
03:57:04,130 --> 03:57:04,140
because I don't imagine he would bring

respect to the full range of things that

11322
03:57:34,070 --> 03:57:34,080
respect to the full range of things that

11330
03:57:43,910 --> 03:57:43,920
but uh yes that conversation was flawed
 

11331
03:57:43,920 --> 03:57:47,349
but uh yes that conversation was flawed
in many ways and one of them was why

11332
03:57:47,349 --> 03:57:47,359
in many ways and one of them was why
 

11333
03:57:47,359 --> 03:57:51,110
in many ways and one of them was why
when you're trying to present some kind

11334
03:57:51,110 --> 03:57:51,120
when you're trying to present some kind
 

11335
03:57:51,120 --> 03:57:53,349
when you're trying to present some kind
of critical

11336
03:57:53,349 --> 03:57:53,359
of critical
 

11337
03:57:53,359 --> 03:57:56,269
of critical
like criticized Joe Rogan

11338
03:57:56,269 --> 03:57:56,279
like criticized Joe Rogan
 

11339
03:57:56,279 --> 03:57:59,090
like criticized Joe Rogan
why bring up an adult events at all and

11340
03:57:59,090 --> 03:57:59,100
why bring up an adult events at all and
 

11341
03:57:59,100 --> 03:58:01,910
why bring up an adult events at all and
if you do bring up anecdotal evidence

11342
03:58:01,910 --> 03:58:01,920
if you do bring up anecdotal evidence
 

11343
03:58:01,920 --> 03:58:03,769
if you do bring up anecdotal evidence
which is not scientific if you're

11344
03:58:03,769 --> 03:58:03,779
which is not scientific if you're
 

11345
03:58:03,779 --> 03:58:05,090
which is not scientific if you're
scientist you should not be using

11346
03:58:05,090 --> 03:58:05,100
scientist you should not be using
 

11347
03:58:05,100 --> 03:58:07,790
scientist you should not be using
anecdotal evidence if you do bring it up

11348
03:58:07,790 --> 03:58:07,800
anecdotal evidence if you do bring it up
 

11349
03:58:07,800 --> 03:58:10,910
anecdotal evidence if you do bring it up
why bring up one that's not

11350
03:58:10,910 --> 03:58:10,920
why bring up one that's not
 

11351
03:58:10,920 --> 03:58:13,070
why bring up one that's not
that's first not true and you know it's

11352
03:58:13,070 --> 03:58:13,080
that's first not true and you know it's
 

11353
03:58:13,080 --> 03:58:14,710
that's first not true and you know it's
not true

11354
03:58:14,710 --> 03:58:14,720
not true
 

11355
03:58:14,720 --> 03:58:17,689
not true
so I know to pretend so you don't know

11356
03:58:17,689 --> 03:58:17,699
so I know to pretend so you don't know
 

11357
03:58:17,699 --> 03:58:19,550
so I know to pretend so you don't know
it's not your book so yes that would

11358
03:58:19,550 --> 03:58:19,560
it's not your book so yes that would
 

11359
03:58:19,560 --> 03:58:22,490
it's not your book so yes that would
have been find another case exactly uh

11360
03:58:22,490 --> 03:58:22,500
have been find another case exactly uh
 

11361
03:58:22,500 --> 03:58:24,590
have been find another case exactly uh
where exactly so the basic thing in it

11362
03:58:24,590 --> 03:58:24,600
where exactly so the basic thing in it
 

11363
03:58:24,600 --> 03:58:27,229
where exactly so the basic thing in it
coming back to Sanjay and and Joe's uh

11364
03:58:27,229 --> 03:58:27,239
coming back to Sanjay and and Joe's uh
 

11365
03:58:27,239 --> 03:58:30,110
coming back to Sanjay and and Joe's uh
conversation was that Sanjay was trying

11366
03:58:30,110 --> 03:58:30,120
conversation was that Sanjay was trying
 

11367
03:58:30,120 --> 03:58:32,389
conversation was that Sanjay was trying
to use statistical evidence and Joe was

11368
03:58:32,389 --> 03:58:32,399
to use statistical evidence and Joe was
 

11369
03:58:32,399 --> 03:58:34,250
to use statistical evidence and Joe was
using anecdotal evidence and so I think

11370
03:58:34,250 --> 03:58:34,260
using anecdotal evidence and so I think
 

11371
03:58:34,260 --> 03:58:37,250
using anecdotal evidence and so I think
that for Sanjay and there are all kinds

11372
03:58:37,250 --> 03:58:37,260
that for Sanjay and there are all kinds
 

11373
03:58:37,260 --> 03:58:39,110
that for Sanjay and there are all kinds
of of things where there are debates

11374
03:58:39,110 --> 03:58:39,120
of of things where there are debates
 

11375
03:58:39,120 --> 03:58:41,689
of of things where there are debates
where the often the person who's better

11376
03:58:41,689 --> 03:58:41,699
where the often the person who's better
 

11377
03:58:41,699 --> 03:58:44,689
where the often the person who's better
at debating wins the debate regardless

11378
03:58:44,689 --> 03:58:44,699
at debating wins the debate regardless
 

11379
03:58:44,699 --> 03:58:46,910
at debating wins the debate regardless
of the topic

11380
03:58:46,910 --> 03:58:46,920
of the topic
 

11381
03:58:46,920 --> 03:58:49,370
of the topic
um so I think what what Sanjay could

11382
03:58:49,370 --> 03:58:49,380
um so I think what what Sanjay could
 

11383
03:58:49,380 --> 03:58:51,349
um so I think what what Sanjay could
have done and Sanjay is such a smart a

11384
03:58:51,349 --> 03:58:51,359
have done and Sanjay is such a smart a
 

11385
03:58:51,359 --> 03:58:53,030
have done and Sanjay is such a smart a
smart guy

11386
03:58:53,030 --> 03:58:53,040
smart guy
 

11387
03:58:53,040 --> 03:58:55,429
smart guy
um is to say why well that's that's an

11388
03:58:55,429 --> 03:58:55,439
um is to say why well that's that's an
 

11389
03:58:55,439 --> 03:58:58,070
um is to say why well that's that's an
anecdote here's another anecdote and

11390
03:58:58,070 --> 03:58:58,080
anecdote here's another anecdote and
 

11391
03:58:58,080 --> 03:59:00,050
anecdote here's another anecdote and
there are lots of different anecdotes

11392
03:59:00,050 --> 03:59:00,060
there are lots of different anecdotes
 

11393
03:59:00,060 --> 03:59:02,150
there are lots of different anecdotes
and there certainly are people who have

11394
03:59:02,150 --> 03:59:02,160
and there certainly are people who have
 

11395
03:59:02,160 --> 03:59:04,910
and there certainly are people who have
taken the vaccine and have had problems

taken the vaccine and have had problems
 

11397
03:59:04,920 --> 03:59:07,490
taken the vaccine and have had problems
that could reasonably be traced to the

11398
03:59:07,490 --> 03:59:07,500
that could reasonably be traced to the
 

11399
03:59:07,500 --> 03:59:10,370
that could reasonably be traced to the
vaccines and there certainly are lots of

11400
03:59:10,370 --> 03:59:10,380

everybody and if somebody is cautious
about the vaccine for themselves or or

04:01:09,170 --> 04:01:09,180
about the vaccine for themselves or or
 

11507
04:01:09,180 --> 04:01:11,870
about the vaccine for themselves or or
for their children we have to listen to

for their children we have to listen to
 

11509
04:01:11,880 --> 04:01:14,570
for their children we have to listen to
that at the same time

11510
04:01:14,570 --> 04:01:14,580
that at the same time
 

11511
04:01:14,580 --> 04:01:18,650
that at the same time
public health is about creating public

11512
04:01:18,650 --> 04:01:18,660
public health is about creating public
 

11513
04:01:18,660 --> 04:01:21,590
public health is about creating public
health and there's no doubt I think Joe

11514
04:01:21,590 --> 04:01:21,600
health and there's no doubt I think Joe
 

11515
04:01:21,600 --> 04:01:24,790
health and there's no doubt I think Joe
was absolutely right that older people

11516
04:01:24,790 --> 04:01:24,800
was absolutely right that older people
 

11517
04:01:24,800 --> 04:01:28,670
was absolutely right that older people
obese people are at greater risk for

11518
04:01:28,670 --> 04:01:28,680
obese people are at greater risk for
 

11519
04:01:28,680 --> 04:01:31,429
obese people are at greater risk for
being harmed or killed by the by

11520
04:01:31,429 --> 04:01:31,439
being harmed or killed by the by
 

11521
04:01:31,439 --> 04:01:35,229
being harmed or killed by the by
covid-19 than young healthy people but

11522
04:01:35,229 --> 04:01:35,239
covid-19 than young healthy people but
 

11523
04:01:35,239 --> 04:01:38,570
covid-19 than young healthy people but
by everybody getting vaccinated we

11524
04:01:38,570 --> 04:01:38,580
by everybody getting vaccinated we
 

11525
04:01:38,580 --> 04:01:41,809
by everybody getting vaccinated we
reduce the risk to everybody else and so

11526
04:01:41,809 --> 04:01:41,819
reduce the risk to everybody else and so
 

11527
04:01:41,819 --> 04:01:44,090
reduce the risk to everybody else and so
I feel like like with everything there's

11528
04:01:44,090 --> 04:01:44,100
I feel like like with everything there's
 

11529
04:01:44,100 --> 04:01:47,210
I feel like like with everything there's
the individual benefit argument and then

11530
04:01:47,210 --> 04:01:47,220
the individual benefit argument and then
 

11531
04:01:47,220 --> 04:01:49,729
the individual benefit argument and then
there's the community argument and I

11532
04:01:49,729 --> 04:01:49,739
there's the community argument and I
 

11533
04:01:49,739 --> 04:01:51,349
there's the community argument and I
absolutely think about expressing that

11534
04:01:51,349 --> 04:01:51,359
absolutely think about expressing that
 

11535
04:01:51,359 --> 04:01:52,610
absolutely think about expressing that
clearly that there's a difference

11536
04:01:52,610 --> 04:01:52,620
clearly that there's a difference
 

11537
04:01:52,620 --> 04:01:55,610
clearly that there's a difference
between the individual health and

11538
04:01:55,610 --> 04:01:55,620
between the individual health and
 

11539
04:01:55,620 --> 04:01:58,670
between the individual health and
freedoms and uh the community health and

11540
04:01:58,670 --> 04:01:58,680
freedoms and uh the community health and
 

11541
04:01:58,680 --> 04:02:01,130
freedoms and uh the community health and
freedoms and exp steel Manning each side

11542
04:02:01,130 --> 04:02:01,140
freedoms and exp steel Manning each side
 

11543
04:02:01,140 --> 04:02:03,110
freedoms and exp steel Manning each side
of this this is one of the problems that

11544
04:02:03,110 --> 04:02:03,120
of this this is one of the problems that
 

11545
04:02:03,120 --> 04:02:06,050
of this this is one of the problems that
people don't do enough of is be able to

11546
04:02:06,050 --> 04:02:06,060
people don't do enough of is be able to
 

11547
04:02:06,060 --> 04:02:08,290
people don't do enough of is be able to
so how do you just steal men an argument

11548
04:02:08,290 --> 04:02:08,300
so how do you just steal men an argument
 

11549
04:02:08,300 --> 04:02:10,670
so how do you just steal men an argument
you describe that argument in the best

11550
04:02:10,670 --> 04:02:10,680
you describe that argument in the best
 

11551
04:02:10,680 --> 04:02:12,410
you describe that argument in the best
possible way

11552
04:02:12,410 --> 04:02:12,420
possible way
 

11553
04:02:12,420 --> 04:02:14,090
possible way

people who were just kind of imagining
something else I mean you always talk

11706
04:05:26,450 --> 04:05:26,460
something else I mean you always talk
 

11707
04:05:26,460 --> 04:05:27,950
something else I mean you always talk
about kind of humility and active

11708
04:05:27,950 --> 04:05:27,960
about kind of humility and active
 

11709

about kind of humility and active
listening

11710
04:05:29,150 --> 04:05:29,160
listening
 

11711
04:05:29,160 --> 04:05:31,070
listening
I know you don't mean and it doesn't

11712
04:05:31,070 --> 04:05:31,080
I know you don't mean and it doesn't
 

11713
04:05:31,080 --> 04:05:33,410
I know you don't mean and it doesn't
mean that we don't stand for something

11714
04:05:33,410 --> 04:05:33,420
mean that we don't stand for something
 

11715
04:05:33,420 --> 04:05:35,689
mean that we don't stand for something
like I I certainly am a strong proponent

11716
04:05:35,689 --> 04:05:35,699
like I I certainly am a strong proponent
 

11717
04:05:35,699 --> 04:05:38,090
like I I certainly am a strong proponent
of vaccines and masks and and all of

11718
04:05:38,090 --> 04:05:38,100
of vaccines and masks and and all of
 

11719
04:05:38,100 --> 04:05:39,590
of vaccines and masks and and all of
those things

11720
04:05:39,590 --> 04:05:39,600
those things
 

11721
04:05:39,600 --> 04:05:42,349
those things
um but if we don't hear other people we

11722
04:05:42,349 --> 04:05:42,359
um but if we don't hear other people we
 

11723
04:05:42,359 --> 04:05:43,969
um but if we don't hear other people we
don't let if we don't let them hear

11724
04:05:43,969 --> 04:05:43,979
don't let if we don't let them hear
 

11725
04:05:43,979 --> 04:05:47,570
don't let if we don't let them hear
their voice in the conversation if it's

11726
04:05:47,570 --> 04:05:47,580
their voice in the conversation if it's
 

11727
04:05:47,580 --> 04:05:49,189
their voice in the conversation if it's
just saying well you may think this and

11728
04:05:49,189 --> 04:05:49,199
just saying well you may think this and
 

11729
04:05:49,199 --> 04:05:50,710
just saying well you may think this and
here's why it's wrong

11730
04:05:50,710 --> 04:05:50,720
here's why it's wrong
 

11731
04:05:50,720 --> 04:05:52,969
here's why it's wrong
the argument may be right it'll just

11732
04:05:52,969 --> 04:05:52,979
the argument may be right it'll just
 

11733
04:05:52,979 --> 04:05:54,769
the argument may be right it'll just
never break through by the way my

11734
04:05:54,769 --> 04:05:54,779
never break through by the way my
 

11735
04:05:54,779 --> 04:05:56,510
never break through by the way my
interpretation of Joe and Sanjay I

11736
04:05:56,510 --> 04:05:56,520
interpretation of Joe and Sanjay I
 

11737
04:05:56,520 --> 04:05:57,710
interpretation of Joe and Sanjay I
listened to that conversation without

11738
04:05:57,710 --> 04:05:57,720
listened to that conversation without
 

11739
04:05:57,720 --> 04:06:00,530
listened to that conversation without
looking at Twitter or the internet and I

11740
04:06:00,530 --> 04:06:00,540
looking at Twitter or the internet and I
 

11741
04:06:00,540 --> 04:06:01,790
looking at Twitter or the internet and I
thought that was a great conversation

11742
04:06:01,790 --> 04:06:01,800
thought that was a great conversation
 

11743
04:06:01,800 --> 04:06:04,189
thought that was a great conversation
and I thought Sanji actually really

11744
04:06:04,189 --> 04:06:04,199
and I thought Sanji actually really
 

11745
04:06:04,199 --> 04:06:05,450
and I thought Sanji actually really
succeeded at bringing the temperature

11746
04:06:05,450 --> 04:06:05,460
succeeded at bringing the temperature
 

11747
04:06:05,460 --> 04:06:07,610
succeeded at bringing the temperature
down to me the goal was bringing the

11748
04:06:07,610 --> 04:06:07,620
down to me the goal was bringing the
 

11749
04:06:07,620 --> 04:06:09,349
down to me the goal was bringing the
temperature down I didn't even think of

11750
04:06:09,349 --> 04:06:09,359
temperature down I didn't even think of
 

11751
04:06:09,359 --> 04:06:11,450
temperature down I didn't even think of
it as a debate I was like oh cool this

11752
04:06:11,450 --> 04:06:11,460
it as a debate I was like oh cool this
 

11753
04:06:11,460 --> 04:06:13,550
it as a debate I was like oh cool this
isn't going to be some weird it's like

11754
04:06:13,550 --> 04:06:13,560
isn't going to be some weird it's like
 

11755
04:06:13,560 --> 04:06:15,650
isn't going to be some weird it's like
two friendly people talking and then I

11756
04:06:15,650 --> 04:06:15,660
two friendly people talking and then I
 

11757
04:06:15,660 --> 04:06:17,510
two friendly people talking and then I
look at the internet and then the

11758
04:06:17,510 --> 04:06:17,520
look at the internet and then the
 

11759
04:06:17,520 --> 04:06:20,510
look at the internet and then the
internet says Joe Rogan slams such like

11760
04:06:20,510 --> 04:06:20,520
internet says Joe Rogan slams such like
 

11761
04:06:20,520 --> 04:06:23,689
internet says Joe Rogan slams such like
like I said as if it was a heated debate

11762
04:06:23,689 --> 04:06:23,699
like I said as if it was a heated debate
 

11763
04:06:23,699 --> 04:06:25,570
like I said as if it was a heated debate
that Joe won and it's like all right

11764
04:06:25,570 --> 04:06:25,580
that Joe won and it's like all right
 

11765
04:06:25,580 --> 04:06:28,250
that Joe won and it's like all right
it's really the temperature being

11766
04:06:28,250 --> 04:06:28,260
it's really the temperature being
 

11767
04:06:28,260 --> 04:06:29,809
it's really the temperature being
brought down

11768
04:06:29,809 --> 04:06:29,819
brought down
 

11769
04:06:29,819 --> 04:06:32,150
brought down
real conversation with your two humans

11770
04:06:32,150 --> 04:06:32,160
real conversation with your two humans
 

11771
04:06:32,160 --> 04:06:34,969
real conversation with your two humans
that wasn't really a debate it was just

11772
04:06:34,969 --> 04:06:34,979
that wasn't really a debate it was just
 

11773
04:06:34,979 --> 04:06:37,670
that wasn't really a debate it was just
a conversation yeah and that was a

11774
04:06:37,670 --> 04:06:37,680
a conversation yeah and that was a
 

11775
04:06:37,680 --> 04:06:39,349
a conversation yeah and that was a
success yeah and I definitely think it

11776
04:06:39,349 --> 04:06:39,359
success yeah and I definitely think it
 

11777
04:06:39,359 --> 04:06:43,070
success yeah and I definitely think it
was a success but I also felt

11778
04:06:43,070 --> 04:06:43,080
was a success but I also felt
 

11779
04:06:43,080 --> 04:06:44,510
was a success but I also felt
um that

11780
04:06:44,510 --> 04:06:44,520
um that
 

11781
04:06:44,520 --> 04:06:45,229
um that
um

11782
04:06:45,229 --> 04:06:45,239
um
 

11783
04:06:45,239 --> 04:06:48,769
um
that a a takeaway and again this isn't

11784
04:06:48,769 --> 04:06:48,779
that a a takeaway and again this isn't
 

11785
04:06:48,779 --> 04:06:50,689
that a a takeaway and again this isn't
because this is something that I don't

11786
04:06:50,689 --> 04:06:50,699
because this is something that I don't
 

11787
04:06:50,699 --> 04:06:52,729
because this is something that I don't
agree with even though I have great as

11788
04:06:52,729 --> 04:06:52,739
agree with even though I have great as
 

11789
04:06:52,739 --> 04:06:54,889
agree with even though I have great as
I've said respect for Joe I think a

11790
04:06:54,889 --> 04:06:54,899
I've said respect for Joe I think a
 

11791
04:06:54,899 --> 04:06:57,530
I've said respect for Joe I think a
reasonable person listening to that

11792
04:06:57,530 --> 04:06:57,540
reasonable person listening to that
 

11793
04:06:57,540 --> 04:06:59,809
reasonable person listening to that
conversation would come away with the

11794
04:06:59,809 --> 04:06:59,819
conversation would come away with the
 

11795
04:06:59,819 --> 04:07:01,790
conversation would come away with the
conclusion that

11796
04:07:01,790 --> 04:07:01,800
conclusion that
 

11797
04:07:01,800 --> 04:07:04,010
conclusion that
um all in all these vaccines are a good

11798
04:07:04,010 --> 04:07:04,020
um all in all these vaccines are a good
 

11799
04:07:04,020 --> 04:07:05,210
um all in all these vaccines are a good
thing

11800
04:07:05,210 --> 04:07:05,220
thing
 

11801
04:07:05,220 --> 04:07:08,630
thing
um but if you're young and healthy

11802
04:07:08,630 --> 04:07:08,640
um but if you're young and healthy
 

11803
04:07:08,640 --> 04:07:11,689
um but if you're young and healthy
um You probably don't need it and I just

11804
04:07:11,689 --> 04:07:11,699
um You probably don't need it and I just
 

11805
04:07:11,699 --> 04:07:13,010
um You probably don't need it and I just
felt that

11806
04:07:13,010 --> 04:07:13,020
felt that
 

11807
04:07:13,020 --> 04:07:16,130
felt that
um that there was a stronger case to be

11808
04:07:16,130 --> 04:07:16,140
um that there was a stronger case to be
 

11809
04:07:16,140 --> 04:07:17,630
um that there was a stronger case to be
made even though Sanjay made it it

11810
04:07:17,630 --> 04:07:17,640
made even though Sanjay made it it
 

11811
04:07:17,640 --> 04:07:19,729
made even though Sanjay made it it
wasn't that Sanjay didn't make it it was

11812
04:07:19,729 --> 04:07:19,739
wasn't that Sanjay didn't make it it was
 

11813
04:07:19,739 --> 04:07:20,929
wasn't that Sanjay didn't make it it was
just that in the flow of that

11814
04:07:20,929 --> 04:07:20,939
just that in the flow of that
 

11815
04:07:20,939 --> 04:07:24,530
just that in the flow of that
conversation I felt that the case for

11816
04:07:24,530 --> 04:07:24,540
conversation I felt that the case for
 

11817
04:07:24,540 --> 04:07:27,830
conversation I felt that the case for
the vaccines and the vaccines both as an

11818
04:07:27,830 --> 04:07:27,840
the vaccines and the vaccines both as an
 

11819
04:07:27,840 --> 04:07:29,750
the vaccines and the vaccines both as an
individual Choice and then certainly

11820
04:07:29,750 --> 04:07:29,760
individual Choice and then certainly
 

11821
04:07:29,760 --> 04:07:31,670
individual Choice and then certainly
again as I as I said before I think that

11822
04:07:31,670 --> 04:07:31,680
again as I as I said before I think that
 

11823
04:07:31,680 --> 04:07:34,189
again as I as I said before I think that
well people can be afraid of the

11824
04:07:34,189 --> 04:07:34,199
well people can be afraid of the
 

11825
04:07:34,199 --> 04:07:37,130
well people can be afraid of the
vaccines the virus itself is much

11826
04:07:37,130 --> 04:07:37,140
vaccines the virus itself is much
 

11827
04:07:37,140 --> 04:07:39,050
vaccines the virus itself is much
scarier and we're just we're seeing it

11828
04:07:39,050 --> 04:07:39,060
scarier and we're just we're seeing it
 

11829
04:07:39,060 --> 04:07:41,530
scarier and we're just we're seeing it
now in in real time now with these

11830
04:07:41,530 --> 04:07:41,540
now in in real time now with these
 

11831
04:07:41,540 --> 04:07:44,809
now in in real time now with these
variations and variants I just felt that

11832
04:07:44,809 --> 04:07:44,819
variations and variants I just felt that
 

11833
04:07:44,819 --> 04:07:47,510
variations and variants I just felt that
that was kind of the the rough takeaway

11834
04:07:47,510 --> 04:07:47,520
that was kind of the the rough takeaway
 

11835
04:07:47,520 --> 04:07:50,389
that was kind of the the rough takeaway
from that conversation

11836
04:07:50,389 --> 04:07:50,399
from that conversation
 

11837
04:07:50,399 --> 04:07:52,910
from that conversation
um and I felt that that Sanjay again

11838
04:07:52,910 --> 04:07:52,920
um and I felt that that Sanjay again
 

11839
04:07:52,920 --> 04:07:55,670
um and I felt that that Sanjay again
whom I love I felt could have made his

11840
04:07:55,670 --> 04:07:55,680
whom I love I felt could have made his
 

11841
04:07:55,680 --> 04:07:57,710
whom I love I felt could have made his
case a little bit cheaper uh so the way

11842
04:07:57,710 --> 04:07:57,720
case a little bit cheaper uh so the way
 

11843
04:07:57,720 --> 04:08:00,050
case a little bit cheaper uh so the way
the thing he succeeded is he didn't come

11844
04:08:00,050 --> 04:08:00,060
the thing he succeeded is he didn't come
 

11845
04:08:00,060 --> 04:08:03,349
the thing he succeeded is he didn't come
off as uh like uh

11846
04:08:03,349 --> 04:08:03,359
off as uh like uh
 

11847
04:08:03,359 --> 04:08:06,530
off as uh like uh
a science expert looking down at

11848
04:08:06,530 --> 04:08:06,540
a science expert looking down at
 

11849
04:08:06,540 --> 04:08:08,990
a science expert looking down at
everybody talking down to everybody

11850
04:08:08,990 --> 04:08:09,000
everybody talking down to everybody
 

11851
04:08:09,000 --> 04:08:11,210
everybody talking down to everybody
so he succeeded in that yeah which is

11852
04:08:11,210 --> 04:08:11,220
so he succeeded in that yeah which is
 

11853
04:08:11,220 --> 04:08:14,330
so he succeeded in that yeah which is
very respectful but I also think sort of

11854
04:08:14,330 --> 04:08:14,340
very respectful but I also think sort of
 

11855
04:08:14,340 --> 04:08:16,429
very respectful but I also think sort of
making the case for taking the vaccine

11856
04:08:16,429 --> 04:08:16,439
making the case for taking the vaccine
 

11857
04:08:16,439 --> 04:08:18,290
making the case for taking the vaccine
where you when you're a young healthy

11858
04:08:18,290 --> 04:08:18,300
where you when you're a young healthy
 

11859

is like a high difficulty on the video
 

11865
04:08:25,140 --> 04:08:28,969
is like a high difficulty on the video
game level for sure so it's not a

11866
04:08:28,969 --> 04:08:28,979
game level for sure so it's not a
 

11867
04:08:28,979 --> 04:08:31,189
game level for sure so it's not a
it's difficult to do yeah it's difficult

11868

it's difficult to do yeah it's difficult
to do and also it's difficult to do

11870
04:08:32,870 --> 04:08:32,880
to do and also it's difficult to do
 

11871
04:08:32,880 --> 04:08:34,729
to do and also it's difficult to do
because it's not like

11872
04:08:34,729 --> 04:08:34,739
because it's not like
 

11873
04:08:34,739 --> 04:08:37,490
because it's not like
it's not a simple

11874
04:08:37,490 --> 04:08:37,500
it's not a simple
 

11875
04:08:37,500 --> 04:08:39,950
it's not a simple
as like look at the data there's a lot

11876
04:08:39,950 --> 04:08:39,960
as like look at the data there's a lot
 

11877
04:08:39,960 --> 04:08:43,189
as like look at the data there's a lot
of data to go through here yeah and

11878
04:08:43,189 --> 04:08:43,199
of data to go through here yeah and
 

11879
04:08:43,199 --> 04:08:45,590
of data to go through here yeah and
there's also a lot of non-data stuff

11880
04:08:45,590 --> 04:08:45,600
there's also a lot of non-data stuff
 

11881
04:08:45,600 --> 04:08:48,710
there's also a lot of non-data stuff
like the fact that first of all uh

11882
04:08:48,710 --> 04:08:48,720
like the fact that first of all uh
 

11883
04:08:48,720 --> 04:08:50,330
like the fact that first of all uh
questioning the sources of the data the

11884
04:08:50,330 --> 04:08:50,340
questioning the sources of the data the
 

11885
04:08:50,340 --> 04:08:53,030
questioning the sources of the data the
quality of the data because it's also

11886
04:08:53,030 --> 04:08:53,040
quality of the data because it's also
 

11887
04:08:53,040 --> 04:08:54,769
quality of the data because it's also
disappointing about covet is that the

11888
04:08:54,769 --> 04:08:54,779
disappointing about covet is that the
 

11889
04:08:54,779 --> 04:08:56,689
disappointing about covet is that the
quality of the data is not great but

11890
04:08:56,689 --> 04:08:56,699
quality of the data is not great but
 

11891
04:08:56,699 --> 04:08:58,250
quality of the data is not great but
also questioning

11892
04:08:58,250 --> 04:08:58,260
also questioning
 

11893
04:08:58,260 --> 04:09:01,250

mean vaccination is not just a public

11916
04:09:27,590 --> 04:09:27,600
mean vaccination is not just a public
 

11917
04:09:27,600 --> 04:09:30,229
mean vaccination is not just a public
health tool it's also a tool for a

11918
04:09:30,229 --> 04:09:30,239
health tool it's also a tool for a
 

11919
04:09:30,239 --> 04:09:32,269
health tool it's also a tool for a
government to gain more control over the

11920
04:09:32,269 --> 04:09:32,279
government to gain more control over the
 

11921
04:09:32,279 --> 04:09:33,349
government to gain more control over the
populace

11922
04:09:33,349 --> 04:09:33,359
populace
 

11923
04:09:33,359 --> 04:09:35,889
populace
like there's a lot of Truth to that too

11924
04:09:35,889 --> 04:09:35,899
like there's a lot of Truth to that too
 

11925
04:09:35,899 --> 04:09:39,830
like there's a lot of Truth to that too
things that have a lot of benefit

11926
04:09:39,830 --> 04:09:39,840
things that have a lot of benefit
 

11927
04:09:39,840 --> 04:09:44,330
things that have a lot of benefit
can also be used as a trojan horse to

11928
04:09:44,330 --> 04:09:44,340
can also be used as a trojan horse to
 

11929
04:09:44,340 --> 04:09:47,630
can also be used as a trojan horse to
increase bureaucracy and control but

11930
04:09:47,630 --> 04:09:47,640
increase bureaucracy and control but
 

11931
04:09:47,640 --> 04:09:49,670
increase bureaucracy and control but

collaboration between US and Soviet
 

11945

collaboration between US and Soviet
Union when the polio vaccine came out

11946

Union when the polio vaccine came out
 

11947
04:10:03,899 --> 04:10:05,570
Union when the polio vaccine came out
but there were people all around the

11948
04:10:05,570 --> 04:10:05,580
but there were people all around the
 

11949
04:10:05,580 --> 04:10:07,550
but there were people all around the
world who had a different life

11950
04:10:07,550 --> 04:10:07,560
world who had a different life
 

11951
04:10:07,560 --> 04:10:10,130
world who had a different life
trajectory no longer living in fear and

11952
04:10:10,130 --> 04:10:10,140
trajectory no longer living in fear and
 

11953
04:10:10,140 --> 04:10:12,110

all these people who were paralyzed or
 

11955
04:10:12,120 --> 04:10:15,170
all these people who were paralyzed or
killed from polio smallpox has been

11956
04:10:15,170 --> 04:10:15,180
killed from polio smallpox has been
 

11957
04:10:15,180 --> 04:10:17,450
killed from polio smallpox has been
eradicated it was one of the the great

11958
04:10:17,450 --> 04:10:17,460
eradicated it was one of the the great
 

11959
04:10:17,460 --> 04:10:21,170
eradicated it was one of the the great
successes in human history and while it

11960
04:10:21,170 --> 04:10:21,180
successes in human history and while it
 

11961
04:10:21,180 --> 04:10:23,030
successes in human history and while it
for sure is true that you could imagine

11962
04:10:23,030 --> 04:10:23,040
for sure is true that you could imagine
 

11963
04:10:23,040 --> 04:10:25,570
for sure is true that you could imagine
some kind of fraudulent

11964
04:10:25,570 --> 04:10:25,580
some kind of fraudulent
 

11965
04:10:25,580 --> 04:10:29,510
some kind of fraudulent
vaccination effort but here I genuinely

11966
04:10:29,510 --> 04:10:29,520
vaccination effort but here I genuinely
 

11967
04:10:29,520 --> 04:10:31,729
vaccination effort but here I genuinely
think I mean whatever the number 15

11968
04:10:31,729 --> 04:10:31,739
think I mean whatever the number 15
 

11969
04:10:31,739 --> 04:10:33,950
think I mean whatever the number 15
million 16 million is the economist

11970
04:10:33,950 --> 04:10:33,960
million 16 million is the economist
 

11971
04:10:33,960 --> 04:10:37,790
million 16 million is the economist
number of dead from uh covet 19. many

11972
04:10:37,790 --> 04:10:37,800
number of dead from uh covet 19. many
 

11973
04:10:37,800 --> 04:10:40,610
number of dead from uh covet 19. many
many more people would be dead but for

11974
04:10:40,610 --> 04:10:40,620
many more people would be dead but for
 

11975
04:10:40,620 --> 04:10:43,849
many more people would be dead but for
these vaccines and so I get that any

11976
04:10:43,849 --> 04:10:43,859
these vaccines and so I get that any
 

11977
04:10:43,859 --> 04:10:46,370
these vaccines and so I get that any
activity that needs to be coordinated by

11978
04:10:46,370 --> 04:10:46,380
activity that needs to be coordinated by
 

11979
04:10:46,380 --> 04:10:48,710
activity that needs to be coordinated by
a central government has the potential

11980
04:10:48,710 --> 04:10:48,720
a central government has the potential
 

11981
04:10:48,720 --> 04:10:51,290
a central government has the potential
to increase bureaucracy and increase

11982
04:10:51,290 --> 04:10:51,300
to increase bureaucracy and increase
 

11983
04:10:51,300 --> 04:10:53,450
to increase bureaucracy and increase
control

11984
04:10:53,450 --> 04:10:53,460
control
 

11985
04:10:53,460 --> 04:10:55,670
control
but there are certain things that

11986
04:10:55,670 --> 04:10:55,680
but there are certain things that
 

11987
04:10:55,680 --> 04:10:58,790
but there are certain things that
Central governments do like the

11988
04:10:58,790 --> 04:10:58,800
Central governments do like the
 

11989
04:10:58,800 --> 04:11:00,530
Central governments do like the
development particularly these mRNA

11990
04:11:00,530 --> 04:11:00,540
development particularly these mRNA
 

11991
04:11:00,540 --> 04:11:03,530
development particularly these mRNA
vaccines which it's it's purely a a U.S

11992
04:11:03,530 --> 04:11:03,540
vaccines which it's it's purely a a U.S
 

11993
04:11:03,540 --> 04:11:06,769
vaccines which it's it's purely a a U.S
government Victory I mean it was a huge

government Victory I mean it was a huge
 

11995
04:11:06,779 --> 04:11:10,189

disease NIH funding I mean this was a

12000
04:11:14,570 --> 04:11:14,580
disease NIH funding I mean this was a
 

12001
04:11:14,580 --> 04:11:16,790
disease NIH funding I mean this was a
public-private partnership throughout

12002
04:11:16,790 --> 04:11:16,800
public-private partnership throughout
 

12003
04:11:16,800 --> 04:11:20,269
public-private partnership throughout
and that we got a a working vaccine in

12004
04:11:20,269 --> 04:11:20,279
and that we got a a working vaccine in
 

12005
04:11:20,279 --> 04:11:22,130
and that we got a a working vaccine in
11 months was a miracle so it's not

12006
04:11:22,130 --> 04:11:22,140
11 months was a miracle so it's not
 

12007
04:11:22,140 --> 04:11:23,870
11 months was a miracle so it's not
purely a victory

12008
04:11:23,870 --> 04:11:23,880
purely a victory
 

12009
04:11:23,880 --> 04:11:26,809
purely a victory

04:11:29,330 --> 04:11:29,340
I'm I'm with you here playing a bit of
 

12013
04:11:29,340 --> 04:11:31,490
I'm I'm with you here playing a bit of
Devil's Advocate but the people who

12014
04:11:31,490 --> 04:11:31,500
Devil's Advocate but the people who
 

12015
04:11:31,500 --> 04:11:33,290
Devil's Advocate but the people who
discuss any viral drugs that got them

12016
04:11:33,290 --> 04:11:33,300
discuss any viral drugs that got them
 

12017
04:11:33,300 --> 04:11:35,450
discuss any viral drugs that got them
acting and other Alternatives would say

12018
04:11:35,450 --> 04:11:35,460
acting and other Alternatives would say
 

12019
04:11:35,460 --> 04:11:38,870
acting and other Alternatives would say
that the extreme focus on the vaccine

12020
04:11:38,870 --> 04:11:38,880
that the extreme focus on the vaccine
 

12021
04:11:38,880 --> 04:11:40,790
that the extreme focus on the vaccine
distracted us from considering other

12022
04:11:40,790 --> 04:11:40,800
distracted us from considering other
 

12023
04:11:40,800 --> 04:11:43,910
distracted us from considering other
possibilities and saying that this is

12024
04:11:43,910 --> 04:11:43,920
possibilities and saying that this is
 

12025
04:11:43,920 --> 04:11:45,889
possibilities and saying that this is
purely a success

12026
04:11:45,889 --> 04:11:45,899
purely a success
 

12027
04:11:45,899 --> 04:11:48,530
purely a success
is distracting from the story that there

12028
04:11:48,530 --> 04:11:48,540
is distracting from the story that there
 

12029
04:11:48,540 --> 04:11:51,290
is distracting from the story that there
could have been other Solutions so yes

12030
04:11:51,290 --> 04:11:51,300
could have been other Solutions so yes
 

12031
04:11:51,300 --> 04:11:54,050
could have been other Solutions so yes
it's a huge success that the vaccine was

12032
04:11:54,050 --> 04:11:54,060
it's a huge success that the vaccine was
 

12033
04:11:54,060 --> 04:11:55,870
it's a huge success that the vaccine was
developed so quickly

12034
04:11:55,870 --> 04:11:55,880
developed so quickly
 

12035
04:11:55,880 --> 04:11:58,969
developed so quickly
and surprisingly way more effective than

12036
04:11:58,969 --> 04:11:58,979
and surprisingly way more effective than
 

12037
04:11:58,979 --> 04:12:02,090
and surprisingly way more effective than
it was hoped for

12038
04:12:02,090 --> 04:12:02,100
it was hoped for
 

12039
04:12:02,100 --> 04:12:03,710
it was hoped for
but there could have been other

12040
04:12:03,710 --> 04:12:03,720
but there could have been other
 

12041
04:12:03,720 --> 04:12:05,330
but there could have been other
Solutions and they're completely

12042
04:12:05,330 --> 04:12:05,340
Solutions and they're completely
 

12043
04:12:05,340 --> 04:12:09,050
Solutions and they're completely
distracted from us from that in fact it

12044
04:12:09,050 --> 04:12:09,060
distracted from us from that in fact it
 

12045
04:12:09,060 --> 04:12:11,269
distracted from us from that in fact it
distracted us from looking into a bunch

12046
04:12:11,269 --> 04:12:11,279
distracted us from looking into a bunch
 

12047
04:12:11,279 --> 04:12:13,670
distracted us from looking into a bunch
of things like the lab leak and that so

12048
04:12:13,670 --> 04:12:13,680
of things like the lab leak and that so
 

12049
04:12:13,680 --> 04:12:16,370
of things like the lab leak and that so
it's not a pure Victory and fair enough

12050
04:12:16,370 --> 04:12:16,380
it's not a pure Victory and fair enough
 

12051
04:12:16,380 --> 04:12:17,689
it's not a pure Victory and fair enough
and there's a lot of people that

12052
04:12:17,689 --> 04:12:17,699
and there's a lot of people that
 

12053
04:12:17,699 --> 04:12:19,429
and there's a lot of people that
criticize the overreach of government

12054
04:12:19,429 --> 04:12:19,439
criticize the overreach of government
 

12055
04:12:19,439 --> 04:12:21,530
criticize the overreach of government
and all of this that one of the things

12056
04:12:21,530 --> 04:12:21,540
and all of this that one of the things
 

12057
04:12:21,540 --> 04:12:24,410
and all of this that one of the things
that makes the United States great

12058
04:12:24,410 --> 04:12:24,420
that makes the United States great
 

12059
04:12:24,420 --> 04:12:28,729
that makes the United States great
is the individualism and the hesitancy

12060
04:12:28,729 --> 04:12:28,739
is the individualism and the hesitancy
 

12061
04:12:28,739 --> 04:12:31,429
is the individualism and the hesitancy
to ideas of mandates

12062
04:12:31,429 --> 04:12:31,439
to ideas of mandates
 

12063
04:12:31,439 --> 04:12:34,309
to ideas of mandates
even if the mandates on mass will have a

12064
04:12:34,309 --> 04:12:34,319
even if the mandates on mass will have a
 

12065
04:12:34,319 --> 04:12:37,450
even if the mandates on mass will have a
positive even strongly positive result

12066
04:12:37,450 --> 04:12:37,460
positive even strongly positive result
 

12067
04:12:37,460 --> 04:12:41,570
positive even strongly positive result
the Americans many Americans will still

12068
04:12:41,570 --> 04:12:41,580
the Americans many Americans will still
 

12069
04:12:41,580 --> 04:12:42,889
the Americans many Americans will still
say no

12070
04:12:42,889 --> 04:12:42,899
say no
 

12071
04:12:42,899 --> 04:12:46,849
say no
because in the long Arc of History

12072
04:12:46,849 --> 04:12:46,859
because in the long Arc of History
 

12073
04:12:46,859 --> 04:12:49,309
because in the long Arc of History
saying no in that moment will actually

12074
04:12:49,309 --> 04:12:49,319
saying no in that moment will actually
 

12075
04:12:49,319 --> 04:12:52,849
saying no in that moment will actually
lead to a better country and a better

12076
04:12:52,849 --> 04:12:52,859
lead to a better country and a better
 

12077
04:12:52,859 --> 04:12:56,330
lead to a better country and a better
world so that's a messed up aspect of

12078
04:12:56,330 --> 04:12:56,340
world so that's a messed up aspect of
 

12079
04:12:56,340 --> 04:12:59,750
world so that's a messed up aspect of
America but it's also a beautiful part

12080
04:12:59,750 --> 04:12:59,760
America but it's also a beautiful part
 

12081
04:12:59,760 --> 04:13:03,710
America but it's also a beautiful part
we're skeptical even about good things

12082
04:13:03,710 --> 04:13:03,720
we're skeptical even about good things
 

12083
04:13:03,720 --> 04:13:06,950
we're skeptical even about good things
I I agree and and certainly

12084
04:13:06,950 --> 04:13:06,960
I I agree and and certainly
 

12085
04:13:06,960 --> 04:13:08,689
I I agree and and certainly
um we should all be cautious about

12086
04:13:08,689 --> 04:13:08,699
um we should all be cautious about
 

12087
04:13:08,699 --> 04:13:12,050
um we should all be cautious about
government overreach absolutely and it

12088
04:13:12,050 --> 04:13:12,060
government overreach absolutely and it
 

12089
04:13:12,060 --> 04:13:14,929
government overreach absolutely and it
happens in all kinds of scenarios with

12090
04:13:14,929 --> 04:13:14,939
happens in all kinds of scenarios with
 

12091
04:13:14,939 --> 04:13:17,630
happens in all kinds of scenarios with
incarceration with a thousand things and

12092
04:13:17,630 --> 04:13:17,640
incarceration with a thousand things and
 

12093
04:13:17,640 --> 04:13:19,750
incarceration with a thousand things and
we also should be afraid of government

12094
04:13:19,750 --> 04:13:19,760
we also should be afraid of government
 

12095
04:13:19,760 --> 04:13:22,189
we also should be afraid of government
underreach that if there is a problem

12096
04:13:22,189 --> 04:13:22,199
underreach that if there is a problem
 

12097
04:13:22,199 --> 04:13:24,889
underreach that if there is a problem
that could be solved by governments and

12098
04:13:24,889 --> 04:13:24,899
that could be solved by governments and
 

12099
04:13:24,899 --> 04:13:26,510
that could be solved by governments and
that's why we have governments in the

12100
04:13:26,510 --> 04:13:26,520
that's why we have governments in the
 

12101
04:13:26,520 --> 04:13:28,010
that's why we have governments in the
first place is that they're just certain

12102
04:13:28,010 --> 04:13:28,020
first place is that they're just certain
 

12103
04:13:28,020 --> 04:13:30,649
first place is that they're just certain
things that individuals can't do on

12104
04:13:30,649 --> 04:13:30,659
things that individuals can't do on
 

12105
04:13:30,659 --> 04:13:33,229
things that individuals can't do on
their own and that's why we we pool our

12106
04:13:33,229 --> 04:13:33,239
their own and that's why we we pool our
 

12107
04:13:33,239 --> 04:13:36,710
their own and that's why we we pool our
resources and we in some ways sacrifice

12108
04:13:36,710 --> 04:13:36,720
resources and we in some ways sacrifice
 

12109
04:13:36,720 --> 04:13:39,349
resources and we in some ways sacrifice
our rights for this common thing and

12110
04:13:39,349 --> 04:13:39,359
our rights for this common thing and
 

12111
04:13:39,359 --> 04:13:41,210
our rights for this common thing and
that's why we don't have hopefully

12112
04:13:41,210 --> 04:13:41,220
that's why we don't have hopefully
 

12113
04:13:41,220 --> 04:13:43,309
that's why we don't have hopefully
people murderers marauding or people

12114
04:13:43,309 --> 04:13:43,319
people murderers marauding or people
 

12115
04:13:43,319 --> 04:13:45,649
people murderers marauding or people
driving 200 miles down the street that

12116
04:13:45,649 --> 04:13:45,659
driving 200 miles down the street that
 

12117
04:13:45,659 --> 04:13:48,649
driving 200 miles down the street that
we we have a process for arriving at a

12118
04:13:48,649 --> 04:13:48,659
we we have a process for arriving at a
 

12119
04:13:48,659 --> 04:13:51,229
we we have a process for arriving at a
set of of common rules and so while I

12120
04:13:51,229 --> 04:13:51,239
set of of common rules and so while I
 

12121
04:13:51,239 --> 04:13:52,849
set of of common rules and so while I
fully agree that we need to respect and

12122
04:13:52,849 --> 04:13:52,859
fully agree that we need to respect and
 

12123
04:13:52,859 --> 04:13:54,769
fully agree that we need to respect and
we need to listen

12124
04:13:54,769 --> 04:13:54,779
we need to listen
 

12125
04:13:54,779 --> 04:13:56,450
we need to listen
um we need to find that right balance

12126
04:13:56,450 --> 04:13:56,460
um we need to find that right balance
 

12127
04:13:56,460 --> 04:13:58,610
um we need to find that right balance
and you've raised the magic I word

12128
04:13:58,610 --> 04:13:58,620
and you've raised the magic I word
 

12129
04:13:58,620 --> 04:14:00,469
and you've raised the magic I word
Ivermectin

12130
04:14:00,469 --> 04:14:00,479
Ivermectin
 

12131
04:14:00,479 --> 04:14:04,490
Ivermectin
um and so in Ivermectin like my view has

12132
04:14:04,490 --> 04:14:04,500
um and so in Ivermectin like my view has
 

12133
04:14:04,500 --> 04:14:06,110
um and so in Ivermectin like my view has
always been

12134
04:14:06,110 --> 04:14:06,120
always been
 

12135
04:14:06,120 --> 04:14:08,389
always been
um Ivermectin could be effective it

12136
04:14:08,389 --> 04:14:08,399
um Ivermectin could be effective it
 

12137
04:14:08,399 --> 04:14:10,849
um Ivermectin could be effective it
could not be effective let's study it

12138
04:14:10,849 --> 04:14:10,859
could not be effective let's study it
 

12139
04:14:10,859 --> 04:14:12,830
could not be effective let's study it
through a full process and when you had

12140
04:14:12,830 --> 04:14:12,840
through a full process and when you had
 

12141
04:14:12,840 --> 04:14:15,410
through a full process and when you had
Francis Collins with you even while he

12142
04:14:15,410 --> 04:14:15,420
Francis Collins with you even while he
 

12143
04:14:15,420 --> 04:14:18,830
Francis Collins with you even while he
was making up stories about this um this

12144
04:14:18,830 --> 04:14:18,840
was making up stories about this um this
 

12145
04:14:18,840 --> 04:14:19,910
was making up stories about this um this
wrestler

12146
04:14:19,910 --> 04:14:19,920
wrestler
 

12147
04:14:19,920 --> 04:14:23,149
wrestler
um he was saying exactly but he was he

12148
04:14:23,149 --> 04:14:23,159
um he was saying exactly but he was he
 

12149
04:14:23,159 --> 04:14:25,490
um he was saying exactly but he was he
was saying that they're going to do a

12150
04:14:25,490 --> 04:14:25,500
was saying that they're going to do a
 

12151
04:14:25,500 --> 04:14:27,830
was saying that they're going to do a
full randomized highest level trial of

12152
04:14:27,830 --> 04:14:27,840
full randomized highest level trial of
 

12153
04:14:27,840 --> 04:14:30,410
full randomized highest level trial of
ivermectin and if Ivermectin works then

12154
04:14:30,410 --> 04:14:30,420
ivermectin and if Ivermectin works then
 

12155
04:14:30,420 --> 04:14:32,389
ivermectin and if Ivermectin works then
that's another tool in our in our

12156
04:14:32,389 --> 04:14:32,399
that's another tool in our in our
 

12157
04:14:32,399 --> 04:14:34,429
that's another tool in our in our
toolbox and I think we we should and and

12158
04:14:34,429 --> 04:14:34,439
toolbox and I think we we should and and
 

12159
04:14:34,439 --> 04:14:36,469
toolbox and I think we we should and and
I think that in that Sanjay was

12160
04:14:36,469 --> 04:14:36,479
I think that in that Sanjay was
 

12161
04:14:36,479 --> 04:14:39,050
I think that in that Sanjay was
absolutely correct to concede the point

12162
04:14:39,050 --> 04:14:39,060
absolutely correct to concede the point
 

12163
04:14:39,060 --> 04:14:40,729
absolutely correct to concede the point
to Joe

12164
04:14:40,729 --> 04:14:40,739
to Joe
 

12165
04:14:40,739 --> 04:14:43,130
to Joe
um that it was disingenuous for people

12166
04:14:43,130 --> 04:14:43,140
um that it was disingenuous for people
 

12167

a great question and I know that you are
 

12239
04:16:09,239 --> 04:16:11,750
a great question and I know that you are
also kind of exploring the limits of the

12240
04:16:11,750 --> 04:16:11,760
also kind of exploring the limits of the
 

12241
04:16:11,760 --> 04:16:14,030
also kind of exploring the limits of the
physical and so for me and doing the

12242
04:16:14,030 --> 04:16:14,040
physical and so for me and doing the
 

12243
04:16:14,040 --> 04:16:17,570
physical and so for me and doing the
Iron Mans and the ultra marathons it's

12244
04:16:17,570 --> 04:16:17,580
Iron Mans and the ultra marathons it's
 

12245
04:16:17,580 --> 04:16:20,330
Iron Mans and the ultra marathons it's
always the same kind of lesson

12246
04:16:20,330 --> 04:16:20,340
always the same kind of lesson
 

12247
04:16:20,340 --> 04:16:23,990
always the same kind of lesson
um which is just when you think you have

12248
04:16:23,990 --> 04:16:24,000
um which is just when you think you have
 

12249
04:16:24,000 --> 04:16:27,410
um which is just when you think you have
nothing left you actually have a ton

12250
04:16:27,410 --> 04:16:27,420
nothing left you actually have a ton
 

12251
04:16:27,420 --> 04:16:29,990
nothing left you actually have a ton
left there are a lot of resources that

12252
04:16:29,990 --> 04:16:30,000
left there are a lot of resources that
 

12253
04:16:30,000 --> 04:16:31,010
left there are a lot of resources that
are there

12254
04:16:31,010 --> 04:16:31,020
are there
 

12255
04:16:31,020 --> 04:16:35,030
are there
if you call on them and the ability to

12256
04:16:35,030 --> 04:16:35,040
if you call on them and the ability to
 

12257
04:16:35,040 --> 04:16:38,450
if you call on them and the ability to
call on them has to be cultivated it

12258
04:16:38,450 --> 04:16:38,460
call on them has to be cultivated it
 

12259
04:16:38,460 --> 04:16:41,210
call on them has to be cultivated it
really and so for me especially in the

12260
04:16:41,210 --> 04:16:41,220
really and so for me especially in the
 

12261
04:16:41,220 --> 04:16:43,550
really and so for me especially in the
the Iron Man and Iron Man in many ways

12262
04:16:43,550 --> 04:16:43,560
the Iron Man and Iron Man in many ways
 

12263
04:16:43,560 --> 04:16:45,469
the Iron Man and Iron Man in many ways
is is harder than the the ultra

12264
04:16:45,469 --> 04:16:45,479
is is harder than the the ultra
 

12265
04:16:45,479 --> 04:16:47,269
is is harder than the the ultra
marathons because it'll be it I mean

12266
04:16:47,269 --> 04:16:47,279
marathons because it'll be it I mean
 

12267
04:16:47,279 --> 04:16:49,309
marathons because it'll be it I mean
it's 140 miles I'll be at a hundred and

12268
04:16:49,309 --> 04:16:49,319
it's 140 miles I'll be at a hundred and
 

12269
04:16:49,319 --> 04:16:51,410
it's 140 miles I'll be at a hundred and
mile 120

12270
04:16:51,410 --> 04:16:51,420
mile 120
 

12271
04:16:51,420 --> 04:16:53,510
mile 120
um having done the swim and then the

12272
04:16:53,510 --> 04:16:53,520
um having done the swim and then the
 

12273
04:16:53,520 --> 04:16:55,570
um having done the swim and then the
bike and I'll be whatever

12274
04:16:55,570 --> 04:16:55,580

12275
04:16:55,580 --> 04:16:59,870
bike and I'll be whatever
six miles into the run and I'll think I

12276
04:16:59,870 --> 04:16:59,880
six miles into the run and I'll think I
 

12277
04:16:59,880 --> 04:17:03,290
six miles into the run and I'll think I
feel like [\h__\h] I have nothing left how

12278
04:17:03,290 --> 04:17:03,300
feel like [\h__\h] I have nothing left how
 

12279
04:17:03,300 --> 04:17:07,490
feel like [\h__\h] I have nothing left how
am I possibly gonna run 20 miles more

12280
04:17:07,490 --> 04:17:07,500
am I possibly gonna run 20 miles more
 

12281
04:17:07,500 --> 04:17:11,030
am I possibly gonna run 20 miles more
but there's there's always more and I

12282
04:17:11,030 --> 04:17:11,040
but there's there's always more and I

04:17:11,040 --> 04:17:14,090
but there's there's always more and I
and I think that for me these extreme

12284
04:17:14,090 --> 04:17:14,100
and I think that for me these extreme
 

12285
04:17:14,100 --> 04:17:15,290
and I think that for me these extreme
sports

12286
04:17:15,290 --> 04:17:15,300
sports
 

12287
04:17:15,300 --> 04:17:19,070
sports
are my process of exploring

12288
04:17:19,070 --> 04:17:19,080
are my process of exploring
 

12289
04:17:19,080 --> 04:17:21,590
are my process of exploring
what is what's possible and I feel like

12290
04:17:21,590 --> 04:17:21,600
what is what's possible and I feel like
 

12291
04:17:21,600 --> 04:17:25,610
what is what's possible and I feel like
it applies in so many different areas of

12292
04:17:25,610 --> 04:17:25,620
it applies in so many different areas of
 

12293
04:17:25,620 --> 04:17:28,610
it applies in so many different areas of
life where you're kind of pushing and it

12294
04:17:28,610 --> 04:17:28,620
life where you're kind of pushing and it

are are communicating
 

12515
04:21:48,600 --> 04:21:50,330
are are communicating
um but I think if he's kind of little by

04:21:50,330 --> 04:21:50,340
um but I think if he's kind of little by
 

12517
04:21:50,340 --> 04:21:54,229
um but I think if he's kind of little by
little magic is is possible and and what

12518
04:21:54,229 --> 04:21:54,239
little magic is is possible and and what
 

12519
04:21:54,239 --> 04:21:56,269
little magic is is possible and and what
I will say is some I also do I've done

people who do 500 Mile races the ones

12530
04:22:08,090 --> 04:22:08,100
people who do 500 Mile races the ones
 

12531
04:22:08,100 --> 04:22:11,269
people who do 500 Mile races the ones
that I do are 50k Mountain Trail runs

12532
04:22:11,269 --> 04:22:11,279
that I do are 50k Mountain Trail runs
 

12533
04:22:11,279 --> 04:22:13,790
that I do are 50k Mountain Trail runs
which is is 32 miles so it's I do the

12534
04:22:13,790 --> 04:22:13,800
which is is 32 miles so it's I do the
 

12535
04:22:13,800 --> 04:22:17,090
which is is 32 miles so it's I do the
kind of the easier side of um uh of

12536
04:22:17,090 --> 04:22:17,100
kind of the easier side of um uh of
 

12537
04:22:17,100 --> 04:22:19,070
kind of the easier side of um uh of
Ultras but it's actually much easier

12538
04:22:19,070 --> 04:22:19,080
Ultras but it's actually much easier
 

12539
04:22:19,080 --> 04:22:21,050
Ultras but it's actually much easier
than a marathon because you know some of

12540
04:22:21,050 --> 04:22:21,060
than a marathon because you know some of
 

12541
04:22:21,060 --> 04:22:22,969
than a marathon because you know some of
the mountain ones some sometimes it's so

12542
04:22:22,969 --> 04:22:22,979
the mountain ones some sometimes it's so
 

12543
04:22:22,979 --> 04:22:24,229
the mountain ones some sometimes it's so
steep

12544
04:22:24,229 --> 04:22:24,239
steep
 

12545
04:22:24,239 --> 04:22:26,510
steep
um that you can't uh you you have to

12546
04:22:26,510 --> 04:22:26,520
um that you can't uh you you have to
 

12547
04:22:26,520 --> 04:22:28,610
um that you can't uh you you have to
walk it because walking is faster than

12548
04:22:28,610 --> 04:22:28,620
walk it because walking is faster than
 

12549
04:22:28,620 --> 04:22:30,530
walk it because walking is faster than
than running and every you know four or

12550

than running and every you know four or
 

12551
04:22:30,540 --> 04:22:32,510
than running and every you know four or
five miles in the supported races you

12552
04:22:32,510 --> 04:22:32,520
five miles in the supported races you
 

12553
04:22:32,520 --> 04:22:35,210
five miles in the supported races you
stop and eat blintzes and boiled

12554
04:22:35,210 --> 04:22:35,220
stop and eat blintzes and boiled
 

12555
04:22:35,220 --> 04:22:36,530
stop and eat blintzes and boiled
potatoes it's actually quite enjoyable

12556
04:22:36,530 --> 04:22:36,540
potatoes it's actually quite enjoyable
 

12557
04:22:36,540 --> 04:22:39,410
potatoes it's actually quite enjoyable
but as I started to tell you when we

12558
04:22:39,410 --> 04:22:39,420
but as I started to tell you when we
 

12559
04:22:39,420 --> 04:22:41,929
but as I started to tell you when we
before we we went live

12560
04:22:41,929 --> 04:22:41,939
before we we went live
 

12561
04:22:41,939 --> 04:22:44,330
before we we went live
um so I've done for lots of years these

12562
04:22:44,330 --> 04:22:44,340
um so I've done for lots of years these
 

12563
04:22:44,340 --> 04:22:46,250
um so I've done for lots of years these
50k Mountain Trail runs and I was going

something else and I thought wouldn't it

12568
04:22:50,149 --> 04:22:50,159
something else and I thought wouldn't it
 

12569
04:22:50,159 --> 04:22:52,729
something else and I thought wouldn't it
be fun to to do an ultra marathon in

12570
04:22:52,729 --> 04:22:52,739
be fun to to do an ultra marathon in
 

12571
04:22:52,739 --> 04:22:54,649
be fun to to do an ultra marathon in
Taiwan I looked and that you know the

12622
04:23:45,950 --> 04:23:45,960
of string and so you had to hold on to
 

12623
04:23:45,960 --> 04:23:47,630
of string and so you had to hold on to
the string with one hand while it was in

04:23:55,309 --> 04:23:55,319
not just like a little stream like a
 

12631
04:23:55,319 --> 04:23:58,189
not just like a little stream like a
torrential River there were some things

12632
04:23:58,189 --> 04:23:58,199
torrential River there were some things
 

12633
04:23:58,199 --> 04:24:00,229
torrential River there were some things
where it was so steep

12634
04:24:00,229 --> 04:24:00,239
where it was so steep

04:24:03,349 --> 04:24:03,359
and then you'd slide all the way down
 

12639

04:24:32,809 --> 04:24:32,819
suddenly it wasn't really
 

12663
04:24:32,819 --> 04:24:35,269
suddenly it wasn't really
dark moments the biggest there was one

12664
04:24:35,269 --> 04:24:35,279
dark moments the biggest there was one
 

12665
04:24:35,279 --> 04:24:36,830
dark moments the biggest there was one
thing where I'd been running so long I

12666
04:24:36,830 --> 04:24:36,840
thing where I'd been running so long I
 

12667
04:24:36,840 --> 04:24:39,469
thing where I'd been running so long I
thought well I must almost be done and

12668
04:24:39,469 --> 04:24:39,479
thought well I must almost be done and
 

12669
04:24:39,479 --> 04:24:42,410

was also actually part of this TOA and
that was kind of more structured and it

12834
04:27:49,010 --> 04:27:49,020
that was kind of more structured and it
 

12835
04:27:49,020 --> 04:27:50,809
that was kind of more structured and it
was more sane because it was part of

04:27:50,809 --> 04:27:50,819
was more sane because it was part of
 

12837
04:27:50,819 --> 04:27:53,450

the earliest days of the pandemic I was
invited to give a talk on whether the

13182

invited to give a talk on whether the
 

13183

revolutions were a match for the uh the
 

13187
04:34:52,619 --> 04:34:55,070
revolutions were a match for the uh the
outbreak and my view was then as now

13188
04:34:55,070 --> 04:34:55,080
outbreak and my view was then as now
 

13189
04:34:55,080 --> 04:34:57,289
outbreak and my view was then as now
that the answer to that question is yes

13190
04:34:57,289 --> 04:34:57,299
that the answer to that question is yes
 

13191
04:34:57,299 --> 04:34:59,689
that the answer to that question is yes
but I woke up that morning and I felt

13192
04:34:59,689 --> 04:34:59,699
but I woke up that morning and I felt
 

13193
04:34:59,699 --> 04:35:02,330
but I woke up that morning and I felt
that that wasn't the most important talk

13194
04:35:02,330 --> 04:35:02,340
that that wasn't the most important talk
 

13195
04:35:02,340 --> 04:35:03,830
that that wasn't the most important talk
that I could give there was something

13196
04:35:03,830 --> 04:35:03,840
that I could give there was something
 

13197
04:35:03,840 --> 04:35:06,410
that I could give there was something
else that was more pressing for me and

13198
04:35:06,410 --> 04:35:06,420
else that was more pressing for me and
 

13199
04:35:06,420 --> 04:35:08,570
else that was more pressing for me and
that was the the realization they were

13200
04:35:08,570 --> 04:35:08,580
that was the the realization they were
 

13201
04:35:08,580 --> 04:35:10,189
that was the the realization they were
asking the question well why weren't we

13202
04:35:10,189 --> 04:35:10,199
asking the question well why weren't we
 

13203

asking the question well why weren't we
prepared for this pandemic because we

13204
04:35:12,709 --> 04:35:12,719
prepared for this pandemic because we
 

13205
04:35:12,719 --> 04:35:15,230
prepared for this pandemic because we
could have been we weren't

13206
04:35:15,230 --> 04:35:15,240
could have been we weren't
 

13207
04:35:15,240 --> 04:35:17,449

um and why can't and because of that why

13208
04:35:17,449 --> 04:35:17,459
um and why can't and because of that why
 

13209
04:35:17,459 --> 04:35:20,629
um and why can't and because of that why
can't we respond adequately uh to this

13210
04:35:20,629 --> 04:35:20,639
can't we respond adequately uh to this

miraculously overcome this pandemic it's
 

13219
04:35:30,119 --> 04:35:33,250
miraculously overcome this pandemic it's
a peric victory if we have if we don't

13220
04:35:33,250 --> 04:35:33,260
a peric victory if we have if we don't
 

13221

13222
04:35:35,990 --> 04:35:36,000
prepare ourselves to respond to the
 

13223
04:35:36,000 --> 04:35:37,490
prepare ourselves to respond to the
broader category of pandemics

13224
04:35:37,490 --> 04:35:37,500
broader category of pandemics
 

13225
04:35:37,500 --> 04:35:39,170
broader category of pandemics
particularly as we enter the age of

13226
04:35:39,170 --> 04:35:39,180
particularly as we enter the age of
 

13227
04:35:39,180 --> 04:35:41,769
particularly as we enter the age of
synthetic biology but if somehow

13228
04:35:41,769 --> 04:35:41,779
synthetic biology but if somehow
 

13229
04:35:41,779 --> 04:35:44,689
synthetic biology but if somehow
miraculously we solve that problem

13230
04:35:44,689 --> 04:35:44,699
miraculously we solve that problem
 

13231
04:35:44,699 --> 04:35:46,310
miraculously we solve that problem
but we don't solve the problem of

13232
04:35:46,310 --> 04:35:46,320
but we don't solve the problem of
 

13233
04:35:46,320 --> 04:35:48,289
but we don't solve the problem of
climate change well kind of who cares we

13234
04:35:48,289 --> 04:35:48,299
climate change well kind of who cares we
 

13235
04:35:48,299 --> 04:35:49,789
climate change well kind of who cares we
didn't have a pandemic but we wiped

13236
04:35:49,789 --> 04:35:49,799
didn't have a pandemic but we wiped
 

13237
04:35:49,799 --> 04:35:51,890
didn't have a pandemic but we wiped
everybody out from climate change and

13238
04:35:51,890 --> 04:35:51,900
everybody out from climate change and
 

13239
04:35:51,900 --> 04:35:53,510
everybody out from climate change and
let's just say

13240
04:35:53,510 --> 04:35:53,520
let's just say
 

13241
04:35:53,520 --> 04:35:55,310
let's just say
um you get where this is going that we

13242
04:35:55,310 --> 04:35:55,320
um you get where this is going that we
 

13243
04:35:55,320 --> 04:35:57,949
um you get where this is going that we
organize ourselves and we solve climate

13244
04:35:57,949 --> 04:35:57,959
organize ourselves and we solve climate
 

13245
04:35:57,959 --> 04:36:00,289
organize ourselves and we solve climate
change and then we have a nuclear war

13246
04:36:00,289 --> 04:36:00,299
change and then we have a nuclear war
 

13247
04:36:00,299 --> 04:36:02,570
change and then we have a nuclear war
because everybody's particularly China

13248
04:36:02,570 --> 04:36:02,580
because everybody's particularly China
 

13249
04:36:02,580 --> 04:36:05,449
because everybody's particularly China
now but U.S the former Soviet Union are

13250
04:36:05,449 --> 04:36:05,459
now but U.S the former Soviet Union are
 

13251
04:36:05,459 --> 04:36:07,310
now but U.S the former Soviet Union are
building all these nuclear weapons who

13252
04:36:07,310 --> 04:36:07,320
building all these nuclear weapons who
 

13253
04:36:07,320 --> 04:36:08,929
building all these nuclear weapons who
cares that we solved climate change

13254
04:36:08,929 --> 04:36:08,939
cares that we solved climate change
 

13255
04:36:08,939 --> 04:36:10,970
cares that we solved climate change
because we're all gone anyway and the

13256
04:36:10,970 --> 04:36:10,980
because we're all gone anyway and the
 

13257
04:36:10,980 --> 04:36:13,070
because we're all gone anyway and the
The Meta category bringing all those

13258
04:36:13,070 --> 04:36:13,080
The Meta category bringing all those
 

13259
04:36:13,080 --> 04:36:16,010
The Meta category bringing all those
things together was this mismatch

13260
04:36:16,010 --> 04:36:16,020
things together was this mismatch
 

13261
04:36:16,020 --> 04:36:20,150
things together was this mismatch
between the increasingly Global and

13262
04:36:20,150 --> 04:36:20,160
between the increasingly Global and
 

13263
04:36:20,160 --> 04:36:22,730
between the increasingly Global and
shared nature of the biggest challenges

13264
04:36:22,730 --> 04:36:22,740
shared nature of the biggest challenges
 

13265
04:36:22,740 --> 04:36:26,269
shared nature of the biggest challenges
that we face and our inability to solve

13266
04:36:26,269 --> 04:36:26,279
that we face and our inability to solve
 

13267
04:36:26,279 --> 04:36:29,810
that we face and our inability to solve
that entire category of problems and

13268
04:36:29,810 --> 04:36:29,820
that entire category of problems and
 

13269
04:36:29,820 --> 04:36:32,750
that entire category of problems and
there's a a historical issue which is

13270
04:36:32,750 --> 04:36:32,760
there's a a historical issue which is
 

13271
04:36:32,760 --> 04:36:35,750
there's a a historical issue which is
that prior to the 30 years war in the

13272
04:36:35,750 --> 04:36:35,760
that prior to the 30 years war in the
 

13273
04:36:35,760 --> 04:36:37,429
that prior to the 30 years war in the
17th century we had all these different

13274
04:36:37,429 --> 04:36:37,439
17th century we had all these different
 

13275
04:36:37,439 --> 04:36:40,010
17th century we had all these different
kinds of sovereignty and religious and

13276
04:36:40,010 --> 04:36:40,020
kinds of sovereignty and religious and
 

13277
04:36:40,020 --> 04:36:42,289
kinds of sovereignty and religious and
and different kinds of organizational

13278
04:36:42,289 --> 04:36:42,299
and different kinds of organizational
 

13279
04:36:42,299 --> 04:36:44,090
and different kinds of organizational
principles and everybody got in this war

13280
04:36:44,090 --> 04:36:44,100
principles and everybody got in this war
 

13281
04:36:44,100 --> 04:36:47,209
principles and everybody got in this war
and in this the series of treaties that

13282
04:36:47,209 --> 04:36:47,219
and in this the series of treaties that
 

13283
04:36:47,219 --> 04:36:49,310
and in this the series of treaties that
together are called the Peace of

together are called the Peace of
 

13285
04:36:49,320 --> 04:36:52,670
together are called the Peace of
Westphalia the the framework for the

04:36:52,670 --> 04:36:52,680
Westphalia the the framework for the
 

13287
04:36:52,680 --> 04:36:54,051
Westphalia the the framework for the
modern What We Now understand is the

13288
04:36:54,051 --> 04:36:54,061
modern What We Now understand is the
 

13289
04:36:54,061 --> 04:36:56,390
modern What We Now understand is the
modern nation state was late and then

13290
04:36:56,390 --> 04:36:56,400
modern nation state was late and then
 

13291
04:36:56,400 --> 04:36:58,910
modern nation state was late and then
through colonialism and other means that

13292
04:36:58,910 --> 04:36:58,920
through colonialism and other means that
 

13293
04:36:58,920 --> 04:37:02,810
through colonialism and other means that
idea of a state is what it is today

13294
04:37:02,810 --> 04:37:02,820
idea of a state is what it is today
 

13295
04:37:02,820 --> 04:37:05,929
idea of a state is what it is today
spread throughout the the world

13296
04:37:05,929 --> 04:37:05,939
spread throughout the the world
 

13297
04:37:05,939 --> 04:37:09,650
spread throughout the the world
then through particularly the late 19th

13298
04:37:09,650 --> 04:37:09,660
then through particularly the late 19th
 

13299
04:37:09,660 --> 04:37:12,051
then through particularly the late 19th
and early 20th century we realized how

13300
04:37:12,051 --> 04:37:12,061
and early 20th century we realized how
 

13301
04:37:12,061 --> 04:37:14,810
and early 20th century we realized how
unstable that system was because you

13302
04:37:14,810 --> 04:37:14,820
unstable that system was because you
 

13303
04:37:14,820 --> 04:37:16,551
unstable that system was because you
always had these jockeying jocking

13304
04:37:16,551 --> 04:37:16,561
always had these jockeying jocking
 

13305
04:37:16,561 --> 04:37:18,109
always had these jockeying jocking
between sovereign states and some were

13306
04:37:18,109 --> 04:37:18,119
between sovereign states and some were
 

13307
04:37:18,119 --> 04:37:19,490
between sovereign states and some were
rising and some were falling and you

13308
04:37:19,490 --> 04:37:19,500
rising and some were falling and you
 

13309
04:37:19,500 --> 04:37:21,949
rising and some were falling and you
ended up in in war and that was the

13310
04:37:21,949 --> 04:37:21,959
ended up in in war and that was the
 

13311
04:37:21,959 --> 04:37:23,810
ended up in in war and that was the
genius of the generations who came

13312
04:37:23,810 --> 04:37:23,820
genius of the generations who came
 

13313
04:37:23,820 --> 04:37:26,150
genius of the generations who came
together in 1945 in San Francisco and

13314
04:37:26,150 --> 04:37:26,160
together in 1945 in San Francisco and
 

13315
04:37:26,160 --> 04:37:27,410
together in 1945 in San Francisco and
the planning had even started before

13316
04:37:27,410 --> 04:37:27,420
the planning had even started before
 

13317
04:37:27,420 --> 04:37:30,410
the planning had even started before
then who said well we can't just have

13318
04:37:30,410 --> 04:37:30,420
then who said well we can't just have
 

13319
04:37:30,420 --> 04:37:32,570
then who said well we can't just have
that world we need to have an overlay

13320
04:37:32,570 --> 04:37:32,580
that world we need to have an overlay
 

13321
04:37:32,580 --> 04:37:34,330
that world we need to have an overlay
and we talked about the UN and the who

13322
04:37:34,330 --> 04:37:34,340
and we talked about the UN and the who
 

13323
04:37:34,340 --> 04:37:38,510
and we talked about the UN and the who
of systems where are which transcend our

13324
04:37:38,510 --> 04:37:38,520
of systems where are which transcend our
 

13325
04:37:38,520 --> 04:37:40,490
of systems where are which transcend our
national sovereignties they don't they

13326
04:37:40,490 --> 04:37:40,500
national sovereignties they don't they
 

13327
04:37:40,500 --> 04:37:42,170
national sovereignties they don't they
don't get rid of them but they transcend

13328
04:37:42,170 --> 04:37:42,180
don't get rid of them but they transcend
 

13329
04:37:42,180 --> 04:37:43,730
don't get rid of them but they transcend
them so we can solve this category of

13330
04:37:43,730 --> 04:37:43,740
them so we can solve this category of
 

13331
04:37:43,740 --> 04:37:45,949
them so we can solve this category of
problems but we're now reaching a point

13332
04:37:45,949 --> 04:37:45,959
problems but we're now reaching a point
 

13333
04:37:45,959 --> 04:37:48,109
problems but we're now reaching a point
where our reach as humans even

13334
04:37:48,109 --> 04:37:48,119
where our reach as humans even
 

13335
04:37:48,119 --> 04:37:50,449
where our reach as humans even
individually but collectively is so

13336
04:37:50,449 --> 04:37:50,459
individually but collectively is so
 

13337
04:37:50,459 --> 04:37:52,429
individually but collectively is so
great that there's a mismatch between as

great that there's a mismatch between as
 

13339
04:37:52,439 --> 04:37:54,470
great that there's a mismatch between as
I said the nature of the problems and

13340
04:37:54,470 --> 04:37:54,480
I said the nature of the problems and
 

13341
04:37:54,480 --> 04:37:57,230
I said the nature of the problems and
the the ability to solve those uh those

the the ability to solve those uh those

broader Global Collective action problem

broader Global Collective action problem

broader Global Collective action problem
we're going to extinct ourselves and and

13348
04:38:05,629 --> 04:38:05,639
we're going to extinct ourselves and and
 

13349
04:38:05,639 --> 04:38:07,670
we're going to extinct ourselves and and
we see these different what I call

13350
04:38:07,670 --> 04:38:07,680
we see these different what I call
 

13351
04:38:07,680 --> 04:38:10,029
we see these different what I call
verticals whether it's climate change or

verticals whether it's climate change or

proliferation or anything else but none

04:38:15,230 --> 04:38:15,240
proliferation or anything else but none
 

13357
04:38:15,240 --> 04:38:16,910
proliferation or anything else but none
of those can succeed and frankly it

13358
04:38:16,910 --> 04:38:16,920
of those can succeed and frankly it
 

13359
04:38:16,920 --> 04:38:19,010
of those can succeed and frankly it
doesn't even matter if one succeeds

13360
04:38:19,010 --> 04:38:19,020
doesn't even matter if one succeeds
 

13361
04:38:19,020 --> 04:38:21,590
doesn't even matter if one succeeds
because all of them have the potential

13362
04:38:21,590 --> 04:38:21,600
because all of them have the potential
 

13363
04:38:21,600 --> 04:38:25,250
because all of them have the potential
to lead to extinction level events

13364
04:38:25,250 --> 04:38:25,260
to lead to extinction level events

so anyways I gave that talk and and that

13366
04:38:28,551 --> 04:38:28,561
so anyways I gave that talk and and that
 

13367
04:38:28,561 --> 04:38:31,129
so anyways I gave that talk and and that
talk went viral I stayed up all night

13368
04:38:31,129 --> 04:38:31,139
talk went viral I stayed up all night
 

13369
04:38:31,139 --> 04:38:33,650
talk went viral I stayed up all night
the next night and I drafted I think it

13370
04:38:33,650 --> 04:38:33,660
the next night and I drafted I think it
 

13371
04:38:33,660 --> 04:38:35,869
the next night and I drafted I think it
was like an insanity but I think a lot

13372
04:38:35,869 --> 04:38:35,879
was like an insanity but I think a lot
 

13373
04:38:35,879 --> 04:38:38,269
was like an insanity but I think a lot
of us were manic in those early days of

13374
04:38:38,269 --> 04:38:38,279
of us were manic in those early days of
 

13375
04:38:38,279 --> 04:38:40,010
of us were manic in those early days of
the pandemics wanting to do something

13376
04:38:40,010 --> 04:38:40,020
the pandemics wanting to do something
 

13377
04:38:40,020 --> 04:38:41,570
the pandemics wanting to do something
and so I stayed up all night and I

13378
04:38:41,570 --> 04:38:41,580
and so I stayed up all night and I
 

13379
04:38:41,580 --> 04:38:43,789
and so I stayed up all night and I
drafted what I called a declaration of

13380
04:38:43,789 --> 04:38:43,799
drafted what I called a declaration of
 

13381
04:38:43,799 --> 04:38:46,429
drafted what I called a declaration of
global interdependence and I posted that

13382
04:38:46,429 --> 04:38:46,439
global interdependence and I posted that
 

13383
04:38:46,439 --> 04:38:48,890
global interdependence and I posted that
on my website my Jamie russell.com and

13384
04:38:48,890 --> 04:38:48,900
on my website my Jamie russell.com and
 

13385
04:38:48,900 --> 04:38:51,709
on my website my Jamie russell.com and
still there and that went viral

13386
04:38:51,709 --> 04:38:51,719
still there and that went viral
 

13387
04:38:51,719 --> 04:38:53,570
still there and that went viral
um and so then I called a meeting just

13388
04:38:53,570 --> 04:38:53,580
um and so then I called a meeting just
 

13389
04:38:53,580 --> 04:38:56,209
um and so then I called a meeting just
on the people on my personal email list

13390
04:38:56,209 --> 04:38:56,219
on the people on my personal email list
 

13391
04:38:56,219 --> 04:38:59,090
on the people on my personal email list
and so we had people from 25 countries

13392
04:38:59,090 --> 04:38:59,100
and so we had people from 25 countries
 

13393
04:38:59,100 --> 04:39:01,189
and so we had people from 25 countries
there were all of these people who were

13394
04:39:01,189 --> 04:39:01,199
there were all of these people who were
 

13395
04:39:01,199 --> 04:39:02,929
there were all of these people who were
having the same thing there's something

13396
04:39:02,929 --> 04:39:02,939
having the same thing there's something
 

13397
04:39:02,939 --> 04:39:04,789
having the same thing there's something
wrong in the world and they wanted to be

13398
04:39:04,789 --> 04:39:04,799
wrong in the world and they wanted to be
 

13399
04:39:04,799 --> 04:39:07,551
wrong in the world and they wanted to be
part of of a process of fixing it

13400
04:39:07,551 --> 04:39:07,561
part of of a process of fixing it
 

13401
04:39:07,561 --> 04:39:10,970
part of of a process of fixing it
and so it was a crazy 35 days where we

13402
04:39:10,970 --> 04:39:10,980
and so it was a crazy 35 days where we
 

13403
04:39:10,980 --> 04:39:12,109
and so it was a crazy 35 days where we
broke into eight different working

13404
04:39:12,109 --> 04:39:12,119
broke into eight different working
 

13405
04:39:12,119 --> 04:39:15,051
broke into eight different working
groups we had an amazing team that

13406
04:39:15,051 --> 04:39:15,061
groups we had an amazing team that
 

13407
04:39:15,061 --> 04:39:16,970
groups we had an amazing team that
helped re-draft what became the

13408
04:39:16,970 --> 04:39:16,980
helped re-draft what became the
 

13409
04:39:16,980 --> 04:39:19,250
helped re-draft what became the
Declaration of interdependence which is

13410
04:39:19,250 --> 04:39:19,260
Declaration of interdependence which is
 

13411
04:39:19,260 --> 04:39:22,369
Declaration of interdependence which is
now in in 20 languages we laid out a

13412
04:39:22,369 --> 04:39:22,379
now in in 20 languages we laid out a
 

13413
04:39:22,379 --> 04:39:25,730
now in in 20 languages we laid out a
work plan we founded this organization

13414
04:39:25,730 --> 04:39:25,740
work plan we founded this organization
 

13415
04:39:25,740 --> 04:39:27,910
work plan we founded this organization
called one shared world the URL is

13416
04:39:27,910 --> 04:39:27,920
called one shared world the URL is
 

13417
04:39:27,920 --> 04:39:30,289
called one shared world the URL is
oneshared.world and it's just been this

13418
04:39:30,289 --> 04:39:30,299
oneshared.world and it's just been this
 

13419
04:39:30,299 --> 04:39:32,269
oneshared.world and it's just been this
incredible journey we now have people

13420
04:39:32,269 --> 04:39:32,279
incredible journey we now have people
 

13421
04:39:32,279 --> 04:39:33,769
incredible journey we now have people
who are participating in one way or

13422
04:39:33,769 --> 04:39:33,779
who are participating in one way or
 

13423
04:39:33,779 --> 04:39:37,430
who are participating in one way or
another from 120 different countries we

13424
04:39:37,430 --> 04:39:37,440
another from 120 different countries we
 

13425
04:39:37,440 --> 04:39:39,830
another from 120 different countries we
have our public events exploring these

13426
04:39:39,830 --> 04:39:39,840
have our public events exploring these
 

13427
04:39:39,840 --> 04:39:43,550
have our public events exploring these
issues get millions of viewers we have

13428
04:39:43,550 --> 04:39:43,560
issues get millions of viewers we have
 

13429
04:39:43,560 --> 04:39:46,970
issues get millions of viewers we have
world leaders who are participating so

13430
04:39:46,970 --> 04:39:46,980
world leaders who are participating so
 

13431
04:39:46,980 --> 04:39:49,490
world leaders who are participating so
the vision the the the vision is to work

13432
04:39:49,490 --> 04:39:49,500
the vision the the the vision is to work
 

13433
04:39:49,500 --> 04:39:51,890
the vision the the the vision is to work
on some of these big problems arbitrary

13434
04:39:51,890 --> 04:39:51,900
on some of these big problems arbitrary
 

13435
04:39:51,900 --> 04:39:53,090
on some of these big problems arbitrary
number of problems that present

13436
04:39:53,090 --> 04:39:53,100
number of problems that present
 

13437
04:39:53,100 --> 04:39:55,368
number of problems that present
themselves in the world that face all of

13438
04:39:55,368 --> 04:39:55,378
themselves in the world that face all of
 

13439
04:39:55,378 --> 04:39:57,170
themselves in the world that face all of
human civilization and to be able to

13440
04:39:57,170 --> 04:39:57,180
human civilization and to be able to
 

13441
04:39:57,180 --> 04:39:59,810
human civilization and to be able to
work together well that is but there's a

13442
04:39:59,810 --> 04:39:59,820
work together well that is but there's a
 

13443
04:39:59,820 --> 04:40:02,868
work together well that is but there's a
there's a macro a meta problem which is

13444
04:40:02,868 --> 04:40:02,878
there's a macro a meta problem which is
 

13445
04:40:02,878 --> 04:40:04,788
there's a macro a meta problem which is
the global Collective action problem and

13446
04:40:04,788 --> 04:40:04,798
the global Collective action problem and
 

13447
04:40:04,798 --> 04:40:08,750
the global Collective action problem and
so the idea is even if we if we just

13448
04:40:08,750 --> 04:40:08,760
so the idea is even if we if we just
 

13449
04:40:08,760 --> 04:40:10,430
so the idea is even if we if we just
focus on the verticals on the

13450
04:40:10,430 --> 04:40:10,440
focus on the verticals on the
 

13451
04:40:10,440 --> 04:40:12,350
focus on the verticals on the
manifestations of the global Collective

13452
04:40:12,350 --> 04:40:12,360
manifestations of the global Collective
 

13453
04:40:12,360 --> 04:40:13,788
manifestations of the global Collective
action problem

13454
04:40:13,788 --> 04:40:13,798
action problem
 

13455
04:40:13,798 --> 04:40:15,590
action problem
um there will be an infinite number of

13456
04:40:15,590 --> 04:40:15,600
um there will be an infinite number of
 

13457
04:40:15,600 --> 04:40:18,410
um there will be an infinite number of
those things so while we work on those

13458
04:40:18,410 --> 04:40:18,420
those things so while we work on those
 

13459
04:40:18,420 --> 04:40:21,410
those things so while we work on those
things like climate change pandemics wmd

13460
04:40:21,410 --> 04:40:21,420
things like climate change pandemics wmd
 

13461
04:40:21,420 --> 04:40:24,288
things like climate change pandemics wmd
and other things we also have to ask the

13462
04:40:24,288 --> 04:40:24,298
and other things we also have to ask the
 

13463
04:40:24,298 --> 04:40:26,330
and other things we also have to ask the
bigger questions of why can't we solve

13464
04:40:26,330 --> 04:40:26,340
bigger questions of why can't we solve
 

13465
04:40:26,340 --> 04:40:28,250
bigger questions of why can't we solve
this category of problems and the idea

13466
04:40:28,250 --> 04:40:28,260
this category of problems and the idea
 

13467
04:40:28,260 --> 04:40:31,610
this category of problems and the idea
is at least from my observation is

13468
04:40:31,610 --> 04:40:31,620
is at least from my observation is
 

13469
04:40:31,620 --> 04:40:34,250
is at least from my observation is
um that whenever big decisions are being

13470
04:40:34,250 --> 04:40:34,260
um that whenever big decisions are being
 

13471
04:40:34,260 --> 04:40:37,250
um that whenever big decisions are being
made are national leaders and corporate

13472
04:40:37,250 --> 04:40:37,260
made are national leaders and corporate
 

13473
04:40:37,260 --> 04:40:39,170
made are national leaders and corporate
leaders are doing exactly what we've

13474
04:40:39,170 --> 04:40:39,180
leaders are doing exactly what we've
 

13475
04:40:39,180 --> 04:40:42,350
leaders are doing exactly what we've
hired them to do they're maximizing for

13476
04:40:42,350 --> 04:40:42,360
hired them to do they're maximizing for
 

13477
04:40:42,360 --> 04:40:44,750
hired them to do they're maximizing for
National interest even or corporate

13478
04:40:44,750 --> 04:40:44,760
National interest even or corporate
 

13479
04:40:44,760 --> 04:40:46,970
National interest even or corporate
interest even at the expense of

13480
04:40:46,970 --> 04:40:46,980
interest even at the expense of
 

13481
04:40:46,980 --> 04:40:49,730
interest even at the expense of
everybody and so it's not that we want

13482
04:40:49,730 --> 04:40:49,740
everybody and so it's not that we want
 

13483
04:40:49,740 --> 04:40:51,110
everybody and so it's not that we want
to get rid of States states are

13484
04:40:51,110 --> 04:40:51,120
to get rid of States states are
 

13485
04:40:51,120 --> 04:40:52,970
to get rid of States states are
essential in our world system it's not

13486
04:40:52,970 --> 04:40:52,980
essential in our world system it's not
 

13487
04:40:52,980 --> 04:40:54,948
essential in our world system it's not
we want to undermine the UN which is

13488
04:40:54,948 --> 04:40:54,958
we want to undermine the UN which is
 

13489
04:40:54,958 --> 04:40:56,510
we want to undermine the UN which is
also essential but massively

13490
04:40:56,510 --> 04:40:56,520
also essential but massively
 

13491
04:40:56,520 --> 04:40:59,208
also essential but massively
underperforming what we want to do is to

13492
04:40:59,208 --> 04:40:59,218
underperforming what we want to do is to
 

13493
04:40:59,218 --> 04:41:01,368
underperforming what we want to do is to
create an empowered Global constituency

13494
04:41:01,368 --> 04:41:01,378
create an empowered Global constituency
 

13495
04:41:01,378 --> 04:41:04,430
create an empowered Global constituency
of people who are demanding that their

13496
04:41:04,430 --> 04:41:04,440
of people who are demanding that their
 

13497
04:41:04,440 --> 04:41:07,310
of people who are demanding that their
leaders at all levels just do a better

13498
04:41:07,310 --> 04:41:07,320
leaders at all levels just do a better
 

13499
04:41:07,320 --> 04:41:09,830
leaders at all levels just do a better
job job of balancing broader and

13500
04:41:09,830 --> 04:41:09,840
job job of balancing broader and
 

13501
04:41:09,840 --> 04:41:12,650
job job of balancing broader and
narrower interests I see so this is more

13502
04:41:12,650 --> 04:41:12,660
narrower interests I see so this is more
 

13503
04:41:12,660 --> 04:41:14,090
narrower interests I see so this is more
like a

13504
04:41:14,090 --> 04:41:14,100
like a
 

13505
04:41:14,100 --> 04:41:16,910
like a
uh make it more symmetric in terms of

13506
04:41:16,910 --> 04:41:16,920
uh make it more symmetric in terms of
 

13507
04:41:16,920 --> 04:41:21,890
uh make it more symmetric in terms of
power it's uh holding uh accountable the

13508
04:41:21,890 --> 04:41:21,900
power it's uh holding uh accountable the
 

13509
04:41:21,900 --> 04:41:24,850
power it's uh holding uh accountable the
the Nations the leaders the problem is

13510
04:41:24,850 --> 04:41:24,860
the Nations the leaders the problem is
 

13511
04:41:24,860 --> 04:41:27,650
the Nations the leaders the problem is
nations are powerful we talked about

13512
04:41:27,650 --> 04:41:27,660
nations are powerful we talked about
 

13513
04:41:27,660 --> 04:41:29,208
nations are powerful we talked about
China quite a bit

13514
04:41:29,208 --> 04:41:29,218
China quite a bit
 

13515
04:41:29,218 --> 04:41:31,750
China quite a bit
how do you have an organizations of of

13516
04:41:31,750 --> 04:41:31,760
how do you have an organizations of of
 

13517
04:41:31,760 --> 04:41:33,830
how do you have an organizations of of
citizens of Earth

13518
04:41:33,830 --> 04:41:33,840
citizens of Earth
 

13519
04:41:33,840 --> 04:41:36,410
citizens of Earth
they can solve the the this Collective

13520
04:41:36,410 --> 04:41:36,420
they can solve the the this Collective
 

13521
04:41:36,420 --> 04:41:38,810
they can solve the the this Collective
problem that holds China accountable

13522
04:41:38,810 --> 04:41:38,820
problem that holds China accountable
 

13523
04:41:38,820 --> 04:41:42,110
problem that holds China accountable
it's difficult because U.N you could say

13524
04:41:42,110 --> 04:41:42,120
it's difficult because U.N you could say
 

13525
04:41:42,120 --> 04:41:44,208
it's difficult because U.N you could say
a lot of things but to call it effective

13526
04:41:44,208 --> 04:41:44,218
a lot of things but to call it effective
 

13527
04:41:44,218 --> 04:41:46,610
a lot of things but to call it effective
is hard yeah you know the internet

13528
04:41:46,610 --> 04:41:46,620
is hard yeah you know the internet
 

13529
04:41:46,620 --> 04:41:49,128
is hard yeah you know the internet

but I think we need to give a little bit
 

13741
04:45:59,400 --> 04:46:02,690
but I think we need to give a little bit
of structure because just going I'm a

13797
04:47:09,900 --> 04:47:10,970
empowered and because of that you start
to think about some of these

13798
04:47:10,970 --> 04:47:10,980

relic of the past
 

13825
04:47:42,900 --> 04:47:46,128
relic of the past
that's a that could be a a 20th century

13826

that's a that could be a a 20th century
 

13827
04:47:46,138 --> 04:47:50,270
that's a that could be a a 20th century
and before idea that was tried

13828
04:47:50,270 --> 04:47:50,280
and before idea that was tried
 

13829
04:47:50,280 --> 04:47:52,430
and before idea that was tried
to create a lot of benefit

13830

to create a lot of benefit
 

13831
04:47:52,440 --> 04:47:55,670
to create a lot of benefit
but we also saw the problems with that

13832
04:47:55,670 --> 04:47:55,680
but we also saw the problems with that
 

13833
04:47:55,680 --> 04:47:58,788
but we also saw the problems with that
kind of world extreme nationalism

13834

kind of world extreme nationalism
 

13835
04:47:58,798 --> 04:48:01,070
kind of world extreme nationalism
we see the benefits and the problems of

13836
04:48:01,070 --> 04:48:01,080
we see the benefits and the problems of
 

13837
04:48:01,080 --> 04:48:02,510

competition between nations versus
adversarial competition that resulted in

13850
04:48:16,550 --> 04:48:16,560
adversarial competition that resulted in
 

13851
04:48:16,560 --> 04:48:18,590
adversarial competition that resulted in
the response to covid for example with

13852

the response to covid for example with
 

13853
04:48:18,600 --> 04:48:20,570
the response to covid for example with
China and the United States and Russia

science
 

13863
04:48:31,260 --> 04:48:33,948
science
and resulted in the loss of trillions of

13864
04:48:33,948 --> 04:48:33,958
and resulted in the loss of trillions of
 

13865

and resulted in the loss of trillions of
dollars in the cost of countless lives

we're going to figure something out I'm
an optimist by nature and that doesn't

13904

an optimist by nature and that doesn't
 

13905
04:49:24,600 --> 04:49:26,990
an optimist by nature and that doesn't
mean that we need we need to be blind to

the dangers there are very very real
 

13909
04:49:29,180 --> 04:49:32,750
the dangers there are very very real
dangers but just given half the chance

dangers but just given half the chance
 

13911
04:49:32,760 --> 04:49:35,930

the right thing and I do believe that
 

13915
04:49:39,120 --> 04:49:41,868
the right thing and I do believe that
there's a role I mean there's a role for

13916
04:49:41,868 --> 04:49:41,878
there's a role I mean there's a role for
 

13917
04:49:41,878 --> 04:49:43,788
there's a role I mean there's a role for
the at least near term for governments

13918
04:49:43,788 --> 04:49:43,798
the at least near term for governments
 

13919
04:49:43,798 --> 04:49:46,250
the at least near term for governments
but there's always a role for leadership

and I'm I guess like a gramsian in in
 

13923
04:49:50,100 --> 04:49:52,190
and I'm I guess like a gramsian in in
the sense that that I I think that we

13924
04:49:52,190 --> 04:49:52,200
the sense that that I I think that we
 

13925
04:49:52,200 --> 04:49:54,288
the sense that that I I think that we
need to create Frameworks and and

13926
04:49:54,288 --> 04:49:54,298
need to create Frameworks and and
 

13927
04:49:54,298 --> 04:49:58,490
need to create Frameworks and and
structures that allow leaders to emerge

structures that allow leaders to emerge
 

13929
04:49:58,500 --> 04:50:01,368
structures that allow leaders to emerge
and we need to build Norms so that the

13930
04:50:01,368 --> 04:50:01,378
and we need to build Norms so that the
 

13931

figured out ways to slaughter each other
at scale but we've come up with these

13954
04:50:34,970 --> 04:50:34,980
at scale but we've come up with these
 

13955

wonderful magical species and if we just
 

13965
04:50:46,920 --> 04:50:50,030
wonderful magical species and if we just
can create enough of an infrastructure
