change our view of what's important
and change who we are

and change who we are
 

85

a key thing is 2029
 

95
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,389
a key thing is 2029
when

96
00:01:46,389 --> 00:01:46,399
when

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,990
when
computers will pass the turing test

98
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:50,000
computers will pass the turing test
 

99
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,350
computers will pass the turing test
and there's also some controversy

100
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:51,360
and there's also some controversy
 

101
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,670
and there's also some controversy
whether the turing test is valid i

102

whether the turing test is valid i

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,830
whether the turing test is valid i
believe it is

believe it is
 

105
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,149
believe it is
most people do believe that but there's

got very alarmed at my
 

113
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,030
got very alarmed at my
prediction about 2029 i made this in

114
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,040
prediction about 2029 i made this in
 

115
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,109
prediction about 2029 i made this in
1999

116
00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:09,119
1999
 

117
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,309
1999
and my book

118
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:10,319
and my book
 

119
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,390
and my book
the age of spiritual machines right and

120
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:12,400
the age of spiritual machines right and
 

121
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,430
the age of spiritual machines right and
then you repeated the prediction in 2005

122
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:15,440
then you repeated the prediction in 2005
 

123
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,350
then you repeated the prediction in 2005
2005. yeah

124
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:17,360
2005. yeah
 

125
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,270
2005. yeah
so they held international conference

126
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:19,280
so they held international conference
 

127
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,949
so they held international conference
you might have been aware of it

128
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:20,959
you might have been aware of it
 

129
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,790
you might have been aware of it
of ai experts in 1999 to assess

130
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:24,800
of ai experts in 1999 to assess
 

131
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,390
of ai experts in 1999 to assess
this view

132
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:26,400
this view
 

133
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,430
this view
so people gave different predictions

134
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:29,440
so people gave different predictions
 

135
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,190
so people gave different predictions
and they took a poll it was really the

136
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:31,200
and they took a poll it was really the
 

137
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,070
and they took a poll it was really the
first time that ai experts worldwide

138
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,080
first time that ai experts worldwide
 

139
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,509
first time that ai experts worldwide
were polled on this prediction

140
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:37,519
were polled on this prediction
 

141
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,949
were polled on this prediction
and the average poll was a hundred years

142
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:40,959
and the average poll was a hundred years
 

143
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,869
and the average poll was a hundred years
uh 20 percent believed it would never

144
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:42,879
uh 20 percent believed it would never
 

145
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,229
uh 20 percent believed it would never
happen

146
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:44,239
happen
 

147
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,990
happen
and that was the view in 1999

148
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,000
and that was the view in 1999
 

149
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,390
and that was the view in 1999
80 believed it would happen

150
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:50,400
80 believed it would happen
 

151
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,949
80 believed it would happen
but not within their lifetimes

152
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:52,959
but not within their lifetimes
 

153
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,309
but not within their lifetimes
there's been so many advances in a.i

00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:56,319
there's been so many advances in a.i
 

155
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,509
there's been so many advances in a.i
uh that the poll of ai experts has come

156
00:02:59,509 --> 00:02:59,519
uh that the poll of ai experts has come
 

157
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,910
uh that the poll of ai experts has come
down over the years so a year ago

158
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:03,920
down over the years so a year ago
 

159
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,990
down over the years so a year ago
something called meticulous which may be

what ai experts then felt and they were
saying 2042

170
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:18,720
saying 2042
 

171
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,309
saying 2042
for the drawing test

172
00:03:20,309 --> 00:03:20,319
for the drawing test
 

173
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,309
for the drawing test
for the turning test

174
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:22,319
for the turning test
 

175
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,070
for the turning test
so it's coming down and i was still

176
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,080
so it's coming down and i was still
 

177
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,830
so it's coming down and i was still
saying 2029 yeah a few weeks ago

178
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:27,840
saying 2029 yeah a few weeks ago
 

179
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,070
saying 2029 yeah a few weeks ago
they again did another poll

180
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:30,080
they again did another poll
 

181
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,869
they again did another poll
and it was 2030.

182
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:32,879
and it was 2030.
 

183
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,550
and it was 2030.
so

184
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:34,560
so
 

185
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,750
so
a experts now basically agree with me

186
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:37,760
a experts now basically agree with me
 

187
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,670
a experts now basically agree with me
i haven't changed at all i've stayed

188
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:39,680
i haven't changed at all i've stayed
 

189
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,710
i haven't changed at all i've stayed
with 2029

190
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:42,720
with 2029
 

191
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,550
with 2029
and they experts now agree with me but

192
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:44,560
and they experts now agree with me but
 

193
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,789
and they experts now agree with me but
they didn't agree at first

194
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:46,799
they didn't agree at first
 

195
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:47,589
they didn't agree at first
so

196
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:47,599
so
 

197
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,070
so
alan touring formulated the touring test

198
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:50,080
alan touring formulated the touring test
 

199
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,869
alan touring formulated the touring test
and

200
00:03:50,869 --> 00:03:50,879
and
 

201
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:51,910
and
right now

202
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:51,920
right now
 

203
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,390
right now
what he said was very little about it i

204
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:54,400
what he said was very little about it i
 

205
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,309
what he said was very little about it i
mean the 1950 paper where he had

206
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:56,319
mean the 1950 paper where he had
 

207
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,630
mean the 1950 paper where he had
articulated the during test

208
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:58,640
articulated the during test
 

209
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,190
articulated the during test
he there's like a few lines

210
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:01,200
he there's like a few lines
 

211
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:01,990
he there's like a few lines
that

212
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,000
that
 

213
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,589
that
uh

214
00:04:03,589 --> 00:04:03,599
uh
 

215
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,670
uh
talk about the turing test

216
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:05,680
talk about the turing test
 

217
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,710
talk about the turing test
um

218
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:06,720
um
 

219
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,949
um
and it really wasn't

220
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:08,959
and it really wasn't
 

221
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,910
and it really wasn't
uh very clear how to administer it

222
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:11,920
uh very clear how to administer it
 

223
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,550
uh very clear how to administer it
and

224
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:12,560
and
 

225
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,949
and
he said if if they did it in like 15

226
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:14,959
he said if if they did it in like 15
 

227
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,310
he said if if they did it in like 15
minutes

228
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:16,320
minutes
 

229
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,990
minutes
that would be sufficient which i don't

230
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,000
that would be sufficient which i don't
 

231
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,550
that would be sufficient which i don't
really think is the case

232
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:20,560
really think is the case
 

233
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,790
really think is the case
these large language models now

234
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:22,800
these large language models now
 

235
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,350
these large language models now
some people are convinced by it already

236
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:25,360
some people are convinced by it already
 

237
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,350
some people are convinced by it already
i mean you can talk to it and have a

238
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:27,360
i mean you can talk to it and have a
 

239
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,790
i mean you can talk to it and have a
conversation with you you can actually

240
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:28,800
conversation with you you can actually
 

241
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,670
conversation with you you can actually
talk to it for hours

242
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:31,680
talk to it for hours
 

243
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,390
talk to it for hours
so

244
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:32,400
so
 

245
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,189
so
it requires a little more depth

246
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:35,199
it requires a little more depth
 

247
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,550
it requires a little more depth
there's some problems with large

248
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:36,560
there's some problems with large
 

249
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,990
there's some problems with large
language models which we can talk about

250
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,000
language models which we can talk about
 

251
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,670
language models which we can talk about
um

252
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:41,680
um
 

253
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,510
um
but

254
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:43,520
but
 

255
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,350
but
some people are convinced

256
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:45,360
some people are convinced
 

257
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,270
some people are convinced
by the turing test now

258
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:47,280
by the turing test now
 

259
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,230
by the turing test now
if somebody passes the turing test

260
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:50,240
if somebody passes the turing test
 

261
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,990
if somebody passes the turing test
what what are the implications of that

262
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,000
what what are the implications of that
 

263
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,590
what what are the implications of that
does that mean that they're sentient

264
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:53,600
does that mean that they're sentient
 

265
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,189
does that mean that they're sentient
that they're conscious

266
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:55,199
that they're conscious
 

267
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,469
that they're conscious
or not it's not necessarily clear

268
00:04:58,469 --> 00:04:58,479
or not it's not necessarily clear
 

269
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,790
or not it's not necessarily clear
what the implications are

270
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:00,800
what the implications are
 

271
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,189
what the implications are
anyway i i believe

272
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:03,199
anyway i i believe
 

273
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,629
anyway i i believe
2029 that six seven years from now

274
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:06,639
2029 that six seven years from now
 

275
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,670
2029 that six seven years from now
uh

276
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:07,680
uh
 

277
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,430
uh
we'll have something to pass this turing

278
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:09,440
we'll have something to pass this turing
 

279
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,310
we'll have something to pass this turing
test and a valid turing test

280
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:12,320
test and a valid turing test
 

281
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,629
test and a valid turing test
meaning it goes for hours not just a few

282
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:14,639
meaning it goes for hours not just a few
 

283
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,150
meaning it goes for hours not just a few
minutes can you speak to that a little

284
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:16,160
minutes can you speak to that a little
 

285
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,350
minutes can you speak to that a little
bit what is

286
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:17,360
bit what is
 

287
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,350
bit what is
your

288
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:19,360
your
 

289
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,189
your
formulation of the touring test you

290
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:21,199
formulation of the touring test you
 

291
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,950
formulation of the touring test you
you've proposed a very difficult version

292
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:22,960
you've proposed a very difficult version
 

293
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,469
you've proposed a very difficult version
of the drawing test so what does that

294
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:24,479
of the drawing test so what does that
 

295
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,950
of the drawing test so what does that
look like basically it's just to assess

296
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:26,960
look like basically it's just to assess
 

297
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,629
look like basically it's just to assess
it over several hours

298
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:30,639

 

299
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,029

and also have a human judge that's

300
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:35,039
and also have a human judge that's
 

301
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,670
and also have a human judge that's
fairly sophisticated on what computers

302
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:37,680
fairly sophisticated on what computers
 

303
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,550
fairly sophisticated on what computers
can do and can't do

304
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:40,560
can do and can't do
 

305
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,990
can do and can't do
if you take somebody who's not that

306
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,000
if you take somebody who's not that
 

307
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,670
if you take somebody who's not that
sophisticated

308
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:43,680
sophisticated
 

309
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,230
sophisticated
or even a average engineer

310
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,240
or even a average engineer
 

311
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,230
or even a average engineer
they may not really assess

312
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:50,240
they may not really assess
 

313
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,430
they may not really assess
various aspects of it so you really want

314
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:53,440
various aspects of it so you really want
 

315
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,670
various aspects of it so you really want
the human to challenge the system

316
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:55,680
the human to challenge the system
 

317
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,070
the human to challenge the system
exactly exactly on its ability to do

318
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,080
exactly exactly on its ability to do
 

319
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,670
exactly exactly on its ability to do
things like common sense reasoning

320
00:05:59,670 --> 00:05:59,680
things like common sense reasoning
 

321
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,710
things like common sense reasoning
perhaps

322
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:00,720
perhaps
 

323
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,469
perhaps
that's actually a key

324
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:02,479
that's actually a key
 

325
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,710
that's actually a key
problem with large language models they

326
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:04,720
problem with large language models they
 

327
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,309
problem with large language models they
don't do

328
00:06:06,309 --> 00:06:06,319
don't do
 

329
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,590
don't do
these kinds of

330
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:09,600

 

331
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,909

tests that would involve

332
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:11,919
tests that would involve
 

333
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:17,189
tests that would involve
assessing uh chains of reasoning

334
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:17,199

 

335
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,270

but you can lose track of that you if

336
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:19,280
but you can lose track of that you if
 

337
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,110
but you can lose track of that you if
you talk to them they actually can talk

338
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,120
you talk to them they actually can talk
 

339
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,629
you talk to them they actually can talk
to you pretty well

340
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:22,639
to you pretty well
 

341
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,629
to you pretty well
and you can be convinced by it

342
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:24,639
and you can be convinced by it
 

343
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,629
and you can be convinced by it
but it's somebody that would really

344
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:26,639
but it's somebody that would really
 

345
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,110
but it's somebody that would really
convince you that it's a human

346
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:29,120
convince you that it's a human
 

347
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,150
convince you that it's a human
uh

348
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:30,160
uh
 

349
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,070
uh
whatever that takes

350
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,080
whatever that takes
 

351
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,909
whatever that takes
maybe it would take days or weeks

352
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:35,919
maybe it would take days or weeks
 

353
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,749
maybe it would take days or weeks
but it would really convince you that

354
00:06:37,749 --> 00:06:37,759
but it would really convince you that
 

355
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,710
but it would really convince you that
it's human

356
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:40,720

large language models

358
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,160
large language models
 

359
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,070
large language models
can appear that way you can read

360
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,080
can appear that way you can read
 

361
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,309
can appear that way you can read
conversations and that they appear

362
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:48,319
conversations and that they appear
 

363
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,670
conversations and that they appear
pretty good

364
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:49,680
pretty good
 

365
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,070

00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,080
there are some problems with it
 

367
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,629
there are some problems with it
it doesn't do math very well

368
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:54,639
it doesn't do math very well
 

369
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,469
it doesn't do math very well
you can ask how many

you can ask how many

00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,309
you can ask how many
legs did 10 elephants have and they'll

372
00:06:58,309 --> 00:06:58,319
legs did 10 elephants have and they'll
 

373
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,830
legs did 10 elephants have and they'll
tell you well okay

374
00:06:59,830 --> 00:06:59,840
tell you well okay
 

375
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,749

each elephant has four legs and 10
 

377
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,909
each elephant has four legs and 10
elephants so it's 40 legs and you go

379
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,749
elephants so it's 40 legs and you go
okay that's pretty good

00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:05,759
okay that's pretty good

question
 

387
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,070
question
do all humans understand that question

00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:14,080
do all humans understand that question
 

389
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,790
do all humans understand that question
no

390
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:14,800
no
 

391
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,710
no
that's the key thing i mean how advanced

392
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:16,720
that's the key thing i mean how advanced
 

393
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,189
that's the key thing i mean how advanced
the human do you want it to be

394
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:19,199
the human do you want it to be
 

395
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,510
the human do you want it to be
but we do we do expect a human to be

396
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:21,520
but we do we do expect a human to be
 

397
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,629
but we do we do expect a human to be

able to do multi-chain reasoning
 

399

them together
 

403
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,670
them together
not perfectly and we we see that you

404
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:31,680
not perfectly and we we see that you
 

405
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,270
not perfectly and we we see that you
know in a lot of polls that people don't

406

know in a lot of polls that people don't
 

407

know in a lot of polls that people don't
do that

408
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:34,240
do that
 

409
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,390
do that
perfectly at all but

410
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:36,400
perfectly at all but
 

411
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,029
perfectly at all but
um

412
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:39,039

 

413
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,830

so it's not it's not very well defined

so it's not it's not very well defined
 

415
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,589
so it's not it's not very well defined
but it's something where it really would

416
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:43,599
but it's something where it really would
 

417
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,430
but it's something where it really would
convince you that it's a human

00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:45,440
convince you that it's a human
 

419
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,749
convince you that it's a human

423

do we need something else no i think it

430
00:07:57,189 --> 00:07:57,199
do we need something else no i think it
 

431
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,110
do we need something else no i think it
will be a large language one but they

432
00:07:59,110 --> 00:07:59,120
will be a large language one but they
 

433
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,150
will be a large language one but they
have to go beyond what they're doing now

434
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:02,160
have to go beyond what they're doing now
 

435
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,589
have to go beyond what they're doing now
uh i think we're getting there

00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:05,599
uh i think we're getting there
 

437
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,589
uh i think we're getting there
and another key issue

438
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:07,599
and another key issue
 

439
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:08,710
and another key issue
is if

440
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:08,720
is if
 

441
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,790
is if
somebody actually passes the turing test

442
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:10,800
somebody actually passes the turing test
 

443
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,869
somebody actually passes the turing test
validly i would believe they're

444
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:12,879
validly i would believe they're
 

445
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,550
validly i would believe they're
conscious and not everybody would say

446
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:14,560
conscious and not everybody would say
 

447
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,469
conscious and not everybody would say
that say okay we can pass

448
00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:16,479
that say okay we can pass
 

449
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:17,990
that say okay we can pass
a turing test but we don't really

450
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:18,000
a turing test but we don't really
 

451
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,150
a turing test but we don't really
believe that it's conscious that's a

452
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:20,160
believe that it's conscious that's a
 

453
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,869
believe that it's conscious that's a
whole other issue

454
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:22,879
whole other issue
 

455
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,710
whole other issue
but if it really passes the turning test

456
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:24,720
but if it really passes the turning test
 

457
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,670
but if it really passes the turning test
i would believe that it's conscious

i would believe that it's conscious
 

459
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,550
i would believe that it's conscious
but i don't believe that of uh

460
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:30,560
but i don't believe that of uh
 

461
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,630
but i don't believe that of uh

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,430
if it appears to be conscious
that's as good as being conscious at

00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:37,440
that's as good as being conscious at
 

467
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,110
that's as good as being conscious at

in some sense
 

471
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,269
in some sense
i mean consciousness is not something

472
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:43,279
i mean consciousness is not something
 

473
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,470
i mean consciousness is not something
that's scientific

that's scientific
 

475
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,509
that's scientific
uh i mean i believe you're conscious

uh i mean i believe you're conscious
 

477
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,190
uh i mean i believe you're conscious
but it's really just a belief and we

but it's really just a belief and we
 

479
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,430
but it's really just a belief and we
believe that about other humans that

believe that about other humans that

be

504
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:16,800
be
 

505
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,070
be
but but that's really a philosophical

506
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,080
but but that's really a philosophical
 

507
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,670
but but that's really a philosophical
belief it's not

508
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:21,680
belief it's not
 

509
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,269
belief it's not
you can't prove it i can't take an

510
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:23,279
you can't prove it i can't take an
 

511
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,269
you can't prove it i can't take an
entity and prove that it's conscious

512
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:25,279
entity and prove that it's conscious
 

513
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,269
entity and prove that it's conscious
there's nothing that you can do that

514
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:27,279
there's nothing that you can do that
 

515
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,230
there's nothing that you can do that
would be

516
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:28,240
would be
 

517
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,150
would be
that would indicate that

518
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,160
that would indicate that
 

519
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,590
that would indicate that
it's like saying a piece of art is

520
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:31,600
it's like saying a piece of art is
 

521
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,630
it's like saying a piece of art is
beautiful

522
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:32,640
beautiful
 

523
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,870
beautiful
you can say it

524
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:34,880
you can say it
 

525
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,790
you can say it
multiple people can experience a piece

526
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:36,800
multiple people can experience a piece
 

527
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,790
multiple people can experience a piece
of art is beautiful

528
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:38,800
of art is beautiful
 

529
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,190
of art is beautiful
uh but you can't prove it

530
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:41,200
uh but you can't prove it
 

531
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,509
uh but you can't prove it
but it's also an extremely important

532
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:43,519
but it's also an extremely important
 

533
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,470
but it's also an extremely important
issue yes i mean imagine if you had

534
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:46,480
issue yes i mean imagine if you had
 

535
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,590
issue yes i mean imagine if you had
something where

536
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:47,600
something where
 

537
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,990
something where
nobody's conscious

538
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,000
nobody's conscious
 

539
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,350
nobody's conscious
the the world may as well not exist

540
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:53,360
the the world may as well not exist
 

541
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,590
the the world may as well not exist
um

542
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:55,600
um
 

543
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,670
um
and

544
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:57,680
and
 

545
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,720
and
so some people like say marvin minsky

546
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:00,730
so some people like say marvin minsky
 

547
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,470
so some people like say marvin minsky

[Music]
 

549
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,269
[Music]
said well consciousness is not

550
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:05,279
said well consciousness is not
 

551
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,790
said well consciousness is not
logical it's not scientific and

552
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:06,800
logical it's not scientific and
 

553
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,030
logical it's not scientific and
therefore we should dismiss it and

554
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,040
therefore we should dismiss it and
 

555
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,269
therefore we should dismiss it and
any answer any talk about consciousness

556
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:11,279
any answer any talk about consciousness
 

557
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,070
any answer any talk about consciousness
is

558
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:12,080
is
 

559
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,030
is
just

560
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,040
just
 

561
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,269
just
not to be believed

562
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:15,279
not to be believed
 

563
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,790
not to be believed
but when he actually

564
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:16,800
but when he actually
 

565
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,350
but when he actually
engaged with somebody who was conscious

566
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:19,360
engaged with somebody who was conscious
 

567
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,269
engaged with somebody who was conscious
he actually acted as if they were

568
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:21,279
he actually acted as if they were
 

569
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,389
he actually acted as if they were
conscious

570
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:22,399
conscious
 

571
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,069
conscious
he didn't ignore that

572
00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:24,079
he didn't ignore that
 

573
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,790
he didn't ignore that
he acted as if consciousness does matter

574
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:26,800
he acted as if consciousness does matter
 

575
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,910
he acted as if consciousness does matter
exactly

576
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:27,920
exactly
 

577
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,230
exactly
whereas he said it didn't matter

578
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:30,240
whereas he said it didn't matter
 

579
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,389
whereas he said it didn't matter
well that's myron raminsky yeah he's

580
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:32,399
well that's myron raminsky yeah he's
 

581
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,550
well that's myron raminsky yeah he's
full of contradictions but that's true

582
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:34,560
full of contradictions but that's true
 

583
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,750
full of contradictions but that's true
of of a lot of people as well um but to

584
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:37,760
of of a lot of people as well um but to
 

585
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,389
of of a lot of people as well um but to
you consciousness matters but to me it's

586
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:40,399
you consciousness matters but to me it's
 

587
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,990
you consciousness matters but to me it's
very important

588
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:42,000
very important
 

589
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,230
very important
but but i would say it's not a

590
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:44,240
but but i would say it's not a
 

591
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,269
but but i would say it's not a
scientific issue

592
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:47,279
scientific issue
 

593
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,509
scientific issue
it's a philosophical issue and people

594
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:49,519
it's a philosophical issue and people
 

595
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,110
it's a philosophical issue and people
have different views and some people

596
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:51,120
have different views and some people
 

597
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,230
have different views and some people
believe that

598
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:52,240
believe that
 

599
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,829
believe that
anything that makes a decision is

600
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:53,839
anything that makes a decision is
 

601
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,509
anything that makes a decision is
conscious so your light switch is

602
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:55,519
conscious so your light switch is
 

603
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,630
conscious so your light switch is
conscious

604
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:56,640
conscious
 

605
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,110
conscious
it's level of consciousness that's low

606
00:10:59,110 --> 00:10:59,120
it's level of consciousness that's low
 

607
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,030
it's level of consciousness that's low
it's not very interesting

608
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,040
it's not very interesting
 

609
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,750
it's not very interesting
but but that's a consciousness

610
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:03,760
but but that's a consciousness
 

611
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,110
but but that's a consciousness
uh and anything so a computer that makes

612
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:07,120
uh and anything so a computer that makes
 

613
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,030
uh and anything so a computer that makes
a more interesting decision

614
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,040
a more interesting decision
 

615
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,030
a more interesting decision
still not at human levels but it's also

616
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,040
still not at human levels but it's also
 

617
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,550
still not at human levels but it's also
conscious and at a higher level than

618
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:12,560
conscious and at a higher level than
 

619
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,550
conscious and at a higher level than
your light switch

620
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:14,560
your light switch
 

621
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,190
your light switch
so that's one view

622
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,200
so that's one view
 

623
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,630
so that's one view
there's many different views of what

624
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:18,640
there's many different views of what
 

625
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,590
there's many different views of what
consciousness is so if a system passes

626
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:21,600
consciousness is so if a system passes
 

627
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,470
consciousness is so if a system passes
the turing test

628
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:24,480
the turing test
 

629
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,870
the turing test
it's not scientific

630
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:26,880
it's not scientific
 

631
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,630
it's not scientific
but uh

632
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:28,640
but uh
 

633
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,310
but uh
in issues of philosophy things like

634
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:30,320
in issues of philosophy things like
 

635
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,470
in issues of philosophy things like
ethics start to enter the picture

636
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:32,480
ethics start to enter the picture
 

637
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,509
ethics start to enter the picture
do you think

638
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:33,519
do you think
 

639
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,350
do you think
there would be

640
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:35,360
there would be
 

641
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,910
there would be
we would start contending as a human

642
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:37,920
we would start contending as a human
 

643
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,829
we would start contending as a human
species

644
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:39,839
species
 

645
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,069
species
about the ethics of turning off such a

646
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:42,079
about the ethics of turning off such a
 

647
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,509
about the ethics of turning off such a
machine

648
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:43,519
machine
 

649
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,190
machine
yeah i mean that's definitely come up

650
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:47,200
yeah i mean that's definitely come up
 

651
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,470
yeah i mean that's definitely come up
hasn't come up in reality yet but yet

652
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:50,480
hasn't come up in reality yet but yet
 

653
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,630
hasn't come up in reality yet but yet
but i'm talking about 2029 it's not that

654
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:52,640
but i'm talking about 2029 it's not that
 

655
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,829
but i'm talking about 2029 it's not that
many years from now

656
00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:54,839
many years from now
 

657
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,350
many years from now
um and so what are our obligations to it

658
00:11:59,350 --> 00:11:59,360
um and so what are our obligations to it
 

659
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,430
um and so what are our obligations to it
uh it has a different

660
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:01,440
uh it has a different
 

661
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,670
uh it has a different
i mean a computer that's conscious has a

662
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:03,680
i mean a computer that's conscious has a
 

663
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,910
i mean a computer that's conscious has a
little bit different

664
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:05,920
little bit different
 

665
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,350
little bit different
uh

666
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:07,360
uh
 

667
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,269
uh
connotations than

668
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:09,279
connotations than
 

669
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,389
connotations than
a human

670
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:12,399

 

671
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,430

we have a continuous consciousness

672
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:15,440
we have a continuous consciousness
 

673
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,910
we have a continuous consciousness
we're in an entity that

674
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:17,920
we're in an entity that
 

675
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,990
we're in an entity that
does not last forever

676
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:22,000

 

677
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,790

now actually a significant portion of

678
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:24,800
now actually a significant portion of
 

679
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,190
now actually a significant portion of
humans still exist

680
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:27,200
humans still exist
 

681
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,910
humans still exist
and are therefore still conscious

682
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:29,920
and are therefore still conscious
 

683
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,590
and are therefore still conscious
um

684
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:31,600
um
 

685
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,710
um
but anybody who is over a certain age

686
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:34,720
but anybody who is over a certain age
 

687
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,949
but anybody who is over a certain age
doesn't exist anymore

688
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:36,959
doesn't exist anymore
 

689
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,550
doesn't exist anymore
that wouldn't be true of a computer

690
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:38,560
that wouldn't be true of a computer
 

691
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,230
that wouldn't be true of a computer
program

692
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:40,240
program
 

693
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,150
program
you could completely turn it off

694
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:42,160
you could completely turn it off
 

695
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,990
you could completely turn it off
and a copy of it could be stored and you

696
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,000
and a copy of it could be stored and you
 

697
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,990
and a copy of it could be stored and you
could recreate it

698
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:46,000
could recreate it
 

699
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,870
could recreate it
and so it has a different type of uh

700
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:48,880
and so it has a different type of uh
 

701
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,110
and so it has a different type of uh
validity

702
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:51,120
validity
 

703
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,710
validity
you could actually take it back in time

704
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:52,720
you could actually take it back in time
 

705
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,470
you could actually take it back in time
you could eliminate its memory and have

706
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:54,480
you could eliminate its memory and have
 

707
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,470
you could eliminate its memory and have
it go over again i mean it has a

708
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:56,480
it go over again i mean it has a
 

709
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,430
it go over again i mean it has a
different

710
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:57,440
different
 

711
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,790
different
kind of

712
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:58,800
kind of
 

713
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,550
kind of
connotation than

714
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:00,560
connotation than
 

715
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,629
connotation than
humans do well perhaps you can do the

716
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:02,639
humans do well perhaps you can do the
 

717
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,230
humans do well perhaps you can do the
same thing with humans

718
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:04,240
same thing with humans
 

719
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,590
same thing with humans
it's just that we don't know how to do

720
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:05,600
it's just that we don't know how to do
 

721
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,670
it's just that we don't know how to do
that yet yeah it's possible that we

722
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:07,680
that yet yeah it's possible that we
 

723
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,509
that yet yeah it's possible that we
figure out all of these things on the

724
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:09,519
figure out all of these things on the
 

725
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,150
figure out all of these things on the
machine first

726
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,160
machine first
 

727
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,670
machine first
but that doesn't mean the machine isn't

728
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:13,680
but that doesn't mean the machine isn't
 

729
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,269
but that doesn't mean the machine isn't
conscious

730
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:15,279
conscious
 

731
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,629
conscious
i mean if you look at the way people

732
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:16,639
i mean if you look at the way people
 

733
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,110
i mean if you look at the way people
react say three cpo or other

734
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:21,120
react say three cpo or other
 

735
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,310
react say three cpo or other
machines that are conscious in movies

736
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:24,320
machines that are conscious in movies
 

737
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,069
machines that are conscious in movies
uh they don't actually present how it's

738
00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:26,079
uh they don't actually present how it's
 

739
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,430
uh they don't actually present how it's
conscious but

740
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:27,440
conscious but
 

741
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,910
conscious but
we see that they are a machine

742
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:29,920
we see that they are a machine
 

743
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,590
we see that they are a machine
and people will believe that they are

744
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:31,600
and people will believe that they are
 

745
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,110
and people will believe that they are
conscious

746
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:33,120
conscious
 

747
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,550
conscious
and they'll actually worry about it if

748
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:34,560
and they'll actually worry about it if
 

749
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,350
and they'll actually worry about it if
they get into trouble and so on

750
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:37,360
they get into trouble and so on
 

751
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,710
they get into trouble and so on
so 2029 is going to be the first year

752
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:40,720
so 2029 is going to be the first year
 

753
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,069
so 2029 is going to be the first year
when a a major thing happens right and

754
00:13:44,069 --> 00:13:44,079
when a a major thing happens right and
 

755
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,629
when a a major thing happens right and
that that will shake our civilization to

756
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:46,639
that that will shake our civilization to
 

757
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,710
that that will shake our civilization to
start to consider

758
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:48,720
start to consider
 

759
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,150
start to consider
the role of ai

760
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:50,160
the role of ai
 

761
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,750
the role of ai
yes or no i mean

762
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:51,760
yes or no i mean
 

763
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,030
yes or no i mean
this one guy

764
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:53,040
this one guy
 

765
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,269
this one guy
at google claimed that

766
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:55,279
at google claimed that
 

767
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,150
at google claimed that
the machine was conscious

768
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:58,160
the machine was conscious
 

769
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,990
the machine was conscious
but that's just one person

770
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:00,000
but that's just one person
 

771
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,790
but that's just one person
right so it starts to happen at scale

772
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:02,800
right so it starts to happen at scale
 

773
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,430
right so it starts to happen at scale
well that's exactly right because most

774
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:05,440
well that's exactly right because most
 

775
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,670
well that's exactly right because most
people have not taken that position i

776
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:07,680
people have not taken that position i
 

777
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,189
people have not taken that position i
don't take that position i mean i've

778
00:14:09,189 --> 00:14:09,199
don't take that position i mean i've
 

779
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,470
don't take that position i mean i've
used

780
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:10,480
used
 

781
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,310
used
uh

782
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:12,320
uh
 

783
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,829
uh
different things

784
00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:14,839
different things
 

785
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,389
different things
um uh like this and they don't appear to

786
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:18,399
um uh like this and they don't appear to
 

787
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,310
um uh like this and they don't appear to
to me to be conscious

788
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:20,320
to me to be conscious
 

789
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,110
to me to be conscious
as we eliminate various problems of of

790
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:23,120
as we eliminate various problems of of
 

791
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,150
as we eliminate various problems of of
these

792
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:24,160
these
 

793
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,310
these
large language models

794
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:26,320
large language models
 

795
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,629
large language models
uh more and more people will accept that

796
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:28,639
uh more and more people will accept that
 

797
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,750
uh more and more people will accept that
they're conscious so when we get to 2029

798
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:31,760
they're conscious so when we get to 2029
 

799
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,870
they're conscious so when we get to 2029
more

800
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:32,880
more
 

801
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,710
more
i think a large

802
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:34,720
i think a large
 

803
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,790
i think a large
fraction of people will believe that

804
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:36,800
fraction of people will believe that
 

805
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,870
fraction of people will believe that
they're conscious

806
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:38,880
they're conscious
 

807
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,230
they're conscious
so it's not going to happen all at once

808
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:42,240
so it's not going to happen all at once
 

809
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,590
so it's not going to happen all at once
i believe that what actually happen

810
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:43,600
i believe that what actually happen
 

811
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,350
i believe that what actually happen
gradually and it's already started to

812
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:45,360
gradually and it's already started to
 

813
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,110
gradually and it's already started to
happen

814
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:47,120
happen
 

815
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,710
happen
and so that uh takes us one step closer

816
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:50,720
and so that uh takes us one step closer
 

817
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,350
and so that uh takes us one step closer
to the singularity another step then is

818
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:53,360
to the singularity another step then is
 

819
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,350
to the singularity another step then is
in the 2030s

820
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:55,360
in the 2030s
 

821
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,829
in the 2030s
when we can

822
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:56,839
when we can
 

823
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,910
when we can
actually connect our neocortex which is

824
00:14:59,910 --> 00:14:59,920
actually connect our neocortex which is
 

825
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,829
actually connect our neocortex which is
where we do our thinking

826
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:01,839
where we do our thinking
 

827
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,110
where we do our thinking
to

828
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:03,120
to
 

829
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,790
to
computers

830
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:04,800
computers
 

831
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,870
computers
and i mean just as this actually gains a

832
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:08,880
and i mean just as this actually gains a
 

833
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,430
and i mean just as this actually gains a
lot to being connected to

834
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:11,440
lot to being connected to
 

835
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,350
lot to being connected to
computers that will amplify its

836
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:13,360
computers that will amplify its
 

837
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,110
computers that will amplify its
abilities

838
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:15,120
abilities
 

839
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,629
abilities
i mean if this did not have any

840
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:16,639
i mean if this did not have any
 

841
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,509
i mean if this did not have any
connection it would be pretty stupid it

842
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:19,519
connection it would be pretty stupid it
 

843
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,670
connection it would be pretty stupid it
could not answer any of your questions

844
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:21,680
could not answer any of your questions
 

845
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,189
could not answer any of your questions
if you're just listening to this by the

846
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:23,199
if you're just listening to this by the
 

847
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,150
if you're just listening to this by the
way

848
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:24,160
way
 

849
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,670
way
where is holding up

850
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:25,680
where is holding up
 

851
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,990
where is holding up
the uh the all-powerful

852
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:28,000
the uh the all-powerful
 

853
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,710
the uh the all-powerful
uh smartphone so we're gonna do that

854
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:30,720
uh smartphone so we're gonna do that
 

855
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,350
uh smartphone so we're gonna do that
directly from our brains

856
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:33,360
directly from our brains
 

857
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,110
directly from our brains
i mean these are pretty good these

858
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:35,120
i mean these are pretty good these
 

859
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,509
i mean these are pretty good these
already have amplified our intelligence

860
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:37,519
already have amplified our intelligence
 

861
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,269
already have amplified our intelligence
i'm already much smarter than i would

862
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:39,279
i'm already much smarter than i would
 

863
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,389
i'm already much smarter than i would
otherwise be if i didn't have this

864
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:42,399
otherwise be if i didn't have this
 

865
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,310
otherwise be if i didn't have this
because i remember my first book the age

866
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:44,320
because i remember my first book the age
 

867
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,110
because i remember my first book the age
of intelligent machines

868
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:49,120

 

869
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,350

there was no way to get information from

870
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:51,360
there was no way to get information from
 

871
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,030
there was no way to get information from
computers i actually would go to a

872
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,040
computers i actually would go to a
 

873
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,269
computers i actually would go to a
library find a book

874
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:55,279
library find a book
 

875
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,269
library find a book
find the page that had an information i

876
00:15:57,269 --> 00:15:57,279
find the page that had an information i
 

877
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,230
find the page that had an information i
wanted

878
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:58,240
wanted
 

879
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,710
wanted
and i'd go to the copier and my most

880
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:00,720
and i'd go to the copier and my most
 

881
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,230
and i'd go to the copier and my most
significant

882
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:02,240
significant
 

883
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,189
significant
uh

884
00:16:03,189 --> 00:16:03,199
uh
 

885
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,350
uh
information tool was a roll of quarters

886
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:05,360
information tool was a roll of quarters
 

887
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,949
information tool was a roll of quarters
where i could feed the

888
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:06,959
where i could feed the
 

889
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,389
where i could feed the
copier

890
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:08,399
copier
 

891
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,110
copier
so

892
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:09,120
so
 

893
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,310
so
we're already

894
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:10,320
we're already
 

895
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,990
we're already
greatly advanced that we have these

896
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:12,000
greatly advanced that we have these
 

897
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,030
greatly advanced that we have these
things

898
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:13,040
things
 

899
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,269
things
there's a few problems with it

900
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:15,279
there's a few problems with it
 

901
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,110
there's a few problems with it
first of all i constantly put it down

902
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:17,120
first of all i constantly put it down
 

903
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,430
first of all i constantly put it down
and i don't remember where i put it

904
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:19,440
and i don't remember where i put it
 

905
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,870
and i don't remember where i put it
i've actually never lost it but

906
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:22,880
i've actually never lost it but
 

907
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,470
i've actually never lost it but
you have to find it

908
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:24,480
you have to find it
 

909
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,389
you have to find it
then you have to turn it on so there's a

910
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:26,399
then you have to turn it on so there's a
 

911
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,230
then you have to turn it on so there's a
certain amount of steps it would

912
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:28,240
certain amount of steps it would
 

913
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,910
certain amount of steps it would
actually be quite useful

914
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:29,920
actually be quite useful
 

915
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,350
actually be quite useful
if someone would just listen to your

916
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:31,360
if someone would just listen to your
 

917
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,350
if someone would just listen to your
conversation

918
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:33,360
conversation
 

919
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,829
conversation
and say

920
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:34,839
and say
 

921
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,110
and say
uh oh that's

922
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:37,120
uh oh that's
 

923
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,590
uh oh that's
you know so-and-so actress um and tell

924
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:39,600
you know so-and-so actress um and tell
 

925
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,749
you know so-and-so actress um and tell
you what you're talking about so going

926
00:16:41,749 --> 00:16:41,759
you what you're talking about so going
 

927
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,430
you what you're talking about so going
from active to passive where just

928
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:43,440
from active to passive where just
 

929
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,949
from active to passive where just
permeates

930
00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:44,959
permeates
 

931
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,350
permeates
your whole life yeah exactly the way

932
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:47,360
your whole life yeah exactly the way
 

933
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,350
your whole life yeah exactly the way
your brain does when you're awake

934
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:49,360
your brain does when you're awake
 

935
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,110
your brain does when you're awake
your brain is always there

936
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:51,120
your brain is always there
 

937
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,189
your brain is always there
right now that's something that could

938
00:16:53,189 --> 00:16:53,199
right now that's something that could
 

939
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,670
right now that's something that could
actually just just about be done today

940
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:55,680
actually just just about be done today
 

941
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,269
actually just just about be done today
where would listen to your conversation

942
00:16:57,269 --> 00:16:57,279
where would listen to your conversation
 

943
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,870
where would listen to your conversation
understand what you're saying understand

944
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:58,880
understand what you're saying understand
 

945
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,710
understand what you're saying understand
what you're

946
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:00,720
what you're
 

947
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,470
what you're
not missing and give you that

948
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:02,480
not missing and give you that
 

949
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,309
not missing and give you that
information

950
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:04,319
information
 

951
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,829
information
but another step is to actually go

952
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:05,839
but another step is to actually go
 

953
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,590
but another step is to actually go
inside your brain yeah

954
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:09,600

 

955
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,829

and there are some

956
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:11,839
and there are some
 

957
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,669
and there are some
prototypes where you can connect your

958
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:13,679
prototypes where you can connect your
 

959
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,110
prototypes where you can connect your
brain

960
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:15,120
brain
 

961
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,110
brain
they actually don't have the amount of

962
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:17,120
they actually don't have the amount of
 

963
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,029
they actually don't have the amount of
bandwidth that we need

964
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:19,039
bandwidth that we need
 

965
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,470
bandwidth that we need
they can work but they work fairly

966
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:20,480
they can work but they work fairly
 

967
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,829
they can work but they work fairly
slowly

968
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:21,839
slowly
 

969
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,549
slowly
so if if it actually would connect to

970
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:24,559
so if if it actually would connect to
 

971
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,189
so if if it actually would connect to
your neocortex

972
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:27,199
your neocortex
 

973
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,510
your neocortex
and the neocortex which i

974
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:29,520
and the neocortex which i
 

975
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,789
and the neocortex which i
described in how to create a mind

976
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:32,799
described in how to create a mind
 

977
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,630
described in how to create a mind
the neocortex is actually

978
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:36,640

 

979
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,710

it has different levels and as you go up

980
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:38,720
it has different levels and as you go up
 

981
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,830
it has different levels and as you go up
the levels

982
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:39,840
the levels
 

983
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,070
the levels
it's kind of like a pyramid the top

984
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:42,080
it's kind of like a pyramid the top
 

985
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,150
it's kind of like a pyramid the top
level is fairly small

986
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:44,160
level is fairly small
 

987
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,669
level is fairly small
and that's the level where you want to

988
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:45,679
and that's the level where you want to
 

989
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:46,870
and that's the level where you want to
connect

990
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:46,880
connect
 

991
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,669
connect
uh

992
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:47,679
uh
 

993
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:48,710
uh
these

994
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:48,720
these
 

995
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,630
these
brain extenders

996
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:50,640
brain extenders
 

997
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,750
brain extenders
um

998
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:53,760

 

999
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,190

so i believe that will happen in the

1000
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:55,200
so i believe that will happen in the
 

1001
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,990
so i believe that will happen in the
2030s we will actually

1002
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:58,000
2030s we will actually
 

1003
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,630
2030s we will actually
so just the way this is greatly

1004
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:00,640
so just the way this is greatly
 

1005
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,710
so just the way this is greatly
amplified by being connected to the

1006
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:02,720
amplified by being connected to the
 

1007
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,310
amplified by being connected to the
cloud

1008
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:04,320

1009
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,070

we can connect our own brain to the

1010
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:06,080
we can connect our own brain to the
 

1011
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,350
we can connect our own brain to the

cloud
 

1013
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,909
cloud
and

1014
00:18:09,909 --> 00:18:09,919

 

1015
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,789

just do what we can do by using this

1016
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:12,799
just do what we can do by using this
 

1017
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,190
just do what we can do by using this
machine do you think it would look like

1018
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:15,200
machine do you think it would look like
 

1019
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,990
machine do you think it would look like
uh the brain computer interface of like

1020
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:18,000
uh the brain computer interface of like
 

1021
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,909
uh the brain computer interface of like
neuralink so would it be well never

1022
00:18:19,909 --> 00:18:19,919
neuralink so would it be well never
 

1023
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,310
neuralink so would it be well never
length it's an attempt to do that

1024
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:22,320
length it's an attempt to do that
 

1025
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,230
length it's an attempt to do that
it doesn't have the bandwidth that we

1026
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:24,240
it doesn't have the bandwidth that we
 

1027
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,430
it doesn't have the bandwidth that we
need

1028
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:25,440
need
 

1029
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,150
need
um yet right right but i think

1030
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:30,160
um yet right right but i think
 

1031
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,430
um yet right right but i think
i mean they're going to get permission

1032
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:31,440
i mean they're going to get permission
 

1033
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,630
i mean they're going to get permission
for this because there are a lot of

1034
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:32,640
for this because there are a lot of
 

1035
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,029
for this because there are a lot of
people who absolutely need it because

1036
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:35,039
people who absolutely need it because
 

1037
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,190
people who absolutely need it because
they can't communicate and i know a

1038
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:37,200
they can't communicate and i know a
 

1039
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,430
they can't communicate and i know a
couple of people like that who

1040
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:39,440
couple of people like that who
 

1041
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,510
couple of people like that who
have ideas and they cannot

1042
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:41,520
have ideas and they cannot
 

1043
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,549
have ideas and they cannot
they don't

1044
00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:42,559
they don't
 

1045
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,470
they don't
they cannot move their muscles and so on

1046
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:44,480
they cannot move their muscles and so on
 

1047
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,430
they cannot move their muscles and so on
they can't communicate

1048
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:47,440
they can't communicate
 

1049
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,830
they can't communicate
so for them this would be very valuable

1050
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:51,840
so for them this would be very valuable
 

1051
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,630
so for them this would be very valuable
but we could all use it

1052
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:54,640
but we could all use it
 

1053
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,830
but we could all use it
basically

1054
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:55,840
basically
 

1055
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,990
basically
be

1056
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:58,000
be
 

1057
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,870
be
uh

1058
00:18:58,870 --> 00:18:58,880
uh
 

1059
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,190
uh
turn us into something that would be

1060
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:01,200
turn us into something that would be
 

1061
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,430
turn us into something that would be
like we have a phone but

1062
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:03,440
like we have a phone but
 

1063
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,430
like we have a phone but
it would be in our minds it would be

1064
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:05,440
it would be in our minds it would be
 

1065
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,590
it would be in our minds it would be
kind of instantaneous and maybe

1066
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:07,600
kind of instantaneous and maybe
 

1067
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,430
kind of instantaneous and maybe
communication between two people would

1068
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:09,440
communication between two people would
 

1069
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,710
communication between two people would
not require

1070
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:10,720
not require
 

1071
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,909
not require
this low bandwidth mechanism of language

1072
00:19:13,909 --> 00:19:13,919
this low bandwidth mechanism of language
 

1073
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,150
this low bandwidth mechanism of language
yes spoken word exactly we don't know

1074
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:16,160
yes spoken word exactly we don't know
 

1075
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,830
yes spoken word exactly we don't know
what that would be although we do know

1076
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:17,840
what that would be although we do know
 

1077
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,350
what that would be although we do know
that

1078
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:19,360
that
 

1079
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,230
that
computers can share information

1080
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:22,240
computers can share information
 

1081
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,470
computers can share information
like language instantly

1082
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:24,480
like language instantly
 

1083
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,990
like language instantly
they can share

1084
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:26,000
they can share
 

1085
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,710
they can share
many many books in a second

1086
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:28,720
many many books in a second
 

1087
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,029
many many books in a second
so we could do that as well

1088
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:31,039
so we could do that as well
 

1089
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,070
so we could do that as well
if you look at what our brain does

1090
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:34,080
if you look at what our brain does
 

1091
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,070
if you look at what our brain does
it actually

1092
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:36,080
it actually
 

1093
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,150
it actually
can manipulate different parameters

1094
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:40,160
can manipulate different parameters
 

1095
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,630
can manipulate different parameters
so we we talk about these large language

1096
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:42,640
so we we talk about these large language
 

1097
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,990
so we we talk about these large language
models

1098
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:44,000
models
 

1099
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,390
models
um

1100
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:46,400
um
 

1101
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,350
um
i mean i had written that

1102
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:51,360

 

1103
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,270

it requires a certain

1104
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:53,280
it requires a certain
 

1105
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,070
it requires a certain
amount of information in order to

1106
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:56,080
amount of information in order to
 

1107
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,470
amount of information in order to
uh be effective

1108
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:58,480
uh be effective
 

1109
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,310
uh be effective
and that we would not see

1110
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:00,320
and that we would not see
 

1111
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,390
and that we would not see
ai really being effective until it got

1112
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:02,400
ai really being effective until it got
 

1113
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,310
ai really being effective until it got
to that level

1114
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:04,320
to that level
 

1115
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,390
to that level
and we had large language models there

1116
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:06,400
and we had large language models there
 

1117
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,630
and we had large language models there
were like 10 billion bytes didn't work

1118
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:08,640
were like 10 billion bytes didn't work
 

1119
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,390
were like 10 billion bytes didn't work
very well they finally got to 100

1120
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:10,400
very well they finally got to 100
 

1121
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,630
very well they finally got to 100
billion bytes and now they work fairly

1122
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:12,640
billion bytes and now they work fairly
 

1123
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,549
billion bytes and now they work fairly
well and and now we're going to a

1124
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:14,559
well and and now we're going to a
 

1125
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,150
well and and now we're going to a
trillion bytes

1126
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:16,160
trillion bytes
 

1127
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,310
trillion bytes
if you say uh

1128
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:18,320
if you say uh
 

1129
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,390
if you say uh
lambda has a hundred a billion bytes

1130
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:22,400
lambda has a hundred a billion bytes
 

1131
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,390
lambda has a hundred a billion bytes
what does that mean well what

1132
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:24,400
what does that mean well what
 

1133
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,990
what does that mean well what
what if you had something that had one

1134
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:26,000
what if you had something that had one
 

1135
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,789
what if you had something that had one
byte one one parameter

1136
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:28,799
byte one one parameter
 

1137
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,390
byte one one parameter
maybe you want to tell whether or not

1138
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:30,400
maybe you want to tell whether or not
 

1139
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,990
maybe you want to tell whether or not
something's uh

1140
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:32,000
something's uh
 

1141
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,789
something's uh
an elephant or not and so you put in

1142
00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:34,799
an elephant or not and so you put in
 

1143
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,430
an elephant or not and so you put in
something that would detect its trunk

1144
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:37,440
something that would detect its trunk
 

1145
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,190
something that would detect its trunk
if it has a trunk it's an elephant if it

1146
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:39,200
if it has a trunk it's an elephant if it
 

1147
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,390
if it has a trunk it's an elephant if it
doesn't have a trunk it's not an

1148
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:40,400
doesn't have a trunk it's not an
 

1149
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,669
doesn't have a trunk it's not an
elephant

1150
00:20:41,669 --> 00:20:41,679
elephant
 

1151
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,350
elephant
that will work

1152
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:43,360
that will work
 

1153
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,190
that will work
fairly well there's a few problems with

1154
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:47,200
fairly well there's a few problems with
 

1155
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:47,669
fairly well there's a few problems with
and it

1156
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:47,679
and it
 

1157
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,029
and it
really wouldn't be able to tell what the

1158
00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:49,039
really wouldn't be able to tell what the
 

1159
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,350
really wouldn't be able to tell what the
trunk is but anyway and maybe other

1160
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:51,360
trunk is but anyway and maybe other
 

1161
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,909
trunk is but anyway and maybe other
things other than elephants have trunks

1162
00:20:53,909 --> 00:20:53,919
things other than elephants have trunks
 

1163
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,669
things other than elephants have trunks
you might get really confused yeah

1164
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:55,679
you might get really confused yeah
 

1165
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,070
you might get really confused yeah
exactly uh i'm not sure which animals

1166
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:58,080
exactly uh i'm not sure which animals
 

1167
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,390
exactly uh i'm not sure which animals
have trunks but you know

1168
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:00,400
have trunks but you know
 

1169
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,549
have trunks but you know
that's how you define a trunk but yeah

1170
00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:02,559
that's how you define a trunk but yeah
 

1171
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,110
that's how you define a trunk but yeah
that's one parameter

1172
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:05,120
that's one parameter
 

1173
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,190
that's one parameter
you can do okay so these things have a

1174
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:07,200
you can do okay so these things have a
 

1175
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,950
you can do okay so these things have a
hundred billion parameters so they're

1176
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:08,960
hundred billion parameters so they're
 

1177
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,149
hundred billion parameters so they're
able to deal with very complex issues

1178
00:21:12,149 --> 00:21:12,159
able to deal with very complex issues
 

1179
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:13,830
able to deal with very complex issues
all kinds of trunks

1180

human beings actually have a little bit

1182
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:15,520
human beings actually have a little bit
 

1183
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,270
human beings actually have a little bit
more than that but they're getting to

1184
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:17,280
more than that but they're getting to
 

1185
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,549
more than that but they're getting to
the point where they can emulate humans

1186
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:20,559
the point where they can emulate humans
 

1187
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,310
the point where they can emulate humans
um

1188
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:22,320
um
 

1189
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,590
um
if we were able to connect this to our

1190
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:25,600
if we were able to connect this to our
 

1191
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,350
if we were able to connect this to our
neocortex

1192
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:27,360
neocortex
 

1193
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,950
neocortex
we would basically add

1194
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:30,960
we would basically add
 

1195
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,710
we would basically add
more of these

1196
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:32,720
more of these
 

1197
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,190
more of these
abilities to make distinctions

1198
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:35,200
abilities to make distinctions
 

1199
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,430
abilities to make distinctions
and it could ultimately be much smaller

1200
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:37,440
and it could ultimately be much smaller
 

1201
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,549
and it could ultimately be much smaller
and also be attached to information that

1202
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:40,559
and also be attached to information that
 

1203
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,029
and also be attached to information that
we feel is reliable

1204
00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:43,039
we feel is reliable
 

1205
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,510
we feel is reliable
um so that's where we're headed so you

1206
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:45,520
um so that's where we're headed so you
 

1207
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,830
um so that's where we're headed so you
think that there will be a merger in the

1208
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:47,840
think that there will be a merger in the
 

1209
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,950
think that there will be a merger in the
30s

1210
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:48,960
30s
 

1211
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,110
30s
an increasing amount of merging between

1212
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:51,120
an increasing amount of merging between
 

1213
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,990
an increasing amount of merging between
the either human brain and the

1214
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:54,000
the either human brain and the
 

1215
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,909
the either human brain and the
ai brain

1216
00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:55,919
ai brain
 

1217
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,510
ai brain
exactly

1218
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:57,520
exactly
 

1219
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,470
exactly
and the ai brain is really an

1220
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:00,480
and the ai brain is really an
 

1221
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,549
and the ai brain is really an
emulation of human beings i mean that's

1222
00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:02,559
emulation of human beings i mean that's
 

1223
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,390
emulation of human beings i mean that's
why we're creating them

1224
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:04,400
why we're creating them
 

1225
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,029
why we're creating them
because human beings act the same way

1226
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:07,039
because human beings act the same way
 

1227
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,510
because human beings act the same way
and this is basically to amplify them i

1228
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:09,520
and this is basically to amplify them i
 

1229
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,590
and this is basically to amplify them i
mean this amplifies our brain um

1230
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:13,600
mean this amplifies our brain um
 

1231
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,270
mean this amplifies our brain um
it's a little bit clumsy to interact

being and they were able to simulate
 

1291
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,190
being and they were able to simulate
that quite reliably

1292
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:21,200
that quite reliably
 

1293
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,990
that quite reliably
and we actually simulated billions of

1294
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:24,000
and we actually simulated billions of
 

1295
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,870
and we actually simulated billions of
different mrna sequences

different mrna sequences
 

1297
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,390
different mrna sequences
and they found the ones that they were

00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:28,400
and they found the ones that they were
 

1299
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,870
and they found the ones that they were
the best and they created the vaccine

1300
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:30,880
the best and they created the vaccine
 

1301
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,870
the best and they created the vaccine
and they did and talked about doing that

1302
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:32,880
and they did and talked about doing that
 

1303
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,909
and they did and talked about doing that
quickly

1304
00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:33,919
quickly
 

1305
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,470
quickly
they did that in two days now how long

1306
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:36,480
they did that in two days now how long
 

1307
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,630
they did that in two days now how long
would a human being take to simulate

1308
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:38,640
would a human being take to simulate
 

1309
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,430
would a human being take to simulate
billions of different mrna sequences i i

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,630
billions of different mrna sequences i i
don't know that we could do it at all

1312
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:42,640
don't know that we could do it at all
 

1313
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,830
don't know that we could do it at all
but it would

1314
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:43,840
but it would
 

1315
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,669
but it would
take many years

1316
00:23:45,669 --> 00:23:45,679
take many years
 

1317
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,230
take many years
they did it in two days

1318
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:48,240
they did it in two days
 

1319
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,110
they did it in two days
and

1320
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:49,120
and
 

1321
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,190
and
one of the reasons that people didn't

1322
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:51,200
one of the reasons that people didn't
 

1323
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,590
one of the reasons that people didn't
like vaccines

1324
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:53,600
like vaccines
 

1325
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,270
like vaccines
is because it was done too quickly you

1326
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:55,280
is because it was done too quickly you
 

1327
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,070
is because it was done too quickly you
know it's done too fast

1328
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:58,080
know it's done too fast
 

1329
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,070
know it's done too fast
and they actually included the time it

1330
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:00,080
and they actually included the time it
 

1331
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,789
and they actually included the time it
took to test it out which was 10 months

1332
00:24:02,789 --> 00:24:02,799
took to test it out which was 10 months
 

1333
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,950
took to test it out which was 10 months
so they figured okay it took 10 months

1334
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:04,960
so they figured okay it took 10 months
 

1335
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,230
so they figured okay it took 10 months
to create this

1336
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:06,240
to create this
 

1337
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,950
to create this
actually it took us two days

1338
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:08,960
actually it took us two days
 

1339
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,789
actually it took us two days
and we also will be able to ultimately

1340
00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:10,799
and we also will be able to ultimately
 

1341
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,990
and we also will be able to ultimately
do the tests in a few days as well

1342
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:14,000
do the tests in a few days as well
 

1343
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,750
do the tests in a few days as well
oh because we can stimulate how the body

1344
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:15,760
oh because we can stimulate how the body
 

1345
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,350
oh because we can stimulate how the body
will respond to it yeah

1346
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:17,360
will respond to it yeah
 

1347
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,950
will respond to it yeah
that's a little bit more complicated

1348
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:18,960
that's a little bit more complicated
 

1349
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,230
that's a little bit more complicated
because the body's

1350
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:20,240
because the body's
 

1351
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,230
because the body's
has a lot of different

1352
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:22,240
has a lot of different
 

1353
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,230
has a lot of different
elements and we have to simulate all of

1354
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:24,240
elements and we have to simulate all of
 

1355
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,269
elements and we have to simulate all of
that

1356
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:25,279
that
 

1357
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,269
that
but that's coming as well

1358
00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:27,279
but that's coming as well
 

1359
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,590
but that's coming as well
so ultimately we could create it in a

1360
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:29,600
so ultimately we could create it in a
 

1361
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,350
so ultimately we could create it in a
few days and then test it in a few days

1362
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:31,360
few days and then test it in a few days
 

1363
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,269
few days and then test it in a few days
and would be done

1364
00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:33,279
and would be done
 

1365
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,310
and would be done
uh and we can do that with every type of

1366
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:36,320
uh and we can do that with every type of
 

1367
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,710
uh and we can do that with every type of
medical ins you know insufficiency that

1368
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:38,720
medical ins you know insufficiency that
 

1369
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,070
medical ins you know insufficiency that
we have

1370
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:40,080
we have
 

1371
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,549
we have
so curing all diseases

1372
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:42,559
so curing all diseases
 

1373
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:43,830
so curing all diseases
yeah

1374
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:43,840
yeah
 

1375
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,669

well that's where we're headed because i

1386
00:24:58,149 --> 00:24:58,159
well that's where we're headed because i
 

1387
00:24:58,159 --> 00:24:59,590
well that's where we're headed because i
mean right right now we have a very

00:24:59,590 --> 00:24:59,600
mean right right now we have a very

00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,430
mean right right now we have a very

00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,149
um
but we've already shown it and the

1396
00:25:06,149 --> 00:25:06,159
but we've already shown it and the
 

1397
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,870
but we've already shown it and the
moderna vaccine is actually the best

1398
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:08,880
moderna vaccine is actually the best
 

1399
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,310
moderna vaccine is actually the best
uh of the of the vaccines we've had

1400
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:12,320
uh of the of the vaccines we've had
 

1401
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,510
uh of the of the vaccines we've had
and it literally took two days to create

1402
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:15,520
and it literally took two days to create
 

1403
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,269
and it literally took two days to create
uh and we'll get to the point where we

1404
00:25:17,269 --> 00:25:17,279
uh and we'll get to the point where we
 

1405
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,909
uh and we'll get to the point where we
can test it out also quickly

1406
00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:19,919
can test it out also quickly

1419
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,909
is a protein and it's 3d shape
it's pretty remarkable that they can

00:25:37,909 --> 00:25:37,919
it's pretty remarkable that they can
 

1421
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,149
it's pretty remarkable that they can
actually predict what the 3d shape of

actually predict what the 3d shape of
 

1423
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,950
actually predict what the 3d shape of
these things are but they did it with

1424
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:42,960
these things are but they did it with
 

1425
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,390
these things are but they did it with
the same

1426
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:44,400
the same
 

1427
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,950
the same
type of neural net that

1428
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:46,960
type of neural net that
 

1429
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,350
type of neural net that
won for example the go

1430
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:49,360
won for example the go
 

1431
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,110
won for example the go
uh test

1432
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:51,120
uh test
 

1433
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,549
uh test
so it's all the same

1434
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:52,559
so it's all the same
 

1435
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:53,909
so it's all the same
it's all the same

it's all the same
 

1437
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,590
it's all the same
they took that same thing

1438
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:55,600
they took that same thing
 

1439
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,710
they took that same thing
and just changed the rules to chess

1440
00:25:58,710 --> 00:25:58,720
and just changed the rules to chess
 

1441
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,909
and just changed the rules to chess
and within a couple of days it now

1442
00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:01,919
and within a couple of days it now
 

1443
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,230
and within a couple of days it now
played a master level of chess greater

1444
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:04,240
played a master level of chess greater
 

1445
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:09,029
played a master level of chess greater
than any human being

1447
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,950

and and the same thing then worked for

1448
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:10,960

and what does that look like
 

1475
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,390
and what does that look like
you know once we can

yeah so looking at price performance of

1490
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:56,720
yeah so looking at price performance of
 

1491
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,070
yeah so looking at price performance of
computation from 1939 to 2021. right so

1492
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:00,080
computation from 1939 to 2021. right so
 

1493
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,430
computation from 1939 to 2021. right so
that starts

1494
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:01,440
that starts
 

1495
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,110
that starts
with the very first computer actually

00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:03,120
with the very first computer actually

1499
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,430
created by german during world war ii
and you might have

1500
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:07,440

00:27:09,269 --> 00:27:09,279
thought that that might be significant
 

1503
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,669
thought that that might be significant
but actually the germans

1504
00:27:11,669 --> 00:27:11,679
but actually the germans
 

1505
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,750
but actually the germans
didn't think computers were significant

1506

didn't think computers were significant
 

1507
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,470
didn't think computers were significant

1559
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,230

because that's not all intel

1576
00:28:25,269 --> 00:28:25,279
because that's not all intel
 

1577
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,909
because that's not all intel
in fact it started decades before intel

00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,590
in fact it started decades before intel
was even created

was even created
 

1581
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,789

1585
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,830

so it's not just transistor count or

1586
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:35,840
so it's not just transistor count or
 

1587
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,990
so it's not just transistor count or
transistor size right that's a bunch of

um
and the

and the
 

1605
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,070

intel actually was

00:29:00,549 --> 00:29:00,559
intel actually was
 

1613
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,710
intel actually was
a key part of this

1614
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:02,720
a key part of this
 

1615
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,710
a key part of this
but a few years ago they they stopped

1616
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:04,720
but a few years ago they they stopped
 

1617
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,830
but a few years ago they they stopped
making the

1618
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:05,840
making the
 

1619
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,669
making the
fastest chips

1620
00:29:07,669 --> 00:29:07,679
fastest chips
 

1621
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:08,710
fastest chips
uh

1622
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:08,720
uh
 

1623
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,350
uh
but if you take the fastest chip of any

1624
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:11,360
but if you take the fastest chip of any
 

1625
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,710

in that year
 

1629
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,470
in that year
you get this kind of graph

1630
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:16,480
you get this kind of graph
 

1631
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,029
you get this kind of graph
and it's definitely continuing for 80

1633
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,269
and it's definitely continuing for 80
years so you don't think moore's law

1634
00:29:21,269 --> 00:29:21,279
years so you don't think moore's law
 

1635

1643
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,070
throughout this process i don't like the

software gains which is a whole other
 

1669
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,430
software gains which is a whole other
issue

1670
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:01,440

 

1671
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,269

and they really multiply whatever you

1672
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:03,279
and they really multiply whatever you
 

1673
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,230
and they really multiply whatever you
get from software gains you multiply by

1674
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:06,240
get from software gains you multiply by
 

1675
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,750
get from software gains you multiply by
the computer gains

1676
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:07,760
the computer gains
 

1677
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,549
the computer gains
you get faster and faster speed

1678
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:10,559
you get faster and faster speed
 

1679
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,110
you get faster and faster speed
uh this is actually the fastest computer

1680
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:13,120
uh this is actually the fastest computer
 

1681
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,230
uh this is actually the fastest computer
models

1682
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:14,240
models
 

1683
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,549
models
that have been created and that actually

1684
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:16,559
that have been created and that actually
 

1685
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,149
that have been created and that actually
expands

1686
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:18,159
expands
 

1687
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:20,070
expands
roughly twice a year like every six

1688
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:20,080
roughly twice a year like every six
 

1689
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,710
roughly twice a year like every six
months it expands by two

1690
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:22,720
months it expands by two
 

1691
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,470
months it expands by two
so we're looking at a plot from 2010 to

1692
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:26,480
so we're looking at a plot from 2010 to
 

1693
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,230
so we're looking at a plot from 2010 to
2022

1694
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:28,240
2022
 

1695
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,389
2022
on the x-axis is the publication date of

1696
00:30:30,389 --> 00:30:30,399
on the x-axis is the publication date of
 

1697
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:32,630
on the x-axis is the publication date of
the model and the perhaps sometimes the

1698
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:32,640
the model and the perhaps sometimes the
 

1699
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,830
the model and the perhaps sometimes the
actual paper associated with it and on

1700
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:34,840
actual paper associated with it and on
 

1701
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:40,070
actual paper associated with it and on
the y-axis is training compute and flops

1702
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:40,080
the y-axis is training compute and flops
 

1703
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,470
the y-axis is training compute and flops
and so basically this is

1704
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:42,480
and so basically this is
 

1705
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,110
and so basically this is
looking at the increase in the

1706
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:45,120
looking at the increase in the
 

1707
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,230
looking at the increase in the
not transistors but the computational

1708
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:48,240
not transistors but the computational
 

1709
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,750
not transistors but the computational
power of neural networks yeah it's the

1710
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:51,760
power of neural networks yeah it's the
 

1711
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,669
power of neural networks yeah it's the
computational power that created these

1712
00:30:53,669 --> 00:30:53,679
computational power that created these
 

1713
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,029
computational power that created these
models

1714
00:30:55,029 --> 00:30:55,039
models
 

1715
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:57,350
models
and that's doubled every six months

1716
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:57,360
and that's doubled every six months
 

1717
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,750
and that's doubled every six months
which is even faster than transistor

1718
00:30:59,750 --> 00:30:59,760
which is even faster than transistor
 

1719
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,149
which is even faster than transistor
division yeah

1720
00:31:02,149 --> 00:31:02,159
division yeah
 

1721
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,470
division yeah
actually since it goes faster than the

1722
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:04,480
actually since it goes faster than the
 

1723
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,710
actually since it goes faster than the
the amount of cost

1724
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:06,720
the amount of cost
 

1725
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,190
the amount of cost
this has actually become a greater

1726
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:09,200
this has actually become a greater
 

1727
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,710
this has actually become a greater
investment

1728
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:10,720
investment
 

1729
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,149
investment
to create these

1730
00:31:12,149 --> 00:31:12,159
to create these
 

1731
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,549
to create these
but at any rate by the time we get to

1732
00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:14,559
but at any rate by the time we get to
 

1733
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,549
but at any rate by the time we get to
2045

1734
00:31:16,549 --> 00:31:16,559
2045
 

1735
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,149
2045
we'll be able to multiply our

1736
00:31:18,149 --> 00:31:18,159
we'll be able to multiply our
 

1737
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,350
we'll be able to multiply our
intelligence many millions fold

1738
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:21,360
intelligence many millions fold
 

1739
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,350
intelligence many millions fold
and it's just very hard to imagine what

1740
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:23,360
and it's just very hard to imagine what
 

1741
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,950
and it's just very hard to imagine what
that would be like

1742
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:24,960
that would be like
 

1743
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,029
that would be like
and that's the singularity what we can't

1744
00:31:27,029 --> 00:31:27,039
and that's the singularity what we can't
 

1745
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:29,350
and that's the singularity what we can't
even imagine right that's why we call it

1746
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:29,360
even imagine right that's why we call it
 

1747
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,190
even imagine right that's why we call it
the singularity because the singularity

1748
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:31,200
the singularity because the singularity
 

1749
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,630
the singularity because the singularity
in physics

1750
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:32,640
in physics
 

1751
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,310
in physics
something gets sucked into its

1752
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:34,320
something gets sucked into its
 

1753
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,909
something gets sucked into its
singularity and you can't tell what's

1754
00:31:35,909 --> 00:31:35,919
singularity and you can't tell what's
 

1755
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:37,669
singularity and you can't tell what's
going on in there

1756
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:37,679
going on in there
 

1757
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,310
going on in there
because no information can get out of it

1758
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:40,320
because no information can get out of it
 

1759
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,950
because no information can get out of it
there's various problems with that but

1760
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:42,960
there's various problems with that but
 

1761
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,269
there's various problems with that but
that's the idea it's too

1762
00:31:45,269 --> 00:31:45,279
that's the idea it's too
 

1763
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,470
that's the idea it's too
um

1764
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:46,480
um
 

1765
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,789
um
it's too much beyond what we can imagine

1766
00:31:48,789 --> 00:31:48,799
it's too much beyond what we can imagine
 

1767
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,230
it's too much beyond what we can imagine
do you think it's possible we don't

1768
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:50,240
do you think it's possible we don't
 

1769
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,990
do you think it's possible we don't
notice

1770
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:52,000
notice
 

1771
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,630
notice
that what the singularity actually feels

1772
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:54,640
that what the singularity actually feels
 

1773
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,230
that what the singularity actually feels
like

1774
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:56,240
like
 

1775
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,590
like
is we just live through it

1776
00:31:59,590 --> 00:31:59,600
is we just live through it
 

1777
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,549
is we just live through it
with exponentially increasing

1778
00:32:02,549 --> 00:32:02,559
with exponentially increasing
 

1779
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,269
with exponentially increasing
uh cognitive capabilities

1780
00:32:05,269 --> 00:32:05,279
uh cognitive capabilities
 

1781
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,110
uh cognitive capabilities
and we almost because everything's

1782
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:07,120
and we almost because everything's
 

1783
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,430
and we almost because everything's
moving so quickly don't

1784
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:09,440
moving so quickly don't
 

1785
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,909
moving so quickly don't
aren't really able to introspect that

1786
00:32:11,909 --> 00:32:11,919
aren't really able to introspect that
 

1787
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:14,789
aren't really able to introspect that
our life has changed yeah but i mean we

1788
00:32:14,789 --> 00:32:14,799
our life has changed yeah but i mean we
 

1789
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,509
our life has changed yeah but i mean we
will have that much greater capacity to

1790
00:32:17,509 --> 00:32:17,519
will have that much greater capacity to
 

1791
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,190
will have that much greater capacity to
understand things so we should be able

1792
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:19,200
understand things so we should be able
 

1793
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,630
understand things so we should be able
to look back

1794
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:20,640
to look back
 

1795
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,789
to look back
looking at history understand history

1796
00:32:22,789 --> 00:32:22,799
looking at history understand history
 

1797
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,430
looking at history understand history
but but we will need people

1798
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:25,440
but but we will need people
 

1799
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,350
but but we will need people
basically like you and me to actually

1800
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:27,360
basically like you and me to actually
 

1801
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,190
basically like you and me to actually
think about this think about it

1802
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:29,200
think about this think about it
 

1803
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,110
think about this think about it
but we might be distracted by all the

1804
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:31,120
but we might be distracted by all the
 

1805
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,990
but we might be distracted by all the
other sources of entertainment and fun

1806
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:34,000
other sources of entertainment and fun
 

1807
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,310
other sources of entertainment and fun
because

1808
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:36,320
because
 

1809
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,789
because
the exponential power of intellect is

1810
00:32:38,789 --> 00:32:38,799
the exponential power of intellect is
 

1811
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,310
the exponential power of intellect is
growing but also

1812
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:40,320
growing but also
 

1813
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,750
growing but also
there'll be a lot of fun uh

1814
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:43,760
there'll be a lot of fun uh
 

1815
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,990
there'll be a lot of fun uh
the the amount of ways you can have you

1816
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:46,000
the the amount of ways you can have you
 

1817
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,509
the the amount of ways you can have you
know i mean we already have a lot of fun

1818
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:47,519
know i mean we already have a lot of fun
 

1819
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,110
know i mean we already have a lot of fun
with computer games and so on that are

1820
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:49,120
with computer games and so on that are
 

1821
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,430
with computer games and so on that are
really quite remarkable

1822
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:51,440
really quite remarkable
 

1823
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,590
really quite remarkable
what do you think about uh the digital

1824
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:53,600
what do you think about uh the digital
 

1825
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,389
what do you think about uh the digital
world uh the metaverse

1826
00:32:56,389 --> 00:32:56,399
world uh the metaverse
 

1827
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,230
world uh the metaverse
virtual reality will that have a

1828
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:58,240
virtual reality will that have a
 

1829
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,230
virtual reality will that have a
component in this or will most of our

1830
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:00,240
component in this or will most of our
 

1831
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,070
component in this or will most of our
advancement be in physical realm well

1832
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:02,080
advancement be in physical realm well
 

1833
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,549
advancement be in physical realm well
that's a little bit like second life

1834
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:04,559
that's a little bit like second life
 

1835
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,149
that's a little bit like second life
although the second life actually didn't

1836
00:33:06,149 --> 00:33:06,159
although the second life actually didn't
 

1837
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:07,830
although the second life actually didn't
work very well because it couldn't

1838
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:07,840
work very well because it couldn't
 

1839
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,470
work very well because it couldn't
actually handle too many people and

1840
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:10,480
actually handle too many people and
 

1841
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,509
actually handle too many people and
i don't think the metaverse has

1842
00:33:13,509 --> 00:33:13,519
i don't think the metaverse has
 

1843
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,110
i don't think the metaverse has
come to being i think there will be

1844
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:15,120
come to being i think there will be
 

1845
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,789
come to being i think there will be
something like that

1846
00:33:16,789 --> 00:33:16,799
something like that
 

1847
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,029
something like that
it won't necessarily be

1848
00:33:19,029 --> 00:33:19,039
it won't necessarily be
 

1849
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,190
it won't necessarily be
from that one company

1850
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:21,200
from that one company
 

1851
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,509
from that one company
i mean there's going to be competitors

1852
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:23,519
i mean there's going to be competitors
 

1853
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,269
i mean there's going to be competitors
but yes we're going to live increasingly

1854
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:25,279
but yes we're going to live increasingly
 

1855
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:26,549
but yes we're going to live increasingly
online

1856
00:33:26,549 --> 00:33:26,559
online
 

1857
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,470
online
and particularly when if our brains are

1858
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:28,480
and particularly when if our brains are
 

1859
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,350
and particularly when if our brains are
online i mean how could we not be online

1860
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:31,360
online i mean how could we not be online
 

1861
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,590
online i mean how could we not be online
do you think it's possible that given

1862
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:33,600
do you think it's possible that given
 

1863
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,230
do you think it's possible that given
this merger with ai most of our

1864
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:36,240
this merger with ai most of our
 

1865
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,149
this merger with ai most of our
meaningful

1866
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:38,159
meaningful
 

1867
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,710
meaningful
interactions will be in this

1868
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:40,720
interactions will be in this
 

1869
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,549
interactions will be in this
virtual world

1870
00:33:42,549 --> 00:33:42,559
virtual world
 

1871
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,029
virtual world
most of our life we fall in love we make

1872
00:33:45,029 --> 00:33:45,039
most of our life we fall in love we make
 

1873
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,149
most of our life we fall in love we make
friends

1874
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:46,159
friends
 

1875
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:47,509
friends
we come up with ideas we do

1876
00:33:47,509 --> 00:33:47,519
we come up with ideas we do
 

1877
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,669
we come up with ideas we do
collaborations we have fun i actually

1878
00:33:49,669 --> 00:33:49,679
collaborations we have fun i actually
 

1879
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,590
collaborations we have fun i actually
know somebody who's marrying somebody

1880
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:51,600
know somebody who's marrying somebody
 

1881
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,830
know somebody who's marrying somebody
that they never met yeah

1882
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:53,840
that they never met yeah
 

1883
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,470
that they never met yeah
uh i think they just met her briefly

1884
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:56,480
uh i think they just met her briefly
 

1885
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,190
uh i think they just met her briefly
before the wedding but she actu she

1886
00:33:59,190 --> 00:33:59,200
before the wedding but she actu she
 

1887
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,710
before the wedding but she actu she
actually fell in love with this other

1888
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:00,720
actually fell in love with this other
 

1889
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,149
actually fell in love with this other
person

1890
00:34:02,149 --> 00:34:02,159
person
 

1891
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:05,110
person
uh never having met them

1892
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:05,120
uh never having met them
 

1893
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,830
uh never having met them
uh and i think it's

1894
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:07,840
uh and i think it's
 

1895
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,149
uh and i think it's
i think the love is real so

1896
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:10,159
i think the love is real so
 

1897
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,669
i think the love is real so
that's a beautiful story but do you

1898
00:34:11,669 --> 00:34:11,679
that's a beautiful story but do you
 

1899
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,030
that's a beautiful story but do you
think that story

1900
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:13,040
think that story
 

1901
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,030
think that story
is one that might be experienced as

1902
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:15,040
is one that might be experienced as
 

1903
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,470
is one that might be experienced as
opposed to by

1904
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:16,480
opposed to by
 

1905
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,190
opposed to by
hundreds of thousands of people but

1906
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:19,200
hundreds of thousands of people but
 

1907
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,030
hundreds of thousands of people but
instead by hundreds of millions of

1908
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:21,040
instead by hundreds of millions of
 

1909
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,069
instead by hundreds of millions of
people

1910
00:34:22,069 --> 00:34:22,079
people
 

1911
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,750
people
i mean it really gives you appreciation

1912
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:23,760
i mean it really gives you appreciation
 

1913
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,069
i mean it really gives you appreciation
for these virtual ways of

1914
00:34:26,069 --> 00:34:26,079
for these virtual ways of
 

1915
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,750
for these virtual ways of
communicating

1916
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:27,760
communicating
 

1917
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,389
communicating
uh and if anybody can do it then it's

1918
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:30,399
uh and if anybody can do it then it's
 

1919
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,389
uh and if anybody can do it then it's
really not such a

1920
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:32,399
really not such a
 

1921
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,510
really not such a
freak story uh so i think more and more

1922
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:35,520
freak story uh so i think more and more
 

1923
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,270
freak story uh so i think more and more
people will do that

1924
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:37,280
people will do that
 

1925
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,430
people will do that
but that's turning our back on our

1926
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:39,440
but that's turning our back on our
 

1927
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,389
but that's turning our back on our
entire history of evolution or the old

1928
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:42,399
entire history of evolution or the old
 

1929
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,550
entire history of evolution or the old
days we used to fall in love by

1930
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:44,560
days we used to fall in love by
 

1931
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,629
days we used to fall in love by
holding hands

1932
00:34:46,629 --> 00:34:46,639
holding hands
 

1933
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,629
holding hands
and sitting by the fire that kind of

1934
00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:48,639
and sitting by the fire that kind of
 

1935
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,030
and sitting by the fire that kind of
stuff here you're actually i actually

1936
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:51,040
stuff here you're actually i actually
 

1937
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,589
stuff here you're actually i actually
have five patents on where you can hold

1938
00:34:53,589 --> 00:34:53,599
have five patents on where you can hold
 

1939
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:54,550
have five patents on where you can hold
hands

1940
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:54,560
hands
 

1941
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,950
hands
even if you're separated

1942
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:56,960
even if you're separated
 

1943
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,550
even if you're separated
great um

1944
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:58,560
great um
 

1945
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,829
great um
so the touch the sense it's all just

1946
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:00,839
so the touch the sense it's all just
 

1947
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:03,670
so the touch the sense it's all just
senses it's all just yeah i mean

1948
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:03,680
senses it's all just yeah i mean
 

1949
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,630
senses it's all just yeah i mean
it is

1950
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:04,640
it is
 

1951
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,230
it is
it's not just that you're touching

1952
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:06,240
it's not just that you're touching
 

1953
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,470
it's not just that you're touching
someone or not there's a whole way of

1954
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:08,480
someone or not there's a whole way of
 

1955
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,349
someone or not there's a whole way of
doing it and it's very subtle and

1956
00:35:11,349 --> 00:35:11,359
doing it and it's very subtle and
 

1957
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,270
doing it and it's very subtle and
but ultimately we can

1958
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:13,280
but ultimately we can
 

1959
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,390
but ultimately we can
emulate

1960
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:14,400
emulate
 

1961
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,349
emulate
all of that

1962
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:17,359
all of that
 

1963
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:19,670
all of that
are you excited by that future

1964
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:19,680
are you excited by that future
 

1965
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,349
are you excited by that future
do you worry about that future

1966
00:35:23,349 --> 00:35:23,359

 

1967
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:25,030

i have certain worries about the future

1968
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:25,040
i have certain worries about the future
 

1969
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,560
i have certain worries about the future
but not not that virtual touch

1970
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:27,570
but not not that virtual touch
 

1971
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:29,589
but not not that virtual touch
[Laughter]

1972
00:35:29,589 --> 00:35:29,599
[Laughter]
 

1973
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,510
[Laughter]
well i agree with you

1974
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:31,520
well i agree with you
 

1975
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,670
well i agree with you
you described six stages in the

1976
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:33,680
you described six stages in the
 

1977
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,430
you described six stages in the
evolution of information processing in

1978
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:35,440
evolution of information processing in
 

1979
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,349
evolution of information processing in
the universe as you started to describe

1980
00:35:39,349 --> 00:35:39,359
the universe as you started to describe
 

1981
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:40,870
the universe as you started to describe
can you maybe

1982
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:40,880
can you maybe
 

1983
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,589
can you maybe
talk through some of those stages from

1984
00:35:43,589 --> 00:35:43,599
talk through some of those stages from
 

1985
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,750
talk through some of those stages from
the physics and chemistry to dna and

1986
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:45,760
the physics and chemistry to dna and
 

1987
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,710
the physics and chemistry to dna and
brains and then to the to the very end

1988
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:48,720
brains and then to the to the very end
 

1989
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,630
brains and then to the to the very end
to the very beautiful end

1990
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:50,640
to the very beautiful end
 

1991
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,710
to the very beautiful end
of this process well it actually gets

1992
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:52,720
of this process well it actually gets
 

1993
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,870
of this process well it actually gets
more rapid

1994
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:54,880
more rapid
 

1995
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,870
more rapid
so physics and chemistry that's how we

1996
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:56,880
so physics and chemistry that's how we
 

1997
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,550
so physics and chemistry that's how we
started

1998
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:58,560
started
 

1999
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,310
started
um

2000
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:00,320
um
 

2001
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,150
um
the very beginning of the universe we

2002
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:02,160
the very beginning of the universe we
 

2003
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,710
the very beginning of the universe we
had lots of electrons and various things

2004
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:04,720
had lots of electrons and various things
 

2005
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,190
had lots of electrons and various things
traveling around

2006
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:07,200
traveling around
 

2007
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,750
traveling around
and and that took actually many billions

2008
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:09,760
and and that took actually many billions
 

2009
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,349
and and that took actually many billions
of years

2010
00:36:11,349 --> 00:36:11,359
of years
 

2011
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:13,589
of years
kind of jumping ahead here

2012
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:13,599
kind of jumping ahead here
 

2013
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:14,790
kind of jumping ahead here
to kind of

2014
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:14,800
to kind of
 

2015
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,470
to kind of
some of the last stages where we have

2016
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:16,480
some of the last stages where we have
 

2017
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,190
some of the last stages where we have
things like love and creativity

2018
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:19,200
things like love and creativity
 

2019
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,870
things like love and creativity
it's really quite remarkable that that

2020
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:20,880
it's really quite remarkable that that
 

2021
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,630
it's really quite remarkable that that
happens

2022
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:22,640
happens
 

2023
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,589
happens
but finally physics and chemistry

2024
00:36:25,589 --> 00:36:25,599
but finally physics and chemistry
 

2025
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,910
but finally physics and chemistry
created biology

2026
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:27,920
created biology
 

2027
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,750
created biology
and dna

2028
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:29,760
and dna
 

2029
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,390
and dna
and now you had actually one type of

2030
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:32,400
and now you had actually one type of
 

2031
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,349
and now you had actually one type of
molecule that described the cutting edge

2032
00:36:35,349 --> 00:36:35,359
molecule that described the cutting edge
 

2033
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,550
molecule that described the cutting edge
of this process

2034
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:38,560
of this process
 

2035
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,430
of this process
and we

2036
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:39,440
and we
 

2037
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,310
and we
go from physics and chemistry to biology

2038
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:44,320

 

2039
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,910

and finally biology created brains

2040
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:47,920
and finally biology created brains
 

2041
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,150
and finally biology created brains
i mean not all not everything that's

2042
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:50,160
i mean not all not everything that's
 

2043
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,349
i mean not all not everything that's
created by biology has a brain

2044
00:36:53,349 --> 00:36:53,359
created by biology has a brain
 

2045
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:56,310
created by biology has a brain
but eventually brains came along

2046
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:56,320
but eventually brains came along
 

2047
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,150
but eventually brains came along
and all of this is happening faster and

2048
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:58,160
and all of this is happening faster and
 

2049
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,150
and all of this is happening faster and
faster yeah

2050
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:00,160
faster yeah
 

2051
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,870
faster yeah
it created increasingly complex

2052
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:02,880
it created increasingly complex
 

2053
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,390
it created increasingly complex
organisms

2054
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:04,400
organisms
 

2055
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,829
organisms
another key thing is actually not just

2056
00:37:06,829 --> 00:37:06,839
another key thing is actually not just
 

2057
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:12,790
another key thing is actually not just
brains but our thumb

2058
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:12,800

 

2059
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,750

because because there's a lot of animals

2060
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:15,760
because because there's a lot of animals
 

2061
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,190
because because there's a lot of animals
with brains even bigger than humans

2062
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:19,200
with brains even bigger than humans
 

2063
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,270
with brains even bigger than humans
elephants have a bigger brain

2064
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:21,280
elephants have a bigger brain
 

2065
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,990
elephants have a bigger brain
whales have a bigger brain

2066
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:24,000
whales have a bigger brain
 

2067
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,870
whales have a bigger brain
but they've not created technology

2068
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:26,880
but they've not created technology
 

2069
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,670
but they've not created technology
because they don't have a thumb

2070
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:29,680
because they don't have a thumb
 

2071
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,150
because they don't have a thumb
so that's one of the really key elements

2072
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:32,160
so that's one of the really key elements
 

2073
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,190
so that's one of the really key elements
in the evolution of humans this uh

2074
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:35,200
in the evolution of humans this uh
 

2075
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,990
in the evolution of humans this uh
physical manipulator device right that's

2076
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:38,000
physical manipulator device right that's
 

2077
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,670
physical manipulator device right that's
useful for puzzle solving in the

2078
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:39,680
useful for puzzle solving in the
 

2079
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,390
useful for puzzle solving in the
physical reality so i could think i

2080
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:42,400
physical reality so i could think i
 

2081
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,150
physical reality so i could think i
could look at a tree and go oh i can

2082
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:44,160
could look at a tree and go oh i can
 

2083
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,550
could look at a tree and go oh i can
actually strip that branch down and

2084
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:46,560
actually strip that branch down and
 

2085
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,589
actually strip that branch down and
eliminate the leaves and carve it tip on

2086
00:37:49,589 --> 00:37:49,599
eliminate the leaves and carve it tip on
 

2087
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:50,390
eliminate the leaves and carve it tip on
it and

2088
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:50,400
it and
 

2089
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,230
it and
great technology

2090
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:52,240
great technology
 

2091
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,950
great technology
uh and you can't do that if you don't

2092
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:54,960
uh and you can't do that if you don't
 

2093
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,550
uh and you can't do that if you don't
have a thumb

2094
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:56,560
have a thumb
 

2095
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,109
have a thumb
yeah um

2096
00:37:59,109 --> 00:37:59,119
yeah um
 

2097
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,790
yeah um
so

2098
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:00,800
so
 

2099
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,910
so
uh

2100
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:01,920
uh
 

2101
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,310
uh
thumbs and created technology

2102
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:04,320
thumbs and created technology
 

2103
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,390
thumbs and created technology
and technology also

2104
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:06,400
and technology also
 

2105
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,829
and technology also
had a memory

2106
00:38:07,829 --> 00:38:07,839
had a memory
 

2107
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:09,910
had a memory
and now those memories are competing

2108
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:09,920
and now those memories are competing
 

2109
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,790
and now those memories are competing
with

2110
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:10,800
with
 

2111
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,990
with
the

2112
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:12,000
the
 

2113
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,870
the
scale and scope of human beings

2114
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:14,880
scale and scope of human beings
 

2115
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,069
scale and scope of human beings
and ultimately we'll go beyond it

2116
00:38:18,069 --> 00:38:18,079
and ultimately we'll go beyond it
 

2117
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,950
and ultimately we'll go beyond it
and then we're going to merge

2118
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:20,960
and then we're going to merge
 

2119
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,349
and then we're going to merge
human technology with

2120
00:38:23,349 --> 00:38:23,359
human technology with
 

2121
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:24,710
human technology with
uh

2122
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:24,720
uh
 

2123
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,349
uh
with human intelligence

2124
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:27,359
with human intelligence
 

2125
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,910
with human intelligence
and understand how human

2126
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:29,920
and understand how human
 

2127
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,510
and understand how human
intelligence works which i think we

2128
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:31,520
intelligence works which i think we
 

2129
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,109
intelligence works which i think we
already do

2130
00:38:33,109 --> 00:38:33,119
already do
 

2131
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,109
already do
and we're putting that into

2132
00:38:35,109 --> 00:38:35,119
and we're putting that into
 

2133
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:36,150
and we're putting that into
uh

2134
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:36,160
uh
 

2135
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,270
uh
our human technology

2136
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:39,280
our human technology
 

2137
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,150
our human technology
so create the technology inspired by our

2138
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:42,160
so create the technology inspired by our
 

2139
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,510
so create the technology inspired by our
own intelligence and then that

2140
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:43,520
own intelligence and then that
 

2141
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,910
own intelligence and then that
technology supersedes us in terms of its

2142
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:45,920
technology supersedes us in terms of its
 

2143
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,109
technology supersedes us in terms of its
capabilities and we ride along or do do

2144
00:38:49,109 --> 00:38:49,119
capabilities and we ride along or do do
 

2145
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,030
capabilities and we ride along or do do
you ultimately see it as we ride along

2146
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:51,040
you ultimately see it as we ride along
 

2147
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,870
you ultimately see it as we ride along
but a lot of people don't see that they

2148
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:52,880
but a lot of people don't see that they
 

2149
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,829
but a lot of people don't see that they
say well

2150
00:38:53,829 --> 00:38:53,839
say well
 

2151
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:55,349
say well
okay you've got humans and you've got

2152
00:38:55,349 --> 00:38:55,359
okay you've got humans and you've got
 

2153
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:57,430
okay you've got humans and you've got
machines and there's no way we can

2154
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:57,440
machines and there's no way we can
 

2155
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,390
machines and there's no way we can
ultimately compete with humans and you

2156
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:00,400
ultimately compete with humans and you
 

2157
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,150
ultimately compete with humans and you
can already see that

2158
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:02,160
can already see that
 

2159
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,790
can already see that

go player in the world says he's not
 

2163
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:09,910
go player in the world says he's not
going to play go anymore yeah

2164
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:09,920
going to play go anymore yeah
 

2165
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,030
going to play go anymore yeah
because playing go for human that was

2166
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:13,040
because playing go for human that was
 

2167
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,790
because playing go for human that was
like the ultimate in intelligence

2168
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:14,800
like the ultimate in intelligence
 

2169
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,069
like the ultimate in intelligence
because no one else could do that

2170
00:39:18,069 --> 00:39:18,079
because no one else could do that
 

2171
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,870
because no one else could do that
but now a machine can actually go way

2172
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:20,880
but now a machine can actually go way
 

2173
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,230
but now a machine can actually go way
beyond him

2174
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:22,240
beyond him
 

2175
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,589
beyond him
and so he says well there's no point

2176
00:39:23,589 --> 00:39:23,599
and so he says well there's no point
 

2177
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,030
and so he says well there's no point
playing it anymore

2178
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:25,040
playing it anymore
 

2179
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,750
playing it anymore
that may be more true for games than it

2180
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:27,760
that may be more true for games than it
 

2181
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,990
that may be more true for games than it
is for life

2182
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:30,000
is for life
 

2183
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,349
is for life
i think there's a lot of benefit to

2184
00:39:31,349 --> 00:39:31,359
i think there's a lot of benefit to
 

2185
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:34,390
i think there's a lot of benefit to
working together with ai in regular life

2186
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:34,400
working together with ai in regular life
 

2187
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,349
working together with ai in regular life
so

2188
00:39:35,349 --> 00:39:35,359
so
 

2189
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,829
so
if you were to put a probability on it

2190
00:39:37,829 --> 00:39:37,839
if you were to put a probability on it
 

2191
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:41,109
if you were to put a probability on it
is it more likely that we merge with ai

2192
00:39:41,109 --> 00:39:41,119
is it more likely that we merge with ai
 

2193
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:43,510
is it more likely that we merge with ai
or ai replaces us

2194
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:43,520
or ai replaces us
 

2195
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,950
or ai replaces us
a lot of people

2196
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:44,960
a lot of people
 

2197
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,230
a lot of people
just think

2198
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:46,240
just think
 

2199
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,990
just think
computers come along they compete with

2200
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:48,000
computers come along they compete with
 

2201
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,910
computers come along they compete with
them we can't really compete and that's

2202
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:49,920
them we can't really compete and that's
 

2203
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,230
them we can't really compete and that's
the end of it

2204
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:52,240
the end of it
 

2205
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,829
the end of it
as opposed to

2206
00:39:53,829 --> 00:39:53,839
as opposed to
 

2207
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:54,950
as opposed to
them

2208
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:54,960
them
 

2209
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,030
them
increasing our abilities

2210
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:57,040
increasing our abilities
 

2211
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,870
increasing our abilities
and if you look at most

2212
00:39:58,870 --> 00:39:58,880
and if you look at most
 

2213
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:04,310
and if you look at most
technology it increases our abilities

2214
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:04,320

 

2215
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,829

i mean look at the history of work

2216
00:40:07,829 --> 00:40:07,839

 

2217
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:10,950

look at what people did 100 years ago

2218
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:10,960
look at what people did 100 years ago
 

2219
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,470
look at what people did 100 years ago
does any of that exist anymore people

2220
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:14,480
does any of that exist anymore people
 

2221
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,470
does any of that exist anymore people
i mean if you were to predict

2222
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:16,480
i mean if you were to predict
 

2223
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,270
i mean if you were to predict
that all of these jobs would go away

2224
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:19,280
that all of these jobs would go away
 

2225
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,109
that all of these jobs would go away
and would be done by machines people

2226
00:40:21,109 --> 00:40:21,119
and would be done by machines people
 

2227
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,790
and would be done by machines people
would say well that's going to be no

2228
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:22,800
would say well that's going to be no
 

2229
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,870
would say well that's going to be no
one's going to have jobs and

2230
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:24,880
one's going to have jobs and
 

2231
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,589
one's going to have jobs and
it's going to be massive unemployment

2232
00:40:27,589 --> 00:40:27,599
it's going to be massive unemployment
 

2233
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,349
it's going to be massive unemployment
um

2234
00:40:29,349 --> 00:40:29,359
um
 

2235
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:31,990
um
but i show in this book that's coming

2236
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:32,000
but i show in this book that's coming
 

2237
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,990
but i show in this book that's coming
out

2238
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:34,000
out
 

2239
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,109
out
the amount of

2240
00:40:35,109 --> 00:40:35,119
the amount of
 

2241
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:36,710
the amount of
people that are working

2242
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:36,720
people that are working
 

2243
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,670
people that are working
even as a percentage of the population

2244
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:39,680
even as a percentage of the population
 

2245
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,430
even as a percentage of the population
has gone way up

2246
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:41,440
has gone way up
 

2247
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,310
has gone way up
we're looking at the x-axis year from

2248
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:43,320
we're looking at the x-axis year from
 

2249
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,069
we're looking at the x-axis year from
1774 to 2024

2250
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:46,079
1774 to 2024
 

2251
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,310
1774 to 2024
and on the y-axis personal income per

2252
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:48,320
and on the y-axis personal income per
 

2253
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,430
and on the y-axis personal income per
capita

2254
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:49,440
capita
 

2255
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,829
capita
in constant dollars and it's growing

2256
00:40:51,829 --> 00:40:51,839
in constant dollars and it's growing
 

2257
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:54,310
in constant dollars and it's growing
super linearly i mean it's 20 21

2258
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:54,320
super linearly i mean it's 20 21
 

2259
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,829
super linearly i mean it's 20 21
constant dollars

2260
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:55,839
constant dollars
 

2261
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:57,910
constant dollars
and it's gone way up

2262
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:57,920
and it's gone way up
 

2263
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,630
and it's gone way up
that's not what you were to predict

2264
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:00,640
that's not what you were to predict
 

2265
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,069
that's not what you were to predict
given that we would predict that all

2266
00:41:02,069 --> 00:41:02,079
given that we would predict that all
 

2267
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:04,470
given that we would predict that all
these jobs would go away

2268
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:04,480
these jobs would go away
 

2269
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,550
these jobs would go away
yeah but the reason it's gone up is

2270
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:06,560
yeah but the reason it's gone up is
 

2271
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,470
yeah but the reason it's gone up is
because we've basically enhanced our own

2272
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:08,480
because we've basically enhanced our own
 

2273
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,270
because we've basically enhanced our own
capabilities by using these machines as

2274
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:11,280
capabilities by using these machines as
 

2275
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,150
capabilities by using these machines as
opposed to them just competing with us

2276
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:14,160
opposed to them just competing with us
 

2277
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,750
opposed to them just competing with us
that's a key way in which we're going to

2278
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:15,760
that's a key way in which we're going to
 

2279
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,990
that's a key way in which we're going to
be able to become far smarter than we

2280
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:18,000
be able to become far smarter than we
 

2281
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,430
be able to become far smarter than we
are now by

2282
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:19,440
are now by
 

2283
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,870
are now by
increasing

2284
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:20,880
increasing
 

2285
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,190
increasing
the number of different parameters we

2286
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:23,200
the number of different parameters we
 

2287
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,309
the number of different parameters we
can consider and making a decision

2288
00:41:26,309 --> 00:41:26,319
can consider and making a decision
 

2289
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,470

one of the themes outside of just
discussing the increasing exponential

2304
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:43,680
discussing the increasing exponential

growth of technology one of the themes
 

2307
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:46,230
growth of technology one of the themes
is

2308
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:46,240
is
 

2309
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,349
is
that

2310
00:41:47,349 --> 00:41:47,359
that
 

2311
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,349
that
things are getting better in all aspects

2312
00:41:49,349 --> 00:41:49,359
things are getting better in all aspects
 

2313
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:50,630
things are getting better in all aspects
of life

2314
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:50,640
of life
 

2315
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,870
of life
and you talk just about

2316
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:52,880
and you talk just about
 

2317
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,309
and you talk just about
just about this so one of the things

2318
00:41:54,309 --> 00:41:54,319
just about this so one of the things
 

2319
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:56,150
just about this so one of the things
you're saying is with jobs so let me

2320
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:56,160
you're saying is with jobs so let me
 

2321
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,309
you're saying is with jobs so let me
just ask about that there is a big

2322
00:41:58,309 --> 00:41:58,319
just ask about that there is a big
 

2323
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:00,950
just ask about that there is a big
concern that automation

2324
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:00,960
concern that automation
 

2325
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,630
concern that automation
especially

2326
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:02,640
especially
 

2327
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,190
especially
powerful ai will

2328
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:05,200
powerful ai will
 

2329
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,349
powerful ai will
get rid of jobs where people will lose

2330
00:42:07,349 --> 00:42:07,359
get rid of jobs where people will lose
 

2331
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:10,950
get rid of jobs where people will lose
jobs and as you were saying the sense is

2332
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:10,960
jobs and as you were saying the sense is
 

2333
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,390
jobs and as you were saying the sense is
throughout

2334
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:12,400
throughout
 

2335
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,470
throughout
history of the 20th century automation

2336
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:14,480
history of the 20th century automation
 

2337
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,470
history of the 20th century automation
did not do that ultimately

2338
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:16,480
did not do that ultimately
 

2339
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,109
did not do that ultimately
and so the question is will this time be

2340
00:42:19,109 --> 00:42:19,119
and so the question is will this time be
 

2341
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,470
and so the question is will this time be
different

2342
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:20,480
different
 

2343
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,790
different
right that is the question will this

2344
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:22,800
right that is the question will this
 

2345
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,309
right that is the question will this
time be different

2346
00:42:24,309 --> 00:42:24,319
time be different
 

2347
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:26,230
time be different
and it really has to do with how quickly

2348
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:26,240
and it really has to do with how quickly
 

2349
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,069
and it really has to do with how quickly
we can merge with this type of

2350
00:42:28,069 --> 00:42:28,079
we can merge with this type of
 

2351
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,550
we can merge with this type of
intelligence

2352
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:30,560
intelligence
 

2353
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,910
intelligence
whether

2354
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:31,920
whether
 

2355
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,190
whether
lambda or gpt-3 is out there and maybe

2356
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:35,200
lambda or gpt-3 is out there and maybe
 

2357
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,030
lambda or gpt-3 is out there and maybe
it's overcome some of its

2358
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:37,040
it's overcome some of its
 

2359
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,069
it's overcome some of its
you know key problems

2360
00:42:40,069 --> 00:42:40,079
you know key problems
 

2361
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:41,829
you know key problems
and we really have an enhanced human

2362
00:42:41,829 --> 00:42:41,839
and we really have an enhanced human
 

2363
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:43,430
and we really have an enhanced human
intelligence

2364
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:43,440
intelligence
 

2365
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,390
intelligence
that might be a negative scenario

2366
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:46,400
that might be a negative scenario
 

2367
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,430
that might be a negative scenario
um

2368
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:49,440

 

2369
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,349

but i mean that's

2370
00:42:51,349 --> 00:42:51,359
but i mean that's
 

2371
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:53,190
but i mean that's
that's why we create technologies to

2372
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:53,200
that's why we create technologies to
 

2373
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,150
that's why we create technologies to
enhance ourselves

2374
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:56,160
enhance ourselves
 

2375
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,630
enhance ourselves
and i believe we will be enhanced

2376
00:42:58,630 --> 00:42:58,640
and i believe we will be enhanced
 

2377
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,349
and i believe we will be enhanced
we're not just going to sit here with

2378
00:43:01,349 --> 00:43:01,359
we're not just going to sit here with
 

2379
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:02,870
we're not just going to sit here with
uh

2380
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:02,880
uh
 

2381
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,790
uh
300 million

2382
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:06,800

 

2383
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,270

modules in our neocortex we're going to

2384
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:09,280
modules in our neocortex we're going to
 

2385
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,589
modules in our neocortex we're going to
be able to go beyond that

2386
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:11,599
be able to go beyond that
 

2387
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:13,829
be able to go beyond that
um

2388
00:43:13,829 --> 00:43:13,839
um
 

2389
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:16,550
um
because that's useful but we can

2390
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:16,560
because that's useful but we can
 

2391
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,950
because that's useful but we can
multiply that by 10

2392
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:18,960
multiply that by 10
 

2393
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,270
multiply that by 10
a hundred thousand

2394
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:21,280
a hundred thousand
 

2395
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,790
a hundred thousand
a million

2396
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:22,800
a million
 

2397
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,109
a million
um

2398
00:43:25,109 --> 00:43:25,119
um
 

2399
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,349
um
and you might think well what's the

2400
00:43:27,349 --> 00:43:27,359
and you might think well what's the
 

2401
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:30,150
and you might think well what's the
point of doing that

2402
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:30,160
point of doing that
 

2403
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,510
point of doing that
it's like

2404
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:31,520
it's like
 

2405
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,750
it's like
asking somebody that's never heard music

2406
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:33,760
asking somebody that's never heard music
 

2407
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,190
asking somebody that's never heard music
well

2408
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:35,200
well
 

2409
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,030
well
what's the value of music i mean you

2410
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:37,040
what's the value of music i mean you
 

2411
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,430
what's the value of music i mean you
can't appreciate it until you've created

2412
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:39,440
can't appreciate it until you've created
 

2413
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,190
can't appreciate it until you've created
it

2414
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:41,200
it
 

2415
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,829
it
there's some worry that there'll be a

2416
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:43,839
there's some worry that there'll be a
 

2417
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:45,589
there's some worry that there'll be a
wealth disparity

2418
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:45,599
wealth disparity
 

2419
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:46,790
wealth disparity
you know

2420
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:46,800
you know
 

2421
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,109
you know
class or wealth disparity only the rich

2422
00:43:49,109 --> 00:43:49,119
class or wealth disparity only the rich
 

2423
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,150
class or wealth disparity only the rich
people

2424
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:50,160
people
 

2425
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,430
people
will be

2426
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:51,440
will be
 

2427
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,510
will be
basically the rich people will first

2428
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:53,520
basically the rich people will first
 

2429
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,510
basically the rich people will first
have access to this kind of thing and

2430
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:55,520
have access to this kind of thing and
 

2431
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,069
have access to this kind of thing and
then because of this kind of thing

2432
00:43:58,069 --> 00:43:58,079
then because of this kind of thing
 

2433
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,670
then because of this kind of thing
because the ability to merge will get

2434
00:43:59,670 --> 00:43:59,680
because the ability to merge will get
 

2435
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,630
because the ability to merge will get
richer

2436
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:00,640
richer
 

2437
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,270
richer
exponentially faster and i say that's

2438
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:03,280
exponentially faster and i say that's
 

2439
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,069
exponentially faster and i say that's
just like cell phones

2440
00:44:06,069 --> 00:44:06,079
just like cell phones
 

2441
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:07,589
just like cell phones
i mean there's like 4 billion cell

2442
00:44:07,589 --> 00:44:07,599
i mean there's like 4 billion cell
 

2443
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:10,230
i mean there's like 4 billion cell
phones in the world today

2444
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:10,240
phones in the world today
 

2445
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,190
phones in the world today
in fact when cell phones first came out

2446
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:13,200
in fact when cell phones first came out
 

2447
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,870
in fact when cell phones first came out
you had to be fairly wealthy they

2448
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:14,880
you had to be fairly wealthy they
 

2449
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,349
you had to be fairly wealthy they
weren't very inexpensive

2450
00:44:17,349 --> 00:44:17,359
weren't very inexpensive
 

2451
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:19,270
weren't very inexpensive
she had to have some wealth in order to

2452
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:19,280
she had to have some wealth in order to
 

2453
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,030
she had to have some wealth in order to
afford them yeah there were these big

2454
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:21,040
afford them yeah there were these big
 

2455
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,430
afford them yeah there were these big
sexy headphones and they didn't work

2456
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:23,440
sexy headphones and they didn't work
 

2457
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,390
sexy headphones and they didn't work
very well they did almost nothing

2458
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:26,400
very well they did almost nothing
 

2459
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,430
very well they did almost nothing
so

2460
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:27,440
so
 

2461
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,430
so
you can only afford these things if

2462
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:29,440
you can only afford these things if
 

2463
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,030
you can only afford these things if
you're wealthy

2464
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:31,040
you're wealthy
 

2465
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,109
you're wealthy
at a point where they really don't work

2466
00:44:33,109 --> 00:44:33,119
at a point where they really don't work
 

2467
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:34,870
at a point where they really don't work
very well

2468
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:34,880
very well
 

2469
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,470
very well
so um so achieving scale is and uh

2470
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:38,480
so um so achieving scale is and uh
 

2471
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,470
so um so achieving scale is and uh
making it inexpensive as part of making

2472
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:40,480
making it inexpensive as part of making
 

2473
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,069
making it inexpensive as part of making
the thing work well

2474
00:44:42,069 --> 00:44:42,079
the thing work well
 

2475
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,430
the thing work well
exactly

2476
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:43,440
exactly
 

2477
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,270
exactly
so these are not totally cheap but

2478
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:45,280
so these are not totally cheap but
 

2479
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,230
so these are not totally cheap but
they're pretty pretty cheap yeah i mean

2480
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:48,240
they're pretty pretty cheap yeah i mean
 

2481
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,790
they're pretty pretty cheap yeah i mean
you can get them for a few hundred

2482
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:50,800
you can get them for a few hundred
 

2483
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:51,990
you can get them for a few hundred
dollars

2484
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:52,000
dollars
 

2485
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,910
dollars
especially given the kind of things it

2486
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:53,920
especially given the kind of things it
 

2487
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,069
especially given the kind of things it
provides for you there's a lot of people

2488
00:44:56,069 --> 00:44:56,079
provides for you there's a lot of people
 

2489
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:58,230
provides for you there's a lot of people
in the third world that

2490
00:44:58,230 --> 00:44:58,240
in the third world that
 

2491
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,510
in the third world that
have very little but they have a

2492
00:44:59,510 --> 00:44:59,520
have very little but they have a
 

2493
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,750
have very little but they have a
smartphone yeah absolutely

2494
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:01,760
smartphone yeah absolutely
 

2495
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,910
smartphone yeah absolutely
and the same will be true with ai i mean

2496
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:03,920
and the same will be true with ai i mean
 

2497
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,990
and the same will be true with ai i mean
i see homeless people have their own

2498
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:06,000
i see homeless people have their own
 

2499
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,510
i see homeless people have their own
cell phones and

2500
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:07,520
cell phones and
 

2501
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,309
cell phones and
yeah so your sense is any kind of

2502
00:45:10,309 --> 00:45:10,319
yeah so your sense is any kind of
 

2503
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:11,990
yeah so your sense is any kind of
advanced technology

2504
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:12,000
advanced technology
 

2505
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,550
advanced technology
will take the same trajectory

2506
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:14,560
will take the same trajectory
 

2507
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,230
will take the same trajectory
right it ultimately becomes cheap and

2508
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:16,240
right it ultimately becomes cheap and
 

2509
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,950
right it ultimately becomes cheap and
will be affordable

2510
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:18,960
will be affordable
 

2511
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,950
will be affordable
i probably would not be the first person

2512
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:20,960
i probably would not be the first person
 

2513
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,150
i probably would not be the first person
to

2514
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:22,160
to
 

2515
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,990
to
put

2516
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:24,000
put
 

2517
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,589
put
something in my brain to connect to

2518
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:25,599
something in my brain to connect to
 

2519
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:27,990
something in my brain to connect to
computers

2520
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:28,000
computers
 

2521
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,069
computers
because i think it will have limitations

2522
00:45:30,069 --> 00:45:30,079
because i think it will have limitations
 

2523
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:31,670
because i think it will have limitations
but once it's

2524
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:31,680
but once it's
 

2525
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,910
but once it's
really perfected

2526
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:33,920
really perfected
 

2527
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,430
really perfected
and at that point it'll be pretty

2528
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:35,440
and at that point it'll be pretty
 

2529
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,270
and at that point it'll be pretty
inexpensive i think it'll be pretty

2530
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:37,280
inexpensive i think it'll be pretty
 

2531
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,510
inexpensive i think it'll be pretty
affordable

2532
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:39,520
affordable
 

2533
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,309
affordable
so

2534
00:45:40,309 --> 00:45:40,319
so
 

2535
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:42,630
so
in which other ways as you outline your

2536
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:42,640
in which other ways as you outline your
 

2537
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,710
in which other ways as you outline your
book is life getting better because i

2538
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:44,720
book is life getting better because i
 

2539
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,030
book is life getting better because i
think well i have i mean i have 50

2540
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:47,040
think well i have i mean i have 50
 

2541
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,309
think well i have i mean i have 50
charts in there yeah where everything is

2542
00:45:50,309 --> 00:45:50,319
charts in there yeah where everything is
 

2543
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:51,589
charts in there yeah where everything is
getting better

2544
00:45:51,589 --> 00:45:51,599
getting better
 

2545
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:54,470
getting better
i think there's a kind of cynicism about

2546
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:54,480
i think there's a kind of cynicism about
 

2547
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,790
i think there's a kind of cynicism about
um like if even if we look at extreme

2548
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:56,800
um like if even if we look at extreme
 

2549
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,109
um like if even if we look at extreme
poverty for example for example this is

2550
00:45:59,109 --> 00:45:59,119
poverty for example for example this is
 

2551
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:00,710
poverty for example for example this is
actually a poll

2552
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:00,720
actually a poll
 

2553
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,109
actually a poll
taken on extreme poverty

2554
00:46:03,109 --> 00:46:03,119
taken on extreme poverty
 

2555
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:05,430
taken on extreme poverty
and then people were asked

2556
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:05,440
and then people were asked
 

2557
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,150
and then people were asked
has poverty gotten better or worse

2558
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:08,160
has poverty gotten better or worse
 

2559
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,630
has poverty gotten better or worse
and the options are increased by 50

2560
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:10,640
and the options are increased by 50
 

2561
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,950
and the options are increased by 50
percent increase by 25 percent remain

2562
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:12,960
percent increase by 25 percent remain
 

2563
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,550
percent increase by 25 percent remain
the same decreased by 25 degrees by 50

2564
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:16,560
the same decreased by 25 degrees by 50
 

2565
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,990
the same decreased by 25 degrees by 50
if you're watching this or listening to

2566
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:18,000
if you're watching this or listening to
 

2567
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,430
if you're watching this or listening to
this try to to try to vote for yourself

2568
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:21,440
this try to to try to vote for yourself
 

2569
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,990
this try to to try to vote for yourself
70 thought it had gotten worse

2570
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:24,000
70 thought it had gotten worse
 

2571
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,950
70 thought it had gotten worse
and that's the general impression

2572
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:26,960
and that's the general impression
 

2573
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,630
and that's the general impression
88

2574
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:28,640
88
 

2575
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,710
88
thought it had gotten worse or remained

2576
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:30,720
thought it had gotten worse or remained
 

2577
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,309
thought it had gotten worse or remained
the same

2578
00:46:32,309 --> 00:46:32,319
the same
 

2579
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:34,710
the same
only one percent thought it decreased by

2580
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:34,720
only one percent thought it decreased by
 

2581
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:35,589
only one percent thought it decreased by
50

2582
00:46:35,589 --> 00:46:35,599
50
 

2583
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:37,349
50
and that is the answer

2584
00:46:37,349 --> 00:46:37,359
and that is the answer
 

2585
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:39,589
and that is the answer
it actually decreased by 50 percent so

2586
00:46:39,589 --> 00:46:39,599
it actually decreased by 50 percent so
 

2587
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:42,309
it actually decreased by 50 percent so
only one percent of people got the right

2588
00:46:42,309 --> 00:46:42,319
only one percent of people got the right
 

2589
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:45,109
only one percent of people got the right
optimistic estimate of how poverty is

2590
00:46:45,109 --> 00:46:45,119
optimistic estimate of how poverty is
 

2591
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:47,510
optimistic estimate of how poverty is
right and and this is the reality and

2592
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:47,520
right and and this is the reality and
 

2593
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,589
right and and this is the reality and
it's true of almost everything

2594
00:46:49,589 --> 00:46:49,599
it's true of almost everything
 

2595
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,030
it's true of almost everything
you look at

2596
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:51,040
you look at
 

2597
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,349
you look at
you don't want to go back 100 years or

2598
00:46:53,349 --> 00:46:53,359
you don't want to go back 100 years or
 

2599
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:54,630
you don't want to go back 100 years or
50 years

2600
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:54,640
50 years
 

2601
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,270
50 years
things were quite miserable then but we

2602
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:57,280
things were quite miserable then but we
 

2603
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,670
things were quite miserable then but we
tend not to

00:46:59,670 --> 00:46:59,680
tend not to
 

2605
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,230
tend not to
remember that so literacy rate

2606
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:02,240
remember that so literacy rate

years of education have gone way up

2618
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:15,520
years of education have gone way up
 

2619
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,470
years of education have gone way up
life expectancy is also increasing

2620
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:18,480
life expectancy is also increasing
 

2621
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,950
life expectancy is also increasing
life expectancy was

00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:28,480
going to continue to go up particularly
 

2629
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,950
going to continue to go up particularly
as we get into more advanced stages of

as we get into more advanced stages of

00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,190
as we get into more advanced stages of
simulated biology

2632

for life expectancy these trends are the

2634
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:35,200
for life expectancy these trends are the
 

2635
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,069
for life expectancy these trends are the
same for at birth age 1 age 5 age 10 so

2636
00:47:38,069 --> 00:47:38,079
same for at birth age 1 age 5 age 10 so
 

2637
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:40,470
same for at birth age 1 age 5 age 10 so
it's not just the infant mortality and i

it's not just the infant mortality and i

it's not just the infant mortality and i
have 50 more graphs in the book about

uh even spread of democracy
 

2645
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,910
uh even spread of democracy
we're trying to

2646
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:49,920
we're trying to
 

2647
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,829
we're trying to
bring up some sort of controversial

2648
00:47:51,829 --> 00:47:51,839
bring up some sort of controversial
 

2649
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:54,950
bring up some sort of controversial
issues it still has gone way up

2650
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:54,960
issues it still has gone way up
 

2651
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,190
issues it still has gone way up
well that one is uh it's gone way up but

2652
00:47:57,190 --> 00:47:57,200
well that one is uh it's gone way up but
 

2653
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,430
well that one is uh it's gone way up but
that one is a bumpy road right

2654
00:47:59,430 --> 00:47:59,440
that one is a bumpy road right
 

2655
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,670
that one is a bumpy road right
exactly and some somebody might

2656
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:01,680
exactly and some somebody might
 

2657
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,150
exactly and some somebody might
represent democracy and

2658
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:04,160
represent democracy and
 

2659
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,630
represent democracy and
and go backwards but

2660
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:06,640
and go backwards but
 

2661
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,630
and go backwards but
we basically had no democracies before

2662
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:08,640
we basically had no democracies before
 

2663
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,510
we basically had no democracies before
the

2664
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:09,520
the
 

2665
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,589
the
creation of the united states which was

2666
00:48:11,589 --> 00:48:11,599
creation of the united states which was
 

2667
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:13,589
creation of the united states which was
a little over two centuries ago

2668
00:48:13,589 --> 00:48:13,599
a little over two centuries ago
 

2669
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,109
a little over two centuries ago
which in the scale of human history

2670
00:48:15,109 --> 00:48:15,119
which in the scale of human history
 

2671
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:17,270
which in the scale of human history
isn't that long

2672
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:17,280
isn't that long
 

2673
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,870
isn't that long
do you think superintelligence systems

2674
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:18,880
do you think superintelligence systems
 

2675
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,270
do you think superintelligence systems
will help

2676
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:21,280
will help
 

2677
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,510
will help
with democracy

2678
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:23,520
with democracy
 

2679
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,230
with democracy
so what is democracy democracy is giving

2680
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:26,240
so what is democracy democracy is giving
 

2681
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,510
so what is democracy democracy is giving
a voice

2682
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:27,520
a voice
 

2683
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,549
a voice
to

2684
00:48:28,549 --> 00:48:28,559
to
 

2685
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:30,549
to
the populace

2686
00:48:30,549 --> 00:48:30,559
the populace
 

2687
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:31,589
the populace
and

2688
00:48:31,589 --> 00:48:31,599
and
 

2689
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:33,510
and
having their ideas having their beliefs

2690
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:33,520
having their ideas having their beliefs
 

2691
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,589
having their ideas having their beliefs
having

2692
00:48:35,589 --> 00:48:35,599
having
 

2693
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:37,990
having
their views represented

2694
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:38,000
their views represented
 

2695
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,109
their views represented
well i hope so

2696
00:48:41,109 --> 00:48:41,119

 

2697
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:43,990

i mean we've seen social networks

2698
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:44,000
i mean we've seen social networks
 

2699
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,349
i mean we've seen social networks
can spread

2700
00:48:45,349 --> 00:48:45,359
can spread
 

2701
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:49,349
can spread
uh conspiracy theories uh which have

2702
00:48:49,349 --> 00:48:49,359
uh conspiracy theories uh which have
 

2703
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,190
uh conspiracy theories uh which have
been quite negative

2704
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:51,200
been quite negative
 

2705
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,109
been quite negative
being for example

2706
00:48:53,109 --> 00:48:53,119
being for example
 

2707
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:54,230
being for example
being against

2708
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:54,240
being against
 

2709
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,710
being against
any kind of stuff that would help your

2710
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:56,720
any kind of stuff that would help your
 

2711
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,150
any kind of stuff that would help your
health

2712
00:48:58,150 --> 00:48:58,160
health
 

2713
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,549
health
so those kinds of ideas

2714
00:49:00,549 --> 00:49:00,559
so those kinds of ideas
 

2715
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:02,950
so those kinds of ideas
have

2716
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:02,960
have
 

2717
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,270
have
uh on social media what you notice is

2718
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:05,280
uh on social media what you notice is
 

2719
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,829
uh on social media what you notice is
they increase engagement so dramatic

2720
00:49:07,829 --> 00:49:07,839
they increase engagement so dramatic
 

2721
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,309
they increase engagement so dramatic
division increases engagement

2722
00:49:10,309 --> 00:49:10,319
division increases engagement
 

2723
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:13,030
division increases engagement
do you worry about ai systems that will

2724
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:13,040
do you worry about ai systems that will
 

2725
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,870
do you worry about ai systems that will
learn to maximize that division

2726
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:16,880
learn to maximize that division
 

2727
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,510
learn to maximize that division
i mean i do have some concerns about

2728
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:19,520
i mean i do have some concerns about
 

2729
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,910
i mean i do have some concerns about
this

2730
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:21,920

 

2731
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,790

and i have a chapter in the book about

2732
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:24,800
and i have a chapter in the book about
 

2733
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,470
and i have a chapter in the book about
the perils of

2734
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:26,480
the perils of
 

2735
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,470
the perils of
advanced a.i

2736
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:28,480
advanced a.i
 

2737
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,950
advanced a.i
um

2738
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:30,960
um
 

2739
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,710
um
spreading misinformation on social

2740
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:32,720
spreading misinformation on social
 

2741
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,190
spreading misinformation on social
networks is one of them but uh there are

2742
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:35,200
networks is one of them but uh there are
 

2743
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,630
networks is one of them but uh there are
many others

2744
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:36,640
many others
 

2745
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,390
many others
what's the one that worries you the most

2746
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:40,400

 

2747
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,150

that we should think about to try to

2748
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:42,160
that we should think about to try to
 

2749
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:47,030
that we should think about to try to
avoid

2750
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:47,040

 

2751
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,549

well it's hard to choose

2752
00:49:50,549 --> 00:49:50,559
well it's hard to choose
 

2753
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:53,589
well it's hard to choose
we do have the nuclear power

2754
00:49:53,589 --> 00:49:53,599
we do have the nuclear power
 

2755
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:54,630
we do have the nuclear power
that

2756
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:54,640
that
 

2757
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:58,069
that
evolved when i was a child i remember in

2758
00:49:58,069 --> 00:49:58,079
evolved when i was a child i remember in
 

2759
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:00,470
evolved when i was a child i remember in
we would actually do these

2760
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:00,480
we would actually do these
 

2761
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,829
we would actually do these
drills against a nuclear war we'd get

2762
00:50:03,829 --> 00:50:03,839
drills against a nuclear war we'd get
 

2763
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:05,829
drills against a nuclear war we'd get
under our desks and put our hands behind

2764
00:50:05,829 --> 00:50:05,839
under our desks and put our hands behind
 

2765
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:07,430
under our desks and put our hands behind
our heads

2766
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:07,440
our heads
 

2767
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,950
our heads
to protect us from a nuclear war

2768
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:10,960
to protect us from a nuclear war
 

2769
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,910
to protect us from a nuclear war
seems to work we're still around so

2770
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:13,920
seems to work we're still around so
 

2771
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,349
seems to work we're still around so
um

2772
00:50:15,349 --> 00:50:15,359
um
 

2773
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:16,870
um
you're protected

2774
00:50:16,870 --> 00:50:16,880
you're protected
 

2775
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:17,670
you're protected
but

2776
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:17,680
but
 

2777
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,910
but
that's still a concern

2778
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:19,920
that's still a concern
 

2779
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,630
that's still a concern
and there are key dangerous situations

2780
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:22,640
and there are key dangerous situations
 

2781
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:23,670
and there are key dangerous situations
that can

2782
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:23,680
that can
 

2783
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,790
that can
take place

2784
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:24,800
take place
 

2785
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,950
take place
in biology

2786
00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:26,960
in biology
 

2787
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,910
in biology
someone could create a

2788
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:29,920
someone could create a
 

2789
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,349
someone could create a
virus

2790
00:50:31,349 --> 00:50:31,359
virus
 

2791
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:32,230
virus
that's

2792
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:32,240
that's
 

2793
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,109
that's
very

2794
00:50:33,109 --> 00:50:33,119
very
 

2795
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:38,230
very
i mean we have viruses that are

2796
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:38,240

 

2797
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,390

hard to spread

2798
00:50:40,390 --> 00:50:40,400
hard to spread
 

2799
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,630
hard to spread
and they can be very dangerous

2800
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:42,640
and they can be very dangerous
 

2801
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,190
and they can be very dangerous
and we have viruses that are easy to

2802
00:50:45,190 --> 00:50:45,200
and we have viruses that are easy to
 

2803
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,390
and we have viruses that are easy to
spread but they're not so dangerous

2804
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:48,400
spread but they're not so dangerous
 

2805
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,230
spread but they're not so dangerous
um

2806
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:50,240
um
 

2807
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,670
um
somebody could create something that

2808
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:51,680
somebody could create something that
 

2809
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,069
somebody could create something that
would be very easy to spread and very

2810
00:50:54,069 --> 00:50:54,079
would be very easy to spread and very
 

2811
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,349
would be very easy to spread and very
dangerous

2812
00:50:55,349 --> 00:50:55,359
dangerous
 

2813
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:58,230
dangerous
and be very hard to stop

2814
00:50:58,230 --> 00:50:58,240
and be very hard to stop
 

2815
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,870
and be very hard to stop
uh it could be

2816
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:00,880
uh it could be
 

2817
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,230
uh it could be
something that would spread without

2818
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:02,240
something that would spread without
 

2819
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,069
something that would spread without
people noticing because people could get

2820
00:51:04,069 --> 00:51:04,079
people noticing because people could get
 

2821
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:06,549
people noticing because people could get
it they'd have no symptoms

2822
00:51:06,549 --> 00:51:06,559
it they'd have no symptoms
 

2823
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:08,870
it they'd have no symptoms
and then everybody would get it and then

2824
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:08,880
and then everybody would get it and then
 

2825
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,670
and then everybody would get it and then
symptoms would occur maybe a month later

2826
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:11,680
symptoms would occur maybe a month later
 

2827
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,349
symptoms would occur maybe a month later
so i mean

2828
00:51:13,349 --> 00:51:13,359
so i mean
 

2829
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:14,390
so i mean
and that

2830
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:14,400
and that
 

2831
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,630
and that
and that actually doesn't occur normally

2832
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:18,640
and that actually doesn't occur normally
 

2833
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,470
and that actually doesn't occur normally
because if we were to to

2834
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:22,480
because if we were to to
 

2835
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,190
because if we were to to
uh have a problem with that we wouldn't

2836
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:25,200
uh have a problem with that we wouldn't
 

2837
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,710
uh have a problem with that we wouldn't
exist

2838
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:26,720
exist
 

2839
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:29,030
exist
so the fact that humans exist means that

2840
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:29,040
so the fact that humans exist means that
 

2841
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,549
so the fact that humans exist means that
we don't have

2842
00:51:30,549 --> 00:51:30,559
we don't have
 

2843
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:32,230
we don't have
viruses that can

2844
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:32,240
viruses that can
 

2845
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,870
viruses that can
spread easily and kill us

2846
00:51:34,870 --> 00:51:34,880
spread easily and kill us
 

2847
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,270
spread easily and kill us
because otherwise we wouldn't exist

2848
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:37,280
because otherwise we wouldn't exist
 

2849
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,109
because otherwise we wouldn't exist
yeah viruses don't want to do that they

2850
00:51:39,109 --> 00:51:39,119
yeah viruses don't want to do that they
 

2851
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:41,670
yeah viruses don't want to do that they
want they want to spread and keep the

2852
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:41,680
want they want to spread and keep the
 

2853
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,630
want they want to spread and keep the
host alive yeah somewhat so you can

2854
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:44,640
host alive yeah somewhat so you can
 

2855
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,829
host alive yeah somewhat so you can
describe various dangers with biology

2856
00:51:47,829 --> 00:51:47,839
describe various dangers with biology
 

2857
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:50,790
describe various dangers with biology
uh also nanotechnology

2858
00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:50,800
uh also nanotechnology
 

2859
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,270
uh also nanotechnology
uh which we actually haven't experienced

2860
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:53,280
uh which we actually haven't experienced
 

2861
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,870
uh which we actually haven't experienced
yet but there are people that creating

2862
00:51:54,870 --> 00:51:54,880
yet but there are people that creating
 

2863
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,870
yet but there are people that creating
nanotechnology and i describe that in

2864
00:51:56,870 --> 00:51:56,880
nanotechnology and i describe that in
 

2865
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:57,750
nanotechnology and i describe that in
the book

2866
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:57,760
the book
 

2867
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,670
the book
now you're excited by the possibilities

2868
00:51:59,670 --> 00:51:59,680
now you're excited by the possibilities
 

2869
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,309
now you're excited by the possibilities
of nanotechnology of nanobots

2870
00:52:02,309 --> 00:52:02,319
of nanotechnology of nanobots
 

2871
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:04,390
of nanotechnology of nanobots
of being able to do things inside our

2872
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:04,400
of being able to do things inside our
 

2873
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,309
of being able to do things inside our
body inside our mind that's going to

2874
00:52:06,309 --> 00:52:06,319
body inside our mind that's going to
 

2875
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:07,349
body inside our mind that's going to
help

2876
00:52:07,349 --> 00:52:07,359
help
 

2877
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:09,109
help
what's exciting what's terrifying about

2878
00:52:09,109 --> 00:52:09,119
what's exciting what's terrifying about
 

2879
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:10,710
what's exciting what's terrifying about
nanobots

2880
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:10,720
nanobots
 

2881
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,030
nanobots
what's exciting is that that's a way to

2882
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:13,040
what's exciting is that that's a way to
 

2883
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,829
what's exciting is that that's a way to
communicate with our neocortex

2884
00:52:15,829 --> 00:52:15,839
communicate with our neocortex
 

2885
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:17,030
communicate with our neocortex
because it's

2886
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:17,040
because it's
 

2887
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,030
because it's
each neocortex is pretty small and you

2888
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:19,040
each neocortex is pretty small and you
 

2889
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,710
each neocortex is pretty small and you
need a small

2890
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:20,720
need a small
 

2891
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,150
need a small
entity that can actually get in there

2892
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:22,160
entity that can actually get in there
 

2893
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:25,349
entity that can actually get in there
and establish a communication channel

2894
00:52:25,349 --> 00:52:25,359
and establish a communication channel
 

2895
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:26,309
and establish a communication channel
and

2896
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:26,319
and
 

2897
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:28,230
and
that's going to really be necessary to

2898
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:28,240
that's going to really be necessary to
 

2899
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,230
that's going to really be necessary to
connect our brains

2900
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:30,240
connect our brains
 

2901
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:31,190
connect our brains
to

2902
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:31,200
to
 

2903
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,390
to
ai

2904
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:32,400
ai
 

2905
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,710
ai
within ourselves

2906
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:34,720
within ourselves
 

2907
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,790
within ourselves
because otherwise it would be hard for

2908
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:36,800
because otherwise it would be hard for
 

2909
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,549
because otherwise it would be hard for
us to compete with it

2910
00:52:38,549 --> 00:52:38,559
us to compete with it
 

2911
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:41,030
us to compete with it
in a high bandwidth way yeah

2912
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:41,040
in a high bandwidth way yeah
 

2913
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,349
in a high bandwidth way yeah
yeah and that's key actually because a

2914
00:52:43,349 --> 00:52:43,359
yeah and that's key actually because a
 

2915
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:44,710
yeah and that's key actually because a
lot of the

2916
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:44,720
lot of the
 

2917
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:45,670
lot of the
things

2918
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:45,680
things
 

2919
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,150
things
like neural ink are really not high band

2920
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:48,160
like neural ink are really not high band
 

2921
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,750
like neural ink are really not high band
within

2922
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:49,760
within
 

2923
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,750
within
so nanobots is the way you achieve high

2924
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:51,760
so nanobots is the way you achieve high
 

2925
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,589
so nanobots is the way you achieve high
bandwidth how much intelligence would

2926
00:52:53,589 --> 00:52:53,599
bandwidth how much intelligence would
 

2927
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:55,750
bandwidth how much intelligence would
those nanobots have

2928
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:55,760
those nanobots have
 

2929
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,150
those nanobots have
yeah they don't need a lot

2930
00:52:58,150 --> 00:52:58,160
yeah they don't need a lot
 

2931
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,670
yeah they don't need a lot
just enough to

2932
00:52:59,670 --> 00:52:59,680
just enough to
 

2933
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,750
just enough to
basically establish a communication

2934
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:01,760
basically establish a communication
 

2935
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:05,109
basically establish a communication
channel to one nanobot so it's primarily

2936
00:53:05,109 --> 00:53:05,119
channel to one nanobot so it's primarily
 

2937
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:07,670
channel to one nanobot so it's primarily
about communication yeah between

2938
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:07,680
about communication yeah between
 

2939
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,710
about communication yeah between
external computing devices and

2940
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:10,720
external computing devices and
 

2941
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,950
external computing devices and
our biological

2942
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:12,960
our biological
 

2943
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,950
our biological
thinking machine

2944
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:14,960
thinking machine
 

2945
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,190
thinking machine
what worries you about nanobots is it

2946
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:17,200
what worries you about nanobots is it
 

2947
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,670
what worries you about nanobots is it
similar to with the viruses

2948
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:19,680
similar to with the viruses
 

2949
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,190
similar to with the viruses
well i mean this is the great goo

2950
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:21,200
well i mean this is the great goo
 

2951
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,790
well i mean this is the great goo
channel challenge yes um

2952
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:24,800
channel challenge yes um
 

2953
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,230
channel challenge yes um
if you had

2954
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:26,240
if you had
 

2955
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,950
if you had
a nanobot

2956
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:28,960
a nanobot
 

2957
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,150
a nanobot
that

2958
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:32,160

 

2959
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:35,109

wanted to create any any kind of entity

2960
00:53:35,109 --> 00:53:35,119
wanted to create any any kind of entity
 

2961
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:37,430
wanted to create any any kind of entity
and repeat itself

2962
00:53:37,430 --> 00:53:37,440
and repeat itself
 

2963
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,750
and repeat itself
and was able to operate in a natural

2964
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:39,760
and was able to operate in a natural
 

2965
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,270
and was able to operate in a natural
environment

2966
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:41,280
environment
 

2967
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,470
environment
it could turn everything into that

2968
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:44,480
it could turn everything into that
 

2969
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:49,430
it could turn everything into that
entity and basically destroy all uh

2970
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:49,440

 

2971
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,829

biological life

2972
00:53:51,829 --> 00:53:51,839
biological life
 

2973
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:53,109
biological life
so you mentioned

2974
00:53:53,109 --> 00:53:53,119
so you mentioned
 

2975
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:57,349
so you mentioned
nuclear weapons yeah

2976
00:53:57,349 --> 00:53:57,359
nuclear weapons yeah
 

2977
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:00,309
nuclear weapons yeah
i'd love to hear your opinion about the

2978
00:54:00,309 --> 00:54:00,319
i'd love to hear your opinion about the
 

2979
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:03,190
i'd love to hear your opinion about the
21st century and whether you think we

2980
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:03,200
21st century and whether you think we
 

2981
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,190
21st century and whether you think we
might destroy ourselves

2982
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:05,200
might destroy ourselves
 

2983
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,430
might destroy ourselves
and maybe your opinion

2984
00:54:07,430 --> 00:54:07,440
and maybe your opinion
 

2985
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,670
and maybe your opinion
if it has changed by looking at what's

2986
00:54:09,670 --> 00:54:09,680
if it has changed by looking at what's
 

2987
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,670
if it has changed by looking at what's
going on in ukraine

2988
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:11,680
going on in ukraine
 

2989
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:15,430
going on in ukraine
that we could have a hot war

2990
00:54:15,430 --> 00:54:15,440
that we could have a hot war
 

2991
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,790
that we could have a hot war
with nuclear powers involved

2992
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:18,800
with nuclear powers involved
 

2993
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,190
with nuclear powers involved
and the tensions building

2994
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:21,200
and the tensions building
 

2995
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,829
and the tensions building
and the seeming

2996
00:54:22,829 --> 00:54:22,839
and the seeming
 

2997
00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:25,430
and the seeming
forgetting of how terrifying and

2998
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:25,440
forgetting of how terrifying and
 

2999
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:29,270
forgetting of how terrifying and
destructive nuclear weapons are

3000
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:29,280

 

3001
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,109

do you think

3002
00:54:31,109 --> 00:54:31,119
do you think
 

3003
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:33,030
do you think
humans might destroy ourselves in the

3004
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:33,040
humans might destroy ourselves in the
 

3005
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,990
humans might destroy ourselves in the
21st century and if we do how

3006
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:36,000
21st century and if we do how
 

3007
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,390
21st century and if we do how
and how do we avoid it

3008
00:54:38,390 --> 00:54:38,400
and how do we avoid it
 

3009
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,950
and how do we avoid it
i don't think that's going to happen

3010
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:40,960
i don't think that's going to happen
 

3011
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,549
i don't think that's going to happen
despite

3012
00:54:42,549 --> 00:54:42,559
despite
 

3013
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:45,109
despite
the terrors of that war

3014
00:54:45,109 --> 00:54:45,119
the terrors of that war
 

3015
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:47,190
the terrors of that war
it is a possibility

3016
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:47,200
it is a possibility
 

3017
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,230
it is a possibility
but i mean i i don't

3018
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:50,240
but i mean i i don't
 

3019
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,549
but i mean i i don't
it's unlikely in your mind

3020
00:54:52,549 --> 00:54:52,559
it's unlikely in your mind
 

3021
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:55,190
it's unlikely in your mind
yeah even with the tensions we've had

3022
00:54:55,190 --> 00:54:55,200
yeah even with the tensions we've had
 

3023
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,109
yeah even with the tensions we've had
with this one

3024
00:54:57,109 --> 00:54:57,119
with this one
 

3025
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:59,030
with this one
nuclear power plant that's been taken

3026
00:54:59,030 --> 00:54:59,040
nuclear power plant that's been taken
 

3027
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,390
nuclear power plant that's been taken
over

3028
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:00,400
over
 

3029
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,150
over
um

3030
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:02,160
um
 

3031
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:05,430
um
it's very tense

3032
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:05,440

 

3033
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,430

but i don't actually see a lot of people

3034
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:07,440
but i don't actually see a lot of people
 

3035
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,069
but i don't actually see a lot of people
worrying that that's going to happen

3036
00:55:10,069 --> 00:55:10,079
worrying that that's going to happen
 

3037
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:12,630
worrying that that's going to happen
i think we'll avoid that we had two

3038
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:12,640
i think we'll avoid that we had two
 

3039
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,829
i think we'll avoid that we had two
nuclear bombs go off in 45

3040
00:55:15,829 --> 00:55:15,839
nuclear bombs go off in 45
 

3041
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:18,589
nuclear bombs go off in 45
so now we're

3042
00:55:18,589 --> 00:55:18,599

 

3043
00:55:18,599 --> 00:55:21,430

77 years later yeah we're doing pretty

3044
00:55:21,430 --> 00:55:21,440
77 years later yeah we're doing pretty
 

3045
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,230
77 years later yeah we're doing pretty
good

3046
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:22,240
good
 

3047
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:25,510
good
we've never had another one go off

3048
00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:25,520
we've never had another one go off
 

3049
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:26,790
we've never had another one go off
through anger

3050
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:26,800
through anger
 

3051
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,549
through anger
but people forget

3052
00:55:28,549 --> 00:55:28,559
but people forget
 

3053
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:30,870
but people forget
people forget the lessons of history

3054
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:30,880
people forget the lessons of history
 

3055
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,870
people forget the lessons of history
well yeah that's how i mean i am worried

3056
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:32,880
well yeah that's how i mean i am worried
 

3057
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,549
well yeah that's how i mean i am worried
about it i mean that

3058
00:55:34,549 --> 00:55:34,559
about it i mean that
 

3059
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:36,150
about it i mean that
that is definitely a

3060
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:36,160
that is definitely a
 

3061
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,270
that is definitely a
challenge

3062
00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:37,280
challenge
 

3063
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,030
challenge
but you believe that

3064
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:39,040
but you believe that
 

3065
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,829
but you believe that
we'll make it out and ultimately super

3066
00:55:41,829 --> 00:55:41,839
we'll make it out and ultimately super
 

3067
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:44,390
we'll make it out and ultimately super
intelligent ai will help us make it out

3068
00:55:44,390 --> 00:55:44,400
intelligent ai will help us make it out
 

3069
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,510
intelligent ai will help us make it out
as opposed to uh destroy us

3070
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:47,520
as opposed to uh destroy us
 

3071
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:48,789
as opposed to uh destroy us
i think so

3072
00:55:48,789 --> 00:55:48,799
i think so
 

3073
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:50,870
i think so
but we we do have to be mindful of these

3074
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:50,880
but we we do have to be mindful of these
 

3075
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,230
but we we do have to be mindful of these
dangers

3076
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:52,240
dangers
 

3077
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,150
dangers
and and there are other dangers besides

3078
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:54,160
and and there are other dangers besides
 

3079
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,230
and and there are other dangers besides
nuclear weapons

3080
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:56,240
nuclear weapons
 

3081
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:56,950
nuclear weapons
so

3082
00:55:56,950 --> 00:55:56,960
so
 

3083
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,950
so
to get back to

3084
00:55:58,950 --> 00:55:58,960
to get back to
 

3085
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,950
to get back to
merging with ai

3086
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:00,960
merging with ai
 

3087
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,950
merging with ai
we would be able to upload our mind in a

3088
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:02,960
we would be able to upload our mind in a
 

3089
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,829
we would be able to upload our mind in a
computer

3090
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:05,839

 

3091
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:08,309

in a way where we might even

3092
00:56:08,309 --> 00:56:08,319
in a way where we might even
 

3093
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:11,510
in a way where we might even
transcend the constraints of our bodies

3094
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:11,520
transcend the constraints of our bodies
 

3095
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,829
transcend the constraints of our bodies
so copy our mind into a computer and

3096
00:56:13,829 --> 00:56:13,839
so copy our mind into a computer and
 

3097
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:17,270
so copy our mind into a computer and
leave the body behind

3098
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:17,280
leave the body behind
 

3099
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,870
leave the body behind
let me describe one thing i've already

3100
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:18,880
let me describe one thing i've already
 

3101
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,870
let me describe one thing i've already
done with my father

3102
00:56:20,870 --> 00:56:20,880
done with my father
 

3103
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,589
done with my father
that's a great story

3104
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:23,599
that's a great story
 

3105
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:25,670
that's a great story
so we we created technology this is

3106
00:56:25,670 --> 00:56:25,680
so we we created technology this is
 

3107
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,309
so we we created technology this is
public came out i think

3108
00:56:28,309 --> 00:56:28,319
public came out i think
 

3109
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:31,670
public came out i think
six years ago where you could

3110
00:56:31,670 --> 00:56:31,680
six years ago where you could
 

3111
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,589
six years ago where you could
ask any question

3112
00:56:33,589 --> 00:56:33,599
ask any question
 

3113
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:35,750
ask any question
and the release product which i think is

3114
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:35,760
and the release product which i think is
 

3115
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,589
and the release product which i think is
still on the market

3116
00:56:37,589 --> 00:56:37,599
still on the market
 

3117
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:40,870
still on the market
it would read 200 000 books

3118
00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:40,880
it would read 200 000 books

but i was also able to to take it and

3132
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:01,040
but i was also able to to take it and
 

3133
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:03,349
but i was also able to to take it and
uh not go through 200 000 books but go

3134
00:57:03,349 --> 00:57:03,359
uh not go through 200 000 books but go
 

3135
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:05,430
uh not go through 200 000 books but go
through a book that i'd

3136
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:05,440
through a book that i'd
 

3137
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,870
through a book that i'd
put together

3138
00:57:06,870 --> 00:57:06,880
put together
 

3139
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,710
put together
which is basically everything my father

3140
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:08,720
which is basically everything my father
 

3141
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,789
which is basically everything my father
had written

3142
00:57:10,789 --> 00:57:10,799
had written
 

3143
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:13,190
had written
so everything he had written i had

3144
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:13,200
so everything he had written i had
 

3145
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,470
so everything he had written i had
gathered

3146
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:14,480
gathered
 

3147
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:17,030
gathered
and we created a book

3148
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:17,040
and we created a book
 

3149
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,549
and we created a book
everything that

3150
00:57:18,549 --> 00:57:18,559
everything that
 

3151
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:21,109
everything that
frederick is all had written now

3152
00:57:21,109 --> 00:57:21,119
frederick is all had written now
 

3153
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:22,630
frederick is all had written now
i didn't think this actually would work

3154
00:57:22,630 --> 00:57:22,640
i didn't think this actually would work
 

3155
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,950
i didn't think this actually would work

and it was the first school in europe
 

3323
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,470
and it was the first school in europe
that provided higher education for girls

3324
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:42,480
that provided higher education for girls
 

3325
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:45,349
that provided higher education for girls
it went through 14th grade

3326
01:00:45,349 --> 01:00:45,359
it went through 14th grade
 

3327
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:47,510
it went through 14th grade
if you were a girl and you were lucky

3328
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:47,520
if you were a girl and you were lucky
 

3329
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:50,470
if you were a girl and you were lucky
enough to get an education at all

3330
01:00:50,470 --> 01:00:50,480
enough to get an education at all
 

3331
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,710
enough to get an education at all
it would go through like ninth grade

3332
01:00:52,710 --> 01:00:52,720
it would go through like ninth grade
 

3333
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,069
it would go through like ninth grade
and many people didn't have any

3334
01:00:54,069 --> 01:00:54,079
and many people didn't have any
 

3335
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:56,390
and many people didn't have any
education as a girl

3336
01:00:56,390 --> 01:00:56,400
education as a girl
 

3337
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:59,030
education as a girl
this went through 14th grade

3338
01:00:59,030 --> 01:00:59,040
this went through 14th grade
 

3339
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,470
this went through 14th grade
um

3340
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:00,480
um
 

3341
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:03,829
um
her mother created it she took it over

the history of the school and her
 

3347
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:11,670
the history of the school and her
involvement with it

3348
01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:11,680
involvement with it
 

3349
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:12,789
involvement with it
um

3350
01:01:12,789 --> 01:01:12,799
um
 

3351
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:14,789
um
when she presented to me i was

3352
01:01:14,789 --> 01:01:14,799
when she presented to me i was
 

3353
01:01:14,799 --> 01:01:17,990
when she presented to me i was
not so interested in the story of the of

3354
01:01:17,990 --> 01:01:18,000
not so interested in the story of the of
 

3355
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,990
not so interested in the story of the of
the school

3356
01:01:19,990 --> 01:01:20,000
the school
 

3357
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,710
the school
but i was totally amazed

3358
01:01:22,710 --> 01:01:22,720
but i was totally amazed
 

3359
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:25,190
but i was totally amazed
with this manual typewriter

3360
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:25,200
with this manual typewriter
 

3361
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,030
with this manual typewriter
i mean here is something you could put a

3362
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:27,040
i mean here is something you could put a
 

3363
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:29,270
i mean here is something you could put a
blank piece of paper into

3364
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:29,280
blank piece of paper into
 

3365
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,870
blank piece of paper into
and you could turn it into something

3366
01:01:30,870 --> 01:01:30,880
and you could turn it into something
 

3367
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:33,589
and you could turn it into something
that looked like it came from a book

3368
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:33,599
that looked like it came from a book
 

3369
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:35,030
that looked like it came from a book
and you could actually type on it and it

3370
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:35,040
and you could actually type on it and it
 

3371
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:36,549
and you could actually type on it and it
looked like it came from a book it was

3372
01:01:36,549 --> 01:01:36,559
looked like it came from a book it was
 

3373
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:38,950
looked like it came from a book it was
just amazing to me

3374
01:01:38,950 --> 01:01:38,960
just amazing to me
 

3375
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:42,470
just amazing to me
and i could see actually how it worked

3376
01:01:42,470 --> 01:01:42,480
and i could see actually how it worked
 

3377
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:46,950
and i could see actually how it worked
and i was also interested in magic

3378
01:01:46,950 --> 01:01:46,960

 

3379
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,510

but in magic if somebody actually knows

3380
01:01:49,510 --> 01:01:49,520
but in magic if somebody actually knows
 

3381
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:52,470
but in magic if somebody actually knows
how it works the magic goes away the

3382
01:01:52,470 --> 01:01:52,480
how it works the magic goes away the
 

3383
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,230
how it works the magic goes away the
magic doesn't stay there if you actually

3384
01:01:54,230 --> 01:01:54,240
magic doesn't stay there if you actually
 

3385
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,390
magic doesn't stay there if you actually
understand how it works

3386
01:01:56,390 --> 01:01:56,400
understand how it works
 

3387
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,390
understand how it works
but he was technology i didn't have that

3388
01:01:58,390 --> 01:01:58,400
but he was technology i didn't have that
 

3389
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,870
but he was technology i didn't have that
word when i was five or six

3390
01:02:00,870 --> 01:02:00,880
word when i was five or six
 

3391
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,470
word when i was five or six
and the magic was still there for you

3392
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:02,480
and the magic was still there for you
 

3393
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,549
and the magic was still there for you
the magic was still there even if you

3394
01:02:04,549 --> 01:02:04,559
the magic was still there even if you
 

3395
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:06,789
the magic was still there even if you
knew how it worked yeah

3396
01:02:06,789 --> 01:02:06,799
knew how it worked yeah
 

3397
01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:08,630
knew how it worked yeah
so i became totally interested in this

3398
01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:08,640
so i became totally interested in this
 

3399
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:11,910
so i became totally interested in this
and then went around collected little

3400
01:02:11,910 --> 01:02:11,920
and then went around collected little
 

3401
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:14,870
and then went around collected little
pieces of mechanical objects

3402
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:14,880
pieces of mechanical objects
 

3403
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,750
pieces of mechanical objects
from bicycles from broken radios i go

3404
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:17,760
from bicycles from broken radios i go
 

3405
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:18,829
from bicycles from broken radios i go
through the

3406
01:02:18,829 --> 01:02:18,839
through the
 

3407
01:02:18,839 --> 01:02:21,589
through the
neighborhood uh this was an era where

3408
01:02:21,589 --> 01:02:21,599
neighborhood uh this was an era where
 

3409
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:23,670
neighborhood uh this was an era where
you would allow five or six-year-olds to

3410
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:23,680
you would allow five or six-year-olds to
 

3411
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,190
you would allow five or six-year-olds to
like roam through the neighborhood and

3412
01:02:25,190 --> 01:02:25,200
like roam through the neighborhood and
 

3413

do this
we don't do that anymore but

3416
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:28,480
we don't do that anymore but
 

3417
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,630
we don't do that anymore but
i didn't know how to put them together i

3418
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:30,640
i didn't know how to put them together i
 

3419
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:32,549
i didn't know how to put them together i
said if i could just figure out how to

3420
01:02:32,549 --> 01:02:32,559
said if i could just figure out how to
 

3421
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:34,950
said if i could just figure out how to
put these things together i could solve

3422
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:34,960
put these things together i could solve
 

3423
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,190
put these things together i could solve
any problem

3424
01:02:37,190 --> 01:02:37,200
any problem
 

3425
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,670
any problem
and i actually remember talking to these

3426
01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:39,680
and i actually remember talking to these
 

3427
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:45,190
and i actually remember talking to these
very old girls i think they were 10

3428
01:02:45,190 --> 01:02:45,200

 

3429
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,430

and telling them if i could just figure

3430
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:47,440
and telling them if i could just figure
 

3431
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,430
and telling them if i could just figure
this out like we could fly we could do

3432
01:02:49,430 --> 01:02:49,440
this out like we could fly we could do
 

3433
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:50,710
this out like we could fly we could do
anything and

3434
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:50,720
anything and
 

3435
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:52,309
anything and
they said well you have quite an

3436
01:02:52,309 --> 01:02:52,319
they said well you have quite an
 

3437
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:55,109
they said well you have quite an
imagination

3438
01:02:55,109 --> 01:02:55,119

 

3439
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:56,069

um

3440
01:02:56,069 --> 01:02:56,079
um
 

3441
01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:57,430
um
and then like

3442
01:02:57,430 --> 01:02:57,440
and then like
 

3443
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,549
and then like
then when i was in third grade

3444
01:03:00,549 --> 01:03:00,559
then when i was in third grade
 

3445
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:02,710
then when i was in third grade
so it was like eight

3446
01:03:02,710 --> 01:03:02,720
so it was like eight
 

3447
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:05,750
so it was like eight
created like a virtual reality theater

3448
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:05,760
created like a virtual reality theater
 

3449
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:07,670
created like a virtual reality theater
where people could come on stage and

3450
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:07,680
where people could come on stage and
 

3451
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,750
where people could come on stage and
they could move their arms

3452
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:09,760
they could move their arms
 

3453
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:12,309
they could move their arms
and all of it was controlled through one

3454
01:03:12,309 --> 01:03:12,319
and all of it was controlled through one
 

3455
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:14,230
and all of it was controlled through one
control box it was all done with

3456
01:03:14,230 --> 01:03:14,240
control box it was all done with
 

3457
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:16,789
control box it was all done with
mechanical technology

3458
01:03:16,789 --> 01:03:16,799
mechanical technology
 

3459
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:19,029
mechanical technology
and it was a big hit in my third grade

3460
01:03:19,029 --> 01:03:19,039
and it was a big hit in my third grade
 

3461
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:20,950
and it was a big hit in my third grade
class

3462
01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:20,960
class
 

3463
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:22,950
class
and then i went on to do things in

3464
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:22,960
and then i went on to do things in
 

3465
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:26,390
and then i went on to do things in
junior high school science fairs and and

3466
01:03:26,390 --> 01:03:26,400
junior high school science fairs and and
 

3467
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:27,910
junior high school science fairs and and
high school science fairs i won the

3468
01:03:27,910 --> 01:03:27,920
high school science fairs i won the
 

3469
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:30,549
high school science fairs i won the
westinghouse science talent search

3470
01:03:30,549 --> 01:03:30,559
westinghouse science talent search
 

3471
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:32,950
westinghouse science talent search
so i mean i became committed to

3472
01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:32,960
so i mean i became committed to
 

3473
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:35,990
so i mean i became committed to
technology when i was

3474
01:03:35,990 --> 01:03:36,000
technology when i was
 

3475
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,710
technology when i was
five or six years old

3476
01:03:38,710 --> 01:03:38,720
five or six years old
 

3477
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,230
five or six years old
you've talked about

3478
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:40,240
you've talked about
 

3479
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:43,029
you've talked about
how you use lucid dreaming to think to

3480
01:03:43,029 --> 01:03:43,039
how you use lucid dreaming to think to
 

3481
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:44,710
how you use lucid dreaming to think to
come up with ideas as a source of

3482
01:03:44,710 --> 01:03:44,720
come up with ideas as a source of
 

3483
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:47,270
come up with ideas as a source of
creativity because you maybe

3484
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:47,280
creativity because you maybe
 

3485
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,270
creativity because you maybe
talk through that

3486
01:03:49,270 --> 01:03:49,280
talk through that
 

3487
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:52,069
talk through that
maybe the process of how to you've

3488
01:03:52,069 --> 01:03:52,079
maybe the process of how to you've
 

3489
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:53,990
maybe the process of how to you've
invented a lot of things

3490
01:03:53,990 --> 01:03:54,000
invented a lot of things
 

3491
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,670
invented a lot of things
you've came up and thought through some

3492
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:55,680
you've came up and thought through some
 

3493
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:56,829
you've came up and thought through some
very interesting

3494
01:03:56,829 --> 01:03:56,839
very interesting
 

3495
01:03:56,839 --> 01:04:00,230
very interesting
ideas what advice would you give or

3496
01:04:00,230 --> 01:04:00,240
ideas what advice would you give or
 

3497
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:03,270
ideas what advice would you give or
can you speak to the process of thinking

3498
01:04:03,270 --> 01:04:03,280
can you speak to the process of thinking
 

3499
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:06,950
can you speak to the process of thinking
of how to think how to think creatively

3500
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:06,960
of how to think how to think creatively
 

3501
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:09,510
of how to think how to think creatively
well i mean sometimes i will think

3502
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:09,520
well i mean sometimes i will think
 

3503
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:11,430
well i mean sometimes i will think
through in a dream and try to

3504
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:11,440
through in a dream and try to
 

3505
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,349
through in a dream and try to
interpret that but

3506
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:13,359
interpret that but
 

3507
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:14,630
interpret that but
i think the key

3508
01:04:14,630 --> 01:04:14,640
i think the key
 

3509
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:17,029
i think the key
issue that i would

3510
01:04:17,029 --> 01:04:17,039
issue that i would
 

3511
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:17,990
issue that i would
tell

3512
01:04:17,990 --> 01:04:18,000
tell
 

3513
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,150
tell
younger people

3514
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:22,160

 

3515
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:25,670

is to put yourself in the position

3516
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:25,680
is to put yourself in the position
 

3517
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:27,430
is to put yourself in the position
what you're trying to create

3518
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:27,440
what you're trying to create
 

3519
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:30,549
what you're trying to create
already exists

3520
01:04:30,549 --> 01:04:30,559

 

3521
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:31,510

and then

3522
01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:31,520
and then
 

3523
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:32,870
and then
you're explaining

3524
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:32,880
you're explaining
 

3525
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:34,789
you're explaining
like

3526
01:04:34,789 --> 01:04:34,799
like
 

3527
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:36,870
like
how it works

3528
01:04:36,870 --> 01:04:36,880
how it works
 

3529
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:38,069
how it works
exactly

3530
01:04:38,069 --> 01:04:38,079
exactly
 

3531
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:39,670
exactly
that's really interesting you paint a

3532
01:04:39,670 --> 01:04:39,680
that's really interesting you paint a
 

3533
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:41,589
that's really interesting you paint a
world that you

3534
01:04:41,589 --> 01:04:41,599
world that you
 

3535
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:44,390
world that you
would like to exist you think it exists

3536
01:04:44,390 --> 01:04:44,400
would like to exist you think it exists
 

3537
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,990
would like to exist you think it exists
and reverse engineering then you

3538
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:46,000
and reverse engineering then you
 

3539
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,829
and reverse engineering then you
actually imagine you're giving a speech

3540
01:04:47,829 --> 01:04:47,839
actually imagine you're giving a speech
 

3541
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:50,309
actually imagine you're giving a speech
about how you created this well you'd

3542
01:04:50,309 --> 01:04:50,319
about how you created this well you'd
 

3543
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:52,870
about how you created this well you'd
have to then work backwards as to

3544
01:04:52,870 --> 01:04:52,880
have to then work backwards as to
 

3545
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:55,829
have to then work backwards as to
how you would create it in order to

3546
01:04:55,829 --> 01:04:55,839
how you would create it in order to
 

3547
01:04:55,839 --> 01:04:57,109
how you would create it in order to
make it work

3548
01:04:57,109 --> 01:04:57,119
make it work
 

3549
01:04:57,119 --> 01:04:59,349
make it work
that's brilliant and that requires

3550
01:04:59,349 --> 01:04:59,359
that's brilliant and that requires
 

3551
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:00,069
that's brilliant and that requires
uh

3552
01:05:00,069 --> 01:05:00,079
uh
 

3553
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:01,829
uh
some imagination too some first

3554
01:05:01,829 --> 01:05:01,839
some imagination too some first
 

3555
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:04,069
some imagination too some first
principles thinking

3556
01:05:04,069 --> 01:05:04,079
principles thinking
 

3557
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:06,069
principles thinking
you have to visualize that world that's

3558
01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:06,079
you have to visualize that world that's
 

3559
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:07,670
you have to visualize that world that's
really interesting

3560
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:07,680
really interesting
 

3561
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:08,549
really interesting
and

3562
01:05:08,549 --> 01:05:08,559
and
 

3563
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:10,630
and
generally when i talk about things we're

3564
01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:10,640
generally when i talk about things we're
 

3565
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,710
generally when i talk about things we're
trying to invent i would use the present

3566
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:12,720
trying to invent i would use the present
 

3567
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:15,750
trying to invent i would use the present
tense as if it already exists

3568
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:15,760
tense as if it already exists
 

3569
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,150
tense as if it already exists
not just to give myself that confidence

3570
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:18,160
not just to give myself that confidence
 

3571
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:21,029
not just to give myself that confidence
but everybody else who's working on

3572
01:05:21,029 --> 01:05:21,039
but everybody else who's working on
 

3573
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:21,829

how much of a good idea is about timing

3586
01:05:35,109 --> 01:05:35,119
how much of a good idea is about timing
 

3587
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:38,150
how much of a good idea is about timing
how much is it about your genius versus

3588
01:05:38,150 --> 01:05:38,160
how much is it about your genius versus
 

3589
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:41,430
how much is it about your genius versus
that its time has come

3590
01:05:41,430 --> 01:05:41,440
that its time has come
 

3591
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,510
that its time has come
timing's very important i mean that

3592
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:43,520
timing's very important i mean that
 

3593
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,589
timing's very important i mean that
that's really why i got into futurism

3594
01:05:45,589 --> 01:05:45,599
that's really why i got into futurism
 

3595
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:47,510
that's really why i got into futurism
i'm not i didn't

3596
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:47,520
i'm not i didn't
 

3597
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:50,630
i'm not i didn't
i wasn't inherently a futurist that

3598
01:05:50,630 --> 01:05:50,640
i wasn't inherently a futurist that
 

3599
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:53,270
i wasn't inherently a futurist that
there's not really my goal

3600
01:05:53,270 --> 01:05:53,280
there's not really my goal
 

3601
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:54,069
there's not really my goal
uh

3602
01:05:54,069 --> 01:05:54,079
uh
 

3603
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:56,230
uh
it's really to to figure out when things

3604
01:05:56,230 --> 01:05:56,240
it's really to to figure out when things
 

3605
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:58,069
it's really to to figure out when things
are feasible

3606
01:05:58,069 --> 01:05:58,079
are feasible
 

3607
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:01,510
are feasible
we see that now with large-scale models

3608
01:06:01,510 --> 01:06:01,520
we see that now with large-scale models
 

3609
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:04,069
we see that now with large-scale models
they're very large-scale models like

3610
01:06:04,069 --> 01:06:04,079
they're very large-scale models like
 

3611
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:06,309
they're very large-scale models like
gpt-3

3612
01:06:06,309 --> 01:06:06,319
gpt-3
 

3613
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:09,430
gpt-3
it started two years ago

3614
01:06:09,430 --> 01:06:09,440
it started two years ago
 

3615
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:11,109
it started two years ago
four years ago it wasn't feasible in

3616
01:06:11,109 --> 01:06:11,119
four years ago it wasn't feasible in
 

3617
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:12,710
four years ago it wasn't feasible in
fact they did create

3618
01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:12,720
fact they did create
 

3619
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:15,430
fact they did create
gpt-2

3620
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:15,440
gpt-2
 

3621
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:18,630
gpt-2
which didn't work

3622
01:06:18,630 --> 01:06:18,640
which didn't work
 

3623
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,870
which didn't work
so it required a certain amount of

3624
01:06:20,870 --> 01:06:20,880
so it required a certain amount of
 

3625
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,150
so it required a certain amount of

3626
01:06:22,150 --> 01:06:22,160

3627
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:23,670

having to do with this exponential

3628
01:06:23,670 --> 01:06:23,680
having to do with this exponential
 

3629
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:27,270
having to do with this exponential
growth of computing power

3630
01:06:27,270 --> 01:06:27,280
growth of computing power
 

3631
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:29,750
growth of computing power
so futurism in some sense is a study of

3632
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:29,760
so futurism in some sense is a study of
 

3633
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,109
so futurism in some sense is a study of

trying to understand how the world will

3636
01:06:32,630 --> 01:06:32,640
trying to understand how the world will
 

3637
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:35,510
trying to understand how the world will
evolve yeah and when

3638
01:06:35,510 --> 01:06:35,520
evolve yeah and when
 

3639
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:38,150
evolve yeah and when
will the capacity for certain ideas

3640
01:06:38,150 --> 01:06:38,160
will the capacity for certain ideas
 

3641
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,069
will the capacity for certain ideas
and that's become a thing in itself and

3642
01:06:40,069 --> 01:06:40,079
and that's become a thing in itself and
 

3643
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:43,109
and that's become a thing in itself and
to try to time things in the future

3644
01:06:43,109 --> 01:06:43,119
to try to time things in the future
 

3645
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:46,549
to try to time things in the future
uh but really it's a original

01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:51,510
products
i mean i did

3652
01:06:51,510 --> 01:06:51,520
i mean i did
 

3653
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:55,349
i mean i did
ocr in the 1970s

3654
01:06:55,349 --> 01:06:55,359

 

3655
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:58,789

because ocrs

3656
01:06:58,789 --> 01:06:58,799

 

3657
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:01,270

doesn't require a lot of computation

3658
01:07:01,270 --> 01:07:01,280
doesn't require a lot of computation
 

3659
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:03,750
doesn't require a lot of computation
optical character recognition so we were

3660
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:03,760
optical character recognition so we were
 

3661
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:06,390
optical character recognition so we were
able to do that in the 70s

3662
01:07:06,390 --> 01:07:06,400
able to do that in the 70s
 

3663
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:09,270
able to do that in the 70s
and i waited till the 80s to address

3664
01:07:09,270 --> 01:07:09,280
and i waited till the 80s to address
 

3665
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:10,870
and i waited till the 80s to address
speech recognition

3666
01:07:10,870 --> 01:07:10,880
speech recognition
 

3667
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:12,950
speech recognition
since that requires

3668
01:07:12,950 --> 01:07:12,960
since that requires
 

3669
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:14,950
since that requires
more computation so you were thinking

3670
01:07:14,950 --> 01:07:14,960
more computation so you were thinking
 

3671
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,630
more computation so you were thinking
through timing when you're developing

3672
01:07:16,630 --> 01:07:16,640
through timing when you're developing
 

3673
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:19,670
through timing when you're developing
those things yeah has its time come

3674
01:07:19,670 --> 01:07:19,680
those things yeah has its time come
 

3675
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:21,190
those things yeah has its time come
yeah

3676
01:07:21,190 --> 01:07:21,200
yeah
 

3677
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,349
yeah
and that's how you've developed that

3678
01:07:23,349 --> 01:07:23,359
and that's how you've developed that
 

3679
01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:25,349
and that's how you've developed that
brain power to start to think in a

3680
01:07:25,349 --> 01:07:25,359
brain power to start to think in a
 

3681
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:27,510
brain power to start to think in a
futurist sense when

3682
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:27,520
futurist sense when
 

3683
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:29,750
futurist sense when
how will the world look like

3684
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:29,760
how will the world look like
 

3685
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:32,390
how will the world look like
in 2045 and work backwards yeah and how

3686
01:07:32,390 --> 01:07:32,400
in 2045 and work backwards yeah and how
 

3687
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,390
in 2045 and work backwards yeah and how
it gets there but that has become a

3688
01:07:34,390 --> 01:07:34,400
it gets there but that has become a
 

3689
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,789
it gets there but that has become a
thing in itself because

3690
01:07:36,789 --> 01:07:36,799
thing in itself because
 

3691
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:38,549
thing in itself because
looking at what

3692
01:07:38,549 --> 01:07:38,559
looking at what
 

3693
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:42,069
looking at what
uh things will be like in the future

3694
01:07:42,069 --> 01:07:42,079
uh things will be like in the future
 

3695
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:44,870
uh things will be like in the future
reflect such dramatic changes in

3696
01:07:44,870 --> 01:07:44,880
reflect such dramatic changes in
 

3697
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:48,470
reflect such dramatic changes in
in how humans will live

3698
01:07:48,470 --> 01:07:48,480
in how humans will live
 

3699
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:51,029
in how humans will live
that was worth communicating also

3700
01:07:51,029 --> 01:07:51,039
that was worth communicating also
 

3701
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:53,510
that was worth communicating also
so you developed that

3702
01:07:53,510 --> 01:07:53,520
so you developed that
 

3703
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:56,309
so you developed that
muscle of of predicting the future and

3704
01:07:56,309 --> 01:07:56,319
muscle of of predicting the future and
 

3705
01:07:56,319 --> 01:07:58,069
muscle of of predicting the future and
then apply it broadly

3706
01:07:58,069 --> 01:07:58,079
then apply it broadly
 

3707
01:07:58,079 --> 01:07:59,670
then apply it broadly
and start to discuss

3708
01:07:59,670 --> 01:07:59,680
and start to discuss
 

3709
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:02,069
and start to discuss
how it changes the world of technology

3710
01:08:02,069 --> 01:08:02,079
how it changes the world of technology
 

3711
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:05,190
how it changes the world of technology
how it changes the world of human life

3712
01:08:05,190 --> 01:08:05,200
how it changes the world of human life
 

3713
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:06,630
how it changes the world of human life
on earth

3714
01:08:06,630 --> 01:08:06,640

to quest question assumptions
i mean we see that when people

3740
01:08:36,829 --> 01:08:36,839
i mean we see that when people
 

3741
01:08:36,839 --> 01:08:40,630

computer
do you think we'll have a future with

3838
01:10:23,189 --> 01:10:23,199
do you think we'll have a future with
 

3839

do you think we'll have a future with
something you call uh afterlife we'll

3840
01:10:25,750 --> 01:10:25,760
something you call uh afterlife we'll
 

3841
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,149
something you call uh afterlife we'll
have avatars that mimic

3842
01:10:28,149 --> 01:10:28,159
have avatars that mimic
 

3843
01:10:28,159 --> 01:10:29,910
have avatars that mimic
increasingly better and better our

3844
01:10:29,910 --> 01:10:29,920
increasingly better and better our
 

3845
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:32,390
increasingly better and better our
behavior our appearance all that kind of

3846
01:10:32,390 --> 01:10:32,400
behavior our appearance all that kind of
 

3847
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:33,350
behavior our appearance all that kind of
stuff

3848
01:10:33,350 --> 01:10:33,360
stuff
 

3849
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:35,430
stuff
even those are perhaps not no longer

3850
01:10:35,430 --> 01:10:35,440
even those are perhaps not no longer
 

3851
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:36,709
even those are perhaps not no longer
with us

3852
01:10:36,709 --> 01:10:36,719
with us
 

3853
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:38,070
with us
yes i mean

3854
01:10:38,070 --> 01:10:38,080
yes i mean
 

3855
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:39,510
yes i mean
we need

3856
01:10:39,510 --> 01:10:39,520
we need
 

3857
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:42,630
we need
some information about about them

3858
01:10:42,630 --> 01:10:42,640
some information about about them
 

3859
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:45,430
some information about about them
i mean think about my father

3860
01:10:45,430 --> 01:10:45,440
i mean think about my father
 

3861
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:47,830
i mean think about my father
i have what he wrote

3862
01:10:47,830 --> 01:10:47,840
i have what he wrote
 

3863
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:50,229
i have what he wrote
now he didn't have a word processor

3864
01:10:50,229 --> 01:10:50,239
now he didn't have a word processor
 

3865
01:10:50,239 --> 01:10:51,910
now he didn't have a word processor
so he didn't actually write

3866
01:10:51,910 --> 01:10:51,920
so he didn't actually write
 

3867
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:53,510
so he didn't actually write
that much

3868
01:10:53,510 --> 01:10:53,520
that much
 

3869
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:55,830
that much
and our memories of him aren't perfect

3870
01:10:55,830 --> 01:10:55,840
and our memories of him aren't perfect
 

3871
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,830
and our memories of him aren't perfect
so how do you even know if you've

3872
01:10:57,830 --> 01:10:57,840
so how do you even know if you've
 

3873
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:59,270
so how do you even know if you've
created

3874
01:10:59,270 --> 01:10:59,280
created
 

3875
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:00,950
created
something that's satisfactory now you

3876
01:11:00,950 --> 01:11:00,960
something that's satisfactory now you
 

3877
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:03,270
something that's satisfactory now you
could do a rake frederick kurzweil

3878
01:11:03,270 --> 01:11:03,280
could do a rake frederick kurzweil
 

3879
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:04,709
could do a rake frederick kurzweil
turing test

3880
01:11:04,709 --> 01:11:04,719
turing test
 

3881
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:07,669
turing test
it seems like frederick kurzweil to me

3882
01:11:07,669 --> 01:11:07,679
it seems like frederick kurzweil to me
 

3883
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:11,030
it seems like frederick kurzweil to me
but the people who remember him like me

3884
01:11:11,030 --> 01:11:11,040
but the people who remember him like me
 

3885
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:12,950
but the people who remember him like me
don't have a perfect

3886
01:11:12,950 --> 01:11:12,960
don't have a perfect
 

3887
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:14,229
don't have a perfect
memory

3888
01:11:14,229 --> 01:11:14,239
memory
 

3889
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:15,750
memory
is there such a thing as a perfect

3890
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:15,760
is there such a thing as a perfect
 

3891
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:17,350
is there such a thing as a perfect
memory maybe

3892
01:11:17,350 --> 01:11:17,360
memory maybe
 

3893
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:19,430
memory maybe
the whole point

3894
01:11:19,430 --> 01:11:19,440
the whole point
 

3895
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:20,950
the whole point
is for

3896
01:11:20,950 --> 01:11:20,960
is for
 

3897
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:24,550
is for
him to make you feel

3898
01:11:24,550 --> 01:11:24,560
him to make you feel
 

3899
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:26,790
him to make you feel
a certain way yeah well i think that

3900
01:11:26,790 --> 01:11:26,800
a certain way yeah well i think that
 

3901
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:28,229
a certain way yeah well i think that
would be the goal

3902
01:11:28,229 --> 01:11:28,239
would be the goal
 

3903
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:29,510
would be the goal
and that's the connection we have with

3904
01:11:29,510 --> 01:11:29,520
and that's the connection we have with
 

3905
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:32,310
and that's the connection we have with
loved ones it's not really based on

3906
01:11:32,310 --> 01:11:32,320
loved ones it's not really based on
 

3907
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:35,110
loved ones it's not really based on
very strict definition of truth it's

3908
01:11:35,110 --> 01:11:35,120
very strict definition of truth it's
 

3909
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:37,350
very strict definition of truth it's
more about the experiences we share yeah

3910
01:11:37,350 --> 01:11:37,360
more about the experiences we share yeah
 

3911
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:39,669
more about the experiences we share yeah
and they get more through memory

3912
01:11:39,669 --> 01:11:39,679
and they get more through memory
 

3913
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:41,750
and they get more through memory
but ultimately they make us smile i

3914
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:41,760
but ultimately they make us smile i
 

3915
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:44,310
but ultimately they make us smile i
think we we definitely can do that

3916
01:11:44,310 --> 01:11:44,320
think we we definitely can do that
 

3917
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:46,550
think we we definitely can do that
and that would be very worthwhile

3918
01:11:46,550 --> 01:11:46,560
and that would be very worthwhile
 

3919
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:47,910
and that would be very worthwhile
so do you think we'll have a world of

3920
01:11:47,910 --> 01:11:47,920
so do you think we'll have a world of
 

3921
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,750
so do you think we'll have a world of
replicants

3922
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:49,760

01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:54,880
and take take over my friend group
 

3983
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:56,709
and take take over my friend group
and then and then i'll

3984
01:12:56,709 --> 01:12:56,719
and then and then i'll
 

3985
01:12:56,719 --> 01:12:57,990
and then and then i'll
because

3986
01:12:57,990 --> 01:12:58,000
because
 

3987
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,310
because
because they may be

3988
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:00,320
because they may be
 

3989
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:02,070
because they may be
an imperfect copy

3990
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:02,080
an imperfect copy
 

3991
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:04,070
an imperfect copy
or there may be more social or these

3992
01:13:04,070 --> 01:13:04,080
or there may be more social or these
 

3993
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:06,310
or there may be more social or these
kinds of things and then i become like

3994
01:13:06,310 --> 01:13:06,320
kinds of things and then i become like
 

3995
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:08,950
kinds of things and then i become like
the old version that's not not nearly as

3996
01:13:08,950 --> 01:13:08,960
the old version that's not not nearly as
 

3997
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:10,070
the old version that's not not nearly as
exciting

3998
01:13:10,070 --> 01:13:10,080
exciting
 

3999
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:11,750
exciting
maybe they're a copy of the best version

4000
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:11,760
maybe they're a copy of the best version
 

4001
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:13,910
maybe they're a copy of the best version
of me on a good day yeah

4002
01:13:13,910 --> 01:13:13,920
of me on a good day yeah
 

4003
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:16,830
of me on a good day yeah
but if you hang out with a replicant of

4004
01:13:16,830 --> 01:13:16,840
but if you hang out with a replicant of
 

4005
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:20,070
but if you hang out with a replicant of
me and that turned out to be successful

4006
01:13:20,070 --> 01:13:20,080
me and that turned out to be successful
 

4007
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:22,390
me and that turned out to be successful
i'd feel proud of that person because it

4008
01:13:22,390 --> 01:13:22,400
i'd feel proud of that person because it
 

4009
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:24,790
i'd feel proud of that person because it
was based on me so

4010
01:13:24,790 --> 01:13:24,800
was based on me so
 

4011
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:29,110
was based on me so
so it's but it is a kind of

4012
01:13:29,110 --> 01:13:29,120

 

4013
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:32,149

death of this version of you

4014
01:13:32,149 --> 01:13:32,159
death of this version of you
 

4015
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:34,470
death of this version of you
well not necessarily i mean you can

4016
01:13:34,470 --> 01:13:34,480
well not necessarily i mean you can
 

4017
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:36,229
well not necessarily i mean you can
still be alive right

4018
01:13:36,229 --> 01:13:36,239
still be alive right
 

4019
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:37,189
still be alive right
but

4020
01:13:37,189 --> 01:13:37,199
but
 

4021
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:38,870
but
and you would be pro okay so it's like

4022
01:13:38,870 --> 01:13:38,880
and you would be pro okay so it's like
 

4023
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:40,229
and you would be pro okay so it's like
having kids and you're proud that

4024
01:13:40,229 --> 01:13:40,239
having kids and you're proud that
 

4025
01:13:40,239 --> 01:13:41,910
having kids and you're proud that
they've done even more than you were

4026
01:13:41,910 --> 01:13:41,920
they've done even more than you were
 

4027
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:47,750
they've done even more than you were
able to do yeah exactly

4028
01:13:47,750 --> 01:13:47,760

 

4029
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:51,430

uh it does bring up new issues but

4030
01:13:51,430 --> 01:13:51,440
uh it does bring up new issues but
 

4031
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:54,950
uh it does bring up new issues but
uh it seems like an opportunity

4032
01:13:54,950 --> 01:13:54,960
uh it seems like an opportunity
 

4033
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,709
uh it seems like an opportunity
well that that replicant should probably

4034
01:13:56,709 --> 01:13:56,719
well that that replicant should probably
 

4035
01:13:56,719 --> 01:13:59,430
well that that replicant should probably
have the same rights as you do

4036
01:13:59,430 --> 01:13:59,440
have the same rights as you do
 

4037
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:00,390
have the same rights as you do
well that

4038
01:14:00,390 --> 01:14:00,400
well that
 

4039
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:02,390
well that
that gets into a whole issue

4040
01:14:02,390 --> 01:14:02,400
that gets into a whole issue
 

4041
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:03,990
that gets into a whole issue

01:14:05,189 --> 01:14:05,199
uh
 

4045
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:07,350
uh
because when a replicant occurs they're

4046
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:07,360
because when a replicant occurs they're
 

4047
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:08,709
because when a replicant occurs they're
not necessarily going to have your

4048
01:14:08,709 --> 01:14:08,719
not necessarily going to have your
 

4049
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:10,070
not necessarily going to have your
rights

4050
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:10,080
rights
 

4051
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:11,990
rights
and if a replicant occurs to somebody

4052
01:14:11,990 --> 01:14:12,000
and if a replicant occurs to somebody
 

4053
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,470
and if a replicant occurs to somebody
who's already dead

4054
01:14:14,470 --> 01:14:14,480
who's already dead
 

4055
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:16,709
who's already dead
do they have all the

4056
01:14:16,709 --> 01:14:16,719
do they have all the
 

4057
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:18,870
do they have all the
obligations and

4058
01:14:18,870 --> 01:14:18,880
obligations and
 

4059
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:21,270
obligations and
that the original person had did they

4060
01:14:21,270 --> 01:14:21,280
that the original person had did they
 

4061
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:24,390
that the original person had did they
have all the agreements that they had

4062
01:14:24,390 --> 01:14:24,400
have all the agreements that they had
 

4063
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:25,669
have all the agreements that they had
so

4064
01:14:25,669 --> 01:14:25,679
so
 

4065
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:27,110
so
i think you're going to have to have

4066
01:14:27,110 --> 01:14:27,120
i think you're going to have to have
 

4067
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:29,990
i think you're going to have to have
laws that say yes

4068
01:14:29,990 --> 01:14:30,000
laws that say yes
 

4069
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,830
laws that say yes
there has to be if you want to create a

4070
01:14:31,830 --> 01:14:31,840
there has to be if you want to create a
 

4071
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:33,110
there has to be if you want to create a
replicant

4072
01:14:33,110 --> 01:14:33,120
replicant
 

4073
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:34,870
replicant
they have to have all the same rights as

4074
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:34,880
they have to have all the same rights as
 

4075
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:36,310
they have to have all the same rights as
human rights well

4076
01:14:36,310 --> 01:14:36,320
human rights well
 

4077
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:37,590
human rights well
you don't know someone could create a

4078
01:14:37,590 --> 01:14:37,600
you don't know someone could create a
 

4079
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:39,030
you don't know someone could create a
replica and say well it's a replicant

4080
01:14:39,030 --> 01:14:39,040
replica and say well it's a replicant
 

4081
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:40,790
replica and say well it's a replicant
but i didn't bother getting their rights

4082
01:14:40,790 --> 01:14:40,800
but i didn't bother getting their rights
 

4083
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:42,709
but i didn't bother getting their rights
and so yeah but that would be illegal i

4084
01:14:42,709 --> 01:14:42,719
and so yeah but that would be illegal i
 

4085
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:43,590
and so yeah but that would be illegal i
mean

4086
01:14:43,590 --> 01:14:43,600
mean
 

4087
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:45,189
mean
like if you do that you have to do that

4088
01:14:45,189 --> 01:14:45,199
like if you do that you have to do that
 

4089
01:14:45,199 --> 01:14:47,030
like if you do that you have to do that
in the black market

4090
01:14:47,030 --> 01:14:47,040
in the black market
 

4091
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:48,390
in the black market
you have to if you want to get an

4092
01:14:48,390 --> 01:14:48,400
you have to if you want to get an
 

4093
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,870
you have to if you want to get an
official replica okay it's not so easy

4094
01:14:50,870 --> 01:14:50,880
official replica okay it's not so easy
 

4095
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:54,390
official replica okay it's not so easy
suppose you created multiple replicants

4096
01:14:54,390 --> 01:14:54,400
suppose you created multiple replicants
 

4097
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:55,270
suppose you created multiple replicants
uh

4098
01:14:55,270 --> 01:14:55,280
uh
 

4099
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:56,950
uh
the original

4100
01:14:56,950 --> 01:14:56,960
the original
 

4101
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:58,630
the original
rights

4102
01:14:58,630 --> 01:14:58,640
rights
 

4103
01:14:58,640 --> 01:14:59,750
rights
uh

4104
01:14:59,750 --> 01:14:59,760
uh
 

4105
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:01,669
uh
maybe for one person and not for a whole

4106
01:15:01,669 --> 01:15:01,679
maybe for one person and not for a whole
 

4107
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:04,709
maybe for one person and not for a whole
group of per people

4108
01:15:04,709 --> 01:15:04,719
group of per people
 

4109
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:07,990
group of per people
sure so

4110
01:15:07,990 --> 01:15:08,000

 

4111
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,470

uh so there has to be at least one

4112
01:15:10,470 --> 01:15:10,480
uh so there has to be at least one
 

4113
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:11,830
uh so there has to be at least one
and then all the other ones kind of

4114
01:15:11,830 --> 01:15:11,840
and then all the other ones kind of
 

4115
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:14,070
and then all the other ones kind of
share the rights

4116
01:15:14,070 --> 01:15:14,080
share the rights
 

4117
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,310
share the rights
yeah i just don't i don't think that

4118
01:15:16,310 --> 01:15:16,320
yeah i just don't i don't think that
 

4119
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:17,990
yeah i just don't i don't think that
that's very difficult to conceive for us

4120
01:15:17,990 --> 01:15:18,000
that's very difficult to conceive for us
 

4121
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,149
that's very difficult to conceive for us
humans the the the the idea that we

4122
01:15:20,149 --> 01:15:20,159
humans the the the the idea that we
 

4123
01:15:20,159 --> 01:15:22,310
humans the the the the idea that we
don't create a replicant

4124
01:15:22,310 --> 01:15:22,320
don't create a replicant
 

4125
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:24,390
don't create a replicant
that has certain

4126
01:15:24,390 --> 01:15:24,400
that has certain
 

4127
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:26,470
that has certain
i mean i've talked to people about this

4128
01:15:26,470 --> 01:15:26,480
i mean i've talked to people about this
 

4129
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:29,030
i mean i've talked to people about this
including my wife who would like to get

4130
01:15:29,030 --> 01:15:29,040

01:15:44,229 --> 01:15:44,239
uh
 

4147
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:45,910
uh
and they wouldn't

4148
01:15:45,910 --> 01:15:45,920
and they wouldn't
 

4149
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:47,990
and they wouldn't
she wouldn't care about any of these

4150
01:15:47,990 --> 01:15:48,000
she wouldn't care about any of these
 

4151
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,070
she wouldn't care about any of these
other rights what does your wife think

4152
01:15:50,070 --> 01:15:50,080
other rights what does your wife think
 

4153
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:53,110
other rights what does your wife think
about multiple array cores walls

4154
01:15:53,110 --> 01:15:53,120
about multiple array cores walls
 

4155
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:54,790
about multiple array cores walls
well you had that discussion i wouldn't

4156
01:15:54,790 --> 01:15:54,800
well you had that discussion i wouldn't
 

4157
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:58,070
well you had that discussion i wouldn't
address that weather

4158
01:15:58,070 --> 01:15:58,080

 

4159
01:15:58,080 --> 01:15:59,669

i think i think ultimately that's an

4160
01:15:59,669 --> 01:15:59,679
i think i think ultimately that's an
 

4161
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:01,910
i think i think ultimately that's an
important question loved ones

4162
01:16:01,910 --> 01:16:01,920
important question loved ones
 

4163
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:04,070
important question loved ones
how they feel about there's a there's

4164
01:16:04,070 --> 01:16:04,080
how they feel about there's a there's
 

4165
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:05,669
how they feel about there's a there's
something about love that's the key

4166
01:16:05,669 --> 01:16:05,679
something about love that's the key
 

4167
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:07,830
something about love that's the key
thing right if the loved one's rejected

4168
01:16:07,830 --> 01:16:07,840
thing right if the loved one's rejected
 

4169
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:12,149
thing right if the loved one's rejected
it's not going to work very well so

4170
01:16:12,149 --> 01:16:12,159

 

4171
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:15,189

so the loved ones really are the key to

4172
01:16:15,189 --> 01:16:15,199
so the loved ones really are the key to
 

4173
01:16:15,199 --> 01:16:17,110
so the loved ones really are the key to
terminate whether or not this

4174
01:16:17,110 --> 01:16:17,120
terminate whether or not this
 

4175
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:19,510
terminate whether or not this
works or not

4176
01:16:19,510 --> 01:16:19,520
works or not
 

4177
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:21,910
works or not
but there's also ethical rules

4178
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:21,920
but there's also ethical rules
 

4179
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:24,149
but there's also ethical rules
um we have to contend with the idea and

4180
01:16:24,149 --> 01:16:24,159
um we have to contend with the idea and
 

4181
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:27,110
um we have to contend with the idea and
we have to contend with that idea with

4182
01:16:27,110 --> 01:16:27,120
we have to contend with that idea with
 

4183
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:30,149
we have to contend with that idea with
ai but what's going to motivate it is

4184
01:16:30,149 --> 01:16:30,159
ai but what's going to motivate it is
 

4185
01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:33,430
ai but what's going to motivate it is
i mean i talk to people who really miss

4186
01:16:33,430 --> 01:16:33,440
i mean i talk to people who really miss
 

4187
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:35,350
i mean i talk to people who really miss
people who are gone and they would love

4188
01:16:35,350 --> 01:16:35,360
people who are gone and they would love
 

4189
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:36,630
people who are gone and they would love
to get

4190
01:16:36,630 --> 01:16:36,640
to get
 

4191
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:40,709
to get
something back even if it isn't perfect

4192
01:16:40,709 --> 01:16:40,719
something back even if it isn't perfect
 

4193
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:46,950
something back even if it isn't perfect
and that's what's going to motivate this

4194
01:16:46,950 --> 01:16:46,960

 

4195
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:48,709

and that person

4196
01:16:48,709 --> 01:16:48,719
and that person
 

4197
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:51,030
and that person
lives on in some form

4198
01:16:51,030 --> 01:16:51,040
lives on in some form
 

4199
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:53,270
lives on in some form
and the more data we have the more we're

4200
01:16:53,270 --> 01:16:53,280
and the more data we have the more we're
 

4201
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:55,910
and the more data we have the more we're
able to reconstruct that person

4202
01:16:55,910 --> 01:16:55,920
able to reconstruct that person
 

4203
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:59,189
able to reconstruct that person
and allow them to live on right

4204
01:16:59,189 --> 01:16:59,199
and allow them to live on right
 

4205
01:16:59,199 --> 01:17:01,430
and allow them to live on right
and eventually as we go forward we're

4206
01:17:01,430 --> 01:17:01,440
and eventually as we go forward we're
 

4207
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:03,030
and eventually as we go forward we're
going to have more and more of this data

4208
01:17:03,030 --> 01:17:03,040
going to have more and more of this data
 

4209
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:05,430
going to have more and more of this data
because we're going to have

4210
01:17:05,430 --> 01:17:05,440
because we're going to have
 

4211
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:08,149
because we're going to have
nanobots that are inside our neocortex

4212
01:17:08,149 --> 01:17:08,159
nanobots that are inside our neocortex
 

4213
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:10,950
nanobots that are inside our neocortex
and we're going to collect a lot of data

4214
01:17:10,950 --> 01:17:10,960
and we're going to collect a lot of data
 

4215
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:13,510
and we're going to collect a lot of data
in fact anything that's data is is

4216
01:17:13,510 --> 01:17:13,520
in fact anything that's data is is
 

4217
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:15,669
in fact anything that's data is is
always collected

4218
01:17:15,669 --> 01:17:15,679
always collected
 

4219
01:17:15,679 --> 01:17:17,189
always collected
there's something

4220
01:17:17,189 --> 01:17:17,199
there's something
 

4221
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:21,350
there's something
a little bit sad which is becoming

4222
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:21,360
a little bit sad which is becoming
 

4223
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:23,030
a little bit sad which is becoming
or maybe it's hopeful

4224
01:17:23,030 --> 01:17:23,040
or maybe it's hopeful
 

4225
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:24,070
or maybe it's hopeful
which

4226
01:17:24,070 --> 01:17:24,080
which
 

4227
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:26,630
which
is more and more common these days

4228
01:17:26,630 --> 01:17:26,640
is more and more common these days
 

4229
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:28,630
is more and more common these days
which when a person passes away you have

4230
01:17:28,630 --> 01:17:28,640
which when a person passes away you have
 

4231
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:30,470
which when a person passes away you have
their twitter account

4232
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:30,480
their twitter account
 

4233
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:31,990
their twitter account
you know and you have

4234
01:17:31,990 --> 01:17:32,000
you know and you have
 

4235
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,910
you know and you have
the last tweet they tweeted

4236
01:17:33,910 --> 01:17:33,920
the last tweet they tweeted
 

4237
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:36,070
the last tweet they tweeted
like something and you can recreate them

4238
01:17:36,070 --> 01:17:36,080
like something and you can recreate them
 

4239
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:38,149
like something and you can recreate them
now with large language models and so on

4240
01:17:38,149 --> 01:17:38,159
now with large language models and so on
 

4241
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:39,669
now with large language models and so on
i mean you can create somebody that's

4242
01:17:39,669 --> 01:17:39,679
i mean you can create somebody that's
 

4243
01:17:39,679 --> 01:17:42,229
i mean you can create somebody that's
just like them and can actually continue

4244
01:17:42,229 --> 01:17:42,239
just like them and can actually continue
 

4245
01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:43,990
just like them and can actually continue
to

4246
01:17:43,990 --> 01:17:44,000
to
 

4247
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,750
to
communicate i think that's really

4248
01:17:45,750 --> 01:17:45,760
communicate i think that's really
 

4249
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:47,590
communicate i think that's really
exciting because i think

4250
01:17:47,590 --> 01:17:47,600
exciting because i think
 

4251
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,110
exciting because i think
in some sense

4252
01:17:49,110 --> 01:17:49,120
in some sense
 

4253
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:51,590
in some sense
like if i were to die today

4254
01:17:51,590 --> 01:17:51,600
like if i were to die today
 

4255
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,910
like if i were to die today
in some sense i would continue on if i

4256
01:17:53,910 --> 01:17:53,920
in some sense i would continue on if i
 

4257
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:55,910
in some sense i would continue on if i
continued tweeting

4258
01:17:55,910 --> 01:17:55,920
continued tweeting
 

4259
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:58,709
continued tweeting
i tweet therefore i am

4260
01:17:58,709 --> 01:17:58,719
i tweet therefore i am
 

4261
01:17:58,719 --> 01:18:00,790
i tweet therefore i am
yeah well in some sense i mean that's

4262
01:18:00,790 --> 01:18:00,800
yeah well in some sense i mean that's
 

4263
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:02,630
yeah well in some sense i mean that's
one of the advantages of

4264
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:02,640
one of the advantages of
 

4265
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:05,430
one of the advantages of
a replicant that can recreate

4266
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:05,440
a replicant that can recreate
 

4267
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:07,270
a replicant that can recreate
the communications of that

4268
01:18:07,270 --> 01:18:07,280
the communications of that
 

4269
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:10,310
the communications of that
that person

4270
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:10,320

 

4271
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:11,750

do you

4272
01:18:11,750 --> 01:18:11,760
do you
 

4273
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:14,310
do you
hope do you think do you hope

4274
01:18:14,310 --> 01:18:14,320
hope do you think do you hope
 

4275
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:16,070
hope do you think do you hope
humans will become a multi-planetary

4276
01:18:16,070 --> 01:18:16,080
humans will become a multi-planetary
 

4277
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,270
humans will become a multi-planetary
species

4278
01:18:17,270 --> 01:18:17,280
species
 

4279
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:19,350
species
you've talked about the phases the six

4280
01:18:19,350 --> 01:18:19,360
you've talked about the phases the six
 

4281
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:21,669
you've talked about the phases the six
epics and one of them is reaching out

4282
01:18:21,669 --> 01:18:21,679
epics and one of them is reaching out
 

4283
01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:25,270
epics and one of them is reaching out
into the stars in part yes but

4284
01:18:25,270 --> 01:18:25,280
into the stars in part yes but
 

4285
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:27,990
into the stars in part yes but
uh the kind of attempts i'm making now

4286
01:18:27,990 --> 01:18:28,000
uh the kind of attempts i'm making now
 

4287
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,189
uh the kind of attempts i'm making now
to go to other

4288
01:18:29,189 --> 01:18:29,199
to go to other
 

4289
01:18:29,199 --> 01:18:31,910
to go to other
planetary

4290
01:18:31,910 --> 01:18:31,920
planetary
 

4291
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:34,229
planetary
objects

4292
01:18:34,229 --> 01:18:34,239
objects
 

4293
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:36,310
objects
doesn't excite me that much

4294
01:18:36,310 --> 01:18:36,320
doesn't excite me that much
 

4295
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:37,669
doesn't excite me that much
because it's not really advancing

4296
01:18:37,669 --> 01:18:37,679
because it's not really advancing
 

4297
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:39,750
because it's not really advancing
anything it's not

4298
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:39,760
anything it's not
 

4299
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:42,070
anything it's not
efficient enough yeah

4300
01:18:42,070 --> 01:18:42,080
efficient enough yeah
 

4301
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:44,070
efficient enough yeah
we're also putting out other

4302
01:18:44,070 --> 01:18:44,080
we're also putting out other
 

4303
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:46,550
we're also putting out other
uh

4304
01:18:46,550 --> 01:18:46,560

 

4305
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:49,430

human beings which is a very

4306
01:18:49,430 --> 01:18:49,440
human beings which is a very
 

4307
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:51,750
human beings which is a very
inefficient way to explore these other

4308
01:18:51,750 --> 01:18:51,760
inefficient way to explore these other
 

4309
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:53,750

01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,669
universe wakes up
it's where we can spread our super

01:19:01,669 --> 01:19:01,679
it's where we can spread our super

throughout the universe
 

4325
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:06,709
throughout the universe
and that doesn't mean

4326
01:19:06,709 --> 01:19:06,719
and that doesn't mean
 

4327
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:09,350
and that doesn't mean
sending very soft squishy creatures like

4328
01:19:09,350 --> 01:19:09,360
sending very soft squishy creatures like
 

4329
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:11,350
sending very soft squishy creatures like
humans yeah

4330
01:19:11,350 --> 01:19:11,360

the universe wakes up
 

4333
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:16,550
the universe wakes up
i mean we would sense

4334
01:19:16,550 --> 01:19:16,560
i mean we would sense
 

4335
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:19,189
i mean we would sense
intelligence masses of nanobots which

4336
01:19:19,189 --> 01:19:19,199
intelligence masses of nanobots which
 

4337
01:19:19,199 --> 01:19:20,310
intelligence masses of nanobots which
can then

4338
01:19:20,310 --> 01:19:20,320
can then
 

4339
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:23,990
can then
go out and um

4340
01:19:23,990 --> 01:19:24,000
go out and um
 

4341
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,950
go out and um
colonize these these other parts of the

4342
01:19:26,950 --> 01:19:26,960
colonize these these other parts of the

do you think there's intelligent alien

4346
01:19:30,709 --> 01:19:30,719
do you think there's intelligent alien
 

4347
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:32,390
do you think there's intelligent alien
civilizations out there

4348
01:19:32,390 --> 01:19:32,400

that our bots might meet

4350
01:19:35,110 --> 01:19:35,120
that our bots might meet
 

4351
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:38,630
that our bots might meet
my hunch is no

4352
01:19:38,630 --> 01:19:38,640
my hunch is no
 

4353
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:40,950
my hunch is no
most people say yes absolutely i mean

4354
01:19:40,950 --> 01:19:40,960
most people say yes absolutely i mean
 

4355
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:41,669
most people say yes absolutely i mean

01:19:41,669 --> 01:19:41,679
the
 

4357
01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:43,750
the
universe and it's too big and they'll

01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:43,760
universe and it's too big and they'll
 

4359
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:45,030

cite the drake

4360
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:45,040
cite the drake
 

4361
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:46,630
cite the drake
equation

4362
01:19:46,630 --> 01:19:46,640
equation
 

4363
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:52,470
equation
and and i think in uh singularities near

4364
01:19:52,470 --> 01:19:52,480

 

4365
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,630

i have two analyses of the drake

4366
01:19:54,630 --> 01:19:54,640
i have two analyses of the drake
 

4367
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:56,229
i have two analyses of the drake
equation

4368
01:19:56,229 --> 01:19:56,239
equation
 

4369
01:19:56,239 --> 01:19:59,910
equation
both with very reasonable assumptions

4370
01:19:59,910 --> 01:19:59,920
both with very reasonable assumptions
 

4371
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:02,149
both with very reasonable assumptions
and one gives you

4372
01:20:02,149 --> 01:20:02,159
and one gives you
 

4373
01:20:02,159 --> 01:20:03,590
and one gives you
thousands of

4374
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:03,600
thousands of
 

4375
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:07,350
thousands of
advanced civilizations in each galaxy

4376
01:20:07,350 --> 01:20:07,360
advanced civilizations in each galaxy
 

4377
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:09,910
advanced civilizations in each galaxy
and another one gives you one

4378
01:20:09,910 --> 01:20:09,920
and another one gives you one
 

4379
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:11,669
and another one gives you one
civilization

4380
01:20:11,669 --> 01:20:11,679
civilization
 

4381
01:20:11,679 --> 01:20:13,510
civilization
and we know of one

4382
01:20:13,510 --> 01:20:13,520
and we know of one
 

4383
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:15,750
and we know of one
a lot of the analyses

4384
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:15,760
a lot of the analyses
 

4385
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:18,390
a lot of the analyses
are forgetting the exponential growth of

4386
01:20:18,390 --> 01:20:18,400
are forgetting the exponential growth of
 

4387
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:21,030
are forgetting the exponential growth of
of computation

4388
01:20:21,030 --> 01:20:21,040
of computation
 

4389
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:23,189
of computation
because we've gone

4390
01:20:23,189 --> 01:20:23,199
because we've gone
 

4391
01:20:23,199 --> 01:20:25,270
because we've gone
from where the fastest way i could send

4392
01:20:25,270 --> 01:20:25,280
from where the fastest way i could send
 

4393
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:29,990
from where the fastest way i could send
a message to somebody was with a pony

4394
01:20:29,990 --> 01:20:30,000
a message to somebody was with a pony
 

4395
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,550
a message to somebody was with a pony
which was what like uh a century and a

4396
01:20:32,550 --> 01:20:32,560
which was what like uh a century and a
 

4397
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:34,149
which was what like uh a century and a
half ago yeah

4398
01:20:34,149 --> 01:20:34,159
half ago yeah
 

4399
01:20:34,159 --> 01:20:35,990
half ago yeah
uh to

4400
01:20:35,990 --> 01:20:36,000
uh to
 

4401
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,750
uh to
the advanced civilization we have today

4402
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:37,760
the advanced civilization we have today
 

4403
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:40,790
the advanced civilization we have today
and and if you accept what i've said

4404
01:20:40,790 --> 01:20:40,800
and and if you accept what i've said
 

4405
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:43,110
and and if you accept what i've said
go forward a few decades you can have

4406
01:20:43,110 --> 01:20:43,120
go forward a few decades you can have
 

4407
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:45,350
go forward a few decades you can have
absolutely fantastic amount of

4408
01:20:45,350 --> 01:20:45,360
absolutely fantastic amount of
 

4409
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:46,630
absolutely fantastic amount of
civilization

4410
01:20:46,630 --> 01:20:46,640
civilization
 

4411
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:48,550
civilization
compared to a pony and that's in a

4412
01:20:48,550 --> 01:20:48,560
compared to a pony and that's in a
 

4413
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:50,229
compared to a pony and that's in a
couple hundred years

4414
01:20:50,229 --> 01:20:50,239
couple hundred years
 

4415
01:20:50,239 --> 01:20:51,830
couple hundred years
yeah the speed and the scale of

4416
01:20:51,830 --> 01:20:51,840
yeah the speed and the scale of
 

4417
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:54,390
yeah the speed and the scale of
information transfer is just exp is

4418
01:20:54,390 --> 01:20:54,400
information transfer is just exp is
 

4419
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,229
information transfer is just exp is
growing exponentially

4420
01:20:56,229 --> 01:20:56,239
growing exponentially
 

4421
01:20:56,239 --> 01:20:58,630
growing exponentially
in a blink of an eye

4422
01:20:58,630 --> 01:20:58,640
in a blink of an eye
 

4423
01:20:58,640 --> 01:20:59,830
in a blink of an eye
now think about these other

4424
01:20:59,830 --> 01:20:59,840
now think about these other
 

4425
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:01,669
now think about these other
civilizations

4426
01:21:01,669 --> 01:21:01,679
civilizations
 

4427
01:21:01,679 --> 01:21:04,149
civilizations
they're going to be spread out at cosmic

4428
01:21:04,149 --> 01:21:04,159
they're going to be spread out at cosmic
 

4429
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:06,229
they're going to be spread out at cosmic
times

4430
01:21:06,229 --> 01:21:06,239
times
 

4431
01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:08,870
times
so if something is like ahead of us or

4432
01:21:08,870 --> 01:21:08,880
so if something is like ahead of us or
 

4433
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:11,030
so if something is like ahead of us or
behind us it could be ahead of us or

4434
01:21:11,030 --> 01:21:11,040
behind us it could be ahead of us or
 

4435
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:13,270
behind us it could be ahead of us or
behind us by

4436
01:21:13,270 --> 01:21:13,280
behind us by
 

4437
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:15,189
behind us by
maybe millions of years

4438
01:21:15,189 --> 01:21:15,199
maybe millions of years
 

4439
01:21:15,199 --> 01:21:17,910
maybe millions of years
which isn't that much i mean the the

4440
01:21:17,910 --> 01:21:17,920
which isn't that much i mean the the
 

4441
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:19,189
which isn't that much i mean the the
world is

4442
01:21:19,189 --> 01:21:19,199
world is
 

4443
01:21:19,199 --> 01:21:21,430
world is
billions of years old

4444
01:21:21,430 --> 01:21:21,440
billions of years old
 

4445
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:23,910
billions of years old
14 billion or something

4446
01:21:23,910 --> 01:21:23,920
14 billion or something
 

4447
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:25,189
14 billion or something
so

4448
01:21:25,189 --> 01:21:25,199
so
 

4449
01:21:25,199 --> 01:21:27,350
so
even a thousand years

4450
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:27,360
even a thousand years
 

4451
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:29,350
even a thousand years
if two or three hundred years just

4452
01:21:29,350 --> 01:21:29,360
if two or three hundred years just
 

4453
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:31,590
if two or three hundred years just
enough to go from a pony to fantastic

4454
01:21:31,590 --> 01:21:31,600
enough to go from a pony to fantastic
 

4455
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,750
enough to go from a pony to fantastic
amount of civilization

4456
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:33,760
amount of civilization
 

4457
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:35,830
amount of civilization
we would see that

4458
01:21:35,830 --> 01:21:35,840
we would see that
 

4459
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:38,149
we would see that
so of other civilizations that have

4460
01:21:38,149 --> 01:21:38,159
so of other civilizations that have
 

4461
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:39,510
so of other civilizations that have
occurred

4462
01:21:39,510 --> 01:21:39,520
occurred
 

4463
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:41,990
occurred
okay some might be hot behind us but

4464
01:21:41,990 --> 01:21:42,000
okay some might be hot behind us but
 

4465
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,830
okay some might be hot behind us but
some might be ahead of us

4466
01:21:43,830 --> 01:21:43,840
some might be ahead of us
 

4467
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:45,430
some might be ahead of us
if they're ahead of us they're ahead of

4468
01:21:45,430 --> 01:21:45,440
if they're ahead of us they're ahead of
 

4469
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:47,430
if they're ahead of us they're ahead of
us by

4470
01:21:47,430 --> 01:21:47,440
us by
 

4471
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:49,750
us by
thousands millions of years and they

4472
01:21:49,750 --> 01:21:49,760
thousands millions of years and they
 

4473
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:52,229
thousands millions of years and they
would be so far beyond us they would be

4474
01:21:52,229 --> 01:21:52,239
would be so far beyond us they would be
 

4475
01:21:52,239 --> 01:21:56,149
would be so far beyond us they would be
doing galaxy-wide engineering yeah but

4476
01:21:56,149 --> 01:21:56,159
doing galaxy-wide engineering yeah but
 

4477
01:21:56,159 --> 01:21:58,470
doing galaxy-wide engineering yeah but
we don't see anything doing galaxy web

4478
01:21:58,470 --> 01:21:58,480
we don't see anything doing galaxy web
 

4479
01:21:58,480 --> 01:21:59,990
we don't see anything doing galaxy web

4481
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,870

so either they don't exist

4482
01:22:02,870 --> 01:22:02,880
so either they don't exist
 

4483
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:05,030
so either they don't exist
or this very universe

4484
01:22:05,030 --> 01:22:05,040
or this very universe
 

4485
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:08,229
or this very universe
is a construction of an alien species

4486
01:22:08,229 --> 01:22:08,239
is a construction of an alien species
 

4487
01:22:08,239 --> 01:22:11,590
is a construction of an alien species
we're living inside a video game

4488
01:22:11,590 --> 01:22:11,600
we're living inside a video game
 

4489
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:14,709
we're living inside a video game
well that's another explanation that yes

4490
01:22:14,709 --> 01:22:14,719
well that's another explanation that yes
 

4491
01:22:14,719 --> 01:22:17,350
well that's another explanation that yes
you've got some teenage kids in another

4492
01:22:17,350 --> 01:22:17,360
you've got some teenage kids in another
 

4493
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:19,110
you've got some teenage kids in another
civilization

4494
01:22:19,110 --> 01:22:19,120
civilization
 

4495
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:20,790
civilization
do you do you find compelling the

4496
01:22:20,790 --> 01:22:20,800
do you do you find compelling the
 

4497
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,709
do you do you find compelling the
simulation hypothesis as a thought

4498
01:22:22,709 --> 01:22:22,719
simulation hypothesis as a thought
 

4499
01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:24,390
simulation hypothesis as a thought
experiment that we're living in a

4500
01:22:24,390 --> 01:22:24,400
experiment that we're living in a
 

4501
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:27,189
experiment that we're living in a
simulation the universe is

4502
01:22:27,189 --> 01:22:27,199
simulation the universe is
 

4503
01:22:27,199 --> 01:22:29,270
simulation the universe is
computational

4504
01:22:29,270 --> 01:22:29,280
computational
 

4505
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:31,350
computational
so we are an example

4506
01:22:31,350 --> 01:22:31,360
so we are an example
 

4507
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:32,470
so we are an example
in a

4508
01:22:32,470 --> 01:22:32,480
in a
 

4509
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,950
in a
computational world

4510
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:34,960
computational world
 

4511
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:37,030
computational world
therefore

4512
01:22:37,030 --> 01:22:37,040
therefore
 

4513
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:39,350
therefore
uh it is a simulation it doesn't

4514
01:22:39,350 --> 01:22:39,360
uh it is a simulation it doesn't
 

4515
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:42,070
uh it is a simulation it doesn't
necessarily mean an experiment by

4516
01:22:42,070 --> 01:22:42,080
necessarily mean an experiment by
 

4517
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:44,629
necessarily mean an experiment by
some high school kid in another world

4518
01:22:44,629 --> 01:22:44,639
some high school kid in another world
 

4519
01:22:44,639 --> 01:22:46,709
some high school kid in another world
but it's nonetheless

4520
01:22:46,709 --> 01:22:46,719
but it's nonetheless
 

4521
01:22:46,719 --> 01:22:49,990
but it's nonetheless
is taking place in a computational world

4522
01:22:49,990 --> 01:22:50,000
is taking place in a computational world
 

4523
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,990
is taking place in a computational world
and everything that's going on is is

4524
01:22:51,990 --> 01:22:52,000
and everything that's going on is is
 

4525
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,430
and everything that's going on is is
basically

4526
01:22:53,430 --> 01:22:53,440
basically
 

4527
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:56,790
basically
a form of of computation

4528
01:22:56,790 --> 01:22:56,800
a form of of computation
 

4529
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,070
a form of of computation
um

4530
01:22:58,070 --> 01:22:58,080
um
 

4531
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:00,149
um
so you really have to define what you

4532
01:23:00,149 --> 01:23:00,159
so you really have to define what you
 

4533
01:23:00,159 --> 01:23:01,910
so you really have to define what you
mean by

4534
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:01,920
mean by
 

4535
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:03,750
mean by
uh

4536
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:03,760
uh
 

4537
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:06,629
uh
this whole world being a simulation well

4538
01:23:06,629 --> 01:23:06,639
this whole world being a simulation well
 

4539
01:23:06,639 --> 01:23:08,070
this whole world being a simulation well
then it's

4540
01:23:08,070 --> 01:23:08,080
then it's
 

4541
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:10,390
then it's
it's the teenager that

4542
01:23:10,390 --> 01:23:10,400
it's the teenager that
 

4543
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,550
it's the teenager that
that makes the video game you know us

4544
01:23:12,550 --> 01:23:12,560
that makes the video game you know us
 

4545
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:14,550
that makes the video game you know us
humans with our current limited

4548
01:23:16,629 --> 01:23:16,639
cognitive capability
 

4549
01:23:16,639 --> 01:23:18,709
cognitive capability
have

4550
01:23:18,709 --> 01:23:18,719
have
 

4551
01:23:18,719 --> 01:23:20,709
have
strived to understand ourselves and we

4552
01:23:20,709 --> 01:23:20,719
strived to understand ourselves and we
 

4553
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:21,669
strived to understand ourselves and we
have

4554
01:23:21,669 --> 01:23:21,679
have
 

4555
01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:23,669
have
created religions

4556
01:23:23,669 --> 01:23:23,679
created religions
 

4557
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:26,390
created religions
we think of god

4558
01:23:26,390 --> 01:23:26,400
we think of god
 

4559
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:29,990
we think of god
whatever that is

4560
01:23:29,990 --> 01:23:30,000

 

4561
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,070

do you think god exists

4562
01:23:32,070 --> 01:23:32,080
do you think god exists
 

4563
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:35,189
do you think god exists
and if so who is god

4564
01:23:35,189 --> 01:23:35,199
and if so who is god
 

4565
01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:38,310
and if so who is god
i alluded to this before we we started

4566
01:23:38,310 --> 01:23:38,320
i alluded to this before we we started
 

4567
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:39,669
i alluded to this before we we started
out with

4568
01:23:39,669 --> 01:23:39,679
out with
 

4569
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:42,870
out with
lots of particles going around yeah and

4570
01:23:42,870 --> 01:23:42,880
lots of particles going around yeah and
 

4571
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:45,669
lots of particles going around yeah and
there's nothing that represents

4572
01:23:45,669 --> 01:23:45,679
there's nothing that represents
 

4573
01:23:45,679 --> 01:23:47,430
there's nothing that represents
love

4574
01:23:47,430 --> 01:23:47,440
love
 

4575
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:48,390
love
and

4576
01:23:48,390 --> 01:23:48,400
and
 

4577
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:50,310
and
creativity

4578
01:23:50,310 --> 01:23:50,320
creativity
 

4579
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:52,950
creativity
um

4580
01:23:52,950 --> 01:23:52,960

 

4581
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:54,790

and somehow we've gotten into a world

4582
01:23:54,790 --> 01:23:54,800
and somehow we've gotten into a world
 

4583
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:57,830
and somehow we've gotten into a world
where love actually exists

4584
01:23:57,830 --> 01:23:57,840
where love actually exists
 

4585
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:59,110
where love actually exists
and that has to do actually with

4586
01:23:59,110 --> 01:23:59,120
and that has to do actually with
 

4587
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:00,629
and that has to do actually with
consciousness because you can't have

4588
01:24:00,629 --> 01:24:00,639
consciousness because you can't have
 

4589
01:24:00,639 --> 01:24:03,030
consciousness because you can't have
love without consciousness

4590
01:24:03,030 --> 01:24:03,040
love without consciousness
 

4591
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:05,830
love without consciousness
so to me that's god the fact that we

4592
01:24:05,830 --> 01:24:05,840
so to me that's god the fact that we
 

4593
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:08,629
so to me that's god the fact that we
have something where

4594
01:24:08,629 --> 01:24:08,639
have something where
 

4595
01:24:08,639 --> 01:24:10,709
have something where
love where you can be devoted to someone

4596
01:24:10,709 --> 01:24:10,719
love where you can be devoted to someone
 

4597
01:24:10,719 --> 01:24:13,189
love where you can be devoted to someone
else and and really feel that

4598
01:24:13,189 --> 01:24:13,199
else and and really feel that
 

4599
01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:14,550
else and and really feel that
love

4600
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:14,560
love
 

4601
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:16,229
love
um

4602
01:24:16,229 --> 01:24:16,239
um
 

4603
01:24:16,239 --> 01:24:18,870
um
that's that's god

4604
01:24:18,870 --> 01:24:18,880
that's that's god
 

4605
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:21,990
that's that's god
and if you look at the old testament

4606
01:24:21,990 --> 01:24:22,000
and if you look at the old testament
 

4607
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,030
and if you look at the old testament
it was actually created by several

4608
01:24:25,030 --> 01:24:25,040
it was actually created by several
 

4609
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:26,550
it was actually created by several
different

4610
01:24:26,550 --> 01:24:26,560
different
 

4611
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:27,750
different
rabbinates

4612
01:24:27,750 --> 01:24:27,760
rabbinates
 

4613
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:29,030
rabbinates
in there

4614
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:29,040
in there
 

4615
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:31,830
in there
and i think they've identified three of

4616
01:24:31,830 --> 01:24:31,840
and i think they've identified three of
 

4617
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,910
and i think they've identified three of
them

4618
01:24:33,910 --> 01:24:33,920
them
 

4619
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:35,510
them
one one of them

4620
01:24:35,510 --> 01:24:35,520
one one of them
 

4621
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:38,070
one one of them
dealt with god

4622
01:24:38,070 --> 01:24:38,080
dealt with god
 

4623
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:40,790
dealt with god
as a person that you can make deals with

4624
01:24:40,790 --> 01:24:40,800
as a person that you can make deals with
 

4625
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:43,750
as a person that you can make deals with
and he gets angry and he

4626
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:43,760
and he gets angry and he
 

4627
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:45,189
and he gets angry and he
wrecks

4628
01:24:45,189 --> 01:24:45,199
wrecks
 

4629
01:24:45,199 --> 01:24:48,070
wrecks
vengeance on various people

4630
01:24:48,070 --> 01:24:48,080
vengeance on various people
 

4631
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:50,310
vengeance on various people
but two of them actually talk about god

4632
01:24:50,310 --> 01:24:50,320
but two of them actually talk about god
 

4633
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:54,870
but two of them actually talk about god
as a symbol of love and peace and

4634
01:24:54,870 --> 01:24:54,880
as a symbol of love and peace and
 

4635
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:56,229
as a symbol of love and peace and
harmony and

4636
01:24:56,229 --> 01:24:56,239
harmony and
 

4637
01:24:56,239 --> 01:25:00,790
harmony and
so forth uh that's how they describe god

4638
01:25:00,790 --> 01:25:00,800
so forth uh that's how they describe god
 

4639
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:03,510
so forth uh that's how they describe god
and so that's my view of god

4640
01:25:03,510 --> 01:25:03,520
and so that's my view of god
 

4641
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:06,709
and so that's my view of god
not not as a person in the sky that you

4642
01:25:06,709 --> 01:25:06,719
not not as a person in the sky that you
 

4643
01:25:06,719 --> 01:25:08,870
not not as a person in the sky that you
can make deals with

4644
01:25:08,870 --> 01:25:08,880
can make deals with
 

4645
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:11,030
can make deals with
it's whatever the magic that goes from

4646
01:25:11,030 --> 01:25:11,040

do you think about your own mortality

4718
01:26:33,910 --> 01:26:33,920
do you think about your own mortality
 

4719
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:36,310
do you think about your own mortality
are you afraid of it

are you afraid of it
 

4721
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:39,350
are you afraid of it
yes but i keep going back

4722
01:26:39,350 --> 01:26:39,360
yes but i keep going back
 

4723
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:40,709
yes but i keep going back
to my

01:26:55,590 --> 01:26:55,600
um
 

4737
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:58,390
um
which we're not quite at yet

4738
01:26:58,390 --> 01:26:58,400
which we're not quite at yet
 

4739
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:01,350
which we're not quite at yet
but i think we're actually pretty close

4740
01:27:01,350 --> 01:27:01,360
but i think we're actually pretty close
 

4741
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:03,430
but i think we're actually pretty close
particularly with for example doing

4742
01:27:03,430 --> 01:27:03,440
particularly with for example doing

4745
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,750
simulated biology
uh i think we can probably get there

4746
01:27:07,750 --> 01:27:07,760
uh i think we can probably get there
 

4747
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:08,709
uh i think we can probably get there
within

4748

within
 

4749
01:27:08,719 --> 01:27:11,110
within
say by the end of this decade

4750
01:27:11,110 --> 01:27:11,120
say by the end of this decade
 

4751
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:12,629
say by the end of this decade
and that's my goal

4752
01:27:12,629 --> 01:27:12,639
and that's my goal
 

4753
01:27:12,639 --> 01:27:15,030
and that's my goal
you hope to achieve the longevity escape

4754
01:27:15,030 --> 01:27:15,040
you hope to achieve the longevity escape
 

4755
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:16,229
you hope to achieve the longevity escape

you hope to achieve immortality

4758
01:27:20,709 --> 01:27:20,719

 

4759
01:27:20,719 --> 01:27:23,430

well immortality is hard to say i can't

4760
01:27:23,430 --> 01:27:23,440
well immortality is hard to say i can't
 

4761
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:25,030
well immortality is hard to say i can't
really come on your program saying i've

4762
01:27:25,030 --> 01:27:25,040
really come on your program saying i've
 

4763
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:27,990
really come on your program saying i've
done it i've achieved immortality right

4764
01:27:27,990 --> 01:27:28,000
done it i've achieved immortality right
 

4765
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,709
done it i've achieved immortality right
because it's never forever

4766
01:27:30,709 --> 01:27:30,719
because it's never forever
 

4767
01:27:30,719 --> 01:27:32,470
because it's never forever
um

4768
01:27:32,470 --> 01:27:32,480
um
 

4769
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:35,110
um
a long time a long time of living well

4770
01:27:35,110 --> 01:27:35,120
a long time a long time of living well
 

4771
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:37,669
a long time a long time of living well
but we'd like to actually advance human

4772
01:27:37,669 --> 01:27:37,679
but we'd like to actually advance human
 

4773
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:39,590
but we'd like to actually advance human
life expectancy advance my life

4774
01:27:39,590 --> 01:27:39,600
life expectancy advance my life
 

4775
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:40,950
life expectancy advance my life
expectancy

4776
01:27:40,950 --> 01:27:40,960
expectancy
 

4777
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:42,390
expectancy
more than a year

4778
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:42,400
more than a year
 

4779
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:43,750
more than a year
every year

4780
01:27:43,750 --> 01:27:43,760
every year
 

4781
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:45,750
every year
and i think we can get there within by

4782
01:27:45,750 --> 01:27:45,760
and i think we can get there within by
 

4783
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:47,590
and i think we can get there within by
the end of this decade

4784
01:27:47,590 --> 01:27:47,600
the end of this decade
 

4785
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:49,270
the end of this decade
how do you think we do it

4786
01:27:49,270 --> 01:27:49,280
how do you think we do it
 

4787
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:52,470
how do you think we do it
so there's practical things um

4788
01:27:52,470 --> 01:27:52,480
so there's practical things um
 

4789
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:54,790
so there's practical things um
and transcend the nine steps to living

4790
01:27:54,790 --> 01:27:54,800
and transcend the nine steps to living
 

4791
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:57,590
and transcend the nine steps to living
well forever your book you describe

4792
01:27:57,590 --> 01:27:57,600
well forever your book you describe
 

4793
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:59,590
well forever your book you describe
just that there's practical things like

4794
01:27:59,590 --> 01:27:59,600
just that there's practical things like
 

4795
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:00,390
just that there's practical things like
health

4796
01:28:00,390 --> 01:28:00,400
health
 

4797
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,950
health
exercise all those things yeah i mean we

4798
01:28:02,950 --> 01:28:02,960
exercise all those things yeah i mean we
 

4799
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:05,270
exercise all those things yeah i mean we
live in a body that doesn't

4800
01:28:05,270 --> 01:28:05,280
live in a body that doesn't
 

4801
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:06,629
live in a body that doesn't
last

4802
01:28:06,629 --> 01:28:06,639
last
 

4803
01:28:06,639 --> 01:28:08,070
last
forever

4804
01:28:08,070 --> 01:28:08,080
forever
 

4805
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:11,030
forever
there's no reason why it can't though

4806
01:28:11,030 --> 01:28:11,040
there's no reason why it can't though
 

4807
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:12,550
there's no reason why it can't though
and we're discovering things i think

4808
01:28:12,550 --> 01:28:12,560
and we're discovering things i think
 

4809
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:14,709
and we're discovering things i think
that will extend it

4810
01:28:14,709 --> 01:28:14,719
that will extend it
 

4811
01:28:14,719 --> 01:28:17,430
that will extend it
um

4812
01:28:17,430 --> 01:28:17,440

 

4813
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:19,590

but you do have to deal with i mean i've

4814
01:28:19,590 --> 01:28:19,600
but you do have to deal with i mean i've
 

4815
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:20,950
but you do have to deal with i mean i've
got various

4816
01:28:20,950 --> 01:28:20,960
got various
 

4817
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:23,030
got various
issues

4818
01:28:23,030 --> 01:28:23,040
issues
 

4819
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:25,590
issues
went to mexico

4820
01:28:25,590 --> 01:28:25,600
went to mexico
 

4821
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,430
went to mexico
40 years ago

4822
01:28:27,430 --> 01:28:27,440
40 years ago
 

4823
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:29,510
40 years ago
developed salmonella

4824
01:28:29,510 --> 01:28:29,520
developed salmonella
 

4825
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:32,310
developed salmonella
that created pancreatitis

4826
01:28:32,310 --> 01:28:32,320
that created pancreatitis
 

4827
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:37,270
that created pancreatitis
which gave me a strange form of diabetes

4828
01:28:37,270 --> 01:28:37,280

 

4829
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:39,910

it's not

4830
01:28:39,910 --> 01:28:39,920

 

4831
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:41,830

type 1 diabetes because that's an

4832
01:28:41,830 --> 01:28:41,840
type 1 diabetes because that's an
 

4833
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:44,070
type 1 diabetes because that's an
autoimmune disorder that destroys your

4834
01:28:44,070 --> 01:28:44,080
autoimmune disorder that destroys your
 

4835
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:46,550
autoimmune disorder that destroys your
pancreas i don't have that

4836
01:28:46,550 --> 01:28:46,560
pancreas i don't have that
 

4837
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:48,550
pancreas i don't have that
but it's also not type 2 diabetes

4838
01:28:48,550 --> 01:28:48,560
but it's also not type 2 diabetes
 

4839
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:51,030
but it's also not type 2 diabetes
because type 2 diabetes is your pancreas

4840
01:28:51,030 --> 01:28:51,040
because type 2 diabetes is your pancreas
 

4841
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:53,910
because type 2 diabetes is your pancreas
works fine but your cells don't absorb

4842
01:28:53,910 --> 01:28:53,920
works fine but your cells don't absorb
 

4843
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:55,590
works fine but your cells don't absorb
the insulin well

4844
01:28:55,590 --> 01:28:55,600
the insulin well
 

4845
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:58,229
the insulin well
i don't have that either

4846
01:28:58,229 --> 01:28:58,239
i don't have that either
 

4847
01:28:58,239 --> 01:29:01,510
i don't have that either
the pancreatitis i had

4848
01:29:01,510 --> 01:29:01,520
the pancreatitis i had
 

4849
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:03,830
the pancreatitis i had
partially damaged my

4850
01:29:03,830 --> 01:29:03,840
partially damaged my
 

4851
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:06,070
partially damaged my
pancreas but it was a one-time thing it

4852
01:29:06,070 --> 01:29:06,080
pancreas but it was a one-time thing it
 

4853
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:08,629
pancreas but it was a one-time thing it
didn't continue

4854
01:29:08,629 --> 01:29:08,639
didn't continue
 

4855
01:29:08,639 --> 01:29:11,350
didn't continue
and i've learned now how to control it

4856
01:29:11,350 --> 01:29:11,360
and i've learned now how to control it
 

4857
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:14,310
and i've learned now how to control it
but so that's just something i had to do

4858
01:29:14,310 --> 01:29:14,320
but so that's just something i had to do
 

4859
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:16,550
but so that's just something i had to do
uh in order to

4860
01:29:16,550 --> 01:29:16,560
uh in order to
 

4861
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:18,390
uh in order to
continue to exist

4862
01:29:18,390 --> 01:29:18,400
continue to exist
 

4863
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:20,229
continue to exist
it's your particular biological system

4864
01:29:20,229 --> 01:29:20,239
it's your particular biological system
 

4865
01:29:20,239 --> 01:29:22,390
it's your particular biological system
you have to figure out a few hacks

4866
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:22,400
you have to figure out a few hacks
 

4867
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,470
you have to figure out a few hacks
and the is that science would be yeah

4868
01:29:24,470 --> 01:29:24,480
and the is that science would be yeah
 

4869
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,310
and the is that science would be yeah
you have to do that much better actually

4870
01:29:26,310 --> 01:29:26,320
you have to do that much better actually
 

4871
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:27,189
you have to do that much better actually
yeah

4872
01:29:27,189 --> 01:29:27,199
yeah
 

4873
01:29:27,199 --> 01:29:29,189
yeah
so i mean i i do spend a lot of time

4874
01:29:29,189 --> 01:29:29,199
so i mean i i do spend a lot of time
 

4875
01:29:29,199 --> 01:29:31,270
so i mean i i do spend a lot of time
just tinkering with my own body to keep

4876
01:29:31,270 --> 01:29:31,280
just tinkering with my own body to keep
 

4877
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:33,430
just tinkering with my own body to keep
it going

4878
01:29:33,430 --> 01:29:33,440
it going
 

4879
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:35,510
it going
uh so i do think i'll

4880
01:29:35,510 --> 01:29:35,520
uh so i do think i'll
 

4881
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:36,390
uh so i do think i'll
last

4882
01:29:36,390 --> 01:29:36,400
last
 

4883
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:37,990
last
till the end of this decade and i think

4884
01:29:37,990 --> 01:29:38,000
till the end of this decade and i think
 

4885
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:41,510
till the end of this decade and i think
we'll achieve longevity escape velocity

4886
01:29:41,510 --> 01:29:41,520
we'll achieve longevity escape velocity
 

4887
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:43,510
we'll achieve longevity escape velocity
i think that we'll start with people who

4888
01:29:43,510 --> 01:29:43,520
i think that we'll start with people who
 

4889
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:45,990
i think that we'll start with people who
are very diligent about this

4890
01:29:45,990 --> 01:29:46,000
are very diligent about this
 

4891
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,830
are very diligent about this
eventually it'll become

4892
01:29:47,830 --> 01:29:47,840
eventually it'll become
 

4893
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:50,229
eventually it'll become
sort of routine that people will be able

4894
01:29:50,229 --> 01:29:50,239
sort of routine that people will be able
 

4895
01:29:50,239 --> 01:29:53,189
sort of routine that people will be able
to do it so if you're talking about

4896
01:29:53,189 --> 01:29:53,199
to do it so if you're talking about
 

4897
01:29:53,199 --> 01:29:55,669
to do it so if you're talking about
kids today or even people in their 20s

4898
01:29:55,669 --> 01:29:55,679
kids today or even people in their 20s
 

4899
01:29:55,679 --> 01:29:58,070
kids today or even people in their 20s
or 30s it's really not

4900
01:29:58,070 --> 01:29:58,080
or 30s it's really not
 

4901
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:01,110
or 30s it's really not
a very serious problem

4902
01:30:01,110 --> 01:30:01,120
a very serious problem
 

4903
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:04,310
a very serious problem
i have had some discussions with

4904
01:30:04,310 --> 01:30:04,320
i have had some discussions with
 

4905
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:06,390
i have had some discussions with
relatives who were

4906
01:30:06,390 --> 01:30:06,400
relatives who were
 

4907
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:08,790
relatives who were
like almost 100

4908
01:30:08,790 --> 01:30:08,800
like almost 100
 

4909
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:09,910
like almost 100
and

4910
01:30:09,910 --> 01:30:09,920
and
 

4911
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:11,189
and
saying well we're working on it as

4912
01:30:11,189 --> 01:30:11,199
saying well we're working on it as
 

4913
01:30:11,199 --> 01:30:13,189
saying well we're working on it as
quickly as possible then

4914
01:30:13,189 --> 01:30:13,199
quickly as possible then
 

4915
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:16,310
quickly as possible then
i don't know if that's gonna work

4916
01:30:16,310 --> 01:30:16,320
i don't know if that's gonna work
 

4917
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:17,830
i don't know if that's gonna work
is there a case this is a difficult

4918
01:30:17,830 --> 01:30:17,840
is there a case this is a difficult
 

4919
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:20,709
is there a case this is a difficult
question but is there a case to be made

4920
01:30:20,709 --> 01:30:20,719
question but is there a case to be made
 

4921
01:30:20,719 --> 01:30:21,910
question but is there a case to be made
against

4922
01:30:21,910 --> 01:30:21,920
against
 

4923
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:23,430
against
living forever

4924
01:30:23,430 --> 01:30:23,440
living forever
 

4925
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:25,030
living forever
that

4926
01:30:25,030 --> 01:30:25,040
that
 

4927
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:27,510
that
a finite life that mortality is a

4928
01:30:27,510 --> 01:30:27,520
a finite life that mortality is a
 

4929
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:29,430
a finite life that mortality is a
feature not a bug

4930
01:30:29,430 --> 01:30:29,440
feature not a bug
 

4931
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:30,629
feature not a bug
that that

4932
01:30:30,629 --> 01:30:30,639
that that
 

4933
01:30:30,639 --> 01:30:31,830
that that
living

4934
01:30:31,830 --> 01:30:31,840
living
 

4935
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:35,350
living
a shorter so dying makes

4936
01:30:35,350 --> 01:30:35,360
a shorter so dying makes
 

4937
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:37,510
a shorter so dying makes
ice cream taste delicious

4938
01:30:37,510 --> 01:30:37,520
ice cream taste delicious
 

4939
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:40,790
ice cream taste delicious
makes life intensely beautiful more than

4940
01:30:40,790 --> 01:30:40,800
makes life intensely beautiful more than
 

4941
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:41,750
makes life intensely beautiful more than
uh

4942
01:30:41,750 --> 01:30:41,760
uh
 

4943
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:44,709
uh
most people believe that weighing

4944
01:30:44,709 --> 01:30:44,719
most people believe that weighing
 

4945
01:30:44,719 --> 01:30:47,750
most people believe that weighing
except if you present a death of anybody

4946
01:30:47,750 --> 01:30:47,760
except if you present a death of anybody
 

4947
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:49,030
except if you present a death of anybody
they

4948
01:30:49,030 --> 01:30:49,040
they
 

4949
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:51,350
they
care about or love

4950
01:30:51,350 --> 01:30:51,360
care about or love
 

4951
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:55,110
care about or love
they find that extremely depressing

4952
01:30:55,110 --> 01:30:55,120
they find that extremely depressing
 

4953
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:58,310
they find that extremely depressing
and i know people who feel that way

4954
01:30:58,310 --> 01:30:58,320
and i know people who feel that way
 

4955
01:30:58,320 --> 01:30:59,590
and i know people who feel that way
20 30

4956
01:30:59,590 --> 01:30:59,600
20 30
 

4957
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:00,950
20 30
40

4958
01:31:00,950 --> 01:31:00,960
40
 

4959
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:06,070
40
years later they still want them back

4960
01:31:06,070 --> 01:31:06,080

 

4961
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:07,270

so i mean

4962
01:31:07,270 --> 01:31:07,280
so i mean
 

4963
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:09,110
so i mean
death is not

4964
01:31:09,110 --> 01:31:09,120
death is not
 

4965
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:11,669
death is not
something to celebrate

4966
01:31:11,669 --> 01:31:11,679
something to celebrate
 

4967
01:31:11,679 --> 01:31:12,550
something to celebrate
but

4968
01:31:12,550 --> 01:31:12,560
but
 

4969
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:14,470
but
we've lived in a world where people just

4970
01:31:14,470 --> 01:31:14,480
we've lived in a world where people just
 

4971
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:17,270
we've lived in a world where people just
accept this life is short you see it all

4972
01:31:17,270 --> 01:31:17,280
accept this life is short you see it all
 

4973
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:19,590
accept this life is short you see it all
the time on tv life's short you have to

4974
01:31:19,590 --> 01:31:19,600
the time on tv life's short you have to
 

4975
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:22,070
the time on tv life's short you have to
take advantage of it and nobody accepts

4976
01:31:22,070 --> 01:31:22,080
take advantage of it and nobody accepts
 

4977
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:23,910
take advantage of it and nobody accepts
the fact that you could actually go

4978
01:31:23,910 --> 01:31:23,920
