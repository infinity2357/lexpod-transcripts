00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:53,360
do that the earth
 

177
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,910
do that the earth
was flat okay well that's obviously an

178
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:55,920
was flat okay well that's obviously an
 

179
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,110
was flat okay well that's obviously an
erroneous belief

180
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:57,120
erroneous belief
 

181
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,229
erroneous belief
so beliefs can be wrong

182
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:00,239
so beliefs can be wrong
 

183
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,509
so beliefs can be wrong
now the bigger question that

184
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:01,519
now the bigger question that
 

185
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,949
now the bigger question that
philosophers ask is um is this belief

186
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:04,959
philosophers ask is um is this belief
 

187
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,309
philosophers ask is um is this belief
accurate toward

188
00:03:06,309 --> 00:03:06,319
accurate toward
 

189
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,949
accurate toward
what we consider to be objective reality

190
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:08,959
what we consider to be objective reality
 

191
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,030
what we consider to be objective reality
so now let me go to objective reality so

192
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,040
so now let me go to objective reality so
 

193
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,149
so now let me go to objective reality so
what is real

194
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:12,159
what is real
 

195
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,430
what is real
i don't think we can actually obtain

196
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:15,440
i don't think we can actually obtain
 

197
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,550
i don't think we can actually obtain
a correct understanding of what is real

198
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:18,560
a correct understanding of what is real
 

199
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,550
a correct understanding of what is real
and in that sense i have to refer to a

200
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:20,560
and in that sense i have to refer to a
 

201
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,589
and in that sense i have to refer to a
philosopher again

202
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:21,599
philosopher again
 

203
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,509
philosopher again
and that would be emmanuel kant so

204
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:23,519
and that would be emmanuel kant so
 

205
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,110
and that would be emmanuel kant so
emmanuel kant is

206
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,120
emmanuel kant is
 

207
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,630
emmanuel kant is
one of the he was uh

208
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:28,640
one of the he was uh
 

209
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,630
one of the he was uh
basically in the 1750s he wrote

210
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:30,640
basically in the 1750s he wrote
 

211
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,390
basically in the 1750s he wrote
critiques of reason and things like that

212
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:32,400
critiques of reason and things like that
 

213
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,149
critiques of reason and things like that
so he said well if you're a philosopher

214
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:34,159
so he said well if you're a philosopher
 

215
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,309
so he said well if you're a philosopher
or have any kind of understanding of

216
00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:36,319
or have any kind of understanding of
 

217
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,070
or have any kind of understanding of
western history you know who he is

218
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:38,080
western history you know who he is
 

219
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,270
western history you know who he is
um he had this idea that we can actually

220
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:41,280
um he had this idea that we can actually
 

221
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,110
um he had this idea that we can actually
never get to the thing in

222
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:43,120
never get to the thing in
 

223
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,110
never get to the thing in
itself okay so he called that the

224
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:45,120
itself okay so he called that the
 

225
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,789
itself okay so he called that the
numenol the thing in itself

226
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:46,799
numenol the thing in itself
 

227
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,710
numenol the thing in itself
he said this let's take this table for

228
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:48,720
he said this let's take this table for
 

229
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,390
he said this let's take this table for
instance that you and i are talking

230
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:50,400
instance that you and i are talking
 

231
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,110
instance that you and i are talking
across

232
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,120
across
 

233
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,429
across
so this thing is a table you and i both

234
00:03:53,429 --> 00:03:53,439
so this thing is a table you and i both
 

235
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,149
so this thing is a table you and i both
know that

236
00:03:54,149 --> 00:03:54,159
know that
 

237
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,309
know that
we assume it's real we believe in it

238
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:56,319
we assume it's real we believe in it
 

239
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,229
we assume it's real we believe in it
because we put our water on it and our

240
00:03:58,229 --> 00:03:58,239
because we put our water on it and our
 

241
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,070
because we put our water on it and our
water stays on it okay

242
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,080
water stays on it okay
 

243
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,949
water stays on it okay
um however can we know this thing um in

244
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:02,959
um however can we know this thing um in
 

245
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,869
um however can we know this thing um in
and of itself as a table

246
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:04,879
and of itself as a table
 

247
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,990
and of itself as a table
um so that would be what he then would

248
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,000
um so that would be what he then would
 

249
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,710
um so that would be what he then would
call

250
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:08,720
call
 

251
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,350
call
um the phenomenal how do we know that

252
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:11,360
um the phenomenal how do we know that
 

253
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,429
um the phenomenal how do we know that
that phenomena exists

254
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:13,439
that phenomena exists
 

255
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,629
that phenomena exists
as we know it is okay how do we know

256
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:16,639
as we know it is okay how do we know
 

257
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,150

00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:37,600
physics as a basis for understanding
 

341
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:37,990
physics as a basis for understanding
what

342
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:38,000
what
 

343
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,230
what
we can know about what is real and what

344
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:40,240
we can know about what is real and what
 

345
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,029
we can know about what is real and what
is real

346
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:41,039
is real
 

347
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,830
is real
is really difficult to pin down and so

348
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:43,840
is really difficult to pin down and so
 

349
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,749
is really difficult to pin down and so
your question is what is belief

350
00:05:45,749 --> 00:05:45,759
your question is what is belief
 

351
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,990
your question is what is belief
well belief does it correspond to

352
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,000
well belief does it correspond to
 

353
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,150
well belief does it correspond to
reality that's the question i would ask

354
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:50,160
reality that's the question i would ask
 

355
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,230
reality that's the question i would ask
and first we don't even know what is

356
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:52,240
and first we don't even know what is
 

357
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,150
and first we don't even know what is
real so the table they would say how do

358
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,160
real so the table they would say how do
 

359
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,230
real so the table they would say how do
we know that the table even exists well

360
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:56,240
we know that the table even exists well
 

361
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,830
we know that the table even exists well
how do we differentiate it from the

362
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:57,840
how do we differentiate it from the
 

363
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,830
how do we differentiate it from the
floor for example so these are the

364
00:05:59,830 --> 00:05:59,840
floor for example so these are the
 

365
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,590
floor for example so these are the
questions that philosophers are asking

366
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:01,600
questions that philosophers are asking
 

367
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,110
questions that philosophers are asking
no one else is of course but

368
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,120
no one else is of course but
 

369
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,029
no one else is of course but
philosophers are asking these questions

370
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:05,039
philosophers are asking these questions
 

371
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,309
philosophers are asking these questions
and they have different answers for it

372
00:06:06,309 --> 00:06:06,319
and they have different answers for it
 

373
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,629
and they have different answers for it
so i would say that it's very difficult

374
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:08,639
so i would say that it's very difficult
 

375
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,350
so i would say that it's very difficult
to know

376
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:09,360
to know
 

377
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,189
to know
what is real and in fact what i do

378
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:11,199
what is real and in fact what i do
 

379
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,950
what is real and in fact what i do
usually is i

380
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:12,960
usually is i
 

381
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,909
usually is i

and so he says this he's a very smart

392
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:25,280
and so he says this he's a very smart
 

393
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,189
and so he says this he's a very smart
person he says well

truth is a moving target you know so

396
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:30,400
truth is a moving target you know so
 

397
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,990
truth is a moving target you know so
so basically to know what is

398
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,000
so basically to know what is
 

399
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,990
so basically to know what is
real out there like gravity or something

400
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,000
real out there like gravity or something
 

401
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,710
real out there like gravity or something
like that you've got to approximate it

402
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:38,720
like that you've got to approximate it
 

403
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,430
like that you've got to approximate it
and as human beings you know we have um

404
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:41,440
and as human beings you know we have um
 

405
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,230
and as human beings you know we have um
senses

406
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:42,240
senses
 

407
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,110
senses
to tell us what at least so we don't get

408
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,120
to tell us what at least so we don't get
 

409
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,390
to tell us what at least so we don't get
hurt you know we're not going to fall

410
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:46,400
hurt you know we're not going to fall
 

411
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,430
hurt you know we're not going to fall
off

412
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:47,440
off
 

413
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,790
off
building or something like that we have

414
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:48,800
building or something like that we have
 

415
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,550
building or something like that we have
eyes to see and things like that so

416
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:50,560
eyes to see and things like that so
 

417
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,710
eyes to see and things like that so
we can approximate what reality is but

418
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:52,720
we can approximate what reality is but
 

419
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,670
we can approximate what reality is but
we're never going to get

420
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:53,680
we're never going to get
 

421
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,990
we're never going to get
to it um unless we develop better senses

422
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:58,000
to it um unless we develop better senses
 

423
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,550
to it um unless we develop better senses
okay

424
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:58,560
okay
 

425
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,469
okay
and i think that that is what we are in

426
00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:00,479
and i think that that is what we are in
 

427
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,230
and i think that that is what we are in
the process of doing we're developing

428
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:02,240
the process of doing we're developing
 

429
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,270
the process of doing we're developing
better senses

430
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:03,280
better senses
 

431
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,350
better senses
we have telescopes we have microscopes

432
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:05,360
we have telescopes we have microscopes
 

433
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,589
we have telescopes we have microscopes
we have you know extensions of ourselves

434
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:07,599
we have you know extensions of ourselves
 

435
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,749
we have you know extensions of ourselves
which are now called technology and we

436
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:09,759
which are now called technology and we
 

437
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,510
which are now called technology and we
can get to

438
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:11,520
can get to
 

439
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,749
can get to
a better understanding of what reality

440
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:13,759
a better understanding of what reality
 

441
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,990
a better understanding of what reality
is and what the objective world is and

442
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,000
is and what the objective world is and
 

443
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,230
is and what the objective world is and
therefore our beliefs can be honed

444
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:18,240
therefore our beliefs can be honed
 

445
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,749
therefore our beliefs can be honed
so we can get better beliefs more

446
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:19,759
so we can get better beliefs more
 

447
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,589
so we can get better beliefs more
accurate beliefs but can we get beliefs

448
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:21,599
accurate beliefs but can we get beliefs
 

449
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,830
accurate beliefs but can we get beliefs
that actually correspond to reality

450
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:23,840
that actually correspond to reality
 

451
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,029
that actually correspond to reality
um not in any precise way

452
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:27,039
um not in any precise way
 

453
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,350
um not in any precise way
but in approximate ways so i hope that's

454
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:29,360
but in approximate ways so i hope that's
 

455
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,469
but in approximate ways so i hope that's
not like too

456
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:30,479
not like too
 

457
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,230
not like too
big an answer to your question what do

458
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:32,240
big an answer to your question what do
 

459
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,150
big an answer to your question what do
you think beliefs are in themselves can

460
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:34,160
you think beliefs are in themselves can
 

461
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,270
you think beliefs are in themselves can
become reality

462
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:35,280
become reality
 

463
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,510
become reality
i mean so you've now adapted the

464
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:39,520
i mean so you've now adapted the
 

465
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,830
i mean so you've now adapted the
in this little bit of a conversation

466
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:41,840
in this little bit of a conversation
 

467
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,710
in this little bit of a conversation
adapted the

468
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:42,720
adapted the
 

469
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,790
adapted the
metaphysician view of reality which is

470
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:44,800
metaphysician view of reality which is
 

471
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,749
metaphysician view of reality which is
the physics

472
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:45,759
the physics
 

473
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,469
the physics
yes but you know we humans kind of

474
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:48,479
yes but you know we humans kind of
 

475
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,150
yes but you know we humans kind of
operate in the space of ideas

476
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,160
operate in the space of ideas
 

477
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,110
operate in the space of ideas
very much so like we've kind of in the

478
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:53,120
very much so like we've kind of in the
 

479
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,790
very much so like we've kind of in the
collective intelligence of human beings

480
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:54,800
collective intelligence of human beings
 

481
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,589
collective intelligence of human beings
have come up with a set of ideas that

482
00:07:57,589 --> 00:07:57,599
have come up with a set of ideas that
 

483
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,270
have come up with a set of ideas that
persist in the minds of these many

484
00:07:59,270 --> 00:07:59,280
persist in the minds of these many
 

485
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,029
persist in the minds of these many
people and they become quite

486
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:01,039
people and they become quite
 

487
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,270
people and they become quite
strong and powerful like in terms of

488
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:03,280
strong and powerful like in terms of
 

489
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,430
strong and powerful like in terms of
like impact on our lives

490
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:05,440
like impact on our lives
 

491
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,029
like impact on our lives
they can have sometimes more impact than

492
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:09,039
they can have sometimes more impact than
 

493
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,029
they can have sometimes more impact than
this table does than the physics yeah

494
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:13,039
this table does than the physics yeah
 

495
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,390
this table does than the physics yeah
and in that sense is is there some sense

496
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:16,400
and in that sense is is there some sense
 

497
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,070
and in that sense is is there some sense
in which our beliefs

498
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,080
in which our beliefs
 

499
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,629
in which our beliefs
are reality even if they're not

500
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:20,639
are reality even if they're not
 

501
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,749
are reality even if they're not
connected to

502
00:08:21,749 --> 00:08:21,759
connected to
 

503
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,670
connected to

purgatory yeah anyway so limbo is a
 

673
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,590
purgatory yeah anyway so limbo is a
distinct thing from purgatory

674
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:55,600
distinct thing from purgatory
 

675
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,790
distinct thing from purgatory
yeah and the the the types of people who

to limbo happen to be virtuous pagans
okay like socrates or somebody like that

00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:06,399
okay like socrates or somebody like that
 

683
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,509
okay like socrates or somebody like that
um

684
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:07,519
um
 

685
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,069
um
and children who weren't baptized so

686
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:10,079
and children who weren't baptized so
 

687
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,350
and children who weren't baptized so
think of this

688
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:11,360
think of this
 

689
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,269
think of this
think of for that like more than a

690
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:13,279
think of for that like more than a
 

691
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,630
think of for that like more than a
thousand years

692
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:14,640
thousand years
 

693
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,910
thousand years
mothers and fathers gave birth to babies

694
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:17,920
mothers and fathers gave birth to babies
 

695
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,590
mothers and fathers gave birth to babies
who weren't baptized

696
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:19,600
who weren't baptized
 

697
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,069
who weren't baptized
and couldn't be buried with their family

698
00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:22,079
and couldn't be buried with their family
 

699
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:22,870
and couldn't be buried with their family
in these

700
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:22,880
in these
 

701
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,230
in these
burial and you know they then they

702
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:24,240
burial and you know they then they
 

703
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,310
burial and you know they then they
couldn't be reunited with them in heaven

704
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:26,320
couldn't be reunited with them in heaven
 

705
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,990
couldn't be reunited with them in heaven
think of the pain as suffering that that

706
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,000
think of the pain as suffering that that
 

707
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,430
think of the pain as suffering that that
caused and that was

708
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:29,440
caused and that was
 

709
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,870
caused and that was
nothing limbo's nothing yet the belief

710
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:32,880
nothing limbo's nothing yet the belief
 

711
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,590
nothing limbo's nothing yet the belief
in it

712
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:33,600
in it
 

713
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,990
in it
caused untold suffering and that's just

714
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:36,000
caused untold suffering and that's just
 

715
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,030
caused untold suffering and that's just
a small example

716
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:37,040
a small example
 

717
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,509
a small example
and that was as real to them it was

718
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:39,519
and that was as real to them it was
 

719
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,710
and that was as real to them it was
absolutely real

720
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:40,720
absolutely real
 

721
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,069
absolutely real
i mean the effects were real let's put

722
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:42,079
i mean the effects were real let's put
 

723
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,990
i mean the effects were real let's put
it that way the place itself

724
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:44,000
it that way the place itself
 

725
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,990
it that way the place itself
not real but the families themselves do

726
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:46,000
not real but the families themselves do
 

727
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,670
not real but the families themselves do
you think they really believed it

728
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:47,680
you think they really believed it
 

729
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,230
you think they really believed it
they totally believed it the table is

730
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:50,240
they totally believed it the table is
 

731
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:50,710
they totally believed it the table is
real

732
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:50,720
real

745
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,190
warnings okay
so you're going through like you know

746
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:03,200
so you're going through like you know
 

747
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,110
so you're going through like you know
somebody's diary from

748
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:05,120
somebody's diary from
 

749
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,990
somebody's diary from
1400 and you hear the suffering and pain

750
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,000
1400 and you hear the suffering and pain
 

751
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,949
1400 and you hear the suffering and pain
that they went through

752
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:08,959
that they went through
 

753
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,629
that they went through
there were times in my research where

754
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:10,639
there were times in my research where
 

755
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,990
there were times in my research where
i'd have to put

756
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:12,000
i'd have to put
 

757
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,790
i'd have to put
my primary source down you know and just

758
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:14,800
my primary source down you know and just
 

759
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,870
my primary source down you know and just
basically go outside and take a walk

760
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:16,880
basically go outside and take a walk
 

761
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,870
basically go outside and take a walk
because it was so horrific i knew it was

762
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:18,880
because it was so horrific i knew it was
 

763
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,470
because it was so horrific i knew it was
true because they wouldn't write

764
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:20,480
true because they wouldn't write
 

765
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,310
true because they wouldn't write
something you know they're not gonna

766
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:22,320
something you know they're not gonna
 

767
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,590
something you know they're not gonna
write in their diary something that's

768
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:23,600
write in their diary something that's
 

769
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,269
write in their diary something that's
not true and it was horrible so yes

770
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:25,279
not true and it was horrible so yes
 

771
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,150
not true and it was horrible so yes
these people went through

772
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:26,160
these people went through
 

773
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,629
these people went through
untold suffering for nothing for you

774
00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:28,639
untold suffering for nothing for you
 

775
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,230
untold suffering for nothing for you
know because they had an erroneous

776
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:30,240
know because they had an erroneous
 

777
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:30,870
know because they had an erroneous
belief

778
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:30,880
belief
 

779
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,710
belief
but they didn't know it was erroneous so

780
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:32,720
but they didn't know it was erroneous so
 

781
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,790
but they didn't know it was erroneous so
it's real to them yeah

782
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:34,800
it's real to them yeah
 

783
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,150
it's real to them yeah
uh so i don't know if you're familiar

784
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:36,160
uh so i don't know if you're familiar
 

785
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,990
uh so i don't know if you're familiar
with donald hoffman

786
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:38,000
with donald hoffman
 

787
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,470
with donald hoffman
he has uh this idea that in terms of

788
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:42,480
he has uh this idea that in terms of
 

789
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,030
he has uh this idea that in terms of
uh the distance we are from being able

790
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,040
uh the distance we are from being able
 

791
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,269
uh the distance we are from being able
to know the reality which is there

792
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:47,279
to know the reality which is there
 

793
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,590
to know the reality which is there
the physics reality is we're actually

794
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:49,600
the physics reality is we're actually
 

795
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,590
the physics reality is we're actually
really really really really far away

796
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:51,600
really really really really far away
 

797
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,230
really really really really far away
from that

798
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:52,240
from that
 

799
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,670
from that
yeah so like it's uh i think his idea is

800
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:55,680
yeah so like it's uh i think his idea is
 

801
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,710
yeah so like it's uh i think his idea is
that

802
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:56,720
that
 

803
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,110
that
we're basically like completely detached

804
00:12:59,110 --> 00:12:59,120
we're basically like completely detached
 

805
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,990
we're basically like completely detached
from it

806
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:00,000
from it
 

807
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,710
from it
yes uh what what's your sense how close

808
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:02,720
yes uh what what's your sense how close
 

809
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,150
yes uh what what's your sense how close
are we to the reality

810
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,160
are we to the reality
 

811
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,030
are we to the reality
we'll talk about him a bunch of ideas

812
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:07,040
we'll talk about him a bunch of ideas
 

813
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,430
we'll talk about him a bunch of ideas
about

814
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:07,440
about
 

815
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,670
about
our beliefs in technology and and beyond

816
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:11,680
our beliefs in technology and and beyond
 

817
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,949
our beliefs in technology and and beyond
uh but in terms of what is actually real

818
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:14,959
uh but in terms of what is actually real
 

819
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,030
uh but in terms of what is actually real
from a physical sense how close are we

820
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:17,040
from a physical sense how close are we
 

821
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,310
from a physical sense how close are we
to understanding that

822
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:18,320
to understanding that
 

823
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,150
to understanding that
pretty far i'm going to use examples

824
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:20,160
pretty far i'm going to use examples
 

825
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,670
pretty far i'm going to use examples
from what i do

826
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:21,680
from what i do
 

827
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,190
from what i do
okay so this idea that

828
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:25,200

 

829
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,670

we're suspicious of what we actually

830
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:27,680
we're suspicious of what we actually
 

831
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,949
we're suspicious of what we actually
think is real

832
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:28,959
think is real
 

833

generally if they push though i say you
 

859
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,110
generally if they push though i say you
know i'm the chair of philosophy and

860
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:57,120
know i'm the chair of philosophy and
 

861
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:57,750
know i'm the chair of philosophy and
religion

862

although i stepped down last year so i'm

864
00:13:59,590 --> 00:13:59,600
although i stepped down last year so i'm
 

865
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,790
although i stepped down last year so i'm
no longer the chair

866
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:00,800
no longer the chair
 

867
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,269
no longer the chair
but um i i've i have like a master's

868
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:03,279
but um i i've i have like a master's
 

869
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,389
but um i i've i have like a master's
degree in philosophy and i was a

870
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:04,399
degree in philosophy and i was a
 

871
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,990
degree in philosophy and i was a
philosophy major and i've studied a lot

872
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:06,000
philosophy major and i've studied a lot
 

873
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,550
philosophy major and i've studied a lot
i still

874
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:06,560
i still
 

875
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,710
i still
study philosophy so i integrated into my

876
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:08,720
study philosophy so i integrated into my
 

877
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,590
study philosophy so i integrated into my
research

878
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:09,600
research
 

879
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,710
research
um all right so this idea that

880
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:12,720
um all right so this idea that
 

881
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,030
um all right so this idea that
we can't know uh we're suspicious of

882
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:15,040
we can't know uh we're suspicious of
 

883
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,230
we can't know uh we're suspicious of
what we know it's called

884
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:16,240
what we know it's called
 

885
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,870
what we know it's called
external world skepticism that's the

886
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:18,880
external world skepticism that's the
 

887
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,870
external world skepticism that's the
official philosophical name for it

888
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:20,880
official philosophical name for it
 

889
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,350
official philosophical name for it
um our faculties and our senses don't

890
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:23,360
um our faculties and our senses don't
 

891
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,509
um our faculties and our senses don't
give us accurate perceptions

892
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:25,519
give us accurate perceptions
 

893
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,629
give us accurate perceptions
of what is there okay especially at a

894
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:28,639
of what is there okay especially at a
 

895
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,389
of what is there okay especially at a
quantum level or a molecular

896
00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:30,399
quantum level or a molecular
 

897
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,949
quantum level or a molecular
level i mean that's just obvious so yes

898
00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:32,959
level i mean that's just obvious so yes
 

899
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,310
level i mean that's just obvious so yes
so i think that you're

900
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:34,320
so i think that you're
 

901
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,150
so i think that you're
the person you mentioned is correct in

that i think we're far away from it

904
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:38,320
that i think we're far away from it
 

905
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,230
that i think we're far away from it
i think you're talking about our direct

906
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:40,240
i think you're talking about our direct
 

907
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,110
i think you're talking about our direct
senses but you know we have tools

908
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:43,120
senses but you know we have tools
 

909
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,470
senses but you know we have tools
measurement tools from microscopes to

910
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:46,480
measurement tools from microscopes to
 

911
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,910
measurement tools from microscopes to
all the tools of astronomy cosmology

912
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:49,920
all the tools of astronomy cosmology
 

913
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,910
all the tools of astronomy cosmology
it gives us a sense of the big universe

914
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:51,920
it gives us a sense of the big universe
 

915
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,870
it gives us a sense of the big universe
and also the sense of the very small

916
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:54,880
and also the sense of the very small
 

917
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,430
and also the sense of the very small
do you think there's some other things

918

do you think there's some other things
 

919
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,670

that are completely sort of
 

921
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,350
that are completely sort of
other dimensions or

922
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:03,360
other dimensions or
 

923
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,350
other dimensions or
there's ideas of pan psychism that

924
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:05,360
there's ideas of pan psychism that
 

925
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,670
there's ideas of pan psychism that
consciousness permeates all matter

926
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:07,680
consciousness permeates all matter
 

927
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,389
consciousness permeates all matter
that that's there's like fundamental

928
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:10,399
that that's there's like fundamental
 

929
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,150
that that's there's like fundamental
forces of physics we're not even

930
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:12,160
forces of physics we're not even
 

931
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,269
forces of physics we're not even
aware of yet like oh absolutely

932
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:15,279
aware of yet like oh absolutely
 

933
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,269
aware of yet like oh absolutely
i do think and this is why i write about

934
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:17,279
i do think and this is why i write about
 

935
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,470
i do think and this is why i write about
technology and

936
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:18,480
technology and
 

937
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,750
technology and
um i i mean that's actually what i

938
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:21,760
um i i mean that's actually what i
 

939
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,710
um i i mean that's actually what i
specialize in

940
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:22,720
specialize in
 

941
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,030
specialize in
is belief in technology with respect to

942
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:25,040
is belief in technology with respect to
 

943
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:25,990
is belief in technology with respect to
religion

944

so in my opinion thank
 

947
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,949
so in my opinion thank
goodness for think for technology

948
00:15:30,949 --> 00:15:30,959
goodness for think for technology
 

949
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,790
goodness for think for technology
because where would we be without it i

950
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:32,800
because where would we be without it i
 

951
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,310
because where would we be without it i
mean frankly i think that

952
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:34,320
mean frankly i think that
 

953
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,350
mean frankly i think that
it's like marshall mcluhan was the

954
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:37,360
it's like marshall mcluhan was the
 

955
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,949
it's like marshall mcluhan was the
person who said

956
00:15:38,949 --> 00:15:38,959
person who said
 

957
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,430
person who said
technology is like an extension of our

958
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:41,440
technology is like an extension of our
 

959
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,310
technology is like an extension of our
senses

960
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:42,320
senses
 

961
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,310
senses
and i absolutely believe that to be true

962
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:44,320
and i absolutely believe that to be true
 

963
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,910
and i absolutely believe that to be true
i think that we're lucky

964
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:45,920
i think that we're lucky
 

965
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,870
i think that we're lucky
that we you know that prometheus gave us

966
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:48,880
that we you know that prometheus gave us
 

967
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,230
that we you know that prometheus gave us
technology okay

968
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:50,240
technology okay
 

969
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,389
technology okay
and that we use it and we're making it

970
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:52,399
and that we use it and we're making it
 

971
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,389
and that we use it and we're making it
better and better and better and better

972
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:54,399
better and better and better and better
 

973
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,189
better and better and better and better
and that makes us more efficient it

974
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:57,199
and that makes us more efficient it
 

975
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,310
and that makes us more efficient it
makes us more efficient as a species

976
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:00,320
makes us more efficient as a species
 

977
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,350
makes us more efficient as a species
and like my point is

978
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:03,360
and like my point is
 

979
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,069
and like my point is
is that i think that our instruments i

980
00:16:08,069 --> 00:16:08,079
is that i think that our instruments i
 

981
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:08,389
is that i think that our instruments i
mean

982
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:08,399
mean
 

983
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,389
mean
i don't want to be a religious

984
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:10,399
i don't want to be a religious
 

985
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,749
i don't want to be a religious
technologist you know

986
00:16:11,749 --> 00:16:11,759
technologist you know
 

987
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,990
technologist you know
but our our uh our instruments will save

988
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:16,000
but our our uh our instruments will save
 

989
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,310
but our our uh our instruments will save
us

990
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:16,320
us
 

991
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,990
us
i mean they're already making life

992
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,000
i mean they're already making life
 

993
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,829
i mean they're already making life
better for us you think it's important

994
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:19,839
better for us you think it's important
 

995
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,430
better for us you think it's important
that they also help us understand

996

that's a cool picture of shoes right and

1178
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:18,799
that's a cool picture of shoes right and
 

1179
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:19,669
that's a cool picture of shoes right and
so why

00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:19,679
so why
 

1181
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,110
so why
you know the question is why is that a

1182
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:21,120
you know the question is why is that a
 

1183
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,029
you know the question is why is that a
cool picture of shoes you know what kind

1184
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:23,039
cool picture of shoes you know what kind
 

1185
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:23,430
cool picture of shoes you know what kind
of

1186
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:23,440
of
 

1187
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,310
of
knowledge are we accessing to determine

1188
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:26,320
knowledge are we accessing to determine
 

1189
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:26,870
knowledge are we accessing to determine
that

1190
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:26,880
that
 

1191
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,430
that
indeed that that works right and in fact

1192
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:29,440
indeed that that works right and in fact
 

1193
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,549
indeed that that works right and in fact
we still like it

1194
00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:30,559
we still like it
 

1195
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,789
we still like it
so basically the the nature of knowledge

1196
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:32,799
so basically the the nature of knowledge
 

1197
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,390
so basically the the nature of knowledge
and what does it represent

1198
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:34,400
and what does it represent
 

1199
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,470
and what does it represent
it can operate in the space of that's

1200
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:36,480
it can operate in the space of that's
 

1201
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,750
it can operate in the space of that's
detached from reality

1202
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:37,760
detached from reality
 

1203
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,510
detached from reality
or can it ultimately represent reality

1204
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:41,520
or can it ultimately represent reality
 

1205
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,990
or can it ultimately represent reality
i guess that's the is that that's the

1206
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:44,000
i guess that's the is that that's the
 

1207
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,350
i guess that's the is that that's the
space of metaphysics

1208
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:45,360
space of metaphysics
 

1209
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,750
space of metaphysics
is that is that yeah so what can we know

1210
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:47,760
is that is that yeah so what can we know
 

1211
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,830
is that is that yeah so what can we know
is actually called epistemology

1212
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:49,840
is actually called epistemology
 

1213
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,350
is actually called epistemology
but metaphysics is is basically

1214
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:53,360
but metaphysics is is basically
 

1215
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,669
but metaphysics is is basically
what is the nature of reality right and

1216
00:19:55,669 --> 00:19:55,679
what is the nature of reality right and
 

1217
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,270
what is the nature of reality right and
those intersect

1218
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:57,280
those intersect
 

1219
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,870
those intersect
absolutely yeah a lot of things

1220
00:19:58,870 --> 00:19:58,880
absolutely yeah a lot of things
 

1221
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,710
absolutely yeah a lot of things
intersect in philosophy we just have

1222
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:00,720
intersect in philosophy we just have
 

1223
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,630
intersect in philosophy we just have
fancy names for them another

1224
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:03,640
fancy names for them another
 

1225
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,510
fancy names for them another
non-philosopher

1226
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:05,520
non-philosopher
 

1227
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,750
non-philosopher
that may be considered a philosopher

1228
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:07,760
that may be considered a philosopher
 

1229
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,750
that may be considered a philosopher
since we're talking about reality is ayn

1230
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:09,760
since we're talking about reality is ayn

since we're talking about reality is ayn
rand

1232
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:10,320
rand
 

1233
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,830
rand
and her philosophy of objectivism

1234
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:13,840
and her philosophy of objectivism
 

1235
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,430
and her philosophy of objectivism
what are your thoughts on her sense

1236
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:17,440
what are your thoughts on her sense
 

1237
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,710
what are your thoughts on her sense
of taking this idea of reality calling

1238
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:20,720
of taking this idea of reality calling
 

1239
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,789
of taking this idea of reality calling
her philosophy objectivism

1240
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:22,799
her philosophy objectivism
 

1241
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:27,110
her philosophy objectivism
and uh kind of starting at the idea that

1242
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,120
and uh kind of starting at the idea that
 

1243
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,230
and uh kind of starting at the idea that
you really could know everything and

1244
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:30,240
you really could know everything and
 

1245
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,310
you really could know everything and
it's pretty obvious

1246
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:32,320
it's pretty obvious
 

1247
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,789
it's pretty obvious
and then from that you can derive an

1248
00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:34,799
and then from that you can derive an
 

1249
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,270
and then from that you can derive an
ethics about how to live life

1250
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:37,280
ethics about how to live life
 

1251
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,909
ethics about how to live life
like what is the what is the good

like what is the what is the good
 

1253
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,510
like what is the what is the good
ethical life and all

1254
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:41,520
ethical life and all
 

1255
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,190
ethical life and all
the virtue of selfishness all that kind

1256
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:43,200
the virtue of selfishness all that kind
 

1257
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,270
the virtue of selfishness all that kind
of stuff uh

1258
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:45,280
of stuff uh
 

1259
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,789
of stuff uh
so you talk to a lot of academic

1260
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:46,799
so you talk to a lot of academic
 

1261
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,630
so you talk to a lot of academic
philosophers so i'd be curious to see

1262
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:48,640
philosophers so i'd be curious to see
 

1263
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,430

ein rand okay so in one one sense you
 

1383
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,750
ein rand okay so in one one sense you
could say

1384
00:22:59,750 --> 00:22:59,760
could say
 

1385
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,190
could say
that because they don't teach her

1386
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:01,200
that because they don't teach her
 

1387

teach
 

1391
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,149
teach
or very particular perhaps is another

1392
00:23:06,149 --> 00:23:06,159
or very particular perhaps is another
 

1393
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:07,350
or very particular perhaps is another
way to put it

1394
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:07,360
way to put it
 

1395
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,789
way to put it
yeah it's hard to know where to place

1396
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:08,799
yeah it's hard to know where to place
 

1397

real yeah now what's interesting is that
 

1665
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,070
real yeah now what's interesting is that
um people like plato who lived thousands

1666
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:56,080
um people like plato who lived thousands
 

1667
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,110
um people like plato who lived thousands
of years ago 2

1668
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:57,120
of years ago 2
 

1669
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,070
of years ago 2
500 about um basically made this

1670
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:00,080
500 about um basically made this
 

1671
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,990
500 about um basically made this
distinction himself within his

1672
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:02,000
distinction himself within his
 

1673
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,110
distinction himself within his
own culture which was greek right

1674
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:05,120
own culture which was greek right
 

1675
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,190
own culture which was greek right

1676
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:07,200
so plato's a very famous greek
 

1677
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,230
so plato's a very famous greek
philosopher

1678

philosopher
 

1679
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,750
philosopher
and he would say things like this he

1680
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:09,760
and he would say things like this he
 

1681
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,389
and he would say things like this he
would say that um

1682
00:28:12,389 --> 00:28:12,399
would say that um
 

1683
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,230
would say that um
he would make a distinction between the

1684
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:14,240
he would make a distinction between the
 

1685
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,510
he would make a distinction between the
reality

1686
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:15,520
reality
 

1687
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,549
reality
of the one god or the one he would call

1688
00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:18,559
of the one god or the one he would call
 

1689
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:19,029
of the one god or the one he would call
it

1690
00:28:19,029 --> 00:28:19,039
it
 

1691
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,590
it
he didn't call use the word god but he's

1692
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:21,600
he didn't call use the word god but he's
 

1693
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,669
he didn't call use the word god but he's
referencing a divinity of

1694
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:23,679
referencing a divinity of
 

1695
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,110
referencing a divinity of
okay and he believes in the soul okay

1696
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:27,120
okay and he believes in the soul okay
 

1697
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,310
okay and he believes in the soul okay
so but he would also say that the gods

1698
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:30,320
so but he would also say that the gods
 

1699
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,990
so but he would also say that the gods
and goddesses of the greeks are just

1700
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:32,000
and goddesses of the greeks are just
 

1701
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,110
and goddesses of the greeks are just
myths

1702
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:33,120
myths
 

1703
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,190
myths
so even he would make that distinction

1704
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:35,200
so even he would make that distinction
 

1705
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,310
so even he would make that distinction
again you know

1706
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:36,320
again you know
 

1707
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,029
again you know
he would say the population is not too

1708
00:28:39,029 --> 00:28:39,039
he would say the population is not too
 

1709
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,389
he would say the population is not too
bright so they believe in

1710
00:28:40,389 --> 00:28:40,399
bright so they believe in
 

1711
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,190
bright so they believe in
these gods and goddesses but he himself

1712
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:43,200
these gods and goddesses but he himself
 

1713
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:43,990
these gods and goddesses but he himself
is talking to

1714
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:44,000
is talking to
 

1715
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,230
is talking to
his students and he's basically talking

1716
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:46,240
his students and he's basically talking
 

1717
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,269
his students and he's basically talking
about

1718
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:47,279
about
 

1719
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,830
about
forms you know so you know there that

1720
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:49,840
forms you know so you know there that
 

1721
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,630
forms you know so you know there that
live and

1722
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:50,640
live and
 

1723
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,630
live and
seem to live in these other dimensions

1724
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:52,640
seem to live in these other dimensions
 

1725
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,990
seem to live in these other dimensions
like this table let's go back to this

1726
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:54,000
like this table let's go back to this
 

1727
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,430
like this table let's go back to this
table that we're talking

1728
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:55,440
table that we're talking
 

1729
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,830
table that we're talking
um around right now he would say that

1730
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:57,840
um around right now he would say that
 

1731
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,830
um around right now he would say that
this table is the instantiation of the

1732
00:28:59,830 --> 00:28:59,840
this table is the instantiation of the
 

1733
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,389
this table is the instantiation of the
form

1734
00:29:00,389 --> 00:29:00,399
form
 

1735
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,230
form
table and that there is this table that

1736
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:02,240
table and that there is this table that
 

1737
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,669
table and that there is this table that
actually exists somewhere

1738
00:29:03,669 --> 00:29:03,679
actually exists somewhere
 

1739
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,269
actually exists somewhere
it's where this place where numbers

1740
00:29:05,269 --> 00:29:05,279
it's where this place where numbers
 

1741
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,950
it's where this place where numbers
exist like the number two

1742
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:06,960
exist like the number two
 

1743
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,110
exist like the number two
okay so there we use the number two

1744
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:09,120
okay so there we use the number two
 

1745
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,190
okay so there we use the number two
mathematically therefore it exists

1746
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:11,200
mathematically therefore it exists
 

1747
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,269
mathematically therefore it exists
but have you ever seen a real one have

1748
00:29:13,269 --> 00:29:13,279
but have you ever seen a real one have
 

1749
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,789
but have you ever seen a real one have
you ever seen the real two

1750
00:29:14,789 --> 00:29:14,799
you ever seen the real two
 

1751
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,590
you ever seen the real two
no no okay so but where does it exist so

1752
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:17,600
no no okay so but where does it exist so
 

1753
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,710
no no okay so but where does it exist so
he says that tables

1754
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:18,720
he says that tables
 

1755
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,510
he says that tables
so he was also talking about things that

1756
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:21,520
so he was also talking about things that
 

1757
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,549
so he was also talking about things that
you know

1758
00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:22,559
you know
 

1759
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,350
you know
he says are real making a distinction

1760
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:25,360
he says are real making a distinction
 

1761
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,310
he says are real making a distinction
between

1762
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:26,320
between
 

1763
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,389
between
the people and and by the way he got

1764
00:29:28,389 --> 00:29:28,399
the people and and by the way he got
 

1765
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:29,830
the people and and by the way he got
this from socrates is

1766
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:29,840
this from socrates is
 

1767
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,029
this from socrates is
his um mentor who was killed by athens

1768
00:29:33,029 --> 00:29:33,039
his um mentor who was killed by athens
 

1769
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:33,669
his um mentor who was killed by athens
because

1777
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,110
what they believe in is not real right
yeah by the way his idea of forms

1778
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:41,120
yeah by the way his idea of forms
 

1779
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,510
yeah by the way his idea of forms
is just he's just making me realize how

1780
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:43,520
is just he's just making me realize how
 

1781
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,029
is just he's just making me realize how
like incredible was that

1782
00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:45,039
like incredible was that
 

1783
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,470
like incredible was that
somebody like that was able to come up

1784
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:46,480
somebody like that was able to come up
 

1785
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,269
somebody like that was able to come up
with that i mean that idea became a myth

1786
00:29:49,269 --> 00:29:49,279
with that i mean that idea became a myth
 

1787
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:50,549
with that i mean that idea became a myth
that

1788
00:29:50,549 --> 00:29:50,559
that
 

1789
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,190
that
the idea of forms right that permeated

1790
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:53,200
the idea of forms right that permeated
 

1791
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,149
the idea of forms right that permeated
uh

1792
00:29:54,149 --> 00:29:54,159
uh
 

1793
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,310
uh
probably the most influential set of

1794
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:56,320
probably the most influential set of
 

1795
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,430
probably the most influential set of
ideas in

1796
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:57,440
ideas in
 

1797
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,350
ideas in
in the history of philosophy in the

1798
00:29:59,350 --> 00:29:59,360
in the history of philosophy in the
 

1799
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,470
in the history of philosophy in the
history of ideas

1800
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:00,480
history of ideas
 

1801
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,870

current and then
constantine who was an elite

2140
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:32,720
constantine who was an elite

00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,750
constantine who was an elite
had an experience and made christianity

00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,710
a state religion
and by that time there were different

2146
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:38,720
and by that time there were different
 

2147
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,230
and by that time there were different
forms of christianity

2148
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:40,240
forms of christianity
 

2149
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,390
forms of christianity
probably hundreds of them well most

2150
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:42,400
probably hundreds of them well most
 

2151
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,230
probably hundreds of them well most
likely and

2152
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:44,240
likely and
 

2153
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,750
likely and
constantine and the people who were

2154
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:47,760
constantine and the people who were
 

2155
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,390
constantine and the people who were
powerful with him decided that their

2156
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:50,400
powerful with him decided that their
 

2157
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,109
powerful with him decided that their
idea

2158
00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:51,119
idea
 

2159
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,030
idea
this is the council of nicaea now

2160
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:53,040
this is the council of nicaea now
 

2161
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,150
this is the council of nicaea now
decided that there was

2162
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:54,160
decided that there was
 

2163
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,710
decided that there was
one form and they called it universal

2164
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:56,720
one form and they called it universal
 

2165
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,270
one form and they called it universal
the one form of christianity and this

2166
00:35:59,270 --> 00:35:59,280
the one form of christianity and this
 

2167
00:35:59,280 --> 00:35:59,990
the one form of christianity and this
should be it

2168
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:00,000
should be it
 

2169
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,230
should be it
and so they they kind of took out all

2170
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:02,240
and so they they kind of took out all
 

2171
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,550
and so they they kind of took out all
the other denominations of christianity

2172
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:04,560
the other denominations of christianity
 

2173
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,750
the other denominations of christianity
and different forms of it

2174
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:05,760
and different forms of it
 

2175
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,950
and different forms of it
so you can see that a very very powerful

2176
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:08,960
so you can see that a very very powerful
 

2177
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,990
so you can see that a very very powerful
set of beliefs

2178
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:12,000
set of beliefs
 

2179
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,109
set of beliefs
put a culture on fire right

2180
00:36:15,109 --> 00:36:15,119
put a culture on fire right
 

2181
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,670
put a culture on fire right
and so how did they they had to deal

2182
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:17,680
and so how did they they had to deal
 

2183
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,109
and so how did they they had to deal
with that fire somehow

2184
00:36:19,109 --> 00:36:19,119
with that fire somehow
 

2185
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:21,510
with that fire somehow
and so they narrativized it they decided

2186
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:21,520
and so they narrativized it they decided
 

2187
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,190
and so they narrativized it they decided
how do we interpret this and they

2188
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:23,200
how do we interpret this and they
 

2189
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,150
how do we interpret this and they
interpreted it

2190
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:24,160
interpreted it
 

2191
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,230
interpreted it
as they wished but that wasn't the only

2192
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:26,240
as they wished but that wasn't the only
 

2193
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,990
as they wished but that wasn't the only
interpretation of christianity

2194
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:28,000

so i take this definition
and it comes from john livingston and

2460
00:40:54,309 --> 00:40:54,319
and it comes from john livingston and
 

2461
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:55,430
and it comes from john livingston and
it's um

2462
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:55,440
it's um

00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,270
it's um
religion is that set of beliefs and

2464
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:57,280
religion is that set of beliefs and

00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,710
religion is that set of beliefs and
practices

2466
00:40:58,710 --> 00:40:58,720
practices
 

2467
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,829
practices
um that determine that is inspired by a

um that determine that is inspired by a
 

2469
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:03,430
um that determine that is inspired by a
transformative

2470
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:03,440
transformative
 

2471
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,430
transformative
what is perceived actually to be a

2472
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:05,440
what is perceived actually to be a
 

2473
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,630
what is perceived actually to be a
transformative

2474
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:06,640
transformative
 

2475
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,510
transformative
and sacred power can you say that again

2476
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:09,520
and sacred power can you say that again
 

2477
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,150
and sacred power can you say that again
yeah

2478
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:10,160
yeah
 

2479
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,870
yeah
so religion is a set of it's not just

2480
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:12,880
so religion is a set of it's not just
 

2481
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,309
so religion is a set of it's not just
belief it's also practices

2482
00:41:14,309 --> 00:41:14,319
belief it's also practices
 

2483
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:15,670
belief it's also practices
it's both belief and practices because

2484
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:15,680
it's both belief and practices because
 

2485
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,510
it's both belief and practices because
you won't have the practices without the

2486
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:17,520
you won't have the practices without the
 

2487
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,150
you won't have the practices without the
belief

2488
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:18,160
belief
 

2489
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,710
belief
so you have those together okay and it's

2490
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:20,720
so you have those together okay and it's
 

2491
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,670
so you have those together okay and it's
inspired

2492
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:21,680
inspired
 

2493
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,670
inspired
by what is perceived because we don't

2494
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:23,680
by what is perceived because we don't
 

2495
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,950
by what is perceived because we don't
know if it's real or not

2496
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:24,960
know if it's real or not
 

2497
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,589
know if it's real or not
what is perceived to be of sacred and

2498
00:41:27,589 --> 00:41:27,599
what is perceived to be of sacred and
 

2499
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:28,950
what is perceived to be of sacred and
transforming power

2500
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:28,960
transforming power
 

2501
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,430
transforming power
so perceived by the followers or is this

2502
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:31,440

that's a really good definition so
 

2511
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,910
that's a really good definition so
and that's the governing idea is that

2512
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:41,920
and that's the governing idea is that
 

2513
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,030
and that's the governing idea is that
there's something

so within that falls everything that
 

2537
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,349
so within that falls everything that
we've uh

2538
00:42:07,349 --> 00:42:07,359
we've uh
 

2539
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:09,190
we've uh
we've talked about so far including

2540
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:09,200
we've talked about so far including
 

2541
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,030
we've talked about so far including
technology and

2542
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:11,040
technology and
 

2543
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,069
technology and
um alien life and so on

2544
00:42:14,069 --> 00:42:14,079

is good for human civilization
let me uh maybe phrase it differently is

2550
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:25,440
let me uh maybe phrase it differently is
 

2551
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,470
let me uh maybe phrase it differently is
what's

2552
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:26,480
what's
 

2553
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,270
what's
religion good for okay yeah that's a

2554
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:29,280
religion good for okay yeah that's a
 

2555
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,150
religion good for okay yeah that's a
great question

2556
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:30,160
great question
 

2557
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,990
great question
thanks for asking that most people don't

2558
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:32,000
thanks for asking that most people don't
 

2559
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,829
thanks for asking that most people don't
ask that and i think it's

2560
00:42:33,829 --> 00:42:33,839
ask that and i think it's
 

2561
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:36,950
ask that and i think it's
the question to ask why do we still have

2562
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:36,960
the question to ask why do we still have
 

2563
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,710
the question to ask why do we still have
religion that's the question right

2564
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:38,720
religion that's the question right
 

2565
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,829
religion that's the question right
because

2566
00:42:39,829 --> 00:42:39,839
because
 

2567
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:44,150
because
scientists and others scholars um

2568
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:44,160
scientists and others scholars um
 

2569
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,349
scientists and others scholars um
humanists even thought that

2570
00:42:47,349 --> 00:42:47,359
humanists even thought that
 

2571
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:49,190
humanists even thought that
there's this thing called the secular

2572
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:49,200
there's this thing called the secular
 

2573
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,309
there's this thing called the secular
secularization thesis and it's this idea

2574
00:42:52,309 --> 00:42:52,319
secularization thesis and it's this idea
 

2575
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:55,589
secularization thesis and it's this idea
that the more um we progress rationally

2576
00:42:55,589 --> 00:42:55,599
that the more um we progress rationally
 

2577
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:57,750
that the more um we progress rationally
and we have better instruments for

2578
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:57,760
and we have better instruments for
 

2579
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,030
and we have better instruments for
understanding our reality

2580
00:42:59,030 --> 00:42:59,040
understanding our reality
 

2581
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,270
understanding our reality
the less religious we will be but that's

2582
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:01,280

been found to be untrue

2584
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:03,040
been found to be untrue

well it's adaptive in some way in my
 

2591
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,349
well it's adaptive in some way in my
opinion most

2592
00:43:09,349 --> 00:43:09,359
opinion most
 

2593

okay so why why does this take off well
it takes off because we're becoming

2626
00:43:44,069 --> 00:43:44,079
it takes off because we're becoming
 

2627
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:47,829
it takes off because we're becoming
a um a colonial power

2628
00:43:47,829 --> 00:43:47,839
a um a colonial power
 

2629
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,349
a um a colonial power
that means we're going into other

2630
00:43:49,349 --> 00:43:49,359
that means we're going into other
 

2631
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:52,390
that means we're going into other
countries we're conquering them

2632
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:52,400
countries we're conquering them
 

2633

countries we're conquering them
we are you know how do we survive

2634
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:55,920
we are you know how do we survive
 

2635
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:56,710
we are you know how do we survive
together

2636
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:56,720

together
as as cultures that don't clash

2638
00:44:00,069 --> 00:44:00,079
as as cultures that don't clash
 

2639
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:01,990
as as cultures that don't clash
well we have to have a belief structure

2640
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:02,000
well we have to have a belief structure
 

2641
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,109
well we have to have a belief structure
that allows us to

2642
00:44:03,109 --> 00:44:03,119
that allows us to
 

2643
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,190
that allows us to
and i think religions function that way

2644
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:05,200
and i think religions function that way
 

2645
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,230
and i think religions function that way
frankly so these

2646
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:06,240
frankly so these
 

2647
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,589
frankly so these
religions help us in from us

2648
00:44:09,589 --> 00:44:09,599
religions help us in from us
 

2649
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:12,790
religions help us in from us
richard dawkins meme idea it

richard dawkins meme idea it
 

2651
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,550
richard dawkins meme idea it
allows us to explore space of ideas um

2652
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:16,560
allows us to explore space of ideas um
 

2653
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,270
allows us to explore space of ideas um
and that in itself is the um so it's

2654
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:19,280
and that in itself is the um so it's
 

2655
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,990
and that in itself is the um so it's
like evolution of ideas

2656
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:22,000
like evolution of ideas
 

2657
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,230
like evolution of ideas
and we're just a powerful tool for uh it

2658
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:24,240
and we're just a powerful tool for uh it
 

2659
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,270
and we're just a powerful tool for uh it
is for ideas

2660
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:25,280
is for ideas
 

2661
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,550

we're still trying to figure that out

2668
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:39,520
we're still trying to figure that out
 

2669
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,510
we're still trying to figure that out
you know why still

2670
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:41,520
you know why still
 

2671
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,750

2679
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,510
be able to confirm that
maybe if we get better instruments you

2680
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:51,520

[Laughter]
 

2701
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:09,510
[Laughter]
that's funny i hope will become a

2702
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:09,520
that's funny i hope will become a
 

2703
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,750
that's funny i hope will become a
scientific discipline of consciousness

2704
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:11,760
scientific discipline of consciousness
 

2705
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,670
scientific discipline of consciousness
and consciousness is in some sense

2706
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:13,680
and consciousness is in some sense
 

2707
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:14,870
and consciousness is in some sense
connected to

2708
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:14,880
connected to
 

2709
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,670
connected to
maybe what the meaning of the word soul

2710
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:17,680
maybe what the meaning of the word soul
 

2711
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,950
maybe what the meaning of the word soul
used to be

2712
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:18,960
used to be
 

2713
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,349
used to be
and i i think it's a fascinating open

2714
00:45:21,349 --> 00:45:21,359
and i i think it's a fascinating open
 

2715
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:22,790
and i i think it's a fascinating open
question like what is consciousness and

2716
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:22,800
question like what is consciousness and
 

2717
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,510
question like what is consciousness and
so on that

2718
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:23,520
so on that
 

2719
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,790
so on that
maybe we'll touch on in a little bit

2720
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:26,800
maybe we'll touch on in a little bit
 

2721
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,349
maybe we'll touch on in a little bit
but yeah anyway back to our religions

2722
00:45:29,349 --> 00:45:29,359
but yeah anyway back to our religions
 

2723
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:30,309
but yeah anyway back to our religions
being adaptive

2724
00:45:30,309 --> 00:45:30,319
being adaptive
 

2725
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:31,750
being adaptive
i think that christianity probably

2726
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:31,760
i think that christianity probably
 

2727
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,630
i think that christianity probably
helped us um

2728
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:34,640
helped us um
 

2729
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,589
helped us um
become better people to each other as we

2730
00:45:37,589 --> 00:45:37,599
become better people to each other as we
 

2731
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:38,470
become better people to each other as we
moved into

2732
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:38,480
moved into
 

2733
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,589
moved into
a more global society and i also this it

2734
00:45:41,589 --> 00:45:41,599
a more global society and i also this it
 

2735
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:42,950
a more global society and i also this it
goes along with my book which is

2736
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:42,960
goes along with my book which is
 

2737
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,950
goes along with my book which is
basically making the argument that

2738
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:44,960
basically making the argument that
 

2739
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,990
basically making the argument that
belief in non-human intelligence or ets

2740
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:48,000
belief in non-human intelligence or ets
 

2741
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,990
belief in non-human intelligence or ets
or ufos uaps whatever you want to call

2742
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:50,000
or ufos uaps whatever you want to call
 

2743
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:50,550
or ufos uaps whatever you want to call
them

2744
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:50,560
them
 

2745
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,670
them
is a new form of religion and

2746
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:53,680
is a new form of religion and
 

2747
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,470
is a new form of religion and
how does that work with the the

2748
00:45:56,470 --> 00:45:56,480
how does that work with the the
 

2749
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,309
how does that work with the the
scientific method

2750
00:45:58,309 --> 00:45:58,319
scientific method
 

2751
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:00,470
scientific method
do you think there's always this role of

2752
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:00,480
do you think there's always this role of
 

2753
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,069
do you think there's always this role of
religion as being

2754
00:46:02,069 --> 00:46:02,079
religion as being
 

2755
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:03,910
religion as being
in his broad definition religion as

in his broad definition religion as
 

2757
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,109
in his broad definition religion as
being a complement

00:46:05,109 --> 00:46:05,119
being a complement
 

2759
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:08,710
being a complement
to our sort of very rigorous empirical

2760
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:08,720
to our sort of very rigorous empirical

pursuit of understanding reality
 

2763
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,710
pursuit of understanding reality
there's always going to be this coupling

2764
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:12,720
there's always going to be this coupling
 

2765
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,990
there's always going to be this coupling
we'll always define

2766
00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:14,000
we'll always define
 

2767
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,630
we'll always define
redefining new eras of civilization of

2768
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:16,640
redefining new eras of civilization of
 

2769
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,230
redefining new eras of civilization of
what

2770
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:18,240
what
 

2771
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,870
what
that religion actually looks like so you

2772
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:20,880
that religion actually looks like so you
 

2773
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,470
that religion actually looks like so you
talk about technology and so on being

2774
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:22,480
talk about technology and so on being
 

2775
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,589
talk about technology and so on being
the modern

2776
00:46:23,589 --> 00:46:23,599
the modern
 

2777
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:26,790
the modern
set of religious uh beliefs around that

2778
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:26,800
set of religious uh beliefs around that
 

2779
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,589
set of religious uh beliefs around that
is so is that always going to is religio

3347
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,589
ufos and uaps so with no i think that
well i think nietzsche would say that

3348
00:56:33,589 --> 00:56:33,599
well i think nietzsche would say that
 

3349
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:36,069
well i think nietzsche would say that
that's a progressive adaptation of

3350
00:56:36,069 --> 00:56:36,079
that's a progressive adaptation of
 

3351
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:36,789
that's a progressive adaptation of
religion

3352
00:56:36,789 --> 00:56:36,799
religion
 

3353
00:56:36,799 --> 00:56:38,549
religion
is what i would hope he would say

3354
00:56:38,549 --> 00:56:38,559
is what i would hope he would say
 

3355
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:40,150
is what i would hope he would say
nietzsche however

3356
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:40,160
nietzsche however
 

3357
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,549
nietzsche however
is unpredictable i think i i couldn't

3358
00:56:42,549 --> 00:56:42,559
is unpredictable i think i i couldn't
 

3359
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:43,510
is unpredictable i think i i couldn't
predict him

3360
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:43,520
predict him
 

3361
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,390
predict him
so i would say that it would be my hope

3362
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:46,400
so i would say that it would be my hope
 

3363
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,750
so i would say that it would be my hope
that he would say

3364
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:47,760
that he would say
 

3365
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:51,589
that he would say
this is an accurate representation

3366
00:56:51,589 --> 00:56:51,599
this is an accurate representation
 

3367
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:55,030
this is an accurate representation
of a move into a new type of religion

3368
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:55,040
of a move into a new type of religion
 

3369
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,990
of a move into a new type of religion
and it's adaptive therefore progressive

3370
00:56:57,990 --> 00:56:58,000
and it's adaptive therefore progressive
 

3371
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,430
and it's adaptive therefore progressive

00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:01,440
the process
 

3429
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,829
the process
the long process of uh putting this book

3430
00:58:03,829 --> 00:58:03,839
the long process of uh putting this book
 

3431
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:05,430
the long process of uh putting this book
together sure

3432
00:58:05,430 --> 00:58:05,440
together sure
 

3433
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,630
together sure
just like with my book on purgatory um

3434
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:08,640
just like with my book on purgatory um
 

3435
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,950
just like with my book on purgatory um
i went into the research thinking that

3436
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:10,960
i went into the research thinking that
 

3437
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,309
i went into the research thinking that
it would be something

3438
00:58:12,309 --> 00:58:12,319
it would be something
 

3439
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:14,390
it would be something
that it was entirely not it ended up

3440
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:14,400
that it was entirely not it ended up
 

3441
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,829
that it was entirely not it ended up
being something completely different

3442
00:58:15,829 --> 00:58:15,839
being something completely different
 

3443
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:17,990
being something completely different
and i think that's good i think that

3444
00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:18,000
and i think that's good i think that
 

3445
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,190
and i think that's good i think that
people who do research

3446
00:58:19,190 --> 00:58:19,200
people who do research
 

3447
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,510
people who do research
need to are very excited actually when

3448
00:58:21,510 --> 00:58:21,520
need to are very excited actually when
 

3449
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,109
need to are very excited actually when
their research surprises them

3450
00:58:23,109 --> 00:58:23,119
their research surprises them
 

3451
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:26,309
their research surprises them
so i was happily surprised by my

3452
00:58:26,309 --> 00:58:26,319
so i was happily surprised by my
 

3453
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:27,270
so i was happily surprised by my
purgatory book

3454
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:27,280
purgatory book
 

3455
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,190
purgatory book
to learn that it was a place you know

3456
00:58:29,190 --> 00:58:29,200
to learn that it was a place you know
 

3457
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,710
to learn that it was a place you know
and and so

3458
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:30,720
and and so
 

3459
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:33,910
and and so
um i went into

3460
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:33,920
um i went into
 

3461
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:37,109
um i went into
american cosmic being a non-believer

3462
00:58:37,109 --> 00:58:37,119
american cosmic being a non-believer
 

3463
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:40,230
american cosmic being a non-believer
in ufos entirely and i came out

3464
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:40,240
in ufos entirely and i came out
 

3465
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:44,950
in ufos entirely and i came out
being agnostic okay

3474
00:58:55,829 --> 00:58:55,839
and
 

3475
00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:58,710
and
i didn't think that first of all i knew

3476
00:58:58,710 --> 00:58:58,720
i didn't think that first of all i knew
 

3477
00:58:58,720 --> 00:58:59,349
i didn't think that first of all i knew
that the

3478
00:58:59,349 --> 00:58:59,359
that the
 

3479
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:03,510
that the
government was was part of the

3480
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:03,520
government was was part of the

situation i just didn't know how much
 

3483
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:07,349
situation i just didn't know how much
and so i learned that

3484
00:59:07,349 --> 00:59:07,359
and so i learned that
 

3485
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:10,870
and so i learned that
quickly and acclimated to it

3486
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:10,880
quickly and acclimated to it
 

3487
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:15,349
quickly and acclimated to it
um accepted it and

3488
00:59:15,349 --> 00:59:15,359
um accepted it and
 

3489
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:19,910
um accepted it and
noted that indeed

3490
00:59:19,910 --> 00:59:19,920
noted that indeed

00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:27,040
is much more mysterious than we think
 

3495
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:29,190
is much more mysterious than we think
it is it's more mystery there are more

it is it's more mystery there are more
mysteries in

3498
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:30,480
mysteries in
 

3499
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:33,349
mysteries in
this life than your philosophy provides

3500
00:59:33,349 --> 00:59:33,359
this life than your philosophy provides

for
 

3503

for
so as a sense american cosmic is about

encapsulated by this
the the realm of technology in the realm

3510
00:59:45,349 --> 00:59:45,359
the the realm of technology in the realm
 

3511
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:46,069
the the realm of technology in the realm
of alien

3512
00:59:46,069 --> 00:59:46,079
of alien
 

3513
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:50,069
of alien
intelligences yes i think that um

3514
00:59:50,069 --> 00:59:50,079
intelligences yes i think that um
 

3515
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:53,829
intelligences yes i think that um
i think that i mean i'd have to go

3516
00:59:53,829 --> 00:59:53,839
i think that i mean i'd have to go
 

3517
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:55,589
i think that i mean i'd have to go
off record as a professor and talk

3518
00:59:55,589 --> 00:59:55,599
off record as a professor and talk
 

3519
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:57,349
off record as a professor and talk
personally as a person

3520
00:59:57,349 --> 00:59:57,359
personally as a person
 

3521
00:59:57,359 --> 01:00:00,870
personally as a person
i do think that um

3522
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:00,880
i do think that um
 

3523
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:03,990
i do think that um
there are mysteries of which

3524
01:00:03,990 --> 01:00:04,000
there are mysteries of which
 

3525
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,349
there are mysteries of which
we have an inkling and if it's something

3526
01:00:07,349 --> 01:00:07,359
we have an inkling and if it's something
 

3527
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:10,069
we have an inkling and if it's something
as powerful as

3528
01:00:10,069 --> 01:00:10,079
as powerful as
 

3529
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:12,470
as powerful as
non-human intelligence whether or not

3530
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:12,480
non-human intelligence whether or not
 

3531
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:13,510
non-human intelligence whether or not
it's from another

3532
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:13,520
it's from another
 

3533
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:16,950
it's from another
planet extraterrestrial or it happens to

3534
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:16,960
planet extraterrestrial or it happens to
 

3535
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:17,430
planet extraterrestrial or it happens to
be from

3536
01:00:17,430 --> 01:00:17,440
be from
 

3537
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:20,150
be from
like another dimension or something else

3538
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:20,160
like another dimension or something else
 

3539
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,030
like another dimension or something else
i think that

3540
01:00:21,030 --> 01:00:21,040
i think that
 

3541
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:24,710
i think that
this is going to um get the attention of

3542
01:00:24,710 --> 01:00:24,720
this is going to um get the attention of
 

3543
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,309
this is going to um get the attention of
institutions of power

3544
01:00:26,309 --> 01:00:26,319
institutions of power
 

3545
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:28,150
institutions of power
and indeed i think that's what has

3546
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:28,160
and indeed i think that's what has
 

3547
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,069
and indeed i think that's what has
happened and

3548
01:00:30,069 --> 01:00:30,079
happened and
 

3549
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:33,750
happened and
um although probably

3550
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:33,760
um although probably
 

3551
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:37,349
um although probably
he people have had interactions with

3552
01:00:37,349 --> 01:00:37,359
he people have had interactions with
 

3553
01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:38,069
he people have had interactions with
these things

3554
01:00:38,069 --> 01:00:38,079
these things
 

3555
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:41,109
these things
it appears to me historically uh for

3556
01:00:41,109 --> 01:00:41,119
it appears to me historically uh for
 

3557
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:42,710
it appears to me historically uh for
a long time as long as humans have

3558
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:42,720
a long time as long as humans have
 

3559
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:45,190
a long time as long as humans have
existed i would imagine

3560
01:00:45,190 --> 01:00:45,200
existed i would imagine
 

3561
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:49,030
existed i would imagine
that indeed um

3562
01:00:49,030 --> 01:00:49,040
that indeed um
 

3563
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,789
that indeed um
this is something that's quite powerful

3564
01:00:50,789 --> 01:00:50,799
this is something that's quite powerful
 

3565
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:52,069
this is something that's quite powerful
and could change the

3566
01:00:52,069 --> 01:00:52,079
and could change the
 

3567
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:56,549
and could change the
belief structures of our entire

3568
01:00:56,549 --> 01:00:56,559
belief structures of our entire
 

3569
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:58,549
belief structures of our entire
are civilization basically so it's the

3570
01:00:58,549 --> 01:00:58,559
are civilization basically so it's the
 

3571
01:00:58,559 --> 01:00:59,670
are civilization basically so it's the
same way that you're

3572
01:00:59,670 --> 01:00:59,680
same way that you're
 

3573
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,349
same way that you're
talking the belief structures were

3574
01:01:01,349 --> 01:01:01,359
talking the belief structures were
 

3575
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:03,430
talking the belief structures were
strongly affected by religious beliefs

3576
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:03,440
strongly affected by religious beliefs
 

3577
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,190
strongly affected by religious beliefs
throughout history yes in the same way

3578
01:01:05,190 --> 01:01:05,200
throughout history yes in the same way
 

3579
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,589
throughout history yes in the same way
this has the potential

3580
01:01:07,589 --> 01:01:07,599
this has the potential
 

3581
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:12,150
this has the potential
uh it it uh serves as um

3582
01:01:12,150 --> 01:01:12,160
uh it it uh serves as um
 

3583
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:15,589
uh it it uh serves as um
a source of concern for the powerful

3584
01:01:15,589 --> 01:01:15,599
a source of concern for the powerful
 

3585
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:16,549
a source of concern for the powerful
because

3586
01:01:16,549 --> 01:01:16,559
because
 

3587
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:19,109
because
it can have very significant effects on

3588
01:01:19,109 --> 01:01:19,119
it can have very significant effects on
 

3589
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:19,910
it can have very significant effects on
the populace

3590
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:19,920
the populace
 

3591
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:23,589
the populace
yes is there some broader understanding

3592
01:01:23,589 --> 01:01:23,599
yes is there some broader understanding
 

3593
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:25,190
yes is there some broader understanding

they're first if we are if listen

they're first if we are if listen
 

3681
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:58,950
they're first if we are if listen
is i'm not the first to say this if

3682
01:02:58,950 --> 01:02:58,960
is i'm not the first to say this if
 

3683
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,789
is i'm not the first to say this if
we're in contact with

3684
01:03:00,789 --> 01:03:00,799
we're in contact with
 

3685
01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:03,029
we're in contact with
non-human intelligence we're most likely

3686
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:03,039
non-human intelligence we're most likely
 

3687
01:03:03,039 --> 01:03:04,630
non-human intelligence we're most likely
in contact with its

3688
01:03:04,630 --> 01:03:04,640
in contact with its
 

3689
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:08,470
in contact with its
technology because think about us

3690
01:03:08,470 --> 01:03:08,480
technology because think about us
 

3691
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:11,510
technology because think about us
um do we send human beings to mars yet

3692
01:03:11,510 --> 01:03:11,520
um do we send human beings to mars yet
 

3693
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,750
um do we send human beings to mars yet
some people say yes but let's put that

3694
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:13,760
some people say yes but let's put that
 

3695
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:15,109
some people say yes but let's put that
aside so

3696
01:03:15,109 --> 01:03:15,119
aside so
 

3697
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:16,950
aside so
no we don't we use our technology we

3698
01:03:16,950 --> 01:03:16,960
no we don't we use our technology we
 

3699
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,710
no we don't we use our technology we
send our rovers to mars

3700
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:18,720
send our rovers to mars
 

3701
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:21,190
send our rovers to mars
okay okay so if there's an

3702
01:03:21,190 --> 01:03:21,200
okay okay so if there's an
 

3703
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,150
okay okay so if there's an
extraterrestrial

3704
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:22,160
extraterrestrial
 

3705
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:25,270

civilization is it sending are they

3706
01:03:25,270 --> 01:03:25,280
civilization is it sending are they
 

3707
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:25,910
civilization is it sending are they
coming

3708
01:03:25,910 --> 01:03:25,920
coming
 

3709
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:28,069
coming
by themselves are they coming to see us

3710
01:03:28,069 --> 01:03:28,079
by themselves are they coming to see us
 

3711
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:29,829
by themselves are they coming to see us
or are they sending their technology

3712
01:03:29,829 --> 01:03:29,839
or are they sending their technology
 

3713
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:30,630
or are they sending their technology
most likely

3714
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:30,640
most likely
 

3715
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,349
most likely
they either are technology or they are

3716
01:03:33,349 --> 01:03:33,359
they either are technology or they are
 

3717
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:34,710
they either are technology or they are
sending their technology yeah there

3718
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:34,720
sending their technology yeah there
 

3719
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,390
sending their technology yeah there
might be a gray area between what is

3720
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:36,400
might be a gray area between what is
 

3721
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,150
might be a gray area between what is
technology and what the aliens are

3722
01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:38,160
technology and what the aliens are
 

3723
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:40,789
technology and what the aliens are
yeah so but you're saying like uh

3724
01:03:40,789 --> 01:03:40,799
yeah so but you're saying like uh
 

3725
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:42,549
yeah so but you're saying like uh
basically a robotic probe

3726
01:03:42,549 --> 01:03:42,559
basically a robotic probe
 

3727
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:44,150
basically a robotic probe
that would be the equivalent of us our

3728
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:44,160
that would be the equivalent of us our
 

3729
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:46,150
that would be the equivalent of us our
human civilization created technology

3730
01:03:46,150 --> 01:03:46,160
human civilization created technology
 

3731
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:47,029
human civilization created technology
way more

3732
01:03:47,029 --> 01:03:47,039
way more
 

3733
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:50,390
way more
way more uh advanced than what we could

3734
01:03:50,390 --> 01:03:50,400
way more uh advanced than what we could
 

3735
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,870
way more uh advanced than what we could
believe to be a probe all right it's

3736
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:52,880
believe to be a probe all right it's
 

3737
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,870
believe to be a probe all right it's
kind of funny to think about like

3738
01:03:54,870 --> 01:03:54,880
kind of funny to think about like
 

3739
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:59,029
kind of funny to think about like
if uh whatever a sort of

3740
01:03:59,029 --> 01:03:59,039
if uh whatever a sort of
 

3741
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:03,750
if uh whatever a sort of
um extraterrestrial creations have

3742
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:03,760
um extraterrestrial creations have
 

3743
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,670
um extraterrestrial creations have
visited earth that were we're

3744
01:04:05,670 --> 01:04:05,680
visited earth that were we're
 

3745
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:07,910
visited earth that were we're
interacting with some like

3746
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:07,920
interacting with some like
 

3747
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:11,990
interacting with some like
dumb crappy drones yeah that's true

3748
01:04:11,990 --> 01:04:12,000
dumb crappy drones yeah that's true
 

3749
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,510
dumb crappy drones yeah that's true
and we're like like

3750
01:04:15,510 --> 01:04:15,520

 

3751
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:17,510

we're like building these like myths and

3752
01:04:17,510 --> 01:04:17,520
we're like building these like myths and
 

3753
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,349
we're like building these like myths and
so on from like an experience with some

3754
01:04:19,349 --> 01:04:19,359
so on from like an experience with some
 

3755
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:21,910
so on from like an experience with some

01:04:44,789 --> 01:04:44,799
but what forms can it possibly take so
 

3777
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:47,270
but what forms can it possibly take so
yeah okay i really love this idea that

3778
01:04:47,270 --> 01:04:47,280
yeah okay i really love this idea that
 

3779
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:49,109
yeah okay i really love this idea that
um

3780
01:04:49,109 --> 01:04:49,119
um
 

3781
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:51,109
um
i tend to be humble in the face of all

3782
01:04:51,109 --> 01:04:51,119
i tend to be humble in the face of all
 

3783
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:52,950
i tend to be humble in the face of all
that we don't know

3784
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:52,960
that we don't know
 

3785
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:55,990
that we don't know
and i tend to believe that the form

3786
01:04:55,990 --> 01:04:56,000
and i tend to believe that the form
 

3787
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,270
and i tend to believe that the form
alien life forms would take

3788
01:04:59,270 --> 01:04:59,280
alien life forms would take
 

3789

alien life forms would take
and the way they would communicate is

3790
01:05:02,150 --> 01:05:02,160
and the way they would communicate is
 

3791
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:03,589
and the way they would communicate is
much more likely

3792
01:05:03,589 --> 01:05:03,599
much more likely
 

3793
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:06,230
much more likely
to be of a form that we can't even

3794
01:05:06,230 --> 01:05:06,240
to be of a form that we can't even
 

3795
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,069
to be of a form that we can't even
comprehend or perhaps can't even

3796
01:05:08,069 --> 01:05:08,079
comprehend or perhaps can't even
 

3797
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:11,750
comprehend or perhaps can't even
perceive directly so like

perceive directly so like
 

3799
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:15,430
perceive directly so like
you know uh it could be in the space of

01:05:15,430 --> 01:05:15,440
you know uh it could be in the space of
 

3801
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:17,270
you know uh it could be in the space of
you know we don't understand most of how

our mind works it could be in the space
 

3805
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:21,270

okay and most people wouldn't think that

3936
01:07:32,309 --> 01:07:32,319
okay and most people wouldn't think that

uh he has a phd in information
 

3949
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:47,029
uh he has a phd in information
technology from

3950
01:07:47,029 --> 01:07:47,039
technology from
 

3951
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:48,549
technology from
computer science basically from

3952
01:07:48,549 --> 01:07:48,559
computer science basically from
 

3953
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:50,549
computer science basically from
northwestern and he got that back in the

3954
01:07:50,549 --> 01:07:50,559
northwestern and he got that back in the
 

3955

back when computer science wasn't really
 

3963
01:07:57,599 --> 01:07:58,470
back when computer science wasn't really
even the future yeah

most people take
those two interests of his as separate

3988
01:08:18,309 --> 01:08:18,319
those two interests of his as separate
 

3989
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:19,349
those two interests of his as separate
interests

3990
01:08:19,349 --> 01:08:19,359
interests
 

3991
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:21,110
interests
and i remember being at a very small

3992
01:08:21,110 --> 01:08:21,120
and i remember being at a very small
 

3993
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:23,030
and i remember being at a very small
conference and listening to him

3994
01:08:23,030 --> 01:08:23,040
conference and listening to him
 

3995
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:24,789
conference and listening to him
being in awe of course because he's an

3996
01:08:24,789 --> 01:08:24,799
being in awe of course because he's an

awe-inspiring person
 

3999
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:28,550
awe-inspiring person
and then thinking wait a minute why do

4000
01:08:28,550 --> 01:08:28,560
and then thinking wait a minute why do
 

4001
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:29,669
and then thinking wait a minute why do
people

4002
01:08:29,669 --> 01:08:29,679
people
 

4003
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:31,590
people
compartmentalize those two things about

4004
01:08:31,590 --> 01:08:31,600
compartmentalize those two things about
 

4005
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,430
compartmentalize those two things about
him they're one and the same

4006
01:08:33,430 --> 01:08:33,440
him they're one and the same
 

4007
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:36,709
him they're one and the same
okay so when we talk about ufos and uaps

4008
01:08:36,709 --> 01:08:36,719
okay so when we talk about ufos and uaps
 

4009
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:37,269
okay so when we talk about ufos and uaps
and stuff

4010
01:08:37,269 --> 01:08:37,279
and stuff
 

4011
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:40,149
and stuff
we have to talk about digital technology

4012
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:40,159
we have to talk about digital technology
 

4013
01:08:40,159 --> 01:08:41,189
we have to talk about digital technology
and things like that

4014
01:08:41,189 --> 01:08:41,199
and things like that
 

4015
01:08:41,199 --> 01:08:44,309
and things like that
now if we're going back to what i

4016
01:08:44,309 --> 01:08:44,319
now if we're going back to what i
 

4017
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:46,789
now if we're going back to what i
so if i were to say what if i were to

4018
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:46,799
so if i were to say what if i were to
 

4019
01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:47,669
so if i were to say what if i were to
believe in

4020
01:08:47,669 --> 01:08:47,679
believe in
 

4021
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:50,229
believe in
and i like i said earlier i was agnostic

4022
01:08:50,229 --> 01:08:50,239
and i like i said earlier i was agnostic
 

4023
01:08:50,239 --> 01:08:51,349
and i like i said earlier i was agnostic

that's communicating with us
 

4035
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:01,829
that's communicating with us
i'm going to tell you how i think they

i'm going to tell you how i think they
 

4037
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:03,749
i'm going to tell you how i think they

greeks again

4040
01:09:04,630 --> 01:09:04,640
greeks again
 

4041
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:07,510
greeks again
okay and the greeks had this idea of

4042
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:07,520
okay and the greeks had this idea of
 

4043

muses
 

4045
01:09:08,239 --> 01:09:10,309
muses
you know the muses so okay so there are

4046
01:09:10,309 --> 01:09:10,319
you know the muses so okay so there are
 

4047
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:11,669
you know the muses so okay so there are
these things called muses

4048

these things called muses
 

4049
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:13,110
these things called muses
and we tend to think of them as

4050
01:09:13,110 --> 01:09:13,120
and we tend to think of them as
 

4051
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:16,070
and we tend to think of them as
metaphors right but what if they're not

4052
01:09:16,070 --> 01:09:16,080
metaphors right but what if they're not
 

4053
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:17,990
metaphors right but what if they're not
or if they're actually non-human

4054
01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:18,000
or if they're actually non-human

symbolically they tend to communicate
with us in symbols form

4076
01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:38,400
with us in symbols form
 

4077
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:41,030
with us in symbols form
and so music you know symbols we've got

4078
01:09:41,030 --> 01:09:41,040
and so music you know symbols we've got
 

4079
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:42,470
and so music you know symbols we've got
math that are you know it's a symbolic

4080
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:42,480
math that are you know it's a symbolic
 

4081
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:43,110
math that are you know it's a symbolic
language

4082
01:09:43,110 --> 01:09:43,120
language
 

4083
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:45,349
language
and so what so okay so muses are

4084
01:09:45,349 --> 01:09:45,359
and so what so okay so muses are
 

4085
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:46,550
and so what so okay so muses are
probably a good

4086
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:46,560
probably a good
 

4087
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:49,669
probably a good
idea for me of what this would be now

4088
01:09:49,669 --> 01:09:49,679
idea for me of what this would be now
 

4089
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:51,030
idea for me of what this would be now
would muses have

4090
01:09:51,030 --> 01:09:51,040
would muses have
 

4091
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:53,110
would muses have
spaceships you know or those things that

4092
01:09:53,110 --> 01:09:53,120
spaceships you know or those things that
 

4093
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:54,790
spaceships you know or those things that
we call physical

4094
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:54,800
we call physical
 

4095
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:58,149
we call physical
counterparts to what they are um

4096
01:09:58,149 --> 01:09:58,159
counterparts to what they are um
 

4097
01:09:58,159 --> 01:10:00,070
counterparts to what they are um
that's another question altogether but

4098
01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:00,080
that's another question altogether but
 

4099
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:01,270
that's another question altogether but
if you know i i

4100
01:10:01,270 --> 01:10:01,280
if you know i i
 

4101
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,590
if you know i i
now why would i think this because if

4102
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:03,600
now why would i think this because if
 

4103
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,110
now why would i think this because if
you look at the history there are space

4104
01:10:05,110 --> 01:10:05,120
you look at the history there are space
 

4105
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:06,149
you look at the history there are space
programs

4106
01:10:06,149 --> 01:10:06,159
programs
 

4107
01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:08,709
programs
both russian and american you're going

4108
01:10:08,709 --> 01:10:08,719
both russian and american you're going
 

4109
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:10,149
both russian and american you're going
to find some pretty weird stuff

4110
01:10:10,149 --> 01:10:10,159
to find some pretty weird stuff
 

4111
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:12,709
to find some pretty weird stuff
pretty pretty weird history there lex um

4112
01:10:12,709 --> 01:10:12,719
pretty pretty weird history there lex um
 

4113
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:13,270
pretty pretty weird history there lex um
so

4114
01:10:13,270 --> 01:10:13,280
so
 

4115
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:15,750
so
you want to get an idea go back to

4116
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:15,760
you want to get an idea go back to
 

4117
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:17,510
you want to get an idea go back to
tchaikowski and read a little bit about

4118
01:10:17,510 --> 01:10:17,520
tchaikowski and read a little bit about
 

4119
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:18,950
tchaikowski and read a little bit about
what he has to say

4120
01:10:18,950 --> 01:10:18,960
what he has to say
 

4121
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,790
what he has to say
if you look back at the history of our

4122
01:10:20,790 --> 01:10:20,800
if you look back at the history of our
 

4123
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,270
if you look back at the history of our
space programs the viable space programs

4124
01:10:23,270 --> 01:10:23,280
space programs the viable space programs
 

4125
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:25,110
space programs the viable space programs
are both russian and american

4126
01:10:25,110 --> 01:10:25,120
are both russian and american
 

4127
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:29,030
are both russian and american
and each has an amazingly

4128
01:10:29,030 --> 01:10:29,040
and each has an amazingly
 

4129
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:32,550
and each has an amazingly
strange history because uh the founders

4130
01:10:32,550 --> 01:10:32,560
strange history because uh the founders
 

4131
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:34,630
strange history because uh the founders
of the calculations that got us up into

4132
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:34,640
of the calculations that got us up into
 

4133
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:36,630
of the calculations that got us up into
space the rocket scientists basically

4134
01:10:36,630 --> 01:10:36,640
space the rocket scientists basically
 

4135
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,470
space the rocket scientists basically
were doing some pretty weird rituals and

4136
01:10:38,470 --> 01:10:38,480
were doing some pretty weird rituals and
 

4137
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:39,669

parsons on our side
i was out in the desert with people like

4144
01:10:45,270 --> 01:10:45,280
i was out in the desert with people like
 

4145
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:46,630
i was out in the desert with people like
elrond hubbard and

4146
01:10:46,630 --> 01:10:46,640
elrond hubbard and

believing that they were opening
 

4151
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,270
believing that they were opening
stargates and things like that okay

4152
01:10:53,270 --> 01:10:53,280
stargates and things like that okay
 

4153
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:54,310
stargates and things like that okay
that's awesome and they were really

doing that okay
so then you go to um the russian

4158
01:10:58,709 --> 01:10:58,719
so then you go to um the russian
 

4159
01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:02,310
so then you go to um the russian
side and they had a very specific

4160
01:11:02,310 --> 01:11:02,320
side and they had a very specific
 

4161
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:04,709
side and they had a very specific
non-dogmatic according to catholics or

4163
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:06,310
non-dogmatic according to catholics or
orthodox christianity

4164
01:11:06,310 --> 01:11:06,320
orthodox christianity
 

4165
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:08,709
orthodox christianity
idea of what christianity was and they

4166
01:11:08,709 --> 01:11:08,719
idea of what christianity was and they
 

4167
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:10,310
idea of what christianity was and they
believed that they were interacting with

4168

angels
 

4171
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:14,149
angels
okay non-human intelligences so if you

4172
01:11:14,149 --> 01:11:14,159
okay non-human intelligences so if you
 

4173
01:11:14,159 --> 01:11:15,830
okay non-human intelligences so if you
look back and you see muses

4174
01:11:15,830 --> 01:11:15,840
look back and you see muses
 

4175
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,910
look back and you see muses
you know you can contextualize them

4176
01:11:17,910 --> 01:11:17,920
you know you can contextualize them
 

4177
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:19,189
you know you can contextualize them
within this tradition

4178
01:11:19,189 --> 01:11:19,199
within this tradition
 

4179
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:21,030
within this tradition
and so when i started to talk to people

4180
01:11:21,030 --> 01:11:21,040
and so when i started to talk to people
 

4181
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:22,310
and so when i started to talk to people
who were actually in

4182
01:11:22,310 --> 01:11:22,320
who were actually in
 

4183
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,390
who were actually in
the space program and who were in these

4184
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:24,400
the space program and who were in these
 

4185
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:25,350
the space program and who were in these
programs that

4186
01:11:25,350 --> 01:11:25,360
programs that
 

4187
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:27,189
programs that
now the government has said oh yeah we

4188
01:11:27,189 --> 01:11:27,199
now the government has said oh yeah we
 

4189
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:28,470
now the government has said oh yeah we
do have those programs

4190
01:11:28,470 --> 01:11:28,480
do have those programs
 

4191
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:30,870
do have those programs
and they have the same belief structures

4192
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:30,880
and they have the same belief structures
 

4193
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:32,390
and they have the same belief structures
they believe that they were also in

4194
01:11:32,390 --> 01:11:32,400
they believe that they were also in
 

4195
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:33,669
they believe that they were also in
contact with these non-human

4196
01:11:33,669 --> 01:11:33,679
contact with these non-human
 

4197
01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:34,550
contact with these non-human
intelligences

4198
01:11:34,550 --> 01:11:34,560
intelligences
 

4199
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:35,830
intelligences
and they were getting what they called

4200
01:11:35,830 --> 01:11:35,840
and they were getting what they called
 

4201
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:38,149
and they were getting what they called
downloads of information and creating

4202

technologies

4208
01:11:42,229 --> 01:11:42,239
technologies
 

4209
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:44,149
technologies
that were real and they were selling

4210
01:11:44,149 --> 01:11:44,159
that were real and they were selling
 

4211
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:45,510
that were real and they were selling
them on nasdaq for

4212
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:45,520
them on nasdaq for
 

4213
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:47,110
them on nasdaq for
you know a lot of money like you know

4214
01:11:47,110 --> 01:11:47,120
you know a lot of money like you know
 

4215
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:48,310
you know a lot of money like you know
say a hundred million dollars or

4216
01:11:48,310 --> 01:11:48,320
say a hundred million dollars or
 

4217
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:49,189
say a hundred million dollars or
something like that

4218
01:11:49,189 --> 01:11:49,199
something like that
 

4219
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:52,550
something like that
undisclosed amounts um but a lot and

4220
01:11:52,550 --> 01:11:52,560
undisclosed amounts um but a lot and
 

4221
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,709
undisclosed amounts um but a lot and
these things are viable technologies

4222
01:11:54,709 --> 01:11:54,719
these things are viable technologies
 

4223
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:56,390
these things are viable technologies
that we use now and

4224
01:11:56,390 --> 01:11:56,400
that we use now and
 

4225
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:58,630
that we use now and
and they make our lives better and we

4226
01:11:58,630 --> 01:11:58,640
and they make our lives better and we
 

4227
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:00,790
and they make our lives better and we
progress as a species because of them

4228
01:12:00,790 --> 01:12:00,800
progress as a species because of them
 

4229
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:02,870
progress as a species because of them
now that has nothing to do with the

4230
01:12:02,870 --> 01:12:02,880
now that has nothing to do with the
 

4231
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:04,390
now that has nothing to do with the
scientific method

4232
01:12:04,390 --> 01:12:04,400
scientific method
 

4233
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,390
scientific method
as much as i know as much as anybody's

4234
01:12:06,390 --> 01:12:06,400
as much as i know as much as anybody's
 

4235
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:07,990
as much as i know as much as anybody's
going to get angry at me for saying

4236
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:08,000
going to get angry at me for saying
 

4237
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,550
going to get angry at me for saying

about the beginning of the internet and
how a lot of it was based on

4506
01:17:05,910 --> 01:17:05,920
how a lot of it was based on
 

4507
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:09,189
how a lot of it was based on
um basically like

4508
01:17:09,189 --> 01:17:09,199
um basically like
 

4509
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:11,990
um basically like
um neural connection with the internet

4510
01:17:11,990 --> 01:17:12,000
um neural connection with the internet
 

4511
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:12,950
um neural connection with the internet
like somehow

4512
01:17:12,950 --> 01:17:12,960
like somehow
 

4513
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:14,709
like somehow
psychic connection through the internet

4514
01:17:14,709 --> 01:17:14,719
psychic connection through the internet
 

4515
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:16,229
psychic connection through the internet
with others and things like that so the

4516
01:17:16,229 --> 01:17:16,239
with others and things like that so the
 

4517
01:17:16,239 --> 01:17:18,070
with others and things like that so the
mind the brain is a biological neural

4518
01:17:18,070 --> 01:17:18,080
mind the brain is a biological neural
 

4519
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:18,950
mind the brain is a biological neural
network there's a

4520
01:17:18,950 --> 01:17:18,960
network there's a
 

4521
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:20,630
network there's a
uh this connection between division

4522
01:17:20,630 --> 01:17:20,640
uh this connection between division
 

4523
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:22,390
uh this connection between division
neurons and so on and that's what

4524
01:17:22,390 --> 01:17:22,400
neurons and so on and that's what
 

4525
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:25,430
neurons and so on and that's what
ultimately is able to have uh memories

4526
01:17:25,430 --> 01:17:25,440
ultimately is able to have uh memories
 

4527
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:28,070
ultimately is able to have uh memories
and has cognitive ability and is able to

4528
01:17:28,070 --> 01:17:28,080
and has cognitive ability and is able to
 

4529
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:31,430
and has cognitive ability and is able to
uh perceive the world and generate ideas

4530
01:17:31,430 --> 01:17:31,440
uh perceive the world and generate ideas
 

4531
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:34,709
uh perceive the world and generate ideas
and those ideas are then spread on the

4532
01:17:34,709 --> 01:17:34,719
and those ideas are then spread on the
 

4533
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:36,550
and those ideas are then spread on the
internet even from the very early days

4534
01:17:36,550 --> 01:17:36,560
internet even from the very early days
 

4535
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,310
internet even from the very early days
to other humans so it gets

4536
01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:38,320
to other humans so it gets
 

4537
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,870
to other humans so it gets
injected or travels into the brains of

4538
01:17:40,870 --> 01:17:40,880
injected or travels into the brains of
 

4539
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:42,709
injected or travels into the brains of
other humans and that goes around in

4540
01:17:42,709 --> 01:17:42,719
other humans and that goes around in
 

4541
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:43,590
other humans and that goes around in
there and then

4542
01:17:43,590 --> 01:17:43,600
there and then
 

4543
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:45,350
there and then
spits out other stuff and it goes back

4544
01:17:45,350 --> 01:17:45,360
spits out other stuff and it goes back
 

4545
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:46,870
spits out other stuff and it goes back
and forth so it's

4546
01:17:46,870 --> 01:17:46,880
and forth so it's
 

4547
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:48,709
and forth so it's
it's nice to think of the network that's

4548
01:17:48,709 --> 01:17:48,719
it's nice to think of the network that's
 

4549
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:50,870
it's nice to think of the network that's
in our mind individual mind

4550
01:17:50,870 --> 01:17:50,880
in our mind individual mind
 

4551
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:54,550
in our mind individual mind
as i mean um very much

4552
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:54,560
as i mean um very much
 

4553
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:56,470
as i mean um very much
even deeply connected to the network

4554
01:17:56,470 --> 01:17:56,480
even deeply connected to the network
 

4555
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:58,950
even deeply connected to the network
that is the connection between humans

4556
01:17:58,950 --> 01:17:58,960
that is the connection between humans
 

4557
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:00,790
that is the connection between humans
through the internet and so in that

4558
01:18:00,790 --> 01:18:00,800
through the internet and so in that
 

4559
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:01,990
through the internet and so in that
sense

4560
01:18:01,990 --> 01:18:02,000

forms
 

4727
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:51,430
forms
from um in most

from um in most
 

4729
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:54,629
from um in most
formulations of that problem space

uh is still the other it's still the
source of the mysterious except maybe

4734
01:20:59,669 --> 01:20:59,679
source of the mysterious except maybe
 

4735
01:20:59,679 --> 01:21:00,070
source of the mysterious except maybe
like

4736
01:21:00,070 --> 01:21:00,080
like
 

4737
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:03,110
like
seti which is like how can we detect

4738
01:21:03,110 --> 01:21:03,120
seti which is like how can we detect
 

4739
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:04,870
seti which is like how can we detect
signals from far away alien

studies on it of like how can you expand
 

4771
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:39,110
studies on it of like how can you expand
the mind with these tools and what can

4772

through psychedelics and so on and we're
 

4777
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:45,350
through psychedelics and so on and we're
like slowly creeping into the space

4778
01:21:45,350 --> 01:21:45,360
like slowly creeping into the space
 

4779
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:46,790
like slowly creeping into the space
of being able to explore these

4780
01:21:46,790 --> 01:21:46,800
of being able to explore these
 

4781
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:48,790
of being able to explore these
mysterious questions but it's like

4782

mysterious questions but it's like
 

4783
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:51,669
mysterious questions but it's like
it sucks that sometimes a lot of people

4784
01:21:51,669 --> 01:21:51,679
it sucks that sometimes a lot of people
 

4785

meaning sorry uh they have to age out
 

4789
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:01,350
meaning sorry uh they have to age out
like it's like faculty have a

4790
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:01,360
like it's like faculty have a
 

4791
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:04,310
like it's like faculty have a
and people have a fixed set of ideas and

4792
01:22:04,310 --> 01:22:04,320
and people have a fixed set of ideas and
 

4793
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:05,990
and people have a fixed set of ideas and
they stick by them

4794

they stick by them
 

4795
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,229
they stick by them
and in order for new ideas to come in

4796
01:22:08,229 --> 01:22:08,239
and in order for new ideas to come in
 

4797
01:22:08,239 --> 01:22:10,070
and in order for new ideas to come in
then the

4798
01:22:10,070 --> 01:22:10,080
then the
 

4799
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:12,629
then the
young folks have to be born with the pot

4800
01:22:12,629 --> 01:22:12,639
young folks have to be born with the pot
 

4801
01:22:12,639 --> 01:22:14,149
young folks have to be born with the pot
with an open mind the possibility of

4802
01:22:14,149 --> 01:22:14,159
with an open mind the possibility of
 

4803
01:22:14,159 --> 01:22:15,750
with an open mind the possibility of
those ideas and then they have to become

4804
01:22:15,750 --> 01:22:15,760
those ideas and then they have to become
 

4805
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:16,950
those ideas and then they have to become
old enough

4806
01:22:16,950 --> 01:22:16,960
old enough
 

4807
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:19,669
old enough
and get a's in school and whatever to to

4808

uh
 

4811
01:22:20,159 --> 01:22:22,149
uh
to then carry those ideas forward so you

4812
01:22:22,149 --> 01:22:22,159
to then carry those ideas forward so you
 

4813
01:22:22,159 --> 01:22:24,229
to then carry those ideas forward so you
know the acceptance of the

4814
01:22:24,229 --> 01:22:24,239
know the acceptance of the
 

4815
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:26,470
know the acceptance of the
uh exploration of the mysterious takes

4816
01:22:26,470 --> 01:22:26,480
uh exploration of the mysterious takes
 

4817
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:28,390
uh exploration of the mysterious takes
time it's kind of sad

4818
01:22:28,390 --> 01:22:28,400
time it's kind of sad
 

4819

it is sad i agree maybe to
go into my source of passion which is

4822
01:22:35,990 --> 01:22:36,000
go into my source of passion which is
 

4823
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,790
go into my source of passion which is
artificial intelligence what's your

4824
01:22:38,790 --> 01:22:38,800
artificial intelligence what's your
 

4825
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:43,189
artificial intelligence what's your
sense about um the

4826
01:22:43,189 --> 01:22:43,199
sense about um the
 

4827
01:22:43,199 --> 01:22:46,709
sense about um the
the possibility uh like pamela mccordick

4828
01:22:46,709 --> 01:22:46,719
the possibility uh like pamela mccordick
 

4829
01:22:46,719 --> 01:22:49,030
the possibility uh like pamela mccordick
has this quote that i like i talked to

01:22:50,470 --> 01:22:50,480
her a couple years ago
 

4833
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:55,350
her a couple years ago
i guess already in this podcast that

4834
01:22:55,350 --> 01:22:55,360

 

4835
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:57,750

that artificial intelligence began with

4836
01:22:57,750 --> 01:22:57,760
that artificial intelligence began with
 

4837
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:00,390
that artificial intelligence began with
the ancient wish to forge the gods

4838
01:23:00,390 --> 01:23:00,400
the ancient wish to forge the gods
 

4839
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:03,430
the ancient wish to forge the gods
so do you think

4840
01:23:03,430 --> 01:23:03,440
so do you think
 

4841
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:07,590
so do you think
artificial intelligence may become

4842
01:23:07,590 --> 01:23:07,600
artificial intelligence may become
 

4843
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:11,510
artificial intelligence may become
the very kind of gods

4844
01:23:11,510 --> 01:23:11,520
the very kind of gods
 

4845
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:15,030
the very kind of gods
that were at the center of our the

4846
01:23:15,030 --> 01:23:15,040
that were at the center of our the
 

4847
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:18,070
that were at the center of our the
religions of most of our history

4848
01:23:18,070 --> 01:23:18,080
religions of most of our history
 

4849
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:20,070
religions of most of our history
yeah there's a lot there so i'm gonna

4850
01:23:20,070 --> 01:23:20,080
yeah there's a lot there so i'm gonna
 

4851
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:23,430
yeah there's a lot there so i'm gonna
start by addressing this idea

4852
01:23:23,430 --> 01:23:23,440
start by addressing this idea
 

4853
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:26,229
start by addressing this idea
of artificial intelligence being

4854
01:23:26,229 --> 01:23:26,239
of artificial intelligence being
 

4855
01:23:26,239 --> 01:23:27,669
of artificial intelligence being
separate from human

4856
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:27,679
separate from human
 

4857
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:30,950
separate from human
beings okay so that i don't think that's

4858
01:23:30,950 --> 01:23:30,960
beings okay so that i don't think that's
 

4859
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:32,470
beings okay so that i don't think that's
actually

4860
01:23:32,470 --> 01:23:32,480
actually
 

4861
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:35,110
actually
that might happen okay i mean it's

4862
01:23:35,110 --> 01:23:35,120
that might happen okay i mean it's
 

4863

way like you're talking about super
 

4867
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:39,510
way like you're talking about super
artificial intelligence like

4868
01:23:39,510 --> 01:23:39,520
artificial intelligence like
 

4869
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:41,750
artificial intelligence like
autonomous conscious artificial

4870
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:41,760
autonomous conscious artificial
 

4871
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:43,590
autonomous conscious artificial
intelligence okay yeah

4872
01:23:43,590 --> 01:23:43,600
intelligence okay yeah
 

4873
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,910
intelligence okay yeah
something with artificial consciousness

4874
01:23:45,910 --> 01:23:45,920
something with artificial consciousness
 

4875
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:46,950
something with artificial consciousness
first of all i

4876
01:23:46,950 --> 01:23:46,960

it's about human beings
uh becoming two different species okay

4944
01:25:03,510 --> 01:25:03,520
uh becoming two different species okay
 

4945
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:05,590
uh becoming two different species okay
and one of them is created they're

4946
01:25:05,590 --> 01:25:05,600
and one of them is created they're
 

4947
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:06,790
and one of them is created they're
called meta-humans

4948
01:25:06,790 --> 01:25:06,800
called meta-humans
 

4949
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:09,189
called meta-humans
and they start bio-hacking themselves

4950
01:25:09,189 --> 01:25:09,199
and they start bio-hacking themselves
 

4951
01:25:09,199 --> 01:25:09,830
and they start bio-hacking themselves
with

4952
01:25:09,830 --> 01:25:09,840
with
 

4953
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:13,350
with
tech okay sound familiar so they do this

4954
01:25:13,350 --> 01:25:13,360
tech okay sound familiar so they do this
 

4955
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:16,790
tech okay sound familiar so they do this
and they become meta-humans and another

4956
01:25:16,790 --> 01:25:16,800
and they become meta-humans and another
 

4957
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:17,669
and they become meta-humans and another
species

4958
01:25:17,669 --> 01:25:17,679
species
 

4959
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:19,669
species
right and you know just kind of another

4960
01:25:19,669 --> 01:25:19,679
right and you know just kind of another
 

4961
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:20,790
right and you know just kind of another
fork

4962
01:25:20,790 --> 01:25:20,800
fork
 

4963
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:23,830
fork
um such that humans

4964
01:25:23,830 --> 01:25:23,840
um such that humans
 

4965
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:26,470
um such that humans
can barely understand them um because

4966
01:25:26,470 --> 01:25:26,480
can barely understand them um because
 

4967
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:27,510
can barely understand them um because
they're so far

4968
01:25:27,510 --> 01:25:27,520
they're so far
 

4969
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:31,189
they're so far
removed so in a sense are they

4970
01:25:31,189 --> 01:25:31,199
removed so in a sense are they
 

4971
01:25:31,199 --> 01:25:33,189
removed so in a sense are they
gods right no they're meta-humans

4972
01:25:33,189 --> 01:25:33,199
gods right no they're meta-humans
 

4973
01:25:33,199 --> 01:25:34,550
gods right no they're meta-humans
they're super humans they're enhanced

4974
01:25:34,550 --> 01:25:34,560
they're super humans they're enhanced
 

4975
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:35,510
they're super humans they're enhanced
humans okay

4976
01:25:35,510 --> 01:25:35,520
humans okay
 

4977
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:37,750
humans okay
i see that hopefully on the horizon

4978
01:25:37,750 --> 01:25:37,760
i see that hopefully on the horizon
 

4979
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:39,270
i see that hopefully on the horizon
frankly i hope so

4980
01:25:39,270 --> 01:25:39,280
frankly i hope so
 

4981
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:41,510
frankly i hope so
not that we have two species but that we

4982
01:25:41,510 --> 01:25:41,520
not that we have two species but that we
 

4983
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:44,229
not that we have two species but that we
can use our technology or we can

4984
01:25:44,229 --> 01:25:44,239
can use our technology or we can
 

4985
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:47,110
can use our technology or we can
we can become so integrated with our

4986
01:25:47,110 --> 01:25:47,120
we can become so integrated with our
 

4987
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:48,149
we can become so integrated with our
technology

4988
01:25:48,149 --> 01:25:48,159
technology
 

4989
01:25:48,159 --> 01:25:51,350
technology
that we can survive okay we can survive

4990
01:25:51,350 --> 01:25:51,360
that we can survive okay we can survive
 

4991
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:53,590
that we can survive okay we can survive
the radiation in space we can't go

4992
01:25:53,590 --> 01:25:53,600
the radiation in space we can't go
 

4993
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:55,110
the radiation in space we can't go
places now because of the radiation in

4994
01:25:55,110 --> 01:25:55,120
places now because of the radiation in
 

4995
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:55,590
places now because of the radiation in
space

4996
01:25:55,590 --> 01:25:55,600
space
 

4997
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:58,310
space
perhaps we can develop our bodies such

4998
01:25:58,310 --> 01:25:58,320
perhaps we can develop our bodies such
 

4999
01:25:58,320 --> 01:25:59,590
perhaps we can develop our bodies such
that we can survive

5000
01:25:59,590 --> 01:25:59,600
that we can survive
 

5001
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:01,590
that we can survive
the radiation in space so there there's

5002
01:26:01,590 --> 01:26:01,600
the radiation in space so there there's
 

5003
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,510
the radiation in space so there there's
this idea of these meta-humans now

5004
01:26:03,510 --> 01:26:03,520
this idea of these meta-humans now
 

5005
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:07,030
this idea of these meta-humans now
there's also this idea that technology

5006
01:26:07,030 --> 01:26:07,040
there's also this idea that technology
 

5007
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:08,070
there's also this idea that technology
is just another

5008
01:26:08,070 --> 01:26:08,080
is just another
 

5009
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:10,790
is just another
form of humans we've created it right

5010
01:26:10,790 --> 01:26:10,800
form of humans we've created it right
 

5011
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:11,270
form of humans we've created it right
and so

5012
01:26:11,270 --> 01:26:11,280
and so
 

5013
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:14,709
and so
maybe it is bent on surviving thereby

5014
01:26:14,709 --> 01:26:14,719
maybe it is bent on surviving thereby
 

5015
01:26:14,719 --> 01:26:17,510
maybe it is bent on surviving thereby
using us you know kind of as a meme or a

5016
01:26:17,510 --> 01:26:17,520
using us you know kind of as a meme or a
 

5017
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:17,910
using us you know kind of as a meme or a
team

5018
01:26:17,910 --> 01:26:17,920
team
 

5019
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:19,270
team
some people are calling them teams now

5020
01:26:19,270 --> 01:26:19,280
some people are calling them teams now
 

5021
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:21,189
some people are calling them teams now
these self-generating

5022
01:26:21,189 --> 01:26:21,199
these self-generating
 

5023
01:26:21,199 --> 01:26:23,510
these self-generating
uh they're replicating themselves

5024
01:26:23,510 --> 01:26:23,520
uh they're replicating themselves
 

5025
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:24,310
uh they're replicating themselves
through us

5026
01:26:24,310 --> 01:26:24,320
through us
 

5027
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:26,870
through us
okay i see that also and i don't think

5028
01:26:26,870 --> 01:26:26,880
okay i see that also and i don't think
 

5029
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:27,510
okay i see that also and i don't think
that's

5030
01:26:27,510 --> 01:26:27,520
that's
 

5031
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:30,229
that's
terribly bad maybe it's just the way

5032
01:26:30,229 --> 01:26:30,239
terribly bad maybe it's just the way
 

5033
01:26:30,239 --> 01:26:30,790
terribly bad maybe it's just the way
that we

5034
01:26:30,790 --> 01:26:30,800
that we
 

5035
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:33,990
that we
are evolving it doesn't mean that the

5036
01:26:33,990 --> 01:26:34,000
are evolving it doesn't mean that the
 

5037
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,669
are evolving it doesn't mean that the
you know we're evolving all the time

5038
01:26:35,669 --> 01:26:35,679
you know we're evolving all the time
 

5039
01:26:35,679 --> 01:26:37,270
you know we're evolving all the time
like we're taller than we used to be you

5040
01:26:37,270 --> 01:26:37,280
like we're taller than we used to be you
 

5041
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:39,030
like we're taller than we used to be you
know we have different

5042
01:26:39,030 --> 01:26:39,040
know we have different
 

5043
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:42,149
know we have different
skills and you know so i don't see that

5044
01:26:42,149 --> 01:26:42,159
skills and you know so i don't see that
 

5045

skills and you know so i don't see that
as

5046
01:26:42,390 --> 01:26:42,400
as
 

5047
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:43,910
as
as a bad thing i think a lot of people

5048
01:26:43,910 --> 01:26:43,920
as a bad thing i think a lot of people
 

5049
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:46,310
as a bad thing i think a lot of people
see it as if we're not how we are now

5050
01:26:46,310 --> 01:26:46,320
see it as if we're not how we are now
 

5051
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:48,550
see it as if we're not how we are now
it's a tragedy but it's not a tragedy

5052
01:26:48,550 --> 01:26:48,560
it's a tragedy but it's not a tragedy
 

5053
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:50,070
it's a tragedy but it's not a tragedy
how we are now is actually a tragedy

5054
01:26:50,070 --> 01:26:50,080
how we are now is actually a tragedy
 

5055
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:52,629
how we are now is actually a tragedy
for most people alive yeah and we might

5056
01:26:52,629 --> 01:26:52,639
for most people alive yeah and we might
 

5057
01:26:52,639 --> 01:26:54,149
for most people alive yeah and we might
be evolving ways we can't possibly

5058
01:26:54,149 --> 01:26:54,159
be evolving ways we can't possibly
 

5059
01:26:54,159 --> 01:26:55,430
be evolving ways we can't possibly
perceive like you said that

5060
01:26:55,430 --> 01:26:55,440
perceive like you said that
 

5061
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:58,470
perceive like you said that
uh the humans have created twitter

5062
01:26:58,470 --> 01:26:58,480
uh the humans have created twitter
 

5063
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:02,149
uh the humans have created twitter
and twitter may be changing us yes

5064
01:27:02,149 --> 01:27:02,159
and twitter may be changing us yes
 

5065
01:27:02,159 --> 01:27:04,629
and twitter may be changing us yes
in ways that we can't even understand

5066
01:27:04,629 --> 01:27:04,639
in ways that we can't even understand
 

5067
01:27:04,639 --> 01:27:05,990
in ways that we can't even understand
now currently like

5068
01:27:05,990 --> 01:27:06,000
now currently like
 

5069
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,990
now currently like
from a perspective if you look at the

5070
01:27:07,990 --> 01:27:08,000
from a perspective if you look at the
 

5071
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,830
from a perspective if you look at the
entirety of the network of twitter that

5072
01:27:09,830 --> 01:27:09,840
entirety of the network of twitter that
 

5073
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:11,590
entirety of the network of twitter that
might be an organism

5074
01:27:11,590 --> 01:27:11,600
might be an organism
 

5075
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:14,550
might be an organism
that this now the organism understands

5076
01:27:14,550 --> 01:27:14,560
that this now the organism understands
 

5077
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:16,550
that this now the organism understands
what's happening

5078
01:27:16,550 --> 01:27:16,560
what's happening
 

5079
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:20,229
what's happening
from its level of perception

5080
01:27:20,229 --> 01:27:20,239
from its level of perception
 

5081
01:27:20,239 --> 01:27:22,870
from its level of perception
but we humans are just like the cells of

5082
01:27:22,870 --> 01:27:22,880
but we humans are just like the cells of
 

5083
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:24,790
but we humans are just like the cells of
the human body we're interacting

5084
01:27:24,790 --> 01:27:24,800
the human body we're interacting
 

5085
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:27,189
the human body we're interacting
individually but like we're not actually

5086
01:27:27,189 --> 01:27:27,199
individually but like we're not actually
 

5087
01:27:27,199 --> 01:27:28,390
individually but like we're not actually
aware of the big picture that's

5088
01:27:28,390 --> 01:27:28,400
aware of the big picture that's
 

5089
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:28,870
aware of the big picture that's
happening

5090
01:27:28,870 --> 01:27:28,880
happening
 

5091
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:30,470
happening
yeah and we naturally somehow or

5092
01:27:30,470 --> 01:27:30,480
yeah and we naturally somehow or
 

5093
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:31,990
yeah and we naturally somehow or
whatever the force that's creating the

5094
01:27:31,990 --> 01:27:32,000
whatever the force that's creating the
 

5095
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,270
whatever the force that's creating the
entirety of this

5096
01:27:33,270 --> 01:27:33,280
entirety of this
 

5097
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:37,510

5099
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:39,510

one version of it is the evolutionary

5100
01:27:39,510 --> 01:27:39,520
one version of it is the evolutionary
 

5101
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:41,669
one version of it is the evolutionary
process like biological evolution

5102
01:27:41,669 --> 01:27:41,679
process like biological evolution
 

5103
01:27:41,679 --> 01:27:43,590
process like biological evolution
whatever force that is is just creating

5104
01:27:43,590 --> 01:27:43,600
whatever force that is is just creating
 

5105
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:44,950
whatever force that is is just creating
this greater and greater level of

5106
01:27:44,950 --> 01:27:44,960
this greater and greater level of
 

5107
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:47,910
this greater and greater level of
complexity and maybe somehow

5108
01:27:47,910 --> 01:27:47,920
complexity and maybe somehow
 

5109
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:49,590
complexity and maybe somehow
not other kinds of non-human

5110
01:27:49,590 --> 01:27:49,600
not other kinds of non-human
 

5111
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:51,350
not other kinds of non-human
intelligence are involved

01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:40,470
study ufos sure
generally what i found is that

5160
01:28:40,470 --> 01:28:40,480
generally what i found is that
 

5161
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:42,550
generally what i found is that
they are okay so people who are

5162
01:28:42,550 --> 01:28:42,560
they are okay so people who are
 

5163
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:43,910
they are okay so people who are
interested in ufos from like

5164
01:28:43,910 --> 01:28:43,920
interested in ufos from like
 

5165
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:46,390
interested in ufos from like
being a kid you know and seeing some

5166
01:28:46,390 --> 01:28:46,400
being a kid you know and seeing some
 

5167
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:48,149
being a kid you know and seeing some
cool movie like star wars or something

5168
01:28:48,149 --> 01:28:48,159
cool movie like star wars or something
 

5169
01:28:48,159 --> 01:28:49,830
cool movie like star wars or something
and then they become interested and then

5170
01:28:49,830 --> 01:28:49,840
and then they become interested and then
 

5171
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:52,149
and then they become interested and then
they study it as best they can

5172
01:28:52,149 --> 01:28:52,159
they study it as best they can
 

5173
01:28:52,159 --> 01:28:55,990
they study it as best they can
ufos or uaps they're generally

5174
01:28:55,990 --> 01:28:56,000
ufos or uaps they're generally
 

5175
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,790
ufos or uaps they're generally
an honest group of people who are using

5176
01:28:58,790 --> 01:28:58,800
an honest group of people who are using
 

5177
01:28:58,800 --> 01:28:59,830
an honest group of people who are using
their tools

5178
01:28:59,830 --> 01:28:59,840
their tools
 

5179
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:03,110
their tools
there are generally two types of them um

5180
01:29:03,110 --> 01:29:03,120
there are generally two types of them um
 

5181
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:04,470
there are generally two types of them um
there are those who believe in nuts and

5182
01:29:04,470 --> 01:29:04,480
there are those who believe in nuts and
 

5183
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:06,229
there are those who believe in nuts and
bolts like the physical craft

5184
01:29:06,229 --> 01:29:06,239
bolts like the physical craft
 

5185
01:29:06,239 --> 01:29:08,629
bolts like the physical craft
and they believe in that these are

5186
01:29:08,629 --> 01:29:08,639
and they believe in that these are
 

5187
01:29:08,639 --> 01:29:09,990
and they believe in that these are
things from other planets

5188
01:29:09,990 --> 01:29:10,000
things from other planets
 

5189
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:13,270
things from other planets
okay so that's like the e t h hypothesis

5190
01:29:13,270 --> 01:29:13,280
okay so that's like the e t h hypothesis
 

5191
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:16,870
okay so that's like the e t h hypothesis
uh you know um i'm sorry et

5192
01:29:16,870 --> 01:29:16,880
uh you know um i'm sorry et
 

5193
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:19,430
uh you know um i'm sorry et
hypothesis eth is what we call it yeah

5194
01:29:19,430 --> 01:29:19,440
hypothesis eth is what we call it yeah
 

5195
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:20,709
hypothesis eth is what we call it yeah
sorry about that

5196
01:29:20,709 --> 01:29:20,719
sorry about that
 

5197
01:29:20,719 --> 01:29:22,310
sorry about that
so this is like there's an actual

5198
01:29:22,310 --> 01:29:22,320
so this is like there's an actual
 

5199
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:23,830
so this is like there's an actual
spaceship like a phys

5200
01:29:23,830 --> 01:29:23,840
spaceship like a phys
 

5201
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:26,310
spaceship like a phys
like something akin but much more

5202
01:29:26,310 --> 01:29:26,320
like something akin but much more
 

5203
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:28,390
like something akin but much more
advanced than the rockets we use now

5204
01:29:28,390 --> 01:29:28,400
advanced than the rockets we use now
 

5205
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:31,750
advanced than the rockets we use now
yeah and uh some kind of

5206
01:29:31,750 --> 01:29:31,760
yeah and uh some kind of
 

5207
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:34,390
yeah and uh some kind of
not necessarily biological but something

5208
01:29:34,390 --> 01:29:34,400
not necessarily biological but something
 

5209
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:36,709
not necessarily biological but something
like biological organisms that travel on

5210
01:29:36,709 --> 01:29:36,719
like biological organisms that travel on
 

5211
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:37,430
like biological organisms that travel on
these

5212
01:29:37,430 --> 01:29:37,440
these
 

5213
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:39,990
these
species so this would be like what to

5214
01:29:39,990 --> 01:29:40,000
species so this would be like what to
 

5215
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,350
species so this would be like what to
the stars academy

5216
01:29:41,350 --> 01:29:41,360
the stars academy
 

5217
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:43,750
the stars academy
is trying to decipher like how you know

5218
01:29:43,750 --> 01:29:43,760
is trying to decipher like how you know
 

5219
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:44,629
is trying to decipher like how you know
how do they do it

5220
01:29:44,629 --> 01:29:44,639
how do they do it
 

5221
01:29:44,639 --> 01:29:45,750
how do they do it
you know maybe we could use that

5222
01:29:45,750 --> 01:29:45,760
you know maybe we could use that
 

5223
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:48,229
you know maybe we could use that
technology the propulsion and things

5224
01:29:48,229 --> 01:29:48,239
technology the propulsion and things
 

5225
01:29:48,239 --> 01:29:49,510
technology the propulsion and things
like that they look at the rocket

5226
01:29:49,510 --> 01:29:49,520
like that they look at the rocket
 

5227
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:50,790
like that they look at the rocket
technology

5228
01:29:50,790 --> 01:29:50,800
technology
 

5229
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:52,470
technology
okay so there are those and then there

5230
01:29:52,470 --> 01:29:52,480
okay so there are those and then there
 

5231
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:54,189
okay so there are those and then there
are people who believe that it's more

5232
01:29:54,189 --> 01:29:54,199
are people who believe that it's more
 

5233
01:29:54,199 --> 01:29:55,430
are people who believe that it's more
consciousness-based

5234
01:29:55,430 --> 01:29:55,440
consciousness-based
 

5235
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:58,390
consciousness-based
okay so these are your two types of um

5236
01:29:58,390 --> 01:29:58,400
okay so these are your two types of um
 

5237
01:29:58,400 --> 01:29:59,270
okay so these are your two types of um
ufologists

01:30:02,709 --> 01:30:02,719
we know about
 

5243
01:30:02,719 --> 01:30:05,350
we know about
then i found that there are people who

5244
01:30:05,350 --> 01:30:05,360
then i found that there are people who
 

5245

quoted this is a francis bacon thing by
the way it goes back to

5258
01:30:18,310 --> 01:30:18,320
the way it goes back to
 

5259
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:20,470
the way it goes back to
the early modern time period when

5260
01:30:20,470 --> 01:30:20,480
the early modern time period when
 

5261
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:22,550
the early modern time period when
scientists could be killed for basically

5262
01:30:22,550 --> 01:30:22,560
scientists could be killed for basically
 

5263
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:24,070
scientists could be killed for basically
trying to go outside

5264
01:30:24,070 --> 01:30:24,080
trying to go outside

what the church or the government
institution determined was

5268
01:30:28,629 --> 01:30:28,639
institution determined was
 

5269
01:30:28,639 --> 01:30:30,709
institution determined was
dogma and so they had to be really

5270
01:30:30,709 --> 01:30:30,719
dogma and so they had to be really
 

5271
01:30:30,719 --> 01:30:32,310
dogma and so they had to be really
careful so they caught he called

5272
01:30:32,310 --> 01:30:32,320
careful so they caught he called
 

5273
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:34,390

the invisible college so heinek took

5274
01:30:34,390 --> 01:30:34,400
the invisible college so heinek took
 

5275
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:35,430
the invisible college so heinek took
that term

5276
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:35,440
that term
 

5277
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:37,910
that term
and returned reused it or what do you

5278
01:30:37,910 --> 01:30:37,920
and returned reused it or what do you
 

5279
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:39,750
and returned reused it or what do you
call it um repurposed it

5280
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:39,760
call it um repurposed it
 

5281
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:42,390
call it um repurposed it
so that he repurposed it so that they

5282
01:30:42,390 --> 01:30:42,400
so that he repurposed it so that they
 

5283
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:44,149
so that he repurposed it so that they
were still talking to each other though

5284
01:30:44,149 --> 01:30:44,159
were still talking to each other though
 

5285
01:30:44,159 --> 01:30:45,669
were still talking to each other though
so what i found to be the case was that

5286
01:30:45,669 --> 01:30:45,679
so what i found to be the case was that
 

5287
01:30:45,679 --> 01:30:47,590
so what i found to be the case was that
there was a group of people who were

5288
01:30:47,590 --> 01:30:47,600
there was a group of people who were
 

5289
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:48,629
there was a group of people who were
scientists

5290
01:30:48,629 --> 01:30:48,639
scientists
 

5291
01:30:48,639 --> 01:30:51,910
scientists
but were not on the internet you know

5292
01:30:51,910 --> 01:30:51,920
but were not on the internet you know
 

5293
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:54,149
but were not on the internet you know
people today and students of mine in

5294
01:30:54,149 --> 01:30:54,159
people today and students of mine in
 

5295
01:30:54,159 --> 01:30:55,189
people today and students of mine in
particular

5296
01:30:55,189 --> 01:30:55,199
particular
 

5297
01:30:55,199 --> 01:30:57,830
particular
and my own kids actually they think that

5298
01:30:57,830 --> 01:30:57,840
and my own kids actually they think that
 

5299
01:30:57,840 --> 01:30:58,709
and my own kids actually they think that
you only exist

5300
01:30:58,709 --> 01:30:58,719
you only exist
 

5301
01:30:58,719 --> 01:31:00,390
you only exist
if you're on the internet or something

5302
01:31:00,390 --> 01:31:00,400
if you're on the internet or something
 

5303
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:02,229
if you're on the internet or something
only exists if it's on the internet and

5304
01:31:02,229 --> 01:31:02,239
only exists if it's on the internet and
 

5305
01:31:02,239 --> 01:31:04,629
only exists if it's on the internet and
that's of course untrue and so what i

5306
01:31:04,629 --> 01:31:04,639
that's of course untrue and so what i
 

5307
01:31:04,639 --> 01:31:05,669
that's of course untrue and so what i
found was that there are

5308
01:31:05,669 --> 01:31:05,679
found was that there are
 

5309
01:31:05,679 --> 01:31:07,189
found was that there are
most people who are the most powerful

5310
01:31:07,189 --> 01:31:07,199
most people who are the most powerful
 

5311
01:31:07,199 --> 01:31:09,110
most people who are the most powerful
people of our society and are doing

5312
01:31:09,110 --> 01:31:09,120
people of our society and are doing
 

5313
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:09,590
people of our society and are doing
things

invisibles people who are studying
 

5323
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:19,910
invisibles people who are studying
at least their work is invisible you

5324
01:31:19,910 --> 01:31:19,920
at least their work is invisible you
 

5325
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:21,110
at least their work is invisible you
might find them on the internet but

5326
01:31:21,110 --> 01:31:21,120
might find them on the internet but
 

5327
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:21,990
might find them on the internet but
you're going to find that they're part

5328
01:31:21,990 --> 01:31:22,000
you're going to find that they're part
 

5329

and i thought well this is no longer the
invisible college

5346
01:31:36,470 --> 01:31:36,480
invisible college
 

5347
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:37,750

today so we've got some powerful

5472
01:33:43,830 --> 01:33:43,840
today so we've got some powerful
 

5473
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:46,790
today so we've got some powerful
technologies going on here and you know

5474
01:33:46,790 --> 01:33:46,800
technologies going on here and you know
 

5475
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:48,629
technologies going on here and you know
of course we have a military and we have

5476
01:33:48,629 --> 01:33:48,639
of course we have a military and we have
 

5477

military has one um
 

5483
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:56,950
military has one um
and so they're going to um keep these

5484
01:33:56,950 --> 01:33:56,960
and so they're going to um keep these
 

5485
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:58,390
and so they're going to um keep these
the way they should be kept in my

5486
01:33:58,390 --> 01:33:58,400
the way they should be kept in my
 

5487
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:01,189
the way they should be kept in my
interpretation i mean think about it

5488
01:34:01,189 --> 01:34:01,199
interpretation i mean think about it
 

5489
01:34:01,199 --> 01:34:02,629
interpretation i mean think about it
everybody accepts the fact that we have

5490
01:34:02,629 --> 01:34:02,639
everybody accepts the fact that we have
 

5491
01:34:02,639 --> 01:34:04,550

5498
01:34:10,550 --> 01:34:10,560
yeah well that's that's the nature of
 

5499
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:12,149
yeah well that's that's the nature of
things and we can get into that whole

5500
01:34:12,149 --> 01:34:12,159
things and we can get into that whole

question because this space this

5512
01:34:27,350 --> 01:34:27,360
question because this space this
 

5513
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:29,750
question because this space this
particular space of technology

5514
01:34:29,750 --> 01:34:29,760
particular space of technology
 

5515
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:32,229
particular space of technology
there's a gray area that i think is

5516
01:34:32,229 --> 01:34:32,239
there's a gray area that i think is
 

5517
01:34:32,239 --> 01:34:34,550
there's a gray area that i think is
evolving over time

5518
01:34:34,550 --> 01:34:34,560
evolving over time
 

5519
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:37,510

what should and shouldn't be secret i
think there's already technology that

5526
01:34:42,950 --> 01:34:42,960
think there's already technology that
 

5527
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:45,910
think there's already technology that
will enable us to destroy each other and

5528
01:34:45,910 --> 01:34:45,920
will enable us to destroy each other and
 

5529
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:47,510
will enable us to destroy each other and
so there's some sense in which

5530
01:34:47,510 --> 01:34:47,520
so there's some sense in which
 

5531
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:49,430
so there's some sense in which
some technology should be made public

5532
01:34:49,430 --> 01:34:49,440
some technology should be made public
 

5533
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:52,149
some technology should be made public
this is the same discussion of um

5534
01:34:52,149 --> 01:34:52,159
this is the same discussion of um
 

5535
01:34:52,159 --> 01:34:55,109
this is the same discussion of um
you know uh between companies which part

5536
01:34:55,109 --> 01:34:55,119
you know uh between companies which part
 

5537
01:34:55,119 --> 01:34:55,430
you know uh between companies which part
of

5538
01:34:55,430 --> 01:34:55,440
of
 

5539
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:58,470
of
your technology should you make public

5540
01:34:58,470 --> 01:34:58,480
your technology should you make public
 

5541
01:34:58,480 --> 01:34:59,990
your technology should you make public
through like for example academic

5542
01:34:59,990 --> 01:35:00,000
through like for example academic
 

5543
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,229
through like for example academic
publications and all that kind of stuff

5544
01:35:02,229 --> 01:35:02,239
publications and all that kind of stuff
 

5545
01:35:02,239 --> 01:35:04,149
publications and all that kind of stuff
like how the google search engine works

5546
01:35:04,149 --> 01:35:04,159
like how the google search engine works
 

5547
01:35:04,159 --> 01:35:05,830
like how the google search engine works
page rank algorithm or

5548
01:35:05,830 --> 01:35:05,840
page rank algorithm or
 

5549
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:07,990
page rank algorithm or
how the different deep learning like

5550
01:35:07,990 --> 01:35:08,000
how the different deep learning like
 

5551
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,430
how the different deep learning like
there's pretty vibrant

5552
01:35:09,430 --> 01:35:09,440
there's pretty vibrant
 

5553
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:11,430
there's pretty vibrant
machine learning research communities

5554
01:35:11,430 --> 01:35:11,440
machine learning research communities
 

5555
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:13,510
machine learning research communities
within google facebook and so on

5556
01:35:13,510 --> 01:35:13,520
within google facebook and so on
 

5557
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:15,030
within google facebook and so on
and they release a lot of different

5558
01:35:15,030 --> 01:35:15,040
and they release a lot of different
 

5559
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:18,149
and they release a lot of different
ideas it's an interesting question like

5560
01:35:18,149 --> 01:35:18,159
ideas it's an interesting question like
 

5561
01:35:18,159 --> 01:35:20,229
ideas it's an interesting question like
how dangerous is it to release some of

5562
01:35:20,229 --> 01:35:20,239
how dangerous is it to release some of
 

5563
01:35:20,239 --> 01:35:21,990
how dangerous is it to release some of
the ideas i think it's a gray area

5564
01:35:21,990 --> 01:35:22,000
the ideas i think it's a gray area
 

5565
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,830
the ideas i think it's a gray area
that's constantly

5566
01:35:23,830 --> 01:35:23,840
that's constantly
 

5567
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:26,390
that's constantly
changing i do also think it's super

5568
01:35:26,390 --> 01:35:26,400
changing i do also think it's super
 

5569
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:27,350
changing i do also think it's super
interesting

5570
01:35:27,350 --> 01:35:27,360
interesting
 

5571
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:29,030
interesting
i wonder if you could elaborate on a

5572
01:35:29,030 --> 01:35:29,040
i wonder if you could elaborate on a
 

5573
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:32,870
i wonder if you could elaborate on a
little bit that there's this

5574
01:35:32,870 --> 01:35:32,880
little bit that there's this
 

5575
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:35,990
little bit that there's this
gray area between what's actually

5576
01:35:35,990 --> 01:35:36,000
gray area between what's actually
 

5577
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:39,270
gray area between what's actually
real in terms of alien technology

5578
01:35:39,270 --> 01:35:39,280
real in terms of alien technology
 

5579
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:42,310
real in terms of alien technology
and the belief of it

5580
01:35:42,310 --> 01:35:42,320
and the belief of it
 

5581
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:44,229
and the belief of it
when held in the minds of really

5582
01:35:44,229 --> 01:35:44,239
when held in the minds of really
 

5583
01:35:44,239 --> 01:35:45,669
when held in the minds of really
brilliant people

5584
01:35:45,669 --> 01:35:45,679
brilliant people
 

5585
01:35:45,679 --> 01:35:48,070
brilliant people
that they ultimately may produce the

5586
01:35:48,070 --> 01:35:48,080
that they ultimately may produce the
 

5587
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:49,350
that they ultimately may produce the
same kind of result

5588
01:35:49,350 --> 01:35:49,360
same kind of result
 

5589
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:52,870
same kind of result
in terms of being able to create new

5590
01:35:52,870 --> 01:35:52,880
in terms of being able to create new
 

5591
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:56,709
in terms of being able to create new
technologies that are human usable

5592
01:35:56,709 --> 01:35:56,719
technologies that are human usable
 

5593
01:35:56,719 --> 01:36:01,030
technologies that are human usable
like is there um

5594
01:36:01,030 --> 01:36:01,040
like is there um
 

5595
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:04,229
like is there um
in your mind they're one and the same as

5596
01:36:04,229 --> 01:36:04,239
in your mind they're one and the same as
 

5597
01:36:04,239 --> 01:36:05,590
in your mind they're one and the same as
like believing

5598
01:36:05,590 --> 01:36:05,600
like believing
 

5599
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:09,270
like believing
in alien craft and uh

5600
01:36:09,270 --> 01:36:09,280
in alien craft and uh
 

5601
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:11,109
in alien craft and uh
actually being in possession of an alien

5602
01:36:11,109 --> 01:36:11,119
actually being in possession of an alien
 

5603
01:36:11,119 --> 01:36:13,910
actually being in possession of an alien
craft i don't think they're the same no

5604
01:36:13,910 --> 01:36:13,920
craft i don't think they're the same no
 

5605
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:17,669
craft i don't think they're the same no
belief is powerful okay um

5606
01:36:17,669 --> 01:36:17,679
belief is powerful okay um
 

5607
01:36:17,679 --> 01:36:20,470
belief is powerful okay um
in new age communities you know people

5608
01:36:20,470 --> 01:36:20,480
in new age communities you know people
 

5609
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:20,790
in new age communities you know people
think

5610
01:36:20,790 --> 01:36:20,800
think
 

5611
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:22,870
think
thoughts are things okay that's been

5612
01:36:22,870 --> 01:36:22,880
thoughts are things okay that's been
 

5613
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:24,149
thoughts are things okay that's been
said you know thoughts are things

5614
01:36:24,149 --> 01:36:24,159
said you know thoughts are things
 

5615
01:36:24,159 --> 01:36:25,590
said you know thoughts are things
you can make them happen kind of thing

5616
01:36:25,590 --> 01:36:25,600
you can make them happen kind of thing
 

5617
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:28,229
you can make them happen kind of thing
believe in them enough it is true that

5618
01:36:28,229 --> 01:36:28,239
believe in them enough it is true that
 

5619
01:36:28,239 --> 01:36:31,430
believe in them enough it is true that
if i believe i can run

5620
01:36:31,430 --> 01:36:31,440
if i believe i can run
 

5621
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:34,470
if i believe i can run
a 540 mile i'll do it okay and i

5622
01:36:34,470 --> 01:36:34,480
a 540 mile i'll do it okay and i
 

5623
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:35,750
a 540 mile i'll do it okay and i
probably will do it and i've done it

5624
01:36:35,750 --> 01:36:35,760
probably will do it and i've done it
 

5625
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:36,870
probably will do it and i've done it
before actually

5626
01:36:36,870 --> 01:36:36,880
before actually
 

5627
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:40,550
before actually
um much younger but i did it

5628
01:36:40,550 --> 01:36:40,560
um much younger but i did it
 

5629
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:41,990
um much younger but i did it
so but my coach is the one that

5630
01:36:41,990 --> 01:36:42,000
so but my coach is the one that
 

5631
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,070
so but my coach is the one that
instilled that belief in me right

5632
01:36:44,070 --> 01:36:44,080
instilled that belief in me right
 

5633
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:47,350
instilled that belief in me right
and so but can i run like a one minute

5634
01:36:47,350 --> 01:36:47,360
and so but can i run like a one minute
 

5635
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:47,990
and so but can i run like a one minute
mile

5636
01:36:47,990 --> 01:36:48,000
mile
 

5637
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:51,189
mile
no okay so i guess does that answer your

5638
01:36:51,189 --> 01:36:51,199
no okay so i guess does that answer your
 

5639
01:36:51,199 --> 01:36:53,270
no okay so i guess does that answer your
question like there's only so far belief

5640
01:36:53,270 --> 01:36:53,280
question like there's only so far belief
 

5641
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:53,910
question like there's only so far belief
goes

5642
01:36:53,910 --> 01:36:53,920
goes
 

5643
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:56,790
goes
in generating reality well yeah i mean i

5644
01:36:56,790 --> 01:36:56,800
in generating reality well yeah i mean i
 

5645
01:36:56,800 --> 01:36:58,070
in generating reality well yeah i mean i
guess that's what uh

5646
01:36:58,070 --> 01:36:58,080
guess that's what uh
 

5647
01:36:58,080 --> 01:37:01,030
guess that's what uh
just having listened to jacques valet it

5648
01:37:01,030 --> 01:37:01,040
just having listened to jacques valet it
 

5649
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:02,950
just having listened to jacques valet it
seemed like

5650
01:37:02,950 --> 01:37:02,960
seemed like
 

5651
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:06,390
seemed like
reality is not was not as important

5652
01:37:06,390 --> 01:37:06,400
reality is not was not as important
 

5653
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:08,229
reality is not was not as important
for the scientific exploration of the

5654
01:37:08,229 --> 01:37:08,239
for the scientific exploration of the
 

5655
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:10,790
for the scientific exploration of the
concept of alien technology

5656
01:37:10,790 --> 01:37:10,800
concept of alien technology
 

5657
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:12,229
concept of alien technology
i could be wrong but this is what i

5658
01:37:12,229 --> 01:37:12,239
i could be wrong but this is what i
 

5659
01:37:12,239 --> 01:37:14,070
i could be wrong but this is what i
think jacques is getting at there are

5660
01:37:14,070 --> 01:37:14,080
think jacques is getting at there are
 

5661
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:16,149
think jacques is getting at there are
other ways to access

5662
01:37:16,149 --> 01:37:16,159
other ways to access
 

5663
01:37:16,159 --> 01:37:19,350
other ways to access
places in reality other than what we

5664
01:37:19,350 --> 01:37:19,360
places in reality other than what we
 

5665
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:20,550
places in reality other than what we
consider to be physical

5666
01:37:20,550 --> 01:37:20,560
consider to be physical
 

5667
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:23,590
consider to be physical
right that's what is consciousness okay

5668
01:37:23,590 --> 01:37:23,600
right that's what is consciousness okay
 

5669
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:26,790
right that's what is consciousness okay
so in like i said so religious studies

5670
01:37:26,790 --> 01:37:26,800
so in like i said so religious studies
 

5671
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:29,350
so in like i said so religious studies
is among other things it's it's looking

5672
01:37:29,350 --> 01:37:29,360
is among other things it's it's looking
 

5673
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:31,109
is among other things it's it's looking
at visionary experiences

5674
01:37:31,109 --> 01:37:31,119
at visionary experiences
 

5675
01:37:31,119 --> 01:37:32,709
at visionary experiences
all right so people do have visionary

5676
01:37:32,709 --> 01:37:32,719
all right so people do have visionary
 

5677
01:37:32,719 --> 01:37:35,030
all right so people do have visionary
experiences they did without drugs

5678
01:37:35,030 --> 01:37:35,040
experiences they did without drugs
 

5679
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:37,030
experiences they did without drugs
you know they did with drugs they do

5680
01:37:37,030 --> 01:37:37,040
you know they did with drugs they do
 

5681
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:38,709
you know they did with drugs they do
with drugs they do

5682
01:37:38,709 --> 01:37:38,719
with drugs they do
 

5683
01:37:38,719 --> 01:37:41,030
with drugs they do
many have them without drugs today and

5684
01:37:41,030 --> 01:37:41,040
many have them without drugs today and
 

5685
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:42,629
many have them without drugs today and
oftentimes those visionary

5686
01:37:42,629 --> 01:37:42,639
oftentimes those visionary
 

5687
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:46,390
oftentimes those visionary
experiences um correspond to each other

5688
01:37:46,390 --> 01:37:46,400
experiences um correspond to each other
 

5689
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:48,390
experiences um correspond to each other

people
and things like that they saw them and

6078
01:44:45,830 --> 01:44:45,840
and things like that they saw them and
 

6079
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:46,310
and things like that they saw them and
they're not

6080
01:44:46,310 --> 01:44:46,320
they're not
 

6081
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:47,590
they're not
i don't believe they're making it up

6082
01:44:47,590 --> 01:44:47,600
i don't believe they're making it up
 

6083
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:50,229
i don't believe they're making it up
okay um i do think that this is being

6084
01:44:50,229 --> 01:44:50,239
okay um i do think that this is being
 

6085
01:44:50,239 --> 01:44:53,910
okay um i do think that this is being
this is being used uh as a spin

6086
01:44:53,910 --> 01:44:53,920
this is being used uh as a spin
 

6087
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:55,669
this is being used uh as a spin
okay and i'm just gonna say that and the

6088
01:44:55,669 --> 01:44:55,679
okay and i'm just gonna say that and the
 

6089
01:44:55,679 --> 01:44:57,830
okay and i'm just gonna say that and the
reason i think that is this is because

6090
01:44:57,830 --> 01:44:57,840
reason i think that is this is because
 

6091
01:44:57,840 --> 01:44:59,590
reason i think that is this is because
at the time it was released i was still

6092
01:44:59,590 --> 01:44:59,600
at the time it was released i was still
 

6093
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:01,189
at the time it was released i was still
in touch with many people

6094
01:45:01,189 --> 01:45:01,199
in touch with many people
 

6095
01:45:01,199 --> 01:45:04,310
in touch with many people
who were among the ufo fight club and so

6096
01:45:04,310 --> 01:45:04,320
who were among the ufo fight club and so
 

6097
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:04,870
who were among the ufo fight club and so
they had

6098
01:45:04,870 --> 01:45:04,880
they had
 

6099
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:07,109
they had
intimate knowledge of these things and

6100
01:45:07,109 --> 01:45:07,119
intimate knowledge of these things and
 

6101
01:45:07,119 --> 01:45:09,350
intimate knowledge of these things and
the first thing they said was

6102
01:45:09,350 --> 01:45:09,360
the first thing they said was
 

6103
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:12,070
the first thing they said was
um we have satellites that can read the

6104
01:45:12,070 --> 01:45:12,080
um we have satellites that can read the
 

6105
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:13,910
um we have satellites that can read the
news on your phone when you're reading

6106
01:45:13,910 --> 01:45:13,920
news on your phone when you're reading
 

6107
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:14,390
news on your phone when you're reading
it

6108
01:45:14,390 --> 01:45:14,400
it
 

6109
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:16,950
it
so we've got better footage than this

6110
01:45:16,950 --> 01:45:16,960
so we've got better footage than this
 

6111
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:18,070
so we've got better footage than this
and this is not

6112
01:45:18,070 --> 01:45:18,080
and this is not
 

6113
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:20,070
and this is not
good footage at all therefore they

6114
01:45:20,070 --> 01:45:20,080
good footage at all therefore they
 

6115
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:21,189
good footage at all therefore they
believe that it was

6116
01:45:21,189 --> 01:45:21,199
believe that it was
 

6117
01:45:21,199 --> 01:45:23,270
believe that it was
authentic footage that had been doctored

6118
01:45:23,270 --> 01:45:23,280
authentic footage that had been doctored
 

6119
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:24,950
authentic footage that had been doctored
up now

6120
01:45:24,950 --> 01:45:24,960
up now
 

6121
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:28,310
up now
why i don't know why um

6122
01:45:28,310 --> 01:45:28,320
why i don't know why um
 

6123

to do with ufos
 

6665
01:54:33,679 --> 01:54:36,149
to do with ufos
so we were out there we had specially

01:54:36,149 --> 01:54:36,159
so we were out there we had specially
 

6667

configured
 

6669
01:54:38,080 --> 01:54:41,510
configured
metal detectors for these metals and

6670
01:54:41,510 --> 01:54:41,520
metal detectors for these metals and
 

6671
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:44,709
metal detectors for these metals and
we did find these okay and

6672
01:54:44,709 --> 01:54:44,719
we did find these okay and
 

6673
01:54:44,719 --> 01:54:46,790
we did find these okay and
they've since been studied by various

6674
01:54:46,790 --> 01:54:46,800
they've since been studied by various
 

6675
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:49,189
they've since been studied by various
scientists materials scientists so forth

the joe rogan show um there are no
 

6683
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:02,310
the joe rogan show um there are no
anomalies so there are we scientists

6684
01:55:02,310 --> 01:55:02,320
anomalies so there are we scientists
 

6685
01:55:02,320 --> 01:55:04,229
anomalies so there are we scientists
don't i'm not a scientist so

6686
01:55:04,229 --> 01:55:04,239
don't i'm not a scientist so
 

6687
01:55:04,239 --> 01:55:07,430
don't i'm not a scientist so
i can't weigh in on whether i just

believe because
 

6693
01:55:10,480 --> 01:55:12,950
believe because
they're well-known scientists what do

the ufo
and it becomes ground zero for this new

6760
01:56:28,790 --> 01:56:28,800
and it becomes ground zero for this new
 

6761
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:30,070

just another person that seems to be a
 

7143
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:56,550
just another person that seems to be a
key figure in this

7144
02:02:56,550 --> 02:02:56,560
key figure in this
 

7145
02:02:56,560 --> 02:02:59,109
key figure in this
in the mythology of this is bob lazar

on the spacecraft that was in
 

7167
02:03:23,119 --> 02:03:25,910
on the spacecraft that was in
you know that was captured and so on in

order to
try to reverse engineer some of the

02:03:29,030 --> 02:03:29,040
try to reverse engineer some of the
 

7173
02:03:29,040 --> 02:03:30,629
try to reverse engineer some of the
technology in terms of the propulsion

7174

technology in terms of the propulsion
 

7175

7235
02:04:48,960 --> 02:04:50,709
so many people you know this is what
happens to people who have experiences

7236
02:04:50,709 --> 02:04:50,719
happens to people who have experiences
 

7237
02:04:50,719 --> 02:04:51,750
happens to people who have experiences
like this

7238
02:04:51,750 --> 02:04:51,760
like this
 

7239
02:04:51,760 --> 02:04:55,430
like this
they're questioned their reputations are

7240
02:04:55,430 --> 02:04:55,440
they're questioned their reputations are
 

7241
02:04:55,440 --> 02:04:56,629
they're questioned their reputations are
put on the line

7242
02:04:56,629 --> 02:04:56,639
put on the line
 

7243
02:04:56,639 --> 02:04:59,589
put on the line
in some instances their their

7244
02:04:59,589 --> 02:04:59,599
in some instances their their
 

7245
02:04:59,599 --> 02:05:00,550
in some instances their their
reputations are

7246
02:05:00,550 --> 02:05:00,560
reputations are
 

7247
02:05:00,560 --> 02:05:03,350
reputations are
manipulated on purpose to make them look

7248
02:05:03,350 --> 02:05:03,360
manipulated on purpose to make them look
 

7249
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:04,709
manipulated on purpose to make them look
uncredible

7250
02:05:04,709 --> 02:05:04,719
uncredible
 

7251
02:05:04,719 --> 02:05:08,310
uncredible
to me as a scientist it's just

7252
02:05:08,310 --> 02:05:08,320
to me as a scientist it's just
 

7253
02:05:08,320 --> 02:05:12,149
to me as a scientist it's just
inspiring that it kind of gives this

7254
02:05:12,149 --> 02:05:12,159
inspiring that it kind of gives this
 

7255
02:05:12,159 --> 02:05:13,910
inspiring that it kind of gives this
kind of

7256
02:05:13,910 --> 02:05:13,920
kind of
 

7257
02:05:13,920 --> 02:05:16,069
kind of
i'm not even thinking of it is there an

7258
02:05:16,069 --> 02:05:16,079
i'm not even thinking of it is there an
 

7259
02:05:16,079 --> 02:05:17,350
i'm not even thinking of it is there an
actual spacecraft

7260
02:05:17,350 --> 02:05:17,360
actual spacecraft
 

7261
02:05:17,360 --> 02:05:19,109
actual spacecraft
being hidden somewhere and studied and

7262
02:05:19,109 --> 02:05:19,119
being hidden somewhere and studied and
 

7263
02:05:19,119 --> 02:05:21,430
being hidden somewhere and studied and
so on i'm thinking of it like

7264
02:05:21,430 --> 02:05:21,440
so on i'm thinking of it like
 

7265
02:05:21,440 --> 02:05:23,030
so on i'm thinking of it like
i don't know it's a thing that gives you

7266
02:05:23,030 --> 02:05:23,040
i don't know it's a thing that gives you
 

7267
02:05:23,040 --> 02:05:24,870
i don't know it's a thing that gives you
a spark of a dream you know

7268
02:05:24,870 --> 02:05:24,880
a spark of a dream you know
 

7269
02:05:24,880 --> 02:05:27,910
a spark of a dream you know
to as a reminder that

7270
02:05:27,910 --> 02:05:27,920
to as a reminder that
 

7271
02:05:27,920 --> 02:05:30,950
to as a reminder that
we don't understand most of how this

7272
02:05:30,950 --> 02:05:30,960
we don't understand most of how this
 

7273
02:05:30,960 --> 02:05:32,470
we don't understand most of how this
world works

7274
02:05:32,470 --> 02:05:32,480
world works
 

7275
02:05:32,480 --> 02:05:35,510
world works
and then we can build technologies that

7276
02:05:35,510 --> 02:05:35,520
and then we can build technologies that
 

7277
02:05:35,520 --> 02:05:36,950
and then we can build technologies that
aren't here today

7278
02:05:36,950 --> 02:05:36,960
aren't here today
 

7279
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:38,550
aren't here today
that will allow us to understand much

7280
02:05:38,550 --> 02:05:38,560
that will allow us to understand much
 

7281
02:05:38,560 --> 02:05:40,390
that will allow us to understand much
more and that it's kind of like almost

7282
02:05:40,390 --> 02:05:40,400
more and that it's kind of like almost
 

7283
02:05:40,400 --> 02:05:41,350
more and that it's kind of like almost
like a feeling

7284
02:05:41,350 --> 02:05:41,360
like a feeling
 

7285
02:05:41,360 --> 02:05:44,149
like a feeling
that it provides and it inspires and

7286
02:05:44,149 --> 02:05:44,159
that it provides and it inspires and
 

7287
02:05:44,159 --> 02:05:45,270
that it provides and it inspires and
makes you dream

7288
02:05:45,270 --> 02:05:45,280
makes you dream
 

7289
02:05:45,280 --> 02:05:46,790
makes you dream

that story to me the myth is more

7306
02:06:02,870 --> 02:06:02,880
that story to me the myth is more
 

7307
02:06:02,880 --> 02:06:03,750
that story to me the myth is more
interesting

7308
02:06:03,750 --> 02:06:03,760
interesting
 

7309
02:06:03,760 --> 02:06:06,310
interesting
not interesting actually but inspiring

7310
02:06:06,310 --> 02:06:06,320
not interesting actually but inspiring
 

7311
02:06:06,320 --> 02:06:06,950
not interesting actually but inspiring
yes

7312
02:06:06,950 --> 02:06:06,960
yes
 

7313
02:06:06,960 --> 02:06:09,350
yes
because inspiring you're suggesting that

7314
02:06:09,350 --> 02:06:09,360
because inspiring you're suggesting that
 

7315
02:06:09,360 --> 02:06:11,830
because inspiring you're suggesting that
the myth inspires you to create reality

7316
02:06:11,830 --> 02:06:11,840
the myth inspires you to create reality
 

7317
02:06:11,840 --> 02:06:14,950
the myth inspires you to create reality
yes yeah i think that's that's true

7318
02:06:14,950 --> 02:06:14,960
yes yeah i think that's that's true
 

7319
02:06:14,960 --> 02:06:17,589
yes yeah i think that's that's true
so even if it's like not real it doesn't

7320
02:06:17,589 --> 02:06:17,599
so even if it's like not real it doesn't
 

7321
02:06:17,599 --> 02:06:19,270
so even if it's like not real it doesn't
matter

7322
02:06:19,270 --> 02:06:19,280

02:10:02,639 --> 02:10:05,109
and we're forced to live
a different material existence than we

7544
02:10:05,109 --> 02:10:05,119
a different material existence than we
 

7545
02:10:05,119 --> 02:10:06,470
a different material existence than we
live have lived before

7546

so in in my sense i think that if it's

7548
02:10:09,270 --> 02:10:09,280
so in in my sense i think that if it's
 

7549
02:10:09,280 --> 02:10:11,030
so in in my sense i think that if it's
an art project it's a really good one

7550
02:10:11,030 --> 02:10:11,040
an art project it's a really good one
 

7551
02:10:11,040 --> 02:10:15,270
an art project it's a really good one
for that so it's just i like that uh

7552
02:10:15,270 --> 02:10:15,280
for that so it's just i like that uh
 

7553
02:10:15,280 --> 02:10:16,950
for that so it's just i like that uh
that meaning of this it's a screen and

7554
02:10:16,950 --> 02:10:16,960
that meaning of this it's a screen and
 

7555
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:19,350
that meaning of this it's a screen and
the screen could take all

7556
02:10:19,350 --> 02:10:19,360
the screen could take all
 

7557
02:10:19,360 --> 02:10:21,270
the screen could take all
all kinds of forms i mean uh our

7558
02:10:21,270 --> 02:10:21,280
all kinds of forms i mean uh our
 

7559
02:10:21,280 --> 02:10:23,750
all kinds of forms i mean uh our
perception system in a sense is a screen

7560
02:10:23,750 --> 02:10:23,760
perception system in a sense is a screen
 

7561
02:10:23,760 --> 02:10:27,109
perception system in a sense is a screen
uh between reality and our mind

7562
02:10:27,109 --> 02:10:27,119
uh between reality and our mind
 

7563
02:10:27,119 --> 02:10:28,870
uh between reality and our mind
this the screen of the computer is the

7564
02:10:28,870 --> 02:10:28,880
this the screen of the computer is the
 

7565
02:10:28,880 --> 02:10:30,310
this the screen of the computer is the
screen

7566
02:10:30,310 --> 02:10:30,320
screen
 

7567
02:10:30,320 --> 02:10:33,109
screen
the the virtual reality worlds that we

7568
02:10:33,109 --> 02:10:33,119
the the virtual reality worlds that we
 

7569
02:10:33,119 --> 02:10:33,750
the the virtual reality worlds that we
might be

7570
02:10:33,750 --> 02:10:33,760
might be
 

7571
02:10:33,760 --> 02:10:36,709
might be
one day living in it there will be an

7572
02:10:36,709 --> 02:10:36,719
one day living in it there will be an
 

7573
02:10:36,719 --> 02:10:38,390
one day living in it there will be an
interface i mean ultimately it's about

7574
02:10:38,390 --> 02:10:38,400
interface i mean ultimately it's about
 

7575
02:10:38,400 --> 02:10:39,589
interface i mean ultimately it's about
the interface

7576
02:10:39,589 --> 02:10:39,599
the interface
 

7577
02:10:39,599 --> 02:10:42,149
the interface
that's interesting it's an interface to

7578
02:10:42,149 --> 02:10:42,159
that's interesting it's an interface to
 

7579
02:10:42,159 --> 02:10:43,270
that's interesting it's an interface to
another

7580
02:10:43,270 --> 02:10:43,280
another
 

7581
02:10:43,280 --> 02:10:46,310
another
another world of ideas it's also a

7582
02:10:46,310 --> 02:10:46,320
another world of ideas it's also a
 

7583
02:10:46,320 --> 02:10:48,790
another world of ideas it's also a
material change

7584
02:10:48,790 --> 02:10:48,800

changed so much about the offloading of

7616
02:11:24,470 --> 02:11:24,480
changed so much about the offloading of
 

7617
02:11:24,480 --> 02:11:25,669
changed so much about the offloading of
our knowledge

7618
02:11:25,669 --> 02:11:25,679
our knowledge
 

7619
02:11:25,679 --> 02:11:28,629
our knowledge
the way we interact with knowledge i

02:11:28,629 --> 02:11:28,639
the way we interact with knowledge i
 

7621
02:11:28,639 --> 02:11:30,550
the way we interact with knowledge i
mean it offloaded

7622
02:11:30,550 --> 02:11:30,560
mean it offloaded
 

7623
02:11:30,560 --> 02:11:33,750
mean it offloaded
our long-term memory about facts

onto digital formats so in the sense
 

7627
02:11:36,159 --> 02:11:38,229
onto digital formats so in the sense
that expanded our mind

7628
02:11:38,229 --> 02:11:38,239
that expanded our mind
 

7629
02:11:38,239 --> 02:11:41,189
that expanded our mind
it's kind of interesting i'd i'd be

7630
02:11:41,189 --> 02:11:41,199
it's kind of interesting i'd i'd be
 

7631
02:11:41,199 --> 02:11:42,629
it's kind of interesting i'd i'd be
curious to see if he has just one

7632
02:11:42,629 --> 02:11:42,639
curious to see if he has just one
 

7633
02:11:42,639 --> 02:11:43,990
curious to see if he has just one
interpretation

7634
02:11:43,990 --> 02:11:44,000
interpretation
 

7635
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,709
interpretation
i wonder if he corresponded with him yes

7636
02:11:46,709 --> 02:11:46,719
i wonder if he corresponded with him yes
 

7637
02:11:46,719 --> 02:11:47,109
i wonder if he corresponded with him yes
so

7638

so
 

7639
02:11:47,119 --> 02:11:48,149
so
over the years he and i have

7640
02:11:48,149 --> 02:11:48,159
over the years he and i have
 

7641
02:11:48,159 --> 02:11:50,229
over the years he and i have
corresponded um and

7642

corresponded um and
 

7643
02:11:50,239 --> 02:11:51,910
corresponded um and
i told him i said look i'm going to be

i told him i said look i'm going to be
 

7645
02:11:51,920 --> 02:11:53,589
i told him i said look i'm going to be
using this in my book so i think you

7646
02:11:53,589 --> 02:11:53,599
using this in my book so i think you
 

7647
02:11:53,599 --> 02:11:55,189
using this in my book so i think you
should read what i say

7648
02:11:55,189 --> 02:11:55,199
should read what i say
 

7649
02:11:55,199 --> 02:11:58,470
should read what i say
and he was he of course wanted to see it

7650
02:11:58,470 --> 02:11:58,480
and he was he of course wanted to see it
 

7651
02:11:58,480 --> 02:11:59,910
and he was he of course wanted to see it
so what do you think about your book

7652
02:11:59,910 --> 02:11:59,920
so what do you think about your book
 

7653
02:11:59,920 --> 02:12:01,830
so what do you think about your book
then you get it yesterday yeah oh yeah

7654
02:12:01,830 --> 02:12:01,840
then you get it yesterday yeah oh yeah
 

7655
02:12:01,840 --> 02:12:02,310
then you get it yesterday yeah oh yeah
so

7656
02:12:02,310 --> 02:12:02,320
so
 

7657
02:12:02,320 --> 02:12:05,510
so
um he is a non-believer in

7658
02:12:05,510 --> 02:12:05,520
um he is a non-believer in
 

7659
02:12:05,520 --> 02:12:08,950
um he is a non-believer in
alien intelligence and ufos but he

7660
02:12:08,950 --> 02:12:08,960
alien intelligence and ufos but he
 

7661
02:12:08,960 --> 02:12:12,629
alien intelligence and ufos but he
and that's fine but i i still agree with

7662
02:12:12,629 --> 02:12:12,639
and that's fine but i i still agree with
 

7663
02:12:12,639 --> 02:12:14,470
and that's fine but i i still agree with
him that the meaning of the monolith was

7664
02:12:14,470 --> 02:12:14,480
him that the meaning of the monolith was
 

7665
02:12:14,480 --> 02:12:15,350
him that the meaning of the monolith was
the screen

7666
02:12:15,350 --> 02:12:15,360
the screen
 

7667
02:12:15,360 --> 02:12:18,550
the screen
but that doesn't mean the screen isn't

7668
02:12:18,550 --> 02:12:18,560
but that doesn't mean the screen isn't
 

7669
02:12:18,560 --> 02:12:21,189
but that doesn't mean the screen isn't
like what david bowie said right so it's

7670
02:12:21,189 --> 02:12:21,199
like what david bowie said right so it's
 

7671
02:12:21,199 --> 02:12:21,589
like what david bowie said right so it's
not

7672
02:12:21,589 --> 02:12:21,599
not
 

7673
02:12:21,599 --> 02:12:23,830
not
exclusive so i could still use his

7674
02:12:23,830 --> 02:12:23,840
exclusive so i could still use his
 

7675
02:12:23,840 --> 02:12:25,270
exclusive so i could still use his
theory but differ from

7676
02:12:25,270 --> 02:12:25,280
theory but differ from
 

7677
02:12:25,280 --> 02:12:27,830
theory but differ from
the conclusions in terms of non-believer

7678
02:12:27,830 --> 02:12:27,840
the conclusions in terms of non-believer
 

7679
02:12:27,840 --> 02:12:29,350
the conclusions in terms of non-believer
and believer

7680
02:12:29,350 --> 02:12:29,360
and believer
 

7681
02:12:29,360 --> 02:12:32,950
and believer
there's um when you say believer

7682
02:12:32,950 --> 02:12:32,960
there's um when you say believer
 

7683
02:12:32,960 --> 02:12:37,510
there's um when you say believer
you also are kind of implying this um

7684
02:12:37,510 --> 02:12:37,520
you also are kind of implying this um
 

7685
02:12:37,520 --> 02:12:40,629
you also are kind of implying this um
the the idea that aliens have visited

7686
02:12:40,629 --> 02:12:40,639
the the idea that aliens have visited
 

7687
02:12:40,639 --> 02:12:42,709
the the idea that aliens have visited
or had made direct contact with humans

7688
02:12:42,709 --> 02:12:42,719
or had made direct contact with humans
 

7689
02:12:42,719 --> 02:12:45,430
or had made direct contact with humans
in some form

7690
02:12:45,430 --> 02:12:45,440
in some form
 

7691
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:48,550
in some form
there's also the the exploration and the

7692
02:12:48,550 --> 02:12:48,560
there's also the the exploration and the
 

7693
02:12:48,560 --> 02:12:49,750
there's also the the exploration and the
idea

7694
02:12:49,750 --> 02:12:49,760
idea
 

7695
02:12:49,760 --> 02:12:52,470
idea
of just alien intelligent intelligence

7696
02:12:52,470 --> 02:12:52,480
of just alien intelligent intelligence
 

7697
02:12:52,480 --> 02:12:52,790
of just alien intelligent intelligence
is

7698
02:12:52,790 --> 02:12:52,800
is
 

7699
02:12:52,800 --> 02:12:55,430
is
out there in the universe you know the

7700
02:12:55,430 --> 02:12:55,440
out there in the universe you know the
 

7701
02:12:55,440 --> 02:12:56,709
out there in the universe you know the
drake equation

7702
02:12:56,709 --> 02:12:56,719
drake equation
 

7703
02:12:56,719 --> 02:12:59,830

estimating how many intelligent

02:12:59,830 --> 02:12:59,840
estimating how many intelligent

02:12:59,840 --> 02:13:01,270
estimating how many intelligent

7706
02:13:01,270 --> 02:13:01,280
civilizations
 

7707
02:13:01,280 --> 02:13:03,030
civilizations
may be out there how many have ever

7708
02:13:03,030 --> 02:13:03,040
may be out there how many have ever
 

7709
02:13:03,040 --> 02:13:04,709
may be out there how many have ever
existed how many are able to communicate

7710
02:13:04,709 --> 02:13:04,719
existed how many are able to communicate
 

7711
02:13:04,719 --> 02:13:05,510
existed how many are able to communicate
with us

7712
02:13:05,510 --> 02:13:05,520
with us
 

7713
02:13:05,520 --> 02:13:08,229
with us
i mean when you just zoom out from our

7714
02:13:08,229 --> 02:13:08,239
i mean when you just zoom out from our
 

7715
02:13:08,239 --> 02:13:08,709
i mean when you just zoom out from our
own

7716
02:13:08,709 --> 02:13:08,719
own
 

7717
02:13:08,719 --> 02:13:11,910
own
little selfish perspective of earth and

7718
02:13:11,910 --> 02:13:11,920
little selfish perspective of earth and
 

7719
02:13:11,920 --> 02:13:14,229
little selfish perspective of earth and
look at the entirety let's say the milky

7720
02:13:14,229 --> 02:13:14,239
look at the entirety let's say the milky
 

7721
02:13:14,239 --> 02:13:17,430
look at the entirety let's say the milky
way galaxy but maybe even the universe

7722
02:13:17,430 --> 02:13:17,440
way galaxy but maybe even the universe
 

7723
02:13:17,440 --> 02:13:19,109
way galaxy but maybe even the universe
does the idea that there are intelligent

7724
02:13:19,109 --> 02:13:19,119
does the idea that there are intelligent
 

7725
02:13:19,119 --> 02:13:21,750
does the idea that there are intelligent
civilizations out there

7726
02:13:21,750 --> 02:13:21,760
civilizations out there
 

7727
02:13:21,760 --> 02:13:24,310
civilizations out there
something that you're excited about or

7728
02:13:24,310 --> 02:13:24,320
something that you're excited about or
 

7729
02:13:24,320 --> 02:13:25,510
something that you're excited about or
something that you're

7730
02:13:25,510 --> 02:13:25,520
something that you're
 

7731
02:13:25,520 --> 02:13:28,709
something that you're
terrified about that's a good question

7732
02:13:28,709 --> 02:13:28,719
terrified about that's a good question
 

7733
02:13:28,719 --> 02:13:32,550
terrified about that's a good question
so basically i would say i'm not

7734
02:13:32,550 --> 02:13:32,560
so basically i would say i'm not
 

7735
02:13:32,560 --> 02:13:35,990
so basically i would say i'm not
so keen on it um i think

7736
02:13:35,990 --> 02:13:36,000
so keen on it um i think
 

7737
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,950
so keen on it um i think
that our relationship with technology as

7738
02:13:38,950 --> 02:13:38,960
that our relationship with technology as
 

7739
02:13:38,960 --> 02:13:40,229
that our relationship with technology as
it is and as it

7740
02:13:40,229 --> 02:13:40,239
it is and as it
 

7741
02:13:40,239 --> 02:13:44,149
it is and as it
as i hope it will go will help us

7742
02:13:44,149 --> 02:13:44,159
as i hope it will go will help us
 

7743
02:13:44,159 --> 02:13:47,589
as i hope it will go will help us
survive okay um i don't think

7744
02:13:47,589 --> 02:13:47,599
survive okay um i don't think
 

7745
02:13:47,599 --> 02:13:50,629
survive okay um i don't think
we're equipped to do it as we stand now

7746
02:13:50,629 --> 02:13:50,639
we're equipped to do it as we stand now
 

7747
02:13:50,639 --> 02:13:53,830
we're equipped to do it as we stand now
but i think that if we can up our game

7748
02:13:53,830 --> 02:13:53,840
but i think that if we can up our game
 

7749
02:13:53,840 --> 02:13:54,149
but i think that if we can up our game
or

7750
02:13:54,149 --> 02:13:54,159
or
 

7751
02:13:54,159 --> 02:13:56,550
or
let's just put it this way if technology

7752
02:13:56,550 --> 02:13:56,560
let's just put it this way if technology
 

7753
02:13:56,560 --> 02:13:58,310
let's just put it this way if technology
is an extension of ourselves which it

7754
02:13:58,310 --> 02:13:58,320
is an extension of ourselves which it
 

7755
02:13:58,320 --> 02:13:59,510
is an extension of ourselves which it
actually is

7756
02:13:59,510 --> 02:13:59,520
actually is
 

7757
02:13:59,520 --> 02:14:02,229
actually is
it will help us because it'll probably

7758
02:14:02,229 --> 02:14:02,239
it will help us because it'll probably
 

7759
02:14:02,239 --> 02:14:03,830
it will help us because it'll probably
be smarter than us okay

7760
02:14:03,830 --> 02:14:03,840
be smarter than us okay
 

7761
02:14:03,840 --> 02:14:05,430
be smarter than us okay
it'll help us survive in the ways in

7762
02:14:05,430 --> 02:14:05,440
it'll help us survive in the ways in
 

7763
02:14:05,440 --> 02:14:06,870
it'll help us survive in the ways in
which it determines best

7764
02:14:06,870 --> 02:14:06,880
which it determines best
 

7765
02:14:06,880 --> 02:14:10,470
which it determines best
okay that said um if there

7766
02:14:10,470 --> 02:14:10,480
okay that said um if there
 

7767
02:14:10,480 --> 02:14:13,669
okay that said um if there
are non-human intelligences

7768
02:14:13,669 --> 02:14:13,679
are non-human intelligences
 

7769
02:14:13,679 --> 02:14:17,030
are non-human intelligences
out there and they have more advanced

7770
02:14:17,030 --> 02:14:17,040
out there and they have more advanced
 

7771
02:14:17,040 --> 02:14:19,270
out there and they have more advanced
you know obviously technologies than us

7772
02:14:19,270 --> 02:14:19,280
you know obviously technologies than us
 

7773
02:14:19,280 --> 02:14:20,790
you know obviously technologies than us
and they actually come

7774
02:14:20,790 --> 02:14:20,800
and they actually come
 

7775
02:14:20,800 --> 02:14:23,830
and they actually come
um uh the history of

7776
02:14:23,830 --> 02:14:23,840
um uh the history of
 

7777
02:14:23,840 --> 02:14:26,709
um uh the history of
human engagement with you know other

7778
02:14:26,709 --> 02:14:26,719
human engagement with you know other
 

7779
02:14:26,719 --> 02:14:27,990
human engagement with you know other
cultures

7780
02:14:27,990 --> 02:14:28,000
cultures
 

7781
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:31,109
cultures
has not gone well for cultures

7782
02:14:31,109 --> 02:14:31,119
has not gone well for cultures
 

7783
02:14:31,119 --> 02:14:34,229
has not gone well for cultures
that are less aggressive

7784
02:14:34,229 --> 02:14:34,239
that are less aggressive
 

7785
02:14:34,239 --> 02:14:35,750
that are less aggressive
so you see what i'm saying like it's not

7786
02:14:35,750 --> 02:14:35,760
so you see what i'm saying like it's not
 

7787
02:14:35,760 --> 02:14:37,350
so you see what i'm saying like it's not
a good idea

7788
02:14:37,350 --> 02:14:37,360
a good idea
 

7789
02:14:37,360 --> 02:14:40,310
a good idea
well i wonder where we stand on the

7790
02:14:40,310 --> 02:14:40,320
well i wonder where we stand on the
 

7791
02:14:40,320 --> 02:14:42,390
well i wonder where we stand on the
where humans stand the full spectrum of

7792
02:14:42,390 --> 02:14:42,400
where humans stand the full spectrum of
 

7793
02:14:42,400 --> 02:14:43,589
where humans stand the full spectrum of
aggression

7794
02:14:43,589 --> 02:14:43,599
aggression
 

7795
02:14:43,599 --> 02:14:45,830
aggression
well heck where are we now lex i mean

7796
02:14:45,830 --> 02:14:45,840
well heck where are we now lex i mean
 

7797
02:14:45,840 --> 02:14:47,990
well heck where are we now lex i mean
we're not too great here we're still

7798
02:14:47,990 --> 02:14:48,000
we're not too great here we're still
 

7799
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,229
we're not too great here we're still
aggressing against each other no i know

7800
02:14:50,229 --> 02:14:50,239
aggressing against each other no i know
 

7801
02:14:50,239 --> 02:14:51,830
aggressing against each other no i know
but that that will give us a benefit

7802
02:14:51,830 --> 02:14:51,840
but that that will give us a benefit
 

7803
02:14:51,840 --> 02:14:52,229
but that that will give us a benefit
right

7804
02:14:52,229 --> 02:14:52,239
right
 

7805
02:14:52,239 --> 02:14:55,990
right
like oh oh you're saying i thought

7806
02:14:55,990 --> 02:14:56,000
like oh oh you're saying i thought
 

7807
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,470
like oh oh you're saying i thought
okay i see i just have a sense that

7808
02:14:58,470 --> 02:14:58,480
okay i see i just have a sense that
 

7809
02:14:58,480 --> 02:15:00,390
okay i see i just have a sense that
there may be a lot of

7810
02:15:00,390 --> 02:15:00,400
there may be a lot of
 

7811
02:15:00,400 --> 02:15:02,310
there may be a lot of
intelligences out there that are less

7812
02:15:02,310 --> 02:15:02,320
intelligences out there that are less
 

7813
02:15:02,320 --> 02:15:03,430
intelligences out there that are less
aggressive

7814
02:15:03,430 --> 02:15:03,440
aggressive
 

7815
02:15:03,440 --> 02:15:06,709
aggressive
because they've evolved past it we can't

7816
02:15:06,709 --> 02:15:06,719
because they've evolved past it we can't
 

7817
02:15:06,719 --> 02:15:07,990
because they've evolved past it we can't
assume that

7818
02:15:07,990 --> 02:15:08,000
assume that
 

7819
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,310
assume that
no i know we can't assume that but like

7820
02:15:10,310 --> 02:15:10,320
no i know we can't assume that but like
 

7821
02:15:10,320 --> 02:15:11,510
no i know we can't assume that but like
if we can't assume it

7822
02:15:11,510 --> 02:15:11,520
if we can't assume it
 

7823
02:15:11,520 --> 02:15:13,050
if we can't assume it
then i'm gonna assume the worst

7824
02:15:13,050 --> 02:15:13,060
then i'm gonna assume the worst
 

7825
02:15:13,060 --> 02:15:15,430
then i'm gonna assume the worst
[Laughter]

7826
02:15:15,430 --> 02:15:15,440
[Laughter]
 

7827
02:15:15,440 --> 02:15:18,470
[Laughter]
well that's that's uh uh despite the

7828
02:15:18,470 --> 02:15:18,480
well that's that's uh uh despite the
 

7829
02:15:18,480 --> 02:15:20,149
well that's that's uh uh despite the
fact that i'm uh

7830
02:15:20,149 --> 02:15:20,159
fact that i'm uh
 

7831
02:15:20,159 --> 02:15:22,709
fact that i'm uh
russian and think that life is suffering

7832
02:15:22,709 --> 02:15:22,719
russian and think that life is suffering
 

7833
02:15:22,719 --> 02:15:23,830
russian and think that life is suffering
i tend to assume

7834
02:15:23,830 --> 02:15:23,840
i tend to assume
 

7835
02:15:23,840 --> 02:15:26,069
i tend to assume
not the best but i i tend to assume that

7836
02:15:26,069 --> 02:15:26,079
not the best but i i tend to assume that
 

7837
02:15:26,079 --> 02:15:27,430
not the best but i i tend to assume that
there is a best

7838
02:15:27,430 --> 02:15:27,440
there is a best
 

7839
02:15:27,440 --> 02:15:30,709
there is a best
core to uh to

7840
02:15:30,709 --> 02:15:30,719
core to uh to
 

7841
02:15:30,719 --> 02:15:33,270
core to uh to
creatures to people into creatures that

7842
02:15:33,270 --> 02:15:33,280
creatures to people into creatures that
 

7843
02:15:33,280 --> 02:15:34,950
creatures to people into creatures that
ultimately wins out

7844
02:15:34,950 --> 02:15:34,960
ultimately wins out
 

7845
02:15:34,960 --> 02:15:36,950
ultimately wins out
i think there's an evolutionary

7846
02:15:36,950 --> 02:15:36,960
i think there's an evolutionary
 

7847
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:38,229
i think there's an evolutionary
advantage

7848
02:15:38,229 --> 02:15:38,239
advantage
 

7849
02:15:38,239 --> 02:15:43,030
advantage
to being good to other living creatures

7850
02:15:43,030 --> 02:15:43,040
to being good to other living creatures
 

7851
02:15:43,040 --> 02:15:46,149
to being good to other living creatures
and so uh ultimately i think that if

7852
02:15:46,149 --> 02:15:46,159
and so uh ultimately i think that if
 

7853
02:15:46,159 --> 02:15:47,750
and so uh ultimately i think that if
there's intelligent

7854
02:15:47,750 --> 02:15:47,760
there's intelligent
 

7855
02:15:47,760 --> 02:15:49,430
there's intelligent
civilizations out there that prosper

7856
02:15:49,430 --> 02:15:49,440
civilizations out there that prosper
 

7857
02:15:49,440 --> 02:15:51,350
civilizations out there that prosper
sufficiently to be able to

7858
02:15:51,350 --> 02:15:51,360
sufficiently to be able to
 

7859
02:15:51,360 --> 02:15:55,350
sufficiently to be able to
travel across the great expanse of

7860
02:15:55,350 --> 02:15:55,360
travel across the great expanse of
 

7861
02:15:55,360 --> 02:15:58,390
travel across the great expanse of
space that uh they've evolved

7862
02:15:58,390 --> 02:15:58,400
space that uh they've evolved
 

7863
02:15:58,400 --> 02:16:02,709
space that uh they've evolved
past silly aggression

7864
02:16:02,709 --> 02:16:02,719
past silly aggression
 

7865
02:16:02,719 --> 02:16:05,350
past silly aggression
that uh it's more likely in my mind to

7866
02:16:05,350 --> 02:16:05,360
that uh it's more likely in my mind to
 

7867
02:16:05,360 --> 02:16:06,149
that uh it's more likely in my mind to
be

7868
02:16:06,149 --> 02:16:06,159
be
 

7869
02:16:06,159 --> 02:16:09,589
be
deeply cooperative so like growth over

7870
02:16:09,589 --> 02:16:09,599
deeply cooperative so like growth over
 

7871
02:16:09,599 --> 02:16:11,030
deeply cooperative so like growth over
destruction

7872
02:16:11,030 --> 02:16:11,040
destruction
 

7873
02:16:11,040 --> 02:16:14,310
destruction
like growth does not require destruction

7874
02:16:14,310 --> 02:16:14,320
like growth does not require destruction
 

7875
02:16:14,320 --> 02:16:18,390
like growth does not require destruction
i think but if you see the universe as a

7876
02:16:18,390 --> 02:16:18,400
i think but if you see the universe as a
 

7877
02:16:18,400 --> 02:16:20,629
i think but if you see the universe as a
ultimately a place where it's highly

7878
02:16:20,629 --> 02:16:20,639
ultimately a place where it's highly
 

7879
02:16:20,639 --> 02:16:22,390
ultimately a place where it's highly
constrained in resources that are

7880
02:16:22,390 --> 02:16:22,400
constrained in resources that are
 

7881
02:16:22,400 --> 02:16:23,270
constrained in resources that are
necessary

7882
02:16:23,270 --> 02:16:23,280
necessary
 

7883
02:16:23,280 --> 02:16:26,629
necessary
for traveling across space

7884
02:16:26,629 --> 02:16:26,639
for traveling across space
 

7885
02:16:26,639 --> 02:16:29,910
for traveling across space
and time then uh perhaps aggression is

7886
02:16:29,910 --> 02:16:29,920
and time then uh perhaps aggression is
 

7887
02:16:29,920 --> 02:16:32,469
and time then uh perhaps aggression is
necessary in order to

7888
02:16:32,469 --> 02:16:32,479
necessary in order to
 

7889
02:16:32,479 --> 02:16:34,469
necessary in order to
aggress against others that are desiring

7890
02:16:34,469 --> 02:16:34,479
aggress against others that are desiring
 

7891
02:16:34,479 --> 02:16:36,709
aggress against others that are desiring
to get access to those resources

7892
02:16:36,709 --> 02:16:36,719
to get access to those resources
 

7893
02:16:36,719 --> 02:16:39,030
to get access to those resources
i don't know i tend to try to be

7894
02:16:39,030 --> 02:16:39,040
i don't know i tend to try to be
 

7895
02:16:39,040 --> 02:16:39,990
i don't know i tend to try to be
optimistic

7896
02:16:39,990 --> 02:16:40,000
optimistic
 

7897
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,709
optimistic
on that front i think i'm emotionally

7898
02:16:42,709 --> 02:16:42,719
on that front i think i'm emotionally
 

7899
02:16:42,719 --> 02:16:43,509
on that front i think i'm emotionally
optimistic

7900
02:16:43,509 --> 02:16:43,519
optimistic
 

7901
02:16:43,519 --> 02:16:47,990
optimistic
and intellectually non-optimistic

7902
02:16:47,990 --> 02:16:48,000
and intellectually non-optimistic
 

7903
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,150
and intellectually non-optimistic
uh yeah i guess i'm that i'm there with

7904
02:16:50,150 --> 02:16:50,160
uh yeah i guess i'm that i'm there with
 

7905
02:16:50,160 --> 02:16:53,190
uh yeah i guess i'm that i'm there with
you i i tend to believe that the uh

7906
02:16:53,190 --> 02:16:53,200
you i i tend to believe that the uh
 

7907
02:16:53,200 --> 02:16:55,990
you i i tend to believe that the uh
happiness and deep fulfillment in life

7908
02:16:55,990 --> 02:16:56,000
happiness and deep fulfillment in life
 

7909
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,870
happiness and deep fulfillment in life
is found in that emotional place

7910
02:16:58,870 --> 02:16:58,880
is found in that emotional place
 

7911
02:16:58,880 --> 02:17:02,389
is found in that emotional place
the intellectual place is really useful

7912
02:17:02,389 --> 02:17:02,399
the intellectual place is really useful
 

7913
02:17:02,399 --> 02:17:03,349
the intellectual place is really useful
for

7914
02:17:03,349 --> 02:17:03,359
for
 

7915
02:17:03,359 --> 02:17:06,870
for
building cool new technologies and ideas

7916
02:17:06,870 --> 02:17:06,880
building cool new technologies and ideas
 

7917
02:17:06,880 --> 02:17:08,230
building cool new technologies and ideas
and so on but uh

7918
02:17:08,230 --> 02:17:08,240
and so on but uh
 

7919
02:17:08,240 --> 02:17:10,549
and so on but uh
happiness is in the emotional place and

7920
02:17:10,549 --> 02:17:10,559
happiness is in the emotional place and
 

7921
02:17:10,559 --> 02:17:11,429
happiness is in the emotional place and
there it

7922
02:17:11,429 --> 02:17:11,439
there it
 

7923
02:17:11,439 --> 02:17:15,190
there it
pays off to be optimistic i think

7924
02:17:15,190 --> 02:17:15,200
pays off to be optimistic i think
 

7925
02:17:15,200 --> 02:17:16,709
pays off to be optimistic i think
you said that technology might be able

7926
02:17:16,709 --> 02:17:16,719
you said that technology might be able
 

7927
02:17:16,719 --> 02:17:18,230
you said that technology might be able
to save us

7928
02:17:18,230 --> 02:17:18,240
to save us
 

7929
02:17:18,240 --> 02:17:19,910
to save us
uh you know that's also kind of

7930
02:17:19,910 --> 02:17:19,920
uh you know that's also kind of
 

7931
02:17:19,920 --> 02:17:21,830
uh you know that's also kind of
optimistic too

7932
02:17:21,830 --> 02:17:21,840
optimistic too
 

7933
02:17:21,840 --> 02:17:24,950
optimistic too
it might kill us there's uh talking to

7934
02:17:24,950 --> 02:17:24,960
it might kill us there's uh talking to
 

7935
02:17:24,960 --> 02:17:26,230
it might kill us there's uh talking to
you offline a little bit that

7936
02:17:26,230 --> 02:17:26,240
you offline a little bit that
 

7937
02:17:26,240 --> 02:17:29,030
you offline a little bit that
there was a sense that you know that we

7938
02:17:29,030 --> 02:17:29,040
there was a sense that you know that we
 

7939
02:17:29,040 --> 02:17:32,709
there was a sense that you know that we
humans are facing existential risks

7940
02:17:32,709 --> 02:17:32,719
humans are facing existential risks
 

7941
02:17:32,719 --> 02:17:34,870
humans are facing existential risks
that uh it's not obvious that we will

7942
02:17:34,870 --> 02:17:34,880
that uh it's not obvious that we will
 

7943
02:17:34,880 --> 02:17:36,309
that uh it's not obvious that we will
survive for long

7944
02:17:36,309 --> 02:17:36,319
survive for long
 

7945
02:17:36,319 --> 02:17:39,429
survive for long
do you have um is there

7946
02:17:39,429 --> 02:17:39,439
do you have um is there
 

7947
02:17:39,439 --> 02:17:42,389
do you have um is there
things that you worry about in terms of

7948
02:17:42,389 --> 02:17:42,399
things that you worry about in terms of
 

7949
02:17:42,399 --> 02:17:43,349
things that you worry about in terms of
ways we may

7950
02:17:43,349 --> 02:17:43,359
ways we may
 

7951
02:17:43,359 --> 02:17:46,549
ways we may
destroy ourselves or deeply damage the

7952
02:17:46,549 --> 02:17:46,559
destroy ourselves or deeply damage the
 

7953
02:17:46,559 --> 02:17:48,950
destroy ourselves or deeply damage the
fabric of human civilization

7954
02:17:48,950 --> 02:17:48,960
fabric of human civilization
 

7955
02:17:48,960 --> 02:17:53,589
fabric of human civilization
that technology may allow us to avoid

7956
02:17:53,589 --> 02:17:53,599
that technology may allow us to avoid
 

7957
02:17:53,599 --> 02:17:58,230
that technology may allow us to avoid
or alleviate yes i think that

7958
02:17:58,230 --> 02:17:58,240
or alleviate yes i think that
 

7959
02:17:58,240 --> 02:18:02,309
or alleviate yes i think that
any you can choose anything actually and

7960
02:18:02,309 --> 02:18:02,319
any you can choose anything actually and
 

7961
02:18:02,319 --> 02:18:05,349
any you can choose anything actually and
it could destroy us okay so you know uh

7962
02:18:05,349 --> 02:18:05,359
it could destroy us okay so you know uh
 

7963
02:18:05,359 --> 02:18:06,549
it could destroy us okay so you know uh
pollution

7964
02:18:06,549 --> 02:18:06,559
pollution
 

7965
02:18:06,559 --> 02:18:09,509
pollution
um you know here we're in a pandemic

7966
02:18:09,509 --> 02:18:09,519
um you know here we're in a pandemic
 

7967
02:18:09,519 --> 02:18:10,469
um you know here we're in a pandemic
okay

7968
02:18:10,469 --> 02:18:10,479
okay
 

7969
02:18:10,479 --> 02:18:13,509
okay
um a meteor okay so we can

7970
02:18:13,509 --> 02:18:13,519
um a meteor okay so we can
 

7971
02:18:13,519 --> 02:18:16,790
um a meteor okay so we can
use technology or the thing is

7972
02:18:16,790 --> 02:18:16,800
use technology or the thing is
 

7973
02:18:16,800 --> 02:18:18,870
use technology or the thing is
that we we say we use technology but

7974
02:18:18,870 --> 02:18:18,880
that we we say we use technology but
 

7975
02:18:18,880 --> 02:18:19,910
that we we say we use technology but
actually that's not

7976
02:18:19,910 --> 02:18:19,920
actually that's not
 

7977
02:18:19,920 --> 02:18:22,230
actually that's not
a correct way of putting it in my

7978
02:18:22,230 --> 02:18:22,240
a correct way of putting it in my
 

7979
02:18:22,240 --> 02:18:23,190
a correct way of putting it in my
opinion

7980
02:18:23,190 --> 02:18:23,200
opinion
 

7981
02:18:23,200 --> 02:18:27,509
opinion
um so there is a term used by

7982
02:18:27,509 --> 02:18:27,519
um so there is a term used by
 

7983
02:18:27,519 --> 02:18:30,469
um so there is a term used by
others uh coined by somebody i don't

7984
02:18:30,469 --> 02:18:30,479
others uh coined by somebody i don't
 

7985
02:18:30,479 --> 02:18:32,309
others uh coined by somebody i don't
know and i'm sorry to not give credit

7986
02:18:32,309 --> 02:18:32,319
know and i'm sorry to not give credit
 

7987
02:18:32,319 --> 02:18:33,589
know and i'm sorry to not give credit
where credit's due

7988
02:18:33,589 --> 02:18:33,599
where credit's due
 

7989
02:18:33,599 --> 02:18:35,990
where credit's due
but it's called technogenesis and it's

7990
02:18:35,990 --> 02:18:36,000
but it's called technogenesis and it's
 

7991
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:37,110
but it's called technogenesis and it's
this idea

7992
02:18:37,110 --> 02:18:37,120
this idea
 

7993
02:18:37,120 --> 02:18:38,549
this idea
heidegger actually had this idea but he

7994
02:18:38,549 --> 02:18:38,559
heidegger actually had this idea but he
 

7995
02:18:38,559 --> 02:18:40,629
heidegger actually had this idea but he
didn't use that term and it's this idea

7996
02:18:40,629 --> 02:18:40,639
didn't use that term and it's this idea
 

7997
02:18:40,639 --> 02:18:42,629
didn't use that term and it's this idea
that we co-evolve with technology

7998
02:18:42,629 --> 02:18:42,639
that we co-evolve with technology
 

7999
02:18:42,639 --> 02:18:44,070
that we co-evolve with technology
that we don't actually use it most

8000
02:18:44,070 --> 02:18:44,080
that we don't actually use it most
 

8001
02:18:44,080 --> 02:18:46,549
that we don't actually use it most
people think it's like a tool we use

8002
02:18:46,549 --> 02:18:46,559
people think it's like a tool we use
 

8003
02:18:46,559 --> 02:18:49,270
people think it's like a tool we use
okay let's use technology to do this

8004
02:18:49,270 --> 02:18:49,280
okay let's use technology to do this
 

8005
02:18:49,280 --> 02:18:49,750
okay let's use technology to do this
well

8006
02:18:49,750 --> 02:18:49,760
well
 

8007
02:18:49,760 --> 02:18:52,150
well
actually when we engage with technology

8008
02:18:52,150 --> 02:18:52,160
actually when we engage with technology
 

8009
02:18:52,160 --> 02:18:53,750
actually when we engage with technology
we actually engage with it

8010
02:18:53,750 --> 02:18:53,760
we actually engage with it
 

8011
02:18:53,760 --> 02:18:56,150
we actually engage with it
and it engages back with us and we

8012
02:18:56,150 --> 02:18:56,160
and it engages back with us and we
 

8013
02:18:56,160 --> 02:18:58,230
and it engages back with us and we
engage with it so it's this co-evolution

8014
02:18:58,230 --> 02:18:58,240
engage with it so it's this co-evolution
 

8015
02:18:58,240 --> 02:18:59,270
engage with it so it's this co-evolution
that's happening

8016
02:18:59,270 --> 02:18:59,280
that's happening
 

8017
02:18:59,280 --> 02:19:02,790
that's happening
and in that sense um

8018
02:19:02,790 --> 02:19:02,800
and in that sense um
 

8019
02:19:02,800 --> 02:19:06,870
and in that sense um
i think that as we create

8020
02:19:06,870 --> 02:19:06,880
i think that as we create
 

8021
02:19:06,880 --> 02:19:10,790
i think that as we create
more autonomous intelligent ai

8022
02:19:10,790 --> 02:19:10,800
more autonomous intelligent ai
 

8023
02:19:10,800 --> 02:19:14,230
more autonomous intelligent ai
it will help us uh survive

8024
02:19:14,230 --> 02:19:14,240
it will help us uh survive
 

8025
02:19:14,240 --> 02:19:18,389
it will help us uh survive
because it you know if we co-evolve with

8026
02:19:18,389 --> 02:19:18,399
because it you know if we co-evolve with
 

8027
02:19:18,399 --> 02:19:18,870
because it you know if we co-evolve with
it

8028
02:19:18,870 --> 02:19:18,880
it
 

8029
02:19:18,880 --> 02:19:21,270
it
it will need us as much as we need it is

8030
02:19:21,270 --> 02:19:21,280
it will need us as much as we need it is
 

8031
02:19:21,280 --> 02:19:22,389
it will need us as much as we need it is
my opinion

8032
02:19:22,389 --> 02:19:22,399
my opinion
 

8033
02:19:22,399 --> 02:19:25,429
my opinion
um how that happens or if that

8034
02:19:25,429 --> 02:19:25,439
um how that happens or if that
 

8035
02:19:25,439 --> 02:19:28,549
um how that happens or if that
if that bears out to be true um

8036
02:19:28,549 --> 02:19:28,559
if that bears out to be true um
 

8037
02:19:28,559 --> 02:19:31,270
if that bears out to be true um
we'll see but i don't think the idea

8038
02:19:31,270 --> 02:19:31,280
we'll see but i don't think the idea
 

8039
02:19:31,280 --> 02:19:33,110
we'll see but i don't think the idea
that we use technology is

8040
02:19:33,110 --> 02:19:33,120
that we use technology is
 

8041
02:19:33,120 --> 02:19:35,589
that we use technology is
is a correct way to put it i think that

8042
02:19:35,589 --> 02:19:35,599
is a correct way to put it i think that
 

8043
02:19:35,599 --> 02:19:36,870
is a correct way to put it i think that
technology is something so

8044
02:19:36,870 --> 02:19:36,880
technology is something so
 

8045
02:19:36,880 --> 02:19:38,790
technology is something so
strange the way it is today like digital

8046
02:19:38,790 --> 02:19:38,800
strange the way it is today like digital
 

8047
02:19:38,800 --> 02:19:40,389
strange the way it is today like digital
technology i'm not talking about

8048
02:19:40,389 --> 02:19:40,399
technology i'm not talking about
 

8049
02:19:40,399 --> 02:19:42,629
technology i'm not talking about
hammers or things like that those kinds

8050
02:19:42,629 --> 02:19:42,639
hammers or things like that those kinds
 

8051
02:19:42,639 --> 02:19:43,910
hammers or things like that those kinds
of tools okay

8052
02:19:43,910 --> 02:19:43,920
of tools okay
 

8053
02:19:43,920 --> 02:19:46,469
of tools okay
is technology is so far removed from

8054
02:19:46,469 --> 02:19:46,479
is technology is so far removed from
 

8055
02:19:46,479 --> 02:19:47,429
is technology is so far removed from
that

8056
02:19:47,429 --> 02:19:47,439
that
 

8057
02:19:47,439 --> 02:19:50,870
that
and our environment is so now

8058
02:19:50,870 --> 02:19:50,880
and our environment is so now
 

8059
02:19:50,880 --> 02:19:53,270
and our environment is so now
conditioned by our technology and the

8060
02:19:53,270 --> 02:19:53,280
conditioned by our technology and the
 

8061
02:19:53,280 --> 02:19:54,550
conditioned by our technology and the
infrastructure we live within the

8062
02:19:54,550 --> 02:19:54,560
infrastructure we live within the
 

8063
02:19:54,560 --> 02:19:55,830
infrastructure we live within the
material structure

8064
02:19:55,830 --> 02:19:55,840
material structure
 

8065
02:19:55,840 --> 02:19:59,910
material structure
i think that um it's going to it's not i

8066
02:19:59,910 --> 02:19:59,920
i think that um it's going to it's not i
 

8067
02:19:59,920 --> 02:20:00,790
i think that um it's going to it's not i
don't think it's going to be a

8068
02:20:00,790 --> 02:20:00,800
don't think it's going to be a
 

8069
02:20:00,800 --> 02:20:01,670
don't think it's going to be a
frankenstein

8070
02:20:01,670 --> 02:20:01,680
frankenstein
 

8071
02:20:01,680 --> 02:20:02,870
frankenstein
i think it's actually going you know

8072
02:20:02,870 --> 02:20:02,880
i think it's actually going you know
 

8073
02:20:02,880 --> 02:20:04,550
i think it's actually going you know
like a mary shelley type idea of

8074
02:20:04,550 --> 02:20:04,560
like a mary shelley type idea of
 

8075
02:20:04,560 --> 02:20:05,990
like a mary shelley type idea of
technology i think it's actually going

8076
02:20:05,990 --> 02:20:06,000
technology i think it's actually going
 

8077
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:06,630
technology i think it's actually going
to

8078
02:20:06,630 --> 02:20:06,640
to
 

8079
02:20:06,640 --> 02:20:10,710
to
be more promethean in the sense of

8080
02:20:10,710 --> 02:20:10,720
be more promethean in the sense of
 

8081
02:20:10,720 --> 02:20:12,550
be more promethean in the sense of
you know think about it we create

8082
02:20:12,550 --> 02:20:12,560
you know think about it we create
 

8083
02:20:12,560 --> 02:20:14,230
you know think about it we create
children and then

8084
02:20:14,230 --> 02:20:14,240
children and then
 

8085
02:20:14,240 --> 02:20:17,030
children and then
we get old and we rely upon our children

8086
02:20:17,030 --> 02:20:17,040
we get old and we rely upon our children
 

8087
02:20:17,040 --> 02:20:18,070
we get old and we rely upon our children
to help us

8088
02:20:18,070 --> 02:20:18,080
to help us
 

8089
02:20:18,080 --> 02:20:20,070
to help us
okay well i feel like that about

8090
02:20:20,070 --> 02:20:20,080
okay well i feel like that about
 

8091
02:20:20,080 --> 02:20:21,670
okay well i feel like that about
technology we've created well

8092
02:20:21,670 --> 02:20:21,680
technology we've created well
 

8093
02:20:21,680 --> 02:20:24,230
technology we've created well
we've created it right and so it's kind

8094
02:20:24,230 --> 02:20:24,240
we've created it right and so it's kind
 

8095
02:20:24,240 --> 02:20:25,510
we've created it right and so it's kind
of growing up now

8096
02:20:25,510 --> 02:20:25,520
of growing up now
 

8097
02:20:25,520 --> 02:20:27,910
of growing up now
[Laughter]

8098
02:20:27,910 --> 02:20:27,920
[Laughter]
 

8099
02:20:27,920 --> 02:20:31,030
[Laughter]
uh or maybe it's in its uh teenage years

8100
02:20:31,030 --> 02:20:31,040
uh or maybe it's in its uh teenage years
 

8101
02:20:31,040 --> 02:20:34,710
uh or maybe it's in its uh teenage years
and we'll see uh what what do you think

8102
02:20:34,710 --> 02:20:34,720
and we'll see uh what what do you think
 

8103
02:20:34,720 --> 02:20:35,590
and we'll see uh what what do you think
about

8104
02:20:35,590 --> 02:20:35,600
about
 

8105
02:20:35,600 --> 02:20:39,110
about
in terms of this co-evolution of um the

8106
02:20:39,110 --> 02:20:39,120
in terms of this co-evolution of um the
 

8107
02:20:39,120 --> 02:20:41,270
in terms of this co-evolution of um the
work around brain computer interfaces

8108
02:20:41,270 --> 02:20:41,280
work around brain computer interfaces
 

8109
02:20:41,280 --> 02:20:42,230
work around brain computer interfaces
and

8110
02:20:42,230 --> 02:20:42,240
and
 

8111
02:20:42,240 --> 02:20:47,830
and
maybe uh neurolink and and elon

8112
02:20:47,830 --> 02:20:47,840

 

8113
02:20:47,840 --> 02:20:51,030

seeing neurolink in particular

8114
02:20:51,030 --> 02:20:51,040
seeing neurolink in particular
 

8115
02:20:51,040 --> 02:20:54,469
seeing neurolink in particular
as uh its long-term mission as a

8116
02:20:54,469 --> 02:20:54,479
as uh its long-term mission as a
 

8117
02:20:54,479 --> 02:20:56,870
as uh its long-term mission as a
symbiosis with artificial intelligence

8118
02:20:56,870 --> 02:20:56,880
symbiosis with artificial intelligence
 

8119
02:20:56,880 --> 02:20:58,309
symbiosis with artificial intelligence
so

8120
02:20:58,309 --> 02:20:58,319
so
 

8121
02:20:58,319 --> 02:21:02,150
so
like giving a greater bandwidth

8122
02:21:02,150 --> 02:21:02,160
like giving a greater bandwidth
 

8123
02:21:02,160 --> 02:21:05,349
like giving a greater bandwidth
channel of communication between

8124
02:21:05,349 --> 02:21:05,359
channel of communication between
 

8125
02:21:05,359 --> 02:21:10,389
channel of communication between
technology ai systems and the biological

8126
02:21:10,389 --> 02:21:10,399
technology ai systems and the biological
 

8127
02:21:10,399 --> 02:21:13,910
technology ai systems and the biological
neural networks of our human mind

8128
02:21:13,910 --> 02:21:13,920
neural networks of our human mind
 

8129
02:21:13,920 --> 02:21:15,750
neural networks of our human mind
what do you think about this idea of

8130
02:21:15,750 --> 02:21:15,760
what do you think about this idea of
 

8131
02:21:15,760 --> 02:21:17,349
what do you think about this idea of
connecting directly

8132
02:21:17,349 --> 02:21:17,359
connecting directly
 

8133
02:21:17,359 --> 02:21:20,710
connecting directly
to the brain right in ai systems

8134
02:21:20,710 --> 02:21:20,720
to the brain right in ai systems
 

8135
02:21:20,720 --> 02:21:23,750
to the brain right in ai systems
i mean okay i've i've listened to

8136
02:21:23,750 --> 02:21:23,760
i mean okay i've i've listened to
 

8137
02:21:23,760 --> 02:21:25,830
i mean okay i've i've listened to
your podcast with elan i've listened to

8138
02:21:25,830 --> 02:21:25,840
your podcast with elan i've listened to
 

8139
02:21:25,840 --> 02:21:27,590
your podcast with elan i've listened to
elon before he's very intel

8140
02:21:27,590 --> 02:21:27,600
elon before he's very intel
 

8141
02:21:27,600 --> 02:21:30,309
elon before he's very intel
obviously super smart guy um i think

8142
02:21:30,309 --> 02:21:30,319
obviously super smart guy um i think
 

8143
02:21:30,319 --> 02:21:31,110
obviously super smart guy um i think
this is already

8144
02:21:31,110 --> 02:21:31,120
this is already
 

8145
02:21:31,120 --> 02:21:33,990
this is already
i mean not in the specific ways that he

8146
02:21:33,990 --> 02:21:34,000
i mean not in the specific ways that he
 

8147
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:35,030
i mean not in the specific ways that he
is doing it

8148
02:21:35,030 --> 02:21:35,040
is doing it
 

8149
02:21:35,040 --> 02:21:36,870
is doing it
but i think we are already doing that

8150
02:21:36,870 --> 02:21:36,880
but i think we are already doing that
 

8151
02:21:36,880 --> 02:21:39,590
but i think we are already doing that
okay and i can give you some examples

8152
02:21:39,590 --> 02:21:39,600
okay and i can give you some examples
 

8153
02:21:39,600 --> 02:21:42,790
okay and i can give you some examples
um and there are really trivial examples

8154
02:21:42,790 --> 02:21:42,800
um and there are really trivial examples
 

8155
02:21:42,800 --> 02:21:44,550
um and there are really trivial examples
but they do make the point and this is

8156
02:21:44,550 --> 02:21:44,560
but they do make the point and this is
 

8157
02:21:44,560 --> 02:21:45,429
but they do make the point and this is
one of them

8158
02:21:45,429 --> 02:21:45,439
one of them
 

8159
02:21:45,439 --> 02:21:48,550
one of them
so before i started this

8160
02:21:48,550 --> 02:21:48,560
so before i started this
 

8161
02:21:48,560 --> 02:21:52,150
so before i started this
research on ufos and uops and technology

8162
02:21:52,150 --> 02:21:52,160
research on ufos and uops and technology
 

8163
02:21:52,160 --> 02:21:55,910
research on ufos and uops and technology
i actually was looking at the effects of

8164
02:21:55,910 --> 02:21:55,920
i actually was looking at the effects of
 

8165
02:21:55,920 --> 02:21:59,429
i actually was looking at the effects of
technology and in in particular

8166
02:21:59,429 --> 02:21:59,439
technology and in in particular
 

8167
02:21:59,439 --> 02:22:03,110
technology and in in particular
media on religion and what i did was i

8168
02:22:03,110 --> 02:22:03,120
media on religion and what i did was i
 

8169
02:22:03,120 --> 02:22:03,910
media on religion and what i did was i
was lucky

8170
02:22:03,910 --> 02:22:03,920
was lucky
 

8171
02:22:03,920 --> 02:22:06,870
was lucky
to be asked to be a consultant for

8172
02:22:06,870 --> 02:22:06,880
to be asked to be a consultant for
 

8173
02:22:06,880 --> 02:22:08,550
to be asked to be a consultant for
various movies

8174
02:22:08,550 --> 02:22:08,560
various movies
 

8175
02:22:08,560 --> 02:22:11,510
various movies
and one in particular i learned a lot

8176
02:22:11,510 --> 02:22:11,520
and one in particular i learned a lot
 

8177
02:22:11,520 --> 02:22:13,429
and one in particular i learned a lot
from and that was the conjuring

8178
02:22:13,429 --> 02:22:13,439
from and that was the conjuring
 

8179
02:22:13,439 --> 02:22:16,630
from and that was the conjuring
so i was a history consultant

8180
02:22:16,630 --> 02:22:16,640
so i was a history consultant
 

8181
02:22:16,640 --> 02:22:18,710
so i was a history consultant
for the conjuring it happens to be my

8182
02:22:18,710 --> 02:22:18,720
for the conjuring it happens to be my
 

8183
02:22:18,720 --> 02:22:21,110
for the conjuring it happens to be my
field it's catholic studies right

8184
02:22:21,110 --> 02:22:21,120
field it's catholic studies right
 

8185
02:22:21,120 --> 02:22:22,710
field it's catholic studies right
and you've got these people who are real

8186
02:22:22,710 --> 02:22:22,720
and you've got these people who are real
 

8187
02:22:22,720 --> 02:22:24,550
and you've got these people who are real
people and they're you know exercising

8188
02:22:24,550 --> 02:22:24,560
people and they're you know exercising
 

8189
02:22:24,560 --> 02:22:25,990
people and they're you know exercising
demons and things like that okay so i

8190
02:22:25,990 --> 02:22:26,000
demons and things like that okay so i
 

8191
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:26,469
demons and things like that okay so i
thought

8192
02:22:26,469 --> 02:22:26,479
thought
 

8193
02:22:26,479 --> 02:22:28,790
thought
wow this is a great example for me you

8194
02:22:28,790 --> 02:22:28,800
wow this is a great example for me you
 

8195
02:22:28,800 --> 02:22:30,389
wow this is a great example for me you
know i didn't do it for the money

8196
02:22:30,389 --> 02:22:30,399
know i didn't do it for the money
 

8197
02:22:30,399 --> 02:22:32,309
know i didn't do it for the money
it doesn't pay well but i did it to

8198
02:22:32,309 --> 02:22:32,319
it doesn't pay well but i did it to
 

8199
02:22:32,319 --> 02:22:35,030
it doesn't pay well but i did it to
learn right so i work closely with the

8200
02:22:35,030 --> 02:22:35,040
learn right so i work closely with the
 

8201
02:22:35,040 --> 02:22:36,150
learn right so i work closely with the
screenwriters who

8202
02:22:36,150 --> 02:22:36,160
screenwriters who
 

8203
02:22:36,160 --> 02:22:38,309
screenwriters who
i work with now all the time with i work

8204
02:22:38,309 --> 02:22:38,319
i work with now all the time with i work
 

8205
02:22:38,319 --> 02:22:39,990
i work with now all the time with i work
with them all the time now

8206
02:22:39,990 --> 02:22:40,000
with them all the time now
 

8207
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:41,670
with them all the time now
and what i found was this i found that

8208
02:22:41,670 --> 02:22:41,680
and what i found was this i found that
 

8209
02:22:41,680 --> 02:22:44,469
and what i found was this i found that
as the most interesting part of the

8210
02:22:44,469 --> 02:22:44,479
as the most interesting part of the
 

8211
02:22:44,479 --> 02:22:46,150
as the most interesting part of the
creation of this movie was the editing

8212
02:22:46,150 --> 02:22:46,160
creation of this movie was the editing
 

8213
02:22:46,160 --> 02:22:48,550
creation of this movie was the editing
process because they would use

8214
02:22:48,550 --> 02:22:48,560
process because they would use
 

8215
02:22:48,560 --> 02:22:51,429
process because they would use
the it would go through editing and they

8216
02:22:51,429 --> 02:22:51,439
the it would go through editing and they
 

8217
02:22:51,439 --> 02:22:53,030
the it would go through editing and they
would use test audiences

8218
02:22:53,030 --> 02:22:53,040
would use test audiences
 

8219
02:22:53,040 --> 02:22:55,830
would use test audiences
and a lot of the test audiences um would

8220
02:22:55,830 --> 02:22:55,840
and a lot of the test audiences um would
 

8221
02:22:55,840 --> 02:22:56,150
and a lot of the test audiences um would
be

8222
02:22:56,150 --> 02:22:56,160
be
 

8223
02:22:56,160 --> 02:22:58,309
be
like you know there's like these things

8224
02:22:58,309 --> 02:22:58,319
like you know there's like these things
 

8225
02:22:58,319 --> 02:23:00,070
like you know there's like these things
where they test their flicker rates and

8226
02:23:00,070 --> 02:23:00,080
where they test their flicker rates and
 

8227
02:23:00,080 --> 02:23:01,830
where they test their flicker rates and
things like that the eye flicker rates

8228
02:23:01,830 --> 02:23:01,840
things like that the eye flicker rates
 

8229
02:23:01,840 --> 02:23:04,870
things like that the eye flicker rates
and so and the uh and when it goes

8230
02:23:04,870 --> 02:23:04,880
and so and the uh and when it goes
 

8231
02:23:04,880 --> 02:23:07,910
and so and the uh and when it goes
really intense they go to uc irvine and

8232
02:23:07,910 --> 02:23:07,920
really intense they go to uc irvine and
 

8233
02:23:07,920 --> 02:23:09,910
really intense they go to uc irvine and
they do this thing called cognitive

8234
02:23:09,910 --> 02:23:09,920
they do this thing called cognitive
 

8235
02:23:09,920 --> 02:23:13,270
they do this thing called cognitive
consumption which is basically um

8236
02:23:13,270 --> 02:23:13,280
consumption which is basically um
 

8237
02:23:13,280 --> 02:23:16,389
consumption which is basically um
or i'm sorry cognitive consumerism

8238
02:23:16,389 --> 02:23:16,399
or i'm sorry cognitive consumerism
 

8239
02:23:16,399 --> 02:23:19,030
or i'm sorry cognitive consumerism
where they basically hook test audiences

8240
02:23:19,030 --> 02:23:19,040
where they basically hook test audiences
 

8241
02:23:19,040 --> 02:23:19,750
where they basically hook test audiences
up to

8242
02:23:19,750 --> 02:23:19,760
up to
 

8243
02:23:19,760 --> 02:23:22,230
up to
ekgs and they read their brains yeah and

8244
02:23:22,230 --> 02:23:22,240
ekgs and they read their brains yeah and
 

8245
02:23:22,240 --> 02:23:23,429
ekgs and they read their brains yeah and
they figure out which

8246
02:23:23,429 --> 02:23:23,439
they figure out which
 

8247
02:23:23,439 --> 02:23:26,630
they figure out which
scenes create the most arousal yeah

8248
02:23:26,630 --> 02:23:26,640
scenes create the most arousal yeah
 

8249
02:23:26,640 --> 02:23:28,469
scenes create the most arousal yeah
yeah and so they cut out all the other

8250
02:23:28,469 --> 02:23:28,479
yeah and so they cut out all the other
 

8251
02:23:28,479 --> 02:23:29,910
yeah and so they cut out all the other
scenes okay

8252
02:23:29,910 --> 02:23:29,920
scenes okay
 

8253
02:23:29,920 --> 02:23:31,510
scenes okay
so what we're getting is we're getting

8254
02:23:31,510 --> 02:23:31,520
so what we're getting is we're getting
 

8255
02:23:31,520 --> 02:23:33,349
so what we're getting is we're getting
like this drug when we go to the movies

8256
02:23:33,349 --> 02:23:33,359
like this drug when we go to the movies
 

8257
02:23:33,359 --> 02:23:35,590
like this drug when we go to the movies
or when we do video games when we watch

8258
02:23:35,590 --> 02:23:35,600

8260
02:23:37,670 --> 02:23:37,680
we're literally physiologically
 

8261
02:23:37,680 --> 02:23:38,870

responding

8262
02:23:38,870 --> 02:23:38,880
responding
 

8263
02:23:38,880 --> 02:23:41,590
responding
to our technologies so we're already

8264
02:23:41,590 --> 02:23:41,600
to our technologies so we're already
 

8265
02:23:41,600 --> 02:23:42,870
to our technologies so we're already
there we're already interfacing with

8266
02:23:42,870 --> 02:23:42,880
there we're already interfacing with
 

8267
02:23:42,880 --> 02:23:43,190
there we're already interfacing with
them

8268

them
 

8269
02:23:43,200 --> 02:23:46,070
them
physiologically so that's my example now

8270
02:23:46,070 --> 02:23:46,080
physiologically so that's my example now
 

8271

uh before he became a priest and so he

8324
02:24:46,469 --> 02:24:46,479
uh before he became a priest and so he
 

8325
02:24:46,479 --> 02:24:48,790
uh before he became a priest and so he
believed he also saw what he called a

8326
02:24:48,790 --> 02:24:48,800
believed he also saw what he called a
 

8327
02:24:48,800 --> 02:24:49,750
believed he also saw what he called a
biosphere

8328
02:24:49,750 --> 02:24:49,760
biosphere
 

8329
02:24:49,760 --> 02:24:51,429
biosphere
now this guy is talking in like the

8330
02:24:51,429 --> 02:24:51,439
now this guy is talking in like the
 

8331
02:24:51,439 --> 02:24:53,830
now this guy is talking in like the
early 20th century like the 19

8332
02:24:53,830 --> 02:24:53,840
early 20th century like the 19
 

8333
02:24:53,840 --> 02:24:56,630
early 20th century like the 19
17 19 you know that time period and so

8334
02:24:56,630 --> 02:24:56,640
17 19 you know that time period and so
 

8335
02:24:56,640 --> 02:24:57,590
17 19 you know that time period and so
basically he

8336
02:24:57,590 --> 02:24:57,600
basically he
 

8337
02:24:57,600 --> 02:24:59,830
basically he
he said and wrote about this thing

8338
02:24:59,830 --> 02:24:59,840
he said and wrote about this thing
 

8339
02:24:59,840 --> 02:25:01,190
he said and wrote about this thing
called the newest sphere

8340
02:25:01,190 --> 02:25:01,200
called the newest sphere
 

8341
02:25:01,200 --> 02:25:03,030
called the newest sphere
and he basically said there will be a

8342
02:25:03,030 --> 02:25:03,040
and he basically said there will be a
 

8343
02:25:03,040 --> 02:25:05,190
and he basically said there will be a
point when we merge with our technology

8344
02:25:05,190 --> 02:25:05,200
point when we merge with our technology
 

8345
02:25:05,200 --> 02:25:06,710
point when we merge with our technology
and it's going to be somewhat like some

8346
02:25:06,710 --> 02:25:06,720
and it's going to be somewhat like some
 

8347
02:25:06,720 --> 02:25:08,550
and it's going to be somewhat like some
kind of a biosphere we have this

8348
02:25:08,550 --> 02:25:08,560
kind of a biosphere we have this
 

8349
02:25:08,560 --> 02:25:09,429
kind of a biosphere we have this
atmosphere

8350
02:25:09,429 --> 02:25:09,439
atmosphere
 

8351
02:25:09,439 --> 02:25:11,429
atmosphere
and then we have the stratosphere and

8352
02:25:11,429 --> 02:25:11,439
and then we have the stratosphere and
 

8353
02:25:11,439 --> 02:25:13,190
and then we have the stratosphere and
it's going to be this biosphere

8354
02:25:13,190 --> 02:25:13,200
it's going to be this biosphere
 

8355
02:25:13,200 --> 02:25:15,270
it's going to be this biosphere
and we're all going to be hooked into it

8356
02:25:15,270 --> 02:25:15,280
and we're all going to be hooked into it
 

8357
02:25:15,280 --> 02:25:17,270
and we're all going to be hooked into it
mentally so we'll be able to

8358
02:25:17,270 --> 02:25:17,280
mentally so we'll be able to
 

8359
02:25:17,280 --> 02:25:19,190
mentally so we'll be able to
communicate in a way in which we don't

8360
02:25:19,190 --> 02:25:19,200
communicate in a way in which we don't
 

8361
02:25:19,200 --> 02:25:20,389
communicate in a way in which we don't
communicate now

8362
02:25:20,389 --> 02:25:20,399
communicate now
 

8363
02:25:20,399 --> 02:25:22,230
communicate now
so you know that sounds so similar to

8364
02:25:22,230 --> 02:25:22,240
so you know that sounds so similar to
 

8365
02:25:22,240 --> 02:25:23,750
so you know that sounds so similar to
the singularity

8366
02:25:23,750 --> 02:25:23,760
the singularity
 

8367
02:25:23,760 --> 02:25:27,270
the singularity
so after i read him many many years ago

8368
02:25:27,270 --> 02:25:27,280
so after i read him many many years ago
 

8369
02:25:27,280 --> 02:25:30,309
so after i read him many many years ago

8372
02:25:31,030 --> 02:25:31,040
about the
 

8373
02:25:31,040 --> 02:25:34,230
about the
singularity to me it read just like

8374
02:25:34,230 --> 02:25:34,240
singularity to me it read just like
 

8375
02:25:34,240 --> 02:25:37,429
singularity to me it read just like
um religious language like it read like

throughout the history of ideas
 

8417
02:26:16,800 --> 02:26:20,150
throughout the history of ideas
is this like

8418
02:26:20,150 --> 02:26:20,160
is this like
 

8419
02:26:20,160 --> 02:26:23,670
is this like
moment of uh revelation like this

8420
02:26:23,670 --> 02:26:23,680
moment of uh revelation like this
 

8421
02:26:23,680 --> 02:26:26,309
moment of uh revelation like this
this almost mythological religious

8422
02:26:26,309 --> 02:26:26,319
this almost mythological religious
 

8423
02:26:26,319 --> 02:26:27,030
this almost mythological religious
moment

8424
02:26:27,030 --> 02:26:27,040
moment
 

8425
02:26:27,040 --> 02:26:31,590
moment
or is there something uh more

8426
02:26:31,590 --> 02:26:31,600
or is there something uh more
 

8427
02:26:31,600 --> 02:26:33,990
or is there something uh more
physical to this idea of concrete

8428
02:26:33,990 --> 02:26:34,000
physical to this idea of concrete
 

8429
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:34,950
physical to this idea of concrete
concrete

8430
02:26:34,950 --> 02:26:34,960
concrete
 

8431
02:26:34,960 --> 02:26:37,750
concrete
about the idea of there'll come a point

8432
02:26:37,750 --> 02:26:37,760
about the idea of there'll come a point
 

8433
02:26:37,760 --> 02:26:39,510
about the idea of there'll come a point
where our technology there'll be like a

8434
02:26:39,510 --> 02:26:39,520
where our technology there'll be like a
 

8435
02:26:39,520 --> 02:26:41,990
where our technology there'll be like a
phase shift between uh

8436
02:26:41,990 --> 02:26:42,000
phase shift between uh
 

8437
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:45,990
phase shift between uh
the the basic fabric of like humanity

8438
02:26:45,990 --> 02:26:46,000
the the basic fabric of like humanity
 

8439
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:47,590
the the basic fabric of like humanity
of how we interact you know how

8440
02:26:47,590 --> 02:26:47,600
of how we interact you know how
 

8441
02:26:47,600 --> 02:26:49,110
of how we interact you know how
evolution brought us to be this

8442
02:26:49,110 --> 02:26:49,120
evolution brought us to be this
 

8443
02:26:49,120 --> 02:26:50,630
evolution brought us to be this
biological interaction that our

8444
02:26:50,630 --> 02:26:50,640
biological interaction that our
 

8445
02:26:50,640 --> 02:26:52,309
biological interaction that our
technology

8446
02:26:52,309 --> 02:26:52,319
technology
 

8447
02:26:52,319 --> 02:26:54,309
technology
uh crosses some kind of line of

8448
02:26:54,309 --> 02:26:54,319
uh crosses some kind of line of
 

8449
02:26:54,319 --> 02:26:55,590
uh crosses some kind of line of
capability

8450
02:26:55,590 --> 02:26:55,600
capability
 

8451
02:26:55,600 --> 02:26:58,710
capability
that the world be more technology

8452
02:26:58,710 --> 02:26:58,720
that the world be more technology
 

8453
02:26:58,720 --> 02:27:01,349
that the world be more technology
than human to where it will leave us

8454
02:27:01,349 --> 02:27:01,359
than human to where it will leave us
 

8455
02:27:01,359 --> 02:27:03,110
than human to where it will leave us
behind

8456
02:27:03,110 --> 02:27:03,120
behind
 

8457
02:27:03,120 --> 02:27:04,710
behind
sort of oh yeah i don't think it's going

8458
02:27:04,710 --> 02:27:04,720
sort of oh yeah i don't think it's going
 

8459
02:27:04,720 --> 02:27:06,230
sort of oh yeah i don't think it's going
to leave us behind i think it's going to

8460
02:27:06,230 --> 02:27:06,240
to leave us behind i think it's going to
 

8461
02:27:06,240 --> 02:27:08,150
to leave us behind i think it's going to
take us along

8462
02:27:08,150 --> 02:27:08,160
take us along
 

8463
02:27:08,160 --> 02:27:10,389
take us along
but it will be i mean i guess the idea

8464
02:27:10,389 --> 02:27:10,399
but it will be i mean i guess the idea
 

8465
02:27:10,399 --> 02:27:12,070
but it will be i mean i guess the idea
of the singularity first of all isn't

8466
02:27:12,070 --> 02:27:12,080
of the singularity first of all isn't
 

8467
02:27:12,080 --> 02:27:13,590
of the singularity first of all isn't
the idea of the singularities like we

8468
02:27:13,590 --> 02:27:13,600
the idea of the singularities like we
 

8469
02:27:13,600 --> 02:27:15,030
the idea of the singularities like we
can't possibly predict what's on the

8470
02:27:15,030 --> 02:27:15,040
can't possibly predict what's on the
 

8471
02:27:15,040 --> 02:27:16,710
can't possibly predict what's on the
other side of the singularity

8472
02:27:16,710 --> 02:27:16,720
other side of the singularity
 

8473
02:27:16,720 --> 02:27:18,790
other side of the singularity
these are the senses like this is like

8474
02:27:18,790 --> 02:27:18,800
these are the senses like this is like
 

8475
02:27:18,800 --> 02:27:20,469
these are the senses like this is like
the world will be fundamentally

8476
02:27:20,469 --> 02:27:20,479
the world will be fundamentally
 

8477
02:27:20,479 --> 02:27:21,349
the world will be fundamentally
transformed

8478
02:27:21,349 --> 02:27:21,359
transformed
 

8479
02:27:21,359 --> 02:27:23,830
transformed
yes okay so right and then it was you

8480
02:27:23,830 --> 02:27:23,840
yes okay so right and then it was you
 

8481
02:27:23,840 --> 02:27:24,469
yes okay so right and then it was you
know

8482
02:27:24,469 --> 02:27:24,479
know
 

8483
02:27:24,479 --> 02:27:26,389
know
um this was characterized in various

8484
02:27:26,389 --> 02:27:26,399
um this was characterized in various
 

8485
02:27:26,399 --> 02:27:27,750
um this was characterized in various
movies like lucy

8486
02:27:27,750 --> 02:27:27,760
movies like lucy
 

8487
02:27:27,760 --> 02:27:30,150
movies like lucy
and stuff like that uh you know lucy

8488
02:27:30,150 --> 02:27:30,160
and stuff like that uh you know lucy
 

8489
02:27:30,160 --> 02:27:31,349
and stuff like that uh you know lucy
being the first human

8490
02:27:31,349 --> 02:27:31,359
being the first human
 

8491
02:27:31,359 --> 02:27:34,150
being the first human
that right we so kind of replicating and

8492
02:27:34,150 --> 02:27:34,160
that right we so kind of replicating and
 

8493
02:27:34,160 --> 02:27:35,670
that right we so kind of replicating and
this is going to be the next

8494
02:27:35,670 --> 02:27:35,680
this is going to be the next
 

8495
02:27:35,680 --> 02:27:38,469
this is going to be the next
iteration of humans is the singularity

8496
02:27:38,469 --> 02:27:38,479
iteration of humans is the singularity
 

8497
02:27:38,479 --> 02:27:39,030
iteration of humans is the singularity
um

8498
02:27:39,030 --> 02:27:39,040
um
 

8499
02:27:39,040 --> 02:27:42,790
um
i actually don't believe that um frankly

8500
02:27:42,790 --> 02:27:42,800
i actually don't believe that um frankly
 

8501
02:27:42,800 --> 02:27:44,630
i actually don't believe that um frankly
however and the reason i don't believe

8502
02:27:44,630 --> 02:27:44,640
however and the reason i don't believe
 

8503
02:27:44,640 --> 02:27:47,030
however and the reason i don't believe
it is because we're material beings

8504
02:27:47,030 --> 02:27:47,040
it is because we're material beings
 

8505
02:27:47,040 --> 02:27:49,910
it is because we're material beings
and technology has to have a host so

8506
02:27:49,910 --> 02:27:49,920
and technology has to have a host so
 

8507
02:27:49,920 --> 02:27:51,349
and technology has to have a host so
we're not going to you know

8508
02:27:51,349 --> 02:27:51,359
we're not going to you know
 

8509
02:27:51,359 --> 02:27:53,910
we're not going to you know
become something super abstract like

8510
02:27:53,910 --> 02:27:53,920
become something super abstract like
 

8511
02:27:53,920 --> 02:27:55,030
become something super abstract like
there's it's just

8512
02:27:55,030 --> 02:27:55,040
there's it's just
 

8513
02:27:55,040 --> 02:27:57,030
there's it's just
impossible to do there's nothing like

8514
02:27:57,030 --> 02:27:57,040
impossible to do there's nothing like
 

8515
02:27:57,040 --> 02:27:58,150
impossible to do there's nothing like
that well people

8516
02:27:58,150 --> 02:27:58,160
that well people
 

8517
02:27:58,160 --> 02:27:59,750
that well people
would be listening to this podcast a

8518
02:27:59,750 --> 02:27:59,760
would be listening to this podcast a
 

8519
02:27:59,760 --> 02:28:01,510
would be listening to this podcast a
hundred years from now and laughing at

8520
02:28:01,510 --> 02:28:01,520
hundred years from now and laughing at
 

8521
02:28:01,520 --> 02:28:03,670
hundred years from now and laughing at
it because

8522
02:28:03,670 --> 02:28:03,680
it because
 

8523
02:28:03,680 --> 02:28:05,349
it because
they'll be all existing in a virtual

8524
02:28:05,349 --> 02:28:05,359
they'll be all existing in a virtual
 

8525
02:28:05,359 --> 02:28:08,230
they'll be all existing in a virtual
reality we'll be all information

8526
02:28:08,230 --> 02:28:08,240
reality we'll be all information
 

8527
02:28:08,240 --> 02:28:10,870
reality we'll be all information
uh as opposed to material meaning

8528
02:28:10,870 --> 02:28:10,880
uh as opposed to material meaning
 

8529
02:28:10,880 --> 02:28:13,190
uh as opposed to material meaning
connected to some kind of

8530
02:28:13,190 --> 02:28:13,200
connected to some kind of
 

8531
02:28:13,200 --> 02:28:17,270
connected to some kind of
concept of physical uh physical reality

8532
02:28:17,270 --> 02:28:17,280
concept of physical uh physical reality
 

8533
02:28:17,280 --> 02:28:18,790
concept of physical uh physical reality
i don't even know the right words to use

8534
02:28:18,790 --> 02:28:18,800
i don't even know the right words to use
 

8535
02:28:18,800 --> 02:28:20,790
i don't even know the right words to use
you see that's because there are none

8536
02:28:20,790 --> 02:28:20,800
you see that's because there are none
 

8537
02:28:20,800 --> 02:28:24,150
you see that's because there are none
because there's no place from there's no

8538
02:28:24,150 --> 02:28:24,160
because there's no place from there's no
 

8539
02:28:24,160 --> 02:28:25,429
because there's no place from there's no
view from nowhere

8540
02:28:25,429 --> 02:28:25,439
view from nowhere
 

8541
02:28:25,439 --> 02:28:28,550

there's no non-material

8542
02:28:28,550 --> 02:28:28,560
there's no non-material
 

8543
02:28:28,560 --> 02:28:30,710
there's no non-material
like we have thoughts but they're

8544
02:28:30,710 --> 02:28:30,720
like we have thoughts but they're
 

8545
02:28:30,720 --> 02:28:31,830
like we have thoughts but they're
connected to us

connected to us
 

8547
02:28:31,840 --> 02:28:33,510
connected to us
right they're in our you know they're

8548
02:28:33,510 --> 02:28:33,520
right they're in our you know they're
 

8549
02:28:33,520 --> 02:28:35,110
right they're in our you know they're
somehow okay

somehow okay
as far as as far as you know listen

8552
02:28:38,070 --> 02:28:38,080
as far as as far as you know listen
 

8553
02:28:38,080 --> 02:28:41,030
as far as as far as you know listen
platonic forms i think is about as

8554
02:28:41,030 --> 02:28:41,040
platonic forms i think is about as
 

8555
02:28:41,040 --> 02:28:43,830
platonic forms i think is about as
as you know close to what we're talking

8556
02:28:43,830 --> 02:28:43,840
as you know close to what we're talking
 

8557
02:28:43,840 --> 02:28:44,710
as you know close to what we're talking
about as

8558
02:28:44,710 --> 02:28:44,720
about as
 

8559
02:28:44,720 --> 02:28:46,710
about as
possible like this place where these

8560
02:28:46,710 --> 02:28:46,720
possible like this place where these
 

8561
02:28:46,720 --> 02:28:47,990
possible like this place where these
things exist

8562
02:28:47,990 --> 02:28:48,000
things exist
 

8563
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:49,510
things exist
and then there's like a physical

8564
02:28:49,510 --> 02:28:49,520
and then there's like a physical
 

8565
02:28:49,520 --> 02:28:53,270
and then there's like a physical
instantiation of it nope

8566
02:28:53,270 --> 02:28:53,280

 

8567
02:28:53,280 --> 02:28:55,750

the question is from the perspective of

8568
02:28:55,750 --> 02:28:55,760
the question is from the perspective of
 

8569
02:28:55,760 --> 02:28:57,510
the question is from the perspective of
the platonic form

8570
02:28:57,510 --> 02:28:57,520
the platonic form
 

8571
02:28:57,520 --> 02:29:00,230
the platonic form
what does our physical world look like

8572
02:29:00,230 --> 02:29:00,240
what does our physical world look like
 

8573
02:29:00,240 --> 02:29:01,910
what does our physical world look like
you know what i'm saying like uh

8574
02:29:01,910 --> 02:29:01,920
you know what i'm saying like uh
 

8575
02:29:01,920 --> 02:29:03,830
you know what i'm saying like uh
you know if if say you're a creature

8576
02:29:03,830 --> 02:29:03,840
you know if if say you're a creature
 

8577
02:29:03,840 --> 02:29:06,309
you know if if say you're a creature
existing in a virtual reality like

8578
02:29:06,309 --> 02:29:06,319
existing in a virtual reality like
 

8579

in a virtual reality game like what is
 

8583
02:29:13,040 --> 02:29:13,510
in a virtual reality game like what is
it

8584
02:29:13,510 --> 02:29:13,520
it
 

8585
02:29:13,520 --> 02:29:15,349
it
and somebody in that virtual reality

8586
02:29:15,349 --> 02:29:15,359
and somebody in that virtual reality
 

8587
02:29:15,359 --> 02:29:16,710
and somebody in that virtual reality
world tells you

8588
02:29:16,710 --> 02:29:16,720
world tells you
 

8589
02:29:16,720 --> 02:29:18,870

world
and in fact your own you

8594
02:29:23,590 --> 02:29:23,600
and in fact your own you
 

8595
02:29:23,600 --> 02:29:25,349
and in fact your own you
think you're in this virtual world but

8596
02:29:25,349 --> 02:29:25,359
think you're in this virtual world but
 

8597
02:29:25,359 --> 02:29:27,270
think you're in this virtual world but
it's actually you're in a body

8598
02:29:27,270 --> 02:29:27,280
it's actually you're in a body
 

8599
02:29:27,280 --> 02:29:28,790
it's actually you're in a body
and this is just your mind putting

8600
02:29:28,790 --> 02:29:28,800
and this is just your mind putting
 

8601
02:29:28,800 --> 02:29:29,830
and this is just your mind putting
yourself and there's a piece of

8602
02:29:29,830 --> 02:29:29,840
yourself and there's a piece of
 

8603
02:29:29,840 --> 02:29:31,030
yourself and there's a piece of
technology

8604
02:29:31,030 --> 02:29:31,040
technology
 

8605
02:29:31,040 --> 02:29:33,270
technology
like how will they how would they be

able to
 

8609
02:29:34,240 --> 02:29:36,230
able to
think of that physical world would they

8610
02:29:36,230 --> 02:29:36,240
think of that physical world would they
 

8611
02:29:36,240 --> 02:29:38,070
think of that physical world would they
would they sound exactly like you just

okay
so he wrote this article which i use a

8674
02:30:44,550 --> 02:30:44,560
so he wrote this article which i use a
 

8675
02:30:44,560 --> 02:30:45,910
so he wrote this article which i use a
lot i love it because it's

8676
02:30:45,910 --> 02:30:45,920
lot i love it because it's
 

8677
02:30:45,920 --> 02:30:48,550
lot i love it because it's
accessible to undergraduates and it's

8678
02:30:48,550 --> 02:30:48,560
accessible to undergraduates and it's
 

8679
02:30:48,560 --> 02:30:48,950
accessible to undergraduates and it's
called

8680
02:30:48,950 --> 02:30:48,960
called
 

8681
02:30:48,960 --> 02:30:52,150
called
matrix as metaphysics and basically it's

8682
02:30:52,150 --> 02:30:52,160
matrix as metaphysics and basically it's
 

8683
02:30:52,160 --> 02:30:54,309
matrix as metaphysics and basically it's
it's an answer to external world

8684
02:30:54,309 --> 02:30:54,319
it's an answer to external world
 

8685
02:30:54,319 --> 02:30:55,270
it's an answer to external world
skepticism

8686
02:30:55,270 --> 02:30:55,280
skepticism
 

8687
02:30:55,280 --> 02:30:57,349
skepticism
which is basically how do we know

8688
02:30:57,349 --> 02:30:57,359
which is basically how do we know
 

8689
02:30:57,359 --> 02:30:58,550
which is basically how do we know
there's an external world

8690
02:30:58,550 --> 02:30:58,560
there's an external world
 

8691
02:30:58,560 --> 02:30:59,910
there's an external world
right how do we know that we're not in a

8692
02:30:59,910 --> 02:30:59,920
right how do we know that we're not in a
 

8693
02:30:59,920 --> 02:31:02,070
right how do we know that we're not in a
matrix right now and so

8694
02:31:02,070 --> 02:31:02,080
matrix right now and so
 

8695
02:31:02,080 --> 02:31:06,070
matrix right now and so
um basically he's using he's he's also

8696
02:31:06,070 --> 02:31:06,080
um basically he's using he's he's also
 

8697
02:31:06,080 --> 02:31:09,110
um basically he's using he's he's also
he even references he uses a religious

8698
02:31:09,110 --> 02:31:09,120
he even references he uses a religious
 

8699
02:31:09,120 --> 02:31:10,630
he even references he uses a religious
reference even he says

8700
02:31:10,630 --> 02:31:10,640
reference even he says
 

8701
02:31:10,640 --> 02:31:12,710
reference even he says
you could think of the matrix of the

8702
02:31:12,710 --> 02:31:12,720
you could think of the matrix of the
 

8703
02:31:12,720 --> 02:31:15,030
you could think of the matrix of the
movie as

8704
02:31:15,030 --> 02:31:15,040
movie as
 

8705
02:31:15,040 --> 02:31:19,429
movie as
a new as the new um book of genesis

8706
02:31:19,429 --> 02:31:19,439
a new as the new um book of genesis
 

8707
02:31:19,439 --> 02:31:21,990
a new as the new um book of genesis
for our new world right and i thought

8708
02:31:21,990 --> 02:31:22,000
for our new world right and i thought
 

8709
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:23,670
for our new world right and i thought
yeah that's absolutely correct

8710
02:31:23,670 --> 02:31:23,680
yeah that's absolutely correct
 

8711
02:31:23,680 --> 02:31:26,950
yeah that's absolutely correct
because you know we don't know

8712
02:31:26,950 --> 02:31:26,960
because you know we don't know
 

8713
02:31:26,960 --> 02:31:30,150
because you know we don't know
and we don't we won't know for sure or

8714
02:31:30,150 --> 02:31:30,160
and we don't we won't know for sure or
 

8715
02:31:30,160 --> 02:31:31,190
and we don't we won't know for sure or
for certain

8716
02:31:31,190 --> 02:31:31,200
for certain
 

8717
02:31:31,200 --> 02:31:33,590
for certain
therefore what we know is what is real

8718
02:31:33,590 --> 02:31:33,600
therefore what we know is what is real
 

8719
02:31:33,600 --> 02:31:34,710
therefore what we know is what is real
to us

8720
02:31:34,710 --> 02:31:34,720
to us
 

8721
02:31:34,720 --> 02:31:37,270
to us
and so he goes through these scenarios

8722
02:31:37,270 --> 02:31:37,280
and so he goes through these scenarios
 

8723
02:31:37,280 --> 02:31:38,070
and so he goes through these scenarios
and within

8724
02:31:38,070 --> 02:31:38,080
and within
 

8725
02:31:38,080 --> 02:31:40,469
and within
philosophy is called there's uh this is

8726
02:31:40,469 --> 02:31:40,479
philosophy is called there's uh this is
 

8727
02:31:40,479 --> 02:31:41,750
philosophy is called there's uh this is
different from that but it's like this

8728
02:31:41,750 --> 02:31:41,760
different from that but it's like this
 

8729
02:31:41,760 --> 02:31:42,950
different from that but it's like this
brain in a vat

8730
02:31:42,950 --> 02:31:42,960
brain in a vat
 

8731
02:31:42,960 --> 02:31:45,030
brain in a vat
right if you're a brain in a vat and

8732
02:31:45,030 --> 02:31:45,040
right if you're a brain in a vat and
 

8733
02:31:45,040 --> 02:31:46,070
right if you're a brain in a vat and
some

8734
02:31:46,070 --> 02:31:46,080
some
 

8735
02:31:46,080 --> 02:31:48,469
some
not so kind scientist is like recreating

8736
02:31:48,469 --> 02:31:48,479
not so kind scientist is like recreating
 

8737
02:31:48,479 --> 02:31:50,230
not so kind scientist is like recreating
this world for you just to see

8738
02:31:50,230 --> 02:31:50,240
this world for you just to see
 

8739
02:31:50,240 --> 02:31:52,309
this world for you just to see
you know and you think you're this

8740
02:31:52,309 --> 02:31:52,319
you know and you think you're this
 

8741
02:31:52,319 --> 02:31:53,590
you know and you think you're this
awesome rock star

8742
02:31:53,590 --> 02:31:53,600
awesome rock star
 

8743
02:31:53,600 --> 02:31:54,790
awesome rock star
right and you're living this awesome

8744
02:31:54,790 --> 02:31:54,800
right and you're living this awesome
 

8745
02:31:54,800 --> 02:31:56,950
right and you're living this awesome
existence but actually just this brain

8746
02:31:56,950 --> 02:31:56,960
existence but actually just this brain
 

8747
02:31:56,960 --> 02:31:59,110
existence but actually just this brain
in this vat okay but there's still a

8748
02:31:59,110 --> 02:31:59,120
in this vat okay but there's still a
 

8749
02:31:59,120 --> 02:32:00,550
in this vat okay but there's still a
brain in a vat

8750
02:32:00,550 --> 02:32:00,560
brain in a vat
 

8751
02:32:00,560 --> 02:32:03,590
brain in a vat
okay so his idea in um

8752
02:32:03,590 --> 02:32:03,600
okay so his idea in um
 

8753
02:32:03,600 --> 02:32:05,990
okay so his idea in um
the matrix says metaphysics kind of

8754
02:32:05,990 --> 02:32:06,000
the matrix says metaphysics kind of
 

8755
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,630
the matrix says metaphysics kind of
takes out the brain in a vat like this

8756
02:32:08,630 --> 02:32:08,640
takes out the brain in a vat like this
 

8757
02:32:08,640 --> 02:32:11,110
takes out the brain in a vat like this
i don't know if this is possible so i've

8758
02:32:11,110 --> 02:32:11,120
i don't know if this is possible so i've
 

8759
02:32:11,120 --> 02:32:12,870
i don't know if this is possible so i've
read critiques of this

8760
02:32:12,870 --> 02:32:12,880
read critiques of this
 

8761
02:32:12,880 --> 02:32:14,550
read critiques of this
that you know what you're talking about

8762
02:32:14,550 --> 02:32:14,560
that you know what you're talking about
 

8763
02:32:14,560 --> 02:32:17,750
that you know what you're talking about
is a non-dualism like there's like um

8764
02:32:17,750 --> 02:32:17,760
is a non-dualism like there's like um
 

8765
02:32:17,760 --> 02:32:20,830
is a non-dualism like there's like um
you know or it's not necessarily a

8766
02:32:20,830 --> 02:32:20,840
you know or it's not necessarily a
 

8767
02:32:20,840 --> 02:32:22,830
you know or it's not necessarily a
non-dualism

8768
02:32:22,830 --> 02:32:22,840
non-dualism
 

8769
02:32:22,840 --> 02:32:26,790
non-dualism
um i just i mean information

8770
02:32:26,790 --> 02:32:26,800
um i just i mean information
 

8771
02:32:26,800 --> 02:32:30,309
um i just i mean information
in and of itself has to

8772
02:32:30,309 --> 02:32:30,319
in and of itself has to
 

8773
02:32:30,319 --> 02:32:32,230
in and of itself has to
have some kind of material component to

8774
02:32:32,230 --> 02:32:32,240
have some kind of material component to
 

8775
02:32:32,240 --> 02:32:33,510
have some kind of material component to
it i mean

8776
02:32:33,510 --> 02:32:33,520
it i mean
 

8777
02:32:33,520 --> 02:32:36,389
it i mean
it's that that that uh when taken

8778
02:32:36,389 --> 02:32:36,399
it's that that that uh when taken
 

8779
02:32:36,399 --> 02:32:37,990
it's that that that uh when taken
outside the realm of human beings

8780
02:32:37,990 --> 02:32:38,000
outside the realm of human beings
 

8781
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:39,910
outside the realm of human beings
because dualism is kind of talking about

8782
02:32:39,910 --> 02:32:39,920
because dualism is kind of talking about
 

8783
02:32:39,920 --> 02:32:41,270
because dualism is kind of talking about
humans yeah

8784
02:32:41,270 --> 02:32:41,280
humans yeah
 

8785
02:32:41,280 --> 02:32:44,230
humans yeah
in a sense it's just possible to me that

8786
02:32:44,230 --> 02:32:44,240
in a sense it's just possible to me that
 

8787
02:32:44,240 --> 02:32:47,270
in a sense it's just possible to me that
there could be creatures that exist

8788
02:32:47,270 --> 02:32:47,280
there could be creatures that exist
 

8789
02:32:47,280 --> 02:32:50,630
there could be creatures that exist
in a very different form perhaps rely on

8790
02:32:50,630 --> 02:32:50,640
in a very different form perhaps rely on
 

8791
02:32:50,640 --> 02:32:52,630
in a very different form perhaps rely on
very different set of materials

8792
02:32:52,630 --> 02:32:52,640
very different set of materials
 

8793
02:32:52,640 --> 02:32:55,990
very different set of materials
yes that that may perhaps not even

8794
02:32:55,990 --> 02:32:56,000
yes that that may perhaps not even
 

8795
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,630
yes that that may perhaps not even
look like materials to us yes i agree

8796
02:32:58,630 --> 02:32:58,640
look like materials to us yes i agree
 

8797
02:32:58,640 --> 02:32:59,670
look like materials to us yes i agree
which is why like

8798
02:32:59,670 --> 02:32:59,680
which is why like
 

8799
02:32:59,680 --> 02:33:02,790
which is why like
information it could be even in

8800
02:33:02,790 --> 02:33:02,800
information it could be even in
 

8801
02:33:02,800 --> 02:33:04,710
information it could be even in
computers

8802
02:33:04,710 --> 02:33:04,720
computers
 

8803
02:33:04,720 --> 02:33:07,910
computers
the information that's traveling inside

8804
02:33:07,910 --> 02:33:07,920
the information that's traveling inside
 

8805
02:33:07,920 --> 02:33:09,190
the information that's traveling inside
a computer

8806
02:33:09,190 --> 02:33:09,200
a computer
 

8807
02:33:09,200 --> 02:33:12,309
a computer
is connected to actual uh

8808
02:33:12,309 --> 02:33:12,319
is connected to actual uh
 

8809
02:33:12,319 --> 02:33:15,910
is connected to actual uh
material movement right right so like

8810
02:33:15,910 --> 02:33:15,920
material movement right right so like
 

8811
02:33:15,920 --> 02:33:16,550
material movement right right so like
there is

8812
02:33:16,550 --> 02:33:16,560
there is
 

8813
02:33:16,560 --> 02:33:18,230
there is
it is ultimately connected to material

8814
02:33:18,230 --> 02:33:18,240
it is ultimately connected to material
 

8815
02:33:18,240 --> 02:33:19,990
it is ultimately connected to material
movement but it's less and less

8816
02:33:19,990 --> 02:33:20,000
movement but it's less and less
 

8817
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:21,670
movement but it's less and less
about the material and more and more

8818
02:33:21,670 --> 02:33:21,680
about the material and more and more
 

8819
02:33:21,680 --> 02:33:23,990
about the material and more and more
about the information

8820
02:33:23,990 --> 02:33:24,000
about the information
 

8821
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,070
about the information
so i i just mean that there's it's

8822
02:33:26,070 --> 02:33:26,080
so i i just mean that there's it's
 

8823
02:33:26,080 --> 02:33:27,190
so i i just mean that there's it's
possible that uh

8824
02:33:27,190 --> 02:33:27,200
possible that uh
 

8825
02:33:27,200 --> 02:33:29,750
possible that uh
you think the singularity is basically

8826
02:33:29,750 --> 02:33:29,760
you think the singularity is basically
 

8827
02:33:29,760 --> 02:33:30,630
you think the singularity is basically
like

8828
02:33:30,630 --> 02:33:30,640
like
 

8829
02:33:30,640 --> 02:33:32,870
like
sloughing off our material existence

8830
02:33:32,870 --> 02:33:32,880
sloughing off our material existence
 

8831
02:33:32,880 --> 02:33:33,910
sloughing off our material existence
well i don't know

8832
02:33:33,910 --> 02:33:33,920
well i don't know
 

8833
02:33:33,920 --> 02:33:35,429
well i don't know
because i can tell you that this has

8834
02:33:35,429 --> 02:33:35,439
because i can tell you that this has
 

8835
02:33:35,439 --> 02:33:37,510
because i can tell you that this has
been the hope of philosophers and

8836
02:33:37,510 --> 02:33:37,520
been the hope of philosophers and
 

8837
02:33:37,520 --> 02:33:40,389
been the hope of philosophers and
theologians forever yeah well i don't i

8838
02:33:40,389 --> 02:33:40,399
theologians forever yeah well i don't i
 

8839
02:33:40,399 --> 02:33:41,830
theologians forever yeah well i don't i
think we're living in this thing

8840
02:33:41,830 --> 02:33:41,840
think we're living in this thing
 

8841
02:33:41,840 --> 02:33:44,710
think we're living in this thing
uh through a singularity i i don't think

8842
02:33:44,710 --> 02:33:44,720
uh through a singularity i i don't think
 

8843
02:33:44,720 --> 02:33:45,910
uh through a singularity i i don't think
i think this world

8844
02:33:45,910 --> 02:33:45,920
i think this world
 

8845
02:33:45,920 --> 02:33:49,750
i think this world
just just like as you've said already uh

8846
02:33:49,750 --> 02:33:49,760
just just like as you've said already uh
 

8847
02:33:49,760 --> 02:33:51,030
just just like as you've said already uh
has been already transformed

8848
02:33:51,030 --> 02:33:51,040
has been already transformed
 

8849
02:33:51,040 --> 02:33:52,630
has been already transformed
significantly and keeps continually

8850
02:33:52,630 --> 02:33:52,640
significantly and keeps continually
 

8851
02:33:52,640 --> 02:33:53,670
significantly and keeps continually
being transformed yes

8852
02:33:53,670 --> 02:33:53,680
being transformed yes
 

8853
02:33:53,680 --> 02:33:55,510
being transformed yes
and we're just riding this yeah we are

8854
02:33:55,510 --> 02:33:55,520
and we're just riding this yeah we are
 

8855
02:33:55,520 --> 02:33:57,349
and we're just riding this yeah we are
big beautiful wave

8856
02:33:57,349 --> 02:33:57,359
big beautiful wave
 

8857
02:33:57,359 --> 02:34:00,630
big beautiful wave
of uh transformation and uh

8858
02:34:00,630 --> 02:34:00,640
of uh transformation and uh
 

8859
02:34:00,640 --> 02:34:02,870
of uh transformation and uh
that's why it's both exciting and

8860
02:34:02,870 --> 02:34:02,880
that's why it's both exciting and
 

8861
02:34:02,880 --> 02:34:04,790
that's why it's both exciting and
terrifying

8862
02:34:04,790 --> 02:34:04,800
terrifying
 

8863
02:34:04,800 --> 02:34:06,870
terrifying
uh from a scientific perspective that

8864
02:34:06,870 --> 02:34:06,880
uh from a scientific perspective that
 

8865
02:34:06,880 --> 02:34:08,389
uh from a scientific perspective that
like

8866
02:34:08,389 --> 02:34:08,399
like
 

8867
02:34:08,399 --> 02:34:10,469
like
we're so bad at predicting the future

8868
02:34:10,469 --> 02:34:10,479
we're so bad at predicting the future
 

8869
02:34:10,479 --> 02:34:11,429
we're so bad at predicting the future
and the future is

8870
02:34:11,429 --> 02:34:11,439
and the future is
 

8871
02:34:11,439 --> 02:34:14,550
and the future is
always so amazing in terms of the

8872
02:34:14,550 --> 02:34:14,560
always so amazing in terms of the
 

8873
02:34:14,560 --> 02:34:16,950
always so amazing in terms of the
the things that has brought us i mean i

8874
02:34:16,950 --> 02:34:16,960
the things that has brought us i mean i
 

8875
02:34:16,960 --> 02:34:17,750
the things that has brought us i mean i
don't know if it's

8876
02:34:17,750 --> 02:34:17,760
don't know if it's
 

8877
02:34:17,760 --> 02:34:20,150
don't know if it's
always will be this exciting in terms of

8878
02:34:20,150 --> 02:34:20,160
always will be this exciting in terms of
 

8879
02:34:20,160 --> 02:34:21,830
always will be this exciting in terms of
the rate of innovation

8880
02:34:21,830 --> 02:34:21,840
the rate of innovation
 

8881
02:34:21,840 --> 02:34:24,230
the rate of innovation
but it seems to be increasing still and

8882
02:34:24,230 --> 02:34:24,240
but it seems to be increasing still and
 

8883
02:34:24,240 --> 02:34:26,790
but it seems to be increasing still and
it's really exciting it's it's exciting

8884
02:34:26,790 --> 02:34:26,800
it's really exciting it's it's exciting
 

8885
02:34:26,800 --> 02:34:29,030
it's really exciting it's it's exciting
yeah it's terrifying because obviously

8886
02:34:29,030 --> 02:34:29,040
yeah it's terrifying because obviously
 

8887
02:34:29,040 --> 02:34:30,550
yeah it's terrifying because obviously
we're building better and better tools

8888
02:34:30,550 --> 02:34:30,560
we're building better and better tools
 

8889
02:34:30,560 --> 02:34:32,469
we're building better and better tools
for destroying ourselves

8890
02:34:32,469 --> 02:34:32,479
for destroying ourselves
 

8891
02:34:32,479 --> 02:34:35,190
for destroying ourselves
but i on the optimistic side believe

8892
02:34:35,190 --> 02:34:35,200
but i on the optimistic side believe
 

8893
02:34:35,200 --> 02:34:35,670
but i on the optimistic side believe
that we

8894
02:34:35,670 --> 02:34:35,680
that we
 

8895
02:34:35,680 --> 02:34:38,710
that we
also can build better and better tools

8896
02:34:38,710 --> 02:34:38,720
also can build better and better tools
 

8897
02:34:38,720 --> 02:34:40,870
also can build better and better tools
to uh defend against all the ways we can

8898
02:34:40,870 --> 02:34:40,880
to uh defend against all the ways we can
 

8899
02:34:40,880 --> 02:34:43,030
to uh defend against all the ways we can
destroy ourselves and it's kind of this

8900
02:34:43,030 --> 02:34:43,040
destroy ourselves and it's kind of this
 

8901

um the fact that this life ends gives
each day a significant amount of meaning

each day a significant amount of meaning
 

9697
02:48:19,359 --> 02:48:22,309
each day a significant amount of meaning
so i don't know uh it seems like an

humans
 

9977
02:52:54,720 --> 02:52:57,670
humans
or if there is intelligent alien

9978
02:52:57,670 --> 02:52:57,680
or if there is intelligent alien
 

9979
02:52:57,680 --> 02:52:59,269
or if there is intelligent alien
civilizations out there

9980
02:52:59,269 --> 02:52:59,279
civilizations out there
 

9981
02:52:59,279 --> 02:53:01,670
civilizations out there
do you think that's something that they

9982
02:53:01,670 --> 02:53:01,680
do you think that's something that they
 

9983
02:53:01,680 --> 02:53:03,990
do you think that's something that they
possess as well

9984
02:53:03,990 --> 02:53:04,000
possess as well
 

9985
02:53:04,000 --> 02:53:06,389
possess as well
maybe in different forms like whatever

9986
02:53:06,389 --> 02:53:06,399
maybe in different forms like whatever
 

9987
02:53:06,399 --> 02:53:07,429
maybe in different forms like whatever
this thing

9988
02:53:07,429 --> 02:53:07,439
this thing
 

9989
02:53:07,439 --> 02:53:11,750
this thing
that meaning is this intra intrinsic

9990
02:53:11,750 --> 02:53:11,760
that meaning is this intra intrinsic
 

9991
02:53:11,760 --> 02:53:13,510
that meaning is this intra intrinsic
drive that we have

9992
02:53:13,510 --> 02:53:13,520
drive that we have
 

9993
02:53:13,520 --> 02:53:15,830
drive that we have
do you think that's just a property of

9994
02:53:15,830 --> 02:53:15,840
do you think that's just a property of
 

9995
02:53:15,840 --> 02:53:16,630
do you think that's just a property of
life

9996
02:53:16,630 --> 02:53:16,640
life
 

9997
02:53:16,640 --> 02:53:20,070
life
of some level of complexity that we will

9998
02:53:20,070 --> 02:53:20,080
of some level of complexity that we will
 

9999
02:53:20,080 --> 02:53:22,469
of some level of complexity that we will
see that everywhere in this universe

10000
02:53:22,469 --> 02:53:22,479
see that everywhere in this universe
 

10001
02:53:22,479 --> 02:53:23,990
see that everywhere in this universe
in my opinion and this is just my

10002
02:53:23,990 --> 02:53:24,000
in my opinion and this is just my
 

10003
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:26,070
in my opinion and this is just my
opinion um i

10004
02:53:26,070 --> 02:53:26,080
opinion um i
 

10005
02:53:26,080 --> 02:53:28,309
opinion um i
i do think that it is but i also think

10006
02:53:28,309 --> 02:53:28,319
i do think that it is but i also think
 

10007
02:53:28,319 --> 02:53:30,150
i do think that it is but i also think
that it can take different forms

10008
02:53:30,150 --> 02:53:30,160
that it can take different forms
 

10009
02:53:30,160 --> 02:53:32,710
that it can take different forms
so if there is like uh think of gravity

10010
02:53:32,710 --> 02:53:32,720
so if there is like uh think of gravity
 

10011
02:53:32,720 --> 02:53:34,230
so if there is like uh think of gravity
right gravity kind of like

10012
02:53:34,230 --> 02:53:34,240
right gravity kind of like
 

10013
02:53:34,240 --> 02:53:36,469
right gravity kind of like
makes stuff stick to it right it like

10014
02:53:36,469 --> 02:53:36,479
makes stuff stick to it right it like
 

10015
02:53:36,479 --> 02:53:37,429
makes stuff stick to it right it like
tracks stuff

10016
02:53:37,429 --> 02:53:37,439
tracks stuff
 

10017
02:53:37,439 --> 02:53:39,269
tracks stuff
well what is loved you that does that

10018
02:53:39,269 --> 02:53:39,279
well what is loved you that does that
 

10019

too right so people who

10020
02:53:41,190 --> 02:53:41,200
too right so people who
 

10021
02:53:41,200 --> 02:53:44,230

are cr we call them charismatic charism

10022
02:53:44,230 --> 02:53:44,240
