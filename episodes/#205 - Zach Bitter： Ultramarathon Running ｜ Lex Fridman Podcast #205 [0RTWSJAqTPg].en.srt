long
 

147
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,150
long
is you're gonna have the full range of

the full spectrum of emotions
 

151
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,070
the full spectrum of emotions
of mental processes both kind of

152
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:24,080
of mental processes both kind of
 

153
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,990
of mental processes both kind of
positive negative and in between so it

154
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:26,000
positive negative and in between so it
 

155
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,430
positive negative and in between so it
almost feels like

156
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:27,440
almost feels like
 

157
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,430
almost feels like
you've lived multiple multiple lives or

158
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:31,440
you've lived multiple multiple lives or
 

159
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,390
you've lived multiple multiple lives or
a full life maybe

160
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:32,400

163
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,390
as it was way to say it in that one time
period so it's like a it's almost like a

164
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:36,400
period so it's like a it's almost like a
 

165
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,309
period so it's like a it's almost like a
simulation of what you may experience in

170
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:40,879
condensed period of time
 

171
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,869
condensed period of time
and i think that's just a weird mental

172
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:42,879
and i think that's just a weird mental
 

173
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,390
and i think that's just a weird mental
process to reflect upon and that's what

174
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:44,400
process to reflect upon and that's what
 

175
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,509
process to reflect upon and that's what
kind of draws people

176
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:45,519
kind of draws people
 

177
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,390
kind of draws people
back to it but i mean it's a battle too

178
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:48,400
back to it but i mean it's a battle too
 

179
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,110
back to it but i mean it's a battle too
because

180
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:49,120
because
 

181
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,990
because
if you're looking at it from a

182
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,000
if you're looking at it from a
 

183
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,750
if you're looking at it from a
performance standpoint versus an

184
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:51,760
performance standpoint versus an
 

185
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,550
performance standpoint versus an
experience

186
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:52,560
experience
 

187
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,750
experience
you obviously want to minimize the

188
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:53,760
you obviously want to minimize the
 

189
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,910
you obviously want to minimize the
negative mindset stuff you want to try

190
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:55,920
negative mindset stuff you want to try
 

191
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,830
negative mindset stuff you want to try
to keep those emotions and those

192
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:57,840
to keep those emotions and those
 

193
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,430
to keep those emotions and those
thought processes at a low and i think

194
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:01,440
thought processes at a low and i think
 

195
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,070
thought processes at a low and i think
when you can keep yourself from letting

196
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:04,080
when you can keep yourself from letting
 

197
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,070
when you can keep yourself from letting
those thoughts creep in

198
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,080
those thoughts creep in
 

199
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,710
those thoughts creep in
they you end up having better races and

200
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:08,720
they you end up having better races and
 

201
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,470
they you end up having better races and
it's it can spiral in either direction

202
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:10,480
it's it can spiral in either direction
 

203
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:10,790
it's it can spiral in either direction
like

204
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:10,800
like
 

205
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,630
like
i notice like there's there's kind of

206
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:12,640
i notice like there's there's kind of
 

207
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,110
i notice like there's there's kind of
like this scenario that occurs where

208
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,120
like this scenario that occurs where
 

209
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,390
like this scenario that occurs where
in the beginning like a negative thing

210
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:16,400
in the beginning like a negative thing
 

211
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,830
in the beginning like a negative thing
creeps in your mind it's like super easy

212
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:17,840
creeps in your mind it's like super easy
 

213
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,790
creeps in your mind it's like super easy
just to slap it down

214
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:18,800
just to slap it down
 

215
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,630
just to slap it down
say like get out of here uh you know

216
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:20,640
say like get out of here uh you know
 

217
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,830
say like get out of here uh you know
i've did the training i'm fit

218
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:21,840
i've did the training i'm fit
 

219
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,430
i've did the training i'm fit
i'm feeling fresh still you know

220
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:23,440
i'm feeling fresh still you know
 

221
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,869
i'm feeling fresh still you know
everything's going well at this point in

222
00:03:24,869 --> 00:03:24,879
everything's going well at this point in
 

223
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,070
everything's going well at this point in
time

224
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:26,080
time
 

225
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,390
time
you get a little further along in the

226
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:28,400
you get a little further along in the
 

227
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,910
you get a little further along in the
race and you're starting to feel a bit

228
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:29,920
race and you're starting to feel a bit
 

229
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,110
race and you're starting to feel a bit
of the fatigue

230
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:31,120
of the fatigue
 

231
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,869
of the fatigue
i mean a little bit of self-doubt creeps

232
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:32,879
i mean a little bit of self-doubt creeps
 

233
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,390
i mean a little bit of self-doubt creeps
in you start asking yourself well you

234
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:34,400
in you start asking yourself well you
 

235
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,750
in you start asking yourself well you
know maybe i should done one more long

236
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:35,760
know maybe i should done one more long
 

237
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,390
know maybe i should done one more long
run or

238
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:36,400
run or
 

239
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,309
run or
did i did i not quite taper long enough

240
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:38,319
did i did i not quite taper long enough
 

241
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,390
did i did i not quite taper long enough
and those things can kind of spiral into

242
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:40,400
and those things can kind of spiral into
 

243
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,589
and those things can kind of spiral into
a negative way and if

244
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:41,599
a negative way and if
 

245
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,309
a negative way and if
if you let it keep going it keeps going

246
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:44,319
if you let it keep going it keeps going
 

247
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,270
if you let it keep going it keeps going
all the way to

248
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:45,280
all the way to
 

249
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,550
all the way to
like why am i here why am i doing this

250
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:48,560
like why am i here why am i doing this
 

251
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,990
like why am i here why am i doing this
this is stupid all the way to like

252
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,000
this is stupid all the way to like
 

253
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,270
this is stupid all the way to like
there's another one of these two weeks

254
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:53,280
there's another one of these two weeks
 

255
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,550
there's another one of these two weeks
from now i'm gonna drop out of this one

256
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:54,560
from now i'm gonna drop out of this one
 

257
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,910
from now i'm gonna drop out of this one
and sign up for that one instead and

258
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:55,920
and sign up for that one instead and
 

259
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,110
and sign up for that one instead and
then you just find yourself in the exact

260
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,120
then you just find yourself in the exact
 

261
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,990
then you just find yourself in the exact
same situation

262
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:58,000
same situation
 

263
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,949
same situation
so you kind of have to go through the

264
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:00,959
so you kind of have to go through the
 

265
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,390
so you kind of have to go through the
process i think

266
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:02,400
process i think
 

267
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,949
process i think
it's why i think the there's kind of a i

268
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:04,959
it's why i think the there's kind of a i
 

269
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,070
it's why i think the there's kind of a i
won't say it's a rule of thumb

270
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:06,080
won't say it's a rule of thumb
 

271
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,550
won't say it's a rule of thumb
necessarily but something i think is

272
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:08,560
necessarily but something i think is
 

273
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,630
necessarily but something i think is
fairly valuable is if you do a hundred

274
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:10,640
fairly valuable is if you do a hundred
 

275
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,630
fairly valuable is if you do a hundred
miler the first time

276
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:12,640
miler the first time
 

277
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,949
miler the first time
make sure you get it done even if it

278
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:14,959
make sure you get it done even if it
 

279
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,150
make sure you get it done even if it
means like

280
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:16,160
means like
 

281
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,830
means like
you know death marching is what they'll

282
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:17,840
you know death marching is what they'll
 

283
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,349
you know death marching is what they'll
call it in the alternate community the

284
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:19,359
call it in the alternate community the
 

285
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,949
call it in the alternate community the
end of the race

286
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:20,959
end of the race
 

287
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,550
end of the race
just to say like you got that full

288
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:22,560
just to say like you got that full
 

289
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,070
just to say like you got that full
experience you experienced the highs the

290
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,080
experience you experienced the highs the
 

291
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,990
experience you experienced the highs the
lows the full thing the starting

292
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,000
lows the full thing the starting
 

293
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,510
lows the full thing the starting
the crossing the finish line that

294
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:27,520
the crossing the finish line that
 

295
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,950
the crossing the finish line that
release of emotion when you're done and

296
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:28,960
release of emotion when you're done and
 

297
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,390
release of emotion when you're done and
all that stuff

298
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:30,400
all that stuff
 

299
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,790
all that stuff
uh so that when you go back to do it

300
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:32,800
uh so that when you go back to do it
 

301
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,790
uh so that when you go back to do it
again you have like a template to build

302
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:34,800
again you have like a template to build
 

303
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,710
again you have like a template to build
off of then you know

304
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:36,720
off of then you know
 

305
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,230
off of then you know
or you just have some data to pull from

306
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:38,240
or you just have some data to pull from
 

307
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,670
or you just have some data to pull from
about how your mind's gonna work as well

308
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:39,680
about how your mind's gonna work as well
 

309
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,629
about how your mind's gonna work as well
as your body so

310
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:40,639
as your body so
 

311
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,150
as your body so
that you can start practicing well what

312
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:42,160
that you can start practicing well what
 

313
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,590
that you can start practicing well what
do i have to do to kind of keep my mind

314
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:43,600
do i have to do to kind of keep my mind
 

315
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,670
do i have to do to kind of keep my mind
from spiraling in a negative direction

316
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:45,680
from spiraling in a negative direction
 

317
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,350
from spiraling in a negative direction
or how do i

318
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:47,360
or how do i
 

319
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,189
or how do i
catch some positive momentum and kind of

320
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:49,199
catch some positive momentum and kind of
 

321
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,390
catch some positive momentum and kind of
keep sending it that way

322
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:50,400
keep sending it that way
 

323
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,830
keep sending it that way
and things like that and that that just

324
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:51,840
and things like that and that that just
 

325
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,590
and things like that and that that just
i think you just

326
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:53,600
i think you just
 

327
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,749
i think you just
add to that over a career of running

328
00:04:55,749 --> 00:04:55,759
add to that over a career of running
 

329
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,990
add to that over a career of running
them or a series of running them and

330
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,000
them or a series of running them and
 

331
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,670
them or a series of running them and
it would it's it sharpens it's kind of

332
00:04:59,670 --> 00:04:59,680
it would it's it sharpens it's kind of
 

333
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,270
it would it's it sharpens it's kind of
like any sport with that where

334
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,280
like any sport with that where
 

335
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,469
like any sport with that where
you know you always have this balance

336
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:02,479
you know you always have this balance
 

337
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,790
you know you always have this balance
between the youthfulness that you may

338
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:04,800
between the youthfulness that you may
 

339
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,629
between the youthfulness that you may
have earlier in your career versus the

340
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:06,639
have earlier in your career versus the
 

341
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,990
have earlier in your career versus the
the wise intelligence that you have

342
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:08,000
the wise intelligence that you have
 

343
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,749
the wise intelligence that you have
maybe near the end of your career

344
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:09,759
maybe near the end of your career
 

345
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,990
maybe near the end of your career
so in terms of wisdom is there

346
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,000
so in terms of wisdom is there
 

347
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,510
so in terms of wisdom is there
mechanisms by which

348
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:13,520
mechanisms by which
 

349
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,150
mechanisms by which
you kind of observe the negative

350
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:16,160
you kind of observe the negative
 

351
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,670
you kind of observe the negative
thoughts and let them go

352
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:17,680
thoughts and let them go
 

353
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,550
thoughts and let them go
so you have people like the david

354
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:20,560
so you have people like the david
 

355
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,189
so you have people like the david
goggins

356

into there's the weak
david that he hates and then there's a

364
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:31,120
david that he hates and then there's a
 

365
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,590
david that he hates and then there's a
strong

at that person
it's almost like sometimes literally

378
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:42,960
it's almost like sometimes literally
 

379
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,029
it's almost like sometimes literally
yelling at that person the weak version

of themselves
and then there's another more sort of

384
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,000
and then there's another more sort of
 

385
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,550
and then there's another more sort of

yeah that's a really good question it it

420
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:22,800
yeah that's a really good question it it
 

421
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,950
yeah that's a really good question it it
it's probably unique to the individual i

422
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:24,960
it's probably unique to the individual i
 

423
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,909
it's probably unique to the individual i
wouldn't argue that

424
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:25,919
wouldn't argue that
 

425
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,629
wouldn't argue that
you know david is finding success with

426
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:28,639
you know david is finding success with
 

427
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,870
you know david is finding success with
his approach

428
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:30,880
his approach
 

429
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,950
his approach
some may argue it's an extreme version

430
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:32,960
some may argue it's an extreme version
 

431
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,550
some may argue it's an extreme version
uh you know sam has obviously thought

432
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:34,560
uh you know sam has obviously thought
 

433
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,309
uh you know sam has obviously thought
about these things and

434
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:36,319
about these things and
 

435
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,029
about these things and
and uh really probably you know i see

436
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:39,039
and uh really probably you know i see
 

437
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,950
and uh really probably you know i see
those guys as kind of

438
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:40,960
those guys as kind of
 

439
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,309
those guys as kind of
two ends of the spectrum and just the

440
00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:42,319
two ends of the spectrum and just the
 

441
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,550
two ends of the spectrum and just the
way that they kind of come across

442
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:44,560
way that they kind of come across
 

443
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,469
way that they kind of come across
in general where like david's like

444
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:46,479
in general where like david's like
 

445
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,070
in general where like david's like
really at you kind of high energy

446
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,080
really at you kind of high energy
 

447
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,469
really at you kind of high energy
and sam's kind of this calming soft

448
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:50,479
and sam's kind of this calming soft
 

449
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:51,189
and sam's kind of this calming soft
presence

450
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:51,199
presence
 

451
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,029

and he's just gonna slowly methodically

452
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:53,039
and he's just gonna slowly methodically
 

453
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,710
and he's just gonna slowly methodically
lay it all out there

454
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:54,720
lay it all out there
 

455
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,870
lay it all out there
and i think there's value on in both of

456
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:56,880
and i think there's value on in both of
 

457
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,749
and i think there's value on in both of
those i think

458
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:57,759
those i think
 

459
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,270
those i think
most people are probably gonna get a

460
00:06:59,270 --> 00:06:59,280
most people are probably gonna get a
 

461
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,029
most people are probably gonna get a
benefit from

462
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:01,039
benefit from
 

463
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,110
benefit from
pulling some from each i mean there's

464
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,120
pulling some from each i mean there's
 

465
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,230
pulling some from each i mean there's
times where

466
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:04,240
times where
 

467
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,990
times where
where i need a kick in the ass and then

468
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:06,000
where i need a kick in the ass and then
 

469
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,070
where i need a kick in the ass and then
it's like have the strong zack tell the

470
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,080
it's like have the strong zack tell the
 

471
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,589
it's like have the strong zack tell the
weak zac to get moving

472
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:09,599
weak zac to get moving
 

473
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,830
weak zac to get moving
but there's also times where you know

474
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:11,840
but there's also times where you know
 

475
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,029
but there's also times where you know
it's just like you know

476
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:13,039
it's just like you know
 

477
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,430
it's just like you know
a subtle voice entering my head about

478
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:15,440
a subtle voice entering my head about
 

479
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,790
a subtle voice entering my head about
you know i don't know if i feel quite

480
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:16,800
you know i don't know if i feel quite
 

481
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,469
you know i don't know if i feel quite
right now should i

482
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:18,479
right now should i
 

483
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,950
right now should i
maybe pull back on the pace and i think

484
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:20,960
maybe pull back on the pace and i think
 

485
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,749
maybe pull back on the pace and i think
that

486
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:21,759
that
 

487
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,070
that
little subtle voice is best approached

488
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:24,080
little subtle voice is best approached
 

489
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,830
little subtle voice is best approached
with a subtle positive voice where it's

490
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:25,840
with a subtle positive voice where it's
 

491
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,550
with a subtle positive voice where it's
more like

492
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:26,560
more like
 

493
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,070
more like
okay well let's think this through here

494
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,080
okay well let's think this through here
 

495
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,309
okay well let's think this through here
for a second you're 40 miles into 100

496
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:30,319
for a second you're 40 miles into 100
 

497
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,110
for a second you're 40 miles into 100
mile race

498
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:31,120
mile race
 

499
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,909
mile race
you spent four months preparing for it

500
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:33,919
you spent four months preparing for it
 

501
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:34,469
you spent four months preparing for it
uh

502
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:34,479
uh
 

503
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:35,909
uh
you know from the workouts you did that

504
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:35,919
you know from the workouts you did that
 

505
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,230
you know from the workouts you did that
you're ready for this there really isn't

506
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:38,240
you're ready for this there really isn't
 

507
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,270
you're ready for this there really isn't
any real reason for you to slow down

508
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,280
any real reason for you to slow down
 

509
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,990
any real reason for you to slow down
or to fall off your goal your pace or

510
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,000
or to fall off your goal your pace or
 

511
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,550
or to fall off your goal your pace or
you know

512
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:44,560
you know
 

513
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,869
you know
reassess what you're doing let's just

514
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:46,879
reassess what you're doing let's just
 

515
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,270
reassess what you're doing let's just
give this another mile or two

516
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:49,280
give this another mile or two
 

517
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,350
give this another mile or two
and then we can reassess if we need to

518
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:51,360
and then we can reassess if we need to
 

519
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,189
and then we can reassess if we need to
in in order to kind of figure out if i'm

520
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:53,199
in in order to kind of figure out if i'm
 

521
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,110
in in order to kind of figure out if i'm
doing the right things or not

522
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,120
doing the right things or not
 

523
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,990
doing the right things or not
and i think like in that situation um

524
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:58,000
and i think like in that situation um
 

525
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,350
and i think like in that situation um
you definitely probably want to lean

526
00:07:59,350 --> 00:07:59,360
you definitely probably want to lean
 

527
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,869
you definitely probably want to lean
more towards the sam harris approach

528
00:08:00,869 --> 00:08:00,879
more towards the sam harris approach
 

529
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,070
more towards the sam harris approach
with that because there's really no

530
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:02,080
with that because there's really no
 

531
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,790
with that because there's really no
reason to

532
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:02,800
reason to
 

533
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,309
reason to
it's almost like the same thing you see

534
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:04,319
it's almost like the same thing you see
 

535
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,990
it's almost like the same thing you see
with like just

536
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:06,000
with like just
 

537
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,309
with like just
training and even nutrition to a degree

538
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:08,319
training and even nutrition to a degree
 

539
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,230
training and even nutrition to a degree
where like some folks they just want to

540
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:10,240
where like some folks they just want to
 

541
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,029
where like some folks they just want to
be like

542
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:11,039
be like
 

543
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,270
be like
kind of like drilled they want to be

544
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:13,280
kind of like drilled they want to be
 

545
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,510
kind of like drilled they want to be
like yelled at and said like get going

546
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:15,520
like yelled at and said like get going
 

547
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,950
like yelled at and said like get going
get doing this and that helps and that

548
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:16,960
get doing this and that helps and that
 

549
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,150
get doing this and that helps and that
motivates and that helps them stay

550
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:18,160
motivates and that helps them stay
 

551
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,110
motivates and that helps them stay
accountable

552

accountable

accountable
other people need some softer love with

554
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:21,520
other people need some softer love with
 

555
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,710
other people need some softer love with
it where it's like

556
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:22,720
it where it's like
 

557
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,309
it where it's like
you know this isn't necessarily your

558
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:24,319
you know this isn't necessarily your
 

559
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,230
you know this isn't necessarily your
thought your your fault you were put in

560
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:26,240
thought your your fault you were put in
 

561
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,309
thought your your fault you were put in
this environment that kind of created an

562
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:28,319
this environment that kind of created an
 

563
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,430
this environment that kind of created an
atmosphere of

564
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:29,440
atmosphere of
 

565
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,110
atmosphere of
lethargy and maybe poor nutritional

566
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:31,120
lethargy and maybe poor nutritional
 

567
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,110
lethargy and maybe poor nutritional
choices and things like that and

568
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:33,120
choices and things like that and
 

569
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,070
choices and things like that and
and like so but it's it's correctable so

570
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:36,080
and like so but it's it's correctable so
 

571
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,630
and like so but it's it's correctable so
we need to

572
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:36,640
we need to
 

573
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,550
we need to
we need to step away from that and we

574
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:38,560
we need to step away from that and we
 

575
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,829
we need to step away from that and we
need to kind of start heading in the

576
00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:39,839
need to kind of start heading in the
 

577
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,110
need to kind of start heading in the
direction that we know is going to bear

578
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:41,120
direction that we know is going to bear
 

579
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,149
direction that we know is going to bear
fruit down the road

580
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:42,159
fruit down the road
 

581
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,149
fruit down the road
and that person may respond better to

582
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:44,159
and that person may respond better to
 

583
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,430
and that person may respond better to
that so

584
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:45,440
that so
 

585
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,750
that so
i think both those guys have great value

586
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:47,760
i think both those guys have great value
 

587
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,710
i think both those guys have great value
with their approaches they're just

588
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:48,720
with their approaches they're just
 

589
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,990
with their approaches they're just
probably polar ends of that of the

590
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,000
probably polar ends of that of the
 

591
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,350
probably polar ends of that of the
spectrum and

592
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:51,360
spectrum and
 

593
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,870
spectrum and
i think most people are probably going

594
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:52,880
i think most people are probably going
 

595
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,389
i think most people are probably going
to benefit like anything right you get

596
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:54,399
to benefit like anything right you get
 

597
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,150
to benefit like anything right you get
the polarizing ones and those are going

598
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:56,160
the polarizing ones and those are going
 

599
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,750
the polarizing ones and those are going
to work right for the polarizing people

600
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:57,760
to work right for the polarizing people
 

601
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,949
to work right for the polarizing people
but then most people are going to fit

602
00:08:58,949 --> 00:08:58,959
but then most people are going to fit
 

603
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,550
but then most people are going to fit
somewhere in the middle so

604
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:00,560
somewhere in the middle so
 

605
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,990
somewhere in the middle so
they're probably going to be able to

606
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:02,000
they're probably going to be able to
 

607
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,269
they're probably going to be able to
kind of pull from both of those if

608
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:03,279
kind of pull from both of those if
 

609
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,550
kind of pull from both of those if
they're able to sit down and kind of

610
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:04,560
they're able to sit down and kind of
 

611
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:04,949
they're able to sit down and kind of
like

612
00:09:04,949 --> 00:09:04,959
like
 

613
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,470
like
assess which one's going to work better

614
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:06,480
assess which one's going to work better
 

615
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,990
assess which one's going to work better
in which situation so the

616
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,000
in which situation so the
 

617
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,150
in which situation so the
quitting thing you mentioned the like

618
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:10,160
quitting thing you mentioned the like
 

619
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,790
quitting thing you mentioned the like
the final stage which actually i get to

620
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:12,800
the final stage which actually i get to
 

621
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,949
the final stage which actually i get to
much quicker than you seem to which is

622
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:14,959
much quicker than you seem to which is
 

623
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,710
much quicker than you seem to which is
like why am i doing this

624
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:16,720
like why am i doing this
 

625
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,910
like why am i doing this
i get there with basically anything i do

626
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:19,920
i get there with basically anything i do
 

627
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,110
i get there with basically anything i do
it's like this is uh this is probably

628
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:23,120
it's like this is uh this is probably
 

629
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,550
it's like this is uh this is probably
the stupidest thing i've ever done is

630
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:24,560
the stupidest thing i've ever done is
 

631
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,990
the stupidest thing i've ever done is
the feeling i get often

632
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:26,000
the feeling i get often
 

633
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,590
the feeling i get often
and then immediately you have these

634
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:27,600
and then immediately you have these
 

635
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,350
and then immediately you have these
excuses they're like

636
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:29,360
excuses they're like
 

637
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,870
excuses they're like
there's all these other better things

638
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:30,880
there's all these other better things
 

639
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,949
there's all these other better things
you should be doing

640
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:32,959
you should be doing
 

641
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,190
you should be doing
or uh or the other alternative that like

642
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:35,200
or uh or the other alternative that like
 

643
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,389
or uh or the other alternative that like
you said

644
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:36,399
you said
 

645
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,630
you said
i'm not prepared enough for this moment

646
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:38,640
i'm not prepared enough for this moment
 

647
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,870
i'm not prepared enough for this moment
i'll be much more prepared in two weeks

648
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:40,880
i'll be much more prepared in two weeks
 

649
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,990
i'll be much more prepared in two weeks
for the next event so like why let's try

650
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:44,000
for the next event so like why let's try
 

651
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,630
for the next event so like why let's try
this again

652
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:44,640
this again
 

653
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,470
this again
let's start over let's start over in two

654
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:46,480
let's start over let's start over in two
 

655
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,910
let's start over let's start over in two
weeks how do you deal with that quit

656
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:49,920
weeks how do you deal with that quit
 

657
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,590
weeks how do you deal with that quit
like uh so

658
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:51,600

that quitting boys
 

671
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,870
that quitting boys
i think a lot of times when the quitting

672

i think a lot of times when the quitting
 

673
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,030
i think a lot of times when the quitting
voice kind of comes in

674
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,040
voice kind of comes in
 

675
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,670
voice kind of comes in
it what it does is it kind of just it

676
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:09,680
it what it does is it kind of just it
 

677
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,310
it what it does is it kind of just it
comes in

678
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:10,320
comes in
 

679
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,670
comes in
with the added disadvantage i guess

680
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:13,680
with the added disadvantage i guess
 

681
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,269
with the added disadvantage i guess
in this situation of being kind of a

682
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:15,279
in this situation of being kind of a
 

683
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,110
in this situation of being kind of a
narrow scoped view where you're looking

684
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:17,120
narrow scoped view where you're looking
 

685
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,230
narrow scoped view where you're looking
at like

686
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:18,240
at like
 

687
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,350
at like
uh what it's doing to you in the moment

688
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:21,360
uh what it's doing to you in the moment
 

689
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,710
uh what it's doing to you in the moment
or how you're feeling in the moment

690
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:22,720
or how you're feeling in the moment
 

691
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,949
or how you're feeling in the moment
versus how are you feeling about the

692
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:24,959
versus how are you feeling about the
 

693
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,630
versus how are you feeling about the
whole process

694
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:26,640
whole process
 

695
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,990
whole process
so one thing that i started doing in

696
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:29,000
so one thing that i started doing in
 

697
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,150
so one thing that i started doing in
2019

698
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:30,160
2019
 

699
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,910
2019
and i think i don't think it's

700
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:31,920
and i think i don't think it's
 

701
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,670
and i think i don't think it's
necessarily

702
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:33,680
necessarily
 

703
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,470
necessarily
uh i think i think i think this was a

704
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:36,480
uh i think i think i think this was a
 

705
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,910
uh i think i think i think this was a
big reason why i had one of my best

706
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:37,920
big reason why i had one of my best
 

707
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,310
big reason why i had one of my best
racing seasons in 2019 that i had

708
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:40,320
racing seasons in 2019 that i had
 

709
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,110
racing seasons in 2019 that i had
to that date uh it was part of it was i

710
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:43,120
to that date uh it was part of it was i
 

711
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,389
to that date uh it was part of it was i
started i think

712
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:44,399
started i think
 

713
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:45,910
started i think
putting a little more emphasis on the

714
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:45,920
putting a little more emphasis on the
 

715
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,590
putting a little more emphasis on the
big picture versus

716
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:47,600
big picture versus
 

717
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,750
big picture versus
putting emphasis on like this is one

718
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:49,760
putting emphasis on like this is one
 

719
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,430
putting emphasis on like this is one
opportunity or one day

720
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:51,440
opportunity or one day
 

721
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,470
opportunity or one day
of work uh and this is one

722
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:54,480
of work uh and this is one
 

723
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,430
of work uh and this is one
one emotional kind of flare-up but how

724
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:57,440
one emotional kind of flare-up but how
 

725
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,750
one emotional kind of flare-up but how
does that actually relate to my general

726
00:10:59,750 --> 00:10:59,760
does that actually relate to my general
 

727
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,470
does that actually relate to my general
broader picture so when i decide to do a

728
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:02,480
broader picture so when i decide to do a
 

729
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,190
broader picture so when i decide to do a
race

730
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:03,200
race
 

731
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,949
race
or an event or something like that it's

732
00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:04,959
or an event or something like that it's
 

733
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,110
or an event or something like that it's
often four or six months out

734
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:07,120
often four or six months out
 

735
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,949
often four or six months out
ahead of time you're planning to like

736
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:08,959
ahead of time you're planning to like
 

737
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,430
ahead of time you're planning to like
kind of do a series of workouts and a

738
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:11,440
kind of do a series of workouts and a
 

739
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,710
kind of do a series of workouts and a
flow of things where you're going

740
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:12,720
flow of things where you're going
 

741
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,910
flow of things where you're going
through the process of getting fit

742
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:13,920
through the process of getting fit
 

743
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,110
through the process of getting fit
getting ready preparing for the

744
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:15,120
getting ready preparing for the
 

745
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,350
getting ready preparing for the
specifics of the day and all that stuff

746
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:17,360
specifics of the day and all that stuff
 

747
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,949
specifics of the day and all that stuff
and then you get to the race itself for

748
00:11:18,949 --> 00:11:18,959
and then you get to the race itself for
 

749
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,550
and then you get to the race itself for
the event itself and

750
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:20,560
the event itself and
 

751
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,750
the event itself and
it's very easy to look at that and think

752
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:23,760
it's very easy to look at that and think
 

753
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,590
it's very easy to look at that and think
that's in isolation like i'm going to

754
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:25,600
that's in isolation like i'm going to
 

755
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,430
that's in isolation like i'm going to
run 12 hours today or i'm going to run

756
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:27,440
run 12 hours today or i'm going to run
 

757
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,710
run 12 hours today or i'm going to run
100 miles today or whatever it ends up

758
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:28,720
100 miles today or whatever it ends up
 

759
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,509
100 miles today or whatever it ends up
being

760
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:29,519
being
 

761
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,190
being
and it's a lot easier to quit when

762
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:33,200
and it's a lot easier to quit when
 

763
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,910
and it's a lot easier to quit when
you think to yourself i'm 40 miles into

764
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:35,920
you think to yourself i'm 40 miles into
 

765
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,350
you think to yourself i'm 40 miles into
100 mile race

766
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:37,360
100 mile race
 

767
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,990
100 mile race
you know that's just a 40 mile run which

768
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,000
you know that's just a 40 mile run which
 

769
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,030
you know that's just a 40 mile run which
sounds kind of silly

770
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:41,040
sounds kind of silly
 

771
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,190
sounds kind of silly
to most people but in perspective when

772
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:43,200
to most people but in perspective when
 

773
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,389
to most people but in perspective when
we're talking about the ultra marathon

774
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:44,399
we're talking about the ultra marathon
 

775
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,509
we're talking about the ultra marathon
running community

776
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:45,519
running community
 

777
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,870
running community
you know it's a lot easier just to say

778
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:46,880
you know it's a lot easier just to say
 

779
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,389
you know it's a lot easier just to say
like well you know i'll scrap this 40

780
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:48,399
like well you know i'll scrap this 40
 

781
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,430
like well you know i'll scrap this 40
miles and try again

782
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:49,440
miles and try again
 

783
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,629
miles and try again
it's a lot harder to say i'm gonna scrap

784
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:52,639
it's a lot harder to say i'm gonna scrap
 

785
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,790
it's a lot harder to say i'm gonna scrap
the entire last four months the entire

786
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:54,800
the entire last four months the entire
 

787
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,790
the entire last four months the entire
reason why i was doing it the countless

788
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:56,800
reason why i was doing it the countless
 

789
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,389
reason why i was doing it the countless
hours i spent in there

790
00:11:58,389 --> 00:11:58,399
hours i spent in there
 

791
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,150
hours i spent in there
so i think i just try to reposition it

792
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:00,160
so i think i just try to reposition it
 

793
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,310
so i think i just try to reposition it
of like i'm in a bad place right now

794
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:02,320
of like i'm in a bad place right now
 

795
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,069
of like i'm in a bad place right now
maybe in my head or i'm not i'm hitting

796
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:04,079
maybe in my head or i'm not i'm hitting
 

797
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,590
maybe in my head or i'm not i'm hitting
a low point here

798
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:05,600
a low point here
 

799
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,949
a low point here
but i'm 99 of the way towards the goal i

800
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:08,959
but i'm 99 of the way towards the goal i
 

801
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,550
but i'm 99 of the way towards the goal i
set out four months ago when i add in

802
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:10,560
set out four months ago when i add in
 

803
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,790
set out four months ago when i add in
all the work i did leading up to that

804
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:12,800
all the work i did leading up to that
 

805
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,269
all the work i did leading up to that
so i think it's important to ask

806
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:15,279
so i think it's important to ask
 

807
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,550
so i think it's important to ask
yourself why

808
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:16,560
yourself why
 

809
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,550
yourself why
because i mean there are times when

810
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:18,560
because i mean there are times when
 

811
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,829
because i mean there are times when
you're doing something and you ask

812
00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:19,839
you're doing something and you ask
 

813
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,030
you're doing something and you ask
yourself why you don't have a good

814
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,040
yourself why you don't have a good
 

815
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,910
yourself why you don't have a good
reason

816
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:21,920
reason
 

817
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,389
reason
and then maybe it is advantageous to

818
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:24,399
and then maybe it is advantageous to
 

819
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,350
and then maybe it is advantageous to
step back and

820
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:25,360
step back and
 

821
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,030
step back and
and really reflect on that and decide is

822
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:27,040
and really reflect on that and decide is

into a variety of different things it
can be easy probably to

834
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:38,320
can be easy probably to
 

835
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,870
can be easy probably to
overextend and get i mean i'm a very

836
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:40,880
overextend and get i mean i'm a very

overextend and get i mean i'm a very
curious person so there's like

838
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:42,399
curious person so there's like

100 things i would love to do if i

840
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,000
100 things i would love to do if i
 

841
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,590
100 things i would love to do if i
wasn't doing what i'm doing yeah and i

842
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:45,600
wasn't doing what i'm doing yeah and i
 

843
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,030

know how to enjoy all of them

844
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,040
know how to enjoy all of them
 

845
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,590
know how to enjoy all of them
so at a certain point though you have to

846
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:49,600
so at a certain point though you have to
 

847
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,030
so at a certain point though you have to
say okay which one is gonna

848
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,040
say okay which one is gonna
 

849
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,110
say okay which one is gonna
be the most meaningful for me and if the

850
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:53,120
be the most meaningful for me and if the
 

851
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,629
be the most meaningful for me and if the
answer keeps coming back to saying i

852
00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:54,639
answer keeps coming back to saying i
 

853
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,150
answer keeps coming back to saying i
guess this is still the most meaningful

854
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:56,160
guess this is still the most meaningful
 

855
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,829
guess this is still the most meaningful
to me out of that hundred things that i

856
00:12:57,829 --> 00:12:57,839
to me out of that hundred things that i
 

857
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,590
to me out of that hundred things that i
could otherwise be doing

858
00:12:59,590 --> 00:12:59,600
could otherwise be doing
 

859
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,590
could otherwise be doing
then then i know that i'm in the in it

860
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:01,600
then then i know that i'm in the in it
 

861
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,870
then then i know that i'm in the in it
for the right reason then i just need to

862
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:02,880
for the right reason then i just need to
 

863
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,030
for the right reason then i just need to
identify some other things like well

864
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:05,040
identify some other things like well
 

865
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,110
identify some other things like well
why did this one take the top spot out

866
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:07,120
why did this one take the top spot out
 

867
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,230
why did this one take the top spot out
of the hundred things that i could have

it feels like i have to come up with uh
like really work hard to make sure

like really work hard to make sure
 

959
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,189
like really work hard to make sure
that there's no quit that never allow

960
00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:39,199
that there's no quit that never allow
 

961
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,030
that there's no quit that never allow
myself to quit no matter how stupid the

962
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,040
myself to quit no matter how stupid the
 

963
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,230
myself to quit no matter how stupid the
thing i'm doing is

964
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:42,240
thing i'm doing is
 

965
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,670
thing i'm doing is
i don't know if any of that makes sense

966
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:43,680
i don't know if any of that makes sense
 

967
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,670
i don't know if any of that makes sense
but it just

968
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:45,680
but it just
 

969
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,990
but it just
maybe to rephrase this whole thing do

970
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:48,000
maybe to rephrase this whole thing do
 

971
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,189
maybe to rephrase this whole thing do
you think

972
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:49,199
you think
 

973
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,189
you think
is good to live life by the ethos of

never quit yeah that's a really
 

977
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,430
never quit yeah that's a really
interesting thing and i think it

978
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:57,440
interesting thing and i think it
 

979
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,069
interesting thing and i think it

00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:00,079
actually resonates with a lot of ultra
 

981
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,750
actually resonates with a lot of ultra
marathon runners because there seems to

982
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:01,760
marathon runners because there seems to
 

983
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,470
marathon runners because there seems to
be

984
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:02,480
be
 

985
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,509
be
a trend when you have someone who's been

986
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:05,519
a trend when you have someone who's been
 

987
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,509
a trend when you have someone who's been
in the sport for a long time where

988
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:07,519
in the sport for a long time where
 

989
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,110
in the sport for a long time where
there's a point where they start the

990
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:09,120
there's a point where they start the
 

991
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,629
there's a point where they start the
sport right and they're like

992
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:10,639
sport right and they're like
 

993
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,150
sport right and they're like
super excited about everything

994
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:12,160
super excited about everything
 

995
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,670
super excited about everything
everything's new uh

996
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:13,680
everything's new uh
 

997
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,430
everything's new uh
it's very easy not to quit because

998
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:15,440
it's very easy not to quit because
 

999
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,470
it's very easy not to quit because
you're like oh this is the first time

1000
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:16,480
you're like oh this is the first time
 

1001
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,910
you're like oh this is the first time
i've ever run a 50 case the first time

1002
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:17,920
i've ever run a 50 case the first time
 

1003
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,430
i've ever run a 50 case the first time
i've ever run a 50 miles the first time

1004
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:19,440
i've ever run a 50 miles the first time
 

1005
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,790
i've ever run a 50 miles the first time
ever in 100k it's the first time i've

1006
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:20,800
ever in 100k it's the first time i've
 

1007
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,030
ever in 100k it's the first time i've
ever

1008
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,040
ever
 

1009
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,310
ever
100 miles and so on and so forth and

1010
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:24,320
100 miles and so on and so forth and
 

1011
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,910
100 miles and so on and so forth and
when you're doing that for the first

1012
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:25,920
when you're doing that for the first
 

1013
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,150
when you're doing that for the first
time i think there's a heightened

1014
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:28,160
time i think there's a heightened
 

1015
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,230
time i think there's a heightened
uh motivation to not quit because you

1016
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:30,240
uh motivation to not quit because you
 

1017
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,350
uh motivation to not quit because you
don't want your first attempt to be a

1018
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:31,360
don't want your first attempt to be a
 

1019
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,949
don't want your first attempt to be a
failure

1020
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:32,959
failure
 

1021
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,710
failure
and then you get a little further along

1022
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:36,720
and then you get a little further along
 

1023
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,470
and then you get a little further along
and you start reflecting on the

1024
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:38,480
and you start reflecting on the
 

1025
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,150
and you start reflecting on the
landscape and all the opportunities that

1026
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:40,160
landscape and all the opportunities that
 

1027
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,430
landscape and all the opportunities that
are out there and you find yourself

1028
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:41,440
are out there and you find yourself
 

1029
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,110
are out there and you find yourself
quitting on an event

1030
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:43,120
quitting on an event
 

1031
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,150
quitting on an event
and there does seem to be a trend where

1032
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:46,160
and there does seem to be a trend where
 

1033
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,629
and there does seem to be a trend where
once you do that once now all of a

1034
00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:48,639
once you do that once now all of a
 

1035
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:49,269
once you do that once now all of a
sudden

1036
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:49,279
sudden
 

1037
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,990
sudden
like you you described perfectly that

1038
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:52,000
like you you described perfectly that
 

1039
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,269
like you you described perfectly that
quit

1040
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:53,279
quit
 

1041
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,310
quit
pops up in your head maybe a little

1042
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:54,320
pops up in your head maybe a little
 

1043
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,990
pops up in your head maybe a little
sooner the next time yeah or maybe a

1044
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:56,000
sooner the next time yeah or maybe a
 

1045
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,509
sooner the next time yeah or maybe a
little bit before and i've certainly had

1046
00:15:57,509 --> 00:15:57,519
little bit before and i've certainly had
 

1047
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,350
little bit before and i've certainly had
these experiences in my career as well

1048
00:15:59,350 --> 00:15:59,360
these experiences in my career as well
 

1049
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,069
these experiences in my career as well
and

1050
00:16:00,069 --> 00:16:00,079
and
 

1051
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,470
and
what happens i think if you stick with

1052
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:02,480
what happens i think if you stick with
 

1053
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,189
what happens i think if you stick with
it

1054
00:16:03,189 --> 00:16:03,199
it
 

1055
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,670
it
um again i think it is important to

1056
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:05,680
um again i think it is important to
 

1057
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,030
um again i think it is important to
assess whether you really want to be

1058
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,040
assess whether you really want to be
 

1059
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,150
assess whether you really want to be
doing what you're doing

1060
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,160
doing what you're doing
 

1061
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,310
doing what you're doing
but if you start recognizing that about

1062
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:10,320
but if you start recognizing that about
 

1063
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,749
but if you start recognizing that about
yourself in a certain activity where

1064
00:16:11,749 --> 00:16:11,759
yourself in a certain activity where
 

1065
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:12,230
yourself in a certain activity where
it's like

1066
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:12,240
it's like
 

1067
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,350
it's like
i think i might be pulling the plug

1068
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:13,360
i think i might be pulling the plug
 

1069
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,590
i think i might be pulling the plug
early on some of this stuff uh

1070
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:15,600
early on some of this stuff uh
 

1071
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,790
early on some of this stuff uh
i think you just need to kind of get

1072
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:16,800
i think you just need to kind of get
 

1073
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,350
i think you just need to kind of get
into a position where you just

1074
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:19,360
into a position where you just
 

1075
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,710
into a position where you just
at that point you need to make a

1076
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:20,720
at that point you need to make a
 

1077
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,990
at that point you need to make a
decision do i want to keep doing this if

1078
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:22,000
decision do i want to keep doing this if
 

1079
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,430
decision do i want to keep doing this if
the answer is yes

1080
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:23,440
the answer is yes
 

1081
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,269
the answer is yes
you hold yourself accountable to not

1082
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:25,279
you hold yourself accountable to not
 

1083
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,189
you hold yourself accountable to not
quitting and eventually what will happen

1084
00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:27,199
quitting and eventually what will happen
 

1085
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,870
quitting and eventually what will happen
is you'll find yourself in a position

1086
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:28,880
is you'll find yourself in a position
 

1087
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,430
is you'll find yourself in a position
where

1088
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:29,440
where
 

1089
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,790
where
i'll use ultra marathons for example

1090
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:30,800
i'll use ultra marathons for example
 

1091
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,990
i'll use ultra marathons for example
where you're just clicking on all

1092
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:32,000
where you're just clicking on all
 

1093
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,590
where you're just clicking on all
cylinders for that day

1094
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:33,600
cylinders for that day
 

1095
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,990
cylinders for that day
and you still get those scenarios where

1096
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:36,000
and you still get those scenarios where
 

1097
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,110
and you still get those scenarios where
doubt creeps in your mind

1098
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:37,120
doubt creeps in your mind
 

1099
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,030
doubt creeps in your mind
you have these low points but for

1100
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:39,040
you have these low points but for
 

1101
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,629
you have these low points but for
whatever reason when those low points

1102
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:40,639
whatever reason when those low points
 

1103
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:41,590
whatever reason when those low points
come

1104
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:41,600
come
 

1105
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,710
come
you're able to push through them better

1106
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:42,720
you're able to push through them better
 

1107
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,389
you're able to push through them better
than you would have in the past and then

1108
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:44,399
than you would have in the past and then
 

1109
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,470
than you would have in the past and then
you push through maybe two or three more

1110
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:46,480
you push through maybe two or three more
 

1111
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,590
you push through maybe two or three more
than you did

1112
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:47,600
than you did
 

1113
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,230
than you did
after you had quit the time before then

1114
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:50,240
after you had quit the time before then
 

1115
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,509
after you had quit the time before then
it's accountability time

1116
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:51,519
it's accountability time
 

1117
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,110
it's accountability time
right because then you have to look back

1118
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:53,120
right because then you have to look back
 

1119
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,550
right because then you have to look back
at that and say

1120
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:54,560
at that and say
 

1121
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,509
at that and say
well why did this time was i able to be

1122
00:16:57,509 --> 00:16:57,519
well why did this time was i able to be
 

1123
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,189
well why did this time was i able to be
mentally more strong

1124
00:16:59,189 --> 00:16:59,199
mentally more strong
 

1125
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,670
mentally more strong
and kind of push through those those

1126
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:01,680
and kind of push through those those
 

1127
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,990
and kind of push through those those
those extra opportunities to quit when i

1128
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:04,000
those extra opportunities to quit when i
 

1129
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,429
those extra opportunities to quit when i
wasn't before

1130
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:05,439
wasn't before
 

1131
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,829
wasn't before
and it can be easy to look back and say

1132
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:07,839
and it can be easy to look back and say
 

1133
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,949
and it can be easy to look back and say
and live kind of like

1134
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:08,959
and live kind of like
 

1135
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,590
and live kind of like
retroactively in the sense where you're

1136
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:11,600
retroactively in the sense where you're
 

1137
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,110
retroactively in the sense where you're
like regretting well why did i drop out

1138
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:13,120
like regretting well why did i drop out
 

1139
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,549
like regretting well why did i drop out
of those races why did i do this

1140
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:14,559
of those races why did i do this
 

1141
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,470
of those races why did i do this
wrong there and and that i just think

1142
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:16,480
wrong there and and that i just think
 

1143
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,510
wrong there and and that i just think
that's where you have to kind of catch

1144
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:17,520
that's where you have to kind of catch
 

1145
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,029
that's where you have to kind of catch
yourself and say no those opera

1146
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:19,039
yourself and say no those opera
 

1147
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,189
yourself and say no those opera
those things happen to me in order to

1148
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:21,199
those things happen to me in order to
 

1149
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,710
those things happen to me in order to
put me in a position where i decided

1150
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:22,720
put me in a position where i decided
 

1151
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,309
put me in a position where i decided
well this time i'm not gonna quit

1152
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:24,319
well this time i'm not gonna quit
 

1153
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,110
well this time i'm not gonna quit
no matter what minus my leg falling off

1154
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:27,120
no matter what minus my leg falling off
 

1155
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:27,510
no matter what minus my leg falling off
uh

1156
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:27,520
uh
 

1157
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,150
uh
like i'm not gonna quit and then you put

1158
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:30,160
like i'm not gonna quit and then you put
 

1159
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,590
like i'm not gonna quit and then you put
yourself in position to have that day

1160
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:31,600
yourself in position to have that day
 

1161
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,029
yourself in position to have that day
where you push through more times than

1162
00:17:33,029 --> 00:17:33,039
where you push through more times than
 

1163
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,150
where you push through more times than
you ever have before and you just

1164
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:34,160
you ever have before and you just
 

1165
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,990
you ever have before and you just
redefine what you're capable of

1166
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:36,000
redefine what you're capable of
 

1167
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,350
redefine what you're capable of
and then once i think you do that you

1168
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:37,360
and then once i think you do that you
 

1169
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,750
and then once i think you do that you
start looking at those earlier lessons

1170
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:39,760
start looking at those earlier lessons
 

1171
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,470
start looking at those earlier lessons
as

1172
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:40,480
as
 

1173
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,870
as
as lessons you know were they failures

1174
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:42,880
as lessons you know were they failures
 

1175
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,909
as lessons you know were they failures
on paper at the time

1176
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:43,919
on paper at the time
 

1177
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,950
on paper at the time
probably but can you pull things from

1178
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:46,960
probably but can you pull things from
 

1179
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,630
probably but can you pull things from
them to learn as to like well where is

1180
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:48,640
them to learn as to like well where is
 

1181
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,470
them to learn as to like well where is
your actual threshold where is the limit

1182
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:50,480
your actual threshold where is the limit
 

1183
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,909
your actual threshold where is the limit
actually for you

1184
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:51,919
actually for you
 

1185
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,430
actually for you
and then kind of start redefining that

1186
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:53,440
and then kind of start redefining that
 

1187
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,669
and then kind of start redefining that
stuff um

1188
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:55,679
stuff um
 

1189
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,630
stuff um
so i think like the never quit mentality

1190
00:17:58,630 --> 00:17:58,640
so i think like the never quit mentality
 

1191
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,990
so i think like the never quit mentality
can be good

1192
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:00,000
can be good
 

1193
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,750
can be good
in certain situations but i don't think

1194
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:01,760
in certain situations but i don't think
 

1195
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,669
in certain situations but i don't think
it's necessarily like a

1196
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:03,679
it's necessarily like a
 

1197
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,150
it's necessarily like a
like a holistic thing where you need to

1198
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:06,160
like a holistic thing where you need to
 

1199
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,430
like a holistic thing where you need to
be in something where it's

1200
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:07,440
be in something where it's
 

1201
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,950
be in something where it's
never quit always do more because then

1202
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:08,960
never quit always do more because then
 

1203
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,710
never quit always do more because then
you end up in a situation where you find

1204
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:10,720
you end up in a situation where you find
 

1205
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,390
you end up in a situation where you find
this like margin of diminishing returns

1206
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:12,400
this like margin of diminishing returns
 

1207
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,590
this like margin of diminishing returns
especially when it comes to training and

1208
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:13,600
especially when it comes to training and
 

1209
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,590
especially when it comes to training and
workouts and things like that where

1210
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:15,600
workouts and things like that where
 

1211
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,750
workouts and things like that where
there are times where often there are

1212
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:17,760
there are times where often there are
 

1213
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,870
there are times where often there are
times where you want to

1214
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:18,880
times where you want to
 

1215
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,390
times where you want to
actually quit a little bit before you

1216
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:20,400
actually quit a little bit before you
 

1217
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,990
actually quit a little bit before you
would have to because the stress that

1218
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:22,000
would have to because the stress that
 

1219
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,950
would have to because the stress that
was required to elicit a growth response

1220
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:24,960
was required to elicit a growth response
 

1221
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,070
was required to elicit a growth response
has already occurred and

1222
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:26,080
has already occurred and
 

1223
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,510
has already occurred and
just to do more is just gonna require

1224
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:27,520
just to do more is just gonna require
 

1225
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,029
just to do more is just gonna require
more recovery time to get back and do it

1226
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:29,039
more recovery time to get back and do it
 

1227
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:29,510
more recovery time to get back and do it
again

1228
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:29,520
again
 

1229
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,830
again
yeah this is the tricky trade-off living

1230
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:31,840
yeah this is the tricky trade-off living
 

1231
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,190
yeah this is the tricky trade-off living
by the

1232
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:33,200
by the
 

1233
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,870
by the
never quit mentality you're not going to

1234
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:34,880
never quit mentality you're not going to
 

1235
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,549
never quit mentality you're not going to
achieve optimal performance

1236
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:36,559
achieve optimal performance
 

1237
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:37,370
achieve optimal performance
in your head you might

1238
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:37,380
in your head you might
 

1239
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,150
in your head you might
[Laughter]

1240
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:40,160
[Laughter]
 

1241
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,350
[Laughter]
it seems like when you look at the full

1242
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:43,360
it seems like when you look at the full
 

1243
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,150
it seems like when you look at the full
arc of human history

1244
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:46,160
arc of human history
 

1245
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,750
arc of human history
the people who do great things

1246
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:49,760
the people who do great things
 

1247
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,470
the people who do great things
are more leaning tones than never quit

1248
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:52,480
are more leaning tones than never quit
 

1249
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:52,789
are more leaning tones than never quit
like

1250
00:18:52,789 --> 00:18:52,799
like
 

1251
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,750
like
uh i feel like at any one moment you're

1252
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:55,760
uh i feel like at any one moment you're
 

1253
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:55,990
uh i feel like at any one moment you're
more

1254
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:56,000
more
 

1255
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,669
more
in danger of quitting than you are of

1256
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:57,679
in danger of quitting than you are of
 

1257
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,750
in danger of quitting than you are of
being suboptimal

1258
00:18:59,750 --> 00:18:59,760
being suboptimal
 

1259
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,110
being suboptimal
so like in terms of advice it just feels

1260
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:03,120
so like in terms of advice it just feels
 

1261

like
 

1263
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,950
like
never quitting is always the right

never quitting is always the right
 

1265
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,549
never quitting is always the right
advice

1266

advice
 

1267
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,789
advice
unless you deeply know the person maybe

1268
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:10,799
unless you deeply know the person maybe
 

1269
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,190
unless you deeply know the person maybe
this is like wrestling mentality

1270
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:13,200
this is like wrestling mentality
 

1271
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,029
this is like wrestling mentality
i've seen too many and because i'm

1272
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:15,039
i've seen too many and because i'm
 

1273

annoyed with the current culture
telling me to relax and and have a

telling me to relax and and have a
 

1277
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,310
telling me to relax and and have a
work-life balance and all those kinds of

work-life balance and all those kinds of

things
 

1281
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,510
things
uh we should all have a deep deep truth

from the wrestling rooms like that

1300
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:45,280
from the wrestling rooms like that
 

1301
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,270
from the wrestling rooms like that
when you're pushed that way when you're

1302
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:47,280
when you're pushed that way when you're
 

1303
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,190
when you're pushed that way when you're
forced to the very limit and you don't

1304
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:49,200
forced to the very limit and you don't
 

1305
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,909
forced to the very limit and you don't
quit

1306
00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:49,919
quit
 

1307
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,230
quit
that makes better humans i think people

1308
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:52,240
that makes better humans i think people
 

1309
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,590
that makes better humans i think people
need to get that

1310
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:53,600
need to get that
 

1311
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,230
need to get that
in their life i think they need to have

1312
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:56,240
in their life i think they need to have
 

1313
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,909
in their life i think they need to have
situations where

1314
00:19:57,909 --> 00:19:57,919
situations where
 

1315
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,669
situations where
that becomes kind of the reality for

1316
00:19:59,669 --> 00:19:59,679
that becomes kind of the reality for
 

1317
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,830
that becomes kind of the reality for
them so they can see that avenue

1318
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:01,840
them so they can see that avenue
 

1319
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,390
them so they can see that avenue
experience that avenue um where i think

1320
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:04,400
experience that avenue um where i think
 

1321
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,510
experience that avenue um where i think
it's maybe

1322
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:05,520
it's maybe
 

1323
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,750
it's maybe
to the extreme is if it becomes like

1324
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:07,760
to the extreme is if it becomes like
 

1325
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,190
to the extreme is if it becomes like
your entire

1326
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:09,200
your entire
 

1327
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,909
your entire
life philosophy where like every little

1328
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:11,919
life philosophy where like every little
 

1329
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,190
life philosophy where like every little
thing you do is never quit

1330
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:13,200
thing you do is never quit
 

1331
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,310
thing you do is never quit
but life is short zach like why

1332
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:16,320
but life is short zach like why
 

1333
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,390
but life is short zach like why
i mean this is the problem i have this

1334
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:18,400
i mean this is the problem i have this
 

1335
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,990
i mean this is the problem i have this
is probably the programming thing too

1336
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:20,000
is probably the programming thing too
 

1337
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,669
is probably the programming thing too
is over optimization is dangerous

1338
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:23,679
is over optimization is dangerous
 

1339
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,070
is over optimization is dangerous
uh it's like every once in a while i

1340
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:26,080
uh it's like every once in a while i
 

1341
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,110
uh it's like every once in a while i
mean you're

1342
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,120
mean you're
 

1343
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,029
mean you're
you do this kind of stuff you're not for

1344
00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:29,039
you do this kind of stuff you're not for
 

1345
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,950
you do this kind of stuff you're not for
example with a hundred mile run you're

1346
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:30,960
example with a hundred mile run you're
 

1347
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,549
example with a hundred mile run you're
i mean you could just be doing that for

1348
00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:32,559
i mean you could just be doing that for
 

1349
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,230
i mean you could just be doing that for
the rest of your life and do like the

1350
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:34,240
the rest of your life and do like the
 

1351
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:34,549
the rest of your life and do like the
most

1352
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:34,559
most
 

1353
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,350
most
optimal 100 mile run ever but you keep

1354
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:37,360
optimal 100 mile run ever but you keep
 

1355
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,270
optimal 100 mile run ever but you keep
taking on like new challenges

1356
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:39,280
taking on like new challenges
 

1357
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,510
taking on like new challenges
and there's a lot more chaos than that

1358
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:41,520
and there's a lot more chaos than that
 

1359
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,310
and there's a lot more chaos than that
and there

1360
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:42,320
and there
 

1361
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,470
and there
it feels like the muscle of never quit

1362
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:44,480
it feels like the muscle of never quit
 

1363
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,909
it feels like the muscle of never quit
will be much more important than the

1364
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:45,919
will be much more important than the
 

1365
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,669
will be much more important than the
optimality of your training

1366
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:47,679
optimality of your training
 

1367
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,750
optimality of your training
yeah so there's probably a couple sides

1368
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:49,760
yeah so there's probably a couple sides
 

1369
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,710
yeah so there's probably a couple sides
to me

1370
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:50,720
to me
 

1371
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,350
to me
with that kind of a thing where for one

1372
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:53,360
with that kind of a thing where for one
 

1373
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:53,750
with that kind of a thing where for one
i think

1374
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:53,760
i think
 

1375
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,549
i think
when we talk about the why so like i

1376
00:20:56,549 --> 00:20:56,559
when we talk about the why so like i
 

1377
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,230
when we talk about the why so like i
think the why

1378
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:58,240
think the why
 

1379
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,390
think the why
can kind of shift a bit and it probably

1380
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:00,400
can kind of shift a bit and it probably
 

1381
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,549
can kind of shift a bit and it probably
will if you do something long enough

1382
00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:02,559
will if you do something long enough
 

1383
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,789
will if you do something long enough
or evolve maybe is a better way to call

1384
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:04,799
or evolve maybe is a better way to call
 

1385
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,230
or evolve maybe is a better way to call
to put it and for me

1386
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:06,240
to put it and for me
 

1387
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,909
to put it and for me
like one of my big drives and one of my

1388
00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:09,919
like one of my big drives and one of my
 

1389
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,350
like one of my big drives and one of my
big passions within

1390
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:11,360
big passions within
 

1391
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,789
big passions within
ultra running is to first of all find an

1392
00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:14,799
ultra running is to first of all find an
 

1393
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:15,510
ultra running is to first of all find an
event that i

1394
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:15,520
event that i
 

1395
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,190
event that i
really really love to train for and

1396
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:17,200
really really love to train for and
 

1397
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,710
really really love to train for and
participate in so for me i feel like

1398
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:18,720
participate in so for me i feel like
 

1399
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,870
participate in so for me i feel like
i've kind of identified that to a degree

1400
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:20,880
i've kind of identified that to a degree
 

1401
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,110
i've kind of identified that to a degree
and that's kind of runnable 100 milers

1402
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:23,120
and that's kind of runnable 100 milers
 

1403
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:23,909
and that's kind of runnable 100 milers
so

1404
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:23,919
so
 

1405
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,789
so
once i found that it became more of a

1406
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:26,799
once i found that it became more of a
 

1407
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,230
once i found that it became more of a
driver for me to see

1408
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:28,240
driver for me to see
 

1409
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,190
driver for me to see
like well how fast can i run 100 miles

1410
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:31,200
like well how fast can i run 100 miles
 

1411
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,630
like well how fast can i run 100 miles
in a very controlled environment so

1412
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:32,640
in a very controlled environment so
 

1413
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,510
in a very controlled environment so
let's eliminate

1414
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:33,520
let's eliminate
 

1415
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,750
let's eliminate
weather let's eliminate you know

1416
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:35,760
weather let's eliminate you know
 

1417
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,630
weather let's eliminate you know
elevation

1418
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:36,640
elevation
 

1419
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,870
elevation
let's eliminate like having to wait

1420
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:38,880
let's eliminate like having to wait
 

1421
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,110
let's eliminate like having to wait
extra long to get crew or support

1422
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:41,120
extra long to get crew or support
 

1423
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,070
extra long to get crew or support
and that sort of thing and that's how

1424
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:42,080
and that sort of thing and that's how
 

1425
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,990
and that sort of thing and that's how
you find yourself on a 400 meter track

1426
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:44,000
you find yourself on a 400 meter track
 

1427
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,590
you find yourself on a 400 meter track
running 100 miles

1428
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:45,600
running 100 miles
 

1429
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,590
running 100 miles
but for me like the important part of

1430
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:47,600
but for me like the important part of
 

1431
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,630
but for me like the important part of
that is that

1432
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:48,640
that is that
 

1433
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,070
that is that
i can control the environment enough

1434
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:50,080
i can control the environment enough
 

1435
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,510
i can control the environment enough
where if i come back year after year

1436
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:53,520
where if i come back year after year
 

1437
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,310
where if i come back year after year
i can re-test myself and have a decent

1438
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:56,320
i can re-test myself and have a decent
 

1439
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,149
i can re-test myself and have a decent
ability to kind of say i improved or i

1440
00:21:58,149 --> 00:21:58,159
ability to kind of say i improved or i
 

1441
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,830
ability to kind of say i improved or i
regressed or i stayed stagnant and i

1442
00:21:59,830 --> 00:21:59,840
regressed or i stayed stagnant and i
 

1443
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,830
regressed or i stayed stagnant and i
think that's a big driver for me

1444
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:01,840
think that's a big driver for me
 

1445
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,990
think that's a big driver for me
um but one thing i've recognized within

1446
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:04,000
um but one thing i've recognized within
 

1447
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,870
um but one thing i've recognized within
that

1448
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:04,880
that
 

1449
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,830
that
is if you just keep doing that like if i

1450
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:07,840
is if you just keep doing that like if i
 

1451
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,110
is if you just keep doing that like if i
could probably pick

1452
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:09,120
could probably pick
 

1453
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,430
could probably pick
three flat runnable hundred milers a

1454
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:11,440
three flat runnable hundred milers a
 

1455
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,310
three flat runnable hundred milers a
year

1456
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:12,320
year
 

1457
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,190
year
and optimally prepare race recover and

1458
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:15,200
and optimally prepare race recover and
 

1459
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,070
and optimally prepare race recover and
repeat

1460
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:16,080
repeat
 

1461
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,950
repeat

offseason but then i'm gonna ultimately
 

1525
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,470
offseason but then i'm gonna ultimately
build up in peak for another one i might

1526
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:16,480
build up in peak for another one i might
 

1527

build up in peak for another one i might
introduce some fun trail races in the

1528
00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:18,159
introduce some fun trail races in the
 

1529
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,029
introduce some fun trail races in the
context

1530
00:23:19,029 --> 00:23:19,039
context
 

1531
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,230
context
but they're gonna be b races they're

1532
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:20,240
but they're gonna be b races they're
 

1533

but they're gonna be b races they're
gonna be training races time on feet

1534
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:21,760
gonna be training races time on feet
 

1535
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,190
gonna be training races time on feet
type of stuff that are gonna kind of

1536
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:23,200
type of stuff that are gonna kind of
 

1537
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,510
type of stuff that are gonna kind of
mimic like a long run essentially

1538
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:25,520
mimic like a long run essentially
 

1539
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,669
mimic like a long run essentially
and uh but the main focus the always in

1540
00:23:27,669 --> 00:23:27,679
and uh but the main focus the always in
 

1541
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:28,950
and uh but the main focus the always in
the back of my mind was like

1542
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:28,960
the back of my mind was like
 

1543
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,950
the back of my mind was like
getting on the track and seeing how much

1544
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:30,960
getting on the track and seeing how much
 

1545
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,630
getting on the track and seeing how much
faster i can 100 miles and that just

1546
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:32,640
faster i can 100 miles and that just
 

1547
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,110
faster i can 100 miles and that just
kind of

1548
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:33,120
kind of
 

1549
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,590
kind of
that energy that it takes to continually

1550
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:35,600
that energy that it takes to continually
 

1551
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,870
that energy that it takes to continually
think by that that

1552
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:36,880
think by that that
 

1553
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,870
think by that that
i think the motivation to keep that

1554
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:38,880
i think the motivation to keep that
 

1555
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,269
i think the motivation to keep that
stoke high enough to really meet your

1556
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:41,279
stoke high enough to really meet your
 

1557
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:42,630
stoke high enough to really meet your
full potential

1558
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:42,640
full potential
 

1559
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,149
full potential
fades if you don't step away from it for

1560
00:23:44,149 --> 00:23:44,159
fades if you don't step away from it for
 

1561
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,149
fades if you don't step away from it for
a little bit so i took

1562
00:23:46,149 --> 00:23:46,159
a little bit so i took
 

1563
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,310
a little bit so i took
essentially half a year away from

1564
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:48,320
essentially half a year away from
 

1565
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,830
essentially half a year away from
runnable stuff and just decided i'm

1566
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:49,840
runnable stuff and just decided i'm
 

1567
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,350
runnable stuff and just decided i'm
gonna prepare for the san diego hundred

1568
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:51,360
gonna prepare for the san diego hundred
 

1569
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,149
gonna prepare for the san diego hundred
mile

1570
00:23:52,149 --> 00:23:52,159
mile
 

1571
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,590
mile
which is like a much more elevation

1572
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:55,600
which is like a much more elevation
 

1573
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,990
which is like a much more elevation
uh technical trail type of an event

1574
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:58,000
uh technical trail type of an event
 

1575
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,350
uh technical trail type of an event
isn't that trail run or no

1576
00:23:59,350 --> 00:23:59,360
isn't that trail run or no
 

1577
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,310
isn't that trail run or no
yeah it's a trail hundred miler uh

1578
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:02,320
yeah it's a trail hundred miler uh
 

1579
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,310
yeah it's a trail hundred miler uh
actually just talking just outside of uh

1580
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:04,320
actually just talking just outside of uh
 

1581
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,590
actually just talking just outside of uh
uh san diego and yeah it goes through

1582
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:07,600
uh san diego and yeah it goes through
 

1583
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,350
uh san diego and yeah it goes through
it goes over part of the pacific crest

1584
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:09,360
it goes over part of the pacific crest
 

1585
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,269
it goes over part of the pacific crest
trail and stuff so it's very different

1586
00:24:11,269 --> 00:24:11,279
trail and stuff so it's very different
 

1587
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,190
trail and stuff so it's very different
than running on a runnable surface so

1588
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:13,200
than running on a runnable surface so
 

1589
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,750
than running on a runnable surface so
to give you some context like i ran was

1590
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:15,760
to give you some context like i ran was
 

1591
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,669
to give you some context like i ran was
it i think just under 17 hours for that

1592
00:24:17,669 --> 00:24:17,679
it i think just under 17 hours for that
 

1593
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:17,990
it i think just under 17 hours for that
race

1594
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:18,000
race
 

1595
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,750
race
whereas on a flat surface i can run 11

1596
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:19,760
whereas on a flat surface i can run 11
 

1597
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,430
whereas on a flat surface i can run 11
hours and 19 minutes so

1598
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:21,440
hours and 19 minutes so
 

1599
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,390
hours and 19 minutes so
just the environment alone added an

1600
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:24,400
just the environment alone added an
 

1601
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,430
just the environment alone added an
extra

1602
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:25,440
extra
 

1603
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,470
extra
you know five plus hours to the day so

1604
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:28,480
you know five plus hours to the day so
 

1605
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,070
you know five plus hours to the day so
um it's just a different experience

1606
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:30,080
um it's just a different experience
 

1607
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,070
um it's just a different experience
different skill set and what it did is

1608
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:32,080
different skill set and what it did is
 

1609
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,950
different skill set and what it did is
it allowed me to kind of step away from

1610
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:34,960
it allowed me to kind of step away from
 

1611
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,430
it allowed me to kind of step away from
kind of focusing on like splits on a

1612
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:37,440
kind of focusing on like splits on a
 

1613
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,390
kind of focusing on like splits on a
track

1614
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:38,400
track
 

1615
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,110
track
uh running flat stuff like preparing for

1616
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:41,120
uh running flat stuff like preparing for
 

1617
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,470
uh running flat stuff like preparing for
things specifically for a flat

1618
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:42,480
things specifically for a flat
 

1619
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,669

something that's more

1622
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:44,960
something that's more
 

1623
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,789
something that's more
climbing into sending more technical

1624
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:46,799
climbing into sending more technical
 

1625
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,029
climbing into sending more technical
running skill sets and things like that

1626
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:49,039
running skill sets and things like that
 

1627
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,990
running skill sets and things like that
and the cool part about it was uh first

1628
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,000
and the cool part about it was uh first
 

1629
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,669
and the cool part about it was uh first
of all you know when you step away from

1630
00:24:53,669 --> 00:24:53,679
of all you know when you step away from
 

1631
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:54,950
of all you know when you step away from
something and enter something a lot

1632
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:54,960
something and enter something a lot
 

1633
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,310
something and enter something a lot
different i mean it's still running

1634
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:56,320
different i mean it's still running
 

1635
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,990
different i mean it's still running
there's still a huge

1636
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:58,000
there's still a huge
 

1637
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,430
there's still a huge
advantage i had from the running i'd

1638
00:24:59,430 --> 00:24:59,440
advantage i had from the running i'd
 

1639
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,470
advantage i had from the running i'd
done in the past that was going to put

1640
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:00,480
done in the past that was going to put
 

1641
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,630
done in the past that was going to put
me in a good position to be successful

1642
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:02,640
me in a good position to be successful
 

1643
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,669
me in a good position to be successful
but there was a much higher uh

1644
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:05,679
but there was a much higher uh
 

1645
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,430
but there was a much higher uh
or a much bigger range of potential

1646
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:07,440
or a much bigger range of potential
 

1647
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,710
or a much bigger range of potential
improvement for me

1648
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:08,720
improvement for me
 

1649
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,110
improvement for me
so through the like you know four plus

trying to get first
so still a race yeah so what was the

1672
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:31,039
so still a race yeah so what was the
 

1673
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:32,310
so still a race yeah so what was the
enjoyable aspect of it

1674
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:32,320
enjoyable aspect of it
 

1675
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,669
enjoyable aspect of it
i don't think i recognized it so much

1676
00:25:33,669 --> 00:25:33,679
i don't think i recognized it so much
 

1677
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,750
i don't think i recognized it so much
while i was doing it actually it

1678
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:35,760
while i was doing it actually it
 

1679
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,789
while i was doing it actually it
surfaced afterwards

1680
00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:36,799
surfaced afterwards
 

1681
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,149
surfaced afterwards
i mean the enjoyment of the race itself

1682
00:25:38,149 --> 00:25:38,159
i mean the enjoyment of the race itself
 

1683
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,190
i mean the enjoyment of the race itself
is like when you find yourself in a

1684
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:39,200
is like when you find yourself in a
 

1685
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,470
is like when you find yourself in a
position where you're sitting in

1686
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:40,480
position where you're sitting in
 

1687
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,149
position where you're sitting in
basically second place all day long and

1688
00:25:42,149 --> 00:25:42,159
basically second place all day long and
 

1689
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:43,830
basically second place all day long and
then you take the lead at 90

1690
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:43,840
then you take the lead at 90
 

1691
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,470
then you take the lead at 90
i think it was like 91 or 92 miles nice

1692
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:46,480
i think it was like 91 or 92 miles nice
 

1693
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,269
i think it was like 91 or 92 miles nice
it's like

1694
00:25:47,269 --> 00:25:47,279
it's like
 

1695
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,590
it's like
yeah that's kind of a cool way to race

1696
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:49,600
yeah that's kind of a cool way to race
 

1697
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,710
yeah that's kind of a cool way to race
um yeah

1698
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:50,720
um yeah
 

1699
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,470
um yeah
but afterwards i recognized a few things

1700
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:52,480
but afterwards i recognized a few things
 

1701
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,909
but afterwards i recognized a few things
just about kind of pacing

1702
00:25:53,909 --> 00:25:53,919
just about kind of pacing
 

1703
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,269
just about kind of pacing
and you know how to maybe pace the first

1704
00:25:57,269 --> 00:25:57,279
and you know how to maybe pace the first
 

1705
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,470
and you know how to maybe pace the first
half of a hundred miler

1706
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:58,480
half of a hundred miler
 

1707
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,269
half of a hundred miler
versus the second half i also recognized

1708
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:01,279
versus the second half i also recognized
 

1709
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,710
versus the second half i also recognized
shortly thereafter

1710
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:02,720
shortly thereafter
 

1711
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,110
shortly thereafter
uh once i finished recovered and decided

1712
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:05,120
uh once i finished recovered and decided
 

1713
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,630
uh once i finished recovered and decided
my next event was going to be a flat

1714
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:06,640
my next event was going to be a flat
 

1715
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,990
my next event was going to be a flat
runnable race

1716
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:08,000
runnable race
 

1717
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,950
runnable race
that wow i really was way more excited

1718
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:10,960
that wow i really was way more excited
 

1719
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,909
that wow i really was way more excited
to do the workouts

1720
00:26:11,909 --> 00:26:11,919
to do the workouts
 

1721
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,830
to do the workouts
that i needed to do to get ready to run

1722
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:13,840
that i needed to do to get ready to run
 

1723
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,269
that i needed to do to get ready to run
a fast flat hundred miler

1724
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:15,279
a fast flat hundred miler
 

1725
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:16,310
a fast flat hundred miler
and i don't think that would have been

1726
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:16,320
and i don't think that would have been
 

1727
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,149
and i don't think that would have been
the case had i just tried to do another

1728
00:26:18,149 --> 00:26:18,159
the case had i just tried to do another
 

1729
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,149
the case had i just tried to do another
flat fast hundred miler

1730
00:26:20,149 --> 00:26:20,159
flat fast hundred miler
 

1731
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,549
flat fast hundred miler
earlier or during that year and end up

1732
00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:22,559
earlier or during that year and end up
 

1733
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:23,990
earlier or during that year and end up
in a situation where like i

1734
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:24,000
in a situation where like i
 

1735
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,830
in a situation where like i
maybe had like normalized a sub-optimal

1736
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:27,840
maybe had like normalized a sub-optimal
 

1737
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,549
maybe had like normalized a sub-optimal
like uh outlook on like something that i

1738
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:30,559
like uh outlook on like something that i
 

1739
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,870
like uh outlook on like something that i
just done so many times already

1740
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:32,880
just done so many times already
 

1741
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,029
just done so many times already
and i recognized that just every workout

1742
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:35,039
and i recognized that just every workout
 

1743
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,710
and i recognized that just every workout
i did i was like i did this workout a

year ago and it was not nearly this much
 

1747
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,590
year ago and it was not nearly this much
fun

1748

00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,269
motivated to go out there saturday and
sunday and do those back-to-back long

1780
00:27:03,269 --> 00:27:03,279
sunday and do those back-to-back long
 

1781
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:05,029
sunday and do those back-to-back long
runs and see the progress

1782
00:27:05,029 --> 00:27:05,039
runs and see the progress
 

1783
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,149
runs and see the progress
and then head out again the next we can

1784
00:27:06,149 --> 00:27:06,159
and then head out again the next we can
 

1785
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,310
and then head out again the next we can
do it again so i had some of my

1786
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:08,320
do it again so i had some of my
 

1787
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,909
do it again so i had some of my
more enjoyable long runs which are going

1788
00:27:09,909 --> 00:27:09,919
more enjoyable long runs which are going
 

1789
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,350
more enjoyable long runs which are going
to be the most specific to race day

1790
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:11,360
to be the most specific to race day
 

1791
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,789
to be the most specific to race day
environment that i had

1792
00:27:12,789 --> 00:27:12,799
environment that i had
 

1793
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,549
environment that i had
in quite some time and i think that was

1794
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:14,559
in quite some time and i think that was
 

1795
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,390
in quite some time and i think that was
really beneficial and kind of putting me

1796
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:16,400
really beneficial and kind of putting me
 

1797
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,669
really beneficial and kind of putting me
in the right spot to be able to push

1798
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:17,679
in the right spot to be able to push
 

1799
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,269
in the right spot to be able to push
through barriers on race day

1800
00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:19,279
through barriers on race day
 

1801
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,710
through barriers on race day
and put me in a position where quitting

1802
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:20,720
and put me in a position where quitting
 

1803
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,549
and put me in a position where quitting
was going to be much less of a

1804
00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:22,559
was going to be much less of a
 

1805
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:23,750
was going to be much less of a
likelihood

1806
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:23,760
likelihood
 

1807
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,430
likelihood
given the enjoyment i had in the months

1808
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:25,440
given the enjoyment i had in the months
 

1809
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,029
given the enjoyment i had in the months
leading into the race itself yeah even

1810
00:27:27,029 --> 00:27:27,039
leading into the race itself yeah even
 

1811
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,149
leading into the race itself yeah even
the thought of quitting

1812
00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:28,159
the thought of quitting
 

1813
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,350
the thought of quitting
yeah yeah so you mentioned the track

1814
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:31,360
yeah yeah so you mentioned the track
 

1815
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,950
yeah yeah so you mentioned the track
you've also ran 100 miles on the

1816
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:32,960
you've also ran 100 miles on the
 

1817
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,870
you've also ran 100 miles on the
treadmill and

1818
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:34,880
treadmill and
 

1819
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,590
treadmill and
the trail 100 mile broadly if we zoom

1820
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:37,600
the trail 100 mile broadly if we zoom
 

1821
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:37,990
the trail 100 mile broadly if we zoom
out

1822
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:38,000
out
 

1823
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,269
out
what does it take to run 100 miles

1824
00:27:41,269 --> 00:27:41,279
what does it take to run 100 miles
 

1825
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,149
what does it take to run 100 miles
for for most of the world that seems

1826
00:27:44,149 --> 00:27:44,159
for for most of the world that seems
 

1827
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,549
for for most of the world that seems
like a crazy distance to run

1828
00:27:46,549 --> 00:27:46,559
like a crazy distance to run
 

1829
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,950
like a crazy distance to run
so maybe it's interesting to ask not

1830
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:48,960
so maybe it's interesting to ask not
 

1831
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,470
so maybe it's interesting to ask not
only is just setting the world record

1832
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:50,480
only is just setting the world record
 

1833
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,269
only is just setting the world record
but

1834
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:51,279
but
 

1835
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,470
but
purely running what does it take to run

1836
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:54,480
purely running what does it take to run
 

1837
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,549
purely running what does it take to run
that far yeah i mean i think people

1838
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:56,559
that far yeah i mean i think people
 

1839
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,549
that far yeah i mean i think people
probably overestimate what it takes

1840
00:27:58,549 --> 00:27:58,559
probably overestimate what it takes
 

1841
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,710
probably overestimate what it takes
in terms of just getting it done i think

1842
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:00,720
in terms of just getting it done i think
 

1843
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,470
in terms of just getting it done i think
this is consistent

1844
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:02,480
this is consistent
 

1845
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,190
this is consistent
in just running in general i think the

1846
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:05,200
in just running in general i think the
 

1847
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,630
in just running in general i think the
marathon was always a big one with that

1848
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:06,640
marathon was always a big one with that
 

1849
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,710
marathon was always a big one with that
where people thought like well

1850
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:08,720
where people thought like well
 

1851
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,789
where people thought like well
you have to do this training or you just

1852
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:10,799
you have to do this training or you just
 

1853
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,310
you have to do this training or you just
literally won't physically be able to

1854
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:12,320
literally won't physically be able to
 

1855
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,149
literally won't physically be able to
complete a marathon and then we got into

1856
00:28:14,149 --> 00:28:14,159
complete a marathon and then we got into
 

1857
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,710
complete a marathon and then we got into
an era of kind of like running as

1858
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:16,720
an era of kind of like running as
 

1859
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,310
an era of kind of like running as
more of an enjoyment thing versus a

1860
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:18,320
more of an enjoyment thing versus a
 

1861
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,830
more of an enjoyment thing versus a
performance thing and then you'd have

1862
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:19,840
performance thing and then you'd have
 

1863
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,710
performance thing and then you'd have
people running

1864
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:20,720
people running
 

1865
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,149
people running
granted much slower i think if you look

1866
00:28:22,149 --> 00:28:22,159
granted much slower i think if you look
 

1867
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,070
granted much slower i think if you look
at the boston marathon average finishing

1868
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:24,080
at the boston marathon average finishing
 

1869
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,710
at the boston marathon average finishing
times it

1870
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:24,720
times it
 

1871
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,389
times it
goes from like or maybe it wasn't the

1872
00:28:26,389 --> 00:28:26,399
goes from like or maybe it wasn't the
 

1873
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:27,430
goes from like or maybe it wasn't the
boston marathon it might have just been

1874
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:27,440
boston marathon it might have just been
 

1875
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,950
boston marathon it might have just been
marathons in general went from like

1876
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:28,960
marathons in general went from like
 

1877
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,710
marathons in general went from like
three hours to five hours or something

1878
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:30,720
three hours to five hours or something
 

1879
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,510
three hours to five hours or something
like that

1880
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:31,520
like that
 

1881
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,990
like that
so it's like people i think got past the

1882
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:34,000
so it's like people i think got past the
 

1883
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,190
so it's like people i think got past the
fact that

1884
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:35,200
fact that
 

1885
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,870
fact that
you can only do it if you're optimally

1886
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:36,880
you can only do it if you're optimally
 

1887
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,789
you can only do it if you're optimally
prepared to well i can do it and maybe

1888
00:28:38,789 --> 00:28:38,799
prepared to well i can do it and maybe
 

1889
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,630
prepared to well i can do it and maybe
not meet my full potential if i'm gonna

1890
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:40,640
not meet my full potential if i'm gonna
 

1891
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,190
not meet my full potential if i'm gonna
like

1892
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:41,200
like
 

1893
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,190
like
not do much training which i wouldn't

1894
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:43,200
not do much training which i wouldn't
 

1895
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,710
not do much training which i wouldn't
necessarily advise but

1896
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:44,720
necessarily advise but
 

1897
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,950
necessarily advise but
uh i mean i've i've talked to people who

1898
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:46,960
uh i mean i've i've talked to people who
 

1899
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,789
uh i mean i've i've talked to people who
basically run 100 miles sometimes almost

1900
00:28:48,789 --> 00:28:48,799
basically run 100 miles sometimes almost
 

1901
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:49,830
basically run 100 miles sometimes almost
off the couch and it's

1902
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:49,840
off the couch and it's
 

1903
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,230
off the couch and it's
like it's to me what that says is just

1904
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:52,240
like it's to me what that says is just
 

1905
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,669
like it's to me what that says is just
the human body is incredible

1906
00:28:53,669 --> 00:28:53,679
the human body is incredible
 

1907
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:55,029
the human body is incredible
and what it can tolerate above and

1908
00:28:55,029 --> 00:28:55,039
and what it can tolerate above and
 

1909
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,630
and what it can tolerate above and
beyond what it's been exposed to if it

1910
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:56,640
beyond what it's been exposed to if it
 

1911
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,470
beyond what it's been exposed to if it
has to or if it feels like it has to

1912
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:58,480
has to or if it feels like it has to
 

1913
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,710
has to or if it feels like it has to
so that's the basic sort of getting from

1914
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:00,720
so that's the basic sort of getting from
 

1915
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,669
so that's the basic sort of getting from
point a

1916
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:01,679
point a
 

1917
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,830
point a
from the start to the finish it's the

1918
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:03,840
from the start to the finish it's the
 

1919
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,750
from the start to the finish it's the
human body and the human mind is capable

1920
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:05,760
human body and the human mind is capable
 

1921
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,149
human body and the human mind is capable
of doing it without much preparation

1922
00:29:08,149 --> 00:29:08,159
of doing it without much preparation
 

1923
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,190
of doing it without much preparation
but then you start to increase the

1924
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:11,200
but then you start to increase the
 

1925
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,350
but then you start to increase the
the goal of performance and you try to

1926
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:13,360
the goal of performance and you try to
 

1927
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,630
the goal of performance and you try to
get actually a good

1928
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:14,640
get actually a good
 

1929
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,789
get actually a good
like the most out of your body that you

1930
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:16,799
like the most out of your body that you
 

1931
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:17,909
like the most out of your body that you
can

1932
00:29:17,909 --> 00:29:17,919
can
 

1933
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,149
can
how does that start to change then yeah

1934
00:29:20,149 --> 00:29:20,159
how does that start to change then yeah
 

1935
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:21,909
how does that start to change then yeah
going from fun to performance

1936
00:29:21,909 --> 00:29:21,919
going from fun to performance
 

1937
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:24,070
going from fun to performance
yeah i think uh once you start putting

1938
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:24,080
yeah i think uh once you start putting
 

1939
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,990
yeah i think uh once you start putting
marks or goals on outside of just

1940
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:26,000
marks or goals on outside of just
 

1941
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,430
marks or goals on outside of just
finishing that's where it starts getting

1942
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:27,440
finishing that's where it starts getting
 

1943
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,789
finishing that's where it starts getting
interesting because now you can maybe go

1944
00:29:28,789 --> 00:29:28,799
interesting because now you can maybe go
 

1945
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,789
interesting because now you can maybe go
in with multiple goals where like if one

1946
00:29:30,789 --> 00:29:30,799
in with multiple goals where like if one
 

1947
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:31,750
in with multiple goals where like if one
falls off

1948
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:31,760
falls off
 

1949
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,190
falls off
due to something that you didn't expect

1950
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:33,200
due to something that you didn't expect
 

1951
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,029
due to something that you didn't expect
then you have another one to target but

1952
00:29:35,029 --> 00:29:35,039
then you have another one to target but
 

1953
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,710
then you have another one to target but
you can always build those up and try to

1954
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:36,720
you can always build those up and try to
 

1955
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,990
you can always build those up and try to
think like well i want to run faster

1956
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:38,000
think like well i want to run faster
 

1957
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,350
think like well i want to run faster
than last time or i want to

1958
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:39,360
than last time or i want to
 

1959
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,669
than last time or i want to
you know break a course record or an age

1960
00:29:41,669 --> 00:29:41,679
you know break a course record or an age
 

1961
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,830
you know break a course record or an age
group record or something like that

1962
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:43,840
group record or something like that
 

1963
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,950
group record or something like that
and that that i think is just going to

1964
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:46,960
and that that i think is just going to
 

1965
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,310
and that that i think is just going to
be a little bit of a different mindset

1966
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:48,320
be a little bit of a different mindset
 

1967
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,990
be a little bit of a different mindset
because now you're looking at

1968
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:50,000
because now you're looking at
 

1969
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,870
because now you're looking at
every little thing from what do i need

1970
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:52,880
every little thing from what do i need
 

1971
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,310
every little thing from what do i need
to do to prepare as well as what do i

1972
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:54,320
to do to prepare as well as what do i
 

1973
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,590
to do to prepare as well as what do i
need to do to be efficient on the day

1974
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:55,600
need to do to be efficient on the day
 

1975
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,149
need to do to be efficient on the day
itself

1976
00:29:56,149 --> 00:29:56,159
itself
 

1977
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,310
itself
so like transitioning aid stations and

1978
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:58,320
so like transitioning aid stations and
 

1979
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,750
so like transitioning aid stations and
things like that or

1980
00:29:59,750 --> 00:29:59,760
things like that or
 

1981
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,549
things like that or
uh do i want a pacer or not or does this

1982
00:30:02,549 --> 00:30:02,559
uh do i want a pacer or not or does this
 

1983
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:03,269
uh do i want a pacer or not or does this
race allow

1984
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:03,279
race allow
 

1985
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,909
race allow
someone to like hand me a bottle at a

1986
00:30:05,909 --> 00:30:05,919
someone to like hand me a bottle at a
 

1987
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:07,190
someone to like hand me a bottle at a
certain spot or do i have to be in

1988
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:07,200
certain spot or do i have to be in
 

1989
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,950
certain spot or do i have to be in
specific areas to get that type of stuff

1990
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:08,960
specific areas to get that type of stuff
 

1991
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,590
specific areas to get that type of stuff
and

1992
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:09,600
and
 

1993
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,990
and
and what it ends up doing is it ends up

1994
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:12,000
and what it ends up doing is it ends up
 

1995
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,590
and what it ends up doing is it ends up
bringing a lot more variables to the

1996
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:13,600
bringing a lot more variables to the
 

1997
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,470
bringing a lot more variables to the
table

1998
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:14,480
table
 

1999
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,830
table
and i think it's it's interesting

2000
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:15,840
and i think it's it's interesting
 

2001
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,669
and i think it's it's interesting
because there's always going to be more

2002
00:30:17,669 --> 00:30:17,679
because there's always going to be more
 

2003
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:18,549
because there's always going to be more
variables

2004
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:18,559
variables
 

2005
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,909
variables
on the day than you are able to account

2006
00:30:21,909 --> 00:30:21,919
on the day than you are able to account
 

2007
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:22,789
on the day than you are able to account
for

2008
00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:22,799
for
 

2009
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,710
for
so at a certain degree you have to kind

2010
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:24,720
so at a certain degree you have to kind
 

2011
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,070
so at a certain degree you have to kind
of find yourself in a position where i'm

2012
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:26,080
of find yourself in a position where i'm
 

2013
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,830
of find yourself in a position where i'm
gonna make sure i take care of the big

2014
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:27,840
gonna make sure i take care of the big
 

2015
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,470
gonna make sure i take care of the big
ones

2016
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:28,480
ones
 

2017
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,070
ones
or the ones that are like obviously i

2018
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:30,080
or the ones that are like obviously i
 

2019
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,070
or the ones that are like obviously i
need to be ready for like my fueling

2020
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:32,080
need to be ready for like my fueling
 

2021
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,310
need to be ready for like my fueling

strategy
 

2025
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,549
strategy
you know what workouts are going to put

2026
00:30:36,549 --> 00:30:36,559
you know what workouts are going to put
 

2027
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,549
you know what workouts are going to put
me in a position to physiologically

2028
00:30:38,549 --> 00:30:38,559
me in a position to physiologically
 

2029
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:41,269
me in a position to physiologically
have this process go as well as possible

2030
00:30:41,269 --> 00:30:41,279
have this process go as well as possible
 

2031
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:42,470
have this process go as well as possible
how am i going to like

2032
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:42,480
how am i going to like
 

2033
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,230
how am i going to like
you know hold myself accountable in aid

2034
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:44,240
you know hold myself accountable in aid
 

2035
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,070
you know hold myself accountable in aid
station transition so i'm not like

2036
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:46,080
station transition so i'm not like
 

2037
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,630
station transition so i'm not like
having a ton of non-moving time uh

2038
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:48,640
having a ton of non-moving time uh
 

2039
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,630
having a ton of non-moving time uh
versus moving time and that's so cool

2040
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:50,640
versus moving time and that's so cool
 

2041
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,190
versus moving time and that's so cool
so there's these like big variables that

2042
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:53,200
so there's these like big variables that
 

2043
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,389
so there's these like big variables that
you're aware of and you're trying to

2044
00:30:54,389 --> 00:30:54,399
you're aware of and you're trying to
 

2045
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,470
you're aware of and you're trying to
optimize over the space of variables

2046
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:56,480
optimize over the space of variables
 

2047
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,549
optimize over the space of variables
so you get to start to play with that

2048
00:30:58,549 --> 00:30:58,559
so you get to start to play with that
 

2049
00:30:58,559 --> 00:30:59,990
so you get to start to play with that
when you're looking for performance

2050
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:00,000
when you're looking for performance
 

2051
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,509
when you're looking for performance
it's almost like moving from checkers to

2052
00:31:01,509 --> 00:31:01,519
it's almost like moving from checkers to
 

2053
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,190
it's almost like moving from checkers to
chess right you have like

2054
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:03,200
chess right you have like
 

2055
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,669
chess right you have like
or maybe even like connect four or

2056
00:31:05,669 --> 00:31:05,679
or maybe even like connect four or
 

2057
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:06,870
or maybe even like connect four or
something like that

2058
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:06,880
something like that
 

2059
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,230
something like that
where it goes from just kind of like

2060
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:08,240
where it goes from just kind of like
 

2061
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,830
where it goes from just kind of like
well one foot in front of the other and

2062
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:09,840
well one foot in front of the other and
 

2063
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,950
well one foot in front of the other and
when i get to the next stage station

2064
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:10,960
when i get to the next stage station
 

2065
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,230
when i get to the next stage station
i'll just eat whatever looks good drink

2066
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:12,240
i'll just eat whatever looks good drink
 

2067
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:12,789
i'll just eat whatever looks good drink
whatever

2068
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:12,799
whatever
 

2069
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:13,909
whatever
you know quenches my thirst and then

2070
00:31:13,909 --> 00:31:13,919
you know quenches my thirst and then
 

2071
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,389
you know quenches my thirst and then
move on to the next one to like

2072
00:31:16,389 --> 00:31:16,399
move on to the next one to like
 

2073
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:17,990
move on to the next one to like
well which one of these food products is

2074
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:18,000
well which one of these food products is
 

2075
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,110
well which one of these food products is
actually going to make me move a little

2076
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:19,120
actually going to make me move a little
 

2077
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,470
actually going to make me move a little
faster the next aid station

2078
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:20,480
faster the next aid station
 

2079
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,110
faster the next aid station
or you know which one of these pacing

2080
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:23,120
or you know which one of these pacing
 

2081
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,310
or you know which one of these pacing
strategies is going to get me to the

2082
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:24,320
strategies is going to get me to the
 

2083
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,509
strategies is going to get me to the
finish line

2084
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:25,519
finish line
 

2085
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,269
finish line
faster than the other one and that sort

2086
00:31:27,269 --> 00:31:27,279
faster than the other one and that sort
 

2087
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,549
faster than the other one and that sort
of stuff so

2088
00:31:28,549 --> 00:31:28,559
of stuff so
 

2089
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:31,190
of stuff so
uh it gets more complicated more

2090
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:31,200
uh it gets more complicated more
 

2091
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,230
uh it gets more complicated more
interesting

2092
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:32,240
interesting
 

2093
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,710
interesting
and uh in my opinion anyway also there i

2094
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:34,720
and uh in my opinion anyway also there i
 

2095
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,669
and uh in my opinion anyway also there i
mean but there's a breaking point with

2096
00:31:35,669 --> 00:31:35,679
mean but there's a breaking point with
 

2097
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:36,789
mean but there's a breaking point with
that too because

2098
00:31:36,789 --> 00:31:36,799
that too because
 

2099
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,549
that too because
like i said there's an endless number of

2100
00:31:38,549 --> 00:31:38,559
like i said there's an endless number of
 

2101
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,710
like i said there's an endless number of
variables you could account for

2102
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:40,720
variables you could account for
 

2103
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,389
variables you could account for
and as a distance gets longer that list

2104
00:31:42,389 --> 00:31:42,399
and as a distance gets longer that list
 

2105
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,230
and as a distance gets longer that list
gets longer too so

2106
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:44,240
gets longer too so
 

2107
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,389
gets longer too so
you find yourself in this position where

2108
00:31:46,389 --> 00:31:46,399
you find yourself in this position where
 

2109
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,230
you find yourself in this position where
where you have to at some point say okay

2110
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:48,240
where you have to at some point say okay
 

2111
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,509
where you have to at some point say okay
i've accounted for everything i can

2112
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:49,519
i've accounted for everything i can
 

2113
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,110
i've accounted for everything i can
reasonably account for

reasonably account for
now i need to be in a mental space where

2116
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:52,880
now i need to be in a mental space where
 

2117
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,630
now i need to be in a mental space where
when something happens that i wasn't

2118
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:54,640
when something happens that i wasn't
 

2119
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,669
when something happens that i wasn't
able to account for

2120
00:31:55,669 --> 00:31:55,679
able to account for
 

2121
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,830
able to account for
i'm able to respond to it with the right

2122
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:57,840
i'm able to respond to it with the right
 

2123
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,750
i'm able to respond to it with the right
decision and keep going and not dwell on

2124
00:31:59,750 --> 00:31:59,760
decision and keep going and not dwell on
 

2125
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,310
decision and keep going and not dwell on
it

2126
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:00,320
it
 

2127
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,190
it
because that's another thing i mean

2128
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:01,200
because that's another thing i mean

00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:03,750
you're running slow enough when you're
doing 100 miles where if you make a

mistake
 

2135
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,870
mistake
you can sit there and just fixate on

2136
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:06,880
you can sit there and just fixate on
 

2137
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,710
you can sit there and just fixate on
that mistake and say why did i do that

2138
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:08,720
that mistake and say why did i do that
 

2139

that happened everyone else out here is
gonna have a situation like that at some

2146
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:15,120
gonna have a situation like that at some

point
 

2149
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,990
point
mine happened now uh i need to figure

2150
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:18,000
mine happened now uh i need to figure
 

2151
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,669
mine happened now uh i need to figure
out how i can move forward

2152
00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:19,679
out how i can move forward
 

2153
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,310
out how i can move forward
at the fastest sustainable pace and not

2154
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:22,320
at the fastest sustainable pace and not
 

2155
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,070
at the fastest sustainable pace and not
think about what happened back there

2156
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:24,080
think about what happened back there
 

2157
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,190
think about what happened back there
and that's where i think it gets really

2158
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:25,200
and that's where i think it gets really
 

2159
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,350
and that's where i think it gets really
interesting what uh

2160
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:27,360
interesting what uh
 

2161
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,750
interesting what uh
would you say it takes to set a world

2162
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:29,760
would you say it takes to set a world
 

2163

record
 

2165
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,710
record
in the hundred miler well first of all i

2166
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:32,720
in the hundred miler well first of all i
 

2167
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,310
in the hundred miler well first of all i
think you probably have to focus

2168
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:34,320
think you probably have to focus
 

2169
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,509
think you probably have to focus
on that specific event um i mean there's

2170
00:32:37,509 --> 00:32:37,519
on that specific event um i mean there's
 

2171
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,350
on that specific event um i mean there's
the interesting about ultra running

2172
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:39,360
the interesting about ultra running
 

2173
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,269
the interesting about ultra running
where it maybe deviates a bit from just

kind of flat runnable stuff so can you
 

2185
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,230
kind of flat runnable stuff so can you
maybe paint a picture of what are

2186
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:52,240
maybe paint a picture of what are

uh in modern day ultra running is going
to be the western states 100

2220
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:24,240
to be the western states 100
 

2221
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,070
to be the western states 100
that's the biggest most competitive 100

2222
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:26,080
that's the biggest most competitive 100
 

2223
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,630
that's the biggest most competitive 100
miler it's on the trail side of things

miler it's on the trail side of things
 

2225
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,710
miler it's on the trail side of things
in the united states then there's ultra

2226
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:30,720
in the united states then there's ultra
 

2227
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,230
in the united states then there's ultra
trail mount blanc which is probably the

2228
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:32,240
trail mount blanc which is probably the
 

2229
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,070

in previous years it's been debatable as
 

2235
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,070
in previous years it's been debatable as
weather western states are ultra trauma

recent few years you're just seeing a
 

2243
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,830
recent few years you're just seeing a
lot more like of the bulk of

00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:43,840
lot more like of the bulk of
 

2245
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,669
lot more like of the bulk of
international talent on the trail side

2246

of the sport heading over that way
 

2249

of the sport heading over that way
and then you have the road running side

2250
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:49,760
and then you have the road running side
 

2251
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,710
and then you have the road running side
of things where

2252

2254
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:52,720
the comrades marathon which is
 

2255
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,470
the comrades marathon which is
technically 56 miles but they call it

2256
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:54,480
technically 56 miles but they call it
 

2257
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,909
technically 56 miles but they call it
the comrades marathon

2258
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:55,919
the comrades marathon
 

2259
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,070
the comrades marathon
uh is gonna generally be the most

2260
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:58,080
uh is gonna generally be the most
 

2261
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,269
uh is gonna generally be the most
competitive

2262
00:33:59,269 --> 00:33:59,279
competitive
 

2263
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,350
competitive
ultra marathon the the weird thing is

2264
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:01,360
ultra marathon the the weird thing is
 

2265
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,710
ultra marathon the the weird thing is
the distance thing right because most

2266
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:02,720
the distance thing right because most
 

2267
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,029
the distance thing right because most
people

2268
00:34:03,029 --> 00:34:03,039
people
 

2269
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:03,909
people
think of endurance sports they're

2270
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:03,919
think of endurance sports they're
 

2271
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,590
think of endurance sports they're
thinking about precise distances like

2272
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:05,600
thinking about precise distances like
 

2273
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,509
thinking about precise distances like
five kilometers 10 kilometers

2274
00:34:07,509 --> 00:34:07,519
five kilometers 10 kilometers
 

2275
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:08,869
five kilometers 10 kilometers
and all that stuff and then then you get

2276
00:34:08,869 --> 00:34:08,879
and all that stuff and then then you get
 

2277
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,389
and all that stuff and then then you get
into the ultra running world and it's

2278
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:10,399
into the ultra running world and it's
 

2279
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:11,990
into the ultra running world and it's
like sometimes it's the event so like

2280
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:12,000
like sometimes it's the event so like
 

2281
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,589
like sometimes it's the event so like
the western force itself is much more

2282
00:34:13,589 --> 00:34:13,599
the western force itself is much more
 

2283
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:14,629
the western force itself is much more
important than the distance

2284
00:34:14,629 --> 00:34:14,639
important than the distance
 

2285
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,629
important than the distance
right yeah so the western states 100 is

2286
00:34:16,629 --> 00:34:16,639
right yeah so the western states 100 is
 

2287
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,310
right yeah so the western states 100 is
actually 100.2 miles

2288
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:18,320
actually 100.2 miles
 

2289
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,909
actually 100.2 miles
which isn't that big of a deviation when

2290
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:19,919
which isn't that big of a deviation when
 

2291
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:21,109
which isn't that big of a deviation when
you think about it especially when you

2292
00:34:21,109 --> 00:34:21,119
you think about it especially when you
 

2293
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,230
you think about it especially when you
figure like tangents they're going to

2294
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:22,240
figure like tangents they're going to
 

2295
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,750
figure like tangents they're going to
probably account for more than 0.2 miles

2296
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:23,760
probably account for more than 0.2 miles
 

2297
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,270
probably account for more than 0.2 miles
on a 100 mile race

2298
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:25,280
on a 100 mile race
 

2299
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,589
on a 100 mile race
but the ultra trail mount blanc you know

2300
00:34:27,589 --> 00:34:27,599
but the ultra trail mount blanc you know
 

2301
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:28,389
but the ultra trail mount blanc you know
that's

2302
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:28,399
that's
 

2303
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,829
that's
listed as a 100 miler but it's actually

2304
00:34:29,829 --> 00:34:29,839
listed as a 100 miler but it's actually
 

2305
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,750
listed as a 100 miler but it's actually
i think like 100 and 405 miles

2306
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:31,760
i think like 100 and 405 miles
 

2307
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,470
i think like 100 and 405 miles
so you know it's more there's different

2308
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:34,480
so you know it's more there's different
 

2309
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,069
so you know it's more there's different
cultures too so the united states is

2310
00:34:36,069 --> 00:34:36,079
cultures too so the united states is
 

2311
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,589
cultures too so the united states is
definitely more

2312
00:34:37,589 --> 00:34:37,599
definitely more
 

2313
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,510
definitely more
motivated i think to try to get as close

2314
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:39,520
motivated i think to try to get as close
 

2315
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,869
motivated i think to try to get as close
to the exact distance you're gonna hear

2316
00:34:40,869 --> 00:34:40,879
to the exact distance you're gonna hear
 

2317
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,230
to the exact distance you're gonna hear
maybe a little more grumbling if someone

2318
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:42,240
maybe a little more grumbling if someone
 

2319
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,510
maybe a little more grumbling if someone
says i signed up for this hundred miler

2320
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:43,520
says i signed up for this hundred miler
 

2321
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,510
says i signed up for this hundred miler
and it turned out to be 103 miles

2322
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:45,520
and it turned out to be 103 miles
 

2323
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,990
and it turned out to be 103 miles
uh versus like over in europe they don't

2324
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:48,000
uh versus like over in europe they don't
 

2325
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,430
uh versus like over in europe they don't
really care too much about the distance

2326
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:49,440
really care too much about the distance
 

2327
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,470
really care too much about the distance
they're more interested in like a

2328
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:50,480
they're more interested in like a
 

2329
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,909
they're more interested in like a
specific route or a loop

2330
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:51,919
specific route or a loop
 

2331
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:53,990
specific route or a loop
is consistency important in terms of the

2332
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:54,000
is consistency important in terms of the
 

2333
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,430
is consistency important in terms of the
exact length of the

2334
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:55,440
exact length of the
 

2335
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,190
exact length of the
of the route so like you can compare

2336
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:57,200
of the route so like you can compare
 

2337
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,790
of the route so like you can compare
performances from previous years

2338
00:34:58,790 --> 00:34:58,800
performances from previous years
 

2339
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,790
performances from previous years
or are they a little bit more flexible

2340
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:00,800
or are they a little bit more flexible
 

2341
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,630
or are they a little bit more flexible
like they redefine the trail from year

2342
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:02,640
like they redefine the trail from year
 

2343
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,349
like they redefine the trail from year
to year

2344
00:35:03,349 --> 00:35:03,359
to year
 

2345
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:04,950
to year
yeah i mean it's definitely hard to

2346
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:04,960
yeah i mean it's definitely hard to
 

2347
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,270
yeah i mean it's definitely hard to
compare i mean there's events that

2348
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:07,280
compare i mean there's events that
 

2349
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,870
compare i mean there's events that
um take for example i would say the best

2350
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:10,880
um take for example i would say the best
 

2351
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,750
um take for example i would say the best
ultra marathoner in the world today on

2352
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:13,760
ultra marathoner in the world today on
 

2353
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,230
ultra marathoner in the world today on
the men's side is jim walmsley uh the

2354
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:16,240
the men's side is jim walmsley uh the
 

2355
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,829
the men's side is jim walmsley uh the
reason i think jim wells is the best is

2356
00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:17,839
reason i think jim wells is the best is
 

2357
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:18,470
reason i think jim wells is the best is
because he

2358
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:18,480
because he
 

2359
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,510
because he
is the most versatile and not only the

2360
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:21,520
is the most versatile and not only the
 

2361
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,430
is the most versatile and not only the
most versatile but he's

2362
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:23,440
most versatile but he's
 

2363
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,030
most versatile but he's
arguably the best at almost everything

2364
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:25,040
arguably the best at almost everything
 

2365
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,870
arguably the best at almost everything
up to 100 miles so

2366
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:26,880
up to 100 miles so
 

2367
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,790
up to 100 miles so
there's a race called the angelus crest

2368
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:28,800
there's a race called the angelus crest
 

2369
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,310
there's a race called the angelus crest
hunter miler they

2370
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:30,320
hunter miler they
 

2371
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,390
hunter miler they
the the trail has drastically changed

2372
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:32,400
the the trail has drastically changed
 

2373
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,550
the the trail has drastically changed
from when they originally had that event

2374
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:34,560
from when they originally had that event
 

2375
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,910
from when they originally had that event
and it's a different time of year so

2376
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:35,920
and it's a different time of year so
 

2377
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,910
and it's a different time of year so
it's much warmer on that course

2378
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:37,920
it's much warmer on that course
 

2379
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,069
it's much warmer on that course
and jim's not the kind of guy who would

2380
00:35:40,069 --> 00:35:40,079
and jim's not the kind of guy who would
 

2381
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:40,950
and jim's not the kind of guy who would
uh

2382
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:40,960
uh
 

2383
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,190
uh
sit back and say like i can't chase that

2384
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:43,200
sit back and say like i can't chase that
 

2385
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,710
sit back and say like i can't chase that
record but i think angela crest when he

2386
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:44,720
record but i think angela crest when he
 

2387
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,150
record but i think angela crest when he
looks at the segments and the pacing for

2388
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:46,160
looks at the segments and the pacing for
 

2389
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,430
looks at the segments and the pacing for
that one he's like

2390
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:47,440
that one he's like
 

2391
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,270
that one he's like
that one is maybe not even the same

2392
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:49,280
that one is maybe not even the same
 

2393
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,870
that one is maybe not even the same
event anymore so you have that

2394
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:50,880
event anymore so you have that
 

2395
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,069
event anymore so you have that
you have some that are a little more

2396
00:35:52,069 --> 00:35:52,079
you have some that are a little more
 

2397
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:53,670
you have some that are a little more
controlled and a little more kind of

2398
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:53,680
controlled and a little more kind of
 

2399
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,390
controlled and a little more kind of
like

2400
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:54,400
like
 

2401
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,990
like
preserved i guess you would say but i

2402
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:56,000
preserved i guess you would say but i
 

2403
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,670
preserved i guess you would say but i
think it gets really rare on the trail

2404
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:57,680
think it gets really rare on the trail
 

2405
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,150
think it gets really rare on the trail
side

2406
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:58,160
side
 

2407
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,589
side
i mean comrades is going to be very

2408
00:35:59,589 --> 00:35:59,599
i mean comrades is going to be very
 

2409
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:00,950
i mean comrades is going to be very
comparable from one year to the next

2410
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:00,960
comparable from one year to the next
 

2411
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,390
comparable from one year to the next
because that's a road race

2412
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:02,400
because that's a road race
 

2413
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,150
because that's a road race
and that's where you get you maybe get

2414
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:04,160
and that's where you get you maybe get
 

2415
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,750
and that's where you get you maybe get
like the split in the sport from people

2416
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:05,760
like the split in the sport from people
 

2417
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,390
like the split in the sport from people
who really

2418
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:06,400
who really
 

2419
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,310
who really
want that kind of like i want to compare

2420
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:08,320
want that kind of like i want to compare
 

2421
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,829
want that kind of like i want to compare
myself to someone who ran this course in

2422
00:36:10,829 --> 00:36:10,839
myself to someone who ran this course in
 

2423
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:14,310
myself to someone who ran this course in
1970. versus like someone who just says

2424
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:14,320
1970. versus like someone who just says
 

2425
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,510
1970. versus like someone who just says
i want to be competitive today and

2426
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:17,520
i want to be competitive today and
 

2427
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,190
i want to be competitive today and
you know maybe the weather is going to

2428
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:19,200
you know maybe the weather is going to
 

2429
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,790
you know maybe the weather is going to
be 30 degrees different from one year to

2430
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:20,800
be 30 degrees different from one year to
 

2431
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,390
be 30 degrees different from one year to
the next on this course but if i beat

2432
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:22,400
the next on this course but if i beat
 

2433
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,430
the next on this course but if i beat
everyone on this day then i'm the

2434
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:23,440
everyone on this day then i'm the
 

2435
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,109
everyone on this day then i'm the
champion of that big name race like

2436
00:36:25,109 --> 00:36:25,119
champion of that big name race like
 

2437
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,710
champion of that big name race like
ultra trail montblanc or western states

2438
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:26,720
ultra trail montblanc or western states
 

2439
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,510
ultra trail montblanc or western states
100 and

2440
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:27,520
100 and
 

2441
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,510
100 and
my legacy will be cemented because i won

2442
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:29,520
my legacy will be cemented because i won
 

2443
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,190
my legacy will be cemented because i won
that big race and it doesn't matter when

2444
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:31,200
that big race and it doesn't matter when
 

2445
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,710
that big race and it doesn't matter when
or how the course was or what the time

2446
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:32,720
or how the course was or what the time
 

2447
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,829
or how the course was or what the time
even was to some degree

2448
00:36:33,829 --> 00:36:33,839
even was to some degree
 

2449
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,069
even was to some degree
when you were optimizing for trying to

2450
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:36,079
when you were optimizing for trying to
 

2451
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,190
when you were optimizing for trying to
set the world record

2452
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:37,200
set the world record
 

2453
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,990
set the world record
in 100 miler were you doing like

2454
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:40,000
in 100 miler were you doing like
 

2455
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,430
in 100 miler were you doing like
analysis

2456
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:41,440
analysis
 

2457
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,030
analysis
of maybe like what were the variables

2458
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:45,040
of maybe like what were the variables
 

2459
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,310
of maybe like what were the variables
you were looking at

2460
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:46,320
you were looking at
 

2461
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,950
you were looking at
is it more in the realm of the actual

2462
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:48,960
is it more in the realm of the actual
 

2463
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,390
is it more in the realm of the actual
race day

2464
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:50,400
race day
 

2465
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,990
race day
the track what it looks like versus like

2466
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:54,000
the track what it looks like versus like
 

2467
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,150
the track what it looks like versus like
the variables of the training leading up

2468
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:56,160
the variables of the training leading up
 

2469
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,109
the variables of the training leading up
to the

2470
00:36:57,109 --> 00:36:57,119
to the
 

2471
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,670
to the
to the race i mean it evolved a bit like

2472
00:36:59,670 --> 00:36:59,680
to the race i mean it evolved a bit like
 

2473
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,470
to the race i mean it evolved a bit like
i think the

2474
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:00,480
i think the
 

2475
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,150
i think the
as i learned more about just like what

2476
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:02,160
as i learned more about just like what
 

2477
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,589
as i learned more about just like what
is required

2478
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:03,599
is required
 

2479
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:06,069
is required
to kind of really do that stuff so

2480
00:37:06,069 --> 00:37:06,079
to kind of really do that stuff so
 

2481
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,510
to kind of really do that stuff so
there's some variables you can control

2482
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:07,520
there's some variables you can control
 

2483
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,150
there's some variables you can control
for

2484
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:08,160
for
 

2485
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,589
for
you know i try to control for as many as

2486
00:37:09,589 --> 00:37:09,599
you know i try to control for as many as
 

2487
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,589
you know i try to control for as many as
i can the big one that kind of stands

2488
00:37:11,589 --> 00:37:11,599
i can the big one that kind of stands
 

2489
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:12,790
i can the big one that kind of stands
out that you can't necessarily control

2490
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:12,800
out that you can't necessarily control
 

2491
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,190
out that you can't necessarily control
for

2492
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:13,200
for
 

2493
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,190
for
is it's pretty rare where you get an

2494
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:15,200
is it's pretty rare where you get an
 

2495
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,950
is it's pretty rare where you get an
event where they're just doing 100 miles

2496
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:16,960
event where they're just doing 100 miles
 

2497
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,230
event where they're just doing 100 miles
on a track it's usually

2498
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:18,240
on a track it's usually
 

2499
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,589
on a track it's usually
like a like an event of like a series of

2500
00:37:21,589 --> 00:37:21,599
like a like an event of like a series of
 

2501
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:22,790
like a like an event of like a series of
different events where there might be

2502
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:22,800
different events where there might be
 

2503
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,430
different events where there might be
like

2504
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:23,440
like
 

2505
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,190
like
some people out there doing 50k some

2506
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:25,200
some people out there doing 50k some
 

2507
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,030
some people out there doing 50k some
people out there doing 24 or something

2508
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:27,040
people out there doing 24 or something
 

2509
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,310
people out there doing 24 or something
like the event i did that there's six

2510
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:28,320
like the event i did that there's six
 

2511
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,270
like the event i did that there's six
day folks out there they're trying to

2512
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:29,280
day folks out there they're trying to
 

2513
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,630
day folks out there they're trying to
see how far they can get in six days so

2514
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:30,640
see how far they can get in six days so
 

2515
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,230
see how far they can get in six days so
you have like this

2516
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:32,240
you have like this
 

2517
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,870
you have like this
much wider range of pacing just due to

2518
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:34,880
much wider range of pacing just due to
 

2519
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,390
much wider range of pacing just due to
like the distance

2520
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:36,400
like the distance
 

2521
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,950
like the distance
so you know track protocol is always

2522
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:38,960
so you know track protocol is always
 

2523
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,589
so you know track protocol is always
like

2524
00:37:39,589 --> 00:37:39,599
like
 

2525
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,910
like
you pass on the outside so if you're

2526
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:41,920
you pass on the outside so if you're
 

2527
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,630
you pass on the outside so if you're
running

2528
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:42,640
running
 

2529
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,750
running
one of the faster paces of the day um

2530
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:45,760
one of the faster paces of the day um
 

2531
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,510
one of the faster paces of the day um
which when you're going up to six days

2532
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:47,520
which when you're going up to six days
 

2533
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,190
which when you're going up to six days
you're gonna and you're doing 100 miles

2534
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:49,200
you're gonna and you're doing 100 miles
 

2535
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,230
you're gonna and you're doing 100 miles
you're probably going to be running

2536
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:50,240
you're probably going to be running
 

2537
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,910
you're probably going to be running
faster than most people out there

2538
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:51,920
faster than most people out there
 

2539
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,510
faster than most people out there
then you know you just end up running

2540
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:53,520
then you know you just end up running
 

2541
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,109
then you know you just end up running
more because you end up running in lane

2542
00:37:55,109 --> 00:37:55,119
more because you end up running in lane
 

2543
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,550
more because you end up running in lane
two around the turns and sometimes lane

2544
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:56,560
two around the turns and sometimes lane
 

2545
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,430
two around the turns and sometimes lane
three around the turns

2546
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:57,440
three around the turns
 

2547
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,030
three around the turns
so it's down to those little details

2548
00:37:59,030 --> 00:37:59,040
so it's down to those little details
 

2549
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,790
so it's down to those little details
that have a big impact yep so i had to

2550
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:00,800
that have a big impact yep so i had to
 

2551
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,310
that have a big impact yep so i had to
build that into my pacing strategy i

2552
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:02,320
build that into my pacing strategy i
 

2553
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,510
build that into my pacing strategy i
also have to build into the pacing

2554
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:03,520
also have to build into the pacing
 

2555
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,069
also have to build into the pacing
strategy

2556
00:38:04,069 --> 00:38:04,079
strategy
 

2557
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,109
strategy
like relative non-moving time uh

2558
00:38:07,109 --> 00:38:07,119
like relative non-moving time uh
 

2559
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,430
like relative non-moving time uh
you know i did a race just recently i

2560
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:09,440
you know i did a race just recently i
 

2561
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,190
you know i did a race just recently i
was the us track and field hundred mile

2562
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:11,200
was the us track and field hundred mile
 

2563
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,270
was the us track and field hundred mile
road championships and i did not stop

2564
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:13,280
road championships and i did not stop
 

2565
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,630
road championships and i did not stop
once other than like i guess i

2566
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:14,640
once other than like i guess i
 

2567
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,910
once other than like i guess i
technically stopped like

2568
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:15,920
technically stopped like
 

2569
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,430
technically stopped like
in the aid station for like a few

2570
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:17,440
in the aid station for like a few
 

2571
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,589
in the aid station for like a few
seconds to like grab bottles and

2572
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:19,599
seconds to like grab bottles and
 

2573
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:21,109
seconds to like grab bottles and
get myself wet because it was like 94

2574
00:38:21,109 --> 00:38:21,119
get myself wet because it was like 94
 

2575
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:22,710
get myself wet because it was like 94
degrees that day but

2576
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:22,720
degrees that day but
 

2577
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,710
degrees that day but
i didn't like stop at all during that

2578
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:24,720
i didn't like stop at all during that
 

2579
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,230
i didn't like stop at all during that
race from like

2580
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:26,240
race from like
 

2581
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,550
race from like
what i would say is like a long period

2582
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:28,560
what i would say is like a long period
 

2583
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,990
what i would say is like a long period
of time where we're getting up to like a

2584
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:30,000
of time where we're getting up to like a
 

2585
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,630
of time where we're getting up to like a
minute

2586
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:30,640
minute
 

2587
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,790
minute
but that's pretty rare even on the track

2588
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:32,800
but that's pretty rare even on the track
 

2589
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,670
but that's pretty rare even on the track
like when i ran 11 hours and 19 minutes

2590
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:35,680
like when i ran 11 hours and 19 minutes
 

2591
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,270
like when i ran 11 hours and 19 minutes
uh i think i stopped three times for

2592
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:37,280
uh i think i stopped three times for
 

2593
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,190
uh i think i stopped three times for
maybe a total of like i believe

2594
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:39,200
maybe a total of like i believe
 

2595
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,230
maybe a total of like i believe
i have to look back for sure but i think

2596
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:40,240
i have to look back for sure but i think
 

2597
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,190
i have to look back for sure but i think
it was like three to four minutes or

2598
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:41,200
it was like three to four minutes or
 

2599
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,630
it was like three to four minutes or
something like that so you gotta you

2600
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:42,640
something like that so you gotta you
 

2601
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,030
something like that so you gotta you
gotta

2602
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:43,040
gotta
 

2603
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,870
gotta
figure that into your pacing strategy

2604
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:44,880
figure that into your pacing strategy
 

2605
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,550
figure that into your pacing strategy
especially if you're chasing a specific

2606
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:46,560
especially if you're chasing a specific
 

2607
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,270
especially if you're chasing a specific
time

2608
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:47,280
time
 

2609
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,270
time
because you know if i'm pacing for you

2610
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:49,280
because you know if i'm pacing for you
 

2611
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,950
because you know if i'm pacing for you
know at the time the world record was 11

2612
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:50,960
know at the time the world record was 11
 

2613
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,310
know at the time the world record was 11
28 um so if i'm pacing for say

2614
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:54,320
28 um so if i'm pacing for say
 

2615
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,349
28 um so if i'm pacing for say
11 27 30 or something like that and i

2616
00:38:57,349 --> 00:38:57,359
11 27 30 or something like that and i
 

2617
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:58,550
11 27 30 or something like that and i
don't account for that

2618
00:38:58,550 --> 00:38:58,560
don't account for that
 

2619
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,470
don't account for that
three minutes of stoppage then i might

2620
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:00,480
three minutes of stoppage then i might
 

2621
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,069
three minutes of stoppage then i might
run the exact pace i had planned on but

2622
00:39:02,069 --> 00:39:02,079
run the exact pace i had planned on but
 

2623
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:03,270
run the exact pace i had planned on but
then i'm a minute off of the world

2624
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:03,280
then i'm a minute off of the world
 

2625
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:03,829
then i'm a minute off of the world
record

2626
00:39:03,829 --> 00:39:03,839
record
 

2627
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:07,030
record
so 11 28 we're talking about 11 hours

2628
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:07,040
so 11 28 we're talking about 11 hours
 

2629
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,630
so 11 28 we're talking about 11 hours
we're talking about 100 miles

2630
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:08,640
we're talking about 100 miles
 

2631
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,550
we're talking about 100 miles
can you mention what the world record

2632
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:10,560
can you mention what the world record
 

2633
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,230
can you mention what the world record
was what uh

2634
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:12,240
was what uh
 

2635
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,990
was what uh
what kind of world record you set can

2636
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:14,000
what kind of world record you set can
 

2637
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,349
what kind of world record you set can
you tell your own story here

2638
00:39:15,349 --> 00:39:15,359
you tell your own story here
 

2639
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,190
you tell your own story here
of uh of what you were able to

2640
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:17,200
of uh of what you were able to
 

2641
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,950
of uh of what you were able to
accomplish that world record that i

2642
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:18,960
accomplish that world record that i
 

2643
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,870
accomplish that world record that i
broke actually just recently got rebroke

2644
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:20,880
broke actually just recently got rebroke
 

2645

uh alex sorkin um phenomenal race

2648
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:27,760
uh alex sorkin um phenomenal race
 

2649
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,430
uh alex sorkin um phenomenal race
i mean he's he's won the 24-hour world

2650
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:29,440
i mean he's he's won the 24-hour world
 

2651
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,950
i mean he's he's won the 24-hour world
championships he's won the spartathlon

2652
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:30,960
championships he's won the spartathlon
 

2653
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,310
championships he's won the spartathlon
which is another big historic

2654
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:32,320
which is another big historic
 

2655
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,310
which is another big historic
ultramarathon it's 153 miles so it's

2656
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:34,320
ultramarathon it's 153 miles so it's
 

2657
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,829
ultramarathon it's 153 miles so it's
getting a little more lengthy than

2658
00:39:35,829 --> 00:39:35,839
getting a little more lengthy than
 

2659
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:36,630
getting a little more lengthy than
some of the stuff that i've

2660
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:36,640
some of the stuff that i've
 

2661
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,150
some of the stuff that i've
traditionally done um he ran 11 14

2662
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:40,160
traditionally done um he ran 11 14
 

2663
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,030
traditionally done um he ran 11 14
i believe it was 56 or 57. um so his

2664
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:43,040
i believe it was 56 or 57. um so his
 

2665
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,829
i believe it was 56 or 57. um so his
pace was 645 per mile mine was 647 and a

2666
00:39:45,829 --> 00:39:45,839
pace was 645 per mile mine was 647 and a
 

2667
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:46,710
pace was 645 per mile mine was 647 and a
half

2668
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:46,720
half
 

2669
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,990
half
in terms of just like the pacing

2670
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:48,000
in terms of just like the pacing
 

2671
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,390
in terms of just like the pacing
strategy it's it's just really cool

2672
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:50,400
strategy it's it's just really cool
 

2673
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:50,950
strategy it's it's just really cool
because

2674
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:50,960
because
 

2675
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,230
because
for me the motivation

2676
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:54,240
for me the motivation
 

2677
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,270
for me the motivation
with chasing the world record was it was

2678
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:57,280
with chasing the world record was it was
 

2679
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,190
with chasing the world record was it was
multi-faceted i think there was

2680
00:39:59,190 --> 00:39:59,200
multi-faceted i think there was
 

2681
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,390
multi-faceted i think there was
as i kind of moved through because i

2682
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:00,400
as i kind of moved through because i
 

2683
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,390
as i kind of moved through because i
mean it took me almost six years from

2684
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:02,400
mean it took me almost six years from
 

2685
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,150
mean it took me almost six years from
the day i decided i wanted to chase that

2686
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:04,160
the day i decided i wanted to chase that
 

2687
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,109
the day i decided i wanted to chase that
time

2688
00:40:05,109 --> 00:40:05,119
time
 

2689
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:07,990
time
to the day i actually did it uh and

2690
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:08,000
to the day i actually did it uh and
 

2691
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,190
to the day i actually did it uh and
through that

2692
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:09,200
through that
 

2693
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,990
through that
five to six years i think i emerged from

2694
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:12,000
five to six years i think i emerged from
 

2695
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,190
five to six years i think i emerged from
just like my

2696
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:13,200
just like my
 

2697
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,950
just like my
number one goal was to try to break the

2698
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:14,960
number one goal was to try to break the
 

2699
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,589
number one goal was to try to break the
world record to my number one goal is

2700
00:40:17,589 --> 00:40:17,599
world record to my number one goal is
 

2701
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:19,750
world record to my number one goal is
how fast can i run this thing and then

2702
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:19,760
how fast can i run this thing and then
 

2703
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,030
how fast can i run this thing and then
ultimately

2704
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:21,040
ultimately
 

2705
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,790
ultimately
um what needs to be done for a human to

2706
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:22,800
um what needs to be done for a human to
 

2707
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,550
um what needs to be done for a human to
break 11 hours and 100 miles because i

2708
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:24,560
break 11 hours and 100 miles because i
 

2709
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,349
break 11 hours and 100 miles because i
think that's gonna be

2710
00:40:25,349 --> 00:40:25,359
think that's gonna be
 

2711
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:27,750
think that's gonna be
i think that's going to happen wow soon

2712
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:27,760
i think that's going to happen wow soon
 

2713
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,950
i think that's going to happen wow soon
i think it's going to happen

2714
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:28,960
i think it's going to happen
 

2715
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,510
i think it's going to happen
in the next few years would that be um

2716
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:31,520
in the next few years would that be um
 

2717
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,349
in the next few years would that be um
sub 11 would be i think like i

2718
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:33,359
sub 11 would be i think like i
 

2719
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,430
sub 11 would be i think like i
think it's like 6 35 right about per

2720
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:35,440
think it's like 6 35 right about per
 

2721
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,950
think it's like 6 35 right about per
mile you're moving

2722
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:36,960
mile you're moving
 

2723
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,710
mile you're moving
quick but not so quick that like you're

2724
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:40,720
quick but not so quick that like you're
 

2725
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,470
quick but not so quick that like you're
you're you know void of being able to

2726
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:42,480
you're you know void of being able to
 

2727
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,990
you're you know void of being able to
think about everything as it's happening

2728
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:44,000
think about everything as it's happening
 

2729
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,910
think about everything as it's happening
so what's the pace in terms of if you

2730
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:45,920
so what's the pace in terms of if you
 

2731
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,030
so what's the pace in terms of if you
look

2732
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:47,040
look
 

2733
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,150
look
for each of the one-mile segments

2734
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:50,160
for each of the one-mile segments
 

2735
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,270
for each of the one-mile segments
for the 100 miles is it pretty steady

2736
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:53,280
for the 100 miles is it pretty steady
 

2737
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,230
for the 100 miles is it pretty steady
six like in order to break 11 hours

2738
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:56,240
six like in order to break 11 hours
 

2739
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,950
six like in order to break 11 hours
would it be pretty steady 635 does it go

2740
00:40:58,950 --> 00:40:58,960
would it be pretty steady 635 does it go
 

2741
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,270
would it be pretty steady 635 does it go
up

2742
00:40:59,270 --> 00:40:59,280
up
 

2743
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,390
up
and down do you speed up at the very end

2744
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:02,400
and down do you speed up at the very end
 

2745
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,230
and down do you speed up at the very end
like what's what's the pacing if you

2746
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:04,240
like what's what's the pacing if you
 

2747
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,069
like what's what's the pacing if you
were to and maybe how much variability

2748
00:41:06,069 --> 00:41:06,079
were to and maybe how much variability
 

2749
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:07,510
were to and maybe how much variability
is there in the pacing

2750
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:07,520
is there in the pacing
 

2751
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,750
is there in the pacing
for an optimal performance here yeah so

2752
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:09,760
for an optimal performance here yeah so
 

2753
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,030
for an optimal performance here yeah so
if you're talking about someone let's

2754
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:11,040
if you're talking about someone let's
 

2755
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,550
if you're talking about someone let's
say that there's someone well let's just

2756
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:12,560
say that there's someone well let's just
 

2757
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,829
say that there's someone well let's just
take me for example let's say that we

2758
00:41:13,829 --> 00:41:13,839
take me for example let's say that we
 

2759
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,030
take me for example let's say that we
could just like

2760
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:15,040
could just like
 

2761
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,270
could just like
we had this infinite knowledge and we

2762
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:17,280
we had this infinite knowledge and we
 

2763
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,630
we had this infinite knowledge and we
knew for a fact

2764
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:18,640
knew for a fact
 

2765
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,069
knew for a fact
a perfect performance for me would

2766
00:41:20,069 --> 00:41:20,079
a perfect performance for me would
 

2767
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:22,069
a perfect performance for me would
produce a 10 59 but i'm not going a

2768
00:41:22,069 --> 00:41:22,079
produce a 10 59 but i'm not going a
 

2769
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,270
produce a 10 59 but i'm not going a
second faster

2770
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:23,280
second faster
 

2771
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,630
second faster
and i need to do everything right in

2772
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:24,640
and i need to do everything right in
 

2773
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,430
and i need to do everything right in
order to run a 1059. uh

2774
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:27,440
order to run a 1059. uh
 

2775
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,630
order to run a 1059. uh
i would definitely want to either have a

2776
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:30,640
i would definitely want to either have a
 

2777
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,109
i would definitely want to either have a
slight negative or a slight positive

2778
00:41:33,109 --> 00:41:33,119
slight negative or a slight positive
 

2779
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:33,670
slight negative or a slight positive
split

2780
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:33,680
split
 

2781
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,710
split
so when um and i think there's i think

2782
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:36,720
so when um and i think there's i think
 

2783
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,589
so when um and i think there's i think
there's uh

2784
00:41:37,589 --> 00:41:37,599
there's uh
 

2785
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,430
there's uh
there's a range in there where like

2786
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:39,440
there's a range in there where like
 

2787
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,670
there's a range in there where like
being a little bit faster the first half

2788
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:41,680
being a little bit faster the first half
 

2789
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,870
being a little bit faster the first half
the second half isn't going to

2790
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:42,880
the second half isn't going to
 

2791
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,230
the second half isn't going to
necessarily

2792
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:44,240
necessarily
 

2793
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,710
necessarily
change your outcome or being a little

2794
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:46,720
change your outcome or being a little
 

2795
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,550
change your outcome or being a little
bit slower the first half

2796
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:48,560
bit slower the first half
 

2797
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,150
bit slower the first half
and a little bit faster the second half

2798
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:50,160
and a little bit faster the second half
 

2799
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,670
and a little bit faster the second half
isn't going to drastically change your

2800
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:51,680
isn't going to drastically change your
 

2801
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,630
isn't going to drastically change your
outcome

2802
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:52,640
outcome
 

2803
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,829
outcome
so that's what you're referring to the

2804
00:41:53,829 --> 00:41:53,839
so that's what you're referring to the
 

2805
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:55,589
so that's what you're referring to the
split is you're looking at the first 50

2806
00:41:55,589 --> 00:41:55,599
split is you're looking at the first 50
 

2807
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:57,030
split is you're looking at the first 50
miles in the second 15 miles

2808
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:57,040
miles in the second 15 miles
 

2809
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,870
miles in the second 15 miles
and you can break it down as as tiny as

2810
00:41:58,870 --> 00:41:58,880
and you can break it down as as tiny as
 

2811
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,150
and you can break it down as as tiny as
you want like i think

2812
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:00,160
you want like i think
 

2813
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,829
you want like i think
when you take out the outlier laps where

2814
00:42:01,829 --> 00:42:01,839
when you take out the outlier laps where
 

2815
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:03,109
when you take out the outlier laps where
i stopped to use the bathroom which

2816
00:42:03,109 --> 00:42:03,119
i stopped to use the bathroom which
 

2817
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,710
i stopped to use the bathroom which
would have been that like three to four

2818
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:04,720
would have been that like three to four
 

2819
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,069
would have been that like three to four
minute non-moving time that i talked

2820
00:42:06,069 --> 00:42:06,079
minute non-moving time that i talked
 

2821
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:07,030
minute non-moving time that i talked
about before

2822
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:07,040
about before
 

2823
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,349
about before
my splits were really tight um i had a

2824
00:42:09,349 --> 00:42:09,359
my splits were really tight um i had a
 

2825
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:10,630
my splits were really tight um i had a
couple that were

2826
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:10,640
couple that were
 

2827
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,030
couple that were
um it was weird because that that track

2828
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:13,040
um it was weird because that that track
 

2829
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,309
um it was weird because that that track
that i did that on was actually

2830
00:42:14,309 --> 00:42:14,319
that i did that on was actually
 

2831
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:17,829
that i did that on was actually
400 and some weird number like 400 and

2832
00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:17,839
400 and some weird number like 400 and
 

2833
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:19,750
400 and some weird number like 400 and
like 38 meters or something like that so

2834
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:19,760
like 38 meters or something like that so
 

2835
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,510
like 38 meters or something like that so
i actually like ran like my numbers

2836
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:21,520
i actually like ran like my numbers
 

2837
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,190
i actually like ran like my numbers
based on that so they're

2838
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:23,200
based on that so they're
 

2839
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,710
based on that so they're
they're normally i'm dealing with 400

2840
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:24,720
they're normally i'm dealing with 400
 

2841
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,150
they're normally i'm dealing with 400
meters and then it's a little more like

2842
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:26,160
meters and then it's a little more like
 

2843
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,390
meters and then it's a little more like
clean as to like what my lap splits

2844
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:28,400
clean as to like what my lap splits
 

2845
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,750
clean as to like what my lap splits
are gonna range from one event to the

2846
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:29,760
are gonna range from one event to the
 

2847
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,270
are gonna range from one event to the
next so we're talking about running 100

2848
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:31,280
next so we're talking about running 100
 

2849
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,630
next so we're talking about running 100
miles on a track

2850
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:32,640
miles on a track
 

2851
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,589
miles on a track
yeah and so that you can be really

2852
00:42:35,589 --> 00:42:35,599
yeah and so that you can be really
 

2853
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:36,550
yeah and so that you can be really
scientific about

2854
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:36,560
scientific about
 

2855
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,589
scientific about
yes getting the the the the um

2856
00:42:39,589 --> 00:42:39,599
yes getting the the the the um
 

2857
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,829
yes getting the the the the um
the pacing right and uh you're you're

2858
00:42:41,829 --> 00:42:41,839
the pacing right and uh you're you're
 

2859
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:43,430
the pacing right and uh you're you're
running on the inside lane

2860
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:43,440
running on the inside lane
 

2861
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,670
running on the inside lane
or is there some kind of tricks to this

2862
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:45,680
or is there some kind of tricks to this
 

2863
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,630
or is there some kind of tricks to this
like are you

2864
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:46,640
like are you
 

2865
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,990
like are you
alternating directions

2866
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:50,000
alternating directions
 

2867
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,430
alternating directions
yeah they'll switch directions at most

2868
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:51,440
yeah they'll switch directions at most
 

2869
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,270
yeah they'll switch directions at most
events every four hours so

2870
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:53,280
events every four hours so
 

2871
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,190
events every four hours so
you'll do four hours one way and then

2872
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:55,200
you'll do four hours one way and then
 

2873
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,870
you'll do four hours one way and then
they usually put a cone out

2874
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:56,880
they usually put a cone out
 

2875
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,270
they usually put a cone out
and once it hits like like let's say it

2876
00:42:59,270 --> 00:42:59,280
and once it hits like like let's say it
 

2877
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,790
and once it hits like like let's say it
hits four hours

2878
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:00,800
hits four hours
 

2879
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,470
hits four hours
you finish the lap you're on and then

2880
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:02,480
you finish the lap you're on and then
 

2881
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,750
you finish the lap you're on and then
you do a loop around and then you start

2882
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:03,760
you do a loop around and then you start
 

2883
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,309
you do a loop around and then you start
the next

2884
00:43:04,309 --> 00:43:04,319
the next
 

2885
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,829
the next
your next laptop would you say you take

2886
00:43:05,829 --> 00:43:05,839
your next laptop would you say you take
 

2887
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:08,309
your next laptop would you say you take
the exact same number of steps

2888
00:43:08,309 --> 00:43:08,319
the exact same number of steps
 

2889
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,230
the exact same number of steps
like when you're really in the groove

2890
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:10,240
like when you're really in the groove
 

2891
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,670
like when you're really in the groove
when you're taking the pacing

2892
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:11,680
when you're taking the pacing
 

2893
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,270
when you're taking the pacing
are we talking about that level of

2894
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:13,280
are we talking about that level of
 

2895
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,270
are we talking about that level of
precision or is it a little bit more

2896
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:15,280
precision or is it a little bit more
 

2897
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,910
precision or is it a little bit more
feel you mean like foot strike frequency

2898
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:17,920
feel you mean like foot strike frequency
 

2899
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:18,470
feel you mean like foot strike frequency
yeah like

2900
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:18,480
yeah like
 

2901
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,589
yeah like
frequency then over the distance to the

2902
00:43:21,589 --> 00:43:21,599
frequency then over the distance to the
 

2903
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,510
frequency then over the distance to the
lap would you say it's so precise that

2904
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:23,520
lap would you say it's so precise that
 

2905
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,270
lap would you say it's so precise that
you're like you get in this groove where

2906
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:25,280
you're like you get in this groove where
 

2907
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:25,990
you're like you get in this groove where
it's like perfect

2908
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:26,000
it's like perfect
 

2909
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,910
it's like perfect
yeah gosh you're making me wish i would

2910
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:27,920
yeah gosh you're making me wish i would
 

2911
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,270
yeah gosh you're making me wish i would
have strapped more like a foot pod to

2912
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:29,280
have strapped more like a foot pod to
 

2913
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,109
have strapped more like a foot pod to
mine

2914
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:31,119
mine
 

2915
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:33,030
mine
but like yeah so i think like my guess

2916
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:33,040
but like yeah so i think like my guess
 

2917
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,710
but like yeah so i think like my guess
is it's pretty precise like it's

2918
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:34,720
is it's pretty precise like it's
 

2919
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,990
is it's pretty precise like it's
is there a video of this sorry i keep

2920
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:36,000
is there a video of this sorry i keep
 

2921
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,190
is there a video of this sorry i keep
interrupting is there a video of this

2922
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:37,200
interrupting is there a video of this
 

2923
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:37,750
interrupting is there a video of this
because

2924
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:37,760
because
 

2925
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,109
because
i i've actually this is now three years

2926
00:43:41,109 --> 00:43:41,119
i i've actually this is now three years
 

2927
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,030
i i've actually this is now three years
ago build a computer vision

2928
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:43,040
ago build a computer vision
 

2929
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,510
ago build a computer vision
algorithm that counts foot strikes oh

2930
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:45,520
algorithm that counts foot strikes oh
 

2931
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,109
algorithm that counts foot strikes oh
really yeah for fun

2932
00:43:47,109 --> 00:43:47,119
really yeah for fun
 

2933
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:50,390
really yeah for fun
yeah i was trying to understand uh we'll

2934
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:50,400
yeah i was trying to understand uh we'll
 

2935
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,589
yeah i was trying to understand uh we'll
talk about that we have the same

2936
00:43:51,589 --> 00:43:51,599
talk about that we have the same
 

2937
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:53,030
talk about that we have the same
definition of fun when

2938
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:53,040
definition of fun when
 

2939
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,349
definition of fun when
i've got my find myself on a track for

2940
00:43:55,349 --> 00:43:55,359
i've got my find myself on a track for
 

2941
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:57,030
i've got my find myself on a track for
all day and you find yourself counting

2942
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:57,040
all day and you find yourself counting
 

2943
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,470
all day and you find yourself counting
foot strikes

2944
00:43:58,470 --> 00:43:58,480
foot strikes
 

2945
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,470
foot strikes
i was trying to understand if if there's

2946
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:00,480
i was trying to understand if if there's
 

2947
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,990
i was trying to understand if if there's
how much variability there's

2948
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:02,000
how much variability there's
 

2949
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,990
how much variability there's
in uh extreme like elite performers

2950
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:06,000
in uh extreme like elite performers
 

2951
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,710
in uh extreme like elite performers
within a particular race but also across

2952
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:08,720
within a particular race but also across
 

2953
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,710
within a particular race but also across
races it was just interesting to me

2954
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:10,720
races it was just interesting to me
 

2955
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,829
races it was just interesting to me
from a robotics perspective if like

2956
00:44:13,829 --> 00:44:13,839
from a robotics perspective if like
 

2957
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:15,510
from a robotics perspective if like
how much variability there is in the

2958
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:15,520
how much variability there is in the
 

2959
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,309
how much variability there is in the
human body in in the way they use legs

2960
00:44:18,309 --> 00:44:18,319
human body in in the way they use legs
 

2961
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:19,349
human body in in the way they use legs
to move quickly

2962
00:44:19,349 --> 00:44:19,359
to move quickly
 

2963
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:22,309
to move quickly
i think my guess would be that at the

2964
00:44:22,309 --> 00:44:22,319
i think my guess would be that at the
 

2965
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:23,750
i think my guess would be that at the
individual level it's going to be pretty

2966
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:23,760
individual level it's going to be pretty
 

2967
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,829
individual level it's going to be pretty
precise assuming the pacing

2968
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:25,839
precise assuming the pacing
 

2969
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:29,030
precise assuming the pacing
is consistent so you get so my pacing on

2970
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:29,040
is consistent so you get so my pacing on
 

2971
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,150
is consistent so you get so my pacing on
that day

2972
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:30,160
that day
 

2973
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,390
that day
i ran two minutes faster the second 50

2974
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:32,400
i ran two minutes faster the second 50
 

2975
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,910
i ran two minutes faster the second 50
miles and i did the first 50 miles so my

2976
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:33,920
miles and i did the first 50 miles so my
 

2977
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,990
miles and i did the first 50 miles so my
splits were very even most of the day

2978
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:36,000
splits were very even most of the day
 

2979
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,510
splits were very even most of the day
i actually ran some of my fastest miles

2980
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:37,520
i actually ran some of my fastest miles
 

2981
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,589
i actually ran some of my fastest miles
at the end uh so there's going to be

2982
00:44:39,589 --> 00:44:39,599
at the end uh so there's going to be
 

2983
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:40,630
at the end uh so there's going to be
probably a slight

2984
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:40,640
probably a slight
 

2985
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,870
probably a slight
variance from my fastest mile to my

2986
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:42,880
variance from my fastest mile to my
 

2987
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,150
variance from my fastest mile to my
slowest mile in

2988
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:44,160
slowest mile in
 

2989
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,630
slowest mile in
like your cadence or your foot strike

2990
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:46,640
like your cadence or your foot strike
 

2991
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,390
like your cadence or your foot strike
but probably not by a huge margin but

2992
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:48,400
but probably not by a huge margin but
 

2993
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,829
but probably not by a huge margin but
you might have a pretty big variance

2994
00:44:49,829 --> 00:44:49,839
you might have a pretty big variance
 

2995
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:51,190
you might have a pretty big variance
from one person to the next

2996
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:51,200
from one person to the next
 

2997
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,670
from one person to the next
so you get someone whose gait is just a

2998
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:53,680
so you get someone whose gait is just a
 

2999
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,190
so you get someone whose gait is just a
little bit different so like for me

3000
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:55,200
little bit different so like for me
 

3001
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,430
little bit different so like for me
i supinate which means i kind of come

3002
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:57,440
i supinate which means i kind of come
 

3003
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,430
i supinate which means i kind of come
down on the outside of my foot

3004
00:44:59,430 --> 00:44:59,440
down on the outside of my foot
 

3005
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,870
down on the outside of my foot
and i'm kind of more of a mid-forefoot

3006
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:00,880
and i'm kind of more of a mid-forefoot
 

3007
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,630
and i'm kind of more of a mid-forefoot
striker so that's going to kind of

3008
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:02,640
striker so that's going to kind of
 

3009
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,710
striker so that's going to kind of
impact my cadence to a degree whereas

3010
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:04,720
impact my cadence to a degree whereas
 

3011
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,470
impact my cadence to a degree whereas
you might have someone who

3012
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:06,480
you might have someone who
 

3013
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,270
you might have someone who
is kind of more mid to rear of their

3014
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:09,280
is kind of more mid to rear of their
 

3015
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,870
is kind of more mid to rear of their
foot or heel striker and they might

3016
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:10,880
foot or heel striker and they might
 

3017
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,309
foot or heel striker and they might
pronate where their foot kind of rolls

3018
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:12,319
pronate where their foot kind of rolls
 

3019
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,270
pronate where their foot kind of rolls
in

3020
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:13,280
in
 

3021
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,630
in
so that person may have a little bit of

3022
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:14,640
so that person may have a little bit of
 

3023
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,710
so that person may have a little bit of
a different cadence as well so

3024
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:16,720
a different cadence as well so
 

3025
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,470
a different cadence as well so
you get someone and i think you see this

3026
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:18,480
you get someone and i think you see this
 

3027
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,630
you get someone and i think you see this
in elite marathoning too which is gonna

3028
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:20,640
in elite marathoning too which is gonna
 

3029
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,030
in elite marathoning too which is gonna
probably

3030
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:21,040
probably
 

3031
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,069
probably
just be a much larger data pool uh much

3032
00:45:24,069 --> 00:45:24,079
just be a much larger data pool uh much
 

3033
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:25,990
just be a much larger data pool uh much
much more probably precise from just

3034
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:26,000
much more probably precise from just
 

3035
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,630
much more probably precise from just
like a number of opportunities to study

3036
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:28,640
like a number of opportunities to study
 

3037
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:29,270
like a number of opportunities to study
this

3038
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:29,280
this
 

3039
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,790
this
and i think even their ranges from one

3040
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:30,800
and i think even their ranges from one
 

3041
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,470
and i think even their ranges from one
person the next can be

3042
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:32,480
person the next can be
 

3043
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,630
person the next can be
i wouldn't say drastic but you know to

3044
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:34,640
i wouldn't say drastic but you know to
 

3045
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,990
i wouldn't say drastic but you know to
the degree of like

3046
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:36,000
the degree of like
 

3047
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,150
the degree of like
10 to maybe even 20 steps per minute or

3048
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:38,160
10 to maybe even 20 steps per minute or
 

3049
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,589
10 to maybe even 20 steps per minute or
something like that from one person to

3050
00:45:39,589 --> 00:45:39,599
something like that from one person to
 

3051
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:40,630
something like that from one person to
the next

3052
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:40,640
the next
 

3053
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,470
the next
but most people the faster they go the

3054
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:42,480
but most people the faster they go the
 

3055
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,670
but most people the faster they go the
higher their cadence is going to be the

3056
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:43,680
higher their cadence is going to be the
 

3057
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,870
higher their cadence is going to be the
slower they go the lower their cadence

3058
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:44,880
slower they go the lower their cadence
 

3059
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:45,589
slower they go the lower their cadence
is going to be

3060
00:45:45,589 --> 00:45:45,599
is going to be
 

3061
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,349
is going to be
but there's going to be probably a range

3062
00:45:47,349 --> 00:45:47,359
but there's going to be probably a range
 

3063
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:48,870
but there's going to be probably a range
of optimal

3064
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:48,880
of optimal
 

3065
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,670
of optimal
lowness and i don't know what probably

3066
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:51,680
lowness and i don't know what probably
 

3067
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,309
lowness and i don't know what probably
optimal

3068
00:45:52,309 --> 00:45:52,319
optimal
 

3069
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:54,470
optimal
highness too than that if you can just

3070
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:54,480
highness too than that if you can just
 

3071
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,630
highness too than that if you can just
linger in 11 hours

3072
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:56,640
linger in 11 hours
 

3073
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,790
linger in 11 hours
the person first of all would you like

3074
00:45:58,790 --> 00:45:58,800
the person first of all would you like
 

3075
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,950
the person first of all would you like
to be a the person that breaks 11 hours

3076
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:00,960
to be a the person that breaks 11 hours
 

3077
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,670
to be a the person that breaks 11 hours
and second of all the person that does

3078
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:03,680
and second of all the person that does
 

3079
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,430
and second of all the person that does
break 11 hours like what would

3080
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:05,440
break 11 hours like what would
 

3081
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,550
break 11 hours like what would
what would it take and third question is

3082
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:08,560
what would it take and third question is
 

3083
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,750
what would it take and third question is
is it even possible

3084
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:09,760
is it even possible
 

3085
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,030
is it even possible
and you're in yeah i mean i would def

3086
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:13,040
and you're in yeah i mean i would def
 

3087
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,230
and you're in yeah i mean i would def
i would be lying to you if i said i

3088
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:14,240
i would be lying to you if i said i
 

3089
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,190
i would be lying to you if i said i
didn't want to be the first person to

3090
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:15,200
didn't want to be the first person to
 

3091
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,870
didn't want to be the first person to
break 11 hours and 100 miles i think

3092
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:16,880
break 11 hours and 100 miles i think
 

3093
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:17,829
break 11 hours and 100 miles i think
that'll be

3094
00:46:17,829 --> 00:46:17,839
that'll be
 

3095
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:20,870
that'll be
um would be a cool like barrier to be

3096
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:20,880
um would be a cool like barrier to be
 

3097
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,390
um would be a cool like barrier to be
the one to usher that in

3098
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:22,400
the one to usher that in
 

3099
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,069
the one to usher that in
but with that said i think i'm much more

3100
00:46:24,069 --> 00:46:24,079
but with that said i think i'm much more
 

3101
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:25,510
but with that said i think i'm much more
motivated in

3102
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:25,520
motivated in
 

3103
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:29,430
motivated in
seeing it done from the sense that like

3104
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:29,440
seeing it done from the sense that like
 

3105
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,190
seeing it done from the sense that like
i think when when we're talking about

3106
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:31,200
i think when when we're talking about
 

3107
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,670
i think when when we're talking about
records it's something that

3108
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:33,680
records it's something that
 

3109
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,829
records it's something that
is inevitable that it's gonna get broken

3110
00:46:35,829 --> 00:46:35,839
is inevitable that it's gonna get broken
 

3111
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:36,950
is inevitable that it's gonna get broken
so i mean we were talking about

3112
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:36,960
so i mean we were talking about
 

3113
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,109
so i mean we were talking about
happiness before this right so

3114
00:46:39,109 --> 00:46:39,119
happiness before this right so
 

3115
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:42,150
happiness before this right so
i've contemplated this in the past where

3116
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:42,160
i've contemplated this in the past where
 

3117
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,550
i've contemplated this in the past where
i was thinking to myself like

3118
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:44,560
i was thinking to myself like
 

3119
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,630
i was thinking to myself like
if my motivation is to break a world

3120
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:46,640
if my motivation is to break a world
 

3121
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,230
if my motivation is to break a world
record or any record for that matter

3122
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:48,240
record or any record for that matter
 

3123
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,589
record or any record for that matter
course record

3124
00:46:49,589 --> 00:46:49,599
course record
 

3125
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,870
course record
and have that be my defining reason

3126
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:52,880
and have that be my defining reason
 

3127
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,589
and have that be my defining reason
or my defining motivator i probably need

3128
00:46:55,589 --> 00:46:55,599
or my defining motivator i probably need
 

3129
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:56,710
or my defining motivator i probably need
to do

3130
00:46:56,710 --> 00:46:56,720
to do
 

3131
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,349
to do
an assessment of what i'm kind of where

3132
00:46:59,349 --> 00:46:59,359
an assessment of what i'm kind of where
 

3133
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:01,030
an assessment of what i'm kind of where
my mind is at and where my

3134
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:01,040
my mind is at and where my
 

3135
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:04,470
my mind is at and where my
focus is at uh and just

3136
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:04,480
focus is at uh and just
 

3137
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,190
focus is at uh and just
reflect on how i'm behaving in life

3138
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:07,200
reflect on how i'm behaving in life
 

3139
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,230
reflect on how i'm behaving in life
because

3140
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:08,240
because
 

3141
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,069
because
it's gonna get broken right i mean i

3142
00:47:10,069 --> 00:47:10,079
it's gonna get broken right i mean i
 

3143
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,349
it's gonna get broken right i mean i
could run

3144
00:47:11,349 --> 00:47:11,359
could run
 

3145
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:14,710
could run
10 50 tomorrow and in

3146
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:14,720
10 50 tomorrow and in
 

3147
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:17,109
10 50 tomorrow and in
10 years chances are that's no longer

3148
00:47:17,109 --> 00:47:17,119
10 years chances are that's no longer
 

3149
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:18,630
10 years chances are that's no longer
gonna be my the world record anymore

3150
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:18,640
gonna be my the world record anymore
 

3151
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,470
gonna be my the world record anymore
someone's gonna run faster than that

3152
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:20,480
someone's gonna run faster than that
 

3153
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:23,910
someone's gonna run faster than that
so if you're living to hold on to a

3154
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:23,920
so if you're living to hold on to a
 

3155
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:24,950
so if you're living to hold on to a
record versus

3156
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:24,960
record versus
 

3157
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,829
record versus
living to try to move the sport forward

3158
00:47:27,829 --> 00:47:27,839
living to try to move the sport forward
 

3159
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:29,589
living to try to move the sport forward
which any time you break a world record

3160
00:47:29,589 --> 00:47:29,599
which any time you break a world record
 

3161
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:31,829
which any time you break a world record
you're moving the sport forward then

3162
00:47:31,829 --> 00:47:31,839
you're moving the sport forward then
 

3163
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,349
you're moving the sport forward then
then you have to look at that as like

3164
00:47:33,349 --> 00:47:33,359
then you have to look at that as like
 

3165
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:34,790
then you have to look at that as like
that was my contribution

3166
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:34,800
that was my contribution
 

3167
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,589
that was my contribution
and whether i contribute again or not is

3168
00:47:37,589 --> 00:47:37,599
and whether i contribute again or not is
 

3169
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:39,190
and whether i contribute again or not is
kind of besides the point

3170
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:39,200
kind of besides the point
 

3171
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,910
kind of besides the point
what you want is that your performance

3172
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:41,920
what you want is that your performance
 

3173
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,430
what you want is that your performance
your contribution brings

3174
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:43,440
your contribution brings
 

3175
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,710
your contribution brings
new people into the sport who are

3176
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:44,720
new people into the sport who are
 

3177
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,549
new people into the sport who are
excited motivated

3178
00:47:46,549 --> 00:47:46,559
excited motivated
 

3179
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:48,390
excited motivated
and they can make their contribution and

3180
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:48,400
and they can make their contribution and
 

3181
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,069
and they can make their contribution and
then we can ultimately see well how fast

3182
00:47:50,069 --> 00:47:50,079
then we can ultimately see well how fast
 

3183
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:51,829
then we can ultimately see well how fast
can someone run a controlled environment

3184
00:47:51,829 --> 00:47:51,839
can someone run a controlled environment
 

3185
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:53,109
can someone run a controlled environment
hundred miler

3186
00:47:53,109 --> 00:47:53,119
hundred miler
 

3187
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:55,270
hundred miler
and that's what i really want to see uh

3188
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:55,280
and that's what i really want to see uh
 

3189
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,790
and that's what i really want to see uh
because i think i've gotten so much

3190
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:56,800
because i think i've gotten so much
 

3191
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,990
because i think i've gotten so much
enjoyment from the sport i mean i've

3192
00:47:57,990 --> 00:47:58,000
enjoyment from the sport i mean i've
 

3193
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,190
enjoyment from the sport i mean i've
gotten so much enjoyment from the sport

3194
00:47:59,190 --> 00:47:59,200

3195
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,030
gotten so much enjoyment from the sport
i've been able to turn it into a career

who can do the same thing
and it's not necessarily going to come

3202
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:06,160
and it's not necessarily going to come

this board up to people who maybe

3212
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:13,680
this board up to people who maybe
 

3213
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:14,870
this board up to people who maybe
otherwise would have never thought about

3214
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:14,880
otherwise would have never thought about
 

3215
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,150
otherwise would have never thought about
it seen it

3216
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:16,160
it seen it
 

3217
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,549
it seen it
considered it and to me i think that's

3218
00:48:18,549 --> 00:48:18,559
considered it and to me i think that's

and i want to hold it for
decades or i want to die with this

3226
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:26,640
decades or i want to die with this
 

3227
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,150
decades or i want to die with this
record so i never have to see someone

3228
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:28,160
record so i never have to see someone
 

3229
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,990
record so i never have to see someone
go faster than me well that's the

3230
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:30,000
go faster than me well that's the
 

3231
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,990
go faster than me well that's the
progress of human civilization we stand

3232
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:32,000
progress of human civilization we stand
 

3233
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,670
progress of human civilization we stand
on the shoulders of giants and we keep

3234
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:33,680
on the shoulders of giants and we keep
 

3235
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,270
on the shoulders of giants and we keep
creating cool stuff well and it's

3236
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:35,280
creating cool stuff well and it's
 

3237
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,950
creating cool stuff well and it's
it's the other thing is just like if

3238
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:36,960
it's the other thing is just like if
 

3239
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,710
it's the other thing is just like if
you're honest with yourself too it's uh

i mean we're seeing this right now in

3242
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:39,760
i mean we're seeing this right now in
 

3243
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,109
i mean we're seeing this right now in
the running world where

3244
00:48:41,109 --> 00:48:41,119
the running world where
 

3245
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:42,790
the running world where
you know new innovations come in new

3246
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:42,800
you know new innovations come in new
 

3247
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,390
you know new innovations come in new
technologies come in new nutritional

3248
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:44,400
technologies come in new nutritional
 

3249
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,270
technologies come in new nutritional
approaches come in

3250
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:45,280
approaches come in
 

3251
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,069
approaches come in
and then we see like the new crop of

3252
00:48:48,069 --> 00:48:48,079
and then we see like the new crop of
 

3253
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:49,510
and then we see like the new crop of
folks have advantages that the old crop

3254
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:49,520
folks have advantages that the old crop
 

3255
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,549
folks have advantages that the old crop
didn't have

3256
00:48:50,549 --> 00:48:50,559
didn't have
 

3257
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:52,230
didn't have
and it can be easy to look back on that

3258
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:52,240
and it can be easy to look back on that
 

3259
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,589
and it can be easy to look back on that
and say like hey well

3260
00:48:53,589 --> 00:48:53,599
and say like hey well
 

3261
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:56,069
and say like hey well

product or if i would have done that i
 

3265
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:57,910
product or if i would have done that i
would have run this but then you're

3266
00:48:57,910 --> 00:48:57,920
would have run this but then you're
 

3267
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,349
would have run this but then you're
getting into that negative

3268
00:48:59,349 --> 00:48:59,359
getting into that negative
 

3269
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:01,750
getting into that negative
you know thought process again which i

3270
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:01,760
you know thought process again which i
 

3271
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,750
you know thought process again which i
generally try to stay out of it

yes and i think that's one of the
 

3389
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:50,390
yes and i think that's one of the
drivers from just a quality of life

3390
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:50,400
drivers from just a quality of life
 

3391
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,589
drivers from just a quality of life
standpoint

3392
00:50:51,589 --> 00:50:51,599
standpoint
 

3393
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:53,910

immediate gratification
uh standpoint but then there's like i

3398
00:50:56,790 --> 00:50:56,800
uh standpoint but then there's like i
 

3399
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,309
uh standpoint but then there's like i
think the bigger picture stuff for the

3400
00:50:58,309 --> 00:50:58,319
think the bigger picture stuff for the
 

3401
00:50:58,319 --> 00:50:59,829
think the bigger picture stuff for the
longer term stuff

3402
00:50:59,829 --> 00:50:59,839
longer term stuff
 

3403
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:03,270
longer term stuff
and for me that enjoyment is like

and for me that enjoyment is like
 

3405
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:06,069
and for me that enjoyment is like
just the process like of uh okay i'm

3406
00:51:06,069 --> 00:51:06,079
just the process like of uh okay i'm
 

3407
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:07,190
just the process like of uh okay i'm
starting at this

3408
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:07,200

fitness level and i'm going to do these
workouts and by doing these workouts i'm

3412
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:12,160
workouts and by doing these workouts i'm
 

3413
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,670
workouts and by doing these workouts i'm
going to see incremental progress from

00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:13,680
going to see incremental progress from
 

3415
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:14,150

3420
00:51:17,349 --> 00:51:17,359
kind of short-term gratification that's
 

3421
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:18,230
kind of short-term gratification that's
maybe a little longer than the

there's something about just finding

3458
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:48,640
there's something about just finding
 

3459
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,230
there's something about just finding
improvement and people love to see

3460

improvement i think so
 

3463
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,390
improvement i think so
that's where uh i think you can also get

3464
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:54,400
that's where uh i think you can also get
 

3465

that's where uh i think you can also get
some value and it would be saying like i

3466
00:51:55,670 --> 00:51:55,680
some value and it would be saying like i

some value and it would be saying like i
started here and i got there

itself where that's going to be kind of

3480
00:52:07,589 --> 00:52:07,599
itself where that's going to be kind of
 

3481
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:09,109
itself where that's going to be kind of
the thing that kind of like

the thing that kind of like
uh shows up on the end result and

a chance like all the training
 

3571
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,670
a chance like all the training
is more like science and then it feels

3572
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:41,680
is more like science and then it feels
 

3573
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,750
is more like science and then it feels
like the competition day's art

3574
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:43,760
like the competition day's art
 

3575
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,829
like the competition day's art
yeah i think that that that's a really

3576
00:53:45,829 --> 00:53:45,839
yeah i think that that that's a really

it's
 

3581
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,829
it's
when you really open up the perspective

3582
00:53:49,829 --> 00:53:49,839
when you really open up the perspective
 

3583
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:51,510
when you really open up the perspective
of that too it's like

3584
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:51,520
of that too it's like
 

3585
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,510
of that too it's like
even uh obviously you know having a

like that
 

3597
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,829
like that
or in the running perspective like

3598
00:54:01,829 --> 00:54:01,839
or in the running perspective like
 

3599
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:03,589
or in the running perspective like
achieving that goal time

uh that sort of stuff obviously those
are kind of like the ones you

3604
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:06,720
are kind of like the ones you
 

3605
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,069
are kind of like the ones you
you if when you're honest yourself you

3606
00:54:08,069 --> 00:54:08,079
you if when you're honest yourself you
 

3607
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:09,990
you if when you're honest yourself you
really want and you're gonna probably

3608
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:10,000
really want and you're gonna probably
 

3609
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,150
really want and you're gonna probably
get the most satisfaction out of but

3610
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:12,160
get the most satisfaction out of but
 

3611
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,670
get the most satisfaction out of but
even when they don't go wrong like maybe

3612
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:13,680
even when they don't go wrong like maybe
 

3613
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,270
even when they don't go wrong like maybe
like with your grappling tournament

3614
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:15,280
like with your grappling tournament
 

3615
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,829
like with your grappling tournament
uh analogy the you know maybe the guy

3616
00:54:17,829 --> 00:54:17,839
uh analogy the you know maybe the guy
 

3617
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:18,309
uh analogy the you know maybe the guy
you're

3618
00:54:18,309 --> 00:54:18,319
you're
 

3619
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:20,309
you're
grappling against does a move on you and

3620
00:54:20,309 --> 00:54:20,319
grappling against does a move on you and
 

3621
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:21,589
grappling against does a move on you and
you're like i was not prepared for that

3622
00:54:21,589 --> 00:54:21,599
you're like i was not prepared for that
 

3623
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:22,069
you're like i was not prepared for that
move

3624
00:54:22,069 --> 00:54:22,079
move
 

3625
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:25,190
move
so now the enjoyment becomes okay

3626
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:25,200
so now the enjoyment becomes okay
 

3627
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,030
so now the enjoyment becomes okay
back to the drawing board and now i need

3628
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:27,040
back to the drawing board and now i need
 

3629
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,470
back to the drawing board and now i need
to find out what do i do when that

3630
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:28,480
to find out what do i do when that
 

3631
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:29,829
to find out what do i do when that
happens to me next time

3632
00:54:29,829 --> 00:54:29,839
happens to me next time
 

3633
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:31,910
happens to me next time
and that's where the i think the y comes

3634
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:31,920
and that's where the i think the y comes
 

3635
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,430
and that's where the i think the y comes
in again same thing with running like

3636
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:33,440
in again same thing with running like
 

3637
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,109
in again same thing with running like
maybe i make a mistake and

3638
00:54:35,109 --> 00:54:35,119
maybe i make a mistake and
 

3639
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:37,990
maybe i make a mistake and
you know like eat something i didn't

3640
00:54:37,990 --> 00:54:38,000
you know like eat something i didn't
 

3641
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,190
you know like eat something i didn't
really want to eat or

3642
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:39,200
really want to eat or
 

3643
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,710
really want to eat or
or thought was gonna work but didn't

3644
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:40,720
or thought was gonna work but didn't
 

3645
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,549
or thought was gonna work but didn't
work and it costs me more time than i

3646
00:54:42,549 --> 00:54:42,559
work and it costs me more time than i
 

3647
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:43,750
work and it costs me more time than i
gained by having it or something like

3648
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:43,760
gained by having it or something like
 

3649
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:44,950
gained by having it or something like
that and then i go back to the drawing

3650
00:54:44,950 --> 00:54:44,960
that and then i go back to the drawing
 

3651
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,630
that and then i go back to the drawing
board and say okay well

3652
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:46,640
board and say okay well
 

3653
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,710
board and say okay well
i can't do that that didn't work or if

3654
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:48,720
i can't do that that didn't work or if
 

3655
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,069
i can't do that that didn't work or if
i'm gonna do that i need to be more

3668
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:02,559
and like the flaws give us meaning
 

3669
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:05,270
and like the flaws give us meaning
because like if if everything if you

3670
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:05,280
because like if if everything if you
 

3671
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,710
because like if if everything if you
weren't able to find

3672
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:06,720
weren't able to find
 

3673
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,190
weren't able to find
mistakes and something you've done it

3674
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:09,200
mistakes and something you've done it
 

3675
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,870
mistakes and something you've done it
feels like

3676
00:55:10,870 --> 00:55:10,880
feels like
 

3677
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,990
feels like
the life would be void of meaning it's a

3678
00:55:13,990 --> 00:55:14,000
the life would be void of meaning it's a
 

3679
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,430
the life would be void of meaning it's a
lost opportunity too

3680
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:15,440
lost opportunity too
 

3681
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,710
lost opportunity too
like if i mean like when i look at

3682
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:18,720
like if i mean like when i look at
 

3683
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:23,030
like if i mean like when i look at
even my hundred mile race of 1119

3684
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:23,040
even my hundred mile race of 1119
 

3685
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,549
even my hundred mile race of 1119
i can find spots in there where i was

3686
00:55:24,549 --> 00:55:24,559
i can find spots in there where i was
 

3687
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:26,230
i can find spots in there where i was
like uh you know what i could clean that

3688
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:26,240
like uh you know what i could clean that
 

3689
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,670
like uh you know what i could clean that
up a little bit maybe if i do this

3690
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:27,680
up a little bit maybe if i do this
 

3691
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:28,870
up a little bit maybe if i do this
differently

3692
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:28,880
differently
 

3693
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,750
differently
and i mean that's gonna get me you know

3694
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:31,760
and i mean that's gonna get me you know
 

3695
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:32,950
and i mean that's gonna get me you know
a little bit faster

3696
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:32,960
a little bit faster
 

3697
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,870
a little bit faster
if i sat back and said hey well things

3698
00:55:34,870 --> 00:55:34,880
if i sat back and said hey well things
 

3699
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,230
if i sat back and said hey well things
went great that day

3700
00:55:36,230 --> 00:55:36,240
went great that day
 

3701
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,510
went great that day
cool let's see if we can replicate it

3702
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:37,520
cool let's see if we can replicate it
 

3703
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:41,030
cool let's see if we can replicate it
then you know i probably run 11 19 again

3704
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:41,040
then you know i probably run 11 19 again
 

3705
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,630
then you know i probably run 11 19 again
so can we talk about training a little

3706
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:42,640
so can we talk about training a little
 

3707
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,870
so can we talk about training a little
bit yeah what does your uh

3708
00:55:44,870 --> 00:55:44,880
bit yeah what does your uh
 

3709
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,990
bit yeah what does your uh
training look like year-round

3710
00:55:47,990 --> 00:55:48,000
training look like year-round
 

3711
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,910
training look like year-round
day-to-day hour to hour like optimal

3712
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:51,920
day-to-day hour to hour like optimal
 

3713
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,390
day-to-day hour to hour like optimal
maybe uh maybe you want to pick a race

3714
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:54,400
maybe uh maybe you want to pick a race
 

3715
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:55,510
maybe uh maybe you want to pick a race
in the context of what you want to

3716
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:55,520
in the context of what you want to
 

3717
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:56,549
in the context of what you want to
discuss that

3718
00:55:56,549 --> 00:55:56,559
discuss that
 

3719
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:58,069
discuss that
but and also people should follow you on

3720
00:55:58,069 --> 00:55:58,079
but and also people should follow you on
 

3721
00:55:58,079 --> 00:55:59,910
but and also people should follow you on
instagram you have a lot of kind of

3722
00:55:59,910 --> 00:55:59,920
instagram you have a lot of kind of
 

3723
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:03,510
instagram you have a lot of kind of
interesting um like little

3724
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:03,520
interesting um like little
 

3725
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,150
interesting um like little
glances into your training process into

3726
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:06,160
glances into your training process into
 

3727
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,670
glances into your training process into
your training thinking which is quite

3728
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:07,680
your training thinking which is quite
 

3729
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,109
your training thinking which is quite
fascinating but if you look at an

3730
00:56:09,109 --> 00:56:09,119
fascinating but if you look at an
 

3731
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:09,990
fascinating but if you look at an
optimal

3732
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:10,000
optimal
 

3733
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,589
optimal
training process what does that look

3734
00:56:11,589 --> 00:56:11,599
training process what does that look
 

3735
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:14,309
training process what does that look
like yeah so i think uh

3736
00:56:14,309 --> 00:56:14,319
like yeah so i think uh
 

3737
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:16,069
like yeah so i think uh
the if we're looking at it from like a

3738
00:56:16,069 --> 00:56:16,079
the if we're looking at it from like a
 

3739
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:18,150
the if we're looking at it from like a
philosophical level or like an approach

3740
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:18,160
philosophical level or like an approach
 

3741
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:18,710
philosophical level or like an approach
level

3742
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:18,720
level
 

3743
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:19,990
level
i think there's some things that carry

3744
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:20,000
i think there's some things that carry
 

3745
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,390
i think there's some things that carry
over from regardless of the distance

3746
00:56:22,390 --> 00:56:22,400
over from regardless of the distance
 

3747
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:26,390
over from regardless of the distance
so i think working on your weaknesses

3748
00:56:26,390 --> 00:56:26,400
so i think working on your weaknesses
 

3749
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,109
so i think working on your weaknesses
and things that are least specific to

3750
00:56:29,109 --> 00:56:29,119
and things that are least specific to
 

3751
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,789
and things that are least specific to
what you're going to do on race day

3752
00:56:30,789 --> 00:56:30,799
what you're going to do on race day
 

3753
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:32,309
what you're going to do on race day
but are still going to be important

3754
00:56:32,309 --> 00:56:32,319
but are still going to be important
 

3755
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:34,309
but are still going to be important
things in terms of improving your

3756
00:56:34,309 --> 00:56:34,319
things in terms of improving your
 

3757
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:35,270
things in terms of improving your
ability

3758
00:56:35,270 --> 00:56:35,280
ability
 

3759
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,510
ability
to perform on race day or maximizing

3760
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:37,520
to perform on race day or maximizing
 

3761
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:38,870
to perform on race day or maximizing
your potential

3762
00:56:38,870 --> 00:56:38,880
your potential
 

3763
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,030
your potential
uh with the things that are specific you

3764
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:41,040
uh with the things that are specific you
 

3765
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,230
uh with the things that are specific you
do first

3766
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:42,240
do first
 

3767
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:45,910
do first
i say that but the there's a caveat with

3768
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:45,920
i say that but the there's a caveat with
 

3769
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:46,870
i say that but the there's a caveat with
endurance sport i think

3770
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:46,880
endurance sport i think
 

3771
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,390
endurance sport i think
maybe even more specifically with things

3772
00:56:48,390 --> 00:56:48,400
maybe even more specifically with things
 

3773
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:49,910
maybe even more specifically with things
like our ultra marathons or 100 milers

3774
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:49,920
like our ultra marathons or 100 milers
 

3775
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:50,789
like our ultra marathons or 100 milers
where

3776
00:56:50,789 --> 00:56:50,799
where
 

3777
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:52,630
where
you want a really strong aerobic

3778
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:52,640
you want a really strong aerobic
 

3779
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,950
you want a really strong aerobic
foundation or like a base

3780
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:54,960
foundation or like a base
 

3781
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:57,510
foundation or like a base
before you really start i think

3782
00:56:57,510 --> 00:56:57,520
before you really start i think
 

3783
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,710
before you really start i think
structuring things

3784
00:56:58,710 --> 00:56:58,720
structuring things
 

3785
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:01,910
structuring things
towards a specific one so for me i think

3786
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:01,920
towards a specific one so for me i think
 

3787
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,630
towards a specific one so for me i think
like a target for me is oftentimes like

3788
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:04,640
like a target for me is oftentimes like
 

3789
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:07,750
like a target for me is oftentimes like
uh you know getting really fit at

3790
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:07,760
uh you know getting really fit at
 

3791
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,990
uh you know getting really fit at
like what my pace would be at like my

3792
00:57:09,990 --> 00:57:10,000
like what my pace would be at like my
 

3793
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,430
like what my pace would be at like my
aerobic threshold or what a lot of

3794
00:57:11,430 --> 00:57:11,440
aerobic threshold or what a lot of
 

3795
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,030
aerobic threshold or what a lot of
people may call like a maximum aerobic

3796
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:13,040
people may call like a maximum aerobic
 

3797
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,069
people may call like a maximum aerobic
function

3798
00:57:14,069 --> 00:57:14,079
function
 

3799
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:15,510
function
um i mean the running world is kind of

3800
00:57:15,510 --> 00:57:15,520
um i mean the running world is kind of
 

3801
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:16,390
um i mean the running world is kind of
weird where we have like these

3802
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:16,400
weird where we have like these
 

3803
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,829
weird where we have like these
terminologies where there's sometimes

3804
00:57:17,829 --> 00:57:17,839
terminologies where there's sometimes
 

3805
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:19,270
terminologies where there's sometimes
multiple words that essentially mean the

3806
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:19,280
multiple words that essentially mean the
 

3807
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,349
multiple words that essentially mean the
same thing but one is from like a

3808
00:57:21,349 --> 00:57:21,359
same thing but one is from like a
 

3809
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:23,589
same thing but one is from like a
just an actual physiological reaction

3810
00:57:23,589 --> 00:57:23,599
just an actual physiological reaction
 

3811
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:25,270
just an actual physiological reaction
and one is just like a feeling and stuff

3812
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:25,280
and one is just like a feeling and stuff
 

3813
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,430
and one is just like a feeling and stuff
like that so you mentioned time on feet

3814
00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:27,440
like that so you mentioned time on feet
 

3815
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:31,190
like that so you mentioned time on feet
versus time in optimal physiological

3816
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:31,200
versus time in optimal physiological
 

3817
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,270
versus time in optimal physiological
state like how important is it just to

3818
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:33,280
state like how important is it just to
 

3819
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,270
state like how important is it just to
get like running done

3820
00:57:35,270 --> 00:57:35,280
get like running done
 

3821
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,870
get like running done
versus like running in a particular pace

3822
00:57:38,870 --> 00:57:38,880
versus like running in a particular pace
 

3823
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,470
versus like running in a particular pace
that would depend on the event i would

3824
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:40,480
that would depend on the event i would
 

3825
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:43,270
that would depend on the event i would
say to a degree and and there's contra

3826
00:57:43,270 --> 00:57:43,280
say to a degree and and there's contra
 

3827
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,430
say to a degree and and there's contra
conflicting ideas about like kind of how

3828
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:45,440
conflicting ideas about like kind of how
 

3829
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,270
conflicting ideas about like kind of how
to structure it i think a lot of times

3830
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:47,280
to structure it i think a lot of times
 

3831
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:47,990
to structure it i think a lot of times
like

3832
00:57:47,990 --> 00:57:48,000
like
 

3833
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,870
like
uh you do want to like time on feet in

3834
00:57:50,870 --> 00:57:50,880
uh you do want to like time on feet in
 

3835
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,470
uh you do want to like time on feet in
most cases is just going to be like i'm

3836
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:52,480
most cases is just going to be like i'm
 

3837
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,510
most cases is just going to be like i'm
running easy whatever

3838
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:53,520
running easy whatever
 

3839
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,510
running easy whatever
feels easy that day and that can be

3840
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:55,520
feels easy that day and that can be
 

3841
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:56,789
feels easy that day and that can be
different from one day to the next like

3842
00:57:56,789 --> 00:57:56,799
different from one day to the next like
 

3843
00:57:56,799 --> 00:57:58,150
different from one day to the next like
i might feel great

3844
00:57:58,150 --> 00:57:58,160
i might feel great
 

3845
00:57:58,160 --> 00:57:59,990
i might feel great
and you know that produces a much faster

3846
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:00,000
and you know that produces a much faster
 

3847
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,670
and you know that produces a much faster
pace than if i you know feel really

3848
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:01,680
pace than if i you know feel really
 

3849
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,829
pace than if i you know feel really
miserable or something like that

3850
00:58:03,829 --> 00:58:03,839
miserable or something like that
 

3851
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:06,069
miserable or something like that
um so that's why i think a lot of times

3852
00:58:06,069 --> 00:58:06,079
um so that's why i think a lot of times
 

3853
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:08,069
um so that's why i think a lot of times
running will they'll do they're called

3854
00:58:08,069 --> 00:58:08,079
running will they'll do they're called
 

3855
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:08,710
running will they'll do they're called
perceived

3856
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:08,720
perceived
 

3857
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:11,030
perceived
perceived effort or perceived exertion

3858
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:11,040
perceived effort or perceived exertion
 

3859
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,549
perceived effort or perceived exertion
and they're

3860
00:58:12,549 --> 00:58:12,559
and they're
 

3861
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:15,190
and they're
you're looking at kind of understanding

3862
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:15,200
you're looking at kind of understanding
 

3863
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:15,750
you're looking at kind of understanding
the

3864
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:15,760
the
 

3865
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,470
the
response your body has to a certain

3866
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:18,480
response your body has to a certain
 

3867
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:18,950
response your body has to a certain
effort

3868
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:18,960
effort
 

3869
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,309
effort
level and you're supposed to target a

3870
00:58:20,309 --> 00:58:20,319
level and you're supposed to target a
 

3871
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:22,069
level and you're supposed to target a
certain effort level in order to like

3872
00:58:22,069 --> 00:58:22,079
certain effort level in order to like
 

3873
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,190
certain effort level in order to like
get a certain response so to maybe

3874
00:58:25,190 --> 00:58:25,200
get a certain response so to maybe
 

3875
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,470
get a certain response so to maybe
simplify that a little bit or make it a

3876
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:26,480
simplify that a little bit or make it a
 

3877
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:27,430
simplify that a little bit or make it a
little clearer like

3878
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:27,440
little clearer like
 

3879
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,829
little clearer like
i think i focus on essentially like

3880
00:58:29,829 --> 00:58:29,839
i think i focus on essentially like
 

3881
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:31,270
i think i focus on essentially like
short intervals

3882
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:31,280
short intervals
 

3883
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,750
short intervals
i focus on longer intervals or tempo

3884
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:33,760
i focus on longer intervals or tempo
 

3885
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,190
i focus on longer intervals or tempo
runs

3886
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:35,200
runs
 

3887
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:38,870
runs
i focus on um like race pace intensity

3888
00:58:38,870 --> 00:58:38,880
i focus on um like race pace intensity
 

3889
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,230
i focus on um like race pace intensity
which is a lot of times what i'll build

3890
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:40,240
which is a lot of times what i'll build
 

3891
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,309
which is a lot of times what i'll build
my long run around um

3892
00:58:42,309 --> 00:58:42,319
my long run around um
 

3893
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:44,710
my long run around um
but also like those are kind of like the

3894
00:58:44,710 --> 00:58:44,720
but also like those are kind of like the
 

3895
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:45,990
but also like those are kind of like the
small pieces to the puzzle

3896
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:46,000
small pieces to the puzzle
 

3897
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,109
small pieces to the puzzle
those are the options you're working

3898
00:58:47,109 --> 00:58:47,119
those are the options you're working
 

3899
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:49,270
those are the options you're working
with yeah but i'm gonna always try to

3900
00:58:49,270 --> 00:58:49,280
with yeah but i'm gonna always try to
 

3901
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,190
with yeah but i'm gonna always try to
work with those options on top of a

3902
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:51,200
work with those options on top of a
 

3903
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,710
work with those options on top of a
massive aerobic base which is going to

3904
00:58:52,710 --> 00:58:52,720
massive aerobic base which is going to
 

3905
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:53,829
massive aerobic base which is going to
probably be like 80

3906
00:58:53,829 --> 00:58:53,839
probably be like 80
 

3907
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:55,109
probably be like 80
of the work so how do you build that

3908
00:58:55,109 --> 00:58:55,119
of the work so how do you build that
 

3909
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:56,549
of the work so how do you build that
massive aerobic base what are we talking

3910
00:58:56,549 --> 00:58:56,559
massive aerobic base what are we talking
 

3911
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:57,910
massive aerobic base what are we talking
about just distance

3912
00:58:57,910 --> 00:58:57,920
about just distance
 

3913
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,710
about just distance
distance and essentially so i like to

3914
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:00,720
distance and essentially so i like to
 

3915
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:01,910
distance and essentially so i like to
call it micro stressing because you're

3916
00:59:01,910 --> 00:59:01,920
call it micro stressing because you're
 

3917
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:02,950
call it micro stressing because you're
going to always start at a different

3918
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:02,960
going to always start at a different
 

3919
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,390
going to always start at a different
spot depending on your fitness level's

3920
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:04,400
spot depending on your fitness level's
 

3921
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:05,829
spot depending on your fitness level's
at and depending on where you're at as

3922
00:59:05,829 --> 00:59:05,839
at and depending on where you're at as
 

3923
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:06,950
at and depending on where you're at as
an individual

3924
00:59:06,950 --> 00:59:06,960
an individual
 

3925
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,470
an individual
i'm gonna be targeting my aerobic

3926
00:59:08,470 --> 00:59:08,480
i'm gonna be targeting my aerobic
 

3927
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,390
i'm gonna be targeting my aerobic
threshold i'm gonna get right up to it

3928
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:10,400
threshold i'm gonna get right up to it
 

3929
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,870
threshold i'm gonna get right up to it
but not necessarily cross over it um

3930
00:59:12,870 --> 00:59:12,880
but not necessarily cross over it um
 

3931
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:13,990
but not necessarily cross over it um
it's it you know it's

3932
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:14,000
it's it you know it's
 

3933
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,349
it's it you know it's
it's been popularized with maximum

3934
00:59:15,349 --> 00:59:15,359
it's been popularized with maximum
 

3935
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:17,109
it's been popularized with maximum
aerobic function as kind of a training

3936
00:59:17,109 --> 00:59:17,119
aerobic function as kind of a training
 

3937
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,069
aerobic function as kind of a training
philosophy

3938
00:59:18,069 --> 00:59:18,079
philosophy
 

3939
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:21,270
philosophy
that philosophy in itself i think maybe

3940
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:21,280
that philosophy in itself i think maybe
 

3941
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,109
that philosophy in itself i think maybe
is a little more like holistic where

3942
00:59:23,109 --> 00:59:23,119
is a little more like holistic where
 

3943
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:25,270
is a little more like holistic where
they're saying do this basically all the

3944
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:25,280
they're saying do this basically all the
 

3945
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,150
they're saying do this basically all the
time

3946
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:26,160
time
 

3947
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,789
time
and by doing so you're gonna like you're

3948
00:59:28,789 --> 00:59:28,799
and by doing so you're gonna like you're
 

3949
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:29,750
and by doing so you're gonna like you're
gonna raise

3950
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:29,760
gonna raise
 

3951
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:32,470
gonna raise
your aerobic potential by so much that

3952
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:32,480
your aerobic potential by so much that
 

3953
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:33,990
your aerobic potential by so much that
you know you can kind of like

3954
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:34,000
you know you can kind of like
 

3955
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,670
you know you can kind of like
race yourself into shape at that point

3956
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:35,680
race yourself into shape at that point
 

3957
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,109
race yourself into shape at that point
and this would be maybe more specific

3958
00:59:37,109 --> 00:59:37,119
and this would be maybe more specific
 

3959
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:38,470
and this would be maybe more specific
for like shorter distance

3960
00:59:38,470 --> 00:59:38,480
for like shorter distance
 

3961
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:39,910
for like shorter distance
or endurance runs where you're not going

3962
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:39,920
or endurance runs where you're not going
 

3963
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,430
or endurance runs where you're not going
to race yourself in the shape of 100

3964
00:59:41,430 --> 00:59:41,440
to race yourself in the shape of 100
 

3965
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:41,990
to race yourself in the shape of 100
milers

3966
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:42,000
milers
 

3967
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,670
milers
but for 5ks you might you might do like

3968
00:59:43,670 --> 00:59:43,680
but for 5ks you might you might do like
 

3969
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,990
but for 5ks you might you might do like
a huge base building phase

3970
00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:46,000
a huge base building phase
 

3971
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,750
a huge base building phase
where you're going up to that maximum

3972
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:47,760
where you're going up to that maximum
 

3973
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,190
where you're going up to that maximum
aerobic function

3974
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:49,200
aerobic function
 

3975
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,150
aerobic function
or that aerobic threshold and you're

3976
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:52,160
or that aerobic threshold and you're
 

3977
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,829
or that aerobic threshold and you're
watching your pace come down

3978
00:59:53,829 --> 00:59:53,839
watching your pace come down
 

3979
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:55,910
watching your pace come down
at that so the rule there is basically

3980
00:59:55,910 --> 00:59:55,920
at that so the rule there is basically
 

3981
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,109
at that so the rule there is basically
like if you're seeing

3982
00:59:57,109 --> 00:59:57,119
like if you're seeing
 

3983
00:59:57,119 --> 00:59:58,950
like if you're seeing
improvement that's the sign you're

3984
00:59:58,950 --> 00:59:58,960
improvement that's the sign you're
 

3985
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:00,470
improvement that's the sign you're
looking for or which would just be your

3986
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:00,480
looking for or which would just be your
 

3987
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,230
looking for or which would just be your
pace dropping at that heart rate or at

3988
01:00:02,230 --> 01:00:02,240
pace dropping at that heart rate or at
 

3989
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:03,829
pace dropping at that heart rate or at
that intensity

3990
01:00:03,829 --> 01:00:03,839
that intensity
 

3991
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:06,069
that intensity
and uh if you're seeing that continually

3992
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:06,079
and uh if you're seeing that continually
 

3993
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:06,950
and uh if you're seeing that continually
go down you're heading in the right

3994
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:06,960
go down you're heading in the right
 

3995
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:08,390
go down you're heading in the right
direction if you start seeing it go the

3996
01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:08,400
direction if you start seeing it go the
 

3997
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:09,589
direction if you start seeing it go the
opposite way

3998
01:00:09,589 --> 01:00:09,599
opposite way
 

3999
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:11,670
opposite way
you're you're probably overreaching or

4000
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:11,680
you're you're probably overreaching or
 

4001
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,030
you're you're probably overreaching or
you're trying to do too much of it so

4002
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:13,040
you're trying to do too much of it so
 

4003
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:15,030
you're trying to do too much of it so
that's kind of dictates how much the

4004
01:00:15,030 --> 01:00:15,040
that's kind of dictates how much the
 

4005
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,710
that's kind of dictates how much the
dose i guess you'd say when we talk

4006
01:00:16,710 --> 01:00:16,720
dose i guess you'd say when we talk
 

4007
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,470
dose i guess you'd say when we talk
about max aerobic function we're talking

4008
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:18,480
about max aerobic function we're talking
 

4009
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:18,789
about max aerobic function we're talking
about

4010
01:00:18,789 --> 01:00:18,799
about
 

4011
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:20,630
about
heart rate as the ultimate as the really

4012
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:20,640
heart rate as the ultimate as the really
 

4013
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,230
heart rate as the ultimate as the really
important metric here so

4014
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:22,240
important metric here so
 

4015
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,670
important metric here so
maintaining a particular heart rate

4016
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:23,680
maintaining a particular heart rate
 

4017
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:26,230
maintaining a particular heart rate
during the run uh

4018
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:26,240
during the run uh
 

4019
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:27,750
during the run uh
is that the measure that like how do you

4020
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:27,760
is that the measure that like how do you
 

4021
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,190
is that the measure that like how do you
know you're in the right yeah yeah and

4022
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:29,200
know you're in the right yeah yeah and
 

4023
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,069
know you're in the right yeah yeah and
then that's where it gets a little

4024
01:00:30,069 --> 01:00:30,079
then that's where it gets a little
 

4025
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:31,589
then that's where it gets a little
tricky because like unless you go into a

4026
01:00:31,589 --> 01:00:31,599
tricky because like unless you go into a
 

4027
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:31,990
tricky because like unless you go into a
lab

4028
01:00:31,990 --> 01:00:32,000
lab
 

4029
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,829
lab
and get your aerobic threshold tested

4030
01:00:33,829 --> 01:00:33,839
and get your aerobic threshold tested
 

4031
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:35,349
and get your aerobic threshold tested
it's really hard to have like an exact

4032
01:00:35,349 --> 01:00:35,359
it's really hard to have like an exact
 

4033
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:36,390
it's really hard to have like an exact
number on it

4034
01:00:36,390 --> 01:00:36,400
number on it
 

4035
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,549
number on it
um you know dr phil maffetone with the

4036
01:00:38,549 --> 01:00:38,559
um you know dr phil maffetone with the
 

4037
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:40,150
um you know dr phil maffetone with the
maximum function process

4038
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:40,160
maximum function process
 

4039
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:42,069
maximum function process
he'll say 180 minus your age is going to

4040
01:00:42,069 --> 01:00:42,079
he'll say 180 minus your age is going to
 

4041
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:43,910
he'll say 180 minus your age is going to
give you your yeah that's the math 180

4042
01:00:43,910 --> 01:00:43,920
give you your yeah that's the math 180
 

4043
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,270
give you your yeah that's the math 180
formula that i thought was

4044
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:45,280
formula that i thought was
 

4045
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,270
formula that i thought was
fascinating for it's like in the same

4046
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:47,280
fascinating for it's like in the same
 

4047
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:48,470
fascinating for it's like in the same
way e equals

4048
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:48,480
way e equals
 

4049
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,470
way e equals
e equals m c squared it's fascinating

4050
01:00:50,470 --> 01:00:50,480
e equals m c squared it's fascinating
 

4051
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,829
e equals m c squared it's fascinating
that there could be a formula that

4052
01:00:51,829 --> 01:00:51,839
that there could be a formula that
 

4053
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:53,510
that there could be a formula that
captures like optimal running

4054
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:53,520
captures like optimal running
 

4055
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,349
captures like optimal running
yeah so that for people who don't know

4056
01:00:55,349 --> 01:00:55,359
yeah so that for people who don't know
 

4057
01:00:55,359 --> 01:00:58,230
yeah so that for people who don't know
that's 180 minus your age

4058
01:00:58,230 --> 01:00:58,240
that's 180 minus your age
 

4059
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:59,829
that's 180 minus your age
if you train at that heart rate if you

4060
01:00:59,829 --> 01:00:59,839
if you train at that heart rate if you
 

4061
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:01,109
if you train at that heart rate if you
run at that heart rate you're going to

4062
01:01:01,109 --> 01:01:01,119
run at that heart rate you're going to
 

4063
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:01,990
run at that heart rate you're going to
progress a lot

4064
01:01:01,990 --> 01:01:02,000
progress a lot
 

4065
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,190
progress a lot
and here's the advantage of that i think

4066
01:01:03,190 --> 01:01:03,200
and here's the advantage of that i think
 

4067
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:05,030
and here's the advantage of that i think
like with any of these things you want

4068
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:05,040
like with any of these things you want
 

4069
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,950
like with any of these things you want
to look at it through

4070
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:06,960
to look at it through
 

4071
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,630
to look at it through
where are the advantages here and i need

4072
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:08,640
where are the advantages here and i need
 

4073
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:09,990
where are the advantages here and i need
to account for those and then where are

4074
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:10,000
to account for those and then where are
 

4075
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,430
to account for those and then where are
the potential disadvantages

4076
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:11,440
the potential disadvantages
 

4077
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:13,990
the potential disadvantages
and then decide for me as an individual

4078
01:01:13,990 --> 01:01:14,000
and then decide for me as an individual
 

4079
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,430
and then decide for me as an individual
do these advantages outweigh the

4080
01:01:15,430 --> 01:01:15,440
do these advantages outweigh the
 

4081
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:16,390
do these advantages outweigh the
disadvantages

4082
01:01:16,390 --> 01:01:16,400
disadvantages
 

4083
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:17,910
disadvantages
and what's the alternative approach and

4084
01:01:17,910 --> 01:01:17,920
and what's the alternative approach and
 

4085
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:19,349
and what's the alternative approach and
is that going to produce more advantages

4086
01:01:19,349 --> 01:01:19,359
is that going to produce more advantages
 

4087
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:20,150
is that going to produce more advantages
or less

4088
01:01:20,150 --> 01:01:20,160
or less
 

4089
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,789
or less
so with with maximum work function uh

4090
01:01:22,789 --> 01:01:22,799
so with with maximum work function uh
 

4091
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:23,990
so with with maximum work function uh
here's some advantages like

4092
01:01:23,990 --> 01:01:24,000
here's some advantages like
 

4093
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,910
here's some advantages like
it is low enough intensity where you can

4094
01:01:27,910 --> 01:01:27,920
it is low enough intensity where you can
 

4095
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:30,549
it is low enough intensity where you can
train pretty consistently at a fairly

4096
01:01:30,549 --> 01:01:30,559
train pretty consistently at a fairly
 

4097
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:31,910
train pretty consistently at a fairly
high volume

4098
01:01:31,910 --> 01:01:31,920
high volume
 

4099
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,950
high volume
with a very low injury risk with uh

4100
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:34,960
with a very low injury risk with uh
 

4101
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,030
with a very low injury risk with uh
very low like things that are gonna

4102
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:37,040
very low like things that are gonna
 

4103
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:38,390
very low like things that are gonna
maybe lower your quality of life like

4104
01:01:38,390 --> 01:01:38,400
maybe lower your quality of life like
 

4105
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,309
maybe lower your quality of life like
muscle damage and things like that

4106
01:01:40,309 --> 01:01:40,319
muscle damage and things like that
 

4107
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:42,470
muscle damage and things like that
um it's a more efficient way in the

4108
01:01:42,470 --> 01:01:42,480
um it's a more efficient way in the
 

4109
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:44,150
um it's a more efficient way in the
sense that you're gonna be like

4110
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:44,160
sense that you're gonna be like
 

4111
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,230
sense that you're gonna be like
prioritizing like fat metabolization

4112
01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:46,240
prioritizing like fat metabolization
 

4113
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,990
prioritizing like fat metabolization
which um i mean if you're looking at

4114
01:01:47,990 --> 01:01:48,000
which um i mean if you're looking at
 

4115
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,349
which um i mean if you're looking at
like jeff folick and

4116
01:01:49,349 --> 01:01:49,359
like jeff folick and
 

4117
01:01:49,359 --> 01:01:51,190
like jeff folick and
or dr jeff folik and dr dominic

4118
01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:51,200
or dr jeff folik and dr dominic
 

4119
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,950
or dr jeff folik and dr dominic
d'agostino some of their research and

4120
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:52,960
d'agostino some of their research and
 

4121
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,150
d'agostino some of their research and
things like that like

4122
01:01:54,150 --> 01:01:54,160
things like that like
 

4123
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:55,750
things like that like
they're going to show that you know

4124
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:55,760
they're going to show that you know
 

4125
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,190
they're going to show that you know
that's going to be a little cleaner way

4126
01:01:57,190 --> 01:01:57,200
that's going to be a little cleaner way
 

4127
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,870
that's going to be a little cleaner way
to go about things from just a recovery

4128
01:01:58,870 --> 01:01:58,880
to go about things from just a recovery
 

4129
01:01:58,880 --> 01:01:59,750
to go about things from just a recovery
standpoint

4130
01:01:59,750 --> 01:01:59,760
standpoint
 

4131
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,910
standpoint
a breakdown standpoint so they could be

4132
01:02:01,910 --> 01:02:01,920
a breakdown standpoint so they could be
 

4133
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,230
a breakdown standpoint so they could be
like a what they call like a fat adapted

4134
01:02:04,230 --> 01:02:04,240
like a what they call like a fat adapted
 

4135
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:05,670
like a what they call like a fat adapted
athlete so you can

4136
01:02:05,670 --> 01:02:05,680
athlete so you can
 

4137
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,390
athlete so you can
go to your fat stores for energy if

4138
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:08,400
go to your fat stores for energy if
 

4139
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:08,789
go to your fat stores for energy if
you're

4140
01:02:08,789 --> 01:02:08,799
you're
 

4141
01:02:08,799 --> 01:02:11,029
you're
applying this map what is it called by

4142
01:02:11,029 --> 01:02:11,039
applying this map what is it called by
 

4143
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:12,390
applying this map what is it called by
the way math 180

4144
01:02:12,390 --> 01:02:12,400
the way math 180
 

4145
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,390
the way math 180
is that is that a good is it what are

4146
01:02:14,390 --> 01:02:14,400
is that is that a good is it what are
 

4147
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,150
is that is that a good is it what are
your thoughts about in general

4148
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:16,160
your thoughts about in general
 

4149
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:18,470
your thoughts about in general
for yourself and for the broader

4150
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:18,480
for yourself and for the broader
 

4151
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,870
for yourself and for the broader
population i think the maf 180 formula

4152
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:20,880
population i think the maf 180 formula
 

4153
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:21,430
population i think the maf 180 formula
is

4154
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:21,440
is
 

4155
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:24,150
is
about as good of a formula as you're

4156
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:24,160
about as good of a formula as you're
 

4157
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:25,990
about as good of a formula as you're
going to find in terms of capturing

4158
01:02:25,990 --> 01:02:26,000
going to find in terms of capturing
 

4159
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,510
going to find in terms of capturing
as many people as you can get away with

4160
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:27,520
as many people as you can get away with
 

4161
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,190
as many people as you can get away with
capturing with a kind of a universal

4162
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:29,200
capturing with a kind of a universal
 

4163
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,230
capturing with a kind of a universal
thing

4164
01:02:30,230 --> 01:02:30,240
thing
 

4165
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:32,470
thing
like any of these things i mean it's

4166
01:02:32,470 --> 01:02:32,480
like any of these things i mean it's
 

4167
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:34,069
like any of these things i mean it's
more likely kind of on a bell curve

4168
01:02:34,069 --> 01:02:34,079
more likely kind of on a bell curve
 

4169
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:34,789
more likely kind of on a bell curve
where

4170
01:02:34,789 --> 01:02:34,799
where
 

4171
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:37,670
where
like the bulk of that 180 minus three is

4172
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:37,680
like the bulk of that 180 minus three is
 

4173
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:38,870
like the bulk of that 180 minus three is
probably going to be a pretty good at

4174
01:02:38,870 --> 01:02:38,880
probably going to be a pretty good at
 

4175
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,309
probably going to be a pretty good at
least starting point to kind of figure

4176
01:02:40,309 --> 01:02:40,319
least starting point to kind of figure
 

4177
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:41,190
least starting point to kind of figure
out where that is

4178
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:41,200
out where that is
 

4179
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:42,470
out where that is
there's some other things you can like

4180
01:02:42,470 --> 01:02:42,480
there's some other things you can like
 

4181
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,710
there's some other things you can like
maybe use to kind of check it

4182
01:02:44,710 --> 01:02:44,720
maybe use to kind of check it
 

4183
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:47,029
maybe use to kind of check it
that i like to do if i'm let's say i

4184
01:02:47,029 --> 01:02:47,039
that i like to do if i'm let's say i
 

4185
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:49,029
that i like to do if i'm let's say i
just i did 180 minus my age i went out

4186
01:02:49,029 --> 01:02:49,039
just i did 180 minus my age i went out
 

4187
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:51,029
just i did 180 minus my age i went out
and i started running and it was like

4188
01:02:51,029 --> 01:02:51,039
and i started running and it was like
 

4189
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:53,190
and i started running and it was like
i'm running along and i'm just like my

4190
01:02:53,190 --> 01:02:53,200
i'm running along and i'm just like my
 

4191
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,549
i'm running along and i'm just like my
my breathing is labored

my breathing is labored
 

4193
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:56,950
my breathing is labored
i'm you know i'm struggling to get a

4194
01:02:56,950 --> 01:02:56,960
i'm you know i'm struggling to get a
 

4195
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:59,190
i'm you know i'm struggling to get a
sentence out without gasping for breath

4196
01:02:59,190 --> 01:02:59,200
sentence out without gasping for breath
 

4197
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:00,630
sentence out without gasping for breath
well that's my body telling me i'm

4198
01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:00,640
well that's my body telling me i'm
 

4199
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:02,950
well that's my body telling me i'm
probably not actually at my true

4200
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:02,960
probably not actually at my true
 

4201
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:04,870
probably not actually at my true
like math number or my true like

like
 

4207
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,470
like
aerobic threshold and maximum function

01:03:08,470 --> 01:03:08,480
aerobic threshold and maximum function
 

4209
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:09,829
aerobic threshold and maximum function
you should be able to do that for hours

4210
01:03:09,829 --> 01:03:09,839
you should be able to do that for hours
 

4211
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:11,349
you should be able to do that for hours
and you should be able to breathe pretty

4212
01:03:11,349 --> 01:03:11,359
and you should be able to breathe pretty
 

4213
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:12,150
and you should be able to breathe pretty
efficiently

01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,349
people will say like
you another way to kind of gauge it if

4220
01:03:17,349 --> 01:03:17,359
you another way to kind of gauge it if
 

4221
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:18,870
you another way to kind of gauge it if
you can breathe in your nose and out

4222
01:03:18,870 --> 01:03:18,880
you can breathe in your nose and out
 

4223
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:19,670
you can breathe in your nose and out
your mouth

4224
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:19,680
your mouth
 

4225
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,270
your mouth
that's not necessarily the best way to

4226
01:03:21,270 --> 01:03:21,280
that's not necessarily the best way to
 

4227
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,109
that's not necessarily the best way to
do on a from a performance standpoint

4228
01:03:23,109 --> 01:03:23,119
do on a from a performance standpoint
 

4229
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:24,470
do on a from a performance standpoint
but it can be a good

4230
01:03:24,470 --> 01:03:24,480
but it can be a good
 

4231
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,789
but it can be a good
kind of governor that will allow you to

4232
01:03:26,789 --> 01:03:26,799
kind of governor that will allow you to
 

4233
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:27,510
kind of governor that will allow you to
like if you can

4234
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:27,520
like if you can
 

4235
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:28,710
like if you can
if you can no longer breathe in your

4236
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:28,720
if you can no longer breathe in your
 

4237
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:29,910
if you can no longer breathe in your
nose and out your mouth you're probably

4238
01:03:29,910 --> 01:03:29,920
nose and out your mouth you're probably
 

4239
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:31,589
nose and out your mouth you're probably
going too fast actually technically be

4240
01:03:31,589 --> 01:03:31,599
going too fast actually technically be
 

4241
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:32,870
going too fast actually technically be
at your math pace or under your math

4242
01:03:32,870 --> 01:03:32,880
at your math pace or under your math
 

4243
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:33,910
at your math pace or under your math
pace yeah i had a

4244
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:33,920
pace yeah i had a
 

4245
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:36,950
pace yeah i had a
actually when i was in in better shape

4246
01:03:36,950 --> 01:03:36,960
actually when i was in in better shape
 

4247
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:39,270
actually when i was in in better shape
i had trouble getting to that math

4248
01:03:39,270 --> 01:03:39,280
i had trouble getting to that math
 

4249
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:40,150
i had trouble getting to that math
number

4250
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:40,160
number
 

4251
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:43,109
number
i found myself like either i would be

4252
01:03:43,109 --> 01:03:43,119
i found myself like either i would be
 

4253
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:43,990
i found myself like either i would be
doing way too much

4254
01:03:43,990 --> 01:03:44,000
doing way too much
 

4255
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,309
doing way too much
work like it's too hard to do it was too

4256
01:03:46,309 --> 01:03:46,319
work like it's too hard to do it was too
 

4257
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:48,309
work like it's too hard to do it was too
hard to get to that number i was running

4258
01:03:48,309 --> 01:03:48,319
hard to get to that number i was running
 

4259
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:48,870
hard to get to that number i was running
a much

4260
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:48,880
a much
 

4261
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:51,910
a much
lower heart rate like 10 to 20 what do

4262
01:03:51,910 --> 01:03:51,920
lower heart rate like 10 to 20 what do
 

4263
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:52,870
lower heart rate like 10 to 20 what do
you call that beats

4264
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:52,880
you call that beats
 

4265
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:55,990
you call that beats
lower and that's i was still for myself

4266
01:03:55,990 --> 01:03:56,000
lower and that's i was still for myself
 

4267
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,670
lower and that's i was still for myself
happy with the pace it was good pace and

4268
01:03:57,670 --> 01:03:57,680
happy with the pace it was good pace and
 

4269
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:00,069
happy with the pace it was good pace and
yeah and i was felt good i was smiling

4270
01:04:00,069 --> 01:04:00,079
yeah and i was felt good i was smiling
 

4271
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:01,109
yeah and i was felt good i was smiling
and enjoying life

4272
01:04:01,109 --> 01:04:01,119
and enjoying life
 

4273
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:04,150
and enjoying life
and yeah uh i did and with the moment i

4274
01:04:04,150 --> 01:04:04,160
and yeah uh i did and with the moment i
 

4275
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:05,430
and yeah uh i did and with the moment i
take myself to that

4276
01:04:05,430 --> 01:04:05,440
take myself to that
 

4277
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:08,470
take myself to that
uh level of like the math 180 level

4278
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:08,480
uh level of like the math 180 level
 

4279
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:10,230
uh level of like the math 180 level
that's like definitely like a real

4280
01:04:10,230 --> 01:04:10,240
that's like definitely like a real
 

4281
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:12,309
that's like definitely like a real
workout yeah and it felt like i can't do

4282
01:04:12,309 --> 01:04:12,319
workout yeah and it felt like i can't do
 

4283
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:13,109
workout yeah and it felt like i can't do
that for five

4284
01:04:13,109 --> 01:04:13,119
that for five
 

4285
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:16,230
that for five
10 15 miles like i i started feeling it

4286
01:04:16,230 --> 01:04:16,240
10 15 miles like i i started feeling it
 

4287
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:18,309
10 15 miles like i i started feeling it
like this is a one or two mile thing

4288
01:04:18,309 --> 01:04:18,319
like this is a one or two mile thing
 

4289
01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:22,069
like this is a one or two mile thing
now but i think his answer to that uh

4290
01:04:22,069 --> 01:04:22,079
now but i think his answer to that uh
 

4291
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:25,190
now but i think his answer to that uh
i feel me don't answer is maybe

4292
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:25,200
i feel me don't answer is maybe
 

4293
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:28,630
i feel me don't answer is maybe
you're supposed to like uh what

4294
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:28,640
you're supposed to like uh what
 

4295
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,230
you're supposed to like uh what
maybe do some more sprints or something

4296
01:04:30,230 --> 01:04:30,240
maybe do some more sprints or something
 

4297
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:31,910
maybe do some more sprints or something
like that or build up your

4298
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:31,920
like that or build up your
 

4299
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:34,549
like that or build up your
maybe like i'm too weak yeah musculature

4300
01:04:34,549 --> 01:04:34,559
maybe like i'm too weak yeah musculature
 

4301
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:35,109
maybe like i'm too weak yeah musculature
wise

4302
01:04:35,109 --> 01:04:35,119
wise
 

4303
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:37,990
wise
to like uh yeah like that that's a sign

4304
01:04:37,990 --> 01:04:38,000
to like uh yeah like that that's a sign
 

4305
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,270
to like uh yeah like that that's a sign
that you need to work on some stuff you

4306
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:39,280
that you need to work on some stuff you
 

4307
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:40,630
that you need to work on some stuff you
can't just keep enjoying life

4308
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:40,640
can't just keep enjoying life
 

4309
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:41,829
can't just keep enjoying life
there's there's two ways to look at that

4310
01:04:41,829 --> 01:04:41,839
there's there's two ways to look at that
 

4311
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:43,750
there's there's two ways to look at that
i think and i think you're you're you're

4312
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:43,760
i think and i think you're you're you're
 

4313
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:44,870
i think and i think you're you're you're
right on i think that

4314
01:04:44,870 --> 01:04:44,880
right on i think that
 

4315
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:47,430
right on i think that
what the advice from that from that kind

4316
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:47,440
what the advice from that from that kind
 

4317
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:47,910
what the advice from that from that kind
of a

4318
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:47,920
of a
 

4319
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:51,029
of a
process would say is either you you're

4320
01:04:51,029 --> 01:04:51,039
process would say is either you you're
 

4321
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:52,230
process would say is either you you're
doing too much of it

4322
01:04:52,230 --> 01:04:52,240
doing too much of it
 

4323
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:53,990
doing too much of it
so it's getting too hard for where your

4324
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:54,000
so it's getting too hard for where your
 

4325
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,069
so it's getting too hard for where your
skeletal muscle system is currently at

4326
01:04:56,069 --> 01:04:56,079
skeletal muscle system is currently at
 

4327
01:04:56,079 --> 01:04:58,309
skeletal muscle system is currently at
for that particular activity so like i

4328
01:04:58,309 --> 01:04:58,319
for that particular activity so like i
 

4329
01:04:58,319 --> 01:04:59,750
for that particular activity so like i
mean it can be different too like if

4330
01:04:59,750 --> 01:04:59,760
mean it can be different too like if
 

4331
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,190
mean it can be different too like if
you're cycling versus running you know

4332
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:01,200
you're cycling versus running you know
 

4333
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,470
you're cycling versus running you know
that's a little bit of different

4334
01:05:02,470 --> 01:05:02,480
that's a little bit of different
 

4335
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:04,150
that's a little bit of different
mechanic where it can be different where

4336
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:04,160
mechanic where it can be different where
 

4337
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:05,990
mechanic where it can be different where
you could take a super fit

4338
01:05:05,990 --> 01:05:06,000
you could take a super fit
 

4339
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,870
you could take a super fit
cyclist and then put them on you know

4340
01:05:08,870 --> 01:05:08,880
cyclist and then put them on you know
 

4341
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:09,990
cyclist and then put them on you know
the amount of volume they're gonna be

4342
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:10,000
the amount of volume they're gonna be
 

4343
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:10,789
the amount of volume they're gonna be
able to tolerate

4344
01:05:10,789 --> 01:05:10,799
able to tolerate
 

4345
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:12,309
able to tolerate
relative to what you're gonna do when

4346
01:05:12,309 --> 01:05:12,319
relative to what you're gonna do when
 

4347
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:13,910
relative to what you're gonna do when
you remove like impact forces and things

4348
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:13,920
you remove like impact forces and things
 

4349
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:14,789
you remove like impact forces and things
like that

4350
01:05:14,789 --> 01:05:14,799
like that
 

4351
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:16,150
like that
is gonna be lower if they haven't been

4352
01:05:16,150 --> 01:05:16,160
is gonna be lower if they haven't been
 

4353
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:17,990
is gonna be lower if they haven't been
practicing that activity so for you like

4354
01:05:17,990 --> 01:05:18,000
practicing that activity so for you like
 

4355
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,069
practicing that activity so for you like
you know you're prioritizing like uh

4356
01:05:20,069 --> 01:05:20,079
you know you're prioritizing like uh
 

4357
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:22,630
you know you're prioritizing like uh
uh wrestling and mixed martial are not

4358
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:22,640
uh wrestling and mixed martial are not
 

4359
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:24,069
uh wrestling and mixed martial are not
mixed martial arts but jiu jitsu type

4360
01:05:24,069 --> 01:05:24,079
mixed martial arts but jiu jitsu type
 

4361
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:25,109
mixed martial arts but jiu jitsu type
stuff so

4362
01:05:25,109 --> 01:05:25,119
stuff so
 

4363
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:27,910
stuff so
uh you know running is maybe kind of

4364
01:05:27,910 --> 01:05:27,920
uh you know running is maybe kind of
 

4365
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:28,630
uh you know running is maybe kind of
that

4366
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:28,640
that
 

4367
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:31,029
that
that uh that secondary activity versus

4368
01:05:31,029 --> 01:05:31,039
that uh that secondary activity versus
 

4369
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:32,549
that uh that secondary activity versus
the primary activity

4370
01:05:32,549 --> 01:05:32,559
the primary activity
 

4371
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:34,230
the primary activity
but yeah so what they would say is

4372
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:34,240
but yeah so what they would say is
 

4373
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:35,670
but yeah so what they would say is
probably like maybe instead of doing

4374
01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:35,680
probably like maybe instead of doing
 

4375
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:36,470
probably like maybe instead of doing
that

4376
01:05:36,470 --> 01:05:36,480
that
 

4377
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:37,910
that
at let's say you were doing that for

4378
01:05:37,910 --> 01:05:37,920
at let's say you were doing that for
 

4379
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:39,670
at let's say you were doing that for
like 30 miles a week or something like

4380
01:05:39,670 --> 01:05:39,680
like 30 miles a week or something like
 

4381
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:41,510
like 30 miles a week or something like
that and it was getting too hard to

4382
01:05:41,510 --> 01:05:41,520
that and it was getting too hard to
 

4383
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:42,390
that and it was getting too hard to
continue

4384
01:05:42,390 --> 01:05:42,400
continue
 

4385
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:44,710
continue
they'd say you know come back to 20 get

4386
01:05:44,710 --> 01:05:44,720
they'd say you know come back to 20 get
 

4387
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:46,950
they'd say you know come back to 20 get
used to 20 get comfortable with 20.

4388
01:05:46,950 --> 01:05:46,960
used to 20 get comfortable with 20.
 

4389
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:48,789
used to 20 get comfortable with 20.
then let's get you up to 25 and 30 and

4390
01:05:48,789 --> 01:05:48,799
then let's get you up to 25 and 30 and
 

4391
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:51,109
then let's get you up to 25 and 30 and
kind of just like inch you along

4392
01:05:51,109 --> 01:05:51,119
kind of just like inch you along
 

4393
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:54,069
kind of just like inch you along
one of the intuitions i had about the

4394
01:05:54,069 --> 01:05:54,079
one of the intuitions i had about the
 

4395
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:55,829
one of the intuitions i had about the
ways i was failing at running

4396
01:05:55,829 --> 01:05:55,839
ways i was failing at running
 

4397
01:05:55,839 --> 01:05:58,390
ways i was failing at running
is the form was probably not great like

4398
01:05:58,390 --> 01:05:58,400
is the form was probably not great like
 

4399
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,230
is the form was probably not great like
the the way to get

4400
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:00,240
the the way to get
 

4401
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:04,069
the the way to get
to those 30 40 miles is to get the form

4402
01:06:04,069 --> 01:06:04,079
to those 30 40 miles is to get the form
 

4403
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:04,630
to those 30 40 miles is to get the form
right

4404
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:04,640
right
 

4405
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,630
right
maybe i was doing too big of steps not

4406
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:06,640
maybe i was doing too big of steps not
 

4407
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:07,829
maybe i was doing too big of steps not
so like

4408
01:06:07,829 --> 01:06:07,839
so like
 

4409
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:09,190
so like
playing with a different gate playing

4410
01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:09,200
playing with a different gate playing
 

4411
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:10,950
playing with a different gate playing
with a different kind of um

4412
01:06:10,950 --> 01:06:10,960
with a different kind of um
 

4413
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:12,710
with a different kind of um
the form kind of you have your form the

4414
01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:12,720
the form kind of you have your form the
 

4415
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:14,789
the form kind of you have your form the
economy the efficiency yeah

4416
01:06:14,789 --> 01:06:14,799
economy the efficiency yeah
 

4417
01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:16,390
economy the efficiency yeah
so that was the intuition like i was

4418
01:06:16,390 --> 01:06:16,400
so that was the intuition like i was
 

4419
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,150
so that was the intuition like i was
doing something wrong but i suppose

4420
01:06:18,150 --> 01:06:18,160
doing something wrong but i suppose
 

4421
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:19,430
doing something wrong but i suppose
that's the benefit of these kind of

4422
01:06:19,430 --> 01:06:19,440
that's the benefit of these kind of
 

4423
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,349
that's the benefit of these kind of
formulas it challenges you to think like

4424
01:06:21,349 --> 01:06:21,359
formulas it challenges you to think like
 

4425
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:23,109
formulas it challenges you to think like
how can i improve this kind of stuff

4426
01:06:23,109 --> 01:06:23,119
how can i improve this kind of stuff
 

4427
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:25,829
how can i improve this kind of stuff
well and it also it simplifies it so

4428
01:06:25,829 --> 01:06:25,839
well and it also it simplifies it so
 

4429
01:06:25,839 --> 01:06:26,390
well and it also it simplifies it so
much

4430
01:06:26,390 --> 01:06:26,400
much
 

4431
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,150
much
that you're forced to right you're

4432
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:28,160
that you're forced to right you're
 

4433
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:29,829
that you're forced to right you're
forced to optimize within that

4434
01:06:29,829 --> 01:06:29,839
forced to optimize within that
 

4435
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:32,870
forced to optimize within that
real strict parameter versus am i doing

4436
01:06:32,870 --> 01:06:32,880
real strict parameter versus am i doing
 

4437
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:34,230
real strict parameter versus am i doing
my short intervals right

4438
01:06:34,230 --> 01:06:34,240
my short intervals right
 

4439
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,309
my short intervals right
but my long run is wrong or am i doing

4440
01:06:36,309 --> 01:06:36,319
but my long run is wrong or am i doing
 

4441
01:06:36,319 --> 01:06:38,470
but my long run is wrong or am i doing
my like long intervals right but my

4442
01:06:38,470 --> 01:06:38,480
my like long intervals right but my
 

4443
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:39,270
my like long intervals right but my
short intervals and

4444
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:39,280
short intervals and
 

4445
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:40,710
short intervals and
you just it kind of complicates things

4446
01:06:40,710 --> 01:06:40,720
you just it kind of complicates things
 

4447
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:41,910
you just it kind of complicates things
when you start throwing a lot of stuff

4448
01:06:41,910 --> 01:06:41,920
when you start throwing a lot of stuff
 

4449
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:42,710
when you start throwing a lot of stuff
there

4450
01:06:42,710 --> 01:06:42,720
there
 

4451
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:43,910
there
and for most people especially when

4452
01:06:43,910 --> 01:06:43,920
and for most people especially when
 

4453
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,829
and for most people especially when
they're first getting started you know

4454
01:06:45,829 --> 01:06:45,839
they're first getting started you know
 

4455
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:46,950
they're first getting started you know
you're

4456
01:06:46,950 --> 01:06:46,960
you're
 

4457
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:48,630
you're
you can't over complicate it or you're

4458
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:48,640
you can't over complicate it or you're
 

4459
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:49,990
you can't over complicate it or you're
just gonna like you're gonna do like a

4460
01:06:49,990 --> 01:06:50,000
just gonna like you're gonna do like a
 

4461
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,029
just gonna like you're gonna do like a
bunch of half

4462
01:06:51,029 --> 01:06:51,039
bunch of half
 

4463
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:52,789
bunch of half
right half wrong things and then not

4464
01:06:52,789 --> 01:06:52,799
right half wrong things and then not
 

4465
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:54,549
right half wrong things and then not
really know where your progress or your

4466
01:06:54,549 --> 01:06:54,559
really know where your progress or your
 

4467
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:56,309
really know where your progress or your
deficits are necessarily at

4468
01:06:56,309 --> 01:06:56,319
deficits are necessarily at
 

4469
01:06:56,319 --> 01:06:58,789
deficits are necessarily at
so i do think this is an amazing

4470
01:06:58,789 --> 01:06:58,799
so i do think this is an amazing
 

4471
01:06:58,799 --> 01:06:59,510
so i do think this is an amazing
approach

4472
01:06:59,510 --> 01:06:59,520
approach
 

4473
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:00,789
approach
especially for people who are just

4474
01:07:00,789 --> 01:07:00,799
especially for people who are just
 

4475
01:07:00,799 --> 01:07:02,710
especially for people who are just
getting into it and building that that

4476
01:07:02,710 --> 01:07:02,720
getting into it and building that that
 

4477
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:03,990
getting into it and building that that
foundation

4478
01:07:03,990 --> 01:07:04,000
foundation
 

4479
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,950
foundation
um where where i think maybe you want to

4480
01:07:06,950 --> 01:07:06,960
um where where i think maybe you want to
 

4481
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:07,990
um where where i think maybe you want to
deviate from that a little bit

4482
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:08,000
deviate from that a little bit
 

4483
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,029
deviate from that a little bit
especially when you start to get into

4484
01:07:09,029 --> 01:07:09,039
especially when you start to get into
 

4485
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:10,870
especially when you start to get into
these events that are operating

4486
01:07:10,870 --> 01:07:10,880
these events that are operating
 

4487
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:13,990
these events that are operating
well outside that intensity so you take

4488
01:07:13,990 --> 01:07:14,000
well outside that intensity so you take
 

4489
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,390
well outside that intensity so you take
something like um you know let's say

4490
01:07:16,390 --> 01:07:16,400
something like um you know let's say
 

4491
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:17,910
something like um you know let's say
it's a race that takes you

4492
01:07:17,910 --> 01:07:17,920
it's a race that takes you
 

4493
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:19,589
it's a race that takes you
in the neighborhood of around like 12

4494
01:07:19,589 --> 01:07:19,599
in the neighborhood of around like 12
 

4495
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:21,349
in the neighborhood of around like 12
minutes or something like that

4496
01:07:21,349 --> 01:07:21,359
minutes or something like that
 

4497
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:22,470
minutes or something like that
then you're gonna be running

4498
01:07:22,470 --> 01:07:22,480
then you're gonna be running
 

4499
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:23,990
then you're gonna be running
significantly faster than your your

4500
01:07:23,990 --> 01:07:24,000
significantly faster than your your
 

4501
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,910
significantly faster than your your
maximum function pace

4502
01:07:25,910 --> 01:07:25,920
maximum function pace
 

4503
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:28,710
maximum function pace
so most of the research is going to say

4504
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:28,720
so most of the research is going to say
 

4505
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:29,910
so most of the research is going to say
at some point in time you need to get

4506
01:07:29,910 --> 01:07:29,920
at some point in time you need to get
 

4507
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,589
at some point in time you need to get
around to practicing the pace at which

4508
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:31,599
around to practicing the pace at which
 

4509
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:32,870
around to practicing the pace at which
you're going to perform at

4510
01:07:32,870 --> 01:07:32,880
you're going to perform at
 

4511
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:35,589
you're going to perform at
and really fine-tuning the mechanics the

4512
01:07:35,589 --> 01:07:35,599
and really fine-tuning the mechanics the
 

4513
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:37,270
and really fine-tuning the mechanics the
efficiencies

4514
01:07:37,270 --> 01:07:37,280
efficiencies
 

4515
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:39,750
efficiencies
how it feels how to judge it how to pace

4516
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:39,760
how it feels how to judge it how to pace
 

4517
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:40,950
how it feels how to judge it how to pace
it at the pace

4518
01:07:40,950 --> 01:07:40,960
it at the pace
 

4519
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:42,549
it at the pace
you're going to try to compete at so

4520
01:07:42,549 --> 01:07:42,559
you're going to try to compete at so
 

4521
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:44,150
you're going to try to compete at so
there's obviously like a large range of

4522
01:07:44,150 --> 01:07:44,160
there's obviously like a large range of
 

4523
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,270
there's obviously like a large range of
targets there when we talk about the

4524
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:45,280
targets there when we talk about the
 

4525
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:46,870
targets there when we talk about the
endurance world in general where

4526
01:07:46,870 --> 01:07:46,880
endurance world in general where
 

4527
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:48,150
endurance world in general where
you know you have these shorter events

4528
01:07:48,150 --> 01:07:48,160
you know you have these shorter events
 

4529
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:49,670
you know you have these shorter events
like five kilometers and you also have

4530
01:07:49,670 --> 01:07:49,680
like five kilometers and you also have
 

4531
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:51,430
like five kilometers and you also have
100 mile races which are gonna

4532
01:07:51,430 --> 01:07:51,440
100 mile races which are gonna
 

4533
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:52,950
100 mile races which are gonna
typically be quite a bit below your

4534
01:07:52,950 --> 01:07:52,960
typically be quite a bit below your
 

4535
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:54,870
typically be quite a bit below your
maximum road function and especially on

4536
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:54,880
maximum road function and especially on
 

4537
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,710
maximum road function and especially on
these trailer races i need to admit

4538
01:07:56,710 --> 01:07:56,720
these trailer races i need to admit
 

4539
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:57,589
these trailer races i need to admit
something so i

4540
01:07:57,589 --> 01:07:57,599
something so i
 

4541
01:07:57,599 --> 01:07:59,670
something so i
don't measure the runs at all in terms

4542
01:07:59,670 --> 01:07:59,680
don't measure the runs at all in terms
 

4543
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:01,670
don't measure the runs at all in terms
of uh time

4544
01:08:01,670 --> 01:08:01,680
of uh time
 

4545
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:04,549
of uh time
uh because i get competitive with myself

4546
01:08:04,549 --> 01:08:04,559
uh because i get competitive with myself
 

4547
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:05,029
uh because i get competitive with myself
so i

4548
01:08:05,029 --> 01:08:05,039
so i
 

4549
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:06,789
so i
kind of decided that running for me is

4550
01:08:06,789 --> 01:08:06,799
kind of decided that running for me is
 

4551
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:08,230
kind of decided that running for me is
going to be this thing where i just go

4552
01:08:08,230 --> 01:08:08,240
going to be this thing where i just go
 

4553
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:08,950
going to be this thing where i just go
by feel

4554
01:08:08,950 --> 01:08:08,960
by feel
 

4555
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,910
by feel
is it possible to be that kind of runner

4556
01:08:11,910 --> 01:08:11,920
is it possible to be that kind of runner
 

4557
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:12,309
is it possible to be that kind of runner
and

4558
01:08:12,309 --> 01:08:12,319
and
 

4559
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:13,829
and
you know still have running as part of

4560
01:08:13,829 --> 01:08:13,839
you know still have running as part of
 

4561
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:16,309
you know still have running as part of
your life and be a good performer in

4562
01:08:16,309 --> 01:08:16,319
your life and be a good performer in
 

4563
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:16,870
your life and be a good performer in
running

4564
01:08:16,870 --> 01:08:16,880
running
 

4565
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:18,630
running
i actually think that's that's where you

4566
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:18,640
i actually think that's that's where you
 

4567
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:20,229
i actually think that's that's where you
want to get to

4568
01:08:20,229 --> 01:08:20,239
want to get to
 

4569
01:08:20,239 --> 01:08:21,829
want to get to
the problem is most people have a hard

4570
01:08:21,829 --> 01:08:21,839
the problem is most people have a hard
 

4571
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:24,390
the problem is most people have a hard
time getting to that because they'll go

4572
01:08:24,390 --> 01:08:24,400
time getting to that because they'll go
 

4573
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:24,789
time getting to that because they'll go
out

4574
01:08:24,789 --> 01:08:24,799
out
 

4575
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:26,309
out
and they'll run with a friend and match

4576
01:08:26,309 --> 01:08:26,319
and they'll run with a friend and match
 

4577
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:27,910
and they'll run with a friend and match
their pace or they'll go out and they'll

4578
01:08:27,910 --> 01:08:27,920
their pace or they'll go out and they'll
 

4579
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,510
their pace or they'll go out and they'll
say well i want to run this pace so

4580
01:08:29,510 --> 01:08:29,520
say well i want to run this pace so
 

4581
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,030
say well i want to run this pace so
they'll target that pace

4582
01:08:31,030 --> 01:08:31,040
they'll target that pace
 

4583
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:33,669
they'll target that pace
or target a specific heart rate which is

4584
01:08:33,669 --> 01:08:33,679
or target a specific heart rate which is
 

4585
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:35,990
or target a specific heart rate which is
you know not necessarily how they maybe

4586
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:36,000
you know not necessarily how they maybe
 

4587
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,550
you know not necessarily how they maybe
feel good doing it right so i think like

4588
01:08:38,550 --> 01:08:38,560
feel good doing it right so i think like
 

4589
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:39,110
feel good doing it right so i think like
once you

4590
01:08:39,110 --> 01:08:39,120
once you
 

4591
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:41,030
once you
i mean obviously i think when you put a

4592
01:08:41,030 --> 01:08:41,040
i mean obviously i think when you put a
 

4593
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:42,630
i mean obviously i think when you put a
race on the calendar

4594
01:08:42,630 --> 01:08:42,640
race on the calendar
 

4595
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:44,070
race on the calendar
if your goal is performance it's a

4596
01:08:44,070 --> 01:08:44,080
if your goal is performance it's a
 

4597
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:45,669
if your goal is performance it's a
little harder to just say like well i'm

4598
01:08:45,669 --> 01:08:45,679
little harder to just say like well i'm
 

4599
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:46,709
little harder to just say like well i'm
going to run whatever it feels good

4600
01:08:46,709 --> 01:08:46,719
going to run whatever it feels good
 

4601
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:47,349
going to run whatever it feels good
today

4602
01:08:47,349 --> 01:08:47,359
today
 

4603
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:48,149
today
because eventually you have to get

4604
01:08:48,149 --> 01:08:48,159
because eventually you have to get
 

4605
01:08:48,159 --> 01:08:50,470
because eventually you have to get
around to doing what's specific but from

4606
01:08:50,470 --> 01:08:50,480
around to doing what's specific but from
 

4607
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:51,910
around to doing what's specific but from
just a fitness standpoint health

4608
01:08:51,910 --> 01:08:51,920
just a fitness standpoint health
 

4609
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:53,749
just a fitness standpoint health
standpoint enjoyment standpoint

4610
01:08:53,749 --> 01:08:53,759
standpoint enjoyment standpoint
 

4611
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:55,910
standpoint enjoyment standpoint
um i think it's totally fine to go out

4612
01:08:55,910 --> 01:08:55,920
um i think it's totally fine to go out
 

4613
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,189
um i think it's totally fine to go out
and say i'm gonna run what feels good

4614
01:08:57,189 --> 01:08:57,199
and say i'm gonna run what feels good
 

4615
01:08:57,199 --> 01:08:58,550
and say i'm gonna run what feels good
today and you know maybe someday you

4616
01:08:58,550 --> 01:08:58,560
today and you know maybe someday you
 

4617
01:08:58,560 --> 01:08:59,749
today and you know maybe someday you
will feel like at the end of the run i'm

4618
01:08:59,749 --> 01:08:59,759
will feel like at the end of the run i'm
 

4619
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:01,189
will feel like at the end of the run i'm
gonna do a couple sprints just to get

4620
01:09:01,189 --> 01:09:01,199
gonna do a couple sprints just to get
 

4621
01:09:01,199 --> 01:09:01,590
gonna do a couple sprints just to get
some

4622

a hard one to kind of jump start but
 

4627
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:06,630
a hard one to kind of jump start but
once you do it and you realize how kind

once you do it and you realize how kind
 

4629
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:07,910
once you do it and you realize how kind
of good it feels maybe to throw in a few

of good it feels maybe to throw in a few
 

4631
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:09,349
of good it feels maybe to throw in a few
accelerations at the end of a run and

4632
01:09:09,349 --> 01:09:09,359
accelerations at the end of a run and
 

4633
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:09,669
accelerations at the end of a run and
then

4634
01:09:09,669 --> 01:09:09,679
then
 

4635
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:11,430

accomplished

4640
01:09:13,269 --> 01:09:13,279
accomplished
 

4641
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:14,870
accomplished
that's right that's a forcing function

4642
01:09:14,870 --> 01:09:14,880
that's right that's a forcing function
 

4643
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:16,709
that's right that's a forcing function
but i i like to finish runs with sprints

4644
01:09:16,709 --> 01:09:16,719
but i i like to finish runs with sprints
 

4645
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:17,269
but i i like to finish runs with sprints
anyway

4646

anyway
 

4647
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:18,470
anyway
okay because you're already there

4648
01:09:18,470 --> 01:09:18,480
okay because you're already there
 

4649
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:20,229
okay because you're already there
without right you don't need to the

4650
01:09:20,229 --> 01:09:20,239
without right you don't need to the
 

4651
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:20,709
without right you don't need to the
timing

4652
01:09:20,709 --> 01:09:20,719
timing
 

4653
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:23,189
timing
i'm afraid of the time of becoming a

4654
01:09:23,189 --> 01:09:23,199
i'm afraid of the time of becoming a
 

4655
01:09:23,199 --> 01:09:24,229
i'm afraid of the time of becoming a
drug

drug
 

4657
01:09:24,239 --> 01:09:25,990
drug
but the flip side of that it's a useful

4658
01:09:25,990 --> 01:09:26,000
but the flip side of that it's a useful
 

4659
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,829
but the flip side of that it's a useful
tool to get you to learn the right form

4660
01:09:27,829 --> 01:09:27,839
tool to get you to learn the right form
 

4661
01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:28,630
tool to get you to learn the right form
the right

4662
01:09:28,630 --> 01:09:28,640
the right

be in good shape
 

4667
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:34,149
be in good shape
and then you can throw out the time well

4668
01:09:34,149 --> 01:09:34,159
and then you can throw out the time well
 

4669
01:09:34,159 --> 01:09:35,749
and then you can throw out the time well
i think too with with feel

4670

that's kind of back to that perceived
 

4675
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:39,749
that's kind of back to that perceived

my heart rate
 

4691
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:53,349
my heart rate
and i could go there and just say like

okay i know what that feels like and go
and run that feel

4696
01:09:56,310 --> 01:09:56,320
and run that feel
 

4697
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:58,470
and run that feel
and i'm going to hit that spot like i

4698

like
 

4711
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:07,990
like
noticing the physiological responses

4712
01:10:07,990 --> 01:10:08,000
noticing the physiological responses
 

4713
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,830
noticing the physiological responses
when you cross over versus step a little

4714
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:09,840
when you cross over versus step a little
 

4715
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:10,950
when you cross over versus step a little
bit to below it

bit to below it
 

4717
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:12,550
bit to below it
uh you can get yourself daydreaming and

you know so you do it does take a little

4740
01:10:30,790 --> 01:10:30,800
you know so you do it does take a little
 

4741
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:33,030
you know so you do it does take a little
bit of i think just uh awareness

4742
01:10:33,030 --> 01:10:33,040
bit of i think just uh awareness
 

4743
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:35,750
bit of i think just uh awareness
um but it's also not necessarily

4744
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:35,760
um but it's also not necessarily
 

4745
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:36,870
um but it's also not necessarily
something where

4746
01:10:36,870 --> 01:10:36,880
something where
 

4747
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,229
something where
you have to be so exact that you're

4748
01:10:38,229 --> 01:10:38,239
you have to be so exact that you're
 

4749
01:10:38,239 --> 01:10:40,790
you have to be so exact that you're
hitting you know an exact heart rate

4750
01:10:40,790 --> 01:10:40,800
hitting you know an exact heart rate
 

4751
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,229
hitting you know an exact heart rate
all the time there's usually a range and

4752
01:10:42,229 --> 01:10:42,239
all the time there's usually a range and
 

4753
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:44,149
all the time there's usually a range and
there's even like some fluctuations

4754
01:10:44,149 --> 01:10:44,159
there's even like some fluctuations
 

4755
01:10:44,159 --> 01:10:45,590
there's even like some fluctuations
where like if you've been healthy for a

01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,709
year or two
without any injuries and you've been fit

4760
01:10:48,709 --> 01:10:48,719
without any injuries and you've been fit
 

4761
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:50,470
without any injuries and you've been fit
that you can probably add five beats to

4762
01:10:50,470 --> 01:10:50,480
that you can probably add five beats to
 

4763
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:50,790
that you can probably add five beats to
your

4764
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:50,800
your

maximum rolex function if you're using
 

4767
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:53,510
maximum rolex function if you're using
that as kind of your your target from

4768
01:10:53,510 --> 01:10:53,520
that as kind of your your target from
 

4769
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:55,430
that as kind of your your target from
the 180 minus your age formula

4770
01:10:55,430 --> 01:10:55,440
the 180 minus your age formula
 

4771
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:57,270
the 180 minus your age formula
so let's try this lay this out for

4772
01:10:57,270 --> 01:10:57,280
so let's try this lay this out for

so let's try this lay this out for
yourself but for others

down we actually look at their strengths
 

4835
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:00,870
down we actually look at their strengths
their weaknesses

their weaknesses
 

4837
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:03,350
their weaknesses
and really kind of go in from that

4838
01:12:03,350 --> 01:12:03,360
and really kind of go in from that
 

4839
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:04,630
and really kind of go in from that
perspective

4840
01:12:04,630 --> 01:12:04,640
perspective
 

4841
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:06,950
perspective
and fine-tune it and it also like it

4842
01:12:06,950 --> 01:12:06,960
and fine-tune it and it also like it
 

4843
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:07,990
and fine-tune it and it also like it
avoids a situation

4844
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:08,000
avoids a situation
 

4845
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,110
avoids a situation
where oh my ready-made plan says i'm

4846
01:12:11,110 --> 01:12:11,120
where oh my ready-made plan says i'm
 

4847
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:11,750
where oh my ready-made plan says i'm
supposed to do

4848
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:11,760
supposed to do
 

4849
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,590
supposed to do
this run today but i don't feel great

this run today but i don't feel great
 

4851
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:14,950
this run today but i don't feel great
today so what do i do and then some

4852
01:12:14,950 --> 01:12:14,960
today so what do i do and then some
 

4853
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:15,750
today so what do i do and then some
people are fine with that because

4854
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:15,760
people are fine with that because
 

4855
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:16,390
people are fine with that because
they're

4856
01:12:16,390 --> 01:12:16,400
they're
 

4857
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,550
they're
they're they're aware enough of like the

4858
01:12:18,550 --> 01:12:18,560
they're they're aware enough of like the
 

4859
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:20,070
they're they're aware enough of like the
process that they can

4860
01:12:20,070 --> 01:12:20,080
process that they can
 

4861
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:21,669
process that they can
adjust it themselves other folks just

4862
01:12:21,669 --> 01:12:21,679
adjust it themselves other folks just
 

4863
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:23,590
adjust it themselves other folks just
need a little more support so

4864
01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:23,600
need a little more support so
 

4865
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:24,950
need a little more support so
um that's kind of the difference there

4866
01:12:24,950 --> 01:12:24,960
um that's kind of the difference there
 

4867
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:26,790
um that's kind of the difference there
but in terms of the structure of it

4868
01:12:26,790 --> 01:12:26,800
but in terms of the structure of it
 

4869
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,270
but in terms of the structure of it
it kind of goes with an approach where

4870
01:12:29,270 --> 01:12:29,280
it kind of goes with an approach where
 

4871
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:30,470
it kind of goes with an approach where
we're saying you build this

4872
01:12:30,470 --> 01:12:30,480
we're saying you build this
 

4873
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:32,630
we're saying you build this
foundation you're going to spend you

4874
01:12:32,630 --> 01:12:32,640
foundation you're going to spend you
 

4875
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,390
foundation you're going to spend you
know usually anywhere between 8 to 12

4876
01:12:34,390 --> 01:12:34,400
know usually anywhere between 8 to 12
 

4877
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:36,070
know usually anywhere between 8 to 12
weeks just building up

4878
01:12:36,070 --> 01:12:36,080
weeks just building up
 

4879
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:37,669
weeks just building up
your your aerobic foundation you're

4880
01:12:37,669 --> 01:12:37,679
your your aerobic foundation you're
 

4881
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:38,950
your your aerobic foundation you're
going to be doing a lot of stuff that

4882
01:12:38,950 --> 01:12:38,960
going to be doing a lot of stuff that
 

4883
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:39,430
going to be doing a lot of stuff that
are kind of

4884
01:12:39,430 --> 01:12:39,440
are kind of
 

4885
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:41,669
are kind of
at i call them base runs but they're

4886
01:12:41,669 --> 01:12:41,679
at i call them base runs but they're
 

4887
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:43,189
at i call them base runs but they're
basically your maximum aerobic function

4888
01:12:43,189 --> 01:12:43,199
basically your maximum aerobic function
 

4889
01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:44,630
basically your maximum aerobic function
or you're up to your aerobic threshold

4890
01:12:44,630 --> 01:12:44,640
or you're up to your aerobic threshold
 

4891
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:45,669
or you're up to your aerobic threshold
type stuff

4892
01:12:45,669 --> 01:12:45,679
type stuff
 

4893
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:46,950
type stuff
and they're really going to get really

4894
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:46,960
and they're really going to get really
 

4895
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:48,470
and they're really going to get really
fit with that and once they kind of have

4896
01:12:48,470 --> 01:12:48,480
fit with that and once they kind of have
 

4897
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,550
fit with that and once they kind of have
that foundation laid then it's time to

4898
01:12:50,550 --> 01:12:50,560
that foundation laid then it's time to
 

4899
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:51,830
that foundation laid then it's time to
get into the specifics of whatever

4900
01:12:51,830 --> 01:12:51,840
get into the specifics of whatever
 

4901
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,270
get into the specifics of whatever
distance they're doing

4902
01:12:53,270 --> 01:12:53,280
distance they're doing
 

4903
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:55,270
distance they're doing
so if it where it'll differ we'll be

4904
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:55,280
so if it where it'll differ we'll be
 

4905
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:56,630
so if it where it'll differ we'll be
like if they're doing

4906
01:12:56,630 --> 01:12:56,640
like if they're doing
 

4907
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:57,830
like if they're doing
right now on those plans i think i've

4908
01:12:57,830 --> 01:12:57,840
right now on those plans i think i've
 

4909
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:00,550
right now on those plans i think i've
got 5k half marathon marathon 50k

4910
01:13:00,550 --> 01:13:00,560
got 5k half marathon marathon 50k
 

4911
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:03,270
got 5k half marathon marathon 50k
80 to 100k and then 100 miles so if they

4912
01:13:03,270 --> 01:13:03,280
80 to 100k and then 100 miles so if they
 

4913
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:03,990
80 to 100k and then 100 miles so if they
pick a 5k

4914
01:13:03,990 --> 01:13:04,000
pick a 5k
 

4915
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,510
pick a 5k
plan the order of operations is going to

4916
01:13:05,510 --> 01:13:05,520
plan the order of operations is going to
 

4917
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:06,709
plan the order of operations is going to
be different than if they picked the 100

4918
01:13:06,709 --> 01:13:06,719
be different than if they picked the 100
 

4919
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:07,590
be different than if they picked the 100
mile plan

4920
01:13:07,590 --> 01:13:07,600
mile plan
 

4921
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,830
mile plan
you're going to see some of the same

4922
01:13:09,830 --> 01:13:09,840
you're going to see some of the same
 

4923
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:11,350
you're going to see some of the same
workouts show up in that plan it's just

4924
01:13:11,350 --> 01:13:11,360
workouts show up in that plan it's just
 

4925
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:12,070
workouts show up in that plan it's just
going to be different

4926
01:13:12,070 --> 01:13:12,080
going to be different
 

4927
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:15,430
going to be different
areas of it so once they're really fit

4928
01:13:15,430 --> 01:13:15,440
areas of it so once they're really fit
 

4929
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:18,709
areas of it so once they're really fit
at that you know that foundational level

4930
01:13:18,709 --> 01:13:18,719
at that you know that foundational level
 

4931
01:13:18,719 --> 01:13:20,310
at that you know that foundational level
then you know if they're doing say a

4932
01:13:20,310 --> 01:13:20,320
then you know if they're doing say a
 

4933
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:21,830
then you know if they're doing say a
hundred mile plan they might start doing

4934
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:21,840
hundred mile plan they might start doing
 

4935
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,750
hundred mile plan they might start doing
some short intervals which i would

4936
01:13:23,750 --> 01:13:23,760
some short intervals which i would
 

4937
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,830
some short intervals which i would
on my plans i usually range between 30

4938
01:13:25,830 --> 01:13:25,840
on my plans i usually range between 30
 

4939
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:27,270
on my plans i usually range between 30
seconds up to four minutes it's kind of

4940
01:13:27,270 --> 01:13:27,280
seconds up to four minutes it's kind of
 

4941
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:28,950
seconds up to four minutes it's kind of
that short interval range

4942
01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:28,960
that short interval range
 

4943
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:30,310
that short interval range
can you describe what you mean by short

4944
01:13:30,310 --> 01:13:30,320
can you describe what you mean by short
 

4945
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:32,070
can you describe what you mean by short
intervals it's like a sprint

4946
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:32,080
intervals it's like a sprint
 

4947
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:35,669
intervals it's like a sprint
and a rest yeah yeah so i'll use

4948
01:13:35,669 --> 01:13:35,679
and a rest yeah yeah so i'll use
 

4949
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:37,750
and a rest yeah yeah so i'll use
basically like i'll use like a basically

4950
01:13:37,750 --> 01:13:37,760
basically like i'll use like a basically
 

4951
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:39,590
basically like i'll use like a basically
a 12-minute time trial

4952
01:13:39,590 --> 01:13:39,600
a 12-minute time trial
 

4953
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:41,350
a 12-minute time trial
and that's going to kind of like dictate

4954
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:41,360
and that's going to kind of like dictate
 

4955
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:43,110
and that's going to kind of like dictate
for them what the intensity and the pace

4956
01:13:43,110 --> 01:13:43,120
for them what the intensity and the pace
 

4957
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:44,709
for them what the intensity and the pace
is going to be for some of those

4958
01:13:44,709 --> 01:13:44,719
is going to be for some of those
 

4959
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:46,550
is going to be for some of those
when they're under a minute they'll push

4960
01:13:46,550 --> 01:13:46,560
when they're under a minute they'll push
 

4961
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:47,830
when they're under a minute they'll push
past that a little bit

4962
01:13:47,830 --> 01:13:47,840
past that a little bit
 

4963
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,590
past that a little bit
um but usually when we're up to like

4964
01:13:49,590 --> 01:13:49,600
um but usually when we're up to like
 

4965
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,270
um but usually when we're up to like
above a minute and certainly up to four

4966
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:51,280
above a minute and certainly up to four
 

4967
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:51,669
above a minute and certainly up to four
minutes

4968
01:13:51,669 --> 01:13:51,679
minutes
 

4969
01:13:51,679 --> 01:13:53,990
minutes
like whatever pace or intensity that

4970
01:13:53,990 --> 01:13:54,000
like whatever pace or intensity that
 

4971
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,669
like whatever pace or intensity that
they get for that kind of 12-minute time

4972
01:13:55,669 --> 01:13:55,679
they get for that kind of 12-minute time
 

4973
01:13:55,679 --> 01:13:57,270
they get for that kind of 12-minute time
trial where they're just seeing how far

4974
01:13:57,270 --> 01:13:57,280
trial where they're just seeing how far
 

4975
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:58,950
trial where they're just seeing how far
they can go in 12 minutes

4976
01:13:58,950 --> 01:13:58,960
they can go in 12 minutes
 

4977
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:01,910
they can go in 12 minutes
is gonna be um kind of like about where

4978
01:14:01,910 --> 01:14:01,920
is gonna be um kind of like about where
 

4979
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:03,270
is gonna be um kind of like about where
they're gonna target for those intervals

4980
01:14:03,270 --> 01:14:03,280
they're gonna target for those intervals
 

4981
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:04,470
they're gonna target for those intervals
so then those intervals are gonna be

4982
01:14:04,470 --> 01:14:04,480
so then those intervals are gonna be
 

4983
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:05,189
so then those intervals are gonna be
structured

4984
01:14:05,189 --> 01:14:05,199
structured
 

4985
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:06,390
structured
let's say they're doing two minute

4986
01:14:06,390 --> 01:14:06,400
let's say they're doing two minute
 

4987
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,149
let's say they're doing two minute
intervals they're gonna do two minutes

4988
01:14:08,149 --> 01:14:08,159
intervals they're gonna do two minutes
 

4989
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:08,790
intervals they're gonna do two minutes
at that

4990
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:08,800
at that
 

4991
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,149
at that
intensity that they could do for 12

4992
01:14:10,149 --> 01:14:10,159
intensity that they could do for 12
 

4993
01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:11,669
intensity that they could do for 12
minutes at a time trial then they're

4994
01:14:11,669 --> 01:14:11,679
minutes at a time trial then they're
 

4995
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:12,550
minutes at a time trial then they're
gonna do a two-minute

4996
01:14:12,550 --> 01:14:12,560
gonna do a two-minute
 

4997
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:14,390
gonna do a two-minute
real easy job or maybe even walk just to

4998
01:14:14,390 --> 01:14:14,400
real easy job or maybe even walk just to
 

4999
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:15,910
real easy job or maybe even walk just to
kind of bounce back and they're gonna

5000
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:15,920
kind of bounce back and they're gonna
 

5001
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:17,350
kind of bounce back and they're gonna
repeat it how do you figure out

5002
01:14:17,350 --> 01:14:17,360
repeat it how do you figure out
 

5003
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:19,750
repeat it how do you figure out
uh how far you can go in 12 minutes is

5004
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:19,760
uh how far you can go in 12 minutes is
 

5005
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:21,590
uh how far you can go in 12 minutes is
that just a trial and error you build up

5006
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:21,600
that just a trial and error you build up
 

5007
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,270
that just a trial and error you build up
to it there's formulas what

5008
01:14:23,270 --> 01:14:23,280
to it there's formulas what
 

5009
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:24,870
to it there's formulas what
yeah there's some newer formulas that

5010
01:14:24,870 --> 01:14:24,880
yeah there's some newer formulas that
 

5011
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:26,630
yeah there's some newer formulas that
are probably a little less uh

5012
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:26,640
are probably a little less uh
 

5013
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:30,709
are probably a little less uh
um brutal uh where you kind of

5014
01:14:30,709 --> 01:14:30,719
um brutal uh where you kind of
 

5015
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:33,270
um brutal uh where you kind of
uh i haven't really dove into these that

5016
01:14:33,270 --> 01:14:33,280
uh i haven't really dove into these that
 

5017
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:35,990
uh i haven't really dove into these that
that in depth yet i know like um

5018
01:14:35,990 --> 01:14:36,000
that in depth yet i know like um
 

5019
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,990
that in depth yet i know like um
that you can kind of replicate it by

5020
01:14:37,990 --> 01:14:38,000
that you can kind of replicate it by
 

5021
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,990
that you can kind of replicate it by
doing like a short a very short interval

5022
01:14:39,990 --> 01:14:40,000
doing like a short a very short interval
 

5023
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,709
doing like a short a very short interval
and then a slightly longer one um

5024
01:14:42,709 --> 01:14:42,719
and then a slightly longer one um
 

5025
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:44,390
and then a slightly longer one um
and then like another one where like at

5026
01:14:44,390 --> 01:14:44,400
and then like another one where like at
 

5027
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:45,910
and then like another one where like at
the end when that last one will kind of

5028
01:14:45,910 --> 01:14:45,920
the end when that last one will kind of
 

5029
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:47,350
the end when that last one will kind of
indicate what it is

5030
01:14:47,350 --> 01:14:47,360
indicate what it is
 

5031
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,110
indicate what it is
uh and so you're doing less of it to get

5032
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:49,120
uh and so you're doing less of it to get
 

5033
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:51,189
uh and so you're doing less of it to get
the same answer to the question

5034
01:14:51,189 --> 01:14:51,199
the same answer to the question
 

5035
01:14:51,199 --> 01:14:53,189
the same answer to the question
but sometimes i think when it's someone

5036
01:14:53,189 --> 01:14:53,199
but sometimes i think when it's someone
 

5037
01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:54,630
but sometimes i think when it's someone
who's new

5038
01:14:54,630 --> 01:14:54,640
who's new
 

5039
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,470
who's new
i'd rather them just do a 12-minute time

5040
01:14:56,470 --> 01:14:56,480
i'd rather them just do a 12-minute time
 

5041
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:57,750
i'd rather them just do a 12-minute time
trial because

5042
01:14:57,750 --> 01:14:57,760
trial because
 

5043
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:00,070
trial because
it's easy for them to execute in the

5044
01:15:00,070 --> 01:15:00,080
it's easy for them to execute in the
 

5045
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:01,830
it's easy for them to execute in the
sense that it's pretty clear you do a

5046
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:01,840
sense that it's pretty clear you do a
 

5047
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:03,430
sense that it's pretty clear you do a
warm-up you do some strides maybe some

5048
01:15:03,430 --> 01:15:03,440
warm-up you do some strides maybe some
 

5049
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:05,350
warm-up you do some strides maybe some
dynamic stretches then you just run

5050
01:15:05,350 --> 01:15:05,360
dynamic stretches then you just run
 

5051
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:06,790
dynamic stretches then you just run
as hard as you can for 12 minutes as

5052
01:15:06,790 --> 01:15:06,800
as hard as you can for 12 minutes as
 

5053
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:08,550
as hard as you can for 12 minutes as
evenly paced as you can manage

5054
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:08,560
evenly paced as you can manage
 

5055
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:11,510
evenly paced as you can manage
and i mean if the if it's going to

5056
01:15:11,510 --> 01:15:11,520
and i mean if the if it's going to
 

5057
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:14,550
and i mean if the if it's going to
produce the data i'm looking for

5058
01:15:14,550 --> 01:15:14,560
produce the data i'm looking for
 

5059
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:17,189
produce the data i'm looking for
uh no matter what happens it'll produce

5060
01:15:17,189 --> 01:15:17,199
uh no matter what happens it'll produce
 

5061
01:15:17,199 --> 01:15:17,750
uh no matter what happens it'll produce
the data

5062
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:17,760
the data
 

5063
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:20,229
the data
yeah i mean you can you can screw it up

5064
01:15:20,229 --> 01:15:20,239
yeah i mean you can you can screw it up
 

5065
01:15:20,239 --> 01:15:21,750
yeah i mean you can you can screw it up
i guess you can go way too fast then you

5066
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:21,760
i guess you can go way too fast then you
 

5067
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,110
i guess you can go way too fast then you
have this scenario where like oh it

5068
01:15:23,110 --> 01:15:23,120
have this scenario where like oh it
 

5069
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:23,990
have this scenario where like oh it
looks like you're

5070
01:15:23,990 --> 01:15:24,000
looks like you're
 

5071
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,110
looks like you're
you know your first two minutes were

5072
01:15:25,110 --> 01:15:25,120
you know your first two minutes were
 

5073
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:26,310
you know your first two minutes were
drastically faster than your last two

5074
01:15:26,310 --> 01:15:26,320
drastically faster than your last two
 

5075
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:27,350
drastically faster than your last two
and then it's like we

5076
01:15:27,350 --> 01:15:27,360
and then it's like we
 

5077
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,910
and then it's like we
maybe screwed that one up but um but i

5078
01:15:29,910 --> 01:15:29,920
maybe screwed that one up but um but i
 

5079
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:31,669
maybe screwed that one up but um but i
mean really like you don't even need to

5080
01:15:31,669 --> 01:15:31,679
mean really like you don't even need to
 

5081
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:33,510
mean really like you don't even need to
do the time trial technically

5082
01:15:33,510 --> 01:15:33,520
do the time trial technically
 

5083
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:36,550
do the time trial technically
um a lot of times you can go off of feel

5084
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:36,560
um a lot of times you can go off of feel
 

5085
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:38,470
um a lot of times you can go off of feel
like what we described with um

5086
01:15:38,470 --> 01:15:38,480
like what we described with um
 

5087
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:41,910
like what we described with um
the threshold stuff and and you know

5088
01:15:41,910 --> 01:15:41,920
the threshold stuff and and you know
 

5089
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:45,270
the threshold stuff and and you know
it's a high enough intensity where where

5090
01:15:45,270 --> 01:15:45,280
it's a high enough intensity where where
 

5091
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:47,910
it's a high enough intensity where where
like you can start to kind of like your

5092
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:47,920
like you can start to kind of like your
 

5093
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,270
like you can start to kind of like your
body is going to kind of limit you to a

5094
01:15:49,270 --> 01:15:49,280
body is going to kind of limit you to a
 

5095
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:50,630
body is going to kind of limit you to a
degree where

5096
01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:50,640
degree where
 

5097
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:52,070
degree where
if i just said we didn't do the time

5098
01:15:52,070 --> 01:15:52,080
if i just said we didn't do the time
 

5099
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,270
if i just said we didn't do the time
trial and just started doing the

5100
01:15:53,270 --> 01:15:53,280
trial and just started doing the
 

5101
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:53,910
trial and just started doing the
intervals

5102
01:15:53,910 --> 01:15:53,920
intervals
 

5103
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:56,630
intervals
we could figure out that you know if

5104
01:15:56,630 --> 01:15:56,640
we could figure out that you know if
 

5105
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:57,910
we could figure out that you know if
they're doing them right or not

5106
01:15:57,910 --> 01:15:57,920
they're doing them right or not
 

5107
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:59,430
they're doing them right or not
if we see a scenario where oh it looks

5108
01:15:59,430 --> 01:15:59,440
if we see a scenario where oh it looks
 

5109
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:00,709
if we see a scenario where oh it looks
like these first two intervals were

5110
01:16:00,709 --> 01:16:00,719
like these first two intervals were
 

5111
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:02,709
like these first two intervals were
significantly slower than the last two

5112
01:16:02,709 --> 01:16:02,719
significantly slower than the last two
 

5113
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:04,470
significantly slower than the last two
chances are we're still not quite dialed

5114
01:16:04,470 --> 01:16:04,480
chances are we're still not quite dialed
 

5115
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:06,149
chances are we're still not quite dialed
in in terms of what the intensity is

5116
01:16:06,149 --> 01:16:06,159
in in terms of what the intensity is
 

5117
01:16:06,159 --> 01:16:07,430
in in terms of what the intensity is
that you should be targeting for those

5118
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:07,440
that you should be targeting for those
 

5119
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,669
that you should be targeting for those
and as you do a few you just get to know

5120
01:16:09,669 --> 01:16:09,679
and as you do a few you just get to know
 

5121
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:11,510
and as you do a few you just get to know
the pacing of it a little better and

5122
01:16:11,510 --> 01:16:11,520
the pacing of it a little better and
 

5123
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:13,030
the pacing of it a little better and
then you start seeing more even splits

5124
01:16:13,030 --> 01:16:13,040
then you start seeing more even splits
 

5125
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:14,229
then you start seeing more even splits
so like you know their first two minute

5126
01:16:14,229 --> 01:16:14,239
so like you know their first two minute
 

5127
01:16:14,239 --> 01:16:15,669
so like you know their first two minute
intervals pretty close within a couple

5128
01:16:15,669 --> 01:16:15,679
intervals pretty close within a couple
 

5129
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:17,030
intervals pretty close within a couple
seconds of their second or

5130
01:16:17,030 --> 01:16:17,040
seconds of their second or
 

5131
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:18,070
seconds of their second or
you know i guess we'd be looking at

5132
01:16:18,070 --> 01:16:18,080
you know i guess we'd be looking at
 

5133
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:19,910
you know i guess we'd be looking at
distance if we're doing time so like you

5134
01:16:19,910 --> 01:16:19,920
distance if we're doing time so like you
 

5135
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:20,390
distance if we're doing time so like you
went

5136
01:16:20,390 --> 01:16:20,400
went
 

5137
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:21,910
went
approximately the same distance on that

5138
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:21,920
approximately the same distance on that
 

5139
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,750
approximately the same distance on that
last one as you did the first one

5140
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:23,760
last one as you did the first one
 

5141
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:24,709
last one as you did the first one
and then we're just looking for

5142
01:16:24,709 --> 01:16:24,719
and then we're just looking for
 

5143
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:26,709
and then we're just looking for
improvement over time so you know we

5144
01:16:26,709 --> 01:16:26,719
improvement over time so you know we
 

5145
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:27,910
improvement over time so you know we
might spend

5146
01:16:27,910 --> 01:16:27,920
might spend
 

5147
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:29,830
might spend
four six weeks kind of focusing on

5148
01:16:29,830 --> 01:16:29,840
four six weeks kind of focusing on
 

5149
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:30,950
four six weeks kind of focusing on
improving that

5150
01:16:30,950 --> 01:16:30,960
improving that
 

5151
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:32,709
improving that
we're going to still include kind of

5152
01:16:32,709 --> 01:16:32,719
we're going to still include kind of
 

5153
01:16:32,719 --> 01:16:34,550
we're going to still include kind of
foundational running volume where you're

5154
01:16:34,550 --> 01:16:34,560
foundational running volume where you're
 

5155
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:35,990
foundational running volume where you're
gonna be running like an easy pace an

5156
01:16:35,990 --> 01:16:36,000
gonna be running like an easy pace an
 

5157
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,669
gonna be running like an easy pace an
enjoyable pace kind of in the interim

5158
01:16:37,669 --> 01:16:37,679
enjoyable pace kind of in the interim
 

5159
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:39,590
enjoyable pace kind of in the interim
and then there's gonna be some rest days

5160
01:16:39,590 --> 01:16:39,600
and then there's gonna be some rest days
 

5161
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:40,870
and then there's gonna be some rest days
and that's gonna be where the levels

5162
01:16:40,870 --> 01:16:40,880
and that's gonna be where the levels
 

5163
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:41,350
and that's gonna be where the levels
come in

5164
01:16:41,350 --> 01:16:41,360
come in
 

5165
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:42,870
come in
my like level one plans are gonna be

5166
01:16:42,870 --> 01:16:42,880
my like level one plans are gonna be
 

5167
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:44,390
my like level one plans are gonna be
like four day a week training plans

5168
01:16:44,390 --> 01:16:44,400
like four day a week training plans
 

5169
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,470
like four day a week training plans
level two are gonna be five day level

5170
01:16:46,470 --> 01:16:46,480
level two are gonna be five day level
 

5171
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:48,149
level two are gonna be five day level
three are gonna be six day with one day

5172
01:16:48,149 --> 01:16:48,159
three are gonna be six day with one day
 

5173
01:16:48,159 --> 01:16:48,870
three are gonna be six day with one day
off

5174
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:48,880
off
 

5175
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:50,870
off
um and you can obviously operate outside

5176
01:16:50,870 --> 01:16:50,880
um and you can obviously operate outside
 

5177
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:52,550
um and you can obviously operate outside
of those those those are just the ones

5178
01:16:52,550 --> 01:16:52,560
of those those those are just the ones
 

5179
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:53,669
of those those those are just the ones
that i put up for the ready made when

5180
01:16:53,669 --> 01:16:53,679
that i put up for the ready made when
 

5181
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:55,110
that i put up for the ready made when
i'm coaching people kind of personalize

5182
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:55,120
i'm coaching people kind of personalize
 

5183
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:56,709
i'm coaching people kind of personalize
we just we look at like what their

5184
01:16:56,709 --> 01:16:56,719
we just we look at like what their
 

5185
01:16:56,719 --> 01:16:58,709
we just we look at like what their
history is with running their schedule

5186
01:16:58,709 --> 01:16:58,719
history is with running their schedule
 

5187
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:00,310
history is with running their schedule
all sorts of stuff because

5188
01:17:00,310 --> 01:17:00,320
all sorts of stuff because
 

5189
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:01,750
all sorts of stuff because
oftentimes people get hung up on like

5190
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:01,760
oftentimes people get hung up on like
 

5191
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:03,110
oftentimes people get hung up on like
well what are the elites doing what are

5192
01:17:03,110 --> 01:17:03,120
well what are the elites doing what are
 

5193
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:03,990
well what are the elites doing what are
the professionals doing what are the

5194
01:17:03,990 --> 01:17:04,000
the professionals doing what are the
 

5195
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,669
the professionals doing what are the
olympians doing it's like well

5196
01:17:05,669 --> 01:17:05,679
olympians doing it's like well
 

5197
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:07,270
olympians doing it's like well
it's like what the olympians are doing

5198
01:17:07,270 --> 01:17:07,280
it's like what the olympians are doing
 

5199
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:08,550
it's like what the olympians are doing
is they're waking up and they're living

5200
01:17:08,550 --> 01:17:08,560
is they're waking up and they're living
 

5201
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:09,270
is they're waking up and they're living
and breathing

5202
01:17:09,270 --> 01:17:09,280
and breathing
 

5203
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:11,110
and breathing
everything around this one race that

5204
01:17:11,110 --> 01:17:11,120
everything around this one race that
 

5205
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:13,430
everything around this one race that
they're gonna do in four years or

5206
01:17:13,430 --> 01:17:13,440
they're gonna do in four years or
 

5207
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:14,709
they're gonna do in four years or
so it's like we need to step away from

5208
01:17:14,709 --> 01:17:14,719
so it's like we need to step away from
 

5209
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:16,149
so it's like we need to step away from
that if you're working you know 10 hours

5210
01:17:16,149 --> 01:17:16,159
that if you're working you know 10 hours
 

5211
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:17,590
that if you're working you know 10 hours
a day and you've got kids and all this

5212
01:17:17,590 --> 01:17:17,600
a day and you've got kids and all this
 

5213
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:18,390
a day and you've got kids and all this
other stuff too

5214
01:17:18,390 --> 01:17:18,400
other stuff too
 

5215
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:21,110
other stuff too
so um there's a lot of variables that

5216
01:17:21,110 --> 01:17:21,120
so um there's a lot of variables that
 

5217
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:22,229
so um there's a lot of variables that
make it more interesting to coach

5218
01:17:22,229 --> 01:17:22,239
make it more interesting to coach
 

5219
01:17:22,239 --> 01:17:23,510
make it more interesting to coach
someone who's actually like

5220
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:23,520
someone who's actually like
 

5221
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:26,070
someone who's actually like
not an elite athlete or someone who's a

5222
01:17:26,070 --> 01:17:26,080
not an elite athlete or someone who's a
 

5223
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:28,950
not an elite athlete or someone who's a
professional athlete i should say

5224
01:17:28,950 --> 01:17:28,960
professional athlete i should say
 

5225
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:30,709
professional athlete i should say
the but but yeah so they're gonna do

5226
01:17:30,709 --> 01:17:30,719
the but but yeah so they're gonna do
 

5227
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:33,590
the but but yeah so they're gonna do
that stuff those those shorter intervals

5228
01:17:33,590 --> 01:17:33,600
that stuff those those shorter intervals
 

5229
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:36,550
that stuff those those shorter intervals
um for probably about like four to six

5230
01:17:36,550 --> 01:17:36,560
um for probably about like four to six
 

5231
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:37,350
um for probably about like four to six
weeks if they're doing

5232
01:17:37,350 --> 01:17:37,360
weeks if they're doing
 

5233
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:39,189
weeks if they're doing
if they're doing a longer race like 100

5234
01:17:39,189 --> 01:17:39,199
if they're doing a longer race like 100
 

5235
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:41,110
if they're doing a longer race like 100
miles if they were doing say a 5k

5236
01:17:41,110 --> 01:17:41,120
miles if they were doing say a 5k
 

5237
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:42,709
miles if they were doing say a 5k
we'd start bringing those workouts in

5238
01:17:42,709 --> 01:17:42,719
we'd start bringing those workouts in
 

5239
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:43,590
we'd start bringing those workouts in
near the end of their plan because

5240
01:17:43,590 --> 01:17:43,600
near the end of their plan because
 

5241
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:44,870
near the end of their plan because
that's gonna be specific to their race

5242
01:17:44,870 --> 01:17:44,880
that's gonna be specific to their race
 

5243
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:45,430
that's gonna be specific to their race
pace

5244
01:17:45,430 --> 01:17:45,440
pace
 

5245
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:46,790
pace
that's gonna be the intensity that maybe

5246
01:17:46,790 --> 01:17:46,800
that's gonna be the intensity that maybe
 

5247
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,950
that's gonna be the intensity that maybe
they're doing for you know like a 3k or

5248

5k or something like that so it's going

5260
01:17:59,189 --> 01:17:59,199
and least specific stuff early and then
 

5261
01:17:59,199 --> 01:18:00,310
and least specific stuff early and then
we start phasing

5262
01:18:00,310 --> 01:18:00,320
we start phasing
 

5263
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:03,669
we start phasing
closer to most specific stuff

01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:57,910
length there is heart rate can get messy
the longer you go so

5566
01:22:57,910 --> 01:22:57,920
the longer you go so
 

5567
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:00,550
the longer you go so
i i end up kind of maybe stepping away

5568
01:23:00,550 --> 01:23:00,560
i i end up kind of maybe stepping away
 

5569
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:02,070
i i end up kind of maybe stepping away
from heart rate a little more

5570
01:23:02,070 --> 01:23:02,080
from heart rate a little more
 

5571
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:04,470
from heart rate a little more
than some will at a certain point

5572
01:23:04,470 --> 01:23:04,480
than some will at a certain point
 

5573
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:06,070
than some will at a certain point
because i'm ultimately i'm going to be

5574
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:06,080
because i'm ultimately i'm going to be
 

5575
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:07,590
because i'm ultimately i'm going to be
usually training or working with someone

5576
01:23:07,590 --> 01:23:07,600
usually training or working with someone
 

5577
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:09,110
usually training or working with someone
to run like you know a race that's

5578
01:23:09,110 --> 01:23:09,120
to run like you know a race that's
 

5579
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:10,790
to run like you know a race that's
really long and they have cardiac drift

5580
01:23:10,790 --> 01:23:10,800
really long and they have cardiac drift
 

5581
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:11,830
really long and they have cardiac drift
dehydration

5582
01:23:11,830 --> 01:23:11,840
dehydration
 

5583
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:13,669
dehydration
heat and things that are gonna make the

5584
01:23:13,669 --> 01:23:13,679
heat and things that are gonna make the
 

5585
01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:14,950
heat and things that are gonna make the
heart rate super messy

5586
01:23:14,950 --> 01:23:14,960
heart rate super messy
 

5587
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:17,510
heart rate super messy
yeah but you're probably your ability to

5588
01:23:17,510 --> 01:23:17,520
yeah but you're probably your ability to
 

5589
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:18,870
yeah but you're probably your ability to
measure perceived effort is

5590
01:23:18,870 --> 01:23:18,880
measure perceived effort is
 

5591
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:19,750
measure perceived effort is
exceptionally good

5592
01:23:19,750 --> 01:23:19,760
exceptionally good
 

5593
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:21,510
exceptionally good
mine is actually really weak okay heart

5594
01:23:21,510 --> 01:23:21,520
mine is actually really weak okay heart
 

5595
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:23,110
mine is actually really weak okay heart
rate then i need to do this still the

5596
01:23:23,110 --> 01:23:23,120
rate then i need to do this still the
 

5597
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:24,629
rate then i need to do this still the
work of connecting heart rate to the

5598
01:23:24,629 --> 01:23:24,639
work of connecting heart rate to the
 

5599
01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:25,590
work of connecting heart rate to the
perceived effort

5600
01:23:25,590 --> 01:23:25,600
perceived effort
 

5601
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:27,270
perceived effort
yep and that's exactly what i would use

5602
01:23:27,270 --> 01:23:27,280
yep and that's exactly what i would use
 

5603
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:28,870
yep and that's exactly what i would use
heart rate for then and you'll get to a

5604
01:23:28,870 --> 01:23:28,880
heart rate for then and you'll get to a
 

5605
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:29,350
heart rate for then and you'll get to a
point

5606
01:23:29,350 --> 01:23:29,360
point
 

5607
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:31,270
point
probably by like in the first couple

5608
01:23:31,270 --> 01:23:31,280
probably by like in the first couple
 

5609
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:32,390
probably by like in the first couple
months where

5610
01:23:32,390 --> 01:23:32,400
months where
 

5611
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:34,790
months where
you you can still lean on heart rate if

5612
01:23:34,790 --> 01:23:34,800
you you can still lean on heart rate if
 

5613
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:36,550
you you can still lean on heart rate if
you want but it'll be kind of one of

5614
01:23:36,550 --> 01:23:36,560
you want but it'll be kind of one of
 

5615
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:37,430
you want but it'll be kind of one of
those things where you

5616
01:23:37,430 --> 01:23:37,440
those things where you
 

5617
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:39,189
those things where you
you keep looking at you're like oh wow i

5618
01:23:39,189 --> 01:23:39,199
you keep looking at you're like oh wow i
 

5619
01:23:39,199 --> 01:23:40,709
you keep looking at you're like oh wow i
can guess it you play a game with

5620
01:23:40,709 --> 01:23:40,719
can guess it you play a game with
 

5621
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:41,990
can guess it you play a game with
yourself too you can say well how close

5622
01:23:41,990 --> 01:23:42,000
yourself too you can say well how close
 

5623
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:42,870
yourself too you can say well how close
can i guess

5624
01:23:42,870 --> 01:23:42,880
can i guess
 

5625
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:44,790
can i guess
yeah you'll get it so like for me what

5626
01:23:44,790 --> 01:23:44,800
yeah you'll get it so like for me what
 

5627
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:46,470
yeah you'll get it so like for me what
i'll do is i'll go i'll do the run and

5628
01:23:46,470 --> 01:23:46,480
i'll do is i'll go i'll do the run and
 

5629
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:47,350
i'll do is i'll go i'll do the run and
then i'll look at the heart rate

5630
01:23:47,350 --> 01:23:47,360
then i'll look at the heart rate
 

5631
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:48,709
then i'll look at the heart rate
afterwards and be like oh cool i was

5632
01:23:48,709 --> 01:23:48,719
afterwards and be like oh cool i was
 

5633
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:50,229
afterwards and be like oh cool i was
right there yeah or i remember

5634
01:23:50,229 --> 01:23:50,239
right there yeah or i remember
 

5635
01:23:50,239 --> 01:23:51,510
right there yeah or i remember
feeling like i was speeding up a little

5636
01:23:51,510 --> 01:23:51,520
feeling like i was speeding up a little
 

5637
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:52,709
feeling like i was speeding up a little
bit there and there are shows right

5638
01:23:52,709 --> 01:23:52,719
bit there and there are shows right
 

5639
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:55,030
bit there and there are shows right
there on the heart rate

5640
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:55,040
there on the heart rate
 

5641
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:57,189
there on the heart rate
i also love sort of something we haven't

5642
01:23:57,189 --> 01:23:57,199
i also love sort of something we haven't
 

5643
01:23:57,199 --> 01:23:58,470
i also love sort of something we haven't
talked about i love push-ups and

5644
01:23:58,470 --> 01:23:58,480
talked about i love push-ups and
 

5645
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:00,070
talked about i love push-ups and
pull-ups so like body weight

5646
01:24:00,070 --> 01:24:00,080
pull-ups so like body weight
 

5647
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:02,870
pull-ups so like body weight
workouts again it's mostly mental i just

5648
01:24:02,870 --> 01:24:02,880
workouts again it's mostly mental i just
 

5649
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:04,629
workouts again it's mostly mental i just
enjoy the mental challenge of it i also

5650
01:24:04,629 --> 01:24:04,639
enjoy the mental challenge of it i also
 

5651
01:24:04,639 --> 01:24:05,669
enjoy the mental challenge of it i also
like

5652
01:24:05,669 --> 01:24:05,679
like
 

5653
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:07,590
like
it makes me feel like if all i'm doing

5654
01:24:07,590 --> 01:24:07,600
it makes me feel like if all i'm doing
 

5655
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:09,669
it makes me feel like if all i'm doing
is running it makes me feel i'm

5656
01:24:09,669 --> 01:24:09,679
is running it makes me feel i'm
 

5657
01:24:09,679 --> 01:24:12,790
is running it makes me feel i'm
not like uh one-dimensional

5658
01:24:12,790 --> 01:24:12,800
not like uh one-dimensional
 

5659
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:14,870
not like uh one-dimensional
yeah one-dimensional i mean there's some

5660
01:24:14,870 --> 01:24:14,880
yeah one-dimensional i mean there's some
 

5661
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:15,990
yeah one-dimensional i mean there's some
aspect to running

5662
01:24:15,990 --> 01:24:16,000
aspect to running
 

5663
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,790
aspect to running
that's not to be like hippy about it but

5664
01:24:18,790 --> 01:24:18,800
that's not to be like hippy about it but
 

5665
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:20,310
that's not to be like hippy about it but
like you know you're it's you're with

5666
01:24:20,310 --> 01:24:20,320
like you know you're it's you're with
 

5667
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:21,510
like you know you're it's you're with
nature you're running

5668
01:24:21,510 --> 01:24:21,520
nature you're running
 

5669
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:24,070
nature you're running
in it's like we're born to do this thing

5670
01:24:24,070 --> 01:24:24,080
in it's like we're born to do this thing
 

5671
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:25,430
in it's like we're born to do this thing
in that same way i feel like when i'm

5672
01:24:25,430 --> 01:24:25,440
in that same way i feel like when i'm
 

5673
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:27,510
in that same way i feel like when i'm
doing push-ups and pull-ups

5674
01:24:27,510 --> 01:24:27,520
doing push-ups and pull-ups
 

5675
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,189
doing push-ups and pull-ups
i feel like i was born to do that kind

5676
01:24:29,189 --> 01:24:29,199
i feel like i was born to do that kind
 

5677
01:24:29,199 --> 01:24:31,270
i feel like i was born to do that kind
of stuff like it's like this

5678
01:24:31,270 --> 01:24:31,280
of stuff like it's like this
 

5679
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:33,510
of stuff like it's like this
body weight exercises have that way

5680
01:24:33,510 --> 01:24:33,520
body weight exercises have that way
 

5681
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:34,310
body weight exercises have that way
about them

5682
01:24:34,310 --> 01:24:34,320
about them
 

5683
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:36,390
about them
it's it doesn't have that dumbbell feel

5684
01:24:36,390 --> 01:24:36,400
it's it doesn't have that dumbbell feel
 

5685
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:38,950
it's it doesn't have that dumbbell feel
or doing bench press or squats

5686
01:24:38,950 --> 01:24:38,960
or doing bench press or squats
 

5687
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:40,709
or doing bench press or squats
squats with weight when you're just

5688
01:24:40,709 --> 01:24:40,719
squats with weight when you're just
 

5689
01:24:40,719 --> 01:24:42,390
squats with weight when you're just
doing squats

5690
01:24:42,390 --> 01:24:42,400
doing squats
 

5691
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:44,229
doing squats
uh body weight when doing push-ups and

5692
01:24:44,229 --> 01:24:44,239
uh body weight when doing push-ups and
 

5693
01:24:44,239 --> 01:24:45,510
uh body weight when doing push-ups and
pull-ups body weight

5694
01:24:45,510 --> 01:24:45,520
pull-ups body weight
 

5695
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:48,229
pull-ups body weight
and just basic ab stuff core stuff body

5696
01:24:48,229 --> 01:24:48,239
and just basic ab stuff core stuff body
 

5697
01:24:48,239 --> 01:24:49,189
and just basic ab stuff core stuff body
weight

5698
01:24:49,189 --> 01:24:49,199
weight
 

5699
01:24:49,199 --> 01:24:50,950
weight
i don't know i just love the way i feel

5700
01:24:50,950 --> 01:24:50,960
i don't know i just love the way i feel
 

5701
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:52,310
i don't know i just love the way i feel
doing that so it's usually

5702
01:24:52,310 --> 01:24:52,320
doing that so it's usually
 

5703
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:53,830
doing that so it's usually
i forgot to mention that part i combine

5704
01:24:53,830 --> 01:24:53,840
i forgot to mention that part i combine
 

5705
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:55,590
i forgot to mention that part i combine
that with the running afterwards

5706
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:55,600
that with the running afterwards
 

5707
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:57,270
that with the running afterwards
doing some basic body weight stuff yeah

5708
01:24:57,270 --> 01:24:57,280
doing some basic body weight stuff yeah
 

5709
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:59,030
doing some basic body weight stuff yeah
and i think like you're gonna get

5710
01:24:59,030 --> 01:24:59,040
and i think like you're gonna get
 

5711
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:01,110
and i think like you're gonna get
from if we're not looking at it from

5712
01:25:01,110 --> 01:25:01,120
from if we're not looking at it from
 

5713
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:03,030
from if we're not looking at it from
like specifically like

5714
01:25:03,030 --> 01:25:03,040
like specifically like
 

5715
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:06,149
like specifically like
training at a pace in order to get both

5716
01:25:06,149 --> 01:25:06,159
training at a pace in order to get both
 

5717
01:25:06,159 --> 01:25:06,950
training at a pace in order to get both
the

5718
01:25:06,950 --> 01:25:06,960
the
 

5719
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:09,189
the
skeletal muscle adaptations as well as

5720
01:25:09,189 --> 01:25:09,199
skeletal muscle adaptations as well as
 

5721
01:25:09,199 --> 01:25:11,030
skeletal muscle adaptations as well as
the cardiovascular benefits

5722
01:25:11,030 --> 01:25:11,040
the cardiovascular benefits
 

5723
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:12,470
the cardiovascular benefits
you're probably tapping into some of the

5724
01:25:12,470 --> 01:25:12,480
you're probably tapping into some of the
 

5725
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:13,750
you're probably tapping into some of the
higher intensity stuff with that body

5726
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:13,760
higher intensity stuff with that body
 

5727
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:14,470
higher intensity stuff with that body
weight stuff this

5728
01:25:14,470 --> 01:25:14,480
weight stuff this
 

5729
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:17,510
weight stuff this
and unless you're doing i guess no rest

5730
01:25:17,510 --> 01:25:17,520
and unless you're doing i guess no rest
 

5731
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:19,830
and unless you're doing i guess no rest
it's okay so is it you're getting pretty

5732
01:25:19,830 --> 01:25:19,840
it's okay so is it you're getting pretty
 

5733
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:21,270
it's okay so is it you're getting pretty
high heart rate from that yeah yeah very

5734
01:25:21,270 --> 01:25:21,280
high heart rate from that yeah yeah very
 

5735
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:21,669
high heart rate from that yeah yeah very
hard

5736
01:25:21,669 --> 01:25:21,679
hard
 

5737
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:23,590
hard
okay higher than running yep so you're

5738
01:25:23,590 --> 01:25:23,600
okay higher than running yep so you're
 

5739
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:25,430
okay higher than running yep so you're
tracking that box there from just like a

5740
01:25:25,430 --> 01:25:25,440
tracking that box there from just like a
 

5741
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:26,950
tracking that box there from just like a
lifestyle

5742
01:25:26,950 --> 01:25:26,960
lifestyle
 

5743
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:29,750
lifestyle
uh enjoyment fitness overall fitness

5744
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:29,760
uh enjoyment fitness overall fitness
 

5745
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:31,110
uh enjoyment fitness overall fitness
standpoint

5746
01:25:31,110 --> 01:25:31,120
standpoint
 

5747
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:32,709
standpoint
uh i think you want to keep your running

5748
01:25:32,709 --> 01:25:32,719
uh i think you want to keep your running
 

5749
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:34,790
uh i think you want to keep your running
more aerobic then because you're getting

5750
01:25:34,790 --> 01:25:34,800
more aerobic then because you're getting
 

5751
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:35,110
more aerobic then because you're getting
that

5752
01:25:35,110 --> 01:25:35,120
that
 

5753
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:36,310
that
and you're probably getting it from like

5754
01:25:36,310 --> 01:25:36,320
and you're probably getting it from like
 

5755
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:38,149
and you're probably getting it from like
your grappling workouts too i would

5756
01:25:38,149 --> 01:25:38,159
your grappling workouts too i would
 

5757
01:25:38,159 --> 01:25:39,110
your grappling workouts too i would
guess so

5758
01:25:39,110 --> 01:25:39,120
guess so
 

5759
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:41,270
guess so
there's just not as big of a need for

5760
01:25:41,270 --> 01:25:41,280
there's just not as big of a need for
 

5761
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:42,790
there's just not as big of a need for
you from an

5762
01:25:42,790 --> 01:25:42,800
you from an
 

5763
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:45,189
you from an
big picture standpoint to be doubling

5764
01:25:45,189 --> 01:25:45,199
big picture standpoint to be doubling
 

5765
01:25:45,199 --> 01:25:46,790
big picture standpoint to be doubling
down on that stuff

5766
01:25:46,790 --> 01:25:46,800
down on that stuff
 

5767
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:49,510
down on that stuff
with your runs as well and it sounds

5768
01:25:49,510 --> 01:25:49,520
with your runs as well and it sounds
 

5769
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:51,510
with your runs as well and it sounds
like you prefer not to

5770
01:25:51,510 --> 01:25:51,520
like you prefer not to
 

5771
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:54,550
like you prefer not to
that's right so i mean um

5772
01:25:54,550 --> 01:25:54,560
that's right so i mean um
 

5773
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,470
that's right so i mean um
what about the distance of marathon

5774
01:25:56,470 --> 01:25:56,480
what about the distance of marathon
 

5775
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:58,709
what about the distance of marathon
versus 100 miles is that big difference

5776
01:25:58,709 --> 01:25:58,719
versus 100 miles is that big difference
 

5777
01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:02,310
versus 100 miles is that big difference
what's a good goal to work towards is it

5778
01:26:02,310 --> 01:26:02,320
what's a good goal to work towards is it
 

5779
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:03,750
what's a good goal to work towards is it
marathon and the rest of it

5780
01:26:03,750 --> 01:26:03,760
marathon and the rest of it
 

5781
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:06,709
marathon and the rest of it
just takes care of itself like yeah so

5782
01:26:06,709 --> 01:26:06,719
just takes care of itself like yeah so
 

5783
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:08,390
just takes care of itself like yeah so
you want to do a marathon and then

5784
01:26:08,390 --> 01:26:08,400
you want to do a marathon and then
 

5785
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:09,910
you want to do a marathon and then
ultimately do a hundred mile after that

5786
01:26:09,910 --> 01:26:09,920
ultimately do a hundred mile after that
 

5787
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:11,350
ultimately do a hundred mile after that
is that what you're saying i have no no

5788
01:26:11,350 --> 01:26:11,360
is that what you're saying i have no no

for anything right my own personal goal
 

5799
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:21,110
for anything right my own personal goal
is to feel

5800
01:26:21,110 --> 01:26:21,120
is to feel
 

5801
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:23,189
is to feel
somewhat challenged but comfortable

5802
01:26:23,189 --> 01:26:23,199
somewhat challenged but comfortable
 

5803
01:26:23,199 --> 01:26:24,310
somewhat challenged but comfortable
running a marathon

5804
01:26:24,310 --> 01:26:24,320
running a marathon
 

5805
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:27,350
running a marathon
the longest i've ever run is 22 miles

5806
01:26:27,350 --> 01:26:27,360
the longest i've ever run is 22 miles
 

5807
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:29,189
the longest i've ever run is 22 miles
but i you know there's been many

5808
01:26:29,189 --> 01:26:29,199
but i you know there's been many
 

5809
01:26:29,199 --> 01:26:30,390
but i you know there's been many
stretches in my life where i would

5810
01:26:30,390 --> 01:26:30,400
stretches in my life where i would
 

5811
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:31,510
stretches in my life where i would
regularly run

5812
01:26:31,510 --> 01:26:31,520
regularly run
 

5813
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:33,189
regularly run
like the long run would be close to 20

5814
01:26:33,189 --> 01:26:33,199
like the long run would be close to 20
 

5815
01:26:33,199 --> 01:26:34,550
like the long run would be close to 20
miles so i

5816
01:26:34,550 --> 01:26:34,560
miles so i
 

5817
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:36,550
miles so i
you know and then i was comfortably

5818
01:26:36,550 --> 01:26:36,560
you know and then i was comfortably
 

5819
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:38,149
you know and then i was comfortably
running 10 miles

5820
01:26:38,149 --> 01:26:38,159
running 10 miles
 

5821
01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:40,870
running 10 miles
four months ago it was like forever ago

5822
01:26:40,870 --> 01:26:40,880
four months ago it was like forever ago
 

5823
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:42,390
four months ago it was like forever ago
uh

5824
01:26:42,390 --> 01:26:42,400
uh
 

5825
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:44,550
uh
until i injured myself a little bit by

5826
01:26:44,550 --> 01:26:44,560
until i injured myself a little bit by
 

5827
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:46,550
until i injured myself a little bit by
running in the snow and stubbing my toe

5828
01:26:46,550 --> 01:26:46,560
running in the snow and stubbing my toe
 

5829
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:48,790
running in the snow and stubbing my toe
to where it was like you don't realize

5830
01:26:48,790 --> 01:26:48,800
to where it was like you don't realize
 

5831
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:50,470
to where it was like you don't realize
how much you appreciate your toes

5832
01:26:50,470 --> 01:26:50,480
how much you appreciate your toes
 

5833
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:53,110
how much you appreciate your toes
until you step big toes where all that

5834
01:26:53,110 --> 01:26:53,120
until you step big toes where all that
 

5835
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:54,470
until you step big toes where all that
power comes off yeah

5836
01:26:54,470 --> 01:26:54,480
power comes off yeah
 

5837
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:57,590
power comes off yeah
and so it's it it was surprising how

5838
01:26:57,590 --> 01:26:57,600
and so it's it it was surprising how
 

5839
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:59,350
and so it's it it was surprising how
long it took to heal

5840
01:26:59,350 --> 01:26:59,360
long it took to heal
 

5841
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:01,510
long it took to heal
uh and how essential it was and how

5842
01:27:01,510 --> 01:27:01,520
uh and how essential it was and how
 

5843
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:03,270
uh and how essential it was and how
unpleasant running how much hey hated

5844
01:27:03,270 --> 01:27:03,280
unpleasant running how much hey hated
 

5845
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:04,229
unpleasant running how much hey hated
running with it

5846
01:27:04,229 --> 01:27:04,239
running with it
 

5847
01:27:04,239 --> 01:27:06,070
running with it
and then i kept like coming trying to

5848
01:27:06,070 --> 01:27:06,080
and then i kept like coming trying to
 

5849
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:07,990
and then i kept like coming trying to
get back out there to run to think i

5850
01:27:07,990 --> 01:27:08,000
get back out there to run to think i
 

5851
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,030
get back out there to run to think i
think it's okay

5852
01:27:09,030 --> 01:27:09,040
think it's okay
 

5853
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:11,669
think it's okay
and no it's not okay you really need to

5854
01:27:11,669 --> 01:27:11,679
and no it's not okay you really need to
 

5855
01:27:11,679 --> 01:27:12,709
and no it's not okay you really need to
let it fully heal

5856
01:27:12,709 --> 01:27:12,719
let it fully heal
 

5857
01:27:12,719 --> 01:27:14,390
let it fully heal
at least that was my experience i

5858
01:27:14,390 --> 01:27:14,400
at least that was my experience i
 

5859
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:15,990
at least that was my experience i
couldn't like just suck it up it was

5860
01:27:15,990 --> 01:27:16,000
couldn't like just suck it up it was
 

5861
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,270
couldn't like just suck it up it was
making it worse every time

5862
01:27:17,270 --> 01:27:17,280
making it worse every time
 

5863
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:18,390
making it worse every time
it's one of those injuries that could

5864
01:27:18,390 --> 01:27:18,400
it's one of those injuries that could
 

5865
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:20,070
it's one of those injuries that could
really feel even though it's so small

5866
01:27:20,070 --> 01:27:20,080
really feel even though it's so small
 

5867
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:21,910
really feel even though it's so small
[Laughter]

5868
01:27:21,910 --> 01:27:21,920
[Laughter]
 

5869
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:23,510
[Laughter]
it's essential so is there any

5870
01:27:23,510 --> 01:27:23,520
it's essential so is there any
 

5871
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:25,830
it's essential so is there any
difference between the goal of marathon

5872
01:27:25,830 --> 01:27:25,840
difference between the goal of marathon
 

5873
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:28,390
difference between the goal of marathon
or 100 miles would you say should i be

5874
01:27:28,390 --> 01:27:28,400
or 100 miles would you say should i be
 

5875
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:29,990
or 100 miles would you say should i be
prepping for 100 miles if that's at all

5876
01:27:29,990 --> 01:27:30,000
prepping for 100 miles if that's at all
 

5877
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,189
prepping for 100 miles if that's at all
a possibility

5878
01:27:31,189 --> 01:27:31,199
a possibility
 

5879
01:27:31,199 --> 01:27:33,270
a possibility
the big difference is going to be like

5880
01:27:33,270 --> 01:27:33,280
the big difference is going to be like
 

5881
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:35,590
the big difference is going to be like
you're dropping intensity significantly

5882
01:27:35,590 --> 01:27:35,600
you're dropping intensity significantly
 

5883
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:37,430
you're dropping intensity significantly
by going up to 100 miles versus the

5884
01:27:37,430 --> 01:27:37,440
by going up to 100 miles versus the
 

5885
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:38,709
by going up to 100 miles versus the
marathon so

5886
01:27:38,709 --> 01:27:38,719
marathon so
 

5887
01:27:38,719 --> 01:27:40,470
marathon so
the maximum roving function i think is

5888
01:27:40,470 --> 01:27:40,480
the maximum roving function i think is
 

5889
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:41,830
the maximum roving function i think is
actually going to feed into that maybe a

5890
01:27:41,830 --> 01:27:41,840
actually going to feed into that maybe a
 

5891
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:43,189
actually going to feed into that maybe a
little bit better it's probably a little

5892
01:27:43,189 --> 01:27:43,199
little bit better it's probably a little
 

5893
01:27:43,199 --> 01:27:44,229
little bit better it's probably a little
closer

5894
01:27:44,229 --> 01:27:44,239
closer
 

5895
01:27:44,239 --> 01:27:47,270
closer
um depending on where i mean all it all

5896
01:27:47,270 --> 01:27:47,280
um depending on where i mean all it all
 

5897
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:48,950
um depending on where i mean all it all
varies a bit because like people people

5898
01:27:48,950 --> 01:27:48,960
varies a bit because like people people
 

5899
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:50,629
varies a bit because like people people
focus on specific distances and they'll

5900
01:27:50,629 --> 01:27:50,639
focus on specific distances and they'll
 

5901
01:27:50,639 --> 01:27:50,950
focus on specific distances and they'll
get

5902
01:27:50,950 --> 01:27:50,960
get
 

5903
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:54,310
get
very efficient and very adapted to that

5904
01:27:54,310 --> 01:27:54,320
very efficient and very adapted to that
 

5905
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:54,629
very efficient and very adapted to that
so

5906
01:27:54,629 --> 01:27:54,639
so
 

5907
01:27:54,639 --> 01:27:57,750
so
like the it kind of like it's what makes

5908
01:27:57,750 --> 01:27:57,760
like the it kind of like it's what makes
 

5909
01:27:57,760 --> 01:27:59,510
like the it kind of like it's what makes
running kind of messy where like you'll

5910
01:27:59,510 --> 01:27:59,520
running kind of messy where like you'll
 

5911
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:00,149
running kind of messy where like you'll
get

5912
01:28:00,149 --> 01:28:00,159
get
 

5913
01:28:00,159 --> 01:28:02,629
get
for for example like the average person

5914
01:28:02,629 --> 01:28:02,639
for for example like the average person
 

5915
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:04,950
for for example like the average person
can hit their like lactate threshold for

5916
01:28:04,950 --> 01:28:04,960
can hit their like lactate threshold for
 

5917
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:06,390
can hit their like lactate threshold for
probably about like 60 minutes or

5918
01:28:06,390 --> 01:28:06,400
probably about like 60 minutes or
 

5919
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:07,350
probably about like 60 minutes or
something like that whereas you get

5920
01:28:07,350 --> 01:28:07,360
something like that whereas you get
 

5921
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:09,430
something like that whereas you get
these elite marathoners who've been

5922
01:28:09,430 --> 01:28:09,440
these elite marathoners who've been
 

5923
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:10,709
these elite marathoners who've been
basically spending their entire life

5924
01:28:10,709 --> 01:28:10,719
basically spending their entire life
 

5925
01:28:10,719 --> 01:28:12,709
basically spending their entire life
preparing for a marathon race they can

5926
01:28:12,709 --> 01:28:12,719
preparing for a marathon race they can
 

5927
01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:13,510
preparing for a marathon race they can
push

5928
01:28:13,510 --> 01:28:13,520
push
 

5929
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:15,350
push
almost up to their lactate threshold and

5930
01:28:15,350 --> 01:28:15,360
almost up to their lactate threshold and
 

5931
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,950
almost up to their lactate threshold and
after lactate threshold for

5932
01:28:16,950 --> 01:28:16,960
after lactate threshold for
 

5933
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:19,350
after lactate threshold for
almost like two hours so it gets a

5934
01:28:19,350 --> 01:28:19,360
almost like two hours so it gets a
 

5935
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:21,510
almost like two hours so it gets a
little messy when you start

5936
01:28:21,510 --> 01:28:21,520
little messy when you start
 

5937
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:23,669
little messy when you start
um looking at it from that lens but you

5938
01:28:23,669 --> 01:28:23,679
um looking at it from that lens but you
 

5939
01:28:23,679 --> 01:28:24,629
um looking at it from that lens but you
don't really have to worry about that

5940
01:28:24,629 --> 01:28:24,639
don't really have to worry about that
 

5941
01:28:24,639 --> 01:28:25,910
don't really have to worry about that
too much because you're not really

5942
01:28:25,910 --> 01:28:25,920
too much because you're not really
 

5943
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:26,870
too much because you're not really
focusing on

5944
01:28:26,870 --> 01:28:26,880
focusing on
 

5945
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:29,030
focusing on
being the best possible 100 miler or the

5946
01:28:29,030 --> 01:28:29,040
being the best possible 100 miler or the
 

5947
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:30,550
being the best possible 100 miler or the
best possible marathoner you could be

5948
01:28:30,550 --> 01:28:30,560
best possible marathoner you could be
 

5949
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:31,350
best possible marathoner you could be
you want

5950
01:28:31,350 --> 01:28:31,360
you want
 

5951
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:33,030
you want
enough overall fitness that you can just

5952
01:28:33,030 --> 01:28:33,040
enough overall fitness that you can just
 

5953
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:34,390
enough overall fitness that you can just
do either one of them

5954
01:28:34,390 --> 01:28:34,400
do either one of them
 

5955
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:36,629
do either one of them
without absolute misery because you did

5956
01:28:36,629 --> 01:28:36,639
without absolute misery because you did
 

5957
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:38,470
without absolute misery because you did
the couch to 100 miles

5958
01:28:38,470 --> 01:28:38,480
the couch to 100 miles
 

5959
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:41,270
the couch to 100 miles
exactly so i think like for 100 miles

5960
01:28:41,270 --> 01:28:41,280
exactly so i think like for 100 miles
 

5961
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:41,990
exactly so i think like for 100 miles
the biggest difference

5962
01:28:41,990 --> 01:28:42,000
the biggest difference
 

5963
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,990
the biggest difference
i think given your contacts is just like

5964
01:28:43,990 --> 01:28:44,000
i think given your contacts is just like
 

5965
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,149
i think given your contacts is just like
the more physical things you are doing

5966
01:28:46,149 --> 01:28:46,159
the more physical things you are doing
 

5967
01:28:46,159 --> 01:28:47,350
the more physical things you are doing
the better prepared you're going to be

5968
01:28:47,350 --> 01:28:47,360
the better prepared you're going to be
 

5969
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:50,310
the better prepared you're going to be
for the 100 mile so it's almost

5970
01:28:50,310 --> 01:28:50,320
for the 100 mile so it's almost
 

5971
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:52,790
for the 100 mile so it's almost
given your context i wouldn't say

5972
01:28:52,790 --> 01:28:52,800
given your context i wouldn't say
 

5973
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,149
given your context i wouldn't say
irrelevant you want to be doing running

5974
01:28:54,149 --> 01:28:54,159
irrelevant you want to be doing running
 

5975
01:28:54,159 --> 01:28:55,510
irrelevant you want to be doing running
but you're going to be doing that once

5976
01:28:55,510 --> 01:28:55,520
but you're going to be doing that once
 

5977
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:56,709
but you're going to be doing that once
you put it in your program it sounds

5978
01:28:56,709 --> 01:28:56,719
you put it in your program it sounds
 

5979
01:28:56,719 --> 01:28:58,070
you put it in your program it sounds
like it's going to be pretty

5980
01:28:58,070 --> 01:28:58,080
like it's going to be pretty
 

5981
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:01,110
like it's going to be pretty
locked in um you're going to want to

5982
01:29:01,110 --> 01:29:01,120
locked in um you're going to want to
 

5983
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:01,669
locked in um you're going to want to
also

5984
01:29:01,669 --> 01:29:01,679
also
 

5985
01:29:01,679 --> 01:29:04,470
also
like it if you view it this way it's

5986
01:29:04,470 --> 01:29:04,480
like it if you view it this way it's
 

5987
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:05,750
like it if you view it this way it's
probably going to be more mentally

5988
01:29:05,750 --> 01:29:05,760
probably going to be more mentally
 

5989
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:07,350
probably going to be more mentally
beneficial too where

5990
01:29:07,350 --> 01:29:07,360
beneficial too where
 

5991
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:09,669
beneficial too where
hey today i did my run i did my

5992
01:29:09,669 --> 01:29:09,679
hey today i did my run i did my
 

5993
01:29:09,679 --> 01:29:11,110
hey today i did my run i did my
bodyweight exercises i did some

5994
01:29:11,110 --> 01:29:11,120
bodyweight exercises i did some
 

5995
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:12,470
bodyweight exercises i did some
grappling practice

5996
01:29:12,470 --> 01:29:12,480
grappling practice
 

5997
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:14,790
grappling practice
you know i spent three hours working out

5998
01:29:14,790 --> 01:29:14,800
you know i spent three hours working out
 

5999
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:16,550
you know i spent three hours working out
today yeah if you think of it like that

6000
01:29:16,550 --> 01:29:16,560
today yeah if you think of it like that
 

6001
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:16,950
today yeah if you think of it like that
then

6002
01:29:16,950 --> 01:29:16,960
then
 

6003
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:18,870
then
you know you're you're moving your body

6004
01:29:18,870 --> 01:29:18,880
you know you're you're moving your body
 

6005
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:20,709
you know you're you're moving your body
you're doing things that are

6006
01:29:20,709 --> 01:29:20,719
you're doing things that are
 

6007
01:29:20,719 --> 01:29:23,590
you're doing things that are
active for a good chunk of the day

6008
01:29:23,590 --> 01:29:23,600
active for a good chunk of the day
 

6009
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:24,070
active for a good chunk of the day
especially

6010
01:29:24,070 --> 01:29:24,080
especially
 

6011
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:26,550
especially
relative to most people so that's gonna

6012
01:29:26,550 --> 01:29:26,560
relative to most people so that's gonna
 

6013
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:28,390
relative to most people so that's gonna
actually be very helpful for you

6014
01:29:28,390 --> 01:29:28,400
actually be very helpful for you
 

6015
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:30,870
actually be very helpful for you
uh the the problem or the the battle to

6016
01:29:30,870 --> 01:29:30,880
uh the the problem or the the battle to
 

6017
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:32,550
uh the the problem or the the battle to
get over is gonna just be like

6018
01:29:32,550 --> 01:29:32,560
get over is gonna just be like
 

6019
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:35,030
get over is gonna just be like
the you know you're gonna break down

6020
01:29:35,030 --> 01:29:35,040
the you know you're gonna break down
 

6021
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:36,709
the you know you're gonna break down
physically running a hundred miles

6022
01:29:36,709 --> 01:29:36,719
physically running a hundred miles
 

6023
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:37,910
physically running a hundred miles
and you're gonna break down physically

6024
01:29:37,910 --> 01:29:37,920
and you're gonna break down physically
 

6025
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:39,910
and you're gonna break down physically
running a marathon too so

6026
01:29:39,910 --> 01:29:39,920
running a marathon too so
 

6027
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:42,550
running a marathon too so
like the you might just have to push

6028
01:29:42,550 --> 01:29:42,560
like the you might just have to push
 

6029
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:43,990
like the you might just have to push
through a little more discomfort

6030
01:29:43,990 --> 01:29:44,000
through a little more discomfort
 

6031
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,669
through a little more discomfort
like from a physical standpoint compared

6032
01:29:45,669 --> 01:29:45,679
like from a physical standpoint compared
 

6033
01:29:45,679 --> 01:29:47,030
like from a physical standpoint compared
to be if you decided

6034
01:29:47,030 --> 01:29:47,040
to be if you decided
 

6035
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:49,350
to be if you decided
i'm gonna do everything i can in these

6036
01:29:49,350 --> 01:29:49,360
i'm gonna do everything i can in these
 

6037
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:50,229
i'm gonna do everything i can in these
next like

6038
01:29:50,229 --> 01:29:50,239
next like
 

6039
01:29:50,239 --> 01:29:53,189
next like
24 weeks to be able to run a full

6040
01:29:53,189 --> 01:29:53,199
24 weeks to be able to run a full
 

6041
01:29:53,199 --> 01:29:54,149
24 weeks to be able to run a full
hundred

6042

hundred
 

6043
01:29:54,159 --> 01:29:56,149
hundred
a hundred miler would you say it's

6044
01:29:56,149 --> 01:29:56,159
a hundred miler would you say it's
 

6045
01:29:56,159 --> 01:29:59,350
a hundred miler would you say it's
physical or is it mental discomfort like

6046
01:29:59,350 --> 01:29:59,360
physical or is it mental discomfort like
 

6047
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:01,590
physical or is it mental discomfort like
uh i mean isn't everything physically

6048
01:30:01,590 --> 01:30:01,600
uh i mean isn't everything physically
 

6049
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,629
uh i mean isn't everything physically
uncomfortable like

6050
01:30:02,629 --> 01:30:02,639
uncomfortable like
 

6051
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:05,030
uncomfortable like
what uh do you train for if you're

6052
01:30:05,030 --> 01:30:05,040
what uh do you train for if you're
 

6053
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:06,790
what uh do you train for if you're
training for

6054
01:30:06,790 --> 01:30:06,800
training for
 

6055
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:08,790
training for
the chaos of uh so it's not necessarily

6056
01:30:08,790 --> 01:30:08,800
the chaos of uh so it's not necessarily
 

6057
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:10,550
the chaos of uh so it's not necessarily
100 miles it's the chaos of the

6058
01:30:10,550 --> 01:30:10,560
100 miles it's the chaos of the
 

6059
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:12,629
100 miles it's the chaos of the
unexpected which might include 100 miles

6060
01:30:12,629 --> 01:30:12,639
unexpected which might include 100 miles
 

6061
01:30:12,639 --> 01:30:14,229
unexpected which might include 100 miles
but it might also include a thousand

6062
01:30:14,229 --> 01:30:14,239
but it might also include a thousand
 

6063
01:30:14,239 --> 01:30:14,870
but it might also include a thousand
push-ups

6064
01:30:14,870 --> 01:30:14,880
push-ups
 

6065
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:16,629
push-ups
yeah in my case so like you need a big

6066
01:30:16,629 --> 01:30:16,639
yeah in my case so like you need a big
 

6067
01:30:16,639 --> 01:30:18,070
yeah in my case so like you need a big
jack-of-all-trades it's what you need to

6068
01:30:18,070 --> 01:30:18,080
jack-of-all-trades it's what you need to
 

6069
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:19,669
jack-of-all-trades it's what you need to
be yeah but also like building up the

6070
01:30:19,669 --> 01:30:19,679
be yeah but also like building up the
 

6071
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:21,189
be yeah but also like building up the
confidence

6072
01:30:21,189 --> 01:30:21,199
confidence
 

6073
01:30:21,199 --> 01:30:23,030
confidence
or maybe not i don't know how do you

6074
01:30:23,030 --> 01:30:23,040
or maybe not i don't know how do you
 

6075
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:24,470
or maybe not i don't know how do you
survive um

6076
01:30:24,470 --> 01:30:24,480
survive um
 

6077
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:27,110
survive um
a thousand push-ups it's a combination

6078
01:30:27,110 --> 01:30:27,120
a thousand push-ups it's a combination
 

6079
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:28,629
a thousand push-ups it's a combination
of confidence that

6080
01:30:28,629 --> 01:30:28,639
of confidence that
 

6081
01:30:28,639 --> 01:30:30,229
of confidence that
you have to know that you can do that

6082
01:30:30,229 --> 01:30:30,239
you have to know that you can do that
 

6083
01:30:30,239 --> 01:30:32,310
you have to know that you can do that
kind of thing not necessarily the actual

6084
01:30:32,310 --> 01:30:32,320
kind of thing not necessarily the actual
 

6085
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:34,229
kind of thing not necessarily the actual
number but like

6086
01:30:34,229 --> 01:30:34,239
number but like
 

6087
01:30:34,239 --> 01:30:37,669
number but like
doing crazy stuff and the

6088
01:30:37,669 --> 01:30:37,679
doing crazy stuff and the
 

6089
01:30:37,679 --> 01:30:40,390
doing crazy stuff and the
the second is probably okay the the base

6090
01:30:40,390 --> 01:30:40,400
the second is probably okay the the base
 

6091
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:41,189
the second is probably okay the the base
strength

6092
01:30:41,189 --> 01:30:41,199
strength
 

6093
01:30:41,199 --> 01:30:45,189
strength
and endurance and also just the

6094
01:30:45,189 --> 01:30:45,199
and endurance and also just the
 

6095
01:30:45,199 --> 01:30:47,750
and endurance and also just the
practicing that process of not quitting

6096
01:30:47,750 --> 01:30:47,760
practicing that process of not quitting
 

6097
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:49,430
practicing that process of not quitting
i feel like that's one of the things i

6098
01:30:49,430 --> 01:30:49,440
i feel like that's one of the things i
 

6099
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:51,669
i feel like that's one of the things i
really need to do in the running space

6100
01:30:51,669 --> 01:30:51,679
really need to do in the running space
 

6101
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:53,590
really need to do in the running space
is like doing slightly unpleasant things

6102
01:30:53,590 --> 01:30:53,600
is like doing slightly unpleasant things
 

6103
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:55,830
is like doing slightly unpleasant things
where i'm practicing that like bringing

6104
01:30:55,830 --> 01:30:55,840
where i'm practicing that like bringing
 

6105
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:56,550
where i'm practicing that like bringing
my mind back

6106
01:30:56,550 --> 01:30:56,560
my mind back
 

6107
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:59,669
my mind back
and saying nope uh i'm gonna keep doing

6108
01:30:59,669 --> 01:30:59,679
and saying nope uh i'm gonna keep doing
 

6109
01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:00,390
and saying nope uh i'm gonna keep doing
it and

6110
01:31:00,390 --> 01:31:00,400
it and
 

6111
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:02,550
it and
part of the running every day has that

6112
01:31:02,550 --> 01:31:02,560
part of the running every day has that
 

6113
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:03,910
part of the running every day has that
benefit because some days you really

6114
01:31:03,910 --> 01:31:03,920
benefit because some days you really
 

6115
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:04,870
benefit because some days you really
don't want to

6116
01:31:04,870 --> 01:31:04,880
don't want to
 

6117
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:06,629
don't want to
don't feel like running and doing that

6118
01:31:06,629 --> 01:31:06,639
don't feel like running and doing that
 

6119
01:31:06,639 --> 01:31:09,990
don't feel like running and doing that
then you're practicing that muscle of um

6120
01:31:09,990 --> 01:31:10,000
then you're practicing that muscle of um
 

6121
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,709
then you're practicing that muscle of um
of doing it anyway um i don't know if

6122
01:31:12,709 --> 01:31:12,719
of doing it anyway um i don't know if
 

6123
01:31:12,719 --> 01:31:13,910
of doing it anyway um i don't know if
there's something you can say in terms

6124
01:31:13,910 --> 01:31:13,920
there's something you can say in terms
 

6125
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:15,350
there's something you can say in terms
of advice how to practice

6126
01:31:15,350 --> 01:31:15,360
of advice how to practice
 

6127
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:18,550
of advice how to practice
the like doing something unpleasant

6128
01:31:18,550 --> 01:31:18,560
the like doing something unpleasant
 

6129
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:19,510
the like doing something unpleasant
every day

6130
01:31:19,510 --> 01:31:19,520
every day
 

6131
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:21,669
every day
yeah frequently yeah what i would do

6132
01:31:21,669 --> 01:31:21,679
yeah frequently yeah what i would do
 

6133
01:31:21,679 --> 01:31:22,629
yeah frequently yeah what i would do
with that

6134
01:31:22,629 --> 01:31:22,639
with that
 

6135
01:31:22,639 --> 01:31:25,270
with that
is i would try to make the unpleasant

6136
01:31:25,270 --> 01:31:25,280
is i would try to make the unpleasant
 

6137
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:26,550
is i would try to make the unpleasant
thing

6138
01:31:26,550 --> 01:31:26,560
thing
 

6139
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:28,470
thing
be different from one day to the next if

6140
01:31:28,470 --> 01:31:28,480
be different from one day to the next if
 

6141
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:29,669
be different from one day to the next if
you can so

6142
01:31:29,669 --> 01:31:29,679
you can so
 

6143
01:31:29,679 --> 01:31:32,310
you can so
the fear i would have with making

6144
01:31:32,310 --> 01:31:32,320
the fear i would have with making
 

6145
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:34,149
the fear i would have with making
running unpleasant every time

6146
01:31:34,149 --> 01:31:34,159
running unpleasant every time
 

6147
01:31:34,159 --> 01:31:37,030
running unpleasant every time
would be it becomes like a negative

6148
01:31:37,030 --> 01:31:37,040
would be it becomes like a negative
 

6149
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:38,470
would be it becomes like a negative
feedback loop

6150
01:31:38,470 --> 01:31:38,480
feedback loop
 

6151
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:41,030
feedback loop
in your physiologically potentially as

6152
01:31:41,030 --> 01:31:41,040
in your physiologically potentially as
 

6153
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:42,310
in your physiologically potentially as
well as mentally where

6154
01:31:42,310 --> 01:31:42,320
well as mentally where
 

6155
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:45,270
well as mentally where
if the entire running process is

6156
01:31:45,270 --> 01:31:45,280
if the entire running process is
 

6157
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,470
if the entire running process is
miserable

6158
01:31:46,470 --> 01:31:46,480
miserable
 

6159
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:47,750
miserable
you're gonna be miserable when you step

6160
01:31:47,750 --> 01:31:47,760
you're gonna be miserable when you step
 

6161
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:48,870
you're gonna be miserable when you step
on that starting line whether it's a

6162
01:31:48,870 --> 01:31:48,880
on that starting line whether it's a
 

6163
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:50,629
on that starting line whether it's a
marathon or a hundred miles so

6164
01:31:50,629 --> 01:31:50,639
marathon or a hundred miles so
 

6165
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:52,390
marathon or a hundred miles so
you've trained yourself then running

6166
01:31:52,390 --> 01:31:52,400
you've trained yourself then running
 

6167
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:54,390
you've trained yourself then running
equals miserable well and here's the

6168
01:31:54,390 --> 01:31:54,400
equals miserable well and here's the
 

6169
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:55,990
equals miserable well and here's the
thing like i mean if you look at just

6170
01:31:55,990 --> 01:31:56,000
thing like i mean if you look at just
 

6171
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:56,310
thing like i mean if you look at just
like

6172
01:31:56,310 --> 01:31:56,320
like
 

6173
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:57,830
like
here's where the literature says on

6174
01:31:57,830 --> 01:31:57,840
here's where the literature says on
 

6175
01:31:57,840 --> 01:31:59,350
here's where the literature says on
paper are like the

6176
01:31:59,350 --> 01:31:59,360
paper are like the
 

6177
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,430
paper are like the
you know dozen workouts you should do in

6178
01:32:01,430 --> 01:32:01,440
you know dozen workouts you should do in
 

6179
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:02,470
you know dozen workouts you should do in
a training plan

6180
01:32:02,470 --> 01:32:02,480
a training plan
 

6181
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:03,830
a training plan
and this is how you should structure

6182
01:32:03,830 --> 01:32:03,840
and this is how you should structure
 

6183
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:05,750
and this is how you should structure
them right down to the minute and you

6184
01:32:05,750 --> 01:32:05,760
them right down to the minute and you
 

6185
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:06,310
them right down to the minute and you
just say

6186
01:32:06,310 --> 01:32:06,320
just say
 

6187
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:07,990
just say
like i'm gonna give everyone this

6188
01:32:07,990 --> 01:32:08,000
like i'm gonna give everyone this
 

6189
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,750
like i'm gonna give everyone this
schedule and they're gonna do this every

6190
01:32:09,750 --> 01:32:09,760
schedule and they're gonna do this every
 

6191
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:11,590
schedule and they're gonna do this every
time rinse and repeat

6192
01:32:11,590 --> 01:32:11,600
time rinse and repeat
 

6193
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:14,470
time rinse and repeat
my biggest concern with that approach is

6194
01:32:14,470 --> 01:32:14,480
my biggest concern with that approach is
 

6195
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:14,790
my biggest concern with that approach is
you

6196
01:32:14,790 --> 01:32:14,800
you
 

6197
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:16,390
you
are potentially putting them in a

6198
01:32:16,390 --> 01:32:16,400
are potentially putting them in a
 

6199
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:18,470
are potentially putting them in a
position where the training is so boring

6200
01:32:18,470 --> 01:32:18,480
position where the training is so boring
 

6201
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:20,149
position where the training is so boring
and so monotonous

6202
01:32:20,149 --> 01:32:20,159
and so monotonous
 

6203
01:32:20,159 --> 01:32:23,030
and so monotonous
that like if they hit a roadblock

6204
01:32:23,030 --> 01:32:23,040
that like if they hit a roadblock
 

6205
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:23,669
that like if they hit a roadblock
mentally

6206
01:32:23,669 --> 01:32:23,679
mentally
 

6207
01:32:23,679 --> 01:32:25,270
mentally
they're gonna fall apart very quick

6208
01:32:25,270 --> 01:32:25,280
they're gonna fall apart very quick
 

6209
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:26,709
they're gonna fall apart very quick
because they've already exhausted

6210
01:32:26,709 --> 01:32:26,719
because they've already exhausted
 

6211
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:27,990
because they've already exhausted
themselves mentally just trying to do

6212
01:32:27,990 --> 01:32:28,000
themselves mentally just trying to do
 

6213
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,590
themselves mentally just trying to do
the same old interval every time

6214
01:32:29,590 --> 01:32:29,600
the same old interval every time
 

6215
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:31,990
the same old interval every time
doing the same old you know workout and

6216
01:32:31,990 --> 01:32:32,000
doing the same old you know workout and
 

6217
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:32,709
doing the same old you know workout and
it doesn't

6218
01:32:32,709 --> 01:32:32,719
it doesn't
 

6219
01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:35,830
it doesn't
have to be like one specific plan in its

6220
01:32:35,830 --> 01:32:35,840
have to be like one specific plan in its
 

6221
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:37,590
have to be like one specific plan in its
entirety could just be like

6222
01:32:37,590 --> 01:32:37,600
entirety could just be like
 

6223
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:39,830
entirety could just be like
like the the mix of things within it so

6224
01:32:39,830 --> 01:32:39,840
like the the mix of things within it so
 

6225
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:41,030
like the the mix of things within it so
like rather than like

6226
01:32:41,030 --> 01:32:41,040
like rather than like
 

6227
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:43,189
like rather than like
if i just said well we're gonna do three

6228
01:32:43,189 --> 01:32:43,199
if i just said well we're gonna do three
 

6229
01:32:43,199 --> 01:32:44,550
if i just said well we're gonna do three
minute intervals through this entire

6230
01:32:44,550 --> 01:32:44,560
minute intervals through this entire
 

6231
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:46,070
minute intervals through this entire
short interval process or two-minute

6232
01:32:46,070 --> 01:32:46,080
short interval process or two-minute
 

6233
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:46,950
short interval process or two-minute
intervals or

6234
01:32:46,950 --> 01:32:46,960
intervals or
 

6235
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:48,390
intervals or
four-minute intervals or 60-second

6236
01:32:48,390 --> 01:32:48,400
four-minute intervals or 60-second
 

6237
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:50,709
four-minute intervals or 60-second
intervals you know by that

6238
01:32:50,709 --> 01:32:50,719
intervals you know by that
 

6239
01:32:50,719 --> 01:32:52,629
intervals you know by that
sixth week they might be so sick of that

6240
01:32:52,629 --> 01:32:52,639
sixth week they might be so sick of that
 

6241
01:32:52,639 --> 01:32:53,990
sixth week they might be so sick of that
they're not actually maximizing their

6242
01:32:53,990 --> 01:32:54,000
they're not actually maximizing their
 

6243
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,590
they're not actually maximizing their
potential within that because there's no

6244
01:32:55,590 --> 01:32:55,600
potential within that because there's no
 

6245
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:56,790
potential within that because there's no
flavor there

6246
01:32:56,790 --> 01:32:56,800
flavor there
 

6247
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:58,629
flavor there
and and then they're also actually

6248
01:32:58,629 --> 01:32:58,639
and and then they're also actually
 

6249
01:32:58,639 --> 01:32:59,910
and and then they're also actually
getting less out of themselves than they

6250
01:32:59,910 --> 01:32:59,920
getting less out of themselves than they
 

6251
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:00,629
getting less out of themselves than they
would if we just

6252
01:33:00,629 --> 01:33:00,639
would if we just
 

6253
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:02,790
would if we just
got a little more creative and said okay

6254
01:33:02,790 --> 01:33:02,800
got a little more creative and said okay
 

6255
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:04,709
got a little more creative and said okay
let's mix this up and let's do

6256
01:33:04,709 --> 01:33:04,719
let's mix this up and let's do
 

6257
01:33:04,719 --> 01:33:07,030
let's mix this up and let's do
uh you know four one minute intervals

6258
01:33:07,030 --> 01:33:07,040
uh you know four one minute intervals
 

6259
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:08,709
uh you know four one minute intervals
then take a like a little bit of a break

6260
01:33:08,709 --> 01:33:08,719
then take a like a little bit of a break
 

6261
01:33:08,719 --> 01:33:10,390
then take a like a little bit of a break
and then we'll do three minute intervals

6262
01:33:10,390 --> 01:33:10,400
and then we'll do three minute intervals
 

6263
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:11,910
and then we'll do three minute intervals
or at least changing it up from week to

6264
01:33:11,910 --> 01:33:11,920
or at least changing it up from week to
 

6265
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:12,870
or at least changing it up from week to
week so that they have something

6266
01:33:12,870 --> 01:33:12,880
week so that they have something
 

6267
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:14,149
week so that they have something
different showing up even though we're

6268
01:33:14,149 --> 01:33:14,159
different showing up even though we're
 

6269
01:33:14,159 --> 01:33:15,110
different showing up even though we're
addressing the same kind of

6270
01:33:15,110 --> 01:33:15,120
addressing the same kind of
 

6271
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:17,030
addressing the same kind of
physiological adaptation

6272
01:33:17,030 --> 01:33:17,040
physiological adaptation
 

6273
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:20,310
physiological adaptation
uh so like i think what you want to do

6274
01:33:20,310 --> 01:33:20,320
uh so like i think what you want to do
 

6275
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:21,750
uh so like i think what you want to do
is you want to introduce the misery you

6276
01:33:21,750 --> 01:33:21,760
is you want to introduce the misery you
 

6277
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:23,590
is you want to introduce the misery you
want to be able to test yourself to the

6278
01:33:23,590 --> 01:33:23,600
want to be able to test yourself to the
 

6279
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:25,430
want to be able to test yourself to the
degree where like when you can recognize

6280
01:33:25,430 --> 01:33:25,440
degree where like when you can recognize
 

6281
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:27,110
degree where like when you can recognize
these points if i don't want to be here

6282
01:33:27,110 --> 01:33:27,120
these points if i don't want to be here
 

6283
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:29,750
these points if i don't want to be here
but i can do it push through it but

6284
01:33:29,750 --> 01:33:29,760
but i can do it push through it but
 

6285
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:30,950
but i can do it push through it but
recognize that

6286
01:33:30,950 --> 01:33:30,960
recognize that
 

6287
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:34,070
recognize that
like there's not necessarily going to be

6288
01:33:34,070 --> 01:33:34,080
like there's not necessarily going to be
 

6289
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:35,590
like there's not necessarily going to be
one event that you want to lean on to

6290
01:33:35,590 --> 01:33:35,600
one event that you want to lean on to
 

6291
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:37,110
one event that you want to lean on to
get that from because you won't want to

6292
01:33:37,110 --> 01:33:37,120
get that from because you won't want to
 

6293
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:38,149
get that from because you won't want to
make that one event

6294
01:33:38,149 --> 01:33:38,159
make that one event
 

6295
01:33:38,159 --> 01:33:39,350
make that one event
so miserable that you don't want to do

6296
01:33:39,350 --> 01:33:39,360
so miserable that you don't want to do
 

6297
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:40,870
so miserable that you don't want to do
it when it comes time for the challenge

6298
01:33:40,870 --> 01:33:40,880
it when it comes time for the challenge
 

6299
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:41,510
it when it comes time for the challenge
so

6300
01:33:41,510 --> 01:33:41,520
so
 

6301
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:43,910
so
if you can possibly say like okay on

6302
01:33:43,910 --> 01:33:43,920
if you can possibly say like okay on
 

6303
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:44,950
if you can possibly say like okay on
tuesdays

6304
01:33:44,950 --> 01:33:44,960
tuesdays
 

6305
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:48,070
tuesdays
the push-up workout i'm going to go 10

6306
01:33:48,070 --> 01:33:48,080
the push-up workout i'm going to go 10
 

6307
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:49,590
the push-up workout i'm going to go 10
push-ups more than i want to i'm going

6308
01:33:49,590 --> 01:33:49,600
push-ups more than i want to i'm going
 

6309
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:50,870
push-ups more than i want to i'm going
to get to that point where i'm like

6310
01:33:50,870 --> 01:33:50,880
to get to that point where i'm like
 

6311
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:51,910
to get to that point where i'm like
there's no more and then i'm going to do

6312
01:33:51,910 --> 01:33:51,920
there's no more and then i'm going to do
 

6313
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:52,709
there's no more and then i'm going to do
10 more

6314

and you're going to make that one
 

6317
01:33:53,679 --> 01:33:55,750
and you're going to make that one
miserable and then maybe on

6318
01:33:55,750 --> 01:33:55,760
miserable and then maybe on
 

6319
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:58,709
miserable and then maybe on
uh you know thursdays you decide to do

6320
01:33:58,709 --> 01:33:58,719
uh you know thursdays you decide to do

like some of those sprints or something
 

6323
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:01,750
like some of those sprints or something
at the end where

6324
01:34:01,750 --> 01:34:01,760
at the end where
 

6325
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:03,030
at the end where
you do a few of them and you're like

6326
01:34:03,030 --> 01:34:03,040
you do a few of them and you're like
 

6327
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:04,550
you do a few of them and you're like
okay this is where i'd be comfortable to

6328
01:34:04,550 --> 01:34:04,560
okay this is where i'd be comfortable to
 

6329
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:05,750
okay this is where i'd be comfortable to
stop like well i'm gonna do two more of

6330
01:34:05,750 --> 01:34:05,760
stop like well i'm gonna do two more of
 

6331
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:06,790
stop like well i'm gonna do two more of
them because i know i don't want to do

6332
01:34:06,790 --> 01:34:06,800
them because i know i don't want to do
 

6333
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:07,910
them because i know i don't want to do
two more of them

6334
01:34:07,910 --> 01:34:07,920
two more of them
 

6335
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:10,149
two more of them
but mix that up so you're not so at

6336
01:34:10,149 --> 01:34:10,159
but mix that up so you're not so at
 

6337
01:34:10,159 --> 01:34:11,830
but mix that up so you're not so at
least you're getting enjoyment from some

6338
01:34:11,830 --> 01:34:11,840
least you're getting enjoyment from some
 

6339
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:12,310
least you're getting enjoyment from some
of it

6340
01:34:12,310 --> 01:34:12,320
of it
 

6341
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:14,149
of it
and not just getting complete disgust

6342
01:34:14,149 --> 01:34:14,159
and not just getting complete disgust
 

6343
01:34:14,159 --> 01:34:15,350
and not just getting complete disgust
from the entire process yeah

6344
01:34:15,350 --> 01:34:15,360
from the entire process yeah
 

6345
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:17,910
from the entire process yeah
there's actually quite a lot of ways

6346
01:34:17,910 --> 01:34:17,920
there's actually quite a lot of ways
 

6347
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:19,590
there's actually quite a lot of ways
that i can introduce misery into the

6348
01:34:19,590 --> 01:34:19,600
that i can introduce misery into the
 

6349
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:21,430
that i can introduce misery into the
push-ups and the running get creative

6350
01:34:21,430 --> 01:34:21,440
push-ups and the running get creative
 

6351
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:23,910
push-ups and the running get creative
including um you know even just like

6352
01:34:23,910 --> 01:34:23,920
including um you know even just like
 

6353
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:25,510
including um you know even just like
stuff outside of the running like taking

6354
01:34:25,510 --> 01:34:25,520
stuff outside of the running like taking
 

6355
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:27,110
stuff outside of the running like taking
uh freezing cold showers those kinds of

6356
01:34:27,110 --> 01:34:27,120
uh freezing cold showers those kinds of
 

6357
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:29,030
uh freezing cold showers those kinds of
things just introducing

6358
01:34:29,030 --> 01:34:29,040
things just introducing
 

6359
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:31,270
things just introducing
random kind of chaos into the into the

6360
01:34:31,270 --> 01:34:31,280

kind of throwing throwing it all up in
the air and quitting they

6520
01:37:03,350 --> 01:37:03,360
the air and quitting they
 

6521
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:04,950
the air and quitting they
they have a resource there and that's

6522
01:37:04,950 --> 01:37:04,960
they have a resource there and that's
 

6523
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:06,229
they have a resource there and that's
probably a big reason why that's the

6524
01:37:06,229 --> 01:37:06,239
probably a big reason why that's the
 

6525
01:37:06,239 --> 01:37:07,669
probably a big reason why that's the
success rate that they have with that is

6526
01:37:07,669 --> 01:37:07,679
success rate that they have with that is
 

6527
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:09,109
success rate that they have with that is
they put those support mechanisms in

6528
01:37:09,109 --> 01:37:09,119
they put those support mechanisms in
 

6529
01:37:09,119 --> 01:37:09,910
they put those support mechanisms in
place

6530
01:37:09,910 --> 01:37:09,920
place
 

6531
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:12,629
place
that picture needs to be carried in to

6532
01:37:12,629 --> 01:37:12,639
that picture needs to be carried in to
 

6533
01:37:12,639 --> 01:37:13,990
that picture needs to be carried in to
the performance world or the running

6534
01:37:13,990 --> 01:37:14,000
the performance world or the running
 

6535
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,109
the performance world or the running
world too where

6536
01:37:15,109 --> 01:37:15,119
world too where
 

6537
01:37:15,119 --> 01:37:17,149
world too where
you know we may have just been

6538
01:37:17,149 --> 01:37:17,159
you know we may have just been
 

6539
01:37:17,159 --> 01:37:18,870
you know we may have just been
identifying

6540
01:37:18,870 --> 01:37:18,880
identifying
 

6541
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:23,030
identifying
that uh you olympic distance athletes

6542
01:37:23,030 --> 01:37:23,040
that uh you olympic distance athletes
 

6543
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:26,310
that uh you olympic distance athletes
that can tolerate a very large portion

6544
01:37:26,310 --> 01:37:26,320
that can tolerate a very large portion
 

6545
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:28,870
that can tolerate a very large portion
of their diet come from carbohydrate

6546
01:37:28,870 --> 01:37:28,880
of their diet come from carbohydrate
 

6547
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:30,870
of their diet come from carbohydrate
is gonna just it's gonna filter those

6548
01:37:30,870 --> 01:37:30,880
is gonna just it's gonna filter those
 

6549
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:32,709
is gonna just it's gonna filter those
ones towards the olympics

6550
01:37:32,709 --> 01:37:32,719
ones towards the olympics
 

6551
01:37:32,719 --> 01:37:34,870
ones towards the olympics
filter those towards interesting yeah

6552
01:37:34,870 --> 01:37:34,880
filter those towards interesting yeah
 

6553
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:36,870
filter those towards interesting yeah
and that doesn't mean that like

6554
01:37:36,870 --> 01:37:36,880
and that doesn't mean that like
 

6555
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:39,669
and that doesn't mean that like
uh if we would have taken say the gold

6556
01:37:39,669 --> 01:37:39,679
uh if we would have taken say the gold
 

6557
01:37:39,679 --> 01:37:41,109
uh if we would have taken say the gold
medals in the 5k and put them on a low

6558
01:37:41,109 --> 01:37:41,119
medals in the 5k and put them on a low
 

6559
01:37:41,119 --> 01:37:42,550
medals in the 5k and put them on a low
carb diet they'd run faster they

6560
01:37:42,550 --> 01:37:42,560
carb diet they'd run faster they
 

6561
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:43,350
carb diet they'd run faster they
probably wouldn't

6562
01:37:43,350 --> 01:37:43,360
probably wouldn't
 

6563
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:44,709
probably wouldn't
because we may have already selected

6564
01:37:44,709 --> 01:37:44,719
because we may have already selected
 

6565
01:37:44,719 --> 01:37:45,750
because we may have already selected
that that person's thriving on

6566
01:37:45,750 --> 01:37:45,760
that that person's thriving on
 

6567
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:47,350
that that person's thriving on
carbohydrate

6568
01:37:47,350 --> 01:37:47,360
carbohydrate
 

6569
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:49,350
carbohydrate
what i would be interested in is like

6570
01:37:49,350 --> 01:37:49,360
what i would be interested in is like
 

6571
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:50,709
what i would be interested in is like
you have let's say we have someone with

6572
01:37:50,709 --> 01:37:50,719
you have let's say we have someone with
 

6573
01:37:50,719 --> 01:37:51,910
you have let's say we have someone with
equal talent

6574
01:37:51,910 --> 01:37:51,920
equal talent
 

6575
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:54,870
equal talent
but got weeded out along the way

6576
01:37:54,870 --> 01:37:54,880
but got weeded out along the way
 

6577
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:56,310
but got weeded out along the way
potentially because

6578
01:37:56,310 --> 01:37:56,320
potentially because
 

6579
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:57,430
potentially because
for whatever reason they just weren't

6580
01:37:57,430 --> 01:37:57,440
for whatever reason they just weren't
 

6581
01:37:57,440 --> 01:37:59,270
for whatever reason they just weren't
able to tolerate like the both the

6582
01:37:59,270 --> 01:37:59,280
able to tolerate like the both the
 

6583
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:00,550
able to tolerate like the both the
training and the nutrition requirements

6584
01:38:00,550 --> 01:38:00,560
training and the nutrition requirements
 

6585
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:01,830
training and the nutrition requirements
that they're being told to do so the

6586
01:38:01,830 --> 01:38:01,840
that they're being told to do so the
 

6587
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:03,189
that they're being told to do so the
coach is kind there's a culture where

6588
01:38:03,189 --> 01:38:03,199
coach is kind there's a culture where
 

6589
01:38:03,199 --> 01:38:04,790
coach is kind there's a culture where
the coaches would really push a carb

6590
01:38:04,790 --> 01:38:04,800
the coaches would really push a carb
 

6591
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:05,590
the coaches would really push a carb
heavy diet

6592
01:38:05,590 --> 01:38:05,600
heavy diet
 

6593
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:07,990
heavy diet
and that that would in itself would do

6594
01:38:07,990 --> 01:38:08,000
and that that would in itself would do
 

6595
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,270
and that that would in itself would do
the filtering process

6596
01:38:09,270 --> 01:38:09,280
the filtering process
 

6597
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:12,470
the filtering process
of people that are not

6598
01:38:12,470 --> 01:38:12,480
of people that are not
 

6599
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:13,830
of people that are not
it would filter out the people that are

6600
01:38:13,830 --> 01:38:13,840
it would filter out the people that are
 

6601
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:15,590
it would filter out the people that are
not able to tolerate carbs

6602
01:38:15,590 --> 01:38:15,600
not able to tolerate carbs
 

6603
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:17,270
not able to tolerate carbs
as part of their training i mean i might

6604
01:38:17,270 --> 01:38:17,280
as part of their training i mean i might
 

6605
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:19,189
as part of their training i mean i might
be an example of this actually where

6606
01:38:19,189 --> 01:38:19,199
be an example of this actually where
 

6607
01:38:19,199 --> 01:38:21,990
be an example of this actually where
you know you take someone where uh they

6608
01:38:21,990 --> 01:38:22,000
you know you take someone where uh they
 

6609
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,109
you know you take someone where uh they
for whatever reason the carbs aren't

6610
01:38:23,109 --> 01:38:23,119
for whatever reason the carbs aren't
 

6611
01:38:23,119 --> 01:38:24,790
for whatever reason the carbs aren't
working for them like it's unsustainable

6612
01:38:24,790 --> 01:38:24,800
working for them like it's unsustainable
 

6613
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:26,310
working for them like it's unsustainable
for them to continue that path or if

6614
01:38:26,310 --> 01:38:26,320
for them to continue that path or if
 

6615
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:27,510
for them to continue that path or if
they do they might have a shortened

6616
01:38:27,510 --> 01:38:27,520
they do they might have a shortened
 

6617
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:28,790
they do they might have a shortened
career so they might be able to eke out

6618
01:38:28,790 --> 01:38:28,800
career so they might be able to eke out
 

6619
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:29,990
career so they might be able to eke out
a few really good years but then you

6620
01:38:29,990 --> 01:38:30,000
a few really good years but then you
 

6621
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:30,870
a few really good years but then you
know they're not going to be the person

6622
01:38:30,870 --> 01:38:30,880
know they're not going to be the person
 

6623
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:32,310
know they're not going to be the person
they're like wow that person's

6624
01:38:32,310 --> 01:38:32,320
they're like wow that person's
 

6625
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:33,910
they're like wow that person's
38 and they're still competing at the

6626
01:38:33,910 --> 01:38:33,920
38 and they're still competing at the
 

6627
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:36,149
38 and they're still competing at the
olympics type of a person yeah

6628
01:38:36,149 --> 01:38:36,159
olympics type of a person yeah
 

6629
01:38:36,159 --> 01:38:38,390
olympics type of a person yeah
and you know you you put them on a low

6630
01:38:38,390 --> 01:38:38,400
and you know you you put them on a low
 

6631
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:39,270
and you know you you put them on a low
carb diet

6632
01:38:39,270 --> 01:38:39,280
carb diet
 

6633
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:41,430
carb diet
uh if you can control everything else

6634
01:38:41,430 --> 01:38:41,440
uh if you can control everything else
 

6635
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:43,109
uh if you can control everything else
like their entire lifestyle is based

6636
01:38:43,109 --> 01:38:43,119
like their entire lifestyle is based
 

6637
01:38:43,119 --> 01:38:45,270
like their entire lifestyle is based
around training and racing

6638
01:38:45,270 --> 01:38:45,280
around training and racing
 

6639
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:48,550
around training and racing
then uh you know they may still

6640
01:38:48,550 --> 01:38:48,560
then uh you know they may still
 

6641
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:51,350
then uh you know they may still
have better potential by introducing

6642
01:38:51,350 --> 01:38:51,360
have better potential by introducing
 

6643
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:52,709
have better potential by introducing
carbohydrates

6644
01:38:52,709 --> 01:38:52,719
carbohydrates
 

6645
01:38:52,719 --> 01:38:55,189
carbohydrates
at a higher level but if that's not

6646
01:38:55,189 --> 01:38:55,199
at a higher level but if that's not
 

6647
01:38:55,199 --> 01:38:55,830
at a higher level but if that's not
gonna

6648
01:38:55,830 --> 01:38:55,840
gonna
 

6649
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:57,350
gonna
if that's not gonna be sustainable for

6650
01:38:57,350 --> 01:38:57,360
if that's not gonna be sustainable for
 

6651
01:38:57,360 --> 01:38:58,870
if that's not gonna be sustainable for
them as a person

6652
01:38:58,870 --> 01:38:58,880
them as a person
 

6653
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:01,030
them as a person
then you know what's the point kind of

6654
01:39:01,030 --> 01:39:01,040
then you know what's the point kind of
 

6655
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:03,270
then you know what's the point kind of
at that unless they want to be like a

6656
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:03,280
at that unless they want to be like a
 

6657
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:05,590
at that unless they want to be like a
kind of a spark in the pan so to speak i

6658
01:39:05,590 --> 01:39:05,600
kind of a spark in the pan so to speak i
 

6659
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:06,550
kind of a spark in the pan so to speak i
just feel good

6660
01:39:06,550 --> 01:39:06,560
just feel good
 

6661
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:09,189
just feel good
eating meat performance wise well i

6662
01:39:09,189 --> 01:39:09,199
eating meat performance wise well i
 

6663
01:39:09,199 --> 01:39:10,629
eating meat performance wise well i
think there's that group too

6664
01:39:10,629 --> 01:39:10,639
think there's that group too
 

6665
01:39:10,639 --> 01:39:13,109
think there's that group too
and they may just not be the olympians

6666
01:39:13,109 --> 01:39:13,119
and they may just not be the olympians
 

6667
01:39:13,119 --> 01:39:15,510
and they may just not be the olympians
yeah and so we're not talking

6668
01:39:15,510 --> 01:39:15,520
yeah and so we're not talking
 

6669
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:16,950
yeah and so we're not talking
i guess this conversation has several

6670
01:39:16,950 --> 01:39:16,960
i guess this conversation has several
 

6671
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:18,950
i guess this conversation has several
layers one is for the olympics

6672
01:39:18,950 --> 01:39:18,960
layers one is for the olympics
 

6673
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:21,990
layers one is for the olympics
and one is for like

6674
01:39:21,990 --> 01:39:22,000
and one is for like
 

6675
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:25,510
and one is for like
what is it active athletes

6676
01:39:25,510 --> 01:39:25,520
what is it active athletes
 

6677
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:27,510
what is it active athletes
they're like amateurs whatever whatever

6678
01:39:27,510 --> 01:39:27,520

or mostly meat yeah what have you
learned about this

6698

learned about this
 

6699
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:52,629
learned about this
yeah i think uh so for for some context

6700
01:39:52,629 --> 01:39:52,639
yeah i think uh so for for some context
 

6701
01:39:52,639 --> 01:39:53,510
yeah i think uh so for for some context
like i followed

6702
01:39:53,510 --> 01:39:53,520
like i followed
 

6703
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:55,030
like i followed
what i would call a low carbohydrate

6704
01:39:55,030 --> 01:39:55,040
what i would call a low carbohydrate
 

6705
01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:56,709
what i would call a low carbohydrate
diet for the last 10 years

6706
01:39:56,709 --> 01:39:56,719
diet for the last 10 years
 

6707
01:39:56,719 --> 01:39:59,189
diet for the last 10 years
and just like kind of the training i

6708
01:39:59,189 --> 01:39:59,199
and just like kind of the training i
 

6709
01:39:59,199 --> 01:40:01,030
and just like kind of the training i
periodize it to a degree where there are

6710
01:40:01,030 --> 01:40:01,040
periodize it to a degree where there are
 

6711
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:02,550
periodize it to a degree where there are
parts of my training where i do bring

6712
01:40:02,550 --> 01:40:02,560
parts of my training where i do bring
 

6713
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:04,310
parts of my training where i do bring
back a little more carbohydrate

6714
01:40:04,310 --> 01:40:04,320
back a little more carbohydrate
 

6715
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:05,430
back a little more carbohydrate
and there's periods of my training

6716
01:40:05,430 --> 01:40:05,440
and there's periods of my training
 

6717
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:06,470
and there's periods of my training
especially like the off season where i'm

6718
01:40:06,470 --> 01:40:06,480
especially like the off season where i'm
 

6719
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:08,149
especially like the off season where i'm
like very low and i might be like

6720
01:40:08,149 --> 01:40:08,159
like very low and i might be like
 

6721
01:40:08,159 --> 01:40:10,550
like very low and i might be like
kind of in that ballpark of uh like you

6722
01:40:10,550 --> 01:40:10,560
kind of in that ballpark of uh like you
 

6723
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:12,470
kind of in that ballpark of uh like you
know ketogenic strict ketogenic or no

what's what's a strict low carb diet
 

6733
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:20,629
what's what's a strict low carb diet
i've ranged everywhere from like mostly

01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:43,109
longer lasting
uh from my personal experience of like

6758
01:40:43,109 --> 01:40:43,119
uh from my personal experience of like
 

6759
01:40:43,119 --> 01:40:43,910
uh from my personal experience of like
being like

6760
01:40:43,910 --> 01:40:43,920
being like
 

6761
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:46,310
being like
either in like the animal food camp or

6762
01:40:46,310 --> 01:40:46,320
either in like the animal food camp or
 

6763
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:48,310
either in like the animal food camp or
like the plant based camp kind of of a

6764
01:40:48,310 --> 01:40:48,320
like the plant based camp kind of of a
 

6765
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:49,350
like the plant based camp kind of of a
process

6766
01:40:49,350 --> 01:40:49,360
process
 

6767
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:51,109
process
um so i've tried all of them things that

6768
01:40:51,109 --> 01:40:51,119
um so i've tried all of them things that
 

6769
01:40:51,119 --> 01:40:52,870
um so i've tried all of them things that
stayed consistent over the 10 years is

6770
01:40:52,870 --> 01:40:52,880
stayed consistent over the 10 years is
 

6771
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:54,629
stayed consistent over the 10 years is
kind of the macronutrient profile

6772
01:40:54,629 --> 01:40:54,639
kind of the macronutrient profile
 

6773
01:40:54,639 --> 01:40:56,229
kind of the macronutrient profile
that i've done throughout the course so

6774
01:40:56,229 --> 01:40:56,239
that i've done throughout the course so
 

6775
01:40:56,239 --> 01:40:57,669
that i've done throughout the course so
one didn't win over the other in terms

6776
01:40:57,669 --> 01:40:57,679
one didn't win over the other in terms
 

6777
01:40:57,679 --> 01:40:59,430
one didn't win over the other in terms
of meat based versus plant-based oh for

6778
01:40:59,430 --> 01:40:59,440
of meat based versus plant-based oh for
 

6779
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:00,790
of meat based versus plant-based oh for
me meat based definitely

6780
01:41:00,790 --> 01:41:00,800
me meat based definitely
 

6781
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:02,950
me meat based definitely
was i mean i was i was my highest meat

6782
01:41:02,950 --> 01:41:02,960
was i mean i was i was my highest meat
 

6783
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:04,950
was i mean i was i was my highest meat
consumption in 2019 and that was by far

6784
01:41:04,950 --> 01:41:04,960
consumption in 2019 and that was by far
 

6785
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:06,470
consumption in 2019 and that was by far
my best racing season

6786
01:41:06,470 --> 01:41:06,480
my best racing season
 

6787
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:08,470
my best racing season
yeah we keep coming back to that year

6788
01:41:08,470 --> 01:41:08,480
yeah we keep coming back to that year
 

6789
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:10,070
yeah we keep coming back to that year
that was a good year for many reasons

6790
01:41:10,070 --> 01:41:10,080
that was a good year for many reasons
 

6791
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:11,830
that was a good year for many reasons
philosophically and nutritionally

6792
01:41:11,830 --> 01:41:11,840
philosophically and nutritionally
 

6793
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:13,510
philosophically and nutritionally
yeah only 2020 happened and now i

6794
01:41:13,510 --> 01:41:13,520
yeah only 2020 happened and now i
 

6795
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:15,910
yeah only 2020 happened and now i
haven't had a really good chance to

6796
01:41:15,910 --> 01:41:15,920
haven't had a really good chance to
 

6797
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:18,310
haven't had a really good chance to
improve we'll see hopefully i've got

6798
01:41:18,310 --> 01:41:18,320
improve we'll see hopefully i've got
 

6799
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:18,950
improve we'll see hopefully i've got
some more

6800
01:41:18,950 --> 01:41:18,960
some more
 

6801
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:20,470
some more
yeah some more in the tank that's

6802
01:41:20,470 --> 01:41:20,480
yeah some more in the tank that's
 

6803
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:22,629
yeah some more in the tank that's
strange there's so most athletes that

6804
01:41:22,629 --> 01:41:22,639
strange there's so most athletes that
 

6805
01:41:22,639 --> 01:41:24,790
strange there's so most athletes that
compete at your level

6806
01:41:24,790 --> 01:41:24,800
compete at your level
 

6807
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:27,109
compete at your level
have more carbs integrated into their

6808
01:41:27,109 --> 01:41:27,119
have more carbs integrated into their
 

6809
01:41:27,119 --> 01:41:27,910
have more carbs integrated into their
diets

6810
01:41:27,910 --> 01:41:27,920
diets
 

6811
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:29,910
diets
so what have you learned about using

6812
01:41:29,910 --> 01:41:29,920
so what have you learned about using
 

6813
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:32,149
so what have you learned about using
meat in high performance

6814
01:41:32,149 --> 01:41:32,159
meat in high performance
 

6815
01:41:32,159 --> 01:41:34,390
meat in high performance
i think it's maybe less about the meat

6816
01:41:34,390 --> 01:41:34,400
i think it's maybe less about the meat
 

6817
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:35,350
i think it's maybe less about the meat
and it's more about

6818
01:41:35,350 --> 01:41:35,360
and it's more about
 

6819
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:37,990
and it's more about
like what are you what is it replacing

6820
01:41:37,990 --> 01:41:38,000
like what are you what is it replacing
 

6821
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:38,870
like what are you what is it replacing
so

6822
01:41:38,870 --> 01:41:38,880
so
 

6823
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:41,910
so
if we go if we step away from like me

6824
01:41:41,910 --> 01:41:41,920
if we go if we step away from like me
 

6825
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:43,430
if we go if we step away from like me
specifically

6826
01:41:43,430 --> 01:41:43,440
specifically
 

6827
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:45,030
specifically
and just like the people that because i

6828

and just like the people that because i
 

6829
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:46,390
and just like the people that because i

6830
01:41:46,390 --> 01:41:46,400
mean we're getting to the point i get
 

6831
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:47,910
mean we're getting to the point i get
it's anecdotes but like

6832
01:41:47,910 --> 01:41:47,920
it's anecdotes but like
 

6833
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:49,270
it's anecdotes but like
like that's what we have at the moment

01:41:50,719 --> 01:41:51,830
because there's i mean there is actually
a study being done on

6838
01:41:51,830 --> 01:41:51,840
a study being done on
 

6839
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:53,750
a study being done on
like i think i guess they call it hyper

6840
01:41:53,750 --> 01:41:53,760
like i think i guess they call it hyper
 

6841
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:55,350
like i think i guess they call it hyper
carnivore where they're like

6842
01:41:55,350 --> 01:41:55,360
carnivore where they're like
 

6843
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:56,950
carnivore where they're like
i think above 80 percent of their intake

6844
01:41:56,950 --> 01:41:56,960
i think above 80 percent of their intake
 

6845
01:41:56,960 --> 01:41:58,870
i think above 80 percent of their intake
from meat um

6846
01:41:58,870 --> 01:41:58,880
from meat um
 

6847
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:00,149
from meat um
and they're looking at a few different

6848
01:42:00,149 --> 01:42:00,159
and they're looking at a few different
 

6849
01:42:00,159 --> 01:42:02,310
and they're looking at a few different
things there but it's so weird and i

6850
01:42:02,310 --> 01:42:02,320
things there but it's so weird and i
 

6851
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:04,550
things there but it's so weird and i
keep interrupting but it's so weird that

6852
01:42:04,550 --> 01:42:04,560
keep interrupting but it's so weird that
 

6853
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:06,390
keep interrupting but it's so weird that
it sounds unhealthy

6854
01:42:06,390 --> 01:42:06,400
it sounds unhealthy
 

6855
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:08,709
it sounds unhealthy
uh hyper carnivore yeah but it makes me

6856
01:42:08,709 --> 01:42:08,719
uh hyper carnivore yeah but it makes me
 

6857
01:42:08,719 --> 01:42:10,470
uh hyper carnivore yeah but it makes me
feel really good

6858
01:42:10,470 --> 01:42:10,480
feel really good
 

6859
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:13,990
feel really good
so it's the individual thing right yeah

6860
01:42:13,990 --> 01:42:14,000
so it's the individual thing right yeah
 

6861
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:17,030
so it's the individual thing right yeah
there's countless people now who like

6862
01:42:17,030 --> 01:42:17,040
there's countless people now who like
 

6863
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:18,629
there's countless people now who like
and i'm not saying that they could not

6864
01:42:18,629 --> 01:42:18,639
and i'm not saying that they could not
 

6865
01:42:18,639 --> 01:42:20,629
and i'm not saying that they could not
have found another route myself included

6866
01:42:20,629 --> 01:42:20,639
have found another route myself included
 

6867
01:42:20,639 --> 01:42:20,950
have found another route myself included
like

6868
01:42:20,950 --> 01:42:20,960
like
 

6869
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:23,109
like
in 2011 when i switched from moderate to

6870
01:42:23,109 --> 01:42:23,119
in 2011 when i switched from moderate to
 

6871
01:42:23,119 --> 01:42:24,870
in 2011 when i switched from moderate to
high carbohydrate low carbohydrate

6872
01:42:24,870 --> 01:42:24,880
high carbohydrate low carbohydrate
 

6873
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:27,510
high carbohydrate low carbohydrate
and saw some very noticeable differences

6874
01:42:27,510 --> 01:42:27,520
and saw some very noticeable differences
 

6875
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:28,070
and saw some very noticeable differences
in the way i

6876
01:42:28,070 --> 01:42:28,080
in the way i
 

6877
01:42:28,080 --> 01:42:30,629
in the way i
felt the way i performed in all this

6878
01:42:30,629 --> 01:42:30,639
felt the way i performed in all this
 

6879
01:42:30,639 --> 01:42:31,189
felt the way i performed in all this
stuff

6880
01:42:31,189 --> 01:42:31,199
stuff
 

6881
01:42:31,199 --> 01:42:32,870
stuff
that doesn't mean that there wasn't

6882
01:42:32,870 --> 01:42:32,880
that doesn't mean that there wasn't
 

6883
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:34,790
that doesn't mean that there wasn't
another path i just did not find that

6884
01:42:34,790 --> 01:42:34,800
another path i just did not find that
 

6885
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:36,470
another path i just did not find that
path and

6886
01:42:36,470 --> 01:42:36,480
path and
 

6887
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:39,750
path and
the the the fact that i found a path

6888
01:42:39,750 --> 01:42:39,760
the the the fact that i found a path
 

6889
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:40,070
the the the fact that i found a path
that

6890
01:42:40,070 --> 01:42:40,080
that
 

6891
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:41,830
that
was producing the results i was looking

6892
01:42:41,830 --> 01:42:41,840
was producing the results i was looking
 

6893
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:43,350
was producing the results i was looking
for is really all that matters in my

6894
01:42:43,350 --> 01:42:43,360
for is really all that matters in my
 

6895
01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:44,709
for is really all that matters in my
mind you know like

6896
01:42:44,709 --> 01:42:44,719
mind you know like
 

6897
01:42:44,719 --> 01:42:45,669
mind you know like
i don't really care if there was a

6898
01:42:45,669 --> 01:42:45,679
i don't really care if there was a
 

6899
01:42:45,679 --> 01:42:48,149
i don't really care if there was a
parallel path that works just as well or

6900
01:42:48,149 --> 01:42:48,159
parallel path that works just as well or
 

6901
01:42:48,159 --> 01:42:51,030
parallel path that works just as well or
you know something like that because

6902
01:42:51,030 --> 01:42:51,040
you know something like that because
 

6903
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:52,870
you know something like that because
ultimately we only have one shot at

6904
01:42:52,870 --> 01:42:52,880
ultimately we only have one shot at
 

6905
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:54,310
ultimately we only have one shot at
everything we're doing so like

6906
01:42:54,310 --> 01:42:54,320
everything we're doing so like
 

6907
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:55,910
everything we're doing so like
it'd be great if i could go back and try

6908
01:42:55,910 --> 01:42:55,920
it'd be great if i could go back and try
 

6909
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:57,109
it'd be great if i could go back and try
four or five different things well the

6910
01:42:57,109 --> 01:42:57,119
four or five different things well the
 

6911
01:42:57,119 --> 01:42:58,149
four or five different things well the
annoying thing is

6912
01:42:58,149 --> 01:42:58,159
annoying thing is
 

6913
01:42:58,159 --> 01:43:00,229
annoying thing is
that the the body adjusts to whatever

6914
01:43:00,229 --> 01:43:00,239
that the the body adjusts to whatever
 

6915
01:43:00,239 --> 01:43:01,350
that the the body adjusts to whatever
the heck you're doing so

6916
01:43:01,350 --> 01:43:01,360
the heck you're doing so
 

6917
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:02,870
the heck you're doing so
you can't it's hard to do good science

6918
01:43:02,870 --> 01:43:02,880
you can't it's hard to do good science
 

6919
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:04,470
you can't it's hard to do good science
even on yourself yeah i've referenced my

6920
01:43:04,470 --> 01:43:04,480
even on yourself yeah i've referenced my
 

6921
01:43:04,480 --> 01:43:06,550
even on yourself yeah i've referenced my
2019 racing season a few times and it's

6922
01:43:06,550 --> 01:43:06,560
2019 racing season a few times and it's
 

6923
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:08,470
2019 racing season a few times and it's
like it'd be silly for me to put all of

6924
01:43:08,470 --> 01:43:08,480
like it'd be silly for me to put all of
 

6925
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:10,229
like it'd be silly for me to put all of
the emphasis on my nutrition plan for

6926
01:43:10,229 --> 01:43:10,239
the emphasis on my nutrition plan for
 

6927
01:43:10,239 --> 01:43:12,550
the emphasis on my nutrition plan for
that because it also comes with

6928
01:43:12,550 --> 01:43:12,560
that because it also comes with
 

6929
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:14,629
that because it also comes with
two decades of endurance training so

6930
01:43:14,629 --> 01:43:14,639
two decades of endurance training so
 

6931
01:43:14,639 --> 01:43:16,629
two decades of endurance training so
it's possible and it's very likely that

6932
01:43:16,629 --> 01:43:16,639
it's possible and it's very likely that
 

6933
01:43:16,639 --> 01:43:18,390
it's possible and it's very likely that
a huge portion of that success was just

6934
01:43:18,390 --> 01:43:18,400
a huge portion of that success was just
 

6935
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:20,149
a huge portion of that success was just
the culmination of a lot of work over

6936
01:43:20,149 --> 01:43:20,159
the culmination of a lot of work over
 

6937
01:43:20,159 --> 01:43:22,070
the culmination of a lot of work over
time from the training side of things

6938
01:43:22,070 --> 01:43:22,080
time from the training side of things
 

6939
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:23,910
time from the training side of things
i just think like any time you hyper

6940
01:43:23,910 --> 01:43:23,920
i just think like any time you hyper
 

6941
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:25,189
i just think like any time you hyper
focus on one

6942
01:43:25,189 --> 01:43:25,199
focus on one
 

6943
01:43:25,199 --> 01:43:27,910
focus on one
area or pick a couple variables and just

6944
01:43:27,910 --> 01:43:27,920
area or pick a couple variables and just
 

6945
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:28,950
area or pick a couple variables and just
target those

6946
01:43:28,950 --> 01:43:28,960
target those
 

6947
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:30,550
target those
you find yourself in a position where

6948
01:43:30,550 --> 01:43:30,560
you find yourself in a position where
 

6949
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:32,629
you find yourself in a position where
you are you're putting other things in

6950
01:43:32,629 --> 01:43:32,639
you are you're putting other things in
 

6951
01:43:32,639 --> 01:43:35,430
you are you're putting other things in
the most uncharitable light possible

6952
01:43:35,430 --> 01:43:35,440
the most uncharitable light possible
 

6953
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:37,750
the most uncharitable light possible
so so then you have this situation where

6954
01:43:37,750 --> 01:43:37,760
so so then you have this situation where
 

6955
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:39,750
so so then you have this situation where
like it's actually a combination of a

6956
01:43:39,750 --> 01:43:39,760
like it's actually a combination of a
 

6957
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:41,350
like it's actually a combination of a
variety of different things so where are

6958
01:43:41,350 --> 01:43:41,360
variety of different things so where are
 

6959
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:42,390
variety of different things so where are
the big movers

6960
01:43:42,390 --> 01:43:42,400
the big movers
 

6961
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:45,109
the big movers
and you know for me nutritional shift

6962
01:43:45,109 --> 01:43:45,119
and you know for me nutritional shift
 

6963
01:43:45,119 --> 01:43:46,790
and you know for me nutritional shift
was pretty clear that that improved my

6964
01:43:46,790 --> 01:43:46,800
was pretty clear that that improved my
 

6965
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:48,790
was pretty clear that that improved my
sleep in my recovery

6966
01:43:48,790 --> 01:43:48,800
sleep in my recovery
 

6967
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:51,510
sleep in my recovery
and i mean people can say well there's

6968
01:43:51,510 --> 01:43:51,520
and i mean people can say well there's
 

6969
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:51,990
and i mean people can say well there's
the placebo

6970
01:43:51,990 --> 01:43:52,000
the placebo
 

6971
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,390
the placebo
effect which is a very real concern but

6972
01:43:54,390 --> 01:43:54,400
effect which is a very real concern but
 

6973
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:56,310
effect which is a very real concern but
you know for me personally a 10-year

6974
01:43:56,310 --> 01:43:56,320
you know for me personally a 10-year
 

6975
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:57,669
you know for me personally a 10-year
placebo effect would be a

6976
01:43:57,669 --> 01:43:57,679
placebo effect would be a
 

6977
01:43:57,679 --> 01:44:00,950
placebo effect would be a
quite lengthy placebo effect and

6978
01:44:00,950 --> 01:44:00,960
quite lengthy placebo effect and
 

6979
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:02,709
quite lengthy placebo effect and
i do think it's individual though i i

6980
01:44:02,709 --> 01:44:02,719
i do think it's individual though i i
 

6981
01:44:02,719 --> 01:44:04,149
i do think it's individual though i i
emphasize that a lot because i mean i've

6982
01:44:04,149 --> 01:44:04,159
emphasize that a lot because i mean i've
 

6983
01:44:04,159 --> 01:44:05,910
emphasize that a lot because i mean i've
worked with tons of people with this and

6984
01:44:05,910 --> 01:44:05,920
worked with tons of people with this and
 

6985
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:07,270
worked with tons of people with this and
i do see a range

6986
01:44:07,270 --> 01:44:07,280
i do see a range
 

6987
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:08,790
i do see a range
from person to person i've worked with

6988
01:44:08,790 --> 01:44:08,800
from person to person i've worked with
 

6989
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:10,870
from person to person i've worked with
people who come to me

6990
01:44:10,870 --> 01:44:10,880
people who come to me
 

6991
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:13,030
people who come to me
and they're like strict keto and we

6992
01:44:13,030 --> 01:44:13,040
and they're like strict keto and we
 

6993
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:15,030
and they're like strict keto and we
raise up their carbohydrates a bit

6994
01:44:15,030 --> 01:44:15,040

brought back a little bit of
 

7017
01:44:32,239 --> 01:44:33,189
brought back a little bit of
carbohydrate

7018
01:44:33,189 --> 01:44:33,199
carbohydrate
 

7019
01:44:33,199 --> 01:44:34,310
carbohydrate
and then they go and they nail the

7020
01:44:34,310 --> 01:44:34,320
and then they go and they nail the
 

7021
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:36,470
and then they go and they nail the
workout and i'm just like baffled that

7022
01:44:36,470 --> 01:44:36,480
workout and i'm just like baffled that
 

7023
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:37,510
workout and i'm just like baffled that
because because they're different from

7024
01:44:37,510 --> 01:44:37,520
because because they're different from
 

7025
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:39,189
because because they're different from
me and every time you know when you have

7026
01:44:39,189 --> 01:44:39,199
me and every time you know when you have
 

7027
01:44:39,199 --> 01:44:41,189
me and every time you know when you have
your own personal experience

7028
01:44:41,189 --> 01:44:41,199
your own personal experience
 

7029
01:44:41,199 --> 01:44:43,430
your own personal experience
the first the kind of guttural response

7030
01:44:43,430 --> 01:44:43,440
the first the kind of guttural response
 

7031
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:45,189
the first the kind of guttural response
is oh if i had done it would have gone

7032
01:44:45,189 --> 01:44:45,199
is oh if i had done it would have gone
 

7033
01:44:45,199 --> 01:44:46,310
is oh if i had done it would have gone
this way why did it go completely

7034
01:44:46,310 --> 01:44:46,320
this way why did it go completely
 

7035
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:47,590
this way why did it go completely
opposite way for them

7036
01:44:47,590 --> 01:44:47,600
opposite way for them
 

7037
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:48,709
opposite way for them
and you kind of have to just kind of

7038
01:44:48,709 --> 01:44:48,719
and you kind of have to just kind of
 

7039
01:44:48,719 --> 01:44:50,470
and you kind of have to just kind of
step out of your own perspective a bit

7040
01:44:50,470 --> 01:44:50,480
step out of your own perspective a bit
 

7041
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:51,830
step out of your own perspective a bit
and say like okay well

7042
01:44:51,830 --> 01:44:51,840
and say like okay well
 

7043
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:53,830
and say like okay well
they're different you know for whatever

7044
01:44:53,830 --> 01:44:53,840
they're different you know for whatever
 

7045
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:55,109
they're different you know for whatever
reason they're getting

7046
01:44:55,109 --> 01:44:55,119
reason they're getting
 

7047
01:44:55,119 --> 01:44:57,830
reason they're getting
getting along like this i've had like

7048
01:44:57,830 --> 01:44:57,840
getting along like this i've had like
 

7049
01:44:57,840 --> 01:44:59,270
getting along like this i've had like
several moments in my life where you

7050
01:44:59,270 --> 01:44:59,280
several moments in my life where you
 

7051
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:01,189
several moments in my life where you
kind of realized

7052
01:45:01,189 --> 01:45:01,199
kind of realized
 

7053
01:45:01,199 --> 01:45:03,430
kind of realized
the body is weird and it's weirder than

7054
01:45:03,430 --> 01:45:03,440
the body is weird and it's weirder than
 

7055
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:05,830
the body is weird and it's weirder than
the average advice like one of them is

7056
01:45:05,830 --> 01:45:05,840
the average advice like one of them is
 

7057
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:09,350
the average advice like one of them is
how well i perform for my own standards

when i fast uh first of all
intellectually but that's more known and

7062
01:45:14,629 --> 01:45:14,639
intellectually but that's more known and
 

7063
01:45:14,639 --> 01:45:17,430
intellectually but that's more known and
and understandable but like physically

7064
01:45:17,430 --> 01:45:17,440
and understandable but like physically
 

7065
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:18,870
and understandable but like physically
yeah the fact that i could train

7066
01:45:18,870 --> 01:45:18,880
yeah the fact that i could train
 

7067
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:21,990
yeah the fact that i could train
like not eat 20 hours 24 hours and then

7068
01:45:21,990 --> 01:45:22,000
like not eat 20 hours 24 hours and then
 

7069
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:23,669
like not eat 20 hours 24 hours and then
do a hard

7070
01:45:23,669 --> 01:45:23,679
do a hard
 

7071
01:45:23,679 --> 01:45:25,830
do a hard
like jiu jitsu session for like two

7072
01:45:25,830 --> 01:45:25,840
like jiu jitsu session for like two
 

7073
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:26,790
like jiu jitsu session for like two
hours

7074
01:45:26,790 --> 01:45:26,800
hours
 

7075
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:29,750
hours
like hard it's incredible to me like

7076
01:45:29,750 --> 01:45:29,760
like hard it's incredible to me like
 

7077
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:29,990
like hard it's incredible to me like
this

7078
01:45:29,990 --> 01:45:30,000
this
 

7079
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:31,669
this
makes no sense because i used to eat

7080
01:45:31,669 --> 01:45:31,679
makes no sense because i used to eat
 

7081
01:45:31,679 --> 01:45:34,149
makes no sense because i used to eat
like many times a day

7082
01:45:34,149 --> 01:45:34,159
like many times a day
 

7083
01:45:34,159 --> 01:45:35,669
like many times a day
of course you have to eat like you don't

7084
01:45:35,669 --> 01:45:35,679
of course you have to eat like you don't
 

7085
01:45:35,679 --> 01:45:36,870
of course you have to eat like you don't
want to eat too close to the training

7086
01:45:36,870 --> 01:45:36,880
want to eat too close to the training
 

7087
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:38,390
want to eat too close to the training
session what's my thinking

7088
01:45:38,390 --> 01:45:38,400
session what's my thinking
 

7089
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:39,990
session what's my thinking
but you definitely need to load up on

7090
01:45:39,990 --> 01:45:40,000
but you definitely need to load up on
 

7091
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,430
but you definitely need to load up on
carbs like three hours before

7092
01:45:41,430 --> 01:45:41,440
carbs like three hours before
 

7093
01:45:41,440 --> 01:45:43,350
carbs like three hours before
like in order to have enough energy the

7094
01:45:43,350 --> 01:45:43,360
like in order to have enough energy the
 

7095
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:44,950
like in order to have enough energy the
fact that he could not eat

7096
01:45:44,950 --> 01:45:44,960
fact that he could not eat
 

7097
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:48,310
fact that he could not eat
and have like incredible focus but also

7098
01:45:48,310 --> 01:45:48,320
and have like incredible focus but also
 

7099
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:50,550
and have like incredible focus but also
athleticism like both

7100
01:45:50,550 --> 01:45:50,560
athleticism like both
 

7101
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:53,189
athleticism like both
endurance and explosive i mean jiu-jitsu

endurance and explosive i mean jiu-jitsu
 

7103
01:45:53,199 --> 01:45:55,109
endurance and explosive i mean jiu-jitsu
is a special thing it's like more like

7104
01:45:55,109 --> 01:45:55,119
is a special thing it's like more like
 

7105
01:45:55,119 --> 01:45:57,109
is a special thing it's like more like
chess yeah it's not like power lifting

7106
01:45:57,109 --> 01:45:57,119
chess yeah it's not like power lifting
 

7107
01:45:57,119 --> 01:45:59,270
chess yeah it's not like power lifting
no not power lifting olympic lifting

7108
01:45:59,270 --> 01:45:59,280
no not power lifting olympic lifting
 

7109
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:02,070
no not power lifting olympic lifting
where it's like true explosiveness but

7110
01:46:02,070 --> 01:46:02,080
where it's like true explosiveness but
 

7111
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:03,590
where it's like true explosiveness but
that's fascinating and it makes me

7112
01:46:03,590 --> 01:46:03,600
that's fascinating and it makes me
 

7113
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:05,030
that's fascinating and it makes me
wonder like what other things

7114
01:46:05,030 --> 01:46:05,040
wonder like what other things
 

7115
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:08,149
wonder like what other things
are there to to um to discover about

7116
01:46:08,149 --> 01:46:08,159
are there to to um to discover about
 

7117
01:46:08,159 --> 01:46:09,030
are there to to um to discover about
yourself

7118
01:46:09,030 --> 01:46:09,040
yourself
 

7119
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:10,870
yourself
the the annoying thing about food is

7120
01:46:10,870 --> 01:46:10,880
the the annoying thing about food is
 

7121
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:12,550
the the annoying thing about food is
it's delicious

7122
01:46:12,550 --> 01:46:12,560
it's delicious
 

7123
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:14,550
it's delicious
and so it's hard to do good science on

7124
01:46:14,550 --> 01:46:14,560
and so it's hard to do good science on
 

7125
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:16,470
and so it's hard to do good science on
yourself like to do

7126
01:46:16,470 --> 01:46:16,480
yourself like to do
 

7127
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:19,030
yourself like to do
you know for two weeks or a month to do

7128
01:46:19,030 --> 01:46:19,040
you know for two weeks or a month to do
 

7129
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:19,590
you know for two weeks or a month to do
like

7130
01:46:19,590 --> 01:46:19,600
like
 

7131
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:22,790
like
strict no carbs and then maybe next

7132
01:46:22,790 --> 01:46:22,800
strict no carbs and then maybe next
 

7133
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:23,750
strict no carbs and then maybe next
month you add

7134
01:46:23,750 --> 01:46:23,760
month you add
 

7135
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:25,830
month you add
20 grams or 40 grams of carbs and see

7136
01:46:25,830 --> 01:46:25,840
20 grams or 40 grams of carbs and see
 

7137
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:26,950
20 grams or 40 grams of carbs and see
how you actually feel

7138
01:46:26,950 --> 01:46:26,960
how you actually feel
 

7139
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:29,350
how you actually feel
right not like in that moment but over a

7140
01:46:29,350 --> 01:46:29,360
right not like in that moment but over a
 

7141
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:30,950
right not like in that moment but over a
period of several weeks

7142
01:46:30,950 --> 01:46:30,960
period of several weeks
 

7143
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:32,629
period of several weeks
and then doing everything else like

7144
01:46:32,629 --> 01:46:32,639
and then doing everything else like
 

7145
01:46:32,639 --> 01:46:34,229
and then doing everything else like
right with based on

7146
01:46:34,229 --> 01:46:34,239
right with based on
 

7147
01:46:34,239 --> 01:46:35,830
right with based on
best available science like with the

7148
01:46:35,830 --> 01:46:35,840
best available science like with the
 

7149
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:37,830
best available science like with the
electrolytes and then vitamins

7150
01:46:37,830 --> 01:46:37,840
electrolytes and then vitamins
 

7151
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:39,910
electrolytes and then vitamins
but then also like remove all the humans

7152
01:46:39,910 --> 01:46:39,920
but then also like remove all the humans

from your life that affect you

7154
01:46:41,270 --> 01:46:41,280
from your life that affect you
 

7155
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:43,189
from your life that affect you
yep positively or negatively because you

7156
01:46:43,189 --> 01:46:43,199
yep positively or negatively because you
 

7157
01:46:43,199 --> 01:46:45,030
yep positively or negatively because you
might feel amazing because you're

7158
01:46:45,030 --> 01:46:45,040
might feel amazing because you're
 

7159
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:46,950
might feel amazing because you're
hanging out with cool people and then

7160
01:46:46,950 --> 01:46:46,960
hanging out with cool people and then
 

7161
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:49,030
hanging out with cool people and then
uh you know like removing basically all

7162
01:46:49,030 --> 01:46:49,040
uh you know like removing basically all
 

7163
01:46:49,040 --> 01:46:50,229
uh you know like removing basically all
the variables

7164
01:46:50,229 --> 01:46:50,239
the variables
 

7165
01:46:50,239 --> 01:46:52,310
the variables
it's kind of fascinating and you kind of

7166
01:46:52,310 --> 01:46:52,320
it's kind of fascinating and you kind of
 

7167
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:54,390
it's kind of fascinating and you kind of
all of us land in a place

7168
01:46:54,390 --> 01:46:54,400
all of us land in a place
 

7169
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:56,070
all of us land in a place
where we find something that worked for

7170
01:46:56,070 --> 01:46:56,080
where we find something that worked for
 

7171
01:46:56,080 --> 01:46:58,070
where we find something that worked for
us and then we maybe use some of the

7172
01:46:58,070 --> 01:46:58,080
us and then we maybe use some of the
 

7173
01:46:58,080 --> 01:46:59,830
us and then we maybe use some of the
placebo effect to help us out

7174
01:46:59,830 --> 01:46:59,840
placebo effect to help us out
 

7175
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:02,950
placebo effect to help us out
to stick in that place and then uh

7176
01:47:02,950 --> 01:47:02,960
to stick in that place and then uh
 

7177
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:04,390
to stick in that place and then uh
i suppose that's the way to live life

7178
01:47:04,390 --> 01:47:04,400
i suppose that's the way to live life
 

7179
01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:06,070
i suppose that's the way to live life
because it's impossible to find the

7180
01:47:06,070 --> 01:47:06,080
because it's impossible to find the
 

7181
01:47:06,080 --> 01:47:07,189
because it's impossible to find the
optimal for

7182
01:47:07,189 --> 01:47:07,199
optimal for
 

7183
01:47:07,199 --> 01:47:09,430
optimal for
any of us but carnivore is an

7184
01:47:09,430 --> 01:47:09,440
any of us but carnivore is an
 

7185
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:11,350
any of us but carnivore is an
interesting

7186
01:47:11,350 --> 01:47:11,360
interesting
 

7187
01:47:11,360 --> 01:47:14,629
interesting
new kind of caveat a new challenge to

7188
01:47:14,629 --> 01:47:14,639
new kind of caveat a new challenge to
 

7189
01:47:14,639 --> 01:47:16,310
new kind of caveat a new challenge to
the nutritional community

7190
01:47:16,310 --> 01:47:16,320
the nutritional community
 

7191
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:18,149
the nutritional community
because more and more people seem to be

7192
01:47:18,149 --> 01:47:18,159
because more and more people seem to be
 

7193
01:47:18,159 --> 01:47:19,910
because more and more people seem to be
doing well under carnivore

7194
01:47:19,910 --> 01:47:19,920
doing well under carnivore
 

7195
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:21,669
doing well under carnivore
yeah well the nutrition community is

7196
01:47:21,669 --> 01:47:21,679
yeah well the nutrition community is
 

7197
01:47:21,679 --> 01:47:23,109
yeah well the nutrition community is
probably we just got

7198
01:47:23,109 --> 01:47:23,119
probably we just got
 

7199
01:47:23,119 --> 01:47:24,790
probably we just got
done like dealing with the vegans and

7200
01:47:24,790 --> 01:47:24,800
done like dealing with the vegans and
 

7201
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:26,229
done like dealing with the vegans and
now we got this opposite end of the

7202
01:47:26,229 --> 01:47:26,239
now we got this opposite end of the
 

7203
01:47:26,239 --> 01:47:27,590
now we got this opposite end of the
spectrum coming at us

7204
01:47:27,590 --> 01:47:27,600
spectrum coming at us
 

7205
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:29,350
spectrum coming at us
but i think well i mean what this all

7206
01:47:29,350 --> 01:47:29,360
but i think well i mean what this all
 

7207
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:30,790
but i think well i mean what this all
tells

7208
01:47:30,790 --> 01:47:30,800
tells
 

7209
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:33,510
tells
what this all tells me is like there is

7210
01:47:33,510 --> 01:47:33,520
what this all tells me is like there is
 

7211
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:34,470
what this all tells me is like there is
uh for one

7212
01:47:34,470 --> 01:47:34,480
uh for one
 

7213
01:47:34,480 --> 01:47:37,669
uh for one
like in our food environment like

7214
01:47:37,669 --> 01:47:37,679
like in our food environment like
 

7215
01:47:37,679 --> 01:47:40,310
like in our food environment like
the failure rate of any one approach at

7216
01:47:40,310 --> 01:47:40,320
the failure rate of any one approach at
 

7217
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:41,430
the failure rate of any one approach at
a population level is going to be

7218
01:47:41,430 --> 01:47:41,440
a population level is going to be
 

7219
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:42,390
a population level is going to be
incredibly high

7220
01:47:42,390 --> 01:47:42,400
incredibly high
 

7221
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:44,629
incredibly high
i mean it's why we have you know what is

7222
01:47:44,629 --> 01:47:44,639
i mean it's why we have you know what is
 

7223
01:47:44,639 --> 01:47:45,590
i mean it's why we have you know what is
it like 88

7224
01:47:45,590 --> 01:47:45,600
it like 88
 

7225
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:47,189
it like 88
of the population has some sort of like

7226
01:47:47,189 --> 01:47:47,199
of the population has some sort of like
 

7227
01:47:47,199 --> 01:47:48,629
of the population has some sort of like
metabolic syndrome

7228
01:47:48,629 --> 01:47:48,639
metabolic syndrome
 

7229
01:47:48,639 --> 01:47:50,390
metabolic syndrome
and it's it's like you know it's because

7230
01:47:50,390 --> 01:47:50,400
and it's it's like you know it's because
 

7231
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:51,830
and it's it's like you know it's because
there's an endless quantity of

7232
01:47:51,830 --> 01:47:51,840
there's an endless quantity of
 

7233
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:52,470
there's an endless quantity of
everything

7234
01:47:52,470 --> 01:47:52,480
everything
 

7235
01:47:52,480 --> 01:47:53,510
everything
that you can get your hands on for

7236
01:47:53,510 --> 01:47:53,520
that you can get your hands on for
 

7237
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:55,830
that you can get your hands on for
relatively cheap um

7238
01:47:55,830 --> 01:47:55,840
relatively cheap um
 

7239
01:47:55,840 --> 01:47:57,590
relatively cheap um
and i think that's that that presents a

7240
01:47:57,590 --> 01:47:57,600
and i think that's that that presents a
 

7241
01:47:57,600 --> 01:48:00,870
and i think that's that that presents a
problem if your mindset is going to be

7242
01:48:00,870 --> 01:48:00,880
problem if your mindset is going to be
 

7243
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:03,270
problem if your mindset is going to be
we need this set of parameters for

7244
01:48:03,270 --> 01:48:03,280
we need this set of parameters for
 

7245
01:48:03,280 --> 01:48:04,149
we need this set of parameters for
nutrition and

7246
01:48:04,149 --> 01:48:04,159
nutrition and
 

7247
01:48:04,159 --> 01:48:06,310
nutrition and
everyone needs to adhere to that or

7248
01:48:06,310 --> 01:48:06,320
everyone needs to adhere to that or
 

7249
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:07,430
everyone needs to adhere to that or
you're wrong

7250
01:48:07,430 --> 01:48:07,440
you're wrong
 

7251
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:08,550
you're wrong
and it's like we'll tell that to the

7252
01:48:08,550 --> 01:48:08,560
and it's like we'll tell that to the
 

7253
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:11,350
and it's like we'll tell that to the
person who like went carnivore and

7254
01:48:11,350 --> 01:48:11,360
person who like went carnivore and
 

7255
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:13,750
person who like went carnivore and
cleared up some like crazy skin ailment

7256
01:48:13,750 --> 01:48:13,760
cleared up some like crazy skin ailment
 

7257
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:14,629
cleared up some like crazy skin ailment
or something like that

7258
01:48:14,629 --> 01:48:14,639
or something like that
 

7259
01:48:14,639 --> 01:48:16,709
or something like that
that's a weird one yeah like where the

7260
01:48:16,709 --> 01:48:16,719
that's a weird one yeah like where the
 

7261
01:48:16,719 --> 01:48:18,709
that's a weird one yeah like where the
carnivore seems to treat

7262
01:48:18,709 --> 01:48:18,719
carnivore seems to treat
 

7263
01:48:18,719 --> 01:48:21,510
carnivore seems to treat
like like depression uh-huh it's like

7264
01:48:21,510 --> 01:48:21,520
like like depression uh-huh it's like
 

7265
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:22,629
like like depression uh-huh it's like
like mental stuff

7266
01:48:22,629 --> 01:48:22,639
like mental stuff
 

7267
01:48:22,639 --> 01:48:23,990
like mental stuff
it's fascinating there's all these

7268
01:48:23,990 --> 01:48:24,000
it's fascinating there's all these
 

7269
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,229
it's fascinating there's all these
stories again it's anecdotes but it's

7270
01:48:26,229 --> 01:48:26,239
stories again it's anecdotes but it's
 

7271
01:48:26,239 --> 01:48:26,470
stories again it's anecdotes but it's
like

7272
01:48:26,470 --> 01:48:26,480
like
 

7273
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:29,590
like
the mental one i think may

7274
01:48:29,590 --> 01:48:29,600
the mental one i think may
 

7275
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:31,430
the mental one i think may
i'm stepping out a bit on a limb here

7276
01:48:31,430 --> 01:48:31,440
i'm stepping out a bit on a limb here
 

7277
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:32,709
i'm stepping out a bit on a limb here
but i want to say like

7278
01:48:32,709 --> 01:48:32,719
but i want to say like
 

7279
01:48:32,719 --> 01:48:34,390
but i want to say like
some of the research of dominic d

7280
01:48:34,390 --> 01:48:34,400
some of the research of dominic d
 

7281
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:36,390
some of the research of dominic d
agostino and and jeff wallick was

7282
01:48:36,390 --> 01:48:36,400
agostino and and jeff wallick was
 

7283
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:37,350
agostino and and jeff wallick was
looking at

7284
01:48:37,350 --> 01:48:37,360
looking at
 

7285
01:48:37,360 --> 01:48:40,229
looking at
the ketogenic diet which a carnivore

7286
01:48:40,229 --> 01:48:40,239
the ketogenic diet which a carnivore
 

7287
01:48:40,239 --> 01:48:40,709
the ketogenic diet which a carnivore
diet

7288
01:48:40,709 --> 01:48:40,719
diet
 

7289
01:48:40,719 --> 01:48:43,030
diet
is basically going to be a part of a

7290
01:48:43,030 --> 01:48:43,040
is basically going to be a part of a
 

7291
01:48:43,040 --> 01:48:44,390
is basically going to be a part of a
ketogenic i mean you could always go

7292
01:48:44,390 --> 01:48:44,400
ketogenic i mean you could always go
 

7293
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:45,030
ketogenic i mean you could always go
like

7294
01:48:45,030 --> 01:48:45,040
like
 

7295
01:48:45,040 --> 01:48:47,109
like
way too high on the protein i guess but

7296
01:48:47,109 --> 01:48:47,119
way too high on the protein i guess but
 

7297
01:48:47,119 --> 01:48:49,270
way too high on the protein i guess but
most people that i see doing carnivore

7298
01:48:49,270 --> 01:48:49,280
most people that i see doing carnivore
 

7299
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:50,709
most people that i see doing carnivore
they're cognizant

7300
01:48:50,709 --> 01:48:50,719
they're cognizant
 

7301
01:48:50,719 --> 01:48:52,870
they're cognizant
enough that at least if they're doing it

7302
01:48:52,870 --> 01:48:52,880
enough that at least if they're doing it
 

7303
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:54,390
enough that at least if they're doing it
for therapeutic reasons

7304
01:48:54,390 --> 01:48:54,400
for therapeutic reasons
 

7305
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:56,550
for therapeutic reasons
they're not going like you know 50

7306
01:48:56,550 --> 01:48:56,560
they're not going like you know 50
 

7307
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:58,470
they're not going like you know 50
protein 50 they're more like

7308
01:48:58,470 --> 01:48:58,480
protein 50 they're more like
 

7309
01:48:58,480 --> 01:49:02,470
protein 50 they're more like
70 30 80 20 something like that and

7310
01:49:02,470 --> 01:49:02,480
70 30 80 20 something like that and
 

7311
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:05,510
70 30 80 20 something like that and
and i think like you you do see some

7312
01:49:05,510 --> 01:49:05,520
and i think like you you do see some
 

7313
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:07,109
and i think like you you do see some
some work with like the brain and so the

7314
01:49:07,109 --> 01:49:07,119
some work with like the brain and so the
 

7315
01:49:07,119 --> 01:49:08,550
some work with like the brain and so the
mental stuff i know

7316
01:49:08,550 --> 01:49:08,560
mental stuff i know
 

7317
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:10,470
mental stuff i know
some of the i'm not sure if this was

7318
01:49:10,470 --> 01:49:10,480
some of the i'm not sure if this was
 

7319
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:11,990
some of the i'm not sure if this was
part of the darpa funding that

7320
01:49:11,990 --> 01:49:12,000
part of the darpa funding that
 

7321
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:15,030
part of the darpa funding that
that dr dominic d'agostino had

7322
01:49:15,030 --> 01:49:15,040
that dr dominic d'agostino had
 

7323
01:49:15,040 --> 01:49:16,310
that dr dominic d'agostino had
where they were looking at things like

7324
01:49:16,310 --> 01:49:16,320
where they were looking at things like
 

7325
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:18,629
where they were looking at things like
mental stuff like post-traumatic stress

7326
01:49:18,629 --> 01:49:18,639
mental stuff like post-traumatic stress
 

7327
01:49:18,639 --> 01:49:20,629
mental stuff like post-traumatic stress
disorder and that sort of stuff with

7328
01:49:20,629 --> 01:49:20,639
disorder and that sort of stuff with
 

7329
01:49:20,639 --> 01:49:22,149
disorder and that sort of stuff with
with like a strict ketogenic diet so i

7330
01:49:22,149 --> 01:49:22,159
with like a strict ketogenic diet so i
 

7331
01:49:22,159 --> 01:49:23,830
with like a strict ketogenic diet so i
wonder if some of that like the

7332
01:49:23,830 --> 01:49:23,840
wonder if some of that like the
 

7333
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:25,430
wonder if some of that like the
depression related stuff has to do with

7334
01:49:25,430 --> 01:49:25,440
depression related stuff has to do with
 

7335
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:27,030
depression related stuff has to do with
that where now like their body is just

7336
01:49:27,030 --> 01:49:27,040
that where now like their body is just
 

7337
01:49:27,040 --> 01:49:28,310
that where now like their body is just
fueling their brain differently than

7338
01:49:28,310 --> 01:49:28,320
fueling their brain differently than
 

7339
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:29,510
fueling their brain differently than
maybe they were in the past

7340
01:49:29,510 --> 01:49:29,520
maybe they were in the past
 

7341
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:32,390
maybe they were in the past
but um that's just you know wild guesses

7342
01:49:32,390 --> 01:49:32,400
but um that's just you know wild guesses
 

7343
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:33,510
but um that's just you know wild guesses
on my part

7344
01:49:33,510 --> 01:49:33,520
on my part
 

7345
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:34,709
on my part
um and i'm deviating from the

7346
01:49:34,709 --> 01:49:34,719
um and i'm deviating from the
 

7347
01:49:34,719 --> 01:49:36,390
um and i'm deviating from the
conversation but like no that's

7348
01:49:36,390 --> 01:49:36,400
conversation but like no that's
 

7349
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:36,870
conversation but like no that's
brilliant

7350
01:49:36,870 --> 01:49:36,880
brilliant
 

7351
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:39,910
brilliant
in terms of your own story on food can

7352
01:49:39,910 --> 01:49:39,920
in terms of your own story on food can
 

7353
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:40,950
in terms of your own story on food can
you say something

7354
01:49:40,950 --> 01:49:40,960
you say something
 

7355
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:42,229
you say something

referring to diet broadly

7358
01:49:44,229 --> 01:49:44,239
referring to diet broadly
 

7359
01:49:44,239 --> 01:49:46,070
referring to diet broadly
can you say something about how you like

7360
01:49:46,070 --> 01:49:46,080
can you say something about how you like
 

7361
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:47,990
can you say something about how you like
to fuel

7362
01:49:47,990 --> 01:49:48,000
to fuel
 

7363
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:51,109
to fuel
your like whether it's race or great

7364
01:49:51,109 --> 01:49:51,119
your like whether it's race or great
 

7365
01:49:51,119 --> 01:49:54,149
your like whether it's race or great
training sessions like maybe the day

7366
01:49:54,149 --> 01:49:54,159
training sessions like maybe the day
 

7367
01:49:54,159 --> 01:49:55,109
training sessions like maybe the day
before

7368
01:49:55,109 --> 01:49:55,119
before
 

7369
01:49:55,119 --> 01:49:58,550
before
let's go even that far during and maybe

7370
01:49:58,550 --> 01:49:58,560
let's go even that far during and maybe
 

7371
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:01,350
let's go even that far during and maybe
a few hours after okay it'll be a little

7372
01:50:01,350 --> 01:50:01,360
a few hours after okay it'll be a little
 

7373
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:02,149
a few hours after okay it'll be a little
different

7374
01:50:02,149 --> 01:50:02,159
different
 

7375
01:50:02,159 --> 01:50:04,470
different
for racing than it will be for like a

7376
01:50:04,470 --> 01:50:04,480
for racing than it will be for like a
 

7377
01:50:04,480 --> 01:50:05,750
for racing than it will be for like a
big workout just because

7378
01:50:05,750 --> 01:50:05,760
big workout just because
 

7379
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:06,790
big workout just because
the interesting thing about ultra

7380
01:50:06,790 --> 01:50:06,800
the interesting thing about ultra
 

7381
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:08,229
the interesting thing about ultra
running is just like you never do the

7382
01:50:08,229 --> 01:50:08,239
running is just like you never do the
 

7383
01:50:08,239 --> 01:50:09,109
running is just like you never do the
race even

7384
01:50:09,109 --> 01:50:09,119
race even
 

7385
01:50:09,119 --> 01:50:10,390
race even
like most endurance races you're going

7386
01:50:10,390 --> 01:50:10,400
like most endurance races you're going
 

7387
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:11,430
like most endurance races you're going
to cover the distance you're going to

7388
01:50:11,430 --> 01:50:11,440
to cover the distance you're going to
 

7389
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:12,709
to cover the distance you're going to
replicate the race almost

7390
01:50:12,709 --> 01:50:12,719
replicate the race almost
 

7391
01:50:12,719 --> 01:50:15,109
replicate the race almost
up to it in training whereas with 100

7392
01:50:15,109 --> 01:50:15,119
up to it in training whereas with 100
 

7393
01:50:15,119 --> 01:50:16,070
up to it in training whereas with 100
miles

7394
01:50:16,070 --> 01:50:16,080
miles
 

7395
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:17,830
miles
you can't you might replicate a third of

7396
01:50:17,830 --> 01:50:17,840
you can't you might replicate a third of
 

7397
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:19,109
you can't you might replicate a third of
it so so

7398
01:50:19,109 --> 01:50:19,119
it so so
 

7399
01:50:19,119 --> 01:50:20,870
it so so
i'll do i'll walk you through kind of my

7400
01:50:20,870 --> 01:50:20,880
i'll do i'll walk you through kind of my
 

7401
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:22,790
i'll do i'll walk you through kind of my
approach for like 100 mile race and i

7402
01:50:22,790 --> 01:50:22,800
approach for like 100 mile race and i
 

7403
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:23,830
approach for like 100 mile race and i
can tell you maybe what i would do

7404
01:50:23,830 --> 01:50:23,840
can tell you maybe what i would do
 

7405
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:25,750
can tell you maybe what i would do
differently on like a training day

7406
01:50:25,750 --> 01:50:25,760
differently on like a training day
 

7407
01:50:25,760 --> 01:50:28,950
differently on like a training day
uh but yeah so for um

7408
01:50:28,950 --> 01:50:28,960
uh but yeah so for um
 

7409
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:30,149
uh but yeah so for um
where where the community is in

7410
01:50:30,149 --> 01:50:30,159
where where the community is in
 

7411
01:50:30,159 --> 01:50:32,629
where where the community is in
agreement is that you do want to be

7412
01:50:32,629 --> 01:50:32,639
agreement is that you do want to be
 

7413
01:50:32,639 --> 01:50:33,910
agreement is that you do want to be
very good at burning fat for

7414
01:50:33,910 --> 01:50:33,920
very good at burning fat for
 

7415
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:35,350
very good at burning fat for
ultramarathons i mean there's just like

7416
01:50:35,350 --> 01:50:35,360
ultramarathons i mean there's just like
 

7417
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:36,709
ultramarathons i mean there's just like
the intensity is low

7418
01:50:36,709 --> 01:50:36,719
the intensity is low
 

7419
01:50:36,719 --> 01:50:40,070
the intensity is low
if you're if your ratios are skewed

7420
01:50:40,070 --> 01:50:40,080
if you're if your ratios are skewed
 

7421
01:50:40,080 --> 01:50:43,030
if you're if your ratios are skewed
very high towards carbohydrate

7422
01:50:43,030 --> 01:50:43,040
very high towards carbohydrate
 

7423
01:50:43,040 --> 01:50:43,990
very high towards carbohydrate
metabolism

7424
01:50:43,990 --> 01:50:44,000
metabolism
 

7425
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:47,109
metabolism
then you're going to have to defend your

7426
01:50:47,109 --> 01:50:47,119
then you're going to have to defend your
 

7427
01:50:47,119 --> 01:50:48,149
then you're going to have to defend your
muscle glycogen

7428
01:50:48,149 --> 01:50:48,159
muscle glycogen
 

7429
01:50:48,159 --> 01:50:50,870
muscle glycogen
through tons of carbohydrate consumption

7430
01:50:50,870 --> 01:50:50,880
through tons of carbohydrate consumption
 

7431
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:51,270
through tons of carbohydrate consumption
and

7432
01:50:51,270 --> 01:50:51,280
and
 

7433
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:52,629
and
that's just going to be very hard to do

7434
01:50:52,629 --> 01:50:52,639
that's just going to be very hard to do
 

7435
01:50:52,639 --> 01:50:54,390
that's just going to be very hard to do
over the course of an entire day even at

7436
01:50:54,390 --> 01:50:54,400
over the course of an entire day even at
 

7437
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:55,830
over the course of an entire day even at
low intensities

7438
01:50:55,830 --> 01:50:55,840
low intensities
 

7439
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:57,589
low intensities
so it's a fuel tank thing i mean it's

7440
01:50:57,589 --> 01:50:57,599
so it's a fuel tank thing i mean it's
 

7441
01:50:57,599 --> 01:50:58,950
so it's a fuel tank thing i mean it's
like your your leanest endurance

7442
01:50:58,950 --> 01:50:58,960
like your your leanest endurance
 

7443
01:50:58,960 --> 01:51:00,310
like your your leanest endurance
athletes have way more fat than they do

7444
01:51:00,310 --> 01:51:00,320
athletes have way more fat than they do
 

7445
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:01,910
athletes have way more fat than they do
glycogen stores

7446
01:51:01,910 --> 01:51:01,920
glycogen stores
 

7447
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:03,189
glycogen stores
when you're doing low intensity

7448
01:51:03,189 --> 01:51:03,199
when you're doing low intensity
 

7449
01:51:03,199 --> 01:51:04,870
when you're doing low intensity
performance you want to be burning high

7450
01:51:04,870 --> 01:51:04,880
performance you want to be burning high
 

7451
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:06,550
performance you want to be burning high
levels of fat and sparing that muscle

7452
01:51:06,550 --> 01:51:06,560
levels of fat and sparing that muscle
 

7453
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:07,910
levels of fat and sparing that muscle
glycogen

7454
01:51:07,910 --> 01:51:07,920
glycogen
 

7455
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:10,870
glycogen
what i tend to do is i want to start the

7456
01:51:10,870 --> 01:51:10,880
what i tend to do is i want to start the
 

7457
01:51:10,880 --> 01:51:12,470
what i tend to do is i want to start the
race burning really high levels of fat

7458
01:51:12,470 --> 01:51:12,480
race burning really high levels of fat
 

7459
01:51:12,480 --> 01:51:13,030
race burning really high levels of fat
so

7460
01:51:13,030 --> 01:51:13,040
so
 

7461
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:14,310
so
i'm gonna i'll maybe have some

7462
01:51:14,310 --> 01:51:14,320
i'm gonna i'll maybe have some
 

7463
01:51:14,320 --> 01:51:16,149
i'm gonna i'll maybe have some
carbohydrate the night before for dinner

7464
01:51:16,149 --> 01:51:16,159
carbohydrate the night before for dinner
 

7465
01:51:16,159 --> 01:51:17,270
carbohydrate the night before for dinner
but then i'm gonna lean into the

7466
01:51:17,270 --> 01:51:17,280
but then i'm gonna lean into the
 

7467
01:51:17,280 --> 01:51:20,550
but then i'm gonna lean into the
overnight fast breakfast the morning of

7468
01:51:20,550 --> 01:51:20,560
overnight fast breakfast the morning of
 

7469
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:22,070
overnight fast breakfast the morning of
i'm gonna stay away from carbohydrates

7470
01:51:22,070 --> 01:51:22,080
i'm gonna stay away from carbohydrates
 

7471
01:51:22,080 --> 01:51:23,589
i'm gonna stay away from carbohydrates
for a hundred miler anyway

7472
01:51:23,589 --> 01:51:23,599
for a hundred miler anyway
 

7473
01:51:23,599 --> 01:51:25,990
for a hundred miler anyway
and i'm gonna have something like

7474
01:51:25,990 --> 01:51:26,000
and i'm gonna have something like
 

7475
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:26,950
and i'm gonna have something like
something that's pretty

7476
01:51:26,950 --> 01:51:26,960
something that's pretty
 

7477
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:30,629
something that's pretty
like a high energy low

7478
01:51:30,629 --> 01:51:30,639
like a high energy low
 

7479
01:51:30,639 --> 01:51:33,109
like a high energy low
volume so like i'll do like an s fuels

7480
01:51:33,109 --> 01:51:33,119
volume so like i'll do like an s fuels
 

7481
01:51:33,119 --> 01:51:34,550
volume so like i'll do like an s fuels
uh life bar

7482
01:51:34,550 --> 01:51:34,560
uh life bar
 

7483
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:36,790
uh life bar
they've got like what's in an s fuel

7484
01:51:36,790 --> 01:51:36,800
they've got like what's in an s fuel
 

7485
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:38,709
they've got like what's in an s fuel
life bar are we talking about carbs or

7486
01:51:38,709 --> 01:51:38,719
life bar are we talking about carbs or
 

7487
01:51:38,719 --> 01:51:39,430
life bar are we talking about carbs or
we're talking about

7488
01:51:39,430 --> 01:51:39,440
we're talking about
 

7489
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:41,990
we're talking about
proteins basically fat and protein yeah

7490
01:51:41,990 --> 01:51:42,000
proteins basically fat and protein yeah
 

7491
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:43,030
proteins basically fat and protein yeah
fat protein bar

7492
01:51:43,030 --> 01:51:43,040
fat protein bar
 

7493
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:45,350
fat protein bar
and they make sure that's awesome yeah

7494
01:51:45,350 --> 01:51:45,360
and they make sure that's awesome yeah
 

7495
01:51:45,360 --> 01:51:47,750
and they make sure that's awesome yeah
so it's it's not it's low carb

7496
01:51:47,750 --> 01:51:47,760
so it's it's not it's low carb
 

7497
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:49,350
so it's it's not it's low carb
yeah they make s fuels makes a whole

7498
01:51:49,350 --> 01:51:49,360
yeah they make s fuels makes a whole
 

7499
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:51,350
yeah they make s fuels makes a whole
product line that's like kind of

7500
01:51:51,350 --> 01:51:51,360
product line that's like kind of
 

7501
01:51:51,360 --> 01:51:53,830
product line that's like kind of
positioned for a low carb athlete so

7502
01:51:53,830 --> 01:51:53,840
positioned for a low carb athlete so
 

7503
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:55,669
positioned for a low carb athlete so
they have some products on their lineup

7504
01:51:55,669 --> 01:51:55,679
they have some products on their lineup
 

7505
01:51:55,679 --> 01:51:56,149
they have some products on their lineup
that

7506
01:51:56,149 --> 01:51:56,159
that
 

7507
01:51:56,159 --> 01:51:58,070
that
offer some carbohydrate which is perfect

7508
01:51:58,070 --> 01:51:58,080
offer some carbohydrate which is perfect
 

7509
01:51:58,080 --> 01:51:59,189
offer some carbohydrate which is perfect
for me because i do introduce some

7510
01:51:59,189 --> 01:51:59,199
for me because i do introduce some
 

7511
01:51:59,199 --> 01:52:00,870
for me because i do introduce some
carbohydrate on racing and some of my

7512
01:52:00,870 --> 01:52:00,880
carbohydrate on racing and some of my
 

7513
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:02,629
carbohydrate on racing and some of my
bigger training sessions and things

7514
01:52:02,629 --> 01:52:02,639
bigger training sessions and things
 

7515
01:52:02,639 --> 01:52:05,270
bigger training sessions and things
but the majority of their products are

7516
01:52:05,270 --> 01:52:05,280
but the majority of their products are
 

7517
01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:06,390
but the majority of their products are
low carb

in with water yep
 

7535
01:52:19,119 --> 01:52:20,709
in with water yep
cool yeah so they've got like a creamer

7536
01:52:20,709 --> 01:52:20,719
cool yeah so they've got like a creamer
 

7537
01:52:20,719 --> 01:52:21,990
cool yeah so they've got like a creamer
version and then a fruity flavored

7538
01:52:21,990 --> 01:52:22,000
version and then a fruity flavored
 

7539

like you know a sports drink science is
 

7545
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:28,149
like you know a sports drink science is
awesome i know it is

7546
01:52:28,149 --> 01:52:28,159
awesome i know it is
 

7547
01:52:28,159 --> 01:52:29,510
awesome i know it is
well and that's so much of it too

7548
01:52:29,510 --> 01:52:29,520
well and that's so much of it too

because people are always like well i
don't know i just i

7552
01:52:31,350 --> 01:52:31,360
don't know i just i
 

7553
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:32,470
don't know i just i
just like to have my gatorade or

7554
01:52:32,470 --> 01:52:32,480
just like to have my gatorade or
 

7555
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:34,229
just like to have my gatorade or
whatever right yeah it's like well you

7556
01:52:34,229 --> 01:52:34,239
whatever right yeah it's like well you
 

7557
01:52:34,239 --> 01:52:35,750
whatever right yeah it's like well you
can have it now just uh it won't have

7558
01:52:35,750 --> 01:52:35,760
can have it now just uh it won't have
 

7559
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:36,870
can have it now just uh it won't have
all that you can see you can bring that

7560
01:52:36,870 --> 01:52:36,880
all that you can see you can bring that
 

7561
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:38,310
all that you can see you can bring that
kind of thing with you

7562
01:52:38,310 --> 01:52:38,320
kind of thing with you
 

7563
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:39,589
kind of thing with you
yeah so i'm leaning on a lot of those

7564
01:52:39,589 --> 01:52:39,599
yeah so i'm leaning on a lot of those
 

7565
01:52:39,599 --> 01:52:41,510
yeah so i'm leaning on a lot of those
like kind of liquid calories like those

7566
01:52:41,510 --> 01:52:41,520
like kind of liquid calories like those
 

7567
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:42,709
like kind of liquid calories like those
low

7568
01:52:42,709 --> 01:52:42,719
low
 

7569
01:52:42,719 --> 01:52:45,350
low
um volume high energy fat protein stuff

7570
01:52:45,350 --> 01:52:45,360
um volume high energy fat protein stuff
 

7571
01:52:45,360 --> 01:52:46,870
um volume high energy fat protein stuff
the morning of so that when i start the

7572
01:52:46,870 --> 01:52:46,880
the morning of so that when i start the
 

7573
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:48,709
the morning of so that when i start the
race my body's gonna be encouraged to

7574
01:52:48,709 --> 01:52:48,719
race my body's gonna be encouraged to
 

7575
01:52:48,719 --> 01:52:50,790
race my body's gonna be encouraged to
start out burning high levels of fat

7576
01:52:50,790 --> 01:52:50,800
start out burning high levels of fat
 

7577
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:52,149
start out burning high levels of fat
once i get going

7578
01:52:52,149 --> 01:52:52,159
once i get going
 

7579
01:52:52,159 --> 01:52:54,629
once i get going
probably 45 minutes in i'll start

7580
01:52:54,629 --> 01:52:54,639
probably 45 minutes in i'll start
 

7581
01:52:54,639 --> 01:52:55,910
probably 45 minutes in i'll start
introducing small amounts of

7582
01:52:55,910 --> 01:52:55,920
introducing small amounts of
 

7583
01:52:55,920 --> 01:52:57,990
introducing small amounts of
carbohydrate so at that point my

7584
01:52:57,990 --> 01:52:58,000
carbohydrate so at that point my
 

7585
01:52:58,000 --> 01:52:59,990
carbohydrate so at that point my
body's been revving pretty high fat

7586
01:52:59,990 --> 01:53:00,000
body's been revving pretty high fat
 

7587
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:01,350
body's been revving pretty high fat
metabolism

7588
01:53:01,350 --> 01:53:01,360
metabolism
 

7589
01:53:01,360 --> 01:53:04,390
metabolism
and by introducing some carbohydrate in

7590
01:53:04,390 --> 01:53:04,400
and by introducing some carbohydrate in
 

7591
01:53:04,400 --> 01:53:05,750
and by introducing some carbohydrate in
the context of the

7592
01:53:05,750 --> 01:53:05,760
the context of the
 

7593
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:08,629
the context of the
you know let's say my hundred mile uh

7594
01:53:08,629 --> 01:53:08,639
you know let's say my hundred mile uh
 

7595
01:53:08,639 --> 01:53:09,830
you know let's say my hundred mile uh
personal record

7596
01:53:09,830 --> 01:53:09,840
personal record
 

7597
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:11,589
personal record
you know i'm i'm running approximately

7598
01:53:11,589 --> 01:53:11,599
you know i'm i'm running approximately
 

7599
01:53:11,599 --> 01:53:13,430
you know i'm i'm running approximately
nine miles every hour so i'm

7600
01:53:13,430 --> 01:53:13,440
nine miles every hour so i'm
 

7601
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:14,790
nine miles every hour so i'm
probably going through about a thousand

7602
01:53:14,790 --> 01:53:14,800
probably going through about a thousand
 

7603
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:16,790
probably going through about a thousand
calories in an hour's time

7604
01:53:16,790 --> 01:53:16,800
calories in an hour's time
 

7605
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:20,070
calories in an hour's time
uh i'm gonna start just like defending

7606
01:53:20,070 --> 01:53:20,080
uh i'm gonna start just like defending
 

7607
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:21,270
uh i'm gonna start just like defending
muscle glycogen

7608
01:53:21,270 --> 01:53:21,280
muscle glycogen
 

7609
01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:23,109
muscle glycogen
by burning super high levels of fat at

7610
01:53:23,109 --> 01:53:23,119
by burning super high levels of fat at
 

7611
01:53:23,119 --> 01:53:24,310
by burning super high levels of fat at
the heart rate i would do for that i'm

7612
01:53:24,310 --> 01:53:24,320
the heart rate i would do for that i'm
 

7613
01:53:24,320 --> 01:53:26,310
the heart rate i would do for that i'm
probably burning somewhere between 80 90

7614
01:53:26,310 --> 01:53:26,320
probably burning somewhere between 80 90
 

7615
01:53:26,320 --> 01:53:28,629
probably burning somewhere between 80 90
fat you know 12 hours of that you can

7616
01:53:28,629 --> 01:53:28,639
fat you know 12 hours of that you can
 

7617
01:53:28,639 --> 01:53:30,790
fat you know 12 hours of that you can
chip away at your muscle glycogen

7618
01:53:30,790 --> 01:53:30,800
chip away at your muscle glycogen
 

7619
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:31,990
chip away at your muscle glycogen
uh to the point where you don't

7620
01:53:31,990 --> 01:53:32,000
uh to the point where you don't
 

7621
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:33,910
uh to the point where you don't
necessarily want to go zero carb

7622
01:53:33,910 --> 01:53:33,920
necessarily want to go zero carb
 

7623
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:35,510
necessarily want to go zero carb
so i'm basically just trying to defend

7624
01:53:35,510 --> 01:53:35,520
so i'm basically just trying to defend
 

7625
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:37,430
so i'm basically just trying to defend
what i know i'm going to be burning from

7626
01:53:37,430 --> 01:53:37,440
what i know i'm going to be burning from
 

7627
01:53:37,440 --> 01:53:37,750
what i know i'm going to be burning from
the

7628
01:53:37,750 --> 01:53:37,760
the
 

7629
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:41,109
the
carbohydrate side of that 80 to 90 fat

7630
01:53:41,109 --> 01:53:41,119
carbohydrate side of that 80 to 90 fat
 

7631
01:53:41,119 --> 01:53:44,149
carbohydrate side of that 80 to 90 fat
10 to 20 carbohydrate by taking in like

7632
01:53:44,149 --> 01:53:44,159
10 to 20 carbohydrate by taking in like
 

7633
01:53:44,159 --> 01:53:45,830
10 to 20 carbohydrate by taking in like
usually you know i've gone as low as

7634
01:53:45,830 --> 01:53:45,840
usually you know i've gone as low as
 

7635
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:47,830
usually you know i've gone as low as
about 15 grams of carbohydrate per hour

7636
01:53:47,830 --> 01:53:47,840
about 15 grams of carbohydrate per hour
 

7637
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:49,750
about 15 grams of carbohydrate per hour
and as high as 40 grams

7638
01:53:49,750 --> 01:53:49,760
and as high as 40 grams
 

7639
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:51,430
and as high as 40 grams
and the reality is somewhere in between

7640
01:53:51,430 --> 01:53:51,440
and the reality is somewhere in between
 

7641
01:53:51,440 --> 01:53:52,950
and the reality is somewhere in between
is probably the sweet spot but

7642
01:53:52,950 --> 01:53:52,960
is probably the sweet spot but
 

7643
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:55,189
is probably the sweet spot but
40 i can get away without any digestion

7644
01:53:55,189 --> 01:53:55,199
40 i can get away without any digestion
 

7645
01:53:55,199 --> 01:53:55,990
40 i can get away without any digestion
issues

7646
01:53:55,990 --> 01:53:56,000
issues
 

7647
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,310
issues
so i'm not really concerned pushing up

7648
01:53:58,310 --> 01:53:58,320
so i'm not really concerned pushing up
 

7649
01:53:58,320 --> 01:54:00,470
so i'm not really concerned pushing up
to that during a race since i'm

7650
01:54:00,470 --> 01:54:00,480
to that during a race since i'm
 

7651
01:54:00,480 --> 01:54:01,830
to that during a race since i'm
only concerned about performance on that

7652
01:54:01,830 --> 01:54:01,840
only concerned about performance on that
 

7653
01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:03,510
only concerned about performance on that
is it the car's that's the problem or is

7654
01:54:03,510 --> 01:54:03,520
is it the car's that's the problem or is
 

7655
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:04,790
is it the car's that's the problem or is
it fiber

7656
01:54:04,790 --> 01:54:04,800
it fiber
 

7657
01:54:04,800 --> 01:54:07,510
it fiber
or just oh from going above 40 grams or

7658
01:54:07,510 --> 01:54:07,520
or just oh from going above 40 grams or
 

7659
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:08,870
or just oh from going above 40 grams or
just because you mentioned digestion

7660
01:54:08,870 --> 01:54:08,880
just because you mentioned digestion
 

7661
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:09,350
just because you mentioned digestion
issues

7662
01:54:09,350 --> 01:54:09,360
issues
 

7663
01:54:09,360 --> 01:54:11,830
issues
like one of the things for me it's like

7664
01:54:11,830 --> 01:54:11,840
like one of the things for me it's like
 

7665
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:12,390
like one of the things for me it's like
one of the

7666
01:54:12,390 --> 01:54:12,400
one of the
 

7667
01:54:12,400 --> 01:54:14,629
one of the
cool things about fatty protein protein

7668
01:54:14,629 --> 01:54:14,639
cool things about fatty protein protein
 

7669
01:54:14,639 --> 01:54:15,589
cool things about fatty protein protein
or fat

7670
01:54:15,589 --> 01:54:15,599
or fat
 

7671
01:54:15,599 --> 01:54:17,510
or fat
is like my stomach just feels way better

7672
01:54:17,510 --> 01:54:17,520
is like my stomach just feels way better
 

7673
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:18,790
is like my stomach just feels way better
yeah like for

7674
01:54:18,790 --> 01:54:18,800
yeah like for
 

7675
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:21,510
yeah like for
so like carbs introduce like bloating

7676
01:54:21,510 --> 01:54:21,520
so like carbs introduce like bloating
 

7677
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:22,790
so like carbs introduce like bloating
and just not feeling great

7678
01:54:22,790 --> 01:54:22,800
and just not feeling great
 

7679
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:24,629
and just not feeling great
yeah and i think the funny thing is like

7680
01:54:24,629 --> 01:54:24,639
yeah and i think the funny thing is like
 

7681
01:54:24,639 --> 01:54:26,310
yeah and i think the funny thing is like
if you look at the position paper for

7682
01:54:26,310 --> 01:54:26,320
if you look at the position paper for
 

7683
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:28,229
if you look at the position paper for
ultra marathon single day events and

7684
01:54:28,229 --> 01:54:28,239
ultra marathon single day events and
 

7685
01:54:28,239 --> 01:54:29,030
ultra marathon single day events and
it's

7686
01:54:29,030 --> 01:54:29,040
it's
 

7687
01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:30,550
it's
you know it's very limited in the sense

7688
01:54:30,550 --> 01:54:30,560
you know it's very limited in the sense
 

7689
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:32,310
you know it's very limited in the sense
that it's not anyone's fault it's just

7690
01:54:32,310 --> 01:54:32,320
that it's not anyone's fault it's just
 

7691
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:33,589
that it's not anyone's fault it's just
we don't have a lot of great research on

7692
01:54:33,589 --> 01:54:33,599
we don't have a lot of great research on
 

7693
01:54:33,599 --> 01:54:35,270
we don't have a lot of great research on
100 mile races it's really hard to study

7694
01:54:35,270 --> 01:54:35,280
100 mile races it's really hard to study
 

7695
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:36,390
100 mile races it's really hard to study
what's going on when someone's running

7696
01:54:36,390 --> 01:54:36,400
what's going on when someone's running
 

7697
01:54:36,400 --> 01:54:37,510
what's going on when someone's running
100 miles

7698
01:54:37,510 --> 01:54:37,520
100 miles
 

7699
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:40,070
100 miles
but they'll say moderate carbohydrate

7700
01:54:40,070 --> 01:54:40,080
but they'll say moderate carbohydrate
 

7701
01:54:40,080 --> 01:54:40,709
but they'll say moderate carbohydrate
diet

7702
01:54:40,709 --> 01:54:40,719
diet
 

7703
01:54:40,719 --> 01:54:43,189
diet
is recommended but they'll also say that

7704
01:54:43,189 --> 01:54:43,199
is recommended but they'll also say that
 

7705
01:54:43,199 --> 01:54:44,550
is recommended but they'll also say that
it's like something like 60

7706
01:54:44,550 --> 01:54:44,560
it's like something like 60
 

7707
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:45,830
it's like something like 60
of participants are gonna report some

7708
01:54:45,830 --> 01:54:45,840
of participants are gonna report some
 

7709
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:47,430
of participants are gonna report some
sort of like digestion issue during the

7710
01:54:47,430 --> 01:54:47,440
sort of like digestion issue during the
 

7711
01:54:47,440 --> 01:54:48,470
sort of like digestion issue during the
event

7712
01:54:48,470 --> 01:54:48,480
event
 

7713
01:54:48,480 --> 01:54:49,830
event
so then it kind of becomes an issue of

7714
01:54:49,830 --> 01:54:49,840
so then it kind of becomes an issue of
 

7715
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:51,430
so then it kind of becomes an issue of
do you want to flip that coin do you

7716
01:54:51,430 --> 01:54:51,440
do you want to flip that coin do you
 

7717
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:53,350
do you want to flip that coin do you
want to flip that coin maybe the 40

7718
01:54:53,350 --> 01:54:53,360
want to flip that coin maybe the 40
 

7719
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:56,870
want to flip that coin maybe the 40
right exactly so for me what i found is

7720
01:54:56,870 --> 01:54:56,880
right exactly so for me what i found is
 

7721
01:54:56,880 --> 01:54:57,750
right exactly so for me what i found is
like

7722
01:54:57,750 --> 01:54:57,760
like
 

7723
01:54:57,760 --> 01:54:59,830
like
i can push up to 40 grams without

7724
01:54:59,830 --> 01:54:59,840
i can push up to 40 grams without
 

7725
01:54:59,840 --> 01:55:01,910
i can push up to 40 grams without
getting any digestion issues

7726
01:55:01,910 --> 01:55:01,920
getting any digestion issues
 

7727
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:04,709
getting any digestion issues
um do i need 40 grams probably not at

7728
01:55:04,709 --> 01:55:04,719
um do i need 40 grams probably not at
 

7729
01:55:04,719 --> 01:55:07,510
um do i need 40 grams probably not at
least not based on kind of the numbers

7730
01:55:07,510 --> 01:55:07,520
least not based on kind of the numbers
 

7731
01:55:07,520 --> 01:55:10,870
least not based on kind of the numbers
that would be like that that i would see

7732
01:55:10,870 --> 01:55:10,880
that would be like that that i would see
 

7733
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:12,149
that would be like that that i would see
on like if i went and actually got

7734
01:55:12,149 --> 01:55:12,159
on like if i went and actually got
 

7735
01:55:12,159 --> 01:55:13,750
on like if i went and actually got
like a metabolic heart test or something

7736
01:55:13,750 --> 01:55:13,760
like a metabolic heart test or something
 

7737
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:15,910
like a metabolic heart test or something
like that but it's possible i mean if i

7738
01:55:15,910 --> 01:55:15,920
like that but it's possible i mean if i
 

7739
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:17,430
like that but it's possible i mean if i
had a really good race that i would get

7740
01:55:17,430 --> 01:55:17,440
had a really good race that i would get
 

7741
01:55:17,440 --> 01:55:19,510
had a really good race that i would get
close to burning that per hour

7742
01:55:19,510 --> 01:55:19,520
close to burning that per hour
 

7743
01:55:19,520 --> 01:55:21,270
close to burning that per hour
um most folks that are following a

7744
01:55:21,270 --> 01:55:21,280
um most folks that are following a
 

7745
01:55:21,280 --> 01:55:22,870
um most folks that are following a
moderate high carbohydrate are going to

7746
01:55:22,870 --> 01:55:22,880
moderate high carbohydrate are going to
 

7747
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:24,870
moderate high carbohydrate are going to
be recommended do like 50 to 70 grams

7748
01:55:24,870 --> 01:55:24,880
be recommended do like 50 to 70 grams
 

7749
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:26,550
be recommended do like 50 to 70 grams
during a single day ultra marathon event

7750
01:55:26,550 --> 01:55:26,560
during a single day ultra marathon event
 

7751
01:55:26,560 --> 01:55:27,109
during a single day ultra marathon event
and

7752
01:55:27,109 --> 01:55:27,119
and
 

7753
01:55:27,119 --> 01:55:28,870
and
you'll see some you know some

7754
01:55:28,870 --> 01:55:28,880
you'll see some you know some
 

7755
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:31,109
you'll see some you know some
recommendations of up to like 100 grams

7756
01:55:31,109 --> 01:55:31,119
recommendations of up to like 100 grams
 

7757
01:55:31,119 --> 01:55:33,350
recommendations of up to like 100 grams
uh not so much for ultramarathons but

7758
01:55:33,350 --> 01:55:33,360
uh not so much for ultramarathons but
 

7759
01:55:33,360 --> 01:55:35,030
uh not so much for ultramarathons but
just in general from like a performance

7760
01:55:35,030 --> 01:55:35,040
just in general from like a performance
 

7761
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:36,229
just in general from like a performance
standpoint which

7762
01:55:36,229 --> 01:55:36,239
standpoint which
 

7763
01:55:36,239 --> 01:55:37,589
standpoint which
i mean it's one of those things where

7764
01:55:37,589 --> 01:55:37,599
i mean it's one of those things where
 

7765
01:55:37,599 --> 01:55:39,669
i mean it's one of those things where
it's like application versus

7766
01:55:39,669 --> 01:55:39,679
it's like application versus
 

7767
01:55:39,679 --> 01:55:41,430
it's like application versus
like what you can do in a lab for one

7768
01:55:41,430 --> 01:55:41,440
like what you can do in a lab for one
 

7769
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:42,870
like what you can do in a lab for one
hour is gonna be a lot different

7770
01:55:42,870 --> 01:55:42,880
hour is gonna be a lot different
 

7771
01:55:42,880 --> 01:55:44,149
hour is gonna be a lot different
especially when you're stretching out

7772
01:55:44,149 --> 01:55:44,159
especially when you're stretching out
 

7773
01:55:44,159 --> 01:55:47,350
especially when you're stretching out
distances well past that and you

7774
01:55:47,350 --> 01:55:47,360
distances well past that and you
 

7775
01:55:47,360 --> 01:55:49,270
distances well past that and you
there's there's i'm diverting a little

7776
01:55:49,270 --> 01:55:49,280
there's there's i'm diverting a little
 

7777
01:55:49,280 --> 01:55:50,629
there's there's i'm diverting a little
here but i mean there's like an approach

7778
01:55:50,629 --> 01:55:50,639
here but i mean there's like an approach
 

7779
01:55:50,639 --> 01:55:52,149
here but i mean there's like an approach
of like training your gut so you can

7780
01:55:52,149 --> 01:55:52,159
of like training your gut so you can
 

7781
01:55:52,159 --> 01:55:53,270
of like training your gut so you can
like

7782
01:55:53,270 --> 01:55:53,280
like
 

7783
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:54,470
like
be able to tolerate that much

7784
01:55:54,470 --> 01:55:54,480
be able to tolerate that much
 

7785
01:55:54,480 --> 01:55:55,830
be able to tolerate that much
carbohydrate which you can do and you

7786
01:55:55,830 --> 01:55:55,840
carbohydrate which you can do and you
 

7787
01:55:55,840 --> 01:55:57,189
carbohydrate which you can do and you
may have to if you're gonna follow a

7788
01:55:57,189 --> 01:55:57,199
may have to if you're gonna follow a
 

7789
01:55:57,199 --> 01:55:58,790
may have to if you're gonna follow a
high carbohydrate diet

7790
01:55:58,790 --> 01:55:58,800
high carbohydrate diet
 

7791
01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:00,070
high carbohydrate diet
but again we go back to that

7792
01:56:00,070 --> 01:56:00,080
but again we go back to that
 

7793
01:56:00,080 --> 01:56:02,229
but again we go back to that
practicality standpoint of

7794
01:56:02,229 --> 01:56:02,239
practicality standpoint of
 

7795
01:56:02,239 --> 01:56:04,709
practicality standpoint of
if you're a professional olympian who's

7796
01:56:04,709 --> 01:56:04,719
if you're a professional olympian who's
 

7797
01:56:04,719 --> 01:56:06,790
if you're a professional olympian who's
living and breathing performance

01:56:06,790 --> 01:56:06,800
living and breathing performance
 

7799
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:08,950
living and breathing performance
and you're burning two to three times

7800
01:56:08,950 --> 01:56:08,960
and you're burning two to three times
 

7801
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:09,830
and you're burning two to three times
you're messing

7802
01:56:09,830 --> 01:56:09,840
you're messing
 

7803
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:12,629
you're messing
resting metabolic rate on some days like

7804
01:56:12,629 --> 01:56:12,639
resting metabolic rate on some days like
 

7805
01:56:12,639 --> 01:56:13,350
resting metabolic rate on some days like
you

7806
01:56:13,350 --> 01:56:13,360
you
 

7807
01:56:13,360 --> 01:56:16,149
you
you may be able to actually consume 100

7808
01:56:16,149 --> 01:56:16,159
you may be able to actually consume 100
 

7809
01:56:16,159 --> 01:56:17,830
you may be able to actually consume 100

grams of carbohydrate per hour during
 

7811
01:56:17,840 --> 01:56:19,189
grams of carbohydrate per hour during
your training sessions and

01:56:19,189 --> 01:56:19,199
your training sessions and
 

7813
01:56:19,199 --> 01:56:21,270
your training sessions and
and just you know barely stay on top of

7814
01:56:21,270 --> 01:56:21,280
and just you know barely stay on top of
 

7815
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:22,629
and just you know barely stay on top of
your nutritional needs

7816
01:56:22,629 --> 01:56:22,639
your nutritional needs

most people who are running

7818
01:56:23,910 --> 01:56:23,920
most people who are running
 

7819
01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:25,669
most people who are running
ultramarathons aren't going to be you

7820
01:56:25,669 --> 01:56:25,679
ultramarathons aren't going to be you
 

7821
01:56:25,679 --> 01:56:27,030
ultramarathons aren't going to be you
know probably training much past 10

7822
01:56:27,030 --> 01:56:27,040
know probably training much past 10
 

7823
01:56:27,040 --> 01:56:28,550
know probably training much past 10
hours per week

7824
01:56:28,550 --> 01:56:28,560
hours per week
 

7825
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:31,510
hours per week
and they're probably not gonna have the

7826
01:56:31,510 --> 01:56:31,520
and they're probably not gonna have the
 

7827
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:32,629
and they're probably not gonna have the
i'll call it their

7828
01:56:32,629 --> 01:56:32,639
i'll call it their
 

7829
01:56:32,639 --> 01:56:35,270
i'll call it their
a dietary budget to tolerate a hundred

7830
01:56:35,270 --> 01:56:35,280
a dietary budget to tolerate a hundred
 

7831
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:37,109
a dietary budget to tolerate a hundred
grams of carbohydrate consumption during

7832
01:56:37,109 --> 01:56:37,119
grams of carbohydrate consumption during
 

7833
01:56:37,119 --> 01:56:38,629
grams of carbohydrate consumption during
their workouts and still be able to

7834
01:56:38,629 --> 01:56:38,639
their workouts and still be able to
 

7835
01:56:38,639 --> 01:56:40,950
their workouts and still be able to
stay healthy and uh you know so i think

7836
01:56:40,950 --> 01:56:40,960
stay healthy and uh you know so i think
 

7837
01:56:40,960 --> 01:56:42,149
stay healthy and uh you know so i think
that's kind of like a

7838
01:56:42,149 --> 01:56:42,159
that's kind of like a
 

7839
01:56:42,159 --> 01:56:45,430
that's kind of like a
a bit of a of a non a non-starter for

7840
01:56:45,430 --> 01:56:45,440
a bit of a of a non a non-starter for
 

7841
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:46,790
a bit of a of a non a non-starter for
the majority of people

7842
01:56:46,790 --> 01:56:46,800
the majority of people
 

7843
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:48,709
the majority of people
unless we want to talk about like a tiny

7844
01:56:48,709 --> 01:56:48,719
unless we want to talk about like a tiny
 

7845
01:56:48,719 --> 01:56:50,629
unless we want to talk about like a tiny
percentage of the one percent of

7846
01:56:50,629 --> 01:56:50,639
percentage of the one percent of
 

7847
01:56:50,639 --> 01:56:52,310
percentage of the one percent of
top performers so maybe you can talk

7848
01:56:52,310 --> 01:56:52,320
top performers so maybe you can talk
 

7849
01:56:52,320 --> 01:56:53,990
top performers so maybe you can talk
about the training like feeling yourself

7850
01:56:53,990 --> 01:56:54,000
about the training like feeling yourself
 

7851
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:55,189
about the training like feeling yourself
during training as well

7852
01:56:55,189 --> 01:56:55,199
during training as well
 

7853
01:56:55,199 --> 01:56:58,790
during training as well
is there and also as part of that is it

7854
01:56:58,790 --> 01:56:58,800
is there and also as part of that is it
 

7855
01:56:58,800 --> 01:57:00,229
is there and also as part of that is it
possible to train

7856
01:57:00,229 --> 01:57:00,239
possible to train
 

7857
01:57:00,239 --> 01:57:04,470
possible to train
mostly fasted because as a side comment

7858
01:57:04,470 --> 01:57:04,480
mostly fasted because as a side comment
 

7859
01:57:04,480 --> 01:57:08,950
mostly fasted because as a side comment
let me just say i like again not

7860
01:57:08,950 --> 01:57:08,960
let me just say i like again not
 

7861
01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:10,709
let me just say i like again not
you are not even like one tenth of your

7862
01:57:10,709 --> 01:57:10,719
you are not even like one tenth of your
 

7863
01:57:10,719 --> 01:57:12,550
you are not even like one tenth of your
level of performance but you know i

7864
01:57:12,550 --> 01:57:12,560
level of performance but you know i
 

7865
01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:15,109
level of performance but you know i
i try to push myself and i just feel

7866
01:57:15,109 --> 01:57:15,119
i try to push myself and i just feel
 

7867
01:57:15,119 --> 01:57:16,790
i try to push myself and i just feel
much better when i'm fasted so

7868
01:57:16,790 --> 01:57:16,800
much better when i'm fasted so
 

7869
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:19,510
much better when i'm fasted so
water and maybe some salt for longer

7870
01:57:19,510 --> 01:57:19,520
water and maybe some salt for longer
 

7871
01:57:19,520 --> 01:57:21,270
water and maybe some salt for longer
runs for anything over like 10

7872
01:57:21,270 --> 01:57:21,280
runs for anything over like 10
 

7873
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:24,310
runs for anything over like 10
15 miles but not no food yeah i think i

7874
01:57:24,310 --> 01:57:24,320
15 miles but not no food yeah i think i
 

7875
01:57:24,320 --> 01:57:25,990
15 miles but not no food yeah i think i
mean i like to train on an empty stomach

7876
01:57:25,990 --> 01:57:26,000
mean i like to train on an empty stomach
 

7877
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:27,910
mean i like to train on an empty stomach
uh i do most my my biggest training

7878
01:57:27,910 --> 01:57:27,920
uh i do most my my biggest training
 

7879
01:57:27,920 --> 01:57:29,430
uh i do most my my biggest training
session usually in the morning and

7880
01:57:29,430 --> 01:57:29,440
session usually in the morning and
 

7881
01:57:29,440 --> 01:57:31,109
session usually in the morning and
it usually will determine whether i eat

7882
01:57:31,109 --> 01:57:31,119
it usually will determine whether i eat
 

7883
01:57:31,119 --> 01:57:32,550
it usually will determine whether i eat
something or not before that is like how

7884
01:57:32,550 --> 01:57:32,560
something or not before that is like how
 

7885
01:57:32,560 --> 01:57:33,830
something or not before that is like how
much do i need to eat that day in order

7886
01:57:33,830 --> 01:57:33,840
much do i need to eat that day in order
 

7887
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:34,870
much do i need to eat that day in order
to stay on top of it to build training

7888
01:57:34,870 --> 01:57:34,880
to stay on top of it to build training
 

7889
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:36,229
to stay on top of it to build training
again the next day

7890
01:57:36,229 --> 01:57:36,239
again the next day
 

7891
01:57:36,239 --> 01:57:38,390
again the next day
so i'll i'll i'll usually do something

7892
01:57:38,390 --> 01:57:38,400
so i'll i'll i'll usually do something
 

7893
01:57:38,400 --> 01:57:39,990
so i'll i'll i'll usually do something
similar to what i do before a race if i

7894
01:57:39,990 --> 01:57:40,000
similar to what i do before a race if i
 

7895
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:41,430
similar to what i do before a race if i
need to kind of stay on top of calories

7896
01:57:41,430 --> 01:57:41,440
need to kind of stay on top of calories
 

7897
01:57:41,440 --> 01:57:42,709
need to kind of stay on top of calories
for the day so i'm not like

7898
01:57:42,709 --> 01:57:42,719
for the day so i'm not like
 

7899
01:57:42,719 --> 01:57:45,990
for the day so i'm not like
at noon with like no calorie intake and

7900
01:57:45,990 --> 01:57:46,000
at noon with like no calorie intake and
 

7901
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:46,390
at noon with like no calorie intake and
like

7902
01:57:46,390 --> 01:57:46,400
like
 

7903
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:48,390
like
5 000 calories to try to consume before

7904
01:57:48,390 --> 01:57:48,400
5 000 calories to try to consume before
 

7905
01:57:48,400 --> 01:57:49,910
5 000 calories to try to consume before
i go to bed that night and get out and

7906
01:57:49,910 --> 01:57:49,920
i go to bed that night and get out and
 

7907
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:52,390
i go to bed that night and get out and
do the same thing the next day uh

7908
01:57:52,390 --> 01:57:52,400
do the same thing the next day uh
 

7909
01:57:52,400 --> 01:57:55,109
do the same thing the next day uh
but yeah i think uh in if i were if i

7910
01:57:55,109 --> 01:57:55,119
but yeah i think uh in if i were if i
 

7911
01:57:55,119 --> 01:57:56,390
but yeah i think uh in if i were if i
were doing what you're doing

7912
01:57:56,390 --> 01:57:56,400
were doing what you're doing
 

7913
01:57:56,400 --> 01:57:59,589
were doing what you're doing
like if that were my lifestyle i think i

7914
01:57:59,589 --> 01:57:59,599
like if that were my lifestyle i think i
 

7915
01:57:59,599 --> 01:58:01,750
like if that were my lifestyle i think i
would do almost all my runs fasted

7916
01:58:01,750 --> 01:58:01,760
would do almost all my runs fasted
 

7917
01:58:01,760 --> 01:58:03,350
would do almost all my runs fasted
i don't see why i would be eating a lot

7918
01:58:03,350 --> 01:58:03,360
i don't see why i would be eating a lot
 

7919
01:58:03,360 --> 01:58:05,189
i don't see why i would be eating a lot
before it because it's like

7920
01:58:05,189 --> 01:58:05,199
before it because it's like
 

7921
01:58:05,199 --> 01:58:07,750
before it because it's like
um i'm just introducing something that

7922
01:58:07,750 --> 01:58:07,760
um i'm just introducing something that
 

7923
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:08,790
um i'm just introducing something that
could

7924
01:58:08,790 --> 01:58:08,800
could
 

7925
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:10,229
could
especially if you're noticing like

7926
01:58:10,229 --> 01:58:10,239
especially if you're noticing like
 

7927
01:58:10,239 --> 01:58:12,390
especially if you're noticing like
here's what i'd say if i was doing that

7928
01:58:12,390 --> 01:58:12,400
here's what i'd say if i was doing that
 

7929
01:58:12,400 --> 01:58:14,310
here's what i'd say if i was doing that
and i was like wow this run sucks and

7930
01:58:14,310 --> 01:58:14,320
and i was like wow this run sucks and
 

7931
01:58:14,320 --> 01:58:15,830
and i was like wow this run sucks and
then i introduced something beforehand

7932
01:58:15,830 --> 01:58:15,840
then i introduced something beforehand
 

7933
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:17,350
then i introduced something beforehand
and now my run was feeling great my

7934
01:58:17,350 --> 01:58:17,360
and now my run was feeling great my
 

7935
01:58:17,360 --> 01:58:18,709
and now my run was feeling great my
progress was getting better

7936
01:58:18,709 --> 01:58:18,719
progress was getting better
 

7937
01:58:18,719 --> 01:58:19,910
progress was getting better
that's when i would maybe consider

7938
01:58:19,910 --> 01:58:19,920
that's when i would maybe consider
 

7939
01:58:19,920 --> 01:58:21,189
that's when i would maybe consider
having something before but if you're

7940
01:58:21,189 --> 01:58:21,199
having something before but if you're
 

7941
01:58:21,199 --> 01:58:23,030
having something before but if you're
running both of those

7942
01:58:23,030 --> 01:58:23,040
running both of those
 

7943
01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:24,470
running both of those
those like self experiments you're

7944
01:58:24,470 --> 01:58:24,480
those like self experiments you're
 

7945
01:58:24,480 --> 01:58:26,070
those like self experiments you're
noticing yeah if i eat something before

7946
01:58:26,070 --> 01:58:26,080
noticing yeah if i eat something before
 

7947
01:58:26,080 --> 01:58:27,109
noticing yeah if i eat something before
i go on this workout

7948
01:58:27,109 --> 01:58:27,119
i go on this workout
 

7949
01:58:27,119 --> 01:58:29,109
i go on this workout
the workout's less enjoyable i'm not

7950
01:58:29,109 --> 01:58:29,119
the workout's less enjoyable i'm not
 

7951
01:58:29,119 --> 01:58:30,470
the workout's less enjoyable i'm not
noticing any any

7952
01:58:30,470 --> 01:58:30,480
noticing any any
 

7953
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:32,470
noticing any any
increased improvements on it again it's

7954
01:58:32,470 --> 01:58:32,480
increased improvements on it again it's
 

7955
01:58:32,480 --> 01:58:34,070
increased improvements on it again it's
a little messy like we said before it's

7956
01:58:34,070 --> 01:58:34,080
a little messy like we said before it's
 

7957
01:58:34,080 --> 01:58:35,589
a little messy like we said before it's
hard to really you can't go back and try

7958
01:58:35,589 --> 01:58:35,599
hard to really you can't go back and try
 

7959
01:58:35,599 --> 01:58:37,910
hard to really you can't go back and try
it a different way on that specific day

7960
01:58:37,910 --> 01:58:37,920
it a different way on that specific day
 

7961
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:39,830
it a different way on that specific day
but i think i think most people if

7962
01:58:39,830 --> 01:58:39,840
but i think i think most people if
 

7963
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:41,750
but i think i think most people if
they're just like if they go at it with

7964
01:58:41,750 --> 01:58:41,760
they're just like if they go at it with
 

7965
01:58:41,760 --> 01:58:42,310
they're just like if they go at it with
like

7966
01:58:42,310 --> 01:58:42,320
like
 

7967
01:58:42,320 --> 01:58:44,390
like
no bias in the sense that they're like

7968
01:58:44,390 --> 01:58:44,400
no bias in the sense that they're like
 

7969
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:46,629
no bias in the sense that they're like
trying to make one work versus the other

7970
01:58:46,629 --> 01:58:46,639
trying to make one work versus the other
 

7971
01:58:46,639 --> 01:58:48,470
trying to make one work versus the other
you can get at least a good enough look

7972
01:58:48,470 --> 01:58:48,480
you can get at least a good enough look
 

7973
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:49,669
you can get at least a good enough look
at it and if

7974
01:58:49,669 --> 01:58:49,679
at it and if
 

7975
01:58:49,679 --> 01:58:51,750
at it and if
absolute peak performance in one

7976
01:58:51,750 --> 01:58:51,760
absolute peak performance in one
 

7977
01:58:51,760 --> 01:58:52,950
absolute peak performance in one
activity one

7978
01:58:52,950 --> 01:58:52,960
activity one
 

7979
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:56,070
activity one
very specific activity isn't your goal

7980
01:58:56,070 --> 01:58:56,080
very specific activity isn't your goal
 

7981
01:58:56,080 --> 01:58:56,470
very specific activity isn't your goal
then

7982
01:58:56,470 --> 01:58:56,480
then
 

7983
01:58:56,480 --> 01:58:58,310
then
it's like do you really care if one x

7984
01:58:58,310 --> 01:58:58,320
it's like do you really care if one x
 

7985
01:58:58,320 --> 01:59:00,550
it's like do you really care if one x
has a two percent performance increase

7986
01:59:00,550 --> 01:59:00,560
has a two percent performance increase
 

7987
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:01,750
has a two percent performance increase
that you won't even probably notice

7988
01:59:01,750 --> 01:59:01,760
that you won't even probably notice
 

7989
01:59:01,760 --> 01:59:02,709
that you won't even probably notice
because there's other variables that

7990
01:59:02,709 --> 01:59:02,719
because there's other variables that
 

7991
01:59:02,719 --> 01:59:05,669
because there's other variables that
will clearly overpower that two percent

7992
01:59:05,669 --> 01:59:05,679
will clearly overpower that two percent
 

7993
01:59:05,679 --> 01:59:07,109
will clearly overpower that two percent
one way or the other and there's some

7994
01:59:07,109 --> 01:59:07,119
one way or the other and there's some
 

7995
01:59:07,119 --> 01:59:08,709
one way or the other and there's some
benefit in terms of freedom

7996
01:59:08,709 --> 01:59:08,719
benefit in terms of freedom
 

7997
01:59:08,719 --> 01:59:11,510
benefit in terms of freedom
and letting go of like having to think

7998
01:59:11,510 --> 01:59:11,520
and letting go of like having to think
 

7999
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:12,790
and letting go of like having to think
about some of these variables

8000
01:59:12,790 --> 01:59:12,800
about some of these variables
 

8001
01:59:12,800 --> 01:59:15,270
about some of these variables
i see sort of fasting is even if it's

8002
01:59:15,270 --> 01:59:15,280
i see sort of fasting is even if it's
 

8003
01:59:15,280 --> 01:59:17,109
i see sort of fasting is even if it's
like a hit on the performance

8004
01:59:17,109 --> 01:59:17,119
like a hit on the performance
 

8005
01:59:17,119 --> 01:59:19,750
like a hit on the performance
it's worth it to just not think about it

8006
01:59:19,750 --> 01:59:19,760
it's worth it to just not think about it
 

8007
01:59:19,760 --> 01:59:20,950
it's worth it to just not think about it
there's some really nice

8008
01:59:20,950 --> 01:59:20,960
there's some really nice
 

8009
01:59:20,960 --> 01:59:24,310
there's some really nice
aspect to just putting on shoes not

8010
01:59:24,310 --> 01:59:24,320
aspect to just putting on shoes not
 

8011
01:59:24,320 --> 01:59:26,790
aspect to just putting on shoes not
caring like what shorts you wear or like

8012
01:59:26,790 --> 01:59:26,800
caring like what shorts you wear or like
 

8013
01:59:26,800 --> 01:59:28,470
caring like what shorts you wear or like

stuff

8042
01:59:53,030 --> 01:59:53,040
stuff
 

8043
01:59:53,040 --> 01:59:54,310
stuff
there's like a there's like a there's

8044
01:59:54,310 --> 01:59:54,320
there's like a there's like a there's
 

8045
01:59:54,320 --> 01:59:56,149
there's like a there's like a there's
almost like a weight that comes off your

8046
01:59:56,149 --> 01:59:56,159
almost like a weight that comes off your
 

8047
01:59:56,159 --> 01:59:57,510
almost like a weight that comes off your
shoulders when you can when you think

8048
01:59:57,510 --> 01:59:57,520
shoulders when you can when you think
 

8049
01:59:57,520 --> 01:59:57,990
shoulders when you can when you think
even just

8050
01:59:57,990 --> 01:59:58,000
even just
 

8051
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,310
even just
thinking about it like it's so simple so

8052
02:00:00,310 --> 02:00:00,320
thinking about it like it's so simple so
 

8053
02:00:00,320 --> 02:00:02,070
thinking about it like it's so simple so
the reason i i'm mostly a minimalist

8054
02:00:02,070 --> 02:00:02,080
the reason i i'm mostly a minimalist
 

8055
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:03,830
the reason i i'm mostly a minimalist
like that the reason i have stuff is i

8056
02:00:03,830 --> 02:00:03,840
like that the reason i have stuff is i
 

8057
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:05,510
like that the reason i have stuff is i
realize like

8058
02:00:05,510 --> 02:00:05,520
realize like
 

8059
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:07,510
realize like
you probably have to fit into society

8060
02:00:07,510 --> 02:00:07,520
you probably have to fit into society
 

8061
02:00:07,520 --> 02:00:08,550
you probably have to fit into society
and if you want to have

8062
02:00:08,550 --> 02:00:08,560
and if you want to have
 

8063
02:00:08,560 --> 02:00:09,669
and if you want to have
other people in your life you should

8064
02:00:09,669 --> 02:00:09,679
other people in your life you should
 

8065
02:00:09,679 --> 02:00:11,990
other people in your life you should
probably get used to having stuff yeah

8066
02:00:11,990 --> 02:00:12,000
probably get used to having stuff yeah
 

8067
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,629
probably get used to having stuff yeah
because because most people like stuff

8068
02:00:14,629 --> 02:00:14,639
because because most people like stuff
 

8069
02:00:14,639 --> 02:00:16,310
because because most people like stuff
right yeah well yeah there's that side

8070
02:00:16,310 --> 02:00:16,320
right yeah well yeah there's that side
 

8071
02:00:16,320 --> 02:00:17,270
right yeah well yeah there's that side
of it too and

8072
02:00:17,270 --> 02:00:17,280
of it too and
 

8073
02:00:17,280 --> 02:00:19,430
of it too and
there's there's a whole you don't want

8074
02:00:19,430 --> 02:00:19,440
there's there's a whole you don't want
 

8075
02:00:19,440 --> 02:00:21,510
there's there's a whole you don't want
to ostracize yourself too much and

8076
02:00:21,510 --> 02:00:21,520
to ostracize yourself too much and
 

8077
02:00:21,520 --> 02:00:23,189
to ostracize yourself too much and
i think anything you can kind of like

8078
02:00:23,189 --> 02:00:23,199
i think anything you can kind of like
 

8079
02:00:23,199 --> 02:00:24,790
i think anything you can kind of like
you can manipulate that a little bit

8080
02:00:24,790 --> 02:00:24,800
you can manipulate that a little bit
 

8081
02:00:24,800 --> 02:00:26,070
you can manipulate that a little bit
where there's things that are like

8082
02:00:26,070 --> 02:00:26,080
where there's things that are like
 

8083
02:00:26,080 --> 02:00:29,109
where there's things that are like
not specific to uh

8084
02:00:29,109 --> 02:00:29,119
not specific to uh
 

8085
02:00:29,119 --> 02:00:30,629
not specific to uh
you know that's gonna negatively impact

8086
02:00:30,629 --> 02:00:30,639
you know that's gonna negatively impact
 

8087
02:00:30,639 --> 02:00:31,910
you know that's gonna negatively impact
the people around you or your

8088
02:00:31,910 --> 02:00:31,920
the people around you or your
 

8089
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:33,669
the people around you or your
experiences with them

8090
02:00:33,669 --> 02:00:33,679
experiences with them
 

8091
02:00:33,679 --> 02:00:35,270
experiences with them
uh so there's a balance like everything

8092
02:00:35,270 --> 02:00:35,280
uh so there's a balance like everything
 

8093
02:00:35,280 --> 02:00:37,109
uh so there's a balance like everything
i guess yeah i mean that's why i drink

8094
02:00:37,109 --> 02:00:37,119
i guess yeah i mean that's why i drink
 

8095
02:00:37,119 --> 02:00:38,629
i guess yeah i mean that's why i drink
i think i mentioned you offline drink

8096
02:00:38,629 --> 02:00:38,639
i think i mentioned you offline drink
 

8097
02:00:38,639 --> 02:00:40,550
i think i mentioned you offline drink
vodka whiskey

8098
02:00:40,550 --> 02:00:40,560
vodka whiskey
 

8099
02:00:40,560 --> 02:00:43,830
vodka whiskey
sort of alcohol because i don't

8100
02:00:43,830 --> 02:00:43,840
sort of alcohol because i don't
 

8101
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:46,950
sort of alcohol because i don't
feel good about it the day after

8102
02:00:46,950 --> 02:00:46,960
feel good about it the day after
 

8103
02:00:46,960 --> 02:00:49,510
feel good about it the day after
or sometimes multiple days after so i

8104
02:00:49,510 --> 02:00:49,520
or sometimes multiple days after so i
 

8105
02:00:49,520 --> 02:00:51,189
or sometimes multiple days after so i
know it's not good for me

8106
02:00:51,189 --> 02:00:51,199
know it's not good for me
 

8107
02:00:51,199 --> 02:00:52,470
know it's not good for me
so i do a lot of stuff that's good for

8108
02:00:52,470 --> 02:00:52,480
so i do a lot of stuff that's good for
 

8109
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:54,229
so i do a lot of stuff that's good for
me everything we talked about exercise

8110
02:00:54,229 --> 02:00:54,239
me everything we talked about exercise
 

8111
02:00:54,239 --> 02:00:55,830
me everything we talked about exercise
and diet and all those kinds of things

8112
02:00:55,830 --> 02:00:55,840
and diet and all those kinds of things
 

8113
02:00:55,840 --> 02:00:58,390
and diet and all those kinds of things
but the alcohol almost symbolizes

8114
02:00:58,390 --> 02:00:58,400
but the alcohol almost symbolizes
 

8115
02:00:58,400 --> 02:01:00,310
but the alcohol almost symbolizes
embracing the chaos of life

8116
02:01:00,310 --> 02:01:00,320
embracing the chaos of life
 

8117
02:01:00,320 --> 02:01:02,870
embracing the chaos of life
the the wild and the amazing things that

8118
02:01:02,870 --> 02:01:02,880
the the wild and the amazing things that
 

8119
02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:03,669
the the wild and the amazing things that
could happen

8120
02:01:03,669 --> 02:01:03,679
could happen
 

8121
02:01:03,679 --> 02:01:05,030
could happen
and i think that's really important

8122
02:01:05,030 --> 02:01:05,040
and i think that's really important
 

8123
02:01:05,040 --> 02:01:07,510
and i think that's really important
because if you optimize everything about

8124
02:01:07,510 --> 02:01:07,520
because if you optimize everything about
 

8125
02:01:07,520 --> 02:01:08,310
because if you optimize everything about
life

8126
02:01:08,310 --> 02:01:08,320
life
 

8127
02:01:08,320 --> 02:01:10,629
life
then you're going to miss most of the

8128
02:01:10,629 --> 02:01:10,639
then you're going to miss most of the
 

8129
02:01:10,639 --> 02:01:12,709
then you're going to miss most of the
fun stuff that happens in life

8130
02:01:12,709 --> 02:01:12,719
fun stuff that happens in life
 

8131
02:01:12,719 --> 02:01:14,550
fun stuff that happens in life
so it's not all about the optimization

8132
02:01:14,550 --> 02:01:14,560
so it's not all about the optimization
 

8133
02:01:14,560 --> 02:01:16,470
so it's not all about the optimization
it's some of it

8134
02:01:16,470 --> 02:01:16,480
it's some of it
 

8135
02:01:16,480 --> 02:01:18,790
it's some of it
like everyone has different things and

8136
02:01:18,790 --> 02:01:18,800
like everyone has different things and
 

8137
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:20,709
like everyone has different things and
what they how they introduce that chaos

8138
02:01:20,709 --> 02:01:20,719
what they how they introduce that chaos
 

8139
02:01:20,719 --> 02:01:22,390
what they how they introduce that chaos
in a controlled way for me

8140
02:01:22,390 --> 02:01:22,400
in a controlled way for me
 

8141
02:01:22,400 --> 02:01:24,470
in a controlled way for me
alcohol is that because i'm okay

8142
02:01:24,470 --> 02:01:24,480
alcohol is that because i'm okay
 

8143
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:25,990
alcohol is that because i'm okay
drinking not too much

02:01:28,870 --> 02:01:28,880
so i can control that aspect even though
 

8147
02:01:28,880 --> 02:01:29,350
so i can control that aspect even though
it's

so that's kind of their experience of it
that's probably the first thing that

8200
02:02:17,589 --> 02:02:17,599
that's probably the first thing that
 

8201
02:02:17,599 --> 02:02:17,990
that's probably the first thing that
would say

8202

some
places your mind went to make that

8212
02:02:27,030 --> 02:02:27,040
places your mind went to make that
 

8213
02:02:27,040 --> 02:02:29,350
places your mind went to make that
happen so this one is interesting to me

8214
02:02:29,350 --> 02:02:29,360
happen so this one is interesting to me
 

8215
02:02:29,360 --> 02:02:30,790
happen so this one is interesting to me
because

8216
02:02:30,790 --> 02:02:30,800
because
 

8217
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:33,270
because
i definitely recognized the boredom and

8218
02:02:33,270 --> 02:02:33,280
i definitely recognized the boredom and
 

8219
02:02:33,280 --> 02:02:35,030
i definitely recognized the boredom and
the the difference

8220
02:02:35,030 --> 02:02:35,040
the the difference
 

8221
02:02:35,040 --> 02:02:36,870
the the difference
the thing that the question i can't

8222
02:02:36,870 --> 02:02:36,880
the thing that the question i can't
 

8223
02:02:36,880 --> 02:02:38,470
the thing that the question i can't
quite answer i think with it is like

8224
02:02:38,470 --> 02:02:38,480
quite answer i think with it is like
 

8225
02:02:38,480 --> 02:02:39,510
quite answer i think with it is like
could i have

8226
02:02:39,510 --> 02:02:39,520
could i have
 

8227
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:41,430
could i have
remedied that with better preparation

8228
02:02:41,430 --> 02:02:41,440
remedied that with better preparation
 

8229
02:02:41,440 --> 02:02:43,589
remedied that with better preparation
because the scenario that put me on a

8230
02:02:43,589 --> 02:02:43,599
because the scenario that put me on a
 

8231
02:02:43,599 --> 02:02:45,589
because the scenario that put me on a
treadmill for 100 miles was

8232
02:02:45,589 --> 02:02:45,599
treadmill for 100 miles was
 

8233
02:02:45,599 --> 02:02:48,310
treadmill for 100 miles was
you know it was march 2020 basically the

8266
02:03:19,030 --> 02:03:19,040
and the treadmill was the closest thing
 

8267
02:03:19,040 --> 02:03:20,629
and the treadmill was the closest thing
to what i had been training for in terms

8268
02:03:20,629 --> 02:03:20,639
to what i had been training for in terms
 

8269
02:03:20,639 --> 02:03:22,070
to what i had been training for in terms
of just like a mechanical like flat

8270
02:03:22,070 --> 02:03:22,080
of just like a mechanical like flat
 

8271
02:03:22,080 --> 02:03:23,270

running essentially

8272
02:03:23,270 --> 02:03:23,280
running essentially
 

8273
02:03:23,280 --> 02:03:26,390
running essentially
that i could that i could think of and

8274
02:03:26,390 --> 02:03:26,400
that i could that i could think of and
 

8275
02:03:26,400 --> 02:03:29,589
that i could that i could think of and
uh my thought was okay well i'll

8276
02:03:29,589 --> 02:03:29,599
uh my thought was okay well i'll
 

8277
02:03:29,599 --> 02:03:31,750
uh my thought was okay well i'll
just live stream myself on a treadmill

8278
02:03:31,750 --> 02:03:31,760
just live stream myself on a treadmill
 

8279
02:03:31,760 --> 02:03:33,109
just live stream myself on a treadmill
and see what happens it ended up turning

8280
02:03:33,109 --> 02:03:33,119
and see what happens it ended up turning
 

8281
02:03:33,119 --> 02:03:33,669
and see what happens it ended up turning
into like a

8282
02:03:33,669 --> 02:03:33,679
into like a
 

8283
02:03:33,679 --> 02:03:35,669
into like a
quite a big event but so you don't

8284
02:03:35,669 --> 02:03:35,679
quite a big event but so you don't
 

8285
02:03:35,679 --> 02:03:37,350
quite a big event but so you don't
usually incorporate treadmill running

8286
02:03:37,350 --> 02:03:37,360
usually incorporate treadmill running
 

8287
02:03:37,360 --> 02:03:38,390
usually incorporate treadmill running
into your running

8288
02:03:38,390 --> 02:03:38,400
into your running
 

8289
02:03:38,400 --> 02:03:40,310
into your running
into your training i don't not

into your training i don't not
 

8291
02:03:40,320 --> 02:03:41,990

it in the way that would be necessarily
 

8295
02:03:43,440 --> 02:03:45,109
it in the way that would be necessarily
conducive to

conducive to
 

8297
02:03:45,119 --> 02:03:47,350
conducive to

was it that different than running on a

8304
02:03:51,430 --> 02:03:51,440
was it that different than running on a
 

8305
02:03:51,440 --> 02:03:53,109
was it that different than running on a
track it was

8306
02:03:53,109 --> 02:03:53,119
track it was
 

8307
02:03:53,119 --> 02:03:54,390
track it was
from the sense that here's the way i

8308
02:03:54,390 --> 02:03:54,400
from the sense that here's the way i
 

8309
02:03:54,400 --> 02:03:55,750
from the sense that here's the way i
describe it is when i'm on a track it's

8310
02:03:55,750 --> 02:03:55,760
describe it is when i'm on a track it's
 

8311
02:03:55,760 --> 02:03:56,950
describe it is when i'm on a track it's
a controlled environment

8312
02:03:56,950 --> 02:03:56,960
a controlled environment
 

8313
02:03:56,960 --> 02:03:59,430
a controlled environment
and everything can be very uniform but

8314
02:03:59,430 --> 02:03:59,440
and everything can be very uniform but
 

8315
02:03:59,440 --> 02:04:00,950
and everything can be very uniform but
there are tiny

8316
02:04:00,950 --> 02:04:00,960
there are tiny
 

8317
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:04,390
there are tiny
little micro adjustments in pace that

8318
02:04:04,390 --> 02:04:04,400
little micro adjustments in pace that
 

8319
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:06,709
little micro adjustments in pace that
that i'm doing subconsciously that give

8320
02:04:06,709 --> 02:04:06,719
that i'm doing subconsciously that give
 

8321
02:04:06,719 --> 02:04:07,990
that i'm doing subconsciously that give
me the sense of control

8322
02:04:07,990 --> 02:04:08,000
me the sense of control
 

8323
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:09,750
me the sense of control
right no i might run the exact same

8324
02:04:09,750 --> 02:04:09,760
right no i might run the exact same
 

8325
02:04:09,760 --> 02:04:11,270
right no i might run the exact same
split but there's like a

8326
02:04:11,270 --> 02:04:11,280
split but there's like a
 

8327
02:04:11,280 --> 02:04:13,589
split but there's like a
fraction of a second or you know a

8328
02:04:13,589 --> 02:04:13,599
fraction of a second or you know a
 

8329
02:04:13,599 --> 02:04:14,870
fraction of a second or you know a
fraction second faster than a fraction

8330
02:04:14,870 --> 02:04:14,880
fraction second faster than a fraction
 

8331
02:04:14,880 --> 02:04:16,310
fraction second faster than a fraction
of a second slower that equals the same

8332
02:04:16,310 --> 02:04:16,320
of a second slower that equals the same
 

8333
02:04:16,320 --> 02:04:16,950
of a second slower that equals the same
outcome

8334
02:04:16,950 --> 02:04:16,960
outcome
 

8335
02:04:16,960 --> 02:04:18,149
outcome
it gives you that sense of control

8336
02:04:18,149 --> 02:04:18,159
it gives you that sense of control
 

8337
02:04:18,159 --> 02:04:20,229
it gives you that sense of control
you're determining how fast you're going

8338
02:04:20,229 --> 02:04:20,239
you're determining how fast you're going
 

8339
02:04:20,239 --> 02:04:22,550
you're determining how fast you're going
on a treadmill you're responding to the

8340
02:04:22,550 --> 02:04:22,560
on a treadmill you're responding to the
 

8341
02:04:22,560 --> 02:04:23,270
on a treadmill you're responding to the
belt so

8342
02:04:23,270 --> 02:04:23,280
belt so
 

8343
02:04:23,280 --> 02:04:24,629
belt so
the advantage is you can set a pace and

8344
02:04:24,629 --> 02:04:24,639
the advantage is you can set a pace and
 

8345
02:04:24,639 --> 02:04:26,709
the advantage is you can set a pace and
know you're hitting it the disadvantage

8346
02:04:26,709 --> 02:04:26,719
know you're hitting it the disadvantage
 

8347
02:04:26,719 --> 02:04:27,510
know you're hitting it the disadvantage
is

8348
02:04:27,510 --> 02:04:27,520
is
 

8349
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:29,189
is
you're being told what to do by that

8350
02:04:29,189 --> 02:04:29,199
you're being told what to do by that
 

8351
02:04:29,199 --> 02:04:31,430
you're being told what to do by that
machine and that gets very frustrating

8352
02:04:31,430 --> 02:04:31,440
machine and that gets very frustrating
 

8353
02:04:31,440 --> 02:04:33,750
machine and that gets very frustrating
um i felt like i wanted to step off like

8354
02:04:33,750 --> 02:04:33,760
um i felt like i wanted to step off like
 

8355
02:04:33,760 --> 02:04:34,709
um i felt like i wanted to step off like
you get to like

8356
02:04:34,709 --> 02:04:34,719
you get to like
 

8357
02:04:34,719 --> 02:04:36,950
you get to like
certain points where you're just like

8358
02:04:36,950 --> 02:04:36,960
certain points where you're just like
 

8359
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:38,629
certain points where you're just like
like even stepping off what i noticed

8360
02:04:38,629 --> 02:04:38,639
like even stepping off what i noticed
 

8361
02:04:38,639 --> 02:04:40,229
like even stepping off what i noticed
i learned this on the day of actually i

8362
02:04:40,229 --> 02:04:40,239
i learned this on the day of actually i
 

8363
02:04:40,239 --> 02:04:41,350
i learned this on the day of actually i
noticed there's something where it

8364
02:04:41,350 --> 02:04:41,360
noticed there's something where it
 

8365
02:04:41,360 --> 02:04:42,870
noticed there's something where it
didn't really matter how long i get off

8366
02:04:42,870 --> 02:04:42,880
didn't really matter how long i get off
 

8367
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:44,470
didn't really matter how long i get off
like i'd get off to use the bathroom and

8368
02:04:44,470 --> 02:04:44,480
like i'd get off to use the bathroom and
 

8369
02:04:44,480 --> 02:04:45,910
like i'd get off to use the bathroom and
that was a little bit of a longer break

8370
02:04:45,910 --> 02:04:45,920
that was a little bit of a longer break
 

8371
02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:49,669
that was a little bit of a longer break
then i at some i had i had like a hiccup

8372
02:04:49,669 --> 02:04:49,679
then i at some i had i had like a hiccup
 

8373
02:04:49,679 --> 02:04:51,750
then i at some i had i had like a hiccup
during my event where we ran so much

8374
02:04:51,750 --> 02:04:51,760
during my event where we ran so much
 

8375
02:04:51,760 --> 02:04:53,510
during my event where we ran so much
power through one end of the house that

8376
02:04:53,510 --> 02:04:53,520
power through one end of the house that
 

8377
02:04:53,520 --> 02:04:55,350
power through one end of the house that
the screen on the treadmill was blacking

8378
02:04:55,350 --> 02:04:55,360
the screen on the treadmill was blacking
 

8379
02:04:55,360 --> 02:04:56,709
the screen on the treadmill was blacking
out yeah so

8380
02:04:56,709 --> 02:04:56,719
out yeah so
 

8381
02:04:56,719 --> 02:04:58,709
out yeah so
uh we ended up so i ended up jumping

8382
02:04:58,709 --> 02:04:58,719
uh we ended up so i ended up jumping
 

8383
02:04:58,719 --> 02:05:00,149
uh we ended up so i ended up jumping
back and forth on treadmills for quite a

8384
02:05:00,149 --> 02:05:00,159
back and forth on treadmills for quite a
 

8385
02:05:00,159 --> 02:05:00,950
back and forth on treadmills for quite a
bit in the beginning

8386
02:05:00,950 --> 02:05:00,960
bit in the beginning
 

8387
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:03,189
bit in the beginning
and i noticed even turning it off

8388
02:05:03,189 --> 02:05:03,199
and i noticed even turning it off
 

8389
02:05:03,199 --> 02:05:04,390
and i noticed even turning it off
stepping over and starting the other one

8390
02:05:04,390 --> 02:05:04,400
stepping over and starting the other one
 

8391
02:05:04,400 --> 02:05:04,709
stepping over and starting the other one
up

8392
02:05:04,709 --> 02:05:04,719
up
 

8393
02:05:04,719 --> 02:05:06,069
up
gave me like you know a handful of

8394
02:05:06,069 --> 02:05:06,079
gave me like you know a handful of
 

8395
02:05:06,079 --> 02:05:08,629
gave me like you know a handful of
seconds between was enough of a mental

8396
02:05:08,629 --> 02:05:08,639
seconds between was enough of a mental
 

8397
02:05:08,639 --> 02:05:10,390
seconds between was enough of a mental
break of just like that release of being

8398
02:05:10,390 --> 02:05:10,400
break of just like that release of being
 

8399
02:05:10,400 --> 02:05:11,350
break of just like that release of being
told what to do

8400
02:05:11,350 --> 02:05:11,360
told what to do
 

8401
02:05:11,360 --> 02:05:13,669
told what to do
yeah to reset so maybe if you were in

8402
02:05:13,669 --> 02:05:13,679
yeah to reset so maybe if you were in
 

8403
02:05:13,679 --> 02:05:14,629
yeah to reset so maybe if you were in
the future you would

8404
02:05:14,629 --> 02:05:14,639
the future you would
 

8405
02:05:14,639 --> 02:05:16,709
the future you would
figure out what exactly how much she's

8406
02:05:16,709 --> 02:05:16,719
figure out what exactly how much she's
 

8407
02:05:16,719 --> 02:05:18,550
figure out what exactly how much she's
needed to have them at the bank i never

8408
02:05:18,550 --> 02:05:18,560
needed to have them at the bank i never
 

8409
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:19,669
needed to have them at the bank i never
actually thought about that

8410
02:05:19,669 --> 02:05:19,679
actually thought about that
 

8411
02:05:19,679 --> 02:05:21,990
actually thought about that
that i mean obviously for you but also

8412
02:05:21,990 --> 02:05:22,000
that i mean obviously for you but also
 

8413
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,470
that i mean obviously for you but also
for people like me like amateur runners

8414
02:05:24,470 --> 02:05:24,480
for people like me like amateur runners
 

8415
02:05:24,480 --> 02:05:25,990
for people like me like amateur runners
that that's the source of frustration

8416
02:05:25,990 --> 02:05:26,000
that that's the source of frustration
 

8417
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:27,430
that that's the source of frustration
with the treadmill that there's

8418
02:05:27,430 --> 02:05:27,440
with the treadmill that there's
 

8419
02:05:27,440 --> 02:05:28,550
with the treadmill that there's
sometimes

8420
02:05:28,550 --> 02:05:28,560
sometimes
 

8421
02:05:28,560 --> 02:05:31,270
sometimes
a small adjustments in pace that we do

8422
02:05:31,270 --> 02:05:31,280
a small adjustments in pace that we do
 

8423

definitely like a switch that flips when
 

8701
02:09:51,199 --> 02:09:51,510
definitely like a switch that flips when
you

8702

02:09:54,719 --> 02:09:55,189
where then all of a sudden it goes from
like

8708
02:09:55,189 --> 02:09:55,199
like
 

8709
02:09:55,199 --> 02:09:56,870

been able to predict
 

8807
02:11:19,199 --> 02:11:22,310
been able to predict
uh and it's like this really interesting

8808
02:11:22,310 --> 02:11:22,320
uh and it's like this really interesting
 

8809
02:11:22,320 --> 02:11:22,950
uh and it's like this really interesting
unique

like human experience i think so for me
i spent most of my career at this point

8814
02:11:27,910 --> 02:11:27,920
i spent most of my career at this point
 

8815
02:11:27,920 --> 02:11:29,990
i spent most of my career at this point
like doing i got through that phase in a

8816
02:11:29,990 --> 02:11:30,000
like doing i got through that phase in a
 

8817
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:31,350
like doing i got through that phase in a
lot of the events i'm really interested

8818
02:11:31,350 --> 02:11:31,360
lot of the events i'm really interested
 

8819
02:11:31,360 --> 02:11:32,149
lot of the events i'm really interested
in

8820
02:11:32,149 --> 02:11:32,159
in
 

8821
02:11:32,159 --> 02:11:33,910
in
and then it was like now let's repeat it

8822
02:11:33,910 --> 02:11:33,920
and then it was like now let's repeat it
 

8823
02:11:33,920 --> 02:11:35,189
and then it was like now let's repeat it
and see if we can do it better and you

8824
02:11:35,189 --> 02:11:35,199
and see if we can do it better and you
 

8825
02:11:35,199 --> 02:11:36,550
and see if we can do it better and you
get into that mindset for a while which

8826
02:11:36,550 --> 02:11:36,560
get into that mindset for a while which
 

8827
02:11:36,560 --> 02:11:36,870
get into that mindset for a while which
is

8828
02:11:36,870 --> 02:11:36,880
is
 

8829
02:11:36,880 --> 02:11:39,430
is
also a fun mindset but there is that

8830
02:11:39,430 --> 02:11:39,440
also a fun mindset but there is that
 

8831
02:11:39,440 --> 02:11:40,870
also a fun mindset but there is that
kind of like uh

8832
02:11:40,870 --> 02:11:40,880
kind of like uh
 

8833
02:11:40,880 --> 02:11:42,950
kind of like uh
um desire to kind of have that human

8834
02:11:42,950 --> 02:11:42,960
um desire to kind of have that human
 

8835
02:11:42,960 --> 02:11:44,470
um desire to kind of have that human
experience again of like

8836
02:11:44,470 --> 02:11:44,480
experience again of like
 

8837
02:11:44,480 --> 02:11:46,069
experience again of like
you know not knowing what could happen

8838
02:11:46,069 --> 02:11:46,079
you know not knowing what could happen
 

8839
02:11:46,079 --> 02:11:48,229
you know not knowing what could happen
or is this doable type of a thing but

8840
02:11:48,229 --> 02:11:48,239
or is this doable type of a thing but
 

8841
02:11:48,239 --> 02:11:49,830
or is this doable type of a thing but
still doing it and figuring it out along

8842
02:11:49,830 --> 02:11:49,840
still doing it and figuring it out along
 

8843
02:11:49,840 --> 02:11:51,510
still doing it and figuring it out along
the way so i would describe the trans

8844
02:11:51,510 --> 02:11:51,520
the way so i would describe the trans
 

8845
02:11:51,520 --> 02:11:51,990
the way so i would describe the trans
continental

8846
02:11:51,990 --> 02:11:52,000
continental
 

8847
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:53,750
continental
project as something like that it's not

8848
02:11:53,750 --> 02:11:53,760
project as something like that it's not
 

8849
02:11:53,760 --> 02:11:55,270
project as something like that it's not
anything unique to me or anything new

8850
02:11:55,270 --> 02:11:55,280
anything unique to me or anything new
 

8851
02:11:55,280 --> 02:11:56,390
anything unique to me or anything new
there's been a lot of people who've done

8852
02:11:56,390 --> 02:11:56,400
there's been a lot of people who've done
 

8853
02:11:56,400 --> 02:11:57,430
there's been a lot of people who've done
it before

8854
02:11:57,430 --> 02:11:57,440
it before
 

8855
02:11:57,440 --> 02:11:59,189
it before
but essentially it's a route there's

8856
02:11:59,189 --> 02:11:59,199
but essentially it's a route there's
 

8857
02:11:59,199 --> 02:12:00,470
but essentially it's a route there's
different routes there's one kind of

8858
02:12:00,470 --> 02:12:00,480
different routes there's one kind of
 

8859
02:12:00,480 --> 02:12:01,910
different routes there's one kind of
main one that's done for like

8860
02:12:01,910 --> 02:12:01,920
main one that's done for like
 

8861
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:03,910
main one that's done for like
the that is used as the record route

8862
02:12:03,910 --> 02:12:03,920
the that is used as the record route
 

8863
02:12:03,920 --> 02:12:05,510
the that is used as the record route
more or less that you go from

8864
02:12:05,510 --> 02:12:05,520
more or less that you go from
 

8865
02:12:05,520 --> 02:12:07,430
more or less that you go from
san francisco to new york and

8866
02:12:07,430 --> 02:12:07,440
san francisco to new york and
 

8867
02:12:07,440 --> 02:12:09,510
san francisco to new york and
essentially you live out of an rv

8868
02:12:09,510 --> 02:12:09,520
essentially you live out of an rv
 

8869
02:12:09,520 --> 02:12:11,109
essentially you live out of an rv
uh while you're running so you run as

8870
02:12:11,109 --> 02:12:11,119
uh while you're running so you run as
 

8871
02:12:11,119 --> 02:12:12,629
uh while you're running so you run as
much as you can during the day then you

8872
02:12:12,629 --> 02:12:12,639
much as you can during the day then you
 

8873
02:12:12,639 --> 02:12:14,310
much as you can during the day then you
go to bed at night and then you get up

8874
02:12:14,310 --> 02:12:14,320
go to bed at night and then you get up
 

8875
02:12:14,320 --> 02:12:15,510
go to bed at night and then you get up
and do it again

8876
02:12:15,510 --> 02:12:15,520
and do it again
 

8877
02:12:15,520 --> 02:12:17,270
and do it again
and you're you're handling all the

8878
02:12:17,270 --> 02:12:17,280
and you're you're handling all the
 

8879
02:12:17,280 --> 02:12:19,030
and you're you're handling all the
logistics and the

8880
02:12:19,030 --> 02:12:19,040
logistics and the
 

8881
02:12:19,040 --> 02:12:21,430
logistics and the
process of trying to make sure you can

8882
02:12:21,430 --> 02:12:21,440
process of trying to make sure you can
 

8883
02:12:21,440 --> 02:12:22,870
process of trying to make sure you can
get up the next day and do again what

8884
02:12:22,870 --> 02:12:22,880
get up the next day and do again what
 

8885
02:12:22,880 --> 02:12:24,069
get up the next day and do again what
you did the day before which is going to

8886
02:12:24,069 --> 02:12:24,079
you did the day before which is going to
 

8887
02:12:24,079 --> 02:12:25,510
you did the day before which is going to
be the biggest difference so

8888
02:12:25,510 --> 02:12:25,520
be the biggest difference so
 

8889
02:12:25,520 --> 02:12:27,510
be the biggest difference so
for me i've done all single day ultra

8890
02:12:27,510 --> 02:12:27,520
for me i've done all single day ultra
 

8891
02:12:27,520 --> 02:12:28,790
for me i've done all single day ultra
marathons where

8892
02:12:28,790 --> 02:12:28,800
marathons where
 

8893
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:31,589
marathons where
you're going to wring yourself dry at

8894
02:12:31,589 --> 02:12:31,599
you're going to wring yourself dry at
 

8895
02:12:31,599 --> 02:12:33,510
you're going to wring yourself dry at
knowing the next day or week or however

8896
02:12:33,510 --> 02:12:33,520
knowing the next day or week or however
 

8897
02:12:33,520 --> 02:12:34,790
knowing the next day or week or however
long you need you're going to be able to

8898
02:12:34,790 --> 02:12:34,800
long you need you're going to be able to
 

8899
02:12:34,800 --> 02:12:35,990
long you need you're going to be able to
just kind of like shut everything down

8900

02:12:38,550 --> 02:12:38,560
with this
 

8905
02:12:38,560 --> 02:12:40,149
with this
like you know you're doing it again and

8906
02:12:40,149 --> 02:12:40,159
like you know you're doing it again and
 

8907

averaged just over 72 miles a day
 

8913
02:12:45,360 --> 02:12:47,270
averaged just over 72 miles a day
finished in 42 days six hours and 30

8914
02:12:47,270 --> 02:12:47,280
finished in 42 days six hours and 30
 

8915
02:12:47,280 --> 02:12:50,709
finished in 42 days six hours and 30
minutes and i mean just like 72 miles 73

8916
02:12:50,709 --> 02:12:50,719
minutes and i mean just like 72 miles 73
 

8917
02:12:50,719 --> 02:12:52,470
minutes and i mean just like 72 miles 73
miles and then like

8918
02:12:52,470 --> 02:12:52,480
miles and then like
 

8919
02:12:52,480 --> 02:12:54,310
miles and then like
next day again next day again just

8920
02:12:54,310 --> 02:12:54,320
next day again next day again just
 

8921
02:12:54,320 --> 02:12:55,589
next day again next day again just
knowing every day when you finish you

8922
02:12:55,589 --> 02:12:55,599
knowing every day when you finish you
 

8923
02:12:55,599 --> 02:12:57,189
knowing every day when you finish you
spend a whole day running and then okay

8924
02:12:57,189 --> 02:12:57,199
spend a whole day running and then okay
 

8925
02:12:57,199 --> 02:12:58,149
spend a whole day running and then okay
i'm gonna go to bed i'm gonna wake up in

8926
02:12:58,149 --> 02:12:58,159
i'm gonna go to bed i'm gonna wake up in
 

8927
02:12:58,159 --> 02:12:59,109
i'm gonna go to bed i'm gonna wake up in
the morning i'm gonna have to do this

8928
02:12:59,109 --> 02:12:59,119
the morning i'm gonna have to do this
 

8929
02:12:59,119 --> 02:13:00,390
the morning i'm gonna have to do this
again

8930
02:13:00,390 --> 02:13:00,400
again
 

8931
02:13:00,400 --> 02:13:02,149
again
and then you know have that happen for

8932
02:13:02,149 --> 02:13:02,159
and then you know have that happen for
 

8933
02:13:02,159 --> 02:13:03,430
and then you know have that happen for
six weeks and that's if it goes very

8934
02:13:03,430 --> 02:13:03,440
six weeks and that's if it goes very
 

8935
02:13:03,440 --> 02:13:03,990
six weeks and that's if it goes very
well

8936
02:13:03,990 --> 02:13:04,000
well
 

8937
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,709
well
so luck i assume is a big part of this

8938
02:13:06,709 --> 02:13:06,719
so luck i assume is a big part of this
 

8939
02:13:06,719 --> 02:13:07,990
so luck i assume is a big part of this
yeah for sure i mean there's just so

8940
02:13:07,990 --> 02:13:08,000
yeah for sure i mean there's just so
 

8941
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:09,830
yeah for sure i mean there's just so
many variables that are uncontrollable

8942
02:13:09,830 --> 02:13:09,840
many variables that are uncontrollable
 

8943
02:13:09,840 --> 02:13:11,189
many variables that are uncontrollable
on this type of an experience just

8944
02:13:11,189 --> 02:13:11,199
on this type of an experience just
 

8945
02:13:11,199 --> 02:13:12,709
on this type of an experience just
because i mean you go over the sierras

8946
02:13:12,709 --> 02:13:12,719
because i mean you go over the sierras
 

8947
02:13:12,719 --> 02:13:13,910
because i mean you go over the sierras
maybe you hit a storm

8948
02:13:13,910 --> 02:13:13,920
maybe you hit a storm
 

8949
02:13:13,920 --> 02:13:15,510
maybe you hit a storm
you know you try to time it most people

8950
02:13:15,510 --> 02:13:15,520
you know you try to time it most people
 

8951
02:13:15,520 --> 02:13:18,310
you know you try to time it most people
do it in start in september so you

8952
02:13:18,310 --> 02:13:18,320
do it in start in september so you
 

8953
02:13:18,320 --> 02:13:20,709
do it in start in september so you
can get over the mountain passes without

8954
02:13:20,709 --> 02:13:20,719
can get over the mountain passes without
 

8955
02:13:20,719 --> 02:13:22,550
can get over the mountain passes without
a big storm coming through

8956
02:13:22,550 --> 02:13:22,560
a big storm coming through
 

8957
02:13:22,560 --> 02:13:24,310
a big storm coming through
uh but then also get to the east coast

8958
02:13:24,310 --> 02:13:24,320
uh but then also get to the east coast
 

8959
02:13:24,320 --> 02:13:26,149
uh but then also get to the east coast
before it's like the middle of winter

8960
02:13:26,149 --> 02:13:26,159
before it's like the middle of winter
 

8961
02:13:26,159 --> 02:13:28,229
before it's like the middle of winter
so like september early september start

8962
02:13:28,229 --> 02:13:28,239
so like september early september start
 

8963
02:13:28,239 --> 02:13:29,430
so like september early september start
is kind of ideal

8964
02:13:29,430 --> 02:13:29,440
is kind of ideal
 

8965
02:13:29,440 --> 02:13:31,030
is kind of ideal
but you can you know i mean pete was

8966
02:13:31,030 --> 02:13:31,040
but you can you know i mean pete was
 

8967
02:13:31,040 --> 02:13:33,030
but you can you know i mean pete was
very fortunate from a weather standpoint

8968
02:13:33,030 --> 02:13:33,040
very fortunate from a weather standpoint
 

8969
02:13:33,040 --> 02:13:34,709
very fortunate from a weather standpoint
i think he made one big mistake we got a

8970
02:13:34,709 --> 02:13:34,719
i think he made one big mistake we got a
 

8971
02:13:34,719 --> 02:13:35,669
i think he made one big mistake we got a
little too aggressive in the beginning

8972
02:13:35,669 --> 02:13:35,679
little too aggressive in the beginning
 

8973
02:13:35,679 --> 02:13:37,030
little too aggressive in the beginning
had to take a full day off so he

8974
02:13:37,030 --> 02:13:37,040
had to take a full day off so he
 

8975
02:13:37,040 --> 02:13:38,629
had to take a full day off so he
actually averaged from a moving day

8976
02:13:38,629 --> 02:13:38,639
actually averaged from a moving day
 

8977
02:13:38,639 --> 02:13:41,430
actually averaged from a moving day
standpoint closer to 75 miles per day

8978
02:13:41,430 --> 02:13:41,440
standpoint closer to 75 miles per day
 

8979
02:13:41,440 --> 02:13:43,430
standpoint closer to 75 miles per day
um but yeah i mean there's going to be

8980
02:13:43,430 --> 02:13:43,440
um but yeah i mean there's going to be
 

8981
02:13:43,440 --> 02:13:44,629
um but yeah i mean there's going to be
things that i can't

8982
02:13:44,629 --> 02:13:44,639
things that i can't
 

8983
02:13:44,639 --> 02:13:46,310
things that i can't
prepare for won't know it's going to

8984
02:13:46,310 --> 02:13:46,320
prepare for won't know it's going to
 

8985
02:13:46,320 --> 02:13:48,310
prepare for won't know it's going to
happen and you know a lot of that will

8986
02:13:48,310 --> 02:13:48,320
happen and you know a lot of that will
 

8987
02:13:48,320 --> 02:13:48,870
happen and you know a lot of that will
get

8988
02:13:48,870 --> 02:13:48,880
get
 

8989
02:13:48,880 --> 02:13:50,229
get
a lot of the logistical stuff will get

8990
02:13:50,229 --> 02:13:50,239
a lot of the logistical stuff will get
 

8991
02:13:50,239 --> 02:13:52,069
a lot of the logistical stuff will get
leaned on with the crew so

8992
02:13:52,069 --> 02:13:52,079
leaned on with the crew so
 

8993
02:13:52,079 --> 02:13:53,350
leaned on with the crew so
that's i mean that's the hardest part

8994
02:13:53,350 --> 02:13:53,360
that's i mean that's the hardest part
 

8995
02:13:53,360 --> 02:13:55,510
that's i mean that's the hardest part
right now is just like getting all that

8996
02:13:55,510 --> 02:13:55,520
right now is just like getting all that
 

8997
02:13:55,520 --> 02:13:57,030
right now is just like getting all that
put together where it's like

8998
02:13:57,030 --> 02:13:57,040
put together where it's like
 

8999
02:13:57,040 --> 02:13:58,870
put together where it's like
okay i need to have the rv ready i need

9000
02:13:58,870 --> 02:13:58,880
okay i need to have the rv ready i need

the places figured out where we're going
to stop and and the people that

an activity like that
 

9013
02:14:07,840 --> 02:14:09,189
an activity like that
you know there's a lot of moving parts

9014
02:14:09,189 --> 02:14:09,199
you know there's a lot of moving parts
 

9015
02:14:09,199 --> 02:14:10,629
you know there's a lot of moving parts
even before you start the adventure

9016
02:14:10,629 --> 02:14:10,639
even before you start the adventure
 

9017
02:14:10,639 --> 02:14:11,109
even before you start the adventure
itself

9018
02:14:11,109 --> 02:14:11,119
itself
 

9019
02:14:11,119 --> 02:14:12,709
itself
when are you so you're you're taking the

and when are you doing the run september
1st is when uh you know barring anything

9026
02:14:19,109 --> 02:14:19,119
1st is when uh you know barring anything
 

9027
02:14:19,119 --> 02:14:20,870
1st is when uh you know barring anything
like catastrophic between now and then

9028
02:14:20,870 --> 02:14:20,880
like catastrophic between now and then
 

9029
02:14:20,880 --> 02:14:22,550
like catastrophic between now and then
it's really exciting but i mean it's

9030
02:14:22,550 --> 02:14:22,560
it's really exciting but i mean it's
 

9031

incredible so you
 

9033
02:14:23,679 --> 02:14:24,950
incredible so you
you'll probably have a bunch of people

9034
02:14:24,950 --> 02:14:24,960
you'll probably have a bunch of people
 

9035
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:26,629
you'll probably have a bunch of people
just randomly running with you are

9036
02:14:26,629 --> 02:14:26,639
just randomly running with you are
 

9037
02:14:26,639 --> 02:14:28,390
just randomly running with you are
people going to be tracking where you're

9038

02:14:42,719 --> 02:14:43,030
uh if i have a good experience uh you
know

9058
02:14:43,030 --> 02:14:43,040
know
 

9059
02:14:43,040 --> 02:14:44,390
know
chasing the record or going after the

9060
02:14:44,390 --> 02:14:44,400
chasing the record or going after the
 

9061
02:14:44,400 --> 02:14:46,790
chasing the record or going after the
record or at least getting close to it

9062
02:14:46,790 --> 02:14:46,800
record or at least getting close to it
 

9063
02:14:46,800 --> 02:14:48,950
record or at least getting close to it
so oh so you're gonna try to beat

9064
02:14:48,950 --> 02:14:48,960
so oh so you're gonna try to beat
 

9065
02:14:48,960 --> 02:14:49,669
so oh so you're gonna try to beat
this record

9066
02:14:49,669 --> 02:14:49,679
this record
 

9067
02:14:49,679 --> 02:14:51,669
this record
yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna go out with the

9068
02:14:51,669 --> 02:14:51,679
yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna go out with the
 

9069
02:14:51,679 --> 02:14:52,790
yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna go out with the
i'm gonna structure

9070
02:14:52,790 --> 02:14:52,800
i'm gonna structure
 

9071
02:14:52,800 --> 02:14:54,950
i'm gonna structure
the process in a way that leaves that

9072
02:14:54,950 --> 02:14:54,960
the process in a way that leaves that
 

9073
02:14:54,960 --> 02:14:56,550
the process in a way that leaves that
door open is the way i would describe it

9074
02:14:56,550 --> 02:14:56,560
door open is the way i would describe it
 

9075
02:14:56,560 --> 02:14:58,390
door open is the way i would describe it
i'm going to try not to do anything

9076
02:14:58,390 --> 02:14:58,400
i'm going to try not to do anything
 

9077
02:14:58,400 --> 02:15:01,030
i'm going to try not to do anything
that would potentially put it in a

9078
02:15:01,030 --> 02:15:01,040
that would potentially put it in a
 

9079
02:15:01,040 --> 02:15:02,229
that would potentially put it in a
situation where

9080
02:15:02,229 --> 02:15:02,239
situation where
 

9081
02:15:02,239 --> 02:15:03,830
situation where
that becomes the primary goal just

9082
02:15:03,830 --> 02:15:03,840
that becomes the primary goal just
 

9083
02:15:03,840 --> 02:15:05,270
that becomes the primary goal just
because i want to make sure that

9084
02:15:05,270 --> 02:15:05,280
because i want to make sure that
 

9085
02:15:05,280 --> 02:15:07,109
because i want to make sure that
the reason i decided in the first place

9086
02:15:07,109 --> 02:15:07,119
the reason i decided in the first place
 

9087
02:15:07,119 --> 02:15:08,629
the reason i decided in the first place
was for fight for the forgotten so i

9088
02:15:08,629 --> 02:15:08,639
was for fight for the forgotten so i
 

9089
02:15:08,639 --> 02:15:10,149
was for fight for the forgotten so i
want to make sure that i don't end up

9090
02:15:10,149 --> 02:15:10,159
want to make sure that i don't end up
 

9091
02:15:10,159 --> 02:15:12,069
want to make sure that i don't end up
two-thirds way across the country with a

9092
02:15:12,069 --> 02:15:12,079
two-thirds way across the country with a
 

9093
02:15:12,079 --> 02:15:13,910
two-thirds way across the country with a
broken leg and i'm like

9094
02:15:13,910 --> 02:15:13,920
broken leg and i'm like
 

9095
02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:16,229
broken leg and i'm like
hey guys uh i guess the donation

9096
02:15:16,229 --> 02:15:16,239
hey guys uh i guess the donation
 

9097
02:15:16,239 --> 02:15:18,390
hey guys uh i guess the donation
button's turned off

9098
02:15:18,390 --> 02:15:18,400
button's turned off
 

9099
02:15:18,400 --> 02:15:20,870
button's turned off
so focus on like don't sacrifice that

9100
02:15:20,870 --> 02:15:20,880
so focus on like don't sacrifice that
 

9101
02:15:20,880 --> 02:15:21,430
so focus on like don't sacrifice that
right

9102
02:15:21,430 --> 02:15:21,440
right
 

9103
02:15:21,440 --> 02:15:23,510
right
that goal but also there's a community

9104
02:15:23,510 --> 02:15:23,520
that goal but also there's a community
 

9105
02:15:23,520 --> 02:15:24,870
that goal but also there's a community
aspect to it

9106
02:15:24,870 --> 02:15:24,880
aspect to it
 

9107
02:15:24,880 --> 02:15:27,990
aspect to it
that i feel like are you going to

9108
02:15:27,990 --> 02:15:28,000
that i feel like are you going to
 

9109
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:29,669
that i feel like are you going to
i mean so you're going to document and

9110
02:15:29,669 --> 02:15:29,679
i mean so you're going to document and
 

9111
02:15:29,679 --> 02:15:31,189
i mean so you're going to document and
post yeah

9112
02:15:31,189 --> 02:15:31,199
post yeah
 

9113
02:15:31,199 --> 02:15:34,069
post yeah
but are you going to also is there a

9114
02:15:34,069 --> 02:15:34,079
but are you going to also is there a
 

9115
02:15:34,079 --> 02:15:35,510
but are you going to also is there a
safety perspective here it's like the

9116
02:15:35,510 --> 02:15:35,520
safety perspective here it's like the
 

9117
02:15:35,520 --> 02:15:36,709
safety perspective here it's like the
forest gump thing

9118
02:15:36,709 --> 02:15:36,719
forest gump thing
 

9119
02:15:36,719 --> 02:15:39,030
forest gump thing
you might have large numbers of crowds

9120
02:15:39,030 --> 02:15:39,040
you might have large numbers of crowds
 

9121
02:15:39,040 --> 02:15:41,189
you might have large numbers of crowds
that run along with you for a while

9122
02:15:41,189 --> 02:15:41,199
that run along with you for a while
 

9123
02:15:41,199 --> 02:15:43,189
that run along with you for a while
yeah worried about that kind of thing i

9124
02:15:43,189 --> 02:15:43,199
yeah worried about that kind of thing i
 

9125
02:15:43,199 --> 02:15:44,629
yeah worried about that kind of thing i
wouldn't say i'm worried about i mean i

9126
02:15:44,629 --> 02:15:44,639
wouldn't say i'm worried about i mean i
 

9127
02:15:44,639 --> 02:15:45,510
wouldn't say i'm worried about i mean i
think there's probably

9128
02:15:45,510 --> 02:15:45,520
think there's probably
 

9129
02:15:45,520 --> 02:15:47,189
think there's probably
there's remote enough spots along the

9130
02:15:47,189 --> 02:15:47,199
there's remote enough spots along the
 

9131
02:15:47,199 --> 02:15:48,870
there's remote enough spots along the
way where you'll get some alone time

9132
02:15:48,870 --> 02:15:48,880
way where you'll get some alone time
 

9133
02:15:48,880 --> 02:15:49,270
way where you'll get some alone time
more

9134
02:15:49,270 --> 02:15:49,280
more
 

9135
02:15:49,280 --> 02:15:51,430
more
more likely i don't necessarily mind if

9136
02:15:51,430 --> 02:15:51,440
more likely i don't necessarily mind if
 

9137
02:15:51,440 --> 02:15:52,870
more likely i don't necessarily mind if
people want to jump in there

9138
02:15:52,870 --> 02:15:52,880
people want to jump in there
 

9139
02:15:52,880 --> 02:15:54,550
people want to jump in there
there'll be some people that will

9140
02:15:54,550 --> 02:15:54,560
there'll be some people that will
 

9141
02:15:54,560 --> 02:15:55,910
there'll be some people that will
definitely want to do that and

9142
02:15:55,910 --> 02:15:55,920
definitely want to do that and
 

9143
02:15:55,920 --> 02:15:57,669
definitely want to do that and
and they can come in and but the reality

9144
02:15:57,669 --> 02:15:57,679
and they can come in and but the reality
 

9145
02:15:57,679 --> 02:15:58,950
and they can come in and but the reality
is like it's

9146
02:15:58,950 --> 02:15:58,960
is like it's
 

9147
02:15:58,960 --> 02:16:00,149
is like it's
probably not going to be a scenario

9148
02:16:00,149 --> 02:16:00,159
probably not going to be a scenario
 

9149
02:16:00,159 --> 02:16:02,390
probably not going to be a scenario
where there's like you know 40 people

9150
02:16:02,390 --> 02:16:02,400
where there's like you know 40 people
 

9151
02:16:02,400 --> 02:16:04,470
where there's like you know 40 people
following me at all times

9152
02:16:04,470 --> 02:16:04,480
following me at all times
 

9153
02:16:04,480 --> 02:16:06,550
following me at all times
you say that now yeah you never know

9154
02:16:06,550 --> 02:16:06,560
you say that now yeah you never know
 

9155
02:16:06,560 --> 02:16:08,069
you say that now yeah you never know
just wait for this podcast

9156
02:16:08,069 --> 02:16:08,079
just wait for this podcast
 

9157
02:16:08,079 --> 02:16:10,149
just wait for this podcast
yeah and then if joe finds out you're

9158
02:16:10,149 --> 02:16:10,159
yeah and then if joe finds out you're
 

9159
02:16:10,159 --> 02:16:12,310
yeah and then if joe finds out you're
doing this then we're really in trouble

9160
02:16:12,310 --> 02:16:12,320
doing this then we're really in trouble
 

9161
02:16:12,320 --> 02:16:14,709
doing this then we're really in trouble
all right so um i mean what are the

9162
02:16:14,709 --> 02:16:14,719
all right so um i mean what are the
 

9163
02:16:14,719 --> 02:16:15,990
all right so um i mean what are the
things that you think will be the

9164
02:16:15,990 --> 02:16:16,000
things that you think will be the
 

9165
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:17,109
things that you think will be the
hardest

9166
02:16:17,109 --> 02:16:17,119
hardest
 

9167
02:16:17,119 --> 02:16:19,109
hardest
for you and also like how do you train

9168
02:16:19,109 --> 02:16:19,119
for you and also like how do you train
 

9169
02:16:19,119 --> 02:16:21,589
for you and also like how do you train
for this kind of thing

9170
02:16:21,589 --> 02:16:21,599
for this kind of thing
 

9171
02:16:21,599 --> 02:16:24,229
for this kind of thing
um and what yeah what are the hardest

9172
02:16:24,229 --> 02:16:24,239
um and what yeah what are the hardest
 

9173
02:16:24,239 --> 02:16:25,589
um and what yeah what are the hardest
things you anticipate how do you train

9174
02:16:25,589 --> 02:16:25,599
things you anticipate how do you train
 

9175
02:16:25,599 --> 02:16:26,390
things you anticipate how do you train
for them

9176
02:16:26,390 --> 02:16:26,400
for them
 

9177
02:16:26,400 --> 02:16:27,990
for them
yeah so the way i'm looking at this is

9178
02:16:27,990 --> 02:16:28,000
yeah so the way i'm looking at this is
 

9179
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,310
yeah so the way i'm looking at this is
it's much less about performance from

9180
02:16:30,310 --> 02:16:30,320
it's much less about performance from
 

9181
02:16:30,320 --> 02:16:31,589
it's much less about performance from
the traditional sense

9182
02:16:31,589 --> 02:16:31,599
the traditional sense
 

9183
02:16:31,599 --> 02:16:34,950
the traditional sense
where i need to be able to be x fit

9184
02:16:34,950 --> 02:16:34,960
where i need to be able to be x fit
 

9185
02:16:34,960 --> 02:16:37,750
where i need to be able to be x fit
i think i need to be injury proof that's

9186
02:16:37,750 --> 02:16:37,760
i think i need to be injury proof that's
 

9187
02:16:37,760 --> 02:16:39,589
i think i need to be injury proof that's
what's going to be a

9188
02:16:39,589 --> 02:16:39,599
what's going to be a
 

9189
02:16:39,599 --> 02:16:41,589
what's going to be a
detriment if you think about it like if

9190
02:16:41,589 --> 02:16:41,599
detriment if you think about it like if
 

9191
02:16:41,599 --> 02:16:42,870
detriment if you think about it like if
i manage to average

9192
02:16:42,870 --> 02:16:42,880
i manage to average
 

9193
02:16:42,880 --> 02:16:46,230
i manage to average
nine minute mile pace for a day

9194
02:16:46,230 --> 02:16:46,240
nine minute mile pace for a day
 

9195
02:16:46,240 --> 02:16:48,950
nine minute mile pace for a day
that would be 80 miles in a 12 hour time

9196
02:16:48,950 --> 02:16:48,960
that would be 80 miles in a 12 hour time
 

9197
02:16:48,960 --> 02:16:49,429
that would be 80 miles in a 12 hour time
frame

9198
02:16:49,429 --> 02:16:49,439
frame
 

9199
02:16:49,439 --> 02:16:51,990
frame
so i'll easily have 12 hours of moving

9200
02:16:51,990 --> 02:16:52,000
so i'll easily have 12 hours of moving
 

9201
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:53,270
so i'll easily have 12 hours of moving
time per day

9202
02:16:53,270 --> 02:16:53,280
time per day
 

9203
02:16:53,280 --> 02:16:55,509
time per day
um nine minute pace i think is slow

9204
02:16:55,509 --> 02:16:55,519
um nine minute pace i think is slow
 

9205
02:16:55,519 --> 02:16:57,030
um nine minute pace i think is slow
enough that it's not an unreasonable

9206
02:16:57,030 --> 02:16:57,040
enough that it's not an unreasonable
 

9207
02:16:57,040 --> 02:16:57,830
enough that it's not an unreasonable
clip

9208
02:16:57,830 --> 02:16:57,840
clip
 

9209
02:16:57,840 --> 02:16:59,990
clip
so like when you i mean obviously

9210
02:16:59,990 --> 02:17:00,000
so like when you i mean obviously
 

9211
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,070
so like when you i mean obviously
there's things that slow you down or

9212
02:17:02,070 --> 02:17:02,080
there's things that slow you down or
 

9213
02:17:02,080 --> 02:17:03,830
there's things that slow you down or
i'll probably take walking breaks you

9214
02:17:03,830 --> 02:17:03,840
i'll probably take walking breaks you
 

9215
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:05,349
i'll probably take walking breaks you
know stopping breaks you got to

9216
02:17:05,349 --> 02:17:05,359
know stopping breaks you got to
 

9217
02:17:05,359 --> 02:17:06,709
know stopping breaks you got to
stay on top of nutrition that's the

9218
02:17:06,709 --> 02:17:06,719
stay on top of nutrition that's the
 

9219
02:17:06,719 --> 02:17:08,230
stay on top of nutrition that's the
other big thing too i'm probably eating

9220
02:17:08,230 --> 02:17:08,240
other big thing too i'm probably eating
 

9221
02:17:08,240 --> 02:17:09,990
other big thing too i'm probably eating
like anywhere between 10 to 15 000

9222
02:17:09,990 --> 02:17:10,000
like anywhere between 10 to 15 000
 

9223
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:11,589
like anywhere between 10 to 15 000
calories a day which is

9224
02:17:11,589 --> 02:17:11,599
calories a day which is
 

9225
02:17:11,599 --> 02:17:12,549
calories a day which is
you know i could probably count on my

9226
02:17:12,549 --> 02:17:12,559
you know i could probably count on my
 

9227
02:17:12,559 --> 02:17:13,990
you know i could probably count on my
hand a couple of occasions where i've

9228
02:17:13,990 --> 02:17:14,000
hand a couple of occasions where i've
 

9229
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:14,629
hand a couple of occasions where i've
eaten that much

9230
02:17:14,629 --> 02:17:14,639
eaten that much
 

9231
02:17:14,639 --> 02:17:16,469
eaten that much
in my life so now i got to do that for

9232
02:17:16,469 --> 02:17:16,479
in my life so now i got to do that for
 

9233
02:17:16,479 --> 02:17:17,990
in my life so now i got to do that for
six plus weeks in a row

9234
02:17:17,990 --> 02:17:18,000
six plus weeks in a row
 

9235
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:19,589
six plus weeks in a row
and you don't want any have any stomach

9236
02:17:19,589 --> 02:17:19,599
and you don't want any have any stomach
 

9237
02:17:19,599 --> 02:17:20,549
and you don't want any have any stomach
problems my friends are trying to

9238
02:17:20,549 --> 02:17:20,559
problems my friends are trying to
 

9239
02:17:20,559 --> 02:17:21,190
problems my friends are trying to
minimize

9240
02:17:21,190 --> 02:17:21,200
minimize
 

9241
02:17:21,200 --> 02:17:22,870
minimize
the amount of stomach problems would you

9242
02:17:22,870 --> 02:17:22,880
the amount of stomach problems would you
 

9243
02:17:22,880 --> 02:17:25,990
the amount of stomach problems would you
estimate about 12 to 13 to 14 hours of

9244
02:17:25,990 --> 02:17:26,000
estimate about 12 to 13 to 14 hours of
 

9245
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:27,110
estimate about 12 to 13 to 14 hours of
running every day

9246
02:17:27,110 --> 02:17:27,120
running every day
 

9247
02:17:27,120 --> 02:17:29,030
running every day
yeah that's probably like from from the

9248
02:17:29,030 --> 02:17:29,040
yeah that's probably like from from the
 

9249
02:17:29,040 --> 02:17:30,709
yeah that's probably like from from the
first step to the last step it'll

9250
02:17:30,709 --> 02:17:30,719
first step to the last step it'll
 

9251
02:17:30,719 --> 02:17:32,150
first step to the last step it'll
probably be somewhere around

9252
02:17:32,150 --> 02:17:32,160
probably be somewhere around
 

9253
02:17:32,160 --> 02:17:34,469
probably be somewhere around
like say 14 hours 13 hours or something

9254
02:17:34,469 --> 02:17:34,479
like say 14 hours 13 hours or something
 

9255
02:17:34,479 --> 02:17:35,349
like say 14 hours 13 hours or something
like that would be

9256
02:17:35,349 --> 02:17:35,359
like that would be
 

9257
02:17:35,359 --> 02:17:37,270
like that would be
a pretty good estimate and then getting

9258
02:17:37,270 --> 02:17:37,280
a pretty good estimate and then getting
 

9259
02:17:37,280 --> 02:17:39,509
a pretty good estimate and then getting
rest and so and then minimizing

9260
02:17:39,509 --> 02:17:39,519
rest and so and then minimizing
 

9261
02:17:39,519 --> 02:17:40,950
rest and so and then minimizing
the risk of injury which could be as

9262
02:17:40,950 --> 02:17:40,960
the risk of injury which could be as
 

9263
02:17:40,960 --> 02:17:43,429
the risk of injury which could be as
small as like like literally uneven

9264
02:17:43,429 --> 02:17:43,439
small as like like literally uneven
 

9265
02:17:43,439 --> 02:17:44,070
small as like like literally uneven
surfaces

9266
02:17:44,070 --> 02:17:44,080
surfaces
 

9267
02:17:44,080 --> 02:17:46,629
surfaces
resulting to like stepping the wrong way

9268
02:17:46,629 --> 02:17:46,639
resulting to like stepping the wrong way
 

9269
02:17:46,639 --> 02:17:48,629
resulting to like stepping the wrong way
i mean that's going to be a lot of steps

9270
02:17:48,629 --> 02:17:48,639
i mean that's going to be a lot of steps
 

9271
02:17:48,639 --> 02:17:50,790
i mean that's going to be a lot of steps
yeah yeah uh-huh so the probability of

9272
02:17:50,790 --> 02:17:50,800
yeah yeah uh-huh so the probability of
 

9273
02:17:50,800 --> 02:17:52,070
yeah yeah uh-huh so the probability of
injury are you worried about that kind

9274
02:17:52,070 --> 02:17:52,080
injury are you worried about that kind
 

9275
02:17:52,080 --> 02:17:52,790
injury are you worried about that kind
of stuff

9276
02:17:52,790 --> 02:17:52,800
of stuff
 

9277
02:17:52,800 --> 02:17:54,950
of stuff
is it can you strengthen the ankles or

9278
02:17:54,950 --> 02:17:54,960
is it can you strengthen the ankles or
 

9279
02:17:54,960 --> 02:17:56,950
is it can you strengthen the ankles or
those kinds of things that prevent

9280
02:17:56,950 --> 02:17:56,960
those kinds of things that prevent
 

9281
02:17:56,960 --> 02:17:58,469
those kinds of things that prevent
yeah possibility of injury and that's

9282
02:17:58,469 --> 02:17:58,479
yeah possibility of injury and that's
 

9283
02:17:58,479 --> 02:17:59,589
yeah possibility of injury and that's
that's where i'm putting a lot of my

9284
02:17:59,589 --> 02:17:59,599
that's where i'm putting a lot of my
 

9285
02:17:59,599 --> 02:18:00,309
that's where i'm putting a lot of my
focus in

9286
02:18:00,309 --> 02:18:00,319
focus in
 

9287
02:18:00,319 --> 02:18:03,509
focus in
is uh i think like just being running

9288
02:18:03,509 --> 02:18:03,519
is uh i think like just being running
 

9289
02:18:03,519 --> 02:18:05,669
is uh i think like just being running
fit is gonna be like generally speaking

9290
02:18:05,669 --> 02:18:05,679
fit is gonna be like generally speaking
 

9291
02:18:05,679 --> 02:18:07,110
fit is gonna be like generally speaking
is gonna be

9292
02:18:07,110 --> 02:18:07,120
is gonna be
 

9293
02:18:07,120 --> 02:18:09,990
is gonna be
important i'm gonna i think just from a

9294
02:18:09,990 --> 02:18:10,000
important i'm gonna i think just from a
 

9295
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:11,589
important i'm gonna i think just from a
lifetime of running is gonna be a huge

9296
02:18:11,589 --> 02:18:11,599
lifetime of running is gonna be a huge
 

9297
02:18:11,599 --> 02:18:12,469
lifetime of running is gonna be a huge
advantage

9298
02:18:12,469 --> 02:18:12,479
advantage
 

9299
02:18:12,479 --> 02:18:14,309
advantage
uh a lot of these like kind of like

9300
02:18:14,309 --> 02:18:14,319
uh a lot of these like kind of like
 

9301
02:18:14,319 --> 02:18:16,389
uh a lot of these like kind of like
mechanical movements are gonna be very

9302
02:18:16,389 --> 02:18:16,399
mechanical movements are gonna be very
 

9303
02:18:16,399 --> 02:18:18,070
mechanical movements are gonna be very
established it's just gonna be about can

9304
02:18:18,070 --> 02:18:18,080
established it's just gonna be about can
 

9305
02:18:18,080 --> 02:18:20,469
established it's just gonna be about can
i tolerate that volume of it

9306
02:18:20,469 --> 02:18:20,479
i tolerate that volume of it
 

9307
02:18:20,479 --> 02:18:22,070
i tolerate that volume of it
there i think i'm doing more strength

9308
02:18:22,070 --> 02:18:22,080
there i think i'm doing more strength
 

9309
02:18:22,080 --> 02:18:23,349
there i think i'm doing more strength
work i think this is something where

9310
02:18:23,349 --> 02:18:23,359
work i think this is something where
 

9311
02:18:23,359 --> 02:18:24,070
work i think this is something where
it's like

9312
02:18:24,070 --> 02:18:24,080
it's like
 

9313
02:18:24,080 --> 02:18:25,589
it's like
you know maybe adding five pounds of

9314
02:18:25,589 --> 02:18:25,599
you know maybe adding five pounds of
 

9315
02:18:25,599 --> 02:18:27,429
you know maybe adding five pounds of
lower body muscle is going to be an

9316
02:18:27,429 --> 02:18:27,439
lower body muscle is going to be an
 

9317
02:18:27,439 --> 02:18:28,950
lower body muscle is going to be an
advantage versus a disadvantage when

9318
02:18:28,950 --> 02:18:28,960
advantage versus a disadvantage when
 

9319
02:18:28,960 --> 02:18:30,150
advantage versus a disadvantage when
you're looking at power weight ratio

9320
02:18:30,150 --> 02:18:30,160
you're looking at power weight ratio
 

9321
02:18:30,160 --> 02:18:31,910
you're looking at power weight ratio
because i just don't really don't i

9322
02:18:31,910 --> 02:18:31,920
because i just don't really don't i
 

9323
02:18:31,920 --> 02:18:34,469
because i just don't really don't i
never need to be running a 648 mile for

9324
02:18:34,469 --> 02:18:34,479
never need to be running a 648 mile for
 

9325
02:18:34,479 --> 02:18:35,910
never need to be running a 648 mile for
this adventure

9326
02:18:35,910 --> 02:18:35,920
this adventure
 

9327
02:18:35,920 --> 02:18:39,030
this adventure
um and i so i'm looking at i'm doing a

9328
02:18:39,030 --> 02:18:39,040
um and i so i'm looking at i'm doing a
 

9329
02:18:39,040 --> 02:18:40,950
um and i so i'm looking at i'm doing a
lot more of that stuff focusing on that

9330
02:18:40,950 --> 02:18:40,960
lot more of that stuff focusing on that
 

9331
02:18:40,960 --> 02:18:43,030
lot more of that stuff focusing on that
the training is changing a fair bit

9332
02:18:43,030 --> 02:18:43,040
the training is changing a fair bit
 

9333
02:18:43,040 --> 02:18:43,990
the training is changing a fair bit
where

9334
02:18:43,990 --> 02:18:44,000
where
 

9335
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:45,830
where
it's more polarizing versus kind of

9336
02:18:45,830 --> 02:18:45,840
it's more polarizing versus kind of
 

9337
02:18:45,840 --> 02:18:47,509
it's more polarizing versus kind of
being i mean i've always had some

9338
02:18:47,509 --> 02:18:47,519
being i mean i've always had some
 

9339
02:18:47,519 --> 02:18:49,349
being i mean i've always had some
polarization in my training but this is

9340
02:18:49,349 --> 02:18:49,359
polarization in my training but this is
 

9341
02:18:49,359 --> 02:18:51,030
polarization in my training but this is
even to an extreme where like i'm gonna

9342
02:18:51,030 --> 02:18:51,040
even to an extreme where like i'm gonna
 

9343
02:18:51,040 --> 02:18:52,870
even to an extreme where like i'm gonna
do some simulations where

9344
02:18:52,870 --> 02:18:52,880
do some simulations where
 

9345
02:18:52,880 --> 02:18:55,270
do some simulations where
uh you know i go out and do two or three

9346
02:18:55,270 --> 02:18:55,280
uh you know i go out and do two or three
 

9347
02:18:55,280 --> 02:18:56,709
uh you know i go out and do two or three
days where i target

9348
02:18:56,709 --> 02:18:56,719
days where i target
 

9349
02:18:56,719 --> 02:18:58,309
days where i target
the exact thing i will be doing on the

02:19:00,389 --> 02:19:00,399
transcon you were on instagram posting
 

9353
02:19:00,399 --> 02:19:01,990
transcon you were on instagram posting
about these simulated runs so you

9354
02:19:01,990 --> 02:19:02,000
about these simulated runs so you
 

9355
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,790
about these simulated runs so you
legitimately like trying to perfectly

9356
02:19:04,790 --> 02:19:04,800
legitimately like trying to perfectly

let's say i do a

9368
02:19:14,549 --> 02:19:14,559
let's say i do a
 

9369
02:19:14,559 --> 02:19:16,549
let's say i do a
two or three day simulation where i'm

02:19:18,319 --> 02:19:20,150
averaging 70 miles a day
and i find out at the end of three days

9374
02:19:20,150 --> 02:19:20,160
and i find out at the end of three days
 

9375
02:19:20,160 --> 02:19:22,150
and i find out at the end of three days
there's a really weak spot here

9376
02:19:22,150 --> 02:19:22,160
there's a really weak spot here
 

9377
02:19:22,160 --> 02:19:23,830
there's a really weak spot here
um i need to address that or i need to

9378
02:19:23,830 --> 02:19:23,840
um i need to address that or i need to
 

9379
02:19:23,840 --> 02:19:25,669
um i need to address that or i need to
find a way to make that not a weak spot

9380
02:19:25,669 --> 02:19:25,679
find a way to make that not a weak spot
 

9381
02:19:25,679 --> 02:19:27,589
find a way to make that not a weak spot
i think that's the only way to really

9382
02:19:27,589 --> 02:19:27,599
i think that's the only way to really
 

9383
02:19:27,599 --> 02:19:29,429
i think that's the only way to really
get as close as you can to avoiding

9384
02:19:29,429 --> 02:19:29,439
get as close as you can to avoiding
 

9385
02:19:29,439 --> 02:19:29,830
get as close as you can to avoiding
injury

9386
02:19:29,830 --> 02:19:29,840
injury
 

9387
02:19:29,840 --> 02:19:31,270
injury
have you done that yet have you done a

9388
02:19:31,270 --> 02:19:31,280
have you done that yet have you done a
 

9389
02:19:31,280 --> 02:19:33,349
have you done that yet have you done a
two-day sony amount like even that's

9390
02:19:33,349 --> 02:19:33,359
two-day sony amount like even that's
 

9391
02:19:33,359 --> 02:19:35,509
two-day sony amount like even that's
incredibly difficult i haven't yet i'm

9392
02:19:35,509 --> 02:19:35,519
incredibly difficult i haven't yet i'm
 

9393
02:19:35,519 --> 02:19:36,549
incredibly difficult i haven't yet i'm
going to build up to it because that's

9394
02:19:36,549 --> 02:19:36,559
going to build up to it because that's
 

9395
02:19:36,559 --> 02:19:37,589
going to build up to it because that's
the other thing too is like

9396
02:19:37,589 --> 02:19:37,599
the other thing too is like
 

9397
02:19:37,599 --> 02:19:38,469
the other thing too is like
i don't think you want to be so

9398
02:19:38,469 --> 02:19:38,479
i don't think you want to be so
 

9399
02:19:38,479 --> 02:19:40,709
i don't think you want to be so
aggressive with that where you get

9400
02:19:40,709 --> 02:19:40,719
aggressive with that where you get
 

9401
02:19:40,719 --> 02:19:41,190
aggressive with that where you get
injured

9402
02:19:41,190 --> 02:19:41,200
injured
 

9403
02:19:41,200 --> 02:19:42,629
injured
trying to figure out how not to get

9404
02:19:42,629 --> 02:19:42,639
trying to figure out how not to get
 

9405
02:19:42,639 --> 02:19:44,950
trying to figure out how not to get
injured uh so i'll all

9406
02:19:44,950 --> 02:19:44,960
injured uh so i'll all
 

9407
02:19:44,960 --> 02:19:46,549
injured uh so i'll all
what i'm going to start what i just

9408
02:19:46,549 --> 02:19:46,559
what i'm going to start what i just
 

9409
02:19:46,559 --> 02:19:48,389
what i'm going to start what i just
started last week is i've

9410
02:19:48,389 --> 02:19:48,399
started last week is i've
 

9411
02:19:48,399 --> 02:19:50,630
started last week is i've
uh it looks really weird on my training

9412
02:19:50,630 --> 02:19:50,640
uh it looks really weird on my training
 

9413
02:19:50,640 --> 02:19:51,910
uh it looks really weird on my training
schedule because like last week i ran

9414
02:19:51,910 --> 02:19:51,920
schedule because like last week i ran
 

9415
02:19:51,920 --> 02:19:54,150
schedule because like last week i ran
almost 150 miles but i took two days off

9416
02:19:54,150 --> 02:19:54,160
almost 150 miles but i took two days off
 

9417
02:19:54,160 --> 02:19:55,030
almost 150 miles but i took two days off
so it's like

9418
02:19:55,030 --> 02:19:55,040
so it's like
 

9419
02:19:55,040 --> 02:19:56,710
so it's like
usually for me to get 150 miles that's a

9420
02:19:56,710 --> 02:19:56,720
usually for me to get 150 miles that's a
 

9421
02:19:56,720 --> 02:19:58,309
usually for me to get 150 miles that's a
seven day training week

9422
02:19:58,309 --> 02:19:58,319
seven day training week
 

9423
02:19:58,319 --> 02:19:59,750
seven day training week
uh so that's the way i'm doing it like i

9424
02:19:59,750 --> 02:19:59,760
uh so that's the way i'm doing it like i
 

9425
02:19:59,760 --> 02:20:02,630
uh so that's the way i'm doing it like i
did i did a day where i did uh you know

9426
02:20:02,630 --> 02:20:02,640
did i did a day where i did uh you know
 

9427
02:20:02,640 --> 02:20:05,990
did i did a day where i did uh you know
two like just over 20 milers separated

9428
02:20:05,990 --> 02:20:06,000
two like just over 20 milers separated
 

9429
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:07,830
two like just over 20 milers separated
with by just a couple hours and within

9430
02:20:07,830 --> 02:20:07,840
with by just a couple hours and within
 

9431
02:20:07,840 --> 02:20:09,349
with by just a couple hours and within
that couple hours i did like a three

9432
02:20:09,349 --> 02:20:09,359
that couple hours i did like a three
 

9433
02:20:09,359 --> 02:20:11,270
that couple hours i did like a three
three mile walk the following morning i

9434
02:20:11,270 --> 02:20:11,280
three mile walk the following morning i
 

9435
02:20:11,280 --> 02:20:13,190
three mile walk the following morning i
woke up and ran i think it was like just

9436
02:20:13,190 --> 02:20:13,200
woke up and ran i think it was like just
 

9437
02:20:13,200 --> 02:20:15,349
woke up and ran i think it was like just
over 36 miles first thing in the morning

9438
02:20:15,349 --> 02:20:15,359
over 36 miles first thing in the morning
 

9439
02:20:15,359 --> 02:20:16,870
over 36 miles first thing in the morning
just to get an idea of just like kind of

9440
02:20:16,870 --> 02:20:16,880
just to get an idea of just like kind of
 

9441
02:20:16,880 --> 02:20:18,389
just to get an idea of just like kind of
like what is it like to be

9442
02:20:18,389 --> 02:20:18,399
like what is it like to be
 

9443
02:20:18,399 --> 02:20:19,910
like what is it like to be
i mean this was in phoenix too so it was

9444
02:20:19,910 --> 02:20:19,920
i mean this was in phoenix too so it was
 

9445
02:20:19,920 --> 02:20:21,830
i mean this was in phoenix too so it was
100 degrees for the majority of that

9446
02:20:21,830 --> 02:20:21,840
100 degrees for the majority of that
 

9447
02:20:21,840 --> 02:20:24,870
100 degrees for the majority of that
to suffer then rest yeah suffer again

9448
02:20:24,870 --> 02:20:24,880
to suffer then rest yeah suffer again
 

9449
02:20:24,880 --> 02:20:26,790
to suffer then rest yeah suffer again
how that feels there's enough precedent

9450
02:20:26,790 --> 02:20:26,800
how that feels there's enough precedent
 

9451
02:20:26,800 --> 02:20:28,790
how that feels there's enough precedent
with this sort of an activity where

9452
02:20:28,790 --> 02:20:28,800
with this sort of an activity where
 

9453
02:20:28,800 --> 02:20:31,030
with this sort of an activity where
like everyone i've talked to so far has

9454
02:20:31,030 --> 02:20:31,040
like everyone i've talked to so far has
 

9455
02:20:31,040 --> 02:20:33,030
like everyone i've talked to so far has
told me like there's gonna be like this

9456
02:20:33,030 --> 02:20:33,040
told me like there's gonna be like this
 

9457
02:20:33,040 --> 02:20:34,870
told me like there's gonna be like this
kind of like gradual decline in the

9458
02:20:34,870 --> 02:20:34,880
kind of like gradual decline in the
 

9459
02:20:34,880 --> 02:20:36,230
kind of like gradual decline in the
early stages where you're just like okay

9460
02:20:36,230 --> 02:20:36,240
early stages where you're just like okay
 

9461
02:20:36,240 --> 02:20:37,190
early stages where you're just like okay
it's getting worse it's getting worse

9462
02:20:37,190 --> 02:20:37,200
it's getting worse it's getting worse
 

9463
02:20:37,200 --> 02:20:38,070
it's getting worse it's getting worse
it's getting worse

9464
02:20:38,070 --> 02:20:38,080
it's getting worse
 

9465
02:20:38,080 --> 02:20:39,510
it's getting worse
and you hit a point where you're just

9466
02:20:39,510 --> 02:20:39,520
and you hit a point where you're just
 

9467
02:20:39,520 --> 02:20:42,389
and you hit a point where you're just
like it hits kind of rock bottom

9468
02:20:42,389 --> 02:20:42,399
like it hits kind of rock bottom
 

9469
02:20:42,399 --> 02:20:44,070
like it hits kind of rock bottom
and then like it starts to kind of

9470
02:20:44,070 --> 02:20:44,080
and then like it starts to kind of
 

9471
02:20:44,080 --> 02:20:45,429
and then like it starts to kind of
gradually improve

9472
02:20:45,429 --> 02:20:45,439
gradually improve
 

9473
02:20:45,439 --> 02:20:47,670
gradually improve
so you kind of have to let yourself get

9474
02:20:47,670 --> 02:20:47,680
so you kind of have to let yourself get
 

9475
02:20:47,680 --> 02:20:50,070
so you kind of have to let yourself get
it's weird i think i can maybe

9476
02:20:50,070 --> 02:20:50,080
it's weird i think i can maybe
 

9477
02:20:50,080 --> 02:20:51,830
it's weird i think i can maybe
eliminate i'm trying to find a way to

9478
02:20:51,830 --> 02:20:51,840
eliminate i'm trying to find a way to
 

9479
02:20:51,840 --> 02:20:53,510
eliminate i'm trying to find a way to
eliminate some of that by

9480
02:20:53,510 --> 02:20:53,520
eliminate some of that by
 

9481
02:20:53,520 --> 02:20:56,070
eliminate some of that by
doing the simulations whereas i from

9482
02:20:56,070 --> 02:20:56,080
doing the simulations whereas i from
 

9483
02:20:56,080 --> 02:20:57,429
doing the simulations whereas i from
what i've seen i haven't seen a lot of

9484
02:20:57,429 --> 02:20:57,439
what i've seen i haven't seen a lot of
 

9485
02:20:57,439 --> 02:20:59,110
what i've seen i haven't seen a lot of
people do the simulation route yet

9486
02:20:59,110 --> 02:20:59,120
people do the simulation route yet
 

9487
02:20:59,120 --> 02:21:00,389
people do the simulation route yet
i've seen people just do like a lot of

9488
02:21:00,389 --> 02:21:00,399
i've seen people just do like a lot of
 

9489
02:21:00,399 --> 02:21:03,030
i've seen people just do like a lot of
training and then say like okay i'll

9490
02:21:03,030 --> 02:21:03,040
training and then say like okay i'll
 

9491
02:21:03,040 --> 02:21:04,630
training and then say like okay i'll
spend the first seven to ten days

9492
02:21:04,630 --> 02:21:04,640
spend the first seven to ten days
 

9493
02:21:04,640 --> 02:21:05,990
spend the first seven to ten days
adapting to this and then i'll get

9494
02:21:05,990 --> 02:21:06,000
adapting to this and then i'll get
 

9495
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:07,349
adapting to this and then i'll get
comfortable

9496
02:21:07,349 --> 02:21:07,359
comfortable
 

9497
02:21:07,359 --> 02:21:09,670
comfortable
within this environment and be fine

9498
02:21:09,670 --> 02:21:09,680
within this environment and be fine
 

9499
02:21:09,680 --> 02:21:11,110
within this environment and be fine
whereas i'm gonna try to get to a point

9500
02:21:11,110 --> 02:21:11,120
whereas i'm gonna try to get to a point
 

9501
02:21:11,120 --> 02:21:12,230
whereas i'm gonna try to get to a point
where like

9502
02:21:12,230 --> 02:21:12,240
where like
 

9503
02:21:12,240 --> 02:21:13,910
where like
some of that is already kind of cleared

9504
02:21:13,910 --> 02:21:13,920
some of that is already kind of cleared
 

9505
02:21:13,920 --> 02:21:15,750
some of that is already kind of cleared
up before i start but not so much that

9506
02:21:15,750 --> 02:21:15,760
up before i start but not so much that
 

9507
02:21:15,760 --> 02:21:17,349
up before i start but not so much that
i'm like adding like an extra essential

9508
02:21:17,349 --> 02:21:17,359
i'm like adding like an extra essential
 

9509
02:21:17,359 --> 02:21:18,710
i'm like adding like an extra essential
week to the trip

9510
02:21:18,710 --> 02:21:18,720
week to the trip
 

9511
02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:20,790
week to the trip
worth of running what what what do you

9512
02:21:20,790 --> 02:21:20,800
worth of running what what what do you
 

9513
02:21:20,800 --> 02:21:23,030
worth of running what what what do you
think would be the hardest simulator run

9514
02:21:23,030 --> 02:21:23,040
think would be the hardest simulator run
 

9515
02:21:23,040 --> 02:21:25,110
think would be the hardest simulator run
leading up to like will you do three

9516
02:21:25,110 --> 02:21:25,120
leading up to like will you do three
 

9517
02:21:25,120 --> 02:21:26,630
leading up to like will you do three
days yeah i think i'll probably try to

9518
02:21:26,630 --> 02:21:26,640
days yeah i think i'll probably try to
 

9519
02:21:26,640 --> 02:21:28,469
days yeah i think i'll probably try to
do three days

9520
02:21:28,469 --> 02:21:28,479
do three days
 

9521
02:21:28,479 --> 02:21:30,230
do three days
somewhere between 70 and 80 miles each

9522
02:21:30,230 --> 02:21:30,240
somewhere between 70 and 80 miles each
 

9523
02:21:30,240 --> 02:21:31,750
somewhere between 70 and 80 miles each
will be kind of like the goal

9524
02:21:31,750 --> 02:21:31,760
will be kind of like the goal
 

9525
02:21:31,760 --> 02:21:33,510
will be kind of like the goal
uh that'd be in august do you think how

9526
02:21:33,510 --> 02:21:33,520
uh that'd be in august do you think how
 

9527
02:21:33,520 --> 02:21:35,670
uh that'd be in august do you think how
close to yeah i would like it to be in

9528
02:21:35,670 --> 02:21:35,680
close to yeah i would like it to be in
 

9529
02:21:35,680 --> 02:21:37,270
close to yeah i would like it to be in
august like early august would be ideal

9530
02:21:37,270 --> 02:21:37,280
august like early august would be ideal
 

9531
02:21:37,280 --> 02:21:38,790
august like early august would be ideal
i think like maybe the first week in

9532
02:21:38,790 --> 02:21:38,800
i think like maybe the first week in
 

9533
02:21:38,800 --> 02:21:39,910
i think like maybe the first week in
august because that gives me kind of

9534
02:21:39,910 --> 02:21:39,920
august because that gives me kind of
 

9535
02:21:39,920 --> 02:21:41,270
august because that gives me kind of
three weeks to let things kind of settle

9536
02:21:41,270 --> 02:21:41,280
three weeks to let things kind of settle
 

9537
02:21:41,280 --> 02:21:42,550
three weeks to let things kind of settle
down from that but that's

9538
02:21:42,550 --> 02:21:42,560
down from that but that's
 

9539
02:21:42,560 --> 02:21:45,510
down from that but that's
crazy this is incredible it's it's

9540
02:21:45,510 --> 02:21:45,520
crazy this is incredible it's it's
 

9541
02:21:45,520 --> 02:21:46,710
crazy this is incredible it's it's
actually interesting because like if i

9542
02:21:46,710 --> 02:21:46,720
actually interesting because like if i
 

9543
02:21:46,720 --> 02:21:48,389
actually interesting because like if i
did let's say i did the simulation

9544
02:21:48,389 --> 02:21:48,399
did let's say i did the simulation
 

9545
02:21:48,399 --> 02:21:50,950
did let's say i did the simulation
now um the problem with that is like the

9546
02:21:50,950 --> 02:21:50,960
now um the problem with that is like the
 

9547
02:21:50,960 --> 02:21:52,150
now um the problem with that is like the
adaptations

9548
02:21:52,150 --> 02:21:52,160
adaptations
 

9549
02:21:52,160 --> 02:21:53,830
adaptations
from just like the breakdown and the

9550
02:21:53,830 --> 02:21:53,840
from just like the breakdown and the
 

9551
02:21:53,840 --> 02:21:55,190
from just like the breakdown and the
strengthening would likely be gone

9552
02:21:55,190 --> 02:21:55,200
strengthening would likely be gone
 

9553
02:21:55,200 --> 02:21:56,870
strengthening would likely be gone
unless i did it again

9554
02:21:56,870 --> 02:21:56,880
unless i did it again
 

9555
02:21:56,880 --> 02:21:59,750
unless i did it again
uh so i want to inch up to it so that

9556
02:21:59,750 --> 02:21:59,760
uh so i want to inch up to it so that
 

9557
02:21:59,760 --> 02:22:00,230
uh so i want to inch up to it so that
like

9558
02:22:00,230 --> 02:22:00,240
like
 

9559
02:22:00,240 --> 02:22:02,070
like
and get close enough to the starting

9560
02:22:02,070 --> 02:22:02,080
and get close enough to the starting
 

9561
02:22:02,080 --> 02:22:04,070
and get close enough to the starting
date so that i'm still kind of like

9562
02:22:04,070 --> 02:22:04,080
date so that i'm still kind of like
 

9563
02:22:04,080 --> 02:22:06,389
date so that i'm still kind of like
you know holding on to that adaptation

9564
02:22:06,389 --> 02:22:06,399
you know holding on to that adaptation
 

9565
02:22:06,399 --> 02:22:07,349
you know holding on to that adaptation
when i start started

9566
02:22:07,349 --> 02:22:07,359
when i start started
 

9567
02:22:07,359 --> 02:22:08,630
when i start started
so then those first few days maybe

9568
02:22:08,630 --> 02:22:08,640
so then those first few days maybe
 

9569
02:22:08,640 --> 02:22:10,950
so then those first few days maybe
aren't quite as miserable and you said

9570
02:22:10,950 --> 02:22:10,960
aren't quite as miserable and you said
 

9571
02:22:10,960 --> 02:22:13,990
aren't quite as miserable and you said
uh if everything goes amazing and you're

9572
02:22:13,990 --> 02:22:14,000
uh if everything goes amazing and you're
 

9573
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:14,790
uh if everything goes amazing and you're
challenging

9574
02:22:14,790 --> 02:22:14,800
challenging
 

9575
02:22:14,800 --> 02:22:17,190
challenging
the record it'll be like a 42 day run

9576
02:22:17,190 --> 02:22:17,200
the record it'll be like a 42 day run
 

9577
02:22:17,200 --> 02:22:18,550
the record it'll be like a 42 day run
yeah so that's what the record is almost

9578
02:22:18,550 --> 02:22:18,560
yeah so that's what the record is almost
 

9579
02:22:18,560 --> 02:22:19,830
yeah so that's what the record is almost
exactly six weeks

9580
02:22:19,830 --> 02:22:19,840
exactly six weeks
 

9581
02:22:19,840 --> 02:22:22,309
exactly six weeks
and that's at 72.5 miles per day so will

9582
02:22:22,309 --> 02:22:22,319
and that's at 72.5 miles per day so will
 

9583
02:22:22,319 --> 02:22:24,870
and that's at 72.5 miles per day so will
you be posting online and like

9584
02:22:24,870 --> 02:22:24,880
you be posting online and like
 

9585
02:22:24,880 --> 02:22:26,550
you be posting online and like

stuff along the way too
um yeah i'm still iron out exactly how

9592
02:22:33,110 --> 02:22:33,120
um yeah i'm still iron out exactly how
 

9593
02:22:33,120 --> 02:22:35,190
um yeah i'm still iron out exactly how
much i think at minimum i'll do

9594
02:22:35,190 --> 02:22:35,200
much i think at minimum i'll do
 

9595
02:22:35,200 --> 02:22:36,630

02:22:39,590 --> 02:22:39,600
during the day when i take like walking
 

9601
02:22:39,600 --> 02:22:40,389
during the day when i take like walking
breaks

9602
02:22:40,389 --> 02:22:40,399
breaks
 

9603
02:22:40,399 --> 02:22:42,710
breaks
uh partly just to kind of i think

9604
02:22:42,710 --> 02:22:42,720
uh partly just to kind of i think
 

9605
02:22:42,720 --> 02:22:44,230
uh partly just to kind of i think
keeping people in i mean it stays true

9606
02:22:44,230 --> 02:22:44,240
keeping people in i mean it stays true
 

9607
02:22:44,240 --> 02:22:44,950
keeping people in i mean it stays true
to the

9608
02:22:44,950 --> 02:22:44,960
to the
 

9609
02:22:44,960 --> 02:22:46,630
to the
the goal of raising awareness but it

9610
02:22:46,630 --> 02:22:46,640
the goal of raising awareness but it
 

9611
02:22:46,640 --> 02:22:49,110
the goal of raising awareness but it
also i find

9612
02:22:49,110 --> 02:22:49,120
also i find
 

9613
02:22:49,120 --> 02:22:51,510
also i find
when you bring people in there is an

9614
02:22:51,510 --> 02:22:51,520
when you bring people in there is an
 

9615
02:22:51,520 --> 02:22:52,710
when you bring people in there is an
added pressure to that

9616
02:22:52,710 --> 02:22:52,720
added pressure to that
 

9617
02:22:52,720 --> 02:22:55,429
added pressure to that
but there's also this sense that i've

9618
02:22:55,429 --> 02:22:55,439
but there's also this sense that i've
 

9619
02:22:55,439 --> 02:22:56,790
but there's also this sense that i've
learned from the treadmill experience

9620
02:22:56,790 --> 02:22:56,800
learned from the treadmill experience
 

9621
02:22:56,800 --> 02:22:58,150
learned from the treadmill experience
since we had like a pretty big

9622
02:22:58,150 --> 02:22:58,160
since we had like a pretty big
 

9623
02:22:58,160 --> 02:22:59,429
since we had like a pretty big
production for that

9624
02:22:59,429 --> 02:22:59,439
production for that
 

9625
02:22:59,439 --> 02:23:00,870
production for that
in the sense that i mean as much as you

9626
02:23:00,870 --> 02:23:00,880
in the sense that i mean as much as you
 

9627
02:23:00,880 --> 02:23:02,469
in the sense that i mean as much as you
can turn on a camera in your own house

9628
02:23:02,469 --> 02:23:02,479
can turn on a camera in your own house
 

9629
02:23:02,479 --> 02:23:03,510
can turn on a camera in your own house
but like

9630
02:23:03,510 --> 02:23:03,520
but like
 

9631
02:23:03,520 --> 02:23:06,469
but like
the i remember thinking we had like 30

9632
02:23:06,469 --> 02:23:06,479
the i remember thinking we had like 30

had that historically in fact they
 

9843
02:26:10,399 --> 02:26:11,990
had that historically in fact they
weren't even considered humans by like

9844
02:26:11,990 --> 02:26:12,000
weren't even considered humans by like
 

9845
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:13,830
weren't even considered humans by like
the local government for quite some time

9846
02:26:13,830 --> 02:26:13,840
the local government for quite some time
 

9847
02:26:13,840 --> 02:26:14,230
the local government for quite some time
and

9848
02:26:14,230 --> 02:26:14,240
and
 

9849
02:26:14,240 --> 02:26:15,670
and
you know the people that really pay the

9850
02:26:15,670 --> 02:26:15,680
you know the people that really pay the
 

9851
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:17,349
you know the people that really pay the
price in some of these situations are

9852
02:26:17,349 --> 02:26:17,359
price in some of these situations are
 

9853
02:26:17,359 --> 02:26:18,710
price in some of these situations are
the women because they're the ones that

9854
02:26:18,710 --> 02:26:18,720
the women because they're the ones that
 

9855
02:26:18,720 --> 02:26:20,389
the women because they're the ones that
get saddled with like the water

9856
02:26:20,389 --> 02:26:20,399
get saddled with like the water
 

9857
02:26:20,399 --> 02:26:22,630
get saddled with like the water
gathering and things like that so the

9858
02:26:22,630 --> 02:26:22,640
gathering and things like that so the
 

9859
02:26:22,640 --> 02:26:24,309
gathering and things like that so the
reason that justin picked wells

9860
02:26:24,309 --> 02:26:24,319
reason that justin picked wells
 

9861
02:26:24,319 --> 02:26:25,510
reason that justin picked wells
to build was because he thought to

9862
02:26:25,510 --> 02:26:25,520
to build was because he thought to
 

9863
02:26:25,520 --> 02:26:27,590
to build was because he thought to
himself if we can get them wells

9864
02:26:27,590 --> 02:26:27,600
himself if we can get them wells
 

9865
02:26:27,600 --> 02:26:29,429
himself if we can get them wells
then now these women don't to spend all

9866
02:26:29,429 --> 02:26:29,439
then now these women don't to spend all
 

9867
02:26:29,439 --> 02:26:31,670
then now these women don't to spend all
day walking and carrying water

9868
02:26:31,670 --> 02:26:31,680
day walking and carrying water
 

9869
02:26:31,680 --> 02:26:33,510
day walking and carrying water
now they can just get that water and now

9870
02:26:33,510 --> 02:26:33,520
now they can just get that water and now
 

9871
02:26:33,520 --> 02:26:35,429
now they can just get that water and now
we have half the population freed up for

9872
02:26:35,429 --> 02:26:35,439
we have half the population freed up for
 

9873
02:26:35,439 --> 02:26:36,790
we have half the population freed up for
other things now maybe they can start

9874
02:26:36,790 --> 02:26:36,800
other things now maybe they can start
 

9875
02:26:36,800 --> 02:26:37,349
other things now maybe they can start
farms

9876
02:26:37,349 --> 02:26:37,359
farms
 

9877
02:26:37,359 --> 02:26:39,110
farms
they can build some housing and stuff

9878
02:26:39,110 --> 02:26:39,120
they can build some housing and stuff
 

9879
02:26:39,120 --> 02:26:40,389
they can build some housing and stuff
like that and it just

9880
02:26:40,389 --> 02:26:40,399
like that and it just
 

9881
02:26:40,399 --> 02:26:42,550
like that and it just
it exponentially improves once you take

9882
02:26:42,550 --> 02:26:42,560
it exponentially improves once you take
 

9883
02:26:42,560 --> 02:26:43,429
it exponentially improves once you take
care of some of those

9884
02:26:43,429 --> 02:26:43,439
care of some of those
 

9885
02:26:43,439 --> 02:26:46,550
care of some of those
big key early things so when i'm

9886
02:26:46,550 --> 02:26:46,560
big key early things so when i'm
 

9887
02:26:46,560 --> 02:26:47,750
big key early things so when i'm
thinking about like

9888
02:26:47,750 --> 02:26:47,760
thinking about like
 

9889
02:26:47,760 --> 02:26:49,270
thinking about like
you know do i really need to go out here

9890
02:26:49,270 --> 02:26:49,280
you know do i really need to go out here

02:26:49,280 --> 02:26:51,030
you know do i really need to go out here
and travel another 12 hours a day my

9892
02:26:51,030 --> 02:26:51,040
and travel another 12 hours a day my
 

9893
02:26:51,040 --> 02:26:52,630
and travel another 12 hours a day my
mind's going to hopefully go to

9894
02:26:52,630 --> 02:26:52,640
mind's going to hopefully go to
 

9895
02:26:52,640 --> 02:26:54,469
mind's going to hopefully go to
well if one of those women woke up in

02:27:06,070 --> 02:27:06,080
hopefully but
 

9911
02:27:06,080 --> 02:27:07,910
hopefully but
yeah yeah i mean the reality is always

9912
02:27:07,910 --> 02:27:07,920
yeah yeah i mean the reality is always
 

9913
02:27:07,920 --> 02:27:09,910
yeah yeah i mean the reality is always
there where i don't have to do it like

9914
02:27:09,910 --> 02:27:09,920
there where i don't have to do it like
 

9915
02:27:09,920 --> 02:27:10,469
there where i don't have to do it like
they do

9916
02:27:10,469 --> 02:27:10,479
they do
 

9917
02:27:10,479 --> 02:27:13,110
they do
have to do it so you know but i think

9918
02:27:13,110 --> 02:27:13,120
have to do it so you know but i think
 

9919
02:27:13,120 --> 02:27:15,110
have to do it so you know but i think
just keeping that perspective

9920
02:27:15,110 --> 02:27:15,120
just keeping that perspective
 

9921
02:27:15,120 --> 02:27:18,150
just keeping that perspective
it it puts us back to the beginning

9922
02:27:18,150 --> 02:27:18,160
it it puts us back to the beginning
 

9923
02:27:18,160 --> 02:27:19,110
it it puts us back to the beginning
where

9924
02:27:19,110 --> 02:27:19,120
where
 

9925
02:27:19,120 --> 02:27:20,790
where
it's this is one of those situations

9926
02:27:20,790 --> 02:27:20,800
it's this is one of those situations
 

9927
02:27:20,800 --> 02:27:22,309
it's this is one of those situations
where i think it's like

9928
02:27:22,309 --> 02:27:22,319
where i think it's like
 

9929
02:27:22,319 --> 02:27:25,030
where i think it's like
uh a no-quit situation you have to put

9930
02:27:25,030 --> 02:27:25,040
uh a no-quit situation you have to put
 

9931
02:27:25,040 --> 02:27:26,950
uh a no-quit situation you have to put
yourself in a no-quit situation here

9932
02:27:26,950 --> 02:27:26,960
yourself in a no-quit situation here
 

9933
02:27:26,960 --> 02:27:27,750
yourself in a no-quit situation here
because it's

9934
02:27:27,750 --> 02:27:27,760
because it's
 

9935
02:27:27,760 --> 02:27:30,550
because it's
uh you know it's just bigger than you i

9936
02:27:30,550 --> 02:27:30,560
uh you know it's just bigger than you i
 

9937
02:27:30,560 --> 02:27:32,790
uh you know it's just bigger than you i
can't wait to see like the dark places

9938
02:27:32,790 --> 02:27:32,800
can't wait to see like the dark places
 

9939
02:27:32,800 --> 02:27:33,510
can't wait to see like the dark places
you go

9940
02:27:33,510 --> 02:27:33,520
you go
 

9941
02:27:33,520 --> 02:27:35,590
you go
i mean there's some yeah the the quit

9942
02:27:35,590 --> 02:27:35,600
i mean there's some yeah the the quit
 

9943
02:27:35,600 --> 02:27:37,030
i mean there's some yeah the the quit
situations

9944
02:27:37,030 --> 02:27:37,040
situations
 

9945
02:27:37,040 --> 02:27:39,110
situations
and hopefully we get to have a glimpse

9946
02:27:39,110 --> 02:27:39,120
and hopefully we get to have a glimpse
 

9947
02:27:39,120 --> 02:27:40,230
and hopefully we get to have a glimpse
of those because i think those are

9948
02:27:40,230 --> 02:27:40,240
of those because i think those are
 

9949
02:27:40,240 --> 02:27:41,349
of those because i think those are
really inspiring

9950
02:27:41,349 --> 02:27:41,359
really inspiring
 

9951
02:27:41,359 --> 02:27:44,630
really inspiring
when somebody is uh both gets broken by

9958
02:27:49,510 --> 02:27:49,520
also it's almost broken and overcomes it
 

9959
02:27:49,520 --> 02:27:51,190
also it's almost broken and overcomes it
i mean that's just fascinating stories i

9960
02:27:51,190 --> 02:27:51,200
i mean that's just fascinating stories i
 

9961
02:27:51,200 --> 02:27:52,150
i mean that's just fascinating stories i
can't wait

9962
02:27:52,150 --> 02:27:52,160
can't wait
 

9963
02:27:52,160 --> 02:27:53,990
can't wait
i i know does joe know you're doing this

9964
02:27:53,990 --> 02:27:54,000
i i know does joe know you're doing this
 

9965
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,230
i i know does joe know you're doing this
by the way yeah i sent him

9966
02:27:56,230 --> 02:27:56,240
by the way yeah i sent him
 

9967
02:27:56,240 --> 02:27:57,670
by the way yeah i sent him
i sent him a note a while back because

9968
02:27:57,670 --> 02:27:57,680
i sent him a note a while back because
 

9969
02:27:57,680 --> 02:27:59,429
i sent him a note a while back because
he was the first spot i mentioned it on

9970
02:27:59,429 --> 02:27:59,439
he was the first spot i mentioned it on
 

9971
02:27:59,439 --> 02:28:01,110
he was the first spot i mentioned it on
so i think he he knows i'm not sure if

9972
02:28:01,110 --> 02:28:01,120
so i think he he knows i'm not sure if
 

9973
02:28:01,120 --> 02:28:02,389
so i think he he knows i'm not sure if
he's followed along about the exact

9974
02:28:02,389 --> 02:28:02,399
he's followed along about the exact
 

9975
02:28:02,399 --> 02:28:03,830
he's followed along about the exact
starting date or well he will no

9976
02:28:03,830 --> 02:28:03,840
starting date or well he will no
 

9977
02:28:03,840 --> 02:28:06,230
starting date or well he will no
this is great you'll probably think

9978
02:28:06,230 --> 02:28:06,240
this is great you'll probably think
 

9979

9989
02:28:15,359 --> 02:28:17,349
it
ridiculous question who's the greatest

9990
02:28:17,349 --> 02:28:17,359
ridiculous question who's the greatest
 

9991
02:28:17,359 --> 02:28:19,270
ridiculous question who's the greatest
endurance runner

9992
02:28:19,270 --> 02:28:19,280
endurance runner
 

9993
02:28:19,280 --> 02:28:22,230
endurance runner
or endurance athlete of all time oh

9994
02:28:22,230 --> 02:28:22,240
or endurance athlete of all time oh
 

9995
02:28:22,240 --> 02:28:23,510
or endurance athlete of all time oh
that's a good question

9996
02:28:23,510 --> 02:28:23,520
that's a good question
 

9997
02:28:23,520 --> 02:28:27,030
that's a good question
um i think i'd probably go

9998
02:28:27,030 --> 02:28:27,040
um i think i'd probably go
 

9999
02:28:27,040 --> 02:28:31,190
um i think i'd probably go
maybe two directions here uh

10000
02:28:31,190 --> 02:28:31,200
maybe two directions here uh
 

10001

maybe two directions here uh
i think uh helly gabor lassie is

10002
02:28:35,190 --> 02:28:35,200
i think uh helly gabor lassie is
 

10003
02:28:35,200 --> 02:28:40,070
i think uh helly gabor lassie is
one of the best in my opinion because

10004
02:28:40,070 --> 02:28:40,080
one of the best in my opinion because
 

10005
02:28:40,080 --> 02:28:43,190
one of the best in my opinion because
just i mean 27 world records

10006
02:28:43,190 --> 02:28:43,200
just i mean 27 world records
 

10007
02:28:43,200 --> 02:28:45,670
just i mean 27 world records
like like not all the different distance

10008
02:28:45,670 --> 02:28:45,680
like like not all the different distance
 

10009
02:28:45,680 --> 02:28:46,389
like like not all the different distance
but like

10010
02:28:46,389 --> 02:28:46,399
but like
 

10011
02:28:46,399 --> 02:28:47,990
but like
breaking and rebraking and that sort of

10012
02:28:47,990 --> 02:28:48,000
breaking and rebraking and that sort of
 

10013
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:49,590
breaking and rebraking and that sort of
stuff um

10014
02:28:49,590 --> 02:28:49,600
stuff um
 

10015
02:28:49,600 --> 02:28:53,429
stuff um
i mean he ran two what was it 203

10016
02:28:53,429 --> 02:28:53,439
i mean he ran two what was it 203
 

10017
02:28:53,439 --> 02:28:56,469
i mean he ran two what was it 203
59 before the shoot technology came in

10018
02:28:56,469 --> 02:28:56,479
59 before the shoot technology came in
 

10019
02:28:56,479 --> 02:28:58,309
59 before the shoot technology came in
that is estimated at anywhere between a

10020
02:28:58,309 --> 02:28:58,319
that is estimated at anywhere between a
 

10021
02:28:58,319 --> 02:28:59,670
that is estimated at anywhere between a
two to eight percent performance

10022
02:28:59,670 --> 02:28:59,680
two to eight percent performance
 

10023
02:28:59,680 --> 02:29:00,790
two to eight percent performance
advantage talking about a two hour

10024
02:29:00,790 --> 02:29:00,800
advantage talking about a two hour
 

10025
02:29:00,800 --> 02:29:01,590
advantage talking about a two hour
marathon two

10026
02:29:01,590 --> 02:29:01,600
marathon two
 

10027
02:29:01,600 --> 02:29:04,309
marathon two
zero three yep two hour three minutes

10028
02:29:04,309 --> 02:29:04,319
zero three yep two hour three minutes
 

10029
02:29:04,319 --> 02:29:05,590
zero three yep two hour three minutes
yeah so he did that with the old shoe

10030
02:29:05,590 --> 02:29:05,600
yeah so he did that with the old shoe
 

10031
02:29:05,600 --> 02:29:06,790
yeah so he did that with the old shoe
technology

10032
02:29:06,790 --> 02:29:06,800
technology
 

10033
02:29:06,800 --> 02:29:08,870
technology
which uh essentially dates back to

10034
02:29:08,870 --> 02:29:08,880
which uh essentially dates back to
 

10035
02:29:08,880 --> 02:29:10,150
which uh essentially dates back to
anything if

10036
02:29:10,150 --> 02:29:10,160
anything if
 

10037
02:29:10,160 --> 02:29:12,150
anything if
if you were a nike athlete it could date

10038
02:29:12,150 --> 02:29:12,160
if you were a nike athlete it could date
 

10039
02:29:12,160 --> 02:29:14,230
if you were a nike athlete it could date
back to as early as

10040
02:29:14,230 --> 02:29:14,240
back to as early as
 

10041
02:29:14,240 --> 02:29:16,309
back to as early as
i think early 2016 is when the first

10042
02:29:16,309 --> 02:29:16,319
i think early 2016 is when the first
 

10043
02:29:16,319 --> 02:29:17,910
i think early 2016 is when the first
prototype started showing up

10044
02:29:17,910 --> 02:29:17,920
prototype started showing up
 

10045
02:29:17,920 --> 02:29:19,990
prototype started showing up
uh so if you're before that in your

10046
02:29:19,990 --> 02:29:20,000
uh so if you're before that in your
 

10047
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:21,590
uh so if you're before that in your
career you are using you're guaranteed

10048
02:29:21,590 --> 02:29:21,600
career you are using you're guaranteed
 

10049
02:29:21,600 --> 02:29:23,590
career you are using you're guaranteed
to be using the old shoe technology

10050
02:29:23,590 --> 02:29:23,600
to be using the old shoe technology
 

10051
02:29:23,600 --> 02:29:26,630
to be using the old shoe technology
um and i mean just the range of it too

10052
02:29:26,630 --> 02:29:26,640
um and i mean just the range of it too
 

10053
02:29:26,640 --> 02:29:29,429
um and i mean just the range of it too
and uh yeah it's it's hard i mean

10054
02:29:29,429 --> 02:29:29,439
and uh yeah it's it's hard i mean
 

10055
02:29:29,439 --> 02:29:29,990
and uh yeah it's it's hard i mean
there's there

10056
02:29:29,990 --> 02:29:30,000
there's there
 

10057
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,389
there's there
it's uh is he a marathon runner purely

10058
02:29:32,389 --> 02:29:32,399
it's uh is he a marathon runner purely
 

10059
02:29:32,399 --> 02:29:33,750
it's uh is he a marathon runner purely
no he did everything that's why i pick

10060
02:29:33,750 --> 02:29:33,760
no he did everything that's why i pick
 

10061
02:29:33,760 --> 02:29:34,710
no he did everything that's why i pick
him i think because he

10062
02:29:34,710 --> 02:29:34,720
him i think because he
 

10063
02:29:34,720 --> 02:29:36,389
him i think because he
he he went everywhere everything from

10064
02:29:36,389 --> 02:29:36,399
he he went everywhere everything from
 

10065
02:29:36,399 --> 02:29:37,830
he he went everywhere everything from
the 800 and his like

10066
02:29:37,830 --> 02:29:37,840

02:29:40,240 --> 02:29:41,670
at a national 800 yeah at a national
level i don't he wasn't competing

10070
02:29:41,670 --> 02:29:41,680
level i don't he wasn't competing
 

10071
02:29:41,680 --> 02:29:43,590
level i don't he wasn't competing
at like olympics or anything in the 800

but he was he was
 

10075
02:29:44,880 --> 02:29:48,230

02:29:52,230 --> 02:29:52,240
could go a totally different direction
 

10081
02:29:52,240 --> 02:29:53,830
could go a totally different direction
too i think like steve prefontaine

10082

too i think like steve prefontaine
 

10083
02:29:53,840 --> 02:29:54,469
too i think like steve prefontaine
stands out

10084
02:29:54,469 --> 02:29:54,479
stands out
 

10085
02:29:54,479 --> 02:29:56,550
stands out
in as an american runner just because if

10086
02:29:56,550 --> 02:29:56,560
in as an american runner just because if
 

10087
02:29:56,560 --> 02:29:58,150
in as an american runner just because if
you look at it outside of just like

10088
02:29:58,150 --> 02:29:58,160
you look at it outside of just like
 

10089
02:29:58,160 --> 02:29:59,510
you look at it outside of just like
performances

10090
02:29:59,510 --> 02:29:59,520
performances
 

10091
02:29:59,520 --> 02:30:02,830
performances

to bleed to do it because he's gonna be

10172
02:31:12,790 --> 02:31:12,800
to bleed to do it because he's gonna be
 

10173
02:31:12,800 --> 02:31:14,070
to bleed to do it because he's gonna be
in old guts race in

10174
02:31:14,070 --> 02:31:14,080
in old guts race in
 

10175
02:31:14,080 --> 02:31:15,990
in old guts race in
in a sport where it gets very tactical

10176
02:31:15,990 --> 02:31:16,000
in a sport where it gets very tactical
 

10177
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:17,830
in a sport where it gets very tactical
at times especially at the like

10178
02:31:17,830 --> 02:31:17,840
at times especially at the like
 

10179
02:31:17,840 --> 02:31:19,349
at times especially at the like
national or i shouldn't say national but

10180
02:31:19,349 --> 02:31:19,359
national or i shouldn't say national but
 

10181
02:31:19,359 --> 02:31:21,750
national or i shouldn't say national but
at the like competition level

10182
02:31:21,750 --> 02:31:21,760
at the like competition level
 

10183
02:31:21,760 --> 02:31:23,510
at the like competition level
the championship level where it's like

10184
02:31:23,510 --> 02:31:23,520
the championship level where it's like
 

10185
02:31:23,520 --> 02:31:25,270
the championship level where it's like
kind of more of a sit and kick

10186
02:31:25,270 --> 02:31:25,280
kind of more of a sit and kick
 

10187
02:31:25,280 --> 02:31:26,550
kind of more of a sit and kick
approach a lot of times where everyone's

10188
02:31:26,550 --> 02:31:26,560
approach a lot of times where everyone's
 

10189
02:31:26,560 --> 02:31:27,670
approach a lot of times where everyone's
kind of waiting for someone to make a

10190
02:31:27,670 --> 02:31:27,680
kind of waiting for someone to make a
 

10191
02:31:27,680 --> 02:31:29,590
kind of waiting for someone to make a
move like priy was going to make a move

10192
02:31:29,590 --> 02:31:29,600
move like priy was going to make a move
 

10193
02:31:29,600 --> 02:31:31,349
move like priy was going to make a move
really early yes so this idea of leading

10194
02:31:31,349 --> 02:31:31,359
really early yes so this idea of leading
 

10195
02:31:31,359 --> 02:31:33,190
really early yes so this idea of leading
from the front which i guess is

10196
02:31:33,190 --> 02:31:33,200
from the front which i guess is
 

10197
02:31:33,200 --> 02:31:34,230
from the front which i guess is
tactically

10198
02:31:34,230 --> 02:31:34,240
tactically
 

10199
02:31:34,240 --> 02:31:37,270
tactically
really a bad idea well from a

10200
02:31:37,270 --> 02:31:37,280
really a bad idea well from a
 

10201
02:31:37,280 --> 02:31:39,830
really a bad idea well from a
from a running a pr standpoint it's a

10202
02:31:39,830 --> 02:31:39,840
from a running a pr standpoint it's a
 

10203
02:31:39,840 --> 02:31:41,110
from a running a pr standpoint it's a
bad idea

10204
02:31:41,110 --> 02:31:41,120
bad idea
 

10205
02:31:41,120 --> 02:31:44,550
bad idea
in most cases but so race i guess is not

10206
02:31:44,550 --> 02:31:44,560
in most cases but so race i guess is not
 

10207
02:31:44,560 --> 02:31:47,030
in most cases but so race i guess is not
just about the pr mm-hmm so race it's

10208
02:31:47,030 --> 02:31:47,040
just about the pr mm-hmm so race it's
 

10209
02:31:47,040 --> 02:31:47,750
just about the pr mm-hmm so race it's
about winning

10210
02:31:47,750 --> 02:31:47,760
about winning
 

10211
02:31:47,760 --> 02:31:49,110
about winning
in a lot of cases and that's what he

10212
02:31:49,110 --> 02:31:49,120
in a lot of cases and that's what he
 

10213
02:31:49,120 --> 02:31:50,230
in a lot of cases and that's what he
thought was going to put him in the best

10214
02:31:50,230 --> 02:31:50,240
thought was going to put him in the best
 

10215
02:31:50,240 --> 02:31:51,270
thought was going to put him in the best
advantage to win i think

10216
02:31:51,270 --> 02:31:51,280
advantage to win i think
 

10217
02:31:51,280 --> 02:31:52,710
advantage to win i think
it's just the run from the front i mean

10218
02:31:52,710 --> 02:31:52,720
it's just the run from the front i mean
 

10219
02:31:52,720 --> 02:31:53,990
it's just the run from the front i mean
what what do you cause you mentioned

10220
02:31:53,990 --> 02:31:54,000
what what do you cause you mentioned
 

10221
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:54,389
what what do you cause you mentioned
this

10222
02:31:54,389 --> 02:31:54,399
this
 

10223
02:31:54,399 --> 02:31:56,790
this
uh the 100 mile you ran you were in

10224
02:31:56,790 --> 02:31:56,800
uh the 100 mile you ran you were in
 

10225
02:31:56,800 --> 02:31:57,910
uh the 100 mile you ran you were in
second place in the

10226
02:31:57,910 --> 02:31:57,920
second place in the
 

10227
02:31:57,920 --> 02:32:01,270
second place in the
in 90s you were able to get to the

10228
02:32:01,270 --> 02:32:01,280
in 90s you were able to get to the
 

10229
02:32:01,280 --> 02:32:04,070
in 90s you were able to get to the
first place how hard is it to run when

10230
02:32:04,070 --> 02:32:04,080
first place how hard is it to run when
 

10231
02:32:04,080 --> 02:32:06,150
first place how hard is it to run when
you're in first place

10232
02:32:06,150 --> 02:32:06,160
you're in first place
 

10233
02:32:06,160 --> 02:32:07,670
you're in first place
you know i think this is really

10234
02:32:07,670 --> 02:32:07,680
you know i think this is really
 

10235
02:32:07,680 --> 02:32:09,429
you know i think this is really
different some people thrive under it

10236
02:32:09,429 --> 02:32:09,439
different some people thrive under it
 

10237
02:32:09,439 --> 02:32:10,630
different some people thrive under it
where it's like for them

10238
02:32:10,630 --> 02:32:10,640
where it's like for them
 

10239
02:32:10,640 --> 02:32:11,910
where it's like for them
i mean like i talked about jim walsh

10240
02:32:11,910 --> 02:32:11,920
i mean like i talked about jim walsh
 

10241
02:32:11,920 --> 02:32:13,429
i mean like i talked about jim walsh
before i think he loves being in the

10242
02:32:13,429 --> 02:32:13,439
before i think he loves being in the
 

10243
02:32:13,439 --> 02:32:13,830
before i think he loves being in the
front

10244
02:32:13,830 --> 02:32:13,840
front
 

10245
02:32:13,840 --> 02:32:15,510
front
if he's in the front he loves it that's

10246
02:32:15,510 --> 02:32:15,520
if he's in the front he loves it that's
 

10247
02:32:15,520 --> 02:32:17,030
if he's in the front he loves it that's
where he's excited that's where he knows

10248
02:32:17,030 --> 02:32:17,040
where he's excited that's where he knows
 

10249
02:32:17,040 --> 02:32:17,830
where he's excited that's where he knows
he's

10250
02:32:17,830 --> 02:32:17,840
he's
 

10251
02:32:17,840 --> 02:32:19,510
he's
he's doing what he's doing where he's

10252
02:32:19,510 --> 02:32:19,520
he's doing what he's doing where he's
 

10253
02:32:19,520 --> 02:32:21,670
he's doing what he's doing where he's
pushing his limits and things like that

10254
02:32:21,670 --> 02:32:21,680
pushing his limits and things like that
 

10255
02:32:21,680 --> 02:32:23,750
pushing his limits and things like that
uh pree was probably the same way and i

10256
02:32:23,750 --> 02:32:23,760
uh pree was probably the same way and i
 

10257
02:32:23,760 --> 02:32:25,349
uh pree was probably the same way and i
think there's other folks who are

10258
02:32:25,349 --> 02:32:25,359
think there's other folks who are
 

10259
02:32:25,359 --> 02:32:26,870
think there's other folks who are
much more comfortable kind of saying

10260
02:32:26,870 --> 02:32:26,880
much more comfortable kind of saying
 

10261
02:32:26,880 --> 02:32:28,230
much more comfortable kind of saying
let's let things settle down here a

10262
02:32:28,230 --> 02:32:28,240
let's let things settle down here a
 

10263
02:32:28,240 --> 02:32:29,030
let's let things settle down here a
little bit

10264
02:32:29,030 --> 02:32:29,040
little bit
 

10265
02:32:29,040 --> 02:32:31,030
little bit
and uh then i'll make my move when it's

10266
02:32:31,030 --> 02:32:31,040
and uh then i'll make my move when it's
 

10267
02:32:31,040 --> 02:32:32,230
and uh then i'll make my move when it's
time to make my move

10268
02:32:32,230 --> 02:32:32,240
time to make my move
 

10269
02:32:32,240 --> 02:32:34,790
time to make my move
or they think of it as and this is a

10270
02:32:34,790 --> 02:32:34,800
or they think of it as and this is a
 

10271
02:32:34,800 --> 02:32:36,389
or they think of it as and this is a
very important i think lesson for

10272
02:32:36,389 --> 02:32:36,399
very important i think lesson for
 

10273
02:32:36,399 --> 02:32:37,830
very important i think lesson for
for the average ultra runner is just

10274
02:32:37,830 --> 02:32:37,840
for the average ultra runner is just
 

10275
02:32:37,840 --> 02:32:40,870
for the average ultra runner is just
like knowing what you're capable of

10276
02:32:40,870 --> 02:32:40,880
like knowing what you're capable of
 

10277
02:32:40,880 --> 02:32:42,309
like knowing what you're capable of
is going to be an important piece to the

10278
02:32:42,309 --> 02:32:42,319
is going to be an important piece to the
 

10279
02:32:42,319 --> 02:32:44,630
is going to be an important piece to the
puzzle because you can like

10280
02:32:44,630 --> 02:32:44,640
puzzle because you can like
 

10281
02:32:44,640 --> 02:32:47,990
puzzle because you can like
you you you can try to say i want to run

10282
02:32:47,990 --> 02:32:48,000
you you you can try to say i want to run
 

10283
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,070
you you you can try to say i want to run
faster than i'm capable of

10284
02:32:50,070 --> 02:32:50,080
faster than i'm capable of
 

10285
02:32:50,080 --> 02:32:52,150
faster than i'm capable of
in an early part of a 100 miler but then

10286
02:32:52,150 --> 02:32:52,160
in an early part of a 100 miler but then
 

10287
02:32:52,160 --> 02:32:53,830
in an early part of a 100 miler but then
you're going to pay for it at the end

10288
02:32:53,830 --> 02:32:53,840
you're going to pay for it at the end
 

10289
02:32:53,840 --> 02:32:55,670
you're going to pay for it at the end
so really unless you're trying to go for

10290
02:32:55,670 --> 02:32:55,680
so really unless you're trying to go for
 

10291
02:32:55,680 --> 02:32:57,030
so really unless you're trying to go for
the win and that's a tactic that you

10292
02:32:57,030 --> 02:32:57,040
the win and that's a tactic that you
 

10293
02:32:57,040 --> 02:32:58,790
the win and that's a tactic that you
think is going to produce a win versus

10294
02:32:58,790 --> 02:32:58,800
think is going to produce a win versus
 

10295
02:32:58,800 --> 02:33:00,469
think is going to produce a win versus
trying to run your fastest time you got

10296
02:33:00,469 --> 02:33:00,479
trying to run your fastest time you got
 

10297
02:33:00,479 --> 02:33:01,590
trying to run your fastest time you got
to run within yourself

10298
02:33:01,590 --> 02:33:01,600
to run within yourself
 

10299
02:33:01,600 --> 02:33:03,830
to run within yourself
within your parameters obviously there's

10300
02:33:03,830 --> 02:33:03,840
within your parameters obviously there's
 

10301
02:33:03,840 --> 02:33:04,710
within your parameters obviously there's
a big question about

10302
02:33:04,710 --> 02:33:04,720
a big question about
 

10303
02:33:04,720 --> 02:33:05,910
a big question about
where those parameters are in a lot of

10304
02:33:05,910 --> 02:33:05,920
where those parameters are in a lot of
 

10305
02:33:05,920 --> 02:33:07,830
where those parameters are in a lot of
cases which makes ultramarathon even

10306
02:33:07,830 --> 02:33:07,840
cases which makes ultramarathon even
 

10307
02:33:07,840 --> 02:33:09,190
cases which makes ultramarathon even
more interesting because it's like

10308
02:33:09,190 --> 02:33:09,200
more interesting because it's like
 

10309
02:33:09,200 --> 02:33:10,630
more interesting because it's like
there's so much unknown about it it's

10310
02:33:10,630 --> 02:33:10,640
there's so much unknown about it it's
 

10311
02:33:10,640 --> 02:33:12,389
there's so much unknown about it it's
like well maybe you can go faster and we

10312
02:33:12,389 --> 02:33:12,399
like well maybe you can go faster and we
 

10313
02:33:12,399 --> 02:33:13,429
like well maybe you can go faster and we
just don't know yet

10314
02:33:13,429 --> 02:33:13,439
just don't know yet
 

10315
02:33:13,439 --> 02:33:15,110
just don't know yet
so there's in the face of that

10316
02:33:15,110 --> 02:33:15,120
so there's in the face of that
 

10317
02:33:15,120 --> 02:33:16,790
so there's in the face of that
uncertainty there's something admirable

10318
02:33:16,790 --> 02:33:16,800
uncertainty there's something admirable
 

10319
02:33:16,800 --> 02:33:19,030
uncertainty there's something admirable
like it was with prefontaine

10320
02:33:19,030 --> 02:33:19,040
like it was with prefontaine
 

10321
02:33:19,040 --> 02:33:21,349
like it was with prefontaine
where you take the risk and run faster

10322
02:33:21,349 --> 02:33:21,359
where you take the risk and run faster
 

10323
02:33:21,359 --> 02:33:22,550
where you take the risk and run faster
than

10324
02:33:22,550 --> 02:33:22,560
than
 

10325
02:33:22,560 --> 02:33:24,870
than
you know you you think you might be able

10326
02:33:24,870 --> 02:33:24,880
you know you you think you might be able
 

10327
02:33:24,880 --> 02:33:26,389
you know you you think you might be able
to run

10328
02:33:26,389 --> 02:33:26,399
to run
 

10329
02:33:26,399 --> 02:33:29,590
to run
in terms of pace that you can hold so

10330
02:33:29,590 --> 02:33:29,600
in terms of pace that you can hold so
 

10331
02:33:29,600 --> 02:33:31,349
in terms of pace that you can hold so
push the pace that's possible yeah

10332
02:33:31,349 --> 02:33:31,359
push the pace that's possible yeah
 

10333
02:33:31,359 --> 02:33:32,389
push the pace that's possible yeah
explore the unknown

10334
02:33:32,389 --> 02:33:32,399
explore the unknown
 

10335
02:33:32,399 --> 02:33:33,910
explore the unknown
experience i think it's like a pioneer

10336
02:33:33,910 --> 02:33:33,920
experience i think it's like a pioneer
 

10337
02:33:33,920 --> 02:33:35,590
experience i think it's like a pioneer
spirit right yeah you know the

10338
02:33:35,590 --> 02:33:35,600
spirit right yeah you know the
 

10339
02:33:35,600 --> 02:33:38,150
spirit right yeah you know the
next frontier kind of a thing but i mean

10340
02:33:38,150 --> 02:33:38,160
next frontier kind of a thing but i mean
 

10341
02:33:38,160 --> 02:33:40,150
next frontier kind of a thing but i mean
prefontaine also there's other angles

10342
02:33:40,150 --> 02:33:40,160
prefontaine also there's other angles
 

10343
02:33:40,160 --> 02:33:41,510
prefontaine also there's other angles
with him too where he was like in the

10344
02:33:41,510 --> 02:33:41,520
with him too where he was like in the
 

10345
02:33:41,520 --> 02:33:42,790
with him too where he was like in the
amateur era where

10346
02:33:42,790 --> 02:33:42,800
amateur era where

then to add even more flavor to the
whole thing i mean

10394
02:34:23,990 --> 02:34:24,000
whole thing i mean
 

10395
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:25,990
whole thing i mean
he died of very premature death he got

10396
02:34:25,990 --> 02:34:26,000
he died of very premature death he got
 

10397
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:27,590
he died of very premature death he got
in a car accident and

10398
02:34:27,590 --> 02:34:27,600
in a car accident and
 

10399
02:34:27,600 --> 02:34:30,230
in a car accident and
died before he would have likely

10400
02:34:30,230 --> 02:34:30,240
died before he would have likely
 

10401
02:34:30,240 --> 02:34:31,750
died before he would have likely
probably meddled at the olympics

10402

his first go of it and it was kind of
 

10413
02:34:41,280 --> 02:34:42,469
his first go of it and it was kind of
one of those things where it's like

10414
02:34:42,469 --> 02:34:42,479

02:35:25,920 --> 02:35:27,030
entertaining to watch yeah there's no
adversity to overcome

10466
02:35:27,030 --> 02:35:27,040
adversity to overcome
 

10467
02:35:27,040 --> 02:35:30,150
adversity to overcome
you mentioned shoe technology how much

10468
02:35:30,150 --> 02:35:30,160
you mentioned shoe technology how much
 

10469
02:35:30,160 --> 02:35:32,309
you mentioned shoe technology how much
has shoe technology advanced through the

10470
02:35:32,309 --> 02:35:32,319
has shoe technology advanced through the
 

10471
02:35:32,319 --> 02:35:33,670
has shoe technology advanced through the
past few decades

10472
02:35:33,670 --> 02:35:33,680
past few decades
 

10473
02:35:33,680 --> 02:35:35,429
past few decades
how much has it changed running

10474
02:35:35,429 --> 02:35:35,439
how much has it changed running
 

10475
02:35:35,439 --> 02:35:36,790
how much has it changed running
generally but also

10476
02:35:36,790 --> 02:35:36,800
generally but also
 

10477
02:35:36,800 --> 02:35:39,429
generally but also
running like ultra marathon running i

10478
02:35:39,429 --> 02:35:39,439
running like ultra marathon running i
 

10479
02:35:39,439 --> 02:35:40,070
running like ultra marathon running i
would say in

10480
02:35:40,070 --> 02:35:40,080
would say in
 

10481
02:35:40,080 --> 02:35:43,110
would say in
ultra running it's had much of a less

10482
02:35:43,110 --> 02:35:43,120
ultra running it's had much of a less
 

10483
02:35:43,120 --> 02:35:45,590
ultra running it's had much of a less
of an impact because ultra running is

10484
02:35:45,590 --> 02:35:45,600
of an impact because ultra running is
 

10485
02:35:45,600 --> 02:35:46,630
of an impact because ultra running is
still

10486
02:35:46,630 --> 02:35:46,640
still
 

10487
02:35:46,640 --> 02:35:49,670
still
heavily skewed towards the trails so the

10488
02:35:49,670 --> 02:35:49,680
heavily skewed towards the trails so the
 

10489
02:35:49,680 --> 02:35:50,630
heavily skewed towards the trails so the
technology

10490
02:35:50,630 --> 02:35:50,640
technology
 

10491
02:35:50,640 --> 02:35:51,910
technology
at least from what we know isn't

10492
02:35:51,910 --> 02:35:51,920
at least from what we know isn't
 

10493
02:35:51,920 --> 02:35:53,270
at least from what we know isn't
necessarily translating over to these

10494
02:35:53,270 --> 02:35:53,280
necessarily translating over to these
 

10495
02:35:53,280 --> 02:35:55,270
necessarily translating over to these
like massive varied terrains certainly

10496
02:35:55,270 --> 02:35:55,280
like massive varied terrains certainly
 

10497
02:35:55,280 --> 02:35:56,630
like massive varied terrains certainly
not the technical terrain and things

10498
02:35:56,630 --> 02:35:56,640
not the technical terrain and things
 

10499
02:35:56,640 --> 02:35:57,270
not the technical terrain and things
like that

10500
02:35:57,270 --> 02:35:57,280
like that
 

10501
02:35:57,280 --> 02:35:59,270
like that
now on road races flat stuff like the

10502
02:35:59,270 --> 02:35:59,280
now on road races flat stuff like the
 

10503
02:35:59,280 --> 02:36:01,270
now on road races flat stuff like the
track stuff the roads the

10504
02:36:01,270 --> 02:36:01,280
track stuff the roads the
 

10505
02:36:01,280 --> 02:36:03,830
track stuff the roads the
run i guess you a runnable trail um

10506
02:36:03,830 --> 02:36:03,840
run i guess you a runnable trail um
 

10507
02:36:03,840 --> 02:36:04,950
run i guess you a runnable trail um
where it's just like basically crushed

10508
02:36:04,950 --> 02:36:04,960
where it's just like basically crushed
 

10509
02:36:04,960 --> 02:36:06,469
where it's just like basically crushed
limestone more or less

10510
02:36:06,469 --> 02:36:06,479
limestone more or less
 

10511
02:36:06,479 --> 02:36:08,309
limestone more or less
uh you definitely get an advantage from

10512
02:36:08,309 --> 02:36:08,319
uh you definitely get an advantage from
 

10513
02:36:08,319 --> 02:36:10,389
uh you definitely get an advantage from
it it's uh and essentially what

10514
02:36:10,389 --> 02:36:10,399
it it's uh and essentially what
 

10515
02:36:10,399 --> 02:36:13,429
it it's uh and essentially what
what happened um is in

10516
02:36:13,429 --> 02:36:13,439
what happened um is in
 

10517
02:36:13,439 --> 02:36:14,950
what happened um is in
it this probably dated back actually

10518
02:36:14,950 --> 02:36:14,960
it this probably dated back actually
 

10519
02:36:14,960 --> 02:36:16,870
it this probably dated back actually
before 2015

10520
02:36:16,870 --> 02:36:16,880
before 2015
 

10521
02:36:16,880 --> 02:36:19,590
before 2015
uh you know nike decided well their

10522
02:36:19,590 --> 02:36:19,600
uh you know nike decided well their
 

10523
02:36:19,600 --> 02:36:20,469
uh you know nike decided well their
their their

10524
02:36:20,469 --> 02:36:20,479
their their
 

10525
02:36:20,479 --> 02:36:23,510
their their
their development team uh was ahead of

10526
02:36:23,510 --> 02:36:23,520
their development team uh was ahead of
 

10527
02:36:23,520 --> 02:36:23,990
their development team uh was ahead of
the curve

10528
02:36:23,990 --> 02:36:24,000
the curve
 

10529
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:25,830
the curve
they've developed this new foam they

10530
02:36:25,830 --> 02:36:25,840
they've developed this new foam they
 

10531
02:36:25,840 --> 02:36:27,270
they've developed this new foam they
call it like a peabod foam

10532
02:36:27,270 --> 02:36:27,280
call it like a peabod foam
 

10533
02:36:27,280 --> 02:36:30,070
call it like a peabod foam
uh and they they realized that like when

10534
02:36:30,070 --> 02:36:30,080
uh and they they realized that like when
 

10535
02:36:30,080 --> 02:36:31,510
uh and they they realized that like when
you step down into a shoe

10536
02:36:31,510 --> 02:36:31,520
you step down into a shoe
 

10537
02:36:31,520 --> 02:36:34,309
you step down into a shoe
the reason like uh racers a lot of times

10538
02:36:34,309 --> 02:36:34,319
the reason like uh racers a lot of times
 

10539
02:36:34,319 --> 02:36:35,349
the reason like uh racers a lot of times
would wear these flats

10540
02:36:35,349 --> 02:36:35,359
would wear these flats
 

10541
02:36:35,359 --> 02:36:36,950
would wear these flats
because they're trying to take out any

10542
02:36:36,950 --> 02:36:36,960
because they're trying to take out any
 

10543
02:36:36,960 --> 02:36:39,110
because they're trying to take out any
of that lost energy into the foam in the

10544
02:36:39,110 --> 02:36:39,120
of that lost energy into the foam in the
 

10545
02:36:39,120 --> 02:36:39,990
of that lost energy into the foam in the
shoe

10546
02:36:39,990 --> 02:36:40,000
shoe
 

10547
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,389
shoe
well this foam that nike came out with

10548
02:36:42,389 --> 02:36:42,399
well this foam that nike came out with
 

10549
02:36:42,399 --> 02:36:45,030
well this foam that nike came out with
is so good that it actually returns

10550
02:36:45,030 --> 02:36:45,040
is so good that it actually returns
 

10551
02:36:45,040 --> 02:36:46,710
is so good that it actually returns
way more energy than the average foam

10552
02:36:46,710 --> 02:36:46,720
way more energy than the average foam
 

10553
02:36:46,720 --> 02:36:48,389
way more energy than the average foam
did to the point where

10554
02:36:48,389 --> 02:36:48,399
did to the point where
 

10555
02:36:48,399 --> 02:36:49,750
did to the point where
like when they test these things on like

10556
02:36:49,750 --> 02:36:49,760
like when they test these things on like
 

10557
02:36:49,760 --> 02:36:51,110
like when they test these things on like
force plate treadmills and things like

10558
02:36:51,110 --> 02:36:51,120
force plate treadmills and things like
 

10559
02:36:51,120 --> 02:36:51,910
force plate treadmills and things like
that it's like a

10560
02:36:51,910 --> 02:36:51,920
that it's like a
 

10561
02:36:51,920 --> 02:36:53,910
that it's like a
depending on the person's gait and

10562
02:36:53,910 --> 02:36:53,920
depending on the person's gait and
 

10563
02:36:53,920 --> 02:36:55,110
depending on the person's gait and
sometimes it's like a two to eight

10564
02:36:55,110 --> 02:36:55,120
sometimes it's like a two to eight
 

10565
02:36:55,120 --> 02:36:55,670
sometimes it's like a two to eight
percent

10566
02:36:55,670 --> 02:36:55,680
percent
 

10567
02:36:55,680 --> 02:36:57,510
percent
improvement in performance i mean we've

10568
02:36:57,510 --> 02:36:57,520
improvement in performance i mean we've
 

10569
02:36:57,520 --> 02:36:59,190
improvement in performance i mean we've
seen records just

10570
02:36:59,190 --> 02:36:59,200
seen records just
 

10571
02:36:59,200 --> 02:37:00,870
seen records just
across the board get broken since this

10572
02:37:00,870 --> 02:37:00,880
across the board get broken since this
 

10573
02:37:00,880 --> 02:37:02,630
across the board get broken since this
came out all distances

10574
02:37:02,630 --> 02:37:02,640
came out all distances
 

10575
02:37:02,640 --> 02:37:05,510
came out all distances
basically yeah yeah i think from at

10576
02:37:05,510 --> 02:37:05,520
basically yeah yeah i think from at
 

10577
02:37:05,520 --> 02:37:06,710
basically yeah yeah i think from at
least from the

10578
02:37:06,710 --> 02:37:06,720
least from the
 

10579
02:37:06,720 --> 02:37:08,870
least from the
5k up through the marathon and i mean

10580
02:37:08,870 --> 02:37:08,880
5k up through the marathon and i mean
 

10581
02:37:08,880 --> 02:37:09,910
5k up through the marathon and i mean
we've seen some

10582
02:37:09,910 --> 02:37:09,920
we've seen some
 

10583
02:37:09,920 --> 02:37:11,990
we've seen some
insane improvements in the marathon i

10584
02:37:11,990 --> 02:37:12,000
insane improvements in the marathon i
 

10585
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,230
insane improvements in the marathon i
think like uh the women's marathon went

10586
02:37:14,230 --> 02:37:14,240
think like uh the women's marathon went
 

10587
02:37:14,240 --> 02:37:14,950
think like uh the women's marathon went
from

10588
02:37:14,950 --> 02:37:14,960
from
 

10589
02:37:14,960 --> 02:37:16,309
from
what was considered relatively

10590
02:37:16,309 --> 02:37:16,319
what was considered relatively
 

10591
02:37:16,319 --> 02:37:20,230
what was considered relatively
untouchable like 216 to a 214

10592
02:37:20,230 --> 02:37:20,240
untouchable like 216 to a 214
 

10593
02:37:20,240 --> 02:37:23,429
untouchable like 216 to a 214
and i mean like it was like 218 was like

10594
02:37:23,429 --> 02:37:23,439
and i mean like it was like 218 was like
 

10595
02:37:23,439 --> 02:37:25,590
and i mean like it was like 218 was like
just world class like if you could run a

10596
02:37:25,590 --> 02:37:25,600
just world class like if you could run a
 

10597
02:37:25,600 --> 02:37:27,510
just world class like if you could run a
218 marathon as a woman that was like

10598
02:37:27,510 --> 02:37:27,520
218 marathon as a woman that was like
 

10599
02:37:27,520 --> 02:37:29,030
218 marathon as a woman that was like
i mean it still is to a degree but then

10600
02:37:29,030 --> 02:37:29,040
i mean it still is to a degree but then
 

10601
02:37:29,040 --> 02:37:31,670
i mean it still is to a degree but then
you know now you have someone run a 214

10602
02:37:31,670 --> 02:37:31,680
you know now you have someone run a 214
 

10603
02:37:31,680 --> 02:37:33,429
you know now you have someone run a 214
like that's and you attribute a lot of

10604
02:37:33,429 --> 02:37:33,439
like that's and you attribute a lot of
 

10605
02:37:33,439 --> 02:37:34,870
like that's and you attribute a lot of
that to the the shoe

10606
02:37:34,870 --> 02:37:34,880
that to the the shoe
 

10607
02:37:34,880 --> 02:37:37,270
that to the the shoe
yeah yeah i think there's probably other

10608
02:37:37,270 --> 02:37:37,280
yeah yeah i think there's probably other
 

10609
02:37:37,280 --> 02:37:38,469
yeah yeah i think there's probably other
things that come in mind too like now

10610
02:37:38,469 --> 02:37:38,479
things that come in mind too like now
 

10611
02:37:38,479 --> 02:37:40,070
things that come in mind too like now
that people know there's a performance

10612
02:37:40,070 --> 02:37:40,080
that people know there's a performance
 

10613
02:37:40,080 --> 02:37:42,070
that people know there's a performance
advantage from a mechanical standpoint

10614
02:37:42,070 --> 02:37:42,080
advantage from a mechanical standpoint
 

10615
02:37:42,080 --> 02:37:43,510
advantage from a mechanical standpoint
it's also a confidence thing where it's

10616
02:37:43,510 --> 02:37:43,520
it's also a confidence thing where it's
 

10617
02:37:43,520 --> 02:37:45,349
it's also a confidence thing where it's
like oh no i can probably

10618
02:37:45,349 --> 02:37:45,359
like oh no i can probably
 

10619
02:37:45,359 --> 02:37:46,950
like oh no i can probably
try going five seconds per mile faster

10620
02:37:46,950 --> 02:37:46,960
try going five seconds per mile faster
 

10621
02:37:46,960 --> 02:37:48,309
try going five seconds per mile faster
and maybe they could have anyway and

10622
02:37:48,309 --> 02:37:48,319
and maybe they could have anyway and
 

10623
02:37:48,319 --> 02:37:49,830
and maybe they could have anyway and
they just now they think they can so

10624
02:37:49,830 --> 02:37:49,840
they just now they think they can so
 

10625
02:37:49,840 --> 02:37:51,110
they just now they think they can so
they are so there's probably a little

10626
02:37:51,110 --> 02:37:51,120
they are so there's probably a little
 

10627
02:37:51,120 --> 02:37:53,429
they are so there's probably a little
bit of that that's just adding to it

10628
02:37:53,429 --> 02:37:53,439
bit of that that's just adding to it
 

10629
02:37:53,439 --> 02:37:54,710
bit of that that's just adding to it
do you think there's a lot of extra

10630
02:37:54,710 --> 02:37:54,720
do you think there's a lot of extra
 

10631
02:37:54,720 --> 02:37:56,469
do you think there's a lot of extra
innovation that's still possible like

10632
02:37:56,469 --> 02:37:56,479
innovation that's still possible like
 

10633
02:37:56,479 --> 02:37:56,950
innovation that's still possible like
what

10634
02:37:56,950 --> 02:37:56,960
what
 

10635
02:37:56,960 --> 02:37:59,990
what
if you could do this kind of big leap

10636
02:37:59,990 --> 02:38:00,000
if you could do this kind of big leap
 

10637
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:01,670
if you could do this kind of big leap
with a little innovation of foam is

10638
02:38:01,670 --> 02:38:01,680
with a little innovation of foam is
 

10639
02:38:01,680 --> 02:38:03,190
with a little innovation of foam is
there other stuff that you can do or

10640
02:38:03,190 --> 02:38:03,200
there other stuff that you can do or
 

10641
02:38:03,200 --> 02:38:05,190
there other stuff that you can do or
further innovation materials that make

10642
02:38:05,190 --> 02:38:05,200
further innovation materials that make
 

10643
02:38:05,200 --> 02:38:07,190
further innovation materials that make
up the foam yeah so they can definitely

10644
02:38:07,190 --> 02:38:07,200
up the foam yeah so they can definitely
 

10645
02:38:07,200 --> 02:38:07,830
up the foam yeah so they can definitely
go much

10646
02:38:07,830 --> 02:38:07,840
go much
 

10647
02:38:07,840 --> 02:38:10,070
go much
more advantage they put a cap on it

10648
02:38:10,070 --> 02:38:10,080
more advantage they put a cap on it
 

10649
02:38:10,080 --> 02:38:11,270
more advantage they put a cap on it
essentially so

10650
02:38:11,270 --> 02:38:11,280
essentially so
 

10651
02:38:11,280 --> 02:38:13,429
essentially so
there was a there's also a carbon plate

10652
02:38:13,429 --> 02:38:13,439
there was a there's also a carbon plate
 

10653
02:38:13,439 --> 02:38:14,790
there was a there's also a carbon plate
element to this too where they put like

10654
02:38:14,790 --> 02:38:14,800
element to this too where they put like
 

10655
02:38:14,800 --> 02:38:16,469
element to this too where they put like
this carbon plate in there in between

10656
02:38:16,469 --> 02:38:16,479
this carbon plate in there in between
 

10657
02:38:16,479 --> 02:38:17,510
this carbon plate in there in between
the foam

10658
02:38:17,510 --> 02:38:17,520
the foam
 

10659
02:38:17,520 --> 02:38:20,550
the foam
so like i believe when when kipchaki

10660
02:38:20,550 --> 02:38:20,560
so like i believe when when kipchaki
 

10661
02:38:20,560 --> 02:38:22,790
so like i believe when when kipchaki
broke well when they did that that kind

10662
02:38:22,790 --> 02:38:22,800
broke well when they did that that kind
 

10663
02:38:22,800 --> 02:38:23,590
broke well when they did that that kind
of uh

10664
02:38:23,590 --> 02:38:23,600
of uh
 

10665
02:38:23,600 --> 02:38:26,710
of uh
uh the sub two hour project he actually

10666
02:38:26,710 --> 02:38:26,720
uh the sub two hour project he actually
 

10667
02:38:26,720 --> 02:38:29,270
uh the sub two hour project he actually
had on a shoe if i'm not mistaken that

10668
02:38:29,270 --> 02:38:29,280
had on a shoe if i'm not mistaken that
 

10669
02:38:29,280 --> 02:38:30,870
had on a shoe if i'm not mistaken that
never got to market because they put

10670
02:38:30,870 --> 02:38:30,880
never got to market because they put
 

10671
02:38:30,880 --> 02:38:33,190
never got to market because they put
down some parameters on it after

10672
02:38:33,190 --> 02:38:33,200
down some parameters on it after
 

10673
02:38:33,200 --> 02:38:35,190
down some parameters on it after
uh before it that one came to market

10674
02:38:35,190 --> 02:38:35,200
uh before it that one came to market
 

10675
02:38:35,200 --> 02:38:36,710
uh before it that one came to market
where it was actually like

10676
02:38:36,710 --> 02:38:36,720
where it was actually like
 

10677
02:38:36,720 --> 02:38:38,790
where it was actually like
stacked up to i can't remember how many

10678
02:38:38,790 --> 02:38:38,800
stacked up to i can't remember how many
 

10679
02:38:38,800 --> 02:38:40,309
stacked up to i can't remember how many
millimeters was an insane amount and

10680
02:38:40,309 --> 02:38:40,319
millimeters was an insane amount and
 

10681
02:38:40,319 --> 02:38:41,830
millimeters was an insane amount and
they had like i think maybe even three

10682
02:38:41,830 --> 02:38:41,840
they had like i think maybe even three
 

10683
02:38:41,840 --> 02:38:42,950
they had like i think maybe even three
layer plates in there

10684
02:38:42,950 --> 02:38:42,960
layer plates in there
 

10685
02:38:42,960 --> 02:38:44,469
layer plates in there
and that was a nike shoe he was wearing

10686
02:38:44,469 --> 02:38:44,479
and that was a nike shoe he was wearing
 

10687
02:38:44,479 --> 02:38:46,870
and that was a nike shoe he was wearing
yeah yeah so what makes it kind of

10688
02:38:46,870 --> 02:38:46,880
yeah yeah so what makes it kind of
 

10689
02:38:46,880 --> 02:38:50,070
yeah yeah so what makes it kind of
controversial or difficult is nike came

10690
02:38:50,070 --> 02:38:50,080
controversial or difficult is nike came
 

10691
02:38:50,080 --> 02:38:51,990
controversial or difficult is nike came
out with these prototypes so prototype

10692
02:38:51,990 --> 02:38:52,000
out with these prototypes so prototype
 

10693
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:53,349
out with these prototypes so prototype
for people don't understand shoes like

10694
02:38:53,349 --> 02:38:53,359
for people don't understand shoes like
 

10695
02:38:53,359 --> 02:38:54,790
for people don't understand shoes like
these these companies they'll develop a

10696
02:38:54,790 --> 02:38:54,800
these these companies they'll develop a
 

10697
02:38:54,800 --> 02:38:56,230
these these companies they'll develop a
shoe and it usually takes like

10698
02:38:56,230 --> 02:38:56,240
shoe and it usually takes like
 

10699
02:38:56,240 --> 02:38:57,429
shoe and it usually takes like
somewhere in the neighborhood of like

10700
02:38:57,429 --> 02:38:57,439
somewhere in the neighborhood of like
 

10701
02:38:57,439 --> 02:39:00,630
somewhere in the neighborhood of like
probably 18 months to hit the market

10702
02:39:00,630 --> 02:39:00,640
probably 18 months to hit the market
 

10703
02:39:00,640 --> 02:39:03,349
probably 18 months to hit the market
so if you're like a sponsored athlete or

10704
02:39:03,349 --> 02:39:03,359
so if you're like a sponsored athlete or
 

10705
02:39:03,359 --> 02:39:04,389
so if you're like a sponsored athlete or
work for the company

10706
02:39:04,389 --> 02:39:04,399
work for the company
 

10707
02:39:04,399 --> 02:39:05,830
work for the company
you can get your hands on these shoes

10708
02:39:05,830 --> 02:39:05,840
you can get your hands on these shoes
 

10709
02:39:05,840 --> 02:39:07,750
you can get your hands on these shoes
before they actually come to market

10710
02:39:07,750 --> 02:39:07,760
before they actually come to market
 

10711
02:39:07,760 --> 02:39:09,990
before they actually come to market
so we had an issue i think this wasn't

10712
02:39:09,990 --> 02:39:10,000
so we had an issue i think this wasn't
 

10713
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:11,349
so we had an issue i think this wasn't
necessarily as big of an issue in the

10714
02:39:11,349 --> 02:39:11,359
necessarily as big of an issue in the
 

10715
02:39:11,359 --> 02:39:12,710
necessarily as big of an issue in the
ultra running community but

10716
02:39:12,710 --> 02:39:12,720
ultra running community but
 

10717
02:39:12,720 --> 02:39:14,950
ultra running community but
uh in the track and field olympic

10718
02:39:14,950 --> 02:39:14,960
uh in the track and field olympic
 

10719
02:39:14,960 --> 02:39:17,030
uh in the track and field olympic
distance stuff was a big issue because

10720
02:39:17,030 --> 02:39:17,040
distance stuff was a big issue because
 

10721
02:39:17,040 --> 02:39:19,349
distance stuff was a big issue because
you had nike athletes having these

10722
02:39:19,349 --> 02:39:19,359
you had nike athletes having these
 

10723
02:39:19,359 --> 02:39:21,110
you had nike athletes having these
prototype shoes before anyone could get

10724
02:39:21,110 --> 02:39:21,120
prototype shoes before anyone could get
 

10725
02:39:21,120 --> 02:39:21,510
prototype shoes before anyone could get
them

10726
02:39:21,510 --> 02:39:21,520
them
 

10727
02:39:21,520 --> 02:39:22,870
them
and then you had athletes were sponsored

10728
02:39:22,870 --> 02:39:22,880
and then you had athletes were sponsored
 

10729
02:39:22,880 --> 02:39:24,630
and then you had athletes were sponsored
by these other brands who couldn't wear

10730
02:39:24,630 --> 02:39:24,640
by these other brands who couldn't wear
 

10731
02:39:24,640 --> 02:39:26,309
by these other brands who couldn't wear
them even if

10732
02:39:26,309 --> 02:39:26,319
them even if
 

10733
02:39:26,319 --> 02:39:27,750
them even if
even when they did come to market so

10734
02:39:27,750 --> 02:39:27,760
even when they did come to market so
 

10735
02:39:27,760 --> 02:39:29,750
even when they did come to market so
then we had this like chase to catch up

10736
02:39:29,750 --> 02:39:29,760
then we had this like chase to catch up
 

10737
02:39:29,760 --> 02:39:30,630
then we had this like chase to catch up
where

10738
02:39:30,630 --> 02:39:30,640
where
 

10739
02:39:30,640 --> 02:39:32,309
where
uh other companies are starting to make

10740
02:39:32,309 --> 02:39:32,319
uh other companies are starting to make
 

10741
02:39:32,319 --> 02:39:33,750
uh other companies are starting to make
their own version of it and now we're

10742
02:39:33,750 --> 02:39:33,760
their own version of it and now we're
 

10743
02:39:33,760 --> 02:39:34,870
their own version of it and now we're
getting to a point

10744
02:39:34,870 --> 02:39:34,880
getting to a point
 

10745
02:39:34,880 --> 02:39:37,190
getting to a point
where most companies have a version of

10746
02:39:37,190 --> 02:39:37,200
where most companies have a version of
 

10747
02:39:37,200 --> 02:39:38,389
where most companies have a version of
that shoe

10748
02:39:38,389 --> 02:39:38,399
that shoe
 

10749
02:39:38,399 --> 02:39:41,670
that shoe
um but we had a huge transition phase

10750
02:39:41,670 --> 02:39:41,680
um but we had a huge transition phase
 

10751
02:39:41,680 --> 02:39:44,790
um but we had a huge transition phase
that impacted the olympics big time

10752
02:39:44,790 --> 02:39:44,800
that impacted the olympics big time
 

10753
02:39:44,800 --> 02:39:46,309
that impacted the olympics big time
i mean think of here's a here's an

10754
02:39:46,309 --> 02:39:46,319
i mean think of here's a here's an
 

10755
02:39:46,319 --> 02:39:48,389
i mean think of here's a here's an
example of it uh there's a

10756
02:39:48,389 --> 02:39:48,399
example of it uh there's a
 

10757
02:39:48,399 --> 02:39:51,190
example of it uh there's a
there was a an athlete kara goucher um

10758
02:39:51,190 --> 02:39:51,200
there was a an athlete kara goucher um
 

10759
02:39:51,200 --> 02:39:51,990
there was a an athlete kara goucher um
she

10760
02:39:51,990 --> 02:39:52,000
she
 

10761
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,950
she
was not she was a nike athlete wasn't uh

10762
02:39:54,950 --> 02:39:54,960
was not she was a nike athlete wasn't uh
 

10763
02:39:54,960 --> 02:39:57,030
was not she was a nike athlete wasn't uh
when they came out with this shoe

10764
02:39:57,030 --> 02:39:57,040
when they came out with this shoe
 

10765
02:39:57,040 --> 02:40:00,389
when they came out with this shoe
and she ran the olympic trial marathon

10766
02:40:00,389 --> 02:40:00,399
and she ran the olympic trial marathon
 

10767
02:40:00,399 --> 02:40:02,070
and she ran the olympic trial marathon
and got fourth place the first person

10768
02:40:02,070 --> 02:40:02,080
and got fourth place the first person
 

10769
02:40:02,080 --> 02:40:04,150
and got fourth place the first person
out and two of the people had ever had

10770
02:40:04,150 --> 02:40:04,160
out and two of the people had ever had
 

10771
02:40:04,160 --> 02:40:05,349
out and two of the people had ever had
that shoe on

10772
02:40:05,349 --> 02:40:05,359
that shoe on
 

10773
02:40:05,359 --> 02:40:07,750
that shoe on
and she was maybe a minute or two like

10774
02:40:07,750 --> 02:40:07,760
and she was maybe a minute or two like
 

10775
02:40:07,760 --> 02:40:08,790
and she was maybe a minute or two like
i'd have to look to see exactly but it

10776
02:40:08,790 --> 02:40:08,800
i'd have to look to see exactly but it
 

10777
02:40:08,800 --> 02:40:09,910
i'd have to look to see exactly but it
was within the

10778
02:40:09,910 --> 02:40:09,920
was within the
 

10779
02:40:09,920 --> 02:40:12,230
was within the
the performance advantage range and so

10780
02:40:12,230 --> 02:40:12,240
the performance advantage range and so
 

10781
02:40:12,240 --> 02:40:13,990
the performance advantage range and so
you could argue that she was the first

10782
02:40:13,990 --> 02:40:14,000
you could argue that she was the first
 

10783
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:16,790
you could argue that she was the first
person in modern running to lose an

10784
02:40:16,790 --> 02:40:16,800
person in modern running to lose an
 

10785
02:40:16,800 --> 02:40:18,710
person in modern running to lose an
olympic spot due to a technological

10786
02:40:18,710 --> 02:40:18,720
olympic spot due to a technological
 

10787
02:40:18,720 --> 02:40:19,670
olympic spot due to a technological
disadvantage

10788
02:40:19,670 --> 02:40:19,680
disadvantage
 

10789
02:40:19,680 --> 02:40:22,469
disadvantage
wow and and it's like i mean it's one of

10790
02:40:22,469 --> 02:40:22,479
wow and and it's like i mean it's one of
 

10791
02:40:22,479 --> 02:40:23,269
wow and and it's like i mean it's one of
those

10792
02:40:23,269 --> 02:40:23,279
those
 

10793
02:40:23,279 --> 02:40:24,630
those
yeah i mean it's one of those things

10794
02:40:24,630 --> 02:40:24,640
yeah i mean it's one of those things
 

10795
02:40:24,640 --> 02:40:27,349
yeah i mean it's one of those things
where like um

10796
02:40:27,349 --> 02:40:27,359
where like um
 

10797
02:40:27,359 --> 02:40:29,349
where like um
it's it's a transition right so there's

10798
02:40:29,349 --> 02:40:29,359
it's it's a transition right so there's
 

10799
02:40:29,359 --> 02:40:31,030
it's it's a transition right so there's
gonna be bumpy road and there's gonna be

10800
02:40:31,030 --> 02:40:31,040
gonna be bumpy road and there's gonna be
 

10801
02:40:31,040 --> 02:40:32,070
gonna be bumpy road and there's gonna be
people that get caught in that

10802
02:40:32,070 --> 02:40:32,080
people that get caught in that
 

10803
02:40:32,080 --> 02:40:34,389
people that get caught in that
transition that it's unfortunate for

10804
02:40:34,389 --> 02:40:34,399
transition that it's unfortunate for
 

10805
02:40:34,399 --> 02:40:37,429
transition that it's unfortunate for
but it's also like uh you know once

10806
02:40:37,429 --> 02:40:37,439
but it's also like uh you know once
 

10807
02:40:37,439 --> 02:40:39,670
but it's also like uh you know once
everything does catch up and every shoe

10808
02:40:39,670 --> 02:40:39,680
everything does catch up and every shoe
 

10809
02:40:39,680 --> 02:40:41,429
everything does catch up and every shoe
company has a version of this there's

10810
02:40:41,429 --> 02:40:41,439
company has a version of this there's
 

10811
02:40:41,439 --> 02:40:42,870
company has a version of this there's
still problems i mean these are

10812
02:40:42,870 --> 02:40:42,880
still problems i mean these are
 

10813
02:40:42,880 --> 02:40:44,070
still problems i mean these are
incredibly expensive shoes it's like a

10814
02:40:44,070 --> 02:40:44,080
incredibly expensive shoes it's like a
 

10815
02:40:44,080 --> 02:40:44,870
incredibly expensive shoes it's like a
250

10816
02:40:44,870 --> 02:40:44,880
250
 

10817
02:40:44,880 --> 02:40:46,550
250
shoe so it's like at what point do you

10818
02:40:46,550 --> 02:40:46,560
shoe so it's like at what point do you
 

10819
02:40:46,560 --> 02:40:49,030
shoe so it's like at what point do you
tell like a wealthy family with a high

10820
02:40:49,030 --> 02:40:49,040
tell like a wealthy family with a high
 

10821
02:40:49,040 --> 02:40:49,830
tell like a wealthy family with a high
school

10822
02:40:49,830 --> 02:40:49,840
school
 

10823
02:40:49,840 --> 02:40:52,230
school
kid that you know you can get that 250

10824
02:40:52,230 --> 02:40:52,240
kid that you know you can get that 250
 

10825
02:40:52,240 --> 02:40:53,910
kid that you know you can get that 250
shoot and then you go and this kid's

10826
02:40:53,910 --> 02:40:53,920
shoot and then you go and this kid's
 

10827
02:40:53,920 --> 02:40:55,349
shoot and then you go and this kid's
family can barely afford a pair of shoes

10828
02:40:55,349 --> 02:40:55,359
family can barely afford a pair of shoes
 

10829
02:40:55,359 --> 02:40:56,950
family can barely afford a pair of shoes
for that much less a 250

10830
02:40:56,950 --> 02:40:56,960
for that much less a 250
 

10831
02:40:56,960 --> 02:40:58,389
for that much less a 250
pair of shoes like where do we draw that

10832
02:40:58,389 --> 02:40:58,399
pair of shoes like where do we draw that
 

10833
02:40:58,399 --> 02:41:00,830
pair of shoes like where do we draw that
line and that sort of stuff

10834
02:41:00,830 --> 02:41:00,840
line and that sort of stuff
 

10835
02:41:00,840 --> 02:41:03,750
line and that sort of stuff
um also just here's the other big one

10836
02:41:03,750 --> 02:41:03,760
um also just here's the other big one
 

10837
02:41:03,760 --> 02:41:04,070
um also just here's the other big one
like

10838
02:41:04,070 --> 02:41:04,080
like
 

10839
02:41:04,080 --> 02:41:05,910
like
let's i mean two to eight percent is a

10840
02:41:05,910 --> 02:41:05,920
let's i mean two to eight percent is a
 

10841
02:41:05,920 --> 02:41:07,510
let's i mean two to eight percent is a
massive range what if you're on the two

10842
02:41:07,510 --> 02:41:07,520
massive range what if you're on the two
 

10843
02:41:07,520 --> 02:41:08,870
massive range what if you're on the two
percent versus someone's on the eight

10844
02:41:08,870 --> 02:41:08,880
percent versus someone's on the eight
 

10845
02:41:08,880 --> 02:41:09,590
percent versus someone's on the eight
percent

10846
02:41:09,590 --> 02:41:09,600
percent
 

10847
02:41:09,600 --> 02:41:11,750
percent
you know chances are if you're you know

10848
02:41:11,750 --> 02:41:11,760
you know chances are if you're you know
 

10849
02:41:11,760 --> 02:41:13,349
you know chances are if you're you know
blowing a record out of the water you're

10850
02:41:13,349 --> 02:41:13,359
blowing a record out of the water you're
 

10851
02:41:13,359 --> 02:41:15,429
blowing a record out of the water you're
probably closer to that high-end

10852
02:41:15,429 --> 02:41:15,439
probably closer to that high-end
 

10853
02:41:15,439 --> 02:41:17,269
probably closer to that high-end
percentage versus someone who's maybe

10854
02:41:17,269 --> 02:41:17,279
percentage versus someone who's maybe
 

10855
02:41:17,279 --> 02:41:18,389
percentage versus someone who's maybe
getting incremental gains or probably

10856
02:41:18,389 --> 02:41:18,399
getting incremental gains or probably
 

10857
02:41:18,399 --> 02:41:19,910
getting incremental gains or probably
closer to that lower end

10858
02:41:19,910 --> 02:41:19,920
closer to that lower end
 

10859
02:41:19,920 --> 02:41:21,990
closer to that lower end
so is it fair to have a piece of

10860
02:41:21,990 --> 02:41:22,000
so is it fair to have a piece of
 

10861
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:23,750
so is it fair to have a piece of
equipment that has that big of a range

10862
02:41:23,750 --> 02:41:23,760
equipment that has that big of a range
 

10863
02:41:23,760 --> 02:41:25,110
equipment that has that big of a range
when we're talking about

10864
02:41:25,110 --> 02:41:25,120
when we're talking about
 

10865
02:41:25,120 --> 02:41:26,550
when we're talking about
less than a percent determining these

10866
02:41:26,550 --> 02:41:26,560
less than a percent determining these
 

10867
02:41:26,560 --> 02:41:28,630
less than a percent determining these
races when all is held constant

10868
02:41:28,630 --> 02:41:28,640
races when all is held constant
 

10869
02:41:28,640 --> 02:41:30,309
races when all is held constant
those are fascinating like philosophical

10870
02:41:30,309 --> 02:41:30,319
those are fascinating like philosophical
 

10871
02:41:30,319 --> 02:41:31,830
those are fascinating like philosophical
questions that i think

10872
02:41:31,830 --> 02:41:31,840
questions that i think
 

10873
02:41:31,840 --> 02:41:33,750
questions that i think
it's nice to solve that for the shoe or

10874
02:41:33,750 --> 02:41:33,760
it's nice to solve that for the shoe or
 

10875
02:41:33,760 --> 02:41:35,830
it's nice to solve that for the shoe or
to raise those questions for a shoe

10876
02:41:35,830 --> 02:41:35,840
to raise those questions for a shoe
 

10877
02:41:35,840 --> 02:41:37,750
to raise those questions for a shoe
because the more complicated place where

10878
02:41:37,750 --> 02:41:37,760
because the more complicated place where
 

10879
02:41:37,760 --> 02:41:39,349
because the more complicated place where
they will be raised is probably like

10880
02:41:39,349 --> 02:41:39,359
they will be raised is probably like
 

10881
02:41:39,359 --> 02:41:40,150
they will be raised is probably like
genetics

10882
02:41:40,150 --> 02:41:40,160
genetics
 

10883
02:41:40,160 --> 02:41:41,750
genetics
genetic engineering all those kinds of

10884
02:41:41,750 --> 02:41:41,760
genetic engineering all those kinds of
 

10885
02:41:41,760 --> 02:41:43,830
genetic engineering all those kinds of
things yeah you'll get a lot more

10886
02:41:43,830 --> 02:41:43,840
things yeah you'll get a lot more
 

10887
02:41:43,840 --> 02:41:45,269
things yeah you'll get a lot more
complicated

10888
02:41:45,269 --> 02:41:45,279
complicated
 

10889
02:41:45,279 --> 02:41:46,469
complicated
so it's nice when you have like a

10890
02:41:46,469 --> 02:41:46,479
so it's nice when you have like a
 

10891
02:41:46,479 --> 02:41:47,990
so it's nice when you have like a
particular piece of technology that's

10892
02:41:47,990 --> 02:41:48,000
particular piece of technology that's
 

10893
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:49,750
particular piece of technology that's
just like right there it's a shoe

10894
02:41:49,750 --> 02:41:49,760
just like right there it's a shoe
 

10895
02:41:49,760 --> 02:41:51,750
just like right there it's a shoe
we can understand and we can study it

10896
02:41:51,750 --> 02:41:51,760
we can understand and we can study it
 

10897
02:41:51,760 --> 02:41:54,469
we can understand and we can study it
right we may be coming on the precipice

10898
02:41:54,469 --> 02:41:54,479
right we may be coming on the precipice
 

10899
02:41:54,479 --> 02:41:55,110
right we may be coming on the precipice
of like

10900
02:41:55,110 --> 02:41:55,120
of like
 

10901
02:41:55,120 --> 02:41:57,510
of like
human powered sport performance is no

10902
02:41:57,510 --> 02:41:57,520
human powered sport performance is no
 

10903
02:41:57,520 --> 02:41:59,269
human powered sport performance is no
longer being something that we like look

10904
02:41:59,269 --> 02:41:59,279
longer being something that we like look
 

10905
02:41:59,279 --> 02:41:59,510
longer being something that we like look
at

10906
02:41:59,510 --> 02:41:59,520
at
 

10907
02:41:59,520 --> 02:42:02,550
at
as this like pinnacle of uh like i don't

10908
02:42:02,550 --> 02:42:02,560
as this like pinnacle of uh like i don't
 

10909
02:42:02,560 --> 02:42:03,110
as this like pinnacle of uh like i don't
maybe

10910
02:42:03,110 --> 02:42:03,120
maybe
 

10911
02:42:03,120 --> 02:42:05,190
maybe
entertainment's the wrong word but like

10912
02:42:05,190 --> 02:42:05,200
entertainment's the wrong word but like
 

10913
02:42:05,200 --> 02:42:07,110
entertainment's the wrong word but like
is that a pursuit

10914
02:42:07,110 --> 02:42:07,120
is that a pursuit
 

10915
02:42:07,120 --> 02:42:08,790
is that a pursuit
you know do we end up just going a

10916
02:42:08,790 --> 02:42:08,800
you know do we end up just going a
 

10917
02:42:08,800 --> 02:42:10,230
you know do we end up just going a
different direction i mean i think it's

10918
02:42:10,230 --> 02:42:10,240
different direction i mean i think it's
 

10919
02:42:10,240 --> 02:42:11,670
different direction i mean i think it's
like it's so hard for us to think about

10920
02:42:11,670 --> 02:42:11,680
like it's so hard for us to think about
 

10921
02:42:11,680 --> 02:42:11,990
like it's so hard for us to think about
that

10922
02:42:11,990 --> 02:42:12,000
that
 

10923
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:13,510
that
right now because it's so part of like

10924
02:42:13,510 --> 02:42:13,520
right now because it's so part of like
 

10925
02:42:13,520 --> 02:42:15,110
right now because it's so part of like
the culture and the lifestyle of the

10926
02:42:15,110 --> 02:42:15,120
the culture and the lifestyle of the
 

10927
02:42:15,120 --> 02:42:16,150
the culture and the lifestyle of the
average

10928
02:42:16,150 --> 02:42:16,160
average
 

10929
02:42:16,160 --> 02:42:18,790
average
person where like sport is a hobby of

10930
02:42:18,790 --> 02:42:18,800
person where like sport is a hobby of
 

10931
02:42:18,800 --> 02:42:20,870
person where like sport is a hobby of
theirs as well as a passion to follow

theirs as well as a passion to follow
 

10933
02:42:20,880 --> 02:42:23,990
theirs as well as a passion to follow
and it's like how complicated does it

10934
02:42:23,990 --> 02:42:24,000
and it's like how complicated does it
 

10935
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:25,510
and it's like how complicated does it
need to get before people lose that

10936
02:42:25,510 --> 02:42:25,520
need to get before people lose that
 

10937
02:42:25,520 --> 02:42:26,230
need to get before people lose that
interest

10938
02:42:26,230 --> 02:42:26,240
interest
 

10939
02:42:26,240 --> 02:42:28,230
interest
and and there could be a future where

10940
02:42:28,230 --> 02:42:28,240
and and there could be a future where
 

10941
02:42:28,240 --> 02:42:30,230
and and there could be a future where
most of the olympics is esports somebody

10942
02:42:30,230 --> 02:42:30,240
most of the olympics is esports somebody
 

10943
02:42:30,240 --> 02:42:31,190
most of the olympics is esports somebody
told me

10944
02:42:31,190 --> 02:42:31,200
told me
 

10945
02:42:31,200 --> 02:42:32,950
told me
that esports is in the olympics i've

10946
02:42:32,950 --> 02:42:32,960
that esports is in the olympics i've
 

10947
02:42:32,960 --> 02:42:34,469
that esports is in the olympics i've
been meaning to look this up oh

10948
02:42:34,469 --> 02:42:34,479
been meaning to look this up oh
 

10949
02:42:34,479 --> 02:42:37,190
been meaning to look this up oh
huh which is you know like what video so

10950
02:42:37,190 --> 02:42:37,200
huh which is you know like what video so
 

10951
02:42:37,200 --> 02:42:38,630
huh which is you know like what video so
video games are in the olympics

10952
02:42:38,630 --> 02:42:38,640
video games are in the olympics
 

10953
02:42:38,640 --> 02:42:40,870
video games are in the olympics
yeah yeah it could be as like a trial

10954
02:42:40,870 --> 02:42:40,880
yeah yeah it could be as like a trial
 

10955
02:42:40,880 --> 02:42:41,750
yeah yeah it could be as like a trial
that they're doing

10956
02:42:41,750 --> 02:42:41,760
that they're doing
 

10957
02:42:41,760 --> 02:42:44,870
that they're doing
mm-hmm um yeah

10958
02:42:44,870 --> 02:42:44,880
mm-hmm um yeah
 

10959
02:42:44,880 --> 02:42:47,510
mm-hmm um yeah
if this is true i'm trying in real time

10960
02:42:47,510 --> 02:42:47,520
if this is true i'm trying in real time
 

10961
02:42:47,520 --> 02:42:48,790
if this is true i'm trying in real time
look it up but if this is if this

10962
02:42:48,790 --> 02:42:48,800
look it up but if this is if this
 

10963
02:42:48,800 --> 02:42:51,910
look it up but if this is if this
esports joining olympics in 2024

10964
02:42:51,910 --> 02:42:51,920
esports joining olympics in 2024
 

10965
02:42:51,920 --> 02:42:55,670
esports joining olympics in 2024
wow so that could be just a

10966
02:42:55,670 --> 02:42:55,680
wow so that could be just a
 

10967
02:42:55,680 --> 02:42:57,349
wow so that could be just a
that could be a fun side thing but it

10968
02:42:57,349 --> 02:42:57,359
that could be a fun side thing but it
 

10969
02:42:57,359 --> 02:42:59,349
that could be a fun side thing but it
could be a first step into

10970
02:42:59,349 --> 02:42:59,359
could be a first step into
 

10971
02:42:59,359 --> 02:43:01,429
could be a first step into
a complete transformation what sports

10972
02:43:01,429 --> 02:43:01,439
a complete transformation what sports
 

10973
02:43:01,439 --> 02:43:03,030
a complete transformation what sports
mean yeah because you can control video

10974
02:43:03,030 --> 02:43:03,040
mean yeah because you can control video
 

10975
02:43:03,040 --> 02:43:05,510
mean yeah because you can control video
games better than you control

10976
02:43:05,510 --> 02:43:05,520
games better than you control
 

10977
02:43:05,520 --> 02:43:08,309
games better than you control
for genetics and humans well in reality

10978
02:43:08,309 --> 02:43:08,319
for genetics and humans well in reality
 

10979
02:43:08,319 --> 02:43:09,910
for genetics and humans well in reality
we've been dealing with this problem in

10980
02:43:09,910 --> 02:43:09,920
we've been dealing with this problem in
 

10981
02:43:09,920 --> 02:43:10,630
we've been dealing with this problem in
other areas

10982
02:43:10,630 --> 02:43:10,640
other areas
 

10983
02:43:10,640 --> 02:43:12,389
other areas
just with the performance enhancing side

10984
02:43:12,389 --> 02:43:12,399
just with the performance enhancing side
 

10985
02:43:12,399 --> 02:43:13,990
just with the performance enhancing side
of things with drugs and all that stuff

10986
02:43:13,990 --> 02:43:14,000
of things with drugs and all that stuff
 

10987
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:15,190
of things with drugs and all that stuff
too and anyway that

10988
02:43:15,190 --> 02:43:15,200
too and anyway that
 

10989
02:43:15,200 --> 02:43:17,110
too and anyway that
that conversations flared back up with

10990
02:43:17,110 --> 02:43:17,120
that conversations flared back up with
 

10991
02:43:17,120 --> 02:43:18,389
that conversations flared back up with
track and field too where

10992
02:43:18,389 --> 02:43:18,399
track and field too where
 

10993
02:43:18,399 --> 02:43:19,510
track and field too where
we are seeing a lot of records get

10994
02:43:19,510 --> 02:43:19,520
we are seeing a lot of records get
 

10995
02:43:19,520 --> 02:43:21,030
we are seeing a lot of records get
broken a lot of it probably is to shoot

10996
02:43:21,030 --> 02:43:21,040
broken a lot of it probably is to shoot
 

10997
02:43:21,040 --> 02:43:22,230
broken a lot of it probably is to shoot
technology but

10998
02:43:22,230 --> 02:43:22,240
technology but
 

10999
02:43:22,240 --> 02:43:24,630
technology but
you know in 2020 with the covid stuff

11000
02:43:24,630 --> 02:43:24,640
you know in 2020 with the covid stuff
 

11001
02:43:24,640 --> 02:43:25,750
you know in 2020 with the covid stuff
you you have all these out of

11002
02:43:25,750 --> 02:43:25,760
you you have all these out of
 

11003
02:43:25,760 --> 02:43:28,070
you you have all these out of
competition testing protocols that a lot

11004
02:43:28,070 --> 02:43:28,080
competition testing protocols that a lot
 

11005
02:43:28,080 --> 02:43:29,750
competition testing protocols that a lot
of these top tier olympic athletes are

11006
02:43:29,750 --> 02:43:29,760
of these top tier olympic athletes are
 

11007
02:43:29,760 --> 02:43:30,630
of these top tier olympic athletes are
getting

11008
02:43:30,630 --> 02:43:30,640
getting
 

11009
02:43:30,640 --> 02:43:33,429
getting
uh to try to eliminate like is it like

11010
02:43:33,429 --> 02:43:33,439
uh to try to eliminate like is it like
 

11011
02:43:33,439 --> 02:43:35,590
uh to try to eliminate like is it like
if you just do inter competition testing

11012
02:43:35,590 --> 02:43:35,600
if you just do inter competition testing
 

11013
02:43:35,600 --> 02:43:37,750
if you just do inter competition testing
like there's potential for people to do

11014
02:43:37,750 --> 02:43:37,760
like there's potential for people to do
 

11015
02:43:37,760 --> 02:43:39,110
like there's potential for people to do
things that are

11016
02:43:39,110 --> 02:43:39,120
things that are
 

11017
02:43:39,120 --> 02:43:40,550
things that are
uh going to give them a performance

11018
02:43:40,550 --> 02:43:40,560
uh going to give them a performance
 

11019
02:43:40,560 --> 02:43:41,910
uh going to give them a performance
advantage but not going to show up on

11020
02:43:41,910 --> 02:43:41,920
advantage but not going to show up on
 

11021
02:43:41,920 --> 02:43:42,630
advantage but not going to show up on
that

11022
02:43:42,630 --> 02:43:42,640
that
 

11023
02:43:42,640 --> 02:43:44,950
that
test on the day of or after the race

11024
02:43:44,950 --> 02:43:44,960
test on the day of or after the race
 

11025
02:43:44,960 --> 02:43:46,469
test on the day of or after the race
where now you have these like

11026
02:43:46,469 --> 02:43:46,479
where now you have these like
 

11027
02:43:46,479 --> 02:43:48,389
where now you have these like
limitations of being able to test so do

11028
02:43:48,389 --> 02:43:48,399
limitations of being able to test so do
 

11029
02:43:48,399 --> 02:43:49,110
limitations of being able to test so do
we have a

11030
02:43:49,110 --> 02:43:49,120
we have a
 

11031
02:43:49,120 --> 02:43:51,670
we have a
like a group of athletes now who decided

11032
02:43:51,670 --> 02:43:51,680
like a group of athletes now who decided
 

11033
02:43:51,680 --> 02:43:53,510
like a group of athletes now who decided
oh i'm not going to get tested in 2020

11034
02:43:53,510 --> 02:43:53,520
oh i'm not going to get tested in 2020
 

11035
02:43:53,520 --> 02:43:54,950
oh i'm not going to get tested in 2020
do the covert restrictions is the time

11036
02:43:54,950 --> 02:43:54,960
do the covert restrictions is the time
 

11037
02:43:54,960 --> 02:43:56,150
do the covert restrictions is the time
to dope up and then

11038
02:43:56,150 --> 02:43:56,160
to dope up and then
 

11039
02:43:56,160 --> 02:43:57,590
to dope up and then
you know hit some stride and some

11040
02:43:57,590 --> 02:43:57,600
you know hit some stride and some
 

11041
02:43:57,600 --> 02:43:59,269
you know hit some stride and some
records and then taper back off when

11042
02:43:59,269 --> 02:43:59,279
records and then taper back off when
 

11043
02:43:59,279 --> 02:44:00,790
records and then taper back off when
they get this thing fired back up again

11044
02:44:00,790 --> 02:44:00,800
they get this thing fired back up again
 

11045
02:44:00,800 --> 02:44:01,429
they get this thing fired back up again
and

11046
02:44:01,429 --> 02:44:01,439
and
 

11047
02:44:01,439 --> 02:44:02,870
and
so there may be some of that as well and

11048
02:44:02,870 --> 02:44:02,880
so there may be some of that as well and
 

11049
02:44:02,880 --> 02:44:04,309
so there may be some of that as well and
i mean that's always been an ongoing

11050
02:44:04,309 --> 02:44:04,319
i mean that's always been an ongoing
 

11051
02:44:04,319 --> 02:44:05,110
i mean that's always been an ongoing
problem and

11052
02:44:05,110 --> 02:44:05,120
problem and
 

11053
02:44:05,120 --> 02:44:06,309
problem and
yeah but the boost you get from

11054
02:44:06,309 --> 02:44:06,319
yeah but the boost you get from
 

11055
02:44:06,319 --> 02:44:07,910
yeah but the boost you get from
performance-enhancing drugs could be

11056
02:44:07,910 --> 02:44:07,920
performance-enhancing drugs could be
 

11057
02:44:07,920 --> 02:44:09,429
performance-enhancing drugs could be
tiny relative to the stuff we have in

11058
02:44:09,429 --> 02:44:09,439
tiny relative to the stuff we have in
 

11059
02:44:09,439 --> 02:44:10,070
tiny relative to the stuff we have in
the future

11060
02:44:10,070 --> 02:44:10,080
the future
 

11061
02:44:10,080 --> 02:44:11,670
the future
right yeah you might be the last

11062
02:44:11,670 --> 02:44:11,680
right yeah you might be the last
 

11063
02:44:11,680 --> 02:44:13,910
right yeah you might be the last
generation of like

11064
02:44:13,910 --> 02:44:13,920
generation of like
 

11065
02:44:13,920 --> 02:44:17,269
generation of like
natural unmodified humans that

11066
02:44:17,269 --> 02:44:17,279
natural unmodified humans that
 

11067
02:44:17,279 --> 02:44:19,190
natural unmodified humans that
we're running and who knows maybe that's

11068
02:44:19,190 --> 02:44:19,200
we're running and who knows maybe that's
 

11069
02:44:19,200 --> 02:44:21,110
we're running and who knows maybe that's
already over who knows who's

11070
02:44:21,110 --> 02:44:21,120
already over who knows who's
 

11071
02:44:21,120 --> 02:44:24,550
already over who knows who's
who's modified that that's that's true

11072
02:44:24,550 --> 02:44:24,560
who's modified that that's that's true
 

11073
02:44:24,560 --> 02:44:25,750
who's modified that that's that's true
you might we might be living through

11074
02:44:25,750 --> 02:44:25,760
you might we might be living through
 

11075
02:44:25,760 --> 02:44:27,910
you might we might be living through
that transition to the new nike shoe

11076
02:44:27,910 --> 02:44:27,920
that transition to the new nike shoe
 

11077
02:44:27,920 --> 02:44:31,190
that transition to the new nike shoe
but broadly defined yeah

11078
02:44:31,190 --> 02:44:31,200
but broadly defined yeah
 

11079
02:44:31,200 --> 02:44:33,429
but broadly defined yeah
so you'll be uh in some sense in in the

11080
02:44:33,429 --> 02:44:33,439
so you'll be uh in some sense in in the
 

11081
02:44:33,439 --> 02:44:34,469
so you'll be uh in some sense in in the
history books as

11082
02:44:34,469 --> 02:44:34,479
history books as
 

11083
02:44:34,479 --> 02:44:37,670
history books as
uh humans used to run without any

11084
02:44:37,670 --> 02:44:37,680
uh humans used to run without any
 

11085
02:44:37,680 --> 02:44:39,590
uh humans used to run without any
modifications they used to destroy their

11086
02:44:39,590 --> 02:44:39,600
modifications they used to destroy their
 

11087
02:44:39,600 --> 02:44:41,510
modifications they used to destroy their
body and let it recover and then do it

11088
02:44:41,510 --> 02:44:41,520
body and let it recover and then do it
 

11089
02:44:41,520 --> 02:44:41,990
body and let it recover and then do it
again

11090
02:44:41,990 --> 02:44:42,000
again
 

11091
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:44,710
again
and they used to be impressed with the

11092
02:44:44,710 --> 02:44:44,720
and they used to be impressed with the
 

11093
02:44:44,720 --> 02:44:46,870
and they used to be impressed with the
with an 11 hour

11094
02:44:46,870 --> 02:44:46,880
with an 11 hour
 

11095
02:44:46,880 --> 02:44:50,070
with an 11 hour
100 mile time when we could do it in

11096
02:44:50,070 --> 02:44:50,080
100 mile time when we could do it in
 

11097
02:44:50,080 --> 02:44:53,510
100 mile time when we could do it in
under an hour now yeah yeah so uh but

11098
02:44:53,510 --> 02:44:53,520
under an hour now yeah yeah so uh but
 

11099
02:44:53,520 --> 02:44:56,710
under an hour now yeah yeah so uh but
nevertheless it is incred the four mile

11100
02:44:56,710 --> 02:44:56,720
nevertheless it is incred the four mile
 

11101
02:44:56,720 --> 02:44:58,309
nevertheless it is incred the four mile
the four minute mile was incredibly

11102
02:44:58,309 --> 02:44:58,319
the four minute mile was incredibly
 

11103
02:44:58,319 --> 02:45:00,150
the four minute mile was incredibly
impressive uh

11104
02:45:00,150 --> 02:45:00,160
impressive uh
 

11105
02:45:00,160 --> 02:45:03,190
impressive uh
the i really love the 11 hour mark for

11106
02:45:03,190 --> 02:45:03,200
the i really love the 11 hour mark for
 

11107
02:45:03,200 --> 02:45:04,469
the i really love the 11 hour mark for
the 100

11108
02:45:04,469 --> 02:45:04,479
the 100
 

11109
02:45:04,479 --> 02:45:08,389
the 100
and the two hour marathon by most people

11110
02:45:08,389 --> 02:45:08,399
and the two hour marathon by most people
 

11111
02:45:08,399 --> 02:45:10,309
and the two hour marathon by most people
um for the longest time was thought to

11112
02:45:10,309 --> 02:45:10,319
um for the longest time was thought to
 

11113
02:45:10,319 --> 02:45:11,510
um for the longest time was thought to
be impossible

11114
02:45:11,510 --> 02:45:11,520
be impossible
 

11115
02:45:11,520 --> 02:45:13,030
be impossible
you know there's still people that think

11116
02:45:13,030 --> 02:45:13,040
you know there's still people that think
 

11117
02:45:13,040 --> 02:45:14,950
you know there's still people that think
it's impossible with under certain

11118
02:45:14,950 --> 02:45:14,960
it's impossible with under certain
 

11119
02:45:14,960 --> 02:45:15,830
it's impossible with under certain
constraints

11120
02:45:15,830 --> 02:45:15,840
constraints
 

11121
02:45:15,840 --> 02:45:19,429
constraints
so um uh elliot kipchoge

11122
02:45:19,429 --> 02:45:19,439
so um uh elliot kipchoge
 

11123
02:45:19,439 --> 02:45:22,710
so um uh elliot kipchoge
of kenya as you mentioned ran a one-hour

11124
02:45:22,710 --> 02:45:22,720
of kenya as you mentioned ran a one-hour
 

11125
02:45:22,720 --> 02:45:23,910
of kenya as you mentioned ran a one-hour
59-minute

11126
02:45:23,910 --> 02:45:23,920
59-minute
 

11127
02:45:23,920 --> 02:45:27,590
59-minute
40-second marathon but he had

11128
02:45:27,590 --> 02:45:27,600
40-second marathon but he had
 

11129
02:45:27,600 --> 02:45:30,389
40-second marathon but he had
like he said the prototype shoes and he

11130
02:45:30,389 --> 02:45:30,399
like he said the prototype shoes and he
 

11131
02:45:30,399 --> 02:45:31,590
like he said the prototype shoes and he
had the

11132
02:45:31,590 --> 02:45:31,600
had the
 

11133
02:45:31,600 --> 02:45:34,070
had the
the pace setters yeah i don't know how

11134
02:45:34,070 --> 02:45:34,080
the pace setters yeah i don't know how
 

11135
02:45:34,080 --> 02:45:35,269
the pace setters yeah i don't know how
essential that is

11136
02:45:35,269 --> 02:45:35,279
essential that is
 

11137
02:45:35,279 --> 02:45:37,269
essential that is
but it seems quite essential do you

11138
02:45:37,269 --> 02:45:37,279
but it seems quite essential do you
 

11139
02:45:37,279 --> 02:45:38,550
but it seems quite essential do you
think it's possible

11140
02:45:38,550 --> 02:45:38,560
think it's possible
 

11141
02:45:38,560 --> 02:45:39,670
think it's possible
first of all what do you think about

11142
02:45:39,670 --> 02:45:39,680
first of all what do you think about
 

11143
02:45:39,680 --> 02:45:41,750
first of all what do you think about
that accomplishment uh

11144
02:45:41,750 --> 02:45:41,760
that accomplishment uh
 

11145
02:45:41,760 --> 02:45:43,670
that accomplishment uh
and he is one of the greatest if not the

11146
02:45:43,670 --> 02:45:43,680
and he is one of the greatest if not the
 

11147
02:45:43,680 --> 02:45:46,309
and he is one of the greatest if not the
greatest marathon runners of all time

11148
02:45:46,309 --> 02:45:46,319
greatest marathon runners of all time
 

11149
02:45:46,319 --> 02:45:47,110
greatest marathon runners of all time
what do you think about that

11150
02:45:47,110 --> 02:45:47,120
what do you think about that
 

11151
02:45:47,120 --> 02:45:48,389
what do you think about that
accomplishment and do you think it's

11152
02:45:48,389 --> 02:45:48,399
accomplishment and do you think it's
 

11153
02:45:48,399 --> 02:45:50,389
accomplishment and do you think it's
possible to run a two-hour marathon

11154
02:45:50,389 --> 02:45:50,399
possible to run a two-hour marathon
 

11155
02:45:50,399 --> 02:45:53,190
possible to run a two-hour marathon
without any assistance yeah i mean i

11156
02:45:53,190 --> 02:45:53,200
without any assistance yeah i mean i
 

11157
02:45:53,200 --> 02:45:54,790
without any assistance yeah i mean i
think yeah there's no question about it

11158
02:45:54,790 --> 02:45:54,800
think yeah there's no question about it
 

11159
02:45:54,800 --> 02:45:56,070
think yeah there's no question about it
regardless of technology

11160
02:45:56,070 --> 02:45:56,080
regardless of technology
 

11161
02:45:56,080 --> 02:45:59,269
regardless of technology
he's world class if not the best

11162
02:45:59,269 --> 02:45:59,279
he's world class if not the best
 

11163
02:45:59,279 --> 02:46:02,950
he's world class if not the best
the i think he

11164
02:46:02,950 --> 02:46:02,960
the i think he
 

11165
02:46:02,960 --> 02:46:05,269
the i think he
i think he could go under two or someone

11166
02:46:05,269 --> 02:46:05,279
i think he could go under two or someone
 

11167
02:46:05,279 --> 02:46:06,070
i think he could go under two or someone
equivalent

11168
02:46:06,070 --> 02:46:06,080
equivalent
 

11169
02:46:06,080 --> 02:46:09,429
equivalent
to him could go under two hours with

11170
02:46:09,429 --> 02:46:09,439
to him could go under two hours with
 

11171
02:46:09,439 --> 02:46:12,550
to him could go under two hours with
with the shoe technology probably what

11172
02:46:12,550 --> 02:46:12,560
with the shoe technology probably what
 

11173
02:46:12,560 --> 02:46:15,269
with the shoe technology probably what
it'll take is it'll take a fast course

11174
02:46:15,269 --> 02:46:15,279
it'll take is it'll take a fast course
 

11175
02:46:15,279 --> 02:46:18,230
it'll take is it'll take a fast course
a course that has like very few tangents

11176
02:46:18,230 --> 02:46:18,240
a course that has like very few tangents
 

11177
02:46:18,240 --> 02:46:18,950
a course that has like very few tangents
because like

11178
02:46:18,950 --> 02:46:18,960
because like
 

11179
02:46:18,960 --> 02:46:20,389
because like
you know turning on a course they

11180
02:46:20,389 --> 02:46:20,399
you know turning on a course they
 

11181
02:46:20,399 --> 02:46:22,790
you know turning on a course they
estimate adds about a percent to the

11182
02:46:22,790 --> 02:46:22,800
estimate adds about a percent to the
 

11183
02:46:22,800 --> 02:46:25,030
estimate adds about a percent to the
to the distance so you know when we're

11184
02:46:25,030 --> 02:46:25,040
to the distance so you know when we're
 

11185
02:46:25,040 --> 02:46:26,230
to the distance so you know when we're
talking about a marathon

11186
02:46:26,230 --> 02:46:26,240
talking about a marathon
 

11187
02:46:26,240 --> 02:46:27,750
talking about a marathon
you're getting up to like a quarter mile

11188
02:46:27,750 --> 02:46:27,760
you're getting up to like a quarter mile
 

11189
02:46:27,760 --> 02:46:29,510
you're getting up to like a quarter mile
extra running you know that alone could

11190
02:46:29,510 --> 02:46:29,520
extra running you know that alone could
 

11191
02:46:29,520 --> 02:46:30,870
extra running you know that alone could
potentially put you down near

11192
02:46:30,870 --> 02:46:30,880
potentially put you down near
 

11193
02:46:30,880 --> 02:46:32,790
potentially put you down near
near too flat based on what you know

11194
02:46:32,790 --> 02:46:32,800
near too flat based on what you know
 

11195
02:46:32,800 --> 02:46:34,389
near too flat based on what you know
we're seeing because

11196
02:46:34,389 --> 02:46:34,399
we're seeing because
 

11197
02:46:34,399 --> 02:46:38,710
we're seeing because
i mean kitchen keys got a was it 201

11198
02:46:38,710 --> 02:46:38,720
i mean kitchen keys got a was it 201
 

11199
02:46:38,720 --> 02:46:40,710
i mean kitchen keys got a was it 201
i believe is his actual world record

11200
02:46:40,710 --> 02:46:40,720
i believe is his actual world record
 

11201
02:46:40,720 --> 02:46:41,990
i believe is his actual world record
where it's actually like you know

11202
02:46:41,990 --> 02:46:42,000
where it's actually like you know
 

11203
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:42,790
where it's actually like you know
certified

11204
02:46:42,790 --> 02:46:42,800
certified
 

11205
02:46:42,800 --> 02:46:43,910
certified
so i mean he's right on the door

11206
02:46:43,910 --> 02:46:43,920
so i mean he's right on the door
 

11207
02:46:43,920 --> 02:46:45,990
so i mean he's right on the door
knocking knocking on the door there

11208
02:46:45,990 --> 02:46:46,000
knocking knocking on the door there
 

11209
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:49,269
knocking knocking on the door there
um yeah the prototype he had since then

11210
02:46:49,269 --> 02:46:49,279
um yeah the prototype he had since then
 

11211
02:46:49,279 --> 02:46:50,710
um yeah the prototype he had since then
they put in a regulation where you can't

11212
02:46:50,710 --> 02:46:50,720
they put in a regulation where you can't
 

11213
02:46:50,720 --> 02:46:52,790
they put in a regulation where you can't
stack a shoe for the roads more than 40

11214
02:46:52,790 --> 02:46:52,800
stack a shoe for the roads more than 40
 

11215
02:46:52,800 --> 02:46:53,510
stack a shoe for the roads more than 40
millimeters

11216
02:46:53,510 --> 02:46:53,520
millimeters
 

11217
02:46:53,520 --> 02:46:54,950
millimeters
so you can only have so much of that

11218
02:46:54,950 --> 02:46:54,960
so you can only have so much of that
 

11219
02:46:54,960 --> 02:46:56,870
so you can only have so much of that
energy returning foam and you can only

11220
02:46:56,870 --> 02:46:56,880
energy returning foam and you can only
 

11221
02:46:56,880 --> 02:46:57,429
energy returning foam and you can only
have i think

11222
02:46:57,429 --> 02:46:57,439
have i think
 

11223
02:46:57,439 --> 02:47:00,469
have i think
one carbon plate in there now uh

11224
02:47:00,469 --> 02:47:00,479
one carbon plate in there now uh
 

11225
02:47:00,479 --> 02:47:02,550
one carbon plate in there now uh
so that puts a little bit of a ceiling

11226
02:47:02,550 --> 02:47:02,560
so that puts a little bit of a ceiling
 

11227
02:47:02,560 --> 02:47:04,550
so that puts a little bit of a ceiling
on that technological thing

11228
02:47:04,550 --> 02:47:04,560
on that technological thing
 

11229
02:47:04,560 --> 02:47:06,710
on that technological thing
uh but but who knows what else will come

11230
02:47:06,710 --> 02:47:06,720
uh but but who knows what else will come
 

11231
02:47:06,720 --> 02:47:08,230
uh but but who knows what else will come
out and that and and

11232
02:47:08,230 --> 02:47:08,240
out and that and and
 

11233
02:47:08,240 --> 02:47:09,990
out and that and and
and to be honest who comes out with it

11234
02:47:09,990 --> 02:47:10,000
and to be honest who comes out with it
 

11235
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:12,309
and to be honest who comes out with it
because the fact that nike came out with

11236
02:47:12,309 --> 02:47:12,319
because the fact that nike came out with
 

11237
02:47:12,319 --> 02:47:14,150
because the fact that nike came out with
this technology is the reason why

11238
02:47:14,150 --> 02:47:14,160
this technology is the reason why
 

11239
02:47:14,160 --> 02:47:16,309
this technology is the reason why
it's being allowed to be be used if that

11240
02:47:16,309 --> 02:47:16,319
it's being allowed to be be used if that
 

11241
02:47:16,319 --> 02:47:17,190
it's being allowed to be be used if that
would have been like

11242
02:47:17,190 --> 02:47:17,200
would have been like
 

11243
02:47:17,200 --> 02:47:18,870
would have been like
you know another running company that

11244
02:47:18,870 --> 02:47:18,880
you know another running company that
 

11245
02:47:18,880 --> 02:47:20,550
you know another running company that
that came out with it i'm sure the

11246
02:47:20,550 --> 02:47:20,560
that came out with it i'm sure the
 

11247
02:47:20,560 --> 02:47:22,230
that came out with it i'm sure the
the the regulations would have been

11403
02:49:41,760 --> 02:49:43,269
yes that's very fast for folks for some
perspective there the current world

11404
02:49:43,269 --> 02:49:43,279
perspective there the current world
 

11405
02:49:43,279 --> 02:49:44,070
perspective there the current world
record

11406
02:49:44,070 --> 02:49:44,080
record
 

11407
02:49:44,080 --> 02:49:48,070
record
is like in the 440s per mile a mile like

11408
02:49:48,070 --> 02:49:48,080
is like in the 440s per mile a mile like
 

11409
02:49:48,080 --> 02:49:49,670
is like in the 440s per mile a mile like
just to add a little flavor to that

11410
02:49:49,670 --> 02:49:49,680
just to add a little flavor to that
 

11411
02:49:49,680 --> 02:49:51,429
just to add a little flavor to that
you're basically sprinting yeah i mean

11412
02:49:51,429 --> 02:49:51,439
you're basically sprinting yeah i mean
 

11413
02:49:51,439 --> 02:49:53,110
you're basically sprinting yeah i mean
go out to a track

11414
02:49:53,110 --> 02:49:53,120
go out to a track
 

11415
02:49:53,120 --> 02:49:56,550
go out to a track
and run one lap as fast as you can

11416
02:49:56,550 --> 02:49:56,560
and run one lap as fast as you can
 

11417
02:49:56,560 --> 02:49:58,630
and run one lap as fast as you can
and then reflect on what time you get

11418
02:49:58,630 --> 02:49:58,640
and then reflect on what time you get
 

11419
02:49:58,640 --> 02:50:00,389
and then reflect on what time you get
and realize like the world record for

11420
02:50:00,389 --> 02:50:00,399
and realize like the world record for
 

11421
02:50:00,399 --> 02:50:01,349
and realize like the world record for
the marathon

11422
02:50:01,349 --> 02:50:01,359
the marathon
 

11423
02:50:01,359 --> 02:50:04,389
the marathon
is that is that lap

11424
02:50:04,389 --> 02:50:04,399
is that is that lap
 

11425
02:50:04,399 --> 02:50:07,670
is that is that lap
at just over 70 seconds per lap so

11426
02:50:07,670 --> 02:50:07,680
at just over 70 seconds per lap so
 

11427
02:50:07,680 --> 02:50:07,990
at just over 70 seconds per lap so
minute

11428
02:50:07,990 --> 02:50:08,000
minute
 

11429
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:10,150
minute
and ten just over that but you're doing

11430
02:50:10,150 --> 02:50:10,160
and ten just over that but you're doing
 

11431
02:50:10,160 --> 02:50:12,070
and ten just over that but you're doing
it 26.2 miles

11432
02:50:12,070 --> 02:50:12,080
it 26.2 miles
 

11433
02:50:12,080 --> 02:50:14,790
it 26.2 miles
yeah so so over a hundred times it's

11434
02:50:14,790 --> 02:50:14,800
yeah so so over a hundred times it's
 

11435
02:50:14,800 --> 02:50:16,710
yeah so so over a hundred times it's
mind boggling but watching elliot

11436
02:50:16,710 --> 02:50:16,720
mind boggling but watching elliot
 

11437
02:50:16,720 --> 02:50:18,710
mind boggling but watching elliot
kipchoge just first of all he was like

11438
02:50:18,710 --> 02:50:18,720
kipchoge just first of all he was like
 

11439
02:50:18,720 --> 02:50:20,070
kipchoge just first of all he was like
smiling at the end of it

11440
02:50:20,070 --> 02:50:20,080
smiling at the end of it
 

11441
02:50:20,080 --> 02:50:22,150
smiling at the end of it
so the there's an extreme efficiency

11442
02:50:22,150 --> 02:50:22,160
so the there's an extreme efficiency
 

11443
02:50:22,160 --> 02:50:23,750
so the there's an extreme efficiency
here too so he's not

11444
02:50:23,750 --> 02:50:23,760
here too so he's not
 

11445
02:50:23,760 --> 02:50:27,349
here too so he's not
he's able to just find the right way to

11446
02:50:27,349 --> 02:50:27,359
he's able to just find the right way to
 

11447
02:50:27,359 --> 02:50:30,389
he's able to just find the right way to
maximize yeah maximize efficiency

11448
02:50:30,389 --> 02:50:30,399
maximize yeah maximize efficiency
 

11449
02:50:30,399 --> 02:50:32,309
maximize yeah maximize efficiency
it makes it look easy i mean that that's

11450
02:50:32,309 --> 02:50:32,319
it makes it look easy i mean that that's
 

11451
02:50:32,319 --> 02:50:34,550
it makes it look easy i mean that that's
true for basically every olympic athlete

11452
02:50:34,550 --> 02:50:34,560
true for basically every olympic athlete
 

11453
02:50:34,560 --> 02:50:35,990
true for basically every olympic athlete
when you watch gymnasts they kind of

make it look easy
 

11457
02:50:37,760 --> 02:50:40,790
make it look easy
yes but there's like tens if not

11458
02:50:40,790 --> 02:50:40,800
yes but there's like tens if not
 

11459
02:50:40,800 --> 02:50:42,309
yes but there's like tens if not
hundreds of thousands of hours

11460
02:50:42,309 --> 02:50:42,319
hundreds of thousands of hours
 

11461
02:50:42,319 --> 02:50:44,389

comfortable enough to even attempt some
of the moves they do in gymnastics is

mind-boggling
 

11469
02:50:48,160 --> 02:50:51,190
mind-boggling
that one is super awesome because uh how

11470
02:50:51,190 --> 02:50:51,200
that one is super awesome because uh how
 

11471

much bigger than any one like hard
 

11521
02:51:37,840 --> 02:51:38,790
much bigger than any one like hard
decision or

11522
02:51:38,790 --> 02:51:38,800
decision or
 

11523
02:51:38,800 --> 02:51:42,070
decision or
outcome i had from a particular race is

11524
02:51:42,070 --> 02:51:42,080
outcome i had from a particular race is
 

11525
02:51:42,080 --> 02:51:44,070
outcome i had from a particular race is
just like the trajectory of like you

11526
02:51:44,070 --> 02:51:44,080
just like the trajectory of like you
 

11527
02:51:44,080 --> 02:51:45,990
just like the trajectory of like you
know doing what i'm doing now

11528
02:51:45,990 --> 02:51:46,000
know doing what i'm doing now
 

11529
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:48,150
know doing what i'm doing now
is so much different from what i would

11530
02:51:48,150 --> 02:51:48,160
is so much different from what i would
 

11531
02:51:48,160 --> 02:51:49,830
is so much different from what i would
have ever expected

11532
02:51:49,830 --> 02:51:49,840
have ever expected
 

11533
02:51:49,840 --> 02:51:52,469
have ever expected
uh you know i mean i was a talented

11534
02:51:52,469 --> 02:51:52,479
uh you know i mean i was a talented
 

11535
02:51:52,479 --> 02:51:53,670
uh you know i mean i was a talented
enough runner where i could make the

11536
02:51:53,670 --> 02:51:53,680
enough runner where i could make the
 

11537
02:51:53,680 --> 02:51:55,269
enough runner where i could make the
state meet by my senior year at a small

11538
02:51:55,269 --> 02:51:55,279
state meet by my senior year at a small
 

11539
02:51:55,279 --> 02:51:56,309
state meet by my senior year at a small
division iii school

11540
02:51:56,309 --> 02:51:56,319
division iii school
 

11541
02:51:56,319 --> 02:51:58,710
division iii school
and you know compete at a division three

11542
02:51:58,710 --> 02:51:58,720
and you know compete at a division three
 

11543
02:51:58,720 --> 02:52:00,389
and you know compete at a division three
college and be pretty

11544
02:52:00,389 --> 02:52:00,399
college and be pretty
 

11545
02:52:00,399 --> 02:52:03,510
college and be pretty
modest talent comparative to my to my

11546
02:52:03,510 --> 02:52:03,520
modest talent comparative to my to my
 

11547
02:52:03,520 --> 02:52:05,670
modest talent comparative to my to my
peers at the top level of division three

11548
02:52:05,670 --> 02:52:05,680
peers at the top level of division three
 

11549
02:52:05,680 --> 02:52:07,910
peers at the top level of division three
um to think that like i'd be doing

11550
02:52:07,910 --> 02:52:07,920
um to think that like i'd be doing
 

11551
02:52:07,920 --> 02:52:09,429
um to think that like i'd be doing
anything that was revolved around

11552
02:52:09,429 --> 02:52:09,439
anything that was revolved around
 

11553
02:52:09,439 --> 02:52:10,070
anything that was revolved around
running as

11554
02:52:10,070 --> 02:52:10,080
running as
 

11555
02:52:10,080 --> 02:52:13,670
running as
as an occupation as is uh i still

11556
02:52:13,670 --> 02:52:13,680
as an occupation as is uh i still
 

11557
02:52:13,680 --> 02:52:14,790
as an occupation as is uh i still
second guess that that's actually

11558
02:52:14,790 --> 02:52:14,800
second guess that that's actually
 

11559
02:52:14,800 --> 02:52:16,550
second guess that that's actually
occurring makes me wonder about the

11560

still here
 

11651
02:53:29,680 --> 02:53:31,269
still here
but i mean that was there's a

11652
02:53:31,269 --> 02:53:31,279
but i mean that was there's a
 

11653
02:53:31,279 --> 02:53:32,710
but i mean that was there's a
tongue-in-cheek for sure but uh

12027
02:59:15,279 --> 02:59:17,429
them does not work with them and then
they just need a slightly different path

12028

they just need a slightly different path
 

12029
02:59:17,439 --> 02:59:19,030
they just need a slightly different path

12030
02:59:19,030 --> 02:59:19,040
or maybe a drastically different path
 

12031
02:59:19,040 --> 02:59:19,670
or maybe a drastically different path
and they're going to

12032
02:59:19,670 --> 02:59:19,680
and they're going to
 

12033
02:59:19,680 --> 02:59:22,230
and they're going to
just flourish and you have kids that end

12034
02:59:22,230 --> 02:59:22,240
just flourish and you have kids that end
 

12035
02:59:22,240 --> 02:59:23,670
just flourish and you have kids that end
up falling on the other end where

12036
02:59:23,670 --> 02:59:23,680
up falling on the other end where
 

12037
02:59:23,680 --> 02:59:26,389
up falling on the other end where
you know maybe it's really difficult for

12038
02:59:26,389 --> 02:59:26,399
you know maybe it's really difficult for
 

12039
02:59:26,399 --> 02:59:26,950
you know maybe it's really difficult for
them

12040
02:59:26,950 --> 02:59:26,960
them
 

12041
02:59:26,960 --> 02:59:29,349
them
to be able to read at the speed of other

12042
02:59:29,349 --> 02:59:29,359
to be able to read at the speed of other
 

12043
02:59:29,359 --> 02:59:31,349
to be able to read at the speed of other
students but if you give them this

12044
02:59:31,349 --> 02:59:31,359
students but if you give them this
 

12045
02:59:31,359 --> 02:59:33,750
students but if you give them this
specific direction they can just thrive

12046
02:59:33,750 --> 02:59:33,760
specific direction they can just thrive
 

12047
02:59:33,760 --> 02:59:35,670
specific direction they can just thrive
in a certain area and just

12048
02:59:35,670 --> 02:59:35,680
in a certain area and just
 

12049
02:59:35,680 --> 02:59:38,710
in a certain area and just
seeing that like the you know like that

12050
02:59:38,710 --> 02:59:38,720
seeing that like the you know like that
 

12051
02:59:38,720 --> 02:59:39,190
seeing that like the you know like that
there's

12052
02:59:39,190 --> 02:59:39,200
there's
 

12053
02:59:39,200 --> 02:59:40,710
there's
multiple ways to do stuff and there's

12054
02:59:40,710 --> 02:59:40,720
multiple ways to do stuff and there's
 

12055
02:59:40,720 --> 02:59:43,190
multiple ways to do stuff and there's
not necessarily one path to the end

12056
02:59:43,190 --> 02:59:43,200
not necessarily one path to the end
 

12057
02:59:43,200 --> 02:59:45,190
not necessarily one path to the end
is i think such an eye-opening thing to

12058
02:59:45,190 --> 02:59:45,200
is i think such an eye-opening thing to
 

12059
02:59:45,200 --> 02:59:46,309
is i think such an eye-opening thing to
learn especially if you learn maybe

12060
02:59:46,309 --> 02:59:46,319
learn especially if you learn maybe
 

12061
02:59:46,319 --> 02:59:47,830
learn especially if you learn maybe
that's what i should answer the question

12062
02:59:47,830 --> 02:59:47,840
that's what i should answer the question
 

12063
02:59:47,840 --> 02:59:49,750
that's what i should answer the question
that you asked me with is you know keep

12064
02:59:49,750 --> 02:59:49,760
that you asked me with is you know keep
 

12065
02:59:49,760 --> 02:59:51,429
that you asked me with is you know keep
an open mind as to what paths there are

12066
02:59:51,429 --> 02:59:51,439
an open mind as to what paths there are
 

12067
02:59:51,439 --> 02:59:52,630
an open mind as to what paths there are
forward and

12068
02:59:52,630 --> 02:59:52,640
forward and
 

12069
02:59:52,640 --> 02:59:55,110
forward and
know that you know maybe just because

12070
02:59:55,110 --> 02:59:55,120
know that you know maybe just because
 

12071
02:59:55,120 --> 02:59:56,710
know that you know maybe just because
even if you look to your left you look

12072
