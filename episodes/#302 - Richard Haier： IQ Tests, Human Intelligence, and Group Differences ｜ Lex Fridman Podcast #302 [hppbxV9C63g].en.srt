137
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,110
started with charles spearman
and he noticed this is like a boy more

00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:39,120
and he noticed this is like a boy more
 

139
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,110
and he noticed this is like a boy more
than a hundred years ago

than a hundred years ago
 

141
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,030
than a hundred years ago
uh he noticed

142
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,040
uh he noticed
 

143
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,150
uh he noticed
that

144
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:44,160
that
 

145
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,309

all the tests were correlated positively

150
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:53,120
all the tests were correlated positively
 

151
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,070
all the tests were correlated positively
and so he was looking at student exams

152
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:56,080
and so he was looking at student exams
 

153
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,350
and so he was looking at student exams
and things

154
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:57,360
and things
 

155
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,190
and things
and he invented the correlation

156
00:02:59,190 --> 00:02:59,200
and he invented the correlation
 

157
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,589
and he invented the correlation
coefficient essentially

158
00:03:01,589 --> 00:03:01,599
coefficient essentially
 

159
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,430

and he

160
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:03,440
and he
 

161
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,270
and he
when he used it to look at student

162
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:05,280
when he used it to look at student
 

163
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,390
when he used it to look at student
performance on various topics he found

165
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,270

they all the scores were correlated with

166
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,280
they all the scores were correlated with
 

167
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,110
they all the scores were correlated with
each other and they were all positive

168
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:13,120
each other and they were all positive
 

169
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,630
each other and they were all positive
correlations so he inferred from this

170
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:16,640
correlations so he inferred from this
 

171
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,190
correlations so he inferred from this
that there must be some common factor

172
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,200
that there must be some common factor
 

173
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,390
that there must be some common factor
that was irrespective of the content of

174
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:22,400
that was irrespective of the content of
 

175
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,990
that was irrespective of the content of
the test and positive correlation means

176
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,000
the test and positive correlation means
 

177
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,229
the test and positive correlation means
if you do well on on the first test

178
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:28,239
if you do well on on the first test
 

179
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,990
if you do well on on the first test
you're likely to do well in the second

180
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,000
you're likely to do well in the second
 

181
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,110
you're likely to do well in the second
test and presumably that holds

182
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:33,120
test and presumably that holds
 

183
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,710
test and presumably that holds
for tests across even disciplines so

184
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:36,720
for tests across even disciplines so
 

185
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,190
for tests across even disciplines so
not within subject but across subjects

186
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:39,200
not within subject but across subjects
 

187
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,789
not within subject but across subjects
so that's

188
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:40,799
so that's
 

189
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,869
so that's
where the general comes in some

190
00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:42,879
where the general comes in some
 

191
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,949
where the general comes in some
something about general intelligence so

192
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:44,959
something about general intelligence so
 

193
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,149
something about general intelligence so
when you were talking about measuring

194
00:03:46,149 --> 00:03:46,159
when you were talking about measuring
 

195
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,309
when you were talking about measuring
intelligence and and trying to figure

196
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:48,319
intelligence and and trying to figure
 

197
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,110
intelligence and and trying to figure
out

198
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,120
out
 

199
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,869
out
something difficult about this world and

200
00:03:50,869 --> 00:03:50,879
something difficult about this world and
 

201
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,030
something difficult about this world and
how to solve the puzzles of this world

202
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,040
how to solve the puzzles of this world
 

203
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,030
how to solve the puzzles of this world
that means generally speaking not some

204
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,040
that means generally speaking not some
 

205
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,070
that means generally speaking not some
specific tests but across all tests

206
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,080
specific tests but across all tests
 

207
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,550
specific tests but across all tests
absolutely right and people get hung up

208
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:00,560
absolutely right and people get hung up
 

209
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,750
absolutely right and people get hung up
on this

210
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:01,760
on this
 

211
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,149
on this
uh because they said well what about the

212
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:04,159
uh because they said well what about the
 

213
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,470
uh because they said well what about the
ability to do x

214
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:06,480
ability to do x
 

215
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,670
ability to do x
isn't that

216
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:07,680
isn't that
 

217
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,070
isn't that
independent and they said i know

218
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:10,080
independent and they said i know
 

219
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,309
independent and they said i know
somebody who's very good at this but not

220
00:04:12,309 --> 00:04:12,319
somebody who's very good at this but not
 

221
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,589
somebody who's very good at this but not
so good at this other thing yeah and so

222
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:15,599
so good at this other thing yeah and so
 

223
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,270
so good at this other thing yeah and so
there are a lot of examples like that

224
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:17,280
there are a lot of examples like that
 

225
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,870
there are a lot of examples like that
but it's a general tendency so

226
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:20,880
but it's a general tendency so
 

227
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,510
but it's a general tendency so
exceptions really don't disprove

228
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:23,520
exceptions really don't disprove
 

229
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,390
exceptions really don't disprove
you know your your everyday experience

00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:26,400
you know your your everyday experience

you say oh i know someone who's good at
 

239
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,030
you say oh i know someone who's good at

241
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,350

contradict the statement of about a he's

contradict the statement of about a he's
 

243
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,189
contradict the statement of about a he's
not so good but he's not the opposite

00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:43,199
not so good but he's not the opposite
 

245
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,950
not so good but he's not the opposite
he's not a it's not a negative

246
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:44,960
he's not a it's not a negative

okay so we're not with our anecdotal

250
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:48,720
okay so we're not with our anecdotal
 

251
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,749
okay so we're not with our anecdotal
data

252
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:49,759
data
 

253
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,950
data
i know a guy is really good at

254
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:52,960
i know a guy is really good at
 

255
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,749
i know a guy is really good at
solving some kind of visual thing

256
00:04:55,749 --> 00:04:55,759
solving some kind of visual thing
 

257
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,430
solving some kind of visual thing
that's not

258
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:57,440
that's not
 

259
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,270
that's not
sufficient for us to understand actually

260
00:04:59,270 --> 00:04:59,280
sufficient for us to understand actually
 

261
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,270
sufficient for us to understand actually
the depths of that person's intelligence

262
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,280
the depths of that person's intelligence
 

263
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,150
the depths of that person's intelligence
so

264
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:02,160
so
 

265
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,350
so
how this idea of g factor

266
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:07,360

 

267
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,270

how much evidence is there

268
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:09,280
how much evidence is there
 

269
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,029
how much evidence is there
how strong

270
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:11,039
how strong
 

271
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,029
how strong
you know given across the decades that

272
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:13,039
you know given across the decades that
 

273
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,270
you know given across the decades that
this idea has been around how much has

274
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:15,280
this idea has been around how much has
 

275
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,950
this idea has been around how much has
it been held up that there is a

276
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:16,960
it been held up that there is a
 

277
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,029
it been held up that there is a
universal

278
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:19,039
universal
 

279
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:19,990
universal
uh

280
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,000
uh
 

281
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,390
uh
sort of horsepower of intelligence

282
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:22,400
sort of horsepower of intelligence
 

283
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,230
sort of horsepower of intelligence
that's underneath all of it all the

284
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:24,240
that's underneath all of it all the
 

285
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,469
that's underneath all of it all the
different tests we do to try to get to

286
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:26,479
different tests we do to try to get to
 

287
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:27,749

this thing

288
00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:27,759
this thing
 

289
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,230
this thing
uh in in the depths of the human mind

290
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:30,240
uh in in the depths of the human mind
 

291
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,390
uh in in the depths of the human mind
that's a that's a universal stable

292
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:32,400
that's a that's a universal stable
 

293
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,710
that's a that's a universal stable
measure of a person's intelligence

294
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:34,720

295
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,870
measure of a person's intelligence
you used a couple of words in there yeah

296
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:36,880
you used a couple of words in there yeah
 

297
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,710
you used a couple of words in there yeah
stable and

298
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:38,720
stable and
 

299
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,710
stable and
we have to be precise with words well

300
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:40,720
we have to be precise with words well
 

301
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,629
we have to be precise with words well
hoping we can get away with being poetic

302
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:42,639
hoping we can get away with being poetic
 

303
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,670
hoping we can get away with being poetic
we can there's a lot about research in

00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:45,680
we can there's a lot about research in
 

305
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,749
we can there's a lot about research in
general not just intelligence research

306
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:47,759
general not just intelligence research
 

307
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,510
general not just intelligence research
that is poetic

308
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:49,520
that is poetic
 

309
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,790
that is poetic
science has a phonetic aspect to it and

310
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:52,800
science has a phonetic aspect to it and
 

311
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,670
science has a phonetic aspect to it and
good scientists are are very intuitive

312
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:55,680
good scientists are are very intuitive
 

313
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,110

00:05:59,510 --> 00:05:59,520
hey these are the numbers you have to
 

317
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,189
hey these are the numbers you have to
kind of step back and see the big

318
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:01,199
kind of step back and see the big
 

319
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,749
kind of step back and see the big
picture when it comes to

00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:03,759
picture when it comes to

research you asked how well has this

324
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:07,600
research you asked how well has this
 

325

now some cynics may say well big deal

00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:22,880
now some cynics may say well big deal
 

339
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,230
now some cynics may say well big deal
psychology we all know there's a

340
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,240
psychology we all know there's a
 

341
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,309
psychology we all know there's a
replication crisis in psychology and a

342
00:06:26,309 --> 00:06:26,319
replication crisis in psychology and a
 

343
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,309
replication crisis in psychology and a
lot of this stuff doesn't replicate

344
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:28,319
lot of this stuff doesn't replicate
 

345
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,950
lot of this stuff doesn't replicate
that's all true there is no replication

346
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:30,960
that's all true there is no replication
 

347
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,670
that's all true there is no replication
crisis when it comes to studying the the

348
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:33,680
crisis when it comes to studying the the
 

349
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,870
crisis when it comes to studying the the
existence of this general factor let me

350
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:36,880
existence of this general factor let me
 

351
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,590
existence of this general factor let me
tell you some things about it it is it

352
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:39,600
tell you some things about it it is it
 

353
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,469
tell you some things about it it is it
it looks like it's universal in uh that

354
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:42,479
it looks like it's universal in uh that
 

355
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,550
it looks like it's universal in uh that
you find it in all cultures

356
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:44,560
you find it in all cultures
 

357
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,029
you find it in all cultures
the way you find it let's step back one

358
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:47,039
the way you find it let's step back one
 

359
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,350
the way you find it let's step back one
one step the way you find it is to give

360
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:49,360
one step the way you find it is to give
 

361
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,749
one step the way you find it is to give
a battery of mental tests

362
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:51,759
a battery of mental tests
 

363
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,390
a battery of mental tests
what battery you choose take a battery

00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:54,400
what battery you choose take a battery
 

365
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,950
what battery you choose take a battery
of any mental test you want

366
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:56,960
of any mental test you want
 

367
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,830
of any mental test you want
give it to a large number of diverse

368
00:06:59,830 --> 00:06:59,840
give it to a large number of diverse
 

369
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,430
give it to a large number of diverse
people

370

people
 

371
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,150
people
and you will be able to extract

372
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,160
and you will be able to extract
 

373
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,589

00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,080
those tests it's done by a technique
 

379
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,390
those tests it's done by a technique
called factor analysis you

380
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:12,400
called factor analysis you
 

381
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,350
called factor analysis you

00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:14,319
uh
 

385
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,070
uh
think that's that this may be a

386
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,080
think that's that this may be a
 

387
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,629
think that's that this may be a
statistical artifact of some kind it is

388
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:18,639
statistical artifact of some kind it is
 

389
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,189
statistical artifact of some kind it is
not a statistical artifact

390
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:21,199
not a statistical artifact
 

391
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,430
not a statistical artifact
what is factor analysis factor analysis

392
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:23,440
what is factor analysis factor analysis
 

393
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,070
what is factor analysis factor analysis
is a way of looking at a big set of data

394
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,080
is a way of looking at a big set of data
 

395
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,070
is a way of looking at a big set of data
and look at the correlation among the

396
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,080
and look at the correlation among the
 

397
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,950
and look at the correlation among the
different test scores and then find

398
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:30,960
different test scores and then find
 

399
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,909
different test scores and then find
empirically the clusters of scores that

400
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:33,919
empirically the clusters of scores that
 

401
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,510
empirically the clusters of scores that
go together

402
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:35,520
go together
 

403
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,510
go together
and there are different factors so if

404
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:37,520
and there are different factors so if
 

405
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,350
and there are different factors so if
you have a bunch of mental tests there

406
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:39,360
you have a bunch of mental tests there
 

407
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,749
you have a bunch of mental tests there
may be a verbal factor there may be a

408
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:41,759
may be a verbal factor there may be a
 

409
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,309
may be a verbal factor there may be a
numerical factor there may be a visual

410
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:44,319
numerical factor there may be a visual
 

411
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,430
numerical factor there may be a visual
spatial factor but those factors have

412
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:47,440
spatial factor but those factors have
 

413
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,309
spatial factor but those factors have
variants in common with each other and

414
00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:50,319
variants in common with each other and
 

415
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,309
variants in common with each other and
that is the common

416
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:52,319
that is the common
 

417
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,790
that is the common
uh that's what's common among all the

418
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:54,800
uh that's what's common among all the
 

419
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,110
uh that's what's common among all the
tests and that's what gets labeled the g

420
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,120
tests and that's what gets labeled the g
 

421
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,749
tests and that's what gets labeled the g
factor so if you give a diverse battery

422
00:07:59,749 --> 00:07:59,759
factor so if you give a diverse battery
 

423
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,350
factor so if you give a diverse battery
of mental tests

424
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:01,360
of mental tests
 

425
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,869
of mental tests
and you extract a g factor from it that

426
00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:04,879
and you extract a g factor from it that
 

427
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,189
and you extract a g factor from it that
factor usually accounts for around half

428
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:07,199
factor usually accounts for around half
 

429
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,430
factor usually accounts for around half
of the variance it's the single biggest

430
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:09,440
of the variance it's the single biggest
 

431
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,710
of the variance it's the single biggest
factor but it's not the only factor

432
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:12,720
factor but it's not the only factor
 

433
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,430
factor but it's not the only factor
but it is the most reliable it is the

434
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:15,440
but it is the most reliable it is the
 

435
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,110
but it is the most reliable it is the
most stable

436
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:17,120
most stable
 

437
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,550
most stable
and it seems

438
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:20,560
and it seems
 

439
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,670
and it seems
to be very much influenced by genetics

440
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:23,680
to be very much influenced by genetics
 

441
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,629
to be very much influenced by genetics
it's very hard to change the g factor

442
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:26,639
it's very hard to change the g factor
 

443
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,150
it's very hard to change the g factor
with training

444
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:28,160
with training
 

445
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,070
with training
or

446
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,080
or
 

447
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,110
or
drugs

448
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:31,120
drugs
 

449
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,509
drugs
or anything else don't know how to

450
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:33,519
or anything else don't know how to
 

451
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,509
or anything else don't know how to
increase the g factor okay you said a

452
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:35,519
increase the g factor okay you said a
 

453
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,870
increase the g factor okay you said a
lot of really interesting things there

454
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:36,880
lot of really interesting things there
 

455
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,149
lot of really interesting things there
so

456
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:38,159
so
 

457
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,790
so
first i mean just to get people used to

458
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:40,800
first i mean just to get people used to
 

459
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,389
first i mean just to get people used to
in case they're not familiar with this

460
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:42,399
in case they're not familiar with this
 

461
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,870
in case they're not familiar with this
idea g factor

462
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:44,880
idea g factor
 

463
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,190
idea g factor
is what we mean so often there's a uh

464
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:47,200
is what we mean so often there's a uh
 

465
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,230
is what we mean so often there's a uh
this term used iq

466
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:50,240
this term used iq
 

467
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,509
this term used iq
which is

468
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:51,519
which is
 

469
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,870
which is
the way i iq is used they really mean g

470
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:54,880
the way i iq is used they really mean g
 

471
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,910
the way i iq is used they really mean g
factor

472
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:55,920

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,030
in regular conversation
the way cause we what we mean by iq we

476
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:01,040
the way cause we what we mean by iq we
 

477
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,750
the way cause we what we mean by iq we
mean intelligence and what we mean by

478
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:03,760
mean intelligence and what we mean by
 

479
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,030
mean intelligence and what we mean by
intelligence we mean general

480
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,040
intelligence we mean general
 

481
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,269

means g factor so g factor equals

490
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,040
means g factor so g factor equals
 

491
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,030

to define terms okay so so there's this

494
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:20,160
to define terms okay so so there's this
 

495
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,670
to define terms okay so so there's this
stable thing called g factor you said

496
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:23,680
stable thing called g factor you said
 

497
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,790
stable thing called g factor you said
now

498
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:24,800
now
 

499
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,230
now
factor you said factor many times

500
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:28,240
factor you said factor many times
 

501
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,430
factor you said factor many times
means

502
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:29,440
means
 

503
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,030
means

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,829
some have more than others i'm getting
uncomfortable already well iq is a score

600
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:25,839
uncomfortable already well iq is a score
 

601
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,829
uncomfortable already well iq is a score
and i q an iq score is a very good

602
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:29,839
and i q an iq score is a very good
 

603
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,870
and i q an iq score is a very good
estimate of the g factor you can't

604
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:32,880
estimate of the g factor you can't
 

605
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,190
estimate of the g factor you can't
measure g directly there's no direct

606
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:35,200
measure g directly there's no direct
 

607
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,509
measure g directly there's no direct
measure you estimate it from these

608
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:37,519
measure you estimate it from these
 

609
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,670
measure you estimate it from these
statistical techniques

610
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:39,680
statistical techniques
 

611
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,949
statistical techniques
but an iq score is a good estimate why

612
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:42,959
but an iq score is a good estimate why
 

613
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,310
but an iq score is a good estimate why
because a standard iq test is a battery

614
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:46,320
because a standard iq test is a battery
 

615
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,550
because a standard iq test is a battery
of different mental abilities

616
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:48,560
of different mental abilities
 

617
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,269
of different mental abilities
you combined it into one score

618
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:51,279
you combined it into one score
 

619
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,150
you combined it into one score
and that score is highly correlated with

620
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:54,160
and that score is highly correlated with
 

621
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,190
and that score is highly correlated with
the g factor even if you get better

622
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:57,200
the g factor even if you get better
 

623
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,990
the g factor even if you get better
scores on some subtest than others

624
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,000
scores on some subtest than others
 

625
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,550
scores on some subtest than others
because again it's what's common to all

626
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:02,560
because again it's what's common to all
 

627
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,670
because again it's what's common to all
these mental abilities so that a good iq

628
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:05,680
these mental abilities so that a good iq
 

629
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,870
these mental abilities so that a good iq
test

630
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:06,880

631
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,629
test
and i'll ask you about that but a good

632
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:08,639
and i'll ask you about that but a good
 

633
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,550
and i'll ask you about that but a good
iq test tries to compress down

634
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:12,560
iq test tries to compress down
 

635
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,550

that battery of tests like tries to get

636
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:14,560
that battery of tests like tries to get
 

637
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,150
that battery of tests like tries to get
a nice battery

638
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:16,160
a nice battery
 

639
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,269
a nice battery
the nice selection of variable tests

640
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:19,279
the nice selection of variable tests
 

641
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,269
the nice selection of variable tests
into one test

642
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:21,279
into one test
 

643
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,670
into one test
and so in that way it sneaks up to this

644
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:23,680
and so in that way it sneaks up to this
 

645
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,750
and so in that way it sneaks up to this
gfa and that's another interesting thing

646
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:25,760
gfa and that's another interesting thing
 

647
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,230
gfa and that's another interesting thing
about g factor

so what's the difference if you can

838
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:57,360
so what's the difference if you can
 

839
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,269
so what's the difference if you can
elaborate a little bit further between

840
00:15:59,269 --> 00:15:59,279
elaborate a little bit further between
 

841
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,990
elaborate a little bit further between
iq and g factor just because it's a

842
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:02,000
iq and g factor just because it's a
 

843
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,550
iq and g factor just because it's a
source of confusion for people and iq is

844
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:04,560
source of confusion for people and iq is
 

845
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,110
source of confusion for people and iq is
is a score people use the word iq to

846
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:07,120
is a score people use the word iq to
 

847
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,350
is a score people use the word iq to
mean intelligence but iq has a more

848
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:09,360
mean intelligence but iq has a more
 

849
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,949
mean intelligence but iq has a more
technical meaning

850
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:10,959
technical meaning
 

851
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,430
technical meaning
for people who work in the field and i

852
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:13,440
for people who work in the field and i
 

853
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,710
for people who work in the field and i
it's an iq score score on a test that

854
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:16,720
it's an iq score score on a test that
 

855
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,990
it's an iq score score on a test that
estimates the g factor

856
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:20,000
estimates the g factor
 

857
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,310
estimates the g factor
and the g factor is what's common among

858
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:22,320
and the g factor is what's common among
 

859
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,389
and the g factor is what's common among
all these tests of mental ability so if

860
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:24,399
all these tests of mental ability so if
 

861
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,949
all these tests of mental ability so if
you think about it's not a venn diagram

862
00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:26,959
you think about it's not a venn diagram
 

863
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,509
you think about it's not a venn diagram
but um i guess you could make a venn

864
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:29,519
but um i guess you could make a venn
 

865
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,670
but um i guess you could make a venn
diagram out of it but the g factor would

866
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:31,680
diagram out of it but the g factor would
 

867
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,749
diagram out of it but the g factor would
be really at the core

868
00:16:33,749 --> 00:16:33,759
be really at the core
 

869
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,430
be really at the core
what's what's common to everything

870
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:37,440
what's what's common to everything
 

871
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,590
what's what's common to everything
and i what iq scores do is they allow a

872
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:41,600
and i what iq scores do is they allow a
 

873
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,389
and i what iq scores do is they allow a
rank order of people on the score

874
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:44,399
rank order of people on the score
 

875
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,749
rank order of people on the score
and this is what makes people

876
00:16:45,749 --> 00:16:45,759
and this is what makes people
 

877
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,670
and this is what makes people
uncomfortable this is where there's a

878
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:47,680
uncomfortable this is where there's a
 

879
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,829
uncomfortable this is where there's a
lot of controversy about whether iq

880
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:49,839
lot of controversy about whether iq
 

881
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:53,189
lot of controversy about whether iq
tests are biased toward any one group or

882
00:16:53,189 --> 00:16:53,199
tests are biased toward any one group or
 

883
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:54,310
tests are biased toward any one group or
another

884
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:54,320
another
 

885
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,590
another
and

886
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:55,600
and
 

887
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,670
and
a lot of the the answers to these

888
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:57,680
a lot of the the answers to these
 

889
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,670
a lot of the the answers to these
questions are very clear but they also

890
00:16:59,670 --> 00:16:59,680
questions are very clear but they also
 

891
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,389
questions are very clear but they also
have a technical aspect of it that's not

892
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:02,399
have a technical aspect of it that's not
 

893
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,870
have a technical aspect of it that's not
so easy to to explain well we'll talk

894
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:04,880
so easy to to explain well we'll talk
 

895
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,789
so easy to to explain well we'll talk
about the fascinating and the difficult

896
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:06,799
about the fascinating and the difficult
 

897
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,549
about the fascinating and the difficult
things about all of this but uh

898
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:10,559
things about all of this but uh
 

899
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,470
things about all of this but uh
so by the way when you say rank order

900
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:12,480
so by the way when you say rank order
 

901
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,990
so by the way when you say rank order
that means you get a number and that

902
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:14,000
that means you get a number and that
 

903
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,429
that means you get a number and that
means one person you can now compare

904
00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:17,439
means one person you can now compare
 

905
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:18,710
means one person you can now compare
like uh

906
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:18,720
like uh
 

907
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,870
like uh
you could say that this other person is

908
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:20,880
you could say that this other person is
 

909
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,870
you could say that this other person is
more intelligent than me

910
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:22,880
more intelligent than me
 

911
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,870
more intelligent than me
well what you can say is

912
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:24,880
well what you can say is
 

913
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,949
well what you can say is
iq scores are interpreted really as

914
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:26,959
iq scores are interpreted really as
 

915
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,190
iq scores are interpreted really as
percentiles

916
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:29,200
percentiles
 

917
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,470
percentiles
so that

918
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:30,480
so that
 

919
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,830
so that
uh if you have an iq of 140 and somebody

920
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:33,840
uh if you have an iq of 140 and somebody
 

921
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,190
uh if you have an iq of 140 and somebody
else has 70 the metric is such that you

922
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:37,200
else has 70 the metric is such that you
 

923
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,230
else has 70 the metric is such that you
cannot say the person with an iq of 140

924
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:40,240
cannot say the person with an iq of 140
 

925
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,789
cannot say the person with an iq of 140
is twice as smart

926
00:17:42,789 --> 00:17:42,799
is twice as smart
 

927
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,830
is twice as smart
as a person with an iq of

928
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:45,840
as a person with an iq of
 

929
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,630
as a person with an iq of
that would require a ratio scale with an

930
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:48,640
that would require a ratio scale with an
 

931
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,870
that would require a ratio scale with an
absolute zero now you may think you know

932
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:50,880
absolute zero now you may think you know
 

933
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,350
absolute zero now you may think you know
people with zero intelligence but in

934
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:53,360
people with zero intelligence but in
 

935
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,310
people with zero intelligence but in
fact there is no absolute zero on on an

936
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:56,320
fact there is no absolute zero on on an
 

937
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,029
fact there is no absolute zero on on an
iq scale it's relative to other people

938
00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:01,039
iq scale it's relative to other people
 

939
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,510
iq scale it's relative to other people
so relative to other people somebody

940
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:03,520
so relative to other people somebody
 

941
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,270
so relative to other people somebody
with an iq score of 140 is in the upper

942
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:07,280
with an iq score of 140 is in the upper
 

943
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,270
with an iq score of 140 is in the upper
less than one percent

944
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:09,280
less than one percent
 

945
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,470
less than one percent
whereas

946
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:10,480
whereas
 

947
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,870
whereas
somebody with an iq of 70 is two

948
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:12,880
somebody with an iq of 70 is two
 

949
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,750
somebody with an iq of 70 is two
standard deviations below the mean that

950
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:15,760
standard deviations below the mean that
 

951
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,630
standard deviations below the mean that
that's that's a different percentile so

952
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:18,640
that's that's a different percentile so
 

953
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,029
that's that's a different percentile so
it's similar to like in chess you have

954
00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:21,039
it's similar to like in chess you have
 

955
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,070
it's similar to like in chess you have
an elo rating that's designed to

956
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:24,080
an elo rating that's designed to
 

957
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,430
an elo rating that's designed to
rank order

958
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:25,440
rank order
 

959
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,029
rank order
people

960
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:27,039
people
 

961
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,590
people
uh so you can't say it's twice

962
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:29,600
uh so you can't say it's twice
 

963
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,909
uh so you can't say it's twice
one person if if your yield rating is

964
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:31,919
one person if if your yield rating is
 

965
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:32,710
one person if if your yield rating is
twice

966
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:32,720
twice
 

967
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,070
twice
another person i don't think you're

968
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:34,080
another person i don't think you're
 

969
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,070
another person i don't think you're
twice as good at chess

970
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:36,080
twice as good at chess
 

971
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,150
twice as good at chess
it's not stable in that way but because

972
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:38,160
it's not stable in that way but because
 

973
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,150
it's not stable in that way but because
it's very difficult to do these kinds of

974
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:40,160
it's very difficult to do these kinds of
 

975
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,430
it's very difficult to do these kinds of
comparisons

976
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:41,440
comparisons
 

977
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,110
comparisons
but uh

978
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:43,120
but uh
 

979
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,029
but uh
so what can we say about the number

980
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:45,039
so what can we say about the number
 

981
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,870
so what can we say about the number
itself

982
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:46,880
itself
 

983
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,230
itself
is that stable

984
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:48,240
is that stable
 

985
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,789
is that stable
across tests and so on or no there are a

986
00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:50,799
across tests and so on or no there are a
 

987
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,590
across tests and so on or no there are a
number of statistical properties of any

988
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:53,600
number of statistical properties of any
 

989
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,430
number of statistical properties of any
test they're called psychometric

990
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:55,440
test they're called psychometric
 

991
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,669
test they're called psychometric
properties you have validity you have

992
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:57,679
properties you have validity you have
 

993
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,190
properties you have validity you have
reliability

994
00:18:59,190 --> 00:18:59,200
reliability
 

995
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,789
reliability
reliability there are many different

996
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:00,799
reliability there are many different
 

997
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,350
reliability there are many different
kinds of reliability they all

998
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:03,360
kinds of reliability they all
 

999
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,830
kinds of reliability they all
essentially measure stability

1000
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:05,840
essentially measure stability
 

1001
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,549
essentially measure stability
and iq tests are stable within an

1002
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:08,559
and iq tests are stable within an
 

1003
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,430
and iq tests are stable within an
individual there are some longitudinal

1004
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:11,440
individual there are some longitudinal
 

1005
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,270
individual there are some longitudinal
studies where

1006
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:13,280
studies where
 

1007
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,909
studies where
children were measured at age 11 and

1008
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:15,919
children were measured at age 11 and
 

1009
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,150
children were measured at age 11 and
again when they were 70 years old and

1010
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:18,160
again when they were 70 years old and
 

1011
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,029
again when they were 70 years old and
the two iq scores are highly correlated

1012
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:21,039
the two iq scores are highly correlated
 

1013
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,710
the two iq scores are highly correlated
with each other this comes from a

1014
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:22,720
with each other this comes from a
 

1015
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,390
with each other this comes from a
fascinating study from

00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:24,400
fascinating study from
 

1017
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,750
fascinating study from
scotland

uh in the 1930s some researchers decided

1020
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:30,080
uh in the 1930s some researchers decided
 

1021
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,270
uh in the 1930s some researchers decided
to get an iq test on every single child

1022
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:33,280
to get an iq test on every single child
 

1023
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,070
to get an iq test on every single child
age 11 in the whole country

1024
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:36,080
age 11 in the whole country
 

1025
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,510
age 11 in the whole country
and they did

1026
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:37,520
and they did
 

1027
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,710
and they did
and

1028
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:38,720
and
 

1029
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,390
and
those records

1030
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:40,400
those records
 

1031
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,190
those records
were discovered in an old storeroom at

1032
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:43,200
were discovered in an old storeroom at
 

1033
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,310
were discovered in an old storeroom at
the university of edinburgh

by a friend of mine ian deary who
 

1037
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,549
by a friend of mine ian deary who
found the records

1038
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:50,559
found the records
 

1039
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,350
found the records
digitized them and has done a lot of

1040
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:53,360
digitized them and has done a lot of
 

1041
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,190
digitized them and has done a lot of
research on

1042
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:55,200
research on
 

1043
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,350
research on
the people who are still alive today

1044
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:57,360
the people who are still alive today
 

1045
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,430
the people who are still alive today
from that original study including brain

1046
00:19:59,430 --> 00:19:59,440
from that original study including brain
 

1047
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,510
from that original study including brain
imaging research by the way really it's

1048
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:01,520
imaging research by the way really it's
 

1049
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,669
imaging research by the way really it's
a fascinating group of

1050
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:03,679
a fascinating group of
 

1051
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,909
a fascinating group of
of people who are who were studied

1052
00:20:07,909 --> 00:20:07,919
of people who are who were studied
 

1053
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,510
of people who are who were studied
not to get ahead of the story but one of

1054
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:09,520
not to get ahead of the story but one of
 

1055
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,390
not to get ahead of the story but one of
the most interesting things they found

1056
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:12,400
the most interesting things they found
 

1057
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,909
the most interesting things they found
is a very strong relationship between iq

1058
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:15,919
is a very strong relationship between iq
 

1059
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,470
is a very strong relationship between iq
measured at age 11

1060
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:18,480
measured at age 11
 

1061
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,669
measured at age 11
and mortality

1062
00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:21,679
and mortality
 

1063
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,669
and mortality
so that

1064
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:23,679
so that
 

1065
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,190
so that
you know

1066
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:25,200
you know
 

1067
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,149
you know
in the

1068
00:20:26,149 --> 00:20:26,159
in the
 

1069
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,110
in the
70 years later

1070
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:29,120
70 years later
 

1071
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,950
70 years later
they looked at the survival rates and

1072
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:30,960
they looked at the survival rates and
 

1073
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,470
they looked at the survival rates and
they could get death records from

1074
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:32,480
they could get death records from
 

1075
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,110
they could get death records from
everybody and scotland has universal

1076
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:35,120
everybody and scotland has universal
 

1077
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,950
everybody and scotland has universal
health care for everybody

1078
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:36,960
health care for everybody
 

1079
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,190
health care for everybody
and it turned out if you divide

1080
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:39,200
and it turned out if you divide
 

1081
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,230
and it turned out if you divide
people by their age 11 iq score into

1082
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:42,240
people by their age 11 iq score into
 

1083
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,830
people by their age 11 iq score into
quartiles

1084
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:43,840
quartiles
 

1085
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,830
quartiles
and then look at how many people are

1086
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:45,840
and then look at how many people are
 

1087
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,110
and then look at how many people are
alive

1088
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:47,120
alive
 

1089
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,430
alive
70 years later

1090
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:49,440
70 years later
 

1091
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,789
70 years later
the

1092
00:20:50,789 --> 00:20:50,799
the
 

1093
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,789
the
i know this is in the book they have the

1094
00:20:52,789 --> 00:20:52,799
i know this is in the book they have the
 

1095
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,549
i know this is in the book they have the
graph in the book

1096
00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:54,559
graph in the book
 

1097
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,870
graph in the book
but there are essentially twice as many

1098
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:56,880
but there are essentially twice as many
 

1099
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,590
but there are essentially twice as many
people alive in the highest iq quartile

1100
00:20:59,590 --> 00:20:59,600
people alive in the highest iq quartile
 

1101
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,149
people alive in the highest iq quartile
than in the lowest iq quartile it's true

1102
00:21:02,149 --> 00:21:02,159
than in the lowest iq quartile it's true
 

1103
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,549
than in the lowest iq quartile it's true
in men and women

1104
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:04,559
in men and women
 

1105
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,789
in men and women
um interesting

1106
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:06,799
um interesting
 

1107
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,549
um interesting
so it makes a big difference now why

1108
00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:08,559
so it makes a big difference now why
 

1109
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,630
so it makes a big difference now why
this is the case

1110
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:10,640
this is the case
 

1111
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,789
this is the case
is not so clear

1112
00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:12,799
is not so clear
 

1113
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,430
is not so clear
since everyone had access to health care

1114
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:15,440
since everyone had access to health care
 

1115
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,110
since everyone had access to health care
well there's a lot and we'll talk about

1116
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:17,120
well there's a lot and we'll talk about
 

1117
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,390
well there's a lot and we'll talk about
it you know

1118
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:18,400
it you know
 

1119
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,190
it you know
just

1120
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:19,200
just
 

1121
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,990
just
the sentences you used now

1122
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:22,000
the sentences you used now
 

1123
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,909
the sentences you used now
could be explained by

1124
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:23,919
could be explained by
 

1125
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,110
could be explained by
nature or nurture we don't know now

1126
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:27,120
nature or nurture we don't know now
 

1127
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,789
nature or nurture we don't know now
there's a lot of science that starts to

1128
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:28,799
there's a lot of science that starts to
 

1129
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,950
there's a lot of science that starts to
then dig in and investigate that

1130
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:30,960
then dig in and investigate that
 

1131
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,870
then dig in and investigate that
question but let me linger on the iq

1132
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:32,880
question but let me linger on the iq
 

1133
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,909
question but let me linger on the iq
test how are the tests designed iq tests

1134
00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:35,919
test how are the tests designed iq tests
 

1135
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,830
test how are the tests designed iq tests
designed how do they work maybe some

1136
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:37,840
designed how do they work maybe some
 

1137
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,909
designed how do they work maybe some
examples for people who are not aware

1138
00:21:39,909 --> 00:21:39,919
examples for people who are not aware
 

1139
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,270
examples for people who are not aware
what

1140
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:41,280
what
 

1141
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,310
what
what makes a good iq test question that

1142
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:44,320
what makes a good iq test question that
 

1143
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,190
what makes a good iq test question that
sneaks up on this on this g factor

1144
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:47,200
sneaks up on this on this g factor
 

1145
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,029
sneaks up on this on this g factor
measure well your question is

1146
00:21:49,029 --> 00:21:49,039
measure well your question is
 

1147
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,590
measure well your question is
interesting because you want me to give

1148
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:51,600
interesting because you want me to give
 

1149
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,270
interesting because you want me to give
examples of items that make good items

1150
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:55,280
examples of items that make good items
 

1151
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,350
examples of items that make good items
and what makes a good item is not so

1152
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:57,360
and what makes a good item is not so
 

1153
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,270
and what makes a good item is not so
much its content

1154
00:21:59,270 --> 00:21:59,280
much its content
 

1155
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,750
much its content
but its empirical relationship to the

1156
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:01,760
but its empirical relationship to the
 

1157
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,230
but its empirical relationship to the
total score that

1158
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:04,240
total score that
 

1159
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,350
total score that
turns out to be valid by other means

1160
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:07,360
turns out to be valid by other means
 

1161
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,630
turns out to be valid by other means
yeah so for example

1162
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:10,640
yeah so for example
 

1163
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,630
yeah so for example
let me give you an odd example from

1164
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:12,640
let me give you an odd example from
 

1165
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,510
let me give you an odd example from

paying attention to that but they have

1180
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:31,840
paying attention to that but they have
 

1181
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,750
paying attention to that but they have
not been paying attention they had

1182
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:33,760
not been paying attention they had
 

1183
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,830
not been paying attention they had
psychologists on the st on the stand and

1184
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:35,840
psychologists on the st on the stand and
 

1185
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,750
psychologists on the st on the stand and
they were talking apparently those

1186
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:37,760
they were talking apparently those
 

1187
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,710
they were talking apparently those
psychologists did uh again i'm learning

1188
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:40,720
psychologists did uh again i'm learning
 

1189
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,190
psychologists did uh again i'm learning
so much from this trial they have uh

1190
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:43,200
so much from this trial they have uh
 

1191
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,110
so much from this trial they have uh
they did different at the battery of

1192
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:45,120
they did different at the battery of
 

1193
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,950
they did different at the battery of
tests

1194
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:46,960
tests
 

1195
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,310
tests
to uh diagnose personality disorders

1196
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:50,320
to uh diagnose personality disorders
 

1197
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,830
to uh diagnose personality disorders
apparently there's that

1198
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:51,840
apparently there's that
 

1199
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,430
apparently there's that
systematic way of doing so and the

1200
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:53,440
systematic way of doing so and the
 

1201
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,950
systematic way of doing so and the
minnesota one is

1202
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:54,960
minnesota one is
 

1203
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,430
minnesota one is
one of the ones that there's the most

1204
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:57,440
one of the ones that there's the most
 

1205
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,310
one of the ones that there's the most
science on there's a lot of great papers

1206

science on there's a lot of great papers
which were all

1208
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:01,840
which were all
 

1209
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,070
which were all
continuously cited on the stand which is

1210
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:04,080
continuously cited on the stand which is
 

1211
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,830
continuously cited on the stand which is
fascinating to watch sorry a little bit

1212
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:05,840
fascinating to watch sorry a little bit
 

1213
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,029
fascinating to watch sorry a little bit
of attention okay i mean this is

1214
00:23:07,029 --> 00:23:07,039
of attention okay i mean this is
 

1215
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,230
of attention okay i mean this is
interesting because you're right it's

1216
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:08,240
interesting because you're right it's
 

1217
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,070
interesting because you're right it's
been around for decades there's a lot of

1218

been around for decades there's a lot of
 

1219
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,230
been around for decades there's a lot of
scientific research on the psychometric

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,830
than washington
what have all these what does that have

1250
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:45,840
what have all these what does that have
 

1251
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,669
what have all these what does that have
to do

1252
00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:47,679
to do
 

1253
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,269
to do
and the point is the content of these

1254
00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:49,279
and the point is the content of these
 

1255
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,669
and the point is the content of these
items nobody knows why

1256
00:23:51,669 --> 00:23:51,679
items nobody knows why
 

1257
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,149
items nobody knows why
these items in aggregate predict

1258
00:23:54,149 --> 00:23:54,159
these items in aggregate predict
 

1259
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,750
these items in aggregate predict
anything but empirically they do

1260
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:57,760
anything but empirically they do
 

1261
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,470
anything but empirically they do
it's a technique of of choosing items

1262
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:00,480
it's a technique of of choosing items
 

1263
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,750
it's a technique of of choosing items
for a test

1264
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:01,760
for a test
 

1265
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,669
for a test
that is called dust bowl empiricism

1266
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:05,679
that is called dust bowl empiricism
 

1267
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,430
that is called dust bowl empiricism
that the content doesn't matter but

1268
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:07,440
that the content doesn't matter but
 

1269
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,350
that the content doesn't matter but
there it for some reason when you get a

1270
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:09,360
there it for some reason when you get a
 

1271
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,510
there it for some reason when you get a
criterion group of people with this

1272
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:11,520
criterion group of people with this
 

1273
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,390
criterion group of people with this
disorder and you compare them to people

1274
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:14,400
disorder and you compare them to people
 

1275
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,710
disorder and you compare them to people
without that disorder these are the

1276
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:16,720
without that disorder these are the
 

1277
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,110
without that disorder these are the
items that distinguish

1278
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:19,120
items that distinguish
 

1279
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,110
items that distinguish
irrespective of content it's a hard

1280
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:21,120
irrespective of content it's a hard
 

1281
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,830
irrespective of content it's a hard
concept to grasp well uh first of all

1282
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:23,840
concept to grasp well uh first of all
 

1283
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,269
concept to grasp well uh first of all
it's fascinating

1284
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:25,279
it's fascinating
 

1285
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:26,470
it's fascinating
but

1286
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:26,480
but
 

1287
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,590
but
uh from uh because i

1288
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:29,600
uh from uh because i
 

1289
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,870
uh from uh because i
i i consider myself part psychologist

1290
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:32,880
i i consider myself part psychologist
 

1291
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,190
i i consider myself part psychologist
because i love human robot interaction

1292
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:35,200
because i love human robot interaction
 

1293
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,029
because i love human robot interaction
and that's a problem half of that

1294
00:24:37,029 --> 00:24:37,039
and that's a problem half of that
 

1295
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,070
and that's a problem half of that
problem

1296
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:38,080
problem
 

1297
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,909
problem
is a psychology problem because there's

1298
00:24:39,909 --> 00:24:39,919
is a psychology problem because there's
 

1299
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,590
is a psychology problem because there's
a human

1300
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:41,600
a human
 

1301
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,909
a human
so designing these tests to get at the

1302
00:24:43,909 --> 00:24:43,919
so designing these tests to get at the
 

1303
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,470
so designing these tests to get at the
questions is the fascinating part like

1304
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:46,480
questions is the fascinating part like
 

1305
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,870
questions is the fascinating part like
how do you get

1306
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:48,880
how do you get
 

1307
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,789
how do you get
to uh like what does dust bowl

1308
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:50,799
to uh like what does dust bowl
 

1309
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,990
to uh like what does dust bowl
empiricism refer to does it

1310
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:54,000
empiricism refer to does it
 

1311
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,350
empiricism refer to does it
refer to the final result

1312
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:57,360
refer to the final result
 

1313
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,710
refer to the final result
yeah so it's the test is dust bowl

1314
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:00,720
yeah so it's the test is dust bowl
 

1315
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,350
yeah so it's the test is dust bowl
empiricism but how do you arrive at the

1316
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:03,360
empiricism but how do you arrive at the
 

1317
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,310
empiricism but how do you arrive at the
battery of questions i presume

1318
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:06,320
battery of questions i presume
 

1319
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,390
battery of questions i presume
uh one of the things now again i'm going

1320
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:08,400
uh one of the things now again i'm going
 

1321
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,750
uh one of the things now again i'm going
to the excellent testimony in that trial

1322
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:11,760
to the excellent testimony in that trial
 

1323
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,990
to the excellent testimony in that trial
the explanation also they explain the

1324
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:14,000
the explanation also they explain the
 

1325
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,110
the explanation also they explain the
tests

1326
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:15,120
tests
 

1327
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,630
tests
uh

1328
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:16,640
uh

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,710
uh
that a bunch of the questions are kind

1330
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:18,720
that a bunch of the questions are kind
 

1331
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,470
that a bunch of the questions are kind

of
make you

1334
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:21,760
make you
 

1335
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,909
make you
forget that you're taking a test

1336
00:25:23,909 --> 00:25:23,919
forget that you're taking a test
 

1337
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:24,710
forget that you're taking a test
like

1338
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:24,720
like
 

1339
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,710
like
it makes it very difficult for you to

1340
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:26,720
it makes it very difficult for you to
 

1341
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,149
it makes it very difficult for you to
somehow figure out what what uh

1342
00:25:30,149 --> 00:25:30,159
somehow figure out what what uh
 

1343
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,070
somehow figure out what what uh
you're supposed to answer yes it's

1344
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:32,080
you're supposed to answer yes it's
 

1345
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,230
you're supposed to answer yes it's
called social desirability but we're

1346
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:34,240
called social desirability but we're
 

1347
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,750
called social desirability but we're
getting a little far afield because i

1348
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:35,760
getting a little far afield because i
 

1349
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,669

only wanted to give that example of dust

1350
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:37,679
only wanted to give that example of dust

bowl empiricism
 

1353
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,789

whereas most intelligence tests the

1370
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:00,000
whereas most intelligence tests the
 

1371
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,590

00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:01,600
items actually look like they're
 

1373
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,549
items actually look like they're
measuring some mental ability so here's

1374
00:26:04,549 --> 00:26:04,559
measuring some mental ability so here's
 

1375
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,149
measuring some mental ability so here's
here's one so you were bringing that up

1376
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:06,159
here's one so you were bringing that up
 

1377
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,950
here's one so you were bringing that up
as an example as what it is not yes got

1378
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:08,960
as an example as what it is not yes got
 

1379
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,350
as an example as what it is not yes got
it okay so i don't want to go too far

1380
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:11,360
it okay so i don't want to go too far
 

1381
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,909
it okay so i don't want to go too far
afield on it well too far afield is

1382
00:26:13,909 --> 00:26:13,919
afield on it well too far afield is
 

1383
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,430
afield on it well too far afield is
actually one of the names of this

1384
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:15,440
actually one of the names of this
 

1385
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,909
actually one of the names of this
podcast so uh

1386
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:17,919
podcast so uh
 

1387
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,149
podcast so uh
i should mention that far afield far

1388
00:26:20,149 --> 00:26:20,159
i should mention that far afield far
 

1389
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,029
i should mention that far afield far
field uh yeah so anyway sorry so so they

1390
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:23,039
field uh yeah so anyway sorry so so they
 

1391
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,909
field uh yeah so anyway sorry so so they
feel the questions look like they they

1392
00:26:25,909 --> 00:26:25,919
feel the questions look like they they
 

1393
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,470
feel the questions look like they they
pass the face validity test and some

1394
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:28,480
pass the face validity test and some
 

1395
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,549
pass the face validity test and some
more than others and so for example let

1396
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:30,559
more than others and so for example let
 

1397
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,549
more than others and so for example let
me give you a couple of things here

1398
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:32,559
me give you a couple of things here
 

1399
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:33,909
me give you a couple of things here
if i

1400
00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:33,919
if i
 

1401
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,789
if i
one of the subtests on a standard iq

1402
00:26:36,789 --> 00:26:36,799
one of the subtests on a standard iq
 

1403
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,630
one of the subtests on a standard iq
test is general information

1404
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:40,640
test is general information
 

1405
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,909
test is general information
let me just think a little bit because i

1406
00:26:41,909 --> 00:26:41,919
let me just think a little bit because i
 

1407
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,149
let me just think a little bit because i
don't want to give you the actual item

1408
00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:44,159
don't want to give you the actual item
 

1409
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,029
don't want to give you the actual item
but if i said how far is it

1410
00:26:47,029 --> 00:26:47,039
but if i said how far is it
 

1411
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,470
but if i said how far is it
between

1412
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:48,480
between
 

1413
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,149
between
washington dc and miami florida

1414

00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:55,520
within 500 miles plus or minus
 

1417
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,990
within 500 miles plus or minus
well you know it's not a fact most

1418
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:58,000
well you know it's not a fact most
 

1419
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,909
well you know it's not a fact most
people memorize

1420
00:26:59,909 --> 00:26:59,919
people memorize
 

1421
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,830
people memorize
but you can you know something about

1422
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:01,840
but you can you know something about
 

1423
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,310
but you can you know something about
geography you say well i flew there once

1424
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:04,320
geography you say well i flew there once
 

1425
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,870
geography you say well i flew there once
i know planes fly for 500 miles you know

1426
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:06,880
i know planes fly for 500 miles you know
 

1427
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,390
i know planes fly for 500 miles you know
you can get you can kind of make an

1428
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:08,400
you can get you can kind of make an
 

1429
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,230
you can get you can kind of make an
estimate

1430
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:10,240
estimate
 

1431
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,390
estimate
but it's also seems like it would be

1432
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:12,400
but it's also seems like it would be
 

1433
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,470
but it's also seems like it would be
very cultural

1434
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:14,480
very cultural
 

1435
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,630
very cultural
um you know

1436
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:16,640
um you know
 

1437
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,470
um you know
so there's that kind of

1438
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:18,480
so there's that kind of
 

1439
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,590
so there's that kind of
general information then there's

1440
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:20,600
general information then there's
 

1441
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,710
general information then there's
vocabulary test

1442
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:22,720

what does
uh

1446
00:27:26,149 --> 00:27:26,159
uh

regatta mean
 

1449
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,950
regatta mean
and i choose that word because that word

1450
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:30,960
and i choose that word because that word
 

1451
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,269
and i choose that word because that word
was removed from the iq test because

1452
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:33,279
was removed from the iq test because
 

1453
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,510
was removed from the iq test because
people complained that disadvantaged

1454
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:35,520
people complained that disadvantaged
 

1455
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,789
people complained that disadvantaged
people would not know that word

1456
00:27:38,789 --> 00:27:38,799
people would not know that word
 

1457
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,870
people would not know that word
just from their everyday

1458
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:40,880
just from their everyday
 

1459
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,990
just from their everyday
life

1460
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:42,000
life
 

1461
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,870
life
okay

1462
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:42,880
okay
 

1463
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,350
okay
here's another example from a different

1464
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:45,360
here's another example from a different
 

1465
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,310
here's another example from a different
kind of subtest on what's regatta by the

1466
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:48,320
kind of subtest on what's regatta by the
 

1467
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,870
kind of subtest on what's regatta by the
way a regatta is a um

1468
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:50,880
way a regatta is a um
 

1469
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,710
way a regatta is a um
i think this advantage is a sailing

1470
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:52,720
i think this advantage is a sailing
 

1471
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,510
i think this advantage is a sailing
competition a competition with boats not

1472
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:55,520
competition a competition with boats not
 

1473
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,710
competition a competition with boats not
necessarily sailing but the competition

1474
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:58,720
necessarily sailing but the competition
 

1475
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,430
necessarily sailing but the competition
yep yep okay i'm proudly disadvantaged

1476
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:01,440
yep yep okay i'm proudly disadvantaged
 

1477
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,269
yep yep okay i'm proudly disadvantaged
in that way okay excellent so that was

1478
00:28:03,269 --> 00:28:03,279
in that way okay excellent so that was
 

1479
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,590
in that way okay excellent so that was
removed okay what you were saying okay

1480
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:05,600
removed okay what you were saying okay
 

1481
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,750
removed okay what you were saying okay
so now here's a here's another subtest

1482
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:07,760
so now here's a here's another subtest
 

1483
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,669
so now here's a here's another subtest
i'm going to repeat a string of numbers

1484
00:28:09,669 --> 00:28:09,679
i'm going to repeat a string of numbers
 

1485
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,269
i'm going to repeat a string of numbers
and when i'm done i want you to repeat

1486
00:28:11,269 --> 00:28:11,279
and when i'm done i want you to repeat

six
 

1505
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,070
six
that's way too many seven four two eight

1506
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:24,080
that's way too many seven four two eight
 

1507
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,549
that's way too many seven four two eight
one six okay you get the idea now the

1508
00:28:26,549 --> 00:28:26,559
one six okay you get the idea now the
 

1509
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,630
one six okay you get the idea now the
actual test starts with

1510
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:28,640
actual test starts with
 

1511
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,389
actual test starts with
a smaller number

1512
00:28:30,389 --> 00:28:30,399
a smaller number
 

1513
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,470
a smaller number
you know like two numbers and then it is

1514
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:32,480
you know like two numbers and then it is
 

1515
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,789
you know like two numbers and then it is
people get it right you keep going

1516
00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:34,799
people get it right you keep going
 

1517
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,630
people get it right you keep going
adding to the string of numbers until

1518
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:36,640
adding to the string of numbers until
 

1519
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,470
adding to the string of numbers until
they can't do it anymore

1520
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:38,480
they can't do it anymore
 

1521
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,549
they can't do it anymore
okay but now try this

1522
00:28:40,549 --> 00:28:40,559
okay but now try this
 

1523
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,549
okay but now try this
i'm going to re i'm going to say some

1524
00:28:42,549 --> 00:28:42,559
i'm going to re i'm going to say some
 

1525
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,230
i'm going to re i'm going to say some
numbers and when i'm done i want you to

1526
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:44,240
numbers and when i'm done i want you to
 

1527
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,470
numbers and when i'm done i want you to
repeat them to me backwards

1528
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:46,480
repeat them to me backwards
 

1529
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,590
repeat them to me backwards
i quit

1530
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:47,600
i quit
 

1531
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,710
i quit
okay

1532
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:48,720
okay
 

1533
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,590
okay
now

1534
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:49,600
now
 

1535
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,909
now
so i gave you some examples of the kind

1536
00:28:51,909 --> 00:28:51,919
so i gave you some examples of the kind
 

1537
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,149
so i gave you some examples of the kind
of items on an iq test general

1538
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:54,159
of items on an iq test general
 

1539
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:56,070
of items on an iq test general
information

1540
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:56,080
information
 

1541
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,630
information
um i can't even remember all

1542
00:28:58,630 --> 00:28:58,640
um i can't even remember all
 

1543
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,590
um i can't even remember all
general information vocabulary

1544
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:01,600
general information vocabulary
 

1545
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,190
general information vocabulary
digits span forward and digit span

1546
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:05,200
digits span forward and digit span
 

1547
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,630
digits span forward and digit span
backward

1548
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:06,640
backward
 

1549
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,789
backward
well you said i can't even remember that

1550
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:08,799
well you said i can't even remember that
 

1551
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,789
well you said i can't even remember that
that's a good question for me

1552
00:29:10,789 --> 00:29:10,799
that's a good question for me
 

1553
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,510
that's a good question for me
uh what does memory have to do with you

1554
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:13,520
uh what does memory have to do with you
 

1555
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,029
uh what does memory have to do with you
well that's all that's that's all that's

1556
00:29:15,029 --> 00:29:15,039
well that's all that's that's all that's
 

1557
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,430
well that's all that's that's all that's
okay all right so let's let's let's just

1558
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:17,440
okay all right so let's let's let's just
 

1559
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,950
okay all right so let's let's let's just
talk about these

1560
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:18,960
talk about these
 

1561
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,110
talk about these
examples now

1562
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:21,120
examples now
 

1563
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,389
examples now
some of those

1564
00:29:22,389 --> 00:29:22,399
some of those
 

1565
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:23,830
some of those
items

1566
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:23,840
items
 

1567
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,710
items
seem very cultural

1568
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:26,720
seem very cultural
 

1569
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,909
seem very cultural
and

1570
00:29:27,909 --> 00:29:27,919
and
 

1571
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,909
and
others seem less cultural

1572
00:29:31,909 --> 00:29:31,919

 

1573
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,750

which ones do you think

1574
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:33,760
which ones do you think
 

1575
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,230
which ones do you think
scores on which subtest are most highly

1576
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:36,240
scores on which subtest are most highly
 

1577
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,430
scores on which subtest are most highly
correlated with the g factor

1578
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:39,440
correlated with the g factor
 

1579
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,510
correlated with the g factor
well the d2 advances less cultural

1580
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:43,520
well the d2 advances less cultural
 

1581
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,110
well the d2 advances less cultural
well

1582
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:45,120
well
 

1583
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,230
well
it turns out vocabulary is highly

1584
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:48,240
it turns out vocabulary is highly
 

1585
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,750
it turns out vocabulary is highly
correlated

1586
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:49,760
correlated
 

1587
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,870
correlated
and it turns out that digits span

1588
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:52,880
and it turns out that digits span
 

1589
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,950
and it turns out that digits span
backwards is highly correlated

1590
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:56,960
backwards is highly correlated
 

1591
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,190
backwards is highly correlated
how do you how do you figure now you

1592
00:29:59,190 --> 00:29:59,200
how do you how do you figure now you
 

1593
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,470
how do you how do you figure now you
have

1594
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:00,480
have
 

1595
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,789
have
decades of research to answer the

1596
00:30:02,789 --> 00:30:02,799
decades of research to answer the
 

1597
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,470
decades of research to answer the
question how do you figure

1598
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:04,480
question how do you figure
 

1599
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,750
question how do you figure
right so no now there's like good

1600
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:07,760
right so no now there's like good
 

1601
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,669
right so no now there's like good
research that gives you intuition about

1602
00:30:09,669 --> 00:30:09,679
research that gives you intuition about
 

1603
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,990
research that gives you intuition about
what kind of questions get at it just

1604
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:12,000
what kind of questions get at it just
 

1605
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,269
what kind of questions get at it just
like uh

1606
00:30:15,269 --> 00:30:15,279

 

1607
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:16,549

there's something

1608
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:16,559
there's something
 

1609
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:17,990
there's something
i've done

1610
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:18,000
i've done
 

1611
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,389
i've done
i've actually used for research to send

1612
00:30:20,389 --> 00:30:20,399
i've actually used for research to send
 

1613
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,870
i've actually used for research to send
me a autonomous vehicle like whether

1614
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:22,880
me a autonomous vehicle like whether
 

1615
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,710
me a autonomous vehicle like whether
humans are paying attention there's a

1616
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:24,720
humans are paying attention there's a
 

1617
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,750
humans are paying attention there's a
body of literature that does like end

1618
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:27,760
body of literature that does like end
 

1619
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,230
body of literature that does like end
back tests for example we have to

1620
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:30,240
back tests for example we have to
 

1621
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,350
back tests for example we have to
um

1622
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:33,360

 

1623
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,389

put workload on the brain to do recall

1624
00:30:36,389 --> 00:30:36,399
put workload on the brain to do recall
 

1625
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:40,149
put workload on the brain to do recall
memory recall and that helps you kind of

1626
00:30:40,149 --> 00:30:40,159
memory recall and that helps you kind of
 

1627
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,470
memory recall and that helps you kind of
put some work onto the brain while the

1628
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:42,480
put some work onto the brain while the
 

1629
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,230
put some work onto the brain while the
person is doing some other tasks and

1630
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:44,240
person is doing some other tasks and
 

1631
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,310
person is doing some other tasks and
this does some interesting research with

1632
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:46,320
this does some interesting research with
 

1633
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,510
this does some interesting research with
that

1634
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:47,520
that
 

1635
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,190
that
but that's loading the memory so there's

1636
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:49,200
but that's loading the memory so there's
 

1637
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,950
but that's loading the memory so there's
like research around

1638
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:50,960
like research around
 

1639
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,230
like research around
stably

1640
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:52,240
stably
 

1641
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,149
stably
what that means about the human mind and

1642
00:30:54,149 --> 00:30:54,159
what that means about the human mind and
 

1643
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:58,310
what that means about the human mind and
here you're saying recall backwards

1644
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:58,320
here you're saying recall backwards
 

1645
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,669
here you're saying recall backwards
is a good predictor the transformation

1646
00:31:01,669 --> 00:31:01,679
is a good predictor the transformation
 

1647
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,430
is a good predictor the transformation
yeah so you have to so you have to do

1648
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:03,440
yeah so you have to so you have to do
 

1649
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,950
yeah so you have to so you have to do
some

1650
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:04,960
some
 

1651
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,710
some
some like you have to load that into

1652
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:06,720
some like you have to load that into
 

1653
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,590
some like you have to load that into
your brain and not just remember it but

1654
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:09,600
your brain and not just remember it but
 

1655
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,750
your brain and not just remember it but
do something with it right here's

1656
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:11,760
do something with it right here's
 

1657
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,509
do something with it right here's
another example of a different kind of

1658
00:31:13,509 --> 00:31:13,519
another example of a different kind of
 

1659
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,470
another example of a different kind of
test called the hick paradigm and it's

1660
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:16,480
test called the hick paradigm and it's
 

1661
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,990
test called the hick paradigm and it's
not verbal at all it's a little box

1662
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:20,000
not verbal at all it's a little box
 

1663
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,029
not verbal at all it's a little box
and there are a series of lights

1664
00:31:23,029 --> 00:31:23,039
and there are a series of lights
 

1665
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,669
and there are a series of lights
arranged in a semi-circle at the top of

1666
00:31:25,669 --> 00:31:25,679
arranged in a semi-circle at the top of
 

1667
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,269
arranged in a semi-circle at the top of
the box

1668
00:31:27,269 --> 00:31:27,279
the box
 

1669
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,909
the box
and then there's a home button that you

1670
00:31:29,909 --> 00:31:29,919
and then there's a home button that you
 

1671
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,110
and then there's a home button that you
press

1672
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:31,120
press
 

1673
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,549
press
and when one of the lights goes on

1674
00:31:34,549 --> 00:31:34,559
and when one of the lights goes on
 

1675
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,710
and when one of the lights goes on
there's a button next to each of those

1676
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:36,720
there's a button next to each of those
 

1677
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,669
there's a button next to each of those
lights

1678
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:37,679
lights
 

1679
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,830
lights
you take your finger off the home button

1680
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:39,840
you take your finger off the home button
 

1681
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,350
you take your finger off the home button
and you just press

1682
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:41,360
and you just press
 

1683
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,110
and you just press
the button next to the light that goes

1684
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:43,120
the button next to the light that goes
 

1685
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:43,909
the button next to the light that goes
on

1686
00:31:43,909 --> 00:31:43,919
on
 

1687
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,389
on
and so it's a very simple reaction time

1688
00:31:46,389 --> 00:31:46,399
and so it's a very simple reaction time
 

1689
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,070
and so it's a very simple reaction time
light goes on as quick as you can you

1690
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:48,080
light goes on as quick as you can you
 

1691
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,990
light goes on as quick as you can you
press the button and you get a reaction

1692
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:50,000
press the button and you get a reaction
 

1693
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,830
press the button and you get a reaction
time from the moment you lift your

1694
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:51,840
time from the moment you lift your
 

1695
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,750
time from the moment you lift your
finger off the button

1696
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:53,760
finger off the button
 

1697
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,430
finger off the button
when you press

1698
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:55,440
when you press
 

1699
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,549
when you press
the button with where the light is

1700
00:31:58,549 --> 00:31:58,559
the button with where the light is
 

1701
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,710
the button with where the light is
that reaction time

1702
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:00,720
that reaction time
 

1703
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,110
that reaction time
doesn't really correlate with iq very

1704
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:03,120
doesn't really correlate with iq very
 

1705
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,070
doesn't really correlate with iq very
much

1706
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:04,080
much
 

1707
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,830
much
but if you change

1708
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:05,840
but if you change
 

1709
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,509
but if you change
the instructions

1710
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:07,519
the instructions
 

1711
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,110
the instructions
and you say

1712
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:09,120
and you say
 

1713
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,269
and you say
three lights are going to come on

1714
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:11,279
three lights are going to come on
 

1715
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:12,950
three lights are going to come on
simultaneously

1716
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:12,960
simultaneously
 

1717
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,950
simultaneously
i want you to press the button next to

1718
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:14,960
i want you to press the button next to
 

1719
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,190
i want you to press the button next to
the light that's furthest from the other

1720
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:17,200
the light that's furthest from the other
 

1721
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,789
the light that's furthest from the other
two

1722
00:32:18,789 --> 00:32:18,799
two
 

1723
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:21,509
two
so maybe lights one and two go on and

1724
00:32:21,509 --> 00:32:21,519
so maybe lights one and two go on and
 

1725
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,630
so maybe lights one and two go on and
and light six goes on simultaneously you

1726
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:24,640
and light six goes on simultaneously you
 

1727
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,990
and light six goes on simultaneously you
take your finger off and you would press

1728
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:26,000
take your finger off and you would press
 

1729
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,710
take your finger off and you would press
the button by light six

1730
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:28,720
the button by light six
 

1731
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,750
the button by light six
that's

1732
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:29,760
that's
 

1733
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,870
that's
that reaction time to a more complex

1734
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:32,880
that reaction time to a more complex
 

1735
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,070
that reaction time to a more complex
task

1736
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:34,080
task
 

1737
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,149
task
it's not really hard

1738
00:32:36,149 --> 00:32:36,159
it's not really hard
 

1739
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,310
it's not really hard
almost everybody gets it all right but

1740
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:38,320
almost everybody gets it all right but
 

1741
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,669
almost everybody gets it all right but
the your reaction time to that is highly

1742
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:41,679
the your reaction time to that is highly
 

1743
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,070
the your reaction time to that is highly
correlated with the g factor this is

1744
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:44,080
correlated with the g factor this is
 

1745
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,149
correlated with the g factor this is
fascinating so reaction time so there's

1746
00:32:46,149 --> 00:32:46,159
fascinating so reaction time so there's
 

1747
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:47,509
fascinating so reaction time so there's
a temporal

1748
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:47,519
a temporal
 

1749
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,070
a temporal
aspect to this so it's what what role

1750
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:50,080
aspect to this so it's what what role
 

1751
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,029
aspect to this so it's what what role
crossing it's the speed of processing is

1752
00:32:53,029 --> 00:32:53,039
crossing it's the speed of processing is
 

1753
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,509
crossing it's the speed of processing is
this also true for ones that take longer

1754
00:32:55,509 --> 00:32:55,519
this also true for ones that take longer
 

1755
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:58,549
this also true for ones that take longer
like 5 10 30 seconds

1756
00:32:58,549 --> 00:32:58,559
like 5 10 30 seconds
 

1757
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,789
like 5 10 30 seconds
is time part of the measure with

1758
00:33:00,789 --> 00:33:00,799
is time part of the measure with
 

1759
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,950
is time part of the measure with
something yes yes and that is why some

1760
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:02,960
something yes yes and that is why some
 

1761
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,509
something yes yes and that is why some
of the best iq tests

1762
00:33:05,509 --> 00:33:05,519
of the best iq tests
 

1763
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,750
of the best iq tests
have a time limit

1764
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:07,760
have a time limit
 

1765
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,470
have a time limit
because if you have no time limit

1766
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:10,480
because if you have no time limit
 

1767
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,750
because if you have no time limit
people can do better yeah but it doesn't

1768
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:13,760
people can do better yeah but it doesn't
 

1769
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,310
people can do better yeah but it doesn't
it doesn't distinguish among people

1770
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:16,320
it doesn't distinguish among people
 

1771
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,669
it doesn't distinguish among people
that well

1772
00:33:17,669 --> 00:33:17,679
that well
 

1773
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:18,950
that well
so that

1774
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:18,960
so that
 

1775
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,669
so that
adding the time element is important so

1776
00:33:21,669 --> 00:33:21,679
adding the time element is important so
 

1777
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,389
adding the time element is important so

00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,710
speed of information processing
turn and reaction time is a measure of

00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,149
speed of information processing turns
out to be related to the g factor but

1784
00:33:32,149 --> 00:33:32,159
out to be related to the g factor but
 

1785
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,470
out to be related to the g factor but
the g factor only accounts for maybe

1786
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:34,480
the g factor only accounts for maybe
 

1787
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,870
the g factor only accounts for maybe
half or some amount on the test

1788
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:36,880
half or some amount on the test
 

1789
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,029
half or some amount on the test
performance for example i get

1790
00:33:39,029 --> 00:33:39,039
performance for example i get
 

1791
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:39,909
performance for example i get
a

00:33:39,909 --> 00:33:39,919
a
 

1793
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,669
a
pretty bad test anxiety like i was never

1794
00:33:43,669 --> 00:33:43,679
pretty bad test anxiety like i was never
 

1795
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,149
pretty bad test anxiety like i was never
i mean

1796
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:46,159

 

1797
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,389

i just don't enjoy tests i enjoy going

1798
00:33:48,389 --> 00:33:48,399
i just don't enjoy tests i enjoy going
 

1799
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:50,470
i just don't enjoy tests i enjoy going
back into my cave

1800
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:50,480
back into my cave
 

1801
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,230
back into my cave
and working like i've always enjoyed

1802
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:52,240
and working like i've always enjoyed
 

1803
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,430
and working like i've always enjoyed
homework

1804
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:53,440
homework
 

1805
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,430
homework
way more than tests

1806
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:55,440
way more than tests
 

1807
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,590
way more than tests
uh no matter how hard the homework is

1808
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:57,600
uh no matter how hard the homework is
 

1809
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,269
uh no matter how hard the homework is
because i can go back to the cave and

1810
00:33:59,269 --> 00:33:59,279
because i can go back to the cave and
 

1811
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,789
because i can go back to the cave and
hide away and think deeply there's

1812
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:00,799
hide away and think deeply there's
 

1813
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,950
hide away and think deeply there's
something about being watched and having

1814
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:02,960
something about being watched and having
 

1815
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,350
something about being watched and having
a time limit that really makes me

1816
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:05,360
a time limit that really makes me
 

1817
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,830
a time limit that really makes me
anxious and i could just see the mind

1818
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:07,840
anxious and i could just see the mind
 

1819
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,230
anxious and i could just see the mind
not operating optimally at all but

1820
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:10,240
not operating optimally at all but
 

1821
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,829
not operating optimally at all but
you're saying underneath there there's

1822
00:34:11,829 --> 00:34:11,839
you're saying underneath there there's
 

1823
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:15,270
you're saying underneath there there's
still a g factor there's the question

1824
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:15,280
still a g factor there's the question
 

1825
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,310
still a g factor there's the question
no question

1826
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:16,320
no question
 

1827
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,109
no question
boy

1828
00:34:17,109 --> 00:34:17,119
boy
 

1829
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:19,109
boy
and if you get anxious taking a test

1830
00:34:19,109 --> 00:34:19,119
and if you get anxious taking a test
 

1831
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,710
and if you get anxious taking a test
many people say oh i didn't do well

1832
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:20,720
many people say oh i didn't do well
 

1833
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,710
many people say oh i didn't do well
because i'm anxious yeah

1834
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:22,720
because i'm anxious yeah
 

1835
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,109
because i'm anxious yeah
you know i hear that a lot yeah well

1836
00:34:25,109 --> 00:34:25,119
you know i hear that a lot yeah well
 

1837
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,190
you know i hear that a lot yeah well
fine if you're really anxious during the

1838
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:27,200
fine if you're really anxious during the
 

1839
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,310
fine if you're really anxious during the
test

1840
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:28,320
test
 

1841
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,790
test
the score will be a bad estimate of your

1842
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:30,800
the score will be a bad estimate of your
 

1843
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,710
the score will be a bad estimate of your
g factor yeah it doesn't mean the g

1844
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:32,720
g factor yeah it doesn't mean the g
 

1845
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,270
g factor yeah it doesn't mean the g
factor isn't there that's right and by

1846
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:35,280
factor isn't there that's right and by
 

1847
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,629
factor isn't there that's right and by
the way

1848
00:34:36,629 --> 00:34:36,639
the way
 

1849
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,389
the way
standardized tests like the sat

1850
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:40,399
standardized tests like the sat
 

1851
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,869
standardized tests like the sat
they're essentially intelligence tests

1852
00:34:42,869 --> 00:34:42,879
they're essentially intelligence tests
 

1853
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:46,069
they're essentially intelligence tests
they are highly g-loaded now the the

1854
00:34:46,069 --> 00:34:46,079
they are highly g-loaded now the the
 

1855
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,230
they are highly g-loaded now the the
people who make the s.a.t don't want to

1856
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:48,240
people who make the s.a.t don't want to
 

1857
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,669
people who make the s.a.t don't want to
mention that

1858
00:34:49,669 --> 00:34:49,679
mention that
 

1859
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,669
mention that
for obviously they have enough trouble

1860
00:34:51,669 --> 00:34:51,679
for obviously they have enough trouble
 

1861
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,149
for obviously they have enough trouble
justifying standardized testing but to

1862
00:34:54,149 --> 00:34:54,159
justifying standardized testing but to
 

1863
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,030
justifying standardized testing but to
call it an intelligence test is really

1864
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:57,040
call it an intelligence test is really
 

1865
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,190
call it an intelligence test is really
beyond the pale but in fact it's so

1866
00:34:59,190 --> 00:34:59,200
beyond the pale but in fact it's so
 

1867
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,750
beyond the pale but in fact it's so
highly correlated because it's a

1868
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:01,760
highly correlated because it's a
 

1869
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,109
highly correlated because it's a
reasoning test

1870
00:35:03,109 --> 00:35:03,119
reasoning test
 

1871
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,109
reasoning test
sat is a reasoning test a verbal

1872
00:35:05,109 --> 00:35:05,119
sat is a reasoning test a verbal
 

1873
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:08,069
sat is a reasoning test a verbal
reasoning mathematical reasoning yeah

1874
00:35:08,069 --> 00:35:08,079
reasoning mathematical reasoning yeah
 

1875
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:10,470
reasoning mathematical reasoning yeah
and if it's a reasoning test it has to

1876
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:10,480
and if it's a reasoning test it has to
 

1877
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,390
and if it's a reasoning test it has to
be related

1878
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:12,400
be related
 

1879
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,510
be related
to to g but if people

1880
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:15,520
to to g but if people
 

1881
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,349
to to g but if people
go in and take a standardized test

1882
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:17,359
go in and take a standardized test
 

1883
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:20,230
go in and take a standardized test
whether it's an iq test or the sat and

1884
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:20,240
whether it's an iq test or the sat and
 

1885
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,190
whether it's an iq test or the sat and
they happen to be sick that day with 102

1886
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:23,200
they happen to be sick that day with 102
 

1887
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,470
they happen to be sick that day with 102
fever

1888
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:24,480
fever
 

1889
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,910
fever
the score

1890
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:25,920
the score
 

1891
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,470
the score
is not going to be a good estimate of

1892
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:28,480
is not going to be a good estimate of
 

1893
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,589
is not going to be a good estimate of
their g if they retake the test when

1894
00:35:31,589 --> 00:35:31,599
their g if they retake the test when
 

1895
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,230
their g if they retake the test when
they're not anxious or less anxious or

1896
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:34,240
they're not anxious or less anxious or
 

1897
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,470
they're not anxious or less anxious or
don't have a fever

1898
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:36,480
don't have a fever
 

1899
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,470
don't have a fever
the score will go up and that will be a

1900
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:38,480
the score will go up and that will be a
 

1901
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,349
the score will go up and that will be a
better estimate but you can't say their

1902
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:41,359
better estimate but you can't say their
 

1903
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:45,030
better estimate but you can't say their
g factor increased between the two tests

1904
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:45,040
g factor increased between the two tests
 

1905
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,589
g factor increased between the two tests
well it's interesting so the question is

1906
00:35:47,589 --> 00:35:47,599
well it's interesting so the question is
 

1907
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,069
well it's interesting so the question is
how wide of a battery of tests is

1908
00:35:50,069 --> 00:35:50,079
how wide of a battery of tests is
 

1909
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,190
how wide of a battery of tests is
required to estimate the g factor well

1910
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:53,200
required to estimate the g factor well
 

1911
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,710
required to estimate the g factor well
because i'll give you as my personal

1912
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:54,720
because i'll give you as my personal
 

1913
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,550
because i'll give you as my personal
example i took the sat

1914
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:56,560
example i took the sat
 

1915
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,790
example i took the sat
and i think it was called the act where

1916
00:35:58,790 --> 00:35:58,800
and i think it was called the act where
 

1917
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,710
and i think it was called the act where
i was too also i took sat many times

1918
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:02,720
i was too also i took sat many times
 

1919
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,349
i was too also i took sat many times
every single time i got perfect on math

1920
00:36:05,349 --> 00:36:05,359
every single time i got perfect on math
 

1921
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,270
every single time i got perfect on math
and verbal

1922
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:07,280
and verbal
 

1923
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,109
and verbal
the time limit on the verbal made me

1924
00:36:09,109 --> 00:36:09,119
the time limit on the verbal made me
 

1925
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,790
the time limit on the verbal made me
very anxious

1926
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:10,800
very anxious
 

1927
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,630
very anxious
i did not i mean part of it i didn't

1928
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:12,640
i did not i mean part of it i didn't
 

1929
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,150
i did not i mean part of it i didn't
speak english very well

1930
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:14,160
speak english very well
 

1931
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,150
speak english very well
but honestly it was like you're supposed

1932
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:16,160
but honestly it was like you're supposed
 

1933
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,230
but honestly it was like you're supposed
to remember stuff and like i was so

1934
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:18,240
to remember stuff and like i was so
 

1935
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,910
to remember stuff and like i was so
anxious and like as i'm reading i'm

1936
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:19,920
anxious and like as i'm reading i'm
 

1937
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,910
anxious and like as i'm reading i'm
sweating i can't you know that like um

1938
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:23,920
sweating i can't you know that like um
 

1939
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,150
sweating i can't you know that like um
that feeling you have when you're

1940
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:26,160
that feeling you have when you're
 

1941
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,829
that feeling you have when you're
reading a book and you

1942
00:36:27,829 --> 00:36:27,839
reading a book and you
 

1943
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:29,589
reading a book and you
you just read a page and you know

1944
00:36:29,589 --> 00:36:29,599
you just read a page and you know
 

1945
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,270
you just read a page and you know
nothing about what you've read because

1946
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:31,280
nothing about what you've read because
 

1947
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,069
nothing about what you've read because
you zoned out that's the same feeling of

1948
00:36:34,069 --> 00:36:34,079
you zoned out that's the same feeling of
 

1949
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:34,870
you zoned out that's the same feeling of
like

1950
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:34,880
like
 

1951
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,069
like
i can't i have to you're like nope

1952
00:36:38,069 --> 00:36:38,079
i can't i have to you're like nope
 

1953
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,550
i can't i have to you're like nope
read and understand and that anxieties

1954
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:40,560
read and understand and that anxieties
 

1955
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,069
read and understand and that anxieties
like

1956
00:36:42,069 --> 00:36:42,079
like
 

1957
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:44,790
like
and you start seeing like the typography

1958
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:44,800
and you start seeing like the typography
 

1959
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,190
and you start seeing like the typography
versus the content of the words like

1960
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:47,200
versus the content of the words like
 

1961
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,470
versus the content of the words like
that was

1962
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:48,480
that was
 

1963
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,510
that was
i i don't it's interesting because

1964
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:51,520
i i don't it's interesting because
 

1965
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,870
i i don't it's interesting because
um

1966
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:52,880
um
 

1967
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,710
um
i know that

1968
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:54,720
i know that
 

1969
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,550
i know that
what they're measuring i could see being

1970
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:56,560
what they're measuring i could see being
 

1971
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,670
what they're measuring i could see being
correlated with something but that

1972
00:36:59,670 --> 00:36:59,680
correlated with something but that
 

1973
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,910
correlated with something but that
anxiety or some aspect of the

um

1978
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:04,720
um
 

1979
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,750
um

00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:09,920
i wonder how you sneak up in a stable
 

1983
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,750
i wonder how you sneak up in a stable
way i mean this is a broader discussion

1984
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:11,760
way i mean this is a broader discussion
 

1985
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,710
way i mean this is a broader discussion
about

1986
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:12,720
about
 

1987
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,109
about
that's like uh standardized testing how

1988
00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:15,119
that's like uh standardized testing how
 

1989
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,470
that's like uh standardized testing how
you sneak up

1990
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:16,480
you sneak up
 

1991
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,069
you sneak up
how you get

1992
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:18,079
how you get
 

1993
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,910
how you get
at the fact that i'm super anxious and

1994
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:19,920
at the fact that i'm super anxious and
 

1995
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,150
at the fact that i'm super anxious and
still nevertheless measure some aspect

still nevertheless measure some aspect
 

1997
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,390
still nevertheless measure some aspect
of my intelligence i wonder i don't i

1998
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:24,400
of my intelligence i wonder i don't i
 

1999
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,750
of my intelligence i wonder i don't i
don't know i don't know if you can say

2000
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:25,760
don't know i don't know if you can say
 

2001
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,750
don't know i don't know if you can say
it to that that time limit sure is a

2002
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:27,760
it to that that time limit sure is a
 

2003
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,470
it to that that time limit sure is a
pain

2004
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:28,480
pain
 

2005
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,470
pain
well let me say this

2006
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:30,480
well let me say this
 

2007
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,470
well let me say this
there are two ways to approach

2008
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:32,480
there are two ways to approach
 

2009
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,870
there are two ways to approach
the very real problem that you say that

2010
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:34,880
the very real problem that you say that
 

2011
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,510
the very real problem that you say that
some people just get anxious or not good

2012
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:37,520
some people just get anxious or not good
 

2013
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,790
some people just get anxious or not good
test takers

2014
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:38,800
test takers
 

2015
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,470
test takers
by the way

2016
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:40,480
by the way
 

2017
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,230
by the way
part of

2018
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:42,240
part of
 

2019
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,230
part of
part of testing is

2020
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:44,240
part of testing is
 

2021
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,390
part of testing is
you know the answer you can figure out

2022
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:46,400
you know the answer you can figure out
 

2023
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,829

the answer or you can't
right if you don't know the answer there

2026
00:37:51,589 --> 00:37:51,599
right if you don't know the answer there
 

2027
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,510
right if you don't know the answer there
are many reasons you don't know the

2028
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:53,520
are many reasons you don't know the
 

2029
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,430
are many reasons you don't know the
answer at that particular moment you may

answer at that particular moment you may
 

2031
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,310
answer at that particular moment you may
have learned it once and forgotten it

you're anxious about the time limit you
 

2039
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,750
you're anxious about the time limit you
may never have learned it

to make a decision and i think people

to make a decision and i think people
 

2073
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,670
to make a decision and i think people
are a college admission is letting go of

are a college admission is letting go of
 

2075
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,829
are a college admission is letting go of
that very much oh yes there yeah but

2076
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:49,839
that very much oh yes there yeah but
 

2077
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:52,310
that very much oh yes there yeah but
what does that even mean because um

2078
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:52,320
what does that even mean because um
 

2079
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,230
what does that even mean because um
is it possible to design standardized

2080
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:54,240
is it possible to design standardized
 

2081
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,430
is it possible to design standardized
tests

2082
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:55,440
tests
 

2083
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,670
tests
that do get that are useful to college

2084
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:57,680
that do get that are useful to college
 

2085
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,670
that do get that are useful to college
admissions well they already exist the

2086
00:38:59,670 --> 00:38:59,680
admissions well they already exist the
 

2087
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,030
admissions well they already exist the
sat is highly correlated with many

2088
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:03,040
sat is highly correlated with many
 

2089
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,430
sat is highly correlated with many
aspects of success at college here's the

2090
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:05,440
aspects of success at college here's the
 

2091
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,030
aspects of success at college here's the
problem so maybe you could speak to this

2092
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:09,040
problem so maybe you could speak to this
 

2093
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,030
problem so maybe you could speak to this
the correlation across the population

2094
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:11,040
the correlation across the population
 

2095
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,270
the correlation across the population
versus individuals

2096
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:13,280
versus individuals
 

2097
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,030
versus individuals
so

2098
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:17,040

 

2099
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,710

you know our criminal justice system is

2100
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:18,720
you know our criminal justice system is
 

2101
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,150
you know our criminal justice system is
designed

2102
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:20,160
designed
 

2103
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,230
designed
to make sure

2104
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:22,240
to make sure
 

2105
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,270
to make sure
uh

2106
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:23,280
uh
 

2107
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,550
uh
well

2108
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:24,560
well
 

2109
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,710
well
it's it's it's still there's tragic

2110
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:26,720
it's it's it's still there's tragic
 

2111
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,190
it's it's it's still there's tragic
cases where innocent people go go go to

2112
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:29,200
cases where innocent people go go go to
 

2113
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,430
cases where innocent people go go go to
jail but you try to avoid that in the

2114
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:31,440
jail but you try to avoid that in the
 

2115
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,230
jail but you try to avoid that in the
same

2116
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:32,240
same
 

2117
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,349
same
uh way with testing it just

2118
00:39:35,349 --> 00:39:35,359
uh way with testing it just
 

2119
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:38,630
uh way with testing it just
it would suck for an sat to miss genius

2120
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:38,640
it would suck for an sat to miss genius
 

2121
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,109
it would suck for an sat to miss genius
yes and it it's possible but it's

2122
00:39:41,109 --> 00:39:41,119
yes and it it's possible but it's
 

2123
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:44,069
yes and it it's possible but it's
statistically unlikely so the so it

2124
00:39:44,069 --> 00:39:44,079
statistically unlikely so the so it
 

2125
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,230
statistically unlikely so the so it
really comes down to

2126
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:46,240
really comes down to
 

2127
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,870
really comes down to
yeah do which

2128
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:48,880
yeah do which
 

2129
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,990
yeah do which
piece of information

2130
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:52,000
piece of information
 

2131
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,589
piece of information
maximizes

2132
00:39:53,589 --> 00:39:53,599
maximizes
 

2133
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,950
maximizes
your

2134
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:54,960
your
 

2135
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,550
your
decision making ability

2136
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:58,560
decision making ability
 

2137
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,630
decision making ability
so

2138
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:00,640
so
 

2139
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,030
so
if you just use high school grades

2140
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:03,040
if you just use high school grades
 

2141
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,109
if you just use high school grades
it's okay

2142
00:40:05,109 --> 00:40:05,119
it's okay
 

2143
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:07,670
it's okay
but you will miss some people who just

2144
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:07,680
but you will miss some people who just
 

2145
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,510
but you will miss some people who just
don't do well in high school but who are

2146
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:09,520
don't do well in high school but who are
 

2147
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,390
don't do well in high school but who are
actually

2148
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:10,400
actually
 

2149
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,470
actually
pretty smart smart enough to be bored

2150
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:12,480
pretty smart smart enough to be bored
 

2151
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,790
pretty smart smart enough to be bored
silly in high school and they don't care

2152
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:14,800
silly in high school and they don't care
 

2153
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,870
silly in high school and they don't care
and they their high school gpa isn't

2154
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:16,880
and they their high school gpa isn't
 

2155
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,430
and they their high school gpa isn't
that good so you will miss them

2156
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:19,440
that good so you will miss them
 

2157
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,190
that good so you will miss them
in the same sense

2158
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:21,200
in the same sense
 

2159
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,270
in the same sense
that somebody who could be

2160
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:23,280
that somebody who could be
 

2161
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,390
that somebody who could be
very

2162
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:24,400
very
 

2163
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,390
very
able and ready for college just doesn't

2164
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:26,400
able and ready for college just doesn't
 

2165
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,069
able and ready for college just doesn't
do well on their s.a.t this is why

2166
00:40:30,069 --> 00:40:30,079
do well on their s.a.t this is why
 

2167
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:32,790
do well on their s.a.t this is why
you make decisions with of

2168
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:32,800
you make decisions with of
 

2169
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,910
you make decisions with of
taking in a variety of in information

2170
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:35,920
taking in a variety of in information
 

2171
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,910
taking in a variety of in information
the other thing i wanted to say

2172
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:39,920

 

2173
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,829

you know we talked about when you make a

2174
00:40:41,829 --> 00:40:41,839
you know we talked about when you make a
 

2175
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,829
you know we talked about when you make a
decision for an individual

2176
00:40:43,829 --> 00:40:43,839
decision for an individual
 

2177
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:45,349
decision for an individual
statistically

2178
00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:45,359
statistically
 

2179
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,470
statistically
for groups there are many people

2180
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:48,480
for groups there are many people
 

2181
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,950
for groups there are many people
who have a disparity between their math

2182
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:50,960
who have a disparity between their math
 

2183
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,190
who have a disparity between their math
score and their verbal score that

2184
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:53,200
score and their verbal score that
 

2185
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,750
score and their verbal score that
disparity or the other way around that

2186
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:55,760
disparity or the other way around that
 

2187
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,470
disparity or the other way around that
disparity is called tilt

2188
00:40:58,470 --> 00:40:58,480
disparity is called tilt
 

2189
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,750
disparity is called tilt
the score is tilted one way or the other

2190
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:01,760
the score is tilted one way or the other
 

2191
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,150
the score is tilted one way or the other
and that tilt has been studied

2192
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:04,160
and that tilt has been studied
 

2193
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,109
and that tilt has been studied
empirically to see what that predicts

2194
00:41:07,109 --> 00:41:07,119
empirically to see what that predicts
 

2195
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,270
empirically to see what that predicts
and in fact you can't make predictions

2196
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:09,280
and in fact you can't make predictions
 

2197
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,309
and in fact you can't make predictions
about

2198
00:41:10,309 --> 00:41:10,319
about
 

2199
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:12,710
about
about college success

2200
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:12,720
about college success
 

2201
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,990
about college success
uh based on on tilt and mathematics is a

2202
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:16,000
uh based on on tilt and mathematics is a
 

2203
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,150
uh based on on tilt and mathematics is a
good example there are many people

2204
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:18,160
good example there are many people
 

2205
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,150
good example there are many people
especially non-native speakers of

2206
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:20,160
especially non-native speakers of
 

2207
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,390
especially non-native speakers of
english who come to this country take

2208
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:22,400
english who come to this country take
 

2209
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,870
english who come to this country take
the sats do very well on the math and

2210
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:24,880
the sats do very well on the math and
 

2211
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,710
the sats do very well on the math and
not so well on the verbal

2212
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:26,720
not so well on the verbal
 

2213
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,349
not so well on the verbal
well if they're applying to a math

2214
00:41:29,349 --> 00:41:29,359
well if they're applying to a math
 

2215
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,030
well if they're applying to a math
program

2216
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:31,040
program
 

2217
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,190
program
the professors there who are making the

2218
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:33,200
the professors there who are making the
 

2219
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,390
the professors there who are making the
decision or the admissions officers

2220
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:36,400
decision or the admissions officers
 

2221
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,430
decision or the admissions officers
don't wait so much to score on verbal

2222
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:39,440
don't wait so much to score on verbal
 

2223
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,910
don't wait so much to score on verbal
especially if it's a non-native speaker

2224
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:41,920
especially if it's a non-native speaker
 

2225
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,750
especially if it's a non-native speaker
well so yeah you have to

2226
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:43,760
well so yeah you have to
 

2227
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,990
well so yeah you have to
try to in the admission process bring in

2228
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:46,000
try to in the admission process bring in
 

2229
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,589
try to in the admission process bring in
the context

2230
00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:47,599
the context
 

2231
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:50,630
the context
but non-native isn't really the problem

2232
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:50,640
but non-native isn't really the problem
 

2233
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,390
but non-native isn't really the problem
i mean that was part of the problem for

2234
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:52,400
i mean that was part of the problem for
 

2235
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,670
i mean that was part of the problem for
me

2236
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:53,680
me
 

2237
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,630
me
but it's the the anxiety was which it's

2238
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:56,640
but it's the the anxiety was which it's
 

2239
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,829
but it's the the anxiety was which it's
interesting

2240
00:41:57,829 --> 00:41:57,839
interesting
 

2241
00:41:57,839 --> 00:41:59,430
interesting
it's interesting

2242
00:41:59,430 --> 00:41:59,440
it's interesting
 

2243
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,630
it's interesting
um

2244
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:02,640

 

2245
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,390

oh boy reducing yourself down to numbers

2246
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:06,400
oh boy reducing yourself down to numbers
 

2247
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,030
oh boy reducing yourself down to numbers
but it's still true it's still the truth

2248
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:09,040
but it's still true it's still the truth
 

2249
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,109
but it's still true it's still the truth
well it's a it's a painful that same

2250
00:42:11,109 --> 00:42:11,119
well it's a it's a painful that same
 

2251
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:14,829
well it's a it's a painful that same
anxiety that led me to be

2252
00:42:14,829 --> 00:42:14,839

 

2253
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:18,710

um to struggle with the sat uh

2254
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:18,720
um to struggle with the sat uh
 

2255
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,470
um to struggle with the sat uh
verbal tests

2256
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:20,480
verbal tests
 

2257
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,550
verbal tests
is still within within me

2258
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:22,560
is still within within me
 

2259
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,470
is still within within me
in all ways of life

2260
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:24,480
in all ways of life
 

2261
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,710
in all ways of life
so maybe that's not anxiety

2262
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:26,720
so maybe that's not anxiety
 

2263
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,270
so maybe that's not anxiety
maybe that's something um you know like

2264
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:29,280
maybe that's something um you know like
 

2265
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,470
maybe that's something um you know like
personality

2266
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:30,480
personality
 

2267
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,230
personality
is also pretty stable

2268
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:32,240
is also pretty stable
 

2269
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,390
is also pretty stable
personality is stable

2270
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:34,400
personality is stable
 

2271
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,910
personality is stable
personality uh does impact

2272
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:37,920
personality uh does impact
 

2273
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,870
personality uh does impact
the way you navigate life yeah uh

2274
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:40,880
the way you navigate life yeah uh
 

2275
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,390
the way you navigate life yeah uh
there's no question

2276
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:42,400
there's no question
 

2277
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,710
there's no question
yeah and and we should say that g factor

2278
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:44,720
yeah and and we should say that g factor
 

2279
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,630
yeah and and we should say that g factor
in intelligence is not just about some

2280
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:46,640
in intelligence is not just about some
 

2281
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,750
in intelligence is not just about some
kind of

2282
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:47,760
kind of
 

2283
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,710
kind of
um

2284
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:48,720
um
 

2285
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,309
um
number on a paper

2286
00:42:50,309 --> 00:42:50,319
number on a paper
 

2287
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:52,470
number on a paper
it also has to do with

2288
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:52,480
it also has to do with
 

2289
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,710
it also has to do with
how you navigate life

2290
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:54,720
how you navigate life
 

2291
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,510
how you navigate life
how

2292
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:55,520
how
 

2293
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,030
how
um

2294
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:57,040
um
 

2295
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,870
um
easy life is for you

2296
00:42:58,870 --> 00:42:58,880
easy life is for you
 

2297
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,950
easy life is for you
in this very complicated world so

2298
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:00,960
in this very complicated world so
 

2299
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,870
in this very complicated world so
personality is all tied into that in

2300
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:02,880
personality is all tied into that in
 

2301
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,750
personality is all tied into that in
some in some some deep fundamental way

2302
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:05,760
some in some some deep fundamental way
 

2303
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,990
some in some some deep fundamental way
but now you've hit the key point about

2304
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:08,000
but now you've hit the key point about
 

2305
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,190
but now you've hit the key point about
why we even want to study intelligence

2306
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:11,200
why we even want to study intelligence
 

2307
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,870
why we even want to study intelligence

tests of intelligence
 

2599
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:42,790

what do we do with that
 

2639
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,710
what do we do with that
okay there's a lot there

2640
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:26,720
okay there's a lot there
 

2641
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,150
okay there's a lot there
we haven't really talked about the

2642
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:28,160
we haven't really talked about the
 

2643
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:31,190
we haven't really talked about the
genetics of it yet but you are

2644
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:31,200
genetics of it yet but you are
 

2645
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,790
genetics of it yet but you are
correct uh

2646
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:32,800
correct uh
 

2647
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,589
correct uh
in that it is my interpretation of of

2648
00:49:35,589 --> 00:49:35,599
in that it is my interpretation of of
 

2649
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:36,790
in that it is my interpretation of of
the data

2650
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:36,800
the data
 

2651
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,870
the data
that genetics has a very important

2652
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:38,880
that genetics has a very important
 

2653
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,910
that genetics has a very important
influence on the g factor and this is

2654
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:41,920
influence on the g factor and this is
 

2655
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,870
influence on the g factor and this is
controversial we can talk about it but

2656
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:44,880
controversial we can talk about it but
 

2657
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,589
controversial we can talk about it but
if you think that genetics the genes are

2658
00:49:47,589 --> 00:49:47,599
if you think that genetics the genes are
 

2659
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:50,630
if you think that genetics the genes are
deterministic are always deterministic

2660
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:50,640
deterministic are always deterministic
 

2661
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,030
deterministic are always deterministic
that leads to kind of the worry that you

2662
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:53,040
that leads to kind of the worry that you
 

2663
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,109
that leads to kind of the worry that you
expressed

2664
00:49:55,109 --> 00:49:55,119
expressed
 

2665
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:56,630
expressed
but we know

2666
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:56,640
but we know
 

2667
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,430
but we know
now in the 21st century that many genes

2668
00:49:59,430 --> 00:49:59,440
now in the 21st century that many genes
 

2669
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,109
now in the 21st century that many genes
are not deterministic that are

2670
00:50:01,109 --> 00:50:01,119
are not deterministic that are
 

2671
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:02,630
are not deterministic that are
probabilistic

2672
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:02,640
probabilistic
 

2673
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:03,829
probabilistic
meaning they

2674
00:50:03,829 --> 00:50:03,839
meaning they
 

2675
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:05,670
meaning they
their their uh

2676
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:05,680
their their uh
 

2677
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,510
their their uh
gene expression can be

2678
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:07,520
gene expression can be
 

2679
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,190
gene expression can be
uh influenced

2680
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:09,200
uh influenced
 

2681
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,190
uh influenced
uh now whether they're influenced only

2682
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:11,200
uh now whether they're influenced only
 

2683
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,910
uh now whether they're influenced only
by other biological variables

2684
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:13,920
by other biological variables
 

2685
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,510
by other biological variables
or other genetic

2686
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:15,520
or other genetic
 

2687
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,150

2689
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,790

variables that's where the controversy

2690
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:20,800
variables that's where the controversy
 

2691
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,870
variables that's where the controversy
comes in

2692
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:22,880
comes in
 

2693
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,790
comes in
and we can come we can discuss that in

2694
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:24,800
and we can come we can discuss that in
 

2695
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,910
and we can come we can discuss that in
more detail if you like but to go to the

2696
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:27,920
more detail if you like but to go to the
 

2697
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,990
more detail if you like but to go to the
question about better

2698
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:30,000
question about better
 

2699
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,510
question about better
people better

2700
00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:31,520
people better
 

2701
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,230
people better
there's zero evidence

2702
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:34,240
there's zero evidence
 

2703
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,270
there's zero evidence
that

2704
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:35,280
that
 

2705
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,790
that
smart people

2706
00:50:36,790 --> 00:50:36,800
smart people
 

2707
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,470
smart people
are better

2708
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:38,480
are better
 

2709
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,710
are better
with respect to

2710
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:40,720
with respect to
 

2711
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,190
with respect to
important aspects of life

2712
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:43,200
important aspects of life
 

2713
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,349
important aspects of life
like honesty

2714
00:50:45,349 --> 00:50:45,359
like honesty
 

2715
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:47,829
like honesty
even likability

2716
00:50:47,829 --> 00:50:47,839
even likability
 

2717
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:49,910
even likability
i'm sure you know many very intelligent

2718
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:49,920
i'm sure you know many very intelligent
 

2719
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,069
i'm sure you know many very intelligent
people who are not terribly likable or

2720
00:50:52,069 --> 00:50:52,079
people who are not terribly likable or
 

2721
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:55,349
people who are not terribly likable or
terribly kind or terribly honest

2722
00:50:55,349 --> 00:50:55,359
terribly kind or terribly honest
 

2723
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,589
terribly kind or terribly honest
is there something to be said so one of

2724
00:50:57,589 --> 00:50:57,599
is there something to be said so one of
 

2725
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:59,990
is there something to be said so one of
the things i've recently re-read for the

2726
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:00,000
the things i've recently re-read for the
 

2727
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,829
the things i've recently re-read for the
second time

2728
00:51:01,829 --> 00:51:01,839
second time
 

2729
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:03,750
second time
i guess that's what the word reread

2730
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:03,760
i guess that's what the word reread
 

2731
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,150
i guess that's what the word reread
means

2732
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:06,160

 

2733
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,790

the rise and fall of the third reich uh

2734
00:51:08,790 --> 00:51:08,800
the rise and fall of the third reich uh
 

2735
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:09,990
the rise and fall of the third reich uh
which is

2736
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:10,000
which is
 

2737
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,790
which is
i think the best telling of the rise and

2738
00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:12,800
i think the best telling of the rise and
 

2739
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,549
i think the best telling of the rise and
fall of hitler

2740
00:51:14,549 --> 00:51:14,559
fall of hitler
 

2741
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:17,109
fall of hitler
and one of the interesting things about

2742
00:51:17,109 --> 00:51:17,119
and one of the interesting things about
 

2743
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,349
and one of the interesting things about
the people that

2744
00:51:19,349 --> 00:51:19,359
the people that
 

2745
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:20,710
the people that
uh

2746
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:20,720
uh
 

2747
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:24,230
uh
how should i say it

2748
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:24,240

 

2749
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:27,270

um

2750
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:27,280

 

2751
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,270

justified

2752
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:29,280
justified
 

2753
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,390
justified
or maybe propped up the ideas that

2754
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:32,400
or maybe propped up the ideas that
 

2755
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,630
or maybe propped up the ideas that
hitler put forward

2756
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:34,640
hitler put forward
 

2757
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,870
hitler put forward
is the fact that they were extremely

2758
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:36,880
is the fact that they were extremely
 

2759
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,230
is the fact that they were extremely
intelligent

2760
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:38,240
intelligent
 

2761
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:41,589
intelligent
they were in the intellectual class

2762
00:51:41,589 --> 00:51:41,599
they were in the intellectual class
 

2763
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:42,790
they were in the intellectual class
they were

2764
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:42,800
they were
 

2765
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,750
they were
like it was obvious that they they

2766
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:45,760
like it was obvious that they they
 

2767
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,390
like it was obvious that they they
thought very deeply and rationally about

2768
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:48,400
thought very deeply and rationally about
 

2769
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,430
thought very deeply and rationally about
the world so what i would like to say is

2770
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:51,440
the world so what i would like to say is
 

2771
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,309
the world so what i would like to say is
one of the things that shows to me is

2772
00:51:54,309 --> 00:51:54,319
one of the things that shows to me is
 

2773
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,150
one of the things that shows to me is
some of the worst atrocities in the

2774
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:56,160
some of the worst atrocities in the
 

2775
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,710
some of the worst atrocities in the
history of humanity have been committed

2776
00:51:58,710 --> 00:51:58,720
history of humanity have been committed
 

2777
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:01,990
history of humanity have been committed
by very intelligent people

2778
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:02,000
by very intelligent people
 

2779
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,470
by very intelligent people
so that that means that intelligence

2780
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:04,480
so that that means that intelligence
 

2781
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,790
so that that means that intelligence
doesn't make you a good person i wonder

2782
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:06,800
doesn't make you a good person i wonder
 

2783
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:07,910
doesn't make you a good person i wonder
if

2784
00:52:07,910 --> 00:52:07,920
if
 

2785
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,349
if
um

2786
00:52:09,349 --> 00:52:09,359
um
 

2787
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:11,589
um
you know there's a g factor for

2788
00:52:11,589 --> 00:52:11,599
you know there's a g factor for
 

2789
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:13,750
you know there's a g factor for
intelligence i wonder if there's a g

2790
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:13,760
intelligence i wonder if there's a g
 

2791
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,829
intelligence i wonder if there's a g
factor for goodness

2792
00:52:15,829 --> 00:52:15,839
factor for goodness
 

2793
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:19,109
factor for goodness
uh you know the niche uh good and evil

2794
00:52:19,109 --> 00:52:19,119
uh you know the niche uh good and evil
 

2795
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:20,549
uh you know the niche uh good and evil
of course that's probably harder to

2796
00:52:20,549 --> 00:52:20,559
of course that's probably harder to
 

2797
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:21,510
of course that's probably harder to
measure

2798
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:21,520
measure
 

2799
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,109
measure
because that's such a subjective thing

2800
00:52:23,109 --> 00:52:23,119
because that's such a subjective thing
 

2801
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:25,190
because that's such a subjective thing
what it means to be good

2802
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:25,200
what it means to be good
 

2803
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,750
what it means to be good
and even the idea of evil is

2804
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:27,760
and even the idea of evil is
 

2805
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,750
and even the idea of evil is
a deeply uncomfortable thing because how

2806
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:29,760
a deeply uncomfortable thing because how
 

2807
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,190
a deeply uncomfortable thing because how
do we know

2808
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:31,200
do we know
 

2809
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,069
do we know
but it's independent whatever it is it's

2810
00:52:34,069 --> 00:52:34,079
but it's independent whatever it is it's
 

2811
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:36,710
but it's independent whatever it is it's
independent of intelligence so i i agree

2812
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:36,720
independent of intelligence so i i agree
 

2813
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,190
independent of intelligence so i i agree
with you about that but let me say this

2814
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:39,200
with you about that but let me say this
 

2815
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,030
with you about that but let me say this
i have also

2816
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:41,040
i have also
 

2817
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,390
i have also
asserted

2818
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:42,400
asserted
 

2819
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,990
asserted
my belief

2820
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:44,000
my belief
 

2821
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,470
my belief
that more intelligence is better than

2822
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:46,480
that more intelligence is better than
 

2823
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,109
that more intelligence is better than
less

2824
00:52:49,109 --> 00:52:49,119

 

2825
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:51,349

that doesn't mean more

2826
00:52:51,349 --> 00:52:51,359
that doesn't mean more
 

2827
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:54,230
that doesn't mean more
intelligent people are better people

2828
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:54,240
intelligent people are better people
 

2829
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,069
intelligent people are better people
but all things being equal would you

2830
00:52:56,069 --> 00:52:56,079
but all things being equal would you
 

2831
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:59,109
but all things being equal would you
like to be smarter or less smart so if i

2832
00:52:59,109 --> 00:52:59,119
like to be smarter or less smart so if i
 

2833
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:01,750
like to be smarter or less smart so if i
had a pill i have two pills i said this

2834
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:01,760
had a pill i have two pills i said this
 

2835
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,190
had a pill i have two pills i said this
one will make you smarter this one will

2836
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:03,200
one will make you smarter this one will
 

2837
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:06,230
one will make you smarter this one will
make you dumber which one would you like

2838
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:06,240
make you dumber which one would you like
 

2839
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,230
make you dumber which one would you like
are there any circumstances under which

2840
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:08,240
are there any circumstances under which
 

2841
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,990
are there any circumstances under which
you would choose to be dumber well let

2842
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:10,000
you would choose to be dumber well let
 

2843
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,430
you would choose to be dumber well let
me ask you this

2844
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:11,440
me ask you this
 

2845
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,190
me ask you this
that's a very nuanced and interesting

2846
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:13,200
that's a very nuanced and interesting
 

2847
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,430
that's a very nuanced and interesting
question

2848
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:15,440
question
 

2849
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,950
question
you know there's been books written

2850
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:16,960
you know there's been books written
 

2851
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,870
you know there's been books written
about this right

2852
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:18,880
about this right
 

2853
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,030
about this right
um now we'll return to the hard

2854
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:21,040
um now we'll return to the hard
 

2855
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,710
um now we'll return to the hard
questions the interesting questions but

2856
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:22,720
questions the interesting questions but
 

2857
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:25,750
questions the interesting questions but
let me ask about human happiness

2858
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:25,760
let me ask about human happiness
 

2859
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:26,829
let me ask about human happiness
this

2860
00:53:26,829 --> 00:53:26,839
this
 

2861
00:53:26,839 --> 00:53:31,750
this
intelligence lead to happiness no

2862
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:31,760

 

2863
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,870

so so okay so back to the pill then

2864
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:34,880
so so okay so back to the pill then
 

2865
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,030
so so okay so back to the pill then
so why

2866
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:37,040
so why
 

2867
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,109
so why
uh when would you take the pill so you

2868
00:53:39,109 --> 00:53:39,119
uh when would you take the pill so you
 

2869
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:41,589
uh when would you take the pill so you
said iq 80

2870
00:53:41,589 --> 00:53:41,599
said iq 80
 

2871
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:44,069
said iq 80
90 100

2872
00:53:44,069 --> 00:53:44,079
90 100
 

2873
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:47,910
90 100
110 you start going to the quartiles and

2874
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:47,920
110 you start going to the quartiles and
 

2875
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,309
110 you start going to the quartiles and
um is it obvious

2876
00:53:50,309 --> 00:53:50,319
um is it obvious
 

2877
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:53,030
um is it obvious
isn't there uh

2878
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:53,040
isn't there uh
 

2879
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,270
isn't there uh
diminishing returns and then it starts

2880
00:53:55,270 --> 00:53:55,280
diminishing returns and then it starts
 

2881
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,270
diminishing returns and then it starts
becoming negative

2882
00:53:57,270 --> 00:53:57,280
becoming negative
 

2883
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,750
becoming negative
this is an empirical question

2884
00:53:59,750 --> 00:53:59,760
this is an empirical question
 

2885
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:04,309
this is an empirical question
yes and so that i have advocated

2886
00:54:04,309 --> 00:54:04,319
yes and so that i have advocated
 

2887
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:06,150
yes and so that i have advocated

enhancing the g factor
 

2895
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,109
enhancing the g factor
right now there's

2896
00:54:13,109 --> 00:54:13,119
right now there's
 

2897
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:14,549
right now there's
there have been many claims about

2898
00:54:14,549 --> 00:54:14,559
there have been many claims about
 

2899
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:16,870
there have been many claims about
enhancing intelligence

2900
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:16,880
enhancing intelligence
 

2901
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,950
enhancing intelligence
with you mentioned the n-back training

2902
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:18,960
with you mentioned the n-back training
 

2903
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,270
with you mentioned the n-back training
it was a big deal a few years ago it

2904
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:21,280
it was a big deal a few years ago it
 

2905
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,630
it was a big deal a few years ago it
doesn't work

2906
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:22,640
doesn't work
 

2907
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:25,270
doesn't work
data is very clear it does not work

2908
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:25,280
data is very clear it does not work
 

2909
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,349
data is very clear it does not work
you know or doing like memory tests like

2910
00:54:27,349 --> 00:54:27,359
you know or doing like memory tests like
 

2911
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:29,589
you know or doing like memory tests like
training and so on yeah yeah it makes it

2912
00:54:29,589 --> 00:54:29,599
training and so on yeah yeah it makes it
 

2913
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,349
training and so on yeah yeah it makes it
may give you a better memory in the

2914
00:54:31,349 --> 00:54:31,359
may give you a better memory in the
 

2915
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:32,549
may give you a better memory in the
short run

2916
00:54:32,549 --> 00:54:32,559
short run
 

2917
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:34,470
short run
but it doesn't impact your

2918
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:34,480
but it doesn't impact your
 

2919
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,829
but it doesn't impact your
g factor

2920
00:54:36,829 --> 00:54:36,839
g factor
 

2921
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:39,910
g factor
um it was very popular a couple of

2922
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:39,920
um it was very popular a couple of
 

2923
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,670
um it was very popular a couple of
decades ago that

2924
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:41,680
decades ago that
 

2925
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:44,470
decades ago that
the idea that listening to mozart

2926
00:54:44,470 --> 00:54:44,480
the idea that listening to mozart
 

2927
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,549
the idea that listening to mozart
could make you more intelligent there

2928
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:46,559
could make you more intelligent there
 

2929
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:48,230
could make you more intelligent there
was a paper published on this with

2930
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:48,240
was a paper published on this with

many many social problems
 

2975
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,109
many many social problems
that are exacerbated

2976
00:55:43,109 --> 00:55:43,119
that are exacerbated
 

2977
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:44,230
that are exacerbated
by people

2978
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:44,240
by people
 

2979
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,829
by people
with lower

00:55:45,829 --> 00:55:45,839
with lower
 

2981
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:48,549
with lower
ability to reason stuff out

2982
00:55:48,549 --> 00:55:48,559
ability to reason stuff out
 

2983
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:51,589

so i wonder if there's a threshold so

2986
00:55:53,829 --> 00:55:53,839
so i wonder if there's a threshold so
 

2987
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:54,950
so i wonder if there's a threshold so
maybe

2988
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:54,960
maybe
 

2989
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,109
maybe
i would push back and say

2990
00:55:57,109 --> 00:55:57,119
i would push back and say
 

2991
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:59,270
i would push back and say
universal shifting

2992
00:55:59,270 --> 00:55:59,280
universal shifting
 

2993
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,549
universal shifting
of the

2994
00:56:00,549 --> 00:56:00,559
of the
 

2995
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:02,870
of the
normal distribution may not be the

2996
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:02,880
normal distribution may not be the
 

2997
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,950
normal distribution may not be the
optimal way of shifting

2998
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:04,960
optimal way of shifting
 

2999
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:08,230
optimal way of shifting
maybe it's better to uh whatever the

3000
00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:08,240
maybe it's better to uh whatever the
 

3001
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,549
maybe it's better to uh whatever the
asymmetric tank kind of distributions is

3002
00:56:10,549 --> 00:56:10,559
asymmetric tank kind of distributions is
 

3003
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:13,349
asymmetric tank kind of distributions is
like really pushing the lower up

3004
00:56:13,349 --> 00:56:13,359
like really pushing the lower up
 

3005
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:16,710
like really pushing the lower up
versus uh trying to make the

3006
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:16,720
versus uh trying to make the
 

3007
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,870
versus uh trying to make the
uh people at the average more

3008
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:18,880
uh people at the average more
 

3009
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,630
uh people at the average more
intelligent so you're saying that if in

00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:20,640
intelligent so you're saying that if in
 

3011
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:23,349

let's just call it metaphorically a pill

00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:25,920
let's just call it metaphorically a pill
 

3015
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,589
let's just call it metaphorically a pill
an iq pill

an iq pill
 

3017
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:29,270
an iq pill
we should only give it to people at the

we should only give it to people at the
 

3019
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,470
we should only give it to people at the

no it's just intuitively

no it's just intuitively

the lower end yes if it's increased

3026
00:56:39,589 --> 00:56:39,599
the lower end yes if it's increased
 

3027
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:42,150

it becomes less and less it is an

it becomes less and less it is an
 

3029
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,230
it becomes less and less it is an

empirical scientific question but it

00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:47,109

to good for for that to improve society

so
at that whatever problems you're working

at that whatever problems you're working

but there's also the problem of the

solving problems you're going to create
more problems for yourself it's uh

well yes that's how lawyers work but i
 

3137
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:33,990
well yes that's how lawyers work but i
would love for science to answer the

3138
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:34,000
would love for science to answer the
 

3139
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,030
would love for science to answer the
question

3140
00:58:35,030 --> 00:58:35,040
question
 

3141
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,789
question
to try to predict if your life is going

3142
00:58:36,789 --> 00:58:36,799
to try to predict if your life is going
 

3143
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:38,549
to try to predict if your life is going
to be better or worse

3144
00:58:38,549 --> 00:58:38,559
to be better or worse
 

3145
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:40,549
to be better or worse
when you become more uh more or less

3146
00:58:40,549 --> 00:58:40,559
when you become more uh more or less
 

3147
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:42,309
when you become more uh more or less
intelligent it's a it's a fascinating

3148
00:58:42,309 --> 00:58:42,319
intelligent it's a it's a fascinating
 

3149
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:44,549
intelligent it's a it's a fascinating
question about what is the sweet spot

3150
00:58:44,549 --> 00:58:44,559
question about what is the sweet spot
 

3151
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:47,190
question about what is the sweet spot
for the human condition

3152
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:47,200
for the human condition
 

3153
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,190
for the human condition
uh some of the things we see as

3154
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:49,200
uh some of the things we see as
 

3155
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,710
uh some of the things we see as
bugs might be

3156
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:50,720
bugs might be
 

3157
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:53,910
bugs might be
actually features maybe crucial to our

3158
00:58:53,910 --> 00:58:53,920
actually features maybe crucial to our
 

3159
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:56,309
actually features maybe crucial to our
uh overall happiness is our limitations

3160
00:58:56,309 --> 00:58:56,319
uh overall happiness is our limitations
 

3161
00:58:56,319 --> 00:58:58,950
uh overall happiness is our limitations
might lead to more happiness than less

3162
00:58:58,950 --> 00:58:58,960
might lead to more happiness than less
 

3163
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:01,750
might lead to more happiness than less
but again more intelligence is better at

3164
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:01,760
but again more intelligence is better at
 

3165
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:04,309
but again more intelligence is better at
the lower end that's more that's as

3166
00:59:04,309 --> 00:59:04,319
the lower end that's more that's as
 

3167
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:06,309
the lower end that's more that's as
that's something that's less arguable

3168
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:06,319
that's something that's less arguable
 

3169
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:07,190
that's something that's less arguable
and

3170
00:59:07,190 --> 00:59:07,200
and
 

3171
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,190
and
and and fascinating if possible to

00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:09,200
and and fascinating if possible to
 

3173
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,190
and and fascinating if possible to
increase but you know there's virtually

3174
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:11,200
increase but you know there's virtually

01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:33,280
it's a fascinating story really that
 

3245
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,990
it's a fascinating story really that
goes in contrast to the the basic human

3246
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:36,000
goes in contrast to the the basic human
 

3247
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,589
goes in contrast to the the basic human
experience that each of us individually

3248

experience that each of us individually
 

3249
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:40,230
experience that each of us individually
have but it raises the question of

01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:13,109
he said not only
have these efforts failed but because

3638
01:08:13,109 --> 01:08:13,119
have these efforts failed but because
 

3639
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:15,990
have these efforts failed but because
they have had essentially no impact we

3640
01:08:15,990 --> 01:08:16,000
they have had essentially no impact we
 

3641
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,550
they have had essentially no impact we
have to re-examine our assumption that

3642
01:08:18,550 --> 01:08:18,560
have to re-examine our assumption that
 

3643
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,630
have to re-examine our assumption that
these differences are caused by

3644
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:20,640
these differences are caused by
 

3645
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:22,950
these differences are caused by
environmental things that we can address

3646
01:08:22,950 --> 01:08:22,960
environmental things that we can address
 

3647
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:26,789
environmental things that we can address
with education we need to consider

3648
01:08:26,789 --> 01:08:26,799
with education we need to consider
 

3649
01:08:26,799 --> 01:08:29,269
with education we need to consider
a genetic influence whether there's a

3650
01:08:29,269 --> 01:08:29,279
a genetic influence whether there's a
 

3651
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:31,430
a genetic influence whether there's a
genetic influence on this group

3652
01:08:31,430 --> 01:08:31,440
genetic influence on this group
 

3653
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,430
genetic influence on this group
difference so you said that this is one

3654
01:08:33,430 --> 01:08:33,440
difference so you said that this is one
 

3655
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:35,269
difference so you said that this is one
of the more controversial

3656
01:08:35,269 --> 01:08:35,279
of the more controversial
 

3657
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:37,910
of the more controversial
works i think the most infamous paper in

so
 

3787

so
as a matter of fact when the bell curve

3788
01:11:05,990 --> 01:11:06,000
as a matter of fact when the bell curve
 

3789
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,870
as a matter of fact when the bell curve
came out it was so controversial i got a

3790
01:11:08,870 --> 01:11:08,880
came out it was so controversial i got a
 

3791

was on late at night talked about news
it was a straight up news thing yeah and

3802
01:11:24,790 --> 01:11:24,800
it was a straight up news thing yeah and
 

3803
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:27,270
it was a straight up news thing yeah and
producer called and asked if i would be

3804
01:11:27,270 --> 01:11:27,280
producer called and asked if i would be
 

3805
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:30,310
producer called and asked if i would be
on it to talk about the uh the bell

3806
01:11:30,310 --> 01:11:30,320
on it to talk about the uh the bell
 

3807
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:31,510
on it to talk about the uh the bell
curve

3808
01:11:31,510 --> 01:11:31,520
curve
 

3809
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,590
curve
and i said you know it it

3810
01:11:33,590 --> 01:11:33,600
and i said you know it it
 

3811
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,270
and i said you know it it
she asked me what i thought about the

3812
01:11:35,270 --> 01:11:35,280
she asked me what i thought about the
 

3813
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:37,430
she asked me what i thought about the
bell curve as a book i said look it's a

3814
01:11:37,430 --> 01:11:37,440
bell curve as a book i said look it's a
 

3815
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:39,669
bell curve as a book i said look it's a
very good book it talks about the role

3816
01:11:39,669 --> 01:11:39,679
very good book it talks about the role
 

3817
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:43,030
very good book it talks about the role
of intelligence in society

3818
01:11:43,030 --> 01:11:43,040
of intelligence in society
 

3819
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:44,870
of intelligence in society
and she said no no what do you think

3820
01:11:44,870 --> 01:11:44,880
and she said no no what do you think
 

3821
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:47,590
and she said no no what do you think
about the chapter on race that's what we

3822
01:11:47,590 --> 01:11:47,600
about the chapter on race that's what we
 

3823
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:49,750
about the chapter on race that's what we
want you to talk about

3824
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:49,760
want you to talk about
 

3825
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:52,229
want you to talk about
i remember this conversation

3826
01:11:52,229 --> 01:11:52,239
i remember this conversation
 

3827
01:11:52,239 --> 01:11:55,189
i remember this conversation
i said well

3828
01:11:55,189 --> 01:11:55,199
i said well
 

3829
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:57,030
i said well
she said what would you say if you were

3830
01:11:57,030 --> 01:11:57,040
she said what would you say if you were
 

3831
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:58,630
she said what would you say if you were
on tv

3832
01:11:58,630 --> 01:11:58,640
on tv
 

3833
01:11:58,640 --> 01:11:59,990
on tv
and i said well

3834
01:11:59,990 --> 01:12:00,000
and i said well
 

3835
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,590
and i said well
what i would say is that it's not at all

3836
01:12:03,590 --> 01:12:03,600
what i would say is that it's not at all
 

3837
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:07,590
what i would say is that it's not at all
clear if there's any genetic component

3838
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:07,600
clear if there's any genetic component
 

3839
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:10,709
clear if there's any genetic component
to intelligence

3840
01:12:10,709 --> 01:12:10,719
to intelligence
 

3841
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:11,990
to intelligence
um

3842
01:12:11,990 --> 01:12:12,000
um
 

3843
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,270
um
any differences but if there were a

3844
01:12:15,270 --> 01:12:15,280
any differences but if there were a
 

3845
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:18,149
any differences but if there were a
strong genetic component that would be a

3846
01:12:18,149 --> 01:12:18,159
strong genetic component that would be a
 

3847
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:21,030
strong genetic component that would be a
good thing

3848
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:21,040

 

3849
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:23,350

and you know complete silence on the

3850
01:12:23,350 --> 01:12:23,360
and you know complete silence on the
 

3851
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:25,750
and you know complete silence on the
other end of the phone yeah and she said

3852
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:25,760
other end of the phone yeah and she said
 

3853
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:28,070
other end of the phone yeah and she said
well what do you mean

3854
01:12:28,070 --> 01:12:28,080
well what do you mean
 

3855
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:31,110
well what do you mean
and i said well if it's the more genetic

3856
01:12:31,110 --> 01:12:31,120
and i said well if it's the more genetic
 

3857
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,350
and i said well if it's the more genetic
any difference is the more it's

3858
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:33,360
any difference is the more it's
 

3859
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:34,950
any difference is the more it's
biological

3860
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:34,960
biological
 

3861
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:37,830
biological
and if it's biological we can figure out

3862
01:12:37,830 --> 01:12:37,840
and if it's biological we can figure out
 

3863
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:39,750
and if it's biological we can figure out
how to fix it

3864
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:39,760
how to fix it
 

3865
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:41,910
how to fix it
i see that's interesting she said would

3866
01:12:41,910 --> 01:12:41,920
i see that's interesting she said would
 

3867
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:45,669
i see that's interesting she said would
you say that on television yes i said no

3868
01:12:45,669 --> 01:12:45,679
you say that on television yes i said no
 

3869
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:47,430
you say that on television yes i said no
and so that was the end of that so

3870
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:47,440
and so that was the end of that so
 

3871
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:52,149
and so that was the end of that so
that's for more like uh biology

3872
01:12:52,149 --> 01:12:52,159
that's for more like uh biology
 

3873
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:53,750
that's for more like uh biology
is

3874
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:53,760
is
 

3875
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,590
is
um

3876
01:12:55,590 --> 01:12:55,600
um
 

3877
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:58,149
um
within the reach of science

3878
01:12:58,149 --> 01:12:58,159
within the reach of science
 

3879
01:12:58,159 --> 01:12:59,110
within the reach of science
and

3880
01:12:59,110 --> 01:12:59,120
and
 

3881
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:01,990
and
the environment is a public policy

3882
01:13:01,990 --> 01:13:02,000
the environment is a public policy
 

3883
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,229
the environment is a public policy
social and all those kinds of things

3884
01:13:04,229 --> 01:13:04,239
social and all those kinds of things
 

3885
01:13:04,239 --> 01:13:07,510
social and all those kinds of things
it's it from your perspective whichever

3886
01:13:07,510 --> 01:13:07,520
it's it from your perspective whichever
 

3887
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:08,550
it's it from your perspective whichever
one

3888
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:08,560
one
 

3889
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:10,550
one
you think is more amenable to solutions

3890
01:13:10,550 --> 01:13:10,560
you think is more amenable to solutions
 

3891
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:12,229
you think is more amenable to solutions
in the in the short term is the one that

3892
01:13:12,229 --> 01:13:12,239
in the in the short term is the one that
 

3893
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:13,430
in the in the short term is the one that
excites you

3894
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:13,440
excites you
 

3895
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:14,470
excites you
but

3896
01:13:14,470 --> 01:13:14,480
but
 

3897
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:18,229
but
um you're saying that it's good

3898
01:13:18,229 --> 01:13:18,239
um you're saying that it's good
 

3899
01:13:18,239 --> 01:13:19,990
um you're saying that it's good
uh

3900
01:13:19,990 --> 01:13:20,000
uh
 

3901
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,790
uh
the truth of genetic differences

3902
01:13:22,790 --> 01:13:22,800
the truth of genetic differences
 

3903
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:24,870
the truth of genetic differences
no matter what the

3904
01:13:24,870 --> 01:13:24,880
no matter what the
 

3905
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:27,830
no matter what the
between groups

3906
01:13:27,830 --> 01:13:27,840
between groups
 

3907
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,669
between groups
is is a

01:13:29,669 --> 01:13:29,679
is is a

01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:31,510
is is a

painful
 

3911
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:32,550
painful
harmful

harmful
 

3913
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:35,270
harmful
potentially potentially dangerous thing

3914
01:13:35,270 --> 01:13:35,280
potentially potentially dangerous thing
 

3915
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:37,590
potentially potentially dangerous thing
so let me ask you to this

3916
01:13:37,590 --> 01:13:37,600
so let me ask you to this
 

3917
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:39,189
so let me ask you to this
question whether there's bell curve or

3918
01:13:39,189 --> 01:13:39,199
question whether there's bell curve or
 

3919
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:40,790
question whether there's bell curve or
any research on

3920
01:13:40,790 --> 01:13:40,800
any research on
 

3921
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:44,870
any research on
race differences

3922
01:13:44,870 --> 01:13:44,880

 

3923
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:47,430

can that be used to increase the amount

3924
01:13:47,430 --> 01:13:47,440
can that be used to increase the amount
 

3925
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:49,270
can that be used to increase the amount
of racism in the world

3926
01:13:49,270 --> 01:13:49,280
of racism in the world
 

3927
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:50,950
of racism in the world
can that be used to increase the amount

3928
01:13:50,950 --> 01:13:50,960
can that be used to increase the amount
 

3929
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:53,430
can that be used to increase the amount
of hate in the world do you think about

3930
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:53,440
of hate in the world do you think about
 

3931
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:54,950
of hate in the world do you think about
this kind of stuff i've thought about

3932
01:13:54,950 --> 01:13:54,960
this kind of stuff i've thought about
 

3933
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:57,750
this kind of stuff i've thought about
this a lot not as a scientist but as a

3934
01:13:57,750 --> 01:13:57,760
this a lot not as a scientist but as a
 

3935
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:00,630
this a lot not as a scientist but as a
person

3936
01:14:00,630 --> 01:14:00,640

 

3937
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:01,910

and

3938
01:14:01,910 --> 01:14:01,920
and
 

3939
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:03,669
and
my sense is

3940
01:14:03,669 --> 01:14:03,679
my sense is
 

3941
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:05,830
my sense is
there is such

3942
01:14:05,830 --> 01:14:05,840
there is such
 

3943
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:07,990
there is such
enormous

3944
01:14:07,990 --> 01:14:08,000
enormous
 

3945
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,750
enormous
reservoirs of hate and racism

3946
01:14:11,750 --> 01:14:11,760
reservoirs of hate and racism
 

3947
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:14,310
reservoirs of hate and racism
that have nothing to do with scientific

3948
01:14:14,310 --> 01:14:14,320
that have nothing to do with scientific
 

3949
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:16,470
that have nothing to do with scientific
knowledge of the data

3950

knowledge of the data
 

3951
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:19,189
knowledge of the data
that speak against that

3952
01:14:19,189 --> 01:14:19,199
that speak against that
 

3953
01:14:19,199 --> 01:14:19,990
that speak against that
that

3954
01:14:19,990 --> 01:14:20,000
that
 

3955
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,669
that
no i don't

3956
01:14:21,669 --> 01:14:21,679
no i don't
 

3957
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:24,229
no i don't
i don't want to give racist groups of

i don't want to give racist groups of

i don't want to give racist groups of
veto power over what scientists study

3960
01:14:27,590 --> 01:14:27,600
veto power over what scientists study
 

3961
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:30,390
veto power over what scientists study
if you think that the differences

3962
01:14:30,390 --> 01:14:30,400
if you think that the differences
 

3963
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:32,390
if you think that the differences
and by the way virtually no one

3964
01:14:32,390 --> 01:14:32,400
and by the way virtually no one
 

3965
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,709
and by the way virtually no one
disagrees that there are differences in

3966
01:14:34,709 --> 01:14:34,719

01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:41,760
other people will come along to
 

4129
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:44,229
other people will come along to
replicate it they will fail and the

4130
01:17:44,229 --> 01:17:44,239
replicate it they will fail and the
 

4131
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:46,870
replicate it they will fail and the
process over time

4132
01:17:46,870 --> 01:17:46,880
process over time
 

4133
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:48,070
process over time
will work

4134
01:17:48,070 --> 01:17:48,080
will work
 

4135
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:50,149
will work
so let me push back on this

4136
01:17:50,149 --> 01:17:50,159
so let me push back on this
 

4137
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:52,790
so let me push back on this
idea

4138
01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:52,800

 

4139
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,630

because psychology to me

4140
01:17:54,630 --> 01:17:54,640
because psychology to me
 

4141
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:57,270
because psychology to me
is full of gray areas

4142
01:17:57,270 --> 01:17:57,280
is full of gray areas
 

4143
01:17:57,280 --> 01:18:01,270
is full of gray areas
and what i've observed about psychology

4144
01:18:01,270 --> 01:18:01,280
and what i've observed about psychology
 

4145
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:03,910
and what i've observed about psychology
even replication crisis aside

4146
01:18:03,910 --> 01:18:03,920
even replication crisis aside
 

4147
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:06,070
even replication crisis aside
is that something about the media

4148
01:18:06,070 --> 01:18:06,080
is that something about the media
 

4149
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:07,830
is that something about the media
something about journalism

4150
01:18:07,830 --> 01:18:07,840
something about journalism
 

4151
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:10,630
something about journalism
something about the the virality of

4152
01:18:10,630 --> 01:18:10,640
something about the the virality of
 

4153
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:13,590
something about the the virality of
ideas in the public sphere

4154
01:18:13,590 --> 01:18:13,600
ideas in the public sphere
 

4155
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:14,470
ideas in the public sphere
they

4156
01:18:14,470 --> 01:18:14,480
they
 

4157
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:15,910
they
misinterpret

4158
01:18:15,910 --> 01:18:15,920
misinterpret
 

4159
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:19,350
misinterpret
they take up things from studies

4160
01:18:19,350 --> 01:18:19,360
they take up things from studies
 

4161
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:22,229
they take up things from studies
willfully or from ignorance misinterpret

4162
01:18:22,229 --> 01:18:22,239
willfully or from ignorance misinterpret
 

4163
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:23,590
willfully or from ignorance misinterpret
findings

4164
01:18:23,590 --> 01:18:23,600
findings
 

4165
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:27,030
findings
and tell narratives around that

4166
01:18:27,030 --> 01:18:27,040
and tell narratives around that
 

4167
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:29,990
and tell narratives around that
i personally believe for me i'm not

4168
01:18:29,990 --> 01:18:30,000
i personally believe for me i'm not
 

4169
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,590
i personally believe for me i'm not
saying that broadly about science but

4170
01:18:31,590 --> 01:18:31,600
saying that broadly about science but
 

4171
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,110
saying that broadly about science but
for me

4172
01:18:33,110 --> 01:18:33,120
for me
 

4173
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:35,990
for me
it's my responsibility to anticipate the

4174
01:18:35,990 --> 01:18:36,000
it's my responsibility to anticipate the
 

4175
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,390
it's my responsibility to anticipate the
ways in which findings will be

4176
01:18:38,390 --> 01:18:38,400
ways in which findings will be
 

4177
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,390
ways in which findings will be
misinterpreted

4178
01:18:40,390 --> 01:18:40,400
misinterpreted
 

4179
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:41,110
misinterpreted
so

4180
01:18:41,110 --> 01:18:41,120
so
 

4181
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:42,630
so
i've had i thought about this a lot

4182
01:18:42,630 --> 01:18:42,640
i've had i thought about this a lot
 

4183
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:43,510
i've had i thought about this a lot
because i

4184
01:18:43,510 --> 01:18:43,520
because i
 

4185
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:45,189
because i
publish papers on

4186
01:18:45,189 --> 01:18:45,199
publish papers on
 

4187
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:48,310
publish papers on
uh semi-autonomous vehicles and

4188
01:18:48,310 --> 01:18:48,320
uh semi-autonomous vehicles and
 

4189
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:49,430
uh semi-autonomous vehicles and
those

4190
01:18:49,430 --> 01:18:49,440
those
 

4191
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:52,790
those
you know cars people dying cars

4192
01:18:52,790 --> 01:18:52,800
you know cars people dying cars
 

4193
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:55,030
you know cars people dying cars
there's people that have written me a

4194
01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:55,040
there's people that have written me a
 

4195
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:57,750
there's people that have written me a
letter saying emails nobody writes

4196
01:18:57,750 --> 01:18:57,760
letter saying emails nobody writes
 

4197
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:59,350
letter saying emails nobody writes
letters i wish they did

4198
01:18:59,350 --> 01:18:59,360
letters i wish they did
 

4199
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:01,990
letters i wish they did
uh that i have blood in my hands because

4200
01:19:01,990 --> 01:19:02,000
uh that i have blood in my hands because
 

4201
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,229
uh that i have blood in my hands because
of things that i would say positive or

4202
01:19:04,229 --> 01:19:04,239
of things that i would say positive or
 

4203
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:06,229
of things that i would say positive or
negative there's consequences in the

4204
01:19:06,229 --> 01:19:06,239
negative there's consequences in the
 

4205
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:07,830
negative there's consequences in the
same way when you're a researcher for

4206
01:19:07,830 --> 01:19:07,840
same way when you're a researcher for
 

4207
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,110
same way when you're a researcher for
intelligence

4208
01:19:09,110 --> 01:19:09,120
intelligence
 

4209
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:11,910
intelligence
i'm sure you might get emails

4210
01:19:11,910 --> 01:19:11,920
i'm sure you might get emails
 

4211
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:12,870
i'm sure you might get emails
or

4212
01:19:12,870 --> 01:19:12,880
or
 

4213
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:14,790
or
at least people might believe that

4214
01:19:14,790 --> 01:19:14,800
at least people might believe that
 

4215
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,870
at least people might believe that
finding your study

4216
01:19:16,870 --> 01:19:16,880
finding your study
 

4217
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:18,630
finding your study
is going to be used by a large number of

4218
01:19:18,630 --> 01:19:18,640
is going to be used by a large number of
 

4219
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:20,310
is going to be used by a large number of
people to increase the amount of hate in

4220
01:19:20,310 --> 01:19:20,320
people to increase the amount of hate in
 

4221
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,470
people to increase the amount of hate in
the world

4222
01:19:22,470 --> 01:19:22,480
the world
 

4223
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:24,790
the world
i think there's some responsibility on

4224
01:19:24,790 --> 01:19:24,800
i think there's some responsibility on
 

4225
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:25,910
i think there's some responsibility on
scientists

4226
01:19:25,910 --> 01:19:25,920
scientists
 

4227
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:27,990
scientists
but for me i think there's a great

4228
01:19:27,990 --> 01:19:28,000
but for me i think there's a great
 

4229
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,390
but for me i think there's a great
responsibility

4230
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:30,400
responsibility
 

4231
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:33,430
responsibility
to anticipate the ways

4232
01:19:33,430 --> 01:19:33,440
to anticipate the ways
 

4233
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:35,350
to anticipate the ways
things will be misinterpreted

4234
01:19:35,350 --> 01:19:35,360
things will be misinterpreted
 

4235
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:37,270
things will be misinterpreted
and there you have to

4236
01:19:37,270 --> 01:19:37,280
and there you have to
 

4237
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:38,950
and there you have to
first of all decide whether you want to

4238
01:19:38,950 --> 01:19:38,960
first of all decide whether you want to
 

4239
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:40,709
first of all decide whether you want to
say a thing at all

4240
01:19:40,709 --> 01:19:40,719
say a thing at all
 

4241
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:42,550
say a thing at all
or do the study at all publish the study

4242
01:19:42,550 --> 01:19:42,560
or do the study at all publish the study
 

4243
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:46,149
or do the study at all publish the study
at all and to the words with which you

4244
01:19:46,149 --> 01:19:46,159
at all and to the words with which you
 

4245
01:19:46,159 --> 01:19:47,750
at all and to the words with which you
explain it

4246
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:47,760
explain it
 

4247
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:48,870
explain it
it's uh

4248
01:19:48,870 --> 01:19:48,880
it's uh
 

4249
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,550

4251
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:53,270
i find this on twitter a lot actually
which is when i when i write a tweet i'm

4252
01:19:53,270 --> 01:19:53,280
which is when i when i write a tweet i'm
 

4253
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:56,229
which is when i when i write a tweet i'm
usually just doing so innocently

4254
01:19:56,229 --> 01:19:56,239
usually just doing so innocently
 

4255
01:19:56,239 --> 01:19:57,030
usually just doing so innocently
i

4256
01:19:57,030 --> 01:19:57,040
i
 

4257
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:57,910
i
i'll

4258
01:19:57,910 --> 01:19:57,920
i'll
 

4259
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:00,229
i'll
i'll i'll write it you know it takes me

4260
01:20:00,229 --> 01:20:00,239
i'll i'll write it you know it takes me
 

4261
01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:01,990
i'll i'll write it you know it takes me
like five seconds to write it or

4262
01:20:01,990 --> 01:20:02,000
like five seconds to write it or
 

4263
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,390
like five seconds to write it or
whatever 30 seconds to write it and then

4264
01:20:04,390 --> 01:20:04,400
whatever 30 seconds to write it and then
 

4265
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,470
whatever 30 seconds to write it and then
i'll think all right i like close my

4266
01:20:06,470 --> 01:20:06,480
i'll think all right i like close my
 

4267
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:07,350
i'll think all right i like close my
eyes

4268
01:20:07,350 --> 01:20:07,360
eyes
 

4269
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:10,470
eyes
open and try to see how will the world

4270
01:20:10,470 --> 01:20:10,480
open and try to see how will the world
 

4271
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:12,390
open and try to see how will the world
interpret this like what are the ways in

4272
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:12,400
interpret this like what are the ways in
 

4273
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,470
interpret this like what are the ways in
which this will be misinterpreted and

4274
01:20:14,470 --> 01:20:14,480
which this will be misinterpreted and
 

4275
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:17,270
which this will be misinterpreted and
i'll sometimes adjust that tweet to see

4276
01:20:17,270 --> 01:20:17,280
i'll sometimes adjust that tweet to see
 

4277
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:20,870
i'll sometimes adjust that tweet to see
like yeah so in my mind it's clear but

4278
01:20:20,870 --> 01:20:20,880
like yeah so in my mind it's clear but
 

4279
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:22,709
like yeah so in my mind it's clear but
that's because it's my mind from which

4280
01:20:22,709 --> 01:20:22,719
that's because it's my mind from which
 

4281
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:24,950
that's because it's my mind from which
this tweet came but you have to think in

4282
01:20:24,950 --> 01:20:24,960
this tweet came but you have to think in
 

4283
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:27,669
this tweet came but you have to think in
a fresh mind that sees this

4284
01:20:27,669 --> 01:20:27,679
a fresh mind that sees this
 

4285
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:30,070
a fresh mind that sees this
uh and it's spread across

4286
01:20:30,070 --> 01:20:30,080
uh and it's spread across
 

4287
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:31,189
uh and it's spread across
a large

4288
01:20:31,189 --> 01:20:31,199
a large
 

4289
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:33,990
a large
number of other minds how will

4290
01:20:33,990 --> 01:20:34,000
number of other minds how will
 

4291
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,390
number of other minds how will
the interpretation morph i mean for a

4292
01:20:36,390 --> 01:20:36,400

differences between groups and make that

4460
01:23:42,709 --> 01:23:42,719
differences between groups and make that
 

4461
01:23:42,719 --> 01:23:47,030
differences between groups and make that
into debate yes and put you in a role of

4462
01:23:47,030 --> 01:23:47,040
into debate yes and put you in a role of
 

4463
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:49,750
into debate yes and put you in a role of
um justifying racism you justify that's

4464
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:49,760
um justifying racism you justify that's
 

4465
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:51,510
um justifying racism you justify that's
what they're asking me to do courses

4466
01:23:51,510 --> 01:23:51,520
what they're asking me to do courses
 

4467
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:54,229
what they're asking me to do courses
like educating about this this field of

4468
01:23:54,229 --> 01:23:54,239
like educating about this this field of
 

4469
01:23:54,239 --> 01:23:55,990
like educating about this this field of
the science of intelligence yeah i i

4470
01:23:55,990 --> 01:23:56,000
the science of intelligence yeah i i
 

4471
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,550
the science of intelligence yeah i i
want to say one more thing before we get

4472
01:23:58,550 --> 01:23:58,560
want to say one more thing before we get
 

4473
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:01,830
want to say one more thing before we get
off the the normal distribution you also

4474
01:24:01,830 --> 01:24:01,840
off the the normal distribution you also
 

4475
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:02,790
off the the normal distribution you also
asked me

4476
01:24:02,790 --> 01:24:02,800
asked me
 

4477
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:06,070
asked me
what is the science after the bell curve

4478
01:24:06,070 --> 01:24:06,080
what is the science after the bell curve
 

4479
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:08,149
what is the science after the bell curve
and the short answer is there's not much

4480
01:24:08,149 --> 01:24:08,159
and the short answer is there's not much
 

4481
01:24:08,159 --> 01:24:11,350
and the short answer is there's not much
new work but whatever work there is

4482
01:24:11,350 --> 01:24:11,360
new work but whatever work there is
 

4483
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:14,390
new work but whatever work there is
supports the idea that there still are

4484
01:24:14,390 --> 01:24:14,400
supports the idea that there still are
 

4485
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:17,510
supports the idea that there still are
group differences it's arguable whether

4486
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:17,520
group differences it's arguable whether
 

4487
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,669
group differences it's arguable whether
those differences have diminished at all

4488
01:24:19,669 --> 01:24:19,679
those differences have diminished at all
 

4489
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:21,669
those differences have diminished at all
or not

4490
01:24:21,669 --> 01:24:21,679
or not
 

4491
01:24:21,679 --> 01:24:25,030
or not
and there is still a major problem in

4492
01:24:25,030 --> 01:24:25,040
and there is still a major problem in
 

4493
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:27,510
and there is still a major problem in
underperformance in for school

4494
01:24:27,510 --> 01:24:27,520
underperformance in for school
 

4495
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,030
underperformance in for school
achievement

4496
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:29,040
achievement
 

4497
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:31,669
achievement
for many uh mis disadvantaged and

4498
01:24:31,669 --> 01:24:31,679
for many uh mis disadvantaged and
 

4499
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:34,709
for many uh mis disadvantaged and
minority students and there's so far is

4500
01:24:34,709 --> 01:24:34,719
minority students and there's so far is
 

4501
01:24:34,719 --> 01:24:36,870
minority students and there's so far is
no way to fix it

4502
01:24:36,870 --> 01:24:36,880
no way to fix it
 

4503
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:39,590
no way to fix it
uh what do we do with this information

4504
01:24:39,590 --> 01:24:39,600
uh what do we do with this information
 

4505
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:42,149
uh what do we do with this information
what uh is this is this now a task now

4506
01:24:42,149 --> 01:24:42,159
what uh is this is this now a task now
 

4507
01:24:42,159 --> 01:24:44,870
what uh is this is this now a task now
we'll talk about the future

4508
01:24:44,870 --> 01:24:44,880
we'll talk about the future
 

4509
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:47,189
we'll talk about the future
uh on the neuroscience and the biology

4510
01:24:47,189 --> 01:24:47,199
uh on the neuroscience and the biology
 

4511
01:24:47,199 --> 01:24:49,910
uh on the neuroscience and the biology
side but in terms of this information as

4512
01:24:49,910 --> 01:24:49,920
side but in terms of this information as
 

4513
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:52,470

political space in the social space what
 

4517
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,229
political space in the social space what
do we do with this information

4518
01:24:56,229 --> 01:24:56,239
do we do with this information
 

4519
01:24:56,239 --> 01:24:58,629
do we do with this information
i've thought a lot about this the first

4520
01:24:58,629 --> 01:24:58,639
i've thought a lot about this the first
 

4521
01:24:58,639 --> 01:24:59,669
i've thought a lot about this the first
step

4522
01:24:59,669 --> 01:24:59,679
step
 

4523
01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:03,189
step
is to have people interested in policy

4524
01:25:03,189 --> 01:25:03,199
is to have people interested in policy
 

4525
01:25:03,199 --> 01:25:06,790
is to have people interested in policy
understand what the data actually show

4526
01:25:06,790 --> 01:25:06,800
understand what the data actually show
 

4527
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:09,750
understand what the data actually show
to pay attention to intelligence data

4528
01:25:09,750 --> 01:25:09,760
to pay attention to intelligence data
 

4529
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:12,310
to pay attention to intelligence data
you can read policy papers about

4530
01:25:12,310 --> 01:25:12,320
you can read policy papers about
 

4531
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:15,750
you can read policy papers about
education and using your word processor

4532
01:25:15,750 --> 01:25:15,760
education and using your word processor
 

4533
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:17,830
education and using your word processor
you can search for the word intelligence

4534
01:25:17,830 --> 01:25:17,840
you can search for the word intelligence
 

4535
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:20,149
you can search for the word intelligence
you can search a twenty thousand word

4536
01:25:20,149 --> 01:25:20,159
you can search a twenty thousand word
 

4537
01:25:20,159 --> 01:25:21,990
you can search a twenty thousand word
document in a second

but the idea that a university professor

this is rather shocking let alone the

01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:37,510
this is rather shocking let alone the
complete absence of intelligence data by

complete absence of intelligence data by
the way let me tell you something about

01:26:39,189 --> 01:26:39,199
the way let me tell you something about
 

4609
01:26:39,199 --> 01:26:41,910
the way let me tell you something about
what the intelligence data show

what the intelligence data show
 

4611
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:45,189
what the intelligence data show
let's take race out of it

4612
01:26:45,189 --> 01:26:45,199
let's take race out of it

01:26:45,199 --> 01:26:46,950
let's take race out of it
uh even though the origins of these

01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:53,760
i'm blocking on the name of the report
 

4621
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:56,149
i'm blocking on the name of the report
the coleman report was a famous report

4622
01:26:56,149 --> 01:26:56,159
the coleman report was a famous report
 

4623
01:26:56,159 --> 01:26:59,110
the coleman report was a famous report
about education and they measured all

4624
01:26:59,110 --> 01:26:59,120
about education and they measured all
 

4625
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:01,830
about education and they measured all
kinds of variables about schools

4626
01:27:01,830 --> 01:27:01,840
kinds of variables about schools
 

4627
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:03,430
kinds of variables about schools
about teachers

4628
01:27:03,430 --> 01:27:03,440
about teachers
 

4629
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:04,950
about teachers
and they looked at

4630
01:27:04,950 --> 01:27:04,960
and they looked at
 

4631
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:08,070
and they looked at
academic achievement as an outcome

4632
01:27:08,070 --> 01:27:08,080
academic achievement as an outcome
 

4633
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:10,070
academic achievement as an outcome
and they found

4634
01:27:10,070 --> 01:27:10,080
and they found
 

4635
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:12,709
and they found
the most predictive variables of

4636
01:27:12,709 --> 01:27:12,719
the most predictive variables of
 

4637
01:27:12,719 --> 01:27:14,070
the most predictive variables of
education

4638
01:27:14,070 --> 01:27:14,080
education
 

4639
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:16,709
education
outcome were the variables the student

4640
01:27:16,709 --> 01:27:16,719
outcome were the variables the student
 

4641
01:27:16,719 --> 01:27:17,590
outcome were the variables the student
brought

4642
01:27:17,590 --> 01:27:17,600
brought
 

4643
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:20,310
brought
with him or her into the school

4644
01:27:20,310 --> 01:27:20,320
with him or her into the school
 

4645
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:23,270
with him or her into the school
essentially their ability

4646
01:27:23,270 --> 01:27:23,280
essentially their ability
 

4647
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:26,470
essentially their ability
and that when you combine the school and

4648
01:27:26,470 --> 01:27:26,480
and that when you combine the school and
 

4649
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:29,350
and that when you combine the school and
the teacher variables together

4650

the teacher variables together
 

4651
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:31,350
the teacher variables together

and school variables together it barely

4658
01:27:38,070 --> 01:27:38,080
and school variables together it barely
 

4659
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:41,590
and school variables together it barely
accounted for 10 of the variants

4660
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:41,600
accounted for 10 of the variants
 

4661
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:44,470
accounted for 10 of the variants
and this has been replicated now

the best research we have
 

4667
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:52,310
the best research we have
shows that school variables and teacher

administration you know who you can ask
 

4691
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:17,990
administration you know who you can ask
you can ask the gates foundation

4692

you can ask the gates foundation
 

4693
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,669
you can ask the gates foundation
because they spent a tremendous amount

4694
01:28:19,669 --> 01:28:19,679
because they spent a tremendous amount
 

4695
01:28:19,679 --> 01:28:21,430
because they spent a tremendous amount
of money doing that

4696
01:28:21,430 --> 01:28:21,440
of money doing that
 

4697
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:22,629
of money doing that
and they

4698
01:28:22,629 --> 01:28:22,639
and they
 

4699
01:28:22,639 --> 01:28:24,070
and they
at the end of it because they're

4700
01:28:24,070 --> 01:28:24,080
at the end of it because they're
 

4701
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:26,070
at the end of it because they're
measurement people they want to you know

they want to know the data they found it
 

4705
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:30,470
they want to know the data they found it
had no impact at all and they've kind of

4706
01:28:30,470 --> 01:28:30,480
had no impact at all and they've kind of
 

4707
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:33,510
had no impact at all and they've kind of
pulled out of of that kind of program

4708
01:28:33,510 --> 01:28:33,520
pulled out of of that kind of program
 

4709
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:36,149
pulled out of of that kind of program
so oh boy

4710

you're surely you're not approving of it
 

4723
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:54,070
you're surely you're not approving of it
uh but there's a movie called clerks

just had a handful like two or three or
something like that sexual partners but

4742
01:29:12,629 --> 01:29:12,639
something like that sexual partners but
 

4743
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:14,950
something like that sexual partners but
then she also mentioned

4744
01:29:14,950 --> 01:29:14,960
then she also mentioned
 

4745
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:17,669
then she also mentioned
um that she um

4746
01:29:17,669 --> 01:29:17,679
um that she um
 

4747
01:29:17,679 --> 01:29:19,590
um that she um
what's that called fellatio what's the

4748
01:29:19,590 --> 01:29:19,600
what's that called fellatio what's the
 

4749
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:21,910
what's that called fellatio what's the
scientific but she went you know gave a

4750
01:29:21,910 --> 01:29:23,030
scientific but she went you know gave a
 

4751
01:29:23,030 --> 01:29:23,040

 

4752
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:26,149

to uh 37 guys i believe it is

4753
01:29:26,149 --> 01:29:26,159
to uh 37 guys i believe it is
 

4754
01:29:26,159 --> 01:29:27,430
to uh 37 guys i believe it is
and

4755
01:29:27,430 --> 01:29:27,440
and
 

4756
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:31,110
and
so that has to do with the truth

4757
01:29:31,110 --> 01:29:31,120
so that has to do with the truth
 

4758
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:32,870
so that has to do with the truth
so sometimes

4759
01:29:32,870 --> 01:29:32,880
so sometimes
 

4760
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:35,830
so sometimes
knowing the truth

4761
01:29:35,830 --> 01:29:35,840
knowing the truth
 

4762
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:38,629
knowing the truth
can get in the way of a successful

4763
01:29:38,629 --> 01:29:38,639
can get in the way of a successful
 

4764
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:40,790
can get in the way of a successful
relationship of love of some of the

4765
01:29:40,790 --> 01:29:40,800
relationship of love of some of the
 

4766
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,950
relationship of love of some of the
human flourishing

4767
01:29:42,950 --> 01:29:42,960
human flourishing
 

4768
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:44,310
human flourishing
and that's

4769
01:29:44,310 --> 01:29:44,320
and that's
 

4770
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:47,030
and that's
seems to me that's at the core here that

4771
01:29:47,030 --> 01:29:47,040
seems to me that's at the core here that
 

4772
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:49,350
seems to me that's at the core here that
facing some kind of

4773
01:29:49,350 --> 01:29:49,360
facing some kind of
 

4774
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:51,030
facing some kind of
truth that's not

4775
01:29:51,030 --> 01:29:51,040
truth that's not
 

4776
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:53,350
truth that's not
able to be changed

4777
01:29:53,350 --> 01:29:53,360
able to be changed
 

4778
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:57,350
able to be changed
it makes it difficult to sort of

4779
01:29:57,350 --> 01:29:57,360
it makes it difficult to sort of
 

4780
01:29:57,360 --> 01:30:00,790
it makes it difficult to sort of
it's limiting as opposed to empowering

4781
01:30:00,790 --> 01:30:00,800
it's limiting as opposed to empowering
 

4782
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:03,430
it's limiting as opposed to empowering
that's the concern if you sort of test

4783
01:30:03,430 --> 01:30:03,440
that's the concern if you sort of test
 

4784
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:07,030
that's the concern if you sort of test
for intelligence and lay the data out

for intelligence and lay the data out

it feels like you will give up on

it feels like you will give up on

you will

you will

01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:13,430
you will
you'll sort of start bidding people it's

you'll sort of start bidding people it's

let's focus on the average people or

4797
01:30:18,950 --> 01:30:18,960
let's focus on the average people or
 

4798
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:20,629
let's focus on the average people or
let's focus on the very intelligent

let's focus on the very intelligent
 

4800
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:22,470
let's focus on the very intelligent
people that's the concern

4801
01:30:22,470 --> 01:30:22,480
people that's the concern
 

4802
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:25,750
people that's the concern
and and there's a kind of

4803
01:30:25,750 --> 01:30:25,760
and and there's a kind of
 

4804
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:29,430
and and there's a kind of
intuition that if we just don't measure

4805
01:30:29,430 --> 01:30:29,440
intuition that if we just don't measure
 

4806
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:32,149
intuition that if we just don't measure
and we don't use that data then we would

4807
01:30:32,149 --> 01:30:32,159
and we don't use that data then we would
 

4808
01:30:32,159 --> 01:30:35,590
and we don't use that data then we would
treat everybody equal and give everybody

4809
01:30:35,590 --> 01:30:35,600
treat everybody equal and give everybody
 

4810
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:37,750
treat everybody equal and give everybody
equal opportunity

4811
01:30:37,750 --> 01:30:37,760
equal opportunity
 

4812
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:39,910
equal opportunity
if we have the data in front of us we're

4813
01:30:39,910 --> 01:30:39,920
if we have the data in front of us we're
 

4814
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:41,189
if we have the data in front of us we're
likely to

4815
01:30:41,189 --> 01:30:41,199
likely to
 

4816
01:30:41,199 --> 01:30:43,750
likely to
misdistribute

4817
01:30:43,750 --> 01:30:43,760
misdistribute
 

4818
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:45,750

the amount of sort of attention we

4819
01:30:45,750 --> 01:30:45,760
the amount of sort of attention we
 

4820
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:48,390
the amount of sort of attention we
allocate resources we allocate uh

allocate to people that's that's

allocate to people that's that's
 

4824
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:52,310
allocate to people that's that's
probably the concern

4825
01:30:52,310 --> 01:30:52,320
probably the concern
 

4826
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:54,550
probably the concern
it's a realistic concern

4827
01:30:54,550 --> 01:30:54,560
it's a realistic concern
 

4828
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:57,590
it's a realistic concern
and but i think it's a misplaced concern

4829
01:30:57,590 --> 01:30:57,600
and but i think it's a misplaced concern
 

4830
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:00,390

use messages in each direction make it

5071
01:35:41,910 --> 01:35:41,920
use messages in each direction make it
 

5072
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:43,910
use messages in each direction make it
the make something like the bell curve

5073
01:35:43,910 --> 01:35:43,920
the make something like the bell curve
 

5074
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:45,189
the make something like the bell curve
the enemy

5075
01:35:45,189 --> 01:35:45,199
the enemy
 

5076
01:35:45,199 --> 01:35:50,390
the enemy
or the support for your uh for for one's

5077
01:35:50,390 --> 01:35:50,400
or the support for your uh for for one's
 

5078
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:51,990
or the support for your uh for for one's

racist beliefs
 

5080
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:52,870

and so

5081
01:35:52,870 --> 01:35:52,880
and so
 

5082
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:55,109
and so
uh i think you have to consider that but

5083
01:35:55,109 --> 01:35:55,119
uh i think you have to consider that but
 

5084
01:35:55,119 --> 01:35:57,189
uh i think you have to consider that but
it's difficult because

5085
01:35:57,189 --> 01:35:57,199
it's difficult because
 

5086
01:35:57,199 --> 01:36:00,790
it's difficult because
you know nietzsche was used by hitler to

5087
01:36:00,790 --> 01:36:00,800
you know nietzsche was used by hitler to
 

5088
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:03,270
you know nietzsche was used by hitler to
justify a lot of his beliefs and it's

5089
01:36:03,270 --> 01:36:03,280
justify a lot of his beliefs and it's
 

5090
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:06,550
justify a lot of his beliefs and it's
not in it's not exactly unneeded to to

5091
01:36:06,550 --> 01:36:06,560
not in it's not exactly unneeded to to
 

5092
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:09,830
not in it's not exactly unneeded to to
anticipate hitler so uh or how his ideas

5093
01:36:09,830 --> 01:36:09,840
anticipate hitler so uh or how his ideas
 

5094
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:12,470
anticipate hitler so uh or how his ideas
will be misinterpreted and used for evil

5095
01:36:12,470 --> 01:36:12,480
will be misinterpreted and used for evil
 

5096
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:14,950
will be misinterpreted and used for evil
but there is a balance there so i

5097
01:36:14,950 --> 01:36:14,960
but there is a balance there so i
 

5098
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:16,229
but there is a balance there so i
understand this is really interesting i

5099
01:36:16,229 --> 01:36:16,239
understand this is really interesting i
 

5100
01:36:16,239 --> 01:36:17,750
understand this is really interesting i
didn't i didn't know is there any

5101

to you from a scientific perspective

5107
01:36:23,510 --> 01:36:23,520
to you from a scientific perspective
 

5108
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:27,189
to you from a scientific perspective
there were factual criticisms

5109
01:36:27,189 --> 01:36:27,199
there were factual criticisms
 

5110
01:36:27,199 --> 01:36:30,070
there were factual criticisms
about the nature of the statistics that

5111
01:36:30,070 --> 01:36:30,080
about the nature of the statistics that
 

5112
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:32,550
about the nature of the statistics that
were used the statistical analyses these

5113
01:36:32,550 --> 01:36:32,560
were used the statistical analyses these
 

5114
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:35,030
were used the statistical analyses these
were more technical criticisms and they

5115
01:36:35,030 --> 01:36:35,040
were more technical criticisms and they
 

5116
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:35,830
were more technical criticisms and they
were

5117
01:36:35,830 --> 01:36:35,840
were
 

5118
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:37,510
were
addressed by murray in a couple of

5119
01:36:37,510 --> 01:36:37,520
addressed by murray in a couple of
 

5120
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:38,950
addressed by murray in a couple of
articles where he took all the

5121
01:36:38,950 --> 01:36:38,960
articles where he took all the
 

5122
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:40,310
articles where he took all the
criticisms

5123
01:36:40,310 --> 01:36:40,320
criticisms
 

5124
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:42,390
criticisms
and and spoke to them and people

5125
01:36:42,390 --> 01:36:42,400
and and spoke to them and people
 

5126
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:44,310
and and spoke to them and people
listening to this podcast

5127
01:36:44,310 --> 01:36:44,320
listening to this podcast
 

5128
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:47,030
listening to this podcast
uh can certainly find all those online

5129
01:36:47,030 --> 01:36:47,040
uh can certainly find all those online
 

5130
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:49,590
uh can certainly find all those online
uh it's very interesting but murray went

5131
01:36:49,590 --> 01:36:49,600
uh it's very interesting but murray went
 

5132
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:53,030
uh it's very interesting but murray went
on to write some additional books two in

5133
01:36:53,030 --> 01:36:53,040
on to write some additional books two in
 

5134
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:55,030
on to write some additional books two in
the last couple of years

5135
01:36:55,030 --> 01:36:55,040
the last couple of years
 

5136
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:57,750
the last couple of years
uh one about human diversity

5137
01:36:57,750 --> 01:36:57,760
uh one about human diversity
 

5138
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:00,149
uh one about human diversity
where he goes through the data

5139
01:37:00,149 --> 01:37:00,159
where he goes through the data
 

5140
01:37:00,159 --> 01:37:03,669
where he goes through the data
refuting the idea that race is only a

refuting the idea that race is only a
 

5142
01:37:03,679 --> 01:37:06,950
refuting the idea that race is only a
social construct with no biological

01:37:06,950 --> 01:37:06,960
social construct with no biological
 

5144
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:09,910
social construct with no biological
meaning he he discusses the data it's a

5145
01:37:09,910 --> 01:37:09,920
meaning he he discusses the data it's a
 

5146
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:11,350
meaning he he discusses the data it's a
very good discussion you don't have to

5147
01:37:11,350 --> 01:37:11,360
very good discussion you don't have to
 

5148
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:14,790
very good discussion you don't have to
agree with it but he presents data in a

5149
01:37:14,790 --> 01:37:14,800
agree with it but he presents data in a
 

5150
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:16,550
agree with it but he presents data in a
cogent way

5151
01:37:16,550 --> 01:37:16,560
cogent way
 

5152
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:18,950
cogent way
and he talks about the critics of that

5153
01:37:18,950 --> 01:37:18,960
and he talks about the critics of that
 

5154
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:20,870
and he talks about the critics of that
and he talks about their data in a

5155
01:37:20,870 --> 01:37:20,880
and he talks about their data in a
 

5156
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:21,870
and he talks about their data in a
cogent

5157
01:37:21,870 --> 01:37:21,880
cogent
 

5158
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:24,870
cogent
non-personal way it's it's a it's a very

5159
01:37:24,870 --> 01:37:24,880
non-personal way it's it's a it's a very
 

5160
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:27,430
non-personal way it's it's a it's a very
informative discussion a book is called

5161
01:37:27,430 --> 01:37:27,440
informative discussion a book is called
 

5162
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:29,910
informative discussion a book is called
human diversity he talks about race and

5163
01:37:29,910 --> 01:37:29,920
human diversity he talks about race and
 

5164
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:32,390
human diversity he talks about race and
he talks about gender same thing about

5165
01:37:32,390 --> 01:37:32,400
he talks about gender same thing about
 

5166
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:34,550
he talks about gender same thing about
sex differences

5167
01:37:34,550 --> 01:37:34,560
sex differences
 

5168
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:37,109
sex differences
and more recently he's written what

5169
01:37:37,109 --> 01:37:37,119
and more recently he's written what
 

5170
01:37:37,119 --> 01:37:39,750
and more recently he's written what
might be his final say on this a book

5171
01:37:39,750 --> 01:37:39,760
might be his final say on this a book
 

5172
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:42,870
might be his final say on this a book
called facing reality

5173
01:37:42,870 --> 01:37:42,880
called facing reality
 

5174
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:45,109
called facing reality
where he talks about this again

5175
01:37:45,109 --> 01:37:45,119
where he talks about this again
 

5176
01:37:45,119 --> 01:37:46,070
where he talks about this again
uh

5177
01:37:46,070 --> 01:37:46,080
uh
 

5178
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:48,950
uh
so you know he he can certainly defend

5179
01:37:48,950 --> 01:37:48,960
so you know he he can certainly defend
 

5180
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:51,030
so you know he he can certainly defend
himself he doesn't need me to

5181
01:37:51,030 --> 01:37:51,040
himself he doesn't need me to
 

5182
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:53,590
himself he doesn't need me to
to do that but i would urge people who

5183
01:37:53,590 --> 01:37:53,600
to do that but i would urge people who
 

5184
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:54,950
to do that but i would urge people who
have heard

5185
01:37:54,950 --> 01:37:54,960
have heard
 

5186
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:55,910
have heard
about

5187
01:37:55,910 --> 01:37:55,920
about
 

5188
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:57,990
about
him and the bell curve

5189
01:37:57,990 --> 01:37:58,000
him and the bell curve
 

5190
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:01,430
him and the bell curve
and who think they know what's in it

5191
01:38:01,430 --> 01:38:01,440
and who think they know what's in it
 

5192
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:03,990
and who think they know what's in it
you are likely incorrect and you need to

5193
01:38:03,990 --> 01:38:04,000
you are likely incorrect and you need to
 

5194
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,229
you are likely incorrect and you need to
read it for yourself

5195
01:38:06,229 --> 01:38:06,239
read it for yourself
 

5196
01:38:06,239 --> 01:38:07,510
read it for yourself
but it is

5197
01:38:07,510 --> 01:38:07,520
but it is
 

5198
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:10,709
but it is
uh so scientifically it's a

5199
01:38:10,709 --> 01:38:10,719
uh so scientifically it's a
 

5200
01:38:10,719 --> 01:38:12,870
uh so scientifically it's a
it's a serious subject it's a difficult

01:38:12,870 --> 01:38:12,880
it's a serious subject it's a difficult
 

5202
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:14,790
it's a serious subject it's a difficult
subject ethically it's a difficult

everything you said here calmly and

01:38:18,629 --> 01:38:18,639
everything you said here calmly and
 

5208
01:38:18,639 --> 01:38:20,709
everything you said here calmly and
thoughtfully is difficult this is

thoughtfully is difficult this is
 

5210
01:38:20,719 --> 01:38:22,550
thoughtfully is difficult this is
difficult for me to even

01:38:22,550 --> 01:38:22,560
difficult for me to even
 

5212
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:25,750
difficult for me to even
consider that g factor exists

5213
01:38:25,750 --> 01:38:25,760
consider that g factor exists
 

5214
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:28,709
consider that g factor exists
um i don't mean from like that somehow g

concerning the fact that we die one day
 

5226
01:38:37,119 --> 01:38:39,430
concerning the fact that we die one day
is difficult that we are

5227
01:38:39,430 --> 01:38:39,440
is difficult that we are
 

5228
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:41,910
is difficult that we are
limited by our biology

5229
01:38:41,910 --> 01:38:41,920
limited by our biology
 

5230
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:46,149
limited by our biology
it's difficult and it's um

01:38:46,149 --> 01:38:46,159
it's difficult and it's um
 

5232
01:38:46,159 --> 01:38:47,669
it's difficult and it's um
at least from an american perspective

5233

at least from an american perspective
 

5234
01:38:47,679 --> 01:38:49,430
at least from an american perspective
you like to believe that everything is

5235
01:38:49,430 --> 01:38:49,440
you like to believe that everything is
 

5236
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:51,270
you like to believe that everything is
possible in this world

5237

possible in this world
 

5238
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:54,070
possible in this world
well that leads us to

5239
01:38:54,070 --> 01:38:54,080
well that leads us to
 

5240
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:56,149
well that leads us to
what i think

5241
01:38:56,149 --> 01:38:56,159
what i think
 

5242
01:38:56,159 --> 01:38:57,900
what i think
we should do with this information

5243
01:38:57,900 --> 01:38:57,910
we should do with this information
 

5244
01:38:57,910 --> 01:38:59,910
we should do with this information
[Laughter]

5245
01:38:59,910 --> 01:38:59,920
[Laughter]
 

5246
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:01,830
[Laughter]
and what i think we should do with this

5247
01:39:01,830 --> 01:39:01,840
and what i think we should do with this
 

5248
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:03,350
and what i think we should do with this
information

5249

information
 

5250
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:04,790
information
is

5251
01:39:04,790 --> 01:39:04,800
is
 

5252
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:06,149
is
unusual

5253
01:39:06,149 --> 01:39:06,159
unusual

uh oh
 

5256
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:09,750
uh oh
because i think what we need to do is

because i think what we need to do is
 

5258
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:12,709
because i think what we need to do is
fund more neuroscience research on the

5259
01:39:12,709 --> 01:39:12,719
fund more neuroscience research on the
 

5260
01:39:12,719 --> 01:39:16,709
fund more neuroscience research on the
molecular biology of learning and memory

5261

molecular biology of learning and memory
 

5262

molecular biology of learning and memory
because

because
 

5264
01:39:18,239 --> 01:39:22,070
because
one definition of intelligence

one definition of intelligence
 

5266
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:24,550
one definition of intelligence
is based on how much you can learn and

asked him
 

5332
01:40:39,119 --> 01:40:41,430
asked him
about uh individual differences and he

01:40:41,430 --> 01:40:41,440
about uh individual differences and he
 

5334
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:43,910
about uh individual differences and he
said don't go there it'll set us back 50

5335
01:40:43,910 --> 01:40:43,920
said don't go there it'll set us back 50

5338
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:48,310

but i said i said don't you think

but i said i said don't you think
 

5340

there i think the 21st century will be

science that
 

5352
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:04,149
science that
goes to individual differences because

5353
01:41:04,149 --> 01:41:04,159
goes to individual differences because
 

5354
01:41:04,159 --> 01:41:05,830
goes to individual differences because
we haven't we have now data we have now

01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:40,830
life success uh
you know

5439
01:42:40,830 --> 01:42:40,840
you know
 

5440
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:44,310
you know
uh life expectancy uh

5441
01:42:44,310 --> 01:42:44,320
uh life expectancy uh
 

5442
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:45,510
uh life expectancy uh
i mean though

5443
01:42:45,510 --> 01:42:45,520
i mean though
 

5444
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:47,590
i mean though
that is such an interesting finding but

5445
01:42:47,590 --> 01:42:47,600
that is such an interesting finding but
 

5446
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:50,550
that is such an interesting finding but
it you know iq scores are also

5447
01:42:50,550 --> 01:42:50,560
it you know iq scores are also
 

5448
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:53,990
it you know iq scores are also
correlated to things like income

5449
01:42:53,990 --> 01:42:54,000
correlated to things like income
 

5450
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:57,350
correlated to things like income
now okay so who thinks

5451
01:42:57,350 --> 01:42:57,360
now okay so who thinks
 

5452
01:42:57,360 --> 01:43:00,149
now okay so who thinks
income means you're successful that's

5453
01:43:00,149 --> 01:43:00,159
income means you're successful that's
 

5454
01:43:00,159 --> 01:43:03,030
income means you're successful that's
not the point the point is that income

5455
01:43:03,030 --> 01:43:03,040
not the point the point is that income
 

5456
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:04,310
not the point the point is that income
is one

5457
01:43:04,310 --> 01:43:04,320
is one

that says something about your level of
 

5464
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:13,030
that says something about your level of
success now you can define success in

5465
01:43:13,030 --> 01:43:13,040
success now you can define success in
 

5466
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:15,910
success now you can define success in
ways that have nothing to do with income

5467
01:43:15,910 --> 01:43:15,920
ways that have nothing to do with income
 

5468
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:18,149
ways that have nothing to do with income
you can define success

5469
01:43:18,149 --> 01:43:18,159
you can define success
 

5470
01:43:18,159 --> 01:43:21,030
you can define success
based on your evolutionary natural

5471
01:43:21,030 --> 01:43:21,040
based on your evolutionary natural
 

5472

5476
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:29,750
success you know you but for variables
uh yeah and even that by the way is

5477
01:43:29,750 --> 01:43:29,760
uh yeah and even that by the way is
 

5478
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:32,870
uh yeah and even that by the way is
correlated to iq in in in some uh

so

5483
01:43:35,590 --> 01:43:35,600
so
 

5484
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:39,830
so
however you want to define success

5485
01:43:39,830 --> 01:43:39,840
however you want to define success
 

5486
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:42,229
however you want to define success
iq is important

iq is important
it's not the only determinant people get

5489
01:43:44,629 --> 01:43:44,639
it's not the only determinant people get
 

5490
01:43:44,639 --> 01:43:46,629
it's not the only determinant people get
hung up on well what about personality

don't require complex thinking
 

5516
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:19,510
don't require complex thinking
and there are occupations like that and

5517
01:44:19,510 --> 01:44:19,520
and there are occupations like that and
 

5518
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:23,990
and there are occupations like that and
g doesn't matter within an occupation

01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:28,229
the
g might not matter so much

5523
01:44:28,229 --> 01:44:28,239
g might not matter so much
 

5524
01:44:28,239 --> 01:44:30,470
g might not matter so much
so that if you look at

5525
01:44:30,470 --> 01:44:30,480
so that if you look at
 

5526
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:36,310
so that if you look at
all the professors at mit

5527
01:44:36,310 --> 01:44:36,320

 

5528
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:39,109

and had a way to rank order them on you

5529
01:44:39,109 --> 01:44:39,119
and had a way to rank order them on you
 

5530
01:44:39,119 --> 01:44:40,070
and had a way to rank order them on you
know

5531
01:44:40,070 --> 01:44:40,080
know
 

5532
01:44:40,080 --> 01:44:41,910
know
there's a ceiling effect is what i'm

5533
01:44:41,910 --> 01:44:41,920
there's a ceiling effect is what i'm
 

5534
01:44:41,920 --> 01:44:42,950
there's a ceiling effect is what i'm
saying

5535
01:44:42,950 --> 01:44:42,960
saying
 

5536
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:44,950
saying
that you know

5537
01:44:44,950 --> 01:44:44,960
that you know
 

5538
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:46,470
that you know
also when you get past a certain

5539
01:44:46,470 --> 01:44:46,480
also when you get past a certain
 

5540
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:49,109
also when you get past a certain
threshold then there's impact on wealth

5541
01:44:49,109 --> 01:44:49,119
threshold then there's impact on wealth
 

5542
01:44:49,119 --> 01:44:51,510
threshold then there's impact on wealth
for example or career success

5543
01:44:51,510 --> 01:44:51,520
for example or career success
 

5544
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:53,189
for example or career success
uh however that's defined in each

5545
01:44:53,189 --> 01:44:53,199
uh however that's defined in each
 

5546
01:44:53,199 --> 01:44:55,030
uh however that's defined in each
individual discipline but

5547
01:44:55,030 --> 01:44:55,040
individual discipline but
 

5548
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:56,709
individual discipline but
after a certain point it doesn't matter

5549
01:44:56,709 --> 01:44:56,719
after a certain point it doesn't matter
 

5550
01:44:56,719 --> 01:44:58,870
after a certain point it doesn't matter
actually it does matter in certain

5551
01:44:58,870 --> 01:44:58,880
actually it does matter in certain
 

5552
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:01,910
actually it does matter in certain
things so for example there is a very

5553
01:45:01,910 --> 01:45:01,920
things so for example there is a very
 

5554
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:03,830
things so for example there is a very
classic study

5555
01:45:03,830 --> 01:45:03,840
classic study
 

5556
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:06,870
classic study
uh that was started at johns hopkins

5557
01:45:06,870 --> 01:45:06,880
uh that was started at johns hopkins
 

5558
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:08,870
uh that was started at johns hopkins
when i was a graduate student there i

5559
01:45:08,870 --> 01:45:08,880
when i was a graduate student there i
 

5560
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:10,390
when i was a graduate student there i
actually worked on this study at the

5561
01:45:10,390 --> 01:45:10,400
actually worked on this study at the
 

5562
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:11,830
actually worked on this study at the
very beginning the study of

5563
01:45:11,830 --> 01:45:11,840
very beginning the study of
 

5564
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:13,590
very beginning the study of
mathematically and scientifically

5565
01:45:13,590 --> 01:45:13,600

5568
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:18,470
precocious youth
and they gave

5569
01:45:18,470 --> 01:45:18,480
and they gave
 

5570
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:20,790
and they gave
junior high school students age

5571
01:45:20,790 --> 01:45:20,800

the
 

5576
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:27,030
the
standard s.a.t math exam

5577
01:45:27,030 --> 01:45:27,040
standard s.a.t math exam
 

5578
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:29,830
standard s.a.t math exam
and they found a very large number of

5579
01:45:29,830 --> 01:45:29,840
and they found a very large number of
 

5580
01:45:29,840 --> 01:45:31,350

students
 

5582
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:33,750
students
scored very high on this exam

5583
01:45:33,750 --> 01:45:33,760
scored very high on this exam
 

5584
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:36,070
scored very high on this exam
not a large number i mean they they

5585
01:45:36,070 --> 01:45:36,080
not a large number i mean they they
 

5586
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:38,229
not a large number i mean they they
found many students when they cast the

5587
01:45:38,229 --> 01:45:38,239
found many students when they cast the
 

5588
01:45:38,239 --> 01:45:41,189
found many students when they cast the
net to all of baltimore they found a

5589
01:45:41,189 --> 01:45:41,199
net to all of baltimore they found a
 

5590
01:45:41,199 --> 01:45:43,990
net to all of baltimore they found a
number of students who scored as high on

5591
01:45:43,990 --> 01:45:44,000
number of students who scored as high on
 

5592
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,390
number of students who scored as high on
the s.a.t math when they were 12 years

5593
01:45:46,390 --> 01:45:46,400
the s.a.t math when they were 12 years
 

5594
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:50,149

old as incoming hopkins freshmen
 

5596
01:45:50,159 --> 01:45:52,149
old as incoming hopkins freshmen
and they said gee now this is

5597
01:45:52,149 --> 01:45:52,159
and they said gee now this is
 

5598
01:45:52,159 --> 01:45:53,590
and they said gee now this is
interesting

01:45:56,950 --> 01:45:56,960
we do now
 

5604
01:45:56,960 --> 01:45:57,990
we do now
and

5605
01:45:57,990 --> 01:45:58,000
and
 

5606
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,709
and
on a case-by-case basis they got some of

5607
01:46:00,709 --> 01:46:00,719
on a case-by-case basis they got some of
 

5608
01:46:00,719 --> 01:46:03,270
on a case-by-case basis they got some of
those kids into their local community

5609
01:46:03,270 --> 01:46:03,280
those kids into their local community
 

5610
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:06,709
those kids into their local community
college math programs

5611
01:46:06,709 --> 01:46:06,719

 

5612
01:46:06,719 --> 01:46:08,550

many of those kids went on to be very

5613
01:46:08,550 --> 01:46:08,560
many of those kids went on to be very
 

5614
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:10,149
many of those kids went on to be very
successful

5615
01:46:10,149 --> 01:46:10,159
successful
 

5616
01:46:10,159 --> 01:46:12,709
successful
and now there's a 50-year follow-up of

5617
01:46:12,709 --> 01:46:12,719
and now there's a 50-year follow-up of
 

5618
01:46:12,719 --> 01:46:14,790
and now there's a 50-year follow-up of
those kids

5619
01:46:14,790 --> 01:46:14,800
those kids
 

5620
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:16,790
those kids
and it turns out

5621
01:46:16,790 --> 01:46:16,800
and it turns out
 

5622
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:17,510
and it turns out
if

5623
01:46:17,510 --> 01:46:17,520
if
 

5624
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:20,950
if
these kids were in the top one percent

5625
01:46:20,950 --> 01:46:20,960
these kids were in the top one percent
 

5626
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:22,950
these kids were in the top one percent
okay so everybody in this study is in

5627
01:46:22,950 --> 01:46:22,960
okay so everybody in this study is in
 

5628
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:25,590
okay so everybody in this study is in
the top one percent if you take that

5629
01:46:25,590 --> 01:46:25,600
the top one percent if you take that
 

5630
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:26,709
the top one percent if you take that
group

5631
01:46:26,709 --> 01:46:26,719
group
 

5632
01:46:26,719 --> 01:46:29,030
group
that rarefied group and divide them into

5633
01:46:29,030 --> 01:46:29,040
that rarefied group and divide them into
 

5634
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:30,390
that rarefied group and divide them into
quartiles

5635
01:46:30,390 --> 01:46:30,400
quartiles
 

5636
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:33,109
quartiles
so that you have the top 25 percent of

5637
01:46:33,109 --> 01:46:33,119
so that you have the top 25 percent of
 

5638
01:46:33,119 --> 01:46:36,629
so that you have the top 25 percent of
the top one percent and the bottom 25

5639
01:46:36,629 --> 01:46:36,639
the top one percent and the bottom 25

is painful
 

5746
01:48:36,719 --> 01:48:39,510
is painful
because what's not painful is the thing

5747

because what's not painful is the thing
 

5748
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:40,550
because what's not painful is the thing
you know

01:48:40,550 --> 01:48:40,560
you know
 

5750
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:42,629
you know
if i'm fat and out of shape i can

5751
01:48:42,629 --> 01:48:42,639
if i'm fat and out of shape i can

if i'm fat and out of shape i can
exercise

5753

exercise
and

5755
01:48:45,590 --> 01:48:45,600
and
 

5756
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:47,830
and
you know uh become healthier in that way

5757
01:48:47,830 --> 01:48:47,840
you know uh become healthier in that way
 

5758
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:50,550
you know uh become healthier in that way
if my diet is a giant mess

5759

if my diet is a giant mess
 

5760
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:53,189
if my diet is a giant mess
and that's resulting in some kind of uh

5761
01:48:53,189 --> 01:48:53,199
and that's resulting in some kind of uh
 

5762
01:48:53,199 --> 01:48:55,189
and that's resulting in some kind of uh
conditions that my body is experiencing

5763
01:48:55,189 --> 01:48:55,199
conditions that my body is experiencing
 

5764
01:48:55,199 --> 01:48:58,070
conditions that my body is experiencing
i can fix that by having a better diet

5765
01:48:58,070 --> 01:48:58,080

uh theoretical physicist i'm just not

5835
01:50:18,629 --> 01:50:18,639
uh theoretical physicist i'm just not
 

5836
01:50:18,639 --> 01:50:20,550
uh theoretical physicist i'm just not
that said i mean we should

5837
01:50:20,550 --> 01:50:20,560
that said i mean we should
 

5838
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:22,790
that said i mean we should
because we had this conversation already

5839

because we had this conversation already

returning again to the all men
which means men and women are created

so again some of the differences we're
talking about in quote-unquote success

this is a cohort effect
 

5954
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:36,229
this is a cohort effect
well it's not for an individual

5955
01:52:36,229 --> 01:52:36,239
well it's not for an individual
 

5956
01:52:36,239 --> 01:52:38,709
well it's not for an individual
but the world what how do you explain so

5957
01:52:38,709 --> 01:52:38,719
but the world what how do you explain so
 

5958
01:52:38,719 --> 01:52:40,950
but the world what how do you explain so
what's that and this has presented

01:52:40,950 --> 01:52:40,960
what's that and this has presented
 

5960
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:42,950
what's that and this has presented
intelligence researchers with a great

5961
01:52:42,950 --> 01:52:42,960
intelligence researchers with a great
 

5962
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:44,470
intelligence researchers with a great
mystery

5963
01:52:44,470 --> 01:52:44,480
mystery
 

5964
01:52:44,480 --> 01:52:46,229

two questions

5965
01:52:46,229 --> 01:52:46,239
two questions
 

5966
01:52:46,239 --> 01:52:48,550
two questions
first is it effect

5967
01:52:48,550 --> 01:52:48,560
first is it effect
 

5968
01:52:48,560 --> 01:52:50,709
first is it effect
on the fifty percent of the variance

5969
01:52:50,709 --> 01:52:50,719
on the fifty percent of the variance
 

5970
01:52:50,719 --> 01:52:53,350
on the fifty percent of the variance
that's the g factor or on the other

5971
01:52:53,350 --> 01:52:53,360
that's the g factor or on the other
 

5972
01:52:53,360 --> 01:52:54,950
that's the g factor or on the other
fifty percent

5973
01:52:54,950 --> 01:52:54,960
fifty percent
 

5974
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:57,030
fifty percent
and there's evidence that it is a g

5975
01:52:57,030 --> 01:52:57,040
and there's evidence that it is a g
 

5976
01:52:57,040 --> 01:52:59,589
and there's evidence that it is a g
factor effect

5977
01:52:59,589 --> 01:52:59,599
factor effect
 

5978
01:52:59,599 --> 01:53:02,870
factor effect
and second what on earth causes this and

5979
01:53:02,870 --> 01:53:02,880
and second what on earth causes this and
 

5980
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:05,270
and second what on earth causes this and
doesn't this mean intelligence and g

5981
01:53:05,270 --> 01:53:05,280
doesn't this mean intelligence and g
 

5982
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:07,669
doesn't this mean intelligence and g
factor cannot be genetic

5983
01:53:07,669 --> 01:53:07,679
factor cannot be genetic
 

5984
01:53:07,679 --> 01:53:10,149
factor cannot be genetic
because the scale of natural selection

5985
01:53:10,149 --> 01:53:10,159
because the scale of natural selection
 

5986
01:53:10,159 --> 01:53:10,870
because the scale of natural selection
is

5987
01:53:10,870 --> 01:53:10,880
is
 

5988
01:53:10,880 --> 01:53:12,870
is
much much longer

5989
01:53:12,870 --> 01:53:12,880
much much longer
 

5990
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:15,510
much much longer
than a couple of decades ago

5991
01:53:15,510 --> 01:53:15,520
than a couple of decades ago
 

5992
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:17,589
than a couple of decades ago
and so it's been used

5993
01:53:17,589 --> 01:53:17,599
and so it's been used
 

5994
01:53:17,599 --> 01:53:20,310
and so it's been used
to try to undermine the idea that there

5995
01:53:20,310 --> 01:53:20,320
to try to undermine the idea that there
 

5996
01:53:20,320 --> 01:53:22,310
to try to undermine the idea that there
can be a genetic influence on

5997
01:53:22,310 --> 01:53:22,320
can be a genetic influence on
 

5998
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:24,310
can be a genetic influence on
intelligence

5999
01:53:24,310 --> 01:53:24,320
intelligence
 

6000
01:53:24,320 --> 01:53:27,270
intelligence
but certainly it can be

6001
01:53:27,270 --> 01:53:27,280
but certainly it can be
 

6002
01:53:27,280 --> 01:53:29,589
but certainly it can be
the flint effect can affect the

6003
01:53:29,589 --> 01:53:29,599
the flint effect can affect the
 

6004
01:53:29,599 --> 01:53:31,990
the flint effect can affect the
non-genetic aspects of intelligence

6005
01:53:31,990 --> 01:53:32,000
non-genetic aspects of intelligence
 

6006
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:35,669
non-genetic aspects of intelligence
because genes account for maybe 50

6007
01:53:35,669 --> 01:53:35,679
because genes account for maybe 50
 

6008
01:53:35,679 --> 01:53:37,669
because genes account for maybe 50
of the variance

6009
01:53:37,669 --> 01:53:37,679
of the variance
 

6010
01:53:37,679 --> 01:53:39,589
of the variance
may be higher it could be as high as 80

6011
01:53:39,589 --> 01:53:39,599
may be higher it could be as high as 80
 

6012
01:53:39,599 --> 01:53:42,550
may be higher it could be as high as 80
percent for adults but let's just say 50

6013
01:53:42,550 --> 01:53:42,560
percent for adults but let's just say 50
 

6014
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:44,550
percent for adults but let's just say 50
percent for discussion

6015
01:53:44,550 --> 01:53:44,560
percent for discussion
 

6016
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:46,310
percent for discussion
um

6017
01:53:46,310 --> 01:53:46,320
um
 

6018
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:49,030
um
so the the flint effect is it's still a

6019
01:53:49,030 --> 01:53:49,040
so the the flint effect is it's still a
 

6020
01:53:49,040 --> 01:53:50,229
so the the flint effect is it's still a
mystery

6021
01:53:50,229 --> 01:53:50,239
mystery
 

6022
01:53:50,239 --> 01:53:51,669
mystery
it's still in this shape it's still a

6023
01:53:51,669 --> 01:53:51,679
it's still in this shape it's still a
 

6024
01:53:51,679 --> 01:53:53,669
it's still in this shape it's still a
mystery although the evidence is coming

6025
01:53:53,669 --> 01:53:53,679
mystery although the evidence is coming
 

6026
01:53:53,679 --> 01:53:55,830
mystery although the evidence is coming
out i told you before i edit a journal

6027
01:53:55,830 --> 01:53:55,840
out i told you before i edit a journal
 

6028
01:53:55,840 --> 01:53:57,189
out i told you before i edit a journal
on intelligence and we're doing a

6029
01:53:57,189 --> 01:53:57,199
on intelligence and we're doing a
 

6030
01:53:57,199 --> 01:54:00,790
on intelligence and we're doing a
special issue in honor of james flynn so

6031
01:54:00,790 --> 01:54:00,800
special issue in honor of james flynn so
 

6032
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:02,709
special issue in honor of james flynn so
i'm starting to see papers now on the

6033
01:54:02,709 --> 01:54:02,719
i'm starting to see papers now on the
 

6034
01:54:02,719 --> 01:54:05,189
i'm starting to see papers now on the
really the latest research on this

6035
01:54:05,189 --> 01:54:05,199
really the latest research on this
 

6036
01:54:05,199 --> 01:54:06,310
really the latest research on this
um

6037
01:54:06,310 --> 01:54:06,320
um
 

6038
01:54:06,320 --> 01:54:08,870
um
i think most people who specialize in

6039
01:54:08,870 --> 01:54:08,880
i think most people who specialize in
 

6040
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:10,709
i think most people who specialize in
this area of trying to understand the

6041
01:54:10,709 --> 01:54:10,719
this area of trying to understand the
 

6042
01:54:10,719 --> 01:54:12,070
this area of trying to understand the
flint effect

6043
01:54:12,070 --> 01:54:12,080
flint effect
 

6044
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:14,390
flint effect
uh are coming to the

6045
01:54:14,390 --> 01:54:14,400
uh are coming to the
 

6046
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:16,390
uh are coming to the
view based on data

6047
01:54:16,390 --> 01:54:16,400
view based on data
 

6048
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:18,629
view based on data
that it has to do with advances in

6049
01:54:18,629 --> 01:54:18,639
that it has to do with advances in
 

6050
01:54:18,639 --> 01:54:22,950
that it has to do with advances in
nutrition and health care

6051
01:54:22,950 --> 01:54:22,960

 

6052
01:54:22,960 --> 01:54:25,430

and there's also evidence

6053
01:54:25,430 --> 01:54:25,440
and there's also evidence
 

6054
01:54:25,440 --> 01:54:28,149
and there's also evidence
that the effect is slowing down and

6055
01:54:28,149 --> 01:54:28,159
that the effect is slowing down and
 

6056
01:54:28,159 --> 01:54:30,229
that the effect is slowing down and
possibly reversing

6057
01:54:30,229 --> 01:54:30,239
possibly reversing
 

6058
01:54:30,239 --> 01:54:34,229
possibly reversing
oh boy so how would nutrition so

6059
01:54:34,229 --> 01:54:34,239
oh boy so how would nutrition so
 

6060
01:54:34,239 --> 01:54:37,030
oh boy so how would nutrition so
nutrition would still be connected to

6061
01:54:37,030 --> 01:54:37,040
nutrition would still be connected to
 

6062
01:54:37,040 --> 01:54:38,149
nutrition would still be connected to
the

6063
01:54:38,149 --> 01:54:38,159
the
 

6064
01:54:38,159 --> 01:54:40,709
the
g factor so nutrition as it relates to

6065
01:54:40,709 --> 01:54:40,719
g factor so nutrition as it relates to
 

6066
01:54:40,719 --> 01:54:42,790
g factor so nutrition as it relates to
the g factor so the biology that leads

6067
01:54:42,790 --> 01:54:42,800
the g factor so the biology that leads
 

6068
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:45,030
the g factor so the biology that leads
to the intelligence

6069
01:54:45,030 --> 01:54:45,040
to the intelligence
 

6070
01:54:45,040 --> 01:54:47,910
to the intelligence
yes that would be the claim like

6071
01:54:47,910 --> 01:54:47,920
yes that would be the claim like
 

6072
01:54:47,920 --> 01:54:50,870
yes that would be the claim like
uh the the the hypothesis

6073
01:54:50,870 --> 01:54:50,880
uh the the the hypothesis
 

6074
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:52,470
uh the the the hypothesis
being tested by the research yes and

6075
01:54:52,470 --> 01:54:52,480
being tested by the research yes and
 

6076
01:54:52,480 --> 01:54:55,750
being tested by the research yes and
there's some evidence from from infants

6077
01:54:55,750 --> 01:54:55,760
there's some evidence from from infants
 

6078
01:54:55,760 --> 01:54:56,709
there's some evidence from from infants
um

6079
01:54:56,709 --> 01:54:56,719
um
 

6080
01:54:56,719 --> 01:55:00,229
um
that nutrition has has made a difference

6081
01:55:00,229 --> 01:55:00,239
that nutrition has has made a difference
 

6082
01:55:00,239 --> 01:55:01,910
that nutrition has has made a difference
and so it's not an unreasonable

6083
01:55:01,910 --> 01:55:01,920
and so it's not an unreasonable
 

6084
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:03,990
and so it's not an unreasonable
connection

6085
01:55:03,990 --> 01:55:04,000
connection
 

6086
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,229
connection
but does it negate the idea that there's

6087
01:55:06,229 --> 01:55:06,239
but does it negate the idea that there's
 

6088
01:55:06,239 --> 01:55:09,669
but does it negate the idea that there's
a genetic influence not logically at all

6089
01:55:09,669 --> 01:55:09,679
a genetic influence not logically at all
 

6090
01:55:09,679 --> 01:55:12,709
a genetic influence not logically at all
so but it is very interesting so that if

6091
01:55:12,709 --> 01:55:12,719
so but it is very interesting so that if
 

6092
01:55:12,719 --> 01:55:13,510
so but it is very interesting so that if
you

6093
01:55:13,510 --> 01:55:13,520
you
 

6094
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:16,629
you
take an iq test today

6095
01:55:16,629 --> 01:55:16,639
take an iq test today
 

6096
01:55:16,639 --> 01:55:19,270
take an iq test today
but you normal but you take the score

6097
01:55:19,270 --> 01:55:19,280
but you normal but you take the score
 

6098
01:55:19,280 --> 01:55:22,390
but you normal but you take the score
and use the tables that were available

6099
01:55:22,390 --> 01:55:22,400
and use the tables that were available
 

6100
01:55:22,400 --> 01:55:24,790
and use the tables that were available
in 1940

6101
01:55:24,790 --> 01:55:24,800
in 1940
 

6102
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:25,990
in 1940
you're going to wind up with a much

6103
01:55:25,990 --> 01:55:26,000
you're going to wind up with a much
 

6104
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,870
you're going to wind up with a much
higher iq number

6105
01:55:28,870 --> 01:55:28,880
higher iq number
 

6106
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:30,870
higher iq number
so are we really

6107
01:55:30,870 --> 01:55:30,880
so are we really
 

6108
01:55:30,880 --> 01:55:34,709
so are we really
smarter than a couple of generations ago

6109
01:55:34,709 --> 01:55:34,719
smarter than a couple of generations ago
 

6110
01:55:34,719 --> 01:55:35,990
smarter than a couple of generations ago
no but

6111
01:55:35,990 --> 01:55:36,000
no but
 

6112
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,629
no but
we might be able to solve problems a

6113
01:55:38,629 --> 01:55:38,639
we might be able to solve problems a
 

6114
01:55:38,639 --> 01:55:40,870
we might be able to solve problems a
little better

6115
01:55:40,870 --> 01:55:40,880
little better
 

6116
01:55:40,880 --> 01:55:43,669
little better
and make use of our rg because of things

6117
01:55:43,669 --> 01:55:43,679
and make use of our rg because of things
 

6118
01:55:43,679 --> 01:55:45,589
and make use of our rg because of things
like sesame street

6119
01:55:45,589 --> 01:55:45,599

6120
01:55:45,599 --> 01:55:48,070

01:55:51,589 --> 01:55:51,599
people are going to to to to school
 

6124
01:55:51,599 --> 01:55:54,550
people are going to to to to school
uh so there are a lot of factors here to

6125
01:55:54,550 --> 01:55:54,560
uh so there are a lot of factors here to
 

6126
01:55:54,560 --> 01:55:56,070
uh so there are a lot of factors here to
disentangle

6127
01:55:56,070 --> 01:55:56,080
disentangle
 

6128
01:55:56,080 --> 01:55:57,669

01:56:05,199 --> 01:56:06,709
as a population we're getting smarter we
just zoom out that's what it looks like

01:56:11,920 --> 01:56:14,870
that are i mean this raises the question
we've mentioned it many times but

6147
01:56:14,870 --> 01:56:14,880
we've mentioned it many times but
 

6148
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:17,350
we've mentioned it many times but
haven't clearly addressed it which is

01:56:17,350 --> 01:56:17,360
haven't clearly addressed it which is

01:56:17,360 --> 01:56:19,990
haven't clearly addressed it which is
nature versus nurture questions so

6151
01:56:19,990 --> 01:56:20,000
nature versus nurture questions so
 

6152
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,149
nature versus nurture questions so
how much of intelligence is nature how

6153
01:56:22,149 --> 01:56:22,159
how much of intelligence is nature how
 

6154
01:56:22,159 --> 01:56:24,470
how much of intelligence is nature how
much of it is nurture how much of it is

is nature and nurture
 

6166
01:56:34,239 --> 01:56:35,750
is nature and nurture
yeah so yes

6167
01:56:35,750 --> 01:56:35,760
yeah so yes

that is a the framing of that
 

6180
01:56:50,239 --> 01:56:52,709
that is a the framing of that
if if the question is framed that way it

6181
01:56:52,709 --> 01:56:52,719
if if the question is framed that way it
 

6182
01:56:52,719 --> 01:56:55,189
if if the question is framed that way it
can't can't be answered because nature

can't can't be answered because nature
 

6184
01:56:55,199 --> 01:56:57,830
can't can't be answered because nature

understanding those interactions
is so complex

01:57:06,390 --> 01:57:06,400
is so complex
 

6194
01:57:06,400 --> 01:57:09,990
is so complex
that many behavioral geneticists say it

01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:13,750
that many behavioral geneticists say it
it is today impossible and always will

01:58:27,040 --> 01:58:31,270
of the g factor
give you at least a hint that there is a

6261
01:58:31,270 --> 01:58:31,280
give you at least a hint that there is a
 

6262
01:58:31,280 --> 01:58:34,470
give you at least a hint that there is a
biological basis for intelligence yes i

6263
01:58:34,470 --> 01:58:34,480
biological basis for intelligence yes i
 

6264
01:58:34,480 --> 01:58:36,470
biological basis for intelligence yes i
i think it's clear

6265
01:58:36,470 --> 01:58:36,480
i think it's clear
 

6266
01:58:36,480 --> 01:58:38,790
i think it's clear
that the fact that

6267
01:58:38,790 --> 01:58:38,800
that the fact that
 

6268
01:58:38,800 --> 01:58:42,390
that the fact that
an iq score is correlated to things like

6269
01:58:42,390 --> 01:58:42,400
an iq score is correlated to things like
 

6270
01:58:42,400 --> 01:58:44,709
an iq score is correlated to things like
thickness of your cortex

thickness of your cortex
 

6272
01:58:44,719 --> 01:58:46,950
thickness of your cortex
that is correlated to

01:58:46,950 --> 01:58:46,960
that is correlated to
 

6274
01:58:46,960 --> 01:58:48,390
that is correlated to

that
that

that
 

6282
01:58:54,639 --> 01:58:57,990
that
identical twins reared apart

01:58:57,990 --> 01:58:58,000
identical twins reared apart
 

6284
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:01,750
identical twins reared apart
are highly similar in their iq scores

6285
01:59:01,750 --> 01:59:01,760
are highly similar in their iq scores
 

6286
01:59:01,760 --> 01:59:03,750
are highly similar in their iq scores
these are all

6287
01:59:03,750 --> 01:59:03,760
these are all
 

6288
01:59:03,760 --> 01:59:06,310
these are all
important observations

01:59:06,310 --> 01:59:06,320
important observations
 

6290
01:59:06,320 --> 01:59:09,189
important observations
that certainly more than that indicate

01:59:09,189 --> 01:59:09,199
that certainly more than that indicate
 

6292
01:59:09,199 --> 01:59:11,669
that certainly more than that indicate
not just suggest but indicate

6293
01:59:11,669 --> 01:59:11,679
not just suggest but indicate
 

6294
01:59:11,679 --> 01:59:13,669
not just suggest but indicate
that there's a biological basis and does

6295
01:59:13,669 --> 01:59:13,679
that there's a biological basis and does
 

6296
01:59:13,679 --> 01:59:15,669
that there's a biological basis and does
anyone believe intelligence has nothing

6297
01:59:15,669 --> 01:59:15,679
anyone believe intelligence has nothing
 

6298
01:59:15,679 --> 01:59:18,550
anyone believe intelligence has nothing
to do with the brain

6299
01:59:18,550 --> 01:59:18,560
to do with the brain
 

6300
01:59:18,560 --> 01:59:20,870
to do with the brain
i mean it's so obvious

6301
01:59:20,870 --> 01:59:20,880
i mean it's so obvious
 

6302
01:59:20,880 --> 01:59:21,750
i mean it's so obvious
well

6303
01:59:21,750 --> 01:59:21,760
well
 

6304
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:23,510
well
indirectly definitely has to do with it

6305
01:59:23,510 --> 01:59:23,520
indirectly definitely has to do with it
 

6306
01:59:23,520 --> 01:59:25,270
indirectly definitely has to do with it
but the question is

6307
01:59:25,270 --> 01:59:25,280
but the question is
 

6308
01:59:25,280 --> 01:59:27,270
but the question is
environment interacting with the brain

6309
01:59:27,270 --> 01:59:27,280
environment interacting with the brain
 

6310
01:59:27,280 --> 01:59:30,870
environment interacting with the brain
or is it the actual

6311
01:59:30,870 --> 01:59:30,880
or is it the actual
 

6312
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:32,550
or is it the actual
raw

6313
01:59:32,550 --> 01:59:32,560
raw
 

6314
01:59:32,560 --> 01:59:34,629
raw
hardware of the brain

6315
01:59:34,629 --> 01:59:34,639
hardware of the brain
 

6316
01:59:34,639 --> 01:59:36,629
hardware of the brain
well some would say

6317
01:59:36,629 --> 01:59:36,639
well some would say
 

6318
01:59:36,639 --> 01:59:41,270
well some would say
that the raw hardware of the brain

6319
01:59:41,270 --> 01:59:41,280

 

6320
01:59:41,280 --> 01:59:43,350

as it develops

6321
01:59:43,350 --> 01:59:43,360
as it develops
 

6322
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:45,510
as it develops
from conception

6323
01:59:45,510 --> 01:59:45,520
from conception

through adulthood or at least through
 

6326
01:59:48,400 --> 01:59:49,830
through adulthood or at least through
the childhood

01:59:49,830 --> 01:59:49,840
the childhood
 

6328
01:59:49,840 --> 01:59:52,629
the childhood
that that that so-called hardware that

6329
01:59:52,629 --> 01:59:52,639
that that that so-called hardware that
 

6330
01:59:52,639 --> 01:59:55,750
that that that so-called hardware that
you are assuming is mostly genetic

6331
01:59:55,750 --> 01:59:55,760
you are assuming is mostly genetic
 

6332
01:59:55,760 --> 01:59:57,270
you are assuming is mostly genetic
in fact

6333
01:59:57,270 --> 01:59:57,280
in fact
 

6334
01:59:57,280 --> 02:00:00,470
in fact
is not as deterministic as you might

6335
02:00:00,470 --> 02:00:00,480
is not as deterministic as you might
 

6336
02:00:00,480 --> 02:00:03,750
is not as deterministic as you might
think that it is probabilistic and what

6337
02:00:03,750 --> 02:00:03,760
think that it is probabilistic and what
 

6338
02:00:03,760 --> 02:00:05,750
think that it is probabilistic and what
affects the probabilities are things

6339
02:00:05,750 --> 02:00:05,760
affects the probabilities are things
 

6340
02:00:05,760 --> 02:00:09,109
affects the probabilities are things
like in uterine environment

6341
02:00:09,109 --> 02:00:09,119
like in uterine environment
 

6342
02:00:09,119 --> 02:00:13,030
like in uterine environment
and other factors like that including

6343
02:00:13,030 --> 02:00:13,040
and other factors like that including
 

6344
02:00:13,040 --> 02:00:14,870
and other factors like that including
chance

6345
02:00:14,870 --> 02:00:14,880
chance
 

6346
02:00:14,880 --> 02:00:16,790
chance
that chance

6347
02:00:16,790 --> 02:00:16,800
that chance
 

6348
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:18,950
that chance
affects the way the neurons are

6349
02:00:18,950 --> 02:00:18,960
affects the way the neurons are
 

6350
02:00:18,960 --> 02:00:22,390
affects the way the neurons are
connecting during gestation

6351
02:00:22,390 --> 02:00:22,400
connecting during gestation
 

6352
02:00:22,400 --> 02:00:23,750
connecting during gestation
it's not

6353
02:00:23,750 --> 02:00:23,760
it's not
 

6354
02:00:23,760 --> 02:00:24,709
it's not
hey

6355
02:00:24,709 --> 02:00:24,719
hey
 

6356
02:00:24,719 --> 02:00:26,550
hey
it's pre-programmed

6357
02:00:26,550 --> 02:00:26,560
it's pre-programmed
 

6358
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:28,629
it's pre-programmed
so there's there is

6359
02:00:28,629 --> 02:00:28,639
so there's there is
 

6360
02:00:28,639 --> 02:00:31,109
so there's there is
pushback on the concept that genes

6361
02:00:31,109 --> 02:00:31,119
pushback on the concept that genes
 

6362
02:00:31,119 --> 02:00:34,709
pushback on the concept that genes
provide a blueprint

6363
02:00:34,709 --> 02:00:34,719

 

6364
02:00:34,719 --> 02:00:37,589

that is a lot more fluid well but also

6365
02:00:37,589 --> 02:00:37,599
that is a lot more fluid well but also
 

6366
02:00:37,599 --> 02:00:40,070
that is a lot more fluid well but also
yeah so there's a lot a lot a lot

6367
02:00:40,070 --> 02:00:40,080
yeah so there's a lot a lot a lot
 

6368
02:00:40,080 --> 02:00:42,390
yeah so there's a lot a lot a lot
happens in the first few

6369
02:00:42,390 --> 02:00:42,400
happens in the first few
 

6370
02:00:42,400 --> 02:00:43,990
happens in the first few
months

6371
02:00:43,990 --> 02:00:44,000
months
 

6372
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:45,510
months
of development

6373
02:00:45,510 --> 02:00:45,520
of development
 

6374
02:00:45,520 --> 02:00:47,109
of development
uh

6375
02:00:47,109 --> 02:00:47,119
uh
 

6376
02:00:47,119 --> 02:00:49,109
uh
so for in in nine months

6377
02:00:49,109 --> 02:00:49,119
so for in in nine months
 

6378
02:00:49,119 --> 02:00:51,510
so for in in nine months
in inside the mother's body and in the

6379
02:00:51,510 --> 02:00:51,520
in inside the mother's body and in the
 

6380
02:00:51,520 --> 02:00:52,709
in inside the mother's body and in the
uh

6381
02:00:52,709 --> 02:00:52,719
uh
 

6382
02:00:52,719 --> 02:00:53,669
uh
in and

6383
02:00:53,669 --> 02:00:53,679
in and
 

6384
02:00:53,679 --> 02:00:55,830
in and
you know the the months the few months

6385
02:00:55,830 --> 02:00:55,840
you know the the months the few months
 

6386
02:00:55,840 --> 02:00:58,070
you know the the months the few months
afterwards there's a lot of fascinating

6387
02:00:58,070 --> 02:00:58,080
afterwards there's a lot of fascinating
 

6388
02:00:58,080 --> 02:01:00,149
afterwards there's a lot of fascinating
stuff like including chance and luck

6389
02:01:00,149 --> 02:01:00,159
stuff like including chance and luck
 

6390
02:01:00,159 --> 02:01:01,589
stuff like including chance and luck
like you said

6391
02:01:01,589 --> 02:01:01,599
like you said
 

6392
02:01:01,599 --> 02:01:03,750
like you said
how things connect up

6393
02:01:03,750 --> 02:01:03,760
how things connect up
 

6394
02:01:03,760 --> 02:01:05,350
how things connect up
man the question is

6395
02:01:05,350 --> 02:01:05,360
man the question is
 

6396
02:01:05,360 --> 02:01:07,109
man the question is
afterwards the neuroplasticity of the

6397
02:01:07,109 --> 02:01:07,119
afterwards the neuroplasticity of the
 

6398
02:01:07,119 --> 02:01:08,390
afterwards the neuroplasticity of the
brain how much adjustment there is

6399
02:01:08,390 --> 02:01:08,400
brain how much adjustment there is
 

6400
02:01:08,400 --> 02:01:10,310
brain how much adjustment there is
relative to the environment how much

6401
02:01:10,310 --> 02:01:10,320
relative to the environment how much
 

6402
02:01:10,320 --> 02:01:12,629
relative to the environment how much
that affects the g factor but that's

6403
02:01:12,629 --> 02:01:12,639
that affects the g factor but that's
 

6404
02:01:12,639 --> 02:01:13,910
that affects the g factor but that's
where the

6405
02:01:13,910 --> 02:01:13,920
where the
 

6406
02:01:13,920 --> 02:01:15,430
where the
the whole conclusions of the studies

6407
02:01:15,430 --> 02:01:15,440
the whole conclusions of the studies
 

6408
02:01:15,440 --> 02:01:18,070
the whole conclusions of the studies
that we've been talking about is

6409
02:01:18,070 --> 02:01:18,080
that we've been talking about is
 

6410
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:19,510
that we've been talking about is
that seems to have less and less and

6411
02:01:19,510 --> 02:01:19,520
that seems to have less and less and
 

6412
02:01:19,520 --> 02:01:20,830
that seems to have less and less and
less of an effect

6413
02:01:20,830 --> 02:01:20,840
less of an effect
 

6414
02:01:20,840 --> 02:01:22,070
less of an effect
as uh

6415
02:01:22,070 --> 02:01:22,080
as uh
 

6416
02:01:22,080 --> 02:01:23,350
as uh
pretty quickly

6417
02:01:23,350 --> 02:01:23,360
pretty quickly
 

6418
02:01:23,360 --> 02:01:26,310
pretty quickly
as yes and i do think there is more of a

6419
02:01:26,310 --> 02:01:26,320
as yes and i do think there is more of a
 

6420
02:01:26,320 --> 02:01:27,430
as yes and i do think there is more of a
genetic

6421
02:01:27,430 --> 02:01:27,440
genetic
 

6422
02:01:27,440 --> 02:01:29,030
genetic
by my view

6423
02:01:29,030 --> 02:01:29,040
by my view
 

6424
02:01:29,040 --> 02:01:31,189
by my view
and i'm not an expert on this i mean

6425
02:01:31,189 --> 02:01:31,199
and i'm not an expert on this i mean
 

6426
02:01:31,199 --> 02:01:33,189
and i'm not an expert on this i mean
genetics is a highly technical and

6427
02:01:33,189 --> 02:01:33,199
genetics is a highly technical and
 

6428
02:01:33,199 --> 02:01:35,669
genetics is a highly technical and

not a behavioral geneticist but but

02:01:39,189 --> 02:01:39,199
not a behavioral geneticist but but

my reading of this my interpretation of

6433
02:01:42,070 --> 02:01:42,080
my reading of this my interpretation of
 

6434
02:01:42,080 --> 02:01:43,990
my reading of this my interpretation of
this is that

6435
02:01:43,990 --> 02:01:44,000
this is that
 

6436
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:47,189
this is that
there is a genetic blueprint more or

6437
02:01:47,189 --> 02:01:47,199
there is a genetic blueprint more or
 

6438
02:01:47,199 --> 02:01:48,070
there is a genetic blueprint more or
less

less
 

6440
02:01:48,080 --> 02:01:50,950
less
and that has a profound influence on

6441
02:01:50,950 --> 02:01:50,960
and that has a profound influence on

02:01:50,960 --> 02:01:52,470

that's not to say things can't happen

a tiny component i think the data
 

6500
02:02:54,239 --> 02:02:56,550
a tiny component i think the data
support the idea that the genetics is a

support the idea that the genetics is a

what you just said it might be wrong
can you can you imagine a world

6523
02:03:21,910 --> 02:03:21,920
can you can you imagine a world
 

6524
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:23,910
can you can you imagine a world
and what kind of evidence

6525
02:03:23,910 --> 02:03:23,920
and what kind of evidence
 

6526
02:03:23,920 --> 02:03:26,470
and what kind of evidence
would you need to see

6527
02:03:26,470 --> 02:03:26,480
would you need to see

studies so far like reversing the

6531
02:03:30,709 --> 02:03:30,719
studies so far like reversing the
 

6532
02:03:30,719 --> 02:03:33,109
studies so far like reversing the
directions so one of the cool things we

6533
02:03:33,109 --> 02:03:33,119
directions so one of the cool things we
 

6534
02:03:33,119 --> 02:03:35,030
directions so one of the cool things we
have now more and more is we're getting

6535
02:03:35,030 --> 02:03:35,040
have now more and more is we're getting
 

6536
02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:36,790
have now more and more is we're getting
more and more data and the the rate of

6537
02:03:36,790 --> 02:03:36,800
more and more data and the the rate of
 

6538
02:03:36,800 --> 02:03:38,470
more and more data and the the rate of
the data is

6539
02:03:38,470 --> 02:03:38,480
the data is
 

6540
02:03:38,480 --> 02:03:40,950
the data is
is is escalating because of the digital

6541
02:03:40,950 --> 02:03:40,960
is is escalating because of the digital
 

6542
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:42,629
is is escalating because of the digital
world so

6543
02:03:42,629 --> 02:03:42,639
world so
 

6544
02:03:42,639 --> 02:03:44,950
world so
when you start to look at a very large

6545
02:03:44,950 --> 02:03:44,960
when you start to look at a very large
 

6546
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:47,030
when you start to look at a very large
scale of data

6547
02:03:47,030 --> 02:03:47,040
scale of data
 

6548
02:03:47,040 --> 02:03:49,109
scale of data
both on the biology side and the social

6549
02:03:49,109 --> 02:03:49,119
both on the biology side and the social
 

6550
02:03:49,119 --> 02:03:51,109
both on the biology side and the social
side we might be discovering some very

6551
02:03:51,109 --> 02:03:51,119
side we might be discovering some very
 

6552
02:03:51,119 --> 02:03:53,910
side we might be discovering some very
counterintuitive things about society we

6553
02:03:53,910 --> 02:03:53,920
counterintuitive things about society we
 

6554
02:03:53,920 --> 02:03:56,550
counterintuitive things about society we
might see the edge cases

6555
02:03:56,550 --> 02:03:56,560
might see the edge cases
 

6556
02:03:56,560 --> 02:03:58,950
might see the edge cases
that reveal that if we actually scale

6557
02:03:58,950 --> 02:03:58,960
that reveal that if we actually scale
 

6558
02:03:58,960 --> 02:04:01,430
that reveal that if we actually scale
those edge cases and they become like

6559
02:04:01,430 --> 02:04:01,440
those edge cases and they become like
 

6560
02:04:01,440 --> 02:04:04,950
those edge cases and they become like
the norm that will have a complete shift

6561
02:04:04,950 --> 02:04:04,960
the norm that will have a complete shift
 

6562
02:04:04,960 --> 02:04:06,069
the norm that will have a complete shift
in our

6563
02:04:06,069 --> 02:04:06,079
in our
 

6564
02:04:06,079 --> 02:04:07,910
in our
like you'll see

6565
02:04:07,910 --> 02:04:07,920
like you'll see
 

6566
02:04:07,920 --> 02:04:10,550
like you'll see

in the teens and in the in in later life

6571
02:04:15,109 --> 02:04:15,119

6572
02:04:15,119 --> 02:04:15,910
in the teens and in the in in later life
so

6573
02:04:15,910 --> 02:04:15,920
so
 

6574
02:04:15,920 --> 02:04:18,790
so
a is in any case you can make or for

02:04:18,790 --> 02:04:18,800
a is in any case you can make or for
 

6576

a is in any case you can make or for
well your current intuitions are wrong

6577
02:04:20,709 --> 02:04:20,719
well your current intuitions are wrong
 

6578
02:04:20,719 --> 02:04:22,550
well your current intuitions are wrong
yes and it's a good question because i

6579
02:04:22,550 --> 02:04:22,560
yes and it's a good question because i
 

6580
02:04:22,560 --> 02:04:24,550
yes and it's a good question because i
think everyone should always be asked

6581
02:04:24,550 --> 02:04:24,560
think everyone should always be asked
 

6582
02:04:24,560 --> 02:04:26,390
think everyone should always be asked
what evidence would change your mind

6583
02:04:26,390 --> 02:04:26,400
what evidence would change your mind
 

6584
02:04:26,400 --> 02:04:27,189
what evidence would change your mind
yeah

6585
02:04:27,189 --> 02:04:27,199
yeah
 

6586
02:04:27,199 --> 02:04:29,270
yeah
uh it's certainly not only a fair

6587
02:04:29,270 --> 02:04:29,280
uh it's certainly not only a fair
 

6588
02:04:29,280 --> 02:04:31,750
uh it's certainly not only a fair
question it is really the key question

6589
02:04:31,750 --> 02:04:31,760
question it is really the key question
 

6590
02:04:31,760 --> 02:04:34,950
question it is really the key question
for anybody working on any aspect of

6591
02:04:34,950 --> 02:04:34,960
for anybody working on any aspect of

02:04:34,960 --> 02:04:36,470
for anybody working on any aspect of
science

i think that if environment

i think that if environment
 

6596
02:04:40,719 --> 02:04:43,109
i think that if environment
was very important

6597
02:04:43,109 --> 02:04:43,119
was very important
 

6598
02:04:43,119 --> 02:04:45,830
was very important
we would have seen it clearly by now it

6599
02:04:45,830 --> 02:04:45,840
we would have seen it clearly by now it
 

6600
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:48,550
we would have seen it clearly by now it
would have been obvious that school

02:04:48,550 --> 02:04:48,560
would have been obvious that school

sucks and when you what everybody said

6617
02:05:08,950 --> 02:05:08,960
sucks and when you what everybody said
 

6618
02:05:08,960 --> 02:05:10,550
sucks and when you what everybody said
at the beginning that's what everybody

6619
02:05:10,550 --> 02:05:10,560
at the beginning that's what everybody
 

6620
02:05:10,560 --> 02:05:13,109
at the beginning that's what everybody
said to jensen he said well maybe these

6621
02:05:13,109 --> 02:05:13,119
said to jensen he said well maybe these
 

6622
02:05:13,119 --> 02:05:15,830
said to jensen he said well maybe these
maybe we need to start earlier maybe we

6623
02:05:15,830 --> 02:05:15,840
maybe we need to start earlier maybe we
 

6624
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:18,550
maybe we need to start earlier maybe we
need not do uh pre-kindergarten but

6625
02:05:18,550 --> 02:05:18,560
need not do uh pre-kindergarten but
 

6626
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:20,950
need not do uh pre-kindergarten but
pre-pre-kindergarten yeah it's always an

02:05:20,950 --> 02:05:20,960
pre-pre-kindergarten yeah it's always an
 

6628
02:05:20,960 --> 02:05:22,069

well maybe we didn't get it right but

6631
02:05:24,790 --> 02:05:24,800
well maybe we didn't get it right but
 

6632
02:05:24,800 --> 02:05:28,709
well maybe we didn't get it right but
after decades of trying 50 years 50 or

6633
02:05:28,709 --> 02:05:28,719
after decades of trying 50 years 50 or
 

6634
02:05:28,719 --> 02:05:30,790
after decades of trying 50 years 50 or
60 years of trying

6635
02:05:30,790 --> 02:05:30,800
60 years of trying
 

6636
02:05:30,800 --> 02:05:33,189
60 years of trying
surely something

6637
02:05:33,189 --> 02:05:33,199
surely something
 

6638
02:05:33,199 --> 02:05:34,790
surely something
would have worked to the point where you

6639
02:05:34,790 --> 02:05:34,800
would have worked to the point where you
 

6640
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:37,030
would have worked to the point where you
could actually see a result

6641
02:05:37,030 --> 02:05:37,040
could actually see a result
 

6642
02:05:37,040 --> 02:05:38,470
could actually see a result
and not need a

6643
02:05:38,470 --> 02:05:38,480
and not need a
 

6644
02:05:38,480 --> 02:05:42,310
and not need a
a probability level at .05 on some means

6645
02:05:42,310 --> 02:05:42,320
a probability level at .05 on some means
 

6646
02:05:42,320 --> 02:05:44,310
a probability level at .05 on some means
so that's why i

6647
02:05:44,310 --> 02:05:44,320
so that's why i
 

6648
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:46,149
so that's why i
that's the kind of evidence

6649
02:05:46,149 --> 02:05:46,159
that's the kind of evidence
 

6650
02:05:46,159 --> 02:05:48,550
that's the kind of evidence
that would change my mind

6651
02:05:48,550 --> 02:05:48,560
that would change my mind
 

6652
02:05:48,560 --> 02:05:50,310
that would change my mind
population level

interventions like schooling that you
 

6656
02:05:52,800 --> 02:05:54,870
interventions like schooling that you
would you would see

6657
02:05:54,870 --> 02:05:54,880
would you would see
 

6658
02:05:54,880 --> 02:05:57,750
would you would see
um like this actually has an effect yes

6659
02:05:57,750 --> 02:05:57,760
um like this actually has an effect yes
 

6660
02:05:57,760 --> 02:06:00,950
um like this actually has an effect yes
and when you take adopted kids

6661
02:06:00,950 --> 02:06:00,960
and when you take adopted kids
 

6662
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:03,990
and when you take adopted kids
and they grow up in a another family and

6663
02:06:03,990 --> 02:06:04,000
and they grow up in a another family and
 

6664
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,149
and they grow up in a another family and
you find out when those adopted kids are

6665
02:06:06,149 --> 02:06:06,159
you find out when those adopted kids are
 

6666
02:06:06,159 --> 02:06:08,470
you find out when those adopted kids are
adults their iq scores don't correlate

6667
02:06:08,470 --> 02:06:08,480
adults their iq scores don't correlate
 

6668
02:06:08,480 --> 02:06:10,550
adults their iq scores don't correlate
with the iq scores of their adoptive

6669
02:06:10,550 --> 02:06:10,560
with the iq scores of their adoptive
 

6670
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:13,350
with the iq scores of their adoptive
parents but they do correlate with their

6671
02:06:13,350 --> 02:06:13,360
parents but they do correlate with their
 

6672
02:06:13,360 --> 02:06:15,750
parents but they do correlate with their
iq scores of their biological parents

6673
02:06:15,750 --> 02:06:15,760
iq scores of their biological parents
 

6674
02:06:15,760 --> 02:06:18,709
iq scores of their biological parents
who whom they've never met

6675
02:06:18,709 --> 02:06:18,719
who whom they've never met
 

6676
02:06:18,719 --> 02:06:20,790
who whom they've never met
i mean these are important these are

6677
02:06:20,790 --> 02:06:20,800
i mean these are important these are
 

6678
02:06:20,800 --> 02:06:23,109
i mean these are important these are
powerful observations and it would be

6679
02:06:23,109 --> 02:06:23,119
powerful observations and it would be
 

6680
02:06:23,119 --> 02:06:25,189
powerful observations and it would be
convincing to you if

6681
02:06:25,189 --> 02:06:25,199
convincing to you if
 

6682
02:06:25,199 --> 02:06:27,109
convincing to you if
the reverse was true yes that would be

6683
02:06:27,109 --> 02:06:27,119
the reverse was true yes that would be
 

6684
02:06:27,119 --> 02:06:28,950
the reverse was true yes that would be
more now and there is

6685
02:06:28,950 --> 02:06:28,960
more now and there is
 

6686
02:06:28,960 --> 02:06:32,310
more now and there is
some data on adoption that indicates

6687
02:06:32,310 --> 02:06:32,320
some data on adoption that indicates
 

6688
02:06:32,320 --> 02:06:34,870
some data on adoption that indicates
that the adopted children are moving a

6689
02:06:34,870 --> 02:06:34,880
that the adopted children are moving a
 

6690
02:06:34,880 --> 02:06:36,790
that the adopted children are moving a
little bit more toward

02:06:36,790 --> 02:06:36,800
little bit more toward

this concept called the weight of
 

6700
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:47,189
this concept called the weight of

6702
02:06:47,199 --> 02:06:49,350

where i don't interpret any one study

6703
02:06:49,350 --> 02:06:49,360
where i don't interpret any one study
 

6704
02:06:49,360 --> 02:06:50,310
where i don't interpret any one study
too much

6705
02:06:50,310 --> 02:06:50,320
too much
 

6706
02:06:50,320 --> 02:06:52,310
too much
the weight of evidence tells me genes

6707
02:06:52,310 --> 02:06:52,320
the weight of evidence tells me genes
 

6708
02:06:52,320 --> 02:06:54,310
the weight of evidence tells me genes
are important but what does that mean

6709
02:06:54,310 --> 02:06:54,320
are important but what does that mean
 

6710
02:06:54,320 --> 02:06:56,149
are important but what does that mean
what does it mean that genes are

6711
02:06:56,149 --> 02:06:56,159
what does it mean that genes are
 

6712
02:06:56,159 --> 02:06:59,189
what does it mean that genes are
important knowing that gene expression

6713
02:06:59,189 --> 02:06:59,199
important knowing that gene expression
 

6714
02:06:59,199 --> 02:07:01,589
important knowing that gene expression
genes don't express themselves in a

02:07:06,880 --> 02:07:09,030
an environment so the environment has to
have something to do with it especially

02:07:09,030 --> 02:07:09,040
have something to do with it especially

02:07:09,040 --> 02:07:10,709
have something to do with it especially

6726
02:07:13,040 --> 02:07:15,430

are around 50 or even eight even if it's
 

6728
02:07:15,440 --> 02:07:18,390
are around 50 or even eight even if it's
as high as 80 percent it still leaves 20

6729
02:07:18,390 --> 02:07:18,400
as high as 80 percent it still leaves 20

6732
02:07:19,679 --> 02:07:23,109

of non-genetic now maybe that is all uh

6733
02:07:23,109 --> 02:07:23,119
of non-genetic now maybe that is all uh
 

6734
02:07:23,119 --> 02:07:23,910
of non-genetic now maybe that is all uh
luck

6735
02:07:23,910 --> 02:07:23,920
luck
 

6736
02:07:23,920 --> 02:07:26,229
luck
maybe that's all chance i could believe

6737
02:07:26,229 --> 02:07:26,239
maybe that's all chance i could believe
 

6738
02:07:26,239 --> 02:07:28,790
maybe that's all chance i could believe
that i could easily believe that

6739
02:07:28,790 --> 02:07:28,800
that i could easily believe that
 

6740
02:07:28,800 --> 02:07:31,030
that i could easily believe that
so um

6741
02:07:31,030 --> 02:07:31,040
so um
 

6742
02:07:31,040 --> 02:07:32,870
so um
but i i do think

6743
02:07:32,870 --> 02:07:32,880
but i i do think
 

6744
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:35,270
but i i do think

that has shown any impact on

6755
02:07:47,189 --> 02:07:47,199
that has shown any impact on
 

6756
02:07:47,199 --> 02:07:49,830
that has shown any impact on
intelligence test scores is there data

6757
02:07:49,830 --> 02:07:49,840
intelligence test scores is there data
 

6758
02:07:49,840 --> 02:07:53,669
intelligence test scores is there data
on the intelligence the iq

6759
02:07:53,669 --> 02:07:53,679
on the intelligence the iq
 

6760
02:07:53,679 --> 02:07:55,189
on the intelligence the iq
of parents

6761
02:07:55,189 --> 02:07:55,199
of parents
 

6762
02:07:55,199 --> 02:07:57,589
of parents
as it relates to the children yes and

6763
02:07:57,589 --> 02:07:57,599
as it relates to the children yes and
 

6764
02:07:57,599 --> 02:07:59,830
as it relates to the children yes and
there is some evident genetic evidence

6765
02:07:59,830 --> 02:07:59,840
there is some evident genetic evidence
 

6766
02:07:59,840 --> 02:08:01,510
there is some evident genetic evidence
of kind of

6767
02:08:01,510 --> 02:08:01,520
of kind of
 

6768
02:08:01,520 --> 02:08:02,390
of kind of
of

6769
02:08:02,390 --> 02:08:02,400
of
 

6770
02:08:02,400 --> 02:08:04,390
of
of an interaction

6771
02:08:04,390 --> 02:08:04,400
of an interaction
 

6772
02:08:04,400 --> 02:08:07,109
of an interaction
between the parents iq and the

6773
02:08:07,109 --> 02:08:07,119
between the parents iq and the
 

6774
02:08:07,119 --> 02:08:10,950
between the parents iq and the
environment that high iq parents provide

6775
02:08:10,950 --> 02:08:10,960
environment that high iq parents provide
 

6776
02:08:10,960 --> 02:08:13,189
environment that high iq parents provide
an enriched environment

6777
02:08:13,189 --> 02:08:13,199
an enriched environment
 

6778
02:08:13,199 --> 02:08:15,189
an enriched environment
which then can

6779
02:08:15,189 --> 02:08:15,199
which then can
 

6780
02:08:15,199 --> 02:08:17,270
which then can
impact the child in addition to the

6781
02:08:17,270 --> 02:08:17,280
impact the child in addition to the
 

6782
02:08:17,280 --> 02:08:19,189
impact the child in addition to the
genes it's that

6783
02:08:19,189 --> 02:08:19,199
genes it's that
 

6784
02:08:19,199 --> 02:08:20,790
genes it's that
environment so there are all these

6785
02:08:20,790 --> 02:08:20,800
environment so there are all these
 

6786
02:08:20,800 --> 02:08:23,669
environment so there are all these
interactions that you know um

6787
02:08:23,669 --> 02:08:23,679
interactions that you know um
 

6788
02:08:23,679 --> 02:08:25,830
interactions that you know um
but it's not you know

6789
02:08:25,830 --> 02:08:25,840
but it's not you know
 

6790
02:08:25,840 --> 02:08:27,750
but it's not you know
think about the number of books in a

6791
02:08:27,750 --> 02:08:27,760
think about the number of books in a
 

6792
02:08:27,760 --> 02:08:30,149
think about the number of books in a
household this was a variable that's

6793
02:08:30,149 --> 02:08:30,159
household this was a variable that's
 

6794
02:08:30,159 --> 02:08:31,990
household this was a variable that's
correlated with iq

6795
02:08:31,990 --> 02:08:32,000
correlated with iq
 

6796
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:36,550
correlated with iq
and and uh it is yeah well well why

6797
02:08:36,550 --> 02:08:36,560
and and uh it is yeah well well why
 

6798
02:08:36,560 --> 02:08:38,470
and and uh it is yeah well well why
especially if the kid never reads any of

6799
02:08:38,470 --> 02:08:38,480
especially if the kid never reads any of
 

6800
02:08:38,480 --> 02:08:40,790
especially if the kid never reads any of
the books it's because

6801
02:08:40,790 --> 02:08:40,800
the books it's because
 

6802
02:08:40,800 --> 02:08:42,790
the books it's because
more intelligent people

6803
02:08:42,790 --> 02:08:42,800
more intelligent people
 

6804
02:08:42,800 --> 02:08:45,270
more intelligent people
have more books in their house

6805
02:08:45,270 --> 02:08:45,280
have more books in their house
 

6806
02:08:45,280 --> 02:08:47,750
have more books in their house
and if you're more intelligent

6807
02:08:47,750 --> 02:08:47,760
and if you're more intelligent
 

6808
02:08:47,760 --> 02:08:51,189
and if you're more intelligent
and there's a genetic component to that

6809
02:08:51,189 --> 02:08:51,199
and there's a genetic component to that
 

6810
02:08:51,199 --> 02:08:53,830
and there's a genetic component to that
the child will get those genes or some

6811
02:08:53,830 --> 02:08:53,840
the child will get those genes or some
 

6812
02:08:53,840 --> 02:08:56,550
the child will get those genes or some
of those genes as well as as the

6813
02:08:56,550 --> 02:08:56,560
of those genes as well as as the
 

6814
02:08:56,560 --> 02:08:59,270
of those genes as well as as the
environment but it's not the number of

6815
02:08:59,270 --> 02:08:59,280
environment but it's not the number of
 

6816
02:08:59,280 --> 02:09:00,950
environment but it's not the number of
books in the house that

6817
02:09:00,950 --> 02:09:00,960
books in the house that
 

6818
02:09:00,960 --> 02:09:04,069
books in the house that
actually directly impacts the child so

6819
02:09:04,069 --> 02:09:04,079
actually directly impacts the child so
 

6820
02:09:04,079 --> 02:09:06,870
actually directly impacts the child so
the two scenarios on this are you find

6821
02:09:06,870 --> 02:09:06,880
the two scenarios on this are you find
 

6822
02:09:06,880 --> 02:09:08,709
the two scenarios on this are you find
that

6823
02:09:08,709 --> 02:09:08,719
that
 

6824
02:09:08,719 --> 02:09:10,790
that
and this was used to

6825
02:09:10,790 --> 02:09:10,800
and this was used to
 

6826
02:09:10,800 --> 02:09:13,589
and this was used to
get rid of the s.a.t test oh the sat

6827
02:09:13,589 --> 02:09:13,599
get rid of the s.a.t test oh the sat
 

6828
02:09:13,599 --> 02:09:15,589
get rid of the s.a.t test oh the sat
scores highly correlated with the social

6829
02:09:15,589 --> 02:09:15,599
scores highly correlated with the social
 

6830
02:09:15,599 --> 02:09:18,390
scores highly correlated with the social
economic status of the parents so all

6831
02:09:18,390 --> 02:09:18,400
economic status of the parents so all
 

6832
02:09:18,400 --> 02:09:20,069
economic status of the parents so all
you're really measuring is how rich the

6833
02:09:20,069 --> 02:09:20,079
you're really measuring is how rich the
 

6834
02:09:20,079 --> 02:09:22,149
you're really measuring is how rich the
parents are

6835
02:09:22,149 --> 02:09:22,159
parents are
 

6836
02:09:22,159 --> 02:09:26,629
parents are
okay well why are the parents rich

6837
02:09:26,629 --> 02:09:26,639

 

6838
02:09:26,639 --> 02:09:27,430

yes

6839
02:09:27,430 --> 02:09:27,440
yes
 

6840
02:09:27,440 --> 02:09:30,629
yes
and so you could the opposite

6841
02:09:30,629 --> 02:09:30,639
and so you could the opposite
 

6842
02:09:30,639 --> 02:09:31,510
and so you could the opposite
kind of

6843
02:09:31,510 --> 02:09:31,520
kind of
 

6844
02:09:31,520 --> 02:09:33,990
kind of
uh syllogism is that

6845
02:09:33,990 --> 02:09:34,000
uh syllogism is that
 

6846
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,390
uh syllogism is that
people who are very bright make more

6847
02:09:36,390 --> 02:09:36,400
people who are very bright make more
 

6848
02:09:36,400 --> 02:09:37,750
people who are very bright make more
money

6849
02:09:37,750 --> 02:09:37,760
money
 

6850
02:09:37,760 --> 02:09:39,270
money
they can afford

6851
02:09:39,270 --> 02:09:39,280
they can afford
 

6852
02:09:39,280 --> 02:09:42,310
they can afford
homes in in better neighborhoods so

6853
02:09:42,310 --> 02:09:42,320
homes in in better neighborhoods so
 

6854
02:09:42,320 --> 02:09:44,709
homes in in better neighborhoods so
their kids get better schools now the

6855
02:09:44,709 --> 02:09:44,719
their kids get better schools now the
 

6856
02:09:44,719 --> 02:09:47,510
their kids get better schools now the
kids grow up bright

6857
02:09:47,510 --> 02:09:47,520
kids grow up bright
 

6858
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:49,669
kids grow up bright
where in that chain of events does that

6859
02:09:49,669 --> 02:09:49,679
where in that chain of events does that
 

6860
02:09:49,679 --> 02:09:51,830
where in that chain of events does that
come from

6861
02:09:51,830 --> 02:09:51,840
come from
 

6862
02:09:51,840 --> 02:09:54,229
come from
well unless you have a genetically

6866
02:09:57,040 --> 02:09:59,350

where you look at siblings that have the

6867
02:09:59,350 --> 02:09:59,360
where you look at siblings that have the
 

6868
02:09:59,360 --> 02:10:01,510
where you look at siblings that have the
same biological parents and

6869
02:10:01,510 --> 02:10:01,520
same biological parents and
 

6870
02:10:01,520 --> 02:10:04,470
same biological parents and
and so on you can't really disentangle

6871
02:10:04,470 --> 02:10:04,480
and so on you can't really disentangle
 

6872
02:10:04,480 --> 02:10:05,510
and so on you can't really disentangle
all that

6873
02:10:05,510 --> 02:10:05,520
all that

02:10:05,520 --> 02:10:08,709
all that
most studies of social economic status

outcome measures
 

6898
02:10:35,040 --> 02:10:36,069
outcome measures
are

6899
02:10:36,069 --> 02:10:36,079
are
 

6900
02:10:36,079 --> 02:10:39,030
are
due to the genetic component and

6901
02:10:39,030 --> 02:10:39,040
due to the genetic component and
 

6902
02:10:39,040 --> 02:10:43,109
due to the genetic component and
sometimes the ses adds a little

6903
02:10:43,109 --> 02:10:43,119
sometimes the ses adds a little
 

6904
02:10:43,119 --> 02:10:43,990
sometimes the ses adds a little
but uh

6905
02:10:43,990 --> 02:10:44,000
but uh
 

6906
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,149
but uh
the weight of evidence is it doesn't add

6907
02:10:46,149 --> 02:10:46,159
the weight of evidence is it doesn't add
 

6908
02:10:46,159 --> 02:10:48,629
the weight of evidence is it doesn't add
very much variance to predict what's

6909
02:10:48,629 --> 02:10:48,639
very much variance to predict what's
 

6910
02:10:48,639 --> 02:10:50,390
very much variance to predict what's
going on beyond

6911
02:10:50,390 --> 02:10:50,400
going on beyond
 

6912
02:10:50,400 --> 02:10:52,390
going on beyond
the genetic variance

6913
02:10:52,390 --> 02:10:52,400
the genetic variance
 

6914
02:10:52,400 --> 02:10:55,109
the genetic variance
so when you actually look at it in in in

6915
02:10:55,109 --> 02:10:55,119
so when you actually look at it in in in
 

6916
02:10:55,119 --> 02:10:57,270
so when you actually look at it in in in
some and there aren't that many studies

6917
02:10:57,270 --> 02:10:57,280
some and there aren't that many studies
 

6918
02:10:57,280 --> 02:11:00,709
some and there aren't that many studies
that have genetically informed designs

6919
02:11:00,709 --> 02:11:00,719
that have genetically informed designs
 

6920

that have genetically informed designs
uh but when you you do see those the

6921
02:11:03,189 --> 02:11:03,199
uh but when you you do see those the
 

6922
02:11:03,199 --> 02:11:05,510
uh but when you you do see those the
genes seem to have an advantage sorry

6923
02:11:05,510 --> 02:11:05,520
genes seem to have an advantage sorry
 

6924
02:11:05,520 --> 02:11:07,189
genes seem to have an advantage sorry
for the strange questions but there's is

6925
02:11:07,189 --> 02:11:07,199
for the strange questions but there's is
 

6926
02:11:07,199 --> 02:11:08,610
for the strange questions but there's is
there a connection

6927
02:11:08,610 --> 02:11:08,620
there a connection

yes right uh
 

6964
02:11:42,320 --> 02:11:43,589
yes right uh
yeah do you have a strange answer for

6965
02:11:43,589 --> 02:11:43,599
yeah do you have a strange answer for
 

6966
02:11:43,599 --> 02:11:46,069
yeah do you have a strange answer for
that stranger the answer is there used

there were some studies that indicated

02:11:48,870 --> 02:11:48,880
there were some studies that indicated
 

6972
02:11:48,880 --> 02:11:50,790
there were some studies that indicated
the more children

6976
02:11:53,599 --> 02:11:56,550
in a family
the the firstborn children would be more

6977
02:11:56,550 --> 02:11:56,560
the the firstborn children would be more
 

6978
02:11:56,560 --> 02:11:59,350
the the firstborn children would be more
intelligent than the fourth or fifth or

it's not clear that those studies

6983
02:12:02,870 --> 02:12:02,880
it's not clear that those studies
 

6984
02:12:02,880 --> 02:12:04,149
it's not clear that those studies
hold up

6985
02:12:04,149 --> 02:12:04,159
hold up
 

6986
02:12:04,159 --> 02:12:07,270
hold up
over time and of course what you see

6987
02:12:07,270 --> 02:12:07,280
over time and of course what you see
 

6988
02:12:07,280 --> 02:12:08,310
over time and of course what you see
also

6989
02:12:08,310 --> 02:12:08,320
also
 

6990
02:12:08,320 --> 02:12:09,510
also
is that

6991
02:12:09,510 --> 02:12:09,520
is that
 

6992
02:12:09,520 --> 02:12:11,910
is that
families where there are

6993
02:12:11,910 --> 02:12:11,920
families where there are
 

6994
02:12:11,920 --> 02:12:14,629
families where there are
multiple children four five six seven

multiple children four five six seven
 

6996
02:12:14,639 --> 02:12:17,270
multiple children four five six seven
you know really big families

6997
02:12:17,270 --> 02:12:17,280
you know really big families
 

6998
02:12:17,280 --> 02:12:20,629
you know really big families
uh

02:12:20,629 --> 02:12:20,639

 

7000
02:12:20,639 --> 02:12:22,870

the social economic status of those

7001
02:12:22,870 --> 02:12:22,880
the social economic status of those
 

7002
02:12:22,880 --> 02:12:25,510
the social economic status of those
families usually in the modern age is

7003
02:12:25,510 --> 02:12:25,520
families usually in the modern age is
 

7004
02:12:25,520 --> 02:12:27,510
families usually in the modern age is
not that high

7005
02:12:27,510 --> 02:12:27,520
not that high
 

7006
02:12:27,520 --> 02:12:29,910
not that high
uh it maybe it used to be the

7007
02:12:29,910 --> 02:12:29,920
uh it maybe it used to be the
 

7008
02:12:29,920 --> 02:12:31,830
uh it maybe it used to be the
aristocracy used to have a lot of kids

7009

7010
02:12:31,840 --> 02:12:34,149

i'm not sure exactly but there there

7011
02:12:34,149 --> 02:12:34,159
i'm not sure exactly but there there
 

7012
02:12:34,159 --> 02:12:36,790
i'm not sure exactly but there there
there have been reports uh

7013
02:12:36,790 --> 02:12:36,800
there have been reports uh
 

7014
02:12:36,800 --> 02:12:38,069
there have been reports uh
of uh

7015
02:12:38,069 --> 02:12:38,079
of uh
 

7016
02:12:38,079 --> 02:12:41,830
of uh
correlations between iq and fertility

7017
02:12:41,830 --> 02:12:41,840
correlations between iq and fertility
 

7018
02:12:41,840 --> 02:12:45,109
correlations between iq and fertility
um but i'm not sure that the data are

7019
02:12:45,109 --> 02:12:45,119
um but i'm not sure that the data are
 

7020
02:12:45,119 --> 02:12:48,069
um but i'm not sure that the data are
very strong that the firstborn

7021
02:12:48,069 --> 02:12:48,079
very strong that the firstborn
 

7022
02:12:48,079 --> 02:12:50,870
very strong that the firstborn
child is always the smartest it seems

7023
02:12:50,870 --> 02:12:50,880
child is always the smartest it seems
 

7024
02:12:50,880 --> 02:12:52,950
child is always the smartest it seems
like there's some data to that but i'm

7025
02:12:52,950 --> 02:12:52,960
like there's some data to that but i'm
 

7026
02:12:52,960 --> 02:12:54,790
like there's some data to that but i'm
not current on that

7027
02:12:54,790 --> 02:12:54,800
not current on that
 

7028
02:12:54,800 --> 02:12:56,229
not current on that
how would that be explained that would

7029
02:12:56,229 --> 02:12:56,239
how would that be explained that would
 

7030
02:12:56,239 --> 02:12:58,550
how would that be explained that would
be an uh a nurture

7031
02:12:58,550 --> 02:12:58,560
be an uh a nurture
 

7032
02:12:58,560 --> 02:13:00,870
be an uh a nurture
well it could be nurture it could be in

7033
02:13:00,870 --> 02:13:00,880
well it could be nurture it could be in
 

7034
02:13:00,880 --> 02:13:04,390
well it could be nurture it could be in

biology is complicated
 

7038
02:13:07,440 --> 02:13:09,910
biology is complicated
and this is why this you know

7039
02:13:09,910 --> 02:13:09,920
and this is why this you know
 

7040
02:13:09,920 --> 02:13:12,629
and this is why this you know
like many areas of science you you said

7041
02:13:12,629 --> 02:13:12,639
like many areas of science you you said
 

7042
02:13:12,639 --> 02:13:14,870
like many areas of science you you said
earlier that there are a lot of gray

7043
02:13:14,870 --> 02:13:14,880
earlier that there are a lot of gray
 

7044
02:13:14,880 --> 02:13:17,109
earlier that there are a lot of gray
areas and

7045
02:13:17,109 --> 02:13:17,119
areas and
 

7046
02:13:17,119 --> 02:13:21,350

02:13:21,360 --> 02:13:24,310

this is not uncommon in science that the

this is not uncommon in science that the
 

7050
02:13:24,320 --> 02:13:26,229
this is not uncommon in science that the

because the universe is complicated
 

7060
02:13:35,520 --> 02:13:38,790
because the universe is complicated
and the idea that we have people on this

the big bang
 

7068
02:13:45,599 --> 02:13:47,669
the big bang
that's pretty amazing

7069
02:13:47,669 --> 02:13:47,679
that's pretty amazing
 

7070
02:13:47,679 --> 02:13:50,229
that's pretty amazing
and i've always said that if they can

7071
02:13:50,229 --> 02:13:50,239
and i've always said that if they can
 

7072
02:13:50,239 --> 02:13:51,510
and i've always said that if they can
study the first

nanoseconds of the big bang we can
 

7076
02:13:53,360 --> 02:13:55,589
nanoseconds of the big bang we can
certainly figure out something about

7077

certainly figure out something about
 

7078
02:13:55,599 --> 02:13:57,109
certainly figure out something about

that allows that
i'm not sure what's more complicated the

i'm not sure what's more complicated the
 

7084

i'm not sure what's more complicated the

7088
02:14:05,199 --> 02:14:08,069
universe
uh it's unclear to me

7089
02:14:08,069 --> 02:14:08,079
uh it's unclear to me
 

7090
02:14:08,079 --> 02:14:09,510
uh it's unclear to me
i think we over

7091
02:14:09,510 --> 02:14:09,520
i think we over
 

7092
02:14:09,520 --> 02:14:12,790
i think we over
a very humbling statement

7093
02:14:12,790 --> 02:14:12,800
a very humbling statement
 

7094
02:14:12,800 --> 02:14:14,470
a very humbling statement
maybe it's very human-centric

7095
02:14:14,470 --> 02:14:14,480
maybe it's very human-centric
 

7096
02:14:14,480 --> 02:14:16,390
maybe it's very human-centric
egotistical statement that our mind is

7097
02:14:16,390 --> 02:14:16,400
egotistical statement that our mind is
 

7098
02:14:16,400 --> 02:14:19,030
egotistical statement that our mind is
somehow super complicated but biology is

7099
02:14:19,030 --> 02:14:19,040
somehow super complicated but biology is
 

7100
02:14:19,040 --> 02:14:20,950
somehow super complicated but biology is
a tricky one to

7101
02:14:20,950 --> 02:14:20,960
a tricky one to
 

7102
02:14:20,960 --> 02:14:24,390
a tricky one to
unravel consciousness

7103
02:14:24,390 --> 02:14:24,400
unravel consciousness
 

7104
02:14:24,400 --> 02:14:27,910
unravel consciousness
what is that well i i've always believed

7105
02:14:27,910 --> 02:14:27,920
what is that well i i've always believed
 

7106
02:14:27,920 --> 02:14:30,310
what is that well i i've always believed
that consciousness and intelligence are

7107
02:14:30,310 --> 02:14:30,320
that consciousness and intelligence are
 

7108
02:14:30,320 --> 02:14:31,669
that consciousness and intelligence are
the two

7109
02:14:31,669 --> 02:14:31,679
the two
 

7110
02:14:31,679 --> 02:14:33,430
the two
real

7111
02:14:33,430 --> 02:14:33,440
real
 

7112
02:14:33,440 --> 02:14:36,310
real
fundamental problems of the human brain

7113
02:14:36,310 --> 02:14:36,320
fundamental problems of the human brain
 

7114
02:14:36,320 --> 02:14:39,270
fundamental problems of the human brain
and i and i and therefore i think they

7115
02:14:39,270 --> 02:14:39,280
and i and i and therefore i think they
 

7116
02:14:39,280 --> 02:14:42,790
and i and i and therefore i think they
must be related

7117
02:14:42,790 --> 02:14:42,800

 

7118
02:14:42,800 --> 02:14:45,589

uh yeah and heart problems like uh walk

7119
02:14:45,589 --> 02:14:45,599
uh yeah and heart problems like uh walk
 

7120
02:14:45,599 --> 02:14:48,069
uh yeah and heart problems like uh walk
together holding hands kind of kind of

7121
02:14:48,069 --> 02:14:48,079
together holding hands kind of kind of
 

7122
02:14:48,079 --> 02:14:50,310
together holding hands kind of kind of
kind of idea you may not know this but i

7123
02:14:50,310 --> 02:14:50,320
kind of idea you may not know this but i
 

7124
02:14:50,320 --> 02:14:52,550
kind of idea you may not know this but i
i did some of the early research on

7125
02:14:52,550 --> 02:14:52,560
i did some of the early research on
 

7126
02:14:52,560 --> 02:14:54,709
i did some of the early research on
anesthetic drugs with brain imaging

7127
02:14:54,709 --> 02:14:54,719
anesthetic drugs with brain imaging
 

7128
02:14:54,719 --> 02:14:56,870
anesthetic drugs with brain imaging
trying to answer the question what part

7129
02:14:56,870 --> 02:14:56,880
trying to answer the question what part
 

7130
02:14:56,880 --> 02:14:58,870
trying to answer the question what part
of the brain is the last to turn off

7131
02:14:58,870 --> 02:14:58,880
of the brain is the last to turn off
 

7132
02:14:58,880 --> 02:15:01,270
of the brain is the last to turn off
when someone loses consciousness

7133
02:15:01,270 --> 02:15:01,280
when someone loses consciousness
 

7134
02:15:01,280 --> 02:15:02,870
when someone loses consciousness
and is that the first part of the brain

7135
02:15:02,870 --> 02:15:02,880
and is that the first part of the brain
 

7136
02:15:02,880 --> 02:15:04,310
and is that the first part of the brain
to turn on

7137
02:15:04,310 --> 02:15:04,320
to turn on
 

7138
02:15:04,320 --> 02:15:06,790
to turn on
when consciousness is regained

02:15:06,790 --> 02:15:06,800
when consciousness is regained
 

7140
02:15:06,800 --> 02:15:07,870
when consciousness is regained
and i was working with an

7141
02:15:07,870 --> 02:15:07,880
and i was working with an
 

7142
02:15:07,880 --> 02:15:10,149
and i was working with an
anesthesiologist named mike alkire who

7143
02:15:10,149 --> 02:15:10,159
anesthesiologist named mike alkire who
 

7144
02:15:10,159 --> 02:15:12,069
anesthesiologist named mike alkire who
was really brilliant at this these were

7145
02:15:12,069 --> 02:15:12,079
was really brilliant at this these were
 

7146
02:15:12,079 --> 02:15:14,069
was really brilliant at this these were
really the first studies of brain

7147
02:15:14,069 --> 02:15:14,079
really the first studies of brain
 

7148
02:15:14,079 --> 02:15:16,629
really the first studies of brain

long before uh fmri
and you would inject a radioactive sugar

7155
02:15:25,510 --> 02:15:25,520
and you would inject a radioactive sugar
 

7156
02:15:25,520 --> 02:15:27,750
and you would inject a radioactive sugar
that labeled the brain and the harder

7157
02:15:27,750 --> 02:15:27,760
that labeled the brain and the harder
 

7158
02:15:27,760 --> 02:15:29,589
that labeled the brain and the harder
the brain was working the more sugar it

7159
02:15:29,589 --> 02:15:29,599
the brain was working the more sugar it
 

7160
02:15:29,599 --> 02:15:31,669
the brain was working the more sugar it
would take up and then you could make a

7161
02:15:31,669 --> 02:15:31,679
would take up and then you could make a
 

7162
02:15:31,679 --> 02:15:33,430
would take up and then you could make a

he he was amazing he managed to do this

7167
02:15:40,149 --> 02:15:40,159
he he was amazing he managed to do this
 

7168
02:15:40,159 --> 02:15:42,870
he he was amazing he managed to do this
in normal volunteers he brought in

7169
02:15:42,870 --> 02:15:42,880
in normal volunteers he brought in
 

7170
02:15:42,880 --> 02:15:45,430
in normal volunteers he brought in
and anesthetized as if they were going

7171
02:15:45,430 --> 02:15:45,440
and anesthetized as if they were going
 

7172
02:15:45,440 --> 02:15:48,629
and anesthetized as if they were going
into surgery

7173
02:15:48,629 --> 02:15:48,639

 

7174
02:15:48,639 --> 02:15:50,629

and he managed all the human subjects

7175
02:15:50,629 --> 02:15:50,639
and he managed all the human subjects
 

7176
02:15:50,639 --> 02:15:52,950

requirements on this research
 

7178
02:15:52,960 --> 02:15:56,069
requirements on this research
and uh it was he was brilliant at this

7179
02:15:56,069 --> 02:15:56,079
and uh it was he was brilliant at this
 

7180
02:15:56,079 --> 02:15:56,790
and uh it was he was brilliant at this
and

7181
02:15:56,790 --> 02:15:56,800
and
 

7182
02:15:56,800 --> 02:15:57,990
and
and

7183
02:15:57,990 --> 02:15:58,000
and
 

7184
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:01,589
and
what we did is we had these normal

7185
02:16:01,589 --> 02:16:01,599
what we did is we had these normal
 

7186
02:16:01,599 --> 02:16:04,870
what we did is we had these normal
volunteers come in on three occasions

7187
02:16:04,870 --> 02:16:04,880
volunteers come in on three occasions
 

7188
02:16:04,880 --> 02:16:06,870
volunteers come in on three occasions
on one occasion he gave them enough

7189
02:16:06,870 --> 02:16:06,880
on one occasion he gave them enough
 

7190
02:16:06,880 --> 02:16:09,510
on one occasion he gave them enough
anesthetic drug

7191
02:16:09,510 --> 02:16:09,520
anesthetic drug
 

7192
02:16:09,520 --> 02:16:11,750
anesthetic drug
so they were

7193
02:16:11,750 --> 02:16:11,760
so they were
 

7194
02:16:11,760 --> 02:16:14,470
so they were
a little drowsy

7195
02:16:14,470 --> 02:16:14,480
a little drowsy
 

7196
02:16:14,480 --> 02:16:16,790
a little drowsy
and on another occasion they came in and

7197
02:16:16,790 --> 02:16:16,800
and on another occasion they came in and
 

7198
02:16:16,800 --> 02:16:20,149
and on another occasion they came in and
he fully anesthetized them

7199
02:16:20,149 --> 02:16:20,159
he fully anesthetized them
 

7200
02:16:20,159 --> 02:16:22,550
he fully anesthetized them
and you know he would say

7201
02:16:22,550 --> 02:16:22,560
and you know he would say
 

7202
02:16:22,560 --> 02:16:23,750
and you know he would say
you know

7203
02:16:23,750 --> 02:16:23,760
you know
 

7204
02:16:23,760 --> 02:16:25,750
you know
mike can you can you hear me

7205
02:16:25,750 --> 02:16:25,760
mike can you can you hear me
 

7206
02:16:25,760 --> 02:16:28,790
mike can you can you hear me
and the person would say uh

7207
02:16:28,790 --> 02:16:28,800
and the person would say uh
 

7208
02:16:28,800 --> 02:16:30,390
and the person would say uh
yeah

7209
02:16:30,390 --> 02:16:30,400
yeah
 

7210
02:16:30,400 --> 02:16:32,469
yeah
you know that's him and then

7211
02:16:32,469 --> 02:16:32,479
you know that's him and then
 

7212
02:16:32,479 --> 02:16:34,870
you know that's him and then
that we would scan people under the and

7213
02:16:34,870 --> 02:16:34,880
that we would scan people under the and
 

7214
02:16:34,880 --> 02:16:35,990
that we would scan people under the and
under uh

7215
02:16:35,990 --> 02:16:36,000
under uh
 

7216
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:39,429
under uh
no anesthetic condition so same person

7217
02:16:39,429 --> 02:16:39,439
no anesthetic condition so same person
 

7218
02:16:39,439 --> 02:16:41,990
no anesthetic condition so same person
and um we were looking to see if we

7219
02:16:41,990 --> 02:16:42,000
and um we were looking to see if we
 

7220
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:43,349
and um we were looking to see if we
could see

7221
02:16:43,349 --> 02:16:43,359
could see
 

7222
02:16:43,359 --> 02:16:45,270
could see
the part of the brain

7223
02:16:45,270 --> 02:16:45,280
the part of the brain
 

7224
02:16:45,280 --> 02:16:46,549
the part of the brain
turn off

7225
02:16:46,549 --> 02:16:46,559
turn off
 

7226
02:16:46,559 --> 02:16:48,389
turn off
you subsequently tried to do this with

7227
02:16:48,389 --> 02:16:48,399
you subsequently tried to do this with
 

7228
02:16:48,399 --> 02:16:51,589
you subsequently tried to do this with
fmri which has a faster time resolution

7229
02:16:51,589 --> 02:16:51,599
fmri which has a faster time resolution
 

7230
02:16:51,599 --> 02:16:53,509
fmri which has a faster time resolution
and you could do it in real time as the

7231
02:16:53,509 --> 02:16:53,519
and you could do it in real time as the
 

7232
02:16:53,519 --> 02:16:55,910
and you could do it in real time as the
person went under and then regained

7233
02:16:55,910 --> 02:16:55,920
person went under and then regained
 

7234
02:16:55,920 --> 02:16:57,349
person went under and then regained
consciousness where you couldn't do that

7235
02:16:57,349 --> 02:16:57,359
consciousness where you couldn't do that
 

7236
02:16:57,359 --> 02:17:00,230
consciousness where you couldn't do that
with pet you had to have three test

7237
02:17:00,230 --> 02:17:00,240
with pet you had to have three test
 

7238
02:17:00,240 --> 02:17:01,110
with pet you had to have three test
and

7239
02:17:01,110 --> 02:17:01,120
and
 

7240
02:17:01,120 --> 02:17:03,190
and
the results were absolutely fascinating

7241
02:17:03,190 --> 02:17:03,200
the results were absolutely fascinating
 

7242
02:17:03,200 --> 02:17:04,790
the results were absolutely fascinating
we did this with different anesthetic

7243
02:17:04,790 --> 02:17:04,800
we did this with different anesthetic
 

7244
02:17:04,800 --> 02:17:05,830
we did this with different anesthetic
drugs

7245
02:17:05,830 --> 02:17:05,840
drugs
 

7246
02:17:05,840 --> 02:17:08,230
drugs
and different drugs impacted different

7247
02:17:08,230 --> 02:17:08,240
and different drugs impacted different
 

7248
02:17:08,240 --> 02:17:10,709
and different drugs impacted different
parts of the brain so we were naturally

7249
02:17:10,709 --> 02:17:10,719
parts of the brain so we were naturally
 

7250
02:17:10,719 --> 02:17:13,830
parts of the brain so we were naturally
looking for the common

7251
02:17:13,830 --> 02:17:13,840
looking for the common
 

7252
02:17:13,840 --> 02:17:15,750
looking for the common
and it seemed to have something to do

7253
02:17:15,750 --> 02:17:15,760
and it seemed to have something to do
 

7254
02:17:15,760 --> 02:17:17,750
and it seemed to have something to do
with the thalamus

7255
02:17:17,750 --> 02:17:17,760
with the thalamus
 

7256
02:17:17,760 --> 02:17:21,429
with the thalamus
and consciousness this was actual data

7257
02:17:21,429 --> 02:17:21,439
and consciousness this was actual data
 

7258
02:17:21,439 --> 02:17:23,589
and consciousness this was actual data
unconsciousness

7259
02:17:23,589 --> 02:17:23,599
unconsciousness
 

7260
02:17:23,599 --> 02:17:25,910
unconsciousness
real con actual consciousness what part

7261
02:17:25,910 --> 02:17:25,920
real con actual consciousness what part
 

7262
02:17:25,920 --> 02:17:28,549
real con actual consciousness what part
of the brain turns on uh what part of

7263
02:17:28,549 --> 02:17:28,559
of the brain turns on uh what part of
 

7264
02:17:28,559 --> 02:17:30,629
of the brain turns on uh what part of
the brain turns off

7265
02:17:30,629 --> 02:17:30,639
the brain turns off
 

7266
02:17:30,639 --> 02:17:32,950
the brain turns off
it's not so clear

7267
02:17:32,950 --> 02:17:32,960
it's not so clear
 

7268
02:17:32,960 --> 02:17:34,709
it's not so clear
but maybe has something to do with the

7269
02:17:34,709 --> 02:17:34,719
but maybe has something to do with the
 

7270
02:17:34,719 --> 02:17:36,950
but maybe has something to do with the
thelma the the the sequence of events

7271
02:17:36,950 --> 02:17:36,960
thelma the the the sequence of events
 

7272
02:17:36,960 --> 02:17:40,950
thelma the the the sequence of events
seem to have the thalamus in it boy um

7273
02:17:40,950 --> 02:17:40,960
seem to have the thalamus in it boy um
 

7274
02:17:40,960 --> 02:17:42,469
seem to have the thalamus in it boy um
now here's the question

7275
02:17:42,469 --> 02:17:42,479
now here's the question
 

7276
02:17:42,479 --> 02:17:44,230
now here's the question
are some people more conscious than

7277
02:17:44,230 --> 02:17:44,240
are some people more conscious than
 

7278
02:17:44,240 --> 02:17:45,509
are some people more conscious than
others

7279
02:17:45,509 --> 02:17:45,519
others
 

7280
02:17:45,519 --> 02:17:47,669
others
are there individual differences in

7281
02:17:47,669 --> 02:17:47,679
are there individual differences in
 

7282
02:17:47,679 --> 02:17:49,349
are there individual differences in
consciousness

7283
02:17:49,349 --> 02:17:49,359
consciousness
 

7284
02:17:49,359 --> 02:17:51,669
consciousness
and i don't mean it in the um

7285
02:17:51,669 --> 02:17:51,679
and i don't mean it in the um
 

7286
02:17:51,679 --> 02:17:53,910
and i don't mean it in the um
psychedelic sense i don't mean it in the

7287
02:17:53,910 --> 02:17:53,920
psychedelic sense i don't mean it in the
 

7288
02:17:53,920 --> 02:17:55,910
psychedelic sense i don't mean it in the
political consciousness sense i just

7289
02:17:55,910 --> 02:17:55,920
political consciousness sense i just
 

7290
02:17:55,920 --> 02:17:58,150
political consciousness sense i just
mean it in everyday life to some people

7291
02:17:58,150 --> 02:17:58,160
mean it in everyday life to some people
 

7292
02:17:58,160 --> 02:18:00,629
mean it in everyday life to some people
go through everyday life more conscious

7293
02:18:00,629 --> 02:18:00,639
go through everyday life more conscious
 

7294
02:18:00,639 --> 02:18:02,870
go through everyday life more conscious
than others and are those the people we

7295
02:18:02,870 --> 02:18:02,880
than others and are those the people we
 

7296
02:18:02,880 --> 02:18:05,910
than others and are those the people we
might actually label more intelligent

7297
02:18:05,910 --> 02:18:05,920
might actually label more intelligent
 

7298
02:18:05,920 --> 02:18:08,870
might actually label more intelligent
so now the other thing i was looking for

7299
02:18:08,870 --> 02:18:08,880
so now the other thing i was looking for
 

7300
02:18:08,880 --> 02:18:10,709
so now the other thing i was looking for
is whether the parts of the brain we

7301
02:18:10,709 --> 02:18:10,719
is whether the parts of the brain we
 

7302
02:18:10,719 --> 02:18:13,509
is whether the parts of the brain we
were seeing in the anesthesia studies

7303
02:18:13,509 --> 02:18:13,519
were seeing in the anesthesia studies
 

7304
02:18:13,519 --> 02:18:15,190
were seeing in the anesthesia studies
were the same parts of the brain we were

7305
02:18:15,190 --> 02:18:15,200
were the same parts of the brain we were
 

7306
02:18:15,200 --> 02:18:17,589
were the same parts of the brain we were
seeing in the intelligence studies

7307
02:18:17,589 --> 02:18:17,599
seeing in the intelligence studies
 

7308
02:18:17,599 --> 02:18:20,309
seeing in the intelligence studies
now this is you know this was very

7309
02:18:20,309 --> 02:18:20,319
now this is you know this was very
 

7310
02:18:20,319 --> 02:18:22,790
now this is you know this was very
complicated expensive research we didn't

7311
02:18:22,790 --> 02:18:22,800
complicated expensive research we didn't
 

7312
02:18:22,800 --> 02:18:24,549
complicated expensive research we didn't
really have funding to do this we were

7313
02:18:24,549 --> 02:18:24,559
really have funding to do this we were
 

7314
02:18:24,559 --> 02:18:26,950
really have funding to do this we were
trying to do it on the fly i'm not sure

7315
02:18:26,950 --> 02:18:26,960
trying to do it on the fly i'm not sure
 

7316
02:18:26,960 --> 02:18:29,750
trying to do it on the fly i'm not sure
anybody has pursued this you know i i'm

7317
02:18:29,750 --> 02:18:29,760
anybody has pursued this you know i i'm
 

7318
02:18:29,760 --> 02:18:32,549
anybody has pursued this you know i i'm
retired now uh he's gone on to other

7319
02:18:32,549 --> 02:18:32,559
retired now uh he's gone on to other
 

7320
02:18:32,559 --> 02:18:33,830
retired now uh he's gone on to other
things

7321
02:18:33,830 --> 02:18:33,840
things
 

7322
02:18:33,840 --> 02:18:35,830
things
but it's i think it's an area of

7323
02:18:35,830 --> 02:18:35,840
but it's i think it's an area of
 

7324
02:18:35,840 --> 02:18:37,910
but it's i think it's an area of
research that that would be fascinating

7325
02:18:37,910 --> 02:18:37,920
research that that would be fascinating
 

7326
02:18:37,920 --> 02:18:39,509
research that that would be fascinating
to see

7327
02:18:39,509 --> 02:18:39,519
to see
 

7328
02:18:39,519 --> 02:18:41,190
to see
the parts and there are a lot more

7329
02:18:41,190 --> 02:18:41,200
the parts and there are a lot more
 

7330
02:18:41,200 --> 02:18:43,190
the parts and there are a lot more
imaging studies now of consciousness i'm

7331
02:18:43,190 --> 02:18:43,200
imaging studies now of consciousness i'm
 

7332
02:18:43,200 --> 02:18:45,830
imaging studies now of consciousness i'm
just not up on them so but basically the

7333
02:18:45,830 --> 02:18:45,840
just not up on them so but basically the
 

7334
02:18:45,840 --> 02:18:48,629
just not up on them so but basically the
question is which imaging so newer

7335
02:18:48,629 --> 02:18:48,639
question is which imaging so newer
 

7336
02:18:48,639 --> 02:18:50,070
question is which imaging so newer
imaging studies

7337
02:18:50,070 --> 02:18:50,080
imaging studies
 

7338
02:18:50,080 --> 02:18:51,030
imaging studies
to see

7339
02:18:51,030 --> 02:18:51,040
to see
 

7340
02:18:51,040 --> 02:18:53,429
to see
in high resolution spatial and temporal

7341
02:18:53,429 --> 02:18:53,439
in high resolution spatial and temporal
 

7342
02:18:53,439 --> 02:18:57,349
in high resolution spatial and temporal
way which part of the brain lights up

7343
02:18:57,349 --> 02:18:57,359
way which part of the brain lights up
 

7344
02:18:57,359 --> 02:19:00,070
way which part of the brain lights up
uh when you're doing intelligence tasks

7345
02:19:00,070 --> 02:19:00,080
uh when you're doing intelligence tasks
 

7346
02:19:00,080 --> 02:19:01,990
uh when you're doing intelligence tasks
and which parts of the brain lights up

7347
02:19:01,990 --> 02:19:02,000
and which parts of the brain lights up
 

7348
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:03,509
and which parts of the brain lights up
when you're doing consciousness tasks

7349
02:19:03,509 --> 02:19:03,519
when you're doing consciousness tasks
 

7350
02:19:03,519 --> 02:19:05,669
when you're doing consciousness tasks
and see the interplay between them you

7351
02:19:05,669 --> 02:19:05,679
and see the interplay between them you
 

7352
02:19:05,679 --> 02:19:07,669
and see the interplay between them you
try to infer that's the challenge of

7353
02:19:07,669 --> 02:19:07,679
try to infer that's the challenge of
 

7354
02:19:07,679 --> 02:19:08,950
try to infer that's the challenge of
neuroscience

7355
02:19:08,950 --> 02:19:08,960
neuroscience
 

7356
02:19:08,960 --> 02:19:12,469
neuroscience
without understanding deeply

7357
02:19:12,469 --> 02:19:12,479
without understanding deeply
 

7358
02:19:12,479 --> 02:19:15,429
without understanding deeply
looking from the outside try to infer

7359
02:19:15,429 --> 02:19:15,439
looking from the outside try to infer
 

7360
02:19:15,439 --> 02:19:17,190
looking from the outside try to infer
something about

7361
02:19:17,190 --> 02:19:17,200
something about
 

7362
02:19:17,200 --> 02:19:19,589
something about
uh how the whole thing works

7363
02:19:19,589 --> 02:19:19,599
uh how the whole thing works
 

7364
02:19:19,599 --> 02:19:21,589
uh how the whole thing works
well imagine this here's a simple

7365
02:19:21,589 --> 02:19:21,599
well imagine this here's a simple
 

7366
02:19:21,599 --> 02:19:22,870
well imagine this here's a simple
question

7367
02:19:22,870 --> 02:19:22,880
question
 

7368
02:19:22,880 --> 02:19:26,469
question
does it take more anesthetic drug

7369
02:19:26,469 --> 02:19:26,479
does it take more anesthetic drug
 

7370
02:19:26,479 --> 02:19:27,750
does it take more anesthetic drug
to put

7371
02:19:27,750 --> 02:19:27,760
to put
 

7372
02:19:27,760 --> 02:19:31,110
to put
to to have a person lose consciousness

7373
02:19:31,110 --> 02:19:31,120
to to have a person lose consciousness
 

7374
02:19:31,120 --> 02:19:35,030
to to have a person lose consciousness
consciousness if their iq is 140

7375
02:19:35,030 --> 02:19:35,040
consciousness if their iq is 140
 

7376
02:19:35,040 --> 02:19:38,709
consciousness if their iq is 140
then a person with an iq of 70.

7377
02:19:38,709 --> 02:19:38,719
then a person with an iq of 70.
 

7378
02:19:38,719 --> 02:19:40,469
then a person with an iq of 70.
that's an interesting way to study it

7379
02:19:40,469 --> 02:19:40,479
that's an interesting way to study it
 

7380
02:19:40,479 --> 02:19:43,429
that's an interesting way to study it
yeah i mean if there is if there is

7381
02:19:43,429 --> 02:19:43,439
yeah i mean if there is if there is
 

7382
02:19:43,439 --> 02:19:46,070
yeah i mean if there is if there is
a yeah if the answer to that this is a

7383
02:19:46,070 --> 02:19:46,080
a yeah if the answer to that this is a
 

7384
02:19:46,080 --> 02:19:48,309
a yeah if the answer to that this is a
stable yes that's very interesting so i

7385
02:19:48,309 --> 02:19:48,319
stable yes that's very interesting so i
 

7386
02:19:48,319 --> 02:19:50,070
stable yes that's very interesting so i
tried to find out

7387
02:19:50,070 --> 02:19:50,080
tried to find out
 

7388
02:19:50,080 --> 02:19:52,389
tried to find out
and i went to some anesthesiology

7389
02:19:52,389 --> 02:19:52,399
and i went to some anesthesiology
 

7390
02:19:52,399 --> 02:19:55,590
and i went to some anesthesiology
textbooks about how you you dose

7391
02:19:55,590 --> 02:19:55,600
textbooks about how you you dose
 

7392
02:19:55,600 --> 02:19:59,110
textbooks about how you you dose
and they dose by weight

7393
02:19:59,110 --> 02:19:59,120

 

7394
02:19:59,120 --> 02:20:00,070

and

7395
02:20:00,070 --> 02:20:00,080
and
 

7396
02:20:00,080 --> 02:20:03,110
and
what i also learned this is a

7397
02:20:03,110 --> 02:20:03,120
what i also learned this is a
 

7398
02:20:03,120 --> 02:20:05,270
what i also learned this is a
little bit off subject

7399
02:20:05,270 --> 02:20:05,280
little bit off subject
 

7400
02:20:05,280 --> 02:20:06,950
little bit off subject
anesthesiologists

7401
02:20:06,950 --> 02:20:06,960
anesthesiologists
 

7402
02:20:06,960 --> 02:20:09,910
anesthesiologists
are never sure if you how deep you are

7403
02:20:09,910 --> 02:20:09,920
are never sure if you how deep you are
 

7404
02:20:09,920 --> 02:20:12,070
are never sure if you how deep you are
yeah and they usually

7405
02:20:12,070 --> 02:20:12,080
yeah and they usually
 

7406
02:20:12,080 --> 02:20:13,750
yeah and they usually
tell by poking you with a needle and if

7407
02:20:13,750 --> 02:20:13,760
tell by poking you with a needle and if
 

7408
02:20:13,760 --> 02:20:15,190
tell by poking you with a needle and if
you don't jump they tell the surgeon to

7409
02:20:15,190 --> 02:20:15,200
you don't jump they tell the surgeon to
 

7410
02:20:15,200 --> 02:20:16,950
you don't jump they tell the surgeon to
go ahead

7411
02:20:16,950 --> 02:20:16,960
go ahead
 

7412
02:20:16,960 --> 02:20:18,389
go ahead
i'm not sure that's

7413
02:20:18,389 --> 02:20:18,399
i'm not sure that's

02:23:17,910 --> 02:23:17,920
almost like uh cute formulation of
 

7580
02:23:17,920 --> 02:23:20,790
almost like uh cute formulation of
intelligence

7581
02:23:20,790 --> 02:23:20,800

 

7582
02:23:20,800 --> 02:23:22,070

that

7583
02:23:22,070 --> 02:23:22,080
that
 

7584
02:23:22,080 --> 02:23:24,230
that
alan turing proposed basically

02:23:26,309 --> 02:23:26,319
conversation being if you can fool a
 

7588
02:23:26,319 --> 02:23:28,309
conversation being if you can fool a
human to think

7589
02:23:28,309 --> 02:23:28,319
human to think
 

7590
02:23:28,319 --> 02:23:31,190
human to think
that

7591
02:23:31,190 --> 02:23:31,200

 

7592
02:23:31,200 --> 02:23:34,230

a machine is is a human that passes the

a machine is is a human that passes the
 

7594
02:23:34,240 --> 02:23:36,150
a machine is is a human that passes the
test i suppose you could do a similar

7595
02:23:36,150 --> 02:23:36,160
test i suppose you could do a similar
 

7596
02:23:36,160 --> 02:23:37,910
test i suppose you could do a similar
thing

7597
02:23:37,910 --> 02:23:37,920
thing
 

7598
02:23:37,920 --> 02:23:39,030
thing
um

7599
02:23:39,030 --> 02:23:39,040
um
 

7600
02:23:39,040 --> 02:23:40,389
um
for humans

7601
02:23:40,389 --> 02:23:40,399
for humans
 

7602
02:23:40,399 --> 02:23:44,389
for humans
if i can fool you that i'm intelligent

7603
02:23:44,389 --> 02:23:44,399
if i can fool you that i'm intelligent
 

7604
02:23:44,399 --> 02:23:46,630
if i can fool you that i'm intelligent
then that's a good test of intelligence

7605
02:23:46,630 --> 02:23:46,640
then that's a good test of intelligence
 

7606
02:23:46,640 --> 02:23:47,510
then that's a good test of intelligence
right

7607
02:23:47,510 --> 02:23:47,520
right
 

7608
02:23:47,520 --> 02:23:49,349
right
like uh you're you're talking to two

7609
02:23:49,349 --> 02:23:49,359
like uh you're you're talking to two
 

7610
02:23:49,359 --> 02:23:52,790
like uh you're you're talking to two
people

7611
02:23:52,790 --> 02:23:52,800

 

7612
02:23:52,800 --> 02:23:53,990

and

7613
02:23:53,990 --> 02:23:54,000
and
 

7614
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:55,190
and
my

7615

my
 

7616
02:23:55,200 --> 02:23:58,230
my
your your your the test is saying

7617
02:23:58,230 --> 02:23:58,240
your your your the test is saying
 

7618
02:23:58,240 --> 02:24:01,030
your your your the test is saying
who has a higher iq

7619
02:24:01,030 --> 02:24:01,040
who has a higher iq
 

7620
02:24:01,040 --> 02:24:03,590
who has a higher iq
and uh it's an interesting test because

7621
02:24:03,590 --> 02:24:03,600
and uh it's an interesting test because
 

7622
02:24:03,600 --> 02:24:06,150
and uh it's an interesting test because
yeah maybe charisma can be very useful

7623
02:24:06,150 --> 02:24:06,160
yeah maybe charisma can be very useful
 

7624
02:24:06,160 --> 02:24:08,389
yeah maybe charisma can be very useful
there uh and you're only allowed to use

7625
02:24:08,389 --> 02:24:08,399
there uh and you're only allowed to use

conversation which is the formulation of

7627
02:24:10,230 --> 02:24:10,240
conversation which is the formulation of
 

7628
02:24:10,240 --> 02:24:12,830
conversation which is the formulation of
the turing test anyway all that to say

7629
02:24:12,830 --> 02:24:12,840
the turing test anyway all that to say
 

7630
02:24:12,840 --> 02:24:15,910
the turing test anyway all that to say
is what are good tests of intelligence

7631
02:24:15,910 --> 02:24:15,920
is what are good tests of intelligence
 

7632
02:24:15,920 --> 02:24:17,190
is what are good tests of intelligence
for machines

7633
02:24:17,190 --> 02:24:17,200
for machines
 

7634
02:24:17,200 --> 02:24:19,510
for machines
you know we uh what do you think it

7635
02:24:19,510 --> 02:24:19,520
you know we uh what do you think it
 

7636
02:24:19,520 --> 02:24:21,190
you know we uh what do you think it
takes to achieve human level

7637
02:24:21,190 --> 02:24:21,200
takes to achieve human level
 

7638
02:24:21,200 --> 02:24:23,030
takes to achieve human level
intelligence for machines

7639
02:24:23,030 --> 02:24:23,040
intelligence for machines
 

7640
02:24:23,040 --> 02:24:25,110
intelligence for machines
well i have thought a little bit about

7641
02:24:25,110 --> 02:24:25,120
well i have thought a little bit about
 

7642
02:24:25,120 --> 02:24:27,349
well i have thought a little bit about
this but you know i

7643
02:24:27,349 --> 02:24:27,359
this but you know i
 

7644
02:24:27,359 --> 02:24:29,750
this but you know i
every time i i think about these things

7645
02:24:29,750 --> 02:24:29,760
every time i i think about these things
 

7646
02:24:29,760 --> 02:24:32,150
every time i i think about these things
i rapidly reach the

7647
02:24:32,150 --> 02:24:32,160
i rapidly reach the
 

7648
02:24:32,160 --> 02:24:33,670
i rapidly reach the
limits of my

7649
02:24:33,670 --> 02:24:33,680
limits of my
 

7650
02:24:33,680 --> 02:24:36,870
limits of my
knowledge and and imagination

7651
02:24:36,870 --> 02:24:36,880
knowledge and and imagination
 

7652
02:24:36,880 --> 02:24:38,710
knowledge and and imagination
so when um

7653
02:24:38,710 --> 02:24:38,720
so when um
 

7654
02:24:38,720 --> 02:24:41,590
so when um
alexa first came out

7655
02:24:41,590 --> 02:24:41,600
alexa first came out
 

7656
02:24:41,600 --> 02:24:43,910
alexa first came out
and i i think um

7657
02:24:43,910 --> 02:24:43,920
and i i think um
 

7658
02:24:43,920 --> 02:24:46,790
and i i think um
there was a a competing one well there

7659
02:24:46,790 --> 02:24:46,800
there was a a competing one well there
 

7660
02:24:46,800 --> 02:24:50,309
there was a a competing one well there
was siri with apple and google had alexa

7661
02:24:50,309 --> 02:24:50,319
was siri with apple and google had alexa
 

7662
02:24:50,319 --> 02:24:52,870
was siri with apple and google had alexa
no no uh amazon had alexa yeah amazon

7663
02:24:52,870 --> 02:24:52,880
no no uh amazon had alexa yeah amazon
 

7664
02:24:52,880 --> 02:24:54,710
no no uh amazon had alexa yeah amazon
had a lot of google

7665
02:24:54,710 --> 02:24:54,720
had a lot of google
 

7666
02:24:54,720 --> 02:24:57,429
had a lot of google
assistant something so i i proposed to

7667
02:24:57,429 --> 02:24:57,439
assistant something so i i proposed to
 

7668
02:24:57,439 --> 02:24:59,270
assistant something so i i proposed to
one of my colleagues that

7669
02:24:59,270 --> 02:24:59,280
one of my colleagues that
 

7670
02:24:59,280 --> 02:25:01,670
one of my colleagues that
he buy one of these each you know one of

7671
02:25:01,670 --> 02:25:01,680
he buy one of these each you know one of
 

7672
02:25:01,680 --> 02:25:02,790
he buy one of these each you know one of
each

7673
02:25:02,790 --> 02:25:02,800
each
 

7674
02:25:02,800 --> 02:25:03,670
each
and then

7675
02:25:03,670 --> 02:25:03,680
and then
 

7676
02:25:03,680 --> 02:25:07,510
and then
ask it questions from the iq test

7677
02:25:07,510 --> 02:25:07,520
ask it questions from the iq test
 

7678
02:25:07,520 --> 02:25:08,710
ask it questions from the iq test
yes

7679
02:25:08,710 --> 02:25:08,720
yes
 

7680
02:25:08,720 --> 02:25:09,750
yes
but

7681
02:25:09,750 --> 02:25:09,760
but
 

7682
02:25:09,760 --> 02:25:11,750
but
it became apparent that

7683
02:25:11,750 --> 02:25:11,760
it became apparent that
 

7684
02:25:11,760 --> 02:25:14,230
it became apparent that
they all searched the internet

7685
02:25:14,230 --> 02:25:14,240
they all searched the internet
 

7686
02:25:14,240 --> 02:25:16,309
they all searched the internet
so they all can find answers to

7687
02:25:16,309 --> 02:25:16,319
so they all can find answers to
 

7688
02:25:16,319 --> 02:25:18,790
so they all can find answers to
questions like how far is it between

7689
02:25:18,790 --> 02:25:18,800
questions like how far is it between
 

7690
02:25:18,800 --> 02:25:20,870
questions like how far is it between
washington and miami

7691
02:25:20,870 --> 02:25:20,880
washington and miami
 

7692
02:25:20,880 --> 02:25:23,349
washington and miami
and repeat after me now i don't know if

7693
02:25:23,349 --> 02:25:23,359
and repeat after me now i don't know if
 

7694
02:25:23,359 --> 02:25:25,910
and repeat after me now i don't know if
you said to uh alexa

7695
02:25:25,910 --> 02:25:25,920
you said to uh alexa
 

7696
02:25:25,920 --> 02:25:28,790
you said to uh alexa
i'm going to uh re repeat these numbers

7697
02:25:28,790 --> 02:25:28,800
i'm going to uh re repeat these numbers
 

7698
02:25:28,800 --> 02:25:30,230
i'm going to uh re repeat these numbers
backwards to me

7699
02:25:30,230 --> 02:25:30,240
backwards to me
 

7700
02:25:30,240 --> 02:25:31,349
backwards to me
i don't know what would happen i've

7701
02:25:31,349 --> 02:25:31,359
i don't know what would happen i've
 

7702
02:25:31,359 --> 02:25:32,630
i don't know what would happen i've
never done it

7703
02:25:32,630 --> 02:25:32,640
never done it
 

7704
02:25:32,640 --> 02:25:35,270
never done it
but the the so so one answer to your

7705
02:25:35,270 --> 02:25:35,280
but the the so so one answer to your
 

7706
02:25:35,280 --> 02:25:37,429
but the the so so one answer to your
question is try you're going to try it

7707
02:25:37,429 --> 02:25:37,439
question is try you're going to try it
 

7708
02:25:37,439 --> 02:25:39,030
question is try you're going to try it
right now let's try it

7709
02:25:39,030 --> 02:25:39,040
right now let's try it
 

7710
02:25:39,040 --> 02:25:42,150
right now let's try it
let's try it no yes sir

7711
02:25:42,150 --> 02:25:42,160
let's try it no yes sir
 

7712
02:25:42,160 --> 02:25:45,190
let's try it no yes sir
so i i it would actually probably go to

7713
02:25:45,190 --> 02:25:45,200
so i i it would actually probably go to
 

7714
02:25:45,200 --> 02:25:46,710
so i i it would actually probably go to
google search and it will be all

7715
02:25:46,710 --> 02:25:46,720
google search and it will be all
 

7716
02:25:46,720 --> 02:25:48,389
google search and it will be all
confusing kind of stuff

7717
02:25:48,389 --> 02:25:48,399
confusing kind of stuff
 

7718
02:25:48,399 --> 02:25:50,630
confusing kind of stuff
it would uh it would fail well then i

7719
02:25:50,630 --> 02:25:50,640
it would uh it would fail well then i
 

7720
02:25:50,640 --> 02:25:53,110
it would uh it would fail well then i
guess that there's a test that that it

7721
02:25:53,110 --> 02:25:53,120
guess that there's a test that that it
 

7722
02:25:53,120 --> 02:25:54,469
guess that there's a test that that it
would fail

7723
02:25:54,469 --> 02:25:54,479
would fail
 

7724
02:25:54,479 --> 02:25:57,110
would fail
well but that's not that has to do more

7725
02:25:57,110 --> 02:25:57,120
well but that's not that has to do more
 

7726
02:25:57,120 --> 02:25:59,190
well but that's not that has to do more
with the

7727
02:25:59,190 --> 02:25:59,200
with the
 

7728
02:25:59,200 --> 02:26:00,630
with the
you know uh

7729
02:26:00,630 --> 02:26:00,640
you know uh
 

7730
02:26:00,640 --> 02:26:02,710
you know uh
the language of communication versus the

7731
02:26:02,710 --> 02:26:02,720
the language of communication versus the
 

7732
02:26:02,720 --> 02:26:06,230
the language of communication versus the
content so if you did an iq test to a

7733
02:26:06,230 --> 02:26:06,240
content so if you did an iq test to a
 

7734
02:26:06,240 --> 02:26:08,230
content so if you did an iq test to a
person who doesn't speak english and the

7735
02:26:08,230 --> 02:26:08,240
person who doesn't speak english and the
 

7736
02:26:08,240 --> 02:26:10,389
person who doesn't speak english and the
test was administered in english that's

7737
02:26:10,389 --> 02:26:10,399
test was administered in english that's
 

7738
02:26:10,399 --> 02:26:12,070
test was administered in english that's
not really the test of well let's think

7739
02:26:12,070 --> 02:26:12,080
not really the test of well let's think
 

7740
02:26:12,080 --> 02:26:13,830
not really the test of well let's think
about the computers that beat the

7741
02:26:13,830 --> 02:26:13,840
about the computers that beat the
 

7742
02:26:13,840 --> 02:26:16,389
about the computers that beat the
jeopardy champions

7743
02:26:16,389 --> 02:26:16,399
jeopardy champions
 

7744
02:26:16,399 --> 02:26:18,389
jeopardy champions
yeah so that so that

7745
02:26:18,389 --> 02:26:18,399
yeah so that so that
 

7746
02:26:18,399 --> 02:26:20,469
yeah so that so that
because i happen to know how those are

7747
02:26:20,469 --> 02:26:20,479
because i happen to know how those are
 

7748
02:26:20,479 --> 02:26:22,950
because i happen to know how those are
programs are very hard-coded and there's

7749
02:26:22,950 --> 02:26:22,960
programs are very hard-coded and there's
 

7750
02:26:22,960 --> 02:26:25,270
programs are very hard-coded and there's
definitely a lack of intelligence there

7751
02:26:25,270 --> 02:26:25,280
definitely a lack of intelligence there
 

7752
02:26:25,280 --> 02:26:26,309
definitely a lack of intelligence there
there's

7753
02:26:26,309 --> 02:26:26,319
there's
 

7754
02:26:26,319 --> 02:26:28,790
there's
uh something like

7755
02:26:28,790 --> 02:26:28,800
uh something like
 

7756
02:26:28,800 --> 02:26:32,950
uh something like
iq tests uh there's a there's a guy

7757
02:26:32,950 --> 02:26:32,960
iq tests uh there's a there's a guy
 

7758
02:26:32,960 --> 02:26:35,830
iq tests uh there's a there's a guy
uh artificial intelligence researcher uh

7759
02:26:35,830 --> 02:26:35,840
uh artificial intelligence researcher uh
 

7760
02:26:35,840 --> 02:26:38,230
uh artificial intelligence researcher uh
francois chole he's he's a google he's

7761
02:26:38,230 --> 02:26:38,240
francois chole he's he's a google he's
 

7762
02:26:38,240 --> 02:26:39,349
francois chole he's he's a google he's
one of the

7763
02:26:39,349 --> 02:26:39,359
one of the
 

7764
02:26:39,359 --> 02:26:40,950
one of the
seminal people in machine learning he

7765
02:26:40,950 --> 02:26:40,960
seminal people in machine learning he
 

7766
02:26:40,960 --> 02:26:43,429
seminal people in machine learning he
also as a fun aside thing

7767
02:26:43,429 --> 02:26:43,439
also as a fun aside thing
 

7768
02:26:43,439 --> 02:26:49,990
also as a fun aside thing
uh develop an iq test for machines oh

7769
02:26:49,990 --> 02:26:50,000

 

7770
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:51,750

i'll actually email you this because it

7771
02:26:51,750 --> 02:26:51,760
i'll actually email you this because it
 

7772
02:26:51,760 --> 02:26:53,270
i'll actually email you this because it
would be very interesting for you it

7773
02:26:53,270 --> 02:26:53,280
would be very interesting for you it
 

7774
02:26:53,280 --> 02:26:55,349
would be very interesting for you it
doesn't get much attention because

7775
02:26:55,349 --> 02:26:55,359
doesn't get much attention because
 

7776
02:26:55,359 --> 02:26:57,590
doesn't get much attention because
people don't know what to do with it

7777
02:26:57,590 --> 02:26:57,600
people don't know what to do with it
 

7778
02:26:57,600 --> 02:27:00,710
people don't know what to do with it
uh but it deserves a lot of attention

7779
02:27:00,710 --> 02:27:00,720
uh but it deserves a lot of attention
 

7780
02:27:00,720 --> 02:27:03,349
uh but it deserves a lot of attention
which is it basically does a pattern

7781
02:27:03,349 --> 02:27:03,359
which is it basically does a pattern
 

7782
02:27:03,359 --> 02:27:05,590
which is it basically does a pattern
type of tests

7783
02:27:05,590 --> 02:27:05,600
type of tests
 

7784
02:27:05,600 --> 02:27:07,590
type of tests
where you have to do uh you know one

7785
02:27:07,590 --> 02:27:07,600
where you have to do uh you know one
 

7786
02:27:07,600 --> 02:27:09,670
where you have to do uh you know one
standard one is

7787
02:27:09,670 --> 02:27:09,680
standard one is
 

7788
02:27:09,680 --> 02:27:11,510
standard one is
you're given three things and you have

7789
02:27:11,510 --> 02:27:11,520
you're given three things and you have
 

7790
02:27:11,520 --> 02:27:14,070
you're given three things and you have
to do a fourth one that that kind of

7791
02:27:14,070 --> 02:27:14,080
to do a fourth one that that kind of
 

7792
02:27:14,080 --> 02:27:15,990
to do a fourth one that that kind of
thing you have to understand the pattern

7793
02:27:15,990 --> 02:27:16,000
thing you have to understand the pattern
 

7794
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:20,710
thing you have to understand the pattern
here and for that it really simplifies

7795
02:27:20,710 --> 02:27:20,720
here and for that it really simplifies
 

7796
02:27:20,720 --> 02:27:24,469
here and for that it really simplifies
to um

7797
02:27:24,469 --> 02:27:24,479

 

7798
02:27:24,479 --> 02:27:27,349

so the interesting thing is

7799
02:27:27,349 --> 02:27:27,359
so the interesting thing is
 

7800
02:27:27,359 --> 02:27:30,790
so the interesting thing is
he's trying not to achieve high iq he's

7801
02:27:30,790 --> 02:27:30,800
he's trying not to achieve high iq he's
 

7802
02:27:30,800 --> 02:27:33,030
he's trying not to achieve high iq he's
trying to achieve like pretty

7803
02:27:33,030 --> 02:27:33,040
trying to achieve like pretty
 

7804
02:27:33,040 --> 02:27:34,950
trying to achieve like pretty
low bar for iq

7805
02:27:34,950 --> 02:27:34,960
low bar for iq
 

7806
02:27:34,960 --> 02:27:36,790
low bar for iq
things that are kind of trivial for

7807
02:27:36,790 --> 02:27:36,800
things that are kind of trivial for
 

7808
02:27:36,800 --> 02:27:39,349
things that are kind of trivial for
humans

7809
02:27:39,349 --> 02:27:39,359

 

7810
02:27:39,359 --> 02:27:40,950

and they're actually really tough for

7811
02:27:40,950 --> 02:27:40,960
and they're actually really tough for
 

7812
02:27:40,960 --> 02:27:43,429
and they're actually really tough for
machines which is seeing

7813
02:27:43,429 --> 02:27:43,439
machines which is seeing
 

7814
02:27:43,439 --> 02:27:45,910
machines which is seeing
playing with these concepts of

7815
02:27:45,910 --> 02:27:45,920
playing with these concepts of
 

7816
02:27:45,920 --> 02:27:50,150
playing with these concepts of
symmetry of counting like if i give you

7817
02:27:50,150 --> 02:27:50,160
symmetry of counting like if i give you
 

7818
02:27:50,160 --> 02:27:51,990
symmetry of counting like if i give you
one object two objects three objects

7819
02:27:51,990 --> 02:27:52,000
one object two objects three objects
 

7820
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,230
one object two objects three objects
you'll know the the the last one is four

7821
02:27:54,230 --> 02:27:54,240
you'll know the the the last one is four
 

7822
02:27:54,240 --> 02:27:56,870
you'll know the the the last one is four
objects you can like count them you can

7823
02:27:56,870 --> 02:27:56,880
objects you can like count them you can
 

7824
02:27:56,880 --> 02:27:59,110
objects you can like count them you can
you can cluster objects together it's

7825
02:27:59,110 --> 02:27:59,120
you can cluster objects together it's
 

7826
02:27:59,120 --> 02:28:01,190
you can cluster objects together it's
both visually and conceptually we could

7827
02:28:01,190 --> 02:28:01,200
both visually and conceptually we could
 

7828
02:28:01,200 --> 02:28:03,110
both visually and conceptually we could
do all these things with our mind that

7829
02:28:03,110 --> 02:28:03,120
do all these things with our mind that
 

7830
02:28:03,120 --> 02:28:04,790
do all these things with our mind that
we take for granted

7831
02:28:04,790 --> 02:28:04,800
we take for granted
 

7832
02:28:04,800 --> 02:28:08,710
we take for granted
the object-ness of things we can like

7833
02:28:08,710 --> 02:28:08,720
the object-ness of things we can like
 

7834
02:28:08,720 --> 02:28:10,950
the object-ness of things we can like
figure out what uh

7835
02:28:10,950 --> 02:28:10,960
figure out what uh
 

7836
02:28:10,960 --> 02:28:13,750
figure out what uh
spatially is an object and isn't

7837
02:28:13,750 --> 02:28:13,760
spatially is an object and isn't
 

7838
02:28:13,760 --> 02:28:17,190
spatially is an object and isn't
and we can play with those ideas um

7839
02:28:17,190 --> 02:28:17,200
and we can play with those ideas um
 

7840
02:28:17,200 --> 02:28:18,630
and we can play with those ideas um
and machines

7841
02:28:18,630 --> 02:28:18,640
and machines
 

7842
02:28:18,640 --> 02:28:20,309
and machines
really struggle with that so he really

7843
02:28:20,309 --> 02:28:20,319
really struggle with that so he really
 

7844
02:28:20,319 --> 02:28:22,630
really struggle with that so he really
cleanly formulated these iq tests i

7845
02:28:22,630 --> 02:28:22,640
cleanly formulated these iq tests i
 

7846
02:28:22,640 --> 02:28:24,150
cleanly formulated these iq tests i
wonder what like

7847
02:28:24,150 --> 02:28:24,160
wonder what like
 

7848
02:28:24,160 --> 02:28:26,630
wonder what like
uh that would equate to for humans with

7849
02:28:26,630 --> 02:28:26,640
uh that would equate to for humans with
 

7850
02:28:26,640 --> 02:28:29,270
uh that would equate to for humans with
iq but it'd be a very low iq

7851
02:28:29,270 --> 02:28:29,280
iq but it'd be a very low iq
 

7852
02:28:29,280 --> 02:28:31,910
iq but it'd be a very low iq
uh but that's exactly the kind of

7853
02:28:31,910 --> 02:28:31,920
uh but that's exactly the kind of
 

7854
02:28:31,920 --> 02:28:33,910
uh but that's exactly the kind of
formulation like okay we want to be able

7855
02:28:33,910 --> 02:28:33,920
formulation like okay we want to be able
 

7856
02:28:33,920 --> 02:28:35,830
formulation like okay we want to be able
to solve this how do we solve this and

7857
02:28:35,830 --> 02:28:35,840
to solve this how do we solve this and
 

7858
02:28:35,840 --> 02:28:37,830
to solve this how do we solve this and
he does it as a challenge and nobody's

7859
02:28:37,830 --> 02:28:37,840
he does it as a challenge and nobody's
 

7860
02:28:37,840 --> 02:28:40,630
he does it as a challenge and nobody's
been able to um it's similar to the

7861
02:28:40,630 --> 02:28:40,640
been able to um it's similar to the
 

7862
02:28:40,640 --> 02:28:43,510
been able to um it's similar to the
alexa prize which is amazon is hosting a

7863
02:28:43,510 --> 02:28:43,520
alexa prize which is amazon is hosting a
 

7864
02:28:43,520 --> 02:28:45,910
alexa prize which is amazon is hosting a
conversational challenge uh nobody's

7865
02:28:45,910 --> 02:28:45,920
conversational challenge uh nobody's
 

7866
02:28:45,920 --> 02:28:48,710
conversational challenge uh nobody's
been able to do well on on his but

7867
02:28:48,710 --> 02:28:48,720
been able to do well on on his but
 

7868
02:28:48,720 --> 02:28:50,309
been able to do well on on his but
that's an interesting

7869
02:28:50,309 --> 02:28:50,319
that's an interesting
 

7870
02:28:50,319 --> 02:28:52,469
that's an interesting
uh those kinds of tests are interesting

7871
02:28:52,469 --> 02:28:52,479
uh those kinds of tests are interesting
 

7872
02:28:52,479 --> 02:28:54,389
uh those kinds of tests are interesting
because we we take for granted

7873
02:28:54,389 --> 02:28:54,399
because we we take for granted
 

7874
02:28:54,399 --> 02:28:55,349
because we we take for granted
all the

7875
02:28:55,349 --> 02:28:55,359
all the
 

7876
02:28:55,359 --> 02:28:58,309
all the
the ability of the human mind

7877
02:28:58,309 --> 02:28:58,319
the ability of the human mind
 

7878
02:28:58,319 --> 02:29:01,190
the ability of the human mind
to play with concepts and

7879
02:29:01,190 --> 02:29:01,200
to play with concepts and
 

7880
02:29:01,200 --> 02:29:03,349
to play with concepts and
to

7881
02:29:03,349 --> 02:29:03,359
to
 

7882
02:29:03,359 --> 02:29:06,790
to
formulate concepts out of novel things

7883
02:29:06,790 --> 02:29:06,800
formulate concepts out of novel things
 

7884
02:29:06,800 --> 02:29:09,510
formulate concepts out of novel things
so like things we've never seen before

7885
02:29:09,510 --> 02:29:09,520
so like things we've never seen before
 

7886
02:29:09,520 --> 02:29:11,270
so like things we've never seen before
we were able to

7887
02:29:11,270 --> 02:29:11,280
we were able to
 

7888
02:29:11,280 --> 02:29:12,950
we were able to
use that i mean that's

7889
02:29:12,950 --> 02:29:12,960
use that i mean that's
 

7890
02:29:12,960 --> 02:29:14,950
use that i mean that's
i've talked to a few people that design

7891
02:29:14,950 --> 02:29:14,960
i've talked to a few people that design
 

7892
02:29:14,960 --> 02:29:17,990
i've talked to a few people that design
iq tests sort of online they write iq

7893
02:29:17,990 --> 02:29:18,000
iq tests sort of online they write iq
 

7894
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:18,950
iq tests sort of online they write iq
tests

7895
02:29:18,950 --> 02:29:18,960
tests
 

7896
02:29:18,960 --> 02:29:20,950
tests
and i was trying to get some questions

7897
02:29:20,950 --> 02:29:20,960
and i was trying to get some questions
 

7898
02:29:20,960 --> 02:29:22,950
and i was trying to get some questions
from them and they they spoke to the

7899
02:29:22,950 --> 02:29:22,960
from them and they they spoke to the
 

7900
02:29:22,960 --> 02:29:24,710
from them and they they spoke to the
fact that we can't really share

7901
02:29:24,710 --> 02:29:24,720
fact that we can't really share
 

7902
02:29:24,720 --> 02:29:26,630
fact that we can't really share
questions with you because

7903
02:29:26,630 --> 02:29:26,640
questions with you because
 

7904
02:29:26,640 --> 02:29:28,550
questions with you because
part of the

7905
02:29:28,550 --> 02:29:28,560
part of the
 

7906
02:29:28,560 --> 02:29:29,910
part of the
um

7907
02:29:29,910 --> 02:29:29,920
um
 

7908
02:29:29,920 --> 02:29:31,429
um
like first of all it's really hard work

7909
02:29:31,429 --> 02:29:31,439
like first of all it's really hard work
 

7910
02:29:31,439 --> 02:29:33,270
like first of all it's really hard work
to come up with questions

7911
02:29:33,270 --> 02:29:33,280
to come up with questions
 

7912
02:29:33,280 --> 02:29:34,870
to come up with questions
like it's really really hard work it

7913
02:29:34,870 --> 02:29:34,880
like it's really really hard work it
 

7914
02:29:34,880 --> 02:29:36,550
like it's really really hard work it
takes a lot it takes a lot of research

7915
02:29:36,550 --> 02:29:36,560
takes a lot it takes a lot of research
 

7916
02:29:36,560 --> 02:29:38,950
takes a lot it takes a lot of research
but it also takes a lot you it's novelty

7917
02:29:38,950 --> 02:29:38,960
but it also takes a lot you it's novelty
 

7918
02:29:38,960 --> 02:29:41,590
but it also takes a lot you it's novelty
generating you're you're

7919
02:29:41,590 --> 02:29:41,600
generating you're you're
 

7920
02:29:41,600 --> 02:29:43,190
generating you're you're
constantly coming up with really new

7921
02:29:43,190 --> 02:29:43,200
constantly coming up with really new
 

7922
02:29:43,200 --> 02:29:44,230
constantly coming up with really new
things

7923
02:29:44,230 --> 02:29:44,240
things
 

7924
02:29:44,240 --> 02:29:45,190
things
and

7925
02:29:45,190 --> 02:29:45,200
and
 

7926
02:29:45,200 --> 02:29:47,670
and
um part of the point is that you're not

7927
02:29:47,670 --> 02:29:47,680
um part of the point is that you're not
 

7928
02:29:47,680 --> 02:29:49,830
um part of the point is that you're not
they're not supposed to be public that

7929
02:29:49,830 --> 02:29:49,840
they're not supposed to be public that
 

7930
02:29:49,840 --> 02:29:52,070
they're not supposed to be public that
they're supposed to be new to you when

7931
02:29:52,070 --> 02:29:52,080
they're supposed to be new to you when
 

7932
02:29:52,080 --> 02:29:53,349
they're supposed to be new to you when
you look at them

7933
02:29:53,349 --> 02:29:53,359
you look at them
 

7934
02:29:53,359 --> 02:29:55,349
you look at them
it's interesting that the novelty is

7935
02:29:55,349 --> 02:29:55,359
it's interesting that the novelty is
 

7936
02:29:55,359 --> 02:29:56,870
it's interesting that the novelty is
fundamental to the hardness of the

7937
02:29:56,870 --> 02:29:56,880
fundamental to the hardness of the
 

7938
02:29:56,880 --> 02:29:58,389
fundamental to the hardness of the
problem

7939
02:29:58,389 --> 02:29:58,399
problem
 

7940
02:29:58,399 --> 02:30:00,870
problem
at least a part of what makes the

7941
02:30:00,870 --> 02:30:00,880
at least a part of what makes the
 

7942
02:30:00,880 --> 02:30:02,389
at least a part of what makes the
problem hard is you've never seen it

7943
02:30:02,389 --> 02:30:02,399
problem hard is you've never seen it
 

7944
02:30:02,399 --> 02:30:04,469
problem hard is you've never seen it
before right that's called fluid

7945
02:30:04,469 --> 02:30:04,479
before right that's called fluid
 

7946
02:30:04,479 --> 02:30:07,190
before right that's called fluid
intelligence as opposed to what's called

7947
02:30:07,190 --> 02:30:07,200
intelligence as opposed to what's called
 

7948
02:30:07,200 --> 02:30:09,270
intelligence as opposed to what's called
crystallized intelligence which is your

knowledge of of facts
 

7952
02:30:12,240 --> 02:30:13,750
knowledge of of facts
you know things

7953
02:30:13,750 --> 02:30:13,760
you know things
 

7954
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:16,389
you know things
but can you use those things to solve a

7955
02:30:16,389 --> 02:30:16,399
but can you use those things to solve a
 

7956
02:30:16,399 --> 02:30:19,270
but can you use those things to solve a
problem those are two different things

7957
02:30:19,270 --> 02:30:19,280
problem those are two different things
 

7958
02:30:19,280 --> 02:30:21,429
problem those are two different things
do you think we'll be able to

7959
02:30:21,429 --> 02:30:21,439
do you think we'll be able to
 

7960
02:30:21,439 --> 02:30:23,270
do you think we'll be able to
because we spoke and i don't want to

7961
02:30:23,270 --> 02:30:23,280
because we spoke and i don't want to
 

7962
02:30:23,280 --> 02:30:25,510
because we spoke and i don't want to
miss uh opportunity to talk about this

7963
02:30:25,510 --> 02:30:25,520
miss uh opportunity to talk about this
 

7964
02:30:25,520 --> 02:30:27,429
miss uh opportunity to talk about this
we spoke about the neurobiology about

7965
02:30:27,429 --> 02:30:27,439
we spoke about the neurobiology about
 

7966
02:30:27,439 --> 02:30:30,150
we spoke about the neurobiology about
the molecular biology of intelligence do

7967
02:30:30,150 --> 02:30:30,160
the molecular biology of intelligence do
 

7968
02:30:30,160 --> 02:30:31,510
the molecular biology of intelligence do
you think one day we'll be able to

7969
02:30:31,510 --> 02:30:31,520
you think one day we'll be able to
 

7970
02:30:31,520 --> 02:30:35,030
you think one day we'll be able to
modify the biology

7971
02:30:35,030 --> 02:30:35,040
modify the biology
 

7972
02:30:35,040 --> 02:30:39,429
modify the biology
of uh or the genetics of a person

their intelligence we started this

7979
02:30:44,389 --> 02:30:44,399
their intelligence we started this
 

7980
02:30:44,399 --> 02:30:46,150
their intelligence we started this
conversation by talking about a pill you

7981
02:30:46,150 --> 02:30:46,160
conversation by talking about a pill you
 

7982
02:30:46,160 --> 02:30:48,070
conversation by talking about a pill you
could take do you think that such a pill

7983
02:30:48,070 --> 02:30:48,080
could take do you think that such a pill
 

7984
02:30:48,080 --> 02:30:51,270
could take do you think that such a pill
would exist metaphorically i do

7985
02:30:51,270 --> 02:30:51,280
would exist metaphorically i do
 

7986
02:30:51,280 --> 02:30:55,429
would exist metaphorically i do
and i am supremely confident that it's

7987
02:30:55,429 --> 02:30:55,439
and i am supremely confident that it's
 

7988
02:30:55,439 --> 02:30:58,550
and i am supremely confident that it's
possible because i am supremely ignorant

7989
02:30:58,550 --> 02:30:58,560
possible because i am supremely ignorant
 

7990
02:30:58,560 --> 02:31:02,469
possible because i am supremely ignorant
of the complexities of neurobiology

7991
02:31:02,469 --> 02:31:02,479
of the complexities of neurobiology
 

7992
02:31:02,479 --> 02:31:04,790
of the complexities of neurobiology
and so i have written ignorance is bliss

7993
02:31:04,790 --> 02:31:04,800
and so i have written ignorance is bliss
 

7994
02:31:04,800 --> 02:31:07,190
and so i have written ignorance is bliss
well i have written that the nightmares

7995
02:31:07,190 --> 02:31:07,200
well i have written that the nightmares
 

7996
02:31:07,200 --> 02:31:09,190
well i have written that the nightmares
of neurobiologists

7997
02:31:09,190 --> 02:31:09,200
of neurobiologists
 

7998
02:31:09,200 --> 02:31:11,190
of neurobiologists
you know understanding the complexities

7999
02:31:11,190 --> 02:31:11,200
you know understanding the complexities
 

8000
02:31:11,200 --> 02:31:15,590
you know understanding the complexities
this cascade of events that happens

8001
02:31:15,590 --> 02:31:15,600
this cascade of events that happens
 

8002
02:31:15,600 --> 02:31:19,750
this cascade of events that happens
at the synaptic level

8003
02:31:19,750 --> 02:31:19,760

 

8004
02:31:19,760 --> 02:31:23,030

that these nightmares are what fuel some

8005
02:31:23,030 --> 02:31:23,040
that these nightmares are what fuel some
 

8006
02:31:23,040 --> 02:31:24,870
that these nightmares are what fuel some
people to solve

8007
02:31:24,870 --> 02:31:24,880
people to solve
 

8008
02:31:24,880 --> 02:31:26,389
people to solve
so some people

8009
02:31:26,389 --> 02:31:26,399
so some people
 

8010
02:31:26,399 --> 02:31:28,950
so some people
you have to be undaunted i mean yeah

8011
02:31:28,950 --> 02:31:28,960
you have to be undaunted i mean yeah
 

8012
02:31:28,960 --> 02:31:31,110
you have to be undaunted i mean yeah
this is this is not easy

8013
02:31:31,110 --> 02:31:31,120
this is this is not easy
 

8014
02:31:31,120 --> 02:31:33,030
this is this is not easy
look we're still trying to figure out

8015
02:31:33,030 --> 02:31:33,040
look we're still trying to figure out
 

8016
02:31:33,040 --> 02:31:34,230
look we're still trying to figure out
cancer

8017
02:31:34,230 --> 02:31:34,240
cancer
 

8018
02:31:34,240 --> 02:31:35,590
cancer
yeah

8019
02:31:35,590 --> 02:31:35,600
yeah
 

8020
02:31:35,600 --> 02:31:37,590
yeah
it was only recently that they figured

8021
02:31:37,590 --> 02:31:37,600
it was only recently that they figured
 

8022
02:31:37,600 --> 02:31:40,230
it was only recently that they figured
out why aspirin works

8023
02:31:40,230 --> 02:31:40,240
out why aspirin works
 

8024
02:31:40,240 --> 02:31:42,790
out why aspirin works
you know i these are not easy problems

8025
02:31:42,790 --> 02:31:42,800
you know i these are not easy problems
 

8026
02:31:42,800 --> 02:31:46,309
you know i these are not easy problems
but i also have the perspective

8027
02:31:46,309 --> 02:31:46,319
but i also have the perspective
 

8028
02:31:46,319 --> 02:31:47,349
but i also have the perspective
of

8029
02:31:47,349 --> 02:31:47,359
of
 

8030
02:31:47,359 --> 02:31:49,349
of
the history of science

8031
02:31:49,349 --> 02:31:49,359
the history of science
 

8032
02:31:49,359 --> 02:31:51,670
the history of science
is the history of solving

8033
02:31:51,670 --> 02:31:51,680
is the history of solving
 

8034
02:31:51,680 --> 02:31:52,870
is the history of solving
problems

8035
02:31:52,870 --> 02:31:52,880
problems
 

8036
02:31:52,880 --> 02:31:54,429
problems
that are

8037
02:31:54,429 --> 02:31:54,439
that are
 

8038
02:31:54,439 --> 02:31:57,349
that are
extraordinarily complex

8039
02:31:57,349 --> 02:31:57,359
extraordinarily complex
 

8040
02:31:57,359 --> 02:31:59,830
extraordinarily complex
and seem impossible and seem impossible

8041
02:31:59,830 --> 02:31:59,840
and seem impossible and seem impossible
 

8042
02:31:59,840 --> 02:32:02,870
and seem impossible and seem impossible
at the time and so one of the

8043
02:32:02,870 --> 02:32:02,880
at the time and so one of the
 

8044
02:32:02,880 --> 02:32:04,630
at the time and so one of the
things you look at at companies like

8045
02:32:04,630 --> 02:32:04,640
things you look at at companies like
 

8046
02:32:04,640 --> 02:32:05,830
things you look at at companies like
neurolink

8047

8049
02:32:08,230 --> 02:32:08,240
you have brain computer interfaces
 

8050
02:32:08,240 --> 02:32:09,990
you have brain computer interfaces
you start to delve into the human mind

8051
02:32:09,990 --> 02:32:10,000
you start to delve into the human mind
 

8052
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:11,750
you start to delve into the human mind
and start to talk about machines

8053
02:32:11,750 --> 02:32:11,760
and start to talk about machines
 

8054
02:32:11,760 --> 02:32:13,510

measuring but also sending signals to
 

8056
02:32:13,520 --> 02:32:16,309
measuring but also sending signals to
the human mind you start to wonder

8057
02:32:16,309 --> 02:32:16,319
the human mind you start to wonder
 

8058
02:32:16,319 --> 02:32:17,429
the human mind you start to wonder
what that

8059
02:32:17,429 --> 02:32:17,439
what that
 

8060
02:32:17,439 --> 02:32:20,630
what that
has uh what impact that has on

8061
02:32:20,630 --> 02:32:20,640
has uh what impact that has on
 

8062
02:32:20,640 --> 02:32:23,030
has uh what impact that has on

the uh
 

8070
02:32:27,760 --> 02:32:31,110
the uh
the mechanical electrical

8071
02:32:31,110 --> 02:32:31,120
the mechanical electrical
 

8072
02:32:31,120 --> 02:32:34,070
the mechanical electrical
of chemical functioning of the brain

8073
02:32:34,070 --> 02:32:34,080
of chemical functioning of the brain
 

8074
02:32:34,080 --> 02:32:34,790
of chemical functioning of the brain
i

8075
02:32:34,790 --> 02:32:34,800
i
 

8076
02:32:34,800 --> 02:32:37,429
i
look at everything about the brain there

8077
02:32:37,429 --> 02:32:37,439
look at everything about the brain there
 

8078
02:32:37,439 --> 02:32:39,830
look at everything about the brain there
are different levels of explanation on

8079
02:32:39,830 --> 02:32:39,840
are different levels of explanation on
 

8080
02:32:39,840 --> 02:32:42,309
are different levels of explanation on
one hand you have a behavioral level

8081
02:32:42,309 --> 02:32:42,319
one hand you have a behavioral level
 

8082
02:32:42,319 --> 02:32:45,830
one hand you have a behavioral level
but then you have brain circuitry

8083
02:32:45,830 --> 02:32:45,840
but then you have brain circuitry
 

8084
02:32:45,840 --> 02:32:48,070
but then you have brain circuitry
and then you have

8085
02:32:48,070 --> 02:32:48,080
and then you have
 

8086
02:32:48,080 --> 02:32:49,830
and then you have
neurons

8087
02:32:49,830 --> 02:32:49,840
neurons
 

8088
02:32:49,840 --> 02:32:52,469
neurons
and then you have dendrites

8089
02:32:52,469 --> 02:32:52,479
and then you have dendrites
 

8090
02:32:52,479 --> 02:32:55,030
and then you have dendrites
and then you have synapses

8091
02:32:55,030 --> 02:32:55,040
and then you have synapses
 

8092
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:57,510
and then you have synapses
and and then you have

8093
02:32:57,510 --> 02:32:57,520
and and then you have
 

8094
02:32:57,520 --> 02:33:01,030
and and then you have
the the neurotransmitters

8095
02:33:01,030 --> 02:33:01,040
the the neurotransmitters
 

8096
02:33:01,040 --> 02:33:03,830
the the neurotransmitters
and the presynaptic and the postsynaptic

8097
02:33:03,830 --> 02:33:03,840
and the presynaptic and the postsynaptic
 

8098
02:33:03,840 --> 02:33:05,670

terminals
 

8100
02:33:05,680 --> 02:33:07,670
terminals
and then you have all the things that

8101
02:33:07,670 --> 02:33:07,680
and then you have all the things that
 

8102
02:33:07,680 --> 02:33:09,070
and then you have all the things that
influence

8103
02:33:09,070 --> 02:33:09,080
influence
 

8104
02:33:09,080 --> 02:33:10,630

neurotransmitters
 

8106
02:33:10,640 --> 02:33:12,150
neurotransmitters
and then you have

8107
02:33:12,150 --> 02:33:12,160
and then you have
 

8108
02:33:12,160 --> 02:33:15,830
and then you have
the individual differences among people

8109
02:33:15,830 --> 02:33:15,840
the individual differences among people
 

8110
02:33:15,840 --> 02:33:18,550
the individual differences among people
yeah it's complicated

8111
02:33:18,550 --> 02:33:18,560
yeah it's complicated
 

8112
02:33:18,560 --> 02:33:20,469
yeah it's complicated
but 51

8113
02:33:20,469 --> 02:33:20,479
but 51
 

8114
02:33:20,479 --> 02:33:23,830
but 51
million people in the united states

8115
02:33:23,830 --> 02:33:23,840
million people in the united states
 

8116
02:33:23,840 --> 02:33:27,270
million people in the united states
have iqs under 85

8117
02:33:27,270 --> 02:33:27,280
have iqs under 85
 

8118
02:33:27,280 --> 02:33:29,270
have iqs under 85
and struggle

8119
02:33:29,270 --> 02:33:29,280
and struggle
 

8120
02:33:29,280 --> 02:33:32,230
and struggle
with everyday life

8121
02:33:32,230 --> 02:33:32,240
with everyday life
 

8122
02:33:32,240 --> 02:33:35,190
with everyday life
shouldn't that motivate

8123
02:33:35,190 --> 02:33:35,200
shouldn't that motivate
 

8124
02:33:35,200 --> 02:33:38,070
shouldn't that motivate
people to take a look at this yeah

8125
02:33:38,070 --> 02:33:38,080
people to take a look at this yeah
 

8126
02:33:38,080 --> 02:33:39,510
people to take a look at this yeah
you know

8127
02:33:39,510 --> 02:33:39,520
you know
 

8128
02:33:39,520 --> 02:33:40,469
you know
yeah

8129
02:33:40,469 --> 02:33:40,479
yeah
 

8130
02:33:40,479 --> 02:33:42,389
yeah
now but i just want to linger one more

8131
02:33:42,389 --> 02:33:42,399
now but i just want to linger one more
 

8132
02:33:42,399 --> 02:33:44,550
now but i just want to linger one more
time that um

8133
02:33:44,550 --> 02:33:44,560
time that um
 

8134
02:33:44,560 --> 02:33:46,309
time that um
you have to remember that the science of

8135
02:33:46,309 --> 02:33:46,319
you have to remember that the science of
 

8136
02:33:46,319 --> 02:33:49,830
you have to remember that the science of
intelligence

8137
02:33:49,830 --> 02:33:49,840

 

8138
02:33:49,840 --> 02:33:51,910

the measure of intelligence

8139
02:33:51,910 --> 02:33:51,920
the measure of intelligence
 

8140
02:33:51,920 --> 02:33:54,469
the measure of intelligence
is only a part of the human condition

8141
02:33:54,469 --> 02:33:54,479
is only a part of the human condition
 

8142
02:33:54,479 --> 02:33:56,469
is only a part of the human condition
the thing that makes life beautiful and

8143
02:33:56,469 --> 02:33:56,479
the thing that makes life beautiful and
 

8144
02:33:56,479 --> 02:33:58,150
the thing that makes life beautiful and
the creation of beautiful things in this

8145
02:33:58,150 --> 02:33:58,160
the creation of beautiful things in this
 

8146
02:33:58,160 --> 02:33:59,190
the creation of beautiful things in this
world

8147
02:33:59,190 --> 02:33:59,200
world
 

8148
02:33:59,200 --> 02:34:01,270
world
is is uh

8149
02:34:01,270 --> 02:34:01,280
is is uh
 

8150
02:34:01,280 --> 02:34:02,469
is is uh
perhaps

8151
02:34:02,469 --> 02:34:02,479
perhaps
 

8152
02:34:02,479 --> 02:34:04,150
perhaps
loosely correlated

8153
02:34:04,150 --> 02:34:04,160
loosely correlated
 

8154
02:34:04,160 --> 02:34:07,030
loosely correlated
but is not dependent entirely on

8155
02:34:07,030 --> 02:34:07,040
but is not dependent entirely on
 

8156
02:34:07,040 --> 02:34:08,630
but is not dependent entirely on
intelligence

8157
02:34:08,630 --> 02:34:08,640
intelligence
 

8158
02:34:08,640 --> 02:34:11,429
intelligence
absolutely i i certainly agree with that

8159
02:34:11,429 --> 02:34:11,439
absolutely i i certainly agree with that
 

8160
02:34:11,439 --> 02:34:12,790
absolutely i i certainly agree with that
that's so

8161
02:34:12,790 --> 02:34:12,800
that's so
 

8162
02:34:12,800 --> 02:34:14,790
that's so
for anyone sort of uh

8163
02:34:14,790 --> 02:34:14,800
for anyone sort of uh
 

8164
02:34:14,800 --> 02:34:17,510
for anyone sort of uh
listening i'm still not convinced

8165
02:34:17,510 --> 02:34:17,520
listening i'm still not convinced
 

8166
02:34:17,520 --> 02:34:19,910
listening i'm still not convinced
that um

8167
02:34:19,910 --> 02:34:19,920
that um
 

8168
02:34:19,920 --> 02:34:21,270
that um
sort of

8169
02:34:21,270 --> 02:34:21,280
sort of
 

8170
02:34:21,280 --> 02:34:23,190
sort of
more intelligence is always better if

8171
02:34:23,190 --> 02:34:23,200
more intelligence is always better if
 

8172
02:34:23,200 --> 02:34:25,990
more intelligence is always better if
you want to create beauty in this world

8173
02:34:25,990 --> 02:34:26,000
you want to create beauty in this world
 

8174
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,309
you want to create beauty in this world
i don't know well i didn't say more

8175
02:34:28,309 --> 02:34:28,319
i don't know well i didn't say more
 

8176
02:34:28,319 --> 02:34:29,990
i don't know well i didn't say more
intelligence is always better if you

8177
02:34:29,990 --> 02:34:30,000
intelligence is always better if you
 

8178
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,870
intelligence is always better if you
want to create beauty i just said

8179
02:34:32,870 --> 02:34:32,880
want to create beauty i just said
 

8180
02:34:32,880 --> 02:34:35,030
want to create beauty i just said
all things being equal more is better

8181
02:34:35,030 --> 02:34:35,040
all things being equal more is better
 

8182
02:34:35,040 --> 02:34:36,150
all things being equal more is better
than less

8183
02:34:36,150 --> 02:34:36,160
than less
 

8184
02:34:36,160 --> 02:34:38,630
than less
that's all i mean yeah but that's sort

8185
02:34:38,630 --> 02:34:38,640
that's all i mean yeah but that's sort
 

8186
02:34:38,640 --> 02:34:40,710
that's all i mean yeah but that's sort
of that i just want to sort of say

8187
02:34:40,710 --> 02:34:40,720
of that i just want to sort of say
 

8188
02:34:40,720 --> 02:34:42,550
of that i just want to sort of say
because a lot to me

8189
02:34:42,550 --> 02:34:42,560
because a lot to me
 

8190
02:34:42,560 --> 02:34:45,110
because a lot to me
one of the things that

8191
02:34:45,110 --> 02:34:45,120
one of the things that
 

8192
02:34:45,120 --> 02:34:47,110
one of the things that
makes life great is the opportunity to

8193
02:34:47,110 --> 02:34:47,120
makes life great is the opportunity to
 

8194
02:34:47,120 --> 02:34:49,990
makes life great is the opportunity to
create beautiful things and and so i

8195
02:34:49,990 --> 02:34:50,000
create beautiful things and and so i
 

8196
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,150
create beautiful things and and so i
just want to sort of empower people to

8197
02:34:52,150 --> 02:34:52,160
just want to sort of empower people to
 

8198
02:34:52,160 --> 02:34:54,070
just want to sort of empower people to
to do that no matter what

8199
02:34:54,070 --> 02:34:54,080
to do that no matter what
 

8200
02:34:54,080 --> 02:34:56,150
to do that no matter what
some iq test says

8201
02:34:56,150 --> 02:34:56,160
some iq test says
 

8202
02:34:56,160 --> 02:34:57,990
some iq test says
at the population level we do need to

8203
02:34:57,990 --> 02:34:58,000
at the population level we do need to
 

8204
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:01,270
at the population level we do need to
look at iq tests to help to help people

8205
02:35:01,270 --> 02:35:01,280
look at iq tests to help to help people
 

8206
02:35:01,280 --> 02:35:03,510
look at iq tests to help to help people
and to also inspire us yeah to do to

8207
02:35:03,510 --> 02:35:03,520
and to also inspire us yeah to do to
 

8208
02:35:03,520 --> 02:35:04,710
and to also inspire us yeah to do to
take on some of these extremely

8209
02:35:04,710 --> 02:35:04,720
take on some of these extremely
 

8210
02:35:04,720 --> 02:35:06,389
take on some of these extremely
difficult scientific scientific

8244
02:35:43,280 --> 02:35:45,830
you know but i i can't say if you're
interested in psychology if you're

8245
02:35:45,830 --> 02:35:45,840
interested in psychology if you're
 

8246
02:35:45,840 --> 02:35:47,750
interested in psychology if you're
interested in science

interested in science
 

8248
02:35:47,760 --> 02:35:49,670
interested in science
and the science

8249
02:35:49,670 --> 02:35:49,680
and the science
 

8250
02:35:49,680 --> 02:35:51,670

uh around
 

8252
02:35:51,680 --> 02:35:55,309
uh around
the big questions of consciousness and

8253
02:35:55,309 --> 02:35:55,319
the big questions of consciousness and
 

8254
02:35:55,319 --> 02:35:57,190
the big questions of consciousness and

and psychiatric illness

8257
02:35:59,990 --> 02:36:00,000
and psychiatric illness
 

8258
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,389
and psychiatric illness
we haven't really talked about brain

8259
02:36:02,389 --> 02:36:02,399
we haven't really talked about brain
 

8260

illnesses
 

8262
02:36:03,680 --> 02:36:06,790
illnesses
and what we might learn from uh you know

8263
02:36:06,790 --> 02:36:06,800
and what we might learn from uh you know
 

8264
02:36:06,800 --> 02:36:09,030
and what we might learn from uh you know
if you are trying to develop a drug to

8265
02:36:09,030 --> 02:36:09,040
if you are trying to develop a drug to
 

8266
02:36:09,040 --> 02:36:11,590
if you are trying to develop a drug to
treat alzheimer's disease you are trying

8267
02:36:11,590 --> 02:36:11,600
treat alzheimer's disease you are trying
 

8268
02:36:11,600 --> 02:36:14,389
treat alzheimer's disease you are trying
to develop a drug

8269
02:36:14,389 --> 02:36:14,399
to develop a drug
 

8270
02:36:14,399 --> 02:36:17,429
to develop a drug
to impact learning and memory

8271
02:36:17,429 --> 02:36:17,439
to impact learning and memory
 

8272
02:36:17,439 --> 02:36:20,150
to impact learning and memory
which are core to intelligence

8273
02:36:20,150 --> 02:36:20,160
which are core to intelligence
 

8274
02:36:20,160 --> 02:36:22,309
which are core to intelligence
so it could well be that the so-called

8275
02:36:22,309 --> 02:36:22,319
so it could well be that the so-called
 

8276
02:36:22,319 --> 02:36:25,590
so it could well be that the so-called
iq pill will come from a pharmaceutical

8277
02:36:25,590 --> 02:36:25,600
iq pill will come from a pharmaceutical
 

8278
02:36:25,600 --> 02:36:27,670
iq pill will come from a pharmaceutical
company trying to develop a drug for

8279
02:36:27,670 --> 02:36:27,680
company trying to develop a drug for
 

8280
02:36:27,680 --> 02:36:29,670
company trying to develop a drug for
alzheimer's disease because that's

8281
02:36:29,670 --> 02:36:29,680
alzheimer's disease because that's
 

8282
02:36:29,680 --> 02:36:31,270
alzheimer's disease because that's
exactly what you're trying to do right

8283
02:36:31,270 --> 02:36:31,280
exactly what you're trying to do right
 

8284
02:36:31,280 --> 02:36:32,469
exactly what you're trying to do right
yeah well

8285
02:36:32,469 --> 02:36:32,479
yeah well
 

8286
02:36:32,479 --> 02:36:34,870
yeah well
what will that what will that drug do in

8287
02:36:34,870 --> 02:36:34,880
what will that what will that drug do in
 

8288
02:36:34,880 --> 02:36:36,469
what will that what will that drug do in
a college student that doesn't have

8289
02:36:36,469 --> 02:36:36,479
a college student that doesn't have
 

8290
02:36:36,479 --> 02:36:38,230
a college student that doesn't have
alzheimer's disease

8291
02:36:38,230 --> 02:36:38,240
alzheimer's disease
 

8292
02:36:38,240 --> 02:36:39,110
alzheimer's disease
so

8293
02:36:39,110 --> 02:36:39,120
so
 

8294
02:36:39,120 --> 02:36:40,630
so
i would encourage

8295
02:36:40,630 --> 02:36:40,640
i would encourage
 

8296
02:36:40,640 --> 02:36:44,630
i would encourage
people who are interested in psychology

8297
02:36:44,630 --> 02:36:44,640

is you got to follow the data where the

8313
02:37:06,070 --> 02:37:06,080
is you got to follow the data where the
 

8314
02:37:06,080 --> 02:37:08,230
is you got to follow the data where the
data take you you can't decide in

advance where you want the data to go

8317
02:37:10,389 --> 02:37:10,399
advance where you want the data to go
 

8318
02:37:10,399 --> 02:37:12,469
advance where you want the data to go
and if the data take you to places that

8319
02:37:12,469 --> 02:37:12,479
and if the data take you to places that
 

8320
02:37:12,479 --> 02:37:14,550
and if the data take you to places that
you don't have the technical expertise

8321
02:37:14,550 --> 02:37:14,560
you don't have the technical expertise
 

8322
02:37:14,560 --> 02:37:15,990
you don't have the technical expertise
to follow

8323
02:37:15,990 --> 02:37:16,000
to follow

like you know i would like to to

8325
02:37:18,710 --> 02:37:18,720
like you know i would like to to
 

8326
02:37:18,720 --> 02:37:21,270
like you know i would like to to
understand more about molecular biology

8327
02:37:21,270 --> 02:37:21,280
understand more about molecular biology
 

8328
02:37:21,280 --> 02:37:23,110
understand more about molecular biology
but i'm not going to become a molecular

8329
02:37:23,110 --> 02:37:23,120
but i'm not going to become a molecular
 

8330
02:37:23,120 --> 02:37:26,870
but i'm not going to become a molecular
biologist now but i know people who are

8331
02:37:26,870 --> 02:37:26,880
biologist now but i know people who are
 

8332
02:37:26,880 --> 02:37:29,510
biologist now but i know people who are
and my job is to get them interested to

8333
02:37:29,510 --> 02:37:29,520
and my job is to get them interested to
 

8334
02:37:29,520 --> 02:37:33,349
and my job is to get them interested to
take their expertise into this direction

8335
02:37:33,349 --> 02:37:33,359
take their expertise into this direction
 

8336
02:37:33,359 --> 02:37:36,550
take their expertise into this direction
and that it's not so easy but uh and if

8337
02:37:36,550 --> 02:37:36,560
and that it's not so easy but uh and if
 

8338
02:37:36,560 --> 02:37:38,950
and that it's not so easy but uh and if
the data takes you to a place

8339
02:37:38,950 --> 02:37:38,960
the data takes you to a place
 

8340
02:37:38,960 --> 02:37:40,389
the data takes you to a place
that's controversial that's

8341
02:37:40,389 --> 02:37:40,399
that's controversial that's
 

8342
02:37:40,399 --> 02:37:43,190
that's controversial that's
counterintuitive in this world

8343
02:37:43,190 --> 02:37:43,200
counterintuitive in this world
 

8344
02:37:43,200 --> 02:37:44,469
counterintuitive in this world
um

8345
02:37:44,469 --> 02:37:44,479
um
 

8346
02:37:44,479 --> 02:37:45,510

no
 

8348
02:37:45,520 --> 02:37:46,870
no
i would say

8349
02:37:46,870 --> 02:37:46,880
i would say
 

8350
02:37:46,880 --> 02:37:50,150
i would say
it's probably a good idea to still push

8351
02:37:50,150 --> 02:37:50,160
it's probably a good idea to still push
 

8352
02:37:50,160 --> 02:37:52,070
it's probably a good idea to still push
forward boldly

8353
02:37:52,070 --> 02:37:52,080
forward boldly
 

8354
02:37:52,080 --> 02:37:54,790

8401
02:38:46,710 --> 02:38:46,720
and intelligence one of the most
 

8402
02:38:46,720 --> 02:38:48,309
and intelligence one of the most
fascinating one of the biggest questions

8403
02:38:48,309 --> 02:38:48,319
fascinating one of the biggest questions
 

8404
02:38:48,319 --> 02:38:51,190
fascinating one of the biggest questions
but let's talk about the why

8405
02:38:51,190 --> 02:38:51,200
but let's talk about the why
 

8406
02:38:51,200 --> 02:38:53,110
but let's talk about the why
why are we here

8407

8428
02:39:12,160 --> 02:39:13,670

and and then there's just a finite

8429
02:39:13,670 --> 02:39:13,680
and and then there's just a finite
 

8430
02:39:13,680 --> 02:39:15,190
and and then there's just a finite
number of the days

8431
02:39:15,190 --> 02:39:15,200
number of the days
 

8432
02:39:15,200 --> 02:39:17,349
number of the days
are you uh are you afraid the finiteness

8433
02:39:17,349 --> 02:39:17,359
are you uh are you afraid the finiteness
 

8434
02:39:17,359 --> 02:39:19,190
are you uh are you afraid the finiteness
of it do you think i think about it more

8435
02:39:19,190 --> 02:39:19,200
of it do you think i think about it more
 

8436
02:39:19,200 --> 02:39:21,110
of it do you think i think about it more
and more as i get older

8437
02:39:21,110 --> 02:39:21,120
and more as i get older
 

8438
02:39:21,120 --> 02:39:23,429
and more as i get older
yeah i i do uh

8439

yeah i i do uh
and it's one of these human things that

8441
02:39:26,230 --> 02:39:26,240
and it's one of these human things that
 

8442
02:39:26,240 --> 02:39:28,790
and it's one of these human things that
it is finite we all know it

8443
02:39:28,790 --> 02:39:28,800
it is finite we all know it
 

8444
02:39:28,800 --> 02:39:30,550
it is finite we all know it
um

8445
02:39:30,550 --> 02:39:30,560
um
 

8446
02:39:30,560 --> 02:39:32,469

uh and don't want to think about it
sometimes you you think about it in

8451
02:39:37,349 --> 02:39:37,359
sometimes you you think about it in
 

8452
02:39:37,359 --> 02:39:39,830
sometimes you you think about it in
terms of estate planning you try to do

8453
02:39:39,830 --> 02:39:39,840
terms of estate planning you try to do
 

8454
02:39:39,840 --> 02:39:43,030
terms of estate planning you try to do
the rational thing right sometimes you

8455
02:39:43,030 --> 02:39:43,040
the rational thing right sometimes you
 

8456

8564
02:41:45,680 --> 02:41:46,950
each other dumb all the time and um
you know i

8565

that's the worry here is that

8567
02:41:50,309 --> 02:41:50,319
that's the worry here is that
 

8568
02:41:50,319 --> 02:41:52,790
that's the worry here is that
um we give up on people

8569
02:41:52,790 --> 02:41:52,800
um we give up on people
 

8570
02:41:52,800 --> 02:41:54,550
um we give up on people
we put them in a bin

8571
02:41:54,550 --> 02:41:54,560
we put them in a bin
 

8572
02:41:54,560 --> 02:41:57,670
we put them in a bin
just because of one interaction or

8573
02:41:57,670 --> 02:41:57,680
just because of one interaction or
 

8574
02:41:57,680 --> 02:41:59,990
just because of one interaction or
some small number of interactions as if

8575
02:41:59,990 --> 02:42:00,000
some small number of interactions as if
 

8576
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,309
some small number of interactions as if
that's it they're hopeless that's just

8577
02:42:02,309 --> 02:42:02,319
that's it they're hopeless that's just
 

8578
02:42:02,319 --> 02:42:04,070
that's it they're hopeless that's just
in their genetics but

8579
02:42:04,070 --> 02:42:04,080
in their genetics but
 

8580
02:42:04,080 --> 02:42:06,550
in their genetics but
i i think no matter what the science

8581

i i think no matter what the science
 

8582
