I think that's one of the you know
because that of course the perennial

because that of course the perennial

00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:37,670
because that of course the perennial
question right but it is history kind of

2510
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:37,680
question right but it is history kind of

incremental bearing on what is going to
 

2521
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:53,990

happen anyway but I think that is the
 

2523
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,970
happen anyway but I think that is the
and historians argue about that all the

2524
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:55,980
and historians argue about that all the
 

2525
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:57,049
and historians argue about that all the
time

2526

I think that that is a really good

I think that that is a really good
 

2529
00:51:59,099 --> 00:52:02,750
I think that that is a really good
example of a play a a place in human

history that uh literally the world
 

2533
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,829

could have ended if

2537
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,510
we had a different leader in the White
House and the reason for that is that

2538
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:11,520

2539
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,970

to that event it was like a symposium
 

2641
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,609
to that event it was like a symposium
where everybody on both sides talked

2642
00:54:25,609 --> 00:54:25,619
where everybody on both sides talked
 

2643

and and never nobody knew before
one of the insane things the most insane

2648
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:32,579
one of the insane things the most insane
 

2649
00:54:32,579 --> 00:54:35,030
one of the insane things the most insane
thing that we learned was that the the

2650
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:35,040
thing that we learned was that the the
 

2651
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,609
thing that we learned was that the the
weapons were already the nuclear

2652
00:54:37,609 --> 00:54:37,619
weapons were already the nuclear
 

2653
00:54:37,619 --> 00:54:39,770
weapons were already the nuclear
warheads were already in place they were

2654
00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:39,780
warheads were already in place they were
 

2655
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:41,270
warheads were already in place they were
ready to fire

2656
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:41,280
ready to fire
 

2657
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:45,650
ready to fire
and that the authorization to fire

2658
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:45,660
and that the authorization to fire
 

2659
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:49,190
and that the authorization to fire
was made was delegated to each of the

2660
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:49,200
was made was delegated to each of the
 

2661
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:52,849
was made was delegated to each of the
gun gun crew commanders so there were 60

2662
00:54:52,849 --> 00:54:52,859
gun gun crew commanders so there were 60
 

2663
00:54:52,859 --> 00:54:54,290
gun gun crew commanders so there were 60
people

2664
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:54,300
people
 

2665
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,750
people
who at all had authorization of fire if

2666
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:56,760
who at all had authorization of fire if
 

2667
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:59,510
who at all had authorization of fire if
they felt themselves under attack

2668
00:54:59,510 --> 00:54:59,520
they felt themselves under attack
 

2669
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,150
they felt themselves under attack
so you have to believe that at least one

2670
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:02,160
so you have to believe that at least one
 

2671
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,589
so you have to believe that at least one
of them would have launched and that

2672
00:55:03,589 --> 00:55:03,599
of them would have launched and that
 

2673
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:05,030
of them would have launched and that
would have been the beginning of the end

2674
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:05,040
would have been the beginning of the end
 

2675
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,190
would have been the beginning of the end
and you know if they if anybody had

2676
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:07,200
and you know if they if anybody had
 

2677
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,010
and you know if they if anybody had
launched you know we knew what would

2678
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:10,020
launched you know we knew what would
 

2679
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:12,230
launched you know we knew what would
happen my uncle knew what would happen

2680

Americans will be killed
 

2687
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:23,930
Americans will be killed
but we will kill 130 million Russians so

2688
00:55:23,930 --> 00:55:23,940
but we will kill 130 million Russians so
 

2689
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:27,410
but we will kill 130 million Russians so
we will win and that was a victory for

provoke a war
 

3175
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:44,630
provoke a war
and I'm

3176
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:44,640
and I'm
 

3177
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:46,609
and I'm
but they started talking to each other

3178
01:04:46,609 --> 01:04:46,619
but they started talking to each other
 

3179
01:04:46,619 --> 01:04:48,650
but they started talking to each other
and then when he after he wrote that

3180
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:48,660
and then when he after he wrote that
 

3181
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:50,450
and then when he after he wrote that
letter they agreed that they would

3182
01:04:50,450 --> 01:04:50,460
letter they agreed that they would
 

3183
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:52,609
letter they agreed that they would
install a hotline

3184
01:04:52,609 --> 01:04:52,619
install a hotline
 

3185
01:04:52,619 --> 01:04:54,289
install a hotline
so they could talk to each other and

3186
01:04:54,289 --> 01:04:54,299
so they could talk to each other and
 

3187
01:04:54,299 --> 01:04:55,549
so they could talk to each other and
they wouldn't have to go through

3188
01:04:55,549 --> 01:04:55,559
they wouldn't have to go through
 

3189
01:04:55,559 --> 01:04:59,390
they wouldn't have to go through
intermediaries and so at Jack's house on

3190
01:04:59,390 --> 01:04:59,400
intermediaries and so at Jack's house on
 

3191
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:00,650
intermediaries and so at Jack's house on
the cape

3192
01:05:00,650 --> 01:05:00,660
the cape
 

3193
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:03,410
the cape
there was a red phone that we knew if we

3194
01:05:03,410 --> 01:05:03,420
there was a red phone that we knew if we
 

3195
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:05,890
there was a red phone that we knew if we
picked up cruise ship wouldn't answer

3196
01:05:05,890 --> 01:05:05,900
picked up cruise ship wouldn't answer
 

3197
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:08,030
picked up cruise ship wouldn't answer
and there was another one in the white

3198
01:05:08,030 --> 01:05:08,040
and there was another one in the white
 

3199
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:09,250
and there was another one in the white
house yeah

3200
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:09,260
house yeah
 

3201
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:11,930
house yeah
and but they knew it was important to

3202
01:05:11,930 --> 01:05:11,940
and but they knew it was important to
 

3203
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:14,329
and but they knew it was important to
talk to each other you know and you just

3204
01:05:14,329 --> 01:05:14,339
talk to each other you know and you just
 

3205
01:05:14,339 --> 01:05:16,010
talk to each other you know and you just
wish that we had that kind of leadership

3206
01:05:16,010 --> 01:05:16,020
wish that we had that kind of leadership
 

3207
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:17,630
wish that we had that kind of leadership
today

3208
01:05:17,630 --> 01:05:17,640
today
 

3209
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:20,990
today
I can I you know it just understands our

3210
01:05:20,990 --> 01:05:21,000
I can I you know it just understands our
 

3211
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:21,829
I can I you know it just understands our
job

3212
01:05:21,829 --> 01:05:21,839
job
 

3213
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:24,109
job
look I know you know a lot about AI

3214
01:05:24,109 --> 01:05:24,119
look I know you know a lot about AI
 

3215
01:05:24,119 --> 01:05:27,049
look I know you know a lot about AI
right and you know how dangerous it is

3216
01:05:27,049 --> 01:05:27,059
right and you know how dangerous it is
 

3217
01:05:27,059 --> 01:05:28,670
right and you know how dangerous it is
potentially to humanity and what

3218
01:05:28,670 --> 01:05:28,680
potentially to humanity and what
 

3219
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:30,650
potentially to humanity and what
opportunity is at all so

3220
01:05:30,650 --> 01:05:30,660
opportunity is at all so
 

3221
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:32,450
opportunity is at all so
um you know offers

3222
01:05:32,450 --> 01:05:32,460
um you know offers
 

3223
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:33,829
um you know offers
but

3224
01:05:33,829 --> 01:05:33,839
but
 

3225
01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:36,170
but
it could kill us all I mean Elon said

3226
01:05:36,170 --> 01:05:36,180
it could kill us all I mean Elon said
 

3227
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:38,030
it could kill us all I mean Elon said
first is going to steal our job and it's

3228
01:05:38,030 --> 01:05:38,040
first is going to steal our job and it's
 

3229
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:40,250
first is going to steal our job and it's
going to kill us right yeah and it's

3230
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:40,260
going to kill us right yeah and it's
 

3231
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:42,049
going to kill us right yeah and it's
it's probably not hyperbole it's

3232
01:05:42,049 --> 01:05:42,059
it's probably not hyperbole it's
 

3233
01:05:42,059 --> 01:05:44,270
it's probably not hyperbole it's
actually you know if it follows the loss

3234
01:05:44,270 --> 01:05:44,280
actually you know if it follows the loss
 

3235
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:46,549
actually you know if it follows the loss
of biological evolution which are just

3236
01:05:46,549 --> 01:05:46,559
of biological evolution which are just
 

3237
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:48,530
of biological evolution which are just
the laws of mathematics that's probably

3238
01:05:48,530 --> 01:05:48,540
the laws of mathematics that's probably
 

3239
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:51,049
the laws of mathematics that's probably
a good end point for it you know a a

3240
01:05:51,049 --> 01:05:51,059
a good end point for it you know a a
 

3241
01:05:51,059 --> 01:05:52,910
a good end point for it you know a a
potential endpoint

3242
01:05:52,910 --> 01:05:52,920
potential endpoint
 

3243
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:54,410
potential endpoint
so

3244
01:05:54,410 --> 01:05:54,420
so
 

3245
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:57,530
so
um we we need it's going to happen

3246
01:05:57,530 --> 01:05:57,540
um we we need it's going to happen
 

3247
01:05:57,540 --> 01:06:00,289
um we we need it's going to happen
but we need to make sure it's regulated

3248
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:00,299
but we need to make sure it's regulated
 

3249
01:06:00,299 --> 01:06:03,710
but we need to make sure it's regulated
and it's regulated properly for safety

3250
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:03,720
and it's regulated properly for safety
 

3251
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:07,010
and it's regulated properly for safety
in every country and and that includes

3252
01:06:07,010 --> 01:06:07,020
in every country and and that includes
 

3253
01:06:07,020 --> 01:06:09,890
in every country and and that includes
Russia and China and Iran

3254
01:06:09,890 --> 01:06:09,900
Russia and China and Iran
 

3255
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:12,230
Russia and China and Iran
right now we we should be putting all

3256
01:06:12,230 --> 01:06:12,240
right now we we should be putting all
 

3257
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:14,270
right now we we should be putting all
the weapons of war aside and sitting

3258
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:14,280
the weapons of war aside and sitting
 

3259
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:16,069
the weapons of war aside and sitting
down with those guys and saying how are

3260
01:06:16,069 --> 01:06:16,079
down with those guys and saying how are
 

3261
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:17,329
down with those guys and saying how are
we doing how are we going to do this

3262
01:06:17,329 --> 01:06:17,339
we doing how are we going to do this
 

3263
01:06:17,339 --> 01:06:20,270
we doing how are we going to do this
there's much more important things to do

3264
01:06:20,270 --> 01:06:20,280
there's much more important things to do
 

3265
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:22,609
there's much more important things to do
we're gonna this stuff is gonna kill us

3266
01:06:22,609 --> 01:06:22,619
we're gonna this stuff is gonna kill us
 

3267
01:06:22,619 --> 01:06:24,410
we're gonna this stuff is gonna kill us
if we don't figure out how to regulate

3268
01:06:24,410 --> 01:06:24,420
if we don't figure out how to regulate
 

3269
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:25,370
if we don't figure out how to regulate
it

3270
01:06:25,370 --> 01:06:25,380
it
 

3271
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:28,370
it
and and Leadership needs to look down

3272
01:06:28,370 --> 01:06:28,380
and and Leadership needs to look down
 

3273
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:30,589
and and Leadership needs to look down
the road at what what is the real risk

3274
01:06:30,589 --> 01:06:30,599
the road at what what is the real risk
 

3275
01:06:30,599 --> 01:06:32,990
the road at what what is the real risk
here and the real risk is that you know

3276
01:06:32,990 --> 01:06:33,000
here and the real risk is that you know
 

3277
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,589
here and the real risk is that you know
AI will it will you know enslave us for

3278
01:06:36,589 --> 01:06:36,599
AI will it will you know enslave us for
 

3279
01:06:36,599 --> 01:06:37,609
AI will it will you know enslave us for
one thing

3280
01:06:37,609 --> 01:06:37,619
one thing
 

3281
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:41,450
one thing
and you know and and then destroy us and

3282
01:06:41,450 --> 01:06:41,460
and you know and and then destroy us and
 

3283
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:42,890
and you know and and then destroy us and
do all this other stuff and how about

3284
01:06:42,890 --> 01:06:42,900
do all this other stuff and how about
 

3285
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:44,450
do all this other stuff and how about
biological weapons

3286
01:06:44,450 --> 01:06:44,460
biological weapons
 

3287
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:46,190
biological weapons
we're now all working on these

3288
01:06:46,190 --> 01:06:46,200
we're now all working on these
 

3289
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:47,930
we're now all working on these
biological weapons and we're doing

3290
01:06:47,930 --> 01:06:47,940
biological weapons and we're doing
 

3291
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:49,849
biological weapons and we're doing
biological weapons from

3292
01:06:49,849 --> 01:06:49,859
biological weapons from
 

3293
01:06:49,859 --> 01:06:53,630
biological weapons from
Ebola and um and you know Dengue fever

3294
01:06:53,630 --> 01:06:53,640
Ebola and um and you know Dengue fever
 

3295
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:57,049
Ebola and um and you know Dengue fever
and you know all of these other bad uh

3296
01:06:57,049 --> 01:06:57,059
and you know all of these other bad uh
 

3297
01:06:57,059 --> 01:06:58,609
and you know all of these other bad uh
things and we're making ethnic by

3298
01:06:58,609 --> 01:06:58,619
things and we're making ethnic by
 

3299
01:06:58,619 --> 01:07:01,250
things and we're making ethnic by
weapons bio weapons that can only kill

3300
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:01,260
weapons bio weapons that can only kill
 

3301
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:03,130
weapons bio weapons that can only kill
Russians

3302
01:07:03,130 --> 01:07:03,140
Russians
 

3303
01:07:03,140 --> 01:07:06,170
Russians
the Chinese are making that you know are

3304
01:07:06,170 --> 01:07:06,180
the Chinese are making that you know are
 

3305
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:08,809
the Chinese are making that you know are
can kill people who don't who don't have

3306
01:07:08,809 --> 01:07:08,819
can kill people who don't who don't have
 

3307
01:07:08,819 --> 01:07:10,789
can kill people who don't who don't have
Chinese genes

3308
01:07:10,789 --> 01:07:10,799
Chinese genes
 

3309
01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:12,950
Chinese genes
so all of this isn't out within reach

3310
01:07:12,950 --> 01:07:12,960
so all of this isn't out within reach
 

3311
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:15,410
so all of this isn't out within reach
we're actively doing it

3312
01:07:15,410 --> 01:07:15,420
we're actively doing it
 

3313
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:17,809
we're actively doing it
and we need to stop it and we can easily

3314
01:07:17,809 --> 01:07:17,819
and we need to stop it and we can easily
 

3315
01:07:17,819 --> 01:07:20,450
and we need to stop it and we can easily
a biological weapons treaty is the

3316
01:07:20,450 --> 01:07:20,460
a biological weapons treaty is the
 

3317
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:22,430
a biological weapons treaty is the
easiest thing in the world to do

3318
01:07:22,430 --> 01:07:22,440
easiest thing in the world to do
 

3319
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:25,549
easiest thing in the world to do
we can verify it we can enforce it and

3320
01:07:25,549 --> 01:07:25,559
we can verify it we can enforce it and
 

3321
01:07:25,559 --> 01:07:28,250
we can verify it we can enforce it and
everybody wants to agree to it it only

3322
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:28,260
everybody wants to agree to it it only
 

3323
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:30,589
everybody wants to agree to it it only
insane people do not want to want to

3324
01:07:30,589 --> 01:07:30,599
insane people do not want to want to
 

3325
01:07:30,599 --> 01:07:32,210
insane people do not want to want to
continue this kind of research there's

3326
01:07:32,210 --> 01:07:32,220
continue this kind of research there's
 

3327
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:34,849
continue this kind of research there's
no reason to do it so there's these

3328
01:07:34,849 --> 01:07:34,859
no reason to do it so there's these
 

3329
01:07:34,859 --> 01:07:37,069
no reason to do it so there's these
existential threats to all of humanity

3330
01:07:37,069 --> 01:07:37,079
existential threats to all of humanity
 

3331
01:07:37,079 --> 01:07:39,109
existential threats to all of humanity
now out there like Ai and biological

3332
01:07:39,109 --> 01:07:39,119

think he did you know maybe there was a
 

5103
01:43:07,380 --> 01:43:09,590
think he did you know maybe there was a
drug that got licensed while he was in

NIH that you know benefited people
 

5107
01:43:11,580 --> 01:43:13,669

that's certainly possible he was there
 

5109
01:43:13,679 --> 01:43:15,229
that's certainly possible he was there
for 50 years

for 50 years
 

5111

do and in the end
 

5473
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:44,470
do and in the end
you need a regulatory structure

5474
01:50:44,470 --> 01:50:44,480
you need a regulatory structure
 

5475
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:46,550
you need a regulatory structure
that is

5476
01:50:46,550 --> 01:50:46,560
that is

that's not something that is that is
controversial of course it will so and

5526
01:51:49,850 --> 01:51:49,860
controversial of course it will so and
 

5527
01:51:49,860 --> 01:51:52,070
controversial of course it will so and
then controversial to me I would like to

5528
01:51:52,070 --> 01:51:52,080
then controversial to me I would like to
 

5529
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:54,129
then controversial to me I would like to
think that scientists

5530
01:51:54,129 --> 01:51:54,139
think that scientists
 

5531
01:51:54,139 --> 01:51:56,750
think that scientists
I'm talking about population wide I'm

5532
01:51:56,750 --> 01:51:56,760
I'm talking about population wide I'm
 

5533
01:51:56,760 --> 01:51:58,729
I'm talking about population wide I'm
not talking about the individual but I'd

5534
01:51:58,729 --> 01:51:58,739
not talking about the individual but I'd
 

5535
01:51:58,739 --> 01:52:01,010
not talking about the individual but I'd
like to believe that scientists

5536
01:52:01,010 --> 01:52:01,020
like to believe that scientists
 

5537
01:52:01,020 --> 01:52:05,090
like to believe that scientists
I mean it in general career of a

5538
01:52:05,090 --> 01:52:05,100
I mean it in general career of a
 

5539
01:52:05,100 --> 01:52:06,890
I mean it in general career of a
scientist is not a very high paying job

5540
01:52:06,890 --> 01:52:06,900
scientist is not a very high paying job
 

5541
01:52:06,900 --> 01:52:09,050
scientist is not a very high paying job
I'd like to believe that people that go

5542
01:52:09,050 --> 01:52:09,060
I'd like to believe that people that go
 

5543
01:52:09,060 --> 01:52:11,689
I'd like to believe that people that go
into science that work at FDA they work

5544
01:52:11,689 --> 01:52:11,699
into science that work at FDA they work
 

5545
01:52:11,699 --> 01:52:14,750
into science that work at FDA they work
at NIH are doing it for a reason that's

5546
01:52:14,750 --> 01:52:14,760
at NIH are doing it for a reason that's
 

5547
01:52:14,760 --> 01:52:17,330
at NIH are doing it for a reason that's
not even correlated with money really

5548
01:52:17,330 --> 01:52:17,340
not even correlated with money really
 

5549
01:52:17,340 --> 01:52:18,830
not even correlated with money really
yeah

5550
01:52:18,830 --> 01:52:18,840
yeah
 

5551
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:20,750
yeah
and I think probably that's why they go

5552
01:52:20,750 --> 01:52:20,760
and I think probably that's why they go
 

5553
01:52:20,760 --> 01:52:22,550
and I think probably that's why they go
in there but scientists are corruptable

5554
01:52:22,550 --> 01:52:22,560
in there but scientists are corruptable
 

5555
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:25,510
in there but scientists are corruptable
and you know I the way

5556
01:52:25,510 --> 01:52:25,520
and you know I the way
 

5557
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:28,010
and you know I the way
the way that I can tell you that is that

5558
01:52:28,010 --> 01:52:28,020
the way that I can tell you that is that
 

5559
01:52:28,020 --> 01:52:30,530
the way that I can tell you that is that
I've brought over 500 losses and almost

5560
01:52:30,530 --> 01:52:30,540
I've brought over 500 losses and almost
 

5561
01:52:30,540 --> 01:52:31,850
I've brought over 500 losses and almost
all of them involve scientific

5562
01:52:31,850 --> 01:52:31,860
all of them involve scientific
 

5563
01:52:31,860 --> 01:52:34,189
all of them involve scientific
controversies and there are scientists

5564
01:52:34,189 --> 01:52:34,199
controversies and there are scientists

RSI there was a Yale Stanford and
 

5577
01:52:46,920 --> 01:52:48,709
RSI there was a Yale Stanford and
Harvard scientists and they were saying

01:53:07,980 --> 01:53:09,950
think it was Upton Sinclair who said
that it's very

5596
01:53:09,950 --> 01:53:09,960
that it's very
 

5597
01:53:09,960 --> 01:53:13,010
that it's very
um difficult to persuade a man of a fact

5598
01:53:13,010 --> 01:53:13,020
um difficult to persuade a man of a fact
 

5599
01:53:13,020 --> 01:53:14,990
um difficult to persuade a man of a fact
if the existence of that fact will

5600
01:53:14,990 --> 01:53:15,000
if the existence of that fact will
 

5601
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,629
if the existence of that fact will
diminish his salary and I think that's

diminish his salary and I think that's
 

5603
01:53:17,639 --> 01:53:20,149
diminish his salary and I think that's
true for all of us if they you know we

01:55:43,850 --> 01:55:43,860
calling you an anti-vaxxer
 

5725
01:55:43,860 --> 01:55:45,709
calling you an anti-vaxxer
and you've said that you're not

5726
01:55:45,709 --> 01:55:45,719
and you've said that you're not
 

5727
01:55:45,719 --> 01:55:50,270
and you've said that you're not
anti-vaccine you're pro-safe vaccine

5728
01:55:50,270 --> 01:55:50,280
anti-vaccine you're pro-safe vaccine
 

5729
01:55:50,280 --> 01:55:52,310
anti-vaccine you're pro-safe vaccine
difficult question can you name any

5730
01:55:52,310 --> 01:55:52,320
difficult question can you name any
 

5731
01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:54,890
difficult question can you name any
vaccines that you think are good

5732
01:55:54,890 --> 01:55:54,900
vaccines that you think are good
 

5733
01:55:54,900 --> 01:55:56,990
vaccines that you think are good
uh I think some of the live virus

5734
01:55:56,990 --> 01:55:57,000
uh I think some of the live virus
 

5735
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,570
uh I think some of the live virus
vaccines are probably

5736
01:55:59,570 --> 01:55:59,580
vaccines are probably
 

5737
01:55:59,580 --> 01:56:02,450
vaccines are probably
uh so of earning more problems than

5738
01:56:02,450 --> 01:56:02,460
uh so of earning more problems than
 

5739
01:56:02,460 --> 01:56:04,330
uh so of earning more problems than
they're causing

5740
01:56:04,330 --> 01:56:04,340
they're causing
 

5741
01:56:04,340 --> 01:56:07,790
they're causing
there's no vaccine that is you know safe

5742
01:56:07,790 --> 01:56:07,800
there's no vaccine that is you know safe
 

5743
01:56:07,800 --> 01:56:08,990
there's no vaccine that is you know safe
and effective

5744
01:56:08,990 --> 01:56:09,000
and effective
 

5745
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,350
and effective
the into big words

5746
01:56:11,350 --> 01:56:11,360
the into big words
 

5747
01:56:11,360 --> 01:56:14,209
the into big words
can we talk about well here's the

5748
01:56:14,209 --> 01:56:14,219
can we talk about well here's the
 

5749
01:56:14,219 --> 01:56:15,609
can we talk about well here's the
problem here's the problem

5750
01:56:15,609 --> 01:56:15,619
problem here's the problem
 

5751
01:56:15,619 --> 01:56:18,050
problem here's the problem
yeah here's the problem

5752
01:56:18,050 --> 01:56:18,060
yeah here's the problem
 

5753
01:56:18,060 --> 01:56:20,870
yeah here's the problem
the polio vaccine contained a

5754
01:56:20,870 --> 01:56:20,880
the polio vaccine contained a
 

5755
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:25,250
the polio vaccine contained a
um a virus called semi virus 40 sv40

5756
01:56:25,250 --> 01:56:25,260
um a virus called semi virus 40 sv40
 

5757
01:56:25,260 --> 01:56:28,370
um a virus called semi virus 40 sv40
it's it's one of the most carcinogenic

5758
01:56:28,370 --> 01:56:28,380
it's it's one of the most carcinogenic
 

5759
01:56:28,380 --> 01:56:30,410
it's it's one of the most carcinogenic
materials that is known to man in fact

5760
01:56:30,410 --> 01:56:30,420
materials that is known to man in fact
 

5761
01:56:30,420 --> 01:56:32,510
materials that is known to man in fact
it's used Now by scientists around the

5762
01:56:32,510 --> 01:56:32,520
it's used Now by scientists around the
 

5763
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:34,850
it's used Now by scientists around the
world to induce tumors and rats and

5764
01:56:34,850 --> 01:56:34,860
world to induce tumors and rats and
 

5765
01:56:34,860 --> 01:56:36,770
world to induce tumors and rats and
guinea pigs in labs

5766
01:56:36,770 --> 01:56:36,780
guinea pigs in labs
 

5767
01:56:36,780 --> 01:56:39,590
guinea pigs in labs
but it was in that vaccine 98 million

5768
01:56:39,590 --> 01:56:39,600
but it was in that vaccine 98 million
 

5769
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:41,330
but it was in that vaccine 98 million
people who got that vaccine in my

5770
01:56:41,330 --> 01:56:41,340
people who got that vaccine in my
 

5771
01:56:41,340 --> 01:56:43,189
people who got that vaccine in my
generation got it and now you've had

5772
01:56:43,189 --> 01:56:43,199
generation got it and now you've had
 

5773
01:56:43,199 --> 01:56:44,570
generation got it and now you've had
this explosion

5774
01:56:44,570 --> 01:56:44,580
this explosion
 

5775
01:56:44,580 --> 01:56:46,669
this explosion
of soft tissue cancers in our generation

5776
01:56:46,669 --> 01:56:46,679
of soft tissue cancers in our generation
 

5777
01:56:46,679 --> 01:56:48,050
of soft tissue cancers in our generation
that kill many many many many many many

5778
01:56:48,050 --> 01:56:48,060
that kill many many many many many many
 

5779
01:56:48,060 --> 01:56:51,290
that kill many many many many many many
more people than polio ever did so if

5780
01:56:51,290 --> 01:56:51,300
more people than polio ever did so if
 

5781
01:56:51,300 --> 01:56:53,390
more people than polio ever did so if
you say to me the you know the polio

5782
01:56:53,390 --> 01:56:53,400
you say to me the you know the polio
 

5783
01:56:53,400 --> 01:56:55,550
you say to me the you know the polio
vaccine was effective against polio I'm

5784
01:56:55,550 --> 01:56:55,560
vaccine was effective against polio I'm
 

5785
01:56:55,560 --> 01:56:58,490
vaccine was effective against polio I'm
going to say yes if I say if you said to

5786
01:56:58,490 --> 01:56:58,500
going to say yes if I say if you said to
 

5787
01:56:58,500 --> 01:57:01,129
going to say yes if I say if you said to
me did it kill more people that it ever

5788
01:57:01,129 --> 01:57:01,139
me did it kill more people that it ever
 

5789
01:57:01,139 --> 01:57:02,930
me did it kill more people that it ever
caused more deaths than I've heard I I

5790
01:57:02,930 --> 01:57:02,940
caused more deaths than I've heard I I
 

5791
01:57:02,940 --> 01:57:04,310
caused more deaths than I've heard I I
would say I don't know because we don't

5792
01:57:04,310 --> 01:57:04,320
would say I don't know because we don't
 

5793
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:06,050
would say I don't know because we don't
have the data on that

5794
01:57:06,050 --> 01:57:06,060
have the data on that
 

5795
01:57:06,060 --> 01:57:08,990
have the data on that
so but let's talk well you know so we

5796
01:57:08,990 --> 01:57:09,000
so but let's talk well you know so we
 

5797
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:10,669
so but let's talk well you know so we
kind of have to narrow in on is it

5798
01:57:10,669 --> 01:57:10,679
kind of have to narrow in on is it
 

5799
01:57:10,679 --> 01:57:11,870
kind of have to narrow in on is it
effective against the thing it's

5800
01:57:11,870 --> 01:57:11,880
effective against the thing it's
 

5801
01:57:11,880 --> 01:57:13,490
effective against the thing it's
supposed to fight oh well a lot of them

5802
01:57:13,490 --> 01:57:13,500
supposed to fight oh well a lot of them
 

5803
01:57:13,500 --> 01:57:15,649
supposed to fight oh well a lot of them
are let me give you an example

5804
01:57:15,649 --> 01:57:15,659
are let me give you an example
 

5805
01:57:15,659 --> 01:57:17,750
are let me give you an example
the most popular vaccine in the world is

5806
01:57:17,750 --> 01:57:17,760
the most popular vaccine in the world is
 

5807
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:19,910
the most popular vaccine in the world is
the dtp vaccine diphtheria tetanus and

5808
01:57:19,910 --> 01:57:19,920
the dtp vaccine diphtheria tetanus and
 

5809
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:22,729
the dtp vaccine diphtheria tetanus and
pertussis it was used in this kind of

5810
01:57:22,729 --> 01:57:22,739
pertussis it was used in this kind of
 

5811
01:57:22,739 --> 01:57:25,550
pertussis it was used in this kind of
introduced in this country around 1980

5812
01:57:25,550 --> 01:57:25,560
introduced in this country around 1980
 

5813
01:57:25,560 --> 01:57:29,149
introduced in this country around 1980
That vaccine caused so many injuries the

5814
01:57:29,149 --> 01:57:29,159
That vaccine caused so many injuries the
 

5815
01:57:29,159 --> 01:57:31,669
That vaccine caused so many injuries the
Elias which was the manufacturer was

5816
01:57:31,669 --> 01:57:31,679
Elias which was the manufacturer was
 

5817
01:57:31,679 --> 01:57:33,830
Elias which was the manufacturer was
said to the Reagan Administration we are

5818
01:57:33,830 --> 01:57:33,840
said to the Reagan Administration we are
 

5819
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:36,770
said to the Reagan Administration we are
now paying twenty dollars in Downstream

5820
01:57:36,770 --> 01:57:36,780
now paying twenty dollars in Downstream
 

5821
01:57:36,780 --> 01:57:38,450
now paying twenty dollars in Downstream
liabilities for every dollar that we're

5822
01:57:38,450 --> 01:57:38,460
liabilities for every dollar that we're
 

5823
01:57:38,460 --> 01:57:40,850
liabilities for every dollar that we're
making in profits and we are getting out

5824
01:57:40,850 --> 01:57:40,860
making in profits and we are getting out
 

5825
01:57:40,860 --> 01:57:42,410
making in profits and we are getting out
of the business unless you give us

5826
01:57:42,410 --> 01:57:42,420
of the business unless you give us
 

5827
01:57:42,420 --> 01:57:45,410
of the business unless you give us
permanent immunity from liability

5828
01:57:45,410 --> 01:57:45,420
permanent immunity from liability
 

5829
01:57:45,420 --> 01:57:48,109
permanent immunity from liability
so the vaccine companies and we're given

5830
01:57:48,109 --> 01:57:48,119
so the vaccine companies and we're given
 

5831
01:57:48,119 --> 01:57:50,870
so the vaccine companies and we're given
and and by the way Reagan said at that

5832
01:57:50,870 --> 01:57:50,880
and and by the way Reagan said at that
 

5833
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:52,430
and and by the way Reagan said at that
time why don't you just make the vaccine

5834
01:57:52,430 --> 01:57:52,440
time why don't you just make the vaccine
 

5835
01:57:52,440 --> 01:57:54,229
time why don't you just make the vaccine
safe

5836
01:57:54,229 --> 01:57:54,239
safe
 

5837
01:57:54,239 --> 01:57:56,810
safe
and why is that because vaccines are

5838
01:57:56,810 --> 01:57:56,820
and why is that because vaccines are
 

5839
01:57:56,820 --> 01:57:59,390
and why is that because vaccines are
inherently unsafe they said unavoidably

5840
01:57:59,390 --> 01:57:59,400
inherently unsafe they said unavoidably
 

5841
01:57:59,400 --> 01:58:02,390
inherently unsafe they said unavoidably
unsafe you cannot make them safe

5842
01:58:02,390 --> 01:58:02,400
unsafe you cannot make them safe
 

5843
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:05,270
unsafe you cannot make them safe
and so when Reagan wrote the Bill and

5844
01:58:05,270 --> 01:58:05,280
and so when Reagan wrote the Bill and
 

5845
01:58:05,280 --> 01:58:07,250
and so when Reagan wrote the Bill and
passed it the bill says and it's

5846
01:58:07,250 --> 01:58:07,260
passed it the bill says and it's
 

5847
01:58:07,260 --> 01:58:08,990
passed it the bill says and it's
Preamble is because vaccines are

5848
01:58:08,990 --> 01:58:09,000
Preamble is because vaccines are
 

5849
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:12,169
Preamble is because vaccines are
unavoidably unsafe and the Bruce Woods

5850
01:58:12,169 --> 01:58:12,179
unavoidably unsafe and the Bruce Woods
 

5851
01:58:12,179 --> 01:58:13,609
unavoidably unsafe and the Bruce Woods
case which was the Supreme Court case

5852
01:58:13,609 --> 01:58:13,619
case which was the Supreme Court case
 

5853
01:58:13,619 --> 01:58:15,890
case which was the Supreme Court case
that uphold upheld that bill

5854
01:58:15,890 --> 01:58:15,900
that uphold upheld that bill
 

5855
01:58:15,900 --> 01:58:18,109
that uphold upheld that bill
uses that same language vaccines cannot

5856
01:58:18,109 --> 01:58:18,119
uses that same language vaccines cannot
 

5857
01:58:18,119 --> 01:58:20,030
uses that same language vaccines cannot
be made safe they're unavoidably unsafe

5858
01:58:20,030 --> 01:58:20,040
be made safe they're unavoidably unsafe
 

5859
01:58:20,040 --> 01:58:22,370
be made safe they're unavoidably unsafe
so this is what the law says now I just

5860
01:58:22,370 --> 01:58:22,380
so this is what the law says now I just
 

5861
01:58:22,380 --> 01:58:24,310
so this is what the law says now I just
want to finish this story because this

5862
01:58:24,310 --> 01:58:24,320
want to finish this story because this
 

5863
01:58:24,320 --> 01:58:28,010
want to finish this story because this
illustrates very well your your question

5864
01:58:28,010 --> 01:58:28,020
illustrates very well your your question
 

5865
01:58:28,020 --> 01:58:31,250
illustrates very well your your question
uh that the dtp vaccine was discontinued

5866
01:58:31,250 --> 01:58:31,260
uh that the dtp vaccine was discontinued
 

5867
01:58:31,260 --> 01:58:33,950
uh that the dtp vaccine was discontinued
in this country and it was discontinued

5868
01:58:33,950 --> 01:58:33,960
in this country and it was discontinued
 

5869
01:58:33,960 --> 01:58:36,350
in this country and it was discontinued
in Europe because that so many kids were

5870
01:58:36,350 --> 01:58:36,360
in Europe because that so many kids were
 

5871
01:58:36,360 --> 01:58:38,149
in Europe because that so many kids were
being injured by it

5872
01:58:38,149 --> 01:58:38,159
being injured by it
 

5873
01:58:38,159 --> 01:58:41,270
being injured by it
however The Who and Bill Gates gives it

5874
01:58:41,270 --> 01:58:41,280
however The Who and Bill Gates gives it
 

5875
01:58:41,280 --> 01:58:44,089
however The Who and Bill Gates gives it
to 161 million African children every

5876
01:58:44,089 --> 01:58:44,099
to 161 million African children every
 

5877
01:58:44,099 --> 01:58:45,430
to 161 million African children every
year

5878
01:58:45,430 --> 01:58:45,440
year
 

5879
01:58:45,440 --> 01:58:47,149
year
and

5880
01:58:47,149 --> 01:58:47,159

uh so Joe Rogan proposed just such a
 

6223
02:05:39,719 --> 02:05:41,330
uh so Joe Rogan proposed just such a
debate which is quite

6224
02:05:41,330 --> 02:05:41,340
debate which is quite
 

6225
02:05:41,340 --> 02:05:43,250
debate which is quite
fascinating to see how much attention

6226
02:05:43,250 --> 02:05:43,260
fascinating to see how much attention
 

6227
02:05:43,260 --> 02:05:46,550
fascinating to see how much attention
and how much funding it garnered uh the

6228
02:05:46,550 --> 02:05:46,560
and how much funding it garnered uh the
 

6229
02:05:46,560 --> 02:05:48,830
and how much funding it garnered uh the
debate between you and Peter Hotes why

6230
02:05:48,830 --> 02:05:48,840
debate between you and Peter Hotes why
 

6231
02:05:48,840 --> 02:05:51,709
debate between you and Peter Hotes why
do you think uh Peter rejected the offer

6232

not going to look into his head
 

6237
02:05:56,580 --> 02:05:59,030
not going to look into his head
but what I will say is if you're a

6238
02:05:59,030 --> 02:05:59,040
but what I will say is if you're a
 

6239
02:05:59,040 --> 02:06:01,129
but what I will say is if you're a
scientist and you're making public

6240
02:06:01,129 --> 02:06:01,139
scientist and you're making public
 

6241
02:06:01,139 --> 02:06:04,129
scientist and you're making public
recommendations based upon what you say

recommendations based upon what you say
 

6243
02:06:04,139 --> 02:06:06,770
recommendations based upon what you say
is evidence-based science you ought to

6244
02:06:06,770 --> 02:06:06,780
is evidence-based science you ought to
 

6245
02:06:06,780 --> 02:06:08,750
is evidence-based science you ought to
be able to defend that you ought to be

6246
02:06:08,750 --> 02:06:08,760
be able to defend that you ought to be
 

6247
02:06:08,760 --> 02:06:10,550
be able to defend that you ought to be
evident defended in a public forum and

6248
02:06:10,550 --> 02:06:10,560
evident defended in a public forum and

and you know uh so I I you know if
 

6255
02:06:19,199 --> 02:06:21,109
and you know uh so I I you know if
you're a scientist Science is based on

6256
02:06:21,109 --> 02:06:21,119
you're a scientist Science is based on
 

6257
02:06:21,119 --> 02:06:24,350
you're a scientist Science is based on
is rooted in logic and reason and if you

6258
02:06:24,350 --> 02:06:24,360
is rooted in logic and reason and if you
 

6259
02:06:24,360 --> 02:06:26,870
is rooted in logic and reason and if you
can't use logic and reason to defend

6260
02:06:26,870 --> 02:06:26,880
can't use logic and reason to defend
 

6261
02:06:26,880 --> 02:06:28,550
can't use logic and reason to defend
your position

6262
02:06:28,550 --> 02:06:28,560
your position
 

6263
02:06:28,560 --> 02:06:30,589
your position
and by the way

6264
02:06:30,589 --> 02:06:30,599
and by the way
 

6265
02:06:30,599 --> 02:06:34,129
and by the way
I know almost all of the studies you

6266
02:06:34,129 --> 02:06:34,139
I know almost all of the studies you
 

6267
02:06:34,139 --> 02:06:36,169
I know almost all of the studies you
know I've written books on men

6268
02:06:36,169 --> 02:06:36,179
know I've written books on men
 

6269
02:06:36,179 --> 02:06:38,390
know I've written books on men
we've made a big effort to assemble all

6270
02:06:38,390 --> 02:06:38,400
we've made a big effort to assemble all
 

6271
02:06:38,400 --> 02:06:40,550
we've made a big effort to assemble all
the studies on both sides

6272
02:06:40,550 --> 02:06:40,560
the studies on both sides
 

6273
02:06:40,560 --> 02:06:42,830
the studies on both sides
and so I'm prepared to talk about those

6274
02:06:42,830 --> 02:06:42,840
and so I'm prepared to talk about those
 

6275
02:06:42,840 --> 02:06:44,750
and so I'm prepared to talk about those
studies and I'm prepared to submit them

6276
02:06:44,750 --> 02:06:44,760
studies and I'm prepared to submit them
 

6277
02:06:44,760 --> 02:06:48,050
studies and I'm prepared to submit them
in advance you know and uh for each of

6278
02:06:48,050 --> 02:06:48,060
in advance you know and uh for each of
 

6279
02:06:48,060 --> 02:06:49,550
in advance you know and uh for each of
the points

6280

the points
 

6281
02:06:49,560 --> 02:06:51,709
the points
and by the way I've done that with Peter

6282
02:06:51,709 --> 02:06:51,719
and by the way I've done that with Peter
 

6283
02:06:51,719 --> 02:06:53,990
and by the way I've done that with Peter
Hotes you know I've I've actually

6284
02:06:53,990 --> 02:06:54,000
Hotes you know I've I've actually
 

6285
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,390
Hotes you know I've I've actually
because I had this um this kind of

6286
02:06:56,390 --> 02:06:56,400
because I had this um this kind of
 

6287
02:06:56,400 --> 02:06:58,550
because I had this um this kind of
informal debate with them

6288
02:06:58,550 --> 02:06:58,560
informal debate with them
 

6289
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:00,850
informal debate with them
several years ago with them with a

6290
02:07:00,850 --> 02:07:00,860
several years ago with them with a
 

6291
02:07:00,860 --> 02:07:04,070
several years ago with them with a
referee at that time and we were

6292
02:07:04,070 --> 02:07:04,080
referee at that time and we were
 

6293
02:07:04,080 --> 02:07:06,890
referee at that time and we were
debating not only by phone but by email

6294
02:07:06,890 --> 02:07:06,900
debating not only by phone but by email
 

6295
02:07:06,900 --> 02:07:09,470
debating not only by phone but by email
and on those emails every point that he

6296
02:07:09,470 --> 02:07:09,480
and on those emails every point that he
 

6297
02:07:09,480 --> 02:07:11,750
and on those emails every point that he
would make I would cite science and he

6298
02:07:11,750 --> 02:07:11,760
would make I would cite science and he
 

6299
02:07:11,760 --> 02:07:13,729
would make I would cite science and he
could never come back with science he

6300
02:07:13,729 --> 02:07:13,739
could never come back with science he
 

6301
02:07:13,739 --> 02:07:16,370
could never come back with science he
could never come back with Publications

he would give Publications that had
 

6305
02:07:18,780 --> 02:07:21,050
he would give Publications that had
nothing to do with for example if I'm

I'd said about thimerosal and not one of
 

6315

one of the biggest sanitariums in Europe
 

6989
02:20:48,120 --> 02:20:51,710
one of the biggest sanitariums in Europe
in Zurich and he was sitting up on the

6990
02:20:51,710 --> 02:20:51,720
in Zurich and he was sitting up on the
 

6991
02:20:51,720 --> 02:20:54,770
in Zurich and he was sitting up on the
third floor of this building

6992
02:20:54,770 --> 02:20:54,780
third floor of this building
 

6993
02:20:54,780 --> 02:20:58,370
third floor of this building
and he's talking to a patient who had

6994
02:20:58,370 --> 02:20:58,380
and he's talking to a patient who had
 

6995
02:20:58,380 --> 02:21:00,830
and he's talking to a patient who had
who was talking describing her dream to

6996
02:21:00,830 --> 02:21:00,840
who was talking describing her dream to
 

6997
02:21:00,840 --> 02:21:01,730
who was talking describing her dream to

and the fulcrum of that dream was a
 

7001
02:21:03,720 --> 02:21:07,010
and the fulcrum of that dream was a
scarab beetle which was a insect that is

02:21:07,010 --> 02:21:07,020
scarab beetle which was a insect that is

and um
he and he while he was talking to her he

7016
02:21:25,610 --> 02:21:25,620
he and he while he was talking to her he
 

7017
02:21:25,620 --> 02:21:27,410
he and he while he was talking to her he
heard this bing bing bing on the window

7018
02:21:27,410 --> 02:21:27,420
heard this bing bing bing on the window
 

7019
02:21:27,420 --> 02:21:29,870
heard this bing bing bing on the window
behind him and he didn't want to turn

7020
02:21:29,870 --> 02:21:29,880
behind him and he didn't want to turn
 

7021
02:21:29,880 --> 02:21:31,490
behind him and he didn't want to turn
around to take his attention off her but

around to take his attention off her but
 

7023
02:21:31,500 --> 02:21:34,490
around to take his attention off her but
finally he does it he's in exasperation

7024
02:21:34,490 --> 02:21:34,500
finally he does it he's in exasperation
 

7025
02:21:34,500 --> 02:21:36,050
finally he does it he's in exasperation
he turns around he throws up the window

7026
02:21:36,050 --> 02:21:36,060
he turns around he throws up the window
 

7027
02:21:36,060 --> 02:21:38,030
he turns around he throws up the window
and a scarab beetle flies didn't lands

7028
02:21:38,030 --> 02:21:38,040
and a scarab beetle flies didn't lands
 

7029
02:21:38,040 --> 02:21:40,010
and a scarab beetle flies didn't lands
in his head and he shows it to the woman

7030
02:21:40,010 --> 02:21:40,020
in his head and he shows it to the woman
 

7031
02:21:40,020 --> 02:21:41,570
in his head and he shows it to the woman
and he says is this what you were

7032
02:21:41,570 --> 02:21:41,580
and he says is this what you were
 

7033
02:21:41,580 --> 02:21:42,889
and he says is this what you were
thinking of is this what you were

7034
02:21:42,889 --> 02:21:42,899
thinking of is this what you were
 

7035
02:21:42,899 --> 02:21:46,190
thinking of is this what you were
dreaming about and he he was struck by

7036
02:21:46,190 --> 02:21:46,200
dreaming about and he he was struck by
 

7037
02:21:46,200 --> 02:21:47,809
dreaming about and he he was struck by
that experience experience which was

7038
02:21:47,809 --> 02:21:47,819
that experience experience which was
 

7039
02:21:47,819 --> 02:21:49,550
that experience experience which was
similar to other experiences he's had

7040
02:21:49,550 --> 02:21:49,560
similar to other experiences he's had
 

7041
02:21:49,560 --> 02:21:51,050
similar to other experiences he's had
like that and that's what synchronicity

7042
02:21:51,050 --> 02:21:51,060
like that and that's what synchronicity
 

7043
02:21:51,060 --> 02:21:52,790
like that and that's what synchronicity
means it's a

7044
02:21:52,790 --> 02:21:52,800
means it's a
 

7045
02:21:52,800 --> 02:21:56,210
means it's a
it's a an incident a coincidence you

7046
02:21:56,210 --> 02:21:56,220
it's a an incident a coincidence you
 

7047
02:21:56,220 --> 02:22:00,170
it's a an incident a coincidence you
know and like if so if you're if you're

7048
02:22:00,170 --> 02:22:00,180
know and like if so if you're if you're
 

7049
02:22:00,180 --> 02:22:02,389
know and like if so if you're if you're
talking with somebody about somebody

7050
02:22:02,389 --> 02:22:02,399
talking with somebody about somebody
 

7051
02:22:02,399 --> 02:22:03,889
talking with somebody about somebody
that you haven't thought about in 20

7052
02:22:03,889 --> 02:22:03,899
that you haven't thought about in 20
 

7053
02:22:03,899 --> 02:22:05,630
that you haven't thought about in 20
years and that person calls on the phone

7054
02:22:05,630 --> 02:22:05,640
years and that person calls on the phone
 

7055
02:22:05,640 --> 02:22:09,050
years and that person calls on the phone
that's synchronicity oh and he believed

7056
02:22:09,050 --> 02:22:09,060
that's synchronicity oh and he believed
 

7057
02:22:09,060 --> 02:22:11,389
that's synchronicity oh and he believed
it was a way that God intervened in our

7058
02:22:11,389 --> 02:22:11,399
it was a way that God intervened in our
 

7059
02:22:11,399 --> 02:22:13,670
it was a way that God intervened in our
lives that broke all the all the rules

7060
02:22:13,670 --> 02:22:13,680
lives that broke all the all the rules
 

7061
02:22:13,680 --> 02:22:17,030
lives that broke all the all the rules
of nature that he had set up the rules

7062
02:22:17,030 --> 02:22:17,040
of nature that he had set up the rules
 

7063
02:22:17,040 --> 02:22:19,130
of nature that he had set up the rules
of physics the rules of mathematics or

7064
02:22:19,130 --> 02:22:19,140
of physics the rules of mathematics or
 

7065
02:22:19,140 --> 02:22:21,710
of physics the rules of mathematics or
you know to reach in and sort of tap us

7066
02:22:21,710 --> 02:22:21,720
you know to reach in and sort of tap us
 

7067
02:22:21,720 --> 02:22:24,050
you know to reach in and sort of tap us
on their shoulder and say I'm here

7068
02:22:24,050 --> 02:22:24,060
on their shoulder and say I'm here
 

7069
02:22:24,060 --> 02:22:27,410
on their shoulder and say I'm here
and um and so he tried to reproduce that

7070
02:22:27,410 --> 02:22:27,420
and um and so he tried to reproduce that
 

7071
02:22:27,420 --> 02:22:29,330
and um and so he tried to reproduce that
in a clinical setting

7072
02:22:29,330 --> 02:22:29,340
in a clinical setting
 

7073
02:22:29,340 --> 02:22:31,790
in a clinical setting
and he would put one guy in one room and

7074
02:22:31,790 --> 02:22:31,800
and he would put one guy in one room and
 

7075
02:22:31,800 --> 02:22:32,990
and he would put one guy in one room and
another guy in another room and have

7076
02:22:32,990 --> 02:22:33,000
another guy in another room and have
 

7077
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:34,849
another guy in another room and have
them flip guards and then guess what the

7078
02:22:34,849 --> 02:22:34,859
them flip guards and then guess what the
 

7079
02:22:34,859 --> 02:22:36,290
them flip guards and then guess what the
other guy had flipped

7080
02:22:36,290 --> 02:22:36,300
other guy had flipped
 

7081
02:22:36,300 --> 02:22:37,910
other guy had flipped
and he believed that if he could beat

7082
02:22:37,910 --> 02:22:37,920
and he believed that if he could beat
 

7083
02:22:37,920 --> 02:22:40,370
and he believed that if he could beat
the laws of chance laws of mathematics

7084
02:22:40,370 --> 02:22:40,380
the laws of chance laws of mathematics
 

7085
02:22:40,380 --> 02:22:42,530
the laws of chance laws of mathematics
and he would have prove the existence of

7086
02:22:42,530 --> 02:22:42,540
and he would have prove the existence of
 

7087
02:22:42,540 --> 02:22:45,290
and he would have prove the existence of
a of an unnatural law a supernatural law

7088
02:22:45,290 --> 02:22:45,300
a of an unnatural law a supernatural law
 

7089
02:22:45,300 --> 02:22:46,849
a of an unnatural law a supernatural law
and that was the first step to proving

7090
02:22:46,849 --> 02:22:46,859
and that was the first step to proving
 

7091
02:22:46,859 --> 02:22:48,650
and that was the first step to proving
the existence of a god

7092
02:22:48,650 --> 02:22:48,660
the existence of a god
 

7093
02:22:48,660 --> 02:22:51,110
the existence of a god
he never succeeds in doing it but he

7094
02:22:51,110 --> 02:22:51,120
he never succeeds in doing it but he
 

7095
02:22:51,120 --> 02:22:52,670
he never succeeds in doing it but he
says in the book

7096
02:22:52,670 --> 02:22:52,680
says in the book
 

7097
02:22:52,680 --> 02:22:54,410
says in the book
um even though I can't prove using

7098
02:22:54,410 --> 02:22:54,420
um even though I can't prove using
 

7099
02:22:54,420 --> 02:22:56,150
um even though I can't prove using
empirical and scientific tools the

7100
02:22:56,150 --> 02:22:56,160
empirical and scientific tools the
 

7101
02:22:56,160 --> 02:22:57,950
empirical and scientific tools the
existence of a god

7102
02:22:57,950 --> 02:22:57,960
existence of a god
 

7103
02:22:57,960 --> 02:23:00,410
existence of a god
I can show through anecdotal evidence

7104
02:23:00,410 --> 02:23:00,420
I can show through anecdotal evidence
 

7105
02:23:00,420 --> 02:23:03,349
I can show through anecdotal evidence
having seen thousands of patients come

7106
02:23:03,349 --> 02:23:03,359
having seen thousands of patients come
 

7107
02:23:03,359 --> 02:23:05,210
having seen thousands of patients come
from this institution that people who

7108
02:23:05,210 --> 02:23:05,220
from this institution that people who
 

7109
02:23:05,220 --> 02:23:07,190
from this institution that people who
believe in God get better faster and

7110
02:23:07,190 --> 02:23:07,200
believe in God get better faster and
 

7111
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:09,290
believe in God get better faster and
that the recovery is more enduring than

7112
02:23:09,290 --> 02:23:09,300
that the recovery is more enduring than
 

7113
02:23:09,300 --> 02:23:10,910
that the recovery is more enduring than
people who don't

7114
02:23:10,910 --> 02:23:10,920
people who don't
 

7115
02:23:10,920 --> 02:23:13,670
people who don't
and for me hearing that was more

7116
02:23:13,670 --> 02:23:13,680
and for me hearing that was more
 

7117
02:23:13,680 --> 02:23:16,670
and for me hearing that was more
impactful than if he had claimed that he

7118
02:23:16,670 --> 02:23:16,680
impactful than if he had claimed that he
 

7119
02:23:16,680 --> 02:23:18,050
impactful than if he had claimed that he
had proved the existence of a God

7120
02:23:18,050 --> 02:23:18,060
had proved the existence of a God
 

7121
02:23:18,060 --> 02:23:20,150
had proved the existence of a God
because I would not believe that

7122
02:23:20,150 --> 02:23:20,160
because I would not believe that
 

7123
02:23:20,160 --> 02:23:23,150
because I would not believe that
but I I was already at a mindset where I

7124
02:23:23,150 --> 02:23:23,160
but I I was already at a mindset where I
 

7125
02:23:23,160 --> 02:23:25,309
but I I was already at a mindset where I
would have done anything I could

7126
02:23:25,309 --> 02:23:25,319
would have done anything I could
 

7127
02:23:25,319 --> 02:23:27,530
would have done anything I could
to improve my chances of never having to

7128
02:23:27,530 --> 02:23:27,540
to improve my chances of never having to
 

7129
02:23:27,540 --> 02:23:29,990
to improve my chances of never having to
take drugs again by even one percent and

7130
02:23:29,990 --> 02:23:30,000
take drugs again by even one percent and
 

7131
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,570
take drugs again by even one percent and
if believing in God

7132
02:23:32,570 --> 02:23:32,580
if believing in God
 

7133
02:23:32,580 --> 02:23:34,610
if believing in God
was gonna help me whether there's a God

7134
02:23:34,610 --> 02:23:34,620
was gonna help me whether there's a God
 

7135
02:23:34,620 --> 02:23:38,110
was gonna help me whether there's a God
up there or not believing in one itself

7136
02:23:38,110 --> 02:23:38,120
up there or not believing in one itself
 

7137
02:23:38,120 --> 02:23:40,429
up there or not believing in one itself
had the power to help me I was going to

7138
02:23:40,429 --> 02:23:40,439
had the power to help me I was going to
 

7139
02:23:40,439 --> 02:23:42,290
had the power to help me I was going to
do that so then the question is how do

7140
02:23:42,290 --> 02:23:42,300
do that so then the question is how do
 

7141
02:23:42,300 --> 02:23:43,849
do that so then the question is how do
you start believing in something that

7142
02:23:43,849 --> 02:23:43,859
you start believing in something that
 

7143
02:23:43,859 --> 02:23:46,070
you start believing in something that
