00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:16,880
how much is you know people talk about
 

1987
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,750
how much is you know people talk about
that with poker for example how much is

1988
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:19,760
that with poker for example how much is
 

1989
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,270
that with poker for example how much is
the value of this

1990
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:21,280
the value of this
 

1991
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,670
the value of this
you know so like some people argue that

1992
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:23,680

be more
like uh the analogy there with with

2002
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:33,200

00:40:59,190 --> 00:40:59,200
know finish a lot of their opponents the
 

2263

know finish a lot of their opponents the
same as me in the beginning i was

2264
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:00,480
same as me in the beginning i was
 

2265
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,309
same as me in the beginning i was
finishing all of my opponent but there's

2266
00:41:02,309 --> 00:41:02,319
finishing all of my opponent but there's
 

2267
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:05,030
finishing all of my opponent but there's
a time that the entire ufc roster is

2268
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:05,040
a time that the entire ufc roster is
 

2269
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,710
a time that the entire ufc roster is
studying you

2270
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:06,720
studying you
 

2271
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,109
studying you
and they found ways to perhaps not

2272
00:41:09,109 --> 00:41:09,119
and they found ways to perhaps not
 

2273
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:11,910
and they found ways to perhaps not
beating you but they found a way to

2274
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:11,920
beating you but they found a way to
 

2275
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,270
beating you but they found a way to
navigate to

2276
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:13,280
navigate to
 

2277
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,790
navigate to
the the fight in a way that they

2278
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:14,800
the the fight in a way that they
 

2279
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,950
the the fight in a way that they
minimize the damage you know what i mean

2280
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:16,960
minimize the damage you know what i mean

there's a cause for everything and if
 

4399
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:36,870

i'm doing something because of something
 

4401
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:38,709
i'm doing something because of something
because of a cause by definition there's

4402
01:18:38,709 --> 01:18:38,719
because of a cause by definition there's
 

4403
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:40,310
because of a cause by definition there's
no free will in a way you know if

4404
01:18:40,310 --> 01:18:40,320
no free will in a way you know if
 

4405
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:43,110
no free will in a way you know if
there's a cause by definition

4406
01:18:43,110 --> 01:18:43,120
there's a cause by definition
 

4407
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:44,709
there's a cause by definition
there's not how does that make you feel

4408
01:18:44,709 --> 01:18:44,719
there's not how does that make you feel
 

4409
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:46,709
there's not how does that make you feel
by the way like the idea that if we just

4410
01:18:46,709 --> 01:18:46,719
by the way like the idea that if we just
 

4411
01:18:46,719 --> 01:18:47,669
by the way like the idea that if we just
look

4412
01:18:47,669 --> 01:18:47,679
look
 

4413
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:50,229
look
uh outside of even just human psychology

4414
01:18:50,229 --> 01:18:50,239
uh outside of even just human psychology
 

4415
01:18:50,239 --> 01:18:51,830
uh outside of even just human psychology
and fighting and so on if we look at

4416
01:18:51,830 --> 01:18:51,840
and fighting and so on if we look at
 

4417
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:53,270
and fighting and so on if we look at
like physics if everything is

4418
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:53,280
like physics if everything is
 

4419
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:55,189
like physics if everything is
predetermined if all of these little

4420
01:18:55,189 --> 01:18:55,199
predetermined if all of these little
 

4421
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:56,870
predetermined if all of these little
molecules interacting

4422
01:18:56,870 --> 01:18:56,880
molecules interacting
 

4423
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:59,590
molecules interacting
it's already like your story is already

4424
01:18:59,590 --> 01:18:59,600
it's already like your story is already
 

4425
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:02,070
it's already like your story is already
written i mean it depends it's it's

4426
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:02,080
written i mean it depends it's it's
 

4427
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:04,470
written i mean it depends it's it's
written but i would need to know all the

4428
01:19:04,470 --> 01:19:04,480
written but i would need to know all the
 

4429
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:07,030
written but i would need to know all the
data and it's impossible right like it's

4430
01:19:07,030 --> 01:19:07,040
data and it's impossible right like it's
 

4431
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:08,709
data and it's impossible right like it's
it's

4432
01:19:08,709 --> 01:19:08,719
it's
 

4433
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:10,950
it's
i it's kind of weird i gotta say but i

to me
 

4439
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:15,270
to me
i don't see any argument

4447
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,910
seen nobody and everything from that
i've read so far there's nothing that

i've read so far there's nothing that
 

4449
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:28,630
i've read so far there's nothing that
countered that idea that that

4450
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:28,640
countered that idea that that
 

4451
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:30,950
countered that idea that that
because in a mechanical world

4452
01:19:30,950 --> 01:19:30,960
because in a mechanical world
 

4453
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:33,110
because in a mechanical world
if your car broke or

4454
01:19:33,110 --> 01:19:33,120
if your car broke or
 

4455
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:35,030
if your car broke or
you know we don't say oh the car decided

4456
01:19:35,030 --> 01:19:35,040
you know we don't say oh the car decided
 

4457
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:39,270
you know we don't say oh the car decided
to broke or a three a tree is fall

4458
01:19:39,270 --> 01:19:39,280
to broke or a three a tree is fall
 

4459
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:40,790
to broke or a three a tree is fall
there's reason why the tree is falling

4460
01:19:40,790 --> 01:19:40,800
there's reason why the tree is falling
 

4461
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,470
there's reason why the tree is falling
we don't say the trees decide to fall

4462
01:19:42,470 --> 01:19:42,480
we don't say the trees decide to fall
 

4463
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:45,430
we don't say the trees decide to fall
right so because us human being i think

4464
01:19:45,430 --> 01:19:45,440
right so because us human being i think
 

4465
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:48,550
right so because us human being i think
it's our ego we decide and i'm no

4466
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:48,560
it's our ego we decide and i'm no
 

4467
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:50,070
it's our ego we decide and i'm no
different than anybody when i make a

4468
01:19:50,070 --> 01:19:50,080
different than anybody when i make a
 

4469
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:52,950
different than anybody when i make a
decision i decided to do this i choose

4470
01:19:52,950 --> 01:19:52,960
decision i decided to do this i choose
 

4471
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:55,270
decision i decided to do this i choose
to do this

4472
01:19:55,270 --> 01:19:55,280
to do this
 

4473
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:57,430
to do this
but i'm aware that

4474
01:19:57,430 --> 01:19:57,440
but i'm aware that
 

4475
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:00,229
but i'm aware that
there is causes

4476
01:20:00,229 --> 01:20:00,239
there is causes
 

4477
01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:02,950
there is causes
that make me do certain things

4478
01:20:02,950 --> 01:20:02,960
that make me do certain things
 

4479
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:05,030
that make me do certain things
and by definition i think if there is a

4480
01:20:05,030 --> 01:20:05,040
and by definition i think if there is a
 

4481
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:06,950
and by definition i think if there is a
cause

4482
01:20:06,950 --> 01:20:06,960
cause
 

4483
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:08,629
cause
there is no free will by definition

4484
01:20:08,629 --> 01:20:08,639
there is no free will by definition
 

4485
01:20:08,639 --> 01:20:09,430
there is no free will by definition
right

4486
01:20:09,430 --> 01:20:09,440
right
 

4487
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:11,750
right
yes but the thing is just like you said

4488
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:11,760
yes but the thing is just like you said
 

4489
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:14,229
yes but the thing is just like you said
we understand so little about human

4490
01:20:14,229 --> 01:20:14,239
we understand so little about human
 

4491
01:20:14,239 --> 01:20:15,910
we understand so little about human
intelligence the human mind and

4492
01:20:15,910 --> 01:20:15,920
intelligence the human mind and
 

4493
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:17,910
intelligence the human mind and
especially consciousness

4494
01:20:17,910 --> 01:20:17,920
especially consciousness
 

4495
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:19,750
especially consciousness
that

4496
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:19,760
that
 

4497
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:21,270
that
the

4498
01:20:21,270 --> 01:20:21,280
the
 

4499
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:23,350
the
this giant

4500
01:20:23,350 --> 01:20:23,360
this giant
 

4501
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:25,590
this giant
mystery this darkness that we don't

4502
01:20:25,590 --> 01:20:25,600
mystery this darkness that we don't
 

4503
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,830
mystery this darkness that we don't
understand how how it

4504
01:20:27,830 --> 01:20:27,840
understand how how it
 

4505
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:29,830
understand how how it
how it feels like to be something to be

4506
01:20:29,830 --> 01:20:29,840
how it feels like to be something to be
 

4507
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:31,590
how it feels like to be something to be
a conscious being

4508
01:20:31,590 --> 01:20:31,600
a conscious being
 

4509
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:32,790
a conscious being
that

4510
01:20:32,790 --> 01:20:32,800
that
 

4511
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:34,709
that
because of that we're not able to really

4512
01:20:34,709 --> 01:20:34,719
because of that we're not able to really
 

4513
01:20:34,719 --> 01:20:37,990
because of that we're not able to really
even reason about free will or not

4514
01:20:37,990 --> 01:20:38,000
even reason about free will or not
 

4515
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,470
even reason about free will or not
because there might be some magic

4516
01:20:40,470 --> 01:20:40,480
because there might be some magic
 

4517
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:43,430
because there might be some magic
that comes from consciousness the you

4518
01:20:43,430 --> 01:20:43,440
that comes from consciousness the you
 

4519
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:46,149
that comes from consciousness the you
know the the consciousness might be the

4520
01:20:46,149 --> 01:20:46,159
know the the consciousness might be the
 

4521
01:20:46,159 --> 01:20:48,390
know the the consciousness might be the
thing that makes us different from a car

4522
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:48,400
thing that makes us different from a car
 

4523
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:49,669
thing that makes us different from a car
that breaks down

4524
01:20:49,669 --> 01:20:49,679
that breaks down
 

4525
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:51,510
that breaks down
there might be something

4526
01:20:51,510 --> 01:20:51,520
there might be something
 

4527
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:53,350
there might be something
uh totally

4528
01:20:53,350 --> 01:20:53,360
uh totally
 

4529
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:55,990
uh totally
fascinating totally

4530
01:20:55,990 --> 01:20:56,000
fascinating totally
 

4531
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,070
fascinating totally
undiscovered yet that will make us

4532
01:20:58,070 --> 01:20:58,080
undiscovered yet that will make us
 

4533
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,229
undiscovered yet that will make us
realize that free will is actually real

4534
01:21:00,229 --> 01:21:00,239
realize that free will is actually real
 

4535
01:21:00,239 --> 01:21:01,990
realize that free will is actually real
and somehow fundamental to the human

4536
01:21:01,990 --> 01:21:02,000
and somehow fundamental to the human
 

4537
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,830
and somehow fundamental to the human
experience so

4538
01:21:03,830 --> 01:21:03,840
experience so
 

4539
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:06,550
experience so
it's sometimes i think

4540
01:21:06,550 --> 01:21:06,560
it's sometimes i think
 

4541
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:09,430
it's sometimes i think
we forget when we talk about

4542
01:21:09,430 --> 01:21:09,440
we forget when we talk about
 

4543
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:10,790
we forget when we talk about
free will and

4544
01:21:10,790 --> 01:21:10,800
free will and
 

4545
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:13,110
free will and
physics and it all seeming to be

4546
01:21:13,110 --> 01:21:13,120
physics and it all seeming to be
 

4547
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:14,390
physics and it all seeming to be
predetermined

4548
01:21:14,390 --> 01:21:14,400
predetermined
 

4549
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,070
predetermined
we forget how little we actually

4550
01:21:16,070 --> 01:21:16,080
we forget how little we actually
 

4551
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:18,149
we forget how little we actually
understand about the world

4552
01:21:18,149 --> 01:21:18,159
understand about the world
 

4553
01:21:18,159 --> 01:21:19,350
understand about the world
and i think

4554
01:21:19,350 --> 01:21:19,360
and i think
 

4555
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,750
and i think
in that mystery that could be

4556
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:21,760
in that mystery that could be
 

4557
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:23,510
in that mystery that could be
totally new ideas that are yet to be

4558
01:21:23,510 --> 01:21:23,520
totally new ideas that are yet to be
 

4559
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:26,229
totally new ideas that are yet to be
discovered and will make us realize that

4560
01:21:26,229 --> 01:21:26,239
discovered and will make us realize that
 

4561
01:21:26,239 --> 01:21:28,629
discovered and will make us realize that
it's not just an illusion

4562
01:21:28,629 --> 01:21:28,639
it's not just an illusion
 

4563
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:30,790
it's not just an illusion
it is something that is like

4564
01:21:30,790 --> 01:21:30,800
it is something that is like
 

4565
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:33,430
it is something that is like
at the core of how the universe works

4566
01:21:33,430 --> 01:21:33,440
at the core of how the universe works
 

4567
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:35,910
at the core of how the universe works
some people believe that consciousness

4568
01:21:35,910 --> 01:21:35,920
some people believe that consciousness
 

4569
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:37,350
some people believe that consciousness
is a

4570
01:21:37,350 --> 01:21:37,360
is a
 

4571
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:39,510
is a
fundamental property of the universe

4572
01:21:39,510 --> 01:21:39,520
fundamental property of the universe
 

4573
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:41,270
fundamental property of the universe
like it's a it's a one of the forces of

4574
01:21:41,270 --> 01:21:41,280
like it's a it's a one of the forces of
 

4575
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:43,910
like it's a it's a one of the forces of
physics like consciousness permeates

4576
01:21:43,910 --> 01:21:43,920
physics like consciousness permeates
 

4577
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:46,709
physics like consciousness permeates
everything it's in everything like this

4578
01:21:46,709 --> 01:21:46,719
everything it's in everything like this
 

4579
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:49,030
everything it's in everything like this
table is conscious but it's not

4580
01:21:49,030 --> 01:21:49,040
table is conscious but it's not
 

4581
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:51,350
table is conscious but it's not
as conscious as us and we're this little

4582
01:21:51,350 --> 01:21:51,360
as conscious as us and we're this little
 

4583
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:53,910
as conscious as us and we're this little
peak of consciousness and if that's true

4584
01:21:53,910 --> 01:21:53,920
peak of consciousness and if that's true
 

4585
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:56,390
peak of consciousness and if that's true
and if we get to understand that maybe

4586
01:21:56,390 --> 01:21:56,400
and if we get to understand that maybe
 

4587
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:57,830
and if we get to understand that maybe
there's something

4588
01:21:57,830 --> 01:21:57,840
there's something
 

4589
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:00,310
there's something
there's an extra bonus we get in terms

4590
01:22:00,310 --> 01:22:00,320
there's an extra bonus we get in terms
 

4591
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,510
there's an extra bonus we get in terms
of free will

4592
01:22:01,510 --> 01:22:01,520
of free will
 

4593
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:04,070
of free will
once you become one of those entities

4594
01:22:04,070 --> 01:22:04,080
once you become one of those entities
 

4595
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:05,669
once you become one of those entities
that are super conscious

4596
01:22:05,669 --> 01:22:05,679
that are super conscious
 

4597
01:22:05,679 --> 01:22:06,950
that are super conscious
so

4598
01:22:06,950 --> 01:22:06,960
so
 

4599
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:09,110
so
i i tend to be sort of humbled by the

4600
01:22:09,110 --> 01:22:09,120
i i tend to be sort of humbled by the
 

4601
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:10,629
i i tend to be sort of humbled by the
mystery of it

4602
01:22:10,629 --> 01:22:10,639
mystery of it
 

4603
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:12,950
mystery of it
do you believe

4604
01:22:12,950 --> 01:22:12,960
do you believe
 

4605
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:14,229
do you believe
one day with

4606
01:22:14,229 --> 01:22:14,239
one day with
 

4607
01:22:14,239 --> 01:22:17,189
one day with
with the technology that keep improving

4608
01:22:17,189 --> 01:22:17,199
with the technology that keep improving
 

4609
01:22:17,199 --> 01:22:18,229
with the technology that keep improving
we will

4610
01:22:18,229 --> 01:22:18,239
we will
 

4611
01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:19,350
we will
make

4612
01:22:19,350 --> 01:22:19,360
make
 

4613
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:20,070
make

creating ai systems that are conscious

4648
01:23:00,149 --> 01:23:00,159
creating ai systems that are conscious

creating ai systems that are conscious
that are human-like

that are human-like
 

4651
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:03,669
that are human-like
can enable us to

kindness to the world through the
 

4659
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,310
kindness to the world through the
systems we interact with will inspire us

4660
01:23:14,310 --> 01:23:14,320
systems we interact with will inspire us
 

4661
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:16,390

to be better and better to each other
 

4663
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:19,189
to be better and better to each other
in terms of them being conscious i think

4664
01:23:19,189 --> 01:23:19,199
in terms of them being conscious i think
 

4665
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:22,550
in terms of them being conscious i think
that is a an absolute requirement

4666
01:23:22,550 --> 01:23:22,560
that is a an absolute requirement
 

4667
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:25,350
that is a an absolute requirement
that entities we interact with

4668
01:23:25,350 --> 01:23:25,360
that entities we interact with
 

4669
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:27,669
that entities we interact with
communicate some element

4670
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:27,679
communicate some element
 

4671
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:30,149
communicate some element
of consciousness to us like that's how

4672
01:23:30,149 --> 01:23:30,159
of consciousness to us like that's how
 

4673
01:23:30,159 --> 01:23:32,070
of consciousness to us like that's how
we connect to each other the reason we

4674
01:23:32,070 --> 01:23:32,080
we connect to each other the reason we
 

4675
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:34,790
we connect to each other the reason we
you and i connect is that we believe

4676
01:23:34,790 --> 01:23:34,800
you and i connect is that we believe
 

4677
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:37,510
you and i connect is that we believe
that each of us are conscious

4678
01:23:37,510 --> 01:23:37,520
that each of us are conscious
 

4679
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:39,590
that each of us are conscious
and to me what consciousness means is

4680
01:23:39,590 --> 01:23:39,600
and to me what consciousness means is
 

4681
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:42,229
and to me what consciousness means is
the ability to hurt ability to

4682
01:23:42,229 --> 01:23:42,239
the ability to hurt ability to
 

4683
01:23:42,239 --> 01:23:43,510
the ability to hurt ability to
to suffer

4684
01:23:43,510 --> 01:23:43,520
to suffer
 

4685
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:46,229
to suffer
to uh to struggle in this world

4686
01:23:46,229 --> 01:23:46,239
to uh to struggle in this world
 

4687
01:23:46,239 --> 01:23:49,430
to uh to struggle in this world
because just like you said uh

4688
01:23:49,430 --> 01:23:49,440
because just like you said uh
 

4689
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:51,669
because just like you said uh
with with without the struggle you don't

4690
01:23:51,669 --> 01:23:51,679
with with without the struggle you don't
 

4691
01:23:51,679 --> 01:23:53,110
with with without the struggle you don't
have the love you don't have the

4692
01:23:53,110 --> 01:23:53,120
have the love you don't have the
 

4693
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:54,070
have the love you don't have the
pleasure

4694
01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:54,080
pleasure
 

4695
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:54,870
pleasure
and

4696
01:23:54,870 --> 01:23:54,880
and
 

4697
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:57,270
and
ultimately consciousness is an entity's

4698
01:23:57,270 --> 01:23:57,280
ultimately consciousness is an entity's
 

4699
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:58,390
ultimately consciousness is an entity's
ability

4700
01:23:58,390 --> 01:23:58,400
ability
 

4701
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:00,870
ability
to struggle to suffer

4702
01:24:00,870 --> 01:24:00,880
to struggle to suffer
 

4703
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:01,669
to struggle to suffer
and

4704
01:24:01,669 --> 01:24:01,679
and
 

4705
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:04,790
and
from that arises the pleasure and us

4706
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:04,800
from that arises the pleasure and us
 

4707
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:08,229
from that arises the pleasure and us
together being able to

4708
01:24:08,229 --> 01:24:08,239
together being able to
 

4709
01:24:08,239 --> 01:24:11,990
together being able to
appreciate sort of uh

4710
01:24:11,990 --> 01:24:12,000

 

4711
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,990

appreciate the highs

4712
01:24:13,990 --> 01:24:14,000
appreciate the highs
 

4713
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,030
appreciate the highs
and

4714
01:24:15,030 --> 01:24:15,040
and
 

4715
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:17,270
and
experience together at the lows that's

4716
01:24:17,270 --> 01:24:17,280
experience together at the lows that's
 

4717
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:19,350
experience together at the lows that's
how we form the deep connections

4718
01:24:19,350 --> 01:24:19,360
how we form the deep connections
 

4719
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:20,950
how we form the deep connections
i personally think we can create that in

4720
01:24:20,950 --> 01:24:20,960
i personally think we can create that in
 

4721
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:23,350
i personally think we can create that in
robots and i i personally believe it's a

4722
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:23,360
robots and i i personally believe it's a
 

4723
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:26,550
robots and i i personally believe it's a
lot easier than uh than we think does it

4724
01:24:26,550 --> 01:24:26,560
lot easier than uh than we think does it

one day hey hi like intelligence
 

4733
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:36,950
one day hey hi like intelligence
artificial intelligence could be

4734
01:24:36,950 --> 01:24:36,960
artificial intelligence could be
 

4735
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:39,030

01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:20,000
worried about humans
 

4779
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:23,110
worried about humans
if i look at what you men have done on

4780
01:25:23,110 --> 01:25:23,120
if i look at what you men have done on
 

4781
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:24,790
if i look at what you men have done on
on the course of history

4782
01:25:24,790 --> 01:25:24,800
on the course of history
 

4783
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:28,070
on the course of history
you know for for example

4784
01:25:28,070 --> 01:25:28,080
you know for for example
 

4785
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:30,470
you know for for example
in regards to the planet to the the

4786
01:25:30,470 --> 01:25:30,480
in regards to the planet to the the
 

4787
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:32,310
in regards to the planet to the the
scale of the universe

4788
01:25:32,310 --> 01:25:32,320
scale of the universe
 

4789
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:33,430
scale of the universe
i think

4790
01:25:33,430 --> 01:25:33,440
i think
 

4791
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:35,910
i think
what i'm afraid is that we have more

4792
01:25:35,910 --> 01:25:35,920
what i'm afraid is that we have more
 

4793
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:37,350
what i'm afraid is that we have more
of a

4794
01:25:37,350 --> 01:25:37,360
of a
 

4795
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:40,470
of a
destructive force than a beneficial

4796
01:25:40,470 --> 01:25:40,480
destructive force than a beneficial
 

4797
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,950
destructive force than a beneficial
force so if a height take that and cause

4798
01:25:42,950 --> 01:25:42,960
force so if a height take that and cause
 

4799
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:45,669
force so if a height take that and cause
the duration in order to

4800
01:25:45,669 --> 01:25:45,679
the duration in order to
 

4801
01:25:45,679 --> 01:25:48,470
the duration in order to
protect us against ourselves

4802
01:25:48,470 --> 01:25:48,480
protect us against ourselves
 

4803
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:49,510
protect us against ourselves
it could

4804
01:25:49,510 --> 01:25:49,520
it could
 

4805
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:51,270
it could
hurt us in a way i don't know if you if

4806
01:25:51,270 --> 01:25:51,280
hurt us in a way i don't know if you if
 

4807
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:52,790
hurt us in a way i don't know if you if
you understand what like

4808
01:25:52,790 --> 01:25:52,800
you understand what like
 

4809
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:54,790
you understand what like
what do you think about that does it

4810
01:25:54,790 --> 01:25:54,800
what do you think about that does it
 

4811
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:57,430
what do you think about that does it
makes you afraid sometimes not because

4812
01:25:57,430 --> 01:25:57,440
makes you afraid sometimes not because
 

4813
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:59,669
makes you afraid sometimes not because
of a hype but because of what humans are

4814
01:25:59,669 --> 01:25:59,679
of a hype but because of what humans are
 

4815
01:25:59,679 --> 01:26:00,709
of a hype but because of what humans are
doing

4816
01:26:00,709 --> 01:26:00,719
doing
 

4817
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:03,990
doing
that heihei could do to us to prevent us

4818
01:26:03,990 --> 01:26:04,000
that heihei could do to us to prevent us
 

4819
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,510
that heihei could do to us to prevent us
of hurting

4820
01:26:05,510 --> 01:26:05,520
of hurting
 

4821
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:07,990
of hurting
ourselves you know yeah no i mean

4822
01:26:07,990 --> 01:26:08,000
ourselves you know yeah no i mean
 

4823
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,590
ourselves you know yeah no i mean
definitely it can bring out the the

4824
01:26:09,590 --> 01:26:09,600
definitely it can bring out the the
 

4825
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:13,669
definitely it can bring out the the
worst in human nature and uh

4826
01:26:13,669 --> 01:26:13,679
worst in human nature and uh
 

4827
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:16,790
worst in human nature and uh
provide tools for evil people to do evil

4828
01:26:16,790 --> 01:26:16,800
provide tools for evil people to do evil
 

4829
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:19,669
provide tools for evil people to do evil
things at a larger scale but i just

4830
01:26:19,669 --> 01:26:19,679
things at a larger scale but i just
 

4831
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:21,270
things at a larger scale but i just
think

4832
01:26:21,270 --> 01:26:21,280
think
 

4833
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:23,830
think
it depends what you think human beings

4834
01:26:23,830 --> 01:26:23,840
it depends what you think human beings
 

4835
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:25,910
it depends what you think human beings
are i tend to believe

4836
01:26:25,910 --> 01:26:25,920
are i tend to believe
 

4837
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:28,470
are i tend to believe
that as we get more intelligent

4838
01:26:28,470 --> 01:26:28,480
that as we get more intelligent
 

4839
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:30,149
that as we get more intelligent
we

4840
01:26:30,149 --> 01:26:30,159
we
 

4841
01:26:30,159 --> 01:26:33,110
we
we start to see the value

4842
01:26:33,110 --> 01:26:33,120
we start to see the value
 

4843
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:35,590
we start to see the value
the evolutionary value and the value in

4844
01:26:35,590 --> 01:26:35,600
the evolutionary value and the value in
 

4845
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,350
the evolutionary value and the value in
terms of happiness of being good to each

4846
01:26:37,350 --> 01:26:37,360
terms of happiness of being good to each
 

4847
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:39,910
terms of happiness of being good to each
other and i think ai if if you look at

4848
01:26:39,910 --> 01:26:39,920
other and i think ai if if you look at
 

4849
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:42,070
other and i think ai if if you look at
ai as an optimization problem of how to

4850
01:26:42,070 --> 01:26:42,080
ai as an optimization problem of how to
 

4851
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:43,990
ai as an optimization problem of how to
create a civilization that works well

4852
01:26:43,990 --> 01:26:44,000
create a civilization that works well
 

4853
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,990
create a civilization that works well
and expands throughout the universe

4854
01:26:45,990 --> 01:26:46,000
and expands throughout the universe
 

4855
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,590
and expands throughout the universe
i think love

4856
01:26:47,590 --> 01:26:47,600
i think love
 

4857
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:50,550
i think love
is much uh more effective so ai will

4858
01:26:50,550 --> 01:26:50,560
is much uh more effective so ai will
 

4859
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:51,590
is much uh more effective so ai will
help us

4860
01:26:51,590 --> 01:26:51,600
help us
 

4861
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:53,270
help us
maximize that

4862
01:26:53,270 --> 01:26:53,280
maximize that
 

4863
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:55,350
maximize that
i think there's going to be always

4864
01:26:55,350 --> 01:26:55,360
i think there's going to be always
 

4865
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:57,189
i think there's going to be always
spikes throughout as it has been through

4866
01:26:57,189 --> 01:26:57,199
spikes throughout as it has been through
 

4867
01:26:57,199 --> 01:27:00,070
spikes throughout as it has been through
human history where charismatic leaders

4868
01:27:00,070 --> 01:27:00,080
human history where charismatic leaders
 

4869
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:02,950
human history where charismatic leaders
will do evil onto the world in the name

4870
01:27:02,950 --> 01:27:02,960
will do evil onto the world in the name
 

4871
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:04,870
will do evil onto the world in the name
of good you have the stalin and the

4872
01:27:04,870 --> 01:27:04,880
of good you have the stalin and the
 

4873
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:07,270
of good you have the stalin and the
hitlers and all of that

4874
01:27:07,270 --> 01:27:07,280
hitlers and all of that
 

4875
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:08,149
hitlers and all of that
but

4876
01:27:08,149 --> 01:27:08,159
but
 

4877
01:27:08,159 --> 01:27:10,390
but
ultimately

4878
01:27:10,390 --> 01:27:10,400
ultimately
 

4879
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:13,910
ultimately
over time i think technology will give

4880
01:27:13,910 --> 01:27:13,920
over time i think technology will give
 

4881
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,350
over time i think technology will give
the good

4882
01:27:15,350 --> 01:27:15,360
the good
 

4883
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:18,950
the good
uh the good people power and the evil

4884
01:27:18,950 --> 01:27:18,960
uh the good people power and the evil
 

4885
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:20,709
uh the good people power and the evil
people

4886
01:27:20,709 --> 01:27:20,719
people
 

4887
01:27:20,719 --> 01:27:21,830
people
less power

4888
01:27:21,830 --> 01:27:21,840
less power
 

4889
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:25,430
less power
now there's a lot of ways in that in uh

4890
01:27:25,430 --> 01:27:25,440
now there's a lot of ways in that in uh
 

4891
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,030
now there's a lot of ways in that in uh
that that won't be the case there's a

4892
01:27:27,030 --> 01:27:27,040
that that won't be the case there's a
 

4893
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:28,870
that that won't be the case there's a
lot of ways for it to go wrong and elon

4894
01:27:28,870 --> 01:27:28,880
lot of ways for it to go wrong and elon
 

4895
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:31,030
lot of ways for it to go wrong and elon
talks about them but

4896
01:27:31,030 --> 01:27:31,040
talks about them but
 

4897
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:33,830
talks about them but
i i honestly think in terms of

4898
01:27:33,830 --> 01:27:33,840
i i honestly think in terms of
 

4899
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:36,070
i i honestly think in terms of
intelligent ai that's going to bring

4900
01:27:36,070 --> 01:27:36,080
intelligent ai that's going to bring
 

4901
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:37,990
intelligent ai that's going to bring
more love to the world the thing i'm

4902
01:27:37,990 --> 01:27:38,000
more love to the world the thing i'm
 

4903
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,709
more love to the world the thing i'm
concerned about is dumb ai

4904
01:27:40,709 --> 01:27:40,719
concerned about is dumb ai
 

4905
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:43,110
concerned about is dumb ai
so there's been a lot of discussion

4906
01:27:43,110 --> 01:27:43,120
so there's been a lot of discussion
 

4907
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:44,550
so there's been a lot of discussion
between china and the united states

4908
01:27:44,550 --> 01:27:44,560
between china and the united states
 

4909
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:47,189
between china and the united states
recently on autonomous weapons system

4910
01:27:47,189 --> 01:27:47,199
recently on autonomous weapons system
 

4911
01:27:47,199 --> 01:27:49,030
recently on autonomous weapons system
this is something people don't

4912
01:27:49,030 --> 01:27:49,040
this is something people don't
 

4913
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:51,669
this is something people don't
they're afraid to talk about but

4914
01:27:51,669 --> 01:27:51,679
they're afraid to talk about but
 

4915
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:54,550
they're afraid to talk about but
there's now a race

4916
01:27:54,550 --> 01:27:54,560
there's now a race
 

4917
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:56,229
there's now a race
uh where

4918
01:27:56,229 --> 01:27:56,239
uh where
 

4919
01:27:56,239 --> 01:27:58,390
uh where
the united states has officially said

4920
01:27:58,390 --> 01:27:58,400
the united states has officially said
 

4921
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:01,669
the united states has officially said
that they're not against adding ai to

4922
01:28:01,669 --> 01:28:01,679
that they're not against adding ai to
 

4923
01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:04,470
that they're not against adding ai to
its weapon systems so now

4924
01:28:04,470 --> 01:28:04,480
its weapon systems so now
 

4925
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:06,229
its weapon systems so now
the us military

4926
01:28:06,229 --> 01:28:06,239
the us military
 

4927
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:08,310
the us military
is adding automation

4928
01:28:08,310 --> 01:28:08,320
is adding automation
 

4929
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:09,990
is adding automation
adding intelligence

4930
01:28:09,990 --> 01:28:10,000
adding intelligence
 

4931
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,990
adding intelligence
to its drones

4932
01:28:11,990 --> 01:28:12,000
to its drones
 

4933
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,590
to its drones
to its uh

4934
01:28:13,590 --> 01:28:13,600
to its uh
 

4935
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:15,830
to its uh
anything that can create damage

4936
01:28:15,830 --> 01:28:15,840
anything that can create damage
 

4937
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:18,709
anything that can create damage
and so of course and they did this so in

4938
01:28:18,709 --> 01:28:18,719
and so of course and they did this so in
 

4939
01:28:18,719 --> 01:28:21,030
and so of course and they did this so in
response to china doing that

4940
01:28:21,030 --> 01:28:21,040
response to china doing that
 

4941
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:23,110
response to china doing that
so you can imagine this is this is

4942
01:28:23,110 --> 01:28:23,120
so you can imagine this is this is
 

4943
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:24,390
so you can imagine this is this is
terminator

4944
01:28:24,390 --> 01:28:24,400
terminator
 

4945
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:26,470
terminator
you think about terminators intel

4946
01:28:26,470 --> 01:28:26,480
you think about terminators intel
 

4947
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:28,229
you think about terminators intel
intelligent systems they're not they're

4948
01:28:28,229 --> 01:28:28,239
intelligent systems they're not they're
 

4949
01:28:28,239 --> 01:28:29,590
intelligent systems they're not they're
pretty dumb

4950
01:28:29,590 --> 01:28:29,600
pretty dumb
 

4951
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:31,430
pretty dumb
the the point is

4952
01:28:31,430 --> 01:28:31,440
the the point is
 

4953
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:34,070
the the point is
they're efficient at doing what they do

4954
01:28:34,070 --> 01:28:34,080
they're efficient at doing what they do
 

4955
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:36,310
they're efficient at doing what they do
and in the space of war

4956
01:28:36,310 --> 01:28:36,320
and in the space of war
 

4957
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:38,310
and in the space of war
efficient at doing what you do means

4958
01:28:38,310 --> 01:28:38,320
efficient at doing what you do means
 

4959
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:39,510
efficient at doing what you do means
killing

4960
01:28:39,510 --> 01:28:39,520
killing
 

4961
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:40,229
killing
so

4962
01:28:40,229 --> 01:28:40,239
so
 

4963
01:28:40,239 --> 01:28:42,070
so
that i'm really afraid of but those are

4964
01:28:42,070 --> 01:28:42,080
that i'm really afraid of but those are
 

4965
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:44,310
that i'm really afraid of but those are
dumb ai those aren't your

4966
01:28:44,310 --> 01:28:44,320
dumb ai those aren't your
 

4967
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:45,350
dumb ai those aren't your
uh

4968
01:28:45,350 --> 01:28:45,360
uh
 

4969
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:46,390

deep
 

4973
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:50,470
deep
fulfilling relationships that's like

4974
01:28:50,470 --> 01:28:50,480
fulfilling relationships that's like
 

4975
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:53,669
fulfilling relationships that's like
uh efficiently being able to fly to plan

4976
01:28:53,669 --> 01:28:53,679
uh efficiently being able to fly to plan
 

4977
01:28:53,679 --> 01:28:55,910
uh efficiently being able to fly to plan
the trajectory of dropping bombs of

4978
01:28:55,910 --> 01:28:55,920
the trajectory of dropping bombs of
 

4979
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:59,110
the trajectory of dropping bombs of
missiles of how to do counter attacks of

4980
01:28:59,110 --> 01:28:59,120
missiles of how to do counter attacks of
 

4981
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:01,110
missiles of how to do counter attacks of
how to maximize the destruction of a

4982
01:29:01,110 --> 01:29:01,120
how to maximize the destruction of a
 

4983
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:02,629
how to maximize the destruction of a
particular facility instead of

4984
01:29:02,629 --> 01:29:02,639
particular facility instead of
 

4985
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:03,830
particular facility instead of
individuals

4986
01:29:03,830 --> 01:29:03,840
individuals
 

4987
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:04,870
individuals
and then

4988
01:29:04,870 --> 01:29:04,880
and then
 

4989
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:07,110
and then
that can just escalate

4990
01:29:07,110 --> 01:29:07,120
that can just escalate
 

4991
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:09,350
that can just escalate
and as opposed to the cold war with the

4992
01:29:09,350 --> 01:29:09,360
and as opposed to the cold war with the
 

4993
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:11,110
and as opposed to the cold war with the
with the soviet union this could be a

4994
01:29:11,110 --> 01:29:11,120
with the soviet union this could be a
 

4995
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:12,310
with the soviet union this could be a
hot war

4996
01:29:12,310 --> 01:29:12,320
hot war
 

4997
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:14,310
hot war
and then

4998
01:29:14,310 --> 01:29:14,320
and then
 

4999
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:16,149
and then
the consequences

5000
01:29:16,149 --> 01:29:16,159
the consequences
 

5001
01:29:16,159 --> 01:29:17,510
the consequences
once you allow

5002
01:29:17,510 --> 01:29:17,520
once you allow
 

5003
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:19,430
once you allow
it's kind of terrifying because

5004
01:29:19,430 --> 01:29:19,440
it's kind of terrifying because
 

5005
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:21,270
it's kind of terrifying because
currently the drones are operated by

5006
01:29:21,270 --> 01:29:21,280
currently the drones are operated by
 

5007
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:23,510
currently the drones are operated by
humans so

5008
01:29:23,510 --> 01:29:23,520
humans so
 

5009
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:25,510
humans so
you know you have say you have

5010
01:29:25,510 --> 01:29:25,520
you know you have say you have
 

5011
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:27,030
you know you have say you have
information

5012
01:29:27,030 --> 01:29:27,040
information
 

5013
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:29,270
information
about uh intelligence gives you

5014
01:29:29,270 --> 01:29:29,280
about uh intelligence gives you
 

5015
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:31,110
about uh intelligence gives you
information about a particular terrorist

5016
01:29:31,110 --> 01:29:31,120
information about a particular terrorist
 

5017
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:32,950
information about a particular terrorist
located at this area

5018
01:29:32,950 --> 01:29:32,960
located at this area
 

5019
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:33,910
located at this area
and then

5020
01:29:33,910 --> 01:29:33,920
and then
 

5021
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:35,990
and then
you use drones to

5022
01:29:35,990 --> 01:29:36,000
you use drones to
 

5023
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,430
you use drones to
maybe uh

5024
01:29:37,430 --> 01:29:37,440
maybe uh
 

5025
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:39,189
maybe uh
the automation there is to help you

5026
01:29:39,189 --> 01:29:39,199
the automation there is to help you
 

5027
01:29:39,199 --> 01:29:41,430
the automation there is to help you
figure out what is the best trajectory

5028
01:29:41,430 --> 01:29:41,440
figure out what is the best trajectory
 

5029
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:42,390
figure out what is the best trajectory
to

5030
01:29:42,390 --> 01:29:42,400
to
 

5031
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:45,430
to
strike at that location so

5032
01:29:45,430 --> 01:29:45,440
strike at that location so
 

5033
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:46,870
strike at that location so
you still have a human that pulls the

5034
01:29:46,870 --> 01:29:46,880
you still have a human that pulls the
 

5035
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:48,470
you still have a human that pulls the
trigger at the end

5036
01:29:48,470 --> 01:29:48,480
trigger at the end
 

5037
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:51,990
trigger at the end
dropping the bomb now automation and ai

5038
01:29:51,990 --> 01:29:52,000
dropping the bomb now automation and ai
 

5039
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,229
dropping the bomb now automation and ai
in autonomous weapons systems

5040
01:29:54,229 --> 01:29:54,239
in autonomous weapons systems
 

5041
01:29:54,239 --> 01:29:56,310
in autonomous weapons systems
might be where you say

5042
01:29:56,310 --> 01:29:56,320
might be where you say
 

5043
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:58,629
might be where you say
there's a bad guy over here

5044
01:29:58,629 --> 01:29:58,639
there's a bad guy over here
 

5045
01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:01,030
there's a bad guy over here
you figure out how to get rid of the bad

5046
01:30:01,030 --> 01:30:01,040
you figure out how to get rid of the bad
 

5047
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:03,910
you figure out how to get rid of the bad
guy okay so then of course the systems

5048
01:30:03,910 --> 01:30:03,920
guy okay so then of course the systems
 

5049
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:05,669
guy okay so then of course the systems
will be very good at finding the right

5050
01:30:05,669 --> 01:30:05,679
will be very good at finding the right
 

5051
01:30:05,679 --> 01:30:07,590
will be very good at finding the right
trajectory and so on

5052
01:30:07,590 --> 01:30:07,600
trajectory and so on
 

5053
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:08,950
trajectory and so on
but

5054
01:30:08,950 --> 01:30:08,960
but
 

5055
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:11,750
but
there's bugs that can happen unexpected

5056
01:30:11,750 --> 01:30:11,760
there's bugs that can happen unexpected
 

5057
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:13,910
there's bugs that can happen unexpected
bugs that the system might figure out

5058
01:30:13,910 --> 01:30:13,920
bugs that the system might figure out
 

5059
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:15,430
bugs that the system might figure out
that there is

5060
01:30:15,430 --> 01:30:15,440
that there is
 

5061
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:17,350
that there is
this bad guy might actually be in these

5062
01:30:17,350 --> 01:30:17,360
this bad guy might actually be in these
 

5063
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:18,470
this bad guy might actually be in these
other

5064
01:30:18,470 --> 01:30:18,480
other
 

5065
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:21,350
other
five locations so mike's might make

5066
01:30:21,350 --> 01:30:21,360
five locations so mike's might make
 

5067
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:24,550
five locations so mike's might make
sense to cover the entire area right

5068
01:30:24,550 --> 01:30:24,560
sense to cover the entire area right
 

5069
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:27,189
sense to cover the entire area right
and you see you might just drop bombs on

5070
01:30:27,189 --> 01:30:27,199
and you see you might just drop bombs on
 

5071
01:30:27,199 --> 01:30:29,430
and you see you might just drop bombs on
the entire area and then

5072
01:30:29,430 --> 01:30:29,440
the entire area and then
 

5073
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:31,430
the entire area and then
you know that's just okay so that's

5074
01:30:31,430 --> 01:30:31,440
you know that's just okay so that's
 

5075
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:32,870
you know that's just okay so that's
going to lead to a lot of destruction of

5076
01:30:32,870 --> 01:30:32,880
going to lead to a lot of destruction of
 

5077
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:34,790
going to lead to a lot of destruction of
the scale of a city but then you can

5078
01:30:34,790 --> 01:30:34,800
the scale of a city but then you can
 

5079
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:37,430
the scale of a city but then you can
immediately take that to nuclear weapons

5080
01:30:37,430 --> 01:30:37,440
immediately take that to nuclear weapons
 

5081
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:40,390
immediately take that to nuclear weapons
if you add automation to uh responding

5082
01:30:40,390 --> 01:30:40,400
if you add automation to uh responding
 

5083
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:42,950
if you add automation to uh responding
to counterattacks to nuclear weapons

5084
01:30:42,950 --> 01:30:42,960
to counterattacks to nuclear weapons
 

5085
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:44,709
to counterattacks to nuclear weapons
somebody you might get information that

5086
01:30:44,709 --> 01:30:44,719
somebody you might get information that
 

5087
01:30:44,719 --> 01:30:46,229
somebody you might get information that
somebody's planning a nuclear attack on

5088
01:30:46,229 --> 01:30:46,239
somebody's planning a nuclear attack on
 

5089
01:30:46,239 --> 01:30:48,550
somebody's planning a nuclear attack on
the united states and the ai system will

5090
01:30:48,550 --> 01:30:48,560
the united states and the ai system will
 

5091
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:50,310
the united states and the ai system will
immediately respond

5092
01:30:50,310 --> 01:30:50,320
immediately respond
 

5093
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:52,550
immediately respond
and you know it can respond at a scale

5094
01:30:52,550 --> 01:30:52,560
and you know it can respond at a scale
 

5095
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:54,709
and you know it can respond at a scale
of launching nuclear weapons itself and

5096
01:30:54,709 --> 01:30:54,719
of launching nuclear weapons itself and
 

5097
01:30:54,719 --> 01:30:57,030
of launching nuclear weapons itself and
so there's all of these possibilities

5098
01:30:57,030 --> 01:30:57,040
so there's all of these possibilities
 

5099
01:30:57,040 --> 01:31:01,270
so there's all of these possibilities
that don't require much intelligence and

5100
01:31:01,270 --> 01:31:01,280
that don't require much intelligence and
 

5101
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:02,470
that don't require much intelligence and
that's exceptionally that's

5102
01:31:02,470 --> 01:31:02,480
that's exceptionally that's
 

5103
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:04,870
that's exceptionally that's
exceptionally concerning i i'm like you

5104
01:31:04,870 --> 01:31:04,880
exceptionally concerning i i'm like you
 

5105
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:07,350
exceptionally concerning i i'm like you
i do not believe there is

5106
01:31:07,350 --> 01:31:07,360
i do not believe there is
 

5107
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:11,030

that with governments and nations
i think

5154
01:31:58,470 --> 01:31:58,480
i think
 

5155

for the distribution of power
 

5161
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:08,310
for the distribution of power
like you see that people are very much

5162

power of institutions and so on so i
 

5167
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:15,189
power of institutions and so on so i
think successful organizations

5168
01:32:15,189 --> 01:32:15,199

successful governments
will be run by people who distribute the

5174

will be run by people who distribute the
 

5175
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:21,990

all yeah and i think you have to
 

5181
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,470
all yeah and i think you have to
build into the system

5182
01:32:28,470 --> 01:32:28,480
build into the system
 

5183
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:31,350
build into the system
that no one person can have power

5184
01:32:31,350 --> 01:32:31,360
that no one person can have power
 

5185
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:33,110
that no one person can have power
and that you distribute it that's where

5186
01:32:33,110 --> 01:32:33,120
and that you distribute it that's where
 

5187
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:35,030
and that you distribute it that's where
you have in the financial sector you

to have the control how do you put the
 

5199
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:47,030
to have the control how do you put the
power in the hands of people uh

5200

colonizing mars colonizing other planets

5238
01:33:32,629 --> 01:33:32,639
colonizing mars colonizing other planets
 

5239
01:33:32,639 --> 01:33:34,470
colonizing mars colonizing other planets
expanding onto the galaxy into the

5240
01:33:34,470 --> 01:33:34,480
expanding onto the galaxy into the
 

5241
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:37,590
expanding onto the galaxy into the
universe that's really exciting

5242
01:33:37,590 --> 01:33:37,600
universe that's really exciting
 

5243
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:38,870
universe that's really exciting
uh so

5244
01:33:38,870 --> 01:33:38,880
uh so
 

5245
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:40,550
uh so
i'm um

5246
01:33:40,550 --> 01:33:40,560
i'm um
 

5247
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:42,629
i'm um
the the the possibilities there are

5248
01:33:42,629 --> 01:33:42,639
the the the possibilities there are
 

5249
01:33:42,639 --> 01:33:44,629
the the the possibilities there are
endless i don't think

5250
01:33:44,629 --> 01:33:44,639
endless i don't think
 

5251
01:33:44,639 --> 01:33:46,229
endless i don't think
because the also the resources are

5252
01:33:46,229 --> 01:33:46,239
because the also the resources are
 

5253
01:33:46,239 --> 01:33:47,350
because the also the resources are
endless

5254
01:33:47,350 --> 01:33:47,360
endless
 

5255
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:49,990
endless
and so i think we get into trouble with

5256
01:33:49,990 --> 01:33:50,000
and so i think we get into trouble with
 

5257
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,390
and so i think we get into trouble with
militarization with wars when the

5258
01:33:52,390 --> 01:33:52,400
militarization with wars when the
 

5259
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:54,870
militarization with wars when the
resources are very constrained

5260
01:33:54,870 --> 01:33:54,880
resources are very constrained
 

5261
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:57,990
resources are very constrained
so i think for a while we're not going

5262
01:33:57,990 --> 01:33:58,000
so i think for a while we're not going
 

5263
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,430
so i think for a while we're not going
to be fighting

5264
01:33:59,430 --> 01:33:59,440
to be fighting
 

5265
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:01,590
to be fighting
the the only wars we'll be fighting in

5266
01:34:01,590 --> 01:34:01,600
the the only wars we'll be fighting in
 

5267
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:05,110
the the only wars we'll be fighting in
space are the ones that kind of um

5268
01:34:05,110 --> 01:34:05,120
space are the ones that kind of um
 

5269
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:07,590
space are the ones that kind of um
another nation to compete yeah who goes

5270
01:34:07,590 --> 01:34:07,600
another nation to compete yeah who goes
 

5271
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:09,430
another nation to compete yeah who goes
to the moon first i guess that's those

5272
01:34:09,430 --> 01:34:09,440
to the moon first i guess that's those
 

5273
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:10,950
to the moon first i guess that's those
those are kind of those kinds of things

5274
01:34:10,950 --> 01:34:10,960
those are kind of those kinds of things
 

5275
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:12,950
those are kind of those kinds of things
or maybe for satellites and all those

5276
01:34:12,950 --> 01:34:12,960
or maybe for satellites and all those
 

5277
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:15,669
or maybe for satellites and all those
kinds of communication and uh maybe in

5278
01:34:15,669 --> 01:34:15,679
kinds of communication and uh maybe in
 

5279
01:34:15,679 --> 01:34:17,910
kinds of communication and uh maybe in
assistance for like cyber warfare which

5280
01:34:17,910 --> 01:34:17,920
assistance for like cyber warfare which
 

5281
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:20,390
assistance for like cyber warfare which
is also very dangerous but in terms of

5282
01:34:20,390 --> 01:34:20,400
is also very dangerous but in terms of
 

5283
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:21,510
is also very dangerous but in terms of
space

5284
01:34:21,510 --> 01:34:21,520
space
 

5285
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:24,390
space
wars out in space i think

5286
01:34:24,390 --> 01:34:24,400
wars out in space i think
 

5287
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:27,590
wars out in space i think
i think everything out in space will be

5288
01:34:27,590 --> 01:34:27,600
i think everything out in space will be
 

5289
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:30,470
i think everything out in space will be
positive and inspiring it's very hard

5290
01:34:30,470 --> 01:34:30,480
positive and inspiring it's very hard
 

5291
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:31,189
positive and inspiring it's very hard
but

5292
01:34:31,189 --> 01:34:31,199
but
 

5293
01:34:31,199 --> 01:34:33,350
but
all good things are hard i think

5294
01:34:33,350 --> 01:34:33,360
all good things are hard i think
 

5295
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:34,470
all good things are hard i think
this is where i've been i've been

5296
01:34:34,470 --> 01:34:34,480
this is where i've been i've been
 

5297
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:37,110
this is where i've been i've been
talking to a bunch of people about um

5298
01:34:37,110 --> 01:34:37,120
talking to a bunch of people about um
 

5299
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:38,790
talking to a bunch of people about um
extraterrestrial life

5300
01:34:38,790 --> 01:34:38,800
extraterrestrial life
 

5301
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:42,790
extraterrestrial life
i'm really excited by

5302
01:34:42,790 --> 01:34:42,800

 

5303
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:45,030

i don't know it's the other thing um

5304
01:34:45,030 --> 01:34:45,040
i don't know it's the other thing um
 

5305
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:47,030
i don't know it's the other thing um
when i look out to the stars it's

5306
01:34:47,030 --> 01:34:47,040
when i look out to the stars it's
 

5307
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:48,790
when i look out to the stars it's
exciting to me i know i think you've

5308
01:34:48,790 --> 01:34:48,800
exciting to me i know i think you've
 

5309
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:51,350
exciting to me i know i think you've
spoken about it being scary

5310
01:34:51,350 --> 01:34:51,360
spoken about it being scary
 

5311
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:53,189
spoken about it being scary
but to me it's exciting that there's

5312
01:34:53,189 --> 01:34:53,199
but to me it's exciting that there's
 

5313
01:34:53,199 --> 01:34:55,350
but to me it's exciting that there's
intelligent creatures out there

5314
01:34:55,350 --> 01:34:55,360
intelligent creatures out there
 

5315
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:57,189
intelligent creatures out there
far beyond perhaps the intelligence of

5316
01:34:57,189 --> 01:34:57,199
far beyond perhaps the intelligence of
 

5317
01:34:57,199 --> 01:34:58,550
far beyond perhaps the intelligence of
our own

5318
01:34:58,550 --> 01:34:58,560
our own
 

5319
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:01,030
our own
that uh are just too far away to explore

5320
01:35:01,030 --> 01:35:01,040
that uh are just too far away to explore
 

5321
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:03,590
that uh are just too far away to explore
yet but we might one day come in contact

5322
01:35:03,590 --> 01:35:03,600
yet but we might one day come in contact
 

5323
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:04,629
yet but we might one day come in contact
with them

5324
01:35:04,629 --> 01:35:04,639
with them
 

5325
01:35:04,639 --> 01:35:06,950
with them
so uh that that to me is the ultimate

5326
01:35:06,950 --> 01:35:06,960
so uh that that to me is the ultimate
 

5327
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:10,629
so uh that that to me is the ultimate
motivator is to meet other intelligence

5328
01:35:10,629 --> 01:35:10,639
motivator is to meet other intelligence
 

5329
01:35:10,639 --> 01:35:12,229
motivator is to meet other intelligence
life forms out there and connect with

5330
01:35:12,229 --> 01:35:12,239
life forms out there and connect with
 

5331
01:35:12,239 --> 01:35:12,870
life forms out there and connect with
them

5332
01:35:12,870 --> 01:35:12,880
them
 

5333
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:15,990
them

have you ever meet jacques valley
 

5335
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,750
have you ever meet jacques valley
no but i've been in communication i want

i know that there are many theories

5342
01:35:23,830 --> 01:35:23,840
i know that there are many theories
 

5343
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:25,030
i know that there are many theories
about yes

5344
01:35:25,030 --> 01:35:25,040
about yes
 

5345
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:26,870
about yes
you know if there is alien we don't know

5346
01:35:26,870 --> 01:35:26,880
you know if there is alien we don't know
 

5347
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:29,510
you know if there is alien we don't know
right but but some people think it's

5348
01:35:29,510 --> 01:35:29,520
right but but some people think it's
 

5349
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:31,669
right but but some people think it's
from another star systems

5350
01:35:31,669 --> 01:35:31,679
from another star systems
 

5351
01:35:31,679 --> 01:35:34,390
from another star systems
and jaguar is a like to make a long

story short he has a different theory he

5354
01:35:36,390 --> 01:35:36,400
story short he has a different theory he
 

5355
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:38,550
story short he has a different theory he
thinks it's perhaps

5356
01:35:38,550 --> 01:35:38,560
thinks it's perhaps
 

5357
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:41,510
thinks it's perhaps
beans that

5358
01:35:41,510 --> 01:35:41,520

 

5359
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:44,229

could be living in a different dimension

5360
01:35:44,229 --> 01:35:44,239
could be living in a different dimension
 

5361
01:35:44,239 --> 01:35:46,070

than us and the reason why he says that

5362
01:35:46,070 --> 01:35:46,080
than us and the reason why he says that
 

5363
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:46,870
than us and the reason why he says that
is

5364
01:35:46,870 --> 01:35:46,880
is
 

5365
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:48,950
is
when he makes an experiment when there

5366
01:35:48,950 --> 01:35:48,960
when he makes an experiment when there
 

5367
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:52,149
when he makes an experiment when there
is a signings very often of a ufo

5368
01:35:52,149 --> 01:35:52,159
is a signings very often of a ufo
 

5369
01:35:52,159 --> 01:35:54,870
is a signings very often of a ufo
let's say i'm i'm the ufo that you have

5370
01:35:54,870 --> 01:35:54,880
let's say i'm i'm the ufo that you have
 

5371
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:56,950
let's say i'm i'm the ufo that you have
three guys

5372
01:35:56,950 --> 01:35:56,960
three guys
 

5373
01:35:56,960 --> 01:36:00,149
three guys
and one they they are looking at the ufo

5374
01:36:00,149 --> 01:36:00,159
and one they they are looking at the ufo
 

5375
01:36:00,159 --> 01:36:01,510
and one they they are looking at the ufo
very often

5376
01:36:01,510 --> 01:36:01,520
very often
 

5377
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:03,189
very often
one experiment that

5378
01:36:03,189 --> 01:36:03,199
one experiment that
 

5379
01:36:03,199 --> 01:36:05,590
one experiment that
you can do and sometimes that that is

5380
01:36:05,590 --> 01:36:05,600
you can do and sometimes that that is
 

5381
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:07,590
you can do and sometimes that that is
the case you asked your two friend to

5382
01:36:07,590 --> 01:36:07,600
the case you asked your two friend to
 

5383
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:09,430
the case you asked your two friend to
walk on the side and there's a at a

5384
01:36:09,430 --> 01:36:09,440
walk on the side and there's a at a
 

5385
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:11,430
walk on the side and there's a at a
point that it's like a corridor you see

5386
01:36:11,430 --> 01:36:11,440
point that it's like a corridor you see
 

5387
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:13,990
point that it's like a corridor you see
the ufo and then you stop seeing like a

5388
01:36:13,990 --> 01:36:14,000
the ufo and then you stop seeing like a
 

5389
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,270
the ufo and then you stop seeing like a
corridor and

5390
01:36:15,270 --> 01:36:15,280
corridor and
 

5391
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:17,030
corridor and
that's one of the reason why he's saying

5392
01:36:17,030 --> 01:36:17,040
that's one of the reason why he's saying
 

5393
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:17,910
that's one of the reason why he's saying
that

5394
01:36:17,910 --> 01:36:17,920
that
 

5395
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:20,310
that
it's perhaps a dimension and i found

5396
01:36:20,310 --> 01:36:20,320
it's perhaps a dimension and i found
 

5397
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:23,030
it's perhaps a dimension and i found
that fascinating you know i

5398
01:36:23,030 --> 01:36:23,040
that fascinating you know i
 

5399
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:24,950
that fascinating you know i
this is what you know to the discussion

5400
01:36:24,950 --> 01:36:24,960
this is what you know to the discussion
 

5401
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:27,030
this is what you know to the discussion
of consciousness and all that it it

5402
01:36:27,030 --> 01:36:27,040
of consciousness and all that it it
 

5403
01:36:27,040 --> 01:36:28,950
of consciousness and all that it it
feels like we might be just experiencing

5404
01:36:28,950 --> 01:36:28,960
feels like we might be just experiencing
 

5405
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:31,669
feels like we might be just experiencing
a very particular slice of this universe

5406
01:36:31,669 --> 01:36:31,679
a very particular slice of this universe
 

5407
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:33,510
a very particular slice of this universe
we might not be understanding what's at

5408
01:36:33,510 --> 01:36:33,520
we might not be understanding what's at
 

5409
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:35,750
we might not be understanding what's at
the higher dimensions or

5410
01:36:35,750 --> 01:36:35,760
the higher dimensions or
 

5411
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:37,189
the higher dimensions or
yeah i mean higher dimensions in

5412
01:36:37,189 --> 01:36:37,199
yeah i mean higher dimensions in
 

5413
01:36:37,199 --> 01:36:38,790
yeah i mean higher dimensions in
whatever form that means you know

5414
01:36:38,790 --> 01:36:38,800
whatever form that means you know
 

5415
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:41,350
whatever form that means you know
there's all these physical theories now

5416
01:36:41,350 --> 01:36:41,360
there's all these physical theories now
 

5417
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:43,990
there's all these physical theories now
that describe a world with dimensions

5418
01:36:43,990 --> 01:36:44,000
that describe a world with dimensions
 

5419
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,350
that describe a world with dimensions
that's much higher than the four

5420
01:36:45,350 --> 01:36:45,360
that's much higher than the four
 

5421
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:47,109
that's much higher than the four
dimensions of the three-dimensional

5422
01:36:47,109 --> 01:36:47,119
dimensions of the three-dimensional
 

5423
01:36:47,119 --> 01:36:49,669
dimensions of the three-dimensional
space in one dimension of time

5424
01:36:49,669 --> 01:36:49,679
space in one dimension of time
 

5425
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:50,550
space in one dimension of time
so

5426
01:36:50,550 --> 01:36:50,560
so
 

5427
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:52,229
so
whatever the hell is going on in those

5428
01:36:52,229 --> 01:36:52,239
whatever the hell is going on in those
 

5429
01:36:52,239 --> 01:36:54,629
whatever the hell is going on in those
other dimensions it could be

5430
01:36:54,629 --> 01:36:54,639

so
 

5589
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:41,510
so
i yeah i i think

5590
01:39:41,510 --> 01:39:41,520
i yeah i i think
 

5591
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:43,030
i yeah i i think
from from the con you know i've worked

5592
01:39:43,030 --> 01:39:43,040
from from the con you know i've worked
 

5593
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:45,189
from from the con you know i've worked
with darpa i work with uh dod at

5594
01:39:45,189 --> 01:39:45,199
with darpa i work with uh dod at
 

5595
01:39:45,199 --> 01:39:46,629
with darpa i work with uh dod at
clearance and

5596
01:39:46,629 --> 01:39:46,639
clearance and
 

5597
01:39:46,639 --> 01:39:48,550
clearance and
i think from the perspective

5598
01:39:48,550 --> 01:39:48,560
i think from the perspective
 

5599
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:50,229
i think from the perspective
if you if you see the world as

5600
01:39:50,229 --> 01:39:50,239
if you if you see the world as
 

5601
01:39:50,239 --> 01:39:52,790
if you if you see the world as
fundamentally a dangerous world

5602
01:39:52,790 --> 01:39:52,800
fundamentally a dangerous world
 

5603
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:53,590
fundamentally a dangerous world
where

5604
01:39:53,590 --> 01:39:53,600
where
 

5605
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:55,750
where
secrets are important to have from a

5606
01:39:55,750 --> 01:39:55,760
secrets are important to have from a
 

5607
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:57,830
secrets are important to have from a
military perspective

5608
01:39:57,830 --> 01:39:57,840
military perspective
 

5609
01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:01,270
military perspective
i think it's very unsafe to tell

5610
01:40:01,270 --> 01:40:01,280
i think it's very unsafe to tell
 

5611
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:04,070
i think it's very unsafe to tell
the president in the united states

5612
01:40:04,070 --> 01:40:04,080
the president in the united states
 

5613
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:05,990
the president in the united states
that you have this kind of technology so

5614
01:40:05,990 --> 01:40:06,000
that you have this kind of technology so
 

5615
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,470
that you have this kind of technology so
if you think of the world in that way i

5616
01:40:08,470 --> 01:40:08,480
if you think of the world in that way i
 

5617
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:10,790
if you think of the world in that way i
i hate that that's how that world is

5618
01:40:10,790 --> 01:40:10,800
i hate that that's how that world is
 

5619
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:13,030
i hate that that's how that world is
viewed because ultimately i think what's

5620
01:40:13,030 --> 01:40:13,040
viewed because ultimately i think what's
 

5621
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:15,430
viewed because ultimately i think what's
more powerful than the military secrets

5622
01:40:15,430 --> 01:40:15,440
more powerful than the military secrets
 

5623
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:16,870
more powerful than the military secrets
and i hope that actually is what will

5624
01:40:16,870 --> 01:40:16,880
and i hope that actually is what will
 

5625
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:18,790
and i hope that actually is what will
happen in the 21st century

5626
01:40:18,790 --> 01:40:18,800
happen in the 21st century
 

5627
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:20,629
happen in the 21st century
because what's more powerful

5628
01:40:20,629 --> 01:40:20,639
because what's more powerful
 

5629
01:40:20,639 --> 01:40:23,030
because what's more powerful
is inspire people

5630
01:40:23,030 --> 01:40:23,040
is inspire people
 

5631
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:26,070
is inspire people
inspire the the young elon musks of the

5632
01:40:26,070 --> 01:40:26,080
inspire the the young elon musks of the
 

5633
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:26,950
inspire the the young elon musks of the
world

5634
01:40:26,950 --> 01:40:26,960
world
 

5635
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:29,590
world
to to create cool new things if we have

5636
01:40:29,590 --> 01:40:29,600
to to create cool new things if we have
 

5637
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:32,870
to to create cool new things if we have
technology that we've

5638
01:40:32,870 --> 01:40:32,880

 

5639
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:34,870

come have encountered that we don't

5640
01:40:34,870 --> 01:40:34,880
come have encountered that we don't
 

5641
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:36,550
come have encountered that we don't
understand that should only be

5642
01:40:36,550 --> 01:40:36,560
understand that should only be
 

5643
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:38,229
understand that should only be
inspiration

5644
01:40:38,229 --> 01:40:38,239
inspiration
 

5645
01:40:38,239 --> 01:40:40,790
inspiration
to uh develop that kind of stuff it

5646
01:40:40,790 --> 01:40:40,800
to uh develop that kind of stuff it
 

5647
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:43,430
to uh develop that kind of stuff it
shouldn't be seen as military

5648
01:40:43,430 --> 01:40:43,440
shouldn't be seen as military
 

5649
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:45,750
shouldn't be seen as military
as a military threat as a secret to hold

5650
01:40:45,750 --> 01:40:45,760
as a military threat as a secret to hold
 

5651
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:46,629
as a military threat as a secret to hold
on to

5652
01:40:46,629 --> 01:40:46,639
on to
 

5653
01:40:46,639 --> 01:40:49,430
on to
i think secrets um

5654
01:40:49,430 --> 01:40:49,440
i think secrets um
 

5655
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:50,950
i think secrets um
i hope

5656
01:40:50,950 --> 01:40:50,960
i hope
 

5657
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:52,870
i hope
we more and more let go of the idea that

5658
01:40:52,870 --> 01:40:52,880
we more and more let go of the idea that
 

5659
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:55,270
we more and more let go of the idea that
there are secrets that give us advantage

5660
01:40:55,270 --> 01:40:55,280
there are secrets that give us advantage
 

5661
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:57,910
there are secrets that give us advantage
you know like in the tech sector people

5662
01:40:57,910 --> 01:40:57,920
you know like in the tech sector people
 

5663
01:40:57,920 --> 01:41:00,629
you know like in the tech sector people
are more and more releasing the software

5664
01:41:00,629 --> 01:41:00,639
are more and more releasing the software
 

5665
01:41:00,639 --> 01:41:03,030
are more and more releasing the software
they're making an open source

5666
01:41:03,030 --> 01:41:03,040
they're making an open source
 

5667
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:05,270
they're making an open source
like secrets don't make sense

5668
01:41:05,270 --> 01:41:05,280
like secrets don't make sense
 

5669
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:07,109
like secrets don't make sense
they share the knowledge right share the

5670
01:41:07,109 --> 01:41:07,119
they share the knowledge right share the
 

5671
01:41:07,119 --> 01:41:08,629
they share the knowledge right share the
share the knowledge like share like

5672
01:41:08,629 --> 01:41:08,639
share the knowledge like share like
 

5673
01:41:08,639 --> 01:41:10,790
share the knowledge like share like
being afraid to share the knowledge i

5674
01:41:10,790 --> 01:41:10,800
being afraid to share the knowledge i
 

5675
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:13,590
being afraid to share the knowledge i
think i hope is an old idea it's more

5676
01:41:13,590 --> 01:41:13,600
think i hope is an old idea it's more
 

5677
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:15,229
think i hope is an old idea it's more
yeah when you make it things more

5678
01:41:15,229 --> 01:41:15,239
yeah when you make it things more
 

5679
01:41:15,239 --> 01:41:17,590
yeah when you make it things more
compartmentalized you know yes

5680
01:41:17,590 --> 01:41:17,600
compartmentalized you know yes
 

5681
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:19,430
compartmentalized you know yes
well yeah what that's the other thing is

5682
01:41:19,430 --> 01:41:19,440
well yeah what that's the other thing is
 

5683
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:22,310
well yeah what that's the other thing is
the bureaucracy of government is like

5684
01:41:22,310 --> 01:41:22,320
the bureaucracy of government is like
 

5685
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:24,229
the bureaucracy of government is like
people only know their own little thing

5686
01:41:24,229 --> 01:41:24,239
people only know their own little thing
 

5687
01:41:24,239 --> 01:41:25,830
people only know their own little thing
and they don't spread the information it

5688
01:41:25,830 --> 01:41:25,840
and they don't spread the information it
 

5689
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:27,669
and they don't spread the information it
doesn't travel well i mean there's a lot

5690
01:41:27,669 --> 01:41:27,679
doesn't travel well i mean there's a lot
 

5691
01:41:27,679 --> 01:41:29,830
doesn't travel well i mean there's a lot
of just inefficiencies that are it makes

5692
01:41:29,830 --> 01:41:29,840
of just inefficiencies that are it makes
 

5693
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:32,870
of just inefficiencies that are it makes
me sad it makes me sad because uh

5694
01:41:32,870 --> 01:41:32,880
me sad it makes me sad because uh
 

5695
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:33,910
me sad it makes me sad because uh
the

5696
01:41:33,910 --> 01:41:33,920
the
 

5697
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:35,910
the
the science the engineering that happens

5698
01:41:35,910 --> 01:41:35,920
the science the engineering that happens
 

5699
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:38,149
the science the engineering that happens
in governments like lockheed martin

5700
01:41:38,149 --> 01:41:38,159
in governments like lockheed martin
 

5701
01:41:38,159 --> 01:41:39,750
in governments like lockheed martin
developing the different

5702
01:41:39,750 --> 01:41:39,760
developing the different
 

5703
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:41,669
developing the different
airplanes that they use for military

5704
01:41:41,669 --> 01:41:41,679
airplanes that they use for military
 

5705
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:42,870
airplanes that they use for military
applications is some of the most

5706
01:41:42,870 --> 01:41:42,880
applications is some of the most
 

5707
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:45,109
applications is some of the most
incredible engineering ever and it's

5708
01:41:45,109 --> 01:41:45,119
incredible engineering ever and it's
 

5709
01:41:45,119 --> 01:41:47,830
incredible engineering ever and it's
secret because they're afraid to share

5710
01:41:47,830 --> 01:41:47,840
secret because they're afraid to share
 

5711
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:49,830
secret because they're afraid to share
it with the russians and the chinese and

5712
01:41:49,830 --> 01:41:49,840
it with the russians and the chinese and
 

5713
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:51,189
it with the russians and the chinese and
so on

5714

so on
 

5715
01:41:51,199 --> 01:41:53,590
so on
but on that topic i do think somebody

5716
01:41:53,590 --> 01:41:53,600
but on that topic i do think somebody
 

5717
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:56,550
but on that topic i do think somebody
like vladimir putin window probably

5718

like vladimir putin window probably
 

5719
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:58,149
like vladimir putin window probably
knows some stuff

5720
01:41:58,149 --> 01:41:58,159
knows some stuff
 

5721
01:41:58,159 --> 01:42:00,790
knows some stuff
my god my god i would i would love to

know what he knows but then again you

5724
01:42:02,950 --> 01:42:02,960
know what he knows but then again you
 

5725
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:05,430
know what he knows but then again you
never know because even he is you know

5726
01:42:05,430 --> 01:42:05,440
never know because even he is you know
 

5727
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:06,950
never know because even he is you know
people think of him as an exceptionally

5728

people think of him as an exceptionally
 

5729
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:08,470
people think of him as an exceptionally
powerful person

5730
01:42:08,470 --> 01:42:08,480
powerful person
 

5731
01:42:08,480 --> 01:42:10,390
powerful person
but he's also just managing a bunch of

but he's also just managing a bunch of
 

5733
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:12,229
but he's also just managing a bunch of
tribes

5734
01:42:12,229 --> 01:42:12,239
tribes
 

5735
01:42:12,239 --> 01:42:14,790
tribes
his power is very limited he's trying to

5736
01:42:14,790 --> 01:42:14,800
his power is very limited he's trying to
 

5737
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:16,550
his power is very limited he's trying to
hold together

5738
01:42:16,550 --> 01:42:16,560
hold together
 

5739
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:18,709
hold together
uh a bunch of greedy

5740
01:42:18,709 --> 01:42:18,719
uh a bunch of greedy
 

5741
01:42:18,719 --> 01:42:20,550
uh a bunch of greedy
power-hungry

5742
01:42:20,550 --> 01:42:20,560
power-hungry
 

5743
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:22,390
power-hungry
mad men that's right okay and he's

5744
01:42:22,390 --> 01:42:22,400
mad men that's right okay and he's
 

5745
01:42:22,400 --> 01:42:24,390
mad men that's right okay and he's
trying to establish a balance

5746
01:42:24,390 --> 01:42:24,400
trying to establish a balance
 

5747
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:27,189
trying to establish a balance
he might not know everything so

5748
01:42:27,189 --> 01:42:27,199
he might not know everything so
 

5749
01:42:27,199 --> 01:42:29,109

you might imagine if we if we're like a
 

5921
01:45:16,239 --> 01:45:18,629
you might imagine if we if we're like a
fish in the water we live in our own

5922
01:45:18,629 --> 01:45:18,639
fish in the water we live in our own
 

5923
01:45:18,639 --> 01:45:20,709
fish in the water we live in our own
world and sometimes there's a

5924
01:45:20,709 --> 01:45:20,719
world and sometimes there's a
 

5925
01:45:20,719 --> 01:45:22,629
world and sometimes there's a
fisherman that grabbed the fish yeah

5926
01:45:22,629 --> 01:45:22,639
fisherman that grabbed the fish yeah
 

5927
01:45:22,639 --> 01:45:24,870
fisherman that grabbed the fish yeah
take him out of the water and threw it

5928
01:45:24,870 --> 01:45:24,880
take him out of the water and threw it
 

5929
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:26,390
take him out of the water and threw it
back in the water and the fish goes back

5930
01:45:26,390 --> 01:45:26,400
back in the water and the fish goes back
 

5931
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:27,830
back in the water and the fish goes back
to the other fish and say

5932
01:45:27,830 --> 01:45:27,840
to the other fish and say
 

5933
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:28,870
to the other fish and say
hey

5934
01:45:28,870 --> 01:45:28,880
hey
 

5935
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:30,470
hey
there's someone that that take me out of

5936
01:45:30,470 --> 01:45:30,480
there's someone that that take me out of
 

5937
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:32,550
there's someone that that take me out of
the water then i've seen uh things that

5938
01:45:32,550 --> 01:45:32,560
the water then i've seen uh things that
 

5939
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:34,870
the water then i've seen uh things that
i did not like imagine if it's true like

5940
01:45:34,870 --> 01:45:34,880
i did not like imagine if it's true like
 

5941
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:36,149
i did not like imagine if it's true like
we like

5942
01:45:36,149 --> 01:45:36,159
we like
 

5943
01:45:36,159 --> 01:45:39,109
we like
yeah and and one other thing like

i wanted to ask you because you were
consciousness how about dreams what is a

5948
01:45:43,830 --> 01:45:43,840
consciousness how about dreams what is a
 

5949
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:46,629
consciousness how about dreams what is a
dream yeah well i i more and more i

5950
01:45:46,629 --> 01:45:46,639
dream yeah well i i more and more i
 

5951
01:45:46,639 --> 01:45:47,910
dream yeah well i i more and more i
don't know if you're paying attention to

5952
01:45:47,910 --> 01:45:47,920
don't know if you're paying attention to
 

5953
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:49,669
don't know if you're paying attention to
this there's now it's become more

5954
01:45:49,669 --> 01:45:49,679
this there's now it's become more
 

5955
01:45:49,679 --> 01:45:51,510
this there's now it's become more
acceptable in the scientific community

5956
01:45:51,510 --> 01:45:51,520
acceptable in the scientific community
 

5957
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:52,950
acceptable in the scientific community
to do large-scale studies of

5958
01:45:52,950 --> 01:45:52,960
to do large-scale studies of
 

5959
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:54,470
to do large-scale studies of
psychedelics for example and there's a

5960
01:45:54,470 --> 01:45:54,480
psychedelics for example and there's a
 

5961
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:56,470
psychedelics for example and there's a
lot of connection between psychedelics

5962
01:45:56,470 --> 01:45:56,480
lot of connection between psychedelics
 

5963
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:58,870
lot of connection between psychedelics
and dreams it's very similar states

5964
01:45:58,870 --> 01:45:58,880
and dreams it's very similar states
 

5965
01:45:58,880 --> 01:45:59,669
and dreams it's very similar states
there's

5966
01:45:59,669 --> 01:45:59,679
there's
 

5967
01:45:59,679 --> 01:46:01,590
there's
there's a lot our mind does

5968
01:46:01,590 --> 01:46:01,600
there's a lot our mind does
 

5969
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:03,669
there's a lot our mind does
when it detaches itself from reality

5970
01:46:03,669 --> 01:46:03,679
when it detaches itself from reality
 

5971
01:46:03,679 --> 01:46:05,109
when it detaches itself from reality
that it can just explore a lot of

5972
01:46:05,109 --> 01:46:05,119
that it can just explore a lot of
 

5973
01:46:05,119 --> 01:46:07,030
that it can just explore a lot of
different ideas it's very possible that

5974
01:46:07,030 --> 01:46:07,040
different ideas it's very possible that
 

5975
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:09,430
different ideas it's very possible that
dreams is you're traveling somewhere and

5976
01:46:09,430 --> 01:46:09,440
dreams is you're traveling somewhere and
 

5977
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:10,870
dreams is you're traveling somewhere and
the same thing with psychedelics you're

5978
01:46:10,870 --> 01:46:10,880
the same thing with psychedelics you're
 

5979
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:12,390
the same thing with psychedelics you're
traveling somewhere

5980
01:46:12,390 --> 01:46:12,400
traveling somewhere
 

5981
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:13,830
traveling somewhere
in a different

5982
01:46:13,830 --> 01:46:13,840
in a different
 

5983
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:15,430
in a different
not traveling through physical space

5984
01:46:15,430 --> 01:46:15,440
not traveling through physical space
 

5985
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:16,950
not traveling through physical space
it's the other dimensions that we're

5986
01:46:16,950 --> 01:46:16,960
it's the other dimensions that we're
 

5987
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:18,229
it's the other dimensions that we're
talking about you're traveling some

5988
01:46:18,229 --> 01:46:18,239
talking about you're traveling some
 

5989
01:46:18,239 --> 01:46:19,590

5992
01:46:21,109 --> 01:46:21,119
through some other dimension to meet
 

5993
01:46:21,119 --> 01:46:23,430
through some other dimension to meet
some other creature people talk with dmt

5994
01:46:23,430 --> 01:46:23,440
some other creature people talk with dmt
 

5995
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:25,189

5997
01:46:25,199 --> 01:46:27,510
that they meet some elves i've never
done i i'd like to i don't know if

5998
01:46:27,510 --> 01:46:27,520
done i i'd like to i don't know if
 

5999
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:31,270
done i i'd like to i don't know if
there's a safe legal way to do it but uh

6000
01:46:31,270 --> 01:46:31,280
there's a safe legal way to do it but uh
 

6001
01:46:31,280 --> 01:46:34,310
there's a safe legal way to do it but uh
they all talk about meeting elves

6002
01:46:34,310 --> 01:46:34,320
they all talk about meeting elves
 

6003
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:36,790
they all talk about meeting elves
and they're like creatures like entities

6004
01:46:36,790 --> 01:46:36,800
and they're like creatures like entities
 

6005
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:39,189
and they're like creatures like entities
and like who are who are they

6006
01:46:39,189 --> 01:46:39,199
and like who are who are they
 

6007
01:46:39,199 --> 01:46:40,790
and like who are who are they
what's

6008
01:46:40,790 --> 01:46:40,800
what's
 

6009
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:43,109
what's
what is this is it because they're high

6010
01:46:43,109 --> 01:46:43,119
what is this is it because they're high
 

6011
01:46:43,119 --> 01:46:44,390
what is this is it because they're high
or it's because

6012
01:46:44,390 --> 01:46:44,400
or it's because
 

6013
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:46,070
or it's because
they're actually meeting something and

6014
01:46:46,070 --> 01:46:46,080
they're actually meeting something and
 

6015
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:48,390
they're actually meeting something and
maybe there's no difference i mean that

6016
01:46:48,390 --> 01:46:48,400
maybe there's no difference i mean that
 

6017
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:50,390
maybe there's no difference i mean that
uh who knows exactly and that takes us

6018
01:46:50,390 --> 01:46:50,400
uh who knows exactly and that takes us
 

6019
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:51,750
uh who knows exactly and that takes us
right back to us not being able to

6020
01:46:51,750 --> 01:46:51,760
right back to us not being able to
 

6021
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:54,950
right back to us not being able to
really understand how our mind works

6022
01:46:54,950 --> 01:46:54,960
really understand how our mind works
 

6023
01:46:54,960 --> 01:46:56,470
really understand how our mind works
you know i work in artificial

6024
01:46:56,470 --> 01:46:56,480
you know i work in artificial
 

6025
01:46:56,480 --> 01:46:57,990
you know i work in artificial

intelligence
 

6027
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,470
intelligence
it's clear that we understand so little

6028
01:47:00,470 --> 01:47:00,480
it's clear that we understand so little
 

6029
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:02,390
it's clear that we understand so little
about intelligence some basic things

6030
01:47:02,390 --> 01:47:02,400
about intelligence some basic things
 

6031
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:04,229
about intelligence some basic things
about intelligence

01:47:04,229 --> 01:47:04,239
about intelligence
 

6033
01:47:04,239 --> 01:47:07,510
about intelligence
just at the at the very sort of basic uh

6034
01:47:07,510 --> 01:47:07,520
just at the at the very sort of basic uh
 

6035
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:10,070
just at the at the very sort of basic uh
first principles level we don't

6036
01:47:10,070 --> 01:47:10,080
first principles level we don't
 

6037
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:12,310
first principles level we don't
understand what it means

6038
01:47:12,310 --> 01:47:12,320

sick and they die or because they they
it's either because sometimes we think

8614
02:33:08,950 --> 02:33:08,960
it's either because sometimes we think
 

8615
02:33:08,960 --> 02:33:11,670
it's either because sometimes we think
we we

8616
02:33:11,670 --> 02:33:11,680

making not work and giving them a break
 

8623
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:21,590
making not work and giving them a break
so in our mind we're like oh it's gonna

but
 

8629
02:33:24,720 --> 02:33:26,150
but
