by the time they actually stand in front
of a class

572
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:39,279
of a class
 

573
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,590
of a class
they pretty much have their 250

574
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:41,600
they pretty much have their 250

they pretty much have their 250
powerpoint slides memorized

576
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:43,360
powerpoint slides memorized
 

577
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,630
powerpoint slides memorized
and they don't even turn around they

578
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:44,640
and they don't even turn around they
 

579
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,550
and they don't even turn around they
just click and they know them in order

580
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:46,560
just click and they know them in order
 

581
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,870
just click and they know them in order
and they repeat the same thing over it's

582
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:48,880
and they repeat the same thing over it's
 

583
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,550
and they repeat the same thing over it's
and it's standardized

584
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:50,560
and it's standardized
 

585
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,230
and it's standardized
so they are extremely extremely

586
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:52,240
so they are extremely extremely
 

587
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,430
so they are extremely extremely
standardized when you go through school

588
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:53,440
standardized when you go through school
 

589
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,870
standardized when you go through school
and there's a reason for that

590
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:54,880
and there's a reason for that
 

591
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,230
and there's a reason for that
because what they're doing is they're

doing that
um but there's things that don't really

930
00:15:06,069 --> 00:15:06,079
um but there's things that don't really
 

931
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:06,870

think very quickly
 

949
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,829
think very quickly
uh 80 solution is typically good enough

950
00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:23,839
uh 80 solution is typically good enough
 

951
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:24,949
uh 80 solution is typically good enough
because if you overthink it

952
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:24,959
because if you overthink it
 

953
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,430
because if you overthink it
you're you're behind and then in an

people try and overthink it
 

959
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,590
people try and overthink it
and before you know it because it's

960

if i just kind of get above 40 then i'm

1019
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,509
good and i can watch how he reacts and
then i can adjust for that and you

1020
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:19,519
then i can adjust for that and you
 

1021
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,910
then i can adjust for that and you
and you continually work that problem

and you continually work that problem
 

1023
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,430
and you continually work that problem
and you chip away because if you start

00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:24,080
side-by-side bomber so it's a pilot on
 

1293
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,190
side-by-side bomber so it's a pilot on
the left seat and the bombardier

1294
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:25,200
the left seat and the bombardier
 

1295
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,470
the left seat and the bombardier
navigators on the right seat it was

1296
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:26,480
navigators on the right seat it was
 

1297
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,149
navigators on the right seat it was
built in the 60s

1298
00:20:28,149 --> 00:20:28,159
built in the 60s
 

1299
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,029
built in the 60s
it is all weather and it flies low at

1300
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:31,039
it is all weather and it flies low at
 

1301
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,029
it is all weather and it flies low at
night it's got a terrain mapping radar

1302
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:33,039
night it's got a terrain mapping radar
 

1303
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,310
night it's got a terrain mapping radar
how many i guess is that a good term to

1304
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:36,320
how many i guess is that a good term to
 

1305
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,710
how many i guess is that a good term to
use fighter jets as a broad category for

1306
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:38,720
use fighter jets as a broad category for
 

1307
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,470
use fighter jets as a broad category for
for the public yeah that's probably how

1308
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:40,480
for the public yeah that's probably how
 

1309
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,549
for the public yeah that's probably how
many fighter jets are side by side like

1310
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:42,559
many fighter jets are side by side like
 

1311
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:43,190
many fighter jets are side by side like
that

1312
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:43,200
that
 

1313
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,630
that
that was uh in the navy that was the

1314
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:44,640
that was uh in the navy that was the
 

1315
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,310
that was uh in the navy that was the
only one the

1316
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:46,320
only one the
 

1317
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,630
only one the
air force the f-111 was a side-by-side

1318
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:48,640
air force the f-111 was a side-by-side
 

1319
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,310
air force the f-111 was a side-by-side
but the navy it was the a6 and then

1320
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:50,320
but the navy it was the a6 and then
 

1321
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,230
but the navy it was the a6 and then
there's the ea6b which is a derivative

1322
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:52,240
there's the ea6b which is a derivative
 

1323
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,110
there's the ea6b which is a derivative
of

1324
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:53,120
of
 

1325
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,630
of
that and now that those are all gone the

1326
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:54,640
that and now that those are all gone the
 

1327
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,470
that and now that those are all gone the
a6b's just went away a few years ago and

1328
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:56,480
a6b's just went away a few years ago and
 

1329
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,110
a6b's just went away a few years ago and
now the

1330
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:57,120
now the
 

1331
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,630
now the
e18g growler is the replacement for the

1332
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:00,640
e18g growler is the replacement for the
 

1333
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,590
e18g growler is the replacement for the
a6b

1334
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:01,600
a6b
 

1335
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,830
a6b
there was never a replacement for the a6

1336
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:03,840
there was never a replacement for the a6
 

1337
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,630
there was never a replacement for the a6
that i flew

1338
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:04,640
that i flew
 

1339
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,669
that i flew
it really became the f-18 which the a6

1340
00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:07,679
it really became the f-18 which the a6
 

1341
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:08,149
it really became the f-18 which the a6
could

1342
00:21:08,149 --> 00:21:08,159
could
 

1343
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,549
could
go quite a bit further distance wise by

1344
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:10,559
go quite a bit further distance wise by
 

1345
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:11,830
go quite a bit further distance wise by
fuel

1346
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:11,840
fuel
 

1347
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,870
fuel
than the hornet and uh the horn is the

1348
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:14,880
than the hornet and uh the horn is the
 

1349
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,909
than the hornet and uh the horn is the
f-18 yeah is there usually two people

1350
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:17,919
f-18 yeah is there usually two people
 

1351
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,669
f-18 yeah is there usually two people
in the plane but they're usually like in

1352
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:19,679
in the plane but they're usually like in
 

1353
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:20,950
in the plane but they're usually like in
front and behind

1354
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:20,960
front and behind
 

1355
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,430
front and behind
in a the modern two-seaters yes uh but

1356
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:23,440
in a the modern two-seaters yes uh but
 

1357
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,110
in a the modern two-seaters yes uh but
most of the tactical airplanes in the

1358
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:25,120
most of the tactical airplanes in the
 

1359
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,549
most of the tactical airplanes in the
world today are single seat

1360
00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:26,559
world today are single seat
 

1361
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:27,990
world today are single seat
so you can see just one person one

1362
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:28,000
so you can see just one person one
 

1363
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,230
so you can see just one person one
person with the exception of

1364
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:30,240
person with the exception of
 

1365
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,430
person with the exception of
i'll probably someone will yell at me

1366
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:31,440
i'll probably someone will yell at me
 

1367
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,190
i'll probably someone will yell at me
but really with the exception of the

1368
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:33,200
but really with the exception of the
 

1369
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,789
but really with the exception of the
f-15e strike eagle

1370
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:34,799
f-15e strike eagle
 

1371
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,350
f-15e strike eagle
and the f-18f super hornet which is the

1372
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:37,360
and the f-18f super hornet which is the
 

1373
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,390
and the f-18f super hornet which is the
f is a two-seater

1374
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:38,400
f is a two-seater
 

1375
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,310
f is a two-seater
and the g is also a two-seater but it's

1376
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:40,320
and the g is also a two-seater but it's
 

1377
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,230
and the g is also a two-seater but it's
more of an electronic attack by say

1378
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:42,240
more of an electronic attack by say
 

1379
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,510
more of an electronic attack by say
full-up fighter bomber so most of the

1380
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:45,520
full-up fighter bomber so most of the
 

1381
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,430
full-up fighter bomber so most of the
time that you've flown

1382
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:47,440
time that you've flown
 

1383
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,470
time that you've flown
in your like i said 18-year career

1384
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:50,480
in your like i said 18-year career
 

1385
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,470
in your like i said 18-year career
is was it two-seater i was about half

1386
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:52,480
is was it two-seater i was about half
 

1387
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,630
is was it two-seater i was about half
and half so i started off an a6 was a

1388
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:54,640
and half so i started off an a6 was a
 

1389
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,669
and half so i started off an a6 was a
two-seater

1390
00:21:55,669 --> 00:21:55,679
two-seater
 

1391
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,990
two-seater
then i went to single-seat f-18s and i

1392
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:58,000
then i went to single-seat f-18s and i
 

1393
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,270
then i went to single-seat f-18s and i
flew those

1394
00:21:59,270 --> 00:21:59,280
flew those
 

1395
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,110
flew those
all the way up until 2000 and

1396
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:03,120
all the way up until 2000 and
 

1397
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,590
all the way up until 2000 and
let me think 2001 to the end of 2001

1398
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:07,600
let me think 2001 to the end of 2001
 

1399
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,029
let me think 2001 to the end of 2001
and then i shifted over and started

1400
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:09,039
and then i shifted over and started
 

1401
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,470
and then i shifted over and started
flying the super hornets and i've flown

1402
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:10,480
flying the super hornets and i've flown
 

1403
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,149
flying the super hornets and i've flown
both of those the ease and the s but i

1404
00:22:12,149 --> 00:22:12,159
both of those the ease and the s but i
 

1405
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,350
both of those the ease and the s but i
deployed when i had command of vfa41

1406
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:15,360
deployed when i had command of vfa41
 

1407
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,830
deployed when i had command of vfa41
i had the two seat they were f squadron

1408
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:17,840
i had the two seat they were f squadron
 

1409
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,549
i had the two seat they were f squadron
so you

1410
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:18,559
so you
 

1411
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:22,230
so you
eventually ended up commanding

1412
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:22,240
eventually ended up commanding
 

1413
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,830
eventually ended up commanding
the the strike fighter squadron

1414
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:25,840
the the strike fighter squadron
 

1415
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,950
the the strike fighter squadron
i love the the name the black aces what

1416
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:28,960
i love the the name the black aces what
 

1417
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,990
i love the the name the black aces what
uh

1418
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:30,000
uh
 

1419
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,110
uh
is there some parts of that

1420
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:33,120
is there some parts of that
 

1421
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,950
is there some parts of that
journey that are amazing parts of it

1422
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:34,960
journey that are amazing parts of it
 

1423
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,789
journey that are amazing parts of it
that are tough that kind of stand out

1424
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:36,799
that are tough that kind of stand out
 

1425
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,390
that are tough that kind of stand out
to me it was one it was a huge honor uh

1426
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:40,400
to me it was one it was a huge honor uh

1429
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,310
and i got to serve with uh you know i
got pulled up because the the guy who

1430
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:44,320
got pulled up because the the guy who
 

1431
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,070
got pulled up because the the guy who
the the people that are exos because we

1432
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:46,080
the the people that are exos because we
 

1433
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,430
the the people that are exos because we
fleet up you go from the number two guy

1434
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:47,440
fleet up you go from the number two guy
 

1435
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,789
fleet up you go from the number two guy
to the number one guy

1436
00:22:48,789 --> 00:22:48,799
to the number one guy
 

1437
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,470
to the number one guy
so the exo becomes the ceo so the

1438
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:50,480
so the exo becomes the ceo so the
 

1439
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,070
so the exo becomes the ceo so the
executive officer becomes the commanding

1440
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:52,080
executive officer becomes the commanding
 

1441
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:52,950
executive officer becomes the commanding
officer

1442
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:52,960
officer
 

1443
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,149
officer

was the exo and he
 

1453
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,630
was the exo and he
really wanted because he knew there was

really wanted because he knew there was
 

1455
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,710

since the forever and now all of a
 

1465
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,149
since the forever and now all of a
sudden you've got the f-18f coming in

00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:18,159
sudden you've got the f-18f coming in
 

1467
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,830
sudden you've got the f-18f coming in
which has the weapon systems operators

1468
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:19,840
which has the weapon systems operators

that are not pilots they're weapon
 

1473
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,750
that are not pilots they're weapon
systems operators and there's a

1474
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:23,760
systems operators and there's a
 

1475
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,110
systems operators and there's a
difference

1476
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:25,120
difference
 

1477
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,270
difference
and kenny is a weapon systems operator

1478
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:27,280
and kenny is a weapon systems operator
 

1479
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,110
and kenny is a weapon systems operator
and uh

1480
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:29,120
and uh
 

1481
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,270
and uh
kenny knew because of my a6 background

1482
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:31,280
kenny knew because of my a6 background
 

1483
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,430
kenny knew because of my a6 background
that i have a switch that i can go one

1484
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:33,440
that i have a switch that i can go one
 

1485
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,310
that i have a switch that i can go one
seat 2c1 c2c because when you fly 2c

1486
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:36,320
seat 2c1 c2c because when you fly 2c
 

1487
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,909
seat 2c1 c2c because when you fly 2c
there's a lot of stuff that the pilot

1488
00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:37,919
there's a lot of stuff that the pilot
 

1489
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,830
there's a lot of stuff that the pilot
will offload and

1490
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:39,840
will offload and
 

1491
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,590
will offload and
take the advantage of the weapon systems

1492
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:41,600
take the advantage of the weapon systems
 

1493
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,990
take the advantage of the weapon systems
operator and it's not that one plus one

1494
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:44,000
operator and it's not that one plus one
 

1495
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,669
operator and it's not that one plus one
equals two in that environment because

1496
00:23:45,669 --> 00:23:45,679
equals two in that environment because
 

1497
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:46,789
equals two in that environment because
it really

1498
00:23:46,789 --> 00:23:46,799
it really
 

1499
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,390
it really
there's a huge amount of capabilities

1500
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:48,400
there's a huge amount of capabilities
 

1501
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,750
there's a huge amount of capabilities
that the single seat has and the

1502
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:49,760
that the single seat has and the
 

1503
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,950
that the single seat has and the
autonomy that

1504
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:50,960
autonomy that
 

1505
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,789
autonomy that
comes for the ability to make decisions

1506
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:52,799
comes for the ability to make decisions
 

1507
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,830
comes for the ability to make decisions
quickly and how well the airplane flies

1508
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:55,840
quickly and how well the airplane flies
 

1509
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,390
quickly and how well the airplane flies
but it does it does equal more than one

1510
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:58,400
but it does it does equal more than one
 

1511
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,110
but it does it does equal more than one
and i would say

1512
00:23:59,110 --> 00:23:59,120
and i would say
 

1513
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,510
and i would say
that one plus one with two people as

1514
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:01,520
that one plus one with two people as
 

1515
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,070
that one plus one with two people as
well as a minimum of 1.5

1516
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:04,080
well as a minimum of 1.5
 

1517
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,990
well as a minimum of 1.5
because you've got an extra head you've

1518
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:06,000
because you've got an extra head you've
 

1519
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,990
because you've got an extra head you've
got extra eyes you've got someone that

1520
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:08,000
got extra eyes you've got someone that
 

1521
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,149
got extra eyes you've got someone that
can monitor systems the airplanes can do

1522
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:10,159
can monitor systems the airplanes can do
 

1523
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:11,510
can monitor systems the airplanes can do
two things at once i mean there's an

1524
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:11,520
two things at once i mean there's an
 

1525
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,110
two things at once i mean there's an
incredible amount of capability that we

1526
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:13,120
incredible amount of capability that we
 

1527
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,630
incredible amount of capability that we
add when we do that

1528
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:14,640
add when we do that
 

1529
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,630
add when we do that
can we just pause on that just for me

1530
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:16,640
can we just pause on that just for me
 

1531
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,549
can we just pause on that just for me
from like a human factors perspective

1532
00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:18,559
from like a human factors perspective
 

1533
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:19,110
from like a human factors perspective
and also an

1534
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:19,120
and also an
 

1535
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,390
and also an
ai perspective what's

1536
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:22,400
ai perspective what's
 

1537
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,710
ai perspective what's
how difficult uh so there's like when

1538
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:24,720
how difficult uh so there's like when
 

1539
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,230
how difficult uh so there's like when
there's two people

1540
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:26,240
there's two people
 

1541
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,590
there's two people
there's also a third person that's the

1542
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:29,600
there's also a third person that's the
 

1543
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,230
there's also a third person that's the
ai part there's some level of automation

1544
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:32,240
ai part there's some level of automation
 

1545
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,430
ai part there's some level of automation
like autopilot maybe

1546
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:33,440
like autopilot maybe
 

1547
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,430
like autopilot maybe
that's correct maybe you can kind of

1548
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:35,440
that's correct maybe you can kind of
 

1549
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,590
that's correct maybe you can kind of
talk about the psychology of like

1550
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:37,600
talk about the psychology of like
 

1551
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,149
talk about the psychology of like
you said making decisions really quick

1552
00:24:40,149 --> 00:24:40,159
you said making decisions really quick
 

1553
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,909
you said making decisions really quick
80

1554
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:41,919
80
 

1555
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,710
80
how do you deal with another brain

1556
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:44,720
how do you deal with another brain
 

1557
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,149
how do you deal with another brain
working with you

1558
00:24:46,149 --> 00:24:46,159
working with you
 

1559
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,789
working with you
and then also the automation is there

1560
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:48,799
and then also the automation is there
 

1561
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:49,510
and then also the automation is there
interesting

1562
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:49,520
interesting
 

1563
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,630
interesting
interplay that you get to learn and also

1564
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:52,640
interplay that you get to learn and also
 

1565
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,630
interplay that you get to learn and also
as that change throughout your career i

1566
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:54,640
as that change throughout your career i
 

1567
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,230
as that change throughout your career i
imagine it got

1568
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:56,240
imagine it got
 

1569
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,990
imagine it got
gotten better in terms of the automation

1570
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:58,000
gotten better in terms of the automation
 

1571
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,430
gotten better in terms of the automation
or perhaps not

1572
00:24:59,430 --> 00:24:59,440
or perhaps not
 

1573
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,190
or perhaps not
well i can tell you so that let's say

1574
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:01,200
well i can tell you so that let's say
 

1575
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,549
well i can tell you so that let's say
there's a bunch of stars this is no this

1576
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:02,559
there's a bunch of stars this is no this
 

1577
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:03,669
there's a bunch of stars this is no this
is this is good this is good

1578
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:03,679
is this is good this is good
 

1579
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,669
is this is good this is good
and this is i'm enjoying this because

1580
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:05,679
and this is i'm enjoying this because
 

1581
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:06,789
and this is i'm enjoying this because
now we actually get to talk about

1582
00:25:06,789 --> 00:25:06,799
now we actually get to talk about
 

1583
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,710
now we actually get to talk about
something other than a tic tac so

1584
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:08,720
something other than a tic tac so
 

1585
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,430
something other than a tic tac so
um so let's start with the a6 the a6 was

1586
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:11,440
um so let's start with the a6 the a6 was
 

1587
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:11,909
um so let's start with the a6 the a6 was
really an

1588
00:25:11,909 --> 00:25:11,919
really an
 

1589
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,470
really an
analog airplane that was built in the

1590
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:14,480
analog airplane that was built in the
 

1591
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,669
analog airplane that was built in the
60s

1592
00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:15,679
60s
 

1593
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,870
60s
all right and there's been studies done

1594
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:18,880
all right and there's been studies done
 

1595
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,390
all right and there's been studies done
on the crew coordination which is the

1596
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:20,400
on the crew coordination which is the
 

1597
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,990
on the crew coordination which is the
interaction between the pilot and the

1598
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:22,000
interaction between the pilot and the
 

1599
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,510
interaction between the pilot and the
bombardier navigator

1600
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:23,520
bombardier navigator
 

1601
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,669
bombardier navigator
so we would fly low at night in the

1602
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:25,679
so we would fly low at night in the
 

1603
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,029
so we would fly low at night in the
mountains so

1604
00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:27,039
mountains so
 

1605
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,230
mountains so
i was stationed up in whidbey island

1606

washington so you've got the cascades

1608
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:30,240
washington so you've got the cascades
 

1609
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,190
washington so you've got the cascades
and

1610
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:31,200
and
 

1611
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,190
and
incredible uh amount of time and we

1612
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:33,200
incredible uh amount of time and we
 

1613
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,789
incredible uh amount of time and we
would get in the simulators because

1614
00:25:34,789 --> 00:25:34,799
would get in the simulators because
 

1615
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:35,750
would get in the simulators because
unlike

1616
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:35,760
unlike
 

1617
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,350
unlike
normally people think terrain following

1618
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:37,360
normally people think terrain following
 

1619
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,269
normally people think terrain following
and there's the radars the 111 the b1

1620
00:25:39,269 --> 00:25:39,279
and there's the radars the 111 the b1
 

1621
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:40,950
and there's the radars the 111 the b1
has a system like this but it'll

1622
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:40,960
has a system like this but it'll
 

1623
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,390
has a system like this but it'll
the radar can see and it'll fly it

1624
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:42,400
the radar can see and it'll fly it
 

1625
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,669
the radar can see and it'll fly it
basically flies a straight line so it

1626
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:43,679
basically flies a straight line so it
 

1627
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,190
basically flies a straight line so it
goes up and over mountains and back down

1628
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:45,200
goes up and over mountains and back down
 

1629
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,269
goes up and over mountains and back down
and up and over mountains where the a6

1630
00:25:47,269 --> 00:25:47,279
and up and over mountains where the a6
 

1631
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,149
and up and over mountains where the a6
was really manual so you do this

1632
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:50,159
was really manual so you do this
 

1633
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:51,350
was really manual so you do this
low-level routes where you're gonna

1634
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:51,360
low-level routes where you're gonna
 

1635
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,470
low-level routes where you're gonna
you're gonna fly in the mountains at

1636
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:52,480
you're gonna fly in the mountains at
 

1637
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,350
you're gonna fly in the mountains at
night you're gonna be at

1638
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:53,360
night you're gonna be at
 

1639
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,110
night you're gonna be at
you know 500 to 1000 feet above the

1640
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:55,120
you know 500 to 1000 feet above the
 

1641
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,029
you know 500 to 1000 feet above the
ground ripping through

ground ripping through
 

1643
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,110
ground ripping through
like fog layers because you don't need

1644
00:25:59,110 --> 00:25:59,120
like fog layers because you don't need
 

1645
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,390
like fog layers because you don't need
to see outside you're

1646
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:00,400
to see outside you're
 

1647
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,990
to see outside you're
you're literally flying a little tv

1648
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:02,000
you're literally flying a little tv
 

1649
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,510
you're literally flying a little tv
screen and a radar what are you looking

1650
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:03,520
screen and a radar what are you looking
 

1651
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,029
screen and a radar what are you looking
at most of the time so you just as a

1652
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:05,039
at most of the time so you just as a
 

1653
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,310
at most of the time so you just as a
screen it's this really

1654
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:06,320
screen it's this really
 

1655
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,110
screen it's this really
primitive if you look at it now what we

1656
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:09,120
primitive if you look at it now what we
 

1657
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,630
primitive if you look at it now what we
did you'd think wow that was crazy

1658
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:10,640
did you'd think wow that was crazy
 

1659
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,470
did you'd think wow that was crazy
but it was really fun so is it similar

1660
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:12,480
but it was really fun so is it similar
 

1661
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,990
but it was really fun so is it similar
to like the flair stuff

1662
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:14,000
to like the flair stuff
 

1663
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,470
to like the flair stuff
is that is no are you is it this thing

1664
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:16,480
is that is no are you is it this thing
 

1665
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,230
is that is no are you is it this thing
is totally radar based now the airplane

1666
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:18,240
is totally radar based now the airplane
 

1667
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,110
is totally radar based now the airplane
had a flear ball

1668
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:19,120
had a flear ball
 

1669
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,630
had a flear ball
it's a target recognition and

1670
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:20,640
it's a target recognition and
 

1671
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,630
it's a target recognition and
multi-sensor it's called a tram

1672
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:22,640
multi-sensor it's called a tram
 

1673
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,669
multi-sensor it's called a tram
um you're looking at like basically like

1674
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:25,679
um you're looking at like basically like
 

1675
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,230
um you're looking at like basically like
dots of hard objects no actually what it

1676
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:28,240
dots of hard objects no actually what it
 

1677
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:28,870
dots of hard objects no actually what it
is is the

1678
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:28,880
is is the
 

1679
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,950
is is the
the bombardier navigator had a radar and

1680
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:30,960
the bombardier navigator had a radar and
 

1681
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,549
the bombardier navigator had a radar and
he was getting raw feed off of a pulse

1682
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:32,559
he was getting raw feed off of a pulse
 

1683
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:33,669
he was getting raw feed off of a pulse
radar in front

1684
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:33,679
radar in front
 

1685
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,430
radar in front
okay so it's just basically mapping the

1686
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:35,440
okay so it's just basically mapping the
 

1687
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,350
okay so it's just basically mapping the
mountain so if you look at a mountain on

1688
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:37,360
mountain so if you look at a mountain on
 

1689
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,029
mountain so if you look at a mountain on
a radar and you're coming up on it

1690
00:26:39,029 --> 00:26:39,039
a radar and you're coming up on it
 

1691
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,230
a radar and you're coming up on it
the front side is going to be it's going

1692
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:40,240
the front side is going to be it's going
 

1693
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,830
the front side is going to be it's going
to give you a really bright return and

1694
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:41,840
to give you a really bright return and
 

1695
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,350
to give you a really bright return and
on the back side it's just going to be a

1696
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:43,360
on the back side it's just going to be a
 

1697
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,390
on the back side it's just going to be a
giant shadow

1698
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:44,400
giant shadow
 

1699
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,510
giant shadow
because you can't see on the other side

1700
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:47,520
because you can't see on the other side
 

1701
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,029
because you can't see on the other side
so the bomb of your navigators would do

1702
00:26:49,029 --> 00:26:49,039
so the bomb of your navigators would do
 

1703
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,310
so the bomb of your navigators would do
that and we they would have charts and

1704
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:50,320
that and we they would have charts and
 

1705
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:50,870
that and we they would have charts and
they could

1706
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:50,880
they could
 

1707
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,390
they could
shade their charts knowing that hey if

1708
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:52,400
shade their charts knowing that hey if
 

1709
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,669
shade their charts knowing that hey if
we turn a little bit left here we can

1710
00:26:53,669 --> 00:26:53,679
we turn a little bit left here we can
 

1711
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,269
we turn a little bit left here we can
get in this valley we can sneak up this

1712
00:26:55,269 --> 00:26:55,279
get in this valley we can sneak up this
 

1713
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,549
get in this valley we can sneak up this
valley and then go around the back side

1714
00:26:56,549 --> 00:26:56,559
valley and then go around the back side
 

1715
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:57,269
valley and then go around the back side
of the mountain

1716
00:26:57,269 --> 00:26:57,279
of the mountain
 

1717
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,269
of the mountain
which is what the airplane would do and

1718
00:26:59,269 --> 00:26:59,279
which is what the airplane would do and
 

1719
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,549
which is what the airplane would do and
so and sorry to interrupt

1720
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:00,559
so and sorry to interrupt
 

1721
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,070
so and sorry to interrupt
i'm going to just keep asking dumb

1722
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:02,080
i'm going to just keep asking dumb
 

1723
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,669
i'm going to just keep asking dumb
questions i apologize but

1724
00:27:03,669 --> 00:27:03,679
questions i apologize but
 

1725
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,909
questions i apologize but
the pilot can you can you at a high

1726
00:27:05,909 --> 00:27:05,919
the pilot can you can you at a high
 

1727
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:06,789
the pilot can you can you at a high
level say

1728
00:27:06,789 --> 00:27:06,799
level say
 

1729
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,789
level say
what the pilot does versus the bomb

1730
00:27:08,789 --> 00:27:08,799
what the pilot does versus the bomb
 

1731
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,549
what the pilot does versus the bomb
bombardier uh

1732
00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:10,559
bombardier uh
 

1733
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,950
bombardier uh
so you're you're actually just control

1734
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:12,960
so you're you're actually just control
 

1735
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,789
so you're you're actually just control
i'm flying the jet i have the throttles

1736
00:27:14,789 --> 00:27:14,799
i'm flying the jet i have the throttles
 

1737
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:15,909
i'm flying the jet i have the throttles
the stick and i have a

1738
00:27:15,909 --> 00:27:15,919
the stick and i have a
 

1739
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,110
the stick and i have a
uh it's about a probably a

1740
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:19,120
uh it's about a probably a
 

1741
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,110
uh it's about a probably a
four inch or six inch wide by maybe

1742
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:23,120
four inch or six inch wide by maybe
 

1743
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,710
four inch or six inch wide by maybe
four inches five inches high it looks

1744
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:24,720
four inches five inches high it looks
 

1745
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,630
four inches five inches high it looks
like it's literally a crt

1746
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:26,640
like it's literally a crt
 

1747
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,029
like it's literally a crt
that's how old it is a crt screen and

1748
00:27:29,029 --> 00:27:29,039
that's how old it is a crt screen and
 

1749
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,710
that's how old it is a crt screen and
what it would do what the radar would do

1750
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:30,720
what it would do what the radar would do
 

1751
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,029
what it would do what the radar would do
is

1752
00:27:31,029 --> 00:27:31,039
is
 

1753
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,190
is
the the the bombardier navigator is

1754
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:33,200
the the the bombardier navigator is
 

1755
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,549
the the the bombardier navigator is
looking at his radar and he's looking

1756
00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:34,559
looking at his radar and he's looking
 

1757
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,990
looking at his radar and he's looking
out about 12 and a half miles in front

1758
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:36,000
out about 12 and a half miles in front
 

1759
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,029
out about 12 and a half miles in front
of the airplane

1760
00:27:37,029 --> 00:27:37,039
of the airplane
 

1761
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,789
of the airplane
so he has the range really scoped down

1762
00:27:38,789 --> 00:27:38,799
so he has the range really scoped down
 

1763
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,230
so he has the range really scoped down
because the radar can see a lot further

1764
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:40,240
because the radar can see a lot further
 

1765
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,430
because the radar can see a lot further
he's looking at about 12 and a half

1766
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:41,440
he's looking at about 12 and a half
 

1767
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,029
he's looking at about 12 and a half
miles when we're in the terrain mode

1768
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:43,039
miles when we're in the terrain mode
 

1769
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,110
miles when we're in the terrain mode
where we're dodging mountains and stuff

1770
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:45,120
where we're dodging mountains and stuff
 

1771
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,549
where we're dodging mountains and stuff
and what the pilot has is there's

1772
00:27:46,549 --> 00:27:46,559
and what the pilot has is there's
 

1773
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:47,990
and what the pilot has is there's
they're called range bins and there's

1774
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:48,000
they're called range bins and there's
 

1775
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,190
they're called range bins and there's
eight of them

1776
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:49,200
eight of them
 

1777
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,430
eight of them
so the very far range bin is the 12 and

1778
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:51,440
so the very far range bin is the 12 and
 

1779
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,389
so the very far range bin is the 12 and
a half mile

1780
00:27:52,389 --> 00:27:52,399
a half mile
 

1781
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:55,510
a half mile
you know and the closest range been it's

1782
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:55,520
you know and the closest range been it's
 

1783
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,269
you know and the closest range been it's
a thing and it'll be like between like a

1784
00:27:57,269 --> 00:27:57,279
a thing and it'll be like between like a
 

1785
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,230
a thing and it'll be like between like a
half a mile

1786
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:58,240
half a mile
 

1787
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,110
half a mile
and or a quarter mile to three quarters

1788
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:01,120
and or a quarter mile to three quarters
 

1789
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,389
and or a quarter mile to three quarters
of a mile the next one might be three

1790
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:02,399
of a mile the next one might be three
 

1791
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,470
of a mile the next one might be three
quarters of a mile to two miles

1792
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:04,480
quarters of a mile to two miles
 

1793
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,909
quarters of a mile to two miles
and then it just keeps going out like

1794
00:28:05,909 --> 00:28:05,919
and then it just keeps going out like
 

1795
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,909
and then it just keeps going out like
that so if there's a mountain for let's

1796
00:28:07,909 --> 00:28:07,919
that so if there's a mountain for let's
 

1797
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,590
that so if there's a mountain for let's
say we're on a flat plain

1798
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:09,600
say we're on a flat plain
 

1799
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,190
say we're on a flat plain
and there's a mountain out in the

1800
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:11,200
and there's a mountain out in the
 

1801
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,269
and there's a mountain out in the
distance at 15 miles and we we're just

1802
00:28:13,269 --> 00:28:13,279
distance at 15 miles and we we're just
 

1803
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,710
distance at 15 miles and we we're just
driving right at it

1804
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:14,720
driving right at it
 

1805
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,389
driving right at it
so when we get to the point where it

1806
00:28:16,389 --> 00:28:16,399
so when we get to the point where it
 

1807
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,070
so when we get to the point where it
hits 12 and a half miles where the radar

1808
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:18,080
hits 12 and a half miles where the radar
 

1809
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,070
hits 12 and a half miles where the radar
is going to see it on his scope

1810
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:20,080
is going to see it on his scope
 

1811
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,549
is going to see it on his scope
my 12th my range bin for that would pop

1812
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:22,559
my 12th my range bin for that would pop
 

1813
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,070
my 12th my range bin for that would pop
up and it would show like a big bump

1814
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:24,080
up and it would show like a big bump
 

1815
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,350
up and it would show like a big bump
like a mountain

1816
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:25,360
like a mountain
 

1817
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,430
like a mountain
and then as i got closer to it the next

1818
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:27,440
and then as i got closer to it the next
 

1819
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,269
and then as i got closer to it the next
arrangement would pop up and show it

1820
00:28:29,269 --> 00:28:29,279
arrangement would pop up and show it
 

1821
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,630
arrangement would pop up and show it
and i could see that that bump was

1822
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:30,640
and i could see that that bump was
 

1823
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,029
and i could see that that bump was
moving towards me and then if i turned a

1824
00:28:33,029 --> 00:28:33,039
moving towards me and then if i turned a
 

1825
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:33,990
moving towards me and then if i turned a
little bit

1826
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:34,000
little bit
 

1827
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,669
little bit
you know to go over here i'd see the

1828
00:28:35,669 --> 00:28:35,679
you know to go over here i'd see the
 

1829
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,830
you know to go over here i'd see the
mountain go over to the right hand side

1830
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:37,840
mountain go over to the right hand side
 

1831
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,389
mountain go over to the right hand side
and i could do that but it wasn't like a

1832
00:28:40,389 --> 00:28:40,399
and i could do that but it wasn't like a
 

1833
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,389
and i could do that but it wasn't like a
video game it was it's literally like

1834
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:42,399
video game it was it's literally like
 

1835
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:45,029
video game it was it's literally like
if you think of the original ataris yeah

1836
00:28:45,029 --> 00:28:45,039
if you think of the original ataris yeah
 

1837
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,110
if you think of the original ataris yeah
but you build up i imagine

1838
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:47,120
but you build up i imagine
 

1839
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,830
but you build up i imagine
that you start to get uh a really deep

1840
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:49,840
that you start to get uh a really deep
 

1841
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,389
that you start to get uh a really deep
sense

1842
00:28:50,389 --> 00:28:50,399
sense
 

1843
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:54,070
sense
of like the actual three 3d environment

1844
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:54,080
of like the actual three 3d environment
 

1845
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,470
of like the actual three 3d environment
based on that little atari's it's solid

1846
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:56,480
based on that little atari's it's solid
 

1847
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,230
based on that little atari's it's solid
you're exactly right and you have to

1848
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:58,240
you're exactly right and you have to
 

1849
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,510
you're exactly right and you have to
you have to train so there's been

1850
00:28:59,510 --> 00:28:59,520
you have to train so there's been
 

1851
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,510
you have to train so there's been
studies a matter of fact a lot of the

1852
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:01,520
studies a matter of fact a lot of the
 

1853
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,149
studies a matter of fact a lot of the
basis

1854
00:29:02,149 --> 00:29:02,159
basis
 

1855
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,510
basis
and people probably argue with me but

1856
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:03,520
and people probably argue with me but
 

1857
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,430
and people probably argue with me but
it's true there were studies done

1858
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:05,440
it's true there were studies done
 

1859
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,669
it's true there were studies done
watching asics crews in our simulators

1860
00:29:07,669 --> 00:29:07,679
watching asics crews in our simulators
 

1861
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:08,710
watching asics crews in our simulators
we called it the wist

1862
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:08,720
we called it the wist
 

1863
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,789
we called it the wist
the weapon systems trainer and it was

1864
00:29:10,789 --> 00:29:10,799
the weapon systems trainer and it was
 

1865
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,389
the weapon systems trainer and it was
not even a motion it just kind of sat

1866
00:29:12,389 --> 00:29:12,399
not even a motion it just kind of sat
 

1867
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:12,950
not even a motion it just kind of sat
there and

1868
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:12,960
there and
 

1869
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,470
there and
you just you could fly these things they

1870
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:14,480
you just you could fly these things they
 

1871
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,070
you just you could fly these things they
had terrain that they would inject into

1872
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:16,080
had terrain that they would inject into
 

1873
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,190
had terrain that they would inject into
the system

1874
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:17,200
the system
 

1875
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,190
the system
uh but the crew coordination so you get

1876
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:19,200
uh but the crew coordination so you get
 

1877
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,470
uh but the crew coordination so you get
so my first

1878
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:20,480
so my first
 

1879
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,430
so my first
uh my first fleet bombardier navigator

1880
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:23,440
uh my first fleet bombardier navigator
 

1881
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,310
uh my first fleet bombardier navigator
who who

i think computer engineering he's scary

1892
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:35,600
i think computer engineering he's scary
 

1893
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,470
i think computer engineering he's scary
smart

smart
so chris could really work and matter of

1896
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:39,440
so chris could really work and matter of
 

1897
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,470
so chris could really work and matter of
fact all the guys that flew us so

1898
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:40,480
fact all the guys that flew us so
 

1899
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,750
fact all the guys that flew us so
there's another guy matt who also worked

1900
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:41,760
there's another guy matt who also worked
 

1901
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,510
there's another guy matt who also worked
at apple who's now at sap we did our

1902
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:43,520
at apple who's now at sap we did our
 

1903
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,870
at apple who's now at sap we did our
first night traps together

1904
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:44,880
first night traps together
 

1905
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,630
first night traps together
the bond between us i mean it's one of

1906
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:46,640
the bond between us i mean it's one of
 

1907
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,149
the bond between us i mean it's one of
those things that you just you're never

1908
00:29:48,149 --> 00:29:48,159
those things that you just you're never
 

1909
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:49,510
those things that you just you're never
going to forget but chris and i when we

1910
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:49,520
going to forget but chris and i when we
 

1911
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,789
going to forget but chris and i when we
started flying together we were actually

1912
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:50,799
started flying together we were actually
 

1913
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,710
started flying together we were actually
the most junior crew

1914
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:52,720
the most junior crew
 

1915
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,990
the most junior crew
in the squadron uh we'd spent a lot of

1916
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:56,000
in the squadron uh we'd spent a lot of
 

1917
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,310
in the squadron uh we'd spent a lot of

training and and and chris was amazing

1920
00:29:58,950 --> 00:29:58,960
training and and and chris was amazing
 

1921
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,630
training and and and chris was amazing
at how he could work the system

1922
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:00,640
at how he could work the system
 

1923
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,950
at how he could work the system
uh one because he was extremely

1924
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:02,960
uh one because he was extremely
 

1925
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,990
uh one because he was extremely
brilliant and he was

1926
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:04,000
brilliant and he was
 

1927
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,590
brilliant and he was
had that inquisitive mind of oh we could

1928
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:05,600
had that inquisitive mind of oh we could
 

1929
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,789
had that inquisitive mind of oh we could
do all these different things and

1930
00:30:06,789 --> 00:30:06,799
do all these different things and
 

1931
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:07,590
do all these different things and
there's all these

1932
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:07,600
there's all these
 

1933
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,950
there's all these
degradation modes but we spent a lot of

1934
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:10,960
degradation modes but we spent a lot of
 

1935
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,590
degradation modes but we spent a lot of
time

1936
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:11,600
time
 

1937
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,990
time
to see how good we could actually get

1938
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:14,000
to see how good we could actually get
 

1939
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,110
to see how good we could actually get
because and it's

1940
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:15,120
because and it's
 

1941
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,149
because and it's
you almost talk in partial so as the bn

1942
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:18,159
you almost talk in partial so as the bn
 

1943
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:19,669
you almost talk in partial so as the bn
is looking at his radar scope

00:30:19,669 --> 00:30:19,679
is looking at his radar scope
 

1945
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,549
is looking at his radar scope
chris would say i've got rising terrain

1946
00:30:22,549 --> 00:30:22,559
chris would say i've got rising terrain
 

1947
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:23,750
chris would say i've got rising terrain
that's just what they say

1948
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:23,760
that's just what they say
 

1949
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,590
that's just what they say
showing rising terrain at 12 miles and

1950
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:25,600
showing rising terrain at 12 miles and
 

1951
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,950
showing rising terrain at 12 miles and
i'd see the little bump and i'd say

1952
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:26,960
i'd see the little bump and i'd say
 

1953
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,430
i'd see the little bump and i'd say
got it this is going to go to your

1954
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:29,440
got it this is going to go to your
 

1955
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,789
got it this is going to go to your
question on the autonomy and how you

1956
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:30,799
question on the autonomy and how you
 

1957
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:31,750
question on the autonomy and how you
work with two heads

1958
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:31,760
work with two heads
 

1959
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,230
work with two heads
yes so when you first get together the

1960
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:34,240
yes so when you first get together the
 

1961
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,269
yes so when you first get together the
interaction it's

1962
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:35,279
interaction it's
 

1963
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,750
interaction it's
it's it's almost like you have to

1964
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:37,760
it's it's almost like you have to
 

1965
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,350
it's it's almost like you have to
rehearse it you have to know

1966
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:39,360
rehearse it you have to know
 

1967
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,630
rehearse it you have to know
and you talk in full senses the more and

1968
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:42,640
and you talk in full senses the more and
 

1969
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,110
and you talk in full senses the more and
more

1970
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:43,120
more
 

1971
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,830
more
we fly together chris could go

1972
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:47,840
we fly together chris could go
 

1973
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,789
we fly together chris could go
i'm showing and he'd get like rising out

1974
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:50,799
i'm showing and he'd get like rising out
 

1975
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,630
i'm showing and he'd get like rising out
and before he finished i'd say i've got

1976
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:52,640
and before he finished i'd say i've got
 

1977
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,029
and before he finished i'd say i've got
it

1978
00:30:53,029 --> 00:30:53,039
it
 

1979
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,470
it
so you end up starting to talk in

1980
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:54,480
so you end up starting to talk in
 

1981
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,310
so you end up starting to talk in
partials because

1982
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:56,320
partials because
 

1983
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,070
partials because
i have to trust him like

1984
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:00,080
i have to trust him like
 

1985
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,990
i have to trust him like
i mean there can be no i can have no

1986
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:02,000
i mean there can be no i can have no
 

1987
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,389
i mean there can be no i can have no
doubt that he knows how to do his job

1988
00:31:04,389 --> 00:31:04,399
doubt that he knows how to do his job
 

1989
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:05,909
doubt that he knows how to do his job
because i'm literally looking at this

1990
00:31:05,909 --> 00:31:05,919
because i'm literally looking at this
 

1991
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:07,590
because i'm literally looking at this
little scope that's not giving me this

1992
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:07,600
little scope that's not giving me this
 

1993
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,029
little scope that's not giving me this
continuous picture of that mountain

1994
00:31:09,029 --> 00:31:09,039
continuous picture of that mountain
 

1995
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,630
continuous picture of that mountain
moving remember the mountain's here

1996
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:10,640
moving remember the mountain's here
 

1997
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,070
moving remember the mountain's here
and then it's going to pop up here and

1998
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:12,080
and then it's going to pop up here and
 

1999
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,750
and then it's going to pop up here and
then it's going to pop up here because

2000
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:13,760
then it's going to pop up here because
 

2001
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,350
then it's going to pop up here because
there's gaps in the coverage on how the

2002
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:15,360
there's gaps in the coverage on how the
 

2003
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,630
there's gaps in the coverage on how the
system was set up remember it's an

2004
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:16,640
system was set up remember it's an
 

2005
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,990
system was set up remember it's an
analog system

2006
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:18,000
analog system
 

2007
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,149
analog system
to where he is telling me like i can't

2008
00:31:20,149 --> 00:31:20,159
to where he is telling me like i can't
 

2009
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:21,669
to where he is telling me like i can't
see all the way to the left and he

2010
00:31:21,669 --> 00:31:21,679
see all the way to the left and he
 

2011
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,350
see all the way to the left and he
he's got a wider scope on the radar but

2012
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:23,360
he's got a wider scope on the radar but
 

2013
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,430
he's got a wider scope on the radar but
my screen doesn't show that

2014
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:25,440
my screen doesn't show that
 

2015
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,669
my screen doesn't show that
so he's telling me start a left turn how

2016
00:31:27,669 --> 00:31:27,679
so he's telling me start a left turn how
 

2017
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,509
so he's telling me start a left turn how
to avoid a hard turn

2018
00:31:29,509 --> 00:31:29,519
to avoid a hard turn
 

2019
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,110
to avoid a hard turn
you know and we would do that so my

2020
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:31,120
you know and we would do that so my
 

2021
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,710
you know and we would do that so my
channel this is all happening quick

2022
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:32,720
channel this is all happening quick
 

2023
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,710
channel this is all happening quick
very quick well you're doing we we would

2024
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:34,720
very quick well you're doing we we would
 

2025
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,230
very quick well you're doing we we would
typically fly between 420 and 480 knots

okay or eight months between seven and
 

2033
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,149
okay or eight months between seven and
eight miles a minute is what you're

00:31:46,149 --> 00:31:46,159
eight miles a minute is what you're
 

2035
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:47,350
eight miles a minute is what you're
flying as fast

2036
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:47,360
flying as fast
 

2037
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,269
flying as fast
at night i mean i broke out of clouds i

2038
00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:49,279
at night i mean i broke out of clouds i
 

2039
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,029
at night i mean i broke out of clouds i
mean i remember him and i flying

00:31:51,029 --> 00:31:51,039
mean i remember him and i flying
 

2041
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,430
mean i remember him and i flying
we're on it's the ir it's called an ir

00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:53,440
we're on it's the ir it's called an ir
 

2043

we're on it's the ir it's called an ir
route uh an

00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:54,320
route uh an
 

2045
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,990
route uh an
instrument route that's low they're all

instrument route that's low they're all
 

2047
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,470
instrument route that's low they're all
around the country there's ir344 that we

2048
00:31:58,470 --> 00:31:58,480
around the country there's ir344 that we
 

2049
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,230
around the country there's ir344 that we
used to fly which would coast in off of

00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:00,240
used to fly which would coast in off of
 

2051
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,750
used to fly which would coast in off of
or you'd fly from the land you go out

2052
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:01,760
or you'd fly from the land you go out
 

2053
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,029
or you'd fly from the land you go out
over the ocean turn around and then you

2054
00:32:03,029 --> 00:32:03,039
over the ocean turn around and then you
 

2055
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,470
over the ocean turn around and then you
could practice actually coming in on a

2056
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:04,480
could practice actually coming in on a
 

2057
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,669
could practice actually coming in on a
coastline

2058
00:32:05,669 --> 00:32:05,679
coastline
 

2059
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,029
coastline
and we were flying and we ended up in

2060
00:32:09,029 --> 00:32:09,039
and we were flying and we ended up in
 

2061
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,070
and we were flying and we ended up in
the clouds

2062
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:10,080
the clouds
 

2063
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,990
the clouds
keep in mind we're between 500 and 1000

2064
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:12,000
keep in mind we're between 500 and 1000
 

2065
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,190
keep in mind we're between 500 and 1000
feet in the mountains and we're in the

2066
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:13,200
feet in the mountains and we're in the
 

2067
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:13,669
feet in the mountains and we're in the
clouds like

2068
00:32:13,669 --> 00:32:13,679
clouds like
 

2069
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,110
clouds like
you can't see anything and it had to

2070
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:15,120
you can't see anything and it had to
 

2071
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,710
you can't see anything and it had to
turn off our red lights that flash you

2072
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:16,720
turn off our red lights that flash you
 

2073
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,909
turn off our red lights that flash you
know they're called the anti-collision

2074
00:32:17,909 --> 00:32:17,919
know they're called the anti-collision
 

2075
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:18,710
know they're called the anti-collision
lights

2076
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:18,720
lights
 

2077
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,389
lights
because it was reflecting off the clouds

2078
00:32:20,389 --> 00:32:20,399
because it was reflecting off the clouds
 

2079
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:21,909
because it was reflecting off the clouds
and it starts to bother you just gets

2080
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:21,919
and it starts to bother you just gets
 

2081
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:23,669
and it starts to bother you just gets
annoying

2082
00:32:23,669 --> 00:32:23,679
annoying
 

2083
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,669
annoying
so i turned it off and we we're flying

2084
00:32:25,669 --> 00:32:25,679
so i turned it off and we we're flying
 

2085
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,110
so i turned it off and we we're flying
we're flying we're flying we break out

2086
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:27,120
we're flying we're flying we break out
 

2087
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,870
we're flying we're flying we break out
of that coastal marine layer

2088
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:28,880
of that coastal marine layer
 

2089
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,509
of that coastal marine layer
and poof we break out and it's it's a

2090
00:32:31,509 --> 00:32:31,519
and poof we break out and it's it's a
 

2091
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:32,789
and poof we break out and it's it's a
decent night and this is right by mount

2092
00:32:32,789 --> 00:32:32,799
decent night and this is right by mount
 

2093
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:33,029
decent night and this is right by mount
st

2094
00:32:33,029 --> 00:32:33,039
st
 

2095
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,070
st
helens this is kind of where we're

2096
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:34,080
helens this is kind of where we're
 

2097
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,190
helens this is kind of where we're
coming in so we're coming in from the

2098
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:35,200
coming in so we're coming in from the
 

2099
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,630
coming in so we're coming in from the
east and we're just north of mount st

2100
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:36,640
east and we're just north of mount st
 

2101
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,230
east and we're just north of mount st
helens is where the route goes

2102
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:38,240
helens is where the route goes
 

2103
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,509
helens is where the route goes
and you look up you know because you can

2104
00:32:39,509 --> 00:32:39,519
and you look up you know because you can
 

2105
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:40,710
and you look up you know because you can
kind of see the silhouette of this

2106
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:40,720
kind of see the silhouette of this
 

2107
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,909
kind of see the silhouette of this
mountain that's right next to you but

2108
00:32:41,909 --> 00:32:41,919
mountain that's right next to you but
 

2109
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,350
mountain that's right next to you but
you're flying along you're just like you

2110
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:43,360
you're flying along you're just like you
 

2111
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,710
you're flying along you're just like you
know you gotta trust

2112
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:44,720
know you gotta trust
 

2113
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,310
know you gotta trust
and you can see houses you can see the

2114
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:46,320
and you can see houses you can see the
 

2115
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,590
and you can see houses you can see the
lights they're above you we're literally

2116
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:47,600
lights they're above you we're literally
 

2117
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,350
lights they're above you we're literally
below people's houses flying down these

2118
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:49,360
below people's houses flying down these
 

2119
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,870
below people's houses flying down these
valleys and stuff so just

2120
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:50,880
valleys and stuff so just
 

2121
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,789
valleys and stuff so just
incredible experience so when you take

2122
00:32:52,789 --> 00:32:52,799
incredible experience so when you take
 

2123
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,389
incredible experience so when you take
that and then you move into

2124
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:54,399
that and then you move into
 

2125
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:57,029
that and then you move into
an f-18f so now we're into modern

2126
00:32:57,029 --> 00:32:57,039
an f-18f so now we're into modern
 

2127
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,389
an f-18f so now we're into modern
technology that was actually built in

2128
00:32:58,389 --> 00:32:58,399
technology that was actually built in
 

2129
00:32:58,399 --> 00:32:59,750
technology that was actually built in
this century

2130
00:32:59,750 --> 00:32:59,760
this century
 

2131
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,950
this century
uh uh and you're flying so now you know

2132
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:02,960
uh uh and you're flying so now you know
 

2133
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,310
uh uh and you're flying so now you know
the wizzo is behind us and we're not

2134
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:04,320
the wizzo is behind us and we're not
 

2135
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,669
the wizzo is behind us and we're not
doing those night low levels but that

2136
00:33:05,669 --> 00:33:05,679
doing those night low levels but that
 

2137
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:07,830
doing those night low levels but that
same type of crew coordination

2138
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:07,840
same type of crew coordination
 

2139
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,630
same type of crew coordination
that has to happen because what you're

2140
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:10,640
that has to happen because what you're
 

2141
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,509
that has to happen because what you're
doing is

2142
00:33:11,509 --> 00:33:11,519
doing is
 

2143
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,669
doing is
you're sharing the load so most of the

2144
00:33:13,669 --> 00:33:13,679
you're sharing the load so most of the
 

2145
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:14,950
you're sharing the load so most of the
communications that go out of the

2146
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:14,960
communications that go out of the
 

2147
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,470
communications that go out of the
airplane the wizzo does all the talk and

2148
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:16,480
airplane the wizzo does all the talk and
 

2149
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,070
airplane the wizzo does all the talk and
he's got actually he uses

2150
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:18,080
he's got actually he uses
 

2151
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,350
he's got actually he uses
the feet that's the weapon systems

2152
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:19,360
the feet that's the weapon systems
 

2153
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,669
the feet that's the weapon systems
operator in the back of an f-18f

2154
00:33:21,669 --> 00:33:21,679
operator in the back of an f-18f
 

2155
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,070
operator in the back of an f-18f
so he's going to run well the radar kind

2156
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:24,080
so he's going to run well the radar kind
 

2157
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,430
so he's going to run well the radar kind
of runs itself now

2158
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:25,440
of runs itself now
 

2159
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,190
of runs itself now
but we have a situational awareness

2160
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:27,200
but we have a situational awareness
 

2161
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,110
but we have a situational awareness
display and it's it's linked to all the

2162
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:29,120
display and it's it's linked to all the
 

2163
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,389
display and it's it's linked to all the
other errors just like curiosity what's

2164
00:33:30,389 --> 00:33:30,399
other errors just like curiosity what's
 

2165
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:31,990
other errors just like curiosity what's
the situational awareness display

2166
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:32,000
the situational awareness display
 

2167
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,269
the situational awareness display
because that term comes up a lot think

2168
00:33:33,269 --> 00:33:33,279
because that term comes up a lot think
 

2169
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,110
because that term comes up a lot think
of it as uh think of it as a god's eye

2170
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:35,120
of it as uh think of it as a god's eye
 

2171
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:35,669
of it as uh think of it as a god's eye
view

2172

view
 

2173
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:37,509
view
so if you have a the back of the super

2174
00:33:37,509 --> 00:33:37,519
so if you have a the back of the super
 

2175
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,509
so if you have a the back of the super
hornet has well the block twos has about

00:33:39,509 --> 00:33:39,519
hornet has well the block twos has about
 

2177
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,070
hornet has well the block twos has about
an eight by ten display for the wizzos

2178
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:42,080
an eight by ten display for the wizzos
 

2179
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,830
an eight by ten display for the wizzos
um that they can look at the pilots is

2180
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:43,840
um that they can look at the pilots is
 

2181
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,190
um that they can look at the pilots is
smaller it's down between us it's a six

2182
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:45,200
smaller it's down between us it's a six
 

2183
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,029
smaller it's down between us it's a six
by six between his legs and they're

00:33:47,029 --> 00:33:47,039
by six between his legs and they're
 

2185
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:48,870
by six between his legs and they're
they're getting ready to redesign that

2186
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:48,880
they're getting ready to redesign that
 

2187
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,070
they're getting ready to redesign that
boeing is but

00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:50,080
boeing is but
 

2189
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,990
boeing is but
when you look it'd be like if you put

00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:52,000
when you look it'd be like if you put
 

2191
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,070
when you look it'd be like if you put
your airplane and you're looking down so

00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:54,080
your airplane and you're looking down so
 

2193
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,669
your airplane and you're looking down so
all the stuff like if your radar seeing

00:33:55,669 --> 00:33:55,679
all the stuff like if your radar seeing
 

2195
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:56,950
all the stuff like if your radar seeing
bad guys out in front of you be like

2196
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:56,960
bad guys out in front of you be like
 

2197

looking down going oh i'm right here and
 

2199
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,149
looking down going oh i'm right here and
now there's bad guys out here

2200
00:34:00,149 --> 00:34:00,159
now there's bad guys out here
 

2201
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:01,990
now there's bad guys out here
and my wingman is over here and it shows

2202
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:02,000
and my wingman is over here and it shows
 

2203
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,190

i can see where everything's at i can
 

2211
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,869
i can see where everything's at i can
see if one guy's trying to target

2212
00:34:08,869 --> 00:34:08,879
see if one guy's trying to target

it shows you all this it's an incredible
 

2217
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,510
it shows you all this it's an incredible
amount of knowledge that comes up

amount of knowledge that comes up
 

2219
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,829
amount of knowledge that comes up
for the crews to maintain uh

2225
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,349
on big picture sense of what's going on
because it's happening so fast

2226
00:34:23,349 --> 00:34:23,359
because it's happening so fast
 

2227
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:24,710
because it's happening so fast
and this is with that autonomy piece

2228
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:24,720
and this is with that autonomy piece
 

2229
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,710
and this is with that autonomy piece
this is the third brain so we're all

2230
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:26,720
this is the third brain so we're all
 

2231
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,149
this is the third brain so we're all
looking at it and the third brain is

2232
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:28,159
looking at it and the third brain is
 

2233
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:29,270
looking at it and the third brain is
doing fusion

2234
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:29,280
doing fusion
 

2235
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,710
doing fusion
it's pulling stuff together going oh

2236
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:30,720
it's pulling stuff together going oh
 

2237
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,990
it's pulling stuff together going oh
this is all this guy this is this guy

2238
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:32,000
this is all this guy this is this guy
 

2239
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,349
this is all this guy this is this guy
this this guy it's sending it out

2240
00:34:33,349 --> 00:34:33,359
this this guy it's sending it out
 

2241
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:34,629
this this guy it's sending it out
through the link so all the airplanes

2242
00:34:34,629 --> 00:34:34,639
through the link so all the airplanes
 

2243
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,750
through the link so all the airplanes
are talking to each other through this

2244
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:35,760
are talking to each other through this
 

2245
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,109
are talking to each other through this
digital network

2246
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:37,119
digital network
 

2247
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:38,550
digital network
you know that we don't even see it just

2248
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:38,560
you know that we don't even see it just
 

2249
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,470
you know that we don't even see it just
says that airplane says hey i'm over

2250
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:40,480
says that airplane says hey i'm over
 

2251
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,310
says that airplane says hey i'm over
here and it tells us and we go oh he's

2252
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:42,320
here and it tells us and we go oh he's
 

2253
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,270
here and it tells us and we go oh he's
right there

2254
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:43,280
right there
 

2255
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,430
right there
and then we can go he's his airplane

2256
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:45,440
and then we can go he's his airplane
 

2257
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,109
and then we can go he's his airplane
says oh i'm looking at this airplane

2258
00:34:47,109 --> 00:34:47,119
says oh i'm looking at this airplane
 

2259
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,950
says oh i'm looking at this airplane
this bad guy and it shows us oh he's

2260
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:48,960
this bad guy and it shows us oh he's
 

2261
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,149
this bad guy and it shows us oh he's
he's over there and he's looking at this

2262
00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:50,159
he's over there and he's looking at this
 

2263
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,230
he's over there and he's looking at this
guy i mean it's an incredible

2264
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:52,240
guy i mean it's an incredible
 

2265
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,669
guy i mean it's an incredible
amount of uh visual intake because your

2266
00:34:55,669 --> 00:34:55,679
amount of uh visual intake because your
 

2267
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:56,230
amount of uh visual intake because your
eye

2268
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:56,240
eye
 

2269
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,510
eye
you can hear a lot but when you look

2270
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:57,520
you can hear a lot but when you look
 

2271
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,950
you can hear a lot but when you look
down at stuff it's uh you know you can

2272
00:34:58,950 --> 00:34:58,960
down at stuff it's uh you know you can
 

2273
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,750
down at stuff it's uh you know you can
solve the picture

2274
00:34:59,750 --> 00:34:59,760
solve the picture
 

2275
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,390
solve the picture
really quick the third brain is doing

2276
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:02,400
really quick the third brain is doing
 

2277
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,349
really quick the third brain is doing
the

2278
00:35:03,349 --> 00:35:03,359
the
 

2279
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:06,230
the
sensor fusion uh the integration of the

2280
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:06,240
sensor fusion uh the integration of the
 

2281
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,670
sensor fusion uh the integration of the
different sensors and gives you a big

2282
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:07,680
different sensors and gives you a big
 

2283
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,390
different sensors and gives you a big
picture view

2284
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:08,400
picture view
 

2285
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,030
picture view
what about the control like is there and

2286
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:11,040
what about the control like is there and
 

2287
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,910
what about the control like is there and
i apologize

2288
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:11,920
i apologize
 

2289
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,069
i apologize
as if this is a dumb question but you

2290
00:35:14,069 --> 00:35:14,079
as if this is a dumb question but you
 

2291
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,990
as if this is a dumb question but you
know people use the high level term

2292
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:16,000
know people use the high level term
 

2293
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,069
know people use the high level term
of autopilot how much is there

2294
00:35:20,069 --> 00:35:20,079
of autopilot how much is there
 

2295
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:22,950
of autopilot how much is there
let's use a loose term of ai how much

2296
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:22,960
let's use a loose term of ai how much
 

2297
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,030
let's use a loose term of ai how much
automation is there how much ai is there

2298
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:25,040
automation is there how much ai is there
 

2299
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:25,270
automation is there how much ai is there
in

2300
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:25,280
in
 

2301
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,829
in
helping you control there um the ai

2302
00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:27,839
helping you control there um the ai
 

2303
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,589
helping you control there um the ai
piece would be more of a control loop

2304
00:35:29,589 --> 00:35:29,599
piece would be more of a control loop
 

2305
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,510
piece would be more of a control loop
because the digital flight controls so

2306
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:31,520
because the digital flight controls so
 

2307
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,510
because the digital flight controls so
the airplane actually

2308
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:33,520
the airplane actually
 

2309
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,190
the airplane actually
they had to make the airplane easier to

2310
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:35,200
they had to make the airplane easier to
 

2311
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,190
they had to make the airplane easier to
fly and when i say easy it's relative

2312
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:37,200
fly and when i say easy it's relative
 

2313
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,390
fly and when i say easy it's relative
because people go i could do it because

2314
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:38,400
because people go i could do it because
 

2315
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,069
because people go i could do it because
i did it on flight sim

2316
00:35:40,069 --> 00:35:40,079
i did it on flight sim
 

2317
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,390
i did it on flight sim
it's real life is a lot different in

2318
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:42,400
it's real life is a lot different in
 

2319
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,750
it's real life is a lot different in
flight sim you have no apparent fear of

2320
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:43,760
flight sim you have no apparent fear of
 

2321
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,069
flight sim you have no apparent fear of
death

2322
00:35:44,069 --> 00:35:44,079
death
 

2323
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:45,589
death
you'll do things in simulator that you

2324
00:35:45,589 --> 00:35:45,599
you'll do things in simulator that you
 

2325
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,270
you'll do things in simulator that you
would never do in real life but

2326
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:47,280
would never do in real life but
 

2327
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,390
would never do in real life but
uh the the autonomy in the airplane to

2328
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:50,400
uh the the autonomy in the airplane to
 

2329
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,589
uh the the autonomy in the airplane to
allow you to manage

2330
00:35:51,589 --> 00:35:51,599
allow you to manage
 

2331
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:52,870
allow you to manage
i mean because you think about it you've

2332
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:52,880
i mean because you think about it you've
 

2333
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,510
i mean because you think about it you've
got a radar that's feeding you data

2334
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:55,520
got a radar that's feeding you data
 

2335
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,710
got a radar that's feeding you data
you've got a targeting pod that's

2336
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:56,720
you've got a targeting pod that's
 

2337
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,710
you've got a targeting pod that's
feeding you data all that stuff is

2338
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:58,720
feeding you data all that stuff is
 

2339
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,670
feeding you data all that stuff is
hooked to your head

2340
00:35:59,670 --> 00:35:59,680
hooked to your head
 

2341
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,790
hooked to your head
because you've got a joint helmet

2342
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:00,800
because you've got a joint helmet
 

2343
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,030
because you've got a joint helmet
mounted queuing system on that basically

2344
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:03,040
mounted queuing system on that basically
 

2345
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,710
mounted queuing system on that basically
maps the magnetic field in the cockpit

2346
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:04,720
maps the magnetic field in the cockpit
 

2347
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,829
maps the magnetic field in the cockpit
so it can tell where your heads at

2348
00:36:05,829 --> 00:36:05,839
so it can tell where your heads at
 

2349
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:06,790
so it can tell where your heads at
looking

2350
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:06,800
looking
 

2351
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,390
looking
so if i turn my head to the right the

2352
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:08,400
so if i turn my head to the right the
 

2353
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,670
so if i turn my head to the right the
radar will actually look to the right

2354
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:09,680
radar will actually look to the right
 

2355
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,950
radar will actually look to the right
the targeting flare will look to the

2356
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:10,960
the targeting flare will look to the
 

2357
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,510
the targeting flare will look to the
right

2358
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:11,520
right
 

2359
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,829
right
and oh by the way the backseater has a

2360
00:36:13,829 --> 00:36:13,839
and oh by the way the backseater has a
 

2361
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,750
and oh by the way the backseater has a
helmet on too so he can look to the left

2362
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:15,760
helmet on too so he can look to the left
 

2363
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,030
helmet on too so he can look to the left
and he can do things so depending on

2364
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:17,040
and he can do things so depending on
 

2365
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,589
and he can do things so depending on
what sensor he's controlling

2366
00:36:19,589 --> 00:36:19,599
what sensor he's controlling
 

2367
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,270
what sensor he's controlling
so if he's got control of the targeting

2368
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:21,280
so if he's got control of the targeting
 

2369
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,030
so if he's got control of the targeting
pod and he looks left the targeting pod

2370
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:23,040
pod and he looks left the targeting pod
 

2371
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:23,589
pod and he looks left the targeting pod
looks

2372
00:36:23,589 --> 00:36:23,599
looks
 

2373
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,069
looks
left but if i have something where i

2374
00:36:26,069 --> 00:36:26,079
left but if i have something where i
 

2375
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:27,670
left but if i have something where i
want to lock a guy up that i don't see

2376
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:27,680
want to lock a guy up that i don't see
 

2377
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,950
want to lock a guy up that i don't see
that maybe the radar didn't see but i

2378
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:28,960
that maybe the radar didn't see but i
 

2379
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,390
that maybe the radar didn't see but i
can get over and now point the radar you

2380
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:30,400
can get over and now point the radar you
 

2381
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:30,950
can get over and now point the radar you
know get the

2382
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:30,960
know get the
 

2383
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,390
know get the
because it's a it's a phase array radar

2384
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:32,400
because it's a it's a phase array radar
 

2385
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,230
because it's a it's a phase array radar
now it doesn't really scan

2386
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:34,240
now it doesn't really scan
 

2387
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,069
now it doesn't really scan
uh there's there's all kinds of cool

2388
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:36,079
uh there's there's all kinds of cool
 

2389
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,670
uh there's there's all kinds of cool
stuff that uh

2390
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:37,680
stuff that uh
 

2391
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,710
stuff that uh
that technology uh brings because if you

2392
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:40,720
that technology uh brings because if you
 

2393
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,550
that technology uh brings because if you
just if you went back 30 years and said

2394
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:42,560
just if you went back 30 years and said
 

2395
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:42,950
just if you went back 30 years and said
hey

2396
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:42,960
hey
 

2397
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,470
hey
or 40 years ago and said hey we're gonna

2398
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:44,480
or 40 years ago and said hey we're gonna
 

2399
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,510
or 40 years ago and said hey we're gonna
have this helmet and you're gonna be

2400
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:45,520
have this helmet and you're gonna be
 

2401
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,270
have this helmet and you're gonna be
able to slew everything to your head

2402
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:47,280
able to slew everything to your head
 

2403
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,190
able to slew everything to your head
and i don't mean a mechanical setup but

2404
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:49,200
and i don't mean a mechanical setup but
 

2405
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,710
and i don't mean a mechanical setup but
i mean literally you're just gonna map

2406
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:50,720
i mean literally you're just gonna map
 

2407
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,109
i mean literally you're just gonna map
magnetic resonance and go oh look and

2408
00:36:53,109 --> 00:36:53,119
magnetic resonance and go oh look and
 

2409
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,790
magnetic resonance and go oh look and
then i can i can literally slew my

2410
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:54,800
then i can i can literally slew my
 

2411
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,790
then i can i can literally slew my
sensors this fast

2412
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:56,800
sensors this fast
 

2413
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,589
sensors this fast
and then mash a button and transfer you

2414
00:36:59,589 --> 00:36:59,599
and then mash a button and transfer you
 

2415
00:36:59,599 --> 00:36:59,990
and then mash a button and transfer you
know

2416
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:00,000
know
 

2417
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,829
know
high quality coordinates from a system

2418
00:37:01,829 --> 00:37:01,839
high quality coordinates from a system
 

2419
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:03,030
high quality coordinates from a system
into a joint

00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:03,040
into a joint
 

2421
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,550
into a joint
you know a jdam which is a joint direct

2422
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:04,560
you know a jdam which is a joint direct
 

2423
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,109
you know a jdam which is a joint direct
attack munition that is the gps bombs

that you see all the time

2426
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:08,320
that you see all the time
 

2427
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,390
that you see all the time
and then let that thing fly and i'm i'm

2428
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:10,400
and then let that thing fly and i'm i'm
 

2429
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,510
and then let that thing fly and i'm i'm
solving this problem

2430
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:11,520
solving this problem
 

2431
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,030
solving this problem
in seconds by minutes or hey i got it

2432
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:15,040
in seconds by minutes or hey i got it
 

2433
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,069
in seconds by minutes or hey i got it
we're gonna have to menstruate

2434
00:37:16,069 --> 00:37:16,079
we're gonna have to menstruate
 

2435
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:16,950
we're gonna have to menstruate
coordinates and

2436
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:16,960
coordinates and
 

2437
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,310
coordinates and
you know you bring back the data and

2438
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:18,320
you know you bring back the data and
 

2439
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,510
you know you bring back the data and
then they do all the targeting for it

2440
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:19,520
then they do all the targeting for it
 

2441
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,790
then they do all the targeting for it
and then they send another group out to

2442
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:20,800
and then they send another group out to
 

2443
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,510
and then they send another group out to
get it

2444
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:21,520
get it
 

2445
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,150
get it
instead of all that now it's that fast

2446
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:24,160
instead of all that now it's that fast
 

2447
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,109
instead of all that now it's that fast
so there's a

2448
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:25,119
so there's a
 

2449
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,030
so there's a
okay i mean we probably don't have

2450
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:27,040
okay i mean we probably don't have
 

2451
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,630
okay i mean we probably don't have
enough time to talk about the beautiful

2452
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:28,640
enough time to talk about the beautiful
 

2453
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,470
enough time to talk about the beautiful
fusion of mines that happens when two

2454
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:30,480
fusion of mines that happens when two
 

2455
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,910
fusion of mines that happens when two
people are flying

2456
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:31,920
people are flying
 

2457
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,390
people are flying
controlling the plane but at a high

2458
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:34,400
controlling the plane but at a high
 

2459
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,670
controlling the plane but at a high
level this is a really

2460
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:35,680
level this is a really
 

2461
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,910
level this is a really
interesting question for people who

2462
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:37,920
interesting question for people who
 

2463
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,510
interesting question for people who
don't know what they're talking about

2464
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:39,520
don't know what they're talking about
 

2465
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,630
don't know what they're talking about
like me

2466
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:40,640
like me
 

2467
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,109
like me
which is what is the difference between

2468
00:37:43,109 --> 00:37:43,119
which is what is the difference between
 

2469
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,390
which is what is the difference between
a human being

2470
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:44,400
a human being
 

2471
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,510
a human being
and an ai system like

2472
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:47,520
and an ai system like
 

2473
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,270
and an ai system like
what can what is the ceiling of a

2474
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:51,280
what can what is the ceiling of a
 

2475
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:51,990
what can what is the ceiling of a
current

00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:53,920
ai technology for controlling the plane
 

2479
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,270
ai technology for controlling the plane
like how much

2480
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:55,280
like how much
 

2481
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,510
like how much
does the human contribute uh is it

2482
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:57,520
does the human contribute uh is it
 

2483
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,390
does the human contribute uh is it
possible to have

2484
00:37:58,390 --> 00:37:58,400
possible to have
 

2485
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,870
possible to have
automated flight for example like what

2486
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:00,880
automated flight for example like what
 

2487
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,670
automated flight for example like what
is

2488
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:01,680
is
 

2489
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,950
is
the hardest part about flying

2490
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:04,960
the hardest part about flying
 

2491
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,910
the hardest part about flying
that a human does expertly that an ai

2492
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:07,920
that a human does expertly that an ai
 

2493
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,190
that a human does expertly that an ai
system cannot

2494
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:09,200
system cannot
 

2495
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,470
system cannot
in warfare situations in in

2496
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:12,480
in warfare situations in in
 

2497
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:18,230
in warfare situations in in
flying a fighter jet lane so i would say

2498
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:18,240
flying a fighter jet lane so i would say
 

2499
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,630
flying a fighter jet lane so i would say
systems are usually black and white when

2500
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:20,640
systems are usually black and white when
 

2501
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,270
systems are usually black and white when
you write the algorithm for an ai system

2502
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:23,280
you write the algorithm for an ai system
 

2503
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,510
you write the algorithm for an ai system
it's it's it's it's really it's

2504
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:25,520
it's it's it's it's really it's
 

2505
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,630
it's it's it's it's really it's
basically you're taking

2506
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:26,640
basically you're taking
 

2507
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,390
basically you're taking
thought and turning it into a giant math

2508
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:28,400
thought and turning it into a giant math
 

2509
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,990
thought and turning it into a giant math
problem is really what you're doing

2510
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:30,000
problem is really what you're doing
 

2511
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,750
problem is really what you're doing
right so you've got this logical math

2512
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:31,760
right so you've got this logical math
 

2513
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,670
right so you've got this logical math
problem math problems are

2514
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:33,680
problem math problems are
 

2515
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,670
problem math problems are
there's there's there's a line it says i

2516
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:35,680
there's there's there's a line it says i
 

2517
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,510
there's there's there's a line it says i
can or i can't and it's a it's a very

2518
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:37,520
can or i can't and it's a it's a very
 

2519
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,550
can or i can't and it's a it's a very
finite line

2520
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:38,560
finite line
 

2521
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,950
finite line
you know but you can go up to the line

2522
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:40,960
you know but you can go up to the line
 

2523
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,390
you know but you can go up to the line
where a human

2524
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:42,400
where a human
 

2525
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,430
where a human
we all have gray areas where we go

2526
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:45,440
we all have gray areas where we go
 

2527
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,870
we all have gray areas where we go
maybe yeah i'll try it um so he just can

2528
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:48,880
maybe yeah i'll try it um so he just can
 

2529
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,710
maybe yeah i'll try it um so he just can
operate within that gray so if you took

2530
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:50,720
operate within that gray so if you took
 

2531
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,550
operate within that gray so if you took
if you take an airplane and say and i'll

2532
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:52,560
if you take an airplane and say and i'll
 

2533
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,910
if you take an airplane and say and i'll
just take a hornet for a while a super

2534
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:53,920
just take a hornet for a while a super
 

2535
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,750
just take a hornet for a while a super
horn it doesn't matter any airplane

2536
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:55,760
horn it doesn't matter any airplane
 

2537
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,349
horn it doesn't matter any airplane
and you go here is the flight

2538
00:38:57,349 --> 00:38:57,359
and you go here is the flight
 

2539
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,109
and you go here is the flight
performance model of the airplane so

2540
00:38:59,109 --> 00:38:59,119
performance model of the airplane so
 

2541
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,829
performance model of the airplane so
if you know an uh an em diagram is the

2542
00:39:01,829 --> 00:39:01,839
if you know an uh an em diagram is the
 

2543
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,750
if you know an uh an em diagram is the
energy so it basically says

2544
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:03,760

2545
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,510
energy so it basically says
the airplane can fly as slow as this it

there some

2672
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:04,640
there some
 

2673
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,390
there some
well it's it's very it's very similar

2674
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:06,400
well it's it's very it's very similar
 

2675
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,510
well it's it's very it's very similar
what i was talking about earlier with

2676
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:07,520
what i was talking about earlier with
 

2677
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,950
what i was talking about earlier with
the a6 so

2678
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:08,960
the a6 so
 

2679
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,430
the a6 so
one is when you're flying with a crew uh

2680
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:11,440
one is when you're flying with a crew uh
 

2681
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,030
one is when you're flying with a crew uh
their standardization

2682
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:13,040
their standardization
 

2683
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,710
their standardization
so you gotta remember when sully flew

2684
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:14,720
so you gotta remember when sully flew
 

2685
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,069
so you gotta remember when sully flew
when his first officer that's the

00:41:16,069 --> 00:41:16,079
when his first officer that's the
 

2687
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:16,870
when his first officer that's the
co-pilot

2688
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:16,880
co-pilot
 

2689
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,270
co-pilot
showed up you know first time they met

2690
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:19,280
showed up you know first time they met
 

2691
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,470
showed up you know first time they met
and this happens all the time in the

2692
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:20,480
and this happens all the time in the
 

2693
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,150
and this happens all the time in the
commercial world you know there's

2694
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:22,160
commercial world you know there's
 

2695
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,670
commercial world you know there's
six seven thousand pilots at united

like all of the deployment
so because you want to use you have to

2712
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:40,000
so because you want to use you have to
 

2713
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,109
so because you want to use you have to
trust

2714
00:41:41,109 --> 00:41:41,119
trust
 

2715
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:42,550
trust
all of those things it increases the

to know what they are
 

2869
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:54,790
to know what they are
right so they know the airline uh same

2870
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:54,800
right so they know the airline uh same
 

2871
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,390
right so they know the airline uh same
type you know they go hey i know this is

2872
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:56,400
type you know they go hey i know this is
 

2873

type you know they go hey i know this is
they pull the book out because the

2874
00:43:57,430 --> 00:43:57,440
they pull the book out because the
 

2875
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,950
they pull the book out because the
airplanes are designed they're built to

2876
00:43:58,950 --> 00:43:58,960
airplanes are designed they're built to
 

2877
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,550

have some time

2878
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:00,560
have some time
 

2879
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,670
have some time
but there's a point where you have to

2880
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:01,680
but there's a point where you have to
 

2881
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,870
but there's a point where you have to
make a decision and you can't

2882
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:02,880
make a decision and you can't
 

2883
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,710
make a decision and you can't
second-guess it so when he decided i'm

2884
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:04,720
second-guess it so when he decided i'm
 

2885
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,470
second-guess it so when he decided i'm
putting this in the hudson river

2886
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:06,480
putting this in the hudson river
 

2887
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,829
putting this in the hudson river
he couldn't all of a sudden halfway

2888
00:44:07,829 --> 00:44:07,839
he couldn't all of a sudden halfway
 

2889
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:09,430
he couldn't all of a sudden halfway
through it go well maybe i can get over

2890
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:09,440
through it go well maybe i can get over
 

2891
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,390
through it go well maybe i can get over
to that airport

2892
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:10,400
to that airport
 

2893
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,630
to that airport
he he looked he made a quick assessment

2894
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:12,640
he he looked he made a quick assessment
 

2895
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,589
he he looked he made a quick assessment
this is that 80

2896
00:44:13,589 --> 00:44:13,599
this is that 80
 

2897
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:16,470
this is that 80
solution where you go these are not i'm

2898
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:16,480
solution where you go these are not i'm
 

2899
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,190
solution where you go these are not i'm
you know it's

2900
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:17,200
you know it's
 

2901
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,550
you know it's
like a multiple choice test when you go

2902
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:18,560
like a multiple choice test when you go
 

2903
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,990
like a multiple choice test when you go
oh my god i don't really know the answer

2904
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:20,000
oh my god i don't really know the answer
 

2905
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,190
oh my god i don't really know the answer
but i know a and d

2906
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:21,200
but i know a and d
 

2907
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,670
but i know a and d
are wrong yeah gone so the jersey

2908
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:23,680
are wrong yeah gone so the jersey
 

2909
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,150
are wrong yeah gone so the jersey
airport and going back to laguardia gone

2910
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:26,160
airport and going back to laguardia gone
 

2911
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,790
airport and going back to laguardia gone
yeah so what's my next option well the

2912
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:28,800
yeah so what's my next option well the
 

2913
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,470
yeah so what's my next option well the
hudson river's there and that's probably

2914
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:30,480
hudson river's there and that's probably
 

2915
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,230
hudson river's there and that's probably
looking pretty good or what is my other

2916
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:32,240
looking pretty good or what is my other
 

2917
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:32,790
looking pretty good or what is my other
one

2918
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:32,800
one
 

2919
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,630
one
can i get a restart on the the motors

2920
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:34,640
can i get a restart on the the motors
 

2921
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,710
can i get a restart on the the motors
and then if i can get a restart now can

2922
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:36,720
and then if i can get a restart now can
 

2923
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,150
and then if i can get a restart now can
i take it someplace else

2924
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:38,160
i take it someplace else
 

2925
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,829
i take it someplace else
he had to make really really fast

2926
00:44:39,829 --> 00:44:39,839
he had to make really really fast
 

2927
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:42,069
he had to make really really fast
decisions and then once they as they

2928
00:44:42,069 --> 00:44:42,079
decisions and then once they as they
 

2929
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,990
decisions and then once they as they
they go that 80 solution you realize all

2930
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:44,000
they go that 80 solution you realize all
 

2931
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,510
they go that 80 solution you realize all
right i'm going into the hudson

2932
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:45,520
right i'm going into the hudson
 

2933
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,870
right i'm going into the hudson
there's the 80 percent get the book out

2934
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:46,880
there's the 80 percent get the book out
 

2935
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:47,910
there's the 80 percent get the book out
let's see if we can get an error star

2936
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:47,920
let's see if we can get an error star
 

2937
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:48,630
let's see if we can get an error star
because if you listen to the tapes

2938
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:48,640
because if you listen to the tapes
 

2939
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,150
because if you listen to the tapes
they're trying to get it air started

2940
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:50,160
they're trying to get it air started
 

2941
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,710
they're trying to get it air started
the closer he gets to the water the more

2942
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:52,720
the closer he gets to the water the more
 

2943
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,030
the closer he gets to the water the more
he's going i'm ditching the airplane

2944
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:55,040
he's going i'm ditching the airplane
 

2945
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,510
he's going i'm ditching the airplane
so the original decision to this is my

2946
00:44:57,510 --> 00:44:57,520
so the original decision to this is my
 

2947
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,349
so the original decision to this is my
best option right now

2948
00:44:59,349 --> 00:44:59,359
best option right now
 

2949
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:01,589
best option right now
this is where i'm going and you start

2950
00:45:01,589 --> 00:45:01,599
this is where i'm going and you start
 

2951
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:03,670
this is where i'm going and you start
eliminating anything that could possibly

the events which they tried to do and
 

2957
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,230
the events which they tried to do and
then he gets to that last minute says

2958
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:08,240
then he gets to that last minute says
 

2959
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,349
then he gets to that last minute says
we're going in the water

2960
00:45:09,349 --> 00:45:09,359
we're going in the water
 

2961
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,030
we're going in the water
they change the plan they secure the

airplane they do exactly what they're
doing and he does that basically

2966
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:13,280
doing and he does that basically
 

2967

research in the airplane in the
 

2977
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,750
research in the airplane in the
simulator where they train to

a motor you just lost another motor
 

2983
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,750
a motor you just lost another motor
so they go through this extensive

2984
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:31,760
so they go through this extensive
 

2985
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,030
so they go through this extensive
training you know

2986

the pain cave where you're gonna get in
 

2993
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:38,550
the pain cave where you're gonna get in
because you know

2994
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:38,560
because you know
 

2995
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,230
because you know
that when you get in for your check ride

2996
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:40,240
that when you get in for your check ride
 

2997
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,750
that when you get in for your check ride
in a simulator that the airplane is

2998
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:41,760
in a simulator that the airplane is
 

2999
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,030
in a simulator that the airplane is
going to break

3000
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:43,040
going to break
 

3001
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,309
going to break
you're going to lose hydra and it's

3002
00:45:44,309 --> 00:45:44,319
you're going to lose hydra and it's
 

3003
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,829
you're going to lose hydra and it's
sometimes there a problem like oh i just

3004
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:45,839
sometimes there a problem like oh i just
 

3005
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:47,430
sometimes there a problem like oh i just
lost this hydraulic system but i'm

3006
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:47,440
lost this hydraulic system but i'm
 

3007
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,870
lost this hydraulic system but i'm
having an issue on the other motor well

3008
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:48,880
having an issue on the other motor well
 

3009
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,309
having an issue on the other motor well
if i shut down this motor

3010
00:45:50,309 --> 00:45:50,319
if i shut down this motor
 

3011
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:51,589
if i shut down this motor
and i've got a hydraulics you know

3012
00:45:51,589 --> 00:45:51,599
and i've got a hydraulics you know
 

3013
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:52,950
and i've got a hydraulics you know
because there's two hydraulic systems

3014
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:52,960
because there's two hydraulic systems
 

3015
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,470
because there's two hydraulic systems
one on each motor

3016
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:54,480
one on each motor
 

3017
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,910
one on each motor
well if i've got an issue with the left

3018
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:55,920
well if i've got an issue with the left
 

3019
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,510
well if i've got an issue with the left

so you never have you experienced fear
during flight like um

3134

00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,069
walking up to the ring he's like
he starts out basically in fear

3144

he starts out basically in fear
 

3145
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:59,510

3151
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,109
purely to put in towards his fear but as
he gets closer and closer to the ring is

3152
00:48:05,109 --> 00:48:05,119
he gets closer and closer to the ring is
 

3153
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:08,870
he gets closer and closer to the ring is
the confidence grows and grows until the

3154
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:08,880

00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:24,870
thing like that or is that
or do you just go to the part of the

3170
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:24,880
or do you just go to the part of the
 

3171
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,109
or do you just go to the part of the
brain that goes to the training

3172
00:48:27,109 --> 00:48:27,119
brain that goes to the training
 

3173
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:28,870
brain that goes to the training
and then you just go to the instinctual

3174
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:28,880
and then you just go to the instinctual
 

3175
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,710
and then you just go to the instinctual
80 solution

3176
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:30,720
80 solution
 

3177

80 solution
i wouldn't say i was never afraid i

3178
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:32,880
i wouldn't say i was never afraid i
 

3179
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,309
i wouldn't say i was never afraid i
think that would be

think that would be
i can't i couldn't tell you that anyone

and
 

3187
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:40,230
and
for most of us especially navy carrier

3188
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:40,240
for most of us especially navy carrier
 

3189
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,190

pilots it's just
 

3191
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,670
pilots it's just
it's it's usually especially when you're

3192
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:43,680
it's it's usually especially when you're
 

3193
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,190
it's it's usually especially when you're
new and you got to go out and it's

3194
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:45,200
new and you got to go out and it's
 

3195
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:45,910
new and you got to go out and it's
nighttime

3196
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:45,920
nighttime
 

3197
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,349
nighttime
and there's no moon and the weather

3198
00:48:47,349 --> 00:48:47,359
and there's no moon and the weather
 

3199
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,950
and there's no moon and the weather
sucks and the deck's moving

3200
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:48,960
sucks and the deck's moving
 

3201
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,270
sucks and the deck's moving
you know the ship's going up and down

3202
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:51,280
you know the ship's going up and down
 

3203
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,630
you know the ship's going up and down
because it will scare lover living [\h__\h]

out of you

3206
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:53,680
out of you
 

3207
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,150
out of you
can i say that you can definitely say

3208
00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:56,160
can i say that you can definitely say
 

3209
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,589
can i say that you can definitely say
that so it's about landing or take

3210
00:48:57,589 --> 00:48:57,599
that so it's about landing or take
 

3211
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,309
that so it's about landing or take
off that that is if you even they used

3212
00:49:00,309 --> 00:49:00,319
off that that is if you even they used
 

3213
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:01,589
off that that is if you even they used
to wire people up they did it during

3214
00:49:01,589 --> 00:49:01,599
to wire people up they did it during
 

3215
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:02,390
to wire people up they did it during
vietnam

you know guys that go flying missions

3218
00:49:03,829 --> 00:49:03,839
you know guys that go flying missions
 

3219
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:05,109
you know guys that go flying missions
you know when they were flying low and

3220
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:05,119
you know when they were flying low and
 

3221
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:06,950
you know when they were flying low and
crazy stuff was going on and

3222
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:06,960
crazy stuff was going on and
 

3223
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,270
crazy stuff was going on and
people were getting shot down a lot uh

3224
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:09,280
people were getting shot down a lot uh
 

3225
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,069
people were getting shot down a lot uh
the highest

3226
00:49:10,069 --> 00:49:10,079
the highest
 

3227
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:11,750
the highest
the highest anxiety and heart rates were

3228
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:11,760
the highest anxiety and heart rates were
 

3229
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,270
the highest anxiety and heart rates were
coming back to land on board an aircraft

3230
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:13,280
coming back to land on board an aircraft
 

3231
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,190
coming back to land on board an aircraft
carrier how hard is it to land on that

3232
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:15,200
carrier how hard is it to land on that
 

3233
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,349
carrier how hard is it to land on that
it seems impossible like for

3234
00:49:17,349 --> 00:49:17,359
it seems impossible like for
 

3235
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:20,470
it seems impossible like for
for a civilian i guess like me it just

3236
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:20,480
for a civilian i guess like me it just
 

3237
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,190
for a civilian i guess like me it just
seems

3238
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:21,200
seems
 

3239
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,589
seems
crazy that a human can do that the

3240
00:49:23,589 --> 00:49:23,599
crazy that a human can do that the
 

3241
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:24,710
crazy that a human can do that the
problem with night

3242
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:24,720
problem with night
 

3243
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,589
problem with night
is and there's different degrees of

3244
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:27,599
is and there's different degrees of
 

3245
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:28,950
is and there's different degrees of
night just like day i mean there's the

3246
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:28,960
night just like day i mean there's the
 

3247
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,470
night just like day i mean there's the
clear full moon night

3248
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:30,480
clear full moon night
 

3249
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,549
clear full moon night
you know where it's like oh yeah you

3250
00:49:32,549 --> 00:49:32,559
you know where it's like oh yeah you
 

3251
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:34,309
you know where it's like oh yeah you
know this is not that bad

3252
00:49:34,309 --> 00:49:34,319
know this is not that bad
 

3253
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:36,630
know this is not that bad
but you gotta remember at night i think

3254
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:36,640
but you gotta remember at night i think
 

3255
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,230
but you gotta remember at night i think
everyone can associate with

3256
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:38,240
everyone can associate with
 

3257
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,309
everyone can associate with
you're driving in your car and it's just

3258
00:49:40,309 --> 00:49:40,319
you're driving in your car and it's just
 

3259
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:41,270
you're driving in your car and it's just
a it's it's an

3260
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:41,280
a it's it's an
 

3261
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,109
a it's it's an
overcast dark night and you're on a

3262
00:49:43,109 --> 00:49:43,119
overcast dark night and you're on a
 

3263
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:45,750
overcast dark night and you're on a
country road with no side lights

3264
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:45,760
country road with no side lights
 

3265
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,309
country road with no side lights
most people have a tendency to slow down

3266
00:49:48,309 --> 00:49:48,319
most people have a tendency to slow down
 

3267
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,390
most people have a tendency to slow down
just by nature of oh my god because you

3268
00:49:50,390 --> 00:49:50,400
just by nature of oh my god because you
 

3269
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,589
just by nature of oh my god because you
what you'll do is you'll out drive your

3270
00:49:51,589 --> 00:49:51,599
what you'll do is you'll out drive your
 

3271
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:52,710
what you'll do is you'll out drive your
headlights because it is so

3272
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:52,720
headlights because it is so
 

3273
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,870
headlights because it is so
dark you know you can get outside you

3274
00:49:54,870 --> 00:49:54,880
dark you know you can get outside you
 

3275
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,150
dark you know you can get outside you
get outside the city and get up into new

3276
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:56,160
get outside the city and get up into new
 

3277
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,670
get outside the city and get up into new
hampshire

3278
00:49:57,670 --> 00:49:57,680
hampshire
 

3279
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,510
hampshire
especially when the roads are curving

3280
00:49:59,510 --> 00:49:59,520
especially when the roads are curving
 

3281
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,870
especially when the roads are curving
you know and the lines probably aren't

3282
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:00,880
you know and the lines probably aren't
 

3283
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,309
you know and the lines probably aren't
that good

3284
00:50:02,309 --> 00:50:02,319
that good
 

3285
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:04,309
that good
it's you know now take that and multiply

3286
00:50:04,309 --> 00:50:04,319
it's you know now take that and multiply
 

3287
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:06,150
it's you know now take that and multiply
it by like a million

3288
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:06,160
it by like a million
 

3289
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,750
it by like a million
because you have no depth perception uh

3290
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:09,760
because you have no depth perception uh
 

3291
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,790
because you have no depth perception uh
what you think is fixed the runway

3292
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:12,800
what you think is fixed the runway
 

3293
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,430
what you think is fixed the runway
is actually moving up and down and left

3294
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:15,440
is actually moving up and down and left
 

3295
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,150
is actually moving up and down and left
to right

3296
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:16,160
to right
 

3297
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,150
to right
yeah oh and when it's really bad you can

3298
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:18,160
yeah oh and when it's really bad you can
 

3299
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,750
yeah oh and when it's really bad you can
actually see it move

3300
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:19,760
actually see it move
 

3301
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,069
actually see it move
and uh we have two systems uh you know

3302
00:50:22,069 --> 00:50:22,079
and uh we have two systems uh you know
 

3303
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:23,829
and uh we have two systems uh you know
there was a there's an automatic system

3304
00:50:23,829 --> 00:50:23,839
there was a there's an automatic system
 

3305
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:27,430
there was a there's an automatic system
that's actually uh it stabilizes with

3306
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:27,440
that's actually uh it stabilizes with
 

3307
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,510
that's actually uh it stabilizes with
the inertials on the ship

3308
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:29,520
the inertials on the ship
 

3309
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,990
the inertials on the ship
and then there's the ils now civilian

3310
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:32,000
and then there's the ils now civilian
 

3311
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,430
and then there's the ils now civilian
pilots will tell you that ils is a

3312
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:33,440
pilots will tell you that ils is a
 

3313
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,870
pilots will tell you that ils is a
precision approach which gives you

3314
00:50:34,870 --> 00:50:34,880
precision approach which gives you
 

3315
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,470
precision approach which gives you
azimuth and glide slope you know you

3316
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:36,480
azimuth and glide slope you know you
 

3317
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,870
azimuth and glide slope you know you
come down it's like a plus

3318
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:38,880
come down it's like a plus
 

3319
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,390
come down it's like a plus
on the carrier it's not it's really just

3320
00:50:40,390 --> 00:50:40,400
on the carrier it's not it's really just
 

3321
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,910
on the carrier it's not it's really just
a beam that goes out and it's considered

3322
00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:41,920
a beam that goes out and it's considered
 

3323
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,430
a beam that goes out and it's considered
a non-precision approach it's

3324
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:43,440
a non-precision approach it's
 

3325
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,990
a non-precision approach it's
it's not stabilized at all that and i've

3326
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:46,000
it's not stabilized at all that and i've
 

3327
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,270
it's not stabilized at all that and i've
been where you can actually watch the

3328
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:47,280
been where you can actually watch the
 

3329
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,549
been where you can actually watch the
needle and the and the

3330
00:50:48,549 --> 00:50:48,559
needle and the and the
 

3331
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:49,910
needle and the and the
attack hand needle will move there's all

3332
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:49,920
attack hand needle will move there's all
 

3333
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,510
attack hand needle will move there's all
kinds of stuff moving because the base

3334
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:51,520
kinds of stuff moving because the base
 

3335
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:52,710
kinds of stuff moving because the base
that it's all sitting on

3336
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:52,720
that it's all sitting on
 

3337
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,190
that it's all sitting on
is doing this and ships don't just go up

3338
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:55,200
is doing this and ships don't just go up
 

3339
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,069
is doing this and ships don't just go up
and down they

3340
00:50:56,069 --> 00:50:56,079
and down they
 

3341
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:57,670
and down they
they do this so the bow goes up and down

3342
00:50:57,670 --> 00:50:57,680
they do this so the bow goes up and down
 

3343
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,030
they do this so the bow goes up and down
and the tail like you normally see a

3344
00:50:59,030 --> 00:50:59,040
and the tail like you normally see a
 

3345
00:50:59,040 --> 00:50:59,750
and the tail like you normally see a
ship

3346
00:50:59,750 --> 00:50:59,760
ship
 

3347
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,510
ship
and then there's so that's pitch and

3348
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:01,520
and then there's so that's pitch and
 

3349
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,870
and then there's so that's pitch and
then it has roll

3350
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:02,880
then it has roll
 

3351
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,470
then it has roll
so it's doing this and then it has heave

3352
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:04,480
so it's doing this and then it has heave
 

3353
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,390
so it's doing this and then it has heave
so the whole boat is going up and down

3354
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:06,400
so the whole boat is going up and down
 

3355
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,990
so the whole boat is going up and down
while it's pitching and rolling

3356
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:08,000
while it's pitching and rolling
 

3357
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,750
while it's pitching and rolling

they're well well well above average
 

3965
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,270
they're well well well above average
it's like the person in a math class

3966
00:59:59,270 --> 00:59:59,280
it's like the person in a math class
 

3967
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:00,870
it's like the person in a math class
that sits down in complex math

3968
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:00,880
that sits down in complex math
 

3969
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:03,589
that sits down in complex math
and they just get it you know at the

3970
01:00:03,589 --> 01:00:03,599
and they just get it you know at the
 

3971
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:04,150

there's the three at the bottom that are
 

3975
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,510
there's the three at the bottom that are
gonna struggle and there's a good chance

they won't get out and if they do get

3978
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:09,200
they won't get out and if they do get
 

3979
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:09,750
they won't get out and if they do get
out

3980

out
 

3981
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:11,430
out
they're gonna have to work really hard

3982
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:11,440
they're gonna have to work really hard
 

3983
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,750
they're gonna have to work really hard
to just maintain kind of average

3984
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:13,760
to just maintain kind of average
 

3985
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:14,950
to just maintain kind of average
sometimes it's just the way your mind

3999
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,470
the bell curve doesn't look real good
it's just a big hump and it comes back

4000
01:00:28,470 --> 01:00:28,480
it's just a big hump and it comes back
 

4001
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:29,829
it's just a big hump and it comes back
down and everyone's right there within

one
 

4005
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,710
one
mean deviation and then you have the

4006
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:32,720
mean deviation and then you have the
 

4007
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:33,510
mean deviation and then you have the
outliers

4008
01:00:33,510 --> 01:00:33,520
outliers
 

4009
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:34,789
outliers
usually not on the high side because

4010
01:00:34,789 --> 01:00:34,799
usually not on the high side because
 

4011
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:35,750
usually not on the high side because
they're going to get through but the

01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:35,760
they're going to get through but the
 

4013
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,190
they're going to get through but the
outliers on the low side that don't make

so for the most part the navy does a
 

4019
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,069
so for the most part the navy does a
really good job as does the air force

they put you into primary
it's kind of like a it's like a

it's kind of like a it's like a

it's very similar to that but it's more

4050
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:06,720
it's very similar to that but it's more
 

4051
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,870
it's very similar to that but it's more
of a hand skill

of a hand skill
 

4053
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,950
of a hand skill
can you adapt because although we live

4054
01:01:10,950 --> 01:01:10,960
can you adapt because although we live
 

4055
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:12,710
can you adapt because although we live
in three dimensions like this table is

4056
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:12,720
in three dimensions like this table is
 

4057
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:13,109
in three dimensions like this table is
not

4058
01:01:13,109 --> 01:01:13,119
not
 

4059
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:15,109
not
you know we this is you know this is all

4060
01:01:15,109 --> 01:01:15,119
you know we this is you know this is all
 

4061
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:16,870
you know we this is you know this is all
has depth with all that

4062
01:01:16,870 --> 01:01:16,880
has depth with all that
 

4063
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,470
has depth with all that
uh where it's really relative to

4064
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:18,480
uh where it's really relative to
 

4065
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,549
uh where it's really relative to
aviation we are two-dimensional

4066
01:01:20,549 --> 01:01:20,559
aviation we are two-dimensional
 

4067
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:23,030
aviation we are two-dimensional
very two-dimensional can you explain

4068
01:01:23,030 --> 01:01:23,040
very two-dimensional can you explain
 

4069
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:25,670
very two-dimensional can you explain
that so our perception is actually more

4070
01:01:25,670 --> 01:01:25,680
that so our perception is actually more
 

4071
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,349
that so our perception is actually more
limited than the

4072
01:01:27,349 --> 01:01:27,359
limited than the
 

4073
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:29,510
limited than the
than that of an aviator very much and

4074
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:29,520
than that of an aviator very much and
 

4075
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,670
than that of an aviator very much and
here's why yeah so we look at

4076
01:01:31,670 --> 01:01:31,680
here's why yeah so we look at
 

4077
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,349
here's why yeah so we look at
uh let's look at a tall building let's

4078
01:01:33,349 --> 01:01:33,359
uh let's look at a tall building let's
 

4079
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:34,950
uh let's look at a tall building let's
look at one world trade center in new

4080
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:34,960
look at one world trade center in new
 

4081
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:35,910
look at one world trade center in new
york because that's

4082
01:01:35,910 --> 01:01:35,920
york because that's
 

4083
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:37,109
york because that's
everyone knows what it looks like big

4084
01:01:37,109 --> 01:01:37,119
everyone knows what it looks like big
 

4085
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:39,589
everyone knows what it looks like big
tall building um

4086
01:01:39,589 --> 01:01:39,599
tall building um
 

4087
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:42,549
tall building um
it's what maybe 1800 feet tall even the

4088
01:01:42,549 --> 01:01:42,559
it's what maybe 1800 feet tall even the
 

4089
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:44,470
it's what maybe 1800 feet tall even the
burjal dubai which is like what 20

4090
01:01:44,470 --> 01:01:44,480
burjal dubai which is like what 20
 

4091
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,789
burjal dubai which is like what 20
700 feet tall it's not that big so a

4092
01:01:46,789 --> 01:01:46,799
700 feet tall it's not that big so a
 

4093
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:49,349
700 feet tall it's not that big so a
super hornet to do a what a split s is

4094
01:01:49,349 --> 01:01:49,359
super hornet to do a what a split s is
 

4095
01:01:49,359 --> 01:01:50,230
super hornet to do a what a split s is
which is

4096
01:01:50,230 --> 01:01:50,240
which is
 

4097
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,589
which is
i'm flying i'm just going to roll the

4098
01:01:51,589 --> 01:01:51,599
i'm flying i'm just going to roll the
 

4099
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:52,950
i'm flying i'm just going to roll the
airplane upside down and then i'm going

4100
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:52,960
airplane upside down and then i'm going
 

4101
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,470
airplane upside down and then i'm going
to do basically

4102
01:01:54,470 --> 01:01:54,480
to do basically
 

4103
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,549
to do basically
a c the letter c i'm going to go in the

4104
01:01:56,549 --> 01:01:56,559
a c the letter c i'm going to go in the
 

4105
01:01:56,559 --> 01:01:57,990
a c the letter c i'm going to go in the
top and out the bottom

4106
01:01:57,990 --> 01:01:58,000
top and out the bottom
 

4107
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,069
top and out the bottom
so and i'm just basically a vertical

4108
01:02:00,069 --> 01:02:00,079
so and i'm just basically a vertical
 

4109
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:01,270
so and i'm just basically a vertical
displacement of the airplane so i'm

4110
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:01,280
displacement of the airplane so i'm
 

4111
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,510
displacement of the airplane so i'm
going from high to low

4112
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:03,520
going from high to low
 

4113
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:05,109
going from high to low
it's very very tight and it doesn't in

4114
01:02:05,109 --> 01:02:05,119
it's very very tight and it doesn't in
 

4115
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:07,589
it's very very tight and it doesn't in
about roughly about 2 500 feet

4116
01:02:07,589 --> 01:02:07,599
about roughly about 2 500 feet
 

4117
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:09,990
about roughly about 2 500 feet
give or take a little so you go that is

4118
01:02:09,990 --> 01:02:10,000
give or take a little so you go that is
 

4119
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,309
give or take a little so you go that is
that is a really tight vertical turn

4120
01:02:12,309 --> 01:02:12,319
that is a really tight vertical turn
 

4121
01:02:12,319 --> 01:02:14,630
that is a really tight vertical turn
yeah for example the a6 in order to do

4122
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:14,640
yeah for example the a6 in order to do
 

4123
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,950
yeah for example the a6 in order to do
that was about 9 000 feet

4124
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:16,960
that was about 9 000 feet
 

4125
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:18,789
that was about 9 000 feet
and we look at a building that's 2000

4126
01:02:18,789 --> 01:02:18,799
and we look at a building that's 2000
 

4127
01:02:18,799 --> 01:02:19,990
and we look at a building that's 2000
feet high and think that is

4128
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:20,000
feet high and think that is
 

4129
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,789
feet high and think that is
tall right all right so in an aviation

4130
01:02:22,789 --> 01:02:22,799
tall right all right so in an aviation
 

4131
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:24,470
tall right all right so in an aviation
sense when you're starting to do

4132
01:02:24,470 --> 01:02:24,480
sense when you're starting to do
 

4133
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:25,910
sense when you're starting to do
vertical displacement maneuvers going

4134
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:25,920
vertical displacement maneuvers going
 

4135
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:28,150
vertical displacement maneuvers going
from 35 000 feet down to 20 000 feet in

4136
01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:28,160
from 35 000 feet down to 20 000 feet in
 

4137
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:29,430
from 35 000 feet down to 20 000 feet in
a matter of seconds

4138
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:29,440
a matter of seconds
 

4139
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,109
a matter of seconds
and maneuvering the airplane because the

4140
01:02:31,109 --> 01:02:31,119
and maneuvering the airplane because the
 

4141
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:32,950
and maneuvering the airplane because the
human brain thinks we

4142
01:02:32,950 --> 01:02:32,960
human brain thinks we
 

4143
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:35,270
human brain thinks we
really are we like to be flat i see we

4144
01:02:35,270 --> 01:02:35,280
really are we like to be flat i see we
 

4145
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:36,309
really are we like to be flat i see we
think 2d so

4146
01:02:36,309 --> 01:02:36,319
think 2d so
 

4147
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:38,069
think 2d so
if i'm fighting how you really get an

4148
01:02:38,069 --> 01:02:38,079
if i'm fighting how you really get an
 

4149
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,349
if i'm fighting how you really get an
advantage when you're

4150
01:02:39,349 --> 01:02:39,359
advantage when you're
 

4151
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:41,349
advantage when you're
fighting another airplane is to work in

4152
01:02:41,349 --> 01:02:41,359
fighting another airplane is to work in
 

4153
01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:42,630
fighting another airplane is to work in
the vertical

4154
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:42,640
the vertical
 

4155
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:44,309
the vertical
because most people will do like one

4156
01:02:44,309 --> 01:02:44,319
because most people will do like one
 

4157
01:02:44,319 --> 01:02:45,670
because most people will do like one
move in the vertical and then they want

4158
01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:45,680
move in the vertical and then they want
 

4159
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,109
move in the vertical and then they want
to start to flatten out because that's

4160
01:02:47,109 --> 01:02:47,119
to start to flatten out because that's
 

4161
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:48,069
to start to flatten out because that's
where we're comfortable

4162
01:02:48,069 --> 01:02:48,079
where we're comfortable
 

4163
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:49,589
where we're comfortable
yeah it's very profound do you still

4164
01:02:49,589 --> 01:02:49,599
yeah it's very profound do you still
 

4165
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:53,109
yeah it's very profound do you still
think in like stacks of 2d layers or no

4166
01:02:53,109 --> 01:02:53,119
think in like stacks of 2d layers or no
 

4167
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:55,510
think in like stacks of 2d layers or no
or do you do you truly start to think in

4168
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:55,520
or do you do you truly start to think in
 

4169
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,589
or do you do you truly start to think in
that third dimension like

4170
01:02:57,589 --> 01:02:57,599
that third dimension like
 

4171
01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:01,990
that third dimension like
the rich 3d world of uh

4172
01:03:01,990 --> 01:03:02,000
the rich 3d world of uh
 

4173
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,309
the rich 3d world of uh
like a fighting like do you start to

4174
01:03:04,309 --> 01:03:04,319
like a fighting like do you start to
 

4175
01:03:04,319 --> 01:03:05,589
like a fighting like do you start to
actually be able to

4176
01:03:05,589 --> 01:03:05,599
actually be able to
 

4177
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:09,109
actually be able to
really experience the 3d nature

4178
01:03:09,109 --> 01:03:09,119
really experience the 3d nature
 

4179
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:10,630
really experience the 3d nature
you do because you have to project where

4180
01:03:10,630 --> 01:03:10,640
you do because you have to project where
 

4181
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:11,829
you do because you have to project where
you're going to be so you have to know

4182
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:11,839
you're going to be so you have to know
 

4183
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:13,270
you're going to be so you have to know
the performance of the airplane knowing

4184
01:03:13,270 --> 01:03:13,280
the performance of the airplane knowing
 

4185
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,190
the performance of the airplane knowing
that hey if i do this maneuver that i am

4186
01:03:15,190 --> 01:03:15,200
that hey if i do this maneuver that i am
 

4187
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,150
that hey if i do this maneuver that i am
going to go

4188
01:03:16,150 --> 01:03:16,160
going to go
 

4189
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:17,829
going to go
it's it's kind of like when i when i

4190
01:03:17,829 --> 01:03:17,839
it's it's kind of like when i when i
 

4191
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:19,349
it's it's kind of like when i when i
talk about when we were chasing the tic

4192
01:03:19,349 --> 01:03:19,359
talk about when we were chasing the tic
 

4193
01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:19,910
talk about when we were chasing the tic
tac

4194
01:03:19,910 --> 01:03:19,920
tac
 

4195
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,510
tac
so the tic tac's coming up and i'm in

4196
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:21,520
so the tic tac's coming up and i'm in
 

4197
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,029
so the tic tac's coming up and i'm in
about you know and i've been doing this

4198
01:03:23,029 --> 01:03:23,039
about you know and i've been doing this
 

4199
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:23,510
about you know and i've been doing this
for

4200
01:03:23,510 --> 01:03:23,520
for
 

4201
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:26,309
for
at the time 16 years so i'm looking and

4202
01:03:26,309 --> 01:03:26,319
at the time 16 years so i'm looking and
 

4203
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:27,670
at the time 16 years so i'm looking and
i'm going hey i'm here

4204
01:03:27,670 --> 01:03:27,680
i'm going hey i'm here
 

4205
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:28,950
i'm going hey i'm here
he's there on the other side of the

4206
01:03:28,950 --> 01:03:28,960
he's there on the other side of the
 

4207
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:30,309
he's there on the other side of the
circle i'm going to do a vertical

4208
01:03:30,309 --> 01:03:30,319
circle i'm going to do a vertical
 

4209
01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:31,589
circle i'm going to do a vertical
displacement i'm going to go like this

4210
01:03:31,589 --> 01:03:31,599
displacement i'm going to go like this
 

4211
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:33,029
displacement i'm going to go like this
i'm going to cut across a circle and i'm

4212
01:03:33,029 --> 01:03:33,039
i'm going to cut across a circle and i'm
 

4213
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:34,390
i'm going to cut across a circle and i'm
not going to him i'm going out in front

4214
01:03:34,390 --> 01:03:34,400
not going to him i'm going out in front
 

4215
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:35,670
not going to him i'm going out in front
of him i'm going over here

4216
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:35,680
of him i'm going over here
 

4217
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,029
of him i'm going over here
because i know that by the time i get

4218
01:03:37,029 --> 01:03:37,039
because i know that by the time i get
 

4219
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:38,150
because i know that by the time i get
through this maneuver that's where he's

4220
01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:38,160
through this maneuver that's where he's
 

4221
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:39,190
through this maneuver that's where he's
going to be and i'm trying to you know

4222
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:39,200
going to be and i'm trying to you know
 

4223
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,710
going to be and i'm trying to you know
basically join up on him

4224
01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:40,720
basically join up on him
 

4225
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,870
basically join up on him
but i also i also had to look at it to

4226
01:03:42,870 --> 01:03:42,880
but i also i also had to look at it to
 

4227
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:43,990
but i also i also had to look at it to
go do i have enough

4228
01:03:43,990 --> 01:03:44,000
go do i have enough
 

4229
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,029
go do i have enough
altitude to do this because what i

4230
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:45,039
altitude to do this because what i
 

4231
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:46,309
altitude to do this because what i
didn't if we're here and i do this i'm

4232
01:03:46,309 --> 01:03:46,319
didn't if we're here and i do this i'm
 

4233
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:47,510
didn't if we're here and i do this i'm
going to end up over here and he's going

4234
01:03:47,510 --> 01:03:47,520
going to end up over here and he's going
 

4235
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:48,950
going to end up over here and he's going
to be above me and then

4236
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:48,960
to be above me and then
 

4237
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,630
to be above me and then
you know i have to get that energy back

4238
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:50,640
you know i have to get that energy back
 

4239
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:52,309
you know i have to get that energy back
to get up to him and when you're doing a

4240
01:03:52,309 --> 01:03:52,319
to get up to him and when you're doing a
 

4241
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:53,670
to get up to him and when you're doing a
max performance

4242
01:03:53,670 --> 01:03:53,680
max performance
 

4243
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:57,109
max performance
it's a trade so you have this is this is

4244
01:03:57,109 --> 01:03:57,119
it's a trade so you have this is this is
 

4245
01:03:57,119 --> 01:03:58,309
it's a trade so you have this is this is
really important when you're when you're

4246
01:03:58,309 --> 01:03:58,319
really important when you're when you're
 

4247
01:03:58,319 --> 01:03:59,829
really important when you're when you're
fighting airplanes and you're really

4248
01:03:59,829 --> 01:03:59,839
fighting airplanes and you're really
 

4249
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:01,990
fighting airplanes and you're really
max performing so when you go to an air

4250
01:04:01,990 --> 01:04:02,000
max performing so when you go to an air
 

4251
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,829
max performing so when you go to an air
show and you see the air demo

4252
01:04:03,829 --> 01:04:03,839
show and you see the air demo
 

4253
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,510
show and you see the air demo
he's literally playing with it he's got

4254
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:05,520
he's literally playing with it he's got
 

4255
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:06,950
he's literally playing with it he's got
a finite amount of energy

4256
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:06,960
a finite amount of energy
 

4257
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:08,470
a finite amount of energy
right he can add some with the motors

4258
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:08,480
right he can add some with the motors
 

4259
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:09,670
right he can add some with the motors
and stuff but you're what you're really

4260
01:04:09,670 --> 01:04:09,680
and stuff but you're what you're really
 

4261
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,190
and stuff but you're what you're really
doing is it's a trade-off and you can

4262
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:11,200
doing is it's a trade-off and you can
 

4263
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:12,309
doing is it's a trade-off and you can
trade off

4264
01:04:12,309 --> 01:04:12,319
trade off
 

4265
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:14,870
trade off
kinetic energy speed for altitude which

4266
01:04:14,870 --> 01:04:14,880
kinetic energy speed for altitude which
 

4267
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:16,470
kinetic energy speed for altitude which
gives you potential energy

4268
01:04:16,470 --> 01:04:16,480
gives you potential energy
 

4269
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:18,390
gives you potential energy
the other piece is is i can trade some

4270
01:04:18,390 --> 01:04:18,400
the other piece is is i can trade some
 

4271
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,710
the other piece is is i can trade some
of that kinetic energy for performance

4272
01:04:20,710 --> 01:04:20,720
of that kinetic energy for performance
 

4273
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:22,789
of that kinetic energy for performance
because i know if i do a nice easy turn

4274
01:04:22,789 --> 01:04:22,799
because i know if i do a nice easy turn
 

4275
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:23,829
because i know if i do a nice easy turn
the airplane will make it

4276
01:04:23,829 --> 01:04:23,839
the airplane will make it
 

4277
01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:25,829
the airplane will make it
what doesn't bleed energy but i know if

4278
01:04:25,829 --> 01:04:25,839
what doesn't bleed energy but i know if
 

4279
01:04:25,839 --> 01:04:28,710
what doesn't bleed energy but i know if
i do a real tight that 2500 foot split s

4280
01:04:28,710 --> 01:04:28,720
i do a real tight that 2500 foot split s
 

4281
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:30,150
i do a real tight that 2500 foot split s
that it's going to cost me energy so if

4282
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:30,160
that it's going to cost me energy so if
 

4283
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:32,470
that it's going to cost me energy so if
i enter the split s at 200 knots and i

4284
01:04:32,470 --> 01:04:32,480
i enter the split s at 200 knots and i
 

4285
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:33,990
i enter the split s at 200 knots and i
do it right i'm going to come out at the

4286
01:04:33,990 --> 01:04:34,000
do it right i'm going to come out at the
 

4287
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,829
do it right i'm going to come out at the
bottom at probably 200 knots although i

4288
01:04:35,829 --> 01:04:35,839
bottom at probably 200 knots although i
 

4289
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:38,789
bottom at probably 200 knots although i
lost 2500 feet of potential energy

4290
01:04:38,789 --> 01:04:38,799
lost 2500 feet of potential energy
 

4291
01:04:38,799 --> 01:04:41,109
lost 2500 feet of potential energy
i converted that to that to kinetic and

4292
01:04:41,109 --> 01:04:41,119
i converted that to that to kinetic and
 

4293
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:43,109
i converted that to that to kinetic and
that kinetic was transitioned and bled

4294
01:04:43,109 --> 01:04:43,119
that kinetic was transitioned and bled
 

4295
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:43,990
that kinetic was transitioned and bled
off the wings

4296
01:04:43,990 --> 01:04:44,000
off the wings
 

4297
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,109
off the wings
in order for me to get that high

4298
01:04:45,109 --> 01:04:45,119
in order for me to get that high
 

4299
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:46,950
in order for me to get that high
performance turn and you have to

4300
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:46,960
performance turn and you have to
 

4301
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:48,390
performance turn and you have to
constantly

4302
01:04:48,390 --> 01:04:48,400
constantly
 

4303
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,150
constantly
evaluate where you're at and it's your

4304
01:04:50,150 --> 01:04:50,160
evaluate where you're at and it's your
 

4305
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:51,829
evaluate where you're at and it's your
overall energy package

4306
01:04:51,829 --> 01:04:51,839
overall energy package
 

4307
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:53,430
overall energy package
so you can have a guy that's behind you

4308
01:04:53,430 --> 01:04:53,440
so you can have a guy that's behind you
 

4309
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:55,109
so you can have a guy that's behind you
that looks like he's going to kill you

4310
01:04:55,109 --> 01:04:55,119
that looks like he's going to kill you
 

4311
01:04:55,119 --> 01:04:57,190
that looks like he's going to kill you
but if this jet is at 400 knots and this

4312
01:04:57,190 --> 01:04:57,200
but if this jet is at 400 knots and this
 

4313
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:58,789
but if this jet is at 400 knots and this
jet is at 110 knots

this jet's just going to pull away drive
 

4317
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:03,109
this jet's just going to pull away drive
around and kill him in about 30 seconds

4318
01:05:03,109 --> 01:05:03,119
around and kill him in about 30 seconds
 

4319
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:05,270
around and kill him in about 30 seconds
right it's it's overall energy package

4320
01:05:05,270 --> 01:05:05,280
right it's it's overall energy package
 

4321
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:06,470
right it's it's overall energy package
and that's that

4322
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:06,480
and that's that
 

4323
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:08,150
and that's that
you've got to be constantly evaluating

4324
01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:08,160
you've got to be constantly evaluating
 

4325
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,510
you've got to be constantly evaluating
where you're at and this is that 80

01:05:35,589 --> 01:05:35,599

 

4351
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:36,870

you don't history to like from pure

you know skunk works for what that was

4360
01:05:44,789 --> 01:05:44,799
you know skunk works for what that was
 

4361
01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:46,230
you know skunk works for what that was
able to do and when you get into history

4362
01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:46,240
able to do and when you get into history
 

4363
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:47,670
able to do and when you get into history
of it you know how they actually

4364
01:05:47,670 --> 01:05:47,680
of it you know how they actually
 

4365
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:50,950
of it you know how they actually
built uh the cia actually made like

4366

six companies in order to buy the
 

4369
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,069
six companies in order to buy the
titanium from russia

titanium from russia
 

4371
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:55,829
titanium from russia
to bring it back and build an airplane

4372
01:05:55,829 --> 01:05:55,839
to bring it back and build an airplane
 

4373
01:05:55,839 --> 01:05:57,270
to bring it back and build an airplane
out of titanium that we would fly over

4374
01:05:57,270 --> 01:05:57,280
out of titanium that we would fly over
 

4375
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:58,549
out of titanium that we would fly over

to me that's it's an incredible

4378
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:00,240
to me that's it's an incredible
 

4379
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:01,829
to me that's it's an incredible
engineering marvel i think

4380
01:06:01,829 --> 01:06:01,839
engineering marvel i think
 

4381
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:03,829
engineering marvel i think
that like the x-15 you know by the way

4382
01:06:03,829 --> 01:06:03,839
that like the x-15 you know by the way

yeah what's funny when you get into it

4390
01:06:14,710 --> 01:06:14,720
yeah what's funny when you get into it
 

4391
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:15,670
yeah what's funny when you get into it
is it's

4392
01:06:15,670 --> 01:06:15,680
is it's
 

4393
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:18,630
is it's
remember fast is relative and when i say

4394
01:06:18,630 --> 01:06:18,640
remember fast is relative and when i say
 

4395
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:19,910
remember fast is relative and when i say
that i mean

4396
01:06:19,910 --> 01:06:19,920
that i mean
 

4397
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:22,950
that i mean
so if you're going 3 000 miles an hour

4398
01:06:22,950 --> 01:06:22,960
so if you're going 3 000 miles an hour
 

4399
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:26,230
so if you're going 3 000 miles an hour
100 feet above the ground you're going 3

4400
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:26,240
100 feet above the ground you're going 3
 

4401
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:27,750
100 feet above the ground you're going 3
000 miles an hour

4402
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:27,760
000 miles an hour
 

4403
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,270
000 miles an hour
through you know that's how fast you're

4404
01:06:29,270 --> 01:06:29,280
through you know that's how fast you're
 

4405
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,190
through you know that's how fast you're
going when you get up to altitude

4406
01:06:31,190 --> 01:06:31,200
going when you get up to altitude
 

4407
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:32,710
going when you get up to altitude
there's an indicated airspeed and

4408
01:06:32,710 --> 01:06:32,720
there's an indicated airspeed and
 

4409
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:33,190
there's an indicated airspeed and
there's a

4410
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:33,200
there's a
 

4411
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,109
there's a
you know your ground speed so your

4412
01:06:35,109 --> 01:06:35,119
you know your ground speed so your
 

4413
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:36,870
you know your ground speed so your
indicated airspeed is really

4414
01:06:36,870 --> 01:06:36,880
indicated airspeed is really
 

4415
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,549
indicated airspeed is really
how fast the air is going past your

4416
01:06:38,549 --> 01:06:38,559
how fast the air is going past your
 

4417
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:40,069
how fast the air is going past your
airplane well the air is so thin up

4418
01:06:40,069 --> 01:06:40,079
airplane well the air is so thin up
 

4419
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:40,950
airplane well the air is so thin up
there

4420
01:06:40,950 --> 01:06:40,960
there
 

4421
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:44,549
there
you may only be showing like 300 knots

4422
01:06:44,549 --> 01:06:44,559
you may only be showing like 300 knots
 

4423
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:46,549
you may only be showing like 300 knots
but at 300 knots you're really doing

4424
01:06:46,549 --> 01:06:46,559
but at 300 knots you're really doing
 

4425
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:49,670
but at 300 knots you're really doing
2500 miles an hour over the ground so

4426
01:06:49,670 --> 01:06:49,680
2500 miles an hour over the ground so
 

4427
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:50,630
2500 miles an hour over the ground so
you know like we would take the

4428
01:06:50,630 --> 01:06:50,640
you know like we would take the
 

4429
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,789
you know like we would take the
airplanes up to 50 000 feet when we had

4430
01:06:52,789 --> 01:06:52,799
airplanes up to 50 000 feet when we had
 

4431
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:53,190
airplanes up to 50 000 feet when we had
to do

4432
01:06:53,190 --> 01:06:53,200
to do
 

4433
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,789
to do
full the maintenance check flights on

4434
01:06:54,789 --> 01:06:54,799
full the maintenance check flights on
 

4435
01:06:54,799 --> 01:06:57,029
full the maintenance check flights on
them so when you're doing 200

4436
01:06:57,029 --> 01:06:57,039
them so when you're doing 200
 

4437
01:06:57,039 --> 01:06:58,870
them so when you're doing 200
you know and you know some mod notch

4438
01:06:58,870 --> 01:06:58,880
you know and you know some mod notch
 

4439
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:01,029
you know and you know some mod notch
it's actually slow for the airplane it's

4440
01:07:01,029 --> 01:07:01,039
it's actually slow for the airplane it's
 

4441
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:02,549
it's actually slow for the airplane it's
you know you're getting you know it's

4442
01:07:02,549 --> 01:07:02,559
you know you're getting you know it's
 

4443
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:03,990
you know you're getting you know it's
kind of like it's not you know there's

4444
01:07:03,990 --> 01:07:04,000
kind of like it's not you know there's
 

4445
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:04,950
kind of like it's not you know there's
maneuvering speeds

4446
01:07:04,950 --> 01:07:04,960
maneuvering speeds
 

4447
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:06,230
maneuvering speeds
you know that if i hit a certain speed

4448
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:06,240
you know that if i hit a certain speed
 

4449
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:08,150
you know that if i hit a certain speed
and a super hornet that i have the full

4450
01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:08,160
and a super hornet that i have the full
 

4451
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:09,510
and a super hornet that i have the full
capability of the airfoil

4452
01:07:09,510 --> 01:07:09,520
capability of the airfoil
 

4453
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:11,190
capability of the airfoil
if i'm below that speed i'm going to

4454
01:07:11,190 --> 01:07:11,200
if i'm below that speed i'm going to
 

4455
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:12,870
if i'm below that speed i'm going to
stall the airfoil before i get to the

4456
01:07:12,870 --> 01:07:12,880
stall the airfoil before i get to the
 

4457
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,470
stall the airfoil before i get to the
maximum g

4458
01:07:14,470 --> 01:07:14,480
maximum g
 

4459
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:17,109
maximum g
okay so when you look at something like

4460
01:07:17,109 --> 01:07:17,119
okay so when you look at something like
 

4461
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:17,670
okay so when you look at something like
that you go

4462
01:07:17,670 --> 01:07:17,680
that you go
 

4463
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:20,069
that you go
is it really going fast and when you

4464
01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:20,079
is it really going fast and when you
 

4465
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:22,069
is it really going fast and when you
look at an sr 71 that's flying upwards

4466
01:07:22,069 --> 01:07:22,079
look at an sr 71 that's flying upwards
 

4467
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:22,789
look at an sr 71 that's flying upwards
of you know

4468
01:07:22,789 --> 01:07:22,799
of you know
 

4469
01:07:22,799 --> 01:07:25,589
of you know
70 plus thousand feet the air so thin

4470
01:07:25,589 --> 01:07:25,599
70 plus thousand feet the air so thin
 

4471
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:27,349
70 plus thousand feet the air so thin
you know just like the x15 you can get

4472
01:07:27,349 --> 01:07:27,359
you know just like the x15 you can get
 

4473
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:28,150
you know just like the x15 you can get
to a much higher

4474
01:07:28,150 --> 01:07:28,160
to a much higher
 

4475
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:30,230
to a much higher
speed but the relative speed of the air

4476
01:07:30,230 --> 01:07:30,240
speed but the relative speed of the air
 

4477
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:31,829
speed but the relative speed of the air
going over you is actually relatively

4478
01:07:31,829 --> 01:07:31,839
going over you is actually relatively
 

4479
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:32,390
going over you is actually relatively
low

4480
01:07:32,390 --> 01:07:32,400
low
 

4481
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:33,910
low
so the stresses on the airframe are not

4482
01:07:33,910 --> 01:07:33,920
so the stresses on the airframe are not
 

4483
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,990
so the stresses on the airframe are not
like they would be if you were down low

4484
01:07:35,990 --> 01:07:36,000
like they would be if you were down low
 

4485
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,910
like they would be if you were down low
but because you're going fast to get

4486
01:07:37,910 --> 01:07:37,920
but because you're going fast to get
 

4487
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:39,589
but because you're going fast to get
enough air over your ketostatic system

4488
01:07:39,589 --> 01:07:39,599
enough air over your ketostatic system
 

4489
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:41,029
enough air over your ketostatic system
to show that you're going 300 knots

4490
01:07:41,029 --> 01:07:41,039
to show that you're going 300 knots
 

4491
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:43,270
to show that you're going 300 knots
you're you're screaming

4492
01:07:43,270 --> 01:07:43,280
you're you're screaming
 

4493
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:45,190
you're you're screaming
i mean the fastest i ever got was i was

4494
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:45,200
i mean the fastest i ever got was i was
 

4495
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:46,470
i mean the fastest i ever got was i was
with the

4496
01:07:46,470 --> 01:07:46,480
with the
 

4497
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:49,029
with the
uh well soon to be vice admiral white so

4498
01:07:49,029 --> 01:07:49,039
uh well soon to be vice admiral white so
 

4499
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:51,430
uh well soon to be vice admiral white so
we had taken a check flight and uh

4500
01:07:51,430 --> 01:07:51,440
we had taken a check flight and uh
 

4501
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:54,390
we had taken a check flight and uh
and i got it up to 1.78 i got a super

4502
01:07:54,390 --> 01:07:54,400
and i got it up to 1.78 i got a super
 

4503
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:56,390
and i got it up to 1.78 i got a super
horn up to mach 1.78 and it was

4504
01:07:56,390 --> 01:07:56,400
horn up to mach 1.78 and it was
 

4505
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:57,829
horn up to mach 1.78 and it was
and we were started by pebble beach too

4506
01:07:57,829 --> 01:07:57,839
and we were started by pebble beach too
 

4507
01:07:57,839 --> 01:08:00,150
and we were started by pebble beach too
and then it what's that feel like or is

4508
01:08:00,150 --> 01:08:00,160
and then it what's that feel like or is
 

4509
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:01,109
and then it what's that feel like or is
it

4510
01:08:01,109 --> 01:08:01,119
it
 

4511
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:02,789
it
when you get that fast it start to me it

4512
01:08:02,789 --> 01:08:02,799
when you get that fast it start to me it
 

4513
01:08:02,799 --> 01:08:03,990
when you get that fast it start to me it
got a little bit weird because you

4514
01:08:03,990 --> 01:08:04,000
got a little bit weird because you
 

4515
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:04,710
got a little bit weird because you
realize

4516
01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:04,720
realize
 

4517
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:07,670
realize
in your brain and i did that there's no

4518
01:08:07,670 --> 01:08:07,680
in your brain and i did that there's no
 

4519
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:07,990
in your brain and i did that there's no
out

4520
01:08:07,990 --> 01:08:08,000
out
 

4521
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,470
out
if something happens i can't eject the

4522
01:08:10,470 --> 01:08:10,480
if something happens i can't eject the
 

4523
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:11,750
if something happens i can't eject the
ejection would kill me

4524
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:11,760
ejection would kill me
 

4525
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:13,270
ejection would kill me
isn't that kind of liberating in a way

4526
01:08:13,270 --> 01:08:13,280
isn't that kind of liberating in a way
 

4527
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:15,430
isn't that kind of liberating in a way
um or no that

4528
01:08:15,430 --> 01:08:15,440
um or no that
 

4529
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:17,189
um or no that
okay maybe not i always want to push the

4530
01:08:17,189 --> 01:08:17,199
okay maybe not i always want to push the
 

4531
01:08:17,199 --> 01:08:18,550
okay maybe not i always want to push the
limit you know it's like how fast i

4532
01:08:18,550 --> 01:08:18,560
limit you know it's like how fast i
 

4533
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:19,669
limit you know it's like how fast i
could have got it going faster

4534
01:08:19,669 --> 01:08:19,679
could have got it going faster
 

4535
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:20,789
could have got it going faster
it was it was literally still

4536
01:08:20,789 --> 01:08:20,799
it was it was literally still
 

4537
01:08:20,799 --> 01:08:22,550
it was it was literally still

01:08:22,550 --> 01:08:22,560
accelerating when i stopped but i had it
 

4539
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:23,990

was fuel limited

4540
01:08:23,990 --> 01:08:24,000
was fuel limited
 

4541
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,550
was fuel limited
and space limited because i you know i'm

4542
01:08:26,550 --> 01:08:26,560
and space limited because i you know i'm
 

4543
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,229
and space limited because i you know i'm
off the coast of california

4544
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:28,239
off the coast of california
 

4545
01:08:28,239 --> 01:08:29,829
off the coast of california
big sur and i'm going and i can see

4546
01:08:29,829 --> 01:08:29,839
big sur and i'm going and i can see
 

4547
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:31,510
big sur and i'm going and i can see
pebble beach out in the distance uh you

4548
01:08:31,510 --> 01:08:31,520
pebble beach out in the distance uh you
 

4549
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,349
pebble beach out in the distance uh you
know the whole monterey peninsula just

4550
01:08:33,349 --> 01:08:33,359
know the whole monterey peninsula just
 

4551
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:33,990
know the whole monterey peninsula just
going

4552
01:08:33,990 --> 01:08:34,000
going
 

4553
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,309
going
and you're doing almost 18 miles a

4554
01:08:36,309 --> 01:08:36,319
and you're doing almost 18 miles a
 

4555
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:38,470
and you're doing almost 18 miles a
minute i mean you're screaming

4556
01:08:38,470 --> 01:08:38,480
minute i mean you're screaming
 

4557
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:40,550
minute i mean you're screaming
yeah i mean that's and then you have to

4558
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:40,560
yeah i mean that's and then you have to
 

4559
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:41,829
yeah i mean that's and then you have to
turn well the airplane didn't have

4560
01:08:41,829 --> 01:08:41,839
turn well the airplane didn't have
 

4561
01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:43,110
turn well the airplane didn't have
anything on it it was a slicked-off

4562
01:08:43,110 --> 01:08:43,120
anything on it it was a slicked-off
 

4563
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,470
anything on it it was a slicked-off
super hornet so it was basically just

4564
01:08:44,470 --> 01:08:44,480
super hornet so it was basically just
 

4565
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:46,229
super hornet so it was basically just
the airplane no pylons no pods no

4566
01:08:46,229 --> 01:08:46,239
the airplane no pylons no pods no
 

4567
01:08:46,239 --> 01:08:47,269
the airplane no pylons no pods no
nothing

4568
01:08:47,269 --> 01:08:47,279
nothing
 

4569
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:48,630
nothing
and then we had to get it turned around

4570
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:48,640
and then we had to get it turned around
 

4571
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:49,910
and then we had to get it turned around
because we got to go to the exit point

4572
01:08:49,910 --> 01:08:49,920
because we got to go to the exit point
 

4573
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:50,950
because we got to go to the exit point
for the area and i'm trying to get it

4574
01:08:50,950 --> 01:08:50,960
for the area and i'm trying to get it
 

4575
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:51,749
for the area and i'm trying to get it
down below

4576
01:08:51,749 --> 01:08:51,759
down below
 

4577
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:54,070
down below
to subsonic and there's a bunch of

4578
01:08:54,070 --> 01:08:54,080
to subsonic and there's a bunch of
 

4579
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:55,910
to subsonic and there's a bunch of
things that are disabled like the speed

4580
01:08:55,910 --> 01:08:55,920
things that are disabled like the speed
 

4581
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,269
things that are disabled like the speed
brakes that normally we pop out when

4582
01:08:57,269 --> 01:08:57,279
brakes that normally we pop out when
 

4583
01:08:57,279 --> 01:08:58,550
brakes that normally we pop out when
you're going that fast they don't

4584
01:08:58,550 --> 01:08:58,560
you're going that fast they don't
 

4585
01:08:58,560 --> 01:08:59,669
you're going that fast they don't
because the super hornet really doesn't

4586
01:08:59,669 --> 01:08:59,679
because the super hornet really doesn't
 

4587
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:00,870
because the super hornet really doesn't
have speed brakes it

4588
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:00,880
have speed brakes it
 

4589
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:03,990
have speed brakes it
deforms the flight controls they don't

4590
01:09:03,990 --> 01:09:04,000
deforms the flight controls they don't
 

4591
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,349
deforms the flight controls they don't
function so you really

4592
01:09:05,349 --> 01:09:05,359
function so you really
 

4593
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:06,709
function so you really
you're trying to maneuver and when

4594
01:09:06,709 --> 01:09:06,719
you're trying to maneuver and when
 

4595
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:08,550
you're trying to maneuver and when
you're going that fast you can't turn

4596
01:09:08,550 --> 01:09:08,560
you're going that fast you can't turn
 

4597
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:09,590
you're going that fast you can't turn
because a 7g

4598
01:09:09,590 --> 01:09:09,600
because a 7g
 

4599
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:13,749
because a 7g
turn at 1.5 mach is a pretty big turn

4600
01:09:13,749 --> 01:09:13,759
turn at 1.5 mach is a pretty big turn
 

4601
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:16,390
turn at 1.5 mach is a pretty big turn
um so it's just it's crazy it's

4602
01:09:16,390 --> 01:09:16,400
um so it's just it's crazy it's
 

4603
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:18,550
um so it's just it's crazy it's
incredible that a human can do this

4604
01:09:18,550 --> 01:09:18,560
incredible that a human can do this
 

4605
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:21,030
incredible that a human can do this
yes uh human can engineer that the

4606
01:09:21,030 --> 01:09:21,040
yes uh human can engineer that the
 

4607
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,789
yes uh human can engineer that the
system which allows another human to

4608
01:09:22,789 --> 01:09:22,799
system which allows another human to
 

4609
01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:24,229
system which allows another human to
control that system

4610
01:09:24,229 --> 01:09:24,239
control that system
 

4611
01:09:24,239 --> 01:09:27,590
control that system
it's to me it's it's uh i think it's

4612
01:09:27,590 --> 01:09:27,600
it's to me it's it's uh i think it's
 

4613
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:29,349
it's to me it's it's uh i think it's
just it's one it's a great experience

4614
01:09:29,349 --> 01:09:29,359
just it's one it's a great experience
 

4615
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:31,590
just it's one it's a great experience
was it sad to see the sr-71 go

4616
01:09:31,590 --> 01:09:31,600
was it sad to see the sr-71 go
 

4617
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:34,470
was it sad to see the sr-71 go
i think it was during your career i mean

4618
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:34,480
i think it was during your career i mean
 

4619
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:35,910
i think it was during your career i mean
do you do you guys romanticize the

4620
01:09:35,910 --> 01:09:35,920
do you do you guys romanticize the
 

4621
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:37,269
do you do you guys romanticize the
different planes

4622
01:09:37,269 --> 01:09:37,279
different planes
 

4623
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:38,789
different planes
um we would see it flying when i was

4624
01:09:38,789 --> 01:09:38,799
um we would see it flying when i was
 

4625
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:40,550
um we would see it flying when i was
flying hornets because we i

4626
01:09:40,550 --> 01:09:40,560
flying hornets because we i
 

4627
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:42,550
flying hornets because we i
the west coast flies in it's called

4628
01:09:42,550 --> 01:09:42,560
the west coast flies in it's called
 

4629
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:44,870
the west coast flies in it's called
r2508 which is covers the

4630
01:09:44,870 --> 01:09:44,880
r2508 which is covers the
 

4631
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,349
r2508 which is covers the
navy china lake area and edwards it's a

4632
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:47,359
navy china lake area and edwards it's a
 

4633
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:48,229
navy china lake area and edwards it's a
huge area it's

4634
01:09:48,229 --> 01:09:48,239
huge area it's
 

4635
01:09:48,239 --> 01:09:49,590
huge area it's
it's actually i think the we had a guy

4636
01:09:49,590 --> 01:09:49,600
it's actually i think the we had a guy
 

4637
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:50,870
it's actually i think the we had a guy
from switzerland come out because they

4638
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:50,880
from switzerland come out because they
 

4639
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,229
from switzerland come out because they
were they had hornets and he's like this

4640
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:52,239
were they had hornets and he's like this
 

4641
01:09:52,239 --> 01:09:53,990
were they had hornets and he's like this
is bigger than our whole country

4642
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:54,000
is bigger than our whole country
 

4643
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,030
is bigger than our whole country
because it's a pretty big area in

4644
01:09:55,030 --> 01:09:55,040
because it's a pretty big area in
 

4645
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:57,110
because it's a pretty big area in
california that you fly

4646
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:57,120
california that you fly
 

4647
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:58,709
california that you fly
but you would see the sr-71s they had a

4648
01:09:58,709 --> 01:09:58,719
but you would see the sr-71s they had a
 

4649
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:00,390
but you would see the sr-71s they had a
loop because nasa was flying them

4650
01:10:00,390 --> 01:10:00,400
loop because nasa was flying them
 

4651
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,310
loop because nasa was flying them
out of palmdale and they would take off

4652
01:10:02,310 --> 01:10:02,320
out of palmdale and they would take off
 

4653
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:03,430
out of palmdale and they would take off
and they'd go up towards washington

4654
01:10:03,430 --> 01:10:03,440
and they'd go up towards washington
 

4655
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:03,910
and they'd go up towards washington
state

4656
01:10:03,910 --> 01:10:03,920
state
 

4657
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:05,510
state
and montana and they do a loop and so

4658
01:10:05,510 --> 01:10:05,520
and montana and they do a loop and so
 

4659
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:06,790
and montana and they do a loop and so
you'd see them coming back down they'd

4660
01:10:06,790 --> 01:10:06,800
you'd see them coming back down they'd
 

4661
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,630
you'd see them coming back down they'd
descend out of you know above 60 000

4662
01:10:08,630 --> 01:10:08,640
descend out of you know above 60 000
 

4663
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:10,149
descend out of you know above 60 000
you'd see them you they get contrails

4664
01:10:10,149 --> 01:10:10,159
you'd see them you they get contrails
 

4665
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:10,870
you'd see them you they get contrails
you know the white

4666
01:10:10,870 --> 01:10:10,880
you know the white
 

4667
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:12,550
you know the white
lines behind airplanes they'd come down

4668
01:10:12,550 --> 01:10:12,560
lines behind airplanes they'd come down
 

4669
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:14,149
lines behind airplanes they'd come down
and hit the tanker and they'd go back up

4670
01:10:14,149 --> 01:10:14,159
and hit the tanker and they'd go back up
 

4671
01:10:14,159 --> 01:10:14,709
and hit the tanker and they'd go back up
so

4672
01:10:14,709 --> 01:10:14,719
so
 

4673
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:16,070
so
it was cool to be able to see them in my

4674
01:10:16,070 --> 01:10:16,080
it was cool to be able to see them in my
 

4675
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:18,070
it was cool to be able to see them in my
lifetime flying uh

4676
01:10:18,070 --> 01:10:18,080
lifetime flying uh
 

4677
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:21,910
lifetime flying uh
but uh you know i think with money

4678
01:10:21,910 --> 01:10:21,920
but uh you know i think with money
 

4679
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:26,310
but uh you know i think with money
age um the advent of satellites

4680
01:10:26,310 --> 01:10:26,320
age um the advent of satellites
 

4681
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:27,910
age um the advent of satellites
you know because they're everywhere now

4682
01:10:27,910 --> 01:10:27,920
you know because they're everywhere now
 

4683
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,030
you know because they're everywhere now
i mean you've got commercial companies

4684
01:10:29,030 --> 01:10:29,040
i mean you've got commercial companies
 

4685
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:30,550
i mean you've got commercial companies
putting satellites up

4686
01:10:30,550 --> 01:10:30,560
putting satellites up
 

4687
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,630
putting satellites up
uh how much of that need was really

4688
01:10:32,630 --> 01:10:32,640
uh how much of that need was really
 

4689
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:33,669
uh how much of that need was really
there because you gotta remember when

4690
01:10:33,669 --> 01:10:33,679
there because you gotta remember when
 

4691
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:35,270
there because you gotta remember when
those things started in the 50s sputnik

4692
01:10:35,270 --> 01:10:35,280
those things started in the 50s sputnik
 

4693
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:36,630
those things started in the 50s sputnik
wasn't flying around

4694
01:10:36,630 --> 01:10:36,640
wasn't flying around
 

4695
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,070
wasn't flying around
you know it was it was the u2 and the

4696
01:10:38,070 --> 01:10:38,080
you know it was it was the u2 and the
 

4697
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:39,590
you know it was it was the u2 and the
sr-71 that were out there doing that

4698
01:10:39,590 --> 01:10:39,600
sr-71 that were out there doing that
 

4699
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:40,390
sr-71 that were out there doing that
work

4700
01:10:40,390 --> 01:10:40,400
work
 

4701
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:43,510
work
um so at the time it was needed it was

4702
01:10:43,510 --> 01:10:43,520
um so at the time it was needed it was
 

4703
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:44,870
um so at the time it was needed it was
at the if you think about it really it

4704
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:44,880
at the if you think about it really it
 

4705
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,390
at the if you think about it really it
was an incredible feat of aviation for

4706
01:10:46,390 --> 01:10:46,400
was an incredible feat of aviation for
 

4707
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:47,189
was an incredible feat of aviation for
that time

4708
01:10:47,189 --> 01:10:47,199
that time
 

4709
01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:49,510
that time
yeah i mean literally we have yet to

4710
01:10:49,510 --> 01:10:49,520
yeah i mean literally we have yet to
 

4711
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:51,110
yeah i mean literally we have yet to
pass that and you also ask well is there

4712
01:10:51,110 --> 01:10:51,120
pass that and you also ask well is there
 

4713
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:52,470
pass that and you also ask well is there
a need to pass that i go i don't know we

4714
01:10:52,470 --> 01:10:52,480
a need to pass that i go i don't know we
 

4715
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:52,790
a need to pass that i go i don't know we
got

4716
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:52,800
got
 

4717
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:55,189
got
stuff in space so do we need to make an

4718
01:10:55,189 --> 01:10:55,199
stuff in space so do we need to make an
 

4719
01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:56,790
stuff in space so do we need to make an
airplane that goes that fast

4720
01:10:56,790 --> 01:10:56,800
airplane that goes that fast
 

4721
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:58,630
airplane that goes that fast
i think the next one is you get into the

4722
01:10:58,630 --> 01:10:58,640
i think the next one is you get into the
 

4723
01:10:58,640 --> 01:10:59,990
i think the next one is you get into the
hypersonics where you don't have to put

4724
01:10:59,990 --> 01:11:00,000
hypersonics where you don't have to put
 

4725
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,510
hypersonics where you don't have to put
a person in it does all kinds of crazy

4726
01:11:01,510 --> 01:11:01,520
a person in it does all kinds of crazy
 

4727
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:03,110
a person in it does all kinds of crazy
stuff you know the work with automation

4728
01:11:03,110 --> 01:11:03,120
stuff you know the work with automation
 

4729
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:03,910
stuff you know the work with automation
all that kind of stuff

4730
01:11:03,910 --> 01:11:03,920
all that kind of stuff
 

4731
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:07,270
all that kind of stuff
yeah so one of the reasons i wanted to

4732
01:11:07,270 --> 01:11:07,280
yeah so one of the reasons i wanted to
 

4733
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:08,390
yeah so one of the reasons i wanted to
talk to you

4734
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:08,400
talk to you
 

4735
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:11,189
talk to you
is you happen to be one of at least in

4736
01:11:11,189 --> 01:11:11,199

feet with speed of uh with what's i
 

4799
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:22,149
feet with speed of uh with what's i
guess is considered a low speed of 120

the degree of weirdness
but uh the differences is

there's a mystery to it
 

4899
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:21,510
there's a mystery to it
but it's in some sense this is a quite

without much resolution to the mystery
 

4905
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:30,070
without much resolution to the mystery
and it's fascinating and there's

uh what is it i i unidentified
aerial phenomena so can you

4920
01:14:47,030 --> 01:14:47,040
aerial phenomena so can you
 

4921
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:49,110
aerial phenomena so can you
maybe correct me on any of the things

4922
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:49,120
maybe correct me on any of the things
 

4923
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:51,350
maybe correct me on any of the things
i've gotten wrong elaborate on some key

4924
01:14:51,350 --> 01:14:51,360
i've gotten wrong elaborate on some key
 

4925
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:51,910
i've gotten wrong elaborate on some key
things

4926
01:14:51,910 --> 01:14:51,920
things
 

4927
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,990
things
and describe that experience in general

4928
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:54,000
and describe that experience in general
 

4929
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,750
and describe that experience in general
so here's what i know so yeah

so here's what i know so yeah
 

4931
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:59,510
so here's what i know so yeah
we went out uh on our mission to go

4932
01:14:59,510 --> 01:14:59,520
we went out uh on our mission to go
 

4933
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:03,189
we went out uh on our mission to go
train uh and they canceled the mission

4934
01:15:03,189 --> 01:15:03,199
train uh and they canceled the mission
 

4935
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:04,310
train uh and they canceled the mission
and they set us down there's all kinds

4936
01:15:04,310 --> 01:15:04,320
and they set us down there's all kinds
 

4937
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:06,310
and they set us down there's all kinds
of rumors out here there's all kinds of

4938
01:15:06,310 --> 01:15:06,320
of rumors out here there's all kinds of
 

4939
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:08,310
of rumors out here there's all kinds of
after this has come out so originally it

4940
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:08,320
after this has come out so originally it
 

4941
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:09,430
after this has come out so originally it
was the four of us

4942
01:15:09,430 --> 01:15:09,440
was the four of us
 

4943
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,590
was the four of us
there's two jets two people in each jet

4944
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:11,600
there's two jets two people in each jet
 

4945
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,430
there's two jets two people in each jet
their f-18s

4946
01:15:13,430 --> 01:15:13,440
their f-18s
 

4947
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:16,709
their f-18s
okay there is no video from

4948
01:15:16,709 --> 01:15:16,719
okay there is no video from
 

4949
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:18,550
okay there is no video from
our event it was all four sets of

4950
01:15:18,550 --> 01:15:18,560
our event it was all four sets of
 

4951
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:19,910
our event it was all four sets of
eyeballs staring at this thing and then

4952
01:15:19,910 --> 01:15:19,920
eyeballs staring at this thing and then
 

4953
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:21,430
eyeballs staring at this thing and then
when we came back and told it

4954
01:15:21,430 --> 01:15:21,440
when we came back and told it
 

4955
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:23,750
when we came back and told it
when chad and his pilot took off that's

4956
01:15:23,750 --> 01:15:23,760
when chad and his pilot took off that's
 

4957
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:25,110
when chad and his pilot took off that's
when chad got the video of it

4958
01:15:25,110 --> 01:15:25,120
when chad got the video of it
 

4959
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:26,950
when chad got the video of it
and we're like that's it that's exactly

4960
01:15:26,950 --> 01:15:26,960
and we're like that's it that's exactly
 

4961
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:29,189
and we're like that's it that's exactly
that's it and um

4962
01:15:29,189 --> 01:15:29,199
that's it and um
 

4963
01:15:29,199 --> 01:15:30,709
that's it and um
so when you say eyeballs you mean

4964
01:15:30,709 --> 01:15:30,719
so when you say eyeballs you mean
 

4965
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:32,790
so when you say eyeballs you mean
literally your eyes are seeing a thing

4966
01:15:32,790 --> 01:15:32,800
literally your eyes are seeing a thing
 

4967
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,950
literally your eyes are seeing a thing
yeah so so as we're flying out we get we

4968
01:15:34,950 --> 01:15:34,960
yeah so so as we're flying out we get we
 

4969
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:36,390
yeah so so as we're flying out we get we
get vectored they come up and tell us

4970
01:15:36,390 --> 01:15:36,400
get vectored they come up and tell us
 

4971
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:37,430
get vectored they come up and tell us
hey we're gonna cancel training this is

4972
01:15:37,430 --> 01:15:37,440
hey we're gonna cancel training this is
 

4973
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:39,270
hey we're gonna cancel training this is
the uss princeton so this is the siege's

4974
01:15:39,270 --> 01:15:39,280
the uss princeton so this is the siege's
 

4975
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:40,149
the uss princeton so this is the siege's
cruiser

4976
01:15:40,149 --> 01:15:40,159
cruiser
 

4977
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:44,229
cruiser
so we're talking to one controller um

4978
01:15:44,229 --> 01:15:44,239
so we're talking to one controller um
 

4979
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:47,189
so we're talking to one controller um
who is like hey sir first you ask what

4980
01:15:47,189 --> 01:15:47,199
who is like hey sir first you ask what
 

4981
01:15:47,199 --> 01:15:48,470
who is like hey sir first you ask what
ordinance we have on board and i laugh

4982
01:15:48,470 --> 01:15:48,480
ordinance we have on board and i laugh
 

4983
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:49,830
ordinance we have on board and i laugh
because we don't carry live ordinance in

4984
01:15:49,830 --> 01:15:49,840
because we don't carry live ordinance in
 

4985
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:51,430
because we don't carry live ordinance in
training typically because batch

4986
01:15:51,430 --> 01:15:51,440
training typically because batch
 

4987
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:53,030
training typically because batch
stuff happens usually someone forgets to

4988
01:15:53,030 --> 01:15:53,040
stuff happens usually someone forgets to
 

4989
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:54,470
stuff happens usually someone forgets to
put a switch on and then the missile

4990
01:15:54,470 --> 01:15:54,480
put a switch on and then the missile
 

4991
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:56,229
put a switch on and then the missile
comes off and hits a good airplane and

4992
01:15:56,229 --> 01:15:56,239
comes off and hits a good airplane and
 

4993
01:15:56,239 --> 01:15:58,709
comes off and hits a good airplane and
it's not good so we had what's called a

4994
01:15:58,709 --> 01:15:58,719
it's not good so we had what's called a
 

4995
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:00,709
it's not good so we had what's called a
catom9 which is really just a blue tube

4996
01:16:00,709 --> 01:16:00,719
catom9 which is really just a blue tube
 

4997
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:01,270
catom9 which is really just a blue tube
with the

4998
01:16:01,270 --> 01:16:01,280
with the
 

4999
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:02,870
with the
aim 9 seeker on the front of it which is

5000
01:16:02,870 --> 01:16:02,880
aim 9 seeker on the front of it which is
 

5001
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:05,270
aim 9 seeker on the front of it which is
an ir missile

5002
01:16:05,270 --> 01:16:05,280
an ir missile
 

5003
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:06,550
an ir missile
so there's only two ways to get it off

5004
01:16:06,550 --> 01:16:06,560
so there's only two ways to get it off
 

5005
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:07,830
so there's only two ways to get it off
you can beat it off with a sledgehammer

5006
01:16:07,830 --> 01:16:07,840
you can beat it off with a sledgehammer
 

5007
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:09,110
you can beat it off with a sledgehammer
you can take this thing and so

5008
01:16:09,110 --> 01:16:09,120
you can take this thing and so
 

5009
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:10,630
you can take this thing and so
you put a wrench in and it unlocks the

5010
01:16:10,630 --> 01:16:10,640
you put a wrench in and it unlocks the
 

5011
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:11,990
you put a wrench in and it unlocks the
lugs and pulls the lugs back in that

5012
01:16:11,990 --> 01:16:12,000
lugs and pulls the lugs back in that
 

5013
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:12,950
lugs and pulls the lugs back in that
hold it on

5014
01:16:12,950 --> 01:16:12,960
hold it on
 

5015
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:14,630
hold it on
when it really fires the impulse from

5016
01:16:14,630 --> 01:16:14,640
when it really fires the impulse from
 

5017
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:16,470
when it really fires the impulse from
the engine actually throws the lugs

5018
01:16:16,470 --> 01:16:16,480
the engine actually throws the lugs
 

5019
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:17,830
the engine actually throws the lugs
forward and breaks that release and it

5020
01:16:17,830 --> 01:16:17,840
forward and breaks that release and it
 

5021
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,030
forward and breaks that release and it
comes off down the rail

5022
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:19,040
comes off down the rail
 

5023
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:22,070
comes off down the rail
that's how it works so they said hey

5024
01:16:22,070 --> 01:16:22,080
that's how it works so they said hey
 

5025
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:22,550
that's how it works so they said hey
well

5026
01:16:22,550 --> 01:16:22,560
well
 

5027
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:24,709
well
we have real world tasking so as we're

5028
01:16:24,709 --> 01:16:24,719
we have real world tasking so as we're
 

5029
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:26,310
we have real world tasking so as we're
going out

5030
01:16:26,310 --> 01:16:26,320
going out
 

5031
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:29,510
going out
my wingmen the other pilot she maneuvers

5032
01:16:29,510 --> 01:16:29,520
my wingmen the other pilot she maneuvers
 

5033
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,189
my wingmen the other pilot she maneuvers
the airplane to the left-hand side

5034
01:16:31,189 --> 01:16:31,199
the airplane to the left-hand side
 

5035
01:16:31,199 --> 01:16:32,950
the airplane to the left-hand side
of me so she's kind of stepped up like

5036
01:16:32,950 --> 01:16:32,960
of me so she's kind of stepped up like
 

5037
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:35,350
of me so she's kind of stepped up like
this and i'll use your mic box

5038
01:16:35,350 --> 01:16:35,360
this and i'll use your mic box
 

5039
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:37,350
this and i'll use your mic box
to start since we're going out they're

5040
01:16:37,350 --> 01:16:37,360
to start since we're going out they're
 

5041
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:38,950
to start since we're going out they're
calling ranges they're called bra calls

5042
01:16:38,950 --> 01:16:38,960
calling ranges they're called bra calls
 

5043
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:40,310
calling ranges they're called bra calls
bearing range in altitude and they're

5044
01:16:40,310 --> 01:16:40,320
bearing range in altitude and they're
 

5045
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:41,430
bearing range in altitude and they're
telling us hey

5046
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:41,440
telling us hey
 

5047
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:44,070
telling us hey
it's at 40 miles or 50 miles and 40

5048
01:16:44,070 --> 01:16:44,080
it's at 40 miles or 50 miles and 40
 

5049
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:45,830
it's at 40 miles or 50 miles and 40
miles and 30 miles so they're saying

5050
01:16:45,830 --> 01:16:45,840
miles and 30 miles so they're saying
 

5051
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:49,590
miles and 30 miles so they're saying
hey 270 30 20 000. that's all i say

5052
01:16:49,590 --> 01:16:49,600
hey 270 30 20 000. that's all i say
 

5053
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,669
hey 270 30 20 000. that's all i say
so we got our radars we had we had

5054
01:16:51,669 --> 01:16:51,679
so we got our radars we had we had
 

5055
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:53,350
so we got our radars we had we had
mechanically scanned radars at the time

5056
01:16:53,350 --> 01:16:53,360
mechanically scanned radars at the time
 

5057
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:56,390
mechanically scanned radars at the time
apg-73 good piece of gear

5058
01:16:56,390 --> 01:16:56,400
apg-73 good piece of gear
 

5059
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:59,030
apg-73 good piece of gear
apg-79 new one's way better but anyway

5060
01:16:59,030 --> 01:16:59,040
apg-79 new one's way better but anyway
 

5061
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:01,030
apg-79 new one's way better but anyway
and i apologize if i interrupt the story

5062
01:17:01,030 --> 01:17:01,040
and i apologize if i interrupt the story
 

5063
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:03,669
and i apologize if i interrupt the story
uh hopefully it's useful but they're

5064
01:17:03,669 --> 01:17:03,679
uh hopefully it's useful but they're
 

5065
01:17:03,679 --> 01:17:05,189
uh hopefully it's useful but they're
telling you a location of a thing that

5066
01:17:05,189 --> 01:17:05,199
telling you a location of a thing that
 

5067
01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:06,070
telling you a location of a thing that
you should look at

5068
01:17:06,070 --> 01:17:06,080
you should look at
 

5069
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:07,270
you should look at
yep they're telling us they have a

5070
01:17:07,270 --> 01:17:07,280
yep they're telling us they have a
 

5071
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:08,709
yep they're telling us they have a
contact on their radar they don't know

5072
01:17:08,709 --> 01:17:08,719
contact on their radar they don't know
 

5073
01:17:08,719 --> 01:17:09,990
contact on their radar they don't know
what it is they just have a blip

5074
01:17:09,990 --> 01:17:10,000
what it is they just have a blip
 

5075
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,750
what it is they just have a blip
they have a little blip well they've

5076
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:11,760
they have a little blip well they've
 

5077
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:13,030
they have a little blip well they've
been watching these things and what he

5078
01:17:13,030 --> 01:17:13,040
been watching these things and what he
 

5079
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:13,750
been watching these things and what he
told me is

5080
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:13,760
told me is
 

5081
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:14,870
told me is
they had been looking at these things as

5082
01:17:14,870 --> 01:17:14,880
they had been looking at these things as
 

5083
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:15,910
they had been looking at these things as
we're driving i said sir we've been

5084
01:17:15,910 --> 01:17:15,920
we're driving i said sir we've been
 

5085
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:16,870
we're driving i said sir we've been
tracking these things for about two

5086
01:17:16,870 --> 01:17:16,880
tracking these things for about two
 

5087
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:18,149
tracking these things for about two
weeks that's we had been at sea for two

5088
01:17:18,149 --> 01:17:18,159
weeks that's we had been at sea for two
 

5089
01:17:18,159 --> 01:17:18,550
weeks that's we had been at sea for two
weeks

5090
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:18,560
weeks
 

5091
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:20,550
weeks
because this is the first time we've had

5092
01:17:20,550 --> 01:17:20,560
because this is the first time we've had
 

5093
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:21,910
because this is the first time we've had
planes airborne we want you to go see

5094
01:17:21,910 --> 01:17:21,920
planes airborne we want you to go see
 

5095
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:23,110
planes airborne we want you to go see
what these are

5096
01:17:23,110 --> 01:17:23,120
what these are
 

5097
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:24,630
what these are
gotcha so they kind of interrupt the

5098
01:17:24,630 --> 01:17:24,640
gotcha so they kind of interrupt the
 

5099
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:26,229
gotcha so they kind of interrupt the
mission to say

5100
01:17:26,229 --> 01:17:26,239
mission to say
 

5101
01:17:26,239 --> 01:17:28,470
mission to say
check it out so we start driving out

5102
01:17:28,470 --> 01:17:28,480
check it out so we start driving out
 

5103
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:29,590
check it out so we start driving out
there

5104
01:17:29,590 --> 01:17:29,600
there
 

5105
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:32,149
there
and uh as we get down to he's going you

5106
01:17:32,149 --> 01:17:32,159
and uh as we get down to he's going you
 

5107
01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:32,709
and uh as we get down to he's going you
know

5108
01:17:32,709 --> 01:17:32,719
know
 

5109
01:17:32,719 --> 01:17:35,350
know
20 miles 15 miles 10 miles and then you

5110
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:35,360
20 miles 15 miles 10 miles and then you
 

5111
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:36,550
20 miles 15 miles 10 miles and then you
get to a point where they call merge

5112
01:17:36,550 --> 01:17:36,560
get to a point where they call merge
 

5113
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:37,750
get to a point where they call merge
plot which means we are

5114
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:37,760
plot which means we are
 

5115
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:39,590
plot which means we are
inside of the resolution cell of the

5116
01:17:39,590 --> 01:17:39,600
inside of the resolution cell of the
 

5117
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:41,030
inside of the resolution cell of the
radar because radars don't see

5118
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:41,040
radar because radars don't see
 

5119
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:43,750
radar because radars don't see
everything they're so they have a range

5120
01:17:43,750 --> 01:17:43,760
everything they're so they have a range
 

5121
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,750
everything they're so they have a range
and they have an azimuth resolution

5122
01:17:45,750 --> 01:17:45,760
and they have an azimuth resolution
 

5123
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:47,510
and they have an azimuth resolution
right so and it's basically think of a

5124
01:17:47,510 --> 01:17:47,520
right so and it's basically think of a
 

5125
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,030
right so and it's basically think of a
little cube so they can

5126
01:17:49,030 --> 01:17:49,040
little cube so they can
 

5127
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:50,390
little cube so they can
and the whole sky is made of all these

5128
01:17:50,390 --> 01:17:50,400
and the whole sky is made of all these
 

5129
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,470
and the whole sky is made of all these
little cubes and they're looking so if

5130
01:17:52,470 --> 01:17:52,480
little cubes and they're looking so if
 

5131
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:54,310
little cubes and they're looking so if
you're inside a cube with something and

5132
01:17:54,310 --> 01:17:54,320
you're inside a cube with something and
 

5133
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:56,070
you're inside a cube with something and
you're both inside the same little cube

5134
01:17:56,070 --> 01:17:56,080
you're both inside the same little cube
 

5135
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:57,830
you're both inside the same little cube
then the radar can only see one thing

5136
01:17:57,830 --> 01:17:57,840
then the radar can only see one thing
 

5137
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:59,189
then the radar can only see one thing
does that make sense yeah yeah

5138
01:17:59,189 --> 01:17:59,199
does that make sense yeah yeah
 

5139
01:17:59,199 --> 01:18:01,750
does that make sense yeah yeah
so they call merge plot when we say

5140
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:01,760
so they call merge plot when we say
 

5141
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:02,950
so they call merge plot when we say
merge plot to us

5142
01:18:02,950 --> 01:18:02,960
merge plot to us
 

5143
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:04,630
merge plot to us
it means he's right around something's

5144
01:18:04,630 --> 01:18:04,640
it means he's right around something's
 

5145
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:06,149
it means he's right around something's
around you get your head out so we're

5146
01:18:06,149 --> 01:18:06,159
around you get your head out so we're
 

5147
01:18:06,159 --> 01:18:07,910
around you get your head out so we're
not looking at radar scopes anymore and

5148
01:18:07,910 --> 01:18:07,920
not looking at radar scopes anymore and
 

5149
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:09,270
not looking at radar scopes anymore and
the wizards the wizards can look but

5150
01:18:09,270 --> 01:18:09,280
the wizards the wizards can look but
 

5151
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:10,550
the wizards the wizards can look but
everyone it's heads out

5152
01:18:10,550 --> 01:18:10,560
everyone it's heads out
 

5153
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,310
everyone it's heads out
when they say merge plot you're done

5154
01:18:12,310 --> 01:18:12,320
when they say merge plot you're done
 

5155
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:13,669
when they say merge plot you're done
looking at your displays inside you're

5156
01:18:13,669 --> 01:18:13,679
looking at your displays inside you're
 

5157
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:14,229
looking at your displays inside you're
doing this

5158
01:18:14,229 --> 01:18:14,239
doing this
 

5159
01:18:14,239 --> 01:18:17,350
doing this
and you're trying to find it so as we

5160
01:18:17,350 --> 01:18:17,360
and you're trying to find it so as we
 

5161
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:18,870
and you're trying to find it so as we
look out to the right and you look high

5162
01:18:18,870 --> 01:18:18,880
look out to the right and you look high
 

5163
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:20,310
look out to the right and you look high
and low because he could be anywhere

5164
01:18:20,310 --> 01:18:20,320
and low because he could be anywhere
 

5165
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:22,070
and low because he could be anywhere
from the surface all the way up now keep

5166
01:18:22,070 --> 01:18:22,080
from the surface all the way up now keep
 

5167
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,750
from the surface all the way up now keep
in mind the ship is like probably 60

5168
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:23,760
in mind the ship is like probably 60
 

5169
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:25,510
in mind the ship is like probably 60
miles away so it can't see

5170
01:18:25,510 --> 01:18:25,520
miles away so it can't see
 

5171
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:27,750
miles away so it can't see
the surface and you can do your standard

5172
01:18:27,750 --> 01:18:27,760
the surface and you can do your standard
 

5173
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:29,590
the surface and you can do your standard
radar horizon calculation and go hey

5174
01:18:29,590 --> 01:18:29,600
radar horizon calculation and go hey
 

5175
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:30,310
radar horizon calculation and go hey
it's the

5176
01:18:30,310 --> 01:18:30,320
it's the
 

5177
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,229
it's the
the thing is 40 feet off the water the

5178
01:18:32,229 --> 01:18:32,239
the thing is 40 feet off the water the
 

5179
01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:34,310
the thing is 40 feet off the water the
panel can he really see

5180
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:34,320
panel can he really see
 

5181
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:35,830
panel can he really see
you know there are radars that can see

5182
01:18:35,830 --> 01:18:35,840
you know there are radars that can see
 

5183
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:37,830
you know there are radars that can see
around the curve but let's just say that

5184
01:18:37,830 --> 01:18:37,840
around the curve but let's just say that
 

5185
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:38,950
around the curve but let's just say that
it can't

5186
01:18:38,950 --> 01:18:38,960
it can't
 

5187
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:41,510
it can't
at this time so you go is it you know

5188
01:18:41,510 --> 01:18:41,520
at this time so you go is it you know
 

5189
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:42,630
at this time so you go is it you know
where's it at

5190
01:18:42,630 --> 01:18:42,640
where's it at
 

5191
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:45,430
where's it at
so as we're looking around we see now

5192
01:18:45,430 --> 01:18:45,440
so as we're looking around we see now
 

5193
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:46,070
so as we're looking around we see now
this is a

5194
01:18:46,070 --> 01:18:46,080
this is a
 

5195
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:49,430
this is a
it's a clear day there's no clouds

5196
01:18:49,430 --> 01:18:49,440
it's a clear day there's no clouds
 

5197
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:51,830
it's a clear day there's no clouds
and there's no white caps it's just a

5198
01:18:51,830 --> 01:18:51,840
and there's no white caps it's just a
 

5199
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:52,870
and there's no white caps it's just a
calm

5200
01:18:52,870 --> 01:18:52,880
calm
 

5201
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:54,630
calm
it's actually a perfect day if you owned

5202
01:18:54,630 --> 01:18:54,640
it's actually a perfect day if you owned
 

5203
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:56,870
it's actually a perfect day if you owned
a sailboat it was that five to ten knots

5204
01:18:56,870 --> 01:18:56,880
a sailboat it was that five to ten knots
 

5205
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:58,070
a sailboat it was that five to ten knots
of wind and you just want to kind of go

5206
01:18:58,070 --> 01:18:58,080
of wind and you just want to kind of go
 

5207
01:18:58,080 --> 01:18:59,189
of wind and you just want to kind of go
out there and you're not going to get

5208
01:18:59,189 --> 01:18:59,199
out there and you're not going to get
 

5209
01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:01,030
out there and you're not going to get
beat up and have white water coming

5210
01:19:01,030 --> 01:19:01,040
beat up and have white water coming
 

5211
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:02,790
beat up and have white water coming
it was the perfect date on a sailboat

5212
01:19:02,790 --> 01:19:02,800
it was the perfect date on a sailboat
 

5213
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,950
it was the perfect date on a sailboat
how many miles out do you see like seven

5214
01:19:04,950 --> 01:19:04,960
how many miles out do you see like seven
 

5215
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:07,270
how many miles out do you see like seven
like you see just it's a clear day

5216
01:19:07,270 --> 01:19:07,280
like you see just it's a clear day
 

5217
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:08,870
like you see just it's a clear day
it's 50 it's unrestricted visibility you

5218
01:19:08,870 --> 01:19:08,880
it's 50 it's unrestricted visibility you
 

5219
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:10,390
it's 50 it's unrestricted visibility you
can see literally all the way to horizon

5220
01:19:10,390 --> 01:19:10,400
can see literally all the way to horizon
 

5221
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:10,950
can see literally all the way to horizon
it's just

5222
01:19:10,950 --> 01:19:10,960
it's just
 

5223
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:13,189
it's just
clear it's nothing and we're basically

5224
01:19:13,189 --> 01:19:13,199
clear it's nothing and we're basically
 

5225
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:14,550
clear it's nothing and we're basically
off the coast if you look at a map and

5226
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:14,560
off the coast if you look at a map and
 

5227
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:15,030
off the coast if you look at a map and
you go

5228
01:19:15,030 --> 01:19:15,040
you go
 

5229
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:17,189
you go
san diego and then inside of mexico

5230
01:19:17,189 --> 01:19:17,199
san diego and then inside of mexico
 

5231
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:18,709
san diego and then inside of mexico
we're kind of in between that

5232
01:19:18,709 --> 01:19:18,719
we're kind of in between that
 

5233
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:21,350
we're kind of in between that
and we're probably about by the time

5234
01:19:21,350 --> 01:19:21,360
and we're probably about by the time
 

5235
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:23,430
and we're probably about by the time
this all hits we're price

5236
01:19:23,430 --> 01:19:23,440
this all hits we're price
 

5237
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:26,229
this all hits we're price
i don't know eighty hundred i don't know

5238
01:19:26,229 --> 01:19:26,239
i don't know eighty hundred i don't know
 

5239
01:19:26,239 --> 01:19:27,750
i don't know eighty hundred i don't know
but somewhere out it's pretty far off

5240
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:27,760
but somewhere out it's pretty far off
 

5241
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:29,270
but somewhere out it's pretty far off
the coast perfect

5242
01:19:29,270 --> 01:19:29,280
the coast perfect
 

5243
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:31,110
the coast perfect
from 20 000 feet you'd be amazed you can

5244
01:19:31,110 --> 01:19:31,120
from 20 000 feet you'd be amazed you can
 

5245
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:32,870
from 20 000 feet you'd be amazed you can
do the calculation you can see stuff

5246
01:19:32,870 --> 01:19:32,880
do the calculation you can see stuff
 

5247
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:34,870
do the calculation you can see stuff
you know you'll see land 50 miles away

5248
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:34,880
you know you'll see land 50 miles away
 

5249
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:36,310
you know you'll see land 50 miles away
you can see you know and when you're

5250
01:19:36,310 --> 01:19:36,320
you can see you know and when you're
 

5251
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:36,870
you can see you know and when you're
looking at

5252
01:19:36,870 --> 01:19:36,880
looking at
 

5253
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:38,950
looking at
a continent it's really easy to see

5254
01:19:38,950 --> 01:19:38,960
a continent it's really easy to see
 

5255
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:40,070
a continent it's really easy to see
you're not looking at an island i mean

5256
01:19:40,070 --> 01:19:40,080
you're not looking at an island i mean
 

5257
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:41,510
you're not looking at an island i mean
you're looking at mexico

5258
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:41,520
you're looking at mexico
 

5259
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:43,110
you're looking at mexico
and you can see on the white gaps in the

5260
01:19:43,110 --> 01:19:43,120
and you can see on the white gaps in the
 

5261
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:44,870
and you can see on the white gaps in the
water if there is any oh yeah they're

5262
01:19:44,870 --> 01:19:44,880
water if there is any oh yeah they're
 

5263
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:45,669
water if there is any oh yeah they're
easy

5264
01:19:45,669 --> 01:19:45,679
easy
 

5265
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:47,990
easy
yeah for us we look at it because we

5266
01:19:47,990 --> 01:19:48,000
yeah for us we look at it because we
 

5267
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,669
yeah for us we look at it because we
know if it's natural wind or

5268
01:19:49,669 --> 01:19:49,679
know if it's natural wind or
 

5269
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:51,270
know if it's natural wind or
so if it's a really white cap windy day

5270
01:19:51,270 --> 01:19:51,280
so if it's a really white cap windy day
 

5271
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:52,630
so if it's a really white cap windy day
then the ships just kind of barely be

5272
01:19:52,630 --> 01:19:52,640
then the ships just kind of barely be
 

5273
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:53,910
then the ships just kind of barely be
moving when we land on it it makes it

5274
01:19:53,910 --> 01:19:53,920
moving when we land on it it makes it
 

5275
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:55,350
moving when we land on it it makes it
actually easier

5276
01:19:55,350 --> 01:19:55,360
actually easier
 

5277
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:56,870
actually easier
if the ship has to move where it's got a

5278
01:19:56,870 --> 01:19:56,880
if the ship has to move where it's got a
 

5279
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,149
if the ship has to move where it's got a
big weight because it has to make its

5280
01:19:58,149 --> 01:19:58,159
big weight because it has to make its
 

5281
01:19:58,159 --> 01:19:59,669
big weight because it has to make its
own wind when we land which is the day

5282
01:19:59,669 --> 01:19:59,679
own wind when we land which is the day
 

5283
01:19:59,679 --> 01:20:00,790
own wind when we land which is the day
that it was this day

5284
01:20:00,790 --> 01:20:00,800
that it was this day
 

5285
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,790
that it was this day
you go oh okay and it creates what's

5286
01:20:02,790 --> 01:20:02,800
you go oh okay and it creates what's
 

5287
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,550
you go oh okay and it creates what's
called we call the verbal but when the

5288
01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:04,560
called we call the verbal but when the
 

5289
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:06,070
called we call the verbal but when the
air flows across the flight deck it

5290
01:20:06,070 --> 01:20:06,080
air flows across the flight deck it
 

5291
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:08,149
air flows across the flight deck it
drops behind the ship you know

5292
01:20:08,149 --> 01:20:08,159
drops behind the ship you know
 

5293
01:20:08,159 --> 01:20:09,910
drops behind the ship you know
and then it kicks back up so when you're

5294
01:20:09,910 --> 01:20:09,920
and then it kicks back up so when you're
 

5295
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:11,270
and then it kicks back up so when you're
coming board to land it's going to make

5296
01:20:11,270 --> 01:20:11,280
coming board to land it's going to make
 

5297
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:12,390
coming board to land it's going to make
you go up a little bit and then you're

5298
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:12,400
you go up a little bit and then you're
 

5299
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:13,750
you go up a little bit and then you're
going to fall and you've got to con

5300
01:20:13,750 --> 01:20:13,760
going to fall and you've got to con
 

5301
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:15,110
going to fall and you've got to con
you've got to anticipate that to stand

5302
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:15,120
you've got to anticipate that to stand
 

5303
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:18,470
you've got to anticipate that to stand
glideslope so we're pretty

5304
01:20:18,470 --> 01:20:18,480
glideslope so we're pretty
 

5305
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:19,990
glideslope so we're pretty
we're pretty conscious of what's going

5306
01:20:19,990 --> 01:20:20,000
we're pretty conscious of what's going
 

5307
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,669
we're pretty conscious of what's going
on out there with the waves and the wind

5308
01:20:21,669 --> 01:20:21,679
on out there with the waves and the wind
 

5309
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:23,750
on out there with the waves and the wind
so we look there's no waves there's no

5310
01:20:23,750 --> 01:20:23,760
so we look there's no waves there's no
 

5311
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:25,110
so we look there's no waves there's no
wind there's no white caps

5312
01:20:25,110 --> 01:20:25,120
wind there's no white caps
 

5313
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:28,229
wind there's no white caps
and we look down and we see white water

5314
01:20:28,229 --> 01:20:28,239
and we look down and we see white water
 

5315
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:30,310
and we look down and we see white water
so if you put if you put a piece of land

5316
01:20:30,310 --> 01:20:30,320
so if you put if you put a piece of land
 

5317
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:31,990
so if you put if you put a piece of land
a sea mount below the surface

5318
01:20:31,990 --> 01:20:32,000
a sea mount below the surface
 

5319
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,750
a sea mount below the surface
like you know even 20 feet below the

5320
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:33,760
like you know even 20 feet below the
 

5321
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:35,030
like you know even 20 feet below the
surface that's big enough

5322
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:35,040
surface that's big enough
 

5323
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:37,110
surface that's big enough
as the waves come in you know waves have

5324
01:20:37,110 --> 01:20:37,120
as the waves come in you know waves have
 

5325
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,629
as the waves come in you know waves have
height and length

5326
01:20:38,629 --> 01:20:38,639
height and length
 

5327
01:20:38,639 --> 01:20:39,910
height and length
when they come in that's what happens on

5328
01:20:39,910 --> 01:20:39,920
when they come in that's what happens on
 

5329
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:41,910
when they come in that's what happens on
the shore when a wave comes in it hits

5330
01:20:41,910 --> 01:20:41,920
the shore when a wave comes in it hits
 

5331
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:43,430
the shore when a wave comes in it hits
and then it starts to collapse and it

5332
01:20:43,430 --> 01:20:43,440
and then it starts to collapse and it
 

5333
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:45,030
and then it starts to collapse and it
pushes the wave height up because

5334
01:20:45,030 --> 01:20:45,040
pushes the wave height up because
 

5335
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:46,950
pushes the wave height up because
it can't go anymore and then it breaks

5336
01:20:46,950 --> 01:20:46,960
it can't go anymore and then it breaks
 

5337
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:48,310
it can't go anymore and then it breaks
the top and yeah and that's where you

5338
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:48,320
the top and yeah and that's where you
 

5339
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:49,270
the top and yeah and that's where you
get the white

5340
01:20:49,270 --> 01:20:49,280
get the white
 

5341
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:51,189
get the white
so what happens is at sea when you get a

5342
01:20:51,189 --> 01:20:51,199
so what happens is at sea when you get a
 

5343
01:20:51,199 --> 01:20:52,950
so what happens is at sea when you get a
sea mount you'll see stuff come in the

5344
01:20:52,950 --> 01:20:52,960
sea mount you'll see stuff come in the
 

5345
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:54,070
sea mount you'll see stuff come in the
wave will crash and you'll get white

5346
01:20:54,070 --> 01:20:54,080
wave will crash and you'll get white
 

5347
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:54,950
wave will crash and you'll get white
water

5348
01:20:54,950 --> 01:20:54,960
water
 

5349
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:58,070
water
you can go out when it's high tide in

5350
01:20:58,070 --> 01:20:58,080
you can go out when it's high tide in
 

5351
01:20:58,080 --> 01:20:59,270
you can go out when it's high tide in
any one of the coasts you can go out

5352
01:20:59,270 --> 01:20:59,280
any one of the coasts you can go out
 

5353
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:01,270
any one of the coasts you can go out
here off of boston and go hey at low

5354
01:21:01,270 --> 01:21:01,280
here off of boston and go hey at low
 

5355
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:02,870
here off of boston and go hey at low
tide i can see those rocks and at high

5356
01:21:02,870 --> 01:21:02,880
tide i can see those rocks and at high
 

5357
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,149
tide i can see those rocks and at high
tide i can't see the rocks are covered

5358
01:21:04,149 --> 01:21:04,159
tide i can't see the rocks are covered
 

5359
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:05,189
tide i can't see the rocks are covered
but there will be white water around

5360
01:21:05,189 --> 01:21:05,199
but there will be white water around
 

5361
01:21:05,199 --> 01:21:06,149
but there will be white water around
those rocks you'll be able to tell

5362
01:21:06,149 --> 01:21:06,159
those rocks you'll be able to tell
 

5363
01:21:06,159 --> 01:21:07,510
those rocks you'll be able to tell
there's something underneath the surface

5364
01:21:07,510 --> 01:21:07,520
there's something underneath the surface
 

5365
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:08,229
there's something underneath the surface
does that make sense

5366
01:21:08,229 --> 01:21:08,239
does that make sense
 

5367
01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:10,229
does that make sense
yep so that's what it was we see we

5368
01:21:10,229 --> 01:21:10,239
yep so that's what it was we see we
 

5369
01:21:10,239 --> 01:21:11,590
yep so that's what it was we see we
don't see an object because there's

5370
01:21:11,590 --> 01:21:11,600
don't see an object because there's
 

5371
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,510
don't see an object because there's
all kinds of oh they saw this they saw

5372
01:21:13,510 --> 01:21:13,520
all kinds of oh they saw this they saw
 

5373
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:14,950
all kinds of oh they saw this they saw
another craft below the way we didn't

5374
01:21:14,950 --> 01:21:14,960
another craft below the way we didn't
 

5375
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:16,470
another craft below the way we didn't
see anything below the water

5376
01:21:16,470 --> 01:21:16,480
see anything below the water
 

5377
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:18,470
see anything below the water
we just saw white water but the white

5378
01:21:18,470 --> 01:21:18,480
we just saw white water but the white
 

5379
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:20,310
we just saw white water but the white
water and i like to shape it you can say

5380
01:21:20,310 --> 01:21:20,320
water and i like to shape it you can say
 

5381
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:21,910
water and i like to shape it you can say
it was across i say it's about the size

5382
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:21,920
it was across i say it's about the size
 

5383
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,830
it was across i say it's about the size
of a 737 so it looks like if you took a

5384
01:21:23,830 --> 01:21:23,840
of a 737 so it looks like if you took a
 

5385
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:25,189
of a 737 so it looks like if you took a
737

5386
01:21:25,189 --> 01:21:25,199
737
 

5387
01:21:25,199 --> 01:21:27,350
737
put it about 15 20 feet below the water

5388
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:27,360
put it about 15 20 feet below the water
 

5389
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:28,870
put it about 15 20 feet below the water
so the waves breaking over the top and

5390
01:21:28,870 --> 01:21:28,880
so the waves breaking over the top and
 

5391
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:29,910
so the waves breaking over the top and
you're going to get white water where

5392
01:21:29,910 --> 01:21:29,920
you're going to get white water where
 

5393
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:31,270
you're going to get white water where
the plane is at you'd see

5394
01:21:31,270 --> 01:21:31,280
the plane is at you'd see
 

5395
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:32,790
the plane is at you'd see
this this kind of shape so it looks like

5396
01:21:32,790 --> 01:21:32,800
this this kind of shape so it looks like
 

5397
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:34,709
this this kind of shape so it looks like
a cross

5398
01:21:34,709 --> 01:21:34,719
a cross
 

5399
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:36,070
a cross
so as we're looking down off the right

5400
01:21:36,070 --> 01:21:36,080
so as we're looking down off the right
 

5401
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:37,590
so as we're looking down off the right
side the back seater in the other

5402
01:21:37,590 --> 01:21:37,600
side the back seater in the other
 

5403
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,270
side the back seater in the other
airplane jim

5404
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:39,280
airplane jim
 

5405
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:41,110
airplane jim
says this is that talking in parcels

5406
01:21:41,110 --> 01:21:41,120
says this is that talking in parcels
 

5407
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,110
says this is that talking in parcels
again he says hey skipper do you and

5408
01:21:43,110 --> 01:21:43,120
again he says hey skipper do you and
 

5409
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:44,229
again he says hey skipper do you and
that's about what he gets out of his

5410
01:21:44,229 --> 01:21:44,239
that's about what he gets out of his
 

5411
01:21:44,239 --> 01:21:45,110
that's about what he gets out of his
mouth and i go

5412
01:21:45,110 --> 01:21:45,120
mouth and i go
 

5413
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:47,510
mouth and i go
what the hell is that in a nice do you

5414
01:21:47,510 --> 01:21:47,520
what the hell is that in a nice do you
 

5415
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:48,709
what the hell is that in a nice do you
see that essentially

5416
01:21:48,709 --> 01:21:48,719
see that essentially
 

5417
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:50,470
see that essentially
so we see the white water and that's

5418
01:21:50,470 --> 01:21:50,480
so we see the white water and that's
 

5419
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:51,750
so we see the white water and that's
what draws our eyes down or otherwise

5420
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:51,760
what draws our eyes down or otherwise
 

5421
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:52,950
what draws our eyes down or otherwise
we'd have never seen it

5422
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:52,960
we'd have never seen it
 

5423
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:54,790
we'd have never seen it
so we see this i would love to see the

5424
01:21:54,790 --> 01:21:54,800
so we see this i would love to see the
 

5425
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,310
so we see this i would love to see the
look on your face when you see that

5426
01:21:56,310 --> 01:21:56,320
look on your face when you see that
 

5427
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:58,470
look on your face when you see that
and then we see this little white tic

5428
01:21:58,470 --> 01:21:58,480
and then we see this little white tic
 

5429
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,470
and then we see this little white tic
tac because we're about 20 000 feet

5430
01:22:00,470 --> 01:22:00,480
tac because we're about 20 000 feet
 

5431
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:01,910
tac because we're about 20 000 feet
above it and it's doing

5432
01:22:01,910 --> 01:22:01,920
above it and it's doing
 

5433
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:03,590
above it and it's doing
it's going basically north south and

5434
01:22:03,590 --> 01:22:03,600
it's going basically north south and
 

5435
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,510
it's going basically north south and
then east west north and so it's abrupt

5436
01:22:05,510 --> 01:22:05,520
then east west north and so it's abrupt
 

5437
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:07,430
then east west north and so it's abrupt
it's very abrupt so it's not

5438
01:22:07,430 --> 01:22:07,440
it's very abrupt so it's not
 

5439
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:09,510
it's very abrupt so it's not
uh like a helicopter if a helicopter is

5440
01:22:09,510 --> 01:22:09,520
uh like a helicopter if a helicopter is
 

5441
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:10,550
uh like a helicopter if a helicopter is
going sideways

5442
01:22:10,550 --> 01:22:10,560
going sideways
 

5443
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,070
going sideways
and it goes once it's going sideways

5444
01:22:12,070 --> 01:22:12,080
and it goes once it's going sideways
 

5445
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:13,430
and it goes once it's going sideways
left and it goes right what it'll do is

5446
01:22:13,430 --> 01:22:13,440
left and it goes right what it'll do is
 

5447
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:14,709
left and it goes right what it'll do is
it'll go it's got a speed

5448
01:22:14,709 --> 01:22:14,719
it'll go it's got a speed
 

5449
01:22:14,719 --> 01:22:16,470
it'll go it's got a speed
it slows down because there's inertia

5450
01:22:16,470 --> 01:22:16,480
it slows down because there's inertia
 

5451
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:17,990
it slows down because there's inertia
yeah and it stops and then it goes back

5452
01:22:17,990 --> 01:22:18,000
yeah and it stops and then it goes back
 

5453
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,590
yeah and it stops and then it goes back
the other way this thing's not it's like

5454
01:22:19,590 --> 01:22:19,600
the other way this thing's not it's like
 

5455
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:22,470
the other way this thing's not it's like
left right left right with no so moving

5456
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:22,480
left right left right with no so moving
 

5457
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:23,990
left right left right with no so moving
in ways that doesn't

5458
01:22:23,990 --> 01:22:24,000
in ways that doesn't
 

5459
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,390
in ways that doesn't
doesn't feel intuitive to you at all of

5460
01:22:26,390 --> 01:22:26,400
doesn't feel intuitive to you at all of
 

5461
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:27,910
doesn't feel intuitive to you at all of
the things you've seen in the past

5462
01:22:27,910 --> 01:22:27,920
the things you've seen in the past
 

5463
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:29,669
the things you've seen in the past
so as a pilot the first thing you think

5464
01:22:29,669 --> 01:22:29,679
so as a pilot the first thing you think
 

5465
01:22:29,679 --> 01:22:31,430
so as a pilot the first thing you think
is it's a helicopter

5466
01:22:31,430 --> 01:22:31,440
is it's a helicopter
 

5467
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:33,910
is it's a helicopter
right right so you go oh what is because

5468
01:22:33,910 --> 01:22:33,920
right right so you go oh what is because
 

5469
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:35,189
right right so you go oh what is because
when we see it's moving we're like oh

5470
01:22:35,189 --> 01:22:35,199
when we see it's moving we're like oh
 

5471
01:22:35,199 --> 01:22:36,550
when we see it's moving we're like oh
helicopter

5472
01:22:36,550 --> 01:22:36,560
helicopter
 

5473
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:37,750
helicopter
so the first thing you look for to see

5474
01:22:37,750 --> 01:22:37,760
so the first thing you look for to see
 

5475
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:39,030
so the first thing you look for to see
if it's a helicopter when they're doing

5476
01:22:39,030 --> 01:22:39,040
if it's a helicopter when they're doing
 

5477
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:39,990
if it's a helicopter when they're doing
that because

5478
01:22:39,990 --> 01:22:40,000
that because
 

5479
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,270
that because
usually when they get down there towards

5480
01:22:41,270 --> 01:22:41,280
usually when they get down there towards
 

5481
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,590
usually when they get down there towards
that 50 feet you'll get rotor wash

5482
01:22:43,590 --> 01:22:43,600
that 50 feet you'll get rotor wash
 

5483
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:44,709
that 50 feet you'll get rotor wash
you see it in the movies when the

5484
01:22:44,709 --> 01:22:44,719
you see it in the movies when the
 

5485
01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:46,470
you see it in the movies when the
helicopter's by the water it kicks the

5486
01:22:46,470 --> 01:22:46,480
helicopter's by the water it kicks the
 

5487
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:47,669
helicopter's by the water it kicks the
water comes up besides because the

5488
01:22:47,669 --> 01:22:47,679
water comes up besides because the
 

5489
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:48,790
water comes up besides because the
downdraft

5490
01:22:48,790 --> 01:22:48,800
downdraft
 

5491
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,070
downdraft
you know like a thunderstorm will do

5492
01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:50,080
you know like a thunderstorm will do
 

5493
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:51,430
you know like a thunderstorm will do
that it pushes the air down and then it

5494
01:22:51,430 --> 01:22:51,440
that it pushes the air down and then it
 

5495
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:53,189
that it pushes the air down and then it
has to come out the sides

5496
01:22:53,189 --> 01:22:53,199
has to come out the sides
 

5497
01:22:53,199 --> 01:22:55,590
has to come out the sides
so you see it and you go well there's no

5498
01:22:55,590 --> 01:22:55,600
so you see it and you go well there's no
 

5499
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:58,149
so you see it and you go well there's no
there's no rotor wash what is that thing

5500
01:22:58,149 --> 01:22:58,159
there's no rotor wash what is that thing
 

5501
01:22:58,159 --> 01:22:59,830
there's no rotor wash what is that thing
so by this time we're driving around so

5502
01:22:59,830 --> 01:22:59,840
so by this time we're driving around so
 

5503
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:01,030
so by this time we're driving around so
as we're if we were at the six o'clock

5504
01:23:01,030 --> 01:23:01,040
as we're if we were at the six o'clock
 

5505
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:02,310
as we're if we were at the six o'clock
we're driving around towards that nine

5506
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:02,320
we're driving around towards that nine
 

5507
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:03,910
we're driving around towards that nine
o'clock position and we're just watching

5508
01:23:03,910 --> 01:23:03,920
o'clock position and we're just watching
 

5509
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:04,950
o'clock position and we're just watching
this thing and it's just it's still

5510
01:23:04,950 --> 01:23:04,960
this thing and it's just it's still
 

5511
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:06,709
this thing and it's just it's still
pointing north-south and it's going

5512
01:23:06,709 --> 01:23:06,719
pointing north-south and it's going
 

5513
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:07,990
pointing north-south and it's going
left-right and it's kind of moving

5514
01:23:07,990 --> 01:23:08,000
left-right and it's kind of moving
 

5515
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,149
left-right and it's kind of moving
around the object and if it had if i had

5516
01:23:10,149 --> 01:23:10,159
around the object and if it had if i had
 

5517
01:23:10,159 --> 01:23:11,510
around the object and if it had if i had
to say it biased itself

5518
01:23:11,510 --> 01:23:11,520
to say it biased itself
 

5519
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,270
to say it biased itself
it was biased towards the bottom half so

5520
01:23:13,270 --> 01:23:13,280
it was biased towards the bottom half so
 

5521
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,950
it was biased towards the bottom half so
if you've got the east-west and then the

5522
01:23:14,950 --> 01:23:14,960
if you've got the east-west and then the
 

5523
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:16,709
if you've got the east-west and then the
north-south kind of across

5524
01:23:16,709 --> 01:23:16,719
north-south kind of across
 

5525
01:23:16,719 --> 01:23:18,070
north-south kind of across
it's hanging out on the southern thing

5526
01:23:18,070 --> 01:23:18,080
it's hanging out on the southern thing
 

5527
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:19,030
it's hanging out on the southern thing
that's hanging out it's just kind of

5528
01:23:19,030 --> 01:23:19,040
that's hanging out it's just kind of
 

5529
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:20,310
that's hanging out it's just kind of
moving around up down left and it's

5530
01:23:20,310 --> 01:23:20,320
moving around up down left and it's
 

5531
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:21,910
moving around up down left and it's
crossing over it it's going up just kind

5532
01:23:21,910 --> 01:23:21,920
crossing over it it's going up just kind
 

5533
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:22,550
crossing over it it's going up just kind
of

5534
01:23:22,550 --> 01:23:22,560
of
 

5535
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:25,189
of
so now we're like what the hell is that

5536
01:23:25,189 --> 01:23:25,199
so now we're like what the hell is that
 

5537
01:23:25,199 --> 01:23:25,990
so now we're like what the hell is that
so then i go

5538
01:23:25,990 --> 01:23:26,000
so then i go
 

5539
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,950
so then i go
hey i'm gonna go check it out and the

5540
01:23:28,950 --> 01:23:28,960
hey i'm gonna go check it out and the
 

5541
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:30,070
hey i'm gonna go check it out and the
other pilot says

5542
01:23:30,070 --> 01:23:30,080
other pilot says
 

5543
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:31,830
other pilot says
i'm gonna stay up here and i said yeah

5544
01:23:31,830 --> 01:23:31,840
i'm gonna stay up here and i said yeah
 

5545
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,669
i'm gonna stay up here and i said yeah
stay up high because now we get we get a

5546
01:23:33,669 --> 01:23:33,679
stay up high because now we get we get a
 

5547
01:23:33,679 --> 01:23:35,189
stay up high because now we get we get a
different perspective

5548
01:23:35,189 --> 01:23:35,199
different perspective
 

5549
01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:37,669
different perspective
so she's up here and i'm down here as

5550
01:23:37,669 --> 01:23:37,679
so she's up here and i'm down here as
 

5551
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:38,709
so she's up here and i'm down here as
i'm descending

5552
01:23:38,709 --> 01:23:38,719
i'm descending
 

5553
01:23:38,719 --> 01:23:40,709
i'm descending
she can watch because right now all i'm

5554
01:23:40,709 --> 01:23:40,719
she can watch because right now all i'm
 

5555
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:42,870
she can watch because right now all i'm
watching is the tic tac

5556
01:23:42,870 --> 01:23:42,880
watching is the tic tac
 

5557
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:44,790
watching is the tic tac
she can watch me and the tic tac so she

5558
01:23:44,790 --> 01:23:44,800
she can watch me and the tic tac so she
 

5559
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:45,990
she can watch me and the tic tac so she
gets a god's eye view of everything

5560
01:23:45,990 --> 01:23:46,000
gets a god's eye view of everything
 

5561
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,350
gets a god's eye view of everything
that's going on which is really

5562
01:23:47,350 --> 01:23:47,360
that's going on which is really
 

5563
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:49,030
that's going on which is really
important you can you'll hear people say

5564
01:23:49,030 --> 01:23:49,040
important you can you'll hear people say
 

5565
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:50,310
important you can you'll hear people say
it's high cover whatever

5566
01:23:50,310 --> 01:23:50,320
it's high cover whatever
 

5567
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:53,350
it's high cover whatever
she's watching me which is it's perfect

5568
01:23:53,350 --> 01:23:53,360
she's watching me which is it's perfect
 

5569
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:55,270
she's watching me which is it's perfect
as the story goes on because it it gives

5570
01:23:55,270 --> 01:23:55,280
as the story goes on because it it gives
 

5571
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:56,870
as the story goes on because it it gives
us two perspectives

5572
01:23:56,870 --> 01:23:56,880
us two perspectives
 

5573
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:58,790
us two perspectives
you know of a perspective that's about 8

5574
01:23:58,790 --> 01:23:58,800
you know of a perspective that's about 8
 

5575
01:23:58,800 --> 01:23:59,910
you know of a perspective that's about 8
000 feet above us

5576
01:23:59,910 --> 01:23:59,920
000 feet above us
 

5577
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:01,350
000 feet above us
when that thing disappears and they

5578
01:24:01,350 --> 01:24:01,360
when that thing disappears and they
 

5579
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:02,550
when that thing disappears and they
don't you know because if it's just like

5580
01:24:02,550 --> 01:24:02,560
don't you know because if it's just like
 

5581
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:03,669
don't you know because if it's just like
oh i lost it

5582
01:24:03,669 --> 01:24:03,679
oh i lost it
 

5583
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:05,030
oh i lost it
and they go no it's over to the right we

5584
01:24:05,030 --> 01:24:05,040
and they go no it's over to the right we
 

5585
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,470
and they go no it's over to the right we
can still see it we all lost it at the

5586
01:24:06,470 --> 01:24:06,480
can still see it we all lost it at the
 

5587
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:07,590
can still see it we all lost it at the
same time

5588
01:24:07,590 --> 01:24:07,600
same time
 

5589
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:09,189
same time
so as we come down we get to about 12

5590
01:24:09,189 --> 01:24:09,199
so as we come down we get to about 12
 

5591
01:24:09,199 --> 01:24:10,629
so as we come down we get to about 12
o'clock and i'm descending it's an easy

5592
01:24:10,629 --> 01:24:10,639
o'clock and i'm descending it's an easy
 

5593
01:24:10,639 --> 01:24:12,310
o'clock and i'm descending it's an easy
descent i'm doing about 300 knots

5594
01:24:12,310 --> 01:24:12,320
descent i'm doing about 300 knots
 

5595
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:14,310
descent i'm doing about 300 knots
which is a really good air speed for the

5596
01:24:14,310 --> 01:24:14,320
which is a really good air speed for the
 

5597
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:15,990
which is a really good air speed for the
airplane for maneuvering because i

5598
01:24:15,990 --> 01:24:16,000
airplane for maneuvering because i
 

5599
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,070
airplane for maneuvering because i
have i have everything available to me

5600
01:24:18,070 --> 01:24:18,080
have i have everything available to me
 

5601
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:19,510
have i have everything available to me
at that speed

5602
01:24:19,510 --> 01:24:19,520
at that speed
 

5603
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:21,750
at that speed
so i'm coming down and as i get to 12

5604
01:24:21,750 --> 01:24:21,760
so i'm coming down and as i get to 12
 

5605
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:23,110
so i'm coming down and as i get to 12
o'clock as the tic takes doing this it

5606
01:24:23,110 --> 01:24:23,120
o'clock as the tic takes doing this it
 

5607
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:24,070
o'clock as the tic takes doing this it
literally it's like

5608
01:24:24,070 --> 01:24:24,080
literally it's like
 

5609
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:25,669
literally it's like
it's aware of us and it just goes blue

5610
01:24:25,669 --> 01:24:25,679
it's aware of us and it just goes blue
 

5611
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:27,430
it's aware of us and it just goes blue
and it kind of points

5612
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:27,440
and it kind of points
 

5613
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:28,790
and it kind of points
out towards the west and starts coming

5614
01:24:28,790 --> 01:24:28,800
out towards the west and starts coming
 

5615
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,790
out towards the west and starts coming
up so now it's obviously knows that

5616
01:24:30,790 --> 01:24:30,800
up so now it's obviously knows that
 

5617
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:31,350
up so now it's obviously knows that
we're there

5618
01:24:31,350 --> 01:24:31,360
we're there
 

5619
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:32,629
we're there
whatever this thing is and knows over

5620
01:24:32,629 --> 01:24:32,639
whatever this thing is and knows over
 

5621
01:24:32,639 --> 01:24:35,270
whatever this thing is and knows over
there so as we drive around it's coming

5622
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:35,280
there so as we drive around it's coming
 

5623
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:36,310
there so as we drive around it's coming
up and i'm just coming down we're just

5624
01:24:36,310 --> 01:24:36,320
up and i'm just coming down we're just
 

5625
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:37,590
up and i'm just coming down we're just
i'm just watching it now you remember

5626
01:24:37,590 --> 01:24:37,600
i'm just watching it now you remember
 

5627
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:38,870
i'm just watching it now you remember
this whole thing is like this is like

5628
01:24:38,870 --> 01:24:38,880
this whole thing is like this is like
 

5629
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:40,310
this whole thing is like this is like
five minutes this is not like

5630
01:24:40,310 --> 01:24:40,320
five minutes this is not like
 

5631
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:42,709
five minutes this is not like
we saw it it was gone or oh i saw lights

5632
01:24:42,709 --> 01:24:42,719
we saw it it was gone or oh i saw lights
 

5633
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:44,390
we saw it it was gone or oh i saw lights
in the sky and they were gone

5634
01:24:44,390 --> 01:24:44,400
in the sky and they were gone
 

5635
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:47,110
in the sky and they were gone
we watched this thing on a crystal clear

5636
01:24:47,110 --> 01:24:47,120
we watched this thing on a crystal clear
 

5637
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:47,669
we watched this thing on a crystal clear
day

5638
01:24:47,669 --> 01:24:47,679
day
 

5639
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:49,910
day
with four trained observers watch this

5640
01:24:49,910 --> 01:24:49,920
with four trained observers watch this
 

5641
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:51,110
with four trained observers watch this
thing fly around so we're like

5642
01:24:51,110 --> 01:24:51,120
thing fly around so we're like
 

5643
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:53,189
thing fly around so we're like
okay so i get over to the eight o'clock

5644
01:24:53,189 --> 01:24:53,199
okay so i get over to the eight o'clock
 

5645
01:24:53,199 --> 01:24:55,030
okay so i get over to the eight o'clock
position and i'm a little i'm a couple

5646
01:24:55,030 --> 01:24:55,040
position and i'm a little i'm a couple
 

5647
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:56,870
position and i'm a little i'm a couple
thousand feet above it and it's about so

5648
01:24:56,870 --> 01:24:56,880
thousand feet above it and it's about so
 

5649
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:58,950
thousand feet above it and it's about so
i'm probably at about 15k i think it is

5650
01:24:58,950 --> 01:24:58,960
i'm probably at about 15k i think it is
 

5651
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:00,550
i'm probably at about 15k i think it is
i think that's my story's about 15. it's

5652
01:25:00,550 --> 01:25:00,560
i think that's my story's about 15. it's
 

5653
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:01,669
i think that's my story's about 15. it's
just estimating

5654
01:25:01,669 --> 01:25:01,679
just estimating
 

5655
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:03,830
just estimating
so you can see it's just really easy to

5656
01:25:03,830 --> 01:25:03,840
so you can see it's just really easy to
 

5657
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:04,950
so you can see it's just really easy to
set because

5658
01:25:04,950 --> 01:25:04,960
set because
 

5659
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:07,669
set because
so what's 15k 15 000 feet i thought it

5660
01:25:07,669 --> 01:25:07,679
so what's 15k 15 000 feet i thought it
 

5661
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:08,550
so what's 15k 15 000 feet i thought it
was 8 000

5662
01:25:08,550 --> 01:25:08,560
was 8 000
 

5663
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:10,950
was 8 000
uh the the other airplane ends up about

5664
01:25:10,950 --> 01:25:10,960
uh the the other airplane ends up about
 

5665
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:11,830
uh the the other airplane ends up about
yeah

5666
01:25:11,830 --> 01:25:11,840
yeah
 

5667
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,750
yeah
okay so they're still about twenty

5668
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:13,760
okay so they're still about twenty
 

5669
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:15,350
okay so they're still about twenty
thousand feet so they're all right

5670
01:25:15,350 --> 01:25:15,360
thousand feet so they're all right
 

5671
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:16,790
thousand feet so they're all right
slowly and i'm descending they're

5672
01:25:16,790 --> 01:25:16,800
slowly and i'm descending they're
 

5673
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:18,149
slowly and i'm descending they're
staying up there so i'm kind of doing

5674
01:25:18,149 --> 01:25:18,159
staying up there so i'm kind of doing
 

5675
01:25:18,159 --> 01:25:18,470
staying up there so i'm kind of doing
this

5676
01:25:18,470 --> 01:25:18,480
this
 

5677
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:21,110
this
okay as they drive around okay so i'm

5678
01:25:21,110 --> 01:25:21,120
okay as they drive around okay so i'm
 

5679
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:22,709
okay as they drive around okay so i'm
looking at this thing and it's about the

5680
01:25:22,709 --> 01:25:22,719
looking at this thing and it's about the
 

5681
01:25:22,719 --> 01:25:23,910
looking at this thing and it's about the
two o'clock position we're about the

5682
01:25:23,910 --> 01:25:23,920
two o'clock position we're about the
 

5683
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:25,189
two o'clock position we're about the
eight o'clock position and i'm like oh

5684
01:25:25,189 --> 01:25:25,199
eight o'clock position and i'm like oh
 

5685
01:25:25,199 --> 01:25:25,990
eight o'clock position and i'm like oh
i've got

5686
01:25:25,990 --> 01:25:26,000
i've got
 

5687
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,669
i've got
i've got enough altitudes i'm gonna i'm

5688
01:25:27,669 --> 01:25:27,679
i've got enough altitudes i'm gonna i'm
 

5689
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:28,950
i've got enough altitudes i'm gonna i'm
gonna cut across the circle and i tell

5690
01:25:28,950 --> 01:25:28,960
gonna cut across the circle and i tell
 

5691
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,149
gonna cut across the circle and i tell
the guy in my back seat

5692
01:25:30,149 --> 01:25:30,159
the guy in my back seat
 

5693
01:25:30,159 --> 01:25:31,750
the guy in my back seat
dude i'm gonna i'm gonna do this he's

5694
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:31,760
dude i'm gonna i'm gonna do this he's
 

5695
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:33,430
dude i'm gonna i'm gonna do this he's
like go for it skip because i was a

5696
01:25:33,430 --> 01:25:33,440
like go for it skip because i was a
 

5697
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:34,550
like go for it skip because i was a
skipper

5698
01:25:34,550 --> 01:25:34,560
skipper
 

5699
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:37,590
skipper
so i cut across the bottom so i'm kind

5700
01:25:37,590 --> 01:25:37,600
so i cut across the bottom so i'm kind
 

5701
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:38,310
so i cut across the bottom so i'm kind
of

5702
01:25:38,310 --> 01:25:38,320
of
 

5703
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:39,830
of
almost coming out co-altitude as this

5704
01:25:39,830 --> 01:25:39,840
almost coming out co-altitude as this
 

5705
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:41,590
almost coming out co-altitude as this
thing's coming i'm gonna meet it

5706
01:25:41,590 --> 01:25:41,600
thing's coming i'm gonna meet it
 

5707
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:44,629
thing's coming i'm gonna meet it
and i'm driving and uh i get to probably

5708
01:25:44,629 --> 01:25:44,639
and i'm driving and uh i get to probably
 

5709
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:46,070
and i'm driving and uh i get to probably
it's i'm probably about a half mile away

5710
01:25:46,070 --> 01:25:46,080
it's i'm probably about a half mile away
 

5711
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:47,270
it's i'm probably about a half mile away
which you think well a half miles pretty

5712
01:25:47,270 --> 01:25:47,280
which you think well a half miles pretty
 

5713
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:49,189
which you think well a half miles pretty
far a half mile in aviation isn't

5714
01:25:49,189 --> 01:25:49,199
far a half mile in aviation isn't
 

5715
01:25:49,199 --> 01:25:51,110
far a half mile in aviation isn't
it's nothing that's i mean you can tell

5716
01:25:51,110 --> 01:25:51,120
it's nothing that's i mean you can tell
 

5717
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:52,709
it's nothing that's i mean you can tell
there's a pilot in an airplane you can

5718
01:25:52,709 --> 01:25:52,719
there's a pilot in an airplane you can
 

5719
01:25:52,719 --> 01:25:54,310
there's a pilot in an airplane you can
see all kinds of stuff at a half mile

5720
01:25:54,310 --> 01:25:54,320
see all kinds of stuff at a half mile
 

5721
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:56,470
see all kinds of stuff at a half mile
you can see pretty good detail so i'm

5722
01:25:56,470 --> 01:25:56,480
you can see pretty good detail so i'm
 

5723
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:58,070
you can see pretty good detail so i'm
like right there and it's coming across

5724
01:25:58,070 --> 01:25:58,080
like right there and it's coming across
 

5725
01:25:58,080 --> 01:25:59,510
like right there and it's coming across
my nose so now i'm basically pointing

5726
01:25:59,510 --> 01:25:59,520
my nose so now i'm basically pointing
 

5727
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:00,790
my nose so now i'm basically pointing
back towards the east so i'm cutting

5728
01:26:00,790 --> 01:26:00,800
back towards the east so i'm cutting
 

5729
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:01,270
back towards the east so i'm cutting
across

5730
01:26:01,270 --> 01:26:01,280
across
 

5731
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:02,470
across
because i'm going to the three o'clock

5732
01:26:02,470 --> 01:26:02,480
because i'm going to the three o'clock
 

5733
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:03,669
because i'm going to the three o'clock
position it's at two o'clock and i'm

5734
01:26:03,669 --> 01:26:03,679
position it's at two o'clock and i'm
 

5735
01:26:03,679 --> 01:26:05,430
position it's at two o'clock and i'm
gonna meet it at three o'clock

5736
01:26:05,430 --> 01:26:05,440
gonna meet it at three o'clock
 

5737
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:07,750
gonna meet it at three o'clock
so as i do this it goes it just

5738
01:26:07,750 --> 01:26:07,760
so as i do this it goes it just
 

5739
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:09,270
so as i do this it goes it just
accelerates and disappears so it's this

5740
01:26:09,270 --> 01:26:09,280
accelerates and disappears so it's this
 

5741
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:10,229
accelerates and disappears so it's this
happens at around

5742
01:26:10,229 --> 01:26:10,239
happens at around
 

5743
01:26:10,239 --> 01:26:11,990
happens at around
estimating about 12 000 feet so they're

5744
01:26:11,990 --> 01:26:12,000
estimating about 12 000 feet so they're
 

5745
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,510
estimating about 12 000 feet so they're
at 20. so they've got about 8 000 foot

5746
01:26:13,510 --> 01:26:13,520
at 20. so they've got about 8 000 foot
 

5747
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:15,990
at 20. so they've got about 8 000 foot
of altitude above us when this happens

5748
01:26:15,990 --> 01:26:16,000
of altitude above us when this happens
 

5749
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,910
of altitude above us when this happens
and it just as it crosses our nose it

5750
01:26:17,910 --> 01:26:17,920
and it just as it crosses our nose it
 

5751
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:19,270
and it just as it crosses our nose it
just it accelerates and

5752
01:26:19,270 --> 01:26:19,280
just it accelerates and
 

5753
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:21,430
just it accelerates and
literally in less than you know probably

5754
01:26:21,430 --> 01:26:21,440
literally in less than you know probably
 

5755
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:22,790
literally in less than you know probably
less than a half second it just goes and

5756
01:26:22,790 --> 01:26:22,800
less than a half second it just goes and
 

5757
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:24,229
less than a half second it just goes and
it's gone

5758
01:26:24,229 --> 01:26:24,239
it's gone
 

5759
01:26:24,239 --> 01:26:26,709
it's gone
and so we're like and i the first thing

5760
01:26:26,709 --> 01:26:26,719
and so we're like and i the first thing
 

5761

is dude
did you guys see it the other airplane's

5764
01:26:29,669 --> 01:26:29,679
did you guys see it the other airplane's
 

5765
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:31,030
did you guys see it the other airplane's
like it's gone we don't we

5766
01:26:31,030 --> 01:26:31,040
like it's gone we don't we
 

5767
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:33,110
like it's gone we don't we
have no idea where it's at so we kind of

5768
01:26:33,110 --> 01:26:33,120
have no idea where it's at so we kind of
 

5769
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:34,790
have no idea where it's at so we kind of
spin around rook i go let's see what's

5770
01:26:34,790 --> 01:26:34,800
spin around rook i go let's see what's

down here and i turn around we're
 

5773
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:37,750
down here and i turn around we're
looking for the white water

5774
01:26:37,750 --> 01:26:37,760
looking for the white water
 

5775
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:39,030
looking for the white water
we can't the white water's gone there's

5776
01:26:39,030 --> 01:26:39,040
we can't the white water's gone there's
 

5777
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:41,350
we can't the white water's gone there's
nothing it's literally all blue so now

5778
01:26:41,350 --> 01:26:41,360

5803
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:03,350
now i got to put on my real hat which we
have to train because we're getting

5804
01:27:03,350 --> 01:27:03,360
have to train because we're getting
 

5805
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:04,629
have to train because we're getting
ready to deploy

5806
01:27:04,629 --> 01:27:04,639
ready to deploy
 

5807
01:27:04,639 --> 01:27:06,629

to you know overseas so we got to get
 

5809
01:27:06,639 --> 01:27:07,669
to you know overseas so we got to get
our training done so

01:30:00,070 --> 01:30:00,080
about it different kinds of angles
 

6025
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:01,189
about it different kinds of angles
there's no good answers but it's

6026

tell it it's we don't broadcast it we
have a waypoint in the system

6056
01:30:26,070 --> 01:30:26,080
have a waypoint in the system
 

6057
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:27,750
have a waypoint in the system
but i don't know maybe it knew where we

6058
01:30:27,750 --> 01:30:27,760
but i don't know maybe it knew where we
 

6059
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:28,870
but i don't know maybe it knew where we
were going because we used the same one

6060
01:30:28,870 --> 01:30:28,880
were going because we used the same one
 

6061
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:31,270
were going because we used the same one
day after day after day

6062
01:30:31,270 --> 01:30:31,280
day after day after day
 

6063
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:33,270
day after day after day
but it it obviously knew but you never

01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:39,270
he took off when he got the video we
landed we told them hey look we just

6070
01:30:39,270 --> 01:30:39,280

landed we told them hey look we just
we just chased this thing they're like

6072
01:30:40,790 --> 01:30:40,800
we just chased this thing they're like
 

6073
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:42,629
we just chased this thing they're like
when i go chased it and they're like why

6074
01:30:42,629 --> 01:30:42,639
when i go chased it and they're like why
 

6075
01:30:42,639 --> 01:30:43,750
when i go chased it and they're like why
go

6076
01:30:43,750 --> 01:30:43,760
go
 

6077
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:46,310
go
dude and i told him i said dude get

6078
01:30:46,310 --> 01:30:46,320
dude and i told him i said dude get
 

6079
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:47,270
dude and i told him i said dude get
video and he goes

6080
01:30:47,270 --> 01:30:47,280
video and he goes
 

6081
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:48,870
video and he goes
so and that's how he is he's like i'm

6082
01:30:48,870 --> 01:30:48,880
so and that's how he is he's like i'm
 

6083
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:50,870
so and that's how he is he's like i'm
gonna go and he he was he he was

6084
01:30:50,870 --> 01:30:50,880
gonna go and he he was he he was
 

6085
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,310
gonna go and he he was he he was
determined he was gonna find this thing

6086
01:30:52,310 --> 01:30:52,320
determined he was gonna find this thing
 

6087
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:53,830
determined he was gonna find this thing
so

6088
01:30:53,830 --> 01:30:53,840
so
 

6089
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:55,270
so
when you look at his video and this is

6090
01:30:55,270 --> 01:30:55,280
when you look at his video and this is
 

6091
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:56,870
when you look at his video and this is
the stuff that isn't out that they don't

6092
01:30:56,870 --> 01:30:56,880
the stuff that isn't out that they don't
 

6093
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:57,510
the stuff that isn't out that they don't
see because

6094
01:30:57,510 --> 01:30:57,520
see because
 

6095
01:30:57,520 --> 01:30:59,270
see because
not all the all you see is the flare

6096
01:30:59,270 --> 01:30:59,280
not all the all you see is the flare
 

6097
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:01,030
not all the all you see is the flare
tape that's the targeting pod the

6098
01:31:01,030 --> 01:31:01,040
tape that's the targeting pod the
 

6099
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:03,030
tape that's the targeting pod the
forward-looking infrared receiver

6100
01:31:03,030 --> 01:31:03,040
forward-looking infrared receiver
 

6101
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:05,990
forward-looking infrared receiver
um i'll probably overlay the video when

6102
01:31:05,990 --> 01:31:06,000
um i'll probably overlay the video when
 

6103
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:06,870
um i'll probably overlay the video when
he goes out

6104
01:31:06,870 --> 01:31:06,880
he goes out
 

6105
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:08,870
he goes out
it's uh you know what he's looking at on

6106
01:31:08,870 --> 01:31:08,880
it's uh you know what he's looking at on
 

6107
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:10,790
it's uh you know what he's looking at on
his displays is he has basically two

6108
01:31:10,790 --> 01:31:10,800
his displays is he has basically two
 

6109
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:12,229
his displays is he has basically two
radar displays up

6110
01:31:12,229 --> 01:31:12,239
radar displays up
 

6111
01:31:12,239 --> 01:31:14,229
radar displays up
he has azimuth and range on the right

6112
01:31:14,229 --> 01:31:14,239
he has azimuth and range on the right
 

6113
01:31:14,239 --> 01:31:16,070
he has azimuth and range on the right
one and he has the azimuth and elevation

6114
01:31:16,070 --> 01:31:16,080
one and he has the azimuth and elevation
 

6115
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:17,590
one and he has the azimuth and elevation
on the left one so this is called the as

6116
01:31:17,590 --> 01:31:17,600
on the left one so this is called the as
 

6117
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:19,350
on the left one so this is called the as
l display and this is called

6118
01:31:19,350 --> 01:31:19,360
l display and this is called
 

6119
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:21,750
l display and this is called
this is basically the ppi which is the

6120
01:31:21,750 --> 01:31:21,760
this is basically the ppi which is the
 

6121
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:22,870
this is basically the ppi which is the
you're at the bottom of it

6122
01:31:22,870 --> 01:31:22,880
you're at the bottom of it
 

6123
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:24,790
you're at the bottom of it
you're at the bottom of the square it's

6124
01:31:24,790 --> 01:31:24,800
you're at the bottom of the square it's
 

6125
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,709
you're at the bottom of the square it's
really taken this it's taking a cone

6126
01:31:26,709 --> 01:31:26,719
really taken this it's taking a cone
 

6127
01:31:26,719 --> 01:31:28,149
really taken this it's taking a cone
because a radar really looks left and

6128
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:28,159
because a radar really looks left and
 

6129
01:31:28,159 --> 01:31:30,310
because a radar really looks left and
right from a point and it squares it out

6130
01:31:30,310 --> 01:31:30,320
right from a point and it squares it out
 

6131
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:31,990
right from a point and it squares it out
so the entire bottom of the scope that

6132
01:31:31,990 --> 01:31:32,000
so the entire bottom of the scope that
 

6133
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,669
so the entire bottom of the scope that
we look at is us

6134
01:31:33,669 --> 01:31:33,679
we look at is us
 

6135
01:31:33,679 --> 01:31:35,350
we look at is us
because they do this they square it off

6136
01:31:35,350 --> 01:31:35,360
because they do this they square it off
 

6137
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:37,830
because they do this they square it off
so so he goes out and when he first sees

6138
01:31:37,830 --> 01:31:37,840
so so he goes out and when he first sees
 

6139
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:39,350
so so he goes out and when he first sees
it he gets a radar return on it because

6140
01:31:39,350 --> 01:31:39,360
it he gets a radar return on it because
 

6141
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:40,709
it he gets a radar return on it because
when he's not trying to lock it so the

6142
01:31:40,709 --> 01:31:40,719
when he's not trying to lock it so the
 

6143
01:31:40,719 --> 01:31:41,990
when he's not trying to lock it so the
radar's just throwing energy out and

6144
01:31:41,990 --> 01:31:42,000
radar's just throwing energy out and
 

6145
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,310
radar's just throwing energy out and
getting it you know it's a doppler radar

6146
01:31:44,310 --> 01:31:44,320
getting it you know it's a doppler radar
 

6147
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:45,590
getting it you know it's a doppler radar
so when it's in search mode that's all

6148
01:31:45,590 --> 01:31:45,600
so when it's in search mode that's all
 

6149
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:47,350
so when it's in search mode that's all
it's doing it's going oh i can see you

6150
01:31:47,350 --> 01:31:47,360
it's doing it's going oh i can see you
 

6151
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:48,709
it's doing it's going oh i can see you
i can see and it's looking for return so

6152
01:31:48,709 --> 01:31:48,719
i can see and it's looking for return so
 

6153
01:31:48,719 --> 01:31:50,629
i can see and it's looking for return so
he gets a return so he wants to see what

6154
01:31:50,629 --> 01:31:50,639
he gets a return so he wants to see what
 

6155
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:51,750
he gets a return so he wants to see what
it is because all you get is a little

6156
01:31:51,750 --> 01:31:51,760
it is because all you get is a little
 

6157
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:53,270
it is because all you get is a little
green square unless it builds a track

6158
01:31:53,270 --> 01:31:53,280
green square unless it builds a track
 

6159
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:54,070
green square unless it builds a track
file on it

6160
01:31:54,070 --> 01:31:54,080
file on it
 

6161
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:55,270
file on it
but a little green square is just

6162
01:31:55,270 --> 01:31:55,280
but a little green square is just
 

6163
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:56,629
but a little green square is just
sitting there it's not moving because

6164
01:31:56,629 --> 01:31:56,639
sitting there it's not moving because
 

6165
01:31:56,639 --> 01:31:58,390
sitting there it's not moving because
it's it's sitting in one spot

6166
01:31:58,390 --> 01:31:58,400
it's it's sitting in one spot
 

6167
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:01,350
it's it's sitting in one spot
in space he locks it up when he goes to

6168
01:32:01,350 --> 01:32:01,360
in space he locks it up when he goes to
 

6169
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:02,709
in space he locks it up when he goes to
lock it up now he's putting a bunch of

6170
01:32:02,709 --> 01:32:02,719
lock it up now he's putting a bunch of
 

6171
01:32:02,719 --> 01:32:03,669
lock it up now he's putting a bunch of
energy on it

6172
01:32:03,669 --> 01:32:03,679
energy on it
 

6173
01:32:03,679 --> 01:32:05,110
energy on it
but he's telling the radar stare down

6174
01:32:05,110 --> 01:32:05,120
but he's telling the radar stare down
 

6175
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:06,629
but he's telling the radar stare down
that line of sight and whatever's there

6176
01:32:06,629 --> 01:32:06,639
that line of sight and whatever's there
 

6177
01:32:06,639 --> 01:32:07,669
that line of sight and whatever's there
i want you to grab it

6178
01:32:07,669 --> 01:32:07,679
i want you to grab it
 

6179
01:32:07,679 --> 01:32:09,030
i want you to grab it
and build a track file on it which will

6180
01:32:09,030 --> 01:32:09,040
and build a track file on it which will
 

6181
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:11,590
and build a track file on it which will
tell us how high it is how fast it is in

6182
01:32:11,590 --> 01:32:11,600
tell us how high it is how fast it is in
 

6183
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:11,990
tell us how high it is how fast it is in
the direction

6184
01:32:11,990 --> 01:32:12,000
the direction
 

6185
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,430
the direction
that it's going okay the radar smart

6186
01:32:15,430 --> 01:32:15,440
that it's going okay the radar smart
 

6187
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:17,030
that it's going okay the radar smart
enough that when the signal comes back

6188
01:32:17,030 --> 01:32:17,040
enough that when the signal comes back
 

6189
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:18,390
enough that when the signal comes back
if it's been messed with

6190
01:32:18,390 --> 01:32:18,400
if it's been messed with
 

6191
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:19,590
if it's been messed with
it will tell you it'll give you

6192
01:32:19,590 --> 01:32:19,600
it will tell you it'll give you
 

6193
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:21,510
it will tell you it'll give you
indications that i'm being jammed

6194
01:32:21,510 --> 01:32:21,520
indications that i'm being jammed
 

6195
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:22,870
indications that i'm being jammed
so that's all it is is you send the

6196
01:32:22,870 --> 01:32:22,880
so that's all it is is you send the
 

6197
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:25,110
so that's all it is is you send the
signal out something it manipulates the

6198
01:32:25,110 --> 01:32:25,120
signal out something it manipulates the
 

6199
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:27,030
signal out something it manipulates the
signal either in range and velocity or

6200
01:32:27,030 --> 01:32:27,040
signal either in range and velocity or
 

6201
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:28,390
signal either in range and velocity or
whatever and it sends it back

6202
01:32:28,390 --> 01:32:28,400
whatever and it sends it back
 

6203
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:30,470
whatever and it sends it back
and the radar was smart enough to go

6204
01:32:30,470 --> 01:32:30,480
and the radar was smart enough to go
 

6205
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:32,709
and the radar was smart enough to go
that is not a return that i'm expecting

6206
01:32:32,709 --> 01:32:32,719
that is not a return that i'm expecting
 

6207
01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:34,149
that is not a return that i'm expecting
something's messing with me i'm being

6208
01:32:34,149 --> 01:32:34,159
something's messing with me i'm being
 

6209
01:32:34,159 --> 01:32:35,750
something's messing with me i'm being
jammed and it shows you and it puts

6210
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:35,760
jammed and it shows you and it puts
 

6211
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:37,430
jammed and it shows you and it puts
strobes up it gives these lines on the

6212
01:32:37,430 --> 01:32:37,440
strobes up it gives these lines on the
 

6213
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:38,830
strobes up it gives these lines on the
radar and it does some

6214
01:32:38,830 --> 01:32:38,840
radar and it does some
 

6215
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:40,790
radar and it does some
stuff so you can immediately well it

6216
01:32:40,790 --> 01:32:40,800
stuff so you can immediately well it
 

6217
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:41,830
stuff so you can immediately well it
does it goes full into

6218
01:32:41,830 --> 01:32:41,840
does it goes full into
 

6219
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:43,430
does it goes full into
it it's being jammed in about every mode

6220
01:32:43,430 --> 01:32:43,440
it it's being jammed in about every mode
 

6221
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:44,790
it it's being jammed in about every mode
you can possibly see because everything

6222
01:32:44,790 --> 01:32:44,800
you can possibly see because everything
 

6223
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:45,750
you can possibly see because everything
comes up and the

6224
01:32:45,750 --> 01:32:45,760
comes up and the
 

6225
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:47,590
comes up and the
the this aspect gets long it's all kinds

6226
01:32:47,590 --> 01:32:47,600
the this aspect gets long it's all kinds
 

6227
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:48,790
the this aspect gets long it's all kinds
i don't want to get into details but you

6228
01:32:48,790 --> 01:32:48,800
i don't want to get into details but you
 

6229
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:50,629
i don't want to get into details but you
can tell it's being jammed

6230
01:32:50,629 --> 01:32:50,639
can tell it's being jammed
 

6231
01:32:50,639 --> 01:32:52,390
can tell it's being jammed
so and as you said on rogan by the way

6232
01:32:52,390 --> 01:32:52,400
so and as you said on rogan by the way
 

6233
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:54,470
so and as you said on rogan by the way
that jamming is an act of war active

6234
01:32:54,470 --> 01:32:54,480
that jamming is an act of war active
 

6235
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:55,110
that jamming is an act of war active
jamming isn't

6236
01:32:55,110 --> 01:32:55,120
jamming isn't
 

6237
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:56,550
jamming isn't
when you actively jam another platform

6238
01:32:56,550 --> 01:32:56,560
when you actively jam another platform
 

6239
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:58,070
when you actively jam another platform
yes it's technically an active work

6240
01:32:58,070 --> 01:32:58,080
yes it's technically an active work
 

6241
01:32:58,080 --> 01:32:59,510
yes it's technically an active work
feels like you should be freaking out at

6242
01:32:59,510 --> 01:32:59,520
feels like you should be freaking out at
 

6243
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,390
feels like you should be freaking out at
this point

6244
01:33:00,390 --> 01:33:00,400
this point
 

6245
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:03,430
this point
i mean so well he does it and then in

6246
01:33:03,430 --> 01:33:03,440
i mean so well he does it and then in
 

6247
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:05,110
i mean so well he does it and then in
the back seat so they don't have a stick

6248
01:33:05,110 --> 01:33:05,120
the back seat so they don't have a stick
 

6249
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:06,070
the back seat so they don't have a stick
and throttle they have

6250
01:33:06,070 --> 01:33:06,080
and throttle they have
 

6251
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:07,430
and throttle they have
their side stick controller so they can

6252
01:33:07,430 --> 01:33:07,440
their side stick controller so they can
 

6253
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:09,350
their side stick controller so they can
control all the sensors and they can

6254
01:33:09,350 --> 01:33:09,360
control all the sensors and they can
 

6255
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:11,750
control all the sensors and they can
just toggle around and do stuff so

6256
01:33:11,750 --> 01:33:11,760
just toggle around and do stuff so
 

6257
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:13,590
just toggle around and do stuff so
he can he has the ability to just move

6258
01:33:13,590 --> 01:33:13,600
he can he has the ability to just move
 

6259
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:14,950
he can he has the ability to just move
one switch real quick and it will go

6260
01:33:14,950 --> 01:33:14,960
one switch real quick and it will go
 

6261
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:16,629
one switch real quick and it will go
from that azimuth elevation on the radar

6262
01:33:16,629 --> 01:33:16,639
from that azimuth elevation on the radar
 

6263
01:33:16,639 --> 01:33:18,070
from that azimuth elevation on the radar
to the targeting pod

6264
01:33:18,070 --> 01:33:18,080
to the targeting pod
 

6265
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:19,750
to the targeting pod
well as soon as he commanded the radar

6266
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:19,760
well as soon as he commanded the radar
 

6267
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:21,270
well as soon as he commanded the radar
to look at that target

6268
01:33:21,270 --> 01:33:21,280
to look at that target
 

6269
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:22,870
to look at that target
the targeting pod goes oh what's over

6270
01:33:22,870 --> 01:33:22,880
the targeting pod goes oh what's over
 

6271
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:24,070
the targeting pod goes oh what's over
there and it'll stare because it goes

6272
01:33:24,070 --> 01:33:24,080
there and it'll stare because it goes
 

6273
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:25,189
there and it'll stare because it goes
down the line of sight because all the

6274
01:33:25,189 --> 01:33:25,199
down the line of sight because all the
 

6275
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:26,870
down the line of sight because all the
systems are hooked together

6276
01:33:26,870 --> 01:33:26,880
systems are hooked together
 

6277
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:28,310
systems are hooked together
you can decouple them but they're going

6278
01:33:28,310 --> 01:33:28,320
you can decouple them but they're going
 

6279
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:29,910
you can decouple them but they're going
to automatically couple up

6280
01:33:29,910 --> 01:33:29,920
to automatically couple up
 

6281
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:32,550
to automatically couple up
so when he castles over he it's a switch

6282
01:33:32,550 --> 01:33:32,560
so when he castles over he it's a switch
 

6283
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:34,070
so when he castles over he it's a switch
looks like a castle switch was a castle

6284
01:33:34,070 --> 01:33:34,080
looks like a castle switch was a castle
 

6285
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:34,470
looks like a castle switch was a castle
so

6286
01:33:34,470 --> 01:33:34,480
so
 

6287
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:35,990
so
when he moves that thing to the left and

6288
01:33:35,990 --> 01:33:36,000
when he moves that thing to the left and
 

6289
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,910
when he moves that thing to the left and
he swaps the displays out and he says

6290
01:33:37,910 --> 01:33:37,920
he swaps the displays out and he says
 

6291
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:38,950
he swaps the displays out and he says
instead of looking at the radar i want

6292
01:33:38,950 --> 01:33:38,960
instead of looking at the radar i want
 

6293
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:40,470
instead of looking at the radar i want
to look at the targeting pod

6294
01:33:40,470 --> 01:33:40,480
to look at the targeting pod
 

6295
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:41,830
to look at the targeting pod
he sees it on the targeting pod because

6296
01:33:41,830 --> 01:33:41,840
he sees it on the targeting pod because
 

6297
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:43,830
he sees it on the targeting pod because
the targeting pods already looking there

6298
01:33:43,830 --> 01:33:43,840
the targeting pods already looking there
 

6299
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:45,430
the targeting pods already looking there
and now he's on a passive track because

6300
01:33:45,430 --> 01:33:45,440
and now he's on a passive track because
 

6301
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:47,189
and now he's on a passive track because
he's not literally sending any energy

6302
01:33:47,189 --> 01:33:47,199
he's not literally sending any energy
 

6303
01:33:47,199 --> 01:33:49,350
he's not literally sending any energy
out he's just receiving ir energy from

6304
01:33:49,350 --> 01:33:49,360
out he's just receiving ir energy from
 

6305
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:51,830
out he's just receiving ir energy from
the tic tac and then the system itself

6306
01:33:51,830 --> 01:33:51,840
the tic tac and then the system itself
 

6307
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:52,790
the tic tac and then the system itself
will track

6308
01:33:52,790 --> 01:33:52,800
will track
 

6309
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:54,790
will track
the pixels and the contrast differences

6310
01:33:54,790 --> 01:33:54,800
the pixels and the contrast differences
 

6311
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:55,990
the pixels and the contrast differences
it depends on what mode you're in

6312
01:33:55,990 --> 01:33:56,000
it depends on what mode you're in
 

6313
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,189
it depends on what mode you're in
so it says oh and that's what those

6314
01:33:57,189 --> 01:33:57,199
so it says oh and that's what those
 

6315
01:33:57,199 --> 01:33:58,310
so it says oh and that's what those
little bars you see in the video where

6316
01:33:58,310 --> 01:33:58,320
little bars you see in the video where
 

6317
01:33:58,320 --> 01:33:59,189
little bars you see in the video where
the bars come up let's

6318
01:33:59,189 --> 01:33:59,199
the bars come up let's
 

6319
01:33:59,199 --> 01:34:02,149
the bars come up let's
do some v vision based tracking that's

6320
01:34:02,149 --> 01:34:02,159
do some v vision based tracking that's
 

6321
01:34:02,159 --> 01:34:03,110
do some v vision based tracking that's
exactly what it is

6322
01:34:03,110 --> 01:34:03,120
exactly what it is
 

6323
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:06,470
exactly what it is
um so that's the video he goes through

6324
01:34:06,470 --> 01:34:06,480
um so that's the video he goes through
 

6325
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:08,629
um so that's the video he goes through
changes zooms changes the momentum he

6326
01:34:08,629 --> 01:34:08,639
changes zooms changes the momentum he
 

6327
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:09,830
changes zooms changes the momentum he
goes through all the modes so there's a

6328
01:34:09,830 --> 01:34:09,840
goes through all the modes so there's a
 

6329
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:10,310
goes through all the modes so there's a
narrow

6330
01:34:10,310 --> 01:34:10,320
narrow
 

6331
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:12,950
narrow
medium and wide so wide is far away

6332
01:34:12,950 --> 01:34:12,960
medium and wide so wide is far away
 

6333
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:14,790
medium and wide so wide is far away
medium and then narrow and then

6334
01:34:14,790 --> 01:34:14,800
medium and then narrow and then
 

6335
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:16,709
medium and then narrow and then
there's the tv mode and he goes from ir

6336
01:34:16,709 --> 01:34:16,719
there's the tv mode and he goes from ir
 

6337
01:34:16,719 --> 01:34:18,229
there's the tv mode and he goes from ir
mode to the tv mode

6338
01:34:18,229 --> 01:34:18,239
mode to the tv mode
 

6339
01:34:18,239 --> 01:34:21,750
mode to the tv mode
the cool thing with the tv mode is

6340
01:34:21,750 --> 01:34:21,760
the cool thing with the tv mode is
 

6341
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:25,990
the cool thing with the tv mode is
narrow ir mode is only medium tv mode so

6342
01:34:25,990 --> 01:34:26,000
narrow ir mode is only medium tv mode so
 

6343
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:26,790
narrow ir mode is only medium tv mode so
you can actually get

6344
01:34:26,790 --> 01:34:26,800
you can actually get
 

6345
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:28,470
you can actually get
closer with narrow tv mode it's got a

6346
01:34:28,470 --> 01:34:28,480
closer with narrow tv mode it's got a
 

6347
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:29,830
closer with narrow tv mode it's got a
better zoom capability when you go into

6348
01:34:29,830 --> 01:34:29,840
better zoom capability when you go into
 

6349
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:31,030
better zoom capability when you go into
tv mode

6350
01:34:31,030 --> 01:34:31,040
tv mode
 

6351
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:33,110
tv mode
um so he goes through all those things

6352
01:34:33,110 --> 01:34:33,120
um so he goes through all those things
 

6353
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:34,310
um so he goes through all those things
that's when you see it going from a

6354
01:34:34,310 --> 01:34:34,320
that's when you see it going from a
 

6355
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:35,510
that's when you see it going from a
black background to a white background

6356
01:34:35,510 --> 01:34:35,520
black background to a white background
 

6357
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:36,790
black background to a white background
he's trying to figure out what the heck

6358
01:34:36,790 --> 01:34:36,800
he's trying to figure out what the heck
 

6359
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:37,350
he's trying to figure out what the heck
is this

6360
01:34:37,350 --> 01:34:37,360
is this
 

6361
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:38,629
is this
well yeah and he wants to get as much

6362
01:34:38,629 --> 01:34:38,639
well yeah and he wants to get as much
 

6363
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:40,229
well yeah and he wants to get as much
data as he can on it based on the

6364
01:34:40,229 --> 01:34:40,239
data as he can on it based on the
 

6365
01:34:40,239 --> 01:34:41,510
data as he can on it based on the
different modes instead of just staring

6366
01:34:41,510 --> 01:34:41,520
different modes instead of just staring
 

6367
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:43,030
different modes instead of just staring
at it going what is that thing

6368
01:34:43,030 --> 01:34:43,040
at it going what is that thing
 

6369
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:46,390
at it going what is that thing
um green so that the video has been out

6370
01:34:46,390 --> 01:34:46,400
um green so that the video has been out
 

6371
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:47,990
um green so that the video has been out
for it it actually was on youtube for

6372
01:34:47,990 --> 01:34:48,000
for it it actually was on youtube for
 

6373
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,030

that get on
strangeland.com so the next thing you

6408
01:35:30,390 --> 01:35:30,400
strangeland.com so the next thing you
 

6409
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:31,830
strangeland.com so the next thing you
know it ends up on

6410
01:35:31,830 --> 01:35:31,840
know it ends up on
 

6411
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:34,550
know it ends up on
youtube which was cool because you can

6412
01:35:34,550 --> 01:35:34,560
youtube which was cool because you can

please correct me but
 

6901
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:40,229
please correct me but
you you have mentioned that like on

6902
01:42:40,229 --> 01:42:40,239
you you have mentioned that like on
 

6903
01:42:40,239 --> 01:42:41,350
you you have mentioned that like on
rogan i think

6904
01:42:41,350 --> 01:42:41,360
rogan i think
 

6905
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:44,709
rogan i think
that you watched it on you know on a

6906
01:42:44,709 --> 01:42:44,719
that you watched it on you know on a
 

6907
01:42:44,719 --> 01:42:46,390
that you watched it on you know on a
bigger screen it felt like it was higher

6908
01:42:46,390 --> 01:42:46,400
bigger screen it felt like it was higher
 

6909
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:47,510
bigger screen it felt like it was higher
definition

6910
01:42:47,510 --> 01:42:47,520
definition
 

6911
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:51,510
definition
so let me ask the the question

6912
01:42:51,510 --> 01:42:51,520
so let me ask the the question
 

6913
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:53,590
so let me ask the the question
is there a higher definition version do

6914
01:42:53,590 --> 01:42:53,600
is there a higher definition version do
 

6915
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:54,870
is there a higher definition version do
you think of the

6916
01:42:54,870 --> 01:42:54,880
you think of the
 

6917
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:57,669
you think of the
flair video that would give us more

6918
01:42:57,669 --> 01:42:57,679
flair video that would give us more
 

6919
01:42:57,679 --> 01:42:59,270
flair video that would give us more
pixels and more information

6920
01:42:59,270 --> 01:42:59,280
pixels and more information
 

6921
01:42:59,280 --> 01:43:02,470
pixels and more information
presumably because of the um

6922
01:43:02,470 --> 01:43:02,480
presumably because of the um
 

6923
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:04,550
presumably because of the um
because i don't know where the stuff

6924
01:43:04,550 --> 01:43:04,560
because i don't know where the stuff
 

6925
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:05,750
because i don't know where the stuff
that the government released i don't

6926
01:43:05,750 --> 01:43:05,760
that the government released i don't
 

6927
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:06,390
that the government released i don't
know where they got

6928
01:43:06,390 --> 01:43:06,400
know where they got
 

6929
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:07,430
know where they got
okay so the stuff that was on

6930
01:43:07,430 --> 01:43:07,440
okay so the stuff that was on
 

6931
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:09,189
okay so the stuff that was on
strangeland and youtube you know someone

6932
01:43:09,189 --> 01:43:09,199
strangeland and youtube you know someone
 

6933
01:43:09,199 --> 01:43:10,550
strangeland and youtube you know someone
pulled off of a secret

6934
01:43:10,550 --> 01:43:10,560
pulled off of a secret
 

6935
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:12,709
pulled off of a secret
it looks like a rack you know there's

6936
01:43:12,709 --> 01:43:12,719
it looks like a rack you know there's
 

6937
01:43:12,719 --> 01:43:13,830
it looks like a rack you know there's
tape machines in there and it gets

6938
01:43:13,830 --> 01:43:13,840
tape machines in there and it gets
 

6939
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:15,109
tape machines in there and it gets
converted to digital and stored on a

6940
01:43:15,109 --> 01:43:15,119
converted to digital and stored on a
 

6941
01:43:15,119 --> 01:43:16,229
converted to digital and stored on a
hard drive and they pulled it off that

6942
01:43:16,229 --> 01:43:16,239
hard drive and they pulled it off that
 

6943
01:43:16,239 --> 01:43:19,030
hard drive and they pulled it off that
hard drive and they put it on youtube

6944
01:43:19,030 --> 01:43:19,040
hard drive and they put it on youtube
 

6945
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:21,590
hard drive and they put it on youtube
um no it's it's just like you know

6946
01:43:21,590 --> 01:43:21,600
um no it's it's just like you know
 

6947
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:22,229
um no it's it's just like you know
anytime

6948
01:43:22,229 --> 01:43:22,239
anytime
 

6949
01:43:22,239 --> 01:43:23,910
anytime
even a digital media the more you copy

6950
01:43:23,910 --> 01:43:23,920
even a digital media the more you copy
 

6951
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:25,590
even a digital media the more you copy
digital media there's some quality that

6952
01:43:25,590 --> 01:43:25,600
digital media there's some quality that
 

6953
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:26,790
digital media there's some quality that
gets it degrades

6954
01:43:26,790 --> 01:43:26,800
gets it degrades
 

6955
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:28,070
gets it degrades
so this you don't know how many times

6956
01:43:28,070 --> 01:43:28,080
so this you don't know how many times
 

6957
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:29,830
so this you don't know how many times
this has been copied so we were looking

6958
01:43:29,830 --> 01:43:29,840
this has been copied so we were looking
 

6959
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:31,109
this has been copied so we were looking
the videos i've seen are right off the

6960
01:43:31,109 --> 01:43:31,119
the videos i've seen are right off the
 

6961
01:43:31,119 --> 01:43:32,790
the videos i've seen are right off the
original they're high eight tapes that's

6962
01:43:32,790 --> 01:43:32,800
original they're high eight tapes that's
 

6963
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:34,149
original they're high eight tapes that's
basically pulled off the back of the

6964
01:43:34,149 --> 01:43:34,159
basically pulled off the back of the
 

6965
01:43:34,159 --> 01:43:35,669
basically pulled off the back of the
display so it's not filmed with cameras

6966
01:43:35,669 --> 01:43:35,679
display so it's not filmed with cameras
 

6967
01:43:35,679 --> 01:43:36,950
display so it's not filmed with cameras
it's literally a digital feed it's

6968
01:43:36,950 --> 01:43:36,960
it's literally a digital feed it's
 

6969
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:37,990
it's literally a digital feed it's
pulled off the back

6970
01:43:37,990 --> 01:43:38,000
pulled off the back
 

6971
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:39,510
pulled off the back
and put onto a high eight tape that's

6972
01:43:39,510 --> 01:43:39,520
and put onto a high eight tape that's
 

6973
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:41,590
and put onto a high eight tape that's
how the recorders work now it's actually

6974
01:43:41,590 --> 01:43:41,600
how the recorders work now it's actually
 

6975
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:42,950
how the recorders work now it's actually
digital to digital it's not even on

6976
01:43:42,950 --> 01:43:42,960
digital to digital it's not even on
 

6977
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:44,550
digital to digital it's not even on
tapes anymore it's it's a digital

6978
01:43:44,550 --> 01:43:44,560
tapes anymore it's it's a digital
 

6979
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:45,750
tapes anymore it's it's a digital
recording system but we were still in

6980
01:43:45,750 --> 01:43:45,760
recording system but we were still in
 

6981
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:46,950
recording system but we were still in
that process of slowing up because

6982
01:43:46,950 --> 01:43:46,960
that process of slowing up because
 

6983
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:48,790
that process of slowing up because
originally we had little cameras here

6984
01:43:48,790 --> 01:43:48,800
originally we had little cameras here
 

6985
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:50,629
originally we had little cameras here
that shine so if the light hit it would

6986
01:43:50,629 --> 01:43:50,639
that shine so if the light hit it would
 

6987
01:43:50,639 --> 01:43:52,550
that shine so if the light hit it would
wash out the displays so this it's a

6988
01:43:52,550 --> 01:43:52,560
wash out the displays so this it's a
 

6989
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:53,910
wash out the displays so this it's a
pretty good feed

6990
01:43:53,910 --> 01:43:53,920
pretty good feed
 

6991
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:56,229
pretty good feed
um when you put it on so we're instead

01:43:56,229 --> 01:43:56,239
um when you put it on so we're instead
 

6993
01:43:56,239 --> 01:43:57,750
um when you put it on so we're instead

01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:29,750
tv mode when i say there's little things
coming out of the bottom of it you could

7026
01:44:29,750 --> 01:44:29,760
coming out of the bottom of it you could
 

7027
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:30,390
coming out of the bottom of it you could
see those

7028
01:44:30,390 --> 01:44:30,400
see those
 

7029
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:33,030

it was very clear but in terms of the

7030
01:44:33,030 --> 01:44:33,040
it was very clear but in terms of the
 

7031
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:34,310
it was very clear but in terms of the
actual

7032
01:44:34,310 --> 01:44:34,320
actual
 

7033
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:37,430
actual
visual on the tic tac was it did you get

7034
01:44:37,430 --> 01:44:37,440
visual on the tic tac was it did you get
 

7035
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:39,510
visual on the tic tac was it did you get
much more information from the higher

7036
01:44:39,510 --> 01:44:39,520
much more information from the higher
 

7037
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:41,270
much more information from the higher
from the clear little things out of the

7038
01:44:41,270 --> 01:44:41,280
from the clear little things out of the
 

7039

bottom
to the bottom information so when you

7042
01:44:44,229 --> 01:44:44,239
to the bottom information so when you
 

7043
01:44:44,239 --> 01:44:45,350
to the bottom information so when you
see it because he's coming almost

7044

01:44:46,719 --> 01:44:48,310
co-altitude with it you can see the
bottom of it it looks like little

7048
01:44:48,310 --> 01:44:48,320
bottom of it it looks like little
 

7049

a lot of people especially when they

7380

a lot of people especially when they
 

7381
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:46,390
a lot of people especially when they
hear your story are like wow this is

7382
01:49:46,390 --> 01:49:46,400
hear your story are like wow this is
 

7383
01:49:46,400 --> 01:49:47,830
hear your story are like wow this is
really interesting

7384

really interesting
 

7385
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:50,950
really interesting
but you you don't even know you one

7386
01:49:50,950 --> 01:49:50,960
but you you don't even know you one
 

7387
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:54,070
but you you don't even know you one
you're afraid to talk about it and two

7388
01:49:54,070 --> 01:49:54,080
you're afraid to talk about it and two
 

7389
01:49:54,080 --> 01:49:55,430
you're afraid to talk about it and two
you don't know what the next steps are

7390
01:49:55,430 --> 01:49:55,440
you don't know what the next steps are
 

7391
01:49:55,440 --> 01:49:57,030
you don't know what the next steps are
like how can we seriously

7392
01:49:57,030 --> 01:49:57,040
like how can we seriously
 

7393
01:49:57,040 --> 01:50:00,790
like how can we seriously
try to think about what you saw

7394
01:50:00,790 --> 01:50:00,800
try to think about what you saw
 

7395
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:03,830
try to think about what you saw
how to think about how we further look

7396
01:50:03,830 --> 01:50:03,840
how to think about how we further look
 

7397
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:05,189
how to think about how we further look
for things like it

7398
01:50:05,189 --> 01:50:05,199
for things like it
 

7399
01:50:05,199 --> 01:50:09,030
for things like it
how we develop systems and plans

7400
01:50:09,030 --> 01:50:09,040
how we develop systems and plans
 

7401
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:12,390
how we develop systems and plans
for how in the future we can

7402
01:50:12,390 --> 01:50:12,400
for how in the future we can
 

7403
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:14,629
for how in the future we can
immediately collect a lot more data and

7404
01:50:14,629 --> 01:50:14,639
immediately collect a lot more data and
 

7405
01:50:14,639 --> 01:50:16,550
immediately collect a lot more data and
try to react

7406
01:50:16,550 --> 01:50:16,560
try to react
 

7407
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:18,950
try to react
uh properly you know to try to

7408
01:50:18,950 --> 01:50:18,960
uh properly you know to try to
 

7409
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:20,149
uh properly you know to try to
communicate try to

7410
01:50:20,149 --> 01:50:20,159
communicate try to
 

7411
01:50:20,159 --> 01:50:23,510
communicate try to
uh interpret this in in the best way

7412
01:50:23,510 --> 01:50:23,520
uh interpret this in in the best way
 

7413
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:24,070
uh interpret this in in the best way
possible

7414
01:50:24,070 --> 01:50:24,080
possible
 

7415
01:50:24,080 --> 01:50:26,310
possible
from a scientific perspective and i i

7416
01:50:26,310 --> 01:50:26,320
from a scientific perspective and i i
 

7417
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:28,390
from a scientific perspective and i i
just would love to

7418
01:50:28,390 --> 01:50:28,400
just would love to
 

7419
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:31,430
just would love to
remove stigma from this subject

7420
01:50:31,430 --> 01:50:31,440
remove stigma from this subject
 

7421
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:33,750
remove stigma from this subject
uh well i think that's the first step we

7422
01:50:33,750 --> 01:50:33,760
uh well i think that's the first step we
 

7423
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:34,709
uh well i think that's the first step we
have done

7424
01:50:34,709 --> 01:50:34,719
have done
 

7425
01:50:34,719 --> 01:50:37,430
have done
in this country an absolutely terrible

7426
01:50:37,430 --> 01:50:37,440
in this country an absolutely terrible
 

7427
01:50:37,440 --> 01:50:39,189
in this country an absolutely terrible
job with these things so you go

7428
01:50:39,189 --> 01:50:39,199
job with these things so you go
 

7429
01:50:39,199 --> 01:50:41,830
job with these things so you go
and i joke you know go back to roswell

7430
01:50:41,830 --> 01:50:41,840
and i joke you know go back to roswell
 

7431
01:50:41,840 --> 01:50:43,350
and i joke you know go back to roswell
so the first reports that came out of

7432
01:50:43,350 --> 01:50:43,360
so the first reports that came out of
 

7433
01:50:43,360 --> 01:50:45,270
so the first reports that came out of
roswell was we have this crash flying

7434
01:50:45,270 --> 01:50:45,280
roswell was we have this crash flying
 

7435
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:46,070
roswell was we have this crash flying
saucer

7436
01:50:46,070 --> 01:50:46,080
saucer
 

7437
01:50:46,080 --> 01:50:48,149
saucer
that's literally what came out and then

7438
01:50:48,149 --> 01:50:48,159
that's literally what came out and then
 

7439
01:50:48,159 --> 01:50:49,589
that's literally what came out and then
magically the next day

7440
01:50:49,589 --> 01:50:49,599
magically the next day
 

7441
01:50:49,599 --> 01:50:50,550
magically the next day
it's a weather balloon and they're

7442
01:50:50,550 --> 01:50:50,560
it's a weather balloon and they're
 

7443
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:52,550
it's a weather balloon and they're
showing you pieces of mylar and you go

7444
01:50:52,550 --> 01:50:52,560
showing you pieces of mylar and you go
 

7445
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:53,669
showing you pieces of mylar and you go
well that doesn't look like what they

7446
01:50:53,669 --> 01:50:53,679
well that doesn't look like what they
 

7447
01:50:53,679 --> 01:50:55,109
well that doesn't look like what they
showed us yesterday

7448
01:50:55,109 --> 01:50:55,119
showed us yesterday
 

7449
01:50:55,119 --> 01:50:56,629
showed us yesterday
then you get into project blue book you

7450
01:50:56,629 --> 01:50:56,639
then you get into project blue book you
 

7451
01:50:56,639 --> 01:50:57,750
then you get into project blue book you
know so there's that whole series about

7452
01:50:57,750 --> 01:50:57,760
know so there's that whole series about
 

7453
01:50:57,760 --> 01:50:59,270
know so there's that whole series about
project blue book but the bottom line of

7454
01:50:59,270 --> 01:50:59,280
project blue book but the bottom line of
 

7455
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:00,709
project blue book but the bottom line of
project blue book is it really did two

7456
01:51:00,709 --> 01:51:00,719
project blue book is it really did two
 

7457
01:51:00,719 --> 01:51:02,790
project blue book is it really did two
things it investigated sightings

7458
01:51:02,790 --> 01:51:02,800
things it investigated sightings
 

7459
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:04,310
things it investigated sightings
and it did everything it could to debunk

7460
01:51:04,310 --> 01:51:04,320
and it did everything it could to debunk
 

7461
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:06,709
and it did everything it could to debunk
and disprove to the point where it

7462
01:51:06,709 --> 01:51:06,719
and disprove to the point where it
 

7463
01:51:06,719 --> 01:51:08,390
and disprove to the point where it
actually went to discredit

7464
01:51:08,390 --> 01:51:08,400
actually went to discredit
 

7465
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:10,550
actually went to discredit
you know to make you look so there's

7466
01:51:10,550 --> 01:51:10,560
you know to make you look so there's
 

7467
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:12,629

always been this
 

7469
01:51:12,639 --> 01:51:14,070
always been this
this i don't know if you'd call it an

7470
01:51:14,070 --> 01:51:14,080
this i don't know if you'd call it an
 

7471
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:16,310
this i don't know if you'd call it an
aura around it or a mystique about ufos

7472
01:51:16,310 --> 01:51:16,320
aura around it or a mystique about ufos
 

7473
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:17,270
aura around it or a mystique about ufos
that if you're talking about them

7474
01:51:17,270 --> 01:51:17,280
that if you're talking about them
 

7475
01:51:17,280 --> 01:51:18,790
that if you're talking about them
they're nuts

7476
01:51:18,790 --> 01:51:18,800
they're nuts
 

7477
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:20,629
they're nuts

better chance of winning the mega ball

7488
01:51:31,350 --> 01:51:31,360
better chance of winning the mega ball
 

7489
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:32,629
better chance of winning the mega ball
lottery

7490

than we're the only planet that has life

01:51:35,109 --> 01:51:35,119
than we're the only planet that has life
 

7493
01:51:35,119 --> 01:51:36,629
than we're the only planet that has life
on it in the universe it's just

the odds are against it if you do just
 

7497
01:51:39,119 --> 01:51:40,310
the odds are against it if you do just
do the math

do the math
 

7499
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:42,629
do the math
you have to accept because it if there

7500
01:51:42,629 --> 01:51:42,639
you have to accept because it if there
 

7501
01:51:42,639 --> 01:51:44,550
you have to accept because it if there
only has to be one other planet that has

only has to be one other planet that has

life on it
 

7505
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:48,550
life on it
and then i win and you lose and then

more and more science has shown that

7508
01:51:49,750 --> 01:51:49,760
more and more science has shown that
 

7509
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:52,070
more and more science has shown that
there's habitable planets out there

7510
01:51:52,070 --> 01:51:52,080
there's habitable planets out there
 

7511
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:54,229
there's habitable planets out there
that yeah everything we've learned so

7512
01:51:54,229 --> 01:51:54,239
that yeah everything we've learned so
 

7513
01:51:54,239 --> 01:51:55,510
that yeah everything we've learned so
far and we know very little but

7514
01:51:55,510 --> 01:51:55,520
far and we know very little but
 

7515
01:51:55,520 --> 01:51:56,870
far and we know very little but
everything we've learned so far

everything we've learned so far

01:51:56,880 --> 01:52:01,030
everything we've learned so far
about the planets out there exoplanets

7518
01:52:01,030 --> 01:52:01,040
about the planets out there exoplanets
 

7519
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:03,669
about the planets out there exoplanets
earth-like planets it seems that it's

7520
01:52:03,669 --> 01:52:03,679
earth-like planets it seems that it's
 

7521
01:52:03,679 --> 01:52:04,390
earth-like planets it seems that it's
very

7522
01:52:04,390 --> 01:52:04,400
very
 

7523
01:52:04,400 --> 01:52:06,070
very
likely that there's life out there

7524
01:52:06,070 --> 01:52:06,080
likely that there's life out there
 

7525
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:07,910
likely that there's life out there
intelligent life is another topic

7526
01:52:07,910 --> 01:52:07,920
intelligent life is another topic
 

7527
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:10,950
intelligent life is another topic
but uh life well we we as humans you

7528
01:52:10,950 --> 01:52:10,960
but uh life well we we as humans you
 

7529
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:11,270
but uh life well we we as humans you
know

7530
01:52:11,270 --> 01:52:11,280
know
 

7531
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:12,950
know
and even more as americans we have this

7532
01:52:12,950 --> 01:52:12,960
and even more as americans we have this
 

7533
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:15,990
and even more as americans we have this
hubris about us that says

7534
01:52:15,990 --> 01:52:16,000
hubris about us that says
 

7535
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,109
hubris about us that says
are it and you go not so much

7536
01:52:19,109 --> 01:52:19,119
are it and you go not so much
 

7537
01:52:19,119 --> 01:52:21,189
are it and you go not so much
we're not so intelligent um because we

7538
01:52:21,189 --> 01:52:21,199
we're not so intelligent um because we
 

7539
01:52:21,199 --> 01:52:23,350
we're not so intelligent um because we
are it's just how we learn so

7540
01:52:23,350 --> 01:52:23,360
are it's just how we learn so
 

7541
01:52:23,360 --> 01:52:25,750
are it's just how we learn so
you know our main mode of transportation

7542
01:52:25,750 --> 01:52:25,760
you know our main mode of transportation
 

7543
01:52:25,760 --> 01:52:27,430
you know our main mode of transportation
and what people figured out you know

7544
01:52:27,430 --> 01:52:27,440
and what people figured out you know
 

7545
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:29,189
and what people figured out you know
years ago was the internal combustion

7546
01:52:29,189 --> 01:52:29,199
years ago was the internal combustion
 

7547
01:52:29,199 --> 01:52:31,189
years ago was the internal combustion
engine which led us to jet engines and

7548
01:52:31,189 --> 01:52:31,199
engine which led us to jet engines and
 

7549
01:52:31,199 --> 01:52:33,430
engine which led us to jet engines and
solid rocket fuel what if you're in

7550
01:52:33,430 --> 01:52:33,440
solid rocket fuel what if you're in
 

7551
01:52:33,440 --> 01:52:35,430
solid rocket fuel what if you're in
another planet where you didn't you

7552
01:52:35,430 --> 01:52:35,440
another planet where you didn't you
 

7553
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:36,310
another planet where you didn't you
figured out

7554
01:52:36,310 --> 01:52:36,320
figured out
 

7555
01:52:36,320 --> 01:52:39,669
figured out
uh the ability to create a gravity field

7556
01:52:39,669 --> 01:52:39,679
uh the ability to create a gravity field
 

7557
01:52:39,679 --> 01:52:41,109
uh the ability to create a gravity field
or you used you know because

7558
01:52:41,109 --> 01:52:41,119
or you used you know because
 

7559
01:52:41,119 --> 01:52:42,550
or you used you know because
electromagnetics are becoming bigger and

7560
01:52:42,550 --> 01:52:42,560
electromagnetics are becoming bigger and
 

7561
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:43,990
electromagnetics are becoming bigger and
bigger and bigger you know catapults

7562
01:52:43,990 --> 01:52:44,000
bigger and bigger you know catapults
 

7563
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,149
bigger and bigger you know catapults
on ships were steam powered and the new

7564
01:52:46,149 --> 01:52:46,159
on ships were steam powered and the new
 

7565
01:52:46,159 --> 01:52:48,229
on ships were steam powered and the new
gerald ford is electromagnetic

7566
01:52:48,229 --> 01:52:48,239
gerald ford is electromagnetic
 

7567
01:52:48,239 --> 01:52:49,750
gerald ford is electromagnetic
roller coasters used to use a chain to

7568
01:52:49,750 --> 01:52:49,760
roller coasters used to use a chain to
 

7569
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:51,189
roller coasters used to use a chain to
get you to the top of the hill now they

7570
01:52:51,189 --> 01:52:51,199
get you to the top of the hill now they
 

7571
01:52:51,199 --> 01:52:52,550
get you to the top of the hill now they
shoot you with electromagnetics and

7572
01:52:52,550 --> 01:52:52,560
shoot you with electromagnetics and
 

7573
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:53,669
shoot you with electromagnetics and
you're going

7574
01:52:53,669 --> 01:52:53,679
you're going
 

7575
01:52:53,679 --> 01:52:55,189
you're going
so there's a whole new realm of

7576
01:52:55,189 --> 01:52:55,199
so there's a whole new realm of
 

7577
01:52:55,199 --> 01:52:57,270
so there's a whole new realm of
propulsion that you know sometimes it's

7578
01:52:57,270 --> 01:52:57,280
propulsion that you know sometimes it's
 

7579
01:52:57,280 --> 01:52:58,950
propulsion that you know sometimes it's
our ability to develop the technology to

7580
01:52:58,950 --> 01:52:58,960
our ability to develop the technology to
 

7581
01:52:58,960 --> 01:52:59,350
our ability to develop the technology to
support

7582
01:52:59,350 --> 01:52:59,360
support
 

7583
01:52:59,360 --> 01:53:02,470
support
theory you know we are just now proving

7584
01:53:02,470 --> 01:53:02,480
theory you know we are just now proving
 

7585
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:05,189
theory you know we are just now proving
you know recently theories that einstein

7586
01:53:05,189 --> 01:53:05,199
you know recently theories that einstein
 

7587
01:53:05,199 --> 01:53:06,790
you know recently theories that einstein
had where people actually joked about

7588
01:53:06,790 --> 01:53:06,800
had where people actually joked about
 

7589
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:07,830
had where people actually joked about
them and now we actually have the

7590
01:53:07,830 --> 01:53:07,840
them and now we actually have the
 

7591
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:09,350
them and now we actually have the
technology to prove that gravity can

7592
01:53:09,350 --> 01:53:09,360
technology to prove that gravity can
 

7593
01:53:09,360 --> 01:53:10,310
technology to prove that gravity can
bend light

7594
01:53:10,310 --> 01:53:10,320
bend light
 

7595
01:53:10,320 --> 01:53:12,709
bend light
you know we have proven that so you look

7596
01:53:12,709 --> 01:53:12,719
you know we have proven that so you look
 

7597
01:53:12,719 --> 01:53:14,229
you know we have proven that so you look
at that when you go well does that mean

7598
01:53:14,229 --> 01:53:14,239
at that when you go well does that mean
 

7599
01:53:14,239 --> 01:53:14,550
at that when you go well does that mean
that

7600
01:53:14,550 --> 01:53:14,560
that
 

7601
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:16,390
that
you know 70 years ago einstein was wrong

7602
01:53:16,390 --> 01:53:16,400
you know 70 years ago einstein was wrong
 

7603
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:17,910
you know 70 years ago einstein was wrong
or eight years ago einstein was wrong or

7604
01:53:17,910 --> 01:53:17,920
or eight years ago einstein was wrong or
 

7605
01:53:17,920 --> 01:53:18,629
or eight years ago einstein was wrong or
do you go

7606
01:53:18,629 --> 01:53:18,639
do you go
 

7607
01:53:18,639 --> 01:53:20,390
do you go
we just didn't have the ability to look

7608
01:53:20,390 --> 01:53:20,400
we just didn't have the ability to look
 

7609
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:22,229
we just didn't have the ability to look
that deep into space to actually find

7610
01:53:22,229 --> 01:53:22,239
that deep into space to actually find
 

7611
01:53:22,239 --> 01:53:23,510
that deep into space to actually find
something that we could

7612
01:53:23,510 --> 01:53:23,520
something that we could
 

7613
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:24,870
something that we could
to actually measure and you know and

7614
01:53:24,870 --> 01:53:24,880
to actually measure and you know and
 

7615
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:26,149
to actually measure and you know and
i've seen and that's just a hundred

7616
01:53:26,149 --> 01:53:26,159
i've seen and that's just a hundred
 

7617
01:53:26,159 --> 01:53:27,830
i've seen and that's just a hundred
years and and the kind of things that

7618
01:53:27,830 --> 01:53:27,840
years and and the kind of things that
 

7619
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:28,870
years and and the kind of things that
can happen if you say

7620
01:53:28,870 --> 01:53:28,880
can happen if you say
 

7621
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:29,910
can happen if you say

that right now
 

7847
01:56:47,679 --> 01:56:49,350
that right now
we typically don't like talking to the

7848
01:56:49,350 --> 01:56:49,360
we typically don't like talking to the
 

7849
01:56:49,360 --> 01:56:51,830
we typically don't like talking to the
press because if i talk to you

couple shows
 

7857
01:56:56,880 --> 01:56:58,070
couple shows
when you look at it you know they come

7858
01:56:58,070 --> 01:56:58,080
when you look at it you know they come
 

7859
01:56:58,080 --> 01:56:59,430
when you look at it you know they come
to my house and they film me for two

7860
01:56:59,430 --> 01:56:59,440
to my house and they film me for two
 

7861
01:56:59,440 --> 01:56:59,910
to my house and they film me for two
hours

7862
01:56:59,910 --> 01:56:59,920
hours
 

7863
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:01,990
hours
yeah and then what you see on the screen

7864
01:57:01,990 --> 01:57:02,000
yeah and then what you see on the screen
 

7865
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:03,270
yeah and then what you see on the screen
is five minutes

7866
01:57:03,270 --> 01:57:03,280
is five minutes
 

7867
01:57:03,280 --> 01:57:04,790
is five minutes
well and yeah and the other thing with

7868
01:57:04,790 --> 01:57:04,800
well and yeah and the other thing with
 

7869
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:06,310
well and yeah and the other thing with
the press let me give you my perspective

7870
01:57:06,310 --> 01:57:06,320
the press let me give you my perspective
 

7871
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:07,830
the press let me give you my perspective
from autonomous vehicles

7872
01:57:07,830 --> 01:57:07,840
from autonomous vehicles
 

7873
01:57:07,840 --> 01:57:10,870
from autonomous vehicles
is the clipping happens

7874
01:57:10,870 --> 01:57:10,880
is the clipping happens
 

7875
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:13,910
is the clipping happens
yes but also the incompetence

7876
01:57:13,910 --> 01:57:13,920
yes but also the incompetence
 

7877
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:17,589
yes but also the incompetence
let me just call out journals

7878
01:57:17,589 --> 01:57:17,599

 

7879
01:57:17,599 --> 01:57:21,189

they're not thinking i mean so so here's

7880
01:57:21,189 --> 01:57:21,199
they're not thinking i mean so so here's
 

7881
01:57:21,199 --> 01:57:21,830
they're not thinking i mean so so here's
the thing

7882
01:57:21,830 --> 01:57:21,840
the thing
 

7883
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:25,109
the thing
i've i have a phd and i've taken

7884
01:57:25,109 --> 01:57:25,119
i've i have a phd and i've taken
 

7885
01:57:25,119 --> 01:57:28,310
i've i have a phd and i've taken
painfully too many classes from like

7886
01:57:28,310 --> 01:57:28,320
painfully too many classes from like
 

7887
01:57:28,320 --> 01:57:30,950
painfully too many classes from like
physics and math and i also have a deep

7888
01:57:30,950 --> 01:57:30,960
physics and math and i also have a deep
 

7889
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:32,950
physics and math and i also have a deep
curiosity about the world

7890
01:57:32,950 --> 01:57:32,960
curiosity about the world
 

7891
01:57:32,960 --> 01:57:35,350
curiosity about the world
i read a lot that seems to be missing

7892
01:57:35,350 --> 01:57:35,360
i read a lot that seems to be missing
 

7893
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:36,790
i read a lot that seems to be missing
with journalism so you're talking to a

7894
01:57:36,790 --> 01:57:36,800
with journalism so you're talking to a
 

7895
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:38,070
with journalism so you're talking to a
person who's not gonna

7896
01:57:38,070 --> 01:57:38,080
person who's not gonna
 

7897
01:57:38,080 --> 01:57:40,709
person who's not gonna
push the story forward in an interesting

7898
01:57:40,709 --> 01:57:40,719
push the story forward in an interesting
 

7899
01:57:40,719 --> 01:57:42,390
push the story forward in an interesting
way not the story but the

7900
01:57:42,390 --> 01:57:42,400
way not the story but the
 

7901
01:57:42,400 --> 01:57:45,430
way not the story but the
actual investigation of uh

7902
01:57:45,430 --> 01:57:45,440
actual investigation of uh
 

7903
01:57:45,440 --> 01:57:47,589
actual investigation of uh
perhaps one of the most amazing things

7904
01:57:47,589 --> 01:57:47,599
perhaps one of the most amazing things
 

7905
01:57:47,599 --> 01:57:49,589
perhaps one of the most amazing things
that humans have witnessed in history

7906
01:57:49,589 --> 01:57:49,599
that humans have witnessed in history
 

7907
01:57:49,599 --> 01:57:52,149
that humans have witnessed in history
like you it might have been nothing who

7908
01:57:52,149 --> 01:57:52,159
like you it might have been nothing who
 

7909
01:57:52,159 --> 01:57:52,709
like you it might have been nothing who
knows

7910
01:57:52,709 --> 01:57:52,719
knows
 

7911
01:57:52,719 --> 01:57:54,950
knows
what you witnessed might have been from

7912
01:57:54,950 --> 01:57:54,960
what you witnessed might have been from
 

7913
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:56,790
what you witnessed might have been from
a sort of debunking perspective might

7914
01:57:56,790 --> 01:57:56,800
a sort of debunking perspective might
 

7915
01:57:56,800 --> 01:57:58,550
a sort of debunking perspective might
have been some kind of trick of mine

7916
01:57:58,550 --> 01:57:58,560
have been some kind of trick of mine
 

7917
01:57:58,560 --> 01:58:00,870
have been some kind of trick of mine
if you and others have hallucinated

7918
01:58:00,870 --> 01:58:00,880
if you and others have hallucinated
 

7919
01:58:00,880 --> 01:58:01,750
if you and others have hallucinated
something

7920
01:58:01,750 --> 01:58:01,760
something
 

7921
01:58:01,760 --> 01:58:05,030
something
it could be some simple explanation

7922
01:58:05,030 --> 01:58:05,040
it could be some simple explanation
 

7923
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:08,310
it could be some simple explanation
but possibly it was

7924
01:58:08,310 --> 01:58:08,320
but possibly it was
 

7925
01:58:08,320 --> 01:58:11,669
but possibly it was
uh something not of this world and

7926
01:58:11,669 --> 01:58:11,679
uh something not of this world and
 

7927
01:58:11,679 --> 01:58:15,109
uh something not of this world and
to not do justice to this story

7928
01:58:15,109 --> 01:58:15,119
to not do justice to this story
 

7929
01:58:15,119 --> 01:58:19,350
to not do justice to this story
from a scientific perspective it seems

7930
01:58:19,350 --> 01:58:19,360
from a scientific perspective it seems
 

7931
01:58:19,360 --> 01:58:21,910
from a scientific perspective it seems
at best negligence and so yeah that's

7932
01:58:21,910 --> 01:58:21,920
at best negligence and so yeah that's
 

7933
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:22,550
at best negligence and so yeah that's
true for

7934
01:58:22,550 --> 01:58:22,560
true for
 

7935
01:58:22,560 --> 01:58:25,270
true for
journalists it's true for others we it's

7936
01:58:25,270 --> 01:58:25,280
journalists it's true for others we it's
 

7937
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:25,669
journalists it's true for others we it's
just

7938
01:58:25,669 --> 01:58:25,679
just
 

7939
01:58:25,679 --> 01:58:28,229
just
it's human nature yeah if we if we can't

7940
01:58:28,229 --> 01:58:28,239
it's human nature yeah if we if we can't
 

7941
01:58:28,239 --> 01:58:29,669
it's human nature yeah if we if we can't
if we see something that we can't

7942
01:58:29,669 --> 01:58:29,679
if we see something that we can't
 

7943
01:58:29,679 --> 01:58:31,510
if we see something that we can't
explain

7944
01:58:31,510 --> 01:58:31,520
explain
 

7945
01:58:31,520 --> 01:58:33,990
explain
then sometimes if you just yeah maybe

7946
01:58:33,990 --> 01:58:34,000
then sometimes if you just yeah maybe
 

7947
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:35,669
then sometimes if you just yeah maybe
it's just me and you let it go away

7948
01:58:35,669 --> 01:58:35,679
it's just me and you let it go away
 

7949
01:58:35,679 --> 01:58:37,189
it's just me and you let it go away
and you don't think about it you know

7950
01:58:37,189 --> 01:58:37,199
and you don't think about it you know
 

7951
01:58:37,199 --> 01:58:39,270
and you don't think about it you know
maybe it'll just you know it's

7952
01:58:39,270 --> 01:58:39,280
maybe it'll just you know it's
 

7953
01:58:39,280 --> 01:58:42,390
maybe it'll just you know it's
it's you ignore it um the other side is

7954
01:58:42,390 --> 01:58:42,400
it's you ignore it um the other side is
 

7955
01:58:42,400 --> 01:58:44,070
it's you ignore it um the other side is
the inquisitive mind that says well what

7956
01:58:44,070 --> 01:58:44,080
the inquisitive mind that says well what
 

7957
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:45,750
the inquisitive mind that says well what
was that and i wanna i wanna dig more

7958
01:58:45,750 --> 01:58:45,760
was that and i wanna i wanna dig more
 

7959
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:46,790
was that and i wanna i wanna dig more
into it

7960
01:58:46,790 --> 01:58:46,800
into it
 

7961
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:49,030
into it
you know and if you you you look at it

7962
01:58:49,030 --> 01:58:49,040
you know and if you you you look at it
 

7963
01:58:49,040 --> 01:58:51,270
you know and if you you you look at it
or you're going against the norm

7964
01:58:51,270 --> 01:58:51,280
or you're going against the norm
 

7965
01:58:51,280 --> 01:58:53,910
or you're going against the norm
um you can get ostracized you know and

7966
01:58:53,910 --> 01:58:53,920
um you can get ostracized you know and
 

7967
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:54,950
um you can get ostracized you know and
if you look at you know

7968
01:58:54,950 --> 01:58:54,960
if you look at you know
 

7969
01:58:54,960 --> 01:58:56,790
if you look at you know
einstein's the perfect example i mean he

7970
01:58:56,790 --> 01:58:56,800
einstein's the perfect example i mean he
 

7971
01:58:56,800 --> 01:58:57,910
einstein's the perfect example i mean he
started coming up with some of his

7972
01:58:57,910 --> 01:58:57,920
started coming up with some of his
 

7973
01:58:57,920 --> 01:58:58,950
started coming up with some of his
theories

7974
01:58:58,950 --> 01:58:58,960
theories
 

7975
01:58:58,960 --> 01:59:00,470
theories
some of the top physicists in the world

7976
01:59:00,470 --> 01:59:00,480
some of the top physicists in the world
 

7977
01:59:00,480 --> 01:59:02,390
some of the top physicists in the world
were like dude you're

7978
01:59:02,390 --> 01:59:02,400
were like dude you're
 

7979
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:04,390
were like dude you're
you're a nut job and he's he's literally

7980
01:59:04,390 --> 01:59:04,400
you're a nut job and he's he's literally
 

7981
01:59:04,400 --> 01:59:05,750
you're a nut job and he's he's literally
proving them

7982
01:59:05,750 --> 01:59:05,760
proving them
 

7983
01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:07,510
proving them
but he didn't have you know he proved

7984
01:59:07,510 --> 01:59:07,520
but he didn't have you know he proved
 

7985
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:08,870
but he didn't have you know he proved
him in theory

7986
01:59:08,870 --> 01:59:08,880
him in theory
 

7987
01:59:08,880 --> 01:59:10,470
him in theory
but he didn't have the means to actually

7988
01:59:10,470 --> 01:59:10,480
but he didn't have the means to actually
 

7989
01:59:10,480 --> 01:59:12,629
but he didn't have the means to actually
do the experiment to prove

7990
01:59:12,629 --> 01:59:12,639
do the experiment to prove
 

7991
01:59:12,639 --> 01:59:14,709
do the experiment to prove
his theory there's a great book that i

7992
01:59:14,709 --> 01:59:14,719
his theory there's a great book that i
 

7993
01:59:14,719 --> 01:59:16,470
his theory there's a great book that i
recommend people read called proving

7994
01:59:16,470 --> 01:59:16,480
recommend people read called proving
 

7995
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:17,830
recommend people read called proving
einstein right

7996
01:59:17,830 --> 01:59:17,840
einstein right

the hard work that people try to do
 

8001

01:59:30,310 --> 01:59:30,320
the predictions that einstein made with
 

8007
01:59:30,320 --> 01:59:31,990
the predictions that einstein made with
uh with his theories

8008
01:59:31,990 --> 01:59:32,000
uh with his theories
 

8009
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,550
uh with his theories
it's fascinating but yes at the time

8010
01:59:34,550 --> 01:59:34,560
it's fascinating but yes at the time
 

8011
01:59:34,560 --> 01:59:35,510
it's fascinating but yes at the time
it's kind of crazy

8012
01:59:35,510 --> 01:59:35,520
it's kind of crazy
 

8013
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:37,910
it's kind of crazy
what he's saying yeah if you look at it

8014
01:59:37,910 --> 01:59:37,920
what he's saying yeah if you look at it
 

8015
01:59:37,920 --> 01:59:39,430
what he's saying yeah if you look at it
back at the time don't we we look at it

8016
01:59:39,430 --> 01:59:39,440
back at the time don't we we look at it
 

8017
01:59:39,440 --> 01:59:40,950
back at the time don't we we look at it
now and go well the guy was a walking

8018
01:59:40,950 --> 01:59:40,960
now and go well the guy was a walking
 

8019
01:59:40,960 --> 01:59:42,149
now and go well the guy was a walking
genius and he was

8020
01:59:42,149 --> 01:59:42,159
genius and he was
 

8021
01:59:42,159 --> 01:59:44,070
genius and he was
but if you go back in time when he was

8022
01:59:44,070 --> 01:59:44,080
but if you go back in time when he was
 

8023
01:59:44,080 --> 01:59:45,589
but if you go back in time when he was
doing it it was like what are you

8024
01:59:45,589 --> 01:59:45,599
doing it it was like what are you
 

8025
01:59:45,599 --> 01:59:47,109
doing it it was like what are you
talking about

8026
01:59:47,109 --> 01:59:47,119
talking about
 

8027
01:59:47,119 --> 01:59:50,390
talking about
you know but one of the challenges is

8028
01:59:50,390 --> 01:59:50,400
you know but one of the challenges is
 

8029
01:59:50,400 --> 01:59:53,189
you know but one of the challenges is
your eyewitness one of the challenges is

8030
01:59:53,189 --> 01:59:53,199
your eyewitness one of the challenges is
 

8031
01:59:53,199 --> 01:59:54,149
your eyewitness one of the challenges is
you're

8032
01:59:54,149 --> 01:59:54,159
you're
 

8033
01:59:54,159 --> 01:59:56,629
you're
essentially an eyewitness account like

8034
01:59:56,629 --> 01:59:56,639
essentially an eyewitness account like
 

8035
01:59:56,639 --> 01:59:58,550
essentially an eyewitness account like
we don't have good data

8036
01:59:58,550 --> 01:59:58,560
we don't have good data
 

8037
01:59:58,560 --> 02:00:01,910
we don't have good data
we have very limited data of um of the

8038
02:00:01,910 --> 02:00:01,920
we have very limited data of um of the
 

8039
02:00:01,920 --> 02:00:03,669
we have very limited data of um of the
incident that you've experienced

8040
02:00:03,669 --> 02:00:03,679
incident that you've experienced
 

8041
02:00:03,679 --> 02:00:05,990
incident that you've experienced
so let me kind of dig in let me just ask

8042
02:00:05,990 --> 02:00:06,000
so let me kind of dig in let me just ask
 

8043
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:07,270
so let me kind of dig in let me just ask
some questions

8044
02:00:07,270 --> 02:00:07,280
some questions
 

8045
02:00:07,280 --> 02:00:10,629
some questions
of uh maybe to see if there's

8046
02:00:10,629 --> 02:00:10,639
of uh maybe to see if there's
 

8047
02:00:10,639 --> 02:00:12,070
of uh maybe to see if there's
just to paint more and more of the

8048
02:00:12,070 --> 02:00:12,080
just to paint more and more of the
 

8049
02:00:12,080 --> 02:00:14,709
just to paint more and more of the
picture one you kind of mentioned so tic

8050
02:00:14,709 --> 02:00:14,719
picture one you kind of mentioned so tic
 

8051
02:00:14,719 --> 02:00:15,030
picture one you kind of mentioned so tic

one is the video

8056
02:00:19,669 --> 02:00:19,679
one is the video
 

8057
02:00:19,679 --> 02:00:21,830
one is the video
let's look at the actual eye account the

8058
02:00:21,830 --> 02:00:21,840
let's look at the actual eye account the
 

8059
02:00:21,840 --> 02:00:23,669
let's look at the actual eye account the
the eyewitness account that you saw with

8060
02:00:23,669 --> 02:00:23,679
the eyewitness account that you saw with
 

8061
02:00:23,679 --> 02:00:25,030
the eyewitness account that you saw with
your own eyes

your own eyes
 

8063
02:00:25,040 --> 02:00:27,189
your own eyes
what's the what can you say about the

8064
02:00:27,189 --> 02:00:27,199
what's the what can you say about the
 

8065
02:00:27,199 --> 02:00:29,030
what's the what can you say about the
shape of the thing is there interesting

8066
02:00:29,030 --> 02:00:29,040
shape of the thing is there interesting
 

8067
02:00:29,040 --> 02:00:30,870
shape of the thing is there interesting
aspects outside of the tic tac

8068
02:00:30,870 --> 02:00:30,880
aspects outside of the tic tac
 

8069
02:00:30,880 --> 02:00:34,470
aspects outside of the tic tac
like is there any appendages is there um

8070
02:00:34,470 --> 02:00:34,480
like is there any appendages is there um
 

8071
02:00:34,480 --> 02:00:38,149
like is there any appendages is there um
some texture to it that no

8072

8075
02:00:41,360 --> 02:00:43,430
smooth white tic tac
no we don't you don't see there's no no

no probes that we could see we don't

8082
02:00:50,870 --> 02:00:50,880
no probes that we could see we don't
 

8083
02:00:50,880 --> 02:00:52,229
no probes that we could see we don't
notice like i said we don't see the

8084
02:00:52,229 --> 02:00:52,239
notice like i said we don't see the
 

8085
02:00:52,239 --> 02:00:53,750
notice like i said we don't see the
little things on the bottom of it until

8086
02:00:53,750 --> 02:00:53,760
little things on the bottom of it until
 

8087
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:55,030
little things on the bottom of it until
we see the video

8088
02:00:55,030 --> 02:00:55,040
we see the video
 

8089
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:58,229
we see the video
in the tv mode when it's zoomed in

8090
02:00:58,229 --> 02:00:58,239
in the tv mode when it's zoomed in
 

8091
02:00:58,239 --> 02:00:59,910
in the tv mode when it's zoomed in
right before it's shortly you kind of

8092
02:00:59,910 --> 02:00:59,920
right before it's shortly you kind of
 

8093
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:01,189
right before it's shortly you kind of
see them zoom in you don't see it

8094
02:01:01,189 --> 02:01:01,199
see them zoom in you don't see it
 

8095
02:01:01,199 --> 02:01:02,950
see them zoom in you don't see it
typically on the youtube stuff that's

8096
02:01:02,950 --> 02:01:02,960
typically on the youtube stuff that's
 

8097
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:03,990
typically on the youtube stuff that's
out there

8098
02:01:03,990 --> 02:01:04,000
out there
 

8099
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,229
out there
um but remember we're looking at the

8100
02:01:06,229 --> 02:01:06,239
um but remember we're looking at the
 

8101
02:01:06,239 --> 02:01:08,310
um but remember we're looking at the
original tape so there's not there's

8102
02:01:08,310 --> 02:01:08,320
original tape so there's not there's
 

8103

02:03:23,910 --> 02:03:23,920
coming up and it ends up getting up to
 

8245

me from a standstill let's just say slow

8322
02:04:31,910 --> 02:04:31,920
me from a standstill let's just say slow
 

8323
02:04:31,920 --> 02:04:34,390
me from a standstill let's just say slow
flight just get me at 100 knots

8324
02:04:34,390 --> 02:04:34,400
flight just get me at 100 knots
 

8325
02:04:34,400 --> 02:04:36,629
flight just get me at 100 knots
above the water and for me to you can't

8326
02:04:36,629 --> 02:04:36,639
above the water and for me to you can't
 

8327
02:04:36,639 --> 02:04:38,229
above the water and for me to you can't
just start a climb i'd have to lower the

8328
02:04:38,229 --> 02:04:38,239
just start a climb i'd have to lower the
 

8329
02:04:38,239 --> 02:04:39,750
just start a climb i'd have to lower the
nose i'd have to accelerate and then i'd

8330
02:04:39,750 --> 02:04:39,760
nose i'd have to accelerate and then i'd
 

8331
02:04:39,760 --> 02:04:42,709
nose i'd have to accelerate and then i'd
have to start coming up and

8332
02:04:42,709 --> 02:04:42,719
have to start coming up and
 

8333
02:04:42,719 --> 02:04:44,310
have to start coming up and
this thing just like just did it like it

8334
02:04:44,310 --> 02:04:44,320
this thing just like just did it like it
 

8335
02:04:44,320 --> 02:04:45,910
this thing just like just did it like it
was like no big deal yeah you mentioned

8336
02:04:45,910 --> 02:04:45,920
was like no big deal yeah you mentioned
 

8337
02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:46,629
was like no big deal yeah you mentioned
that

8338
02:04:46,629 --> 02:04:46,639
that
 

8339
02:04:46,639 --> 02:04:48,550
that
like you kind of your reaction to it was

8340
02:04:48,550 --> 02:04:48,560
like you kind of your reaction to it was
 

8341
02:04:48,560 --> 02:04:50,870
like you kind of your reaction to it was
uh it

8342
02:04:50,870 --> 02:04:50,880
uh it
 

8343
02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:52,629
uh it
like it's something that you would love

8344
02:04:52,629 --> 02:04:52,639
like it's something that you would love
 

8345
02:04:52,639 --> 02:04:54,069
like it's something that you would love
to fly almost

8346
02:04:54,069 --> 02:04:54,079
to fly almost
 

8347
02:04:54,079 --> 02:04:56,870
to fly almost
uh so this object just the curiosity you

8348
02:04:56,870 --> 02:04:56,880
uh so this object just the curiosity you
 

8349
02:04:56,880 --> 02:04:59,350
uh so this object just the curiosity you
experience is like

8350
02:04:59,350 --> 02:04:59,360
experience is like
 

8351
02:04:59,360 --> 02:05:02,149
experience is like
like what it almost like what the heck

8352
02:05:02,149 --> 02:05:02,159
like what it almost like what the heck
 

8353
02:05:02,159 --> 02:05:03,910
like what it almost like what the heck
is that piece of technology and i want

8354
02:05:03,910 --> 02:05:03,920
is that piece of technology and i want
 

8355
02:05:03,920 --> 02:05:04,870
is that piece of technology and i want
to fly it

8356
02:05:04,870 --> 02:05:04,880
to fly it
 

8357
02:05:04,880 --> 02:05:08,310
to fly it
like what made you feel

8358
02:05:08,310 --> 02:05:08,320
like what made you feel
 

8359
02:05:08,320 --> 02:05:10,709
like what made you feel
like it's something that you could fly

8360
02:05:10,709 --> 02:05:10,719
like it's something that you could fly
 

8361
02:05:10,719 --> 02:05:12,229
like it's something that you could fly
do you think it's something that a human

8362
02:05:12,229 --> 02:05:12,239
do you think it's something that a human
 

8363
02:05:12,239 --> 02:05:13,510
do you think it's something that a human
could fly

8364
02:05:13,510 --> 02:05:13,520
could fly
 

8365
02:05:13,520 --> 02:05:15,589
could fly
like in terms of interpreting what you

8366
02:05:15,589 --> 02:05:15,599
like in terms of interpreting what you
 

8367
02:05:15,599 --> 02:05:17,510
like in terms of interpreting what you
saw as a piece of technology

8368
02:05:17,510 --> 02:05:17,520
saw as a piece of technology
 

8369
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:19,669
saw as a piece of technology
because another perspective on it is it

8370
02:05:19,669 --> 02:05:19,679
because another perspective on it is it
 

8371
02:05:19,679 --> 02:05:20,709
because another perspective on it is it
was

8372
02:05:20,709 --> 02:05:20,719
was
 

8373
02:05:20,719 --> 02:05:24,550
was
uh not that the thing under the water

8374
02:05:24,550 --> 02:05:24,560
uh not that the thing under the water
 

8375
02:05:24,560 --> 02:05:27,990
uh not that the thing under the water
was the key thing and what you were

8376
02:05:27,990 --> 02:05:28,000
was the key thing and what you were
 

8377
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:28,470
was the key thing and what you were
seeing

8378
02:05:28,470 --> 02:05:28,480
seeing
 

8379
02:05:28,480 --> 02:05:31,109
seeing
is some kind of projection or something

8380
02:05:31,109 --> 02:05:31,119
is some kind of projection or something
 

8381
02:05:31,119 --> 02:05:31,750
is some kind of projection or something
that like

8382
02:05:31,750 --> 02:05:31,760
that like
 

8383
02:05:31,760 --> 02:05:32,870
that like
i don't think it was a projection i

8384
02:05:32,870 --> 02:05:32,880
i don't think it was a projection i
 

8385
02:05:32,880 --> 02:05:34,550
i don't think it was a projection i
think it was a real object it was an a

8386
02:05:34,550 --> 02:05:34,560
think it was a real object it was an a
 

8387
02:05:34,560 --> 02:05:35,910
think it was a real object it was an a
physical hard object

8388
02:05:35,910 --> 02:05:35,920
physical hard object
 

8389
02:05:35,920 --> 02:05:39,189
physical hard object
that would could be flied oh yeah yeah i

8390
02:05:39,189 --> 02:05:39,199
that would could be flied oh yeah yeah i
 

8391
02:05:39,199 --> 02:05:39,589
that would could be flied oh yeah yeah i
think

8392
02:05:39,589 --> 02:05:39,599
think
 

8393
02:05:39,599 --> 02:05:40,790
think
all four of us will say the same thing

8394
02:05:40,790 --> 02:05:40,800
all four of us will say the same thing
 

8395
02:05:40,800 --> 02:05:42,390
all four of us will say the same thing
it wasn't it wasn't this was not because

8396
02:05:42,390 --> 02:05:42,400
it wasn't it wasn't this was not because
 

8397
02:05:42,400 --> 02:05:43,189
it wasn't it wasn't this was not because
you go

8398
02:05:43,189 --> 02:05:43,199
you go
 

8399
02:05:43,199 --> 02:05:45,270
you go
okay let's just go on it's a light

8400
02:05:45,270 --> 02:05:45,280
okay let's just go on it's a light
 

8401
02:05:45,280 --> 02:05:46,709
okay let's just go on it's a light
projection

8402
02:05:46,709 --> 02:05:46,719
projection
 

8403
02:05:46,719 --> 02:05:48,310
projection
well if we were both sitting next to

8404
02:05:48,310 --> 02:05:48,320
well if we were both sitting next to
 

8405
02:05:48,320 --> 02:05:49,589
well if we were both sitting next to
each other we were looking at it from

8406
02:05:49,589 --> 02:05:49,599
each other we were looking at it from
 

8407
02:05:49,599 --> 02:05:51,430
each other we were looking at it from
the exact same angle and all that and i

8408
02:05:51,430 --> 02:05:51,440
the exact same angle and all that and i
 

8409
02:05:51,440 --> 02:05:52,870
the exact same angle and all that and i
go oh okay there's a

8410
02:05:52,870 --> 02:05:52,880
go oh okay there's a
 

8411
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:54,550
go oh okay there's a
in theory you could have that but with

8412
02:05:54,550 --> 02:05:54,560
in theory you could have that but with
 

8413
02:05:54,560 --> 02:05:56,790
in theory you could have that but with
an 8 000 foot altitude difference flying

8414
02:05:56,790 --> 02:05:56,800
an 8 000 foot altitude difference flying
 

8415
02:05:56,800 --> 02:05:58,229
an 8 000 foot altitude difference flying
you know and they're you know she's

8416
02:05:58,229 --> 02:05:58,239
you know and they're you know she's
 

8417
02:05:58,239 --> 02:05:59,830
you know and they're you know she's
probably not directly above me she's

8418
02:05:59,830 --> 02:05:59,840
probably not directly above me she's
 

8419
02:05:59,840 --> 02:06:01,270
probably not directly above me she's
kind of hanging out watching this whole

8420
02:06:01,270 --> 02:06:01,280
kind of hanging out watching this whole
 

8421
02:06:01,280 --> 02:06:02,550
kind of hanging out watching this whole
thing happen

8422
02:06:02,550 --> 02:06:02,560
thing happen
 

8423
02:06:02,560 --> 02:06:03,750
thing happen
you know you're getting two different

8424
02:06:03,750 --> 02:06:03,760
you know you're getting two different
 

8425
02:06:03,760 --> 02:06:05,109
you know you're getting two different
perspectives from two different

8426
02:06:05,109 --> 02:06:05,119
perspectives from two different
 

8427
02:06:05,119 --> 02:06:07,030
perspectives from two different
altitudes over a clear blue

8428
02:06:07,030 --> 02:06:07,040
altitudes over a clear blue
 

8429
02:06:07,040 --> 02:06:08,550
altitudes over a clear blue
you know if you've ever been at sea and

8430
02:06:08,550 --> 02:06:08,560
you know if you've ever been at sea and
 

8431
02:06:08,560 --> 02:06:10,310
you know if you've ever been at sea and
i don't mean like coastal i mean like

8432
02:06:10,310 --> 02:06:10,320
i don't mean like coastal i mean like
 

8433
02:06:10,320 --> 02:06:11,990
i don't mean like coastal i mean like
when you get out at sea the ocean is the

8434
02:06:11,990 --> 02:06:12,000
when you get out at sea the ocean is the
 

8435
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,069
when you get out at sea the ocean is the
bluest it's incredible

8436
02:06:14,069 --> 02:06:14,079
bluest it's incredible
 

8437
02:06:14,079 --> 02:06:16,709
bluest it's incredible
um you know you got a bright white

8438
02:06:16,709 --> 02:06:16,719
um you know you got a bright white
 

8439
02:06:16,719 --> 02:06:17,189
um you know you got a bright white
object

8440
02:06:17,189 --> 02:06:17,199
object
 

8441
02:06:17,199 --> 02:06:19,189
object
over a deep blue ocean you got pretty

8442
02:06:19,189 --> 02:06:19,199
over a deep blue ocean you got pretty
 

8443
02:06:19,199 --> 02:06:20,550
over a deep blue ocean you got pretty
high contrast

8444
02:06:20,550 --> 02:06:20,560
high contrast
 

8445
02:06:20,560 --> 02:06:23,830
high contrast
and for this thing just to disappear uh

8446
02:06:23,830 --> 02:06:23,840
and for this thing just to disappear uh
 

8447
02:06:23,840 --> 02:06:26,870
and for this thing just to disappear uh
it's it's was i'm telling you i would

8448
02:06:26,870 --> 02:06:26,880
it's it's was i'm telling you i would
 

8449
02:06:26,880 --> 02:06:31,270
it's it's was i'm telling you i would
i mean i know we we all have the same

8450
02:06:31,270 --> 02:06:31,280
i mean i know we we all have the same
 

8451
02:06:31,280 --> 02:06:33,109
i mean i know we we all have the same
uh recollection of what happened you

8452
02:06:33,109 --> 02:06:33,119
uh recollection of what happened you
 

8453
02:06:33,119 --> 02:06:34,390
uh recollection of what happened you
know there's some details because it's

8454
02:06:34,390 --> 02:06:34,400
know there's some details because it's
 

8455
02:06:34,400 --> 02:06:35,510
know there's some details because it's
so long ago but

8456
02:06:35,510 --> 02:06:35,520
so long ago but
 

8457
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:37,189
so long ago but
for the most part we know what we saw

8458
02:06:37,189 --> 02:06:37,199
for the most part we know what we saw
 

8459
02:06:37,199 --> 02:06:38,629
for the most part we know what we saw
and we all came back and looked at each

8460
02:06:38,629 --> 02:06:38,639
and we all came back and looked at each
 

8461
02:06:38,639 --> 02:06:40,310
and we all came back and looked at each
other like what the hell was that

8462
02:06:40,310 --> 02:06:40,320
other like what the hell was that
 

8463
02:06:40,320 --> 02:06:42,550
other like what the hell was that
what if i mean do you think about the

8464
02:06:42,550 --> 02:06:42,560
what if i mean do you think about the
 

8465
02:06:42,560 --> 02:06:44,390
what if i mean do you think about the
thing under the water that's not often

8466
02:06:44,390 --> 02:06:44,400
thing under the water that's not often
 

8467
02:06:44,400 --> 02:06:45,030
thing under the water that's not often
talked about

8468
02:06:45,030 --> 02:06:45,040
talked about
 

8469
02:06:45,040 --> 02:06:47,109
talked about
if there's something under the water

8470
02:06:47,109 --> 02:06:47,119
if there's something under the water
 

8471
02:06:47,119 --> 02:06:49,990
if there's something under the water
couldn't have been something gigantic

8472
02:06:49,990 --> 02:06:50,000
couldn't have been something gigantic
 

8473
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:51,910
couldn't have been something gigantic
like it could be what like do you ever

8474
02:06:51,910 --> 02:06:51,920
like it could be what like do you ever
 

8475
02:06:51,920 --> 02:06:53,669
like it could be what like do you ever
see this

8476
02:06:53,669 --> 02:06:53,679
see this
 

8477
02:06:53,679 --> 02:06:55,430
see this
big ship that's why as a person so i

8478
02:06:55,430 --> 02:06:55,440
big ship that's why as a person so i
 

8479
02:06:55,440 --> 02:06:57,510
big ship that's why as a person so i
love like swimming out into the ocean my

8480
02:06:57,510 --> 02:06:57,520
love like swimming out into the ocean my
 

8481
02:06:57,520 --> 02:06:58,069
love like swimming out into the ocean my
mom's an

8482
02:06:58,069 --> 02:06:58,079
mom's an
 

8483
02:06:58,079 --> 02:07:00,390
mom's an
olympic swimmer so like i love that

8484
02:07:00,390 --> 02:07:00,400
olympic swimmer so like i love that
 

8485
02:07:00,400 --> 02:07:01,910
olympic swimmer so like i love that
feeling but i'm also terrified when i

8486
02:07:01,910 --> 02:07:01,920
feeling but i'm also terrified when i
 

8487
02:07:01,920 --> 02:07:02,390
feeling but i'm also terrified when i
swim

8488
02:07:02,390 --> 02:07:02,400
swim
 

8489
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:04,310
swim
because the abyss anything could be

8490
02:07:04,310 --> 02:07:04,320
because the abyss anything could be
 

8491
02:07:04,320 --> 02:07:05,830
because the abyss anything could be
under there i

8492
02:07:05,830 --> 02:07:05,840
under there i
 

8493
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:09,430
under there i
like there's not enough focus on that

8494
02:07:09,430 --> 02:07:09,440
like there's not enough focus on that
 

8495
02:07:09,440 --> 02:07:11,189
like there's not enough focus on that
perhaps because there's no visibility

8496
02:07:11,189 --> 02:07:11,199
perhaps because there's no visibility
 

8497
02:07:11,199 --> 02:07:12,550
perhaps because there's no visibility
but is it

8498
02:07:12,550 --> 02:07:12,560
but is it
 

8499
02:07:12,560 --> 02:07:14,069
but is it
is there anything interesting to say

8500
02:07:14,069 --> 02:07:14,079
is there anything interesting to say
 

8501
02:07:14,079 --> 02:07:15,589
is there anything interesting to say
about the possibility there was

8502
02:07:15,589 --> 02:07:15,599
about the possibility there was
 

8503
02:07:15,599 --> 02:07:17,109
about the possibility there was
anything underneath there it could be i

8504
02:07:17,109 --> 02:07:17,119
anything underneath there it could be i
 

8505
02:07:17,119 --> 02:07:19,189
anything underneath there it could be i
mean think about if you're going to hide

8506
02:07:19,189 --> 02:07:19,199
mean think about if you're going to hide
 

8507
02:07:19,199 --> 02:07:22,229
mean think about if you're going to hide
on this planet where's

8508
02:07:22,229 --> 02:07:22,239
on this planet where's
 

8509
02:07:22,239 --> 02:07:24,950
on this planet where's
what's the least explored spot on the

8510
02:07:24,950 --> 02:07:24,960
what's the least explored spot on the
 

8511
02:07:24,960 --> 02:07:27,589
what's the least explored spot on the
planet two-thirds of it's the ocean

8512
02:07:27,589 --> 02:07:27,599
planet two-thirds of it's the ocean
 

8513
02:07:27,599 --> 02:07:30,470
planet two-thirds of it's the ocean
you there's there's there's literally i

8514
02:07:30,470 --> 02:07:30,480
you there's there's there's literally i
 

8515
02:07:30,480 --> 02:07:31,270
you there's there's there's literally i
mean come on

8516
02:07:31,270 --> 02:07:31,280
mean come on
 

8517
02:07:31,280 --> 02:07:33,750
mean come on
the the the malaysia airplane the the

8518
02:07:33,750 --> 02:07:33,760
the the the malaysia airplane the the
 

8519
02:07:33,760 --> 02:07:35,189
the the the malaysia airplane the the
triple seven it was a triple seven that

8520
02:07:35,189 --> 02:07:35,199
triple seven it was a triple seven that
 

8521
02:07:35,199 --> 02:07:36,709
triple seven it was a triple seven that
crashed you know they turned they didn't

8522
02:07:36,709 --> 02:07:36,719
crashed you know they turned they didn't
 

8523
02:07:36,719 --> 02:07:37,830
crashed you know they turned they didn't
go where they're supposed to and they

8524
02:07:37,830 --> 02:07:37,840
go where they're supposed to and they
 

8525
02:07:37,840 --> 02:07:39,109
go where they're supposed to and they
just disappeared and they've been

8526
02:07:39,109 --> 02:07:39,119
just disappeared and they've been
 

8527
02:07:39,119 --> 02:07:40,629
just disappeared and they've been
searching for it and they found pieces

8528
02:07:40,629 --> 02:07:40,639
searching for it and they found pieces
 

8529
02:07:40,639 --> 02:07:41,510
searching for it and they found pieces
of it

8530
02:07:41,510 --> 02:07:41,520
of it
 

8531
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:42,709
of it
but you would think there's large

8532
02:07:42,709 --> 02:07:42,719
but you would think there's large
 

8533
02:07:42,719 --> 02:07:44,310
but you would think there's large
objects that you know when that thing

8534
02:07:44,310 --> 02:07:44,320
objects that you know when that thing
 

8535
02:07:44,320 --> 02:07:45,350
objects that you know when that thing
hit the water

8536
02:07:45,350 --> 02:07:45,360
hit the water
 

8537
02:07:45,360 --> 02:07:46,870
hit the water
depending on how it broke up there's big

8538
02:07:46,870 --> 02:07:46,880
depending on how it broke up there's big
 

8539
02:07:46,880 --> 02:07:48,229
depending on how it broke up there's big
pieces that would you'd find something

8540
02:07:48,229 --> 02:07:48,239
pieces that would you'd find something
 

8541
02:07:48,239 --> 02:07:49,589
pieces that would you'd find something
they haven't found anything except what

8542
02:07:49,589 --> 02:07:49,599
they haven't found anything except what
 

8543
02:07:49,599 --> 02:07:50,629
they haven't found anything except what
floated

8544
02:07:50,629 --> 02:07:50,639
floated
 

8545
02:07:50,639 --> 02:07:52,790
floated
um so to hide something underwater i

8546
02:07:52,790 --> 02:07:52,800
um so to hide something underwater i
 

8547
02:07:52,800 --> 02:07:54,550
um so to hide something underwater i
think would be easy

8548
02:07:54,550 --> 02:07:54,560
think would be easy
 

8549
02:07:54,560 --> 02:07:56,310
think would be easy
so okay let's go a little bit in

8550
02:07:56,310 --> 02:07:56,320
so okay let's go a little bit in
 

8551
02:07:56,320 --> 02:07:57,990
so okay let's go a little bit in
speculation land but

8552
02:07:57,990 --> 02:07:58,000
speculation land but
 

8553
02:07:58,000 --> 02:07:59,830
speculation land but
it's the best it's the best we can do

8554
02:07:59,830 --> 02:07:59,840
it's the best it's the best we can do
 

8555
02:07:59,840 --> 02:08:01,270
it's the best it's the best we can do
which is

8556
02:08:01,270 --> 02:08:01,280
which is
 

8557
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:04,310
which is
the basic question of what do you think

8558
02:08:04,310 --> 02:08:04,320
the basic question of what do you think
 

8559
02:08:04,320 --> 02:08:07,750
the basic question of what do you think
was it so if you had to put money on it

8560
02:08:07,750 --> 02:08:07,760
was it so if you had to put money on it
 

8561
02:08:07,760 --> 02:08:10,950
was it so if you had to put money on it
is it uh like advanced human created

8562
02:08:10,950 --> 02:08:10,960
is it uh like advanced human created
 

8563
02:08:10,960 --> 02:08:11,669
is it uh like advanced human created
technology

8564
02:08:11,669 --> 02:08:11,679
technology
 

8565
02:08:11,679 --> 02:08:14,950
technology
is it alien technology is it an unknown

8566
02:08:14,950 --> 02:08:14,960
is it alien technology is it an unknown
 

8567
02:08:14,960 --> 02:08:16,629
is it alien technology is it an unknown
physical phenomena

8568
02:08:16,629 --> 02:08:16,639
physical phenomena
 

8569
02:08:16,639 --> 02:08:18,069
physical phenomena
you know like a ball lightning for

8570
02:08:18,069 --> 02:08:18,079
you know like a ball lightning for
 

8571
02:08:18,079 --> 02:08:19,750
you know like a ball lightning for
example there's a lot of fascinating

8572
02:08:19,750 --> 02:08:19,760
example there's a lot of fascinating
 

8573
02:08:19,760 --> 02:08:20,310
example there's a lot of fascinating
things that

8574
02:08:20,310 --> 02:08:20,320
things that
 

8575
02:08:20,320 --> 02:08:23,669
things that
humans don't really understand is it uh

8576
02:08:23,669 --> 02:08:23,679
humans don't really understand is it uh
 

8577
02:08:23,679 --> 02:08:25,990
humans don't really understand is it uh
like i said some perception cognition

8578
02:08:25,990 --> 02:08:26,000
like i said some perception cognition
 

8579
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:26,790
like i said some perception cognition
that led you

8580
02:08:26,790 --> 02:08:26,800
that led you
 

8581
02:08:26,800 --> 02:08:29,109
that led you
uh some kind of hallucination that made

8582
02:08:29,109 --> 02:08:29,119
uh some kind of hallucination that made
 

8583
02:08:29,119 --> 02:08:30,790
uh some kind of hallucination that made
you to misinterpret the things you were

8584
02:08:30,790 --> 02:08:30,800
you to misinterpret the things you were
 

8585
02:08:30,800 --> 02:08:31,430
you to misinterpret the things you were
seeing

8586
02:08:31,430 --> 02:08:31,440
seeing
 

8587
02:08:31,440 --> 02:08:33,589
seeing
let me put those things on the table or

8588
02:08:33,589 --> 02:08:33,599
let me put those things on the table or
 

8589
02:08:33,599 --> 02:08:36,310
let me put those things on the table or
is it misinterpretation of some known

8590
02:08:36,310 --> 02:08:36,320
is it misinterpretation of some known
 

8591
02:08:36,320 --> 02:08:38,550
is it misinterpretation of some known
physical phenomena like uh like an ice

8592
02:08:38,550 --> 02:08:38,560
physical phenomena like uh like an ice
 

8593
02:08:38,560 --> 02:08:40,069
physical phenomena like uh like an ice
cloud or something like that

8594
02:08:40,069 --> 02:08:40,079
cloud or something like that
 

8595
02:08:40,079 --> 02:08:41,350
cloud or something like that
what do you think it was well it's

8596
02:08:41,350 --> 02:08:41,360
what do you think it was well it's
 

8597
02:08:41,360 --> 02:08:42,550
what do you think it was well it's
definitely i don't think it's an ice

8598
02:08:42,550 --> 02:08:42,560
definitely i don't think it's an ice
 

8599
02:08:42,560 --> 02:08:43,910
definitely i don't think it's an ice
cloud because ice clouds don't fly

8600
02:08:43,910 --> 02:08:43,920
cloud because ice clouds don't fly
 

8601
02:08:43,920 --> 02:08:44,709
cloud because ice clouds don't fly
around

8602
02:08:44,709 --> 02:08:44,719
around
 

8603
02:08:44,719 --> 02:08:48,390
around
yep and react to you do i think it was a

8604
02:08:48,390 --> 02:08:48,400
yep and react to you do i think it was a
 

8605
02:08:48,400 --> 02:08:48,790
yep and react to you do i think it was a
light

8606
02:08:48,790 --> 02:08:48,800
light
 

8607
02:08:48,800 --> 02:08:50,629
light
i'd say no because of the aspects and

8608
02:08:50,629 --> 02:08:50,639
i'd say no because of the aspects and
 

8609
02:08:50,639 --> 02:08:52,069
i'd say no because of the aspects and
what we looked and watched it do

8610
02:08:52,069 --> 02:08:52,079
what we looked and watched it do
 

8611
02:08:52,079 --> 02:08:54,550
what we looked and watched it do
i'd say no what do you mean by light

8612
02:08:54,550 --> 02:08:54,560
i'd say no what do you mean by light
 

8613
02:08:54,560 --> 02:08:55,589
i'd say no what do you mean by light
like a light ball

8614
02:08:55,589 --> 02:08:55,599
like a light ball
 

8615
02:08:55,599 --> 02:08:57,270
like a light ball
you know some type of perception you

8616
02:08:57,270 --> 02:08:57,280
you know some type of perception you
 

8617
02:08:57,280 --> 02:08:59,109
you know some type of perception you
know there's uh

8618
02:08:59,109 --> 02:08:59,119
know there's uh
 

8619
02:08:59,119 --> 02:09:01,510
know there's uh
their experience like plasma you can do

8620
02:09:01,510 --> 02:09:01,520
their experience like plasma you can do
 

8621
02:09:01,520 --> 02:09:02,550
their experience like plasma you can do
plasma and you go

8622
02:09:02,550 --> 02:09:02,560
plasma and you go
 

8623
02:09:02,560 --> 02:09:03,910
plasma and you go
i can see it but it's really not you

8624
02:09:03,910 --> 02:09:03,920
i can see it but it's really not you
 

8625
02:09:03,920 --> 02:09:06,310
i can see it but it's really not you
know it's plasma i don't think so

8626
02:09:06,310 --> 02:09:06,320
know it's plasma i don't think so
 

8627
02:09:06,320 --> 02:09:08,709
know it's plasma i don't think so
um so you would see distortions i think

8628
02:09:08,709 --> 02:09:08,719
um so you would see distortions i think
 

8629
02:09:08,719 --> 02:09:09,430
um so you would see distortions i think
is it moved

8630
02:09:09,430 --> 02:09:09,440
is it moved
 

8631
02:09:09,440 --> 02:09:11,430
is it moved
maybe not i mean i'm not the theoretical

8632
02:09:11,430 --> 02:09:11,440
maybe not i mean i'm not the theoretical
 

8633
02:09:11,440 --> 02:09:12,870
maybe not i mean i'm not the theoretical
physicist in some

8634
02:09:12,870 --> 02:09:12,880
physicist in some
 

8635
02:09:12,880 --> 02:09:16,229
physicist in some
you know you know i'm not in mit uh

8636
02:09:16,229 --> 02:09:16,239
you know you know i'm not in mit uh
 

8637
02:09:16,239 --> 02:09:18,950
you know you know i'm not in mit uh
i would say no i mean it looked for from

8638
02:09:18,950 --> 02:09:18,960
i would say no i mean it looked for from
 

8639

three four times a week
 

8697
02:10:04,639 --> 02:10:06,870
three four times a week
um but you know you see wrestlers when

8698
02:10:06,870 --> 02:10:06,880
um but you know you see wrestlers when
 

8699
02:10:06,880 --> 02:10:08,149
um but you know you see wrestlers when
they get out they kind of you're kind of

8700
02:10:08,149 --> 02:10:08,159
they get out they kind of you're kind of
 

8701
02:10:08,159 --> 02:10:09,189
they get out they kind of you're kind of
feeling each other as you walk

8702
02:10:09,189 --> 02:10:09,199
feeling each other as you walk
 

8703
02:10:09,199 --> 02:10:11,030
feeling each other as you walk
boxers do the same thing it was doing

8704
02:10:11,030 --> 02:10:11,040
boxers do the same thing it was doing
 

8705
02:10:11,040 --> 02:10:12,390
boxers do the same thing it was doing
that same thing it's like what's going

8706
02:10:12,390 --> 02:10:12,400
that same thing it's like what's going
 

8707
02:10:12,400 --> 02:10:13,990
that same thing it's like what's going
on as it comes around as it comes around

8708
02:10:13,990 --> 02:10:14,000
on as it comes around as it comes around
 

8709
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:15,750
on as it comes around as it comes around
and then it was like hey we're going to

8710
02:10:15,750 --> 02:10:15,760
and then it was like hey we're going to
 

8711
02:10:15,760 --> 02:10:18,390
and then it was like hey we're going to
get here and when i got too close to it

8712
02:10:18,390 --> 02:10:18,400
get here and when i got too close to it
 

8713
02:10:18,400 --> 02:10:19,830
get here and when i got too close to it
you know it decided i'm out of here and

8714
02:10:19,830 --> 02:10:19,840
you know it decided i'm out of here and
 

8715
02:10:19,840 --> 02:10:21,510
you know it decided i'm out of here and
then it did something that we've never

8716
02:10:21,510 --> 02:10:21,520
then it did something that we've never
 

8717
02:10:21,520 --> 02:10:21,990
then it did something that we've never
seen

8718
02:10:21,990 --> 02:10:22,000
seen
 

8719
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:23,589
seen
the other question is what if i didn't

8720
02:10:23,589 --> 02:10:23,599
the other question is what if i didn't
 

8721
02:10:23,599 --> 02:10:24,790
the other question is what if i didn't
cut across the circle what if i just

8722
02:10:24,790 --> 02:10:24,800
cut across the circle what if i just
 

8723
02:10:24,800 --> 02:10:25,990
cut across the circle what if i just
kept going around a circle

8724
02:10:25,990 --> 02:10:26,000
kept going around a circle
 

8725
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:27,589
kept going around a circle
we just keep going but i could have just

8726
02:10:27,589 --> 02:10:27,599
we just keep going but i could have just
 

8727
02:10:27,599 --> 02:10:29,109
we just keep going but i could have just
watched it i mean my one regret out of

8728
02:10:29,109 --> 02:10:29,119
watched it i mean my one regret out of
 

8729
02:10:29,119 --> 02:10:30,550
watched it i mean my one regret out of
the whole thing is

8730
02:10:30,550 --> 02:10:30,560
the whole thing is
 

8731
02:10:30,560 --> 02:10:32,390
the whole thing is
uh we have a camera in our helmet in the

8732
02:10:32,390 --> 02:10:32,400
uh we have a camera in our helmet in the
 

8733
02:10:32,400 --> 02:10:33,750
uh we have a camera in our helmet in the
joint helmet there's a little camera but

8734
02:10:33,750 --> 02:10:33,760
joint helmet there's a little camera but
 

8735
02:10:33,760 --> 02:10:35,430
joint helmet there's a little camera but
we never use it because it's nauseating

8736
02:10:35,430 --> 02:10:35,440
we never use it because it's nauseating
 

8737
02:10:35,440 --> 02:10:36,870
we never use it because it's nauseating
to watch because you've ever put a gopro

8738
02:10:36,870 --> 02:10:36,880
to watch because you've ever put a gopro
 

8739
02:10:36,880 --> 02:10:37,910
to watch because you've ever put a gopro
on someone's head where they're looking

8740
02:10:37,910 --> 02:10:37,920
on someone's head where they're looking
 

8741
02:10:37,920 --> 02:10:39,189
on someone's head where they're looking
around like this all the time it'll

8742
02:10:39,189 --> 02:10:39,199
around like this all the time it'll
 

8743
02:10:39,199 --> 02:10:41,750
around like this all the time it'll
it'll nauseate you so we never turn that

8744
02:10:41,750 --> 02:10:41,760
it'll nauseate you so we never turn that
 

8745
02:10:41,760 --> 02:10:43,189
it'll nauseate you so we never turn that
on and all you know it's the one thing i

8746
02:10:43,189 --> 02:10:43,199
on and all you know it's the one thing i
 

8747
02:10:43,199 --> 02:10:44,629
on and all you know it's the one thing i
didn't do is reach down and hit the

8748
02:10:44,629 --> 02:10:44,639
didn't do is reach down and hit the
 

8749
02:10:44,639 --> 02:10:45,270
didn't do is reach down and hit the
switch

8750
02:10:45,270 --> 02:10:45,280
switch
 

8751
02:10:45,280 --> 02:10:46,709
switch
yeah you know and then we didn't go back

8752
02:10:46,709 --> 02:10:46,719
yeah you know and then we didn't go back
 

8753
02:10:46,719 --> 02:10:47,990
yeah you know and then we didn't go back
and because our tapes didn't have

8754
02:10:47,990 --> 02:10:48,000
and because our tapes didn't have
 

8755
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:49,270
and because our tapes didn't have
anything because we didn't get it on

8756
02:10:49,270 --> 02:10:49,280
anything because we didn't get it on
 

8757
02:10:49,280 --> 02:10:50,550
anything because we didn't get it on
radar

8758
02:10:50,550 --> 02:10:50,560
radar
 

8759
02:10:50,560 --> 02:10:53,350
radar
um because i tried to lock it up because

8760
02:10:53,350 --> 02:10:53,360
um because i tried to lock it up because
 

8761
02:10:53,360 --> 02:10:54,870
um because i tried to lock it up because
i can move the radar with my head but i

8762
02:10:54,870 --> 02:10:54,880
i can move the radar with my head but i
 

8763
02:10:54,880 --> 02:10:55,350
i can move the radar with my head but i
couldn't

8764
02:10:55,350 --> 02:10:55,360
couldn't
 

8765
02:10:55,360 --> 02:10:57,030
couldn't
it wouldn't lock the radar would lock

8766
02:10:57,030 --> 02:10:57,040
it wouldn't lock the radar would lock
 

8767
02:10:57,040 --> 02:10:58,870
it wouldn't lock the radar would lock
and so

8768
02:10:58,870 --> 02:10:58,880
and so
 

8769
02:10:58,880 --> 02:11:01,189
and so
so then the question is and this is

8770
02:11:01,189 --> 02:11:01,199
so then the question is and this is
 

8771
02:11:01,199 --> 02:11:03,750
so then the question is and this is
unanswerable but let's try

8772
02:11:03,750 --> 02:11:03,760
unanswerable but let's try
 

8773
02:11:03,760 --> 02:11:05,830
unanswerable but let's try
did you get some hints at it do you

8774
02:11:05,830 --> 02:11:05,840
did you get some hints at it do you
 

8775
02:11:05,840 --> 02:11:06,790
did you get some hints at it do you
think it's human

8776
02:11:06,790 --> 02:11:06,800
think it's human
 

8777
02:11:06,800 --> 02:11:09,750
think it's human
like advanced human created technology

8778
02:11:09,750 --> 02:11:09,760
like advanced human created technology
 

8779
02:11:09,760 --> 02:11:10,790
like advanced human created technology
that's

8780
02:11:10,790 --> 02:11:10,800
that's
 

8781
02:11:10,800 --> 02:11:13,830
that's
simply top secret that we're just not

8782
02:11:13,830 --> 02:11:13,840
simply top secret that we're just not
 

8783
02:11:13,840 --> 02:11:16,950
simply top secret that we're just not
aware of or is it not something not of

8784
02:11:16,950 --> 02:11:16,960
aware of or is it not something not of
 

8785
02:11:16,960 --> 02:11:18,390
aware of or is it not something not of
this world

8786
02:11:18,390 --> 02:11:18,400
this world
 

8787
02:11:18,400 --> 02:11:21,430
this world
so you if you'd asked me in 2004

8788
02:11:21,430 --> 02:11:21,440
so you if you'd asked me in 2004
 

8789
02:11:21,440 --> 02:11:25,030
so you if you'd asked me in 2004
i just said i don't know if you ask me

8790
02:11:25,030 --> 02:11:25,040
i just said i don't know if you ask me
 

8791
02:11:25,040 --> 02:11:25,910
i just said i don't know if you ask me
now

8792
02:11:25,910 --> 02:11:25,920
now
 

8793
02:11:25,920 --> 02:11:30,950
now
so we're coming up on 16 years ago

8794
02:11:30,950 --> 02:11:30,960

 

8795
02:11:30,960 --> 02:11:34,069

for a technology like that you know and

8796
02:11:34,069 --> 02:11:34,079
for a technology like that you know and
 

8797
02:11:34,079 --> 02:11:35,510
for a technology like that you know and
let's assume that it didn't have a

8798
02:11:35,510 --> 02:11:35,520
let's assume that it didn't have a
 

8799
02:11:35,520 --> 02:11:37,030
let's assume that it didn't have a
conventional propulsion system in it

8800
02:11:37,030 --> 02:11:37,040
conventional propulsion system in it
 

8801
02:11:37,040 --> 02:11:40,629
conventional propulsion system in it
because i don't think it did

8802
02:11:40,629 --> 02:11:40,639

 

8803
02:11:40,639 --> 02:11:42,229

i would like to think that if we had a

8804
02:11:42,229 --> 02:11:42,239
i would like to think that if we had a
 

8805
02:11:42,239 --> 02:11:44,069
i would like to think that if we had a
technology that would advance mankind

8806
02:11:44,069 --> 02:11:44,079
technology that would advance mankind
 

8807
02:11:44,079 --> 02:11:45,430
technology that would advance mankind
leaps and bounds from what we normally

8808
02:11:45,430 --> 02:11:45,440
leaps and bounds from what we normally
 

8809
02:11:45,440 --> 02:11:46,229
leaps and bounds from what we normally
do

8810
02:11:46,229 --> 02:11:46,239
do
 

8811
02:11:46,239 --> 02:11:48,069
do
then it would start coming out but to

8812
02:11:48,069 --> 02:11:48,079
then it would start coming out but to
 

8813
02:11:48,079 --> 02:11:50,790
then it would start coming out but to
hide something like that for 16 years

8814
02:11:50,790 --> 02:11:50,800
hide something like that for 16 years
 

8815
02:11:50,800 --> 02:11:53,109
hide something like that for 16 years
you know and i understand uh you know

8816
02:11:53,109 --> 02:11:53,119
you know and i understand uh you know
 

8817
02:11:53,119 --> 02:11:54,310
you know and i understand uh you know
and i don't speak for the united states

8818
02:11:54,310 --> 02:11:54,320
and i don't speak for the united states
 

8819
02:11:54,320 --> 02:11:54,870
and i don't speak for the united states
government i

8820
02:11:54,870 --> 02:11:54,880
government i
 

8821
02:11:54,880 --> 02:11:56,149
government i
never will speak for the united states

8822
02:11:56,149 --> 02:11:56,159
never will speak for the united states
 

8823
02:11:56,159 --> 02:11:57,350
never will speak for the united states
government but i understand how some of

8824
02:11:57,350 --> 02:11:57,360
government but i understand how some of
 

8825
02:11:57,360 --> 02:11:58,629
government but i understand how some of
that stuff works for classification

8826
02:11:58,629 --> 02:11:58,639
that stuff works for classification
 

8827
02:11:58,639 --> 02:12:00,069
that stuff works for classification
levels and why we classify stuff you

8828
02:12:00,069 --> 02:12:00,079
levels and why we classify stuff you
 

8829
02:12:00,079 --> 02:12:00,790
levels and why we classify stuff you
know is it

8830
02:12:00,790 --> 02:12:00,800
know is it
 

8831
02:12:00,800 --> 02:12:03,109
know is it
is it detrimental to national defense

8832
02:12:03,109 --> 02:12:03,119
is it detrimental to national defense
 

8833
02:12:03,119 --> 02:12:04,310
is it detrimental to national defense
but there's a point where you have to

8834
02:12:04,310 --> 02:12:04,320
but there's a point where you have to
 

8835
02:12:04,320 --> 02:12:05,109
but there's a point where you have to
look and go

8836
02:12:05,109 --> 02:12:05,119
look and go
 

8837
02:12:05,119 --> 02:12:06,629
look and go
if we had a technology like this that

8838
02:12:06,629 --> 02:12:06,639
if we had a technology like this that
 

8839
02:12:06,639 --> 02:12:09,669
if we had a technology like this that
could literally change the way

8840
02:12:09,669 --> 02:12:09,679
could literally change the way
 

8841
02:12:09,679 --> 02:12:12,390
could literally change the way
mankind travels how we get things into

8842
02:12:12,390 --> 02:12:12,400
mankind travels how we get things into
 

8843
02:12:12,400 --> 02:12:13,350
mankind travels how we get things into
space

8844
02:12:13,350 --> 02:12:13,360
space
 

8845
02:12:13,360 --> 02:12:15,109
space
our ability to do things you know you

8846
02:12:15,109 --> 02:12:15,119
our ability to do things you know you
 

8847
02:12:15,119 --> 02:12:16,790
our ability to do things you know you
talk about you know are we gonna go to

8848
02:12:16,790 --> 02:12:16,800
talk about you know are we gonna go to
 

8849
02:12:16,800 --> 02:12:18,229
talk about you know are we gonna go to
mars well if you have something that has

8850
02:12:18,229 --> 02:12:18,239
mars well if you have something that has
 

8851
02:12:18,239 --> 02:12:19,270
mars well if you have something that has
the ability to go

8852
02:12:19,270 --> 02:12:19,280
the ability to go
 

8853
02:12:19,280 --> 02:12:20,149
the ability to go
because remember these things were

8854
02:12:20,149 --> 02:12:20,159
because remember these things were
 

8855
02:12:20,159 --> 02:12:21,430
because remember these things were
coming down when the cruiser tracked

8856
02:12:21,430 --> 02:12:21,440
coming down when the cruiser tracked
 

8857
02:12:21,440 --> 02:12:23,189
coming down when the cruiser tracked
them from above 80 000 feet which is

8858
02:12:23,189 --> 02:12:23,199
them from above 80 000 feet which is
 

8859
02:12:23,199 --> 02:12:25,030
them from above 80 000 feet which is
space and they would come down and they

8860
02:12:25,030 --> 02:12:25,040
space and they would come down and they
 

8861
02:12:25,040 --> 02:12:26,390
space and they would come down and they
would come straight down they'd hang out

8862
02:12:26,390 --> 02:12:26,400
would come straight down they'd hang out
 

8863
02:12:26,400 --> 02:12:28,229
would come straight down they'd hang out
at like 20 000 feet and then

8864
02:12:28,229 --> 02:12:28,239
at like 20 000 feet and then
 

8865
02:12:28,239 --> 02:12:29,589
at like 20 000 feet and then
three or four hours later they'd go back

8866
02:12:29,589 --> 02:12:29,599
three or four hours later they'd go back
 

8867
02:12:29,599 --> 02:12:30,950
three or four hours later they'd go back
up we don't have anything that can come

8868
02:12:30,950 --> 02:12:30,960
up we don't have anything that can come
 

8869
02:12:30,960 --> 02:12:32,229
up we don't have anything that can come
down hang out in once

8870
02:12:32,229 --> 02:12:32,239
down hang out in once
 

8871
02:12:32,239 --> 02:12:35,189
down hang out in once
you know and i'm talking hold out in a

8872
02:12:35,189 --> 02:12:35,199
you know and i'm talking hold out in a
 

8873
02:12:35,199 --> 02:12:36,550
you know and i'm talking hold out in a
spot well we all know there's winds

8874
02:12:36,550 --> 02:12:36,560
spot well we all know there's winds
 

8875
02:12:36,560 --> 02:12:37,830
spot well we all know there's winds
they're not drifting like a balloon

8876
02:12:37,830 --> 02:12:37,840
they're not drifting like a balloon
 

8877
02:12:37,840 --> 02:12:39,030
they're not drifting like a balloon
they're just sitting there

8878
02:12:39,030 --> 02:12:39,040
they're just sitting there
 

8879
02:12:39,040 --> 02:12:40,950
they're just sitting there
and then they would go back up and they

8880
02:12:40,950 --> 02:12:40,960
and then they would go back up and they
 

8881
02:12:40,960 --> 02:12:42,069
and then they would go back up and they
tracked up to the

8882
02:12:42,069 --> 02:12:42,079
tracked up to the
 

8883
02:12:42,079 --> 02:12:43,910
tracked up to the
when i talked to the controller he's

8884
02:12:43,910 --> 02:12:43,920
when i talked to the controller he's
 

8885
02:12:43,920 --> 02:12:45,910
when i talked to the controller he's
like we've seen up to 10 of these things

8886
02:12:45,910 --> 02:12:45,920
like we've seen up to 10 of these things
 

8887
02:12:45,920 --> 02:12:47,589
like we've seen up to 10 of these things
there's other guys and it was raining

8888
02:12:47,589 --> 02:12:47,599
there's other guys and it was raining
 

8889
02:12:47,599 --> 02:12:49,589
there's other guys and it was raining
and all this other let's just say they

8890
02:12:49,589 --> 02:12:49,599
and all this other let's just say they
 

8891
02:12:49,599 --> 02:12:50,629
and all this other let's just say they
tracked a

8892
02:12:50,629 --> 02:12:50,639
tracked a
 

8893
02:12:50,639 --> 02:12:53,270
tracked a
groups of these things coming down

8894
02:12:53,270 --> 02:12:53,280
groups of these things coming down
 

8895
02:12:53,280 --> 02:12:55,030
groups of these things coming down
hanging out and going up

8896
02:12:55,030 --> 02:12:55,040
hanging out and going up
 

8897
02:12:55,040 --> 02:12:57,270
hanging out and going up
so it's not just propulsion and the way

8898
02:12:57,270 --> 02:12:57,280
so it's not just propulsion and the way
 

8899
02:12:57,280 --> 02:12:58,390
so it's not just propulsion and the way
it moves it's also

8900
02:12:58,390 --> 02:12:58,400
it moves it's also
 

8901
02:12:58,400 --> 02:13:01,109
it moves it's also
fuel it's everything so the whole the

8902
02:13:01,109 --> 02:13:01,119
fuel it's everything so the whole the
 

8903
02:13:01,119 --> 02:13:03,350
fuel it's everything so the whole the
whole of it indicates

8904
02:13:03,350 --> 02:13:03,360
whole of it indicates
 

8905
02:13:03,360 --> 02:13:06,390
whole of it indicates
of a kind of technology that's uh

8906
02:13:06,390 --> 02:13:06,400
of a kind of technology that's uh
 

8907
02:13:06,400 --> 02:13:08,310
of a kind of technology that's uh
highly advanced but you don't think in

8908
02:13:08,310 --> 02:13:08,320
highly advanced but you don't think in
 

8909
02:13:08,320 --> 02:13:09,669
highly advanced but you don't think in
your sense

8910
02:13:09,669 --> 02:13:09,679
your sense
 

8911
02:13:09,679 --> 02:13:11,589
your sense
that you actually don't know but you

8912
02:13:11,589 --> 02:13:11,599
that you actually don't know but you
 

8913
02:13:11,599 --> 02:13:13,030
that you actually don't know but you
know more than

8914
02:13:13,030 --> 02:13:13,040
know more than
 

8915
02:13:13,040 --> 02:13:16,310
know more than
a lot of people in your sense the

8916
02:13:16,310 --> 02:13:16,320
a lot of people in your sense the
 

8917
02:13:16,320 --> 02:13:18,950
a lot of people in your sense the
top secret military technology if you

8918
02:13:18,950 --> 02:13:18,960
top secret military technology if you
 

8919
02:13:18,960 --> 02:13:20,149
top secret military technology if you
think about skunk works if you think

8920
02:13:20,149 --> 02:13:20,159
think about skunk works if you think
 

8921
02:13:20,159 --> 02:13:21,270
think about skunk works if you think
about like that

8922
02:13:21,270 --> 02:13:21,280
about like that
 

8923
02:13:21,280 --> 02:13:25,350
about like that
cannot be more than 15 years ahead

8924
02:13:25,350 --> 02:13:25,360
cannot be more than 15 years ahead
 

8925
02:13:25,360 --> 02:13:28,470
cannot be more than 15 years ahead
i would say for a leap like that and and

8926
02:13:28,470 --> 02:13:28,480
i would say for a leap like that and and
 

8927
02:13:28,480 --> 02:13:30,629
i would say for a leap like that and and
a perfect example in modern times is the

8928
02:13:30,629 --> 02:13:30,639
a perfect example in modern times is the
 

8929
02:13:30,639 --> 02:13:32,229
a perfect example in modern times is the
117.

8930
02:13:32,229 --> 02:13:32,239
117.
 

8931
02:13:32,239 --> 02:13:33,990
117.
because now a lot of the data on the 117

8932
02:13:33,990 --> 02:13:34,000
because now a lot of the data on the 117
 

8933
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:35,350
because now a lot of the data on the 117
is out like it was developed at this

8934
02:13:35,350 --> 02:13:35,360
is out like it was developed at this
 

8935
02:13:35,360 --> 02:13:36,310
is out like it was developed at this
time

8936
02:13:36,310 --> 02:13:36,320
time
 

8937
02:13:36,320 --> 02:13:37,910
time
it flew for this long before it was

8938
02:13:37,910 --> 02:13:37,920
it flew for this long before it was
 

8939
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:39,189
it flew for this long before it was
actually acknowledged by the united

8940
02:13:39,189 --> 02:13:39,199
actually acknowledged by the united
 

8941
02:13:39,199 --> 02:13:40,870
actually acknowledged by the united
states government what's the 117. that's

8942
02:13:40,870 --> 02:13:40,880
states government what's the 117. that's
 

8943
02:13:40,880 --> 02:13:42,069
states government what's the 117. that's
the stealth fighter

8944
02:13:42,069 --> 02:13:42,079
the stealth fighter
 

8945
02:13:42,079 --> 02:13:43,669
the stealth fighter
the original stealth fighter not the b-2

8946
02:13:43,669 --> 02:13:43,679
the original stealth fighter not the b-2
 

8947
02:13:43,679 --> 02:13:45,189
the original stealth fighter not the b-2
but the stealth fighter so

8948
02:13:45,189 --> 02:13:45,199
but the stealth fighter so
 

8949
02:13:45,199 --> 02:13:48,069
but the stealth fighter so
you look at that you know yeah you can i

8950
02:13:48,069 --> 02:13:48,079
you look at that you know yeah you can i
 

8951
02:13:48,079 --> 02:13:50,229
you look at that you know yeah you can i
think you can hide things for a while

8952
02:13:50,229 --> 02:13:50,239
think you can hide things for a while
 

8953
02:13:50,239 --> 02:13:53,030
think you can hide things for a while
um but i think a technology a leap i

8954
02:13:53,030 --> 02:13:53,040
um but i think a technology a leap i
 

8955
02:13:53,040 --> 02:13:53,830
um but i think a technology a leap i
mean this is not

8956
02:13:53,830 --> 02:13:53,840
mean this is not
 

8957
02:13:53,840 --> 02:13:56,470
mean this is not
this is not a hey we developed this and

8958
02:13:56,470 --> 02:13:56,480
this is not a hey we developed this and
 

8959
02:13:56,480 --> 02:13:57,030
this is not a hey we developed this and
we're

8960
02:13:57,030 --> 02:13:57,040
we're
 

8961
02:13:57,040 --> 02:13:59,830
we're
kind of pushing the edge of technology

8962
02:13:59,830 --> 02:13:59,840
kind of pushing the edge of technology
 

8963
02:13:59,840 --> 02:14:02,229
kind of pushing the edge of technology
this is a giant leap in technology

8964
02:14:02,229 --> 02:14:02,239
this is a giant leap in technology
 

8965
02:14:02,239 --> 02:14:04,870
this is a giant leap in technology
you know and the other one is do we have

8966
02:14:04,870 --> 02:14:04,880
you know and the other one is do we have
 

8967
02:14:04,880 --> 02:14:06,470
you know and the other one is do we have
the basis to do that you know

8968
02:14:06,470 --> 02:14:06,480
the basis to do that you know
 

8969
02:14:06,480 --> 02:14:07,510
the basis to do that you know
because usually when you have a

8970
02:14:07,510 --> 02:14:07,520
because usually when you have a
 

8971
02:14:07,520 --> 02:14:09,910
because usually when you have a
technology like that universities

8972
02:14:09,910 --> 02:14:09,920
technology like that universities
 

8973
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:12,629
technology like that universities
especially the one you're working at mit

8974
02:14:12,629 --> 02:14:12,639
especially the one you're working at mit
 

8975
02:14:12,639 --> 02:14:14,310
especially the one you're working at mit
a lot of the leading edge stuff is

8976
02:14:14,310 --> 02:14:14,320
a lot of the leading edge stuff is
 

8977
02:14:14,320 --> 02:14:16,069
a lot of the leading edge stuff is
coming out of the top tier universities

8978
02:14:16,069 --> 02:14:16,079
coming out of the top tier universities
 

8979
02:14:16,079 --> 02:14:17,669
coming out of the top tier universities
you know so you've got mit you've got

8980
02:14:17,669 --> 02:14:17,679
you know so you've got mit you've got
 

8981
02:14:17,679 --> 02:14:18,709
you know so you've got mit you've got
caltech you've got

02:14:18,709 --> 02:14:18,719
caltech you've got
 

8983
02:14:18,719 --> 02:14:21,270

naval post graduate school is another

8988
02:14:25,030 --> 02:14:25,040
naval post graduate school is another
 

8989
02:14:25,040 --> 02:14:27,109
naval post graduate school is another
one

8990
02:14:27,109 --> 02:14:27,119
one
 

8991
02:14:27,119 --> 02:14:28,390
one
there's usually indicators there's

8992
02:14:28,390 --> 02:14:28,400
there's usually indicators there's
 

8993
02:14:28,400 --> 02:14:31,270
there's usually indicators there's
papers of hey this is where we're going

8994
02:14:31,270 --> 02:14:31,280
papers of hey this is where we're going
 

8995
02:14:31,280 --> 02:14:32,470
papers of hey this is where we're going
i don't think there's a whole bunch of

8996
02:14:32,470 --> 02:14:32,480
i don't think there's a whole bunch of
 

8997
02:14:32,480 --> 02:14:34,390
i don't think there's a whole bunch of
papers on developing a

8998
02:14:34,390 --> 02:14:34,400
papers on developing a
 

8999
02:14:34,400 --> 02:14:36,550
papers on developing a
gravity-based propulsion system that

9000
02:14:36,550 --> 02:14:36,560
gravity-based propulsion system that
 

9001
02:14:36,560 --> 02:14:37,430
gravity-based propulsion system that
literally

9002
02:14:37,430 --> 02:14:37,440
literally
 

9003
02:14:37,440 --> 02:14:39,030
literally
i've got an object because how do you

9004
02:14:39,030 --> 02:14:39,040
i've got an object because how do you
 

9005
02:14:39,040 --> 02:14:40,470
i've got an object because how do you
how much power would it

9006
02:14:40,470 --> 02:14:40,480
how much power would it
 

9007
02:14:40,480 --> 02:14:43,430
how much power would it
cost to create a gravity field of your

9008
02:14:43,430 --> 02:14:43,440
cost to create a gravity field of your
 

9009
02:14:43,440 --> 02:14:43,910
cost to create a gravity field of your
own

9010
02:14:43,910 --> 02:14:43,920
own
 

9011
02:14:43,920 --> 02:14:45,510
own
that could actually be strong enough to

9012
02:14:45,510 --> 02:14:45,520
that could actually be strong enough to
 

9013
02:14:45,520 --> 02:14:48,149
that could actually be strong enough to
counter the giant orb that we live on

9014
02:14:48,149 --> 02:14:48,159
counter the giant orb that we live on
 

9015
02:14:48,159 --> 02:14:49,109
counter the giant orb that we live on
so by the way you mentioned

9016
02:14:49,109 --> 02:14:49,119
so by the way you mentioned
 

9017
02:14:49,119 --> 02:14:51,709
so by the way you mentioned
gravity-based that's kind of like the

9018
02:14:51,709 --> 02:14:51,719
gravity-based that's kind of like the
 

9019
02:14:51,719 --> 02:14:54,069
gravity-based that's kind of like the
hypothesizing that people do in terms of

9020
02:14:54,069 --> 02:14:54,079
hypothesizing that people do in terms of
 

9021
02:14:54,079 --> 02:14:55,030
hypothesizing that people do in terms of
uh

9022
02:14:55,030 --> 02:14:55,040
uh
 

9023
02:14:55,040 --> 02:14:56,790
uh
propulsion like what kind of propulsion

9024
02:14:56,790 --> 02:14:56,800
propulsion like what kind of propulsion
 

9025
02:14:56,800 --> 02:14:59,189
propulsion like what kind of propulsion
would have to uh

9026
02:14:59,189 --> 02:14:59,199
would have to uh
 

9027
02:14:59,199 --> 02:15:01,430
would have to uh
would have to be involved in order to

9028
02:15:01,430 --> 02:15:01,440
would have to be involved in order to
 

9029
02:15:01,440 --> 02:15:03,030
would have to be involved in order to
result in that kind of movement

9030
02:15:03,030 --> 02:15:03,040
result in that kind of movement
 

9031
02:15:03,040 --> 02:15:05,030
result in that kind of movement
to me all the gravity discussions just

9032
02:15:05,030 --> 02:15:05,040
to me all the gravity discussions just
 

9033
02:15:05,040 --> 02:15:06,550
to me all the gravity discussions just
seems insane uh from a physics

9034
02:15:06,550 --> 02:15:06,560
seems insane uh from a physics
 

9035
02:15:06,560 --> 02:15:08,790
seems insane uh from a physics
perspective but of course

9036
02:15:08,790 --> 02:15:08,800
perspective but of course
 

9037
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:12,069
perspective but of course
uh it would seem insane uh until

9038
02:15:12,069 --> 02:15:12,079
uh it would seem insane uh until
 

9039
02:15:12,079 --> 02:15:14,709
uh it would seem insane uh until
it's not but because remember we only

9040
02:15:14,709 --> 02:15:14,719
it's not but because remember we only
 

9041
02:15:14,719 --> 02:15:16,550
it's not but because remember we only
know what we know

9042
02:15:16,550 --> 02:15:16,560
know what we know
 

9043
02:15:16,560 --> 02:15:18,870
know what we know
yeah and and which is very little and

9044
02:15:18,870 --> 02:15:18,880
yeah and and which is very little and
 

9045
02:15:18,880 --> 02:15:19,990
yeah and and which is very little and
someone has relatively

9046
02:15:19,990 --> 02:15:20,000
someone has relatively
 

9047
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:24,069
someone has relatively
think out of the box to go

9048
02:15:24,069 --> 02:15:24,079

 

9049
02:15:24,079 --> 02:15:26,629

is this possible at all yeah well okay

9050
02:15:26,629 --> 02:15:26,639
is this possible at all yeah well okay
 

9051
02:15:26,639 --> 02:15:27,189
is this possible at all yeah well okay
so this

9052
02:15:27,189 --> 02:15:27,199
so this
 

9053
02:15:27,199 --> 02:15:28,790
so this
so you're you're saying that if you had

9054
02:15:28,790 --> 02:15:28,800
so you're you're saying that if you had
 

9055
02:15:28,800 --> 02:15:30,870
so you're you're saying that if you had
to bet money all your money

9056
02:15:30,870 --> 02:15:30,880
to bet money all your money
 

9057
02:15:30,880 --> 02:15:34,149
to bet money all your money
it would be something that's

9058
02:15:34,149 --> 02:15:34,159
it would be something that's
 

9059
02:15:34,159 --> 02:15:36,149
it would be something that's
alien technology so it's not

9060
02:15:36,149 --> 02:15:36,159
alien technology so it's not
 

9061
02:15:36,159 --> 02:15:37,910
alien technology so it's not
human-created technology well i don't

9062
02:15:37,910 --> 02:15:37,920
human-created technology well i don't
 

9063
02:15:37,920 --> 02:15:39,510
human-created technology well i don't
like to get into little green men but i

9064
02:15:39,510 --> 02:15:39,520
like to get into little green men but i
 

9065
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:40,550
like to get into little green men but i
would say that i don't

9066
02:15:40,550 --> 02:15:40,560
would say that i don't
 

9067
02:15:40,560 --> 02:15:42,709
would say that i don't
i don't think people development right i

9068
02:15:42,709 --> 02:15:42,719
i don't think people development right i
 

9069
02:15:42,719 --> 02:15:43,990
i don't think people development right i
don't think we've developed it

9070
02:15:43,990 --> 02:15:44,000
don't think we've developed it
 

9071
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:45,589
don't think we've developed it
i just you know because the other one

9072
02:15:45,589 --> 02:15:45,599
i just you know because the other one
 

9073
02:15:45,599 --> 02:15:46,950
i just you know because the other one
someone had asked me they said what if

9074
02:15:46,950 --> 02:15:46,960
someone had asked me they said what if
 

9075
02:15:46,960 --> 02:15:47,430
someone had asked me they said what if
there wasn't

9076
02:15:47,430 --> 02:15:47,440
there wasn't
 

9077
02:15:47,440 --> 02:15:49,109
there wasn't
maybe it was just a drone maybe it was a

9078
02:15:49,109 --> 02:15:49,119
maybe it was just a drone maybe it was a
 

9079
02:15:49,119 --> 02:15:50,709
maybe it was just a drone maybe it was a
uav

9080
02:15:50,709 --> 02:15:50,719
uav
 

9081
02:15:50,719 --> 02:15:53,830
uav
that got sent here from someplace else

9082
02:15:53,830 --> 02:15:53,840
that got sent here from someplace else
 

9083
02:15:53,840 --> 02:15:55,189
that got sent here from someplace else
i mean we've got stuff out there flying

9084
02:15:55,189 --> 02:15:55,199
i mean we've got stuff out there flying
 

9085
02:15:55,199 --> 02:15:57,430
i mean we've got stuff out there flying
around um

9086
02:15:57,430 --> 02:15:57,440
around um
 

9087
02:15:57,440 --> 02:16:00,229
around um
so i don't i don't know i mean i'd like

9088
02:16:00,229 --> 02:16:00,239
so i don't i don't know i mean i'd like
 

9089
02:16:00,239 --> 02:16:02,069
so i don't i don't know i mean i'd like
to sit around and talk to some of the

9090
02:16:02,069 --> 02:16:02,079
to sit around and talk to some of the
 

9091
02:16:02,079 --> 02:16:03,830
to sit around and talk to some of the
giant brains that think this stuff up i

9092
02:16:03,830 --> 02:16:03,840
giant brains that think this stuff up i
 

9093
02:16:03,840 --> 02:16:05,270
giant brains that think this stuff up i
was supposed to be on a podcast with one

9094
02:16:05,270 --> 02:16:05,280
was supposed to be on a podcast with one
 

9095
02:16:05,280 --> 02:16:06,390
was supposed to be on a podcast with one
of them

9096
02:16:06,390 --> 02:16:06,400
of them
 

9097
02:16:06,400 --> 02:16:09,589
of them
uh but such topic which uh you mean look

9098
02:16:09,589 --> 02:16:09,599
uh but such topic which uh you mean look
 

9099
02:16:09,599 --> 02:16:11,030
uh but such topic which uh you mean look
for drones for

9100
02:16:11,030 --> 02:16:11,040
for drones for
 

9101
02:16:11,040 --> 02:16:13,830
for drones for
just uh just space travel technology

9102
02:16:13,830 --> 02:16:13,840
just uh just space travel technology
 

9103
02:16:13,840 --> 02:16:15,270
just uh just space travel technology
because if you look at where we're going

9104
02:16:15,270 --> 02:16:15,280
because if you look at where we're going
 

9105
02:16:15,280 --> 02:16:16,229
because if you look at where we're going
you know because everyone talks about

9106
02:16:16,229 --> 02:16:16,239
you know because everyone talks about
 

9107
02:16:16,239 --> 02:16:17,830
you know because everyone talks about
mars

9108
02:16:17,830 --> 02:16:17,840
mars
 

9109
02:16:17,840 --> 02:16:19,430
mars
you okay and you know we're hey are we

9110
02:16:19,430 --> 02:16:19,440
you okay and you know we're hey are we
 

9111
02:16:19,440 --> 02:16:20,790
you okay and you know we're hey are we
gonna be able to colonize you know and i

9112
02:16:20,790 --> 02:16:20,800
gonna be able to colonize you know and i

what elon is bringing to the fact that

9360
02:19:48,710 --> 02:19:48,720
what elon is bringing to the fact that
 

9361
02:19:48,720 --> 02:19:49,910
what elon is bringing to the fact that
now

9362
02:19:49,910 --> 02:19:49,920
now
 

9363
02:19:49,920 --> 02:19:53,910
now

9364
02:19:53,910 --> 02:19:53,920
it's back in america it's actually
 

9365
02:19:53,920 --> 02:19:56,710
it's back in america it's actually
to me it's it's cost effective for us to

9366
02:19:56,710 --> 02:19:56,720
to me it's it's cost effective for us to
 

9367
02:19:56,720 --> 02:19:58,389
to me it's it's cost effective for us to
be able to do more stuff

9368
02:19:58,389 --> 02:19:58,399
be able to do more stuff
 

9369
02:19:58,399 --> 02:20:01,030

stone to go back
 

9383
02:20:09,120 --> 02:20:11,510
stone to go back
to start proving some of the technology

on the moon
 

9389
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:17,110
on the moon
and now we can get back off the moon uh

9390
02:20:17,110 --> 02:20:17,120
and now we can get back off the moon uh
 

9391

02:20:47,200 --> 02:20:48,309
so i've been obsessed with this since i
was a child

9424
02:20:48,309 --> 02:20:48,319
was a child
 

9425
02:20:48,319 --> 02:20:50,309
was a child
do you hope to uh do you think do you

9426
02:20:50,309 --> 02:20:50,319
do you hope to uh do you think do you
 

9427
02:20:50,319 --> 02:20:52,230
do you hope to uh do you think do you
hope that you'll go out

9428
02:20:52,230 --> 02:20:52,240
hope that you'll go out
 

9429
02:20:52,240 --> 02:20:55,510
hope that you'll go out
to the space one day

9430
02:20:55,510 --> 02:20:55,520
to the space one day
 

9431
02:20:55,520 --> 02:20:57,590
to the space one day
me if i had the opportunity i'd go in a

9432
02:20:57,590 --> 02:20:57,600
me if i had the opportunity i'd go in a
 

9433
02:20:57,600 --> 02:20:58,790
me if i had the opportunity i'd go in a
second you know

9434
02:20:58,790 --> 02:20:58,800
second you know
 

9435
02:20:58,800 --> 02:21:01,030
second you know
i am not i mean that's one of the hopes

9436
02:21:01,030 --> 02:21:01,040
i am not i mean that's one of the hopes
 

9437
02:21:01,040 --> 02:21:03,750
i am not i mean that's one of the hopes
of the commercial space flight is that

9438
02:21:03,750 --> 02:21:03,760
of the commercial space flight is that
 

9439
02:21:03,760 --> 02:21:06,309
of the commercial space flight is that
you know uh like people like i mean it

9440
02:21:06,309 --> 02:21:06,319
you know uh like people like i mean it
 

9441
02:21:06,319 --> 02:21:07,429
you know uh like people like i mean it
would be to us

9442
02:21:07,429 --> 02:21:07,439
would be to us
 

9443
02:21:07,439 --> 02:21:09,510
would be to us
tourism but you certainly wouldn't want

9444
02:21:09,510 --> 02:21:09,520
tourism but you certainly wouldn't want
 

9445
02:21:09,520 --> 02:21:10,870
tourism but you certainly wouldn't want
to in terms of you're now

9446
02:21:10,870 --> 02:21:10,880
to in terms of you're now
 

9447
02:21:10,880 --> 02:21:13,429
to in terms of you're now
kind of a civilian right i mean in a

9448
02:21:13,429 --> 02:21:13,439
kind of a civilian right i mean in a
 

9449
02:21:13,439 --> 02:21:15,030
kind of a civilian right i mean in a
sense that you're just a normal person

9450
02:21:15,030 --> 02:21:15,040
sense that you're just a normal person
 

9451
02:21:15,040 --> 02:21:16,469
sense that you're just a normal person
you're not a fighter pilot

9452
02:21:16,469 --> 02:21:16,479
you're not a fighter pilot
 

9453
02:21:16,479 --> 02:21:19,590
you're not a fighter pilot
currently but it seems like if we send a

9454
02:21:19,590 --> 02:21:19,600
currently but it seems like if we send a
 

9455
02:21:19,600 --> 02:21:21,030
currently but it seems like if we send a
civilian up there would be somebody like

9456
02:21:21,030 --> 02:21:21,040
civilian up there would be somebody like
 

9457
02:21:21,040 --> 02:21:21,750
civilian up there would be somebody like
you

9458
02:21:21,750 --> 02:21:21,760
you
 

9459
02:21:21,760 --> 02:21:24,790
you
in the next like 20 years i i'd be

9460
02:21:24,790 --> 02:21:24,800
in the next like 20 years i i'd be
 

9461
02:21:24,800 --> 02:21:26,070
in the next like 20 years i i'd be
you know if elon wants to throw me one

9462
02:21:26,070 --> 02:21:26,080
you know if elon wants to throw me one
 

9463
02:21:26,080 --> 02:21:27,190
you know if elon wants to throw me one
of those things i'd be all over i don't

9464
02:21:27,190 --> 02:21:27,200
of those things i'd be all over i don't
 

9465
02:21:27,200 --> 02:21:28,469
of those things i'd be all over i don't
know what my wife would say but you know

9466
02:21:28,469 --> 02:21:28,479
know what my wife would say but you know
 

9467
02:21:28,479 --> 02:21:29,270
know what my wife would say but you know
sometimes you gotta

9468
02:21:29,270 --> 02:21:29,280
sometimes you gotta
 

9469
02:21:29,280 --> 02:21:30,389
sometimes you gotta
you gotta get your kicks while you're

9470
02:21:30,389 --> 02:21:30,399
you gotta get your kicks while you're
 

9471
02:21:30,399 --> 02:21:32,309
you gotta get your kicks while you're
alive i'd love to hear that discussion

9472
02:21:32,309 --> 02:21:32,319
alive i'd love to hear that discussion
 

9473
02:21:32,319 --> 02:21:33,910
alive i'd love to hear that discussion
with your wife listen there's the pros

9474
02:21:33,910 --> 02:21:33,920
with your wife listen there's the pros
 

9475
02:21:33,920 --> 02:21:35,030
with your wife listen there's the pros
and cons

9476

on board high school so she

9480
02:21:38,469 --> 02:21:38,479
on board high school so she
 

9481
02:21:38,479 --> 02:21:40,710
on board high school so she
yeah she knows how i am you know most

9482
02:21:40,710 --> 02:21:40,720
yeah she knows how i am you know most
 

9483
02:21:40,720 --> 02:21:41,910
yeah she knows how i am you know most
people that know me are like yeah you're

9484
02:21:41,910 --> 02:21:41,920
people that know me are like yeah you're
 

9485
02:21:41,920 --> 02:21:43,190
people that know me are like yeah you're
pretty much the same person you were in

9486
02:21:43,190 --> 02:21:43,200
pretty much the same person you were in
 

9487
02:21:43,200 --> 02:21:43,750
pretty much the same person you were in
high school

9488
02:21:43,750 --> 02:21:43,760
high school
 

9489
02:21:43,760 --> 02:21:45,590
high school
you know i was a class clown and i still

9490
02:21:45,590 --> 02:21:45,600
you know i was a class clown and i still
 

9491
02:21:45,600 --> 02:21:46,870
you know i was a class clown and i still
am that way

9492
02:21:46,870 --> 02:21:46,880
am that way
 

9493
02:21:46,880 --> 02:21:49,349
am that way
um so let me ask you this question about

9494
02:21:49,349 --> 02:21:49,359
um so let me ask you this question about
 

9495
02:21:49,359 --> 02:21:52,309
um so let me ask you this question about
so i'm talking to elon again soon

9496
02:21:52,309 --> 02:21:52,319
so i'm talking to elon again soon
 

9497
02:21:52,319 --> 02:21:54,630
so i'm talking to elon again soon
i'm curious to get your perspective on

9498
02:21:54,630 --> 02:21:54,640
i'm curious to get your perspective on
 

9499
02:21:54,640 --> 02:21:57,030
i'm curious to get your perspective on
it

9500
02:21:57,030 --> 02:21:57,040

 

9501
02:21:57,040 --> 02:21:59,429

if i wanted to talk to him about tic tac

9502
02:21:59,429 --> 02:21:59,439
if i wanted to talk to him about tic tac
 

9503
02:21:59,439 --> 02:22:00,950
if i wanted to talk to him about tic tac
about

9504
02:22:00,950 --> 02:22:00,960
about
 

9505
02:22:00,960 --> 02:22:04,469
about
these weird out there propulsion

9506
02:22:04,469 --> 02:22:04,479
these weird out there propulsion
 

9507
02:22:04,479 --> 02:22:06,469
these weird out there propulsion
ideas which are obviously just like you

9508
02:22:06,469 --> 02:22:06,479
ideas which are obviously just like you
 

9509
02:22:06,479 --> 02:22:08,790
ideas which are obviously just like you
said if there's something to it

9510
02:22:08,790 --> 02:22:08,800
said if there's something to it
 

9511
02:22:08,800 --> 02:22:11,190
said if there's something to it
if it can be investigated somehow it

9512
02:22:11,190 --> 02:22:11,200
if it can be investigated somehow it
 

9513
02:22:11,200 --> 02:22:12,790
if it can be investigated somehow it
would be extremely useful

9514
02:22:12,790 --> 02:22:12,800
would be extremely useful
 

9515
02:22:12,800 --> 02:22:14,630
would be extremely useful
for us to understand in the effort of

9516
02:22:14,630 --> 02:22:14,640
for us to understand in the effort of
 

9517
02:22:14,640 --> 02:22:15,990
for us to understand in the effort of
developing

9518
02:22:15,990 --> 02:22:16,000
developing
 

9519
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:17,750
developing
propulsion systems that can get us

9520
02:22:17,750 --> 02:22:17,760
propulsion systems that can get us
 

9521
02:22:17,760 --> 02:22:20,389
propulsion systems that can get us
cheaply to out to space

9522
02:22:20,389 --> 02:22:20,399
cheaply to out to space
 

9523
02:22:20,399 --> 02:22:22,950
cheaply to out to space
what what should elon think about this

9524
02:22:22,950 --> 02:22:22,960
what what should elon think about this
 

9525
02:22:22,960 --> 02:22:24,230
what what should elon think about this
stuff what should he do

9526
02:22:24,230 --> 02:22:24,240
stuff what should he do
 

9527
02:22:24,240 --> 02:22:26,150
stuff what should he do
what should people like him i think

9528
02:22:26,150 --> 02:22:26,160
what should people like him i think
 

9529
02:22:26,160 --> 02:22:27,990
what should people like him i think
people need to open their aperture up

9530
02:22:27,990 --> 02:22:28,000
people need to open their aperture up
 

9531
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:31,349
people need to open their aperture up
and stay off of uh take the next step

9532
02:22:31,349 --> 02:22:31,359
and stay off of uh take the next step
 

9533
02:22:31,359 --> 02:22:32,389
and stay off of uh take the next step
and go

9534
02:22:32,389 --> 02:22:32,399
and go
 

9535
02:22:32,399 --> 02:22:36,230
and go
you know we are tied to fuels and either

9536
02:22:36,230 --> 02:22:36,240
you know we are tied to fuels and either
 

9537
02:22:36,240 --> 02:22:37,590
you know we are tied to fuels and either
solid rocket or liquid

9538
02:22:37,590 --> 02:22:37,600
solid rocket or liquid
 

9539
02:22:37,600 --> 02:22:38,870
solid rocket or liquid
you know whatever we do but it's it's a

9540
02:22:38,870 --> 02:22:38,880
you know whatever we do but it's it's a
 

9541
02:22:38,880 --> 02:22:40,950
you know whatever we do but it's it's a
thrust generated where we rapidly expand

9542
02:22:40,950 --> 02:22:40,960
thrust generated where we rapidly expand
 

9543
02:22:40,960 --> 02:22:42,630
thrust generated where we rapidly expand
gas to create thrust

9544
02:22:42,630 --> 02:22:42,640
gas to create thrust
 

9545
02:22:42,640 --> 02:22:44,790
gas to create thrust
which is really in layman's terms you

9546
02:22:44,790 --> 02:22:44,800
which is really in layman's terms you
 

9547
02:22:44,800 --> 02:22:46,389
which is really in layman's terms you
know we can get into what but

9548
02:22:46,389 --> 02:22:46,399
know we can get into what but
 

9549
02:22:46,399 --> 02:22:49,030
know we can get into what but
that's what it does um if you have

9550
02:22:49,030 --> 02:22:49,040
that's what it does um if you have
 

9551
02:22:49,040 --> 02:22:50,070
that's what it does um if you have
something that

9552
02:22:50,070 --> 02:22:50,080
something that
 

9553
02:22:50,080 --> 02:22:53,750
something that
you can contain that is a as a fuel

9554
02:22:53,750 --> 02:22:53,760
you can contain that is a as a fuel
 

9555
02:22:53,760 --> 02:22:54,870
you can contain that is a as a fuel
source that would last

9556
02:22:54,870 --> 02:22:54,880
source that would last
 

9557
02:22:54,880 --> 02:22:58,070
source that would last
a significant amount of time you know

9558
02:22:58,070 --> 02:22:58,080
a significant amount of time you know
 

9559
02:22:58,080 --> 02:22:59,429
a significant amount of time you know
those rocket boosters go and when

9560
02:22:59,429 --> 02:22:59,439
those rocket boosters go and when
 

9561
02:22:59,439 --> 02:23:00,630
those rocket boosters go and when
they're done they're done there's enough

9562
02:23:00,630 --> 02:23:00,640
they're done they're done there's enough
 

9563
02:23:00,640 --> 02:23:01,990
they're done they're done there's enough
to get them back down and that's it

9564
02:23:01,990 --> 02:23:02,000
to get them back down and that's it
 

9565
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:03,110
to get them back down and that's it
there's not a huge

9566
02:23:03,110 --> 02:23:03,120
there's not a huge
 

9567
02:23:03,120 --> 02:23:04,550
there's not a huge
you know not coming back and go well i

9568
02:23:04,550 --> 02:23:04,560
you know not coming back and go well i
 

9569
02:23:04,560 --> 02:23:05,990
you know not coming back and go well i
still got three quarters of a tank let's

9570
02:23:05,990 --> 02:23:06,000
still got three quarters of a tank let's
 

9571
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:07,349
still got three quarters of a tank let's
hold him on and do it again

9572
02:23:07,349 --> 02:23:07,359
hold him on and do it again
 

9573
02:23:07,359 --> 02:23:10,389
hold him on and do it again
his system's not doing that um

9574
02:23:10,389 --> 02:23:10,399
his system's not doing that um
 

9575
02:23:10,399 --> 02:23:13,429
his system's not doing that um
but you know the way the way contracting

9576
02:23:13,429 --> 02:23:13,439
but you know the way the way contracting
 

9577
02:23:13,439 --> 02:23:14,309
but you know the way the way contracting
especially in the government the

9578
02:23:14,309 --> 02:23:14,319
especially in the government the
 

9579
02:23:14,319 --> 02:23:16,150
especially in the government the

really hard
 

9697
02:24:53,680 --> 02:24:56,230
really hard
but if i take money like bezos money

9698
02:24:56,230 --> 02:24:56,240
but if i take money like bezos money
 

9699
02:24:56,240 --> 02:24:57,590
but if i take money like bezos money
elon money

9700
02:24:57,590 --> 02:24:57,600
elon money
 

9701
02:24:57,600 --> 02:24:59,190
elon money
and they let's just say they want to

9702
02:24:59,190 --> 02:24:59,200
and they let's just say they want to
 

9703
02:24:59,200 --> 02:25:01,990
and they let's just say they want to
work together they can split it up 50 50

9704
02:25:01,990 --> 02:25:02,000
work together they can split it up 50 50
 

9705
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:03,670
work together they can split it up 50 50
the two of them when the technology gets

9706
02:25:03,670 --> 02:25:03,680
the two of them when the technology gets
 

9707
02:25:03,680 --> 02:25:04,309
the two of them when the technology gets
developed

9708
02:25:04,309 --> 02:25:04,319
developed
 

9709
02:25:04,319 --> 02:25:06,309
developed
but now i'm not constrained by who has

9710
02:25:06,309 --> 02:25:06,319
but now i'm not constrained by who has
 

9711
02:25:06,319 --> 02:25:07,830
but now i'm not constrained by who has
to do the work i just want to make sure

9712
02:25:07,830 --> 02:25:07,840
to do the work i just want to make sure
 

9713
02:25:07,840 --> 02:25:09,349
to do the work i just want to make sure
that i try and keep it in the united

9714
02:25:09,349 --> 02:25:09,359
that i try and keep it in the united
 

9715
02:25:09,359 --> 02:25:10,870
that i try and keep it in the united
states because

9716
02:25:10,870 --> 02:25:10,880
states because
 

9717
02:25:10,880 --> 02:25:12,469
states because
technology is technology and if it gets

9718
02:25:12,469 --> 02:25:12,479
technology is technology and if it gets
 

9719
02:25:12,479 --> 02:25:14,309
technology is technology and if it gets
developed and gets over to where

9720
02:25:14,309 --> 02:25:14,319
developed and gets over to where
 

9721
02:25:14,319 --> 02:25:17,190
developed and gets over to where
you know a country gets a hold of it and

9722
02:25:17,190 --> 02:25:17,200
you know a country gets a hold of it and
 

9723
02:25:17,200 --> 02:25:18,630
you know a country gets a hold of it and
then just basically uses it for their

9724
02:25:18,630 --> 02:25:18,640
then just basically uses it for their
 

9725
02:25:18,640 --> 02:25:19,510
then just basically uses it for their
own because you save them all the

9726
02:25:19,510 --> 02:25:19,520
own because you save them all the
 

9727
02:25:19,520 --> 02:25:21,270
own because you save them all the
research time

9728
02:25:21,270 --> 02:25:21,280
research time
 

9729
02:25:21,280 --> 02:25:22,950
research time
you don't want to do that but if we can

9730
02:25:22,950 --> 02:25:22,960
you don't want to do that but if we can
 

9731
02:25:22,960 --> 02:25:24,389
you don't want to do that but if we can
get to the point where we can we do it

9732
02:25:24,389 --> 02:25:24,399
get to the point where we can we do it
 

9733
02:25:24,399 --> 02:25:25,670
get to the point where we can we do it
on the international space station we

9734
02:25:25,670 --> 02:25:25,680
on the international space station we
 

9735
02:25:25,680 --> 02:25:27,750
on the international space station we
realized that space was too expensive

9736
02:25:27,750 --> 02:25:27,760
realized that space was too expensive
 

9737
02:25:27,760 --> 02:25:30,070
realized that space was too expensive
for one country to do alone so we made

9738
02:25:30,070 --> 02:25:30,080
for one country to do alone so we made
 

9739
02:25:30,080 --> 02:25:31,349
for one country to do alone so we made
the international space station and we

9740
02:25:31,349 --> 02:25:31,359
the international space station and we
 

9741
02:25:31,359 --> 02:25:32,230
the international space station and we
have

9742
02:25:32,230 --> 02:25:32,240
have
 

9743
02:25:32,240 --> 02:25:35,270
have
a conglomerate it's the one thing that

9744
02:25:35,270 --> 02:25:35,280
a conglomerate it's the one thing that
 

9745
02:25:35,280 --> 02:25:36,389
a conglomerate it's the one thing that
the russians and the u.s

9746
02:25:36,389 --> 02:25:36,399
the russians and the u.s
 

9747
02:25:36,399 --> 02:25:38,630
the russians and the u.s
actually work together on think about it

9748
02:25:38,630 --> 02:25:38,640
actually work together on think about it
 

9749
02:25:38,640 --> 02:25:40,710
actually work together on think about it
that's it we work together on space

9750
02:25:40,710 --> 02:25:40,720
that's it we work together on space
 

9751
02:25:40,720 --> 02:25:42,230
that's it we work together on space
because we realize it's way too

9752
02:25:42,230 --> 02:25:42,240
because we realize it's way too
 

9753
02:25:42,240 --> 02:25:43,750
because we realize it's way too
expensive for us to do alone

9754
02:25:43,750 --> 02:25:43,760
expensive for us to do alone
 

9755
02:25:43,760 --> 02:25:45,670
expensive for us to do alone
and effective so we've got this thing

9756
02:25:45,670 --> 02:25:45,680
and effective so we've got this thing
 

9757
02:25:45,680 --> 02:25:46,790
and effective so we've got this thing
that's been out there floating around

9758
02:25:46,790 --> 02:25:46,800
that's been out there floating around
 

9759
02:25:46,800 --> 02:25:48,389
that's been out there floating around
for god now what is it like 20 years

9760
02:25:48,389 --> 02:25:48,399
for god now what is it like 20 years
 

9761
02:25:48,399 --> 02:25:49,349
for god now what is it like 20 years
that thing's been up there floating

9762
02:25:49,349 --> 02:25:49,359
that thing's been up there floating
 

9763
02:25:49,359 --> 02:25:49,830
that thing's been up there floating
around

9764
02:25:49,830 --> 02:25:49,840
around
 

9765
02:25:49,840 --> 02:25:51,190
around
so it's getting old we're gonna have to

9766
02:25:51,190 --> 02:25:51,200
so it's getting old we're gonna have to
 

9767
02:25:51,200 --> 02:25:53,349
so it's getting old we're gonna have to
replace parts and do stuff but

9768
02:25:53,349 --> 02:25:53,359
replace parts and do stuff but
 

9769
02:25:53,359 --> 02:25:55,110
replace parts and do stuff but
if we can pull the money together and

9770
02:25:55,110 --> 02:25:55,120
if we can pull the money together and
 

9771
02:25:55,120 --> 02:25:56,389
if we can pull the money together and
come up with a something that would

9772
02:25:56,389 --> 02:25:56,399
come up with a something that would
 

9773
02:25:56,399 --> 02:25:57,910
come up with a something that would
literally change mankind and change

9774
02:25:57,910 --> 02:25:57,920
literally change mankind and change
 

9775
02:25:57,920 --> 02:25:59,830
literally change mankind and change
travel and allow us to actually do a

9776
02:25:59,830 --> 02:25:59,840
travel and allow us to actually do a
 

9777
02:25:59,840 --> 02:26:01,750
travel and allow us to actually do a
more effective thing of exploring

9778
02:26:01,750 --> 02:26:01,760
more effective thing of exploring
 

9779
02:26:01,760 --> 02:26:03,510
more effective thing of exploring
because if you develop that technology

9780
02:26:03,510 --> 02:26:03,520
because if you develop that technology
 

9781
02:26:03,520 --> 02:26:04,790
because if you develop that technology
i'm not you don't even have to send a

9782
02:26:04,790 --> 02:26:04,800
i'm not you don't even have to send a
 

9783
02:26:04,800 --> 02:26:06,870
i'm not you don't even have to send a
man person if you can develop a

9784
02:26:06,870 --> 02:26:06,880
man person if you can develop a
 

9785
02:26:06,880 --> 02:26:07,910
man person if you can develop a
technology that's

9786
02:26:07,910 --> 02:26:07,920
technology that's
 

9787
02:26:07,920 --> 02:26:09,510
technology that's
so and with our automation and we're

9788
02:26:09,510 --> 02:26:09,520
so and with our automation and we're
 

9789
02:26:09,520 --> 02:26:11,030
so and with our automation and we're
progressing in our

9790
02:26:11,030 --> 02:26:11,040
progressing in our
 

9791
02:26:11,040 --> 02:26:13,030
progressing in our
our computing power to send something

9792
02:26:13,030 --> 02:26:13,040
our computing power to send something
 

9793
02:26:13,040 --> 02:26:15,670
our computing power to send something
out that's not just floating around when

9794
02:26:15,670 --> 02:26:15,680
out that's not just floating around when
 

9795
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:16,630
out that's not just floating around when
you know that

9796
02:26:16,630 --> 02:26:16,640
you know that
 

9797
02:26:16,640 --> 02:26:18,630
you know that
it can react a lot quicker something

9798
02:26:18,630 --> 02:26:18,640
it can react a lot quicker something
 

9799
02:26:18,640 --> 02:26:19,750
it can react a lot quicker something
that could actually go down to the

9800
02:26:19,750 --> 02:26:19,760
that could actually go down to the
 

9801
02:26:19,760 --> 02:26:21,349
that could actually go down to the
surface and come back up so right now

9802
02:26:21,349 --> 02:26:21,359
surface and come back up so right now
 

9803
02:26:21,359 --> 02:26:22,630
surface and come back up so right now
everything we get out of mars it goes

9804
02:26:22,630 --> 02:26:22,640
everything we get out of mars it goes
 

9805
02:26:22,640 --> 02:26:23,910
everything we get out of mars it goes
down there and then it just sends data

9806
02:26:23,910 --> 02:26:23,920
down there and then it just sends data
 

9807
02:26:23,920 --> 02:26:24,230
down there and then it just sends data
back

9808
02:26:24,230 --> 02:26:24,240
back
 

9809
02:26:24,240 --> 02:26:26,389
back
it analyzes it but i've got a technology

9810
02:26:26,389 --> 02:26:26,399
it analyzes it but i've got a technology
 

9811
02:26:26,399 --> 02:26:27,670
it analyzes it but i've got a technology
that can go up there really quick i'm

9812
02:26:27,670 --> 02:26:27,680
that can go up there really quick i'm
 

9813
02:26:27,680 --> 02:26:29,110
that can go up there really quick i'm
not worried about man i don't have life

9814
02:26:29,110 --> 02:26:29,120
not worried about man i don't have life
 

9815
02:26:29,120 --> 02:26:30,469
not worried about man i don't have life
support systems and all that but it can

9816
02:26:30,469 --> 02:26:30,479
support systems and all that but it can
 

9817
02:26:30,479 --> 02:26:32,790
support systems and all that but it can
go down it can go it can cruise around

9818
02:26:32,790 --> 02:26:32,800
go down it can go it can cruise around
 

9819
02:26:32,800 --> 02:26:34,550
go down it can go it can cruise around
it can hover above it can take samples

9820
02:26:34,550 --> 02:26:34,560
it can hover above it can take samples
 

9821
02:26:34,560 --> 02:26:36,230
it can hover above it can take samples
and it can actually take martian soil

9822
02:26:36,230 --> 02:26:36,240
and it can actually take martian soil
 

9823
02:26:36,240 --> 02:26:37,110
and it can actually take martian soil
and then bring it

9824
02:26:37,110 --> 02:26:37,120
and then bring it
 

9825
02:26:37,120 --> 02:26:39,750
and then bring it
back yeah so we can analyze it here

9826
02:26:39,750 --> 02:26:39,760
back yeah so we can analyze it here
 

9827
02:26:39,760 --> 02:26:40,870
back yeah so we can analyze it here
that's a game changer

9828
02:26:40,870 --> 02:26:40,880
that's a game changer
 

9829
02:26:40,880 --> 02:26:42,630
that's a game changer
it's a complete game changer because it

9830
02:26:42,630 --> 02:26:42,640
it's a complete game changer because it
 

9831
02:26:42,640 --> 02:26:44,790
it's a complete game changer because it
opens up all the planets

9832
02:26:44,790 --> 02:26:44,800
opens up all the planets
 

9833
02:26:44,800 --> 02:26:47,510
opens up all the planets
exactly so in the sense the the the tic

9834
02:26:47,510 --> 02:26:47,520
exactly so in the sense the the the tic
 

9835
02:26:47,520 --> 02:26:48,630
exactly so in the sense the the the tic
tac

9836
02:26:48,630 --> 02:26:48,640
tac
 

9837
02:26:48,640 --> 02:26:51,830
tac
is a symbol so uh whatever you think

9838
02:26:51,830 --> 02:26:51,840
is a symbol so uh whatever you think
 

9839
02:26:51,840 --> 02:26:53,830
is a symbol so uh whatever you think
even from a debunking perspective

9840
02:26:53,830 --> 02:26:53,840
even from a debunking perspective
 

9841
02:26:53,840 --> 02:26:56,469
even from a debunking perspective
there's a non-zero probability that it's

9842
02:26:56,469 --> 02:26:56,479
there's a non-zero probability that it's
 

9843
02:26:56,479 --> 02:26:58,230
there's a non-zero probability that it's
alien technology

9844
02:26:58,230 --> 02:26:58,240
alien technology
 

9845
02:26:58,240 --> 02:27:02,309
alien technology
and in that sense it serves as a

9846
02:27:02,309 --> 02:27:02,319
and in that sense it serves as a
 

9847
02:27:02,319 --> 02:27:05,510
and in that sense it serves as a
beacon of hope and a reason

9848
02:27:05,510 --> 02:27:05,520
beacon of hope and a reason
 

9849
02:27:05,520 --> 02:27:08,070
beacon of hope and a reason
to like you said widen the aperture and

9850
02:27:08,070 --> 02:27:08,080
to like you said widen the aperture and
 

9851
02:27:08,080 --> 02:27:09,190
to like you said widen the aperture and
to invest

9852
02:27:09,190 --> 02:27:09,200
to invest
 

9853
02:27:09,200 --> 02:27:12,389
to invest
big amounts of money into thinking

9854
02:27:12,389 --> 02:27:12,399
big amounts of money into thinking
 

9855
02:27:12,399 --> 02:27:13,670
big amounts of money into thinking
outside the box like

9856
02:27:13,670 --> 02:27:13,680
outside the box like
 

9857
02:27:13,680 --> 02:27:17,590
outside the box like
it's almost uh a hope

9858
02:27:17,590 --> 02:27:17,600
it's almost uh a hope
 

9859
02:27:17,600 --> 02:27:21,110
it's almost uh a hope
to say we can do better propulsion

9860
02:27:21,110 --> 02:27:21,120
to say we can do better propulsion
 

9861
02:27:21,120 --> 02:27:23,349
to say we can do better propulsion
we can overcome physics in an order of

9862
02:27:23,349 --> 02:27:23,359
we can overcome physics in an order of
 

9863
02:27:23,359 --> 02:27:25,190
we can overcome physics in an order of
magnitude better way

9864
02:27:25,190 --> 02:27:25,200
magnitude better way
 

9865
02:27:25,200 --> 02:27:27,590
magnitude better way
and it's worthwhile to try i think and i

9866
02:27:27,590 --> 02:27:27,600
and it's worthwhile to try i think and i
 

9867
02:27:27,600 --> 02:27:28,389
and it's worthwhile to try i think and i
don't think the money

9868
02:27:28,389 --> 02:27:28,399
don't think the money
 

9869
02:27:28,399 --> 02:27:29,670
don't think the money
if you look at the big picture with the

9870
02:27:29,670 --> 02:27:29,680
if you look at the big picture with the
 

9871
02:27:29,680 --> 02:27:30,790
if you look at the big picture with the
amount of money some that's out there

9872
02:27:30,790 --> 02:27:30,800
amount of money some that's out there
 

9873
02:27:30,800 --> 02:27:33,030
amount of money some that's out there
floating around these private companies

9874
02:27:33,030 --> 02:27:33,040
floating around these private companies
 

9875
02:27:33,040 --> 02:27:34,389
floating around these private companies
you know i think if you said hey i've

9876
02:27:34,389 --> 02:27:34,399
you know i think if you said hey i've
 

9877
02:27:34,399 --> 02:27:36,230
you know i think if you said hey i've
got let's just say a hundred million

9878
02:27:36,230 --> 02:27:36,240
got let's just say a hundred million
 

9879
02:27:36,240 --> 02:27:37,349
got let's just say a hundred million
dollars which really a hundred million

9880
02:27:37,349 --> 02:27:37,359
dollars which really a hundred million
 

9881
02:27:37,359 --> 02:27:38,389
dollars which really a hundred million
dollars relative to

9882
02:27:38,389 --> 02:27:38,399
dollars relative to
 

9883
02:27:38,399 --> 02:27:39,910
dollars relative to
bezos has got 100 and some billion

9884
02:27:39,910 --> 02:27:39,920
bezos has got 100 and some billion
 

9885
02:27:39,920 --> 02:27:42,309
bezos has got 100 and some billion
dollars in the network so if he said hey

9886
02:27:42,309 --> 02:27:42,319
dollars in the network so if he said hey
 

9887
02:27:42,319 --> 02:27:44,550
dollars in the network so if he said hey
100 100 million dollars you drop 100

9888
02:27:44,550 --> 02:27:44,560
100 100 million dollars you drop 100
 

9889
02:27:44,560 --> 02:27:45,990
100 100 million dollars you drop 100
million dollars and i go

9890
02:27:45,990 --> 02:27:46,000
million dollars and i go
 

9891
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:47,510
million dollars and i go
and i'm gonna put a you know like the

9892
02:27:47,510 --> 02:27:47,520
and i'm gonna put a you know like the
 

9893
02:27:47,520 --> 02:27:49,110
and i'm gonna put a you know like the
government will send a

9894
02:27:49,110 --> 02:27:49,120
government will send a
 

9895
02:27:49,120 --> 02:27:50,389
government will send a
broad area announcement out that says

9896
02:27:50,389 --> 02:27:50,399
broad area announcement out that says
 

9897
02:27:50,399 --> 02:27:51,910
broad area announcement out that says
hey we're looking for this technology or

9898
02:27:51,910 --> 02:27:51,920
hey we're looking for this technology or
 

9899
02:27:51,920 --> 02:27:53,190
hey we're looking for this technology or
a darpa program

9900
02:27:53,190 --> 02:27:53,200
a darpa program
 

9901
02:27:53,200 --> 02:27:55,190
a darpa program
but what if i just said hey who's to

9902
02:27:55,190 --> 02:27:55,200
but what if i just said hey who's to
 

9903
02:27:55,200 --> 02:27:57,590
but what if i just said hey who's to
stop bezos and elon from doing that on

9904
02:27:57,590 --> 02:27:57,600
stop bezos and elon from doing that on
 

9905
02:27:57,600 --> 02:27:58,630
stop bezos and elon from doing that on
their own to say hey

9906
02:27:58,630 --> 02:27:58,640
their own to say hey
 

9907
02:27:58,640 --> 02:28:00,070
their own to say hey
i want to go pool universities because

9908
02:28:00,070 --> 02:28:00,080
i want to go pool universities because
 

9909
02:28:00,080 --> 02:28:01,670
i want to go pool universities because
they have fewer restrictions because

9910
02:28:01,670 --> 02:28:01,680
they have fewer restrictions because
 

9911
02:28:01,680 --> 02:28:03,030
they have fewer restrictions because
it's not tax dollars they don't have the

9912
02:28:03,030 --> 02:28:03,040
it's not tax dollars they don't have the
 

9913
02:28:03,040 --> 02:28:04,070
it's not tax dollars they don't have the
checks and bound they can do whatever

9914
02:28:04,070 --> 02:28:04,080
checks and bound they can do whatever
 

9915
02:28:04,080 --> 02:28:05,270
checks and bound they can do whatever
they want it's their money

9916
02:28:05,270 --> 02:28:05,280
they want it's their money
 

9917
02:28:05,280 --> 02:28:08,150
they want it's their money
oh sorry about that um to go hey i'm

9918
02:28:08,150 --> 02:28:08,160
oh sorry about that um to go hey i'm
 

9919
02:28:08,160 --> 02:28:09,190
oh sorry about that um to go hey i'm
going to put this out and i'm going to

9920
02:28:09,190 --> 02:28:09,200
going to put this out and i'm going to
 

9921
02:28:09,200 --> 02:28:10,309
going to put this out and i'm going to
get the best

9922
02:28:10,309 --> 02:28:10,319
get the best
 

9923
02:28:10,319 --> 02:28:12,630
get the best
physicists that are working at cern that

9924
02:28:12,630 --> 02:28:12,640
physicists that are working at cern that
 

9925
02:28:12,640 --> 02:28:14,870
physicists that are working at cern that
are at mit that are at caltech at the

9926
02:28:14,870 --> 02:28:14,880
are at mit that are at caltech at the
 

9927
02:28:14,880 --> 02:28:16,230
are at mit that are at caltech at the
schools i mentioned and

9928
02:28:16,230 --> 02:28:16,240
schools i mentioned and
 

9929
02:28:16,240 --> 02:28:17,990
schools i mentioned and
oh by the way a few of these guys are

9930
02:28:17,990 --> 02:28:18,000
oh by the way a few of these guys are
 

9931
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:19,270
oh by the way a few of these guys are
propulsion experts and i'm going to

9932
02:28:19,270 --> 02:28:19,280
propulsion experts and i'm going to
 

9933
02:28:19,280 --> 02:28:20,070
propulsion experts and i'm going to
basically

9934
02:28:20,070 --> 02:28:20,080
basically
 

9935
02:28:20,080 --> 02:28:23,270
basically
i'm going to fund you guys for 10 years

9936
02:28:23,270 --> 02:28:23,280
i'm going to fund you guys for 10 years
 

9937
02:28:23,280 --> 02:28:25,349
i'm going to fund you guys for 10 years
so you get 10 million a year and i'm

9938
02:28:25,349 --> 02:28:25,359
so you get 10 million a year and i'm
 

9939
02:28:25,359 --> 02:28:26,870
so you get 10 million a year and i'm
gonna give your salaries and we're gonna

9940
02:28:26,870 --> 02:28:26,880
gonna give your salaries and we're gonna
 

9941
02:28:26,880 --> 02:28:28,150
gonna give your salaries and we're gonna
do that or whatever the amount works so

9942
02:28:28,150 --> 02:28:28,160
do that or whatever the amount works so
 

9943
02:28:28,160 --> 02:28:29,670
do that or whatever the amount works so
let's cut it down to five so we can pay

9944
02:28:29,670 --> 02:28:29,680
let's cut it down to five so we can pay
 

9945
02:28:29,680 --> 02:28:30,630
let's cut it down to five so we can pay
well

9946
02:28:30,630 --> 02:28:30,640
well
 

9947
02:28:30,640 --> 02:28:32,150
well
right to do the research but oh by the

9948
02:28:32,150 --> 02:28:32,160
right to do the research but oh by the
 

9949
02:28:32,160 --> 02:28:33,830
right to do the research but oh by the
way the research is

9950
02:28:33,830 --> 02:28:33,840
way the research is
 

9951
02:28:33,840 --> 02:28:36,389
way the research is
it's not classified but it's controlled

9952
02:28:36,389 --> 02:28:36,399
it's not classified but it's controlled
 

9953
02:28:36,399 --> 02:28:37,910
it's not classified but it's controlled
so we're not gonna publicly just put

9954
02:28:37,910 --> 02:28:37,920
so we're not gonna publicly just put
 

9955
02:28:37,920 --> 02:28:39,429
so we're not gonna publicly just put
this out in journals but if we make a

9956
02:28:39,429 --> 02:28:39,439
this out in journals but if we make a
 

9957
02:28:39,439 --> 02:28:40,469
this out in journals but if we make a
leap

9958
02:28:40,469 --> 02:28:40,479
leap
 

9959
02:28:40,479 --> 02:28:42,230
leap
that we think would advance because

9960
02:28:42,230 --> 02:28:42,240
that we think would advance because
 

9961
02:28:42,240 --> 02:28:43,750
that we think would advance because
although those let's say there's 10 of

9962
02:28:43,750 --> 02:28:43,760
although those let's say there's 10 of
 

9963
02:28:43,760 --> 02:28:44,070
although those let's say there's 10 of
them

9964
02:28:44,070 --> 02:28:44,080
them
 

9965
02:28:44,080 --> 02:28:45,429
them
those 10 scientists come up with

9966
02:28:45,429 --> 02:28:45,439
those 10 scientists come up with
 

9967
02:28:45,439 --> 02:28:47,190
those 10 scientists come up with
something and they put out a paper

9968
02:28:47,190 --> 02:28:47,200
something and they put out a paper
 

9969
02:28:47,200 --> 02:28:49,270
something and they put out a paper
there might be another a number 11 at

9970
02:28:49,270 --> 02:28:49,280
there might be another a number 11 at
 

9971
02:28:49,280 --> 02:28:51,030
there might be another a number 11 at
another university that reads that paper

9972
02:28:51,030 --> 02:28:51,040
another university that reads that paper
 

9973
02:28:51,040 --> 02:28:51,750
another university that reads that paper
and says hey

9974
02:28:51,750 --> 02:28:51,760
and says hey
 

9975
02:28:51,760 --> 02:28:54,230
and says hey
i kind of had this idea and now you can

9976
02:28:54,230 --> 02:28:54,240
i kind of had this idea and now you can
 

9977
02:28:54,240 --> 02:28:56,230
i kind of had this idea and now you can
get a thought pool that pushes us in

9978
02:28:56,230 --> 02:28:56,240
get a thought pool that pushes us in
 

9979
02:28:56,240 --> 02:28:59,110
get a thought pool that pushes us in
and gets us out of the the mindset

9980
02:28:59,110 --> 02:28:59,120
and gets us out of the the mindset
 

9981
02:28:59,120 --> 02:29:01,270
and gets us out of the the mindset
because we have a tendency to

9982
02:29:01,270 --> 02:29:01,280
because we have a tendency to
 

9983
02:29:01,280 --> 02:29:03,830
because we have a tendency to
we evolve the stuff that we create but

9984
02:29:03,830 --> 02:29:03,840
we evolve the stuff that we create but
 

9985
02:29:03,840 --> 02:29:05,270
we evolve the stuff that we create but
yeah it's like i was joking because you

9986
02:29:05,270 --> 02:29:05,280
yeah it's like i was joking because you
 

9987
02:29:05,280 --> 02:29:05,830
yeah it's like i was joking because you
know i

9988
02:29:05,830 --> 02:29:05,840
know i
 

9989
02:29:05,840 --> 02:29:09,110
know i
i know a ton of guys with phds and girls

9990
02:29:09,110 --> 02:29:09,120
i know a ton of guys with phds and girls
 

9991
02:29:09,120 --> 02:29:10,469
i know a ton of guys with phds and girls
and i said but you know how much when a

9992
02:29:10,469 --> 02:29:10,479
and i said but you know how much when a
 

9993
02:29:10,479 --> 02:29:12,230
and i said but you know how much when a
person gets a phd in like engineering

9994
02:29:12,230 --> 02:29:12,240
person gets a phd in like engineering
 

9995
02:29:12,240 --> 02:29:12,630
person gets a phd in like engineering
how much

9996
02:29:12,630 --> 02:29:12,640
how much
 

9997
02:29:12,640 --> 02:29:14,309
how much
new math is really being done i said

9998
02:29:14,309 --> 02:29:14,319
new math is really being done i said
 

9999
02:29:14,319 --> 02:29:15,910
new math is really being done i said
there's a handful of people in the world

10000
02:29:15,910 --> 02:29:15,920
there's a handful of people in the world
 

10001
02:29:15,920 --> 02:29:17,830
there's a handful of people in the world
that are really doing i'm talking

10002
02:29:17,830 --> 02:29:17,840
that are really doing i'm talking
 

10003
02:29:17,840 --> 02:29:19,429
that are really doing i'm talking
i'm talking stephen hawkins type

10004
02:29:19,429 --> 02:29:19,439
i'm talking stephen hawkins type
 

10005
02:29:19,439 --> 02:29:21,429
i'm talking stephen hawkins type
brilliance that is going

10006
02:29:21,429 --> 02:29:21,439
brilliance that is going
 

10007
02:29:21,439 --> 02:29:24,550
brilliance that is going
i'm really doing something that's yeah

10008
02:29:24,550 --> 02:29:24,560
i'm really doing something that's yeah
 

10009
02:29:24,560 --> 02:29:25,429
i'm really doing something that's yeah
that's totally

10010
02:29:25,429 --> 02:29:25,439
that's totally
 

10011
02:29:25,439 --> 02:29:27,110
that's totally
different that's a big dramatic thing

10012
02:29:27,110 --> 02:29:27,120
different that's a big dramatic thing
 

10013
02:29:27,120 --> 02:29:29,190
different that's a big dramatic thing
now going on in physics that everyone

10014
02:29:29,190 --> 02:29:29,200
now going on in physics that everyone
 

10015
02:29:29,200 --> 02:29:30,870
now going on in physics that everyone
is just everybody's conversed towards

10016
02:29:30,870 --> 02:29:30,880
is just everybody's conversed towards
 

10017
02:29:30,880 --> 02:29:32,630
is just everybody's conversed towards
this local minima or

10018
02:29:32,630 --> 02:29:32,640
this local minima or
 

10019
02:29:32,640 --> 02:29:34,070
this local minima or
local maximum whatever you think about

10020
02:29:34,070 --> 02:29:34,080
local maximum whatever you think about
 

10021
02:29:34,080 --> 02:29:36,230
local maximum whatever you think about
it and it's it's again

10022
02:29:36,230 --> 02:29:36,240
it and it's it's again
 

10023
02:29:36,240 --> 02:29:38,550
it and it's it's again
same as with the tic tac thinking

10024
02:29:38,550 --> 02:29:38,560
same as with the tic tac thinking
 

10025
02:29:38,560 --> 02:29:41,190
same as with the tic tac thinking
outside the box is not

10026
02:29:41,190 --> 02:29:41,200
outside the box is not
 

10027
02:29:41,200 --> 02:29:44,230
outside the box is not
is uh not accepted and it probably

10028
02:29:44,230 --> 02:29:44,240
is uh not accepted and it probably
 

10029
02:29:44,240 --> 02:29:44,790
is uh not accepted and it probably
should be

10030
02:29:44,790 --> 02:29:44,800
should be
 

10031
02:29:44,800 --> 02:29:47,110
should be
but it's hard because if you go back go

10032
02:29:47,110 --> 02:29:47,120
but it's hard because if you go back go
 

10033
02:29:47,120 --> 02:29:48,309
but it's hard because if you go back go
back to einstein

10034
02:29:48,309 --> 02:29:48,319
back to einstein
 

10035
02:29:48,319 --> 02:29:51,750
back to einstein
back to the original he was the he was

10036
02:29:51,750 --> 02:29:51,760
back to the original he was the he was
 

10037
02:29:51,760 --> 02:29:52,710
back to the original he was the he was
out of the box

10038
02:29:52,710 --> 02:29:52,720
out of the box
 

10039
02:29:52,720 --> 02:29:54,150
out of the box
yeah he did not think that the true

10040
02:29:54,150 --> 02:29:54,160
yeah he did not think that the true
 

10041
02:29:54,160 --> 02:29:55,750
yeah he did not think that the true
jesus had he not

10042
02:29:55,750 --> 02:29:55,760
jesus had he not
 

10043
02:29:55,760 --> 02:29:57,349
jesus had he not
thought out of the box and came up with

10044
02:29:57,349 --> 02:29:57,359
thought out of the box and came up with
 

10045
02:29:57,359 --> 02:30:01,030
thought out of the box and came up with
some of his theories where would we be

10046
02:30:01,030 --> 02:30:01,040
some of his theories where would we be
 

10047
02:30:01,040 --> 02:30:02,870
some of his theories where would we be
okay we're jumping around a little bit

10048
02:30:02,870 --> 02:30:02,880
okay we're jumping around a little bit
 

10049
02:30:02,880 --> 02:30:04,790
okay we're jumping around a little bit
so we talked a little bit about elon

10050
02:30:04,790 --> 02:30:04,800
so we talked a little bit about elon
 

10051
02:30:04,800 --> 02:30:08,309
so we talked a little bit about elon
and mars and space but let's uh

10052

i have to kind of bring up some
 

10059
02:30:13,280 --> 02:30:15,429
i have to kind of bring up some
debunking stuff because i think

10060
02:30:15,429 --> 02:30:15,439
debunking stuff because i think
 

10061
02:30:15,439 --> 02:30:17,750
debunking stuff because i think
not the actual idea not the actual facts

10062
02:30:17,750 --> 02:30:17,760
not the actual idea not the actual facts
 

10063
02:30:17,760 --> 02:30:19,110
not the actual idea not the actual facts
of the debunking

10064
02:30:19,110 --> 02:30:19,120
of the debunking
 

10065
02:30:19,120 --> 02:30:22,389
of the debunking
but the nature of the true believers

10066
02:30:22,389 --> 02:30:22,399
but the nature of the true believers
 

10067
02:30:22,399 --> 02:30:24,230
but the nature of the true believers
versus the debunkers

10068
02:30:24,230 --> 02:30:24,240
versus the debunkers
 

10069
02:30:24,240 --> 02:30:25,910
versus the debunkers
hurts my heart a little bit because

10070
02:30:25,910 --> 02:30:25,920
hurts my heart a little bit because
 

10071
02:30:25,920 --> 02:30:28,070
hurts my heart a little bit because

miscalculated
 

10137
02:31:33,520 --> 02:31:35,990
miscalculated
the size and the distance of the thing

10138
02:31:35,990 --> 02:31:36,000
the size and the distance of the thing
 

10139
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:37,670
the size and the distance of the thing
and so on when you were flying around

10140
02:31:37,670 --> 02:31:37,680
and so on when you were flying around
 

10141
02:31:37,680 --> 02:31:39,590
and so on when you were flying around
i don't fight that as uh i mean maybe

it right now sure
so because that comes up like how how

10148
02:31:44,150 --> 02:31:44,160
so because that comes up like how how
 

10149
02:31:44,160 --> 02:31:45,910
so because that comes up like how how
did you know it was about 40 feet long i

10150
02:31:45,910 --> 02:31:45,920
did you know it was about 40 feet long i
 

10151
02:31:45,920 --> 02:31:47,349
did you know it was about 40 feet long i
go

10152
02:31:47,349 --> 02:31:47,359
go
 

10153
02:31:47,359 --> 02:31:50,630
go
okay so 16 years flying against other

10154
02:31:50,630 --> 02:31:50,640
okay so 16 years flying against other
 

10155
02:31:50,640 --> 02:31:51,750
okay so 16 years flying against other
airplanes

10156
02:31:51,750 --> 02:31:51,760
airplanes
 

10157
02:31:51,760 --> 02:31:53,190
airplanes
know what stuff looks like you know i've

10158
02:31:53,190 --> 02:31:53,200
know what stuff looks like you know i've
 

10159
02:31:53,200 --> 02:31:55,510
know what stuff looks like you know i've
looked down on things so if i know i

10160
02:31:55,510 --> 02:31:55,520
looked down on things so if i know i
 

10161
02:31:55,520 --> 02:31:57,030
looked down on things so if i know i
know here's the known things i know when

10162
02:31:57,030 --> 02:31:57,040
know here's the known things i know when
 

10163
02:31:57,040 --> 02:31:59,030
know here's the known things i know when
we saw the tic tac i was at

10164
02:31:59,030 --> 02:31:59,040
we saw the tic tac i was at
 

10165
02:31:59,040 --> 02:32:01,990
we saw the tic tac i was at
20 000 feet pish right around there so

10166
02:32:01,990 --> 02:32:02,000
20 000 feet pish right around there so
 

10167
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:03,030
20 000 feet pish right around there so
when i look down

10168
02:32:03,030 --> 02:32:03,040
when i look down
 

10169
02:32:03,040 --> 02:32:04,469
when i look down
i know what a hornet looks like looking

10170
02:32:04,469 --> 02:32:04,479
i know what a hornet looks like looking
 

10171
02:32:04,479 --> 02:32:06,230
i know what a hornet looks like looking
down on him because i've done it for

10172
02:32:06,230 --> 02:32:06,240
down on him because i've done it for
 

10173
02:32:06,240 --> 02:32:08,230
down on him because i've done it for
all those years i mean i got a good idea

10174
02:32:08,230 --> 02:32:08,240
all those years i mean i got a good idea
 

10175
02:32:08,240 --> 02:32:09,510
all those years i mean i got a good idea
so that's that's why i said 40 feet

10176
02:32:09,510 --> 02:32:09,520
so that's that's why i said 40 feet
 

10177
02:32:09,520 --> 02:32:11,670
so that's that's why i said 40 feet
because it's about hornet size

10178
02:32:11,670 --> 02:32:11,680
because it's about hornet size
 

10179
02:32:11,680 --> 02:32:13,990
because it's about hornet size
so and as i go around you you get to the

10180
02:32:13,990 --> 02:32:14,000
so and as i go around you you get to the
 

10181
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:15,990
so and as i go around you you get to the
point where you have to be able to judge

10182
02:32:15,990 --> 02:32:16,000
point where you have to be able to judge
 

10183
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:19,190
point where you have to be able to judge
distance when we fly out of experience

10184
02:32:19,190 --> 02:32:19,200
distance when we fly out of experience
 

10185
02:32:19,200 --> 02:32:20,389
distance when we fly out of experience
and you can tell if something

10186
02:32:20,389 --> 02:32:20,399
and you can tell if something
 

10187
02:32:20,399 --> 02:32:24,150
and you can tell if something
small or big you know so i would argue

10188
02:32:24,150 --> 02:32:24,160
small or big you know so i would argue
 

10189
02:32:24,160 --> 02:32:25,030
small or big you know so i would argue
the fact of

10190
02:32:25,030 --> 02:32:25,040
the fact of
 

10191
02:32:25,040 --> 02:32:27,670
the fact of
you know peer experience there's you

10192
02:32:27,670 --> 02:32:27,680
you know peer experience there's you
 

10193
02:32:27,680 --> 02:32:28,630
you know peer experience there's you
know

10194
02:32:28,630 --> 02:32:28,640
know
 

10195
02:32:28,640 --> 02:32:30,389
know
professional observers which is what

10196
02:32:30,389 --> 02:32:30,399
professional observers which is what
 

10197
02:32:30,399 --> 02:32:32,469
professional observers which is what
we're actually trained to do

10198
02:32:32,469 --> 02:32:32,479
we're actually trained to do
 

10199
02:32:32,479 --> 02:32:35,670
we're actually trained to do
um and having done it for so long

10200
02:32:35,670 --> 02:32:35,680
um and having done it for so long
 

10201
02:32:35,680 --> 02:32:37,510
um and having done it for so long
no it was and everyone came back with

10202
02:32:37,510 --> 02:32:37,520
no it was and everyone came back with
 

10203
02:32:37,520 --> 02:32:38,630
no it was and everyone came back with
the same thing they're like yeah i was

10204
02:32:38,630 --> 02:32:38,640
the same thing they're like yeah i was
 

10205
02:32:38,640 --> 02:32:39,990
the same thing they're like yeah i was
about size of hornet

10206
02:32:39,990 --> 02:32:40,000

we are actually trained to do the

10228
02:33:06,309 --> 02:33:06,319
we are actually trained to do the
 

10229
02:33:06,319 --> 02:33:08,070
we are actually trained to do the
opposite of that especially when you

10230
02:33:08,070 --> 02:33:08,080
opposite of that especially when you
 

10231

instrument fly because
your brain and eyes can tell you one

10234
02:33:11,750 --> 02:33:11,760
your brain and eyes can tell you one
 

10235
02:33:11,760 --> 02:33:13,990
your brain and eyes can tell you one
thing but you got to trust your

10236
02:33:13,990 --> 02:33:14,000
thing but you got to trust your
 

10237
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:14,630

let's go back to landing at night so
 

10241
02:33:17,040 --> 02:33:19,110
let's go back to landing at night so
your

10242
02:33:19,110 --> 02:33:19,120
your
 

10243
02:33:19,120 --> 02:33:21,750
your
you're right i eyes that the runway and

10244
02:33:21,750 --> 02:33:21,760
you're right i eyes that the runway and
 

10245
02:33:21,760 --> 02:33:22,389
you're right i eyes that the runway and
your brain

10246
02:33:22,389 --> 02:33:22,399
your brain
 

10247
02:33:22,399 --> 02:33:24,469
your brain
assumes that the runway is fixed but you

10248
02:33:24,469 --> 02:33:24,479
assumes that the runway is fixed but you
 

10249
02:33:24,479 --> 02:33:25,510
assumes that the runway is fixed but you
know

10250
02:33:25,510 --> 02:33:25,520
know
 

10251
02:33:25,520 --> 02:33:27,270
know
that the runway is moving so if i try

10252
02:33:27,270 --> 02:33:27,280
that the runway is moving so if i try
 

10253
02:33:27,280 --> 02:33:30,070
that the runway is moving so if i try
and do stuff visually i would you die

10254
02:33:30,070 --> 02:33:30,080
and do stuff visually i would you die
 

10255
02:33:30,080 --> 02:33:31,110
and do stuff visually i would you die
every time

10256
02:33:31,110 --> 02:33:31,120
every time
 

10257
02:33:31,120 --> 02:33:32,630
every time
not every time but you die close to

10258
02:33:32,630 --> 02:33:32,640
not every time but you die close to
 

10259
02:33:32,640 --> 02:33:34,309
not every time but you die close to
every time trying to land on a boat

10260
02:33:34,309 --> 02:33:34,319
every time trying to land on a boat
 

10261
02:33:34,319 --> 02:33:36,150
every time trying to land on a boat
so we actually use instruments which are

10262
02:33:36,150 --> 02:33:36,160
so we actually use instruments which are
 

10263
02:33:36,160 --> 02:33:37,910
so we actually use instruments which are
counter to your brain so

10264
02:33:37,910 --> 02:33:37,920
counter to your brain so
 

10265
02:33:37,920 --> 02:33:39,110
counter to your brain so
and there's actually all kinds of things

10266
02:33:39,110 --> 02:33:39,120
and there's actually all kinds of things
 

10267
02:33:39,120 --> 02:33:40,950
and there's actually all kinds of things
that we go through in training

10268
02:33:40,950 --> 02:33:40,960
that we go through in training
 

10269
02:33:40,960 --> 02:33:42,710
that we go through in training
they have this thing i think they still

10270

they have this thing i think they still
 

10271
02:33:42,720 --> 02:33:45,110
they have this thing i think they still
use it it's called the msdd

10272
02:33:45,110 --> 02:33:45,120
use it it's called the msdd
 

10273

use it it's called the msdd
multi-spatial disorientation device

10274
02:33:48,150 --> 02:33:48,160
multi-spatial disorientation device
 

10275
02:33:48,160 --> 02:33:51,510
multi-spatial disorientation device
or the spin and puke it looks like a

carousel and you're in these little

10280
02:33:53,030 --> 02:33:53,040
carousel and you're in these little
 

10281
02:33:53,040 --> 02:33:54,630
carousel and you're in these little
modules and when you get out you think

10282
02:33:54,630 --> 02:33:54,640
modules and when you get out you think
 

10283
02:33:54,640 --> 02:33:56,710
modules and when you get out you think
the thing goes really fast and they can

10284
02:33:56,710 --> 02:33:56,720
the thing goes really fast and they can
 

10285
02:33:56,720 --> 02:33:58,230
the thing goes really fast and they can
you can make yourself think that i'm

10286
02:33:58,230 --> 02:33:58,240
you can make yourself think that i'm
 

10287
02:33:58,240 --> 02:34:00,150
you can make yourself think that i'm
descending or climbing but you're

10288
02:34:00,150 --> 02:34:00,160
descending or climbing but you're
 

10289
02:34:00,160 --> 02:34:01,830
descending or climbing but you're
actually only going around in circles at

actually only going around in circles at
a very slow rate as fast as a human can

10292
02:34:03,750 --> 02:34:03,760
a very slow rate as fast as a human can
 

10293
02:34:03,760 --> 02:34:05,349
a very slow rate as fast as a human can
talk but as they spin you around in a

and slow it down and speed it up your
 

10299
02:34:08,319 --> 02:34:10,230
and slow it down and speed it up your
body does this and you you know and then

10300
02:34:10,230 --> 02:34:10,240
body does this and you you know and then

visuals of showing you like they can

10304
02:34:12,230 --> 02:34:12,240
visuals of showing you like they can
 

10305
02:34:12,240 --> 02:34:14,309
visuals of showing you like they can
spin it sideways to the outside wall

10306
02:34:14,309 --> 02:34:14,319
spin it sideways to the outside wall
 

10307
02:34:14,319 --> 02:34:16,150
spin it sideways to the outside wall
but they can show like lines that are

10308
02:34:16,150 --> 02:34:16,160
but they can show like lines that are
 

10309
02:34:16,160 --> 02:34:17,349
but they can show like lines that are
they can make the line stand still

10310
02:34:17,349 --> 02:34:17,359
they can make the line stand still
 

10311
02:34:17,359 --> 02:34:18,469
they can make the line stand still
because they're moving the same velocity

10312
02:34:18,469 --> 02:34:18,479
because they're moving the same velocity
 

10313
02:34:18,479 --> 02:34:19,349
because they're moving the same velocity
they can move the other way and you'll

10314
02:34:19,349 --> 02:34:19,359
they can move the other way and you'll
 

10315
02:34:19,359 --> 02:34:20,469
they can move the other way and you'll
think you're screaming

you you do all that because it gives you
 

10323
02:34:25,040 --> 02:34:26,550
you you do all that because it gives you
a sense of the a

you know when i'm flying the airplane

10338
02:34:37,349 --> 02:34:37,359
you know when i'm flying the airplane
 

10339
02:34:37,359 --> 02:34:38,790
you know when i'm flying the airplane
even as i'm looking at the tic tac i've

10340

even as i'm looking at the tic tac i've
 

10341
02:34:38,800 --> 02:34:40,389
even as i'm looking at the tic tac i've
got a heads-up display that tells me

10342
02:34:40,389 --> 02:34:40,399
got a heads-up display that tells me
 

10343
02:34:40,399 --> 02:34:42,230
got a heads-up display that tells me
what my airplane's doing

what my airplane's doing
 

10345
02:34:42,240 --> 02:34:44,790
what my airplane's doing
so i've got i know what i'm doing i can

02:34:56,950 --> 02:34:56,960
you have to
 

10363
02:34:56,960 --> 02:34:58,550
you have to
you have like supervision so you're

10364
02:34:58,550 --> 02:34:58,560
you have like supervision so you're
 

10365
02:34:58,560 --> 02:35:00,150
you have like supervision so you're
combining what you're seeing

10366
02:35:00,150 --> 02:35:00,160
combining what you're seeing
 

10367
02:35:00,160 --> 02:35:02,070
combining what you're seeing
and adjusting what the sensors what

10368
02:35:02,070 --> 02:35:02,080
and adjusting what the sensors what
 

10369
02:35:02,080 --> 02:35:03,270
and adjusting what the sensors what
you're calling the instruments you're

10370
02:35:03,270 --> 02:35:03,280
you're calling the instruments you're
 

10371
02:35:03,280 --> 02:35:04,230
you're calling the instruments you're
giving you

10372
02:35:04,230 --> 02:35:04,240
giving you
 

10373
02:35:04,240 --> 02:35:06,710
giving you
and that that in turn is a loop that

10374
02:35:06,710 --> 02:35:06,720
and that that in turn is a loop that
 

10375
02:35:06,720 --> 02:35:07,510
and that that in turn is a loop that
adjusts

10376
02:35:07,510 --> 02:35:07,520
adjusts
 

10377
02:35:07,520 --> 02:35:10,309
adjusts
the perception system that like that

10378
02:35:10,309 --> 02:35:10,319
the perception system that like that
 

10379
02:35:10,319 --> 02:35:12,309
the perception system that like that
that adjusts your brain's interpretation

10380
02:35:12,309 --> 02:35:12,319
that adjusts your brain's interpretation
 

10381
02:35:12,319 --> 02:35:13,510
that adjusts your brain's interpretation
of what you're saying yeah you'd be

10382
02:35:13,510 --> 02:35:13,520
of what you're saying yeah you'd be
 

10383
02:35:13,520 --> 02:35:14,870
of what you're saying yeah you'd be
amazed at how good so here's

10384
02:35:14,870 --> 02:35:14,880
amazed at how good so here's
 

10385
02:35:14,880 --> 02:35:17,110
amazed at how good so here's
here's another example so if we go out

10386
02:35:17,110 --> 02:35:17,120
here's another example so if we go out
 

10387
02:35:17,120 --> 02:35:18,790
here's another example so if we go out
over the water so there's no land in

10388
02:35:18,790 --> 02:35:18,800
over the water so there's no land in
 

10389
02:35:18,800 --> 02:35:19,750
over the water so there's no land in
sight

10390
02:35:19,750 --> 02:35:19,760
sight
 

10391
02:35:19,760 --> 02:35:21,750
sight
and we're gonna fight so when we fight

10392
02:35:21,750 --> 02:35:21,760
and we're gonna fight so when we fight
 

10393
02:35:21,760 --> 02:35:22,950
and we're gonna fight so when we fight
you know two airplanes we're gonna

10394
02:35:22,950 --> 02:35:22,960
you know two airplanes we're gonna
 

10395
02:35:22,960 --> 02:35:26,790
you know two airplanes we're gonna
dog fight as an instructor

10396
02:35:26,790 --> 02:35:26,800
dog fight as an instructor
 

10397
02:35:26,800 --> 02:35:29,510
dog fight as an instructor
and i was for all most of my time you

10398
02:35:29,510 --> 02:35:29,520
and i was for all most of my time you
 

10399
02:35:29,520 --> 02:35:30,550
and i was for all most of my time you
have to come back and you have to

10400
02:35:30,550 --> 02:35:30,560
have to come back and you have to
 

10401
02:35:30,560 --> 02:35:32,389
have to come back and you have to
recreate it so we we call it drawing

10402
02:35:32,389 --> 02:35:32,399
recreate it so we we call it drawing
 

10403
02:35:32,399 --> 02:35:33,510
recreate it so we we call it drawing
arrows

10404
02:35:33,510 --> 02:35:33,520
arrows
 

10405
02:35:33,520 --> 02:35:37,110
arrows
so um you have to recreate that stuff

10406
02:35:37,110 --> 02:35:37,120
so um you have to recreate that stuff
 

10407
02:35:37,120 --> 02:35:39,349
so um you have to recreate that stuff
so you get pretty good at going you know

10408
02:35:39,349 --> 02:35:39,359
so you get pretty good at going you know
 

10409
02:35:39,359 --> 02:35:40,870
so you get pretty good at going you know
like i would take off and say all right

10410
02:35:40,870 --> 02:35:40,880
like i would take off and say all right
 

10411
02:35:40,880 --> 02:35:42,150
like i would take off and say all right
we're starting heading

10412
02:35:42,150 --> 02:35:42,160
we're starting heading
 

10413
02:35:42,160 --> 02:35:45,270
we're starting heading
due east uh and i know where the sun is

10414
02:35:45,270 --> 02:35:45,280
due east uh and i know where the sun is
 

10415
02:35:45,280 --> 02:35:45,830
due east uh and i know where the sun is
at

10416
02:35:45,830 --> 02:35:45,840
at
 

10417
02:35:45,840 --> 02:35:47,270
at
because in the short couple minutes

10418
02:35:47,270 --> 02:35:47,280
because in the short couple minutes
 

10419
02:35:47,280 --> 02:35:48,230
because in the short couple minutes
we're going to fight the sun's really

10420
02:35:48,230 --> 02:35:48,240
we're going to fight the sun's really
 

10421
02:35:48,240 --> 02:35:49,349
we're going to fight the sun's really
not going to move much it's going to be

10422
02:35:49,349 --> 02:35:49,359
not going to move much it's going to be
 

10423
02:35:49,359 --> 02:35:50,630
not going to move much it's going to be
an irrelevance so now i know that the

10424
02:35:50,630 --> 02:35:50,640
an irrelevance so now i know that the
 

10425
02:35:50,640 --> 02:35:50,950
an irrelevance so now i know that the
sun

10426
02:35:50,950 --> 02:35:50,960
sun
 

10427
02:35:50,960 --> 02:35:54,790
sun
is at you know let's just say 195

10428
02:35:54,790 --> 02:35:54,800
is at you know let's just say 195
 

10429
02:35:54,800 --> 02:35:56,150
is at you know let's just say 195
degrees

10430
02:35:56,150 --> 02:35:56,160
degrees
 

10431
02:35:56,160 --> 02:35:57,990
degrees
right so i'm starting going east and

10432
02:35:57,990 --> 02:35:58,000
right so i'm starting going east and
 

10433
02:35:58,000 --> 02:35:59,590
right so i'm starting going east and
it's actually be down off my right hand

10434
02:35:59,590 --> 02:35:59,600
it's actually be down off my right hand
 

10435
02:35:59,600 --> 02:36:00,550
it's actually be down off my right hand
side

10436
02:36:00,550 --> 02:36:00,560
side
 

10437
02:36:00,560 --> 02:36:01,910
side
so now i know as i'm fighting because in

10438
02:36:01,910 --> 02:36:01,920
so now i know as i'm fighting because in
 

10439
02:36:01,920 --> 02:36:03,030
so now i know as i'm fighting because in
the water you don't have any reference

10440
02:36:03,030 --> 02:36:03,040
the water you don't have any reference
 

10441
02:36:03,040 --> 02:36:04,630
the water you don't have any reference
like oh i passed land i passed like no

10442
02:36:04,630 --> 02:36:04,640
like oh i passed land i passed like no
 

10443
02:36:04,640 --> 02:36:05,830
like oh i passed land i passed like no
you don't and you can't use clouds

10444
02:36:05,830 --> 02:36:05,840
you don't and you can't use clouds
 

10445
02:36:05,840 --> 02:36:07,110
you don't and you can't use clouds
because clouds do move

10446
02:36:07,110 --> 02:36:07,120
because clouds do move
 

10447
02:36:07,120 --> 02:36:08,389
because clouds do move
but you got to come back because you go

10448
02:36:08,389 --> 02:36:08,399
but you got to come back because you go
 

10449
02:36:08,399 --> 02:36:09,990
but you got to come back because you go
here's where i started and then you when

10450
02:36:09,990 --> 02:36:10,000
here's where i started and then you when
 

10451
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:11,510
here's where i started and then you when
as soon as you end you go all right i

10452
02:36:11,510 --> 02:36:11,520
as soon as you end you go all right i
 

10453
02:36:11,520 --> 02:36:12,630
as soon as you end you go all right i
ended heading

10454
02:36:12,630 --> 02:36:12,640
ended heading
 

10455
02:36:12,640 --> 02:36:16,070
ended heading
355. and then you recreate the turns and

10456
02:36:16,070 --> 02:36:16,080
355. and then you recreate the turns and
 

10457
02:36:16,080 --> 02:36:17,910
355. and then you recreate the turns and
the amount of turns and use the sun

10458
02:36:17,910 --> 02:36:17,920
the amount of turns and use the sun
 

10459
02:36:17,920 --> 02:36:20,309
the amount of turns and use the sun
relative so you can create this entire

10460
02:36:20,309 --> 02:36:20,319
relative so you can create this entire
 

10461
02:36:20,319 --> 02:36:21,910
relative so you can create this entire
battle that went on with arrows so you

10462
02:36:21,910 --> 02:36:21,920
battle that went on with arrows so you
 

10463
02:36:21,920 --> 02:36:23,429
battle that went on with arrows so you
can come back and debrief the guy that

10464
02:36:23,429 --> 02:36:23,439
can come back and debrief the guy that
 

10465
02:36:23,439 --> 02:36:24,790
can come back and debrief the guy that
you were teaching

10466
02:36:24,790 --> 02:36:24,800
you were teaching
 

10467
02:36:24,800 --> 02:36:27,349
you were teaching
on exactly what happened and you get

10468
02:36:27,349 --> 02:36:27,359
on exactly what happened and you get
 

10469
02:36:27,359 --> 02:36:29,030
on exactly what happened and you get
really really good at that so when you

10470
02:36:29,030 --> 02:36:29,040
really really good at that so when you
 

10471
02:36:29,040 --> 02:36:30,469
really really good at that so when you
come up and go well dave how do you know

10472
02:36:30,469 --> 02:36:30,479
come up and go well dave how do you know
 

10473
02:36:30,479 --> 02:36:31,590
come up and go well dave how do you know
you were at six o'clock and he went

10474
02:36:31,590 --> 02:36:31,600
you were at six o'clock and he went
 

10475
02:36:31,600 --> 02:36:33,910
you were at six o'clock and he went
around and he came up here i go

10476
02:36:33,910 --> 02:36:33,920
around and he came up here i go
 

10477
02:36:33,920 --> 02:36:36,309
around and he came up here i go
because i'm trained to do all that and i

10478
02:36:36,309 --> 02:36:36,319
because i'm trained to do all that and i
 

10479
02:36:36,319 --> 02:36:37,429
because i'm trained to do all that and i
take all the notes

10480
02:36:37,429 --> 02:36:37,439
take all the notes
 

10481
02:36:37,439 --> 02:36:38,950
take all the notes
while i'm flying you can do it and but

10482
02:36:38,950 --> 02:36:38,960
while i'm flying you can do it and but
 

10483
02:36:38,960 --> 02:36:41,030
while i'm flying you can do it and but
usually it's you memorize it all

10484
02:36:41,030 --> 02:36:41,040
usually it's you memorize it all
 

10485
02:36:41,040 --> 02:36:42,550
usually it's you memorize it all
and you get done and then you re you as

10486
02:36:42,550 --> 02:36:42,560
and you get done and then you re you as
 

10487
02:36:42,560 --> 02:36:43,830
and you get done and then you re you as
soon as you're done you knock it off you

10488
02:36:43,830 --> 02:36:43,840
soon as you're done you knock it off you
 

10489
02:36:43,840 --> 02:36:44,790
soon as you're done you knock it off you
look at the other airplane you get set

10490
02:36:44,790 --> 02:36:44,800
look at the other airplane you get set
 

10491
02:36:44,800 --> 02:36:45,910
look at the other airplane you get set
and you start writing all your notes

10492
02:36:45,910 --> 02:36:45,920
and you start writing all your notes
 

10493
02:36:45,920 --> 02:36:46,230
and you start writing all your notes
down

10494
02:36:46,230 --> 02:36:46,240
down
 

10495
02:36:46,240 --> 02:36:48,550
down
yeah and you're writing it really fast

10496
02:36:48,550 --> 02:36:48,560
yeah and you're writing it really fast
 

10497
02:36:48,560 --> 02:36:49,750
yeah and you're writing it really fast
on your card you go out the stack of

10498
02:36:49,750 --> 02:36:49,760
on your card you go out the stack of
 

10499
02:36:49,760 --> 02:36:50,870
on your card you go out the stack of
cards and you stick a new one on your

10500
02:36:50,870 --> 02:36:50,880
cards and you stick a new one on your
 

10501
02:36:50,880 --> 02:36:51,990
cards and you stick a new one on your
knee board card so you're ready to go

10502
02:36:51,990 --> 02:36:52,000
knee board card so you're ready to go
 

10503
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:53,349
knee board card so you're ready to go
and here's the next setup

10504
02:36:53,349 --> 02:36:53,359
and here's the next setup
 

10505
02:36:53,359 --> 02:36:57,030
and here's the next setup
um it's kind of it's in some way

10506
02:36:57,030 --> 02:36:57,040
um it's kind of it's in some way
 

10507
02:36:57,040 --> 02:36:59,510
um it's kind of it's in some way
similar to what uh like at the at the

10508
02:36:59,510 --> 02:36:59,520
similar to what uh like at the at the
 

10509
02:36:59,520 --> 02:37:01,510
similar to what uh like at the at the
highest level chess players do

10510
02:37:01,510 --> 02:37:01,520
highest level chess players do
 

10511
02:37:01,520 --> 02:37:04,950
highest level chess players do
i mean you're i mean

10512
02:37:04,950 --> 02:37:04,960
i mean you're i mean
 

10513
02:37:04,960 --> 02:37:08,790
i mean you're i mean
they they they recap the games but the

10514
02:37:08,790 --> 02:37:08,800
they they they recap the games but the
 

10515
02:37:08,800 --> 02:37:11,030
they they they recap the games but the
the richness of the representation that

10516
02:37:11,030 --> 02:37:11,040
the richness of the representation that
 

10517
02:37:11,040 --> 02:37:11,910
the richness of the representation that
they use

10518
02:37:11,910 --> 02:37:11,920
they use
 

10519
02:37:11,920 --> 02:37:14,070
they use
and remembering like how the games

10520
02:37:14,070 --> 02:37:14,080
and remembering like how the games
 

10521
02:37:14,080 --> 02:37:15,030
and remembering like how the games
evolved

10522
02:37:15,030 --> 02:37:15,040
evolved
 

10523
02:37:15,040 --> 02:37:18,150
evolved
it's not like it's much richer than the

10524
02:37:18,150 --> 02:37:18,160
it's not like it's much richer than the
 

10525
02:37:18,160 --> 02:37:19,349
it's not like it's much richer than the
actual moves

10526
02:37:19,349 --> 02:37:19,359
actual moves
 

10527
02:37:19,359 --> 02:37:21,910
actual moves
it's like these a bunch of patterns that

10528
02:37:21,910 --> 02:37:21,920
it's like these a bunch of patterns that
 

10529
02:37:21,920 --> 02:37:23,590
it's like these a bunch of patterns that
are hard to put into words like

10530
02:37:23,590 --> 02:37:23,600
are hard to put into words like
 

10531
02:37:23,600 --> 02:37:26,950
are hard to put into words like
like all the richness of thinking

10532
02:37:26,950 --> 02:37:26,960
like all the richness of thinking
 

10533
02:37:26,960 --> 02:37:29,910
like all the richness of thinking
they have about the way the game evolved

10534
02:37:29,910 --> 02:37:29,920
they have about the way the game evolved
 

10535
02:37:29,920 --> 02:37:30,710
they have about the way the game evolved
it's more like

10536
02:37:30,710 --> 02:37:30,720
it's more like
 

10537
02:37:30,720 --> 02:37:33,030
it's more like
instinctual from years and years of

10538
02:37:33,030 --> 02:37:33,040
instinctual from years and years of
 

10539
02:37:33,040 --> 02:37:33,990
instinctual from years and years of
experience

10540
02:37:33,990 --> 02:37:34,000
experience
 

10541
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:35,670
experience
so they try to put it into words but

10542
02:37:35,670 --> 02:37:35,680
so they try to put it into words but
 

10543
02:37:35,680 --> 02:37:37,030
so they try to put it into words but
they really can't it's

10544
02:37:37,030 --> 02:37:37,040
they really can't it's
 

10545
02:37:37,040 --> 02:37:38,950
they really can't it's
it's just not i understand that it's

10546
02:37:38,950 --> 02:37:38,960
it's just not i understand that it's
 

10547
02:37:38,960 --> 02:37:40,150
it's just not i understand that it's
because for us

10548
02:37:40,150 --> 02:37:40,160
because for us
 

10549
02:37:40,160 --> 02:37:41,750
because for us
if we don't come back with anything then

10550
02:37:41,750 --> 02:37:41,760
if we don't come back with anything then
 

10551
02:37:41,760 --> 02:37:43,270
if we don't come back with anything then
there's no learning to be had right

10552
02:37:43,270 --> 02:37:43,280
there's no learning to be had right
 

10553
02:37:43,280 --> 02:37:44,630
there's no learning to be had right
because the whole thing is

10554
02:37:44,630 --> 02:37:44,640
because the whole thing is
 

10555
02:37:44,640 --> 02:37:46,469
because the whole thing is
the debrief when we get back and we talk

10556
02:37:46,469 --> 02:37:46,479
the debrief when we get back and we talk
 

10557
02:37:46,479 --> 02:37:47,670
the debrief when we get back and we talk
about that's really where the learning

10558
02:37:47,670 --> 02:37:47,680
about that's really where the learning
 

10559
02:37:47,680 --> 02:37:48,550
about that's really where the learning
is

10560
02:37:48,550 --> 02:37:48,560
is
 

10561
02:37:48,560 --> 02:37:49,990
is
um and it's the same thing if you want

10562
02:37:49,990 --> 02:37:50,000
um and it's the same thing if you want
 

10563
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:51,429
um and it's the same thing if you want
to go back to chess you know when you

10564
02:37:51,429 --> 02:37:51,439
to go back to chess you know when you

02:37:51,439 --> 02:37:52,389
to go back to chess you know when you
start off

10566

10569
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:55,190
you try and learn because you're
remembering what you're doing if you

10581
02:38:01,200 --> 02:38:02,070
beating people you're not learning
anything you're just learning that

10582
02:38:02,070 --> 02:38:02,080
anything you're just learning that

no it's a learning process and so over

10668
02:39:18,150 --> 02:39:18,160
no it's a learning process and so over
 

10669
02:39:18,160 --> 02:39:20,150
no it's a learning process and so over
all those years you've gotten good so

10670
02:39:20,150 --> 02:39:20,160
all those years you've gotten good so
 

10671
02:39:20,160 --> 02:39:23,349
all those years you've gotten good so
i mean so

10672
02:39:23,349 --> 02:39:23,359
i mean so
 

10673
02:39:23,359 --> 02:39:25,590
i mean so
what are the chances that your eyes

10674
02:39:25,590 --> 02:39:25,600
what are the chances that your eyes
 

10675
02:39:25,600 --> 02:39:26,950
what are the chances that your eyes
betrayed you

10676
02:39:26,950 --> 02:39:26,960
betrayed you
 

10677
02:39:26,960 --> 02:39:30,150
betrayed you
when you saw the tic-tac

10678
02:39:30,150 --> 02:39:30,160
when you saw the tic-tac
 

10679
02:39:30,160 --> 02:39:34,389
when you saw the tic-tac
low zero well i mean i'm not zero so

10680
02:39:34,389 --> 02:39:34,399
low zero well i mean i'm not zero so
 

10681
02:39:34,399 --> 02:39:37,750
low zero well i mean i'm not zero so
okay yeah i am 99.9

10682
02:39:37,750 --> 02:39:37,760
okay yeah i am 99.9
 

10683
02:39:37,760 --> 02:39:41,190
okay yeah i am 99.9
so 0.1 my eyes deceive me but remember

10684
02:39:41,190 --> 02:39:41,200
so 0.1 my eyes deceive me but remember
 

10685
02:39:41,200 --> 02:39:43,030
so 0.1 my eyes deceive me but remember
if it deceived me it had to deceive the

10686
02:39:43,030 --> 02:39:43,040
if it deceived me it had to deceive the
 

10687
02:39:43,040 --> 02:39:44,630
if it deceived me it had to deceive the
other four people so the percentage is

10688
02:39:44,630 --> 02:39:44,640
other four people so the percentage is
 

10689
02:39:44,640 --> 02:39:45,429
other four people so the percentage is
even lower

10690
02:39:45,429 --> 02:39:45,439
even lower
 

10691
02:39:45,439 --> 02:39:48,070
even lower
yeah okay well i i don't find that that

10692
02:39:48,070 --> 02:39:48,080
yeah okay well i i don't find that that
 

10693
02:39:48,080 --> 02:39:49,590
yeah okay well i i don't find that that
particular debunking case that you saw

10694
02:39:49,590 --> 02:39:49,600
particular debunking case that you saw
 

10695
02:39:49,600 --> 02:39:51,030
particular debunking case that you saw
but i'm glad you put it

10696
02:39:51,030 --> 02:39:51,040
but i'm glad you put it
 

10697
02:39:51,040 --> 02:39:54,790
but i'm glad you put it
you um you said those words out loud

10698
02:39:54,790 --> 02:39:54,800
you um you said those words out loud
 

10699
02:39:54,800 --> 02:39:57,349
you um you said those words out loud
so for me from my perspective uh coming

10700
02:39:57,349 --> 02:39:57,359
so for me from my perspective uh coming
 

10701
02:39:57,359 --> 02:39:59,670
so for me from my perspective uh coming
into this world and looking at it

10702
02:39:59,670 --> 02:39:59,680
into this world and looking at it
 

10703
02:39:59,680 --> 02:40:03,110
into this world and looking at it
i'm a little bit more skeptical uh so

10704
02:40:03,110 --> 02:40:03,120
i'm a little bit more skeptical uh so
 

10705
02:40:03,120 --> 02:40:04,070
i'm a little bit more skeptical uh so
your eye account

10706
02:40:04,070 --> 02:40:04,080
your eye account
 

10707
02:40:04,080 --> 02:40:05,910
your eye account
i think is the most fascinating story

10708
02:40:05,910 --> 02:40:05,920
i think is the most fascinating story
 

10709
02:40:05,920 --> 02:40:08,230
i think is the most fascinating story
and that uh

10710
02:40:08,230 --> 02:40:08,240
and that uh
 

10711
02:40:08,240 --> 02:40:11,110
and that uh
i think uh that's inspiring to me and

10712
02:40:11,110 --> 02:40:11,120
i think uh that's inspiring to me and
 

10713
02:40:11,120 --> 02:40:12,389
i think uh that's inspiring to me and
should be inspiring to a lot of

10714
02:40:12,389 --> 02:40:12,399
should be inspiring to a lot of
 

10715
02:40:12,399 --> 02:40:15,510
should be inspiring to a lot of
scientists out there

10716
02:40:15,510 --> 02:40:15,520

 

10717
02:40:15,520 --> 02:40:17,110

on so many levels just like we said on

10718
02:40:17,110 --> 02:40:17,120
on so many levels just like we said on
 

10719
02:40:17,120 --> 02:40:19,030
on so many levels just like we said on
the engineering level that maybe there's

10720
02:40:19,030 --> 02:40:19,040
the engineering level that maybe there's
 

10721
02:40:19,040 --> 02:40:19,990
the engineering level that maybe there's
propulsion systems

10722
02:40:19,990 --> 02:40:20,000
propulsion systems
 

10723
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:22,710
propulsion systems
we can actually build that can do some

10724
02:40:22,710 --> 02:40:22,720
we can actually build that can do some
 

10725
02:40:22,720 --> 02:40:23,429
we can actually build that can do some
crazy

10726
02:40:23,429 --> 02:40:23,439
crazy
 

10727
02:40:23,439 --> 02:40:26,950
crazy
amazing stuff so it's a at the very

10728
02:40:26,950 --> 02:40:26,960
amazing stuff so it's a at the very
 

10729
02:40:26,960 --> 02:40:28,150
amazing stuff so it's a at the very
least intriguing

10730
02:40:28,150 --> 02:40:28,160
least intriguing
 

10731
02:40:28,160 --> 02:40:30,389
least intriguing
and at the best inspiring i just want to

10732
02:40:30,389 --> 02:40:30,399
and at the best inspiring i just want to
 

10733
02:40:30,399 --> 02:40:31,429
and at the best inspiring i just want to
say that but

10734
02:40:31,429 --> 02:40:31,439
say that but
 

10735
02:40:31,439 --> 02:40:36,150
say that but
on the video side it's like

10736
02:40:36,150 --> 02:40:36,160
on the video side it's like
 

10737
02:40:36,160 --> 02:40:39,269
on the video side it's like
it's uh the videos

10738
02:40:39,269 --> 02:40:39,279
it's uh the videos
 

10739
02:40:39,279 --> 02:40:43,590
it's uh the videos
for the fleur video the go fast

10740
02:40:43,590 --> 02:40:43,600
for the fleur video the go fast
 

10741
02:40:43,600 --> 02:40:47,110
for the fleur video the go fast
and the gimbal video they are only

10742
02:40:47,110 --> 02:40:47,120
and the gimbal video they are only
 

10743
02:40:47,120 --> 02:40:50,309
and the gimbal video they are only
interesting to me to me

10744
02:40:50,309 --> 02:40:50,319
interesting to me to me
 

10745
02:40:50,319 --> 02:40:53,510
interesting to me to me
in the context of your story like

10746
02:40:53,510 --> 02:40:53,520
in the context of your story like
 

10747
02:40:53,520 --> 02:40:55,670
in the context of your story like
without that they're kind of low

10748
02:40:55,670 --> 02:40:55,680
without that they're kind of low
 

10749
02:40:55,680 --> 02:40:56,630
without that they're kind of low
resolution

10750
02:40:56,630 --> 02:40:56,640
resolution
 

10751
02:40:56,640 --> 02:40:59,750
resolution
it's like it it's easier to build a

10752
02:40:59,750 --> 02:40:59,760
it's like it it's easier to build a
 

10753
02:40:59,760 --> 02:41:00,550
it's like it it's easier to build a
debunking

10754
02:41:00,550 --> 02:41:00,560
debunking
 

10755
02:41:00,560 --> 02:41:03,429
debunking
story to be skeptical so it's just where

10756
02:41:03,429 --> 02:41:03,439
story to be skeptical so it's just where
 

10757
02:41:03,439 --> 02:41:04,790
story to be skeptical so it's just where
i'm coming from maybe you can convince

10758
02:41:04,790 --> 02:41:04,800
i'm coming from maybe you can convince
 

10759
02:41:04,800 --> 02:41:05,750
i'm coming from maybe you can convince
me otherwise

10760
02:41:05,750 --> 02:41:05,760
me otherwise
 

10761
02:41:05,760 --> 02:41:07,750
me otherwise
but so to bring up mick west one more

10762
02:41:07,750 --> 02:41:07,760
but so to bring up mick west one more
 

10763
02:41:07,760 --> 02:41:09,269
but so to bring up mick west one more
time

10764
02:41:09,269 --> 02:41:09,279
time
 

10765
02:41:09,279 --> 02:41:12,230
time
he looks at the flair video and he says

10766
02:41:12,230 --> 02:41:12,240
he looks at the flair video and he says
 

10767
02:41:12,240 --> 02:41:12,630
he looks at the flair video and he says
that

10768
02:41:12,630 --> 02:41:12,640
that
 

10769
02:41:12,640 --> 02:41:14,950
that
one of the most amazing video parts of

10770
02:41:14,950 --> 02:41:14,960
one of the most amazing video parts of
 

10771
02:41:14,960 --> 02:41:16,469
one of the most amazing video parts of
the flare video for people who haven't

10772
02:41:16,469 --> 02:41:16,479
the flare video for people who haven't
 

10773
02:41:16,479 --> 02:41:17,349
the flare video for people who haven't
seen it

10774
02:41:17,349 --> 02:41:17,359
seen it
 

10775
02:41:17,359 --> 02:41:21,110
seen it
is at the end of it uh the

10776
02:41:21,110 --> 02:41:21,120
is at the end of it uh the
 

10777
02:41:21,120 --> 02:41:24,950
is at the end of it uh the
the the tic-tac flies

10778
02:41:24,950 --> 02:41:24,960
the the tic-tac flies
 

10779
02:41:24,960 --> 02:41:27,750
the the tic-tac flies
or appears to fly very quickly to the

10780
02:41:27,750 --> 02:41:27,760
or appears to fly very quickly to the
 

10781
02:41:27,760 --> 02:41:28,710
or appears to fly very quickly to the
left

10782
02:41:28,710 --> 02:41:28,720
left
 

10783
02:41:28,720 --> 02:41:31,510
left
off the screen off the screen and what

10784
02:41:31,510 --> 02:41:31,520
off the screen off the screen and what
 

10785
02:41:31,520 --> 02:41:32,870
off the screen off the screen and what
midwest says

10786
02:41:32,870 --> 02:41:32,880
midwest says
 

10787
02:41:32,880 --> 02:41:36,630
midwest says
is uh that it you know midwest probably

10788
02:41:36,630 --> 02:41:36,640
is uh that it you know midwest probably
 

10789
02:41:36,640 --> 02:41:37,510
is uh that it you know midwest probably
others

10790
02:41:37,510 --> 02:41:37,520
others
 

10791
02:41:37,520 --> 02:41:40,550
others
that the way to explain that

10792
02:41:40,550 --> 02:41:40,560
that the way to explain that
 

10793
02:41:40,560 --> 02:41:43,510
that the way to explain that
is the tracking system like we said this

10794
02:41:43,510 --> 02:41:43,520
is the tracking system like we said this
 

10795
02:41:43,520 --> 02:41:45,110
is the tracking system like we said this
vision based tracking

10796
02:41:45,110 --> 02:41:45,120
vision based tracking
 

10797
02:41:45,120 --> 02:41:48,469
vision based tracking
simply loses the like the object

10798
02:41:48,469 --> 02:41:48,479
simply loses the like the object
 

10799
02:41:48,479 --> 02:41:51,590
simply loses the like the object
the tracking loses it and so

10800
02:41:51,590 --> 02:41:51,600
the tracking loses it and so
 

10801
02:41:51,600 --> 02:41:54,870
the tracking loses it and so
it simply allows the object to uh

10802
02:41:54,870 --> 02:41:54,880
it simply allows the object to uh
 

10803
02:41:54,880 --> 02:41:56,630
it simply allows the object to uh
float off screen because it's no longer

10804
02:41:56,630 --> 02:41:56,640
float off screen because it's no longer
 

10805
02:41:56,640 --> 02:41:59,190
float off screen because it's no longer
tracking it so

10806
02:41:59,190 --> 02:41:59,200
tracking it so
 

10807
02:41:59,200 --> 02:42:01,349
tracking it so
i find that at least a plausible

10808
02:42:01,349 --> 02:42:01,359
i find that at least a plausible
 

10809
02:42:01,359 --> 02:42:02,230
i find that at least a plausible
explanation

10810
02:42:02,230 --> 02:42:02,240
explanation
 

10811
02:42:02,240 --> 02:42:05,830
explanation
of that video looking at your face

10812
02:42:05,830 --> 02:42:05,840
of that video looking at your face
 

10813
02:42:05,840 --> 02:42:08,710
of that video looking at your face
you do not so can you maybe comment to

10814
02:42:08,710 --> 02:42:08,720
you do not so can you maybe comment to
 

10815
02:42:08,720 --> 02:42:09,190
you do not so can you maybe comment to
that

10816
02:42:09,190 --> 02:42:09,200
that
 

10817
02:42:09,200 --> 02:42:12,309
that
uh to that debunking uh sure

10818
02:42:12,309 --> 02:42:12,319
uh to that debunking uh sure
 

10819
02:42:12,319 --> 02:42:15,750
uh to that debunking uh sure
so um it's funny how people can

10820
02:42:15,750 --> 02:42:15,760
so um it's funny how people can
 

10821
02:42:15,760 --> 02:42:17,670
so um it's funny how people can
extrapolate stuff who've never operated

10822
02:42:17,670 --> 02:42:17,680
extrapolate stuff who've never operated
 

10823
02:42:17,680 --> 02:42:18,469
extrapolate stuff who've never operated
the system no

10824
02:42:18,469 --> 02:42:18,479
the system no
 

10825
02:42:18,479 --> 02:42:20,630
the system no
for sure and that's like me going

10826
02:42:20,630 --> 02:42:20,640
for sure and that's like me going
 

10827
02:42:20,640 --> 02:42:22,469
for sure and that's like me going
because i'm a big formula one fan

10828
02:42:22,469 --> 02:42:22,479
because i'm a big formula one fan
 

10829
02:42:22,479 --> 02:42:24,469
because i'm a big formula one fan
you know that's like me going oh my god

10830
02:42:24,469 --> 02:42:24,479
you know that's like me going oh my god
 

10831
02:42:24,479 --> 02:42:25,830
you know that's like me going oh my god
louis what were you doing you could have

10832
02:42:25,830 --> 02:42:25,840
louis what were you doing you could have
 

10833
02:42:25,840 --> 02:42:26,870
louis what were you doing you could have
done this with the car and you need to

10834
02:42:26,870 --> 02:42:26,880
done this with the car and you need to
 

10835
02:42:26,880 --> 02:42:28,230
done this with the car and you need to
won the race right you know and lewis

10836
02:42:28,230 --> 02:42:28,240
won the race right you know and lewis
 

10837
02:42:28,240 --> 02:42:29,190
won the race right you know and lewis
hamilton right now is

10838
02:42:29,190 --> 02:42:29,200
hamilton right now is
 

10839
02:42:29,200 --> 02:42:30,630
hamilton right now is
you know defending world champion two

10840
02:42:30,630 --> 02:42:30,640
you know defending world champion two
 

10841
02:42:30,640 --> 02:42:32,389
you know defending world champion two
time he's four-time four-five-time world

10842
02:42:32,389 --> 02:42:32,399
time he's four-time four-five-time world
 

10843
02:42:32,399 --> 02:42:33,429
time he's four-time four-five-time world
champion but

10844
02:42:33,429 --> 02:42:33,439
champion but
 

10845
02:42:33,439 --> 02:42:35,670
champion but
um that would be pretty stupid to me to

10846
02:42:35,670 --> 02:42:35,680
um that would be pretty stupid to me to
 

10847
02:42:35,680 --> 02:42:37,269
um that would be pretty stupid to me to
try and tell lewis hamilton how to drive

10848
02:42:37,269 --> 02:42:37,279
try and tell lewis hamilton how to drive
 

10849
02:42:37,279 --> 02:42:37,830
try and tell lewis hamilton how to drive
a car

10850
02:42:37,830 --> 02:42:37,840
a car
 

10851
02:42:37,840 --> 02:42:40,870
a car
yeah um or a matter of fact

10852
02:42:40,870 --> 02:42:40,880
yeah um or a matter of fact
 

10853
02:42:40,880 --> 02:42:43,750
yeah um or a matter of fact
anyone driving a formula one car so i i

10854
02:42:43,750 --> 02:42:43,760
anyone driving a formula one car so i i
 

10855
02:42:43,760 --> 02:42:44,710
anyone driving a formula one car so i i
can't tell you how many times i've

10856
02:42:44,710 --> 02:42:44,720
can't tell you how many times i've
 

10857
02:42:44,720 --> 02:42:45,830
can't tell you how many times i've
watched you gotta remember when we

10858
02:42:45,830 --> 02:42:45,840
watched you gotta remember when we
 

10859
02:42:45,840 --> 02:42:47,269
watched you gotta remember when we
looked at this thing

10860
02:42:47,269 --> 02:42:47,279
looked at this thing
 

10861
02:42:47,279 --> 02:42:48,950
looked at this thing
when when chad came back with the video

10862
02:42:48,950 --> 02:42:48,960
when when chad came back with the video
 

10863
02:42:48,960 --> 02:42:50,309
when when chad came back with the video
we sat there and watched it i mean i

10864
02:42:50,309 --> 02:42:50,319
we sat there and watched it i mean i
 

10865
02:42:50,319 --> 02:42:51,190
we sat there and watched it i mean i
can't tell you how many times i've

10866
02:42:51,190 --> 02:42:51,200
can't tell you how many times i've
 

10867
02:42:51,200 --> 02:42:52,710
can't tell you how many times i've
watched it off the original tapes going

10868
02:42:52,710 --> 02:42:52,720
watched it off the original tapes going
 

10869
02:42:52,720 --> 02:42:54,230
watched it off the original tapes going
all right right all right let's look at

10870
02:42:54,230 --> 02:42:54,240
all right right all right let's look at
 

10871
02:42:54,240 --> 02:42:55,110
all right right all right let's look at
this

10872
02:42:55,110 --> 02:42:55,120
this
 

10873
02:42:55,120 --> 02:42:57,110
this
um you know because you can look and see

10874
02:42:57,110 --> 02:42:57,120
um you know because you can look and see
 

10875
02:42:57,120 --> 02:42:58,710
um you know because you can look and see
where the you can see where the airplane

10876
02:42:58,710 --> 02:42:58,720
where the you can see where the airplane
 

10877
02:42:58,720 --> 02:42:59,990
where the you can see where the airplane
is going you can see if it's looking

10878
02:42:59,990 --> 02:43:00,000
is going you can see if it's looking
 

10879
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:01,429
is going you can see if it's looking
left or right and if you actually watch

10880
02:43:01,429 --> 02:43:01,439
left or right and if you actually watch
 

10881
02:43:01,439 --> 02:43:02,630
left or right and if you actually watch
all that stuff it doesn't do that it

10882
02:43:02,630 --> 02:43:02,640
all that stuff it doesn't do that it
 

10883
02:43:02,640 --> 02:43:03,190
all that stuff it doesn't do that it
actually

10884
02:43:03,190 --> 02:43:03,200
actually
 

10885
02:43:03,200 --> 02:43:05,590
actually
when the vehicle starts to move the bars

10886
02:43:05,590 --> 02:43:05,600
when the vehicle starts to move the bars
 

10887
02:43:05,600 --> 02:43:07,349
when the vehicle starts to move the bars
the tracking gate starts to open up and

10888
02:43:07,349 --> 02:43:07,359
the tracking gate starts to open up and
 

10889
02:43:07,359 --> 02:43:08,630
the tracking gate starts to open up and
the people at raytheon could probably

10890
02:43:08,630 --> 02:43:08,640
the people at raytheon could probably
 

10891
02:43:08,640 --> 02:43:10,790
the people at raytheon could probably
add to this because they built the pod

10892
02:43:10,790 --> 02:43:10,800
add to this because they built the pod
 

10893
02:43:10,800 --> 02:43:12,710
add to this because they built the pod
the tracking gate will start to open up

10894
02:43:12,710 --> 02:43:12,720
the tracking gate will start to open up
 

10895
02:43:12,720 --> 02:43:14,309
the tracking gate will start to open up
and and but the thing

10896
02:43:14,309 --> 02:43:14,319
and and but the thing
 

10897
02:43:14,319 --> 02:43:15,990
and and but the thing
when it leaves so fast off the screen

10898
02:43:15,990 --> 02:43:16,000
when it leaves so fast off the screen
 

10899
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:17,590
when it leaves so fast off the screen
the pod can't move fast enough it has

10900
02:43:17,590 --> 02:43:17,600
the pod can't move fast enough it has
 

10901
02:43:17,600 --> 02:43:19,269
the pod can't move fast enough it has
gimbal rates on how fast that thing can

10902
02:43:19,269 --> 02:43:19,279
gimbal rates on how fast that thing can
 

10903
02:43:19,279 --> 02:43:20,309
gimbal rates on how fast that thing can
move around because there's another

10904
02:43:20,309 --> 02:43:20,319
move around because there's another
 

10905
02:43:20,319 --> 02:43:21,269
move around because there's another
theory that

10906
02:43:21,269 --> 02:43:21,279
theory that
 

10907
02:43:21,279 --> 02:43:23,269
theory that
oh with the pods looking forward when

10908
02:43:23,269 --> 02:43:23,279
oh with the pods looking forward when
 

10909
02:43:23,279 --> 02:43:24,710
oh with the pods looking forward when
the pod passes underneath the airplane

10910
02:43:24,710 --> 02:43:24,720
the pod passes underneath the airplane
 

10911
02:43:24,720 --> 02:43:25,990
the pod passes underneath the airplane
so if i'm looking at you and you pass

10912
02:43:25,990 --> 02:43:26,000
so if i'm looking at you and you pass
 

10913
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:26,790
so if i'm looking at you and you pass
underneath me as

10914
02:43:26,790 --> 02:43:26,800
underneath me as
 

10915
02:43:26,800 --> 02:43:28,309
underneath me as
does this the ball will actually flip

10916
02:43:28,309 --> 02:43:28,319
does this the ball will actually flip
 

10917
02:43:28,319 --> 02:43:30,230
does this the ball will actually flip
around to kind of finish off

10918
02:43:30,230 --> 02:43:30,240
around to kind of finish off
 

10919
02:43:30,240 --> 02:43:32,790
around to kind of finish off
and it'll it'll it swaps ends because it

10920
02:43:32,790 --> 02:43:32,800
and it'll it'll it swaps ends because it
 

10921
02:43:32,800 --> 02:43:33,990
and it'll it'll it swaps ends because it
has you know it's a gimbal

10922
02:43:33,990 --> 02:43:34,000
has you know it's a gimbal
 

10923
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:37,750
has you know it's a gimbal
it can't just it's not free-floating um

10924
02:43:37,750 --> 02:43:37,760
it can't just it's not free-floating um
 

10925
02:43:37,760 --> 02:43:39,110
it can't just it's not free-floating um
but there's a theory on one of them oh

10926
02:43:39,110 --> 02:43:39,120
but there's a theory on one of them oh
 

10927
02:43:39,120 --> 02:43:40,150
but there's a theory on one of them oh
it's here and it flipped over it doesn't

10928
02:43:40,150 --> 02:43:40,160
it's here and it flipped over it doesn't
 

10929
02:43:40,160 --> 02:43:41,510
it's here and it flipped over it doesn't
do that when it's looking out in front

10930
02:43:41,510 --> 02:43:41,520
do that when it's looking out in front
 

10931
02:43:41,520 --> 02:43:42,870
do that when it's looking out in front
it stays like this

10932
02:43:42,870 --> 02:43:42,880
it stays like this
 

10933
02:43:42,880 --> 02:43:45,110
it stays like this
so that yet another another debunker who

10934
02:43:45,110 --> 02:43:45,120
so that yet another another debunker who
 

10935
02:43:45,120 --> 02:43:46,389
so that yet another another debunker who
doesn't know this so

10936
02:43:46,389 --> 02:43:46,399
doesn't know this so
 

10937
02:43:46,399 --> 02:43:47,910
doesn't know this so
you know and mick has had several

10938
02:43:47,910 --> 02:43:47,920
you know and mick has had several
 

10939
02:43:47,920 --> 02:43:49,910
you know and mick has had several
theories on other of some of the other

10940
02:43:49,910 --> 02:43:49,920
theories on other of some of the other
 

10941
02:43:49,920 --> 02:43:51,750
theories on other of some of the other
videos like one of them the go fast as a

10942
02:43:51,750 --> 02:43:51,760
videos like one of them the go fast as a
 

10943
02:43:51,760 --> 02:43:52,710
videos like one of them the go fast as a
bird

10944
02:43:52,710 --> 02:43:52,720
bird
 

10945
02:43:52,720 --> 02:43:54,469
bird
and jeremy corbell actually did a nice

10946
02:43:54,469 --> 02:43:54,479
and jeremy corbell actually did a nice
 

10947
02:43:54,479 --> 02:43:57,110
and jeremy corbell actually did a nice
job of saying no it's not because

10948
02:43:57,110 --> 02:43:57,120
job of saying no it's not because
 

10949
02:43:57,120 --> 02:43:59,269
job of saying no it's not because
he's on he's on black hot so the the

10950
02:43:59,269 --> 02:43:59,279
he's on he's on black hot so the the
 

10951
02:43:59,279 --> 02:44:00,710
he's on he's on black hot so the the
white object is actually colder than the

10952
02:44:00,710 --> 02:44:00,720
white object is actually colder than the
 

10953
02:44:00,720 --> 02:44:02,230
white object is actually colder than the
ocean

10954
02:44:02,230 --> 02:44:02,240
ocean
 

10955
02:44:02,240 --> 02:44:03,750
ocean
that's flying well birds aren't colder

10956
02:44:03,750 --> 02:44:03,760
that's flying well birds aren't colder
 

10957
02:44:03,760 --> 02:44:05,590
that's flying well birds aren't colder
than the ocean they'd be dead

10958
02:44:05,590 --> 02:44:05,600
than the ocean they'd be dead
 

10959
02:44:05,600 --> 02:44:09,030
than the ocean they'd be dead
so the gimbal video to comment on

10960
02:44:09,030 --> 02:44:09,040
so the gimbal video to comment on
 

10961
02:44:09,040 --> 02:44:12,309
so the gimbal video to comment on
the amazing aspect of that video is the

10962
02:44:12,309 --> 02:44:12,319
the amazing aspect of that video is the
 

10963
02:44:12,319 --> 02:44:14,550
the amazing aspect of that video is the
rotation the apparent rotation of the

10964
02:44:14,550 --> 02:44:14,560
rotation the apparent rotation of the
 

10965
02:44:14,560 --> 02:44:15,670
rotation the apparent rotation of the

02:44:18,800 --> 02:44:21,670
is something that is not
possible to do with systems that we know

10974
02:44:25,750 --> 02:44:25,760
and make west suggests that uh

or whatever can explain no because what
 

10979
02:44:31,680 --> 02:44:33,510
or whatever can explain no because what

video the game both of them
the go fast and the gimbal were shot by

10998
02:44:49,190 --> 02:44:49,200
the go fast and the gimbal were shot by
 

10999
02:44:49,200 --> 02:44:51,190
the go fast and the gimbal were shot by
the same person okay

11000
02:44:51,190 --> 02:44:51,200
the same person okay
 

11001
02:44:51,200 --> 02:44:53,510
the same person okay
so uh and they were in each other's

11002
02:44:53,510 --> 02:44:53,520
so uh and they were in each other's
 

11003

wedding so that's how well they know
 

11005
02:44:54,720 --> 02:44:55,349
wedding so that's how well they know
each other

11006
02:44:55,349 --> 02:44:55,359
each other
 

11007
02:44:55,359 --> 02:44:58,469
each other
okay so what you don't see is

11008
02:44:58,469 --> 02:44:58,479
okay so what you don't see is
 

11009
02:44:58,479 --> 02:45:00,710
okay so what you don't see is
so the airplanes that are flying still

11010
02:45:00,710 --> 02:45:00,720
so the airplanes that are flying still
 

11011
02:45:00,720 --> 02:45:02,790
so the airplanes that are flying still
super hornets but they have the apg-79

11012
02:45:02,790 --> 02:45:02,800
super hornets but they have the apg-79
 

11013
02:45:02,800 --> 02:45:03,750
super hornets but they have the apg-79
which is the new

11014
02:45:03,750 --> 02:45:03,760
which is the new
 

11015
02:45:03,760 --> 02:45:05,030
which is the new
phased array radar that's made by

11016
02:45:05,030 --> 02:45:05,040
phased array radar that's made by
 

11017
02:45:05,040 --> 02:45:08,230
phased array radar that's made by
raytheon things incredible okay

11018
02:45:08,230 --> 02:45:08,240
raytheon things incredible okay
 

11019
02:45:08,240 --> 02:45:09,830
raytheon things incredible okay
it doesn't usually if it's if it's out

11020
02:45:09,830 --> 02:45:09,840
it doesn't usually if it's if it's out
 

11021
02:45:09,840 --> 02:45:11,269
it doesn't usually if it's if it's out
there and it sees it it's real

11022
02:45:11,269 --> 02:45:11,279
there and it sees it it's real
 

11023
02:45:11,279 --> 02:45:12,630
there and it sees it it's real
so at first they thought they were ghost

11024
02:45:12,630 --> 02:45:12,640
so at first they thought they were ghost
 

11025
02:45:12,640 --> 02:45:13,750
so at first they thought they were ghost
tracks when they started seeing stuff

11026
02:45:13,750 --> 02:45:13,760
tracks when they started seeing stuff
 

11027
02:45:13,760 --> 02:45:14,870
tracks when they started seeing stuff
and then they actually threw one of the

11028
02:45:14,870 --> 02:45:14,880
and then they actually threw one of the
 

11029
02:45:14,880 --> 02:45:16,070
and then they actually threw one of the
targeting pods out there

11030
02:45:16,070 --> 02:45:16,080
targeting pods out there
 

11031
02:45:16,080 --> 02:45:17,269
targeting pods out there
well the targeting pod there's a heat

11032
02:45:17,269 --> 02:45:17,279
well the targeting pod there's a heat
 

11033
02:45:17,279 --> 02:45:18,630
well the targeting pod there's a heat
signature and you go hey dot heat

11034
02:45:18,630 --> 02:45:18,640
signature and you go hey dot heat
 

11035
02:45:18,640 --> 02:45:19,750
signature and you go hey dot heat
signature something's there

11036
02:45:19,750 --> 02:45:19,760
signature something's there
 

11037
02:45:19,760 --> 02:45:21,750
signature something's there
it's real it's not you're not picking up

11038
02:45:21,750 --> 02:45:21,760
it's real it's not you're not picking up
 

11039
02:45:21,760 --> 02:45:23,349
it's real it's not you're not picking up
some extraneous things so

11040
02:45:23,349 --> 02:45:23,359
some extraneous things so
 

11041
02:45:23,359 --> 02:45:25,510
some extraneous things so
what you see in the gimbal video of the

11042
02:45:25,510 --> 02:45:25,520
what you see in the gimbal video of the
 

11043
02:45:25,520 --> 02:45:27,030
what you see in the gimbal video of the
thing and it rotates and you go holy

11044
02:45:27,030 --> 02:45:27,040
thing and it rotates and you go holy
 

11045
02:45:27,040 --> 02:45:27,910
thing and it rotates and you go holy
[\h__\h] look at that thing it's just

11046
02:45:27,910 --> 02:45:27,920
[\h__\h] look at that thing it's just
 

11047
02:45:27,920 --> 02:45:29,110
[\h__\h] look at that thing it's just
sitting there and it's in the wind and

11048
02:45:29,110 --> 02:45:29,120
sitting there and it's in the wind and
 

11049
02:45:29,120 --> 02:45:30,630
sitting there and it's in the wind and
it's going against the wind

11050
02:45:30,630 --> 02:45:30,640
it's going against the wind
 

11051
02:45:30,640 --> 02:45:32,710
it's going against the wind
why it's doing this you know someone

11052
02:45:32,710 --> 02:45:32,720
why it's doing this you know someone
 

11053
02:45:32,720 --> 02:45:33,830
why it's doing this you know someone
goes oh it's an airplane now if an

11054
02:45:33,830 --> 02:45:33,840
goes oh it's an airplane now if an
 

11055
02:45:33,840 --> 02:45:35,190
goes oh it's an airplane now if an
airplane does this it's eventually going

11056
02:45:35,190 --> 02:45:35,200
airplane does this it's eventually going
 

11057
02:45:35,200 --> 02:45:36,469
airplane does this it's eventually going
to start to change aspect because it's

11058
02:45:36,469 --> 02:45:36,479
to start to change aspect because it's
 

11059
02:45:36,479 --> 02:45:37,190
to start to change aspect because it's
in a turn

11060
02:45:37,190 --> 02:45:37,200
in a turn
 

11061
02:45:37,200 --> 02:45:38,550
in a turn
this thing doesn't change aspect it just

11062
02:45:38,550 --> 02:45:38,560
this thing doesn't change aspect it just
 

11063
02:45:38,560 --> 02:45:40,389
this thing doesn't change aspect it just
rotates right

11064
02:45:40,389 --> 02:45:40,399
rotates right
 

11065
02:45:40,399 --> 02:45:41,990
rotates right
the other thing that you see when you

11066
02:45:41,990 --> 02:45:42,000
the other thing that you see when you
 

11067
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:43,910
the other thing that you see when you
talk to them is so they're on their

11068
02:45:43,910 --> 02:45:43,920
talk to them is so they're on their
 

11069
02:45:43,920 --> 02:45:44,550
talk to them is so they're on their
radar

11070
02:45:44,550 --> 02:45:44,560
radar
 

11071
02:45:44,560 --> 02:45:47,670
radar
there's an object that they identify

11072
02:45:47,670 --> 02:45:47,680
there's an object that they identify
 

11073
02:45:47,680 --> 02:45:49,750
there's an object that they identify
as their number one priority or their

11074
02:45:49,750 --> 02:45:49,760
as their number one priority or their
 

11075
02:45:49,760 --> 02:45:51,590
as their number one priority or their
launch and steering

11076
02:45:51,590 --> 02:45:51,600
launch and steering
 

11077
02:45:51,600 --> 02:45:53,030
launch and steering
so when they designate that that's where

11078
02:45:53,030 --> 02:45:53,040
so when they designate that that's where
 

11079
02:45:53,040 --> 02:45:54,309
so when they designate that that's where
the targeting pod is going to look

11080
02:45:54,309 --> 02:45:54,319
the targeting pod is going to look
 

11081
02:45:54,319 --> 02:45:56,230
the targeting pod is going to look
that's what you get in the gimbal video

11082
02:45:56,230 --> 02:45:56,240
that's what you get in the gimbal video
 

11083
02:45:56,240 --> 02:45:58,150
that's what you get in the gimbal video
there's five other i think it's five

11084
02:45:58,150 --> 02:45:58,160
there's five other i think it's five
 

11085
02:45:58,160 --> 02:45:59,830
there's five other i think it's five
they're kind of in a v you know like a

11086
02:45:59,830 --> 02:45:59,840
they're kind of in a v you know like a
 

11087
02:45:59,840 --> 02:46:00,950
they're kind of in a v you know like a
geese would fly

11088
02:46:00,950 --> 02:46:00,960
geese would fly
 

11089
02:46:00,960 --> 02:46:02,150
geese would fly
that are out in front of it and they're

11090
02:46:02,150 --> 02:46:02,160
that are out in front of it and they're
 

11091
02:46:02,160 --> 02:46:03,910
that are out in front of it and they're
actually coming they're out in front of

11092
02:46:03,910 --> 02:46:03,920
actually coming they're out in front of
 

11093
02:46:03,920 --> 02:46:05,110
actually coming they're out in front of
it and they actually turn

11094
02:46:05,110 --> 02:46:05,120
it and they actually turn
 

11095
02:46:05,120 --> 02:46:06,630
it and they actually turn
on the radar and go the other way while

11096
02:46:06,630 --> 02:46:06,640
on the radar and go the other way while
 

11097
02:46:06,640 --> 02:46:09,590
on the radar and go the other way while
they're filming the gimbal video

11098
02:46:09,590 --> 02:46:09,600
they're filming the gimbal video
 

11099
02:46:09,600 --> 02:46:12,630
they're filming the gimbal video
which it's i know uh ryan has come out

11100
02:46:12,630 --> 02:46:12,640
which it's i know uh ryan has come out
 

11101
02:46:12,640 --> 02:46:14,389
which it's i know uh ryan has come out
and talked about it

11102
02:46:14,389 --> 02:46:14,399
and talked about it
 

11103
02:46:14,399 --> 02:46:17,510
and talked about it
but when you see it you go you know if

11104
02:46:17,510 --> 02:46:17,520
but when you see it you go you know if
 

11105
02:46:17,520 --> 02:46:19,110
but when you see it you go you know if
you take it in context because you go oh

11106
02:46:19,110 --> 02:46:19,120
you take it in context because you go oh
 

11107
02:46:19,120 --> 02:46:20,389
you take it in context because you go oh
it's just the video

11108
02:46:20,389 --> 02:46:20,399
it's just the video
 

11109
02:46:20,399 --> 02:46:21,510
it's just the video
well if you take the video with the

11110
02:46:21,510 --> 02:46:21,520
well if you take the video with the
 

11111
02:46:21,520 --> 02:46:22,790
well if you take the video with the
radar going no there's actually other

11112
02:46:22,790 --> 02:46:22,800
radar going no there's actually other
 

11113
02:46:22,800 --> 02:46:23,990
radar going no there's actually other
things out there because

11114
02:46:23,990 --> 02:46:24,000
things out there because
 

11115
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:25,990
things out there because
there's at least 60 people that have

11116
02:46:25,990 --> 02:46:26,000
there's at least 60 people that have
 

11117
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:27,750
there's at least 60 people that have
seen these things on radar

11118
02:46:27,750 --> 02:46:27,760
seen these things on radar
 

11119
02:46:27,760 --> 02:46:29,670
seen these things on radar
off the vacates it was it actually

11120
02:46:29,670 --> 02:46:29,680
off the vacates it was it actually
 

11121
02:46:29,680 --> 02:46:31,110
off the vacates it was it actually
became

11122

02:47:56,880 --> 02:47:58,230
and they they do a what's called a
hazard report that says hey there's

11228
02:47:58,230 --> 02:47:58,240
hazard report that says hey there's
 

11229
02:47:58,240 --> 02:47:59,590
hazard report that says hey there's
these objects out there we almost hit

they've picked them up like hovering on
 

11249
02:48:12,800 --> 02:48:14,070
they've picked them up like hovering on
radar and then all of a sudden they're

11250
02:48:14,070 --> 02:48:14,080
radar and then all of a sudden they're
 

11251

as some people suggest the higher-ups
 

11293
02:48:56,080 --> 02:48:57,110
as some people suggest the higher-ups
knew about it

11294

knew about it
 

11295
02:48:57,120 --> 02:48:58,870

secret military
uh uh you know it's like

11302
02:49:05,429 --> 02:49:05,439
uh uh you know it's like
 

11303
02:49:05,439 --> 02:49:07,830
uh uh you know it's like
like tests yeah so let's talk about so

11304
02:49:07,830 --> 02:49:07,840
like tests yeah so let's talk about so
 

11305
02:49:07,840 --> 02:49:10,070
like tests yeah so let's talk about so
let's say you've got this cool new toy

11306
02:49:10,070 --> 02:49:10,080
let's say you've got this cool new toy
 

11307
02:49:10,080 --> 02:49:12,230
let's say you've got this cool new toy
which you call it a cool new toy you

11308
02:49:12,230 --> 02:49:12,240
which you call it a cool new toy you
 

11309
02:49:12,240 --> 02:49:13,830
which you call it a cool new toy you
typically don't take your cool new toy

02:49:13,830 --> 02:49:13,840
typically don't take your cool new toy
 

11311
02:49:13,840 --> 02:49:15,429
typically don't take your cool new toy
out into an area where the cool new toy

out into an area where the cool new toy
 

11313
02:49:15,439 --> 02:49:17,030
out into an area where the cool new toy
could get damaged or

11314
02:49:17,030 --> 02:49:17,040
could get damaged or
 

11315
02:49:17,040 --> 02:49:18,389
could get damaged or
what if the airplane would have actually

11316
02:49:18,389 --> 02:49:18,399
what if the airplane would have actually
 

11317
02:49:18,399 --> 02:49:20,150
what if the airplane would have actually
hit your cool new toy and you got two

11318
02:49:20,150 --> 02:49:20,160
hit your cool new toy and you got two
 

11319
02:49:20,160 --> 02:49:21,910
hit your cool new toy and you got two
people that are ejecting or dead and you

11320
02:49:21,910 --> 02:49:21,920
people that are ejecting or dead and you
 

11321
02:49:21,920 --> 02:49:22,389
people that are ejecting or dead and you
got a

11322

got a
 

11323
02:49:22,399 --> 02:49:24,230
got a
you know 80 million airplane that's now

11324
02:49:24,230 --> 02:49:24,240
you know 80 million airplane that's now
 

11325
02:49:24,240 --> 02:49:26,550
you know 80 million airplane that's now
in the bottom of the atlantic

11326
02:49:26,550 --> 02:49:26,560
in the bottom of the atlantic
 

11327
02:49:26,560 --> 02:49:29,190
in the bottom of the atlantic
you know tests are normally done in

11328
02:49:29,190 --> 02:49:29,200
you know tests are normally done in
 

11329
02:49:29,200 --> 02:49:30,950
you know tests are normally done in
controlled environments just it's like

11330
02:49:30,950 --> 02:49:30,960
controlled environments just it's like
 

11331
02:49:30,960 --> 02:49:31,670
controlled environments just it's like
any test a

11332
02:49:31,670 --> 02:49:31,680
any test a
 

11333
02:49:31,680 --> 02:49:32,950
any test a
lab test or whatever when you take

11334
02:49:32,950 --> 02:49:32,960
lab test or whatever when you take
 

11335
02:49:32,960 --> 02:49:34,870
lab test or whatever when you take
things out into the real world

11336
02:49:34,870 --> 02:49:34,880
things out into the real world
 

11337
02:49:34,880 --> 02:49:36,389
things out into the real world
you know you're still going to test it

11338
02:49:36,389 --> 02:49:36,399
you know you're still going to test it
 

11339
02:49:36,399 --> 02:49:38,710
you know you're still going to test it
in an area where something goes wrong so

11340
02:49:38,710 --> 02:49:38,720
in an area where something goes wrong so
 

11341
02:49:38,720 --> 02:49:40,309
in an area where something goes wrong so
when they started and we'll go back to

11342
02:49:40,309 --> 02:49:40,319
when they started and we'll go back to
 

11343
02:49:40,319 --> 02:49:42,630
when they started and we'll go back to
elon so my friend that worked there

11344
02:49:42,630 --> 02:49:42,640
elon so my friend that worked there
 

11345
02:49:42,640 --> 02:49:44,150
elon so my friend that worked there
they had a rocket go off they were out

11346
02:49:44,150 --> 02:49:44,160
they had a rocket go off they were out
 

11347
02:49:44,160 --> 02:49:47,030
they had a rocket go off they were out
in kwajalein and when the rocket went up

11348
02:49:47,030 --> 02:49:47,040
in kwajalein and when the rocket went up
 

11349
02:49:47,040 --> 02:49:49,349
in kwajalein and when the rocket went up
a fuel line ruptured in the rocket and

11350
02:49:49,349 --> 02:49:49,359
a fuel line ruptured in the rocket and
 

11351
02:49:49,359 --> 02:49:51,030
a fuel line ruptured in the rocket and
it ran out of fuel before it got all the

11352
02:49:51,030 --> 02:49:51,040
it ran out of fuel before it got all the
 

11353
02:49:51,040 --> 02:49:53,190
it ran out of fuel before it got all the
way up and it came falling back down

11354
02:49:53,190 --> 02:49:53,200
way up and it came falling back down
 

11355
02:49:53,200 --> 02:49:54,710
way up and it came falling back down
well when you're out on an atoll in the

11356
02:49:54,710 --> 02:49:54,720
well when you're out on an atoll in the
 

11357
02:49:54,720 --> 02:49:57,510
well when you're out on an atoll in the
pacific if it's going up above you

11358
02:49:57,510 --> 02:49:57,520
pacific if it's going up above you
 

11359
02:49:57,520 --> 02:49:59,110
pacific if it's going up above you
the worst case is going to land on you

11360
02:49:59,110 --> 02:49:59,120
the worst case is going to land on you
 

11361
02:49:59,120 --> 02:50:00,790
the worst case is going to land on you
so you're worried about where else is it

11362
02:50:00,790 --> 02:50:00,800
so you're worried about where else is it
 

11363
02:50:00,800 --> 02:50:02,309
so you're worried about where else is it
going to land and it actually crashed

11364
02:50:02,309 --> 02:50:02,319
going to land and it actually crashed
 

11365
02:50:02,319 --> 02:50:03,910
going to land and it actually crashed
next to the atoll and and

11366
02:50:03,910 --> 02:50:03,920
next to the atoll and and
 

11367
02:50:03,920 --> 02:50:06,710
next to the atoll and and
you know elon wasn't happy and threw

11368
02:50:06,710 --> 02:50:06,720
you know elon wasn't happy and threw
 

11369
02:50:06,720 --> 02:50:08,150
you know elon wasn't happy and threw
this guy under the bus

11370
02:50:08,150 --> 02:50:08,160
this guy under the bus
 

11371
02:50:08,160 --> 02:50:11,190
this guy under the bus
so um that's a test environment because

11372
02:50:11,190 --> 02:50:11,200
so um that's a test environment because
 

11373
02:50:11,200 --> 02:50:13,190
so um that's a test environment because
you don't know what's going to happen so

11374
02:50:13,190 --> 02:50:13,200
you don't know what's going to happen so
 

11375
02:50:13,200 --> 02:50:14,630
you don't know what's going to happen so
because someone said well when we chased

11376
02:50:14,630 --> 02:50:14,640
because someone said well when we chased
 

11377
02:50:14,640 --> 02:50:15,830
because someone said well when we chased
the tic tac well it could have been some

11378
02:50:15,830 --> 02:50:15,840
the tic tac well it could have been some
 

11379
02:50:15,840 --> 02:50:17,190
the tic tac well it could have been some
secret government thing well secret

11380
02:50:17,190 --> 02:50:17,200
secret government thing well secret
 

11381
02:50:17,200 --> 02:50:18,389
secret government thing well secret
government things typically just don't

11382
02:50:18,389 --> 02:50:18,399
government things typically just don't
 

11383
02:50:18,399 --> 02:50:19,910
government things typically just don't
come out and test

11384
02:50:19,910 --> 02:50:19,920
come out and test
 

11385
02:50:19,920 --> 02:50:22,550
come out and test
to where unknowing pilots you can't

11386
02:50:22,550 --> 02:50:22,560
to where unknowing pilots you can't
 

11387
02:50:22,560 --> 02:50:23,269
to where unknowing pilots you can't
control

11388
02:50:23,269 --> 02:50:23,279
control
 

11389
02:50:23,279 --> 02:50:25,110
control
a lot of things you're exactly right so

11390
02:50:25,110 --> 02:50:25,120
a lot of things you're exactly right so
 

11391
02:50:25,120 --> 02:50:26,870
a lot of things you're exactly right so
you go you know

02:50:26,870 --> 02:50:26,880
you go you know
 

11393
02:50:26,880 --> 02:50:28,870
you go you know
it's you know it's not the doctor evil

11394

there

11398
02:50:30,790 --> 02:50:30,800
there
 

11399
02:50:30,800 --> 02:50:32,469
there
to get there's control and there's

11400
02:50:32,469 --> 02:50:32,479
to get there's control and there's
 

11401
02:50:32,479 --> 02:50:34,469
to get there's control and there's
reasons that we do it

11402
02:50:34,469 --> 02:50:34,479
reasons that we do it
 

11403
02:50:34,479 --> 02:50:36,070
reasons that we do it
because a lot of stuff especially when

11404

it
you go hey this is it looks like it's

11412
02:50:42,469 --> 02:50:42,479
you go hey this is it looks like it's
 

11413

you go hey this is it looks like it's
going to work you get funding you build

11414
02:50:44,389 --> 02:50:44,399
going to work you get funding you build
 

11415

it
 

11417
02:50:45,279 --> 02:50:47,670
it
you test it some more you bench test it

11418
02:50:47,670 --> 02:50:47,680
you test it some more you bench test it
 

11419
02:50:47,680 --> 02:50:48,790
you test it some more you bench test it
you know you

11420
02:50:48,790 --> 02:50:48,800
you know you
 

11421
02:50:48,800 --> 02:50:50,150
you know you
like an airplane with digital flight

11422
02:50:50,150 --> 02:50:50,160
like an airplane with digital flight
 

11423
02:50:50,160 --> 02:50:51,590
like an airplane with digital flight
controls before it even leaves the

11424

controls before it even leaves the
 

11425
02:50:51,600 --> 02:50:52,309
controls before it even leaves the

ground
 

11427
02:50:52,319 --> 02:50:53,990
ground
they've got things over the pedostatic

11428
02:50:53,990 --> 02:50:54,000
they've got things over the pedostatic
 

11429
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:55,429
they've got things over the pedostatic
system that are changing the

11430
02:50:55,429 --> 02:50:55,439
system that are changing the
 

11431
02:50:55,439 --> 02:50:57,349
system that are changing the
what the airplane thinks is the airspeed

11432
02:50:57,349 --> 02:50:57,359
what the airplane thinks is the airspeed
 

11433
02:50:57,359 --> 02:50:58,790
what the airplane thinks is the airspeed
talking to it and it's probably up on

11434
02:50:58,790 --> 02:50:58,800
talking to it and it's probably up on
 

11435
02:50:58,800 --> 02:51:00,309
talking to it and it's probably up on
jack so the gear up

11436
02:51:00,309 --> 02:51:00,319
jack so the gear up
 

11437
02:51:00,319 --> 02:51:02,230
jack so the gear up
so it doesn't it thinks it's flying it

11438
02:51:02,230 --> 02:51:02,240
so it doesn't it thinks it's flying it
 

11439
02:51:02,240 --> 02:51:03,670
so it doesn't it thinks it's flying it
doesn't know it's sitting on

02:58:01,920 --> 02:58:03,670
you know go back 500 years where you
know or a thousand years where travel we

11902
02:58:03,670 --> 02:58:03,680
know or a thousand years where travel we
 

11903
02:58:03,680 --> 02:58:05,190
know or a thousand years where travel we
weren't traveling across oceans at the

11904
02:58:05,190 --> 02:58:05,200
weren't traveling across oceans at the
 

11905
02:58:05,200 --> 02:58:06,710
weren't traveling across oceans at the
time we were well we don't think we were

11906
02:58:06,710 --> 02:58:06,720
time we were well we don't think we were
 

11907
02:58:06,720 --> 02:58:08,309
time we were well we don't think we were
the vikings probably were

11908
02:58:08,309 --> 02:58:08,319
the vikings probably were
 

11909
02:58:08,319 --> 02:58:10,790
the vikings probably were
um because we had limited you know we

11910
02:58:10,790 --> 02:58:10,800
um because we had limited you know we
 

11911
02:58:10,800 --> 02:58:11,990
um because we had limited you know we
had to have supplies and the boats

11912
02:58:11,990 --> 02:58:12,000
had to have supplies and the boats
 

11913
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:13,190
had to have supplies and the boats
weren't as big we had to build them by

11914
02:58:13,190 --> 02:58:13,200
weren't as big we had to build them by
 

11915
02:58:13,200 --> 02:58:14,550
weren't as big we had to build them by
hand we didn't have power tools and all

11916
02:58:14,550 --> 02:58:14,560
hand we didn't have power tools and all
 

11917
02:58:14,560 --> 02:58:15,830
hand we didn't have power tools and all
that stuff so you know

11918
02:58:15,830 --> 02:58:15,840
that stuff so you know
 

11919
02:58:15,840 --> 02:58:17,750
that stuff so you know
if you show up someplace like when the

11920
02:58:17,750 --> 02:58:17,760
if you show up someplace like when the
 

11921
02:58:17,760 --> 02:58:19,830
if you show up someplace like when the
conquistadors from spain came over into

11922
02:58:19,830 --> 02:58:19,840
conquistadors from spain came over into
 

11923
02:58:19,840 --> 02:58:21,269
conquistadors from spain came over into
south america and you've got

11924
02:58:21,269 --> 02:58:21,279
south america and you've got
 

11925
02:58:21,279 --> 02:58:24,070
south america and you've got
you know the natives you're actually an

11926
02:58:24,070 --> 02:58:24,080
you know the natives you're actually an
 

11927
02:58:24,080 --> 02:58:24,790
you know the natives you're actually an
alien

11928
02:58:24,790 --> 02:58:24,800
alien
 

11929
02:58:24,800 --> 02:58:26,070
alien
you know and then you look at what

11930
02:58:26,070 --> 02:58:26,080
you know and then you look at what
 

11931
02:58:26,080 --> 02:58:28,469
you know and then you look at what
typically happens when aliens show up

11932
02:58:28,469 --> 02:58:28,479
typically happens when aliens show up
 

11933
02:58:28,479 --> 02:58:30,790
typically happens when aliens show up
in in a human alien world you know and

11934
02:58:30,790 --> 02:58:30,800
in in a human alien world you know and
 

11935
02:58:30,800 --> 02:58:32,550
in in a human alien world you know and
when i say alien i mean you are not from

11936
02:58:32,550 --> 02:58:32,560
when i say alien i mean you are not from
 

11937
02:58:32,560 --> 02:58:33,670
when i say alien i mean you are not from
that area

11938
02:58:33,670 --> 02:58:33,680
that area
 

11939
02:58:33,680 --> 02:58:36,790
that area
the other we

11940
02:58:36,790 --> 02:58:36,800
the other we
 

11941
02:58:36,800 --> 02:58:38,950
the other we
we take what we want and that's what

11942
02:58:38,950 --> 02:58:38,960
we take what we want and that's what
 

11943
02:58:38,960 --> 02:58:40,630
we take what we want and that's what
happened i mean we literally

11944
02:58:40,630 --> 02:58:40,640
happened i mean we literally
 

11945
02:58:40,640 --> 02:58:43,670
happened i mean we literally
defuncted civilizations because that's

11946
02:58:43,670 --> 02:58:43,680
defuncted civilizations because that's
 

11947
02:58:43,680 --> 02:58:44,710
defuncted civilizations because that's
how we are

11948
02:58:44,710 --> 02:58:44,720
how we are
 

11949
02:58:44,720 --> 02:58:46,950
how we are
you know humans are we're an interesting

11950
02:58:46,950 --> 02:58:46,960
you know humans are we're an interesting
 

11951
02:58:46,960 --> 02:58:47,830
you know humans are we're an interesting
group

11952
02:58:47,830 --> 02:58:47,840
group
 

11953
02:58:47,840 --> 02:58:50,950
group
so you go now what what if something is

11954
02:58:50,950 --> 02:58:50,960
so you go now what what if something is
 

11955
02:58:50,960 --> 02:58:52,870
so you go now what what if something is
from someplace else just let's just

11956
02:58:52,870 --> 02:58:52,880
from someplace else just let's just
 

11957
02:58:52,880 --> 02:58:55,349
from someplace else just let's just
let's just go off the grid and go ah

11958
02:58:55,349 --> 02:58:55,359
let's just go off the grid and go ah
 

11959
02:58:55,359 --> 02:58:57,030
let's just go off the grid and go ah
let's say there are little green men

11960
02:58:57,030 --> 02:58:57,040
let's say there are little green men
 

11961
02:58:57,040 --> 02:58:58,710
let's say there are little green men
yeah what are their intentions lou asked

11962
02:58:58,710 --> 02:58:58,720
yeah what are their intentions lou asked
 

11963
02:58:58,720 --> 02:58:59,429
yeah what are their intentions lou asked
me this when we were

11964
02:58:59,429 --> 02:58:59,439
me this when we were
 

11965
02:58:59,439 --> 02:59:00,710
me this when we were
talking to lou alezando and he said what

11966
02:59:00,710 --> 02:59:00,720
talking to lou alezando and he said what
 

11967
02:59:00,720 --> 02:59:01,830
talking to lou alezando and he said what
do you think they were here for us i

11968
02:59:01,830 --> 02:59:01,840
do you think they were here for us i
 

11969
02:59:01,840 --> 02:59:02,950
do you think they were here for us i
don't know

11970
02:59:02,950 --> 02:59:02,960
don't know
 

11971
02:59:02,960 --> 02:59:04,469
don't know
he goes what i go hello they were

11972
02:59:04,469 --> 02:59:04,479
he goes what i go hello they were
 

11973
02:59:04,479 --> 02:59:06,150
he goes what i go hello they were
observing they'd come down they'd hang

11974
02:59:06,150 --> 02:59:06,160
observing they'd come down they'd hang
 

11975
02:59:06,160 --> 02:59:06,870
observing they'd come down they'd hang
out he goes

11976
02:59:06,870 --> 02:59:06,880
out he goes
 

11977
02:59:06,880 --> 02:59:07,750
out he goes
what if they were prepping the

11978
02:59:07,750 --> 02:59:07,760
what if they were prepping the
 

11979
02:59:07,760 --> 02:59:09,429
what if they were prepping the
battlefield what if they were observing

11980
02:59:09,429 --> 02:59:09,439
battlefield what if they were observing
 

11981
02:59:09,439 --> 02:59:11,590
battlefield what if they were observing
to figure out what we do

11982
02:59:11,590 --> 02:59:11,600
to figure out what we do
 

11983
02:59:11,600 --> 02:59:13,030
to figure out what we do
and you go that's interesting the other

11984
02:59:13,030 --> 02:59:13,040
and you go that's interesting the other
 

11985
02:59:13,040 --> 02:59:15,190
and you go that's interesting the other
theory is maybe there's a more advanced

11986
02:59:15,190 --> 02:59:15,200
theory is maybe there's a more advanced
 

11987
02:59:15,200 --> 02:59:16,630
theory is maybe there's a more advanced
civilization out here and they just

11988
02:59:16,630 --> 02:59:16,640
civilization out here and they just
 

11989
02:59:16,640 --> 02:59:17,830
civilization out here and they just
check in on us

11990
02:59:17,830 --> 02:59:17,840
check in on us
 

11991
02:59:17,840 --> 02:59:19,349
check in on us
because the threat to an advanced

11992
02:59:19,349 --> 02:59:19,359
because the threat to an advanced
 

11993
02:59:19,359 --> 02:59:21,510
because the threat to an advanced
civilization is when a civilization

11994
02:59:21,510 --> 02:59:21,520
civilization is when a civilization
 

11995
02:59:21,520 --> 02:59:23,110
civilization is when a civilization
that's inferior to them

11996
02:59:23,110 --> 02:59:23,120
that's inferior to them
 

11997
02:59:23,120 --> 02:59:25,110
that's inferior to them
actually develops enough and fast enough

11998
02:59:25,110 --> 02:59:25,120
actually develops enough and fast enough
 

11999
02:59:25,120 --> 02:59:26,790
actually develops enough and fast enough
to become equal or above

12000
02:59:26,790 --> 02:59:26,800
to become equal or above
 

12001
02:59:26,800 --> 02:59:28,070
to become equal or above
because now these they become the

12002
02:59:28,070 --> 02:59:28,080
because now these they become the
 

12003
02:59:28,080 --> 02:59:30,070
because now these they become the
threatened type so you watch us grow

12004
02:59:30,070 --> 02:59:30,080
threatened type so you watch us grow
 

12005
02:59:30,080 --> 02:59:31,910
threatened type so you watch us grow
until we start getting too much

12006
02:59:31,910 --> 02:59:31,920
until we start getting too much
 

12007
02:59:31,920 --> 02:59:33,110
until we start getting too much
you know it's kind of like you go well

12008
02:59:33,110 --> 02:59:33,120
you know it's kind of like you go well
 

12009
02:59:33,120 --> 02:59:34,309
you know it's kind of like you go well
because they always have a tendency to

12010
02:59:34,309 --> 02:59:34,319
because they always have a tendency to
 

12011
02:59:34,319 --> 02:59:35,590
because they always have a tendency to
hang out around nuclear

12012
02:59:35,590 --> 02:59:35,600
hang out around nuclear
 

12013
02:59:35,600 --> 02:59:37,269
hang out around nuclear
right and you go well you know they're

12014
02:59:37,269 --> 02:59:37,279
right and you go well you know they're
 

12015
02:59:37,279 --> 02:59:38,870
right and you go well you know they're
if this is an advanced civilization i'm

12016
02:59:38,870 --> 02:59:38,880
if this is an advanced civilization i'm
 

12017
02:59:38,880 --> 02:59:40,710
if this is an advanced civilization i'm
gonna go science fiction kind of comical

12018
02:59:40,710 --> 02:59:40,720
gonna go science fiction kind of comical
 

12019
02:59:40,720 --> 02:59:41,990
gonna go science fiction kind of comical
they come down and watch us and go look

12020
02:59:41,990 --> 02:59:42,000
they come down and watch us and go look
 

12021
02:59:42,000 --> 02:59:42,790
they come down and watch us and go look
at the

12022
02:59:42,790 --> 02:59:42,800
at the
 

12023
02:59:42,800 --> 02:59:45,429
at the
the the crazy upright monkeys now have

12024
02:59:45,429 --> 02:59:45,439
the the crazy upright monkeys now have
 

12025
02:59:45,439 --> 02:59:46,950
the the crazy upright monkeys now have
developed the atom bomb let's hope they

12026
02:59:46,950 --> 02:59:46,960
developed the atom bomb let's hope they
 

12027
02:59:46,960 --> 02:59:48,550
developed the atom bomb let's hope they
don't destroy themselves yeah if i was

12028
02:59:48,550 --> 02:59:48,560
don't destroy themselves yeah if i was
 

12029
02:59:48,560 --> 02:59:50,150
don't destroy themselves yeah if i was
an alien civilization i would start

12030
02:59:50,150 --> 02:59:50,160
an alien civilization i would start
 

12031
02:59:50,160 --> 02:59:51,910
an alien civilization i would start
paying attention with the atom bomb

12032
02:59:51,910 --> 02:59:51,920
paying attention with the atom bomb
 

12033
02:59:51,920 --> 02:59:53,349
paying attention with the atom bomb
that's why the

12034
02:59:53,349 --> 02:59:53,359
that's why the
 

12035
02:59:53,359 --> 02:59:57,110
that's why the
i mean there's certainly an uptick of uh

12036
02:59:57,110 --> 02:59:57,120
i mean there's certainly an uptick of uh
 

12037
02:59:57,120 --> 03:00:00,550
i mean there's certainly an uptick of uh
what is it ufo sightings since

12038
03:00:00,550 --> 03:00:00,560
what is it ufo sightings since
 

12039
03:00:00,560 --> 03:00:02,950
what is it ufo sightings since
since the nuclear since the nuclear era

12040
03:00:02,950 --> 03:00:02,960
since the nuclear since the nuclear era
 

12041
03:00:02,960 --> 03:00:03,910
since the nuclear since the nuclear era
yeah

12042
03:00:03,910 --> 03:00:03,920
yeah
 

12043
03:00:03,920 --> 03:00:07,670
yeah
that's you go um

12044
03:00:07,670 --> 03:00:07,680
that's you go um
 

12045
03:00:07,680 --> 03:00:09,429
that's you go um
let me ask a little bit out there

12046
03:00:09,429 --> 03:00:09,439
let me ask a little bit out there
 

12047
03:00:09,439 --> 03:00:12,550
let me ask a little bit out there
question maybe it's a speculation but

12048
03:00:12,550 --> 03:00:12,560
question maybe it's a speculation but
 

12049
03:00:12,560 --> 03:00:15,830
question maybe it's a speculation but
maybe touching on roswell

12050
03:00:15,830 --> 03:00:15,840
maybe touching on roswell
 

12051
03:00:15,840 --> 03:00:20,469
maybe touching on roswell
do you think it's possible that there is

12052
03:00:20,469 --> 03:00:20,479
do you think it's possible that there is
 

12053
03:00:20,479 --> 03:00:24,150
do you think it's possible that there is
out of this world aircraft

12054
03:00:24,150 --> 03:00:24,160
out of this world aircraft
 

12055
03:00:24,160 --> 03:00:28,790
out of this world aircraft
or beings that are in the possession of

12056
03:00:28,790 --> 03:00:28,800
or beings that are in the possession of
 

12057
03:00:28,800 --> 03:00:31,429
or beings that are in the possession of
one of the governments on this earth

12058
03:00:31,429 --> 03:00:31,439
one of the governments on this earth
 

12059
03:00:31,439 --> 03:00:32,630
one of the governments on this earth
like the us government

12060
03:00:32,630 --> 03:00:32,640
like the us government
 

12061
03:00:32,640 --> 03:00:35,590
like the us government
is it possible so the one perspective of

12062
03:00:35,590 --> 03:00:35,600
is it possible so the one perspective of
 

12063
03:00:35,600 --> 03:00:36,070
is it possible so the one perspective of
that

12064
03:00:36,070 --> 03:00:36,080
that
 

12065
03:00:36,080 --> 03:00:39,510
that
if it's possible is it possible to keep

12066
03:00:39,510 --> 03:00:39,520
if it's possible is it possible to keep
 

12067
03:00:39,520 --> 03:00:40,790
if it's possible is it possible to keep
a secret like that

12068
03:00:40,790 --> 03:00:40,800
a secret like that
 

12069
03:00:40,800 --> 03:00:42,790
a secret like that
i would say this i think it's very it's

12070
03:00:42,790 --> 03:00:42,800
i would say this i think it's very it's
 

12071
03:00:42,800 --> 03:00:43,910
i would say this i think it's very it's
highly possible

12072
03:00:43,910 --> 03:00:43,920
highly possible
 

12073
03:00:43,920 --> 03:00:45,510
highly possible
because if you go if you just look at

12074
03:00:45,510 --> 03:00:45,520
because if you go if you just look at
 

12075
03:00:45,520 --> 03:00:47,670
because if you go if you just look at
all the sightings and let's go

12076
03:00:47,670 --> 03:00:47,680
all the sightings and let's go
 

12077
03:00:47,680 --> 03:00:49,429
all the sightings and let's go
just look at project blue book oh it was

12078
03:00:49,429 --> 03:00:49,439
just look at project blue book oh it was
 

12079
03:00:49,439 --> 03:00:51,110
just look at project blue book oh it was
what forget how many thousands of

12080
03:00:51,110 --> 03:00:51,120
what forget how many thousands of
 

12081
03:00:51,120 --> 03:00:52,950
what forget how many thousands of
sightings and there's a percentage it's

12082
03:00:52,950 --> 03:00:52,960
sightings and there's a percentage it's
 

12083
03:00:52,960 --> 03:00:54,150
sightings and there's a percentage it's
like 10 or 15 percent

12084
03:00:54,150 --> 03:00:54,160
like 10 or 15 percent
 

12085
03:00:54,160 --> 03:00:56,070
like 10 or 15 percent
they still can't explain like our tic

12086
03:00:56,070 --> 03:00:56,080
they still can't explain like our tic
 

12087
03:00:56,080 --> 03:00:57,429
they still can't explain like our tic
tac is one of them you know they

12088
03:00:57,429 --> 03:00:57,439
tac is one of them you know they
 

12089
03:00:57,439 --> 03:00:58,309
tac is one of them you know they
basically the government has come out

12090
03:00:58,309 --> 03:00:58,319
basically the government has come out
 

12091
03:00:58,319 --> 03:00:59,750
basically the government has come out
and said we don't know what that was

12092
03:00:59,750 --> 03:00:59,760
and said we don't know what that was
 

12093
03:00:59,760 --> 03:01:02,389
and said we don't know what that was
okay so so if you go okay of that

12094
03:01:02,389 --> 03:01:02,399
okay so so if you go okay of that
 

12095
03:01:02,399 --> 03:01:04,070
okay so so if you go okay of that
fifteen percent that we don't know and

12096
03:01:04,070 --> 03:01:04,080
fifteen percent that we don't know and
 

12097
03:01:04,080 --> 03:01:05,670
fifteen percent that we don't know and
of these thousands they're still

12098
03:01:05,670 --> 03:01:05,680
of these thousands they're still
 

12099
03:01:05,680 --> 03:01:07,590
of these thousands they're still
that 15 makes up a pretty big number

12100
03:01:07,590 --> 03:01:07,600
that 15 makes up a pretty big number
 

12101
03:01:07,600 --> 03:01:09,110
that 15 makes up a pretty big number
what are the chances that not one of

12102
03:01:09,110 --> 03:01:09,120
what are the chances that not one of
 

12103
03:01:09,120 --> 03:01:11,990
what are the chances that not one of
them crashed somewhere on the globe

12104
03:01:11,990 --> 03:01:12,000
them crashed somewhere on the globe
 

12105
03:01:12,000 --> 03:01:14,230
them crashed somewhere on the globe
and was recovered and i don't care if

12106
03:01:14,230 --> 03:01:14,240
and was recovered and i don't care if
 

12107
03:01:14,240 --> 03:01:15,990
and was recovered and i don't care if
it's a intact system

12108
03:01:15,990 --> 03:01:16,000
it's a intact system
 

12109
03:01:16,000 --> 03:01:18,230
it's a intact system
or you got pieces of it of a metal that

12110
03:01:18,230 --> 03:01:18,240
or you got pieces of it of a metal that
 

12111
03:01:18,240 --> 03:01:20,070
or you got pieces of it of a metal that
we can't explain

12112
03:01:20,070 --> 03:01:20,080
we can't explain
 

12113
03:01:20,080 --> 03:01:24,710
we can't explain
or some some um biological

12114
03:01:24,710 --> 03:01:24,720
or some some um biological
 

12115
03:01:24,720 --> 03:01:27,429
or some some um biological
matter to say the least it could be

12116
03:01:27,429 --> 03:01:27,439
matter to say the least it could be
 

12117
03:01:27,439 --> 03:01:28,870
matter to say the least it could be
intact or it couldn't but

12118
03:01:28,870 --> 03:01:28,880
intact or it couldn't but
 

12119
03:01:28,880 --> 03:01:30,870
intact or it couldn't but
the the odds of that now are starting to

12120
03:01:30,870 --> 03:01:30,880
the the odds of that now are starting to
 

12121
03:01:30,880 --> 03:01:31,990
the the odds of that now are starting to
go down that

12122
03:01:31,990 --> 03:01:32,000
go down that
 

12123
03:01:32,000 --> 03:01:33,269
go down that
you know that could never happen and i'm

12124
03:01:33,269 --> 03:01:33,279
you know that could never happen and i'm
 

12125

has something that is not from this
 

12141
03:01:46,880 --> 03:01:48,389
has something that is not from this
world and i'm not talking to meteor but

world and i'm not talking to meteor but
 

12143
03:01:48,399 --> 03:01:49,510
world and i'm not talking to meteor but
something that was

12144
03:01:49,510 --> 03:01:49,520
something that was
 

12145
03:01:49,520 --> 03:01:51,990
something that was
manufactured in some way that allowed

transport
or observation it could be a drone could

12150
03:01:55,349 --> 03:01:55,359
or observation it could be a drone could
 

12151
03:01:55,359 --> 03:01:56,870
or observation it could be a drone could
be a foreign drone you know like voyager

12152
03:01:56,870 --> 03:01:56,880
be a foreign drone you know like voyager
 

12153
03:01:56,880 --> 03:01:58,870
be a foreign drone you know like voyager
flies around and does all that stuff and

12154
03:01:58,870 --> 03:01:58,880
flies around and does all that stuff and
 

12155
03:01:58,880 --> 03:02:00,550
flies around and does all that stuff and
we got stuff that just went past pluto

12156
03:02:00,550 --> 03:02:00,560
we got stuff that just went past pluto
 

12157
03:02:00,560 --> 03:02:02,150
we got stuff that just went past pluto
that's out in the kuiper belt

12158
03:02:02,150 --> 03:02:02,160
that's out in the kuiper belt
 

12159
03:02:02,160 --> 03:02:03,349
that's out in the kuiper belt
you know there's there's stuff out there

12160
03:02:03,349 --> 03:02:03,359
you know there's there's stuff out there
 

12161
03:02:03,359 --> 03:02:04,950
you know there's there's stuff out there
floating around and what about ours it's

12162
03:02:04,950 --> 03:02:04,960
floating around and what about ours it's
 

12163
03:02:04,960 --> 03:02:06,550
floating around and what about ours it's
going to crash into jupiter eventually

12164
03:02:06,550 --> 03:02:06,560
going to crash into jupiter eventually
 

12165
03:02:06,560 --> 03:02:07,190
going to crash into jupiter eventually
or whatever

12166
03:02:07,190 --> 03:02:07,200
or whatever
 

12167
03:02:07,200 --> 03:02:08,309
or whatever
because we've had stuff crashing the

12168
03:02:08,309 --> 03:02:08,319
because we've had stuff crashing the
 

12169
03:02:08,319 --> 03:02:11,429
because we've had stuff crashing the
planets so if that's the case

12170
03:02:11,429 --> 03:02:11,439
planets so if that's the case
 

12171
03:02:11,439 --> 03:02:13,110
planets so if that's the case
you would think something is out there

12172
03:02:13,110 --> 03:02:13,120
you would think something is out there
 

12173
03:02:13,120 --> 03:02:14,389
you would think something is out there
that we have something that we can't

12174
03:02:14,389 --> 03:02:14,399
that we have something that we can't
 

12175
03:02:14,399 --> 03:02:15,990
that we have something that we can't
explain and according to

12176
03:02:15,990 --> 03:02:16,000
explain and according to
 

12177
03:02:16,000 --> 03:02:18,710
explain and according to
lou there's stuff that we can't explain

12178
03:02:18,710 --> 03:02:18,720
lou there's stuff that we can't explain
 

12179
03:02:18,720 --> 03:02:20,230
lou there's stuff that we can't explain
you know and i would assume that lou

12180
03:02:20,230 --> 03:02:20,240
you know and i would assume that lou
 

12181
03:02:20,240 --> 03:02:23,269
you know and i would assume that lou
who ran atip has has seen stuff that he

12182

who ran atip has has seen stuff that he
 

12183
03:02:23,279 --> 03:02:24,950
who ran atip has has seen stuff that he
can't openly talk about

12184
03:02:24,950 --> 03:02:24,960
can't openly talk about
 

12185
03:02:24,960 --> 03:02:26,710

does that make sense so you classify to
 

12367
03:05:11,760 --> 03:05:13,349
does that make sense so you classify to
protect the source

12368
03:05:13,349 --> 03:05:13,359
protect the source
 

12369
03:05:13,359 --> 03:05:15,510
protect the source
you classify to protect the technology

12370
03:05:15,510 --> 03:05:15,520
you classify to protect the technology
 

12371
03:05:15,520 --> 03:05:17,429
you classify to protect the technology
because if the technology would get out

12372
03:05:17,429 --> 03:05:17,439
because if the technology would get out
 

12373
03:05:17,439 --> 03:05:17,990
because if the technology would get out
it could be

12374
03:05:17,990 --> 03:05:18,000
it could be
 

12375
03:05:18,000 --> 03:05:20,150
it could be
grave damage or there's levels depending

12376
03:05:20,150 --> 03:05:20,160
grave damage or there's levels depending
 

12377
03:05:20,160 --> 03:05:21,990
grave damage or there's levels depending
on if it's a secret or top secret

12378
03:05:21,990 --> 03:05:22,000
on if it's a secret or top secret
 

12379
03:05:22,000 --> 03:05:23,510
on if it's a secret or top secret
there are levels of damage that can be

03:05:23,510 --> 03:05:23,520
there are levels of damage that can be
 

12381
03:05:23,520 --> 03:05:25,030
there are levels of damage that can be
done to the u.s government and our

12382
03:05:25,030 --> 03:05:25,040
done to the u.s government and our
 

12383
03:05:25,040 --> 03:05:26,630
done to the u.s government and our
well-being as a country

12384
03:05:26,630 --> 03:05:26,640
well-being as a country
 

12385
03:05:26,640 --> 03:05:28,309
well-being as a country
and we owe it to this because we're all

03:05:28,309 --> 03:05:28,319
and we owe it to this because we're all
 

12387

come over here i kind of knew that from
 

12427
03:06:04,720 --> 03:06:06,070
come over here i kind of knew that from
the last time but

12428
03:06:06,070 --> 03:06:06,080
the last time but
 

12429
03:06:06,080 --> 03:06:09,110
the last time but
um but you come over here you basically

12430
03:06:09,110 --> 03:06:09,120
um but you come over here you basically
 

12431
03:06:09,120 --> 03:06:10,309
um but you come over here you basically
have made yourself

12432
03:06:10,309 --> 03:06:10,319
have made yourself
 

12433
03:06:10,319 --> 03:06:12,389
have made yourself
you're educated you're working at

12434
03:06:12,389 --> 03:06:12,399
you're educated you're working at
 

12435
03:06:12,399 --> 03:06:13,990
you're educated you're working at
literally the top research

12436
03:06:13,990 --> 03:06:14,000
literally the top research
 

12437
03:06:14,000 --> 03:06:17,269
literally the top research
university in the world to be honest

12438
03:06:17,269 --> 03:06:17,279
university in the world to be honest
 

12439
03:06:17,279 --> 03:06:19,590
university in the world to be honest
um i can do whatever the hell i can

12440
03:06:19,590 --> 03:06:19,600
um i can do whatever the hell i can
 

12441

create and
 

12443
03:06:20,640 --> 03:06:22,790
create and
with a bit of with a lot of hard work i

12444
03:06:22,790 --> 03:06:22,800
with a bit of with a lot of hard work i
 

12445

and no one gave it to you yeah so i mean
 

12449
03:06:26,960 --> 03:06:30,070
and no one gave it to you yeah so i mean
i'm a believer that like i mean

12450
03:06:30,070 --> 03:06:30,080
i'm a believer that like i mean
 

12451
03:06:30,080 --> 03:06:33,349
i'm a believer that like i mean
we are uh a community so like

12452
03:06:33,349 --> 03:06:33,359
we are uh a community so like
 

12453
03:06:33,359 --> 03:06:35,349
we are uh a community so like
there is a social aspect to it but the

12454
03:06:35,349 --> 03:06:35,359
there is a social aspect to it but the
 

12455
03:06:35,359 --> 03:06:36,389
there is a social aspect to it but the
freedom

12456
03:06:36,389 --> 03:06:36,399
freedom
 

12457
03:06:36,399 --> 03:06:38,230
freedom
and the american dream is a real thing

12458
03:06:38,230 --> 03:06:38,240
and the american dream is a real thing
 

12459
03:06:38,240 --> 03:06:40,150
and the american dream is a real thing
and that this is this i

12460
03:06:40,150 --> 03:06:40,160
and that this is this i
 

12461
03:06:40,160 --> 03:06:41,750
and that this is this i
you know i joke about being russian but

12462
03:06:41,750 --> 03:06:41,760
you know i joke about being russian but
 

12463
03:06:41,760 --> 03:06:44,230
you know i joke about being russian but
i i'm an american and this is

12464
03:06:44,230 --> 03:06:44,240
i i'm an american and this is
 

12465
03:06:44,240 --> 03:06:45,830
i i'm an american and this is
i do believe the greatest country on

12466
03:06:45,830 --> 03:06:45,840
i do believe the greatest country on
 

12467
03:06:45,840 --> 03:06:47,670
i do believe the greatest country on
earth so there's a reason

12468
03:06:47,670 --> 03:06:47,680
earth so there's a reason
 

12469
03:06:47,680 --> 03:06:51,110
earth so there's a reason
the nationalist pride uh the pride in

12470
03:06:51,110 --> 03:06:51,120
the nationalist pride uh the pride in
 

12471
03:06:51,120 --> 03:06:53,349
the nationalist pride uh the pride in
your nation is a powerful thing and

12472
03:06:53,349 --> 03:06:53,359
your nation is a powerful thing and
 

12473
03:06:53,359 --> 03:06:56,710
your nation is a powerful thing and
around that this secrecy

12474
03:06:56,710 --> 03:06:56,720
around that this secrecy
 

12475
03:06:56,720 --> 03:07:01,750
around that this secrecy
holds value but to me alien technology

12476
03:07:01,750 --> 03:07:01,760
holds value but to me alien technology
 

12477
03:07:01,760 --> 03:07:04,790
holds value but to me alien technology
is bigger than that i mean it's

12478
03:07:04,790 --> 03:07:04,800
is bigger than that i mean it's
 

12479
03:07:04,800 --> 03:07:08,230
is bigger than that i mean it's
it's not so much a threat as a

12480
03:07:08,230 --> 03:07:08,240
it's not so much a threat as a
 

12481
03:07:08,240 --> 03:07:11,510
it's not so much a threat as a
you're holding back something that could

12482
03:07:11,510 --> 03:07:11,520
you're holding back something that could
 

12483
03:07:11,520 --> 03:07:12,870
you're holding back something that could
inspire the world

12484
03:07:12,870 --> 03:07:12,880
inspire the world
 

12485
03:07:12,880 --> 03:07:15,830
inspire the world
like human knowledge so let's talk in

12486
03:07:15,830 --> 03:07:15,840
like human knowledge so let's talk in
 

12487
03:07:15,840 --> 03:07:17,030
like human knowledge so let's talk in
theory so

12488
03:07:17,030 --> 03:07:17,040
theory so
 

12489
03:07:17,040 --> 03:07:18,630
theory so
i'm gonna go back to bob because i've

12490
03:07:18,630 --> 03:07:18,640
i'm gonna go back to bob because i've
 

12491
03:07:18,640 --> 03:07:20,150
i'm gonna go back to bob because i've
talked about

12492
03:07:20,150 --> 03:07:20,160
talked about
 

12493
03:07:20,160 --> 03:07:23,590
talked about
so bob is a propulsion guy

12494
03:07:23,590 --> 03:07:23,600
so bob is a propulsion guy
 

12495
03:07:23,600 --> 03:07:25,429
so bob is a propulsion guy
right right bob has a bicycle with a

12496
03:07:25,429 --> 03:07:25,439
right right bob has a bicycle with a
 

12497
03:07:25,439 --> 03:07:27,750
right right bob has a bicycle with a
rocket motor he built the rocket car

12498
03:07:27,750 --> 03:07:27,760
rocket motor he built the rocket car
 

12499
03:07:27,760 --> 03:07:30,070
rocket motor he built the rocket car
you know so he did that so if you are

12500
03:07:30,070 --> 03:07:30,080
you know so he did that so if you are
 

12501
03:07:30,080 --> 03:07:33,190
you know so he did that so if you are
trying to figure out a propulsion system

12502
03:07:33,190 --> 03:07:33,200
trying to figure out a propulsion system
 

12503
03:07:33,200 --> 03:07:34,710
trying to figure out a propulsion system
let's just say this is i'm just talking

12504
03:07:34,710 --> 03:07:34,720
let's just say this is i'm just talking
 

12505
03:07:34,720 --> 03:07:36,870
let's just say this is i'm just talking
this is dave's theory

12506
03:07:36,870 --> 03:07:36,880
this is dave's theory
 

12507
03:07:36,880 --> 03:07:41,349
this is dave's theory
i am i own i have i have custody of this

12508
03:07:41,349 --> 03:07:41,359
i am i own i have i have custody of this
 

12509
03:07:41,359 --> 03:07:43,830
i am i own i have i have custody of this
thing from a technology that i don't

12510
03:07:43,830 --> 03:07:43,840
thing from a technology that i don't
 

12511
03:07:43,840 --> 03:07:44,550
thing from a technology that i don't
understand

12512
03:07:44,550 --> 03:07:44,560
understand
 

12513
03:07:44,560 --> 03:07:46,710
understand
and i know it's a propulsion system so

12514
03:07:46,710 --> 03:07:46,720
and i know it's a propulsion system so
 

12515
03:07:46,720 --> 03:07:48,389
and i know it's a propulsion system so
now i gotta figure it out

12516
03:07:48,389 --> 03:07:48,399
now i gotta figure it out
 

12517
03:07:48,399 --> 03:07:51,349
now i gotta figure it out
right so who are you gonna go to right

12518
03:07:51,349 --> 03:07:51,359
right so who are you gonna go to right
 

12519
03:07:51,359 --> 03:07:53,590
right so who are you gonna go to right
you go find someone so you go wait

12520
03:07:53,590 --> 03:07:53,600
you go find someone so you go wait
 

12521
03:07:53,600 --> 03:07:56,070
you go find someone so you go wait
here's a guy who at the time was working

12522
03:07:56,070 --> 03:07:56,080
here's a guy who at the time was working
 

12523
03:07:56,080 --> 03:07:58,469
here's a guy who at the time was working
at los alamos which they have proven

12524
03:07:58,469 --> 03:07:58,479
at los alamos which they have proven
 

12525
03:07:58,479 --> 03:08:00,389
at los alamos which they have proven
who is big into propulsion he designs

12526
03:08:00,389 --> 03:08:00,399
who is big into propulsion he designs
 

12527
03:08:00,399 --> 03:08:03,110
who is big into propulsion he designs
all this he builds a [\h__\h] in his garage

12528
03:08:03,110 --> 03:08:03,120
all this he builds a [\h__\h] in his garage
 

12529
03:08:03,120 --> 03:08:05,910
all this he builds a [\h__\h] in his garage
hey he's super smart why don't we bring

12530
03:08:05,910 --> 03:08:05,920
hey he's super smart why don't we bring
 

12531
03:08:05,920 --> 03:08:06,469
hey he's super smart why don't we bring
him in

12532
03:08:06,469 --> 03:08:06,479
him in
 

12533
03:08:06,479 --> 03:08:08,309
him in
so you hire him on a contract and you go

12534
03:08:08,309 --> 03:08:08,319
so you hire him on a contract and you go
 

12535
03:08:08,319 --> 03:08:09,349
so you hire him on a contract and you go
hey we're going to brief you into a

12536
03:08:09,349 --> 03:08:09,359
hey we're going to brief you into a
 

12537
03:08:09,359 --> 03:08:10,550
hey we're going to brief you into a
program and he goes and works on

12538
03:08:10,550 --> 03:08:10,560
program and he goes and works on
 

12539
03:08:10,560 --> 03:08:11,830
program and he goes and works on
wherever he says he worked you know

12540
03:08:11,830 --> 03:08:11,840
wherever he says he worked you know
 

12541
03:08:11,840 --> 03:08:13,349
wherever he says he worked you know
that's not important but you get access

12542
03:08:13,349 --> 03:08:13,359
that's not important but you get access
 

12543
03:08:13,359 --> 03:08:14,790
that's not important but you get access
to the technology to try and figure it

12544
03:08:14,790 --> 03:08:14,800
to the technology to try and figure it
 

12545
03:08:14,800 --> 03:08:15,590
to the technology to try and figure it
out

12546
03:08:15,590 --> 03:08:15,600
out
 

12547
03:08:15,600 --> 03:08:17,590
out
and then you go well you know bob comes

12548
03:08:17,590 --> 03:08:17,600
and then you go well you know bob comes
 

12549
03:08:17,600 --> 03:08:18,870
and then you go well you know bob comes
out and says you know like

12550
03:08:18,870 --> 03:08:18,880
out and says you know like
 

12551
03:08:18,880 --> 03:08:19,990
out and says you know like
we're figuring out these things but

12552
03:08:19,990 --> 03:08:20,000
we're figuring out these things but
 

12553
03:08:20,000 --> 03:08:21,349
we're figuring out these things but
there's a part where our technology

12554
03:08:21,349 --> 03:08:21,359
there's a part where our technology
 

12555
03:08:21,359 --> 03:08:22,870
there's a part where our technology
isn't advanced enough for us to figure

12556
03:08:22,870 --> 03:08:22,880
isn't advanced enough for us to figure
 

12557
03:08:22,880 --> 03:08:25,190
isn't advanced enough for us to figure
the whole thing out

12558
03:08:25,190 --> 03:08:25,200
the whole thing out
 

12559
03:08:25,200 --> 03:08:27,349
the whole thing out
so then you know and let's just say bob

12560
03:08:27,349 --> 03:08:27,359
so then you know and let's just say bob
 

12561
03:08:27,359 --> 03:08:28,790
so then you know and let's just say bob
doesn't come out and tell anyone

12562
03:08:28,790 --> 03:08:28,800
doesn't come out and tell anyone
 

12563
03:08:28,800 --> 03:08:30,550
doesn't come out and tell anyone
he he works on it until he gets to the

12564
03:08:30,550 --> 03:08:30,560
he he works on it until he gets to the
 

12565
03:08:30,560 --> 03:08:32,550
he he works on it until he gets to the
point where he's stagnated

12566
03:08:32,550 --> 03:08:32,560
point where he's stagnated
 

12567
03:08:32,560 --> 03:08:35,269
point where he's stagnated
he he said he's in a wall you go i can't

12568
03:08:35,269 --> 03:08:35,279
he he said he's in a wall you go i can't
 

12569
03:08:35,279 --> 03:08:36,550
he he said he's in a wall you go i can't
do it so sometimes the best thing is to

12570
03:08:36,550 --> 03:08:36,560
do it so sometimes the best thing is to
 

12571
03:08:36,560 --> 03:08:37,910
do it so sometimes the best thing is to
bring in a fresh mind so you go find

12572
03:08:37,910 --> 03:08:37,920
bring in a fresh mind so you go find
 

12573
03:08:37,920 --> 03:08:39,110
bring in a fresh mind so you go find
someone else who's in a propulsion you

12574
03:08:39,110 --> 03:08:39,120
someone else who's in a propulsion you
 

12575
03:08:39,120 --> 03:08:40,070
someone else who's in a propulsion you
bring them and they work

12576
03:08:40,070 --> 03:08:40,080
bring them and they work
 

12577
03:08:40,080 --> 03:08:41,429
bring them and they work
they can't figure it out or they get to

12578
03:08:41,429 --> 03:08:41,439
they can't figure it out or they get to
 

12579
03:08:41,439 --> 03:08:43,190
they can't figure it out or they get to
the point where kind of back to the

12580
03:08:43,190 --> 03:08:43,200
the point where kind of back to the
 

12581
03:08:43,200 --> 03:08:44,630
the point where kind of back to the
einstein theory where hey i've got all

12582
03:08:44,630 --> 03:08:44,640
einstein theory where hey i've got all
 

12583
03:08:44,640 --> 03:08:45,990
einstein theory where hey i've got all
these theories on how it works but we

12584
03:08:45,990 --> 03:08:46,000
these theories on how it works but we
 

12585
03:08:46,000 --> 03:08:47,190
these theories on how it works but we
don't have the technology we haven't

12586
03:08:47,190 --> 03:08:47,200
don't have the technology we haven't
 

12587
03:08:47,200 --> 03:08:47,990
don't have the technology we haven't
advanced enough to

12588
03:08:47,990 --> 03:08:48,000
advanced enough to
 

12589
03:08:48,000 --> 03:08:49,429
advanced enough to
actually do what we need to do we still

12590
03:08:49,429 --> 03:08:49,439
actually do what we need to do we still
 

12591
03:08:49,439 --> 03:08:51,030
actually do what we need to do we still
have to advance technology more

12592
03:08:51,030 --> 03:08:51,040
have to advance technology more
 

12593
03:08:51,040 --> 03:08:53,269
have to advance technology more
so then what do you do you shelve it you

12594
03:08:53,269 --> 03:08:53,279
so then what do you do you shelve it you
 

12595
03:08:53,279 --> 03:08:54,070
so then what do you do you shelve it you
go hey good

12596
03:08:54,070 --> 03:08:54,080
go hey good
 

12597
03:08:54,080 --> 03:08:55,750
go hey good
project's over and the contract you

12598
03:08:55,750 --> 03:08:55,760
project's over and the contract you
 

12599
03:08:55,760 --> 03:08:58,710
project's over and the contract you
shelf it and you wait another 10 years

12600
03:08:58,710 --> 03:08:58,720
shelf it and you wait another 10 years
 

12601
03:08:58,720 --> 03:09:00,230
shelf it and you wait another 10 years
and you wait another 10 years until

12602
03:09:00,230 --> 03:09:00,240
and you wait another 10 years until
 

12603
03:09:00,240 --> 03:09:02,230
and you wait another 10 years until
technology and our abilities and our

12604
03:09:02,230 --> 03:09:02,240
technology and our abilities and our
 

12605
03:09:02,240 --> 03:09:04,630
technology and our abilities and our
our research advances more and then you

12606
03:09:04,630 --> 03:09:04,640
our research advances more and then you
 

12607
03:09:04,640 --> 03:09:06,230
our research advances more and then you
go find new people to bring in that are

12608
03:09:06,230 --> 03:09:06,240
go find new people to bring in that are
 

12609
03:09:06,240 --> 03:09:07,670
go find new people to bring in that are
experts in that field and go hey we want

12610
03:09:07,670 --> 03:09:07,680
experts in that field and go hey we want
 

12611
03:09:07,680 --> 03:09:08,630
experts in that field and go hey we want
you to work on this thing

12612
03:09:08,630 --> 03:09:08,640
you to work on this thing
 

12613
03:09:08,640 --> 03:09:10,710
you to work on this thing
and here's what we know about it so far

12614
03:09:10,710 --> 03:09:10,720
and here's what we know about it so far
 

12615
03:09:10,720 --> 03:09:11,910
and here's what we know about it so far
or you don't tell them

12616
03:09:11,910 --> 03:09:11,920
or you don't tell them
 

12617
03:09:11,920 --> 03:09:14,710
or you don't tell them
anything because because remember if you

12618
03:09:14,710 --> 03:09:14,720
anything because because remember if you
 

12619
03:09:14,720 --> 03:09:16,230
anything because because remember if you
if you reveal someone else's research

12620
03:09:16,230 --> 03:09:16,240
if you reveal someone else's research
 

12621
03:09:16,240 --> 03:09:17,670
if you reveal someone else's research
you can taint their beliefs they'll

12622
03:09:17,670 --> 03:09:17,680
you can taint their beliefs they'll
 

12623
03:09:17,680 --> 03:09:19,030
you can taint their beliefs they'll
start to sway in that direction so you

12624
03:09:19,030 --> 03:09:19,040
start to sway in that direction so you
 

12625
03:09:19,040 --> 03:09:19,349
start to sway in that direction so you
go

12626
03:09:19,349 --> 03:09:19,359
go
 

12627
03:09:19,359 --> 03:09:20,950
go
i'm not going to tell you anything i'm

12628
03:09:20,950 --> 03:09:20,960
i'm not going to tell you anything i'm
 

12629
03:09:20,960 --> 03:09:22,309
i'm not going to tell you anything i'm
going to give you this thing and now you

12630
03:09:22,309 --> 03:09:22,319
going to give you this thing and now you
 

12631
03:09:22,319 --> 03:09:23,429
going to give you this thing and now you
tell me what you think and as they

12632
03:09:23,429 --> 03:09:23,439
tell me what you think and as they
 

12633
03:09:23,439 --> 03:09:25,269
tell me what you think and as they
progress if they get stuck

12634
03:09:25,269 --> 03:09:25,279
progress if they get stuck
 

12635
03:09:25,279 --> 03:09:26,950
progress if they get stuck
on a problem that maybe bob and someone

12636
03:09:26,950 --> 03:09:26,960
on a problem that maybe bob and someone
 

12637
03:09:26,960 --> 03:09:28,389
on a problem that maybe bob and someone
else solved earlier you can go hey what

12638
03:09:28,389 --> 03:09:28,399
else solved earlier you can go hey what
 

12639
03:09:28,399 --> 03:09:29,429
else solved earlier you can go hey what
about this you don't have to tell where

12640
03:09:29,429 --> 03:09:29,439
about this you don't have to tell where
 

12641
03:09:29,439 --> 03:09:29,990
about this you don't have to tell where
it came from

12642
03:09:29,990 --> 03:09:30,000
it came from
 

12643
03:09:30,000 --> 03:09:31,269
it came from
what about this and now they can

12644
03:09:31,269 --> 03:09:31,279
what about this and now they can
 

12645
03:09:31,279 --> 03:09:33,269
what about this and now they can
leapfrog and they get another two steps

12646
03:09:33,269 --> 03:09:33,279
leapfrog and they get another two steps
 

12647
03:09:33,279 --> 03:09:35,670
leapfrog and they get another two steps
closer to the final answer

12648
03:09:35,670 --> 03:09:35,680
closer to the final answer
 

12649
03:09:35,680 --> 03:09:37,750
closer to the final answer
and then we get stuck by our evolution

12650
03:09:37,750 --> 03:09:37,760
and then we get stuck by our evolution
 

12651
03:09:37,760 --> 03:09:39,190
and then we get stuck by our evolution
of technology do you shelve it again

12652
03:09:39,190 --> 03:09:39,200
of technology do you shelve it again
 

12653
03:09:39,200 --> 03:09:40,870
of technology do you shelve it again
do you think that's the right way to do

12654
03:09:40,870 --> 03:09:40,880
do you think that's the right way to do
 

12655
03:09:40,880 --> 03:09:43,110
do you think that's the right way to do
it because it's heartbreaking

12656
03:09:43,110 --> 03:09:43,120
it because it's heartbreaking
 

12657
03:09:43,120 --> 03:09:46,309
it because it's heartbreaking
i don't listen i love government but

12658
03:09:46,309 --> 03:09:46,319
i don't listen i love government but
 

12659
03:09:46,319 --> 03:09:48,469
i don't listen i love government but
we just had this discussion about elon

12660
03:09:48,469 --> 03:09:48,479
we just had this discussion about elon
 

12661
03:09:48,479 --> 03:09:49,830
we just had this discussion about elon
and so on

12662
03:09:49,830 --> 03:09:49,840
and so on
 

12663
03:09:49,840 --> 03:09:53,190
and so on
the the alternative approach is to

12664
03:09:53,190 --> 03:09:53,200
the the alternative approach is to
 

12665
03:09:53,200 --> 03:09:55,590
the the alternative approach is to
release this to the world and say

12666
03:09:55,590 --> 03:09:55,600
release this to the world and say
 

12667
03:09:55,600 --> 03:09:57,030
release this to the world and say
there's a mystery here

12668
03:09:57,030 --> 03:09:57,040
there's a mystery here
 

12669
03:09:57,040 --> 03:09:58,870
there's a mystery here
and then the elons of the world the jeff

12670
03:09:58,870 --> 03:09:58,880
and then the elons of the world the jeff
 

12671
03:09:58,880 --> 03:10:00,630
and then the elons of the world the jeff
bezos who talked about money but it's

12672
03:10:00,630 --> 03:10:00,640
bezos who talked about money but it's

i'm gonna be the one that cracks this
 

12681
03:10:10,239 --> 03:10:11,590
i'm gonna be the one that cracks this
mystery open

12682

mystery open
 

12683
03:10:11,600 --> 03:10:13,830
mystery open
and like that's within a lot of us and

12684
03:10:13,830 --> 03:10:13,840
and like that's within a lot of us and
 

12685
03:10:13,840 --> 03:10:15,590
and like that's within a lot of us and
like money aside

12686
03:10:15,590 --> 03:10:15,600
like money aside
 

12687
03:10:15,600 --> 03:10:17,910
like money aside
people in their garage just will but

12688
03:10:17,910 --> 03:10:17,920
people in their garage just will but
 

12689
03:10:17,920 --> 03:10:19,269
people in their garage just will but
you're thinking like a scientist

12690
03:10:19,269 --> 03:10:19,279
you're thinking like a scientist
 

12691
03:10:19,279 --> 03:10:21,030
you're thinking like a scientist
now let me now let's shift to let me

12692
03:10:21,030 --> 03:10:21,040
now let me now let's shift to let me
 

12693
03:10:21,040 --> 03:10:22,950
now let me now let's shift to let me
think like a country so we have country

12694
03:10:22,950 --> 03:10:22,960
think like a country so we have country
 

12695
03:10:22,960 --> 03:10:24,550
think like a country so we have country
a b and c

12696
03:10:24,550 --> 03:10:24,560
a b and c
 

12697
03:10:24,560 --> 03:10:26,070
a b and c
and you can look at the nuclear arms

12698
03:10:26,070 --> 03:10:26,080
and you can look at the nuclear arms
 

12699
03:10:26,080 --> 03:10:27,910
and you can look at the nuclear arms
race so we know that germany was really

12700
03:10:27,910 --> 03:10:27,920
race so we know that germany was really
 

12701
03:10:27,920 --> 03:10:28,710
race so we know that germany was really
close

12702
03:10:28,710 --> 03:10:28,720
close
 

12703
03:10:28,720 --> 03:10:30,150
close
we know that russia was getting pretty

12704
03:10:30,150 --> 03:10:30,160
we know that russia was getting pretty
 

12705
03:10:30,160 --> 03:10:31,910
we know that russia was getting pretty
close we just won

12706
03:10:31,910 --> 03:10:31,920
close we just won
 

12707
03:10:31,920 --> 03:10:33,750
close we just won
the race and we were the first ones with

12708
03:10:33,750 --> 03:10:33,760
the race and we were the first ones with
 

12709
03:10:33,760 --> 03:10:35,590
the race and we were the first ones with
it yeah and still to the state germany

12710
03:10:35,590 --> 03:10:35,600
it yeah and still to the state germany
 

12711
03:10:35,600 --> 03:10:36,710
it yeah and still to the state germany
could have won

12712
03:10:36,710 --> 03:10:36,720
could have won
 

12713
03:10:36,720 --> 03:10:38,630
could have won
they could have won they could have won

12714
03:10:38,630 --> 03:10:38,640
they could have won they could have won
 

12715
03:10:38,640 --> 03:10:40,469
they could have won they could have won
but someone was smart enough to not

12716
03:10:40,469 --> 03:10:40,479
but someone was smart enough to not
 

12717
03:10:40,479 --> 03:10:41,830
but someone was smart enough to not
finish the equation when they knew they

12718
03:10:41,830 --> 03:10:41,840
finish the equation when they knew they
 

12719
03:10:41,840 --> 03:10:43,110
finish the equation when they knew they
had the answer

12720
03:10:43,110 --> 03:10:43,120
had the answer
 

12721
03:10:43,120 --> 03:10:44,630
had the answer
it's literally what it comes down to

12722
03:10:44,630 --> 03:10:44,640
it's literally what it comes down to
 

12723
03:10:44,640 --> 03:10:46,309
it's literally what it comes down to
someone was smart enough to realize that

12724
03:10:46,309 --> 03:10:46,319
someone was smart enough to realize that
 

12725
03:10:46,319 --> 03:10:46,630
someone was smart enough to realize that
that

12726
03:10:46,630 --> 03:10:46,640
that
 

12727
03:10:46,640 --> 03:10:49,590
that
that got into the hands of the nazis

12728
03:10:49,590 --> 03:10:49,600
that got into the hands of the nazis
 

12729
03:10:49,600 --> 03:10:51,349
that got into the hands of the nazis
that it would be the end

12730
03:10:51,349 --> 03:10:51,359
that it would be the end
 

12731
03:10:51,359 --> 03:10:54,150
that it would be the end
and and that's that's a tough call to do

12732
03:10:54,150 --> 03:10:54,160
and and that's that's a tough call to do
 

12733
03:10:54,160 --> 03:10:54,630
and and that's that's a tough call to do
that

12734
03:10:54,630 --> 03:10:54,640
that
 

12735
03:10:54,640 --> 03:10:55,990
that
knowing that you have the answer and you

12736
03:10:55,990 --> 03:10:56,000
knowing that you have the answer and you
 

12737
03:10:56,000 --> 03:10:57,429
knowing that you have the answer and you
can't solve the problem because it will

12738
03:10:57,429 --> 03:10:57,439
can't solve the problem because it will
 

12739
03:10:57,439 --> 03:10:58,630
can't solve the problem because it will
go into the wrong hand and that's kind

12740
03:10:58,630 --> 03:10:58,640
go into the wrong hand and that's kind
 

12741
03:10:58,640 --> 03:11:00,550
go into the wrong hand and that's kind
of the fear when you look at this you go

12742
03:11:00,550 --> 03:11:00,560
of the fear when you look at this you go
 

12743
03:11:00,560 --> 03:11:03,510
of the fear when you look at this you go
okay so if we do this if we put it out

12744
03:11:03,510 --> 03:11:03,520
okay so if we do this if we put it out
 

12745
03:11:03,520 --> 03:11:05,830
okay so if we do this if we put it out
there we've got this technology

12746
03:11:05,830 --> 03:11:05,840
there we've got this technology
 

12747
03:11:05,840 --> 03:11:07,030
there we've got this technology
if we don't work on it kind of

12748
03:11:07,030 --> 03:11:07,040
if we don't work on it kind of
 

12749
03:11:07,040 --> 03:11:08,550
if we don't work on it kind of
international space station like we're

12750
03:11:08,550 --> 03:11:08,560
international space station like we're
 

12751
03:11:08,560 --> 03:11:10,389
international space station like we're
all going to work on it together

12752
03:11:10,389 --> 03:11:10,399
all going to work on it together
 

12753
03:11:10,399 --> 03:11:12,950
all going to work on it together
in uh you know like antarctica is really

12754
03:11:12,950 --> 03:11:12,960
in uh you know like antarctica is really
 

12755
03:11:12,960 --> 03:11:14,309
in uh you know like antarctica is really
supposed to be

12756
03:11:14,309 --> 03:11:14,319
supposed to be
 

12757
03:11:14,319 --> 03:11:15,910
supposed to be
treaty free from any weapons or anything

12758
03:11:15,910 --> 03:11:15,920
treaty free from any weapons or anything
 

12759
03:11:15,920 --> 03:11:16,790
treaty free from any weapons or anything
we're supposed to we got the

12760
03:11:16,790 --> 03:11:16,800
we're supposed to we got the
 

12761
03:11:16,800 --> 03:11:18,070
we're supposed to we got the
international thing down there we're all

12762
03:11:18,070 --> 03:11:18,080
international thing down there we're all
 

12763
03:11:18,080 --> 03:11:19,030
international thing down there we're all
going to work together

12764
03:11:19,030 --> 03:11:19,040
going to work together
 

12765
03:11:19,040 --> 03:11:21,269
going to work together
if you did it in the confines of that

12766
03:11:21,269 --> 03:11:21,279
if you did it in the confines of that
 

12767
03:11:21,279 --> 03:11:23,110
if you did it in the confines of that
and you could control the flow in and

12768
03:11:23,110 --> 03:11:23,120
and you could control the flow in and
 

12769
03:11:23,120 --> 03:11:24,309
and you could control the flow in and
out

12770
03:11:24,309 --> 03:11:24,319
out
 

12771
03:11:24,319 --> 03:11:25,590
out
because what you don't want is the

12772
03:11:25,590 --> 03:11:25,600
because what you don't want is the
 

12773
03:11:25,600 --> 03:11:27,190
because what you don't want is the
someone stealing information and getting

12774
03:11:27,190 --> 03:11:27,200
someone stealing information and getting
 

12775
03:11:27,200 --> 03:11:27,590
someone stealing information and getting
it back

12776
03:11:27,590 --> 03:11:27,600
it back
 

12777
03:11:27,600 --> 03:11:29,190
it back
to where and countries are notorious to

12778
03:11:29,190 --> 03:11:29,200
to where and countries are notorious to
 

12779
03:11:29,200 --> 03:11:31,030
to where and countries are notorious to
do this hey we're doing internationally

12780
03:11:31,030 --> 03:11:31,040
do this hey we're doing internationally
 

12781
03:11:31,040 --> 03:11:32,790
do this hey we're doing internationally
but we're secretly doing it ourselves to

12782
03:11:32,790 --> 03:11:32,800
but we're secretly doing it ourselves to
 

12783
03:11:32,800 --> 03:11:34,229
but we're secretly doing it ourselves to
see who can come up with a solution

12784
03:11:34,229 --> 03:11:34,239
see who can come up with a solution
 

12785
03:11:34,239 --> 03:11:35,670
see who can come up with a solution
first

12786
03:11:35,670 --> 03:11:35,680
first
 

12787
03:11:35,680 --> 03:11:37,269
first
that's the problem because we have this

12788
03:11:37,269 --> 03:11:37,279
that's the problem because we have this
 

12789
03:11:37,279 --> 03:11:39,830
that's the problem because we have this
inherent thing of power and technology

12790
03:11:39,830 --> 03:11:39,840
inherent thing of power and technology
 

12791
03:11:39,840 --> 03:11:41,190
inherent thing of power and technology
like that is power

12792
03:11:41,190 --> 03:11:41,200
like that is power
 

12793
03:11:41,200 --> 03:11:43,510
like that is power
it would literally change the game of

12794
03:11:43,510 --> 03:11:43,520
it would literally change the game of
 

12795
03:11:43,520 --> 03:11:45,830
it would literally change the game of
the way the world operates and from

12796
03:11:45,830 --> 03:11:45,840
the way the world operates and from
 

12797
03:11:45,840 --> 03:11:48,950
the way the world operates and from
not just a transportation or mankind but

12798
03:11:48,950 --> 03:11:48,960
not just a transportation or mankind but
 

12799
03:11:48,960 --> 03:11:49,990
not just a transportation or mankind but
from a military aspect

12800
03:11:49,990 --> 03:11:50,000
from a military aspect
 

12801
03:11:50,000 --> 03:11:53,429
from a military aspect
it's got huge huge uh

12802
03:11:53,429 --> 03:11:53,439
it's got huge huge uh
 

12803
03:11:53,439 --> 03:11:56,150
it's got huge huge uh
yeah yeah i guess so beautifully

12804
03:11:56,150 --> 03:11:56,160
yeah yeah i guess so beautifully
 

12805
03:11:56,160 --> 03:11:57,510
yeah yeah i guess so beautifully
beautifully presented

12806
03:11:57,510 --> 03:11:57,520
beautifully presented
 

12807
03:11:57,520 --> 03:11:58,790
beautifully presented
and there's i feel like there's a

12808
03:11:58,790 --> 03:11:58,800
and there's i feel like there's a
 

12809
03:11:58,800 --> 03:12:00,630
and there's i feel like there's a
tension between those two places the

12810
03:12:00,630 --> 03:12:00,640
tension between those two places the
 

12811
03:12:00,640 --> 03:12:02,469
tension between those two places the
scientists view the world

12812
03:12:02,469 --> 03:12:02,479
scientists view the world
 

12813
03:12:02,479 --> 03:12:04,469
scientists view the world
and the national security view of the

12814
03:12:04,469 --> 03:12:04,479
and the national security view of the
 

12815
03:12:04,479 --> 03:12:05,750
and the national security view of the
world

12816
03:12:05,750 --> 03:12:05,760
world
 

12817
03:12:05,760 --> 03:12:07,590
world
let me let me get to this kind of

12818
03:12:07,590 --> 03:12:07,600
let me let me get to this kind of
 

12819
03:12:07,600 --> 03:12:09,910
let me let me get to this kind of
interesting point which is

12820
03:12:09,910 --> 03:12:09,920
interesting point which is
 

12821
03:12:09,920 --> 03:12:12,630
interesting point which is
a lot of conspiracy theorists kind of

12822
03:12:12,630 --> 03:12:12,640
a lot of conspiracy theorists kind of
 

12823
03:12:12,640 --> 03:12:14,229
a lot of conspiracy theorists kind of
paint a picture of government as an

12824
03:12:14,229 --> 03:12:14,239
paint a picture of government as an
 

12825
03:12:14,239 --> 03:12:15,510
paint a picture of government as an
exceptionally

12826
03:12:15,510 --> 03:12:15,520
exceptionally
 

12827
03:12:15,520 --> 03:12:17,349
exceptionally
as a hierarchical system that's

12828
03:12:17,349 --> 03:12:17,359
as a hierarchical system that's
 

12829
03:12:17,359 --> 03:12:19,190
as a hierarchical system that's
exceptionally competent

12830

of them ever built
 

12991
03:14:59,760 --> 03:15:02,630
of them ever built
it was a like 60 000 foot high you know

12992
03:15:02,630 --> 03:15:02,640
it was a like 60 000 foot high you know
 

12993

3 it was an incredible airplane when you

12996
03:15:05,269 --> 03:15:05,279
3 it was an incredible airplane when you
 

12997
03:15:05,279 --> 03:15:06,710
3 it was an incredible airplane when you
see it there's actually the last one

12998
03:15:06,710 --> 03:15:06,720
see it there's actually the last one
 

12999
03:15:06,720 --> 03:15:08,070
see it there's actually the last one
remaining is in dayton ohio at the

13000
03:15:08,070 --> 03:15:08,080
remaining is in dayton ohio at the
 

13001
03:15:08,080 --> 03:15:08,790
remaining is in dayton ohio at the
museum

13002
03:15:08,790 --> 03:15:08,800
museum
 

13003
03:15:08,800 --> 03:15:10,229
museum
you know it would go that wingtips would

13004
03:15:10,229 --> 03:15:10,239
you know it would go that wingtips would
 

13005
03:15:10,239 --> 03:15:11,670
you know it would go that wingtips would
fall down it looks like a concord but

13006
03:15:11,670 --> 03:15:11,680
fall down it looks like a concord but
 

13007
03:15:11,680 --> 03:15:15,269
fall down it looks like a concord but
it's way faster

13008
03:15:15,269 --> 03:15:15,279

 

13009
03:15:15,279 --> 03:15:16,469

when that got out that we were

13010
03:15:16,469 --> 03:15:16,479
when that got out that we were
 

13011
03:15:16,479 --> 03:15:18,870
when that got out that we were
developing it the soviet union developed

13012
03:15:18,870 --> 03:15:18,880
developing it the soviet union developed
 

13013
03:15:18,880 --> 03:15:20,630
developing it the soviet union developed
the mig-25

13014
03:15:20,630 --> 03:15:20,640
the mig-25
 

13015
03:15:20,640 --> 03:15:23,030
the mig-25
literally a high-altitude interceptor to

13016
03:15:23,030 --> 03:15:23,040
literally a high-altitude interceptor to
 

13017
03:15:23,040 --> 03:15:24,950
literally a high-altitude interceptor to
counter that bomber

13018
03:15:24,950 --> 03:15:24,960
counter that bomber
 

13019
03:15:24,960 --> 03:15:27,429
counter that bomber
and they built an entire fleet of

13020
03:15:27,429 --> 03:15:27,439
and they built an entire fleet of
 

13021
03:15:27,439 --> 03:15:29,030
and they built an entire fleet of
mig-25s

13022
03:15:29,030 --> 03:15:29,040
mig-25s
 

13023
03:15:29,040 --> 03:15:32,870
mig-25s
right we built three xb70s and we

13024
03:15:32,870 --> 03:15:32,880
right we built three xb70s and we
 

13025
03:15:32,880 --> 03:15:34,710
right we built three xb70s and we
scrapped the program

13026
03:15:34,710 --> 03:15:34,720
scrapped the program
 

13027
03:15:34,720 --> 03:15:37,670
scrapped the program
right because now you go well it's the

13028
03:15:37,670 --> 03:15:37,680
right because now you go well it's the
 

13029
03:15:37,680 --> 03:15:39,510
right because now you go well it's the
technology is cool we proved it but now

13030
03:15:39,510 --> 03:15:39,520
technology is cool we proved it but now
 

13031
03:15:39,520 --> 03:15:40,790
technology is cool we proved it but now
it becomes obsolete so it's not even

13032
03:15:40,790 --> 03:15:40,800
it becomes obsolete so it's not even
 

13033
03:15:40,800 --> 03:15:41,990
it becomes obsolete so it's not even
worth building a whole fleet of these

13034
03:15:41,990 --> 03:15:42,000
worth building a whole fleet of these
 

13035
03:15:42,000 --> 03:15:43,030
worth building a whole fleet of these
things

13036
03:15:43,030 --> 03:15:43,040
things
 

13037
03:15:43,040 --> 03:15:44,550
things
you know it's constant it's a chess game

13038
03:15:44,550 --> 03:15:44,560
you know it's constant it's a chess game
 

13039
03:15:44,560 --> 03:15:46,309
you know it's constant it's a chess game
we do something they do something we do

13040
03:15:46,309 --> 03:15:46,319
we do something they do something we do
 

13041
03:15:46,319 --> 03:15:47,750
we do something they do something we do
something they do something and it's

13042
03:15:47,750 --> 03:15:47,760
something they do something and it's
 

13043
03:15:47,760 --> 03:15:49,269
something they do something and it's
we do something and then they counter it

13044
03:15:49,269 --> 03:15:49,279
we do something and then they counter it
 

13045
03:15:49,279 --> 03:15:50,389
we do something and then they counter it
they got a fee it's you got to figure

13046
03:15:50,389 --> 03:15:50,399
they got a fee it's you got to figure
 

13047
03:15:50,399 --> 03:15:51,510
they got a fee it's you got to figure
out how to defeat it

13048
03:15:51,510 --> 03:15:51,520
out how to defeat it
 

13049
03:15:51,520 --> 03:15:53,510
out how to defeat it
so you go oh we'll build something so

13050
03:15:53,510 --> 03:15:53,520
so you go oh we'll build something so
 

13051
03:15:53,520 --> 03:15:54,950
so you go oh we'll build something so
the more we keep

13052
03:15:54,950 --> 03:15:54,960
the more we keep
 

13053
03:15:54,960 --> 03:15:57,269
the more we keep
uh quiet especially from a defense

13054
03:15:57,269 --> 03:15:57,279
uh quiet especially from a defense
 

13055
03:15:57,279 --> 03:15:58,229
uh quiet especially from a defense
standpoint

13056
03:15:58,229 --> 03:15:58,239
standpoint
 

13057
03:15:58,239 --> 03:15:59,670
standpoint
the better we actually at person i think

13058
03:15:59,670 --> 03:15:59,680
the better we actually at person i think
 

13059
03:15:59,680 --> 03:16:02,070
the better we actually at person i think
we talk too much and i think the the

13060
03:16:02,070 --> 03:16:02,080
we talk too much and i think the the
 

13061
03:16:02,080 --> 03:16:03,750
we talk too much and i think the the
military and the dod is starting to see

13062
03:16:03,750 --> 03:16:03,760
military and the dod is starting to see
 

13063
03:16:03,760 --> 03:16:04,309
military and the dod is starting to see
that

13064
03:16:04,309 --> 03:16:04,319
that
 

13065
03:16:04,319 --> 03:16:07,110
that
you know we're too open you know you

13066
03:16:07,110 --> 03:16:07,120
you know we're too open you know you
 

13067
03:16:07,120 --> 03:16:08,229
you know we're too open you know you
know you announce hey we're building

13068
03:16:08,229 --> 03:16:08,239
know you announce hey we're building
 

13069
03:16:08,239 --> 03:16:09,429
know you announce hey we're building
this because there's a budget line and

13070
03:16:09,429 --> 03:16:09,439
this because there's a budget line and
 

13071
03:16:09,439 --> 03:16:11,429
this because there's a budget line and
we live in a free society

13072
03:16:11,429 --> 03:16:11,439
we live in a free society
 

13073
03:16:11,439 --> 03:16:14,469
we live in a free society
um but you don't have to release all the

13074
03:16:14,469 --> 03:16:14,479
um but you don't have to release all the
 

13075
03:16:14,479 --> 03:16:15,670
um but you don't have to release all the
specs

13076
03:16:15,670 --> 03:16:15,680
specs
 

13077
03:16:15,680 --> 03:16:16,950
specs
and you don't have to put everything in

13078
03:16:16,950 --> 03:16:16,960
and you don't have to put everything in
 

13079
03:16:16,960 --> 03:16:18,950
and you don't have to put everything in
open source but that's a problem when we

13080
03:16:18,950 --> 03:16:18,960
open source but that's a problem when we
 

13081
03:16:18,960 --> 03:16:19,750
open source but that's a problem when we
go to

13082
03:16:19,750 --> 03:16:19,760
go to
 

13083
03:16:19,760 --> 03:16:22,150
go to
the universities if we want to go do

13084
03:16:22,150 --> 03:16:22,160
the universities if we want to go do
 

13085
03:16:22,160 --> 03:16:23,750
the universities if we want to go do
work with mit and you want to partner

13086
03:16:23,750 --> 03:16:23,760
work with mit and you want to partner
 

13087
03:16:23,760 --> 03:16:25,190
work with mit and you want to partner
with mit and you're a defense company

13088
03:16:25,190 --> 03:16:25,200
with mit and you're a defense company
 

13089
03:16:25,200 --> 03:16:26,550
with mit and you're a defense company
and you want to partner

13090

and you want to partner
 

13091
03:16:26,560 --> 03:16:28,229
and you want to partner
you know you guys have a rule that if

13092
03:16:28,229 --> 03:16:28,239
you know you guys have a rule that if
 

13093
03:16:28,239 --> 03:16:30,150
you know you guys have a rule that if
you create it then it can be open source

13094
03:16:30,150 --> 03:16:30,160
you create it then it can be open source
 

13095
03:16:30,160 --> 03:16:31,590
you create it then it can be open source
because the university owns it and we

13096
03:16:31,590 --> 03:16:31,600
because the university owns it and we
 

13097
03:16:31,600 --> 03:16:32,070
because the university owns it and we
are

an institution of learning yeah where
 

13101
03:16:34,319 --> 03:16:35,750
an institution of learning yeah where
the defense side might go

13102
03:16:35,750 --> 03:16:35,760
the defense side might go
 

13103
03:16:35,760 --> 03:16:37,110
the defense side might go
we don't we don't really want that

you know some of this new technology
 

13133
03:17:06,960 --> 03:17:08,389
you know some of this new technology
that you develop for an open source

smart high school kids that have figured

13214
03:18:12,630 --> 03:18:12,640
smart high school kids that have figured
 

13215
03:18:12,640 --> 03:18:13,910
smart high school kids that have figured
out mathematically and they do their

13216
03:18:13,910 --> 03:18:13,920
out mathematically and they do their
 

13217
03:18:13,920 --> 03:18:15,110
out mathematically and they do their
science project and then the government

13218
03:18:15,110 --> 03:18:15,120
science project and then the government
 

13219
03:18:15,120 --> 03:18:16,469
science project and then the government
comes in and says hey we got to classify

13220
03:18:16,469 --> 03:18:16,479
comes in and says hey we got to classify
 

13221
03:18:16,479 --> 03:18:17,429
comes in and says hey we got to classify
your government because we just don't

13222
03:18:17,429 --> 03:18:17,439
your government because we just don't
 

13223
03:18:17,439 --> 03:18:19,750
your government because we just don't
want this out in the public domain

13224
03:18:19,750 --> 03:18:19,760
want this out in the public domain
 

13225
03:18:19,760 --> 03:18:21,590
want this out in the public domain
which i understand but they never stop

13226
03:18:21,590 --> 03:18:21,600
which i understand but they never stop
 

13227
03:18:21,600 --> 03:18:23,190
which i understand but they never stop
them from free thought and developing

13228
03:18:23,190 --> 03:18:23,200
them from free thought and developing
 

13229
03:18:23,200 --> 03:18:24,630
them from free thought and developing
that it's just

13230
03:18:24,630 --> 03:18:24,640
that it's just
 

13231
03:18:24,640 --> 03:18:26,550
that it's just
we really don't want this out there okay

13232
03:18:26,550 --> 03:18:26,560
we really don't want this out there okay
 

13233

elon and we're going to
be think about it there's a significant

13248
03:18:38,469 --> 03:18:38,479
be think about it there's a significant
 

13249
03:18:38,479 --> 03:18:39,990
be think about it there's a significant
amount of money that could be available

13250
03:18:39,990 --> 03:18:40,000
amount of money that could be available
 

13251
03:18:40,000 --> 03:18:41,510
amount of money that could be available
to r d and i'm not talking just science

13252
03:18:41,510 --> 03:18:41,520
to r d and i'm not talking just science
 

13253
03:18:41,520 --> 03:18:42,630
to r d and i'm not talking just science
like this i'm talking

13254
03:18:42,630 --> 03:18:42,640
like this i'm talking
 

13255
03:18:42,640 --> 03:18:45,110
like this i'm talking
medical research and all this but then

13256
03:18:45,110 --> 03:18:45,120
medical research and all this but then
 

13257
03:18:45,120 --> 03:18:46,550
medical research and all this but then
you go who gets it because now you're

13258
03:18:46,550 --> 03:18:46,560
you go who gets it because now you're
 

13259
03:18:46,560 --> 03:18:48,150
you go who gets it because now you're
competing against

13260
03:18:48,150 --> 03:18:48,160
competing against
 

13261
03:18:48,160 --> 03:18:49,750
competing against
the companies that actually do it you go

13262
03:18:49,750 --> 03:18:49,760
the companies that actually do it you go
 

13263
03:18:49,760 --> 03:18:51,349
the companies that actually do it you go
is that well are they the

13264
03:18:51,349 --> 03:18:51,359
is that well are they the
 

13265
03:18:51,359 --> 03:18:54,469
is that well are they the
greatest minds i'd say you know that

13266
03:18:54,469 --> 03:18:54,479
greatest minds i'd say you know that
 

13267
03:18:54,479 --> 03:18:57,190
greatest minds i'd say you know that
we have a tendency to go these are the

13268
03:18:57,190 --> 03:18:57,200
we have a tendency to go these are the
 

13269
03:18:57,200 --> 03:18:58,870
we have a tendency to go these are the
best that we have and i'd say well no

13270
03:18:58,870 --> 03:18:58,880
best that we have and i'd say well no
 

13271
03:18:58,880 --> 03:19:00,469
best that we have and i'd say well no
that's the best that we know we have

13272
03:19:00,469 --> 03:19:00,479
that's the best that we know we have
 

13273
03:19:00,479 --> 03:19:01,670
that's the best that we know we have
but there's probably people out there

13274
03:19:01,670 --> 03:19:01,680
but there's probably people out there
 

13275
03:19:01,680 --> 03:19:03,110
but there's probably people out there
that don't want to work there's

13276
03:19:03,110 --> 03:19:03,120
that don't want to work there's
 

13277
03:19:03,120 --> 03:19:04,229
that don't want to work there's
brilliant minds that don't want to do

13278
03:19:04,229 --> 03:19:04,239
brilliant minds that don't want to do
 

13279
03:19:04,239 --> 03:19:05,190
brilliant minds that don't want to do
anything with defense

13280
03:19:05,190 --> 03:19:05,200
anything with defense
 

13281
03:19:05,200 --> 03:19:06,550
anything with defense
because they just disagree with what it

13282
03:19:06,550 --> 03:19:06,560
because they just disagree with what it
 

13283
03:19:06,560 --> 03:19:08,870
because they just disagree with what it
does so they go to another path

13284
03:19:08,870 --> 03:19:08,880
does so they go to another path
 

13285
03:19:08,880 --> 03:19:10,790
does so they go to another path
they can do something else and that in a

13286
03:19:10,790 --> 03:19:10,800
they can do something else and that in a
 

13287
03:19:10,800 --> 03:19:11,910
they can do something else and that in a
sense like

13288
03:19:11,910 --> 03:19:11,920
sense like
 

13289
03:19:11,920 --> 03:19:14,229
sense like

03:19:14,239 --> 03:19:15,910
the elon's of the world that jeff bezos
actually

13292
03:19:15,910 --> 03:19:15,920
actually
 

13293
03:19:15,920 --> 03:19:18,469
actually
in a certain sense much better than uh

03:30:24,880 --> 03:30:26,229
if you don't look up until later when it
starts to get to the outer edge of the

14072
03:30:26,229 --> 03:30:26,239
starts to get to the outer edge of the
 

14073
03:30:26,239 --> 03:30:27,510
starts to get to the outer edge of the
atmosphere where

14074
03:30:27,510 --> 03:30:27,520
atmosphere where
 

14075
03:30:27,520 --> 03:30:29,429
atmosphere where
the plume coming out of the engine is

14076
03:30:29,429 --> 03:30:29,439
the plume coming out of the engine is
 

14077
03:30:29,439 --> 03:30:30,550
the plume coming out of the engine is
not constrained but

14078
03:30:30,550 --> 03:30:30,560
not constrained but
 

14079
03:30:30,560 --> 03:30:31,990
not constrained but
you can watch this on tv when leaving

14080
03:30:31,990 --> 03:30:32,000
you can watch this on tv when leaving
 

14081
03:30:32,000 --> 03:30:33,990
you can watch this on tv when leaving
the spacex ones go it's nice and narrow

14082
03:30:33,990 --> 03:30:34,000
the spacex ones go it's nice and narrow
 

14083
03:30:34,000 --> 03:30:35,190
the spacex ones go it's nice and narrow
narrow narrow and then it hits a point

14084
03:30:35,190 --> 03:30:35,200
narrow narrow and then it hits a point
 

14085
03:30:35,200 --> 03:30:36,710
narrow narrow and then it hits a point
where it really starts to go up and it

14086
03:30:36,710 --> 03:30:36,720
where it really starts to go up and it
 

14087
03:30:36,720 --> 03:30:37,830
where it really starts to go up and it
starts to come to the sides because

14088
03:30:37,830 --> 03:30:37,840
starts to come to the sides because
 

14089
03:30:37,840 --> 03:30:38,469
starts to come to the sides because
there's

14090
03:30:38,469 --> 03:30:38,479
there's
 

14091
03:30:38,479 --> 03:30:40,229
there's
the forces aren't holding that all into

14092
03:30:40,229 --> 03:30:40,239
the forces aren't holding that all into
 

14093
03:30:40,239 --> 03:30:41,590
the forces aren't holding that all into
one unique thing

14094
03:30:41,590 --> 03:30:41,600
one unique thing
 

14095
03:30:41,600 --> 03:30:43,670
one unique thing
and it looks really odd and then it'll

14096
03:30:43,670 --> 03:30:43,680
and it looks really odd and then it'll
 

14097
03:30:43,680 --> 03:30:45,429
and it looks really odd and then it'll
go off

14098
03:30:45,429 --> 03:30:45,439
go off
 

14099
03:30:45,439 --> 03:30:46,870
go off
because it burns out and then you get

14100
03:30:46,870 --> 03:30:46,880
because it burns out and then you get
 

14101
03:30:46,880 --> 03:30:48,150
because it burns out and then you get
stage separation then you see the next

14102
03:30:48,150 --> 03:30:48,160
stage separation then you see the next
 

14103
03:30:48,160 --> 03:30:50,389
stage separation then you see the next
one go off and then it's gone

14104
03:30:50,389 --> 03:30:50,399
one go off and then it's gone
 

14105
03:30:50,399 --> 03:30:52,150
one go off and then it's gone
um and people don't understand that

14106
03:30:52,150 --> 03:30:52,160
um and people don't understand that
 

14107
03:30:52,160 --> 03:30:53,510
um and people don't understand that
because they didn't watch it from launch

14108
03:30:53,510 --> 03:30:53,520
because they didn't watch it from launch
 

14109
03:30:53,520 --> 03:30:54,710
because they didn't watch it from launch
because we used to sit in our driveway

14110
03:30:54,710 --> 03:30:54,720
because we used to sit in our driveway
 

14111
03:30:54,720 --> 03:30:56,070
because we used to sit in our driveway
and you know vandenberg is it was a

14112
03:30:56,070 --> 03:30:56,080
and you know vandenberg is it was a
 

14113
03:30:56,080 --> 03:30:57,269
and you know vandenberg is it was a
three hour drive but you could sit and

14114
03:30:57,269 --> 03:30:57,279
three hour drive but you could sit and
 

14115
03:30:57,279 --> 03:30:58,630
three hour drive but you could sit and
watch it go you knew they're launching

14116
03:30:58,630 --> 03:30:58,640
watch it go you knew they're launching
 

14117
03:30:58,640 --> 03:30:59,750
watch it go you knew they're launching
at night you'd watch

14118
03:30:59,750 --> 03:30:59,760
at night you'd watch
 

14119
03:30:59,760 --> 03:31:02,550
at night you'd watch
you watch thing it's really cool if you

14120
03:31:02,550 --> 03:31:02,560
you watch thing it's really cool if you
 

14121
03:31:02,560 --> 03:31:03,830
you watch thing it's really cool if you
don't see anything what you see is the

14122
03:31:03,830 --> 03:31:03,840
don't see anything what you see is the
 

14123
03:31:03,840 --> 03:31:05,750
don't see anything what you see is the
weird clouds from the exhaust plume

14124
03:31:05,750 --> 03:31:05,760
weird clouds from the exhaust plume
 

14125
03:31:05,760 --> 03:31:07,190
weird clouds from the exhaust plume
you know what's left the residue that's

14126
03:31:07,190 --> 03:31:07,200
you know what's left the residue that's
 

14127
03:31:07,200 --> 03:31:08,790
you know what's left the residue that's
sitting in the atmosphere and

14128
03:31:08,790 --> 03:31:08,800
sitting in the atmosphere and
 

14129
03:31:08,800 --> 03:31:09,990
sitting in the atmosphere and
the wind starts blowing it so you get

14130
03:31:09,990 --> 03:31:10,000
the wind starts blowing it so you get
 

14131
03:31:10,000 --> 03:31:11,510
the wind starts blowing it so you get
these really kind of weird shapes in the

14132
03:31:11,510 --> 03:31:11,520
these really kind of weird shapes in the
 

14133
03:31:11,520 --> 03:31:12,870
these really kind of weird shapes in the
sky

14134
03:31:12,870 --> 03:31:12,880
sky
 

14135
03:31:12,880 --> 03:31:14,229
sky
you know that's part but when you go to

14136
03:31:14,229 --> 03:31:14,239
you know that's part but when you go to
 

14137
03:31:14,239 --> 03:31:15,590
you know that's part but when you go to
phoenix lights and you go hey you know

14138
03:31:15,590 --> 03:31:15,600
phoenix lights and you go hey you know
 

14139
03:31:15,600 --> 03:31:16,950
phoenix lights and you go hey you know
when when a thousand people see

14140
03:31:16,950 --> 03:31:16,960
when when a thousand people see
 

14141
03:31:16,960 --> 03:31:17,429
when when a thousand people see
something

14142
03:31:17,429 --> 03:31:17,439
something
 

14143
03:31:17,439 --> 03:31:18,630
something
you're gonna discredit all a thousand

14144
03:31:18,630 --> 03:31:18,640
you're gonna discredit all a thousand
 

14145
03:31:18,640 --> 03:31:20,070
you're gonna discredit all a thousand
people are you gonna try and explain it

14146
03:31:20,070 --> 03:31:20,080
people are you gonna try and explain it
 

14147
03:31:20,080 --> 03:31:22,070
people are you gonna try and explain it
away with something else

14148
03:31:22,070 --> 03:31:22,080
away with something else
 

14149
03:31:22,080 --> 03:31:24,150
away with something else
you know you know the big it's a weather

14150
03:31:24,150 --> 03:31:24,160
you know you know the big it's a weather
 

14151
03:31:24,160 --> 03:31:25,110
you know you know the big it's a weather
balloon

14152
03:31:25,110 --> 03:31:25,120
balloon
 

14153
03:31:25,120 --> 03:31:27,830
balloon
you know it's a weather balloon again

14154
03:31:27,830 --> 03:31:27,840
you know it's a weather balloon again
 

14155
03:31:27,840 --> 03:31:29,429
you know it's a weather balloon again
just like the tic tac i think is

14156
03:31:29,429 --> 03:31:29,439
just like the tic tac i think is
 

14157
03:31:29,439 --> 03:31:32,710
just like the tic tac i think is
just inspiring uh for

14158
03:31:32,710 --> 03:31:32,720
just inspiring uh for
 

14159
03:31:32,720 --> 03:31:35,910
just inspiring uh for
the limitless nature of the science i

14160
03:31:35,910 --> 03:31:35,920
the limitless nature of the science i
 

14161
03:31:35,920 --> 03:31:36,389
the limitless nature of the science i
think you're

14162
03:31:36,389 --> 03:31:36,399
think you're
 

14163
03:31:36,399 --> 03:31:37,429
think you're
i think more is going to come out i

14164
03:31:37,429 --> 03:31:37,439
i think more is going to come out i
 

14165
03:31:37,439 --> 03:31:40,309
i think more is going to come out i
think some of the stuff that the the to

14166
03:31:40,309 --> 03:31:40,319
think some of the stuff that the the to
 

14167
03:31:40,319 --> 03:31:41,910
think some of the stuff that the the to
the stars folks have done

14168
03:31:41,910 --> 03:31:41,920
the stars folks have done
 

14169
03:31:41,920 --> 03:31:44,790
the stars folks have done
uh so there's a stars academy yeah what

14170
03:31:44,790 --> 03:31:44,800
uh so there's a stars academy yeah what
 

14171
03:31:44,800 --> 03:31:45,990
uh so there's a stars academy yeah what
are your thoughts about them

14172
03:31:45,990 --> 03:31:46,000
are your thoughts about them
 

14173
03:31:46,000 --> 03:31:47,910
are your thoughts about them
are they um i talk to them quite a bit

14174
03:31:47,910 --> 03:31:47,920
are they um i talk to them quite a bit
 

14175
03:31:47,920 --> 03:31:49,990
are they um i talk to them quite a bit
um i am not a part of to the stars

14176
03:31:49,990 --> 03:31:50,000
um i am not a part of to the stars
 

14177
03:31:50,000 --> 03:31:51,269
um i am not a part of to the stars
academy i

14178
03:31:51,269 --> 03:31:51,279
academy i
 

14179
03:31:51,279 --> 03:31:53,190
academy i
you know but you know like i talked to

14180
03:31:53,190 --> 03:31:53,200
you know but you know like i talked to
 

14181
03:31:53,200 --> 03:31:54,630
you know but you know like i talked to
lou i just was texting him

14182
03:31:54,630 --> 03:31:54,640
lou i just was texting him
 

14183
03:31:54,640 --> 03:31:57,269
lou i just was texting him
before this yeah so he they're what's

14184
03:31:57,269 --> 03:31:57,279
before this yeah so he they're what's
 

14185
03:31:57,279 --> 03:31:58,710
before this yeah so he they're what's
their mission what's their hope what's

14186
03:31:58,710 --> 03:31:58,720
their mission what's their hope what's
 

14187
03:31:58,720 --> 03:32:00,710
their mission what's their hope what's
their what's there when they started

14188
03:32:00,710 --> 03:32:00,720
their what's there when they started
 

14189
03:32:00,720 --> 03:32:04,630
their what's there when they started
their mission was to try and

14190
03:32:04,630 --> 03:32:04,640
their mission was to try and
 

14191
03:32:04,640 --> 03:32:06,150
their mission was to try and
don't look at this as little green men

14192
03:32:06,150 --> 03:32:06,160
don't look at this as little green men
 

14193
03:32:06,160 --> 03:32:08,630
don't look at this as little green men
but let's look at this as a technology

14194
03:32:08,630 --> 03:32:08,640
but let's look at this as a technology
 

14195
03:32:08,640 --> 03:32:11,030
but let's look at this as a technology
and let's try and almost reverse

14196
03:32:11,030 --> 03:32:11,040
and let's try and almost reverse
 

14197
03:32:11,040 --> 03:32:12,630
and let's try and almost reverse
engineer and figure out how these things

14198
03:32:12,630 --> 03:32:12,640
engineer and figure out how these things
 

14199
03:32:12,640 --> 03:32:13,429
engineer and figure out how these things
operate and

14200
03:32:13,429 --> 03:32:13,439
operate and
 

14201
03:32:13,439 --> 03:32:16,229
operate and
how can we explain this from using our

14202
03:32:16,229 --> 03:32:16,239
how can we explain this from using our
 

14203
03:32:16,239 --> 03:32:17,510
how can we explain this from using our
knowledge you know physics based

14204
03:32:17,510 --> 03:32:17,520
knowledge you know physics based
 

14205
03:32:17,520 --> 03:32:18,790
knowledge you know physics based
knowledge to go how would something like

14206
03:32:18,790 --> 03:32:18,800
knowledge to go how would something like
 

14207
03:32:18,800 --> 03:32:19,830
knowledge to go how would something like
this operate

14208
03:32:19,830 --> 03:32:19,840
this operate
 

14209
03:32:19,840 --> 03:32:21,750
this operate
that's really their bottom line was to

14210
03:32:21,750 --> 03:32:21,760
that's really their bottom line was to
 

14211
03:32:21,760 --> 03:32:23,190
that's really their bottom line was to
try and use and then

14212
03:32:23,190 --> 03:32:23,200
try and use and then
 

14213
03:32:23,200 --> 03:32:24,790
try and use and then

03:32:37,750 --> 03:32:37,760
ancient aliens covers all kinds of
 

14227
03:32:37,760 --> 03:32:38,950
ancient aliens covers all kinds of
theories

14228
03:32:38,950 --> 03:32:38,960
theories
 

14229
03:32:38,960 --> 03:32:40,870
theories
you know it's kind of off of oh my god

14230
03:32:40,870 --> 03:32:40,880
you know it's kind of off of oh my god
 

14231
03:32:40,880 --> 03:32:42,790
you know it's kind of off of oh my god
and i've seen the stuff and i've seen

14232
03:32:42,790 --> 03:32:42,800
and i've seen the stuff and i've seen
 

14233
03:32:42,800 --> 03:32:44,070
and i've seen the stuff and i've seen
stuff that i've said taken out of

14234
03:32:44,070 --> 03:32:44,080
stuff that i've said taken out of
 

14235
03:32:44,080 --> 03:32:47,429
stuff that i've said taken out of
context on shows that i did not talk to

14236
03:32:47,429 --> 03:32:47,439
context on shows that i did not talk to
 

14237
03:32:47,439 --> 03:32:48,950
context on shows that i did not talk to
uh so there's all that because you can

14238
03:32:48,950 --> 03:32:48,960
uh so there's all that because you can
 

14239
03:32:48,960 --> 03:32:50,469
uh so there's all that because you can
take a clip and go oh it's this

14240
03:32:50,469 --> 03:32:50,479
take a clip and go oh it's this
 

14241
03:32:50,479 --> 03:32:52,150
take a clip and go oh it's this
it's that you know and if i know about

14242
03:32:52,150 --> 03:32:52,160
it's that you know and if i know about
 

14243
03:32:52,160 --> 03:32:54,229
it's that you know and if i know about
stuff like you can't technically use my

14244
03:32:54,229 --> 03:32:54,239
stuff like you can't technically use my
 

14245
03:32:54,239 --> 03:32:56,229
stuff like you can't technically use my
likeness unless i tell you you can

14246
03:32:56,229 --> 03:32:56,239
likeness unless i tell you you can
 

14247
03:32:56,239 --> 03:32:57,510
likeness unless i tell you you can
so if i haven't signed something you

14248
03:32:57,510 --> 03:32:57,520
so if i haven't signed something you
 

14249
03:32:57,520 --> 03:32:58,550
so if i haven't signed something you
can't do there was a guy who put

14250
03:32:58,550 --> 03:32:58,560
can't do there was a guy who put
 

14251
03:32:58,560 --> 03:33:00,070
can't do there was a guy who put
something out and i was in it i told him

14252
03:33:00,070 --> 03:33:00,080
something out and i was in it i told him
 

14253
03:33:00,080 --> 03:33:01,190
something out and i was in it i told him
you can take it down and you talk to

14254
03:33:01,190 --> 03:33:01,200
you can take it down and you talk to
 

14255
03:33:01,200 --> 03:33:02,389
you can take it down and you talk to
lawyers because i'm not

14256
03:33:02,389 --> 03:33:02,399
lawyers because i'm not
 

14257
03:33:02,399 --> 03:33:04,710
lawyers because i'm not
i'm not supporting you so they use it to

14258
03:33:04,710 --> 03:33:04,720
i'm not supporting you so they use it to
 

14259
03:33:04,720 --> 03:33:06,630
i'm not supporting you so they use it to
tell some kind of narrative that this is

14260
03:33:06,630 --> 03:33:06,640
tell some kind of narrative that this is
 

14261
03:33:06,640 --> 03:33:08,309
tell some kind of narrative that this is
not connected to let's face it if you're

14262
03:33:08,309 --> 03:33:08,319
not connected to let's face it if you're
 

14263
03:33:08,319 --> 03:33:10,469
not connected to let's face it if you're
making tv shows there's two reasons to

14264
03:33:10,469 --> 03:33:10,479
making tv shows there's two reasons to
 

14265
03:33:10,479 --> 03:33:12,070
making tv shows there's two reasons to
do it one you want to get word out

14266
03:33:12,070 --> 03:33:12,080
do it one you want to get word out
 

14267
03:33:12,080 --> 03:33:14,150
do it one you want to get word out
or two you want to make money or three

14268
03:33:14,150 --> 03:33:14,160
or two you want to make money or three
 

14269
03:33:14,160 --> 03:33:16,070
or two you want to make money or three
both and so usually it's

14270
03:33:16,070 --> 03:33:16,080
both and so usually it's
 

14271
03:33:16,080 --> 03:33:18,070
both and so usually it's
i would say the the make money is

14272
03:33:18,070 --> 03:33:18,080
i would say the the make money is
 

14273
03:33:18,080 --> 03:33:19,910
i would say the the make money is
probably the biggest thing to put a tv

14274
03:33:19,910 --> 03:33:19,920
probably the biggest thing to put a tv
 

14275
03:33:19,920 --> 03:33:20,389
probably the biggest thing to put a tv
show out

14276
03:33:20,389 --> 03:33:20,399
show out
 

14277
03:33:20,399 --> 03:33:22,150
show out
and the the mission of the to the stars

14278
03:33:22,150 --> 03:33:22,160
and the the mission of the to the stars
 

14279
03:33:22,160 --> 03:33:23,670
and the the mission of the to the stars
academy is to not do that

14280
03:33:23,670 --> 03:33:23,680
academy is to not do that
 

14281
03:33:23,680 --> 03:33:27,030
academy is to not do that
this is is to try to get some

14282
03:33:27,030 --> 03:33:27,040
this is is to try to get some
 

14283
03:33:27,040 --> 03:33:28,870
this is is to try to get some
when i when they started and i talked to

it was to

14292
03:33:35,030 --> 03:33:35,040
it was to
 

14293
03:33:35,040 --> 03:33:38,150
it was to
basically demystify the fact and get rid

14294
03:33:38,150 --> 03:33:38,160
basically demystify the fact and get rid
 

14295
03:33:38,160 --> 03:33:38,870
basically demystify the fact and get rid
of the

03:33:38,880 --> 03:33:41,349
of the
the stigma that's tied to ufos and let's

14298
03:33:41,349 --> 03:33:41,359
the stigma that's tied to ufos and let's
 

14299
03:33:41,359 --> 03:33:43,030
the stigma that's tied to ufos and let's
look at it from a science base and then

14300
03:33:43,030 --> 03:33:43,040
look at it from a science base and then
 

14301
03:33:43,040 --> 03:33:44,710
look at it from a science base and then
use tv to get the word out on the

14302
03:33:44,710 --> 03:33:44,720
use tv to get the word out on the
 

14303
03:33:44,720 --> 03:33:45,590
use tv to get the word out on the
progress

14304

progress
 

14305
03:33:45,600 --> 03:33:46,950
progress
and they've done some pretty cool things

14306
03:33:46,950 --> 03:33:46,960
and they've done some pretty cool things
 

14307
03:33:46,960 --> 03:33:48,870
and they've done some pretty cool things
i mean you know they've the the italian

talking about
and then using independent scientists

14332
03:34:07,990 --> 03:34:08,000
and then using independent scientists
 

14333
03:34:08,000 --> 03:34:10,070
and then using independent scientists
that are not tied to a government i mean

because you go oh i found this we had
 

14343
03:34:16,000 --> 03:34:17,269
because you go oh i found this we had
this piece of metal what is it and some

14344

i mean let it out i i think he put it
 

14377
03:34:44,560 --> 03:34:45,910
i mean let it out i i think he put it
beautifully that

because you don't know what they're
 

14421
03:35:25,680 --> 03:35:28,070
because you don't know what they're
doing so you got really

doing so you got really
 

14423
03:35:28,080 --> 03:35:31,429
doing so you got really
a couple of theories one you've got e.t

case it is independence that you
 

14437
03:35:43,760 --> 03:35:45,269
case it is independence that you
actually have a game plan

14438

actually have a game plan
 

14439
03:35:45,279 --> 03:35:46,950
actually have a game plan
and when you get into independence day

14440
03:35:46,950 --> 03:35:46,960
and when you get into independence day
 

14441
03:35:46,960 --> 03:35:48,469
and when you get into independence day
that scenario

14442
03:35:48,469 --> 03:35:48,479
that scenario
 

14443
03:35:48,479 --> 03:35:49,990
that scenario
you know and i don't like going too much

into sci-fi but
 

14447
03:35:51,600 --> 03:35:53,190
into sci-fi but
let's just say in theory that that

14448
03:35:53,190 --> 03:35:53,200
let's just say in theory that that
 

14449
03:35:53,200 --> 03:35:55,990
let's just say in theory that that
becomes a reality it's not a us

through this we'll get through it
 

14467
