in the infinite game your most recent

182
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:52,750
in the infinite game your most recent
 

183
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,900
in the infinite game your most recent
book you describe the finite game in the

184
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:54,910
book you describe the finite game in the
 

185
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,240
book you describe the finite game in the
infinite game so from my perspective of

186
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:57,250
infinite game so from my perspective of
 

187
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,660
infinite game so from my perspective of
artificial intelligence and game theory

188
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:00,670
artificial intelligence and game theory
 

189
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,880
artificial intelligence and game theory
in general I'm a huge fan of finite

190
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:02,890
in general I'm a huge fan of finite
 

191

in general I'm a huge fan of finite
games from the broad philosophical sense

192
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:05,110
games from the broad philosophical sense
 

193
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,560
games from the broad philosophical sense
is something that in the robotics

194
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:07,570
is something that in the robotics
 

195
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:08,850
is something that in the robotics
artificial intelligence space we know

196
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:08,860
artificial intelligence space we know
 

197
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,410
artificial intelligence space we know
how to deal with and then you describe

198
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:10,420
how to deal with and then you describe
 

199
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,900
how to deal with and then you describe
the infinite game which has no exact

200
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:12,910
the infinite game which has no exact
 

201
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:16,170
the infinite game which has no exact
static rules has no well-defined static

202
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:16,180
static rules has no well-defined static
 

203
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,599
static rules has no well-defined static
objective as the players are known

204
00:04:18,599 --> 00:04:18,609
objective as the players are known
 

205
00:04:18,609 --> 00:04:20,250
objective as the players are known
unknown they change there's a dynamic

206
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:20,260
unknown they change there's a dynamic
 

207
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,830
unknown they change there's a dynamic
element so this is something that

208
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:22,840
element so this is something that
 

209
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,910
element so this is something that
applies to business politics life itself

210
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:26,920
applies to business politics life itself

applies to business politics life itself
so can you try to articulate the

212
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:30,310
so can you try to articulate the
 

213
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,390
so can you try to articulate the
objective function here of the infinite

214
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:33,400
objective function here of the infinite
 

215
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,780
objective function here of the infinite

217
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:40,710
game or in the in the cliche broad
philosophical sense what is the meaning

218
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:40,720
philosophical sense what is the meaning
 

219
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,520
philosophical sense what is the meaning
of life go for the start with a soft

so James Carr was the philosopher who

224
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:50,860
so James Carr was the philosopher who
 

225
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,380
so James Carr was the philosopher who
originally articulated this concept of

226
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:52,390
originally articulated this concept of
 

227
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:55,409
originally articulated this concept of
finite and infinite games and when I

228
00:04:55,409 --> 00:04:55,419
finite and infinite games and when I
 

229
00:04:55,419 --> 00:04:57,710
finite and infinite games and when I
learned about it it really challenged my

230
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:57,720
learned about it it really challenged my
 

231
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,940
learned about it it really challenged my
view of how the world works right

232
00:04:59,940 --> 00:04:59,950
view of how the world works right
 

233
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,980
view of how the world works right
because I think we all think about

234
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:01,990
because I think we all think about
 

235
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,480
because I think we all think about
winning and being the best and being

236
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:03,490
winning and being the best and being
 

237
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,420
winning and being the best and being
number one but if you think about it

238
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:05,430
number one but if you think about it
 

239
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,920
number one but if you think about it
only in a finite game can that exist a

240
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:07,930
only in a finite game can that exist a
 

241
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,530
only in a finite game can that exist a

a winner that has to be a loser infinite

games as cars describes them as you said
 

253
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,980
games as cars describes them as you said
have known and unknown players which

changeable rules which means you can

258
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:26,680
changeable rules which means you can
 

259
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,470
changeable rules which means you can
play however you want and the objective

260
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:28,480
play however you want and the objective
 

261
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,760
play however you want and the objective
is to perpetuate the game to stay in the

262
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:29,770
is to perpetuate the game to stay in the
 

263
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,520
is to perpetuate the game to stay in the
game as long as possible in other words

there's no such thing as being number

266
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:33,669
there's no such thing as being number
 

267
00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:35,400
there's no such thing as being number
one or winning in a game that has no

00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:35,410
one or winning in a game that has no
 

269
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,850
one or winning in a game that has no
finish line and what I learned is that

270
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:37,860
finish line and what I learned is that
 

271
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,310
finish line and what I learned is that
when we try to win in a game that has no

00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:41,320
when we try to win in a game that has no
 

273

when we try to win in a game that has no
finish line we try and be number we try

finish line we try and be number we try
 

275
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,570
finish line we try and be number we try
to be the best in a game that has no

00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:45,580
to be the best in a game that has no

279
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,680
agreed-upon objectives or agreed-upon
metrics or timeframes there's a few

280
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:49,690
metrics or timeframes there's a few
 

281
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,900
metrics or timeframes there's a few
consistent and predictable outcomes the

282
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:51,910
consistent and predictable outcomes the
 

283
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,730
consistent and predictable outcomes the
decline of trust the decline the decline

284
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:53,740
decline of trust the decline the decline
 

285
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,909
decline of trust the decline the decline
of cooperation the decline of innovation

of cooperation the decline of innovation
 

287
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,420
of cooperation the decline of innovation
and I find this fascinating because so

288
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:00,430
and I find this fascinating because so
 

289
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,740
and I find this fascinating because so
many of the ways that we run most

290
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:01,750
many of the ways that we run most

you're trying to reduce the beautiful

294

you're trying to reduce the beautiful
 

295
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,859
you're trying to reduce the beautiful
complex thing that is life or what

politics or business into something very
 

299
00:06:10,559 --> 00:06:13,619
politics or business into something very
narrow and in that process the

00:06:13,619 --> 00:06:13,629
narrow and in that process the
 

301
00:06:13,629 --> 00:06:15,570
narrow and in that process the
reductionist process you lose something

302
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:15,580
reductionist process you lose something
 

303
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,169
reductionist process you lose something
fundamental that makes the whole thing

going to let you off the hook easy what
 

309
00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:27,600
going to let you off the hook easy what
is the meaning of life so what is the

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:27,610
is the meaning of life so what is the
 

311
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:30,329
is the meaning of life so what is the
objective function that is worthwhile to

objective function that is worthwhile to
 

313
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:32,760

pursue well if you think about our

as well and if you have a lot of success
 

479
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,300
as well and if you have a lot of success
then you have a lot of iceberg and

480
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:40,310
then you have a lot of iceberg and
 

481
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:41,379
then you have a lot of iceberg and
people can see this huge iceberg and

482
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:41,389
people can see this huge iceberg and
 

483
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:43,259
people can see this huge iceberg and
they say you've accomplished so much but

484
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:43,269
they say you've accomplished so much but
 

485
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:46,090
they say you've accomplished so much but
but what I see is all the work still yet

486
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:46,100
but what I see is all the work still yet
 

487
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,100
but what I see is all the work still yet
to be done yet I still see the huge

488
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:48,110
to be done yet I still see the huge
 

489
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:50,110
to be done yet I still see the huge
iceberg underneath the ocean and so the

490
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:50,120
iceberg underneath the ocean and so the
 

491
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,430
iceberg underneath the ocean and so the
growth you talk about momentum so the

492
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:53,440
growth you talk about momentum so the
 

493
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,740
growth you talk about momentum so the
incremental revealing of the iceberg is

494
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:56,750
incremental revealing of the iceberg is
 

495
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,650
incremental revealing of the iceberg is
what drives you well it necessarily is

496
00:09:59,650 --> 00:09:59,660
what drives you well it necessarily is
 

497
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,840
what drives you well it necessarily is
incremental what drives me is that is

498
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:01,850
incremental what drives me is that is
 

499
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:04,930
incremental what drives me is that is
the realization is every is realizing

500
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:04,940
the realization is every is realizing
 

501
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,490
the realization is every is realizing
the iceberg bringing more of the iceberg

502
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:06,500
the iceberg bringing more of the iceberg
 

503
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,290
the iceberg bringing more of the iceberg
from the unknown to the known bringing

504
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:08,300
from the unknown to the known bringing
 

505
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,329
from the unknown to the known bringing
more of the vision from the imagination

506
00:10:10,329 --> 00:10:10,339
more of the vision from the imagination
 

507
00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:13,689
more of the vision from the imagination
to reality and you have this fundamental

508
00:10:13,689 --> 00:10:13,699
to reality and you have this fundamental
 

509
00:10:13,699 --> 00:10:16,150
to reality and you have this fundamental
vision of optimism you call yourself an

about making you money remember we live
in a world right now where a lot of

1108
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:25,030
in a world right now where a lot of
 

1109
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:27,360
in a world right now where a lot of
people rather a few people are getting

1110
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:27,370
people rather a few people are getting
 

1111
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:30,419
people rather a few people are getting
rich on the hard work of others and so I

1112
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:30,429
rich on the hard work of others and so I
 

1113
00:22:30,429 --> 00:22:32,910
rich on the hard work of others and so I
think when when when people look up and

1114
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:32,920
think when when when people look up and
 

1115
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,500
think when when when people look up and
say well why would I do that

1116
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:34,510
say well why would I do that
 

1117
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,299
say well why would I do that
I'll just if you're not gonna look after

1118
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:36,309
I'll just if you're not gonna look after
 

1119
00:22:36,309 --> 00:22:37,620
I'll just if you're not gonna look after
me and then you're gonna lay me off at

1120
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:37,630
me and then you're gonna lay me off at
 

1121
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:38,700
me and then you're gonna lay me off at
the end of the year because you missed

1122
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:38,710
the end of the year because you missed
 

1123
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,620
the end of the year because you missed
your arbitrary projections you know

1124
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:40,630
your arbitrary projections you know
 

1125
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,180
your arbitrary projections you know
you're gonna lay me off because you

1126
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:42,190
you're gonna lay me off because you
 

1127
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:44,040
you're gonna lay me off because you
missed your arbitrary projections then

1128
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:44,050
missed your arbitrary projections then
 

1129
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:45,930

why would I be offer my hard work and

1130

1131
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:49,080

we can immediately blame people for

1134
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:50,740
we can immediately blame people for
 

1135
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:54,299
we can immediately blame people for
going soft I think we can blame leaders

1136
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:54,309
going soft I think we can blame leaders
 

1137
00:22:54,309 --> 00:22:57,810
going soft I think we can blame leaders
for their inability or failure to offer

1138
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:57,820
for their inability or failure to offer
 

1139
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:00,780
for their inability or failure to offer
their people something bigger than them

1140
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:00,790
their people something bigger than them
 

1141
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,850
their people something bigger than them
making a product or making money yeah

1142
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:02,860
making a product or making money yeah
 

1143
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,950
making a product or making money yeah
that's so that's that's brilliant and

1144
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:04,960
that's so that's that's brilliant and
 

1145
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,460
that's so that's that's brilliant and
start with why leaders elast your books

1146
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:07,470
start with why leaders elast your books
 

1147
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:10,620
start with why leaders elast your books
you kind of you but you basically talk

1148
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:10,630
you kind of you but you basically talk
 

1149
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:13,440
you kind of you but you basically talk
about what it what it takes to be a good

1150
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:13,450
about what it what it takes to be a good
 

1151
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:15,120
about what it what it takes to be a good
leader and so some of the blame should

1152
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:15,130
leader and so some of the blame should
 

1153
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,680
leader and so some of the blame should
go on the leader but how much of it is

1154
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:16,690
go on the leader but how much of it is

talking about autopilot one we're
 

1423
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,320
talking about autopilot one we're
talking about some of the hardware

1424
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:30,330
talking about some of the hardware
 

1425
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:33,500
talking about some of the hardware
engineering and they they do some of the

1426

how do you balance that in terms of what
 

1431
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,990
how do you balance that in terms of what
it takes to be a good leader what it

1432

difference between someone who can get a
lot about it get a lot out of people in
