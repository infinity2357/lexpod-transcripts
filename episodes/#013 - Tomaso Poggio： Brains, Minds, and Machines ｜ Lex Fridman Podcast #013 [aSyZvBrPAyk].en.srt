much the work for the Patent Office but
 

131
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:08,699

00:03:55,939 --> 00:03:55,949
mentioned the possibility of time travel
 

165
00:03:55,949 --> 00:03:59,009
mentioned the possibility of time travel
so the most out-of-the-box question I

166
00:03:59,009 --> 00:03:59,019
so the most out-of-the-box question I
 

167
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:00,809
so the most out-of-the-box question I
think I'll get to ask today do you think

168
00:04:00,809 --> 00:04:00,819
think I'll get to ask today do you think
 

169
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:04,080
think I'll get to ask today do you think
time travel is possible well it would be

170
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,090
time travel is possible well it would be
 

171
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,289
time travel is possible well it would be
nice if it were possible right now

172
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:06,299
nice if it were possible right now
 

173
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:11,930
nice if it were possible right now
you know you in science you never say no

174
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:11,940
you know you in science you never say no
 

175
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,280
you know you in science you never say no
but your understanding of the nature of

176
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:14,290
but your understanding of the nature of
 

177
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:18,000
but your understanding of the nature of
time yeah it's very likely that it's not

178
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,010
time yeah it's very likely that it's not
 

179
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:22,740
time yeah it's very likely that it's not
possible to travel in time you may be

180
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:22,750
possible to travel in time you may be
 

181
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:26,070
possible to travel in time you may be
able to travel forward in time

182
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:26,080
able to travel forward in time
 

183
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,249
able to travel forward in time
if we can for instance freeze ourselves

184
00:04:29,249 --> 00:04:29,259
if we can for instance freeze ourselves
 

185
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:33,210
if we can for instance freeze ourselves
or you know go on some spacecraft

186
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:33,220
or you know go on some spacecraft
 

187
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,189
or you know go on some spacecraft
traveling close to the speed of light

188
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:37,199
traveling close to the speed of light
 

189
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,070
traveling close to the speed of light
but in terms of activity traveling for

190
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,080
but in terms of activity traveling for
 

191
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,029
but in terms of activity traveling for
instance back in time I find probably

192
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:44,039
instance back in time I find probably
 

193
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:47,179
instance back in time I find probably
very unlikely so do you still hold the

194
00:04:47,179 --> 00:04:47,189
very unlikely so do you still hold the
 

195
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:50,300
very unlikely so do you still hold the
underlying dream of the engineering

196
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:50,310
underlying dream of the engineering
 

197
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:53,239
underlying dream of the engineering
intelligence that will build systems

198
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:53,249
intelligence that will build systems
 

199
00:04:53,249 --> 00:04:57,010
intelligence that will build systems
that are able to do such huge leaps like

200
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:57,020
that are able to do such huge leaps like
 

201
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,619
that are able to do such huge leaps like
discovering the kind of mechanism that

202
00:05:00,619 --> 00:05:00,629
discovering the kind of mechanism that
 

203
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:02,239
discovering the kind of mechanism that
would be required to travel through time

204
00:05:02,239 --> 00:05:02,249
would be required to travel through time
 

205
00:05:02,249 --> 00:05:04,730
would be required to travel through time
do you still hold that dream or are

206
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:04,740
do you still hold that dream or are
 

207
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,700
do you still hold that dream or are
echoes of it from your childhood yeah I

208
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:07,710
echoes of it from your childhood yeah I
 

209
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,219
echoes of it from your childhood yeah I
you know I don't think whether there are

210
00:05:10,219 --> 00:05:10,229
you know I don't think whether there are
 

211
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:13,820
you know I don't think whether there are
certain problems that probably cannot be

212
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:13,830
certain problems that probably cannot be
 

213
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,760
certain problems that probably cannot be
solved depending what what you believe

214
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:16,770
solved depending what what you believe
 

215
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,909
solved depending what what you believe
about the physical reality like you know

216
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:19,919
about the physical reality like you know
 

217
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,670
about the physical reality like you know
maybe totally impossible to create

218
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:22,680
maybe totally impossible to create
 

219
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,839
maybe totally impossible to create
energy from nothing or to travel back in

220
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:26,849
energy from nothing or to travel back in
 

221
00:05:26,849 --> 00:05:33,170
energy from nothing or to travel back in
time but about making machines that can

222
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:33,180
time but about making machines that can
 

223
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,579
time but about making machines that can
think as well as we do or better or more

224
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:37,589
think as well as we do or better or more
 

225
00:05:37,589 --> 00:05:39,499
think as well as we do or better or more
likely especially in the short and

226
00:05:39,499 --> 00:05:39,509
likely especially in the short and
 

227
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:42,769
likely especially in the short and
midterm helped us think better which is

228
00:05:42,769 --> 00:05:42,779
midterm helped us think better which is
 

229
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:44,629
midterm helped us think better which is
in a sense is happening already with the

230
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:44,639
in a sense is happening already with the
 

231
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,059
in a sense is happening already with the
computers we have and it will happen

232
00:05:47,059 --> 00:05:47,069
computers we have and it will happen
 

233
00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:49,279
computers we have and it will happen
more and more but that I certainly

234
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:49,289
more and more but that I certainly
 

235
00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:52,179
more and more but that I certainly
believe and I don't see in principle why

236
00:05:52,179 --> 00:05:52,189
believe and I don't see in principle why
 

237
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:56,450
believe and I don't see in principle why
computers at some point could not become

238
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:56,460
computers at some point could not become
 

239
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,779
computers at some point could not become
more intelligent than we are although

240
00:05:59,779 --> 00:05:59,789
more intelligent than we are although
 

241
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:03,079
more intelligent than we are although
the word intelligence it's a tricky one

242
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:03,089
the word intelligence it's a tricky one
 

243
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:06,409
the word intelligence it's a tricky one
and one who should discuss which I mean

244
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:06,419
and one who should discuss which I mean
 

245
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:08,839
and one who should discuss which I mean
with that in intelligence consciousness

246
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:08,849
with that in intelligence consciousness
 

247
00:06:08,849 --> 00:06:13,790
with that in intelligence consciousness
yeah words like love is all these are

248
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:13,800
yeah words like love is all these are
 

249
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,649
yeah words like love is all these are
very you know you need to be

250
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:15,659
very you know you need to be
 

251
00:06:15,659 --> 00:06:17,809
very you know you need to be
disentangled so you've mentioned also

252
00:06:17,809 --> 00:06:17,819
disentangled so you've mentioned also
 

253
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:19,339
disentangled so you've mentioned also
that you believe the problem of

254
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:19,349
that you believe the problem of
 

255
00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:22,309
that you believe the problem of
intelligence is the greatest problem in

256
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:22,319
intelligence is the greatest problem in
 

257
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,290
intelligence is the greatest problem in
science greater than the origin of life

258
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:24,300
science greater than the origin of life
 

259
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,769
science greater than the origin of life
and the origin the universe you've also

260
00:06:27,769 --> 00:06:27,779
and the origin the universe you've also
 

261
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:31,219
and the origin the universe you've also
in the talk I've listened to said that

262
00:06:31,219 --> 00:06:31,229
in the talk I've listened to said that
 

263
00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:34,369
in the talk I've listened to said that
you're open to arguments against against

264
00:06:34,369 --> 00:06:34,379
you're open to arguments against against
 

265
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:38,300
you're open to arguments against against
you so what do you think is the most

266
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:38,310
you so what do you think is the most
 

267
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:41,450
you so what do you think is the most
captivating aspect of this problem of

268
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:41,460
captivating aspect of this problem of
 

269
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,189
captivating aspect of this problem of
understanding the nature of intelligence

270
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:43,199
understanding the nature of intelligence
 

271
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,950
understanding the nature of intelligence
why does it captivate you as it does

272
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:46,960
why does it captivate you as it does
 

273
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,590
why does it captivate you as it does
well originally I think one of the

274
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:49,600
well originally I think one of the
 

275
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,730
well originally I think one of the
motivation that I had as I guess a

276
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:53,740
motivation that I had as I guess a
 

277
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,689
motivation that I had as I guess a
teenager when I was infatuated with

278
00:06:56,689 --> 00:06:56,699
teenager when I was infatuated with
 

279
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:00,409
teenager when I was infatuated with
theory of relativity was really that I I

280
00:07:00,409 --> 00:07:00,419
theory of relativity was really that I I
 

281
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:04,770
theory of relativity was really that I I
found that there was the problem of time

282
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:04,780
found that there was the problem of time
 

283
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,189
found that there was the problem of time
and space and general relativity but

284
00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:08,199
and space and general relativity but
 

285
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:10,170
and space and general relativity but
there were so many other problems of the

286
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:10,180
there were so many other problems of the
 

287
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,409
there were so many other problems of the
same level of difficulty and importance

288
00:07:13,409 --> 00:07:13,419
same level of difficulty and importance
 

289
00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:16,710
same level of difficulty and importance
that I could even if I were I stein it

290
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:16,720
that I could even if I were I stein it
 

291
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,570
that I could even if I were I stein it
was difficult to hope to solve all of

292
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:18,580
was difficult to hope to solve all of
 

293
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:22,020
was difficult to hope to solve all of
them so what about solving a problem

294
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:22,030
them so what about solving a problem
 

295
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:25,620
them so what about solving a problem
whose solution allowed me to solve all

296
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:25,630
whose solution allowed me to solve all
 

297
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:28,589
whose solution allowed me to solve all
the problems and this was what if we

298
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:28,599
the problems and this was what if we
 

299
00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:32,490
the problems and this was what if we
could find the key to an intelligence

300
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:32,500
could find the key to an intelligence
 

301
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,010
could find the key to an intelligence
you know ten times better or faster than

302
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:35,020
you know ten times better or faster than
 

303
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,700
you know ten times better or faster than
Einstein so that's sort of seeing

304
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:38,710
Einstein so that's sort of seeing
 

305
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:41,100
Einstein so that's sort of seeing
artificial intelligence as a tool to

306
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:41,110
artificial intelligence as a tool to
 

307
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:44,719
artificial intelligence as a tool to
expand our capabilities but is there

308
00:07:44,719 --> 00:07:44,729
expand our capabilities but is there
 

309
00:07:44,729 --> 00:07:48,089
expand our capabilities but is there
just an inherent curiosity in you and

310
00:07:48,089 --> 00:07:48,099
just an inherent curiosity in you and
 

311
00:07:48,099 --> 00:07:51,270
just an inherent curiosity in you and
just understanding what is in our in

312
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:51,280
just understanding what is in our in
 

313
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,600
just understanding what is in our in
here that makes it all all work yes

314
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:54,610
here that makes it all all work yes
 

315
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:57,000
here that makes it all all work yes
absolutely all right so I was starting I

316
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,010
absolutely all right so I was starting I
 

317
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,920
absolutely all right so I was starting I
started saying this was the motivation

318
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:58,930
started saying this was the motivation
 

319
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:02,279
started saying this was the motivation
when I was a teenager but you know soon

320
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:02,289
when I was a teenager but you know soon
 

321
00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:06,149
when I was a teenager but you know soon
after I think the problem of human

322
00:08:06,149 --> 00:08:06,159
after I think the problem of human
 

323
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:11,399
after I think the problem of human
intelligence became a real focus of you

324
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:11,409
intelligence became a real focus of you
 

325
00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:14,430
intelligence became a real focus of you
know of my sent my science and my

326
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:14,440
know of my sent my science and my
 

327
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:20,550
know of my sent my science and my
research because I think he's for me the

328
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:20,560
research because I think he's for me the
 

329
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,969
research because I think he's for me the
most interesting problem is really

330
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:22,979
most interesting problem is really
 

331
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:29,240
most interesting problem is really
asking oh we we are right is asking not

332
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:29,250
asking oh we we are right is asking not
 

333
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,279
asking oh we we are right is asking not
only a question about science but even

334
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:32,289
only a question about science but even
 

335
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:35,219
only a question about science but even
about the very tool we are using to do

336
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:35,229
about the very tool we are using to do
 

337
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:38,430
about the very tool we are using to do
science which is our brain how does our

338
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:38,440
science which is our brain how does our
 

339
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,360
science which is our brain how does our
brain work from where does it come from

340
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:41,370
brain work from where does it come from
 

341
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:44,370
brain work from where does it come from
after its limitation can we make it

342
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:44,380
after its limitation can we make it
 

343
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:44,819
after its limitation can we make it
better

344
00:08:44,819 --> 00:08:44,829
better
 

345

effort of science so you've made
 

351
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,940

00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:09,059
do you think we can get in creating
intelligent systems without

00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:17,199
put another way do you think we can
 

371
00:09:17,199 --> 00:09:19,079
put another way do you think we can
build a strong-ass system without really

like flying without really using too

382
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:39,639
like flying without really using too
 

383
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:43,789
like flying without really using too
much our knowledge about how birds fly

384
00:09:43,789 --> 00:09:43,799
much our knowledge about how birds fly
 

385
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:46,739
much our knowledge about how birds fly
it was important I guess to know that

386
00:09:46,739 --> 00:09:46,749
it was important I guess to know that
 

387
00:09:46,749 --> 00:09:50,639
it was important I guess to know that
you could have things heavier than than

388
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:50,649
you could have things heavier than than
 

389

you could have things heavier than than
air being able to fly like like birds

390
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:54,429
air being able to fly like like birds
 

391
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:58,829
air being able to fly like like birds
but beyond that probably we did not

392
00:09:58,829 --> 00:09:58,839
but beyond that probably we did not
 

393
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:01,759
but beyond that probably we did not
learn very much you know some you know

394
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:01,769
learn very much you know some you know
 

395
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:06,090
learn very much you know some you know
the brothers right did learn a lot of

396
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:06,100
the brothers right did learn a lot of
 

397
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,230
the brothers right did learn a lot of
observation about birds and designing

398
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:09,240
observation about birds and designing
 

399
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,710
observation about birds and designing
their their aircraft but you know you

400
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:13,720
their their aircraft but you know you
 

401
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,019

can argue we did not use much of biology

402
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:16,029
can argue we did not use much of biology
 

403
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:18,600
can argue we did not use much of biology
in that particular case now in the case

404
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:18,610
in that particular case now in the case
 

405
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:25,410
in that particular case now in the case
of intelligence I think that it's it's a

406
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:25,420
of intelligence I think that it's it's a
 

407
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,810
of intelligence I think that it's it's a
bit of a bet right now

408
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:28,820
bit of a bet right now
 

409
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:34,330
bit of a bet right now
if you are if you ask okay we we all

410
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:34,340
if you are if you ask okay we we all
 

411
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,820
if you are if you ask okay we we all
agree we'll get at some point maybe soon

412
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:36,830
agree we'll get at some point maybe soon
 

413
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:39,580
agree we'll get at some point maybe soon
maybe later to a machine that is

414
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:39,590
maybe later to a machine that is
 

415
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:42,640
maybe later to a machine that is
indistinguishable from my secretary say

416
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:42,650
indistinguishable from my secretary say
 

417
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,860
indistinguishable from my secretary say
in terms of what I can ask the machine

418
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:44,870
in terms of what I can ask the machine
 

419
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:49,390
in terms of what I can ask the machine
to do I think we get there and now the

420
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:49,400
to do I think we get there and now the
 

421
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,060
to do I think we get there and now the
question is and you can ask people do

422
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:52,070
question is and you can ask people do
 

423
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,770
question is and you can ask people do
you think we'll get there without any

424
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:53,780
you think we'll get there without any
 

425
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,530
you think we'll get there without any
knowledge about you know the human brain

426
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:56,540
knowledge about you know the human brain
 

427
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,830
knowledge about you know the human brain
or that is the best way to get there is

428
00:10:59,830 --> 00:10:59,840
or that is the best way to get there is
 

429
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,690
or that is the best way to get there is
to understand better the human brain

430
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:01,700
to understand better the human brain
 

431
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,200
to understand better the human brain
yeah okay this is I think an educated

432
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,210
yeah okay this is I think an educated
 

433
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:07,960
yeah okay this is I think an educated
bet that different people with different

00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:25,170
to the brain you have networks of
 

559
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,439
to the brain you have networks of
neurons which is what the brain is about

560
00:14:27,439 --> 00:14:27,449
neurons which is what the brain is about
 

561
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:31,009
neurons which is what the brain is about
and the artificial neurons in the models

and the artificial neurons in the models
 

563
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:34,100
and the artificial neurons in the models
are as I said caricature of the

00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:34,110
are as I said caricature of the
 

565
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:36,259
are as I said caricature of the
biological neurons but they're still

00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:38,610
can you talk about what are the

there was a phase in neuroscience by
 

879
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:17,960
there was a phase in neuroscience by
in the 1950 or so in which it was

00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:23,090
believed for a while that the brain was
equipotential this was the term you

884
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:23,100
equipotential this was the term you
 

885
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:27,560
equipotential this was the term you
could cut out a piece and nothing

Lashley did a lot of experiments of this

892
00:23:38,659 --> 00:23:38,669
Lashley did a lot of experiments of this
 

893
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:43,220
Lashley did a lot of experiments of this
type with mice and rats and concluded

894
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:43,230
type with mice and rats and concluded
 

895
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:45,799
type with mice and rats and concluded
that every part of the brain was

896
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:45,809
that every part of the brain was
 

897
00:23:45,809 --> 00:23:50,920
that every part of the brain was
essentially equivalent to any other one

898

899
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,920

it turns out that that's that's really

900
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:53,930
it turns out that that's that's really
 

901
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:57,600
it turns out that that's that's really
not true it's there are very specific

902
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:57,610
not true it's there are very specific
 

903
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:01,930
not true it's there are very specific
modules in the brain as you said and you

904
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:01,940
modules in the brain as you said and you
 

905
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,450
modules in the brain as you said and you
know people may lose the ability to

906
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:04,460
know people may lose the ability to
 

907
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:07,030
know people may lose the ability to
speak if you have a stroke in a certain

in another region or so they're very
 

913
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:16,330
in another region or so they're very
specific the brain is also quite

914
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:16,340
specific the brain is also quite
 

915
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,970
specific the brain is also quite
flexible and redundant so often it can

916
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:18,980
flexible and redundant so often it can
 

917
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:25,470
flexible and redundant so often it can
correct things and you know the kind of

918
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:25,480
correct things and you know the kind of
 

919
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,960
correct things and you know the kind of

there are specific modules of the answer
 

925
00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:39,940
there are specific modules of the answer
that we know from this old work which

00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:39,950
that we know from this old work which
 

927
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:43,870
that we know from this old work which
was basically on based on lesions either

928
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:43,880
was basically on based on lesions either
 

929
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,720
was basically on based on lesions either
on animals or very often there were a

00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:55,940
interesting data coming from from the
 

935
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:59,620

injuries that soldiers had in the brain

938
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:03,320
injuries that soldiers had in the brain
 

939
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:09,250
injuries that soldiers had in the brain
and more recently functional MRI which

940
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:09,260
and more recently functional MRI which
 

941
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:13,390
and more recently functional MRI which
allow you to to check which part of the

942
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:13,400
allow you to to check which part of the
 

943
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,419
allow you to to check which part of the
brain are active when you are doing

944
00:25:16,419 --> 00:25:16,429
brain are active when you are doing
 

945
00:25:16,429 --> 00:25:22,299
brain are active when you are doing
different tasks as you know can replace

946
00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:22,309
different tasks as you know can replace
 

947
00:25:22,309 --> 00:25:24,760
different tasks as you know can replace
some of this you can see that certain

948
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:24,770
some of this you can see that certain
 

949
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:27,669
some of this you can see that certain
parts of the brain are involved or

950
00:25:27,669 --> 00:25:27,679
parts of the brain are involved or
 

951
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,390
parts of the brain are involved or
active in this language yeah yeah that's

952
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:31,400
active in this language yeah yeah that's
 

953
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:31,720
active in this language yeah yeah that's
right

954
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:31,730
right
 

955
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:35,100
right
but sort of taking a step back to that

956
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:35,110
but sort of taking a step back to that
 

957
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:37,650
but sort of taking a step back to that
part of the brain that discovers that

958
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:37,660
part of the brain that discovers that
 

959
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,850
part of the brain that discovers that
specializes in the face and how that

960
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:39,860
specializes in the face and how that
 

961
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,990
specializes in the face and how that
might be learned what's your intuition

962

sense reasoning do you have an intuition

980
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:03,640
sense reasoning do you have an intuition
 

981
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,550
sense reasoning do you have an intuition
that that kind of learning is going on

982
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:05,560
that that kind of learning is going on
 

983
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,350
that that kind of learning is going on
really quickly or is it really kind of

question so there are parts of the brain

988
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:13,950
question so there are parts of the brain
 

989
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:18,140
question so there are parts of the brain
like the cerebellum or they put campus

990
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:18,150
like the cerebellum or they put campus
 

991
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:21,270
like the cerebellum or they put campus
that are quite different from each other

992
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:21,280
that are quite different from each other
 

993
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,430
that are quite different from each other
they clearly have different Anatomy

994
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:23,440
they clearly have different Anatomy
 

995
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,390
they clearly have different Anatomy
different connectivity that then there

996
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:27,400
different connectivity that then there
 

997
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:32,610
different connectivity that then there
is the cortex which is the most

998
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:32,620
is the cortex which is the most
 

999
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:35,000
is the cortex which is the most
developed part of the brain in humans

1000
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,010
developed part of the brain in humans
 

1001
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:39,000
developed part of the brain in humans
and in the cortex you have different

1002
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,010
and in the cortex you have different
 

1003
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:41,340
and in the cortex you have different
regions of the cortex that are

1004
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:41,350
regions of the cortex that are
 

1005
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:44,730
regions of the cortex that are
responsible for vision for audition for

motor control for language now one of

1008
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:48,430
motor control for language now one of
 

1009
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:51,480
motor control for language now one of
the big puzzles of of this is that in

1010
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:51,490
the big puzzles of of this is that in
 

1011
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:54,540
the big puzzles of of this is that in
the cortex is the cortex is the cortex

1012
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:54,550
the cortex is the cortex is the cortex
 

1013
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:59,660
the cortex is the cortex is the cortex
it looks like it is the same in terms of

1014
00:26:59,660 --> 00:26:59,670
it looks like it is the same in terms of
 

1015
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:03,500
it looks like it is the same in terms of
hardware in terms of type of neurons and

1016
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:03,510
hardware in terms of type of neurons and
 

1017
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:06,290
hardware in terms of type of neurons and
connectivity across these different

1018
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:06,300
connectivity across these different
 

1019
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:11,760
connectivity across these different
modalities so for the cortex letting

1020
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:11,770
modalities so for the cortex letting
 

1021
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:14,130
modalities so for the cortex letting
aside these other parts of the brain

1022
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:14,140
aside these other parts of the brain
 

1023
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,170
aside these other parts of the brain
like spinal cord upon campus or bedroom

1024
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:16,180
like spinal cord upon campus or bedroom
 

1025
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:19,950
like spinal cord upon campus or bedroom
and so on for the cortex I think your

1026
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:19,960
and so on for the cortex I think your
 

1027
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,580
and so on for the cortex I think your
question about hardware and software and

1028
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:22,590
question about hardware and software and
 

1029
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:26,210
question about hardware and software and
learning and so on it's it I think is

1030
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:26,220
learning and so on it's it I think is
 

1031
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:31,560
learning and so on it's it I think is
rather open and you know it I find very

1032
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:31,570
rather open and you know it I find very
 

1033
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:34,620
rather open and you know it I find very
interesting for easy to think about an

1034
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:34,630
interesting for easy to think about an
 

1035
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:36,930
interesting for easy to think about an
architecture computer architecture that

1036
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:36,940
architecture computer architecture that
 

1037
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:39,600
architecture computer architecture that
is good for vision and the symptom is

1038
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:39,610
is good for vision and the symptom is
 

1039
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:42,360
is good for vision and the symptom is
good for language seems to be you know

1040
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:42,370
good for language seems to be you know
 

1041
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:47,370
good for language seems to be you know
so different problem areas that you have

1042
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:47,380
so different problem areas that you have
 

1043
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:50,550
so different problem areas that you have
to solve but the underlying mechanism

1044
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:50,560
to solve but the underlying mechanism
 

1045
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,840
to solve but the underlying mechanism
might be the same that's really

1046
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:51,850
might be the same that's really
 

1047
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:53,940
might be the same that's really
instructive for it maybe artificial

1048
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:53,950
instructive for it maybe artificial
 

1049
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:56,370
instructive for it maybe artificial
neural networks so you've done a lot of

1050
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:56,380
neural networks so you've done a lot of
 

1051
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:59,120
neural networks so you've done a lot of
great work in vision and human vision

1052
00:27:59,120 --> 00:27:59,130
great work in vision and human vision
 

1053
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:02,520
great work in vision and human vision
computer vision and you mentioned the

1054
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:02,530
computer vision and you mentioned the
 

1055
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:05,070
computer vision and you mentioned the
problem of human vision is really as

1056
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:05,080
problem of human vision is really as
 

1057
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,720
problem of human vision is really as
difficult as the problem of general

1058
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:06,730
difficult as the problem of general
 

1059
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:08,520
difficult as the problem of general
intelligence and maybe that connects to

1060
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:08,530
intelligence and maybe that connects to
 

1061
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:12,570
intelligence and maybe that connects to
the cortex discussion can you describe

1062
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:12,580
the cortex discussion can you describe
 

1063
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:15,549
the cortex discussion can you describe
the human visual cortex

1064
00:28:15,549 --> 00:28:15,559
the human visual cortex
 

1065
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:18,850
the human visual cortex
and how the humans begin to understand

1066
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:18,860
and how the humans begin to understand
 

1067
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:21,310
and how the humans begin to understand
the world through the raw sensory

1068
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:21,320
the world through the raw sensory
 

1069

vision side we don't often actually take

1074
00:28:31,629 --> 00:28:31,639
vision side we don't often actually take
 

1075
00:28:31,639 --> 00:28:33,639
vision side we don't often actually take
a step back except saying what the

1076
00:28:33,639 --> 00:28:33,649
a step back except saying what the
 

1077
00:28:33,649 --> 00:28:35,649
a step back except saying what the
sentence or two that one is inspired by

1078
00:28:35,649 --> 00:28:35,659
sentence or two that one is inspired by
 

1079
00:28:35,659 --> 00:28:37,930
sentence or two that one is inspired by
the other well what is it that we know

1080
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:37,940
the other well what is it that we know
 

1081
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,149
the other well what is it that we know
about the human visual cortex that's

1082
00:28:40,149 --> 00:28:40,159
about the human visual cortex that's
 

1083
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,190
about the human visual cortex that's
interest so we know quite a bit at the

00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:42,200
interest so we know quite a bit at the
 

1085
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,869
interest so we know quite a bit at the
same time we don't know a lot but the

00:28:43,869 --> 00:28:43,879
same time we don't know a lot but the
 

1087
00:28:43,879 --> 00:28:48,100
same time we don't know a lot but the
the bit we know you know in a sense we

in terms of general neuroscience
 

1099
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:06,730
in terms of general neuroscience
forgetting vision you know why do we

1100
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:06,740
forgetting vision you know why do we
 

1101
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:12,430
forgetting vision you know why do we
sleep it's such a basic question and we

1102
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:12,440
sleep it's such a basic question and we
 

1103
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,680
sleep it's such a basic question and we
really don't have an answer to that do

1104
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:14,690
really don't have an answer to that do
 

1105
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:17,109
really don't have an answer to that do
you think so taking a step back on that

1106
00:29:17,109 --> 00:29:17,119
you think so taking a step back on that
 

1107
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:18,970
you think so taking a step back on that
so sleep for examples fascinating do you

1108
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:18,980
so sleep for examples fascinating do you
 

1109
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:21,970
so sleep for examples fascinating do you
think that's a neuroscience question or

1110
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:21,980
think that's a neuroscience question or
 

1111
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:25,269
think that's a neuroscience question or
if we talk about abstractions what do

1112
00:29:25,269 --> 00:29:25,279
if we talk about abstractions what do
 

1113
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,190
if we talk about abstractions what do
you think is an interesting way to study

does it mean to understand the computer
 

1137
00:29:56,029 --> 00:29:58,989
does it mean to understand the computer
right that's much simpler but in a

that are also operating under windows
 

1169
00:30:43,999 --> 00:30:46,949
that are also operating under windows
and have PowerPoint do you think it's

1170
00:30:46,949 --> 00:30:46,959
and have PowerPoint do you think it's
 

1171
00:30:46,959 --> 00:30:50,379
and have PowerPoint do you think it's
digging in a little bit more how useful

1172
00:30:50,379 --> 00:30:50,389
digging in a little bit more how useful
 

1173
00:30:50,389 --> 00:30:52,899
digging in a little bit more how useful
is it to understand the transistor in

1174
00:30:52,899 --> 00:30:52,909
is it to understand the transistor in
 

1175
00:30:52,909 --> 00:30:56,939
is it to understand the transistor in
order to be able to understand

00:31:01,749 --> 00:31:01,759
good intelligence I see so I think in
 

1181
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:04,479
good intelligence I see so I think in
the case of computers because they were

1182
00:31:04,479 --> 00:31:04,489
the case of computers because they were
 

1183
00:31:04,489 --> 00:31:07,749
the case of computers because they were
made by engineers by us this different

made by engineers by us this different
 

1185
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:09,969

separate on purpose you know you there

1188
00:31:13,479 --> 00:31:13,489
separate on purpose you know you there
 

1189
00:31:13,489 --> 00:31:16,059
separate on purpose you know you there
are separate modules so that the

you can write the software translating

1198
00:31:27,399 --> 00:31:27,409
you can write the software translating
 

1199
00:31:27,409 --> 00:31:31,499
you can write the software translating
from one to the end to the other and so

1200
00:31:31,499 --> 00:31:31,509
from one to the end to the other and so
 

1201
00:31:31,509 --> 00:31:35,949
from one to the end to the other and so
in that case I don't think understanding

1202
00:31:35,949 --> 00:31:35,959
in that case I don't think understanding
 

1203
00:31:35,959 --> 00:31:37,959
in that case I don't think understanding
the transistor help you understand

1204
00:31:37,959 --> 00:31:37,969
the transistor help you understand
 

1205
00:31:37,969 --> 00:31:41,529
the transistor help you understand
PowerPoint or very little if you want to

1206
00:31:41,529 --> 00:31:41,539
PowerPoint or very little if you want to
 

1207
00:31:41,539 --> 00:31:43,329
PowerPoint or very little if you want to
understand the computer this question

1208
00:31:43,329 --> 00:31:43,339
understand the computer this question
 

1209
00:31:43,339 --> 00:31:45,339
understand the computer this question
you know I would say you have to

1210
00:31:45,339 --> 00:31:45,349
you know I would say you have to
 

1211
00:31:45,349 --> 00:31:46,899
you know I would say you have to
understanding a different levels if you

1212
00:31:46,899 --> 00:31:46,909
understanding a different levels if you
 

1213
00:31:46,909 --> 00:31:53,529
understanding a different levels if you
really want to build one right but but

1214
00:31:53,529 --> 00:31:53,539
really want to build one right but but
 

1215
00:31:53,539 --> 00:31:56,379
really want to build one right but but
for the brain I think these levels of

1216
00:31:56,379 --> 00:31:56,389
for the brain I think these levels of
 

1217
00:31:56,389 --> 00:31:58,749
for the brain I think these levels of
understanding so the algorithms which

1218
00:31:58,749 --> 00:31:58,759
understanding so the algorithms which
 

1219
00:31:58,759 --> 00:32:00,939
understanding so the algorithms which
kind of computation you know the

1220
00:32:00,939 --> 00:32:00,949
kind of computation you know the
 

1221
00:32:00,949 --> 00:32:03,339
kind of computation you know the
equivalent of PowerPoint and the

1222
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:03,349
equivalent of PowerPoint and the
 

1223
00:32:03,349 --> 00:32:05,619
equivalent of PowerPoint and the
circuits you know the transistors I

1224
00:32:05,619 --> 00:32:05,629
circuits you know the transistors I
 

1225
00:32:05,629 --> 00:32:07,559
circuits you know the transistors I
think they are more much more

1226
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:07,569
think they are more much more
 

1227
00:32:07,569 --> 00:32:10,119
think they are more much more
intertwined with each other there is not

1228
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:10,129
intertwined with each other there is not
 

1229
00:32:10,129 --> 00:32:13,899
intertwined with each other there is not
you know in Italy level of the software

1230
00:32:13,899 --> 00:32:13,909
you know in Italy level of the software
 

1231
00:32:13,909 --> 00:32:16,649
you know in Italy level of the software
separate from the hardware and so that's

1232
00:32:16,649 --> 00:32:16,659
separate from the hardware and so that's
 

1233
00:32:16,659 --> 00:32:19,899
separate from the hardware and so that's
why I think in the case of the brain a

1234
00:32:19,899 --> 00:32:19,909
why I think in the case of the brain a
 

1235
00:32:19,909 --> 00:32:22,269
why I think in the case of the brain a
problem is more difficult or more than

1236
00:32:22,269 --> 00:32:22,279
problem is more difficult or more than

00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:25,569
problem is more difficult or more than
four computers requires the interaction

1238
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:25,579
four computers requires the interaction
 

1239

brain is a big mess

1244
00:32:31,989 --> 00:32:31,999
brain is a big mess
 

1245
00:32:31,999 --> 00:32:35,349
brain is a big mess
you can't just on disentangle a level I

1246
00:32:35,349 --> 00:32:35,359
you can't just on disentangle a level I
 

1247
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:37,059
you can't just on disentangle a level I
think you can but is is much more

1248
00:32:37,059 --> 00:32:37,069
think you can but is is much more
 

1249
00:32:37,069 --> 00:32:39,579
think you can but is is much more
difficult and it's not you know it's not

1250
00:32:39,579 --> 00:32:39,589
difficult and it's not you know it's not
 

1251
00:32:39,589 --> 00:32:41,450
difficult and it's not you know it's not
completely obvious and

1252
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:41,460
completely obvious and
 

1253
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,660
completely obvious and
and I said I think he's one of the

1254
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:43,670
and I said I think he's one of the
 

1255
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,680
and I said I think he's one of the
person everything is the greatest

think he's it's fair that it's difficult

1260
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:51,710
think he's it's fair that it's difficult
 

1261

think he's it's fair that it's difficult
one that said you do talk about

1262
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:54,740
one that said you do talk about
 

1263
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:57,680
one that said you do talk about
compositionality and why I might be

1264
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:57,690
compositionality and why I might be
 

1265
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:00,050
compositionality and why I might be
useful and when you discuss what why

1266
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:00,060
useful and when you discuss what why
 

1267
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,540
useful and when you discuss what why

00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:05,520
biological sense learn anything you talk
 

1271
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,780
biological sense learn anything you talk
about compositionality see there's a

about compositionality see there's a
 

1273
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:12,560
about compositionality see there's a

so why do you think what first of all

1282
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:25,470
so why do you think what first of all
 

1283
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,950
so why do you think what first of all
how do you see compositionality and why

1284
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:27,960
how do you see compositionality and why
 

1285
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,670
how do you see compositionality and why
do you think it exists at all in nature

1286
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:30,680
do you think it exists at all in nature
 

1287
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:36,220
do you think it exists at all in nature
it spoke about I use the the term

it spoke about I use the the term
 

1289
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:39,210
it spoke about I use the the term
compositionality

image you don't need to look at all
 

1331
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,520
image you don't need to look at all
pixels at once but you can compute

1332
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:52,530
pixels at once but you can compute
 

1333
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:56,370
pixels at once but you can compute
something from small groups of pixels

1334
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:56,380
something from small groups of pixels
 

1335
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:59,970
something from small groups of pixels
and then you can compute something on

1336
00:34:59,970 --> 00:34:59,980
and then you can compute something on
 

1337
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:02,760
and then you can compute something on
the output of this local computation and

1338
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:02,770
the output of this local computation and
 

1339
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:05,940
the output of this local computation and
so on that is similar to what you do

1340
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:05,950
so on that is similar to what you do
 

1341
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:07,590
so on that is similar to what you do
when you read the sentence you don't

when you read the sentence you don't
 

1343
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,900
when you read the sentence you don't
need to read the first and the last

1344
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:09,910
need to read the first and the last
 

1345
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:13,160
need to read the first and the last
letter but you can read syllables

1346
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:13,170

00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:20,020
in sentences so this is this kind of
 

1351
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,960
in sentences so this is this kind of

1352
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:21,970
structure so that's as part of the
 

1353
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:25,470

may be more effective than the shallow
 

1357
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:30,930
may be more effective than the shallow
methods and is your sense for most

1358
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:30,940
methods and is your sense for most
 

1359
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:35,570
methods and is your sense for most
things we can use neural networks for

things we can use neural networks for
 

1361
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,890
things we can use neural networks for
those problems are going to be

1362
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:37,900
those problems are going to be
 

1363
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:41,640
those problems are going to be
compositional in nature like like

1364
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:41,650
compositional in nature like like
 

1365
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:45,240
compositional in nature like like
language like vision how far can we get

1366
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:45,250
language like vision how far can we get
 

1367
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,530
language like vision how far can we get
in this kind of right

1368
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:47,540
in this kind of right
 

1369
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:52,120
in this kind of right
so here is almost philosophy well you

1370
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:52,130
so here is almost philosophy well you
 

1371
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:54,880
so here is almost philosophy well you
know there yeah let's go there so a

1372
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:54,890
know there yeah let's go there so a
 

1373
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:57,700
know there yeah let's go there so a
friend of mine max tegmark who is a

1374
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:57,710
friend of mine max tegmark who is a
 

1375
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:00,970
friend of mine max tegmark who is a
physicist at MIT I've talked to him on

1376
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:00,980
physicist at MIT I've talked to him on
 

1377
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,620
physicist at MIT I've talked to him on
this thing yeah and he disagrees with

1378
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:02,630
this thing yeah and he disagrees with
 

1379
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:06,220
this thing yeah and he disagrees with
you right yeah but we you know we agree

1380
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:06,230
you right yeah but we you know we agree
 

1381
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,380
you right yeah but we you know we agree
most but the conclusion is a bit

1382
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:08,390
most but the conclusion is a bit
 

1383
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:09,040
most but the conclusion is a bit
differently

1384
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:09,050
differently
 

1385
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:13,420
differently
he is conclusion is that for images for

to solve these problems comes from
 

1393
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:28,690
to solve these problems comes from
physics comes from the fact that you

1394
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:28,700
physics comes from the fact that you
 

1395
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:31,780
physics comes from the fact that you
have local interactions in physics

1396
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:31,790
have local interactions in physics
 

1397
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:36,390

1405
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:52,480
between stars that it's all local and
that's true but you could push this

1406
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:52,490
that's true but you could push this
 

1407
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:57,130
that's true but you could push this
argument a bit further not this argument

1408
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:57,140
argument a bit further not this argument
 

1409
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:01,300
argument a bit further not this argument
actually you could argue that you know

actually you could argue that you know
 

1411
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:04,180
actually you could argue that you know
maybe that's part of the true but maybe

maybe that's part of the true but maybe

maybe that's part of the true but maybe
what happens is kind of the opposite is

00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:06,920
what happens is kind of the opposite is
 

1415
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,060
what happens is kind of the opposite is
that our brain is wired up as a deep

1416
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:10,070
that our brain is wired up as a deep
 

1417
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:17,760
that our brain is wired up as a deep
network so it can learn understand solve

00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,190
solve problems that don't have this
compositional stretch so the problem is

00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:30,200
compositional stretch so the problem is
 

1427
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:35,110

brain is made up in that's in a sense an
 

1435
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:46,750
brain is made up in that's in a sense an
evolutionary perspective as we've so the

1436
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:46,760
evolutionary perspective as we've so the
 

1437
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,140
evolutionary perspective as we've so the
ones that didn't have the they weren't

1438
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:50,150
ones that didn't have the they weren't
 

1439
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,700
ones that didn't have the they weren't
dealing with a compositional nature of

1440
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:51,710
dealing with a compositional nature of
 

1441
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:56,730
dealing with a compositional nature of
reality died off yes it also could be

1442
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:56,740
reality died off yes it also could be
 

1443
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:59,680
reality died off yes it also could be
may be the reason

1444
00:37:59,680 --> 00:37:59,690
may be the reason
 

1445
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:04,810
may be the reason
why we have this local connectivity in

1446
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:04,820
why we have this local connectivity in
 

1447
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:08,290
why we have this local connectivity in
the brain like simple cells in cortex

1448
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:08,300
the brain like simple cells in cortex
 

1449
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,240
the brain like simple cells in cortex
looking only the small part of the B

1450
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:10,250
looking only the small part of the B
 

1451
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:12,760
looking only the small part of the B
image each one of them and another says

1452
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:12,770
image each one of them and another says
 

1453
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:14,950
image each one of them and another says
looking at it small number of these

1454
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:14,960
looking at it small number of these
 

1455
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,050
looking at it small number of these
simple cells and so on the reason for

1456
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:17,060
simple cells and so on the reason for
 

1457
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:21,180
simple cells and so on the reason for
this may be purely that was difficult to

1458
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:21,190
this may be purely that was difficult to
 

1459
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:25,240
this may be purely that was difficult to
grow longer range connectivity so

1460
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:25,250
grow longer range connectivity so
 

1461
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:29,190
grow longer range connectivity so
suppose it's you know for biology it's

1462
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:29,200
suppose it's you know for biology it's
 

1463
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,580
suppose it's you know for biology it's
possible to grow short range

1464
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:32,590
possible to grow short range
 

1465
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:35,110
possible to grow short range
connectivity but not longer and also

1466
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:35,120
connectivity but not longer and also
 

1467
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,480
connectivity but not longer and also
because there is a limited number of

1468
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:37,490
because there is a limited number of
 

1469
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:40,840
because there is a limited number of
long range the Duke and so you have at

1470
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:40,850
long range the Duke and so you have at
 

1471
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:41,380
long range the Duke and so you have at
this

1472
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:41,390
this
 

1473
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:44,520
this
this limitation from the biology and

1474
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:44,530
this limitation from the biology and
 

1475
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:48,720
this limitation from the biology and
this means you build a deep

1476
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:48,730
this means you build a deep
 

1477
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:50,590
this means you build a deep
convolutional neck this would be

1478
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:50,600
convolutional neck this would be
 

1479
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,420
convolutional neck this would be
something like deep convolutional

1480
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:52,430
something like deep convolutional
 

1481
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:56,320
something like deep convolutional
network and this is great for solving

1482
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:56,330
network and this is great for solving
 

1483
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:58,240
network and this is great for solving
certain class of problem these are the

1484
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:58,250
certain class of problem these are the
 

1485
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:01,930
certain class of problem these are the
ones we are we find easy and important

1486
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:01,940
ones we are we find easy and important
 

1487
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,510
ones we are we find easy and important
for our life and yes they were enough

1488
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:04,520
for our life and yes they were enough
 

1489
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:09,730
for our life and yes they were enough
for us to survive and and you can start

1490
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:09,740
for us to survive and and you can start
 

1491
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,440
for us to survive and and you can start
a successful business on solving those

1492
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:11,450
a successful business on solving those
 

1493
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:15,880

1495
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:18,540
problems right mobile a driving is a

1496
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:18,550
compositional problem right so on the
 

1497
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:21,310
compositional problem right so on the
unlearning task i mean we don't know

1498
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:21,320
unlearning task i mean we don't know
 

1499
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,280
unlearning task i mean we don't know
much about how the brain learns in terms

1500
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:24,290
much about how the brain learns in terms
 

1501
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:27,180
much about how the brain learns in terms
of optimization but so the thing that's

1502
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:27,190
of optimization but so the thing that's
 

1503
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:29,410

problem yeah so what's your intuition
 

1515
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:50,890
problem yeah so what's your intuition

behind this very simplistic algorithm
 

1527
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:05,890

00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:05,900
that seems to do pretty good surprising
 

1529
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:10,930
that seems to do pretty good surprising
yes yes so I find near of science the

1530
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:10,940
yes yes so I find near of science the
 

1531

1533
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:15,040
the architecture of cortex
it's a really similar to the

00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,050
it's a really similar to the
 

1535
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:17,980
it's a really similar to the

there is a nice correspondence there

1538
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:20,240
there is a nice correspondence there
 

1539
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,230
there is a nice correspondence there
between the biology and this kind of

it seems pretty unlikely that biology

1550
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:40,340
it seems pretty unlikely that biology
 

1551
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,350
it seems pretty unlikely that biology
could do that

1552
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:41,360
could do that
 

1553
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,760
could do that
from from what we know right now about

1554
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:44,770
from from what we know right now about
 

1555
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:49,560
from from what we know right now about
you know cortex and neurons and synapses

00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:49,570
you know cortex and neurons and synapses
 

1557
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:52,780
you know cortex and neurons and synapses
so it's a big question open whether

1558
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:52,790
so it's a big question open whether
 

1559
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:57,310
so it's a big question open whether
there are other optimization learning

00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:57,320
there are other optimization learning
 

1561

there are other optimization learning

algorithms that can replace stochastic
 

1563
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:06,110

gradient descent and my my guess is yes

1564
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:06,120

1565
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:11,840

but nobody has found yet a real answer I

there are some interesting ideas the

00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:18,510
there are some interesting ideas the
 

1571
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:22,070
there are some interesting ideas the

so successful this has become clear is
 

1575
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,980
so successful this has become clear is
not so mysterious and the reason is that

00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:29,990
not so mysterious and the reason is that
 

1577
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:34,100
not so mysterious and the reason is that
it's an interesting fact you know it's a

about statistics and and this is the
 

1583
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:45,530

00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:21,329
some old basic theorem of algebra called
bazoo theorem and that gives you an

00:43:21,329 --> 00:43:21,339
bazoo theorem and that gives you an
 

1643
00:43:21,339 --> 00:43:24,069
bazoo theorem and that gives you an

a more global minimum zero meaning good

1658
00:43:47,829 --> 00:43:47,839
a more global minimum zero meaning good
 

1659
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:51,460
a more global minimum zero meaning good
meaning so it's not just local minima

1660
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:51,470
meaning so it's not just local minima
 

1661
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:53,859
meaning so it's not just local minima
yeah a lot of them so you have a lot of

1662
00:43:53,859 --> 00:43:53,869
yeah a lot of them so you have a lot of
 

1663
00:43:53,869 --> 00:43:56,680
yeah a lot of them so you have a lot of
solutions so it's not so surprising that

1664
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:56,690
solutions so it's not so surprising that
 

1665
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:59,819
solutions so it's not so surprising that
you can find them relatively easily and

1666
00:43:59,819 --> 00:43:59,829
you can find them relatively easily and
 

1667
00:43:59,829 --> 00:44:02,349
you can find them relatively easily and
this is why this is because of the

1668
00:44:02,349 --> 00:44:02,359
this is why this is because of the
 

1669
00:44:02,359 --> 00:44:04,620
this is why this is because of the
overall parameterization the

1670
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:04,630
overall parameterization the
 

1671

00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:10,430

1675
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:12,790
for solutions pretty good and so not so
surprising right is like you know if you

1676
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:12,800
surprising right is like you know if you
 

1677
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,589
surprising right is like you know if you
have a system of linear equation and you

1678
00:44:14,589 --> 00:44:14,599
have a system of linear equation and you
 

1679
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:18,039
have a system of linear equation and you
have more unknowns than equations then

1680
00:44:18,039 --> 00:44:18,049
have more unknowns than equations then
 

1681
00:44:18,049 --> 00:44:19,630
have more unknowns than equations then
you have we know you have an infinite

1682
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:19,640
you have we know you have an infinite
 

1683
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:23,650
you have we know you have an infinite
number of solutions and the question is

1684
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:23,660
number of solutions and the question is
 

1685
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:25,990
number of solutions and the question is
to pick one that's another story but you

1686
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:26,000
to pick one that's another story but you
 

1687
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,609
to pick one that's another story but you
have an infinite number of solutions so

1688
00:44:27,609 --> 00:44:27,619
have an infinite number of solutions so
 

1689
00:44:27,619 --> 00:44:30,280
have an infinite number of solutions so
there are a lot of value of your

1690
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:30,290
there are a lot of value of your
 

1691
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:33,250
there are a lot of value of your
unknowns that satisfy the equations but

1692
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:33,260
unknowns that satisfy the equations but
 

1693
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:35,319
unknowns that satisfy the equations but
it's possible that there's a lot of

1694
00:44:35,319 --> 00:44:35,329
it's possible that there's a lot of
 

1695
00:44:35,329 --> 00:44:36,940
it's possible that there's a lot of
those solutions that aren't very good

1696
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:36,950
those solutions that aren't very good
 

1697
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:39,010
those solutions that aren't very good
what's surprising so that's a good

00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:39,020
what's surprising so that's a good
 

1699

1750
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:50,840
the question the interesting question is
 

1751
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:56,260
the question the interesting question is
that if this theorem

1752
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:56,270
that if this theorem
 

1753
00:45:56,270 --> 00:45:58,690
that if this theorem
it says you can approximate fine but

1754
00:45:58,690 --> 00:45:58,700
it says you can approximate fine but
 

1755
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:02,260
it says you can approximate fine but
when you ask how many neurons for

1756
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:02,270
when you ask how many neurons for
 

1757
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:04,450
when you ask how many neurons for
instance or in the case of polynomial

1758
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:04,460
instance or in the case of polynomial
 

1759
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:08,170
instance or in the case of polynomial
how many monomials I need to get a good

1760
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:08,180
how many monomials I need to get a good
 

1761
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:14,069
how many monomials I need to get a good
approximation then it turns out that

1762
00:46:14,069 --> 00:46:14,079
approximation then it turns out that
 

1763
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:17,440
approximation then it turns out that
that depends on the dimensionality of

1764
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:17,450
that depends on the dimensionality of
 

1765
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:19,299
that depends on the dimensionality of
your function how many variables you

1766
00:46:19,299 --> 00:46:19,309
your function how many variables you
 

1767
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:21,400
your function how many variables you
have but it depends on the

1768
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:21,410
have but it depends on the
 

1769
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:24,160
have but it depends on the
dimensionality of your function in a bad

1770
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:24,170
dimensionality of your function in a bad
 

1771
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:27,059
dimensionality of your function in a bad
way it's for instance suppose you want

1772
00:46:27,059 --> 00:46:27,069
way it's for instance suppose you want
 

1773
00:46:27,069 --> 00:46:32,319
way it's for instance suppose you want
an error which is no worse than 10% in

1774
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:32,329
an error which is no worse than 10% in
 

1775
00:46:32,329 --> 00:46:35,680
an error which is no worse than 10% in
your approximation you come up with a

1776
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:35,690
your approximation you come up with a
 

1777
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:37,660
your approximation you come up with a
net of the approximate your function

1778
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:37,670
net of the approximate your function
 

1779
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:42,970
net of the approximate your function
within 10% then turns out that the

1780
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:42,980
within 10% then turns out that the
 

1781
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:44,980
within 10% then turns out that the
number of units you need are in the

1782
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:44,990
number of units you need are in the
 

1783
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:48,430
number of units you need are in the
order of 10 to the dimensionality D how

1784
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:48,440
order of 10 to the dimensionality D how
 

1785
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,980
order of 10 to the dimensionality D how
many variables so if you have you know

1786
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:50,990
many variables so if you have you know
 

1787
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:55,089
many variables so if you have you know
two variables is these 2 would you have

1788
00:46:55,089 --> 00:46:55,099
two variables is these 2 would you have
 

1789
00:46:55,099 --> 00:46:57,849
two variables is these 2 would you have
hundred units and okay but if you have

1790
00:46:57,849 --> 00:46:57,859
hundred units and okay but if you have
 

1791
00:46:57,859 --> 00:47:03,549
hundred units and okay but if you have
say 200 by 200 pixel images now this is

1792
00:47:03,549 --> 00:47:03,559
say 200 by 200 pixel images now this is
 

1793
00:47:03,559 --> 00:47:07,299
say 200 by 200 pixel images now this is
you know 240 thousand whatever and we

1794
00:47:07,299 --> 00:47:07,309
you know 240 thousand whatever and we
 

1795
00:47:07,309 --> 00:47:08,950
you know 240 thousand whatever and we
can go to the sizing universe pretty

1796
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:08,960
can go to the sizing universe pretty
 

1797
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,049
can go to the sizing universe pretty
quickly there are exactly 10 to the

1798
00:47:11,049 --> 00:47:11,059
quickly there are exactly 10 to the
 

1799
00:47:11,059 --> 00:47:16,359
quickly there are exactly 10 to the
40,000 and so this is called the curse

1800
00:47:16,359 --> 00:47:16,369
40,000 and so this is called the curse
 

1801
00:47:16,369 --> 00:47:19,750
40,000 and so this is called the curse
of dimensionality not you know quite

1802
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:19,760
of dimensionality not you know quite
 

1803
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:23,260
of dimensionality not you know quite
appropriate and the hope is with the

1804
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:23,270
appropriate and the hope is with the
 

1805
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:27,280
appropriate and the hope is with the
extra layers you can remove the curse

1806
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:27,290
extra layers you can remove the curse
 

1807
00:47:27,290 --> 00:47:31,299
extra layers you can remove the curse
what we proved is that if you have deep

1808
00:47:31,299 --> 00:47:31,309
what we proved is that if you have deep
 

1809
00:47:31,309 --> 00:47:33,930
what we proved is that if you have deep
layers or a rocky core architecture that

1810
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:33,940
layers or a rocky core architecture that
 

1811
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:36,609
layers or a rocky core architecture that
with the local connectivity of the type

1812
00:47:36,609 --> 00:47:36,619
with the local connectivity of the type
 

1813
00:47:36,619 --> 00:47:40,480
with the local connectivity of the type
of convolutional deep learning and if

1814
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:40,490
of convolutional deep learning and if
 

1815
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:42,599
of convolutional deep learning and if
you are dealing with a function that has

1816
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:42,609
you are dealing with a function that has
 

1817
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:46,000
you are dealing with a function that has
this kind of hierarchical architecture

1818
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:46,010
this kind of hierarchical architecture
 

1819
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:49,920
this kind of hierarchical architecture
then you avoid completely the curves

1820
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:49,930
then you avoid completely the curves
 

1821
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:52,569
then you avoid completely the curves
you've spoken a lot about supervised

1822
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:52,579
you've spoken a lot about supervised
 

1823
00:47:52,579 --> 00:47:54,940
you've spoken a lot about supervised

1835
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,590

image you know a face how much is miling

1906
00:49:59,030 --> 00:49:59,040
image you know a face how much is miling
 

1907
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:03,520
image you know a face how much is miling
is rotated 45 degrees or not what about

1908
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:03,530
is rotated 45 degrees or not what about
 

1909
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:06,590
is rotated 45 degrees or not what about
having a network that I trained with the

1910
00:50:06,590 --> 00:50:06,600
having a network that I trained with the
 

1911
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:10,010
having a network that I trained with the
same dataset but now I invert input and

1912
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:10,020
same dataset but now I invert input and
 

1913
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:13,640
same dataset but now I invert input and
output now the input is the pose or the

1914
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:13,650
output now the input is the pose or the
 

1915
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:16,970
output now the input is the pose or the
expression number certain numbers and

1916
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:16,980
expression number certain numbers and
 

1917
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:19,010
expression number certain numbers and
the output is the image and I train it

1918
00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:19,020
the output is the image and I train it
 

1919
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:21,650
the output is the image and I train it
and we did pretty good interesting

1920
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:21,660
and we did pretty good interesting
 

1921
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:25,460
and we did pretty good interesting
results in terms of producing very

1922
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:25,470
results in terms of producing very
 

1923
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:29,120
results in terms of producing very
realistic looking images was you know

1924
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:29,130
realistic looking images was you know
 

1925
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:32,300
realistic looking images was you know
less sophisticated mechanism but the

1926
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:32,310
less sophisticated mechanism but the
 

1927
00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:35,450
less sophisticated mechanism but the
output was pretty less than gains but

1928
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:35,460
output was pretty less than gains but
 

1929
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:37,690
output was pretty less than gains but
the output was pretty much of the same

1930
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:37,700
the output was pretty much of the same
 

1931
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:42,260
the output was pretty much of the same
quality so I think for computer graphics

1932
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:42,270
quality so I think for computer graphics
 

1933
00:50:42,270 --> 00:50:44,930
quality so I think for computer graphics
type application yeah definitely gains

1934
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:44,940
type application yeah definitely gains
 

1935
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:46,880
type application yeah definitely gains

1945
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:08,090

like they think they can get out more

1946
00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:08,100
like they think they can get out more
 

1947
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:11,360
like they think they can get out more
than they put in you know it there's no

00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:11,370
than they put in you know it there's no
 

1949
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:13,370
than they put in you know it there's no
free lunches Yeah right

1950
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:13,380
free lunches Yeah right
 

1951
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:15,260
free lunches Yeah right
that's what do you think what's your

00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:45,750
how can we become better teachers maybe
 

1971
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:48,980
how can we become better teachers maybe
that's one one way now I got your you

1972
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:48,990
that's one one way now I got your you
 

1973
00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:53,749
that's one one way now I got your you
know what I like that because one

00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:57,150
again one caricature of the history of

00:51:57,150 --> 00:52:00,529
again one caricature of the history of
computer sites you could say is with the

1980
00:52:04,989 --> 00:52:04,999

1981
00:52:04,999 --> 00:52:10,370

continuously labelers cheap yeah and the

1982
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:10,380
continuously labelers cheap yeah and the
 

1983
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:13,880
continuously labelers cheap yeah and the
future would be schools like we have for

1984
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:13,890
future would be schools like we have for
 

1985
00:52:13,890 --> 00:52:14,359
future would be schools like we have for
kids

1986
00:52:14,359 --> 00:52:14,369
kids
 

1987
00:52:14,369 --> 00:52:19,489
kids
yeah currently the labeling methods were

1988
00:52:19,489 --> 00:52:19,499
yeah currently the labeling methods were
 

1989
00:52:19,499 --> 00:52:24,799
yeah currently the labeling methods were
not selective about which examples we we

1990
00:52:24,799 --> 00:52:24,809
not selective about which examples we we
 

1991
00:52:24,809 --> 00:52:27,620
not selective about which examples we we
teach networks with so I think the focus

1992
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:27,630
teach networks with so I think the focus
 

1993
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:30,650
teach networks with so I think the focus
of making one-shot networks that learn

1994
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:30,660
of making one-shot networks that learn
 

1995
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:32,509
of making one-shot networks that learn
much faster is often on the architecture

1996
00:52:32,509 --> 00:52:32,519
much faster is often on the architecture
 

1997
00:52:32,519 --> 00:52:36,049
much faster is often on the architecture
side but how can we pick better examples

1998
00:52:36,049 --> 00:52:36,059
side but how can we pick better examples
 

1999
00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:38,239
side but how can we pick better examples
with wish to learn do you have

2000
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:38,249
with wish to learn do you have
 

2001
00:52:38,249 --> 00:52:40,190
with wish to learn do you have
intuitions about that well that's part

2002
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:40,200
intuitions about that well that's part
 

2003
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:43,160
intuitions about that well that's part
of the quarter program but the other one

2004
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:43,170
of the quarter program but the other one
 

2005
00:52:43,170 --> 00:52:50,079
of the quarter program but the other one
is you know if we look at biology

2006
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:50,089
is you know if we look at biology
 

2007
00:52:50,089 --> 00:52:56,390
is you know if we look at biology
reasonable assumption I think is in the

2008
00:52:56,390 --> 00:52:56,400
reasonable assumption I think is in the
 

2009
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,049
reasonable assumption I think is in the
same spirit II that I said evolution is

2010
00:52:59,049 --> 00:52:59,059
same spirit II that I said evolution is
 

2011
00:52:59,059 --> 00:53:02,870
same spirit II that I said evolution is
opportunistic and has weak priors you

2012
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:02,880
opportunistic and has weak priors you
 

2013
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:07,120
opportunistic and has weak priors you
know the way I think the intelligence of

2014
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:07,130
know the way I think the intelligence of
 

2015
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:12,349
know the way I think the intelligence of
child the baby may develop is by

00:53:12,349 --> 00:53:12,359
child the baby may develop is by
 

2017
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:17,150
child the baby may develop is by
bootstrapping weak priors from evolution

2018
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:17,160
bootstrapping weak priors from evolution
 

2019
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:24,620
bootstrapping weak priors from evolution
for instance in you can assume that you

2020
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:24,630
for instance in you can assume that you
 

2021
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:27,069
for instance in you can assume that you
are having most organisms including

2022
00:53:27,069 --> 00:53:27,079
are having most organisms including
 

2023
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:31,390
are having most organisms including
human babies built in some basic

2026
00:53:36,170 --> 00:53:36,180
machinery to detect motion and relative
 

2027
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:39,979
machinery to detect motion and relative
motion and in fact there is you know we

2028
00:53:39,979 --> 00:53:39,989
motion and in fact there is you know we
 

2029
00:53:39,989 --> 00:53:44,180
motion and in fact there is you know we
know all insects from fruit flies other

2030
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:44,190
know all insects from fruit flies other
 

2031
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:49,520
know all insects from fruit flies other
animals they have this

2032
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:49,530

 

2033
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:51,860

even in the readiness of in the very

2034
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:51,870
even in the readiness of in the very
 

2035
00:53:51,870 --> 00:53:53,960
even in the readiness of in the very
peripheral part it's very conserved

2036
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:53,970
peripheral part it's very conserved
 

2037
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:56,840
peripheral part it's very conserved
across species something that evolution

2038
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:56,850
across species something that evolution
 

2039
00:53:56,850 --> 00:53:59,840
across species something that evolution
discovered early it may be the reason

2040
00:53:59,840 --> 00:53:59,850
discovered early it may be the reason
 

2041
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:03,470
discovered early it may be the reason
why babies tend to look in the first few

2042
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:03,480
why babies tend to look in the first few
 

2043
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:07,100
why babies tend to look in the first few
days to moving objects and not to not

2044
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:07,110
days to moving objects and not to not
 

2045
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:10,040
days to moving objects and not to not
moving out now moving objects means okay

2046
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:10,050
moving out now moving objects means okay
 

2047
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:12,800
moving out now moving objects means okay
they are attracted by motion but motion

2048
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:12,810
they are attracted by motion but motion
 

2049
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:16,550
they are attracted by motion but motion
also means that motion gives automatic

2050
00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:16,560
also means that motion gives automatic
 

2051
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:20,750
also means that motion gives automatic
segmentation from the background so

2052
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:20,760
segmentation from the background so
 

2053
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,720
segmentation from the background so
because of motion boundaries you know

2054
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:23,730
because of motion boundaries you know
 

2055
00:54:23,730 --> 00:54:27,770
because of motion boundaries you know
either the object is moving or the eye

2056
00:54:27,770 --> 00:54:27,780
either the object is moving or the eye
 

2057
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:29,900
either the object is moving or the eye
of the baby is tracking the moving

2058
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:29,910
of the baby is tracking the moving
 

2059
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:32,240
of the baby is tracking the moving
object and the background is moving

2060
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:32,250
object and the background is moving
 

2061
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:34,760
object and the background is moving
right yeah so just purely on the visual

2062
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:34,770
right yeah so just purely on the visual
 

2063
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:36,890
right yeah so just purely on the visual
characteristics of the scene as seems to

2064
00:54:36,890 --> 00:54:36,900
characteristics of the scene as seems to
 

2065
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:38,750
characteristics of the scene as seems to
be the most useful right so it's like

2066
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:38,760
be the most useful right so it's like
 

2067
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:43,030
be the most useful right so it's like
looking at an object without background

2068
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:43,040
looking at an object without background
 

2069
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,710
looking at an object without background
it's ideal for learning the object

2070
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:45,720
it's ideal for learning the object
 

2071
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:48,440
it's ideal for learning the object
otherwise it's really difficult because

2072
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:48,450
otherwise it's really difficult because
 

2073
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:51,290
otherwise it's really difficult because
you have so much stuff so suppose you do

2074
00:54:51,290 --> 00:54:51,300
you have so much stuff so suppose you do
 

2075
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:55,400
you have so much stuff so suppose you do
this at the beginning first weeks then

2076
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:55,410
this at the beginning first weeks then
 

2077
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:57,860
this at the beginning first weeks then
after that you can recognize the object

2078
00:54:57,860 --> 00:54:57,870
after that you can recognize the object
 

2079
00:54:57,870 --> 00:55:02,450
after that you can recognize the object
now they're imprinted a number of even

2080
00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:02,460
now they're imprinted a number of even
 

2081
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:05,930
now they're imprinted a number of even
in the background even without motion so

2082
00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:05,940
in the background even without motion so
 

2083
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:08,240
in the background even without motion so
that's at the by the way I just want to

2084
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:08,250
that's at the by the way I just want to
 

2085
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:11,000
that's at the by the way I just want to
ask an object recognition problem so

2086
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:11,010
ask an object recognition problem so
 

2087
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:13,010
ask an object recognition problem so
there is this being responsive to

2088
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:13,020
there is this being responsive to
 

2089
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:15,970
there is this being responsive to
movement and edge detection essentially

2090
00:55:15,970 --> 00:55:15,980
movement and edge detection essentially
 

2091
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:19,990
movement and edge detection essentially
what's the gap between being effectively

2092
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:20,000
what's the gap between being effectively
 

2093
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,430
what's the gap between being effectively
effective at visually recognizing stuff

2094
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:22,440
effective at visually recognizing stuff
 

2095
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:25,880
effective at visually recognizing stuff
detecting word that is and understanding

2096
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:25,890
detecting word that is and understanding
 

2097
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:29,000
detecting word that is and understanding
the scene there is this a huge gap in

2098
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:29,010
the scene there is this a huge gap in
 

2099
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:33,080
the scene there is this a huge gap in
many layers or is it as a close no I

2100
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:33,090
many layers or is it as a close no I
 

2101
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:34,880
many layers or is it as a close no I
think that's a huge gap

2102
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:34,890
think that's a huge gap
 

2103
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:38,630
think that's a huge gap
I think present algorithm with all the

2104
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:38,640
I think present algorithm with all the
 

2105
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:42,680
I think present algorithm with all the
success that we have and the fact that

2106
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:42,690
success that we have and the fact that
 

2107
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:45,590
success that we have and the fact that
are a lot of very useful it's I think we

2108
00:55:45,590 --> 00:55:45,600
are a lot of very useful it's I think we
 

2109
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:47,140
are a lot of very useful it's I think we
are we are in a golden age for

2110
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:47,150
are we are in a golden age for
 

2111
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:52,040
are we are in a golden age for
applications of low level vision and low

2112
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:52,050
applications of low level vision and low
 

2113
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:54,380
applications of low level vision and low
level speech recognition and so on you

2114
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:54,390
level speech recognition and so on you
 

2115
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:56,650
level speech recognition and so on you
know Alexa and so

2116
00:55:56,650 --> 00:55:56,660
know Alexa and so
 

2117
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:58,480
know Alexa and so
there are many more things of similar

2118
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:58,490
there are many more things of similar
 

2119
00:55:58,490 --> 00:56:00,850
there are many more things of similar
level to be done including medical

2120
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:00,860
level to be done including medical
 

2121
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:03,000
level to be done including medical
diagnosis and so on but we are far from

2122
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:03,010
diagnosis and so on but we are far from
 

2123
00:56:03,010 --> 00:56:06,610
diagnosis and so on but we are far from
what we call understanding of a scene of

2124
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:06,620
what we call understanding of a scene of
 

2125
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:12,600
what we call understanding of a scene of
language of actions of people that is

2126
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:12,610
language of actions of people that is
 

2127
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:16,420
language of actions of people that is
despite the claims that's I think very

2128
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:16,430
despite the claims that's I think very
 

2129
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:20,680
despite the claims that's I think very
far or a little bit off so in popular

2130
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:20,690
far or a little bit off so in popular
 

2131
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:23,350
far or a little bit off so in popular
culture and among many researchers some

2132
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:23,360
culture and among many researchers some
 

2133
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:25,030

of which I've spoken with the sue

2134
00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:25,040
of which I've spoken with the sue
 

2135
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:29,230
of which I've spoken with the sue
Russell and you know a mask in and out

2136
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:29,240
Russell and you know a mask in and out
 

2137
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:31,570
Russell and you know a mask in and out
of the AAI field there's a concern about

2138
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:31,580
of the AAI field there's a concern about
 

2139
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:35,310
of the AAI field there's a concern about
the existential threat of AI yeah and

2140
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:35,320
the existential threat of AI yeah and
 

2141
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:38,820
the existential threat of AI yeah and
how do you think about this concern in

2142
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:38,830
how do you think about this concern in
 

2143
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:42,990
how do you think about this concern in
and is it valuable to think about

2144
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:43,000
and is it valuable to think about
 

2145
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
and is it valuable to think about
large-scale long-term unintended

2146
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:46,010
large-scale long-term unintended
 

2147
00:56:46,010 --> 00:56:50,470
large-scale long-term unintended
consequences of intelligent systems we

2148
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:50,480
consequences of intelligent systems we
 

2149
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,810
consequences of intelligent systems we
try to build I always think is better to

2150
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:52,820
try to build I always think is better to
 

2151
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:56,350
try to build I always think is better to
worry first you know early rather than

2152
00:56:56,350 --> 00:56:56,360
worry first you know early rather than
 

2153
00:56:56,360 --> 00:57:00,670
worry first you know early rather than
late so some worry is good yeah I'm not

2154
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:00,680
late so some worry is good yeah I'm not
 

2155
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,770
late so some worry is good yeah I'm not
against worry at all

2156
00:57:02,770 --> 00:57:02,780
against worry at all
 

2157
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:08,620
against worry at all
personally I think that you know it will

2158
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:08,630
personally I think that you know it will
 

2159
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:12,430
personally I think that you know it will
take a long time before there is real

2160
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:12,440
take a long time before there is real
 

2161
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:16,780
take a long time before there is real
reason to be worried but as I said I

2162
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:16,790
reason to be worried but as I said I
 

2163
00:57:16,790 --> 00:57:19,510
reason to be worried but as I said I
think it is good to put in place and

2164
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:19,520
think it is good to put in place and
 

2165
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:24,550
think it is good to put in place and
think about possible safety against what

2166
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:24,560
think about possible safety against what
 

2167
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:27,600
think about possible safety against what
I find a bit misleading are things like

2168
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:27,610
I find a bit misleading are things like
 

2169
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:30,100
I find a bit misleading are things like
that I've been said by people I know

2170
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:30,110
that I've been said by people I know
 

2171
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:33,940
that I've been said by people I know
like Elon Musk and what is boström

2172
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:33,950
like Elon Musk and what is boström
 

2173
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:37,570
like Elon Musk and what is boström
important notice first name a neck panic

2174
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:37,580
important notice first name a neck panic
 

2175
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:40,720
important notice first name a neck panic
poster right you know and a couple of

2176
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:40,730
poster right you know and a couple of
 

2177
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:44,050
poster right you know and a couple of
other people that for instance a eyes

2178
00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:44,060
other people that for instance a eyes
 

2179
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:46,270
other people that for instance a eyes
more dangerous the nuclear weapons right

2180
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:46,280
more dangerous the nuclear weapons right
 

2181
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:50,590
more dangerous the nuclear weapons right
yeah I think that's really project that

2182
00:57:50,590 --> 00:57:50,600
yeah I think that's really project that
 

2183
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:54,370
yeah I think that's really project that
can be it's misleading because in terms

2184
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:54,380
can be it's misleading because in terms
 

2185
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:56,890
can be it's misleading because in terms
of priority which should still be more

2186
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:56,900
of priority which should still be more
 

2187
00:57:56,900 --> 00:58:00,520
of priority which should still be more
worried about nuclear weapons and you

2188
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:00,530
worried about nuclear weapons and you
 

2189
00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:02,530
worried about nuclear weapons and you
know what people are doing about it and

2190
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:02,540
know what people are doing about it and
 

2191
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:03,970
know what people are doing about it and
some then a

2192
00:58:03,970 --> 00:58:03,980
some then a
 

2193
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:09,849
some then a
and he's spoken about them as obvious

2194
00:58:09,849 --> 00:58:09,859
and he's spoken about them as obvious
 

2195
00:58:09,859 --> 00:58:12,789
and he's spoken about them as obvious
and yourself saying that you think

2196
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:12,799
and yourself saying that you think
 

2197
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:15,089
and yourself saying that you think
you'll be about a hundred years out

2198
00:58:15,089 --> 00:58:15,099
you'll be about a hundred years out
 

2199
00:58:15,099 --> 00:58:18,400
you'll be about a hundred years out
before we have a general intelligence

2200
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:18,410
before we have a general intelligence
 

2201
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:19,839
before we have a general intelligence
system that's on par with the human

2202
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:19,849
system that's on par with the human
 

2203
00:58:19,849 --> 00:58:21,760
system that's on par with the human
being you have any updates for those

2204
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:21,770
being you have any updates for those
 

2205
00:58:21,770 --> 00:58:24,430
being you have any updates for those
predictions what I think he said he's at

2206
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:24,440
predictions what I think he said he's at
 

2207
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:26,680
predictions what I think he said he's at
28 he said it went all right this was a

2208
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:26,690
28 he said it went all right this was a
 

2209
00:58:26,690 --> 00:58:28,809
28 he said it went all right this was a
couple of years ago I have not asked him

2210
00:58:28,809 --> 00:58:28,819
couple of years ago I have not asked him
 

2211
00:58:28,819 --> 00:58:31,750
couple of years ago I have not asked him
again so I should have your own

2212
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:31,760
again so I should have your own
 

2213
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:36,220
again so I should have your own
prediction what's your prediction about

2214
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:36,230
prediction what's your prediction about
 

2215
00:58:36,230 --> 00:58:37,839
prediction what's your prediction about
when you'll be truly surprised

2216
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:37,849
when you'll be truly surprised
 

2217
00:58:37,849 --> 00:58:41,079
when you'll be truly surprised

and what's the confidence interval or
 

2219
00:58:41,089 --> 00:58:43,960
and what's the confidence interval or
not you know it's so difficult to

00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:43,970
not you know it's so difficult to

predict a bit I'll be but as I said this

2226
00:58:51,549 --> 00:58:51,559
predict a bit I'll be but as I said this
 

2227
00:58:51,559 --> 00:58:55,750
predict a bit I'll be but as I said this
is completely it would be more like rod

we'll be able to understand it will be
 

2243
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:22,410
we'll be able to understand it will be
simple do you think you'll be

2244
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:22,420
simple do you think you'll be
 

2245
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:27,910

understanding transistors and so on and
 

2325
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:36,519
understanding transistors and so on and
you know in that kind of framework we

2326
01:01:36,519 --> 01:01:36,529
you know in that kind of framework we
 

2327
01:01:36,529 --> 01:01:39,069
you know in that kind of framework we
had the level of the hardware and the

of how you construct learning machine
 

2341
01:02:01,910 --> 01:02:07,090
of how you construct learning machine
like we do but being unable to describe

still a powerful understanding if I can
 

2349
01:02:17,570 --> 01:02:19,990
still a powerful understanding if I can
build the learning machine even if I

2350
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:20,000
build the learning machine even if I
 

2351
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,590
build the learning machine even if I
don't understand in detail every time

don't understand why they came after
 

2363
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:37,960
don't understand why they came after
that particular preference but you

2364

that particular preference but you
 

2365
01:02:37,970 --> 01:02:39,640
that particular preference but you
understand the learning process that I'm

2366
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:39,650
understand the learning process that I'm
 

2367
01:02:39,650 --> 01:02:45,960
understand the learning process that I'm
very interesting yeah yeah so unlearning

2368

01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:54,540
has a certain one of the challenging
things that you've spoken about is

2374
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:54,550
things that you've spoken about is
 

2375
01:02:54,550 --> 01:02:58,980
things that you've spoken about is
learning ethics learning yeah morals and

2376
01:02:58,980 --> 01:02:58,990
learning ethics learning yeah morals and
 

2377
01:02:58,990 --> 01:03:01,390
learning ethics learning yeah morals and
what how hard do you think is the

2378
01:03:01,390 --> 01:03:01,400
what how hard do you think is the
 

2379
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:04,930
what how hard do you think is the
problem of first of all humans

2380
01:03:04,930 --> 01:03:04,940
problem of first of all humans
 

2381
01:03:04,940 --> 01:03:07,300
problem of first of all humans
understanding our ethics what is the

2382
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:07,310
understanding our ethics what is the
 

2383
01:03:07,310 --> 01:03:09,490
understanding our ethics what is the
origin and the neural a low level of

2384
01:03:09,490 --> 01:03:09,500
origin and the neural a low level of
 

2385
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:12,430
origin and the neural a low level of
ethics what is it at a higher level is

2386
01:03:12,430 --> 01:03:12,440
ethics what is it at a higher level is
 

2387
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:14,620
ethics what is it at a higher level is
it something that's learner before

2388
01:03:14,620 --> 01:03:14,630
it something that's learner before
 

2389
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:19,390
it something that's learner before
machines in your intuition I think yeah

2390
01:03:19,390 --> 01:03:19,400
machines in your intuition I think yeah
 

2391
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:24,310
machines in your intuition I think yeah
ethics is learnable very likely I I

2392
01:03:24,310 --> 01:03:24,320
ethics is learnable very likely I I
 

2393
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:28,950
ethics is learnable very likely I I
think I is one of these problems were

2394
01:03:28,950 --> 01:03:28,960

 

2395
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:34,450

think understanding the neuroscience of

2396
01:03:34,450 --> 01:03:34,460
think understanding the neuroscience of
 

2397
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:37,840
think understanding the neuroscience of
ethics you know people discuss there is

2398
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:37,850
ethics you know people discuss there is
 

2399
01:03:37,850 --> 01:03:42,760
ethics you know people discuss there is
an ethics of neuroscience yes you know

2400
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:42,770
an ethics of neuroscience yes you know
 

2401
01:03:42,770 --> 01:03:44,650
an ethics of neuroscience yes you know
how a neuroscientist should or should

2402
01:03:44,650 --> 01:03:44,660
how a neuroscientist should or should
 

2403
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:47,350
how a neuroscientist should or should
not behave can you think of a

2404
01:03:47,350 --> 01:03:47,360
not behave can you think of a
 

2405
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:50,740
not behave can you think of a
neurosurgeon and the ethics are you Rory

2406
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:50,750
neurosurgeon and the ethics are you Rory
 

2407
01:03:50,750 --> 01:03:54,370
neurosurgeon and the ethics are you Rory
has to behavior he she has to be but I'm

2408
01:03:54,370 --> 01:03:54,380
has to behavior he she has to be but I'm
 

2409
01:03:54,380 --> 01:03:57,610
has to behavior he she has to be but I'm
more interested on the neuroscience of

2410
01:03:57,610 --> 01:03:57,620
more interested on the neuroscience of
 

2411
01:03:57,620 --> 01:03:58,810
more interested on the neuroscience of
you blow my mind right now the

2412
01:03:58,810 --> 01:03:58,820
you blow my mind right now the
 

2413
01:03:58,820 --> 01:04:00,520
you blow my mind right now the
neuroscience of ethics is very matter

2414
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:00,530
neuroscience of ethics is very matter
 

2415
01:04:00,530 --> 01:04:03,160
neuroscience of ethics is very matter
yeah and you know I think that would be

2416
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:03,170
yeah and you know I think that would be
 

2417
01:04:03,170 --> 01:04:05,560
yeah and you know I think that would be
important to understand also for being

2418
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:05,570
important to understand also for being
 

2419
01:04:05,570 --> 01:04:10,030
important to understand also for being
able to to design machines that have

2420
01:04:10,030 --> 01:04:10,040
able to to design machines that have
 

2421
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:12,970
able to to design machines that have
that are ethical machines in

2422
01:04:12,970 --> 01:04:12,980
that are ethical machines in
 

2423
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:16,420
that are ethical machines in
our sense of ethics and you think there

2424
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:16,430
our sense of ethics and you think there
 

2425
01:04:16,430 --> 01:04:18,700
our sense of ethics and you think there
is something in your science there's

2426
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:18,710
is something in your science there's
 

2427
01:04:18,710 --> 01:04:21,760
is something in your science there's
patterns tools in your science that can

2428
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:21,770
patterns tools in your science that can
 

2429
01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:25,210
patterns tools in your science that can
help us shed some light on ethics or

2430
01:04:25,210 --> 01:04:25,220
help us shed some light on ethics or
 

2431
01:04:25,220 --> 01:04:28,540
help us shed some light on ethics or
yeah mostly on the psychology sociology

2432
01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:28,550
yeah mostly on the psychology sociology
 

2433
01:04:28,550 --> 01:04:30,970
yeah mostly on the psychology sociology
much higher level no there is a culture

2434
01:04:30,970 --> 01:04:30,980
much higher level no there is a culture
 

2435
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:33,430
much higher level no there is a culture
but there is also in the meantime there

2436
01:04:33,430 --> 01:04:33,440
but there is also in the meantime there
 

2437
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:39,880
but there is also in the meantime there
are there is evidence fMRI of specific

2438
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:39,890
are there is evidence fMRI of specific
 

2439
01:04:39,890 --> 01:04:42,190
are there is evidence fMRI of specific
areas of the brain that are involved in

2440
01:04:42,190 --> 01:04:42,200
areas of the brain that are involved in
 

2441
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:44,950
areas of the brain that are involved in
certain ethical judgment and not only

2442
01:04:44,950 --> 01:04:44,960
certain ethical judgment and not only
 

2443
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:47,770
certain ethical judgment and not only
this you can stimulate those area with

2444
01:04:47,770 --> 01:04:47,780
this you can stimulate those area with
 

2445
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:51,580
this you can stimulate those area with
magnetic fields and change the ethical

2446
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:51,590
magnetic fields and change the ethical
 

2447
01:04:51,590 --> 01:04:58,150
magnetic fields and change the ethical
decisions yeah Wow so that's work by a

2448
01:04:58,150 --> 01:04:58,160
decisions yeah Wow so that's work by a
 

2449
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:01,060
decisions yeah Wow so that's work by a
colleague of mine Rebecca Saxe and there

2450
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:01,070
colleague of mine Rebecca Saxe and there
 

2451
01:05:01,070 --> 01:05:04,150
colleague of mine Rebecca Saxe and there
is a other researchers doing similar

2452
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:04,160
is a other researchers doing similar
 

2453
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:06,970
is a other researchers doing similar
work and I think you know this is the

2454
01:05:06,970 --> 01:05:06,980
work and I think you know this is the
 

2455
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:11,410
work and I think you know this is the
beginning but ideally at some point

2456
01:05:11,410 --> 01:05:11,420
beginning but ideally at some point
 

2457
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:14,170
beginning but ideally at some point
we'll have an understanding of how this

2458
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:14,180
we'll have an understanding of how this
 

2459
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:15,070
we'll have an understanding of how this
works

2460
01:05:15,070 --> 01:05:15,080
works
 

2461
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:18,970
works
and white of all right the big y

2462
01:05:18,970 --> 01:05:18,980
and white of all right the big y
 

2463
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:21,340
and white of all right the big y
question yeah it must have some some

2464
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:21,350
question yeah it must have some some
 

2465
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:24,130
question yeah it must have some some
purpose yeah obviously test you know

2466
01:05:24,130 --> 01:05:24,140
purpose yeah obviously test you know
 

2467
01:05:24,140 --> 01:05:30,250
purpose yeah obviously test you know
some social purpose is is probably if

2468
01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:30,260
some social purpose is is probably if
 

2469
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:32,950
some social purpose is is probably if
neuroscience holds the key to at least

2470
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:32,960
neuroscience holds the key to at least
 

2471
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:34,690
neuroscience holds the key to at least
eliminate some aspect of ethics that

2472
01:05:34,690 --> 01:05:34,700
eliminate some aspect of ethics that
 

2473
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:36,730
eliminate some aspect of ethics that
means it could be a learn about problem

2474
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:36,740
means it could be a learn about problem
 

2475
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:38,230
means it could be a learn about problem
yeah exactly

2476
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:38,240
yeah exactly
 

2477
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:41,170
yeah exactly
and as we're getting into harder and

2478
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:41,180
and as we're getting into harder and
 

2479
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:43,300
and as we're getting into harder and
harder questions let's go to the hard

2480
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:43,310
harder questions let's go to the hard
 

2481
01:05:43,310 --> 01:05:45,880
harder questions let's go to the hard
problem of consciousness yeah is this an

2482
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:45,890
problem of consciousness yeah is this an
 

2483
01:05:45,890 --> 01:05:48,910
problem of consciousness yeah is this an
important problem for us to think about

2484
01:05:48,910 --> 01:05:48,920
important problem for us to think about
 

2485
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:51,490
important problem for us to think about
and solve on the engineering of

2486
01:05:51,490 --> 01:05:51,500
and solve on the engineering of
 

2487
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:53,910
and solve on the engineering of
intelligence side of your work of our

2488
01:05:53,910 --> 01:05:53,920
intelligence side of your work of our
 

2489
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:59,080
intelligence side of your work of our
dream you know it's unclear so you know

2490
01:05:59,080 --> 01:05:59,090
dream you know it's unclear so you know
 

2491
01:05:59,090 --> 01:06:02,920
dream you know it's unclear so you know
again this is a deep problem part

2492
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:02,930
again this is a deep problem part
 

2493
01:06:02,930 --> 01:06:05,490
again this is a deep problem part
because it's very difficult to define

2494
01:06:05,490 --> 01:06:05,500
because it's very difficult to define
 

2495
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:09,160
because it's very difficult to define
consciousness and

2496
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:09,170

 

2497
01:06:09,170 --> 01:06:14,910

and there is the debate among

2498
01:06:14,910 --> 01:06:14,920
and there is the debate among
 

2499
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:20,010
and there is the debate among
neuroscientist and about whether

2500
01:06:20,010 --> 01:06:20,020
neuroscientist and about whether
 

2501
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:22,720
neuroscientist and about whether
consciousness and philosophers of course

2502
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:22,730
consciousness and philosophers of course
 

2503
01:06:22,730 --> 01:06:25,990
consciousness and philosophers of course
whether consciousness is something that

2504
01:06:25,990 --> 01:06:26,000
whether consciousness is something that
 

2505
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:31,000
whether consciousness is something that
requires flesh and blood so to speak yes

2506
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:31,010
requires flesh and blood so to speak yes
 

2507
01:06:31,010 --> 01:06:36,280
requires flesh and blood so to speak yes
or could be you know that we could have

2508
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:36,290
or could be you know that we could have
 

2509
01:06:36,290 --> 01:06:41,830
or could be you know that we could have
silicon devices that are conscious or up

2510
01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:41,840
silicon devices that are conscious or up
 

2511
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:44,440
silicon devices that are conscious or up
to statement like everything has some

2512
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:44,450
to statement like everything has some
 

2513
01:06:44,450 --> 01:06:47,110
to statement like everything has some
degree of consciousness and some more

2514
01:06:47,110 --> 01:06:47,120
degree of consciousness and some more
 

2515
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:51,040
degree of consciousness and some more
than others this is like Giulio Tononi

2516
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:51,050
than others this is like Giulio Tononi
 

2517
01:06:51,050 --> 01:06:55,510
than others this is like Giulio Tononi
and she would just recently talk to

2518
01:06:55,510 --> 01:06:55,520
and she would just recently talk to
 

2519
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:57,970
and she would just recently talk to
Christophe Koch okay so he a crystal

2520
01:06:57,970 --> 01:06:57,980
Christophe Koch okay so he a crystal
 

2521
01:06:57,980 --> 01:07:00,790
Christophe Koch okay so he a crystal
force my first graduate student yeah do

2522
01:07:00,790 --> 01:07:00,800
force my first graduate student yeah do
 

2523
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:04,420
force my first graduate student yeah do
you think it's important to illuminate

2524
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:04,430
you think it's important to illuminate
 

2525
01:07:04,430 --> 01:07:07,650
you think it's important to illuminate
aspects of consciousness in order to

2526
01:07:07,650 --> 01:07:07,660
aspects of consciousness in order to
 

2527
01:07:07,660 --> 01:07:10,450
aspects of consciousness in order to
engineer intelligence systems do you

2528
01:07:10,450 --> 01:07:10,460
engineer intelligence systems do you
 

2529
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:12,580
engineer intelligence systems do you
think an intelligent system would

2530
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:12,590
think an intelligent system would
 

2531
01:07:12,590 --> 01:07:14,710
think an intelligent system would
ultimately have consciousness are they

2532
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:14,720
ultimately have consciousness are they
 

2533
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:19,840
ultimately have consciousness are they
to the interlinked you know most of the

2534
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:19,850
to the interlinked you know most of the
 

2535
01:07:19,850 --> 01:07:21,580
to the interlinked you know most of the
people working in artificial

2536
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:21,590
people working in artificial
 

2537
01:07:21,590 --> 01:07:24,160
people working in artificial
intelligence I think who'd answer

2538
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:24,170
intelligence I think who'd answer
 

2539
01:07:24,170 --> 01:07:26,950
intelligence I think who'd answer
we don't strictly need the consciousness

2540
01:07:26,950 --> 01:07:26,960
we don't strictly need the consciousness
 

2541
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:30,190
we don't strictly need the consciousness
to have an intelligent system that's

2542
01:07:30,190 --> 01:07:30,200
to have an intelligent system that's
 

2543
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:32,500
to have an intelligent system that's
sort of the easier question because yeah

2544
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:32,510
sort of the easier question because yeah
 

2545
01:07:32,510 --> 01:07:34,690
sort of the easier question because yeah
because it's it's a very engineering

2546
01:07:34,690 --> 01:07:34,700
because it's it's a very engineering
 

2547
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:36,280
because it's it's a very engineering
answer to the question yes that's the

2548
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:36,290
answer to the question yes that's the
 

2549
01:07:36,290 --> 01:07:37,630
answer to the question yes that's the
Turing test will run in consciousness

2550
01:07:37,630 --> 01:07:37,640
Turing test will run in consciousness
 

2551
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:41,500
Turing test will run in consciousness
but if you were to go do you think it's

2552
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:41,510
but if you were to go do you think it's
 

2553
01:07:41,510 --> 01:07:46,390
but if you were to go do you think it's
possible that we need to have so that

2554
01:07:46,390 --> 01:07:46,400
possible that we need to have so that
 

2555
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:50,320
possible that we need to have so that
kind of self-awareness we may yes so for

2556
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:50,330
kind of self-awareness we may yes so for
 

2557
01:07:50,330 --> 01:07:54,990
kind of self-awareness we may yes so for
instance I I personally think that when

2558
01:07:54,990 --> 01:07:55,000
instance I I personally think that when
 

2559
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:59,650
instance I I personally think that when
test a machine or a person in a Turing

2560
01:07:59,650 --> 01:07:59,660
test a machine or a person in a Turing
 

2561
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:02,760
test a machine or a person in a Turing
test in an extended to interesting I

2562
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:02,770
test in an extended to interesting I
 

2563
01:08:02,770 --> 01:08:08,770
test in an extended to interesting I
think consciousness is part of what we

2564
01:08:08,770 --> 01:08:08,780
think consciousness is part of what we
 

2565
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:11,650
think consciousness is part of what we
require in that test you know in

2566
01:08:11,650 --> 01:08:11,660
require in that test you know in
 

2567
01:08:11,660 --> 01:08:14,520
require in that test you know in
priestly to say that this is intelligent

2568
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:14,530
priestly to say that this is intelligent
 

2569
01:08:14,530 --> 01:08:18,850
priestly to say that this is intelligent
Christophe disagrees so as he does yeah

2570
01:08:18,850 --> 01:08:18,860
Christophe disagrees so as he does yeah
 

2571
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:22,360
Christophe disagrees so as he does yeah
it despite many other romantic notions

2572
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:22,370
it despite many other romantic notions
 

2573
01:08:22,370 --> 01:08:22,760
it despite many other romantic notions
he who

2574
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:22,770
he who
 

2575
01:08:22,770 --> 01:08:25,970
he who
he disagrees with that one yes that's

2576
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:25,980
he disagrees with that one yes that's
 

2577
01:08:25,980 --> 01:08:26,450
he disagrees with that one yes that's
right

2578
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:26,460
right
 

2579
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:31,760
right
so you know we would see do you think as

2580
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:31,770
so you know we would see do you think as
 

2581
01:08:31,770 --> 01:08:33,910
so you know we would see do you think as
a quick question

2582
01:08:33,910 --> 01:08:33,920
a quick question
 

2583
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:37,729
a quick question
Ernest Becker fear of death

2584
01:08:37,729 --> 01:08:37,739
Ernest Becker fear of death
 

2585
01:08:37,739 --> 01:08:41,450
Ernest Becker fear of death
do you think mortality and those kinds

2586
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:41,460
do you think mortality and those kinds
 

2587
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:46,640
do you think mortality and those kinds
of things are important for well for

2588
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:46,650
of things are important for well for
 

2589
01:08:46,650 --> 01:08:49,309
of things are important for well for
consciousness and for intelligence the

2590
01:08:49,309 --> 01:08:49,319
consciousness and for intelligence the
 

2591
01:08:49,319 --> 01:08:52,309
consciousness and for intelligence the
finiteness of life finiteness of

2592
01:08:52,309 --> 01:08:52,319
finiteness of life finiteness of
 

2593
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:55,309
finiteness of life finiteness of
existence or is that just the side

2594
01:08:55,309 --> 01:08:55,319
existence or is that just the side

effect of evolutionary side effect is

2596
01:08:57,769 --> 01:08:57,779
effect of evolutionary side effect is
 

2597
01:08:57,779 --> 01:09:01,249
effect of evolutionary side effect is
useful to a for natural selection do you

2598
01:09:01,249 --> 01:09:01,259
useful to a for natural selection do you
 

2599
01:09:01,259 --> 01:09:03,019
useful to a for natural selection do you
think this kind of thing that we're

2600
01:09:03,019 --> 01:09:03,029
think this kind of thing that we're
 

2601
01:09:03,029 --> 01:09:04,370
think this kind of thing that we're
gonna this interview is gonna run out of

2602
01:09:04,370 --> 01:09:04,380
gonna this interview is gonna run out of
 

2603
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:06,979
gonna this interview is gonna run out of
time soon our life will run out of time

2604
01:09:06,979 --> 01:09:06,989
time soon our life will run out of time
 

2605
01:09:06,989 --> 01:09:09,140
time soon our life will run out of time
soon do you think that's needed to make

2606
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:09,150
soon do you think that's needed to make
 

2607
01:09:09,150 --> 01:09:11,900
soon do you think that's needed to make
this conversation good and in life good

2608
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:11,910
this conversation good and in life good
 

2609
01:09:11,910 --> 01:09:13,789
this conversation good and in life good
you know I never thought about it is it

2610
01:09:13,789 --> 01:09:13,799
you know I never thought about it is it
 

2611
01:09:13,799 --> 01:09:17,140
you know I never thought about it is it
a very interesting question I think

2612
01:09:17,140 --> 01:09:17,150
a very interesting question I think
 

2613
01:09:17,150 --> 01:09:21,260
a very interesting question I think
Steve Jobs in his commencement speech at

2614
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:21,270
Steve Jobs in his commencement speech at
 

2615
01:09:21,270 --> 01:09:25,760
Steve Jobs in his commencement speech at
Stanford argued that you know having a

2616
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:25,770
Stanford argued that you know having a
 

2617
01:09:25,770 --> 01:09:28,880
Stanford argued that you know having a
finite life was important for for

2618
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:28,890
finite life was important for for
 

2619
01:09:28,890 --> 01:09:30,709
finite life was important for for
stimulating achievement so I was a

2620
01:09:30,709 --> 01:09:30,719
stimulating achievement so I was a
 

2621
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:32,479
stimulating achievement so I was a
different yeah I live every day like

2622
01:09:32,479 --> 01:09:32,489
different yeah I live every day like
 

2623
01:09:32,489 --> 01:09:36,430
different yeah I live every day like
it's your last right yeah yeah so I

2624
01:09:36,430 --> 01:09:36,440
it's your last right yeah yeah so I
 

2625
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:40,670
it's your last right yeah yeah so I
rationally I don't think strictly you

2626
01:09:40,670 --> 01:09:40,680
rationally I don't think strictly you
 

2627
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:44,590
rationally I don't think strictly you
need mortality for consciousness but oh

2628
01:09:44,590 --> 01:09:44,600
need mortality for consciousness but oh
 

2629
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:47,300
need mortality for consciousness but oh
no they seem to go together in our

2630
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:47,310
no they seem to go together in our
 

2631
01:09:47,310 --> 01:09:52,120
no they seem to go together in our
biological system yeah you've mentioned

2632
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:52,130
biological system yeah you've mentioned
 

2633
01:09:52,130 --> 01:09:57,190
biological system yeah you've mentioned
before and students are associated with

2634
01:09:57,190 --> 01:09:57,200
before and students are associated with
 

2635
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:59,750
before and students are associated with
alpha go immobilize the big recent

2636
01:09:59,750 --> 01:09:59,760
alpha go immobilize the big recent
 

2637
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:01,580
alpha go immobilize the big recent
success stories in the eye and I think

2638
01:10:01,580 --> 01:10:01,590
success stories in the eye and I think
 

2639
01:10:01,590 --> 01:10:04,640
success stories in the eye and I think
it's captivated the entire world of what

2640
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:04,650
it's captivated the entire world of what
 

2641
01:10:04,650 --> 01:10:08,030
it's captivated the entire world of what
I can do so what do you think will be

2642
01:10:08,030 --> 01:10:08,040
I can do so what do you think will be
 

2643
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:11,000
I can do so what do you think will be
the next breakthrough and what's your

2644
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:11,010
the next breakthrough and what's your
 

2645
01:10:11,010 --> 01:10:13,729
the next breakthrough and what's your
intuition about the next breakthrough of

2646
01:10:13,729 --> 01:10:13,739
intuition about the next breakthrough of
 

2647
01:10:13,739 --> 01:10:15,440
intuition about the next breakthrough of
course I don't know where the next

2648
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:15,450
course I don't know where the next
 

2649
01:10:15,450 --> 01:10:19,880
course I don't know where the next
breakthroughs is I think that there is a

2650
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:19,890
breakthroughs is I think that there is a
 

2651
01:10:19,890 --> 01:10:21,709
breakthroughs is I think that there is a
good chance as I said before that the

2652
01:10:21,709 --> 01:10:21,719
good chance as I said before that the
 

2653
01:10:21,719 --> 01:10:23,570
good chance as I said before that the
next breakthrough would also be inspired

2654
01:10:23,570 --> 01:10:23,580
next breakthrough would also be inspired
 

2655
01:10:23,580 --> 01:10:27,560
next breakthrough would also be inspired
by you know neuroscience

2656
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:27,570
by you know neuroscience
 

2657
01:10:27,570 --> 01:10:32,060
by you know neuroscience
but which one I don't know

2658
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:32,070
but which one I don't know
 

2659
01:10:32,070 --> 01:10:34,459
but which one I don't know
and there's so MIT has this quest for

2660
01:10:34,459 --> 01:10:34,469
and there's so MIT has this quest for
 

2661
01:10:34,469 --> 01:10:36,560
and there's so MIT has this quest for
intelligence you know and there's a few

2662
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:36,570
intelligence you know and there's a few
 

2663
01:10:36,570 --> 01:10:39,379
intelligence you know and there's a few
moon shots which in that spirit which

2664
01:10:39,379 --> 01:10:39,389
moon shots which in that spirit which
 

2665
01:10:39,389 --> 01:10:41,959
moon shots which in that spirit which
ones are you excited about what which

2666
01:10:41,959 --> 01:10:41,969
ones are you excited about what which
 

2667
01:10:41,969 --> 01:10:44,720
ones are you excited about what which
projects kind of well of course I'm

2668
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:44,730
projects kind of well of course I'm
 

2669
01:10:44,730 --> 01:10:48,319
projects kind of well of course I'm
excited about one of the moon shots with

2670
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:48,329
excited about one of the moon shots with
 

2671
01:10:48,329 --> 01:10:50,870
excited about one of the moon shots with
it which is our Center for brains minds

2672
01:10:50,870 --> 01:10:50,880
it which is our Center for brains minds
 

2673
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:53,720

01:11:02,870 --> 01:11:02,880
is about visual intelligence it's an
 

2679
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:05,060
is about visual intelligence it's an
area that one has a particularly about

2680
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:05,070
area that one has a particularly about
 

2681
01:11:05,070 --> 01:11:07,490
area that one has a particularly about
understanding visual intelligence or

2682
01:11:07,490 --> 01:11:07,500
understanding visual intelligence or
 

2683
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:11,439
understanding visual intelligence or
visual cortex and and visual

2684
01:11:11,439 --> 01:11:11,449
visual cortex and and visual
 

2685
01:11:11,449 --> 01:11:15,169
visual cortex and and visual
intelligence in the sense of how we look

2686
01:11:15,169 --> 01:11:15,179
intelligence in the sense of how we look
 

2687
01:11:15,179 --> 01:11:20,450
intelligence in the sense of how we look
around ourselves and understand the word

2688
01:11:20,450 --> 01:11:20,460
around ourselves and understand the word
 

2689
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:23,629
around ourselves and understand the word

01:11:28,189 --> 01:11:28,199
what is going on how we could go from
 

2693
01:11:28,199 --> 01:11:31,299
what is going on how we could go from
here to there without hitting obstacles

2694
01:11:31,299 --> 01:11:31,309
here to there without hitting obstacles
 

2695

you know whether there are other agents

2696
01:11:34,310 --> 01:11:34,320
you know whether there are other agents

things that we perceive very quickly and
 

2701
01:11:42,199 --> 01:11:45,500
things that we perceive very quickly and

found the the actual process of you know

2814
01:15:00,420 --> 01:15:00,430
found the the actual process of you know
 

2815
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:03,720
found the the actual process of you know
discovering something is more fun if

2816
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:03,730
discovering something is more fun if
 

2817
01:15:03,730 --> 01:15:07,410
discovering something is more fun if
it's together with other intelligent and

2818

it's together with other intelligent and
 

2819
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:09,870
it's together with other intelligent and
curious and fun people so if you see the

2820
01:15:09,870 --> 01:15:09,880
curious and fun people so if you see the
 

2821
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,970
curious and fun people so if you see the
fun in that process of the side effect

2822
01:15:11,970 --> 01:15:11,980
fun in that process of the side effect
 

2823
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:14,310
fun in that process of the side effect
of that process will be the election of

2824
01:15:14,310 --> 01:15:14,320
of that process will be the election of

faculty and so on it's partly repeating

2838
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:37,450
faculty and so on it's partly repeating
 

2839
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:40,110
faculty and so on it's partly repeating
what I said about an environment that

2840
01:15:40,110 --> 01:15:40,120
what I said about an environment that
 

2841
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:43,950
what I said about an environment that
should be friendly and fun and ambitious

2842

from some of my advisers and friends and
 

2847
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:56,330
from some of my advisers and friends and
some of our physicists and there was

2848
01:15:56,330 --> 01:15:56,340
some of our physicists and there was
 

2849
01:15:56,340 --> 01:16:02,490
some of our physicists and there was
reason this behavior that was encouraged

2850
01:16:02,490 --> 01:16:02,500
reason this behavior that was encouraged
 

2851
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:05,130
reason this behavior that was encouraged
of when somebody comes with a new idea

2852
01:16:05,130 --> 01:16:05,140
of when somebody comes with a new idea
 

2853
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:08,610
of when somebody comes with a new idea
in the group you're unless is really

2854
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:08,620
in the group you're unless is really
 

2855
01:16:08,620 --> 01:16:10,560
in the group you're unless is really
stupid but you are always enthusiastic

2856
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:10,570
stupid but you are always enthusiastic
 

2857
01:16:10,570 --> 01:16:13,680
stupid but you are always enthusiastic
and then and the other two just for a

2858
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:13,690
and then and the other two just for a
 

2859
01:16:13,690 --> 01:16:15,330
and then and the other two just for a
few minutes for a few hours then you

2860
01:16:15,330 --> 01:16:15,340
few minutes for a few hours then you
 

2861
01:16:15,340 --> 01:16:19,920
few minutes for a few hours then you
start you know asking critically a few

2862
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:19,930
start you know asking critically a few
 

2863
01:16:19,930 --> 01:16:24,600
start you know asking critically a few
questions testing but you know this is a

2864
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:24,610
questions testing but you know this is a
 

2865
01:16:24,610 --> 01:16:27,750
questions testing but you know this is a
process that is I think it's very very

2866
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:27,760
process that is I think it's very very
 

2867
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:30,810
process that is I think it's very very
good this you have to be enthusiasm time

2868
01:16:30,810 --> 01:16:30,820
good this you have to be enthusiasm time
 

2869
01:16:30,820 --> 01:16:32,790
good this you have to be enthusiasm time
people are very critical from

2870
01:16:32,790 --> 01:16:32,800
people are very critical from
 

2871
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:36,390
people are very critical from
beginning that's that's that's not yes

2872
01:16:36,390 --> 01:16:36,400
beginning that's that's that's not yes
 

2873
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:38,370
beginning that's that's that's not yes
you have to give it a chance yes let's

2874
01:16:38,370 --> 01:16:38,380
you have to give it a chance yes let's
 

2875
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:41,069
you have to give it a chance yes let's
see to grow that said with some of your

2876
01:16:41,069 --> 01:16:41,079
see to grow that said with some of your
 

2877
01:16:41,079 --> 01:16:42,870
see to grow that said with some of your
ideas which are quite revolutionary so

2878
01:16:42,870 --> 01:16:42,880
ideas which are quite revolutionary so
 

2879
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:44,790
ideas which are quite revolutionary so
there's a witness especially in the

2880
01:16:44,790 --> 01:16:44,800
there's a witness especially in the
 

2881
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,830
there's a witness especially in the
human vision side and neuroscience side

2882
01:16:46,830 --> 01:16:46,840
human vision side and neuroscience side
 

2883
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:48,240
human vision side and neuroscience side
there could be some pretty heated

2884
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:48,250
there could be some pretty heated
 

2885
01:16:48,250 --> 01:16:51,419
there could be some pretty heated
arguments do you enjoy these dessert a

2886
01:16:51,419 --> 01:16:51,429
arguments do you enjoy these dessert a
 

2887
01:16:51,429 --> 01:16:54,060
arguments do you enjoy these dessert a
part of science and I could academic

2888
01:16:54,060 --> 01:16:54,070
part of science and I could academic
 

2889
01:16:54,070 --> 01:16:58,200
part of science and I could academic
pursue see you enjoy yeah is it is that

2890
01:16:58,200 --> 01:16:58,210
pursue see you enjoy yeah is it is that
 

2891
01:16:58,210 --> 01:16:59,850
pursue see you enjoy yeah is it is that
something that happens in your group as

2892
01:16:59,850 --> 01:16:59,860
something that happens in your group as
 

2893
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:03,270
something that happens in your group as
well yeah absolutely I also spent some

2894
01:17:03,270 --> 01:17:03,280
well yeah absolutely I also spent some
 

2895
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:05,160
well yeah absolutely I also spent some
time in Germany again that is this

2896
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:05,170
time in Germany again that is this
 

2897
01:17:05,170 --> 01:17:09,290
time in Germany again that is this
tradition in which people are more

2898
01:17:09,290 --> 01:17:09,300
tradition in which people are more
 

2899
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:17,160
tradition in which people are more
forthright less kind than here so you

2900
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:17,170
forthright less kind than here so you
 

2901
01:17:17,170 --> 01:17:19,049
forthright less kind than here so you
know in the u.s. you when you write a

2902
01:17:19,049 --> 01:17:19,059
know in the u.s. you when you write a
 

2903
01:17:19,059 --> 01:17:22,729
know in the u.s. you when you write a
bad letter you still say this guy's nice

2904
01:17:22,729 --> 01:17:22,739
bad letter you still say this guy's nice
 

2905
01:17:22,739 --> 01:17:27,810
bad letter you still say this guy's nice
yes so yet here in America its degrees

2906
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:27,820
yes so yet here in America its degrees
 

2907
01:17:27,820 --> 01:17:30,569
yes so yet here in America its degrees
of nice yes it's all just degrees of

2908
01:17:30,569 --> 01:17:30,579
of nice yes it's all just degrees of
 

2909
01:17:30,579 --> 01:17:33,089
of nice yes it's all just degrees of
Nicaea right right so as long as this

2910
01:17:33,089 --> 01:17:33,099
Nicaea right right so as long as this
 

2911
01:17:33,099 --> 01:17:37,140
Nicaea right right so as long as this
does not become personal and it's really

2912
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:37,150
does not become personal and it's really
 

2913
01:17:37,150 --> 01:17:40,979
does not become personal and it's really
like you know a football game with these

2914
01:17:40,979 --> 01:17:40,989
like you know a football game with these
 

2915
01:17:40,989 --> 01:17:47,760
like you know a football game with these
rules that's great so if you somehow

2916
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:47,770
rules that's great so if you somehow
 

2917
01:17:47,770 --> 01:17:50,189
rules that's great so if you somehow
found yourself in a position to ask one

2918
01:17:50,189 --> 01:17:50,199
found yourself in a position to ask one
 

2919
01:17:50,199 --> 01:17:52,859
found yourself in a position to ask one
question of an Oracle like a genie maybe

2920
01:17:52,859 --> 01:17:52,869
question of an Oracle like a genie maybe
 

2921
01:17:52,869 --> 01:17:56,520
question of an Oracle like a genie maybe
a god whoa and you're guaranteed to get

2922
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:56,530
a god whoa and you're guaranteed to get
 

2923
01:17:56,530 --> 01:17:59,669
a god whoa and you're guaranteed to get
a clear answer what kind of question

2924
01:17:59,669 --> 01:17:59,679
a clear answer what kind of question
 

2925
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:02,339
a clear answer what kind of question
would you ask what what would be the

2926
01:18:02,339 --> 01:18:02,349
would you ask what what would be the
 

2927
01:18:02,349 --> 01:18:05,250
would you ask what what would be the
question you would ask in the spirit of

2928
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:05,260
question you would ask in the spirit of
 

2929
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:07,080
question you would ask in the spirit of
our discussion it could be how could be

2930
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:07,090
our discussion it could be how could be
 

2931
01:18:07,090 --> 01:18:09,270
our discussion it could be how could be
how could I become ten times more

2932
01:18:09,270 --> 01:18:09,280
how could I become ten times more
 

2933
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:13,979
how could I become ten times more
intelligent and so but see you only get

2934
01:18:13,979 --> 01:18:13,989
intelligent and so but see you only get
 

2935
01:18:13,989 --> 01:18:16,620
intelligent and so but see you only get
a clear short answer so do you think

2936
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:16,630
a clear short answer so do you think
 

2937
01:18:16,630 --> 01:18:19,669
a clear short answer so do you think
there's a clear short answer to that no

2938
01:18:19,669 --> 01:18:19,679
there's a clear short answer to that no
 

2939
01:18:19,679 --> 01:18:22,410
there's a clear short answer to that no
and that's the answer you'll get yeah

2940
01:18:22,410 --> 01:18:22,420
and that's the answer you'll get yeah
 

2941
01:18:22,420 --> 01:18:25,620
and that's the answer you'll get yeah
okay so you've mentioned flowers of

2942
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:25,630
okay so you've mentioned flowers of
 

2943
01:18:25,630 --> 01:18:28,979
okay so you've mentioned flowers of
Algren odd oh yeah this is a story that

2944
01:18:28,979 --> 01:18:28,989
Algren odd oh yeah this is a story that
 

2945
01:18:28,989 --> 01:18:33,649
Algren odd oh yeah this is a story that
inspires you in your childhood as this

2946
01:18:33,649 --> 01:18:33,659
inspires you in your childhood as this
 

2947

story of a mouse and human achieving
 

2949
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:39,680
story of a mouse and human achieving
genius-level intelligence and then

2950
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:39,690
genius-level intelligence and then
 

2951
01:18:39,690 --> 01:18:41,640
genius-level intelligence and then
understanding what was happening while

2952
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:41,650
understanding what was happening while
 

2953
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:44,280
understanding what was happening while
slowly becoming not intelligent again in

2954
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:44,290
slowly becoming not intelligent again in
 

2955
01:18:44,290 --> 01:18:45,810
slowly becoming not intelligent again in
this tragedy of

2956
01:18:45,810 --> 01:18:45,820
this tragedy of
 

2957
01:18:45,820 --> 01:18:48,720
this tragedy of
intelligence and losing intelligence do

2958
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:48,730
intelligence and losing intelligence do
 

2959
01:18:48,730 --> 01:18:51,180
intelligence and losing intelligence do
you think in that spirit and that story

2960
01:18:51,180 --> 01:18:51,190
you think in that spirit and that story
 

2961
01:18:51,190 --> 01:18:53,540
you think in that spirit and that story
do you think intelligence is a gift or

2962
01:18:53,540 --> 01:18:53,550
do you think intelligence is a gift or
 

2963
01:18:53,550 --> 01:18:57,930
do you think intelligence is a gift or
curse from the perspective of happiness

2964
01:18:57,930 --> 01:18:57,940
curse from the perspective of happiness
 

2965
01:18:57,940 --> 01:19:01,110
curse from the perspective of happiness
and meaning of life you try to create

2966
01:19:01,110 --> 01:19:01,120
and meaning of life you try to create
 

2967
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:03,000
and meaning of life you try to create
intelligence system that understands the

2968
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:03,010
intelligence system that understands the
 

2969
01:19:03,010 --> 01:19:05,460
intelligence system that understands the
universe but at an individual level the

2970
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:05,470
universe but at an individual level the
 

2971
01:19:05,470 --> 01:19:06,720
universe but at an individual level the
meaning of life do you think

2972
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:06,730
meaning of life do you think
 

2973
01:19:06,730 --> 01:19:11,220
meaning of life do you think
intelligence is a gift it's a good

2974
01:19:11,220 --> 01:19:11,230
intelligence is a gift it's a good
 

2975
01:19:11,230 --> 01:19:15,069
intelligence is a gift it's a good
question

2976
01:19:15,069 --> 01:19:15,079

 

2977
01:19:15,079 --> 01:19:24,969

I don't know as one of this as one

2978
01:19:24,969 --> 01:19:24,979
I don't know as one of this as one
 

2979

I don't know as one of this as one
people consider the smartest people in

2980
01:19:27,609 --> 01:19:27,619
people consider the smartest people in
 

2981
01:19:27,619 --> 01:19:30,399

01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:30,409
the world in some in some dimension at
 

2983
01:19:30,409 --> 01:19:35,139
the world in some in some dimension at
the very least what do you think no no

2984
01:19:35,139 --> 01:19:35,149
the very least what do you think no no
 

2985
01:19:35,149 --> 01:19:37,389
the very least what do you think no no
it may be invariant to intelligence

2986
01:19:37,389 --> 01:19:37,399
it may be invariant to intelligence
 

2987
01:19:37,399 --> 01:19:40,479
it may be invariant to intelligence
likely of happiness would be nice if it

2988
01:19:40,479 --> 01:19:40,489
likely of happiness would be nice if it
 

2989
01:19:40,489 --> 01:19:44,469
likely of happiness would be nice if it
were that's the hope

2990
01:19:44,469 --> 01:19:44,479
were that's the hope
 

2991
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:48,189
were that's the hope
yeah you could be smart and happy and

2992
01:19:48,189 --> 01:19:48,199
yeah you could be smart and happy and
 

2993
01:19:48,199 --> 01:19:53,169
yeah you could be smart and happy and
clueless unhappy yeah as always on the

2994
01:19:53,169 --> 01:19:53,179
clueless unhappy yeah as always on the
 

2995
01:19:53,179 --> 01:19:54,609
clueless unhappy yeah as always on the
discussion of the meaning of life it's

2996
01:19:54,609 --> 01:19:54,619
discussion of the meaning of life it's
 

2997
01:19:54,619 --> 01:19:57,759
discussion of the meaning of life it's
probably a good place to end Tommaso

2998
01:19:57,759 --> 01:19:57,769
probably a good place to end Tommaso
 

2999
01:19:57,769 --> 01:19:58,929
probably a good place to end Tommaso
